Chapter 302: Crawl On Your Knees Here And Pay Respect To Great Martial Nanny (1)

“Tell me. What do you think of asking them to crawl over to lick my shoes and call me daddy?” Sui Ao looked around him as he commented casually with disdain.

However, just as he completed his sentence, he broke into laughter and answered his own question, “I think that’s a pretty good suggestion.”

After which, he stood up.

The surrounding group of young men naturally saw him as their leader and got out from their cars.

“Brother Ao, those girls over there are pretty good-looking. Licking shoes might be a little too much. Let me remove my shoes instead!”

“Haha, Gu Zai! Are you trying to stink them to death with your size forty-five feet?”

“I can’t imagine the stench of his feet after he removes his shoes. You are too cruel!”

The few young men broke into laughter and joked as they walked towards the hotel.

All of them were swollen with inordinate arrogance.

They were all from elite tier families in Shang Jing. Each one of them possessed considerable strength. Moreover, they had now gathered together and had Sui Ao who came from the highest tier existence in Shang Jing. Therefore, the group was fearful of nothing.

When the crowd walked into the hotel, a middle-aged man and an old man stood to the left and right of Sui Ao respectively. Both of them gave off horrifying vibes.

Sui Ao, who was standing in the middle, looked at Wang Xian and the group with contempt. He walked towards a chair at the side and placed one of his legs on it.

“I, Sui Ao, typically wouldn’t argue with girls. However, you guys have offended my brother and therefore you guys have offended us.”

Sui Ao squinted his eyes and shouted, “Come here and kneel down!”

“Come and kneel down immediately. Otherwise, we will toy with you till you die!” Yuan Fei stared at Wang Xian and the group and chided before walking to the side of Sui Ao.

“Hehe. You guys are so incredible!” Wang Xian looked at the group of twenty to thirty young men coldly.

“Who are those people? Why are they so noisy?”

“Yeah! Why are they still kicking up a fuss in the middle of the night and disrupting our rest!”

At this moment, some guests arrived at the lobby of the hotel. Clearly, the commotion caused when the car crashed directly into the hotel had alarmed many people.

Seven to eight middle-aged men were in their pajamas. They had tattoos on their hands, with fat drooping down their face. But they looked extremely fierce.

They bemoaned unhappily. However, when they saw the group of young men in the lobby, they were taken aback. Their gaze fell on some of them as their pupils constricted.

“Young Master Zhen, Young Master Feng, Young Master Li!”

The few of them immediately went over to the group of young men to greet them.

However, the group of young men wasn’t paying attention to them. Their eyes were still fixed on Wang Xian’s group.

“Tsk! You guys must be eager to die to offend Young Master Zhen and his friends!”

A middle-aged man chided Wang Xian and the group to get on the good books of Young Master Zhen.

“Scram!” Mo Qinglong looked at the group of middle-aged men and shouted. Horrifying aura and killing intent swept towards them.

“You are...”

Plop!

The group of middle-aged men couldn’t withstand Mo Qinglong’s aura fully as they were knocked unconscious and fell to the ground.

After which, Mo Qinglong turned to Sui Ao and the group. Contempt and disdain were written all over his face as he said, “Can you afford the consequences for making us kneel before you?”

“Inborn expert? It’s no surprise that you guys are acting so presumptuously!”

Sui Ao squinted his eyes and stared coldly at Mo Qinglong as he continued. “From your accent, I believe you must have come from somewhere other than Shang Jing. Haven’t you heard of the saying, ‘In Shang Jing, even Inborn experts have to keep a low profile. Otherwise...’”

The middle-aged and old men beside him stepped forward at this moment. The aura of Inborn experts immediately shrouded towards Mo Qinglong as they continued the sentence for Sui Ao: “Otherwise, you will die too!”

“Haha! I wonder who gives you the guts to be arrogant in our territory. Right now, I’ll give you five seconds to get here and kneel before us. Otherwise, you guys can forget about leaving Shang Jing. Not even an Inborn expert could escape!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Yuan Fei’s haughty voice sounded once again.

“Don’t be so imperious!” When Guan Shuqing saw the arrogant looks of Sui Ao, she was infuriated and continued, “You are Sui Ao? This has nothing to do with you. Stay out of this and don’t be arrogant. Otherwise, I’ll let my master know!”

“Haha! Imperious?” Sui Ao burst into laughter. “A few foreigners dare to offend my brother. It’s only natural that I’ll be involved now. Let your master know? Even if your master was here, he would have to kneel before me like you guys. All of you here have to kneel before me today until the sun rises. Otherwise, I’ll strip you guys and throw you on the street. You girls are pretty good-looking. I believe there would be lots of people interested!”

“Hehe! Brother Ao, these girls are really beautiful.”

“Haha! They are pretty good. However, I still prefer to see the horrified looks of beautiful girls!”

“What a pervert you are!”

As Sui Ao completed his words, the group of young men around him joked and conversed casually. This group of young men wasn’t concerned about the strength that Mo Qinglong had demonstrated, or Wang Xian and the group.

“YOU... Great, great. I’ll convey what you said to my master!”

Guan Shuqing was referring to Sui Huang when she talked about her master. She had asked Sui Ao to stay out of this but he started insulting them instead.

This infuriated her and made her pull out her phone right away.

“Aiyoh! She’s really calling her parents now! Haha, this is interesting!”

When Yuan Fei saw Guan Shuqing take out her phone, he looked at her with ridicule and mocked loudly, “I’ll let you call anyone you wish. In Shang Jing, there’s really no one we are afraid of.”

“Get your master here! I’ll let him kneel down in front of me too!” said Sui Ao disdainfully.

Hearing what Sui Ao and his friends had said, a cold light flashed in her eyes.

“Hello, master! Someone is bullying me!”

Guan Shuqing’s voice sounded. When she called through the phone to Sui Huang, she immediately spoke bitterly.

“Huh? There’re people who dare to bully you when Brother Wang Xian is with you? Where are you? I’ll send my guys over!”

In a Siheyuan in Shang Jing, Sui Huang sat with his legs crossed, cultivating. When he heard his disciple, he was taken aback initially. [1]

“His name is Sui Ao. He brought many people with him and they surrounded us. After which, he demanded that we kneel before him and even wanted to strip us and throw us to the streets. I told him that I’d be informing you and he said he would make master kneel in front of him if master was here!”

Guan Shuqing snitched to Sui Huang as she repeated everything Sui Ao had said previously.

“Haha, you really called your master? In that case, tell him to get right here, kneel before us and apologize!”

Sui Ao heard what Guan Shuqing said over the phone and responded loudly with disdain.
