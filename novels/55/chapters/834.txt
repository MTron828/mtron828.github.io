“Wang Xian, I heard from Xiao Yu, Qing Yue, Guan Shuqing and the rest that you were once resurrected here!”

Feng Luan came to the side of the Dragon Pool. Her eyes were sparkling as she stared at the Dragon Pool.

There was not much dragon blood there and it was emitting a mysterious power.

There were nine divine dragons coiled around the nine dragon pillars. They looked like real divine dragons.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian looked at her and suddenly guessed something. “Do you want it?”

“To rebuild my body. After this period of training, I have already made preparations!”

Feng Luan’s eyes flickered as she said.

She could be considered to have taken over Guan Shuqing’s body. After a few months, there were many things that she could not do besides not getting used to it.

She needed her own body, needed to return to the supernatural world, and needed to improve her strength quickly.

She needed revenge!

“How do you need to rebuild your body? Are there any losses to Shuqing’s body?”

Wang Xian frowned slightly and asked her.

“I need to take half of the Vermilion Bird Essence Blood. However, with our current strength, even if we split it equally, we still have the strength of a Superior Immortal!”

Feng Luan said to Wang Xian, “Also, I Need the blood essence in the Dragon Pool. I don’t know what kind of fortuitous encounter you had. The blood essence here is extremely sacred. I can absorb it and convert it into Vermillion Bird’s blood. I can use the blood essence here to reconstruct my body.”

“Sure!”

Wang Xian nodded slowly. He didn’t want Shu Qing to occupy the same body with another person.

Especially when they were on the bed. Shu Qing was initially very cooperative, but she suddenly stopped moving.

Then, he knew that there must be a change of people. However, he couldn’t stop at that time and could only continue.

Feng Luan, whose body was trembling, didn’t even have the strength to speak, let alone leave.

At first, Wang Xian felt that it was very exciting. However, he felt slightly uncomfortable after experiencing it a few times. He felt like he was a corpse.

“Dragon King!”

At this moment, the voice of Prime Minister Gui and the rest was heard.

Wang Xian looked over and saw Ao Qitian and Ao qi dragging a huge corpse.

Two of the corpses were more than 20 meters long. They were a huge shark with a huge head.

Each tooth was about seven to eight meters long and looked extremely intimidating.

“These are the immortal-level creatures that we killed in the Indian Ocean. There are a total of four of them. These four creatures are not intelligent and have no attributes. However, their vital energy and blood are very rich and their strength is terrifying!”

Ao Qitian reported to Wang Xian.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian looked at the four corpses and initially thought that he would be unable to enter the dragon cave to slowly absorb the blood essence of the four lower-level immortal-level creatures.

He looked at Feng Luan beside him and said, “The blood essence of the four lower-level immortal-level creatures should be able to heal your body, right?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“It’s best to have these immortal-level creatures. After rebuilding my body, I no longer need to increase the strength of my body!”

Feng Luan nodded her head and looked at the nine dragon pillars.

The nine dragon heads that were entrenched on the dragon pillars had glistening blood flowing out of their mouths. Every drop of blood was extremely noble.

“When will it be carried out?”

Wang Xian asked her.

“Since everything is complete, let’s do it now!”

Feng Luan took a deep breath. Her eyes were sparkling as she said to Wang Xian.

“HMM, how confident are you?”

Wang Xian took a look at her and asked hesitantly.

“Don’t worry. Shu Qing will not suffer any losses. I have a 50% confidence!”

Feng Luan said.

“50% ? Isn’t that too low? Should we wait a little longer?”

Wang Xian looked at her expression and reminded her.

“I am not Nirvana. Instead, I am resurrected from the dead. This is a miracle in itself. Unless there is an extremely heaven-defying treasure, I will be in danger of dying. Don’t worry, this is my choice!”

Her eyes were filled with determination. As an empress, a 50% chance of success was already very big in her eyes.

“Alright, if there’s anything I can help you with, just tell me directly!”

Wang Xian nodded and said.

“Alright, I’m going to start. Later, I’m going to separate from Shu Qing’s body!”

As Feng Luan spoke, the spot between her brows suddenly lit up.

Wang Xian saw that she was so eager to rebuild her body. He watched helplessly from the side to prevent any accidents from happening.

A faint flame surrounded Guan Shuqing’s body. The flame did not have the slightest warmth. Instead, it was filled with vitality.

This was the fire of Nirvana, the fire of life.

The clothes on her body were directly turned into ashes under the flame. The spot between her eyebrows twitched violently as if something wanted to jump out from the middle.

“Hiss!”

A soft sound was heard. Wang Xian saw a red blood flying out from the area between his eyebrows.

The blood of the Vermilion Bird.

Wang Xian took a look and saw Guan Shuqing’s body falling to the side. He quickly used his hand to support her.

“HMM?”

Guan Shuqing called out softly. She grabbed his arm and called out softly, “Xiao Xian!”

“Yes, it’s Done!”

Wang Xian looked at Guan Shuqing and revealed a happy smile on his face.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

At this moment, Lan Qingyue and the rest saw the situation over here and flew over quickly.

“Xiao Xian, sister Feng Luan is very pitiful!”

Guan Shuqing hugged Wang Xian’s arm and said to him.

“Let’s see. It’s fate for people from two worlds to meet!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly and looked at the dragon pool.

The Vermillion Bird’s blood essence entered the dragon pool. Feng Luan took the initiative to absorb the blood essence and began to condense her physical body.

To condense a physical body with just a drop of blood essence was something that only a terrifying powerhouse could do.

Even Feng Luan, who was at her peak, could not do this, let alone now.

Fortunately, there was dragon blood in the Dragon Palace. This dragon blood belonged to an ownerless object. It was just a pure energy body and could be easily absorbed.

Gradually, an illusory head appeared in everyone’s sight.

It had an exquisite face, noble and cold.

Even though it did not open its eyes, it still gave people a feeling of looking down on the world.

This was the powerful aura that came from being in a high position for a long time. Even Wang Xian was far from it.

“So Beautiful!”

Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue, and the rest looked at the condensed head and could not help but be stunned.

There were no flaws at all. It was completely flawless and as exquisite as a work of art.

“Eh? After condensing a head, Feng Luan’s blood essence has been consumed by more than half!”

Suddenly, Sun Lingxiu, who was at the side, frowned and exclaimed.

“This is bad. Perhaps the energy in the blood essence is not enough. Feng Luan’s behavior is similar to Nirvana. The Phoenix’s body is extremely weak before nirvana. This is because they need to store the energy and use it during Nirvana. When Feng Luan and Shuqing occupy a body together, they might be able to succeed. But now...”. “...”

Lan Qingyue’s eyes sparkled with a grey glow.

The cultivation of the Kun was to enhance the strength of the physical body. Therefore, Lan Qingyue knew more about the physical body than Wang Xian!
