Chapter 2991: Dragon Palace vs Universe Central Race 2

“Hehe, offend us? You have no right to offend us. Now Give Your Dragon Palace a way out and submit to us!”

Ba Qi stared at Prime Minister Turtle and said arrogantly.

He showed the arrogance of the universe central race without a doubt.

“If we don’t submit to you, do you want to destroy our Dragon Palace?”

Prime Minister Gui stared at Ba Qi and the others and coldly said.

“Submitting to us is your only way out!”

Without waiting for Ba Qi to speak, Elder Gong took a step forward and released a terrifying aura.

A rank 6 void God emperor aura charged forward.

Feeling this aura, all the members of the Dragon Palace revealed solemn expressions.

“I’ll give you ten seconds to consider. If you don’t submit within ten seconds, our four-armed race can only suppress your Dragon Palace!”

Elder Gong judged them with a high and mighty tone.

“The three-eyed race is here!”

At this moment, an intense voice sounded.

His words caused Wang Xian and the rest to heave a sigh of relief.

If they were to attack the four-armed race directly, with the strength of the Dragon Palace, it was sufficient to exterminate them.

However, when they were exterminated, the three-eyed race would also rush over. At that time, the three-eyed race would become vigilant. If that was the case, it would be too difficult for them to kill a rank six void God Emperor.

They had to wait until both races had arrived before they could act.

However, the experts from the four-armed race were too arrogant.

Giving the Dragon Palace 10 seconds to submit?

The eyes of all the members of the Dragon Palace flickered with cold killing intent.

“Elder Yi, the people of the three-eyed race are here!”

The four-armed race was leading the army in the front, but a surprised voice came from the back.

“What?”

Elder Yi’s expression changed slightly, and he immediately looked toward the back.

“They are so fast?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Ba Qi also said with a solemn expression, and a hint of relief flashed in his eyes.

“Eighth elder, they’re from the four-armed race. They’re actually one step ahead of us. That’s the Dragon Cave of the Dragon Palace!”

Mo Sha and the three-eyed race’s experts, who were residing on the three-eyed race’s Yang Feng, arrived.

When they saw the four-armed race in front of them, they immediately spoke to the elder.

“Oh? The people from the Dragon Palace are actually waiting for us here? What do they want to do? Do they want to submit?”

“The four-armed race is quite fast!”

The eighth elder of the three-eyed race flew forward with a cold look in his eyes.

“Three-eyed race, you can go back now. This void belongs to us!”

The elder of the four-armed race looked back and said with a gloomy face.

“Four-armed race, don’t you think you are worse than a three-year-old child?”

The eight elder of the three-eyed race led his subordinates and flew toward the four-armed race.

He glanced around the dragon palace and sized them up.

“Humph!”

The elder of the four-armed race snorted.

All the people of the four-armed race changed their auras and charged toward the three-eyed race.

“You’re courting death!”

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

Mo Sha Roared and released his aura. He charged toward them. The other three-eyed race members didn’t show any fear and welcomed him with their auras.

“Rumble!”

A terrifying sound erupted from the void in the middle of them.

“These two races have at least a thousand god emperors and more than a thousand of them!”

“They are too strong. They are simply too strong. Even though the Dragon Palace is also very strong, the gap between them is too big. There are more than a thousand god Emperors!”

“Is this the power at the center of the Universe? They are undefeatable!”

In the void above the nine annihilation planet, the citizens of the resplendent starry sky felt the power in the void, and their faces turned pale.

More than a thousand God emperors!

The former resplendent starry sky god Emperors added up to only a hundred.

The Dragon Palace was very strong now, but could they withstand it?

From their point of view, they could not!

Some people revealed worried expressions.

In the void ahead, both sides were confronting each other.

The four-armed elder and the eight elders of the three-eyed race also looked at each other. Their eyes were filled with coldness.

The atmosphere was heavy.

“Dragon King, they don’t put us in their eyes at all!”

Tian Chen looked at the two big forces in front of them and said indifferently.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian smiled. He watched quietly and waited for the opportunity.

“Let’s see who’s better when we see the opportunity!”

The tense atmosphere hesitated for a few seconds before a deacon from the three-eyed race spoke to break the deadlock.

The eight elders from the three-eyed race looked at the deacon before looking at the four-armed race.

“I have no objections. After seeing the opportunity, we will decide whether to fight or not!”

The four-armed race elder replied faintly.

After a simple clash of auras, they understood each other’s strength.

If the two sides really fought, there was a high chance that both sides would be injured.

It was obviously not a wise choice to fight without seeing the opportunity.

They quickly came to an agreement and slowly looked at the Dragon Palace.

They locked onto their target this time.

“All the members of Your Dragon Palace come out and kneel in the Void!”

The eighth elder of the three-eyed race ordered.

“You want us to kneel in the Void?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows when he heard his words.

“The forces at the center of the universe are too powerful!”

“This… The Dragon Palace is in Big Trouble!”

Everyone on the nine annihilation planet had a drastic change in expression when they heard his words.

Only the domain Lord and the rest were watching quietly. They were a little puzzled. What were the Dragon King and the rest waiting for?

“Not good, eighth elder. Someone from the four-armed race on the right has ambushed us!”

However, at this moment, a sudden exclamation came from the three-eyed race.

A voice that no one had expected rang out.

The voice came from Mo Sha, who was on Yang Feng’s body.

His figure rang out beside the ears of the eight elders of the three-eyed race. The eighth elder was shocked and quickly looked to the right.

At this moment, the dagger in Mo Sha’s hand surged with violent energy as it directly attacked the eighth elder.

“You…”

The eighth elder felt the attack behind him and was greatly shocked.

However, the distance between them was only a few meters. A few meters was a distance of a level five divine emperor attacking a level six divine emperor.

Under the situation where he was caught off guard, he could not react at all.

He could only passively mobilize the energy in his body to protect himself.

“Pu!”

Mo Sha’s full-strength attack landed heavily on the body of the three-eyed race elder.

The powerful force caused him to fly backward. He spat out fresh blood and his entire back was pierced through.

“What!”

Everyone from the three-eyed race was shocked and looked at this scene in disbelief.

Why did deacon Yang Feng suddenly attack the eighth elder?

Even everyone from the four-armed race was slightly shocked.

They looked over.

“PFFT!”

“Boom!”

But just as everyone from the four-armed race was stunned, the eight-armed race also moved.

He stared coldly at elder Ji in front of him.

A black dagger also stabbed towards elder Ji’s head.

At the same time, a millstone flew out from his interspatial ring. It was the five elements millstone.

The Five Elements Millstone, which contained the strongest attack, also struck towards elder Ji.

The sudden change shocked everyone.
