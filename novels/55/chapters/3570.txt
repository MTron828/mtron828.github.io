3571 3570 vibration! Sky Plant Demonic Beast destroyed! Go

The place that the Dragon Palace occupied had the saint rebirth tablet.

The Saint Rebirth tablet could resurrect dead creatures!

The Sky Plant Demonic Beast clan should have a similar paradise!

He looked at the waterfall and sneered!

Although all the peak experts of the Sky Plant Demonic Beast clan were killed, they were also resurrected!

As long as they were given sufficient resources, they would be able to return to their peak state again!

“It’s not that easy to resurrect!”

Wang Xian moved and immediately flew towards the waterfall.

Boom

The waterfall was extremely high and the depth of the water flow was extremely terrifying!

When Wang Xian flew over, the waterfall flowed backwards. The waterfall technique that was accumulated underneath was rapidly flowing towards the surroundings!

The water flow under the waterfall was flowing rapidly to the surroundings!

Very soon, there were no water stains at the bottom of the waterfall!

At the deepest part of the waterfall, there was a cave entrance at the lower half of the waist.

The cave entrance was about a thousand meters wide and was covered by a surge of energy!

However, at this moment, there were more than thirty races in the cave entrance!

Those seeds were emitting a luster. Above the races, there were illusory shadows floating in the air!

The illusory figures were flickering, and at the very front, the illusory figure was absorbing all kinds of energy to recover its incredibly weak body!

“Huh?”

At this moment, the illusory figure at the very front noticed the change in the waterfall, and his expression changed slightly!

“Clan leader, we’ve been discovered!”

At the back, the illusory figures also sensed it, and their expressions changed greatly as they spoke!

“Even if we are discovered, the defense of our grotto-heaven paradise will not be able to break through the defense without the offensive power of a universe overlord!”

Before the tribe leader could speak, a phantoms at the side spoke in a deep voice!

Whoosh

At the front, the tribe leader of the Sky Plant Demonic Beast tribe waved his arm and a universe AI flew towards him!

Whoosh

At this moment, Wang Xian’s figure appeared in everyone’s line of sight!

“I really didn’t expect that your sky-plant Demonic Beasts clan would have such a precious land. To think that you could resurrect so many creatures!”

Wang Xian came to the front of their sky-plant Demonic Beasts’paradise. Through the Azure Energy Shield, he could see more than 30 phantoms inside!

Below these phantoms were seeds!

Obviously, this was their way of resurrection!

However, they seemed to be abnormally weak.

“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, how dare you exterminate our Sky-plant Demonic Beast Clan? The Lords of our Angel clan will not let you off. Just wait for Your Demise!”

The Phantoms of the sky-plant Demonic Beast clan trembled and roared with a cold face!

“Hehe!”

Upon hearing his words, Wang Xian sneered, “The first to perish will be your sky-plant Demonic Beasts!”

“Hahaha, you want to destroy us? As long as we are still around, the sky-plant demonic beasts will not perish. You Are Dreaming if you want to destroy us!”

The leader of the sky-plant Demonic Beasts roared with a ferocious expression!

Although their sky-plant demonic beasts had been destroyed, they were not dead yet!

As long as they were not dead, the sky-plant demonic beasts would be able to return to their peak!

However, this time, it was a huge blow to the sky-plant demonic beasts!

Countless powerful disciples and countless resources had been plundered by the Dragon Palace!

Only when the Dragon Palace was destroyed would they be able to vent their hatred!

“Hehe, wishful thinking? Sky-plant demonic beasts, this is the price you have to pay to deal with our Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and the five elements millstone appeared in his hand.

He injected energy into the millstone and smashed it towards the defensive barrier in front of him!

Boom

A terrifying collision sound was heard. However, the attack of the five elements millstone did not break through the defense of the light barrier!

This made him raise his eyebrows slightly!

“You can’t break through the defense of our grotto-heaven paradise. I will watch as your Dragon Palace is destroyed!”

The leader of the Sky Plant Demonic Beast roared ferociously when he saw that the grotto-heaven paradise was able to easily withstand Wang Xian’s attack!

He opened the universe’s AI and immediately reported the situation on their side to the experts of the Angel Race and the Holy Dragon lineage!

This time, they were exterminated by the Dragon Palace because of the Holy Dragon lineage!

Naturally, they had to come and help them out!

“Hehe, do you really think that I can’t do anything to You?” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Wang Xian revealed a mocking expression as he looked up into the sky!

“Dragon King!”

An Lie’s figure appeared beside Wang Xian. He looked at the blessed land in front of him.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

An lie nodded and his figure disappeared instantly.

In the next moment, his figure disappeared and reappeared beside the leader of the Sky Plant Demonic Beast tribe!

“Hi, everyone, I’m in!”

An lie, who had entered, looked at them and greeted them with a smile!

At this moment, the leader of the Sky Plant Demonic Beast tribe and the rest, who were filled with hatred and anger, were staring at Wang Xian.

When they suddenly saw an lie enter, they were stunned!

What was going on?

How did he get in?

What the hell was going on?

Buzz

An lie quickly set up a demonic altar and disappeared. He came to Wang Xian’s side!

Soon, while they were still in a daze, an lie brought Wang Xian in!

“I’m in again!”

An lie continued with a smile on his face!

“You, you, you…”

The leader of the sky-planting demonic beasts and the rest looked at an lie who came in again. Looking at Wang Xian who came in, their bodies trembled violently!

“I will let your sky-planting Demonic Beast Race Perish First!”

Wang Xian stared at them and said with a face full of mockery!

“Soul Catcher!”

He waved his arm and performed soul catcher directly at the leader of the sky-planting demonic beast race.

The leader of the sky-planting demonic beast race, whose strength had dropped drastically, flashed and entered Wang Xian’s body directly!

All the information about him was transmitted into Wang Xian’s mind!

“No, no, no, give us a chance. We are willing to submit. We are willing. Don’t Kill Us!”

At this moment, all the experts of the sky-planting demonic beast race had completely collapsed!

When they were killed just now, they knew that they still had a chance to revive!

But now, once they died, they would really die!

They didn’t want to die!

The group of heaven-planted demonic beasts wanted to beg for mercy!

“What’s the use of having you guys?”

Wang Xian looked at them with disdain as he cast the soul capturing spell one by one!

Very soon, more than thirty shadows dissipated. This also meant that the heaven-planted demonic beasts were completely annihilated!

Wang Xian waved his arm and a surge of energy landed on the ground. The protective shield in front of him slowly disappeared!

He looked at a stone tree in the middle!

This stone tree was connected to the ground and was the core of this blessed land!

There were more than a dozen dazzling races on the stone tree. As long as the blood essence was injected into these seeds, they could be resurrected through these races after they died!

Wang Xian walked over to take a look. After confirming that he couldn’t take it away, he moved his body and flew to the side.

Here we go!
