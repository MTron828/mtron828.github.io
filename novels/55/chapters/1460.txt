Chapter 1461: 1461 will give my heart to you

Wang Xian was slightly speechless as he watched Feng Luan enter the Dragon Pool once again.

She would be stronger than him if she were to increase her level one more time.

“After this upgrade, it won’t be long before the Liuhai region is completely under the control of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire!”

A smile appeared on his face as he looked at Feng Luan’s figure.

“What happened, Little Xian?”

At this moment, a group of girls walked over and asked curiously.

“Nothing much. Feng Luan’s level has broken through!”

Wang Xian shook his head and looked at the fire divine dragon that was coiled on the pillar at the Dragon Pond.

“Fire Phoenix Dragon Seed. I wonder if it can allow the demon qilin clan to transform it!”

Wang Xian thought to himself.

“Dragon King, Miss Ling Jian ‘er asked Duan Jinming to send something over. She said that she must give it to you!”

At this moment, Prime Minister GUI was holding an exquisite box in his hand. He walked over and spoke to Wang Xian respectfully.

“HMM? Ling Jian ‘er asked him to send it over?”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned. He took the box with a stunned expression.

“HMPH, Ling Jian ‘er must have missed the handsome Wang Xian whom she hasn’t seen for two days. She might have specially made some delicacies for you and sent it over!”

A few girls looked over and rolled their eyes at Wang Xian.

“How could that be?”

Wang Xian shook his head. This was not an explanation. Based on his understanding of Ling Jian ‘er, she would not do such a thing.

“Open it and let us see what it is. Could it be a love letter?”

A few girls gathered around curiously and asked Wang Xian.

Wang Xian shook his head slightly and slowly opened the box.

However, the moment the box was opened, his expression changed drastically. He felt his scalp tingling and stared at the thing inside in disbelief.

“What is it?”

A few girls saw that Wang Xian was stunned and leaned over.

“This, this...”

“What is this?”

However, when Guan Shuqing and the rest saw the item inside, their faces turned pale instantly.

“Heart, Heart!”

Wang Xian’s expression changed as he stared at the beating heart. His expression kept changing.

A Heart, a beating human heart!

Beside the heart, there was a note.

Wang Xian looked at this thing and felt his scalp tingling. Why did Ling Jian give him a heart?

Furthermore, whose heart was this?

“Phew!”

Wang Xian took a deep breath and took the note from the box. He then opened it!

“I am my heart. This is for you, Xiao Xian!”

“I love you. I know you don’t love me, but I love you just like a beating heart!”

“You don’t have to worry. I’m not dead and I’m not in any danger. However, from today onwards, I no longer have a heart!”

“I want to start another life. Goodbye!”

Four lines of words. It was a very simple word.

“F * ck!”

When Wang Xian read the four lines of words, he could not help but curse. His expression was extremely ugly.

“What’s wrong, Xiao Xian?” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

When the group of girls saw Wang Xian’s expression, they revealed anxious expressions.

It had been a very, very long time since they saw Wang Xian so angry and embarrassed.

The last time, Guan Shuqing was severely injured and on the verge of death. The last time, Xiao Yu was severely injured.

A few girls looked at him worriedly.

“I really didn’t expect her to be so extreme!”

Wang Xian handed the note in his hand to them with an embarrassed expression. He was breathing heavily as he spoke.

“This... this... how could ling Jian ‘er... how could a person without a heart...”

When the few girls saw the words on it, their faces turned pale.

Give My Heart to you?

Just thinking about it made them feel a little terrified!

Wang Xian came to the seat of the Dragon King’s palace with a gloomy face. He sat on the Dragon Chair and stared at the beating heart with an expressionless face.

It was very strange that the heart was still beating.

Without a heart, it was impossible for a person to survive unless he had reached the realm of longevity.

Obviously, Ling Jian ‘er did not have the ability to do so.

However, her heart was indeed beating.

What the F * ck!

Wang Xian’s face turned darker and darker when he recalled his condition when he met Ling Jian ‘ER.

Speaking of which, Ling Jian ‘er was an extreme person and had a weird personality since her father chased her out of the house after her mother’s death.

It was only after she confessed to Wang Xian and sect leader Ling brought her back to the sect that her personality improved a little.

Especially after he said that she was too cold and needed to be more lively, her character improved a lot.

However, there was one thing that could not be concealed. Ling Jian ‘ER had not recovered from the trauma of her childhood.

If Wang Xian accepted her, she might have recovered. However, she had not accepted him for the past half a year.

It ignited her previous emotions.

“I’ll go to sect leader Ling’s Place!”

Wang Xian stood up and said to the few girls as he flew towards the main hall.

The few girls exchanged glances and followed behind him immediately.

The main hall was only about 100 kilometers away from here. With his speed, he arrived very quickly.

“Sect leader Ling!”

Before Wang Xian arrived at the main hall, he saw sect leader Ling leading his men and flying into the distance with a gloomy expression.

He moved and appeared in front of them.

“Brother Wang Xian, have you seen my daughter? Have you seen her?”

Sect leader Ling asked anxiously when he saw Wang Xian.

This was a huge loss of composure for the big shots in the Liuhai region.

“Sect leader Ling, I received a letter from Ling Jian ‘er, so I rushed over immediately to ask!”

Wang Xian didn’t dare to tell him what was on his mind. He asked with a solemn face.

“She said that she wants to cultivate the heartless sword principle. She wants to leave this place and start a new life. If I forget about her daughter, she will also forget about me. The heartless sword principle!”

Sect leader Ling said in a fluster.

“The heartless sword principle? What heartless sword principle?”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned and asked.

He had heard of the heartless sword principle when he was on Earth. Ao Jian had also cultivated the heartless sword principle back then.

“It’s this, it’s this. This is what Jian ‘er obtained by chance in the demi-human graveyard back then. Other than the heartless sword principle, there was also a terrifying golden glow. Jian ‘er said that the golden glow was the gold of origin and the gold of origin had been absorbed. She had never cultivated this heartless sword principle!”

“After she threw this heartless sword principle to me, I took a look and threw it into my interspatial ring!”

As sect leader Ling spoke, she passed a palm-sized rock to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian took it and immediately felt a terrifying sword intent coming from it. Following that, a resolution was transmitted!

“Heartless sword principle, the number one killing sword in the universe. After mastering it, you will reach the pinnacle of power. No one in the nine heavens can match you!”

“The heartless sword principle starts from forgetting one’s feelings. Dig out your own heart and Forge Your Sword Heart. Your Sword Heart Is...”

A resolution surfaced in Wang Xian’s mind, causing him to take a deep breath.

“Use all the powers of the dragon-phoenix Empire and the Liuhuang Alliance to search for it!”

Wang Xian said with an embarrassed expression.
