As Wang Dahai nagged, Wang Xian gave a funny look. After bathing, Wang Dahai changed his clothes and made a few poses in front of the mirror.

“Not bad. Even though I’m slightly plump, my features are perfect, giving off a sense of security.”

Wang Dahai looked into the mirror as he was satisfied with his look.

“Will this work this time? Don’t get disappointed again!”

Wang Xian looked at him and chucked. Wang Dahai had an experience of dating a girl from the internet. In the end, the petite girl left after seeing him.

“There’s hope this time! I’m sure!”

Wang Dahai’s eyes brightened up. “I met this girl before. So, I’m not afraid that she will run away after she sees me.”

“All right, let’s go!”

Wang Xian laughed as he went down with Wang Dahai.

“Give me the keys. I’ll drive you!” Wang Dahai told Wang Xian.

“Eh, your motorcycle was damaged by me. So, I bought another one!” Wang Xian smiled and said.

“Damaged?”

Wang Dahai was stunned and shouted at him, “If you’ve damage it, just let it be. Why do you still have to buy another one? Look, you should have told me earlier. I have two at home. Why did you have to buy one?!”

Wang Xian felt warm in his heart. Wang Dahai said these things because he knew about his family situation.

Wang Dahai’s family was so-so and was considered to be middle class. They were not of high status, but neither were they poor. With a sum of $3,000 monthly allowance, it was considered an average amount.

“Let’s go. I’ll show you a new bike.”

Wang Xian arched his lips slightly as he brought him to the back of the dormitory.

“Wow, Harley. It’s the Harley motorcycle. This is my dream heavy duty motorcycle. I’ll get one when I’m rich!”

Wang Dahai brightened his eyes as he stared at the Harley motorcycle with an envious look as soon as he was at the back.

With a face full of smiles, Wang Xian took the keys and walked up. “Do you want to try?”

“Sigh, I can only look at it. This Harley costs at least a few hundred thousand. I wonder who the rich guy is who put it here. Envy... If tonight...”

Wang Dahai was talking with a face full of regrets. However, his face stiffened up as he spoke. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

He saw Wang Xian take out the key, unlock the bike, and push it out.

“Gosh! Old Wang! Brother Xian! This...this...”

Wang Dahai looked at Wang Xian with astonished expressions.

“What’s the matter? Look at my dressing. Don’t I deserve this bike?”

Wang Xian smiled and pointed to his clothes as he put on the flashy sunglasses kept in the motorcycle.

“Givenchy. Givenchy’s clothes! It’s authentic. Old Wang, did you win some lottery?!”

Wang Dahai had just noticed the brand on Wang Xian’s clothes. He jumped immediately, shocked.

“There is one thing that I have never told you. I’m actually an affluent second generation in disguise. I can inherit the family’s assets now since I’ve turned 20.”

Wang Xian joked with a smiling face.

“Really? Didn’t you have only one sister? “Wang Dahai seemed to buy his words as he looked at him.

“Let’s go. You just have to know that I’m not a pauper anymore.”

Wang Xian beckoned him and asked him to sit at the back seat.

“Gosh, this is so cool! “Wang Dahai rubbed his palms together as he got excited. “Can I try it too?”

“You can ride around the school. But you can forget about riding it in the city center. You don’t have a license!”

“That’s true. But you got to let me enjoy it during the normal days!”

“Get lost, enjoy my ass!”

“Brother Xian, you’ll be the big brother from now on. I’m Xiao Hai!”

Wang Xian started the engine and rode to the city center with Wang Dahai.

As soon as Wang Dahai entered the mall, he began to shop.

The reserved Wang Dahai even bought a pair of golden rimless glasses. What a flashy look!

Wang Xian looked at him speechlessly. “Looks like you really took a fancy to the girl tonight!”

“She’s the true love of my life. Brother Xian, tonight is the night!” Wang Dahai patted Wang Xian on his shoulder.

“It’s still early now. Where are we going?” Wang Xian looked at the time.

“Let’s go back. I want to dress myself up, then recharge myself in an internet cafe!”

Wang Dahai was full of fighting spirit.

Wang Xian followed Wang Dahai back to the dormitory helplessly. After they rested for a while, they came to the internet cafe.

In the evening, Wang Dahai called the girl, but the girl asked him to wait.

Wang Xian asked if the other party would stand him up tonight.

Wang Dahai patted his chest and said she would never do that. In fact, the later they met, the better.

Wang Xian could not figure out his train of thought. But when it was 8 pm, the girl called him.

“Let’s meet at the school entrance!”

“Let’s go. Haha. 8 pm! Let’s have fun tonight!”

Wang Dahai had shiny hair with exhilarating expressions all over his face.

“It’s so late. Where are we going at such an hour?” asked Wang Xian speechlessly.

“The pub, of course.”

Wang Dahai raised his eyebrows. “Let’s go. We’ll take the Harley motorcycle, and the remaining three ladies can take a cab.”

“All right, let’s go!”

As Wang Xian arrived at the entrance with Wang Dahai on the bike, the three trendy-looking girls were standing there.

The three girls were all in mini-skirts. One of them even wore a pair of black stockings.

Temptations in the air.

“Rongrong, this is my roommate, Wang Xian. We’re heading to the place on our bike. The three of you will share a cab. Is that okay?”

He spoke with a smile. As soon as Wang Dahai saw them, he hopped off the bike before he came to a girl whose face was round.

“Sure, then I’ll see you at the pub.”

“Sure, I’ll get you a cab before we leave!” said Wang Dahai with smiles all over his face as he acted like a gentleman.

The other two girls next to them observed Wang Dahai before they turned and looked at Wang Xian, who was on the bike.

“It’s here. Three beautiful ladies, you may leave first. We’ll wait for you at the entrance.”

As soon as the cab arrived, Wang Dahai spoke with a smile.

“Sure, we’ll meet you at the pub entrance.” The girl named Rongrong waved to him as she sat inside.

“Rongrong, is he Wang Dahai? He’s fat. But his roommate is quite handsome!”

“Yes, that’s him. I turned him down yesterday. But he kept pestering me to hang out with him. Since we’ve got nothing going on today, let’s go out and get high!”

“Then let’s enjoy ourselves today. I saw them riding the Harley motorcycle. They should be quite loaded. Let’s have a feast today!”

“I’m telling all of you in advance. Don’t get yourselves drunk like the other day.”

“No, we won’t.”

“That roommate of his is handsome. Do you want to seduce him later on?”

“Damm you, I’ve got a boyfriend!”

The girls were laughing and chatting in the cab.

“Charge! My life happiness depends on today!” Wang Dahai sat on the bike and yelled at Wang Xian excitedly.

“Fine, for your happiness. Charge!”
