“Father, I heard that the Tiger Chaos Demon Country and Dragon Palace have invaded our Xing Hua planet, what exactly happened there?”

Within the planet where the three seas gate was located, the vast ocean took up most of the area!

Within a palace at the bottom of the ocean, when the three seas gate leader flew over from the undying country hidden in space, Ji Shao Jian’s expression was dark as he walked over and asked his father!

“Peng!”

However, just as he finished speaking, a terrifying energy landed on his head!

The huge energy didn’t show any mercy, his neck split open, Ji Shao Jian stared wide eyed, filled with fear!

“Sect leader, young master...”

Around, some of the three seas sect warriors saw and immediately rushed over in Panic! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“It’s all because of you trash, Xing Hua Planet has been destroyed by the Dragon Palace Dragon King. That Dragon King is now an undying Level 7 warrior, an undying level 7 warrior!”

“Next, our three seas gate might be destroyed by you trash!”

The Three Seas Gate leader roared with a savage expression!

If it wasn’t for the arrogance of his trash son, he wouldn’t have provoked the Dragon King!

How could the three seas sect have suffered such a heavy loss? !

As a result, planet Xing Hua had been directly destroyed, and the fate of the three seas sect was unknown!

“Quick, notify all the members of the three seas sect immediately. Tell them to come over immediately!”

The sect master of the three seas sect roared with a ferocious expression!

“Yes, yes!”

The expressions of the surrounding experts of the three seas sect changed drastically!

“How could this be, how could this be!”

Ji Shaojian stared blankly at his extremely brutal father, struggling to stand up!

Weng

At this time, he saw his AI tremble, when he saw the contents of the AI, his pupils shrank!

“Xing Hua planet was destroyed by the Dragon Palace Tiger Chaos Demon Country, it’s said that the Dragon Palace Dragon King destroyed the planet with one claw!”

“Yesterday, the Dragon Planet made a statement, Xing Hua Planet hired people to destroy the planet, today, the Dragon King Tiger Chaos Demon Country’s old imperial advisor led a million troops to attack and destroy Xing Hua Planet!”

“The Dragon King may very well be an undying god King Level 7 warrior, right now that Dragon Star is simply too powerful, destroying Xing Hua Planet!”

The news of Xing Hua planet being destroyed quickly spread throughout the entire star South Galaxy, when everyone heard about it, their faces were filled with shock!

A glorious commercial planet was destroyed just like that, the three powers had no way to resist at all!

The strength of the Dragon Palace and the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom was also beyond everyone’s expectations. The statement they made yesterday would make Xing Hua pay a heavy price today!

“Did the Dragon Palace and the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom warn the ninth-grade heavenly sect yesterday that they would take revenge on the ninth-grade heavenly sect differently?”

At this moment, some people raised a question!

However, everyone scoffed at this question. No matter how powerful the Dragon Palace and the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom were, they could not destroy the commercial planet of the ninth-grade heavenly sect!

Many people treated this question as a joke!

However, what the Dragon Palace and the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom did today shocked everyone!

Not long after, another piece of news came. The Dragon Palace led the experts of the Dragon Palace directly into the three seas gate planet, and all the experts of the three seas gate fled in Panic!

Once this news came out, it caused another uproar!

Last time, the sect master of the three seas gate personally sent experts to attack the Dragon Palace, but in the end, only the sect master fled alone!

This time, when the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace led the experts to attack, the three seas sect immediately fled!

Everything was because of that extremely arrogant disciple of the three seas sect!

For a time, Ji Shaojian became a celebrity in the southern star system. After all, it was a kind of ability for him to destroy the powerful three seas sect alone!

“He escaped?”

At this moment, Wang Xian was hovering above the planet of the three seas sect, scanning the ocean below!

All the core disciples of the Three Seas Gate had fled the planet. The ones left behind were the old, the weak, the sick, and the disabled. They had little to do with the three seas gate!

They were trembling as they stood below, looking up at the experts of the Dragon Palace in the sky!

“Dragon King, the ocean of this planet takes up about 90% . It is very suitable for our Dragon Palace!”

Prime Minister Gui looked at the planet below and said!

After all, the Tianze continent didn’t completely belong to the Dragon Palace. This ocean planet was more than ten times better than the Tianze continent!

After all, it was a planet that had been occupied by a powerful force for tens of millions of years!

“Take this planet away and let’s go back!”

Wang Xian nodded and said to them!

“Dragon King, leave it to us, the Devouring Dragon!”

Ao crab and the rest nodded and immediately entered the ocean!

“Roar!”

Soon, the entire planet started to move. Wang Xian smiled and followed them to the Dragon Planet!

...

After placing the planet not far from the Dragon Planet, Wang Xian transferred the main Dragon Palace of the Tianze continent to this place!

“Dragon King, the tiger turmoil demon kingdom has arrived!”

After two days of busy work, Prime Minister GUI came to report!

“Yes, I’m on my way!”

Wang Xian nodded and returned to his Dragon Palace on Dragon Star through the Dragon Palace!

“Dragon King!”

The leader of the chaotic Tiger Nation, the old National Master, and the national master cupped their hands respectfully to Wang Xian!

After witnessing Wang Xian’s strength, they felt a little more respect for the Dragon King!

The Dragon Palace’s strength was several times stronger than theirs!

“Yes, everyone. The reason I called you here is mainly because of the demon Slayer sect. Have you found out anything recently?”

Wang Xian looked at them and asked directly!

...

During the two-day migration of the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian did not know anything about the outside world!

“Dragon King, we have also sent people to the planets under the ninth-grade heaven sect. There is no movement from the ninth-grade heaven sect now, but the demon Slayer sect is still active in their territory!”

The King of Chaotic Tiger Nation spoke!

“Is that so? It seems like they don’t put us in their eyes at all!”

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly!

“Dragon King, I don’t think the three seas sect, the Jianhua Group, the Black Forest Group, and the demon Slayer sect will give up just like that. Shouldn’t we take some precautions?”

The old National Advisor pondered for a moment and said!

“Of course. Have the Jianhua Group and the Black Forest Group made any moves yet?”

Wang Xian asked!

“The two big groups are on full alert and haven’t made any moves yet. However, if we want to deal with them, they will be able to react in time!”

The old National Master said with a slightly solemn expression!

Not dealing with them was, after all, a problem in their hearts!

It was impossible for the Dragon Palace and the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation to be willing to destroy their commercial planet!

“Since the ninth-grade heaven sect ignored us and refused to give us an explanation, we shall give them a warning!”

Wang Xian sat on the dragon throne and said coldly!

“HMM? Dragon King, what are you thinking?”

The chaotic Tiger Nation’s leader asked in surprise!

“Since their people attacked our dragon planet, we shall return them!”

The corners of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly as he said coldly!

“Alright, since there are so many lice, we won’t be afraid of them biting us. We can either keep a low profile or establish our prestige!”

The old National Advisor also agreed with him!
