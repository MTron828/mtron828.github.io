2650 He had a breakthrough in his strength of 26

“Master!”

Bei Shuang’s voice rang out. When she saw Wang Xian, she restrained the arrogance on her body and revealed a smile. She flew to Wang Xian obediently and greeted him respectfully!

“Yes!”

Wang Xian looked at her and revealed a faint smile on his face!

“What!”

However, at this moment, two young men who were supported by two middle-aged men in the air saw this scene and revealed a shocked expression!

“Master? That young man?” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

His eyes were wide open, and his face was filled with disbelief!

How could this young man be bei Shuang’s master?

Could This young man be the leader of the Dragon Palace?

Di Haofang’s face was filled with uncertainty. This was something that he had never expected!

Yesterday, when he learned about bei Shuang, he was slightly stunned and immediately checked!

What he didn’t expect was that the girl he had suppressed back then, the one who was shining like a meteor, the one who had fallen like a meteor, had risen once again!

And she was even stronger than before, even more heaven defying!

With an undying emperor level 8 battle power, this made him extremely shocked!

However, what he also didn’t expect was that the one who had brought bei Shuang back to the Pinnacle was actually that youth!

The youth who wanted to use his status and power to trade for the immortal slaying gourd

Looking at the words covered in frost in front of him, his expression was extremely ugly!

“That bei Shuang is actually so powerful? She was the heaven’s favored daughter from 30,000 years ago. Back then, she suppressed everyone in the Emperor Star Field, didn’t she already die?”

“She only fell silent because she didn’t have a door. It’s said that in the past two years, she had a master that brought her back to her peak. She also had an undying king level 8 battle strength. Many people say that she has the potential to become an emperor!”

“Hiss, I didn’t expect that heavenly daughter to be so terrifying now. That youth is her master?”

“Dragon Palace Dragon King, Undying Level 8 warrior, the leader of a powerful force, he looks young, but he’s not as simple as he looks!”

“The frost goddess with the emperor’s talent, is she that powerful? It’s been so long since anyone with the emperor’s talent has appeared!”

Around, some warriors saw this scene and discussed in shock!

Bei Shuang had once shaken the entire region more than 30,000 years ago. Now that she had returned with such strength, she had made an expert of the imperial court lose a great deal of face by toying with her!

Such strength had shocked many people!

Even the few elders of the imperial court looked at bei Shuang deeply and looked at Wang Xian who was beside her!

“Has everything been resolved?”

Wang Xian sensed the gazes around him and asked bei Shuang without paying any attention to it!

“It’s settled, Master!”

Bei Shuang nodded her head!

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian looked at di Xingnu beside him and said with a smile!

“Alright!”

Di Xingnu smiled sweetly and nodded her head!

The three of them flew straight towards the direction of the grassland!

“That young man is actually the leader of the dragon palace, bei Shuang’s master, and the leader of the forces on the Di Xingnu List?”

Below them, a group of women raised their heads in shock!

The woman in the snow-white dress also frowned slightly, and her eyes revealed a trace of solemnity!

She had learned a little about the Dragon Palace yesterday, and it was considered a relatively strong existence among first-rate factions!

According to her guess, with the Imperial Star Maiden’s strength and status, even if she had some status in the Dragon Palace, she couldn’t be too high!

However, she didn’t expect that the leader of the Dragon Palace would come with her personally!

That wasn’t the most important thing. The most important thing was the disciple of the Dragon King, the Frost Goddess!

After listening to the comments of the experts of the imperial court, she knew a thing or two!

“If she’s really powerful, she might have to be careful!”

The woman in the snow-white dress murmured!

“This imperial star girl is really going to rise!”

The other young men and women also thought to themselves!

With the support of a powerful force, they knew an expert with the potential to become an emperor!

Many of them were far weaker than her!

“She must be kept by that young man!”

Some jealous women whispered!

“I have to go back to the courtyard to settle some matters. Star Lady, Call Me Tomorrow!”

...

Wang Xian went back to Di Xingnu’s house and said directly!

“Alright. Where’s sister bei Shuang? Do you want me to bring you around?”

Di Xingnu nodded and asked!

“No Need!”

Bei Shuang shook her head at her!

Wang Xian entered the room and closed it immediately!

He sat cross-legged on the bed and took out pills one by one excitedly. His eyes were sparkling with excitement!

I’m going to break through. It’s much smoother than I thought

He mumbled to himself. This trip was really worth it!

Gulp

Drops of pills were put into his mouth and quickly converted into Dragon Energy!

...

Boom

Half an hour later, his body shook and a majestic aura gushed out from his body!

Wang Xian immediately retracted his aura!

Ding! “Congratulations to host for your upgrade. Your cultivation has been upgraded to Immortal King Level 3!”

The system’s voice sounded. Wang Xian slowly opened his eyes and a seven-colored divine dragon was swimming in his pupils!

“Immortal King Level 3, Immortal King Level 9 combat strength!”

Wang Xian stood up slowly, and the seven-colored divine dragon in his pupils slowly dissipated!

“Phew, I’m one step closer to the peak of the resplendent starry sky. When I return this time, the dragon palace can be comparable to a great sect!”

Wang Xian mumbled!

“Oh right, I wonder what’s going on with the immortal-slaying Calabash!”

Wang Xian recalled that the immortal-slaying calabash grew directly on the ancestral tree. He immediately sensed it with his mind!

“Eh?”

Through his senses, the immortal-slaying calabash was entangled by the branches of the endless wood and the nirvana lightning tree. There were two more streams of sword qi surrounding the Green Calabash!

One was a stream of flaming sword Qi, and the other was a stream of lightning sword qi!

Together with the Green Wind Sword Qi, the sword qi revolved around the immortal-slaying calabash!

The power of the immortal-slaying calabash had not changed for the time being. However, it had changed from one stream of Sword Qi to three streams!

“This immortal-slaying calabash can be located at the position of the ancestral tree. It’s not simple. I’ve picked up a treasure again this time!”

Wang Xian muttered to himself as a smile appeared on his face!

This time, it could be said to be a double blessing!
