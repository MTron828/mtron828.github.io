“What’s wrong with the old man from the Heaven Formation? We have already taken care of him.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

At the bottom, all the abyssal seeds had been eliminated.

In the sky, the battle was still ongoing.

Mo Sha raised his head and looked up. He couldn’t help but shout.

“With the strength of the Heaven Formation, it shouldn’t be.”

Prime Minister Gui frowned slightly and said with a puzzled expression.

“Let’s go and take a look!”

Wang Xian was also a little surprised. In a battle of the same level, the Thorn Monsters formed by the Heaven’s formation could kill the opponent in a one-on-one fight.

It was a little strange that they still hadn’t finished off the opponent in a three-on-one situation.

Wang Xian didn’t rush into the battlefield. Instead, he went straight to the command platform of Dragon Peak.

“Dragon King, I’ve encountered an interesting abyssal seed. I’m going to capture it alive.”

When Tian Chen saw Wang Xian coming over, his eyes sparkled as he spoke.

“Oh? Capture it alive?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows as a look of astonishment appeared on his face.

“I’ve captured it!”

At this moment, an excited look appeared on Tian Chen’s face.

In the sky, the area that was covered by thorns spread out. The three thorny monsters had extremely sharp-looking bones wrapped around their bodies.

In the middle, there were nose, eyes, ears, and other parts that were wrapped around them.

“This peak-level immortal king abyss seed can actually split into so many parts? And it doesn’t seem to be seriously injured.”

Wang Xian looked at the parts of the abyss seed’s body curiously.

If the arm of a powerhouse was broken and there was life in it, it could indeed fly with one arm.

However, the person who lost his arm was equivalent to being injured. If a godly king was divided into tens of thousands of parts, it was considered a very serious injury.

Now, the body of this peak godly king abyss seed had turned into tens of thousands of parts. However, he did not seem to be injured after sensing it.

“It’s amazing. I’m going to study it. Dragon King, Let’s not kill this abyss seed for the time being. I’ll see if there are any unexpected gains.”

Heaven’s formation said to Wang Xian.

“Sure, tie it up and let’s go.”

Wang Xian nodded and instructed.

“It’s Dragon King!”

Heaven’s formation replied immediately. Then, he took out a jade box and placed the body parts of the human-shaped immortal king-level abyssal seed one by one.

“Great victory, Return!”

Wang Xian stood on the Dragon Peak and glanced at the surrounding disciples of the Dragon Palace. He shouted softly.

“Great victory, Return!”

Prime Minister Gui repeated loudly.

“Yes!”

All the members of the Dragon Palace responded excitedly. One by one, they flew towards the Dragon Peak and the horizon ruler respectively.

“Dragon King, the results and losses of this battle have all been completed!”

In less than an hour, Prime Minister Gui flew over and said to Wang Xian with a smile on his face.

“Tell me.”

Wang Xian nodded and said.

“If we lose anything, we have one immortal King Level 8, three level 7,15 level 6... A total of more than 700 immortal king level powerhouses have died. About 2,000 disciples below the level of God Lord have died and have been absorbed by the soul-returning wood.”

Prime Minister GUI said, “The number of disciples that have died is less than what we expected. Compared to the harvest, it is nothing.”

“This time, there’s one corpse of a peak immortal king level abyss species, 16 level 9 corpses, 55 level 8 corpses, 170 Level 7 corpses... 50,000 immortal king level and above corpses, and more than 300 million corpses.”

“This time, our Dragon Palace will receive a huge upgrade.”

As he spoke, his eyes were filled with excitement.

“The losses are within the range, the harvest is not bad.”

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly.

This time, he could increase the Dragon Palace by 16 immortal King Level 9 powerhouses. Adding the original 23, he could increase the total to nearly 40.

What did it mean to have nearly 40 immortal King Level 9 powerhouses?

A strong batch!

In addition, he could increase the number of peak immortal king level powerhouses by two.

As he thought of this, he looked to the side and saw that the heaven array was holding the skeleton of a human-shaped peak immortal king level abyss seed, studying something.

Wang Xian did not disturb him.

The Dragon Peak and the Heaven’s end ruler traveled quickly. Two days later, they returned to the center of the Demon Island.

...

“Enter the Dragon Palace for a comprehensive upgrade.”

Wang Xian gave an order to all his disciples and entered the Dragon Palace directly.

All the members of the Dragon Palace immediately entered the Dragon Palace.

“Dragon King, who shall be the first to break through to the peak of the Immortal King’s combat strength?”

When Wang Xian and the rest came to the front of the dragon transformation pool, Prime Minister Gui asked.

“Let ao Qitian do it.”

Wang Xian pondered for a moment and said.

Although ao Yao’s improvement was very useful, her assassination ability was strong. In a head-on battle, she was much weaker than the berserk dragon species.

If there was another Abyss War, AO qitian would be more suitable for such a battle.

“Sky Array, how’s Your Research on the Pinnacle Undying God King Abyss seed coming along?”

He looked at the sky array beside him.

...

Over the past two days, the sky array had been studying this thing.

“Dragon King, I have an idea. I plan to turn The Pinnacle Undying God King Abyss seed into a biological armor, a biological armor that can raise one’s strength!”

Tian Chen pondered for a moment before speaking.

“Oh? Biological Armor?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Dragon King, after becoming an array grandmaster, one can be called a shaman. Of course, a shaman at the void God Emperor level can only be called a junior shaman.”

“In the past, the reason why I was betrayed by my disciple and was besieged and even killed by the Witch Association was because I obtained a shaman spell book back then.”

“Formations are used by shamans to connect to the world, and the world is also used by shamans to change their bodies.”

“Powerful shamans carve formations into their bodies to increase their bodies and connect to the world. According to the knowledge in that Shaman Spell, this peak undying godly monarch abyss seed is a very good material. It can not be said to be a material, as long as it is slightly modified, it can become a biological armor.”

As Heaven’s formation spoke, his eyes shone with wisdom.

“What will the result be?”

Wang Xian pondered for a moment and asked him.

“Dragon King, the combat strength of this peak-level immortal king abyss seed far surpasses that of the same level. In a one-on-one situation, even the thorny objects formed by my formation are no match for it. Its combat strength is very strong. It is not worth it to use it to improve a member of the Dragon Palace.”

“After it’s made into a biological armor, it can fight freely. Its combat strength is the same as before, it can also be worn.”

“For example, Dragon King, you can directly make the biological armor attach to your body, your strength will stack with the biological armor’s own strength.”

“This is like a special machine weapon, even if a small God makes the biological armor recognize its owner, it can still unleash the pinnacle undying emperor combat strength.”

Sky Array said.

“Oh? That’s much more suitable than using it to upgrade the disciples of the Dragon Palace. How long will it take for the modification to be completed?”

Wang Xian was slightly surprised.

“It will take some time. Also, Dragon King, I would like to ask you for two treasures, the incipient sacred wings and the eternal embryo fruit.”

Sky Array said.
