Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“Mum, Xiao Wei couldn’t make it as he is being held up at home,” said Sister Li as she walked very quickly towards her mum. She held on to her mobile phone, and was not looking very good.

“Just what is going on? Your dad has already told him yesterday that we will have the wedding in Rivertown and we don’t even need the wedding car. We are having the ceremony right here and now, shouldn’t he just show up, at the very least?”

Aunt Zhang stood up with an awkward look and said, “Our relatives will be here any moment, are we going to tell them that the groom is busy and couldn’t make it? Who would buy this story?”

“Mum, Xiaowei wished to be here as well, it’s just that...”

“I understand, it’s his parents, they’re... sigh, let’s forget it.” Holding onto her frustration, Aunt Zhang raised her palms and did not utter a single word.

Sister Li sat at the side, looking displeased as her eyes turned red.

Wang Xian and Xiao Yu witnessed the whole incident and frowned. This brother-in-law was just too much.

“Xiao Li, please welcome the guests in at the front door. Xiao Yu, you shall help her out as well.”

About half an hour later, Uncle Zhang walked in, and he knew what had happened. Looking displeased he said, “Let’s manage what’s here and not be bothered by the rest.”

“Yes, Uncle Zhang.” Xiao Yu stood up and nodded.

“I will help to welcome our guests in as well,” Wang Xian said happily as he stood up.

“All right, we’re counting on you kids.” Uncle Zhang thought as he nodded that his son-in-law did not live up to his expectations. Fortunately, he was proud to show that he had a promising nephew.

Everyone here had a huge sense of pride.

That included Uncle Zhang.

Wang Xian, Xiao Yu, and Sister Li arrived at the hall of the hotel.

At the entrance, another family was also holding a wedding ceremony, right beside theirs.

Both the bride and groom welcomed their guests as they stood by the reception. Judging from their guests’ identities, they could tell that the families lived in Pengzhou and life could not be better.

“Uncle and Aunt-in-law, this way please!” Sister Li said with a smile as she saw her own uncle (second brother in her dad’s family) and his wife.

“Oh my, you look gorgeous today, where’s your boyfriend? Show him to your aunt-in-law,” The lady said as she walked into the front door.

“My boyfriend has yet to arrive as he is caught in a jam on the highway,” Sister Li expressed with some embarrassment.

“Oh, he should have come a day in advance. Anyway, I know you’ll be busy down here so I shall make my way in.” Sister Li nodded, looking awkward.

It was truly an embarrassment that her own husband was not present on their wedding day.

At this moment, another group of relatives had arrived. Sister Li welcomed them with a big smile.

Aunt Zhang also came to welcome each and every guest.

Xiao Yu also went up to welcome them with Wang Xian, who brought a smile.

“Oh my, you are really beautiful today.”

“Our Xiao Li shall be enjoying her new life with her new wealthy family, but you still have to visit your own family more often in the future!”

“Xiao Yu, I heard that you and your brother have won a fortune, is that true? Congratulations, and don’t forget about your neighbors!”

Xiao Yu showed some awkwardness as the group of adoring relatives and neighbors pulled her aside and bombarded her with questions.

“Oh yes, Xiao Li, where’s your future husband? I don’t see him anywhere.”

“He has yet to arrive as he’s caught in the traffic jam.” Xiao Li tried to explain boldly as she gave the look of embarrassment.

Some nodded, while some had their doubts but did not question.

The groom of the other wedding looked at them with a frown and said, “They are so rowdy!”

“Must be some villagers, such an annoyance. We shall have someone remind them to keep their volume down when our guests have arrived,” the bride replied with displeasure as well.

The groom nodded his head.

Wang Xian stood at a corner, watching people starting to present their monetary gifts, many of them in the form of cash, and he walked out of the hotel after notifying Xiao Yu.

He had left the money that he had withdrawn in his car.

As he walked out of the hotel, he saw a group of more than 30 neighbors alighting from a bus.

The bus was rented by Uncle Zhang to pick up the neighbors.

“Hey Xiao Xian, where are you going?” a neighbor asked with a smile.

“I need to grab something,” Wang Xian replied in their direction.

“Our Xiao Xian has just won a fortune, shouldn’t you be treating your neighbors to a drink?” asked a middle-aged man.

“We need to leave tomorrow, perhaps another time,” he replied. “I need to grab something, please excuse me.”

“Hmph! This fellow is so full of himself!”

That middle-aged man looked displeased as he felt that Wang Xian was treating them with a perfunctory attitude.

“I could not agree more. We went to his house yesterday. Clearly, he was at home, but he didn’t answer the door even when I shouted for him a couple of times.”

“This fellow thinks that he is capable enough to be ignorant; he’s definitely full of himself!”

“I agree, he is so insensible that he doesn’t give that respect to his elders,” the elder relatives whispered with criticism as they saw him walking away.

They were given the cold shoulder when they just wished to give that pleasant approach. Naturally, it sparked unhappiness.

“All right, let’s get going, he might not even come back to us anymore,” said a highly respected elder, as he led the group into the hotel.

Unknown to them, all that was spoken had been heard by Wang Xian.

“Hmph! Why should I give you all those benefits? I am well aware of those who treated me well, the rest is not my business.”

Wang Xian felt disappointed, but he did not argue with them.

As he arrived at the hotel’s parking lot, he took out the $660,000 in cash from his car.

He knew that Uncle Zhang was holding onto that pride, so he had to uphold that pride for him. He took the money and made his way back to the hotel.

“Oh, Xiao Li, why isn’t your husband here? I hope he’s not looking down on us.”

“That’s right, Xiao Li, that is so insensible of him for not showing up.”

“If he’s not going to show up for the wedding, I wonder what’s going to happen for the rest of your life. Sometimes, one may not be blessed with happiness even after being married to a wealthy family.”

Wang Xian heard all those comments made by the people surrounding her as he walked into the hotel.

Wang Xian knew those ladies who were talking, had some conflicts with Uncle Zhang in the past.

“These people, seriously...”

Wang Xian shook his head and frowned as he watched the embarrassed looks on Uncle Zhang and Aunt Zhang.

“Please excuse me, uncle, I would like to present my monetary gift.”

Wang Xian spoke as he walked towards the crowd. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Oh, Xiao Xian has come to present his monetary gift, over here.”

The middle-aged man made a path for him.

Wang Xian thanked him and made his way to the reception.

“How much are you presenting, Xiao Xian?” asked another middle-aged man who was accounting for the gifts.

“$660,000!”

Wang Xian put the pouch on the table as he replied, and took the stack of cash out.

“What? $660,000!”
