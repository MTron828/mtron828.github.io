Chapter 1265: 1266 five elemental spirit pearl

Translator: 5496903

When Wang Xian entered this space, his speed did not slow down at all. On the contrary, it was much faster.

The demon Lin Race had fire elemental energy. In the water, their speed was much slower than before.

“Hehe, you still want to escape?”

When Wang Xian saw that his dharma idol had disappeared and that his demon soul’s speed had decreased drastically, a mocking look appeared on his face.

He waved his arm and unleashed his combined battle skill, brilliant sun, at the demon soul once again.

“His speed, how can he still be so fast!”

When the demon soul saw Wang Xian charging in, he gritted his teeth and looked at the holes at the bottom of the sea. Then, he quickly dived in.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The power of the star explosion exploded behind him. The terrifying energy emitted a muffled sound at the bottom of the sea.

The Demon Soul that was struck by the power of the star explosion was once again inflicted with terrifying wounds on its body.

It entered a cave entrance. As it was more familiar with this area, it began to flee frantically.

“Do you think you can escape after entering the cave entrance?”

A hint of mockery appeared on Wang Xian’s face. His eyes flickered with a demonic luster. Looking at the shadow in the cave entrance below, he waved the demon-free sword in his hand toward the bottom of the sea.

“The gold-piercing sword!”

The Demon Soul, who was fleeing desperately at the entrance of the cave, instantly sensed a powerful attack coming from above. Its expression changed drastically.

“How the F * CK is this possible? How did he know that I was in this direction?”

The Demon Soul’s expression changed drastically. It opened its huge mouth and its sharp teeth went straight for the gold-piercing sword.

The physical body of a Demon Beast was dozens of times stronger than that of an ordinary human. In a situation where humans did not use weapons, humans were at a disadvantage when they were at the same level.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

However, just as it stopped to block one of the attacks, a rain of even sharper sword attacks came at it.

The expression of the demon soul changed drastically. It gritted its teeth and took two attacks head-on.

“If I were to use the Earth’s mantis of four attributes at this moment, would I turn the demon soul inside into dust?”

Wang Xian looked at the demon soul that was struggling crazily in the cave. He hesitated for a moment but decided not to use it.

If the demon soul was really killed by him in one strike and turned into dust, he wouldn’t be able to receive the reward of 100,000 spiritual liquid from the mercenary group.

“Since that’s the case, let’s turn into a Divine Dragon!”

Wang Xian didn’t want to waste any more time with the demon soul.

Boom

However, just as Wang Xian was about to turn into a divine dragon, a terrifying flame was emitted from the cave.

Wang Xian was slightly shocked. He quickly looked over.

“What is this?”

Suddenly, his eyes revealed a fiery glow as he stared intently at the area below.

Five fire spirit pearls that contained terrifying flames were hovering around the demon soul. Waves of Majestic Flames entered its body.

“Five spirit pearls. Furthermore, they have five attributes of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. What a strong fire energy. Each of them is at least at the second level of the void interpretation stage. Furthermore, there are five of them!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were burning with passion. Five spiritual pearls, and they were at least at the second level of the void interpretation stage.

These five spiritual pearls were different from individual spiritual pearls. When the five spiritual pearls were linked together, it was obvious that they were a treasure formed from five spiritual pearls.

“The five elements are mutually reinforcing. The energy of the other four spiritual pearls is used to enhance the power of the fire spiritual pearl. This is very obvious for the use of the five elemental spiritual pearls. Even so, the energy of the five elemental spiritual pearls can also increase the strength of the demon soul by a lot!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were burning with passion.

Five Elements Spirit Pearl. Furthermore, it was a five elements spirit pearl of the second level of the void interpretation stage.

Wang Xian currently had five Dragon Pearls. The highest level of the Dragon Pearl was only at the eighth level of the extraordinary stage. To him, it was completely useless.

However, if he could obtain these five elements spirit pearls, after a long period of nurturing, he would be able to obtain five dragon pearls of the second level of the void interpretation stage.

The Dragon Pearl was the true divine weapon of the Divine Dragon.

It could greatly increase the strength of the Divine Dragon.

“Damn it, it actually forced me to reveal this treasure!”

The fire soul’s expression was extremely unsightly at this moment. If it wasn’t at the critical moment of life and death, it would absolutely not take out this treasure.

It was originally an ordinary demonic beast of the demon Lin clan, but because of a great opportunity, it allowed him to enter the main hall of the blood stream sect and obtain this treasure. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Using this treasure to cultivate, its cultivation speed was five times faster than before.

It knew how precious this treasure was. Even if the emperor of the demon Qilin clan were to see it, he would snatch it away.

Therefore, it didn’t dare to expose itself. This time, if it wasn’t for that despicable human, it would still be hiding.

“This treasure formed from the five elemental spirit beads not only has a powerful supporting energy, but it also has a terrifying defensive ability!”

Wang Xian was flying in the sky. Looking at the fire soul below, he attacked again.

The attacks were densely packed. This time, he didn’t unleash his full strength.

An attack followed by an attack.

“This won’t do. That human can sense me from above!”

The demon soul gritted its teeth. The five elemental spiritual beads on its body emitted terrifying flames and floated above its head.

It dashed out forcefully from the hole in the bottom of the sea and flew into the distance.

“Let me tell you, don’t even think about escaping from me!”

Wang Xian immediately chased after it. Various combinations of combat techniques were launched at his body.

“Roar! Roar! I, the demon soul, swear that I will tear you into pieces in the future and make you my food!”

The five elemental spirit pearl above his head provided him with an endless stream of flames. His speed had doubled.

Wang Xian chased after him and flew at high speed.

“What’s going on? What happened? Oh My God, that’s the Demon Soul King Beast. There’s a human behind it. That human is actually chasing after the Demon Soul King!”

“What did I see? Oh My God? Why is the Demon Soul King being chased by humans? You have to know that the Demon Soul King is an invincible young man in the Demon Beast Clan!”

“Is that a heaven’s pride of the humans? Impossible... how could there be such a young powerhouse among the humans!”

The Demon Soul ran for its life while Wang Xian chased after it.

Along the way, some of the demon beasts who had gone through training saw their Demon Soul King Beast, a heaven’s Pride King Beast, the strongest powerhouse among the younger generation. They were shocked to see that they were being chased by a human.

This was the Demon Soul King. In the Demon Beast clan, it was known as the Most Outstanding Demon Beast in a thousand years.

Now, he was being chased by a human?

“The exit is in front, the exit is in front!”

The Demon Soul’s entire body was filled with terrifying scars. Looking at the 5,000 meters ahead, it was the exit. A strong sense of vitality shot out from his eyes.

“The exit is in front. I have to leave him behind. Even if he turns into dust, as long as I can obtain the five elemental spirit Pearl!”

Wang Xian saw that the exit of the demonic beast training ground was in front of him. His eyes slowly revealed killing intent.

“Demon Soul, you forced me to do this. Go and die, Earth’s death!”

Wang Xian shouted softly. Four types of terrifying energy emitted from his body. The energy interweaved and covered the area in front of him.

Earth’s death, a four-elemental supernatural ability!

Wang Xian’s strongest attack!
