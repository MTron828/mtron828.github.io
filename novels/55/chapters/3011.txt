Chapter 3012: slashed thousands of times

“Boom Boom Boom!”

“Hualala!”

The terrifying attack that blotted out the sky and covered the entire area below. The grayish dragon claws were entangled with chains. The terrifying attack covered the 13 level 7 divine emperor powerhouses.

These powerhouses from the two large tribes were filled with fear and shock when they faced Wang Xian’s attack.

“Defend, Defend!”

They unleashed their trump cards with fear.

The three-eyed tribe leader who was enveloped by the undead.

The four-armed tribe leader who was protected by four huge hands.

The three-eyed tribe leader who was fleeing frantically.

There was also an old man from the four-armed tribe who was enveloped by a golden palm.

“Bang!”

The huge palm landed and a dull force caused the entire Void to explode.

“Ahhhhh!”

Miserable cries sounded out as the bodies of the rank seven God emperor experts began to collapse.

“Oh no, we are not his match at all!”

The three-eyed race elder looked at the tribesmen and the four-armed race experts beside him as their bodies slowly collapsed. Many chains pierced through their bodies, and he revealed a horrified expression.

“Death Spirit Substitute!”

The leader of the three-eyed race shouted with an extremely embarrassed expression.

“Bang!”

In the next moment, the death spirit in front of him entered his body directly. The Eye of the death spirit in his hand entered the center of his brows.

His body trembled slightly.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

The chains penetrated his body one by one and rapidly eroded his life force.

However, at this moment, a black glow, which was like a black hole, disappeared instantly.

Wang Xian swept his gaze over there. His eyes were sparkling!

“AH, Buddha’s Golden Palm, receive me into the Buddhist Kingdom!”

At this moment, a violent roar came from below.

Wang Xian swept his gaze over. The four-armed race expert who was protected by the Golden Palm saw the golden palm collapse. A golden swastika flew out from his body. The swastika contained the shadow of a huge hall. His body moved and entered directly.

The three-eyed man and the four-armed man had escaped!

“They are indeed capable!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze over and was not too surprised.

It was normal for such an expert to have some tricks up his sleeves.

“However, all of you shall die!”

Wang Xian’s five elemental dragon claws were covered in chains. He completely crushed the other eleven level seven celestial thearch experts.

“No!”

Screams of agony rang out as the level seven celestial thearch powerhouses lost their vitality completely.

“No, no, no, how could this be? How could this be? !”

“The clan leader, Grand Elder, protector, and the rest are all dead!”

At the back, everyone from the two large tribes saw this scene. Their eyes widened and their faces were filled with astonishment.

Their bodies trembled as they watched this scene.

The two large clans had joined forces and searched for more than half a year before they found the entrance. They had originally thought that they would be able to harvest a large number of inferior dragons.

They had even fantasized about obtaining a huge opportunity.

But in the end, it turned out to be such a situation?

They were basically here to throw their lives away!

“Break the array formation and escape!”

A tier six divine emperor elder shouted sternly.

“Run, run, run!”

“Run!”

A terrified voice rang out. In an instant, tens of millions of people fled frantically in all directions.

“The Dragon Palace has no enmity with you, yet you want to destroy us. You can only blame yourselves!”

Wang Xian looked at the experts from the two large tribes who were in a state of panic. His body trembled slightly.

“Perish in the river of time!”

Wang Xian’s body trembled slightly. He slowly raised his palm and transformed it into a gigantic dragon claw.

With a wave of his arm, a grayish destructive energy engulfed the tens of millions of people who were fleeing in a frenzy.

A long river of annihilation appeared and engulfed all of them.

The Terrifying River of time swept past. At the front of the river, the experts had all perished in the river of time. All their vitality had vanished.

“No!”

Some people were filled with despair when they saw the river of time sweeping towards them. They were resisting with all their might.

However, the gap between them and Wang Xian was too huge!

Now that Wang Xian was able to kill an expert at level eight of the celestial thearch in an instant, what could they do to defend themselves?

The river of time swept past quickly. Tens of millions of people were drowned, leaving behind only corpses.

All the experts of the two large clans were annihilated.

Other than the three-eyed clan leader and one expert from the four-armed clan who escaped, the rest were all left here.

A murderer should have this kind of awareness.

This was a race war, and there was no right or wrong.

“Hiss, so strong. That young man is so strong. He single-handedly wiped out two large clans. This… this…”

At the same time, at the back of the two large tribes, more than a dozen people who had been following them saw this scene. Their faces were filled with shock.

“That expert is a rank eight divine emperor. Furthermore, there’s a rank seven divine Emperor Magus who set up a formation in advance. This three-eyed tribe and four-armed tribe are simply courting death!”

An elder in the middle could not help but roar in a low voice.

“I didn’t expect there to be such a powerful expert hiding here.”

They said in a slightly shaken voice.

“Not good, that expert is looking in our direction. Run!”

Suddenly, they sensed that terrifying gaze looking in their direction, and the dozen or so people were filled with shock.

Although they were all rank 6 and 7 divine emperors, they were still filled with fear when faced with an expert who could wipe out two large races.

The dozen of them did not hesitate and fled back to their divine kingdoms in an instant.

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the dozen of them. There was no fluctuation in his gaze.

“Dragon King!”

The Heaven Array flew over at this moment. His eyes were filled with excitement.

“Let’s collect these corpses. The harvest is pretty good.”

A faint smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face.

Although the two major clans had invaded the Dragon Palace many times and wanted to destroy it, they had also brought a huge amount of resources to the Dragon Palace.

This time around, there were more than 20,000 celestial emperor corpses. There were more than 10,000,000 celestial king level-six and above.

Such a huge amount of terrifying resources could allow the Dragon Palace’s strength to increase tremendously.

“It’s the Dragon King. After this battle, our Dragon Palace should be able to enter the eyes of some factions in the center of the Universe!”

Sky Array said.

“After absorbing the resources this time, with the strength of our Dragon Palace, we are considered not weak among the forces in the center of the Universe!”

Wang Xian smiled and said.

With such strength, it shouldn’t be too difficult for them to protect themselves.

Those forces that wanted to attack the Dragon Palace also had to consider whether it was worth it.

Moreover, they had yet to finish exploring the ruins of the Mohan clan.

Once they were done, the Dragon Palace should be able to obtain another upgrade.

“Let’s go back!”

Wang Xian was in a great mood and returned to the Dragon Palace immediately. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Prime Minister Gui, get all the members of the Dragon Palace to prepare to increase their strength!”

Wang Xian instructed immediately after returning to the Dragon Palace.

“Dragon King, did you exterminate two large clans?”

Prime Minister Gui’s eyes were filled with excitement.

Wang Xian nodded his head lightly.

“We need to be prepared to enter the center of the Universe!”
