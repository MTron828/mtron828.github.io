Chapter 2896: 2,896 might of the Dragon Palace 3

The glazed domain was also known as the largest domain of humanity.

It was also the strongest domain of humanity.

The entire glazed domain had more than 30 God emperors.

The strongest force of the glazed domain, glazed domain, had more than 20 God emperors.

Resplendent and glorious!

It was the best description of the glazed domain.

The strength of the glazed domain was related to the two large domains that were adjacent to it.

One was the chimei domain, and the other was the machine emperor domain.

The chimei domain didn’t live in the human world, but in the demon world.

The Machine Emperor Domain lived in the robot world.

These two great domains were enemies to the human world, and the glazed domain often had conflicts with them.

Only in battle could the strong be stronger.

With the foundation of the glazed domain and the constant battle training, there were a lot of strong people in the glazed domain.

“HMM? is the news true? Does the dragon palace really have a purebred wind god Dragon?”

In the center of the glazed domain, the most powerful force was also known as the number one in the brilliant starry sky, glazed.

In a large hall, several elders were sitting inside.

An elder asked in surprise.

“The news is true. A picture came. Even if it’s not a purebred wind god dragon, it must be a powerful dragon with unlimited potential.”

A middle-aged man beside him replied.

“A dragon God. I didn’t expect a dragon God to appear in our area.”

An old man sighed slightly.

“How about the Dragon Palace?”

The old man in the middle asked with a twinkle in his eyes.

“According to the information we received, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace basically doesn’t do anything. The ones who manage the territory are his women.”

“In short, he’s a wise ruler. The Imperial Star Field is very peaceful now and the people are in favor of him.”

The middle-aged man continued to report.

“That’s good. We can’t have any more evil rulers appearing. It’s also good that the Witch Formation Association is destroyed!”

A few old men nodded slightly.

“Forefather, is there any trouble in the chimei region?”

The middle-aged man in front of him asked with a frown.

“Some of the summoned demons and devils have returned!”

The old man in the middle said with a serious face.

“What? All of them are back? Why are all the summoned demons back?”

The middle-aged man was slightly surprised and couldn’t help but exclaim.

The old men shook their heads with a serious face.

…

In the Machine Emperor Domain.

“Lord Creator, we connected our technology to the artificial intelligence of the imperial star field and found pictures of the Divine Dragons. According to our analysis, 70-83% of the nine divine dragons are pure wind divine dragons.”

In the highly developed mechanical imperial region, all kinds of spaceships were shuttling around a metal planet.

At the center of the planet, a golden figure was sitting high on the throne.

In front of them, more than ten silver-colored robots with wings were kneeling in front of them and reporting respectfully.

“I already know. You guys can leave now!”

The golden voice sounded emotionless.

He was the creator of the mechanical imperial region, the ruler of all the robots.

The robots had their own intelligence and powerful creativity.

However, they didn’t have the ability to reproduce. The birth of the robots depended on energy and metal.

And all the robots that were born obeyed the creator’s orders 100% . A single thought from the creator could kill a robot.

“Dragon God, that’s a race at the peak of the universe. I really want to get a dragon God for research. Unfortunately, the Dragon Palace has already become a success.”

The golden figure’s eyes were flashing with messages. He sat on the throne and muttered.

…

“Roar Roar Roar!”

In the dark starry sky, countless ferocious monsters were roaring in the void.

In this deep void, there were countless terrifying demon caves. Each demon cave was bottomless.

These demon caves seemed to lead to another world.

This was the chimei territory.

If Wang Xian came here, he would definitely recognize these creatures.

Demonic Creatures!

At this moment, in the center of the Chimei territory, a large number of demonic creatures flew out from the demon caves.

Their bodies were filled with the scent of blood. It was unknown how many creatures they had killed.

…

Wang Xian did not know about the commotion in the outside world.

After more than a month, the matters in the Heaven Wizard region were basically settled.

After he established the Dragon Palace on some key planets in the Heaven Wizard region, he was finally done with his work.

The members of the Dragon Palace who had been busy for a month had basically returned.

Today, in the Dragon King Palace of the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian held a feast to celebrate the victory of this battle.

In order to celebrate, the Heaven Wizard territory was under control. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Dragon King, the Heaven Wizard territory has basically stabilized. Next, the members of the Dragon Palace will be able to receive a huge improvement!”

Prime Minister Gui sat at the leader’s seat on the right. Beside him were the leaders of the Dragon Palace who were at the level of celestial thearch.

“Alright, all of you will enter the dragon transformation pool to increase your strength.”

“It’s been hard on all of you during this period of time!”

Wang Xian nodded. He raised his wine glass with a smile and gestured to them.

“It’s our duty to serve the Dragon King and the Dragon Palace.”

The leaders of the Dragon Palace replied happily.

“Old Wang, we have been in closed-door cultivation for a few years. In the end, we might as well enter the dragon transformation pool to increase our strength. No, we have to increase our strength as soon as possible and go out to play. We have never gone out to play since we came to the resplendent starry sky.”

On the left, a group of girls were sitting there.

Hua Er and Cai’er had been in closed-door cultivation ever since they came here. Now, they had the strength of a level-eight master God.

However, a level-eight master god was the weakest among them in the Dragon Palace.

“Alright, Alright. This time, all of you will enter the dragon transformation pool and advance to the peak of the king God Realm.”

Wang Xian smiled and swept his gaze across them.

His younger sister, Xiao Yu, and brother-in-law, Feng Lingtian, the group of girls, Hua Er Cai’er, his disciples, Xiao ran, and bei Shuang.

Ling Xiu was the only one who was not around.

He had also sent the Heaven Formation to search for her for a long time, but they could not find her.

As long as they could find Ling Xiu, everything would be perfect.

After three rounds of wine and three rounds of dishes, he had five different tastes.

After having dinner with the leaders of the Dragon Palace and chatting with the group of girls, Wang Xian came to the front of the dragon transformation pool.

At this moment, the inside of the dragon transformation pool was filled with dragon blood.

The resplendent dragon blood emitted a vast amount of energy.

The disciples of the Dragon Palace were inside to increase their strength.

The sky array was also sitting cross-legged in the center. He was absorbing the dragon blood while looking at the various secret manuals on witchcraft that he had obtained from the Treasure Vault of the Witch Formation Association.

The energy of a wizard’s corpse was sufficient to allow him to recover to his peak and surpass his peak self.

The Dragon Wizard’s level was very high. Currently, he could only fight two levels above him. When he mastered more spell formations and more wizard skills, he would be able to fight three levels above him.

This possibility was very high according to the Heaven Spell Formation.

According to his own guess, he might be able to reach a new level this time.

“It’s time for me to improve myself. The resources in my hands are sufficient!”

Wang Xian looked at the treasures in his interspatial ring and smiled.
