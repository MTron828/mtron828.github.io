Chapter 785: 0786 continued to fight

Translator: 549690339

“Hiss, a fight to the death!”

“A fight to the death? That disciple of the Dragon Gate wants to fight to the death? This...”

“His cold face and emotionless voice. A fight to the death. This young swordsman is so terrifying!”

“Now, does Yuwen Hua dare to fight to the death with him?”

“If Yuwen Hua doesn’t make a move, then the entire Yuwen clan will lose a lot of face. Especially just now, Yuwen Hua pointed at the Dragon King’s sister and told him to get down, or else he would kneel down and apologize!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

All the disciples of the immortal sect looked at this scene in shock. They looked at the platform of the Yuwen clan, waiting for their response.

At this moment, Yuwen Hua’s face kept changing. He stared at the Golden Swordfish on the ring with a gloomy face.

He really did not dare to engage in a life-and-death battle.

Especially when he was facing an expert who was also at the peak of half-step immortal God realm.

He did not dare to guarantee that he would win.

And once he lost, what awaited him was death.

As the Most Outstanding Heaven’s pride disciple of the Yu Wen clan, as the most dazzling young expert in the pugilistic world, he did not dare to gamble!

He did not dare to use his own life to fight in an arena battle.

“If you don’t dare, kneel down and apologize!”

Xiao Yu saw the changing expression of Yu Wenhua on the Yuwen clan’s platform and felt very relieved. He said with slight ridicule.

Kneel down and apologize!

This was what Yu Wenhua said to Xiao Yu towards the Dragon Gate not long ago.

If he did not dare, then kneel down and apologize. But now, Xiao Yu returned this sentence to him!

“You...”

Yu Wenhua almost vomited blood when he heard Xiao Yu’s words. He stared at him with slightly red eyes and his body trembled slightly.

The immortals and gods of the Yuwen clan also looked extremely embarrassed.

“This doesn’t give the Yuwen clan a way out at all!”

“He doesn’t put the Yuwen clan in his eyes at all. He is simply offending them to the death!”

“The Dragon King really has no scruples!”

The group of disciples from the immortal sects exclaimed in their hearts as they watched.

“Dragon King, let’s spar normally!”

When the grand elder of the Yuwen clan saw this scene, he looked at Yuwen Hua and sighed in his heart. He said faintly.

“Your Yuwen clan’s disciple was taught a lesson for speaking without restraint. Now, another disciple has come to provoke us. Why are you cowardly now? If you don’t have the strength, don’t be so arrogant!”

Wang Xian looked at the supreme elder of the Yuwen clan and said expressionlessly.

Wang Xian’s words made all the immortal sects of the Yuwen clan turn pale instantly.

An immortal who looked similar to Yuwen Hua had a cold look in his eyes. He opened his mouth and was about to speak when the supreme elder waved his hand.

“Let’s spar normally. If Yuwen Hua loses, we will compensate him with a level-two formation. How about that?”

The grand elder of the Yuwen clan said to Wang Xian.

“Grade-2 Formation?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. Currently, the Dragon Palace needed ten grade-2 formations to upgrade to grade-2. Grade-2 formations were very important to him.

Moreover, the Yuwen clan had already regressed. If they did not relent, they might completely offend the Yuwen clan.

Although Wang Xian was not afraid of the Yuwen clan, there was no need to provoke such a strong enemy.

“Sure!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“Whoosh!”

“I will definitely defeat you today!”

On the platform of the Yuwen clan, Yu Wenhua flew off the stage with an embarrassed expression. He stared at the Golden Swordfish with a cold expression.

However, Yu Wenhua’s cold voice sounded extremely weak in the eyes of all the surrounding disciples of the immortal sect.

Just now, others had invited him for a life-and-death battle, but he didn’t agree. Now, he was just trying to hide his cowardice.

“Please Enlighten Me!”

The Golden Swordfish’s ice-cold Longsword pointed straight at Yu Wenhua.

“Enlighten me!”

Facing the Golden Swordfish, he didn’t dare to be careless. With a gloomy face, he moved his arm.

A yellow shield appeared in his left hand, and a Knight’s sword appeared in his right hand.

A shield and a sword were the most suitable for Earth elemental cultivators.

Earth elemental cultivators were best at defense.

“Traceless sword!”

The long sword in the Golden Swordfish’s hand instantly moved.

The swordsmanship of the Golden Swordfish clan all came from Ao Jian, which could be said to be the same lineage as Ao Jian.

The heartless sword principle focused on killing!

The moment he attacked, an invisible long sword directly attacked Yu Wenhua.

“Hmph, I’ll definitely defeat you today!”

Yu Wenhua’s eyes lit up. He raised the shield in his hand, and the traceless sword landed on the shield. The earthen yellow mist on the shield dispersed and blocked it!

“Earth-shattering!”

The earthen yellow knight sword in his hand swung forward, and a crack instantly appeared on the entire arena as he attacked the Golden Swordfish.

“Traceless, Slash!”

The golden swordfish leaped into the air as terrifying metal swords were shot out.

The terrifying sword radiance emitted a boundless radiance.

The entire arena was instantly covered in gold!

“Slash!”

All the golden radiance condensed into tiny metal swords as they fell towards Yu Wenhua.

“Sky High!”

Yu Wenhua’s expression changed slightly as he raised the Knight Sword and shield in his hand. An khaki-colored defense appeared around him.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

The terrifying sword light directly pierced through the earthen yellow defense.

When the continuous attacks landed on his defense, his expression changed drastically.

“Sigh!”

“Heartless sword, although it’s just a superficial attack, its attack power is also very terrifying. This child, among the same level, his attack power is unparalleled!”

On the Yuwen clan’s platform, the Grand Elder looked at the short exchange of blows on the stage and shook his head slightly.

The other Immortals and deities also had ugly expressions, especially one of the middle-aged immortals and deities.

“Our Yuwen Clan’s defense is very strong, especially when combined with the formation. Although our attack power can’t compare to the explosive attributes of fire, metal, and lightning, it’s not bad either. It’s a combination of offense and defense. However, faced with such a violent merciless sword, little hua is simply unable to win!”

An elderly immortal God’s eyes flickered as he spoke.

The supreme elder of the Yuwen clan nodded in agreement. Ruthless Sword. A thousand years ago, the strongest sword immortal, the immortal Slayer Daoist, used the power of the ruthless sword dao to suppress the entire jianghu. No one was able to receive his sword.

From then on, the ruthless sword was the number one killing sword. It was incomparably terrifying.

However, to cultivate the ruthless sword, one needed to forget, Sever, and be ruthless.

Emotionless, emotionless, emotionless, emotionless, emotionless, and merciless.

This was a kind of realm, and it was not a clever attack. However, this realm was very terrifying.

It would unleash the sharpest attacks, the deadliest attacks, and the most accurate attacks.

In the past, after the immortal Slayer Daoist had forgotten his feelings, in order to pursue the Dao of the sword, he had killed his family and almost destroyed the entire immortal sect. Since then, the Immortal Slayer Dao had declined a lot.

In just a few moves, the Yuwen clan knew that their disciples were going to be defeated!
