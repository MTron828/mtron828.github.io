Chapter 744: 0745 cursing under the city wall (2/5)

Translator: 549690339

“Ahhhh, I’m going to kill you!”

“This is too infuriating, this is too infuriating, you bastard!”

“I’ll remember you, I’ll definitely kill you in the future!”

“Are there any brothers who will rush over with me? I’ll kill that fellow today even if I have to die!”

“Everyone, don’t be rash, don’t fall for their tricks. Our immortal sect’s experts will come over immediately!”

Furious voices rang out one after another. The Disciples of the Chaos Origin Immortal sect on the city wall nearly lost their minds and rushed over.

The Yellow Heaven Immortal sect’s disciple’s taunts were filled with trash.

Also, he actually called them cowards and said that their chaos origin immortal sect was cowards.

A gentleman could be killed but not humiliated!

This was no longer a simple insult.

In an instant, dozens of people wanted to rush over, but were stopped by the people beside them. They could only listen to the ridicule with extremely gloomy faces.

Aggrieved, incomparably aggrieved.

However, they had no way at all. There were more than fifty terrifying experts who didn’t know the depth of their strength standing in a row.

There were also at least ten infant realm experts from the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect. If they went out, their fate would definitely be the same as that middle-aged man’s, dying miserably on the spot!

“Pu!”

A middle-aged man was so angry that he directly spat out blood and panted heavily.

The young man’s eyes lit up when he saw this situation, and a smug expression appeared on his face.

Behind him, the group of Dan realm experts who felt that they were completely useless were also itching to make a move!

“Cough Cough!”

The Dan realm experts from the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect and those who were half a step into the Dan realm all let out a shrill cry.

“Cowardly Turtle Immortal sect, since you dared to attack our crown prince yesterday, why don’t you even dare to come out of the city gates today?”

“This is the gate of your Hunyuan Immortal sect. You Don’t even dare to come out of your own home. Why are you still alive? Why Don’t You Die?”

“Trash, I’m talking about you. Why Are You Staring? Can your eyes kill me? Trash trash, come, come. If you have the guts, Let’s fight one-on-one?”

For a moment, the Yellow Heaven Immortal Sect’s Dan stage experts pointed at the disciples in the city and mocked loudly.

With thirty people joining, all sorts of mocking and disdainful words were heard in an instant.

That voice not only made the faces of the Hunyuan Immortal sect’s disciples outside the city gate angry, but also made their eyes bloodshot.

Even the Hunyuan Immortal sect’s disciples and family members inside the city who didn’t come over clenched their fists and wished they could rush out.

Humiliation, humiliation!

When had their chaos origin immortal sect ever suffered such humiliation?

And since they could not retaliate, how could they retaliate? Scold back?

If they really scolded back, then the other party would have even more reason to mock them.

They could already imagine that after today, they would become a disgrace to all the immortal sects!

A clown that was used as a joke by the other immortal sects!

Mo Qinglong smiled when he saw the Yellow Heaven immortal sect disciples cursing the city.

“It’s still very useful!”

Elder Feng smiled awkwardly and politely when he heard that.

Although it was awkward, he was very satisfied with the effect. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, on the main peak of the Chaos Origin Immortal sect.

Three immortal gods stood in front, looking down at the elders and deacons of the Chaos Origin Immortal sect.

There were a total of twenty-six people!

There were more than forty experts of the chaos origin immortal sect who were above the infant realm. Fifteen of them died yesterday, and another one died today.

The strength of the entire peak of the sect was directly lost by thirty to forty percent!

The three immortals stood on top with ugly expressions.

“Come, let’s go. I want to see who dares to block the city gate of our Chaos Origin Immortal sect apart from the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect!”

Supreme Elder Jin Gujia, who was standing in the middle, said with a gloomy expression.

“Let’s Go!”

The group of top-tier experts of the primordial immortal sect moved and flew toward the city gate.

However, before they reached the gate, they heard mocking voices.

This caused the three immortals of the primordial immortal sect to tremble, and their faces instantly turned extremely gloomy.

Those insults were simply an insult to them and trampling on them.

They, the Great Chaos Origin Immortal sect, had never suffered such a grievance before.

The top experts from the chaos origin immortal sect following behind were also extremely embarrassed. A terrifying dark cloud gathered in the sky.

The terrifying energy was already able to cause changes in nature.

“Grand Supreme Elder and sect leader are here. All the experts from our immortal sect are here!”

“The grand elder must kill that group of people outside. He must teach them a lesson!”

“Kill them!”

When the disciples of the Immortal sect saw the Immortals and experts of the immortal sect coming, their faces turned red as they shouted loudly.

This was the only time that the disciples of the immortal sect lost their minds and did not welcome the Grand Elder and the others!

When the three immortal gods heard the voices from below, their expressions became even more unsightly.

They stood in the sky above the city gate.

There were three immortal gods and more than twenty experts at the infant realm and above behind them.

“More than sixty infant realm experts!”

The three immortal gods of the Hunyuan Immortal sect swept their gazes over and immediately saw the strength of the one hundred people below.

More than sixty infant realm experts. When they saw the strength of this group of people, a hint of solemnity flashed in the eyes of the three immortal gods.

Especially those fifty nascent realm experts who were lined up in a row. They were not from the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect.

“Which faction are you from? You have participated in the matter between US and the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect. Do you know the consequences? You will have to pay a heavy price!”

The Supreme Elder of the Chaos Origin Immortal sect looked coldly at Mo Qinglong and the others. His voice resounded throughout the world!

“You dare to hurt our eldest princess? We Will Make Your Chaos Origin Immortal sect pay a heavy price!”

Mo Qinglong did not reply. At that moment, a cold voice came from the distant void.

Everyone was stunned. The noisy chaos origin city immediately fell silent. The disciples standing on the city wall looked into the distance in shock.

“Your eldest princess?”

Upon hearing the immortal God’s voice, the Chaos Origin Immortal Sect’s grand elder’s expression turned extremely ugly.

The middle-aged man next to him had a thought. The image of the girl appeared in his mind. His expression changed, and he immediately sent a voice transmission to the Grand Elder.

This caused a serious expression to appear in their eyes.

There was actually an immortal God level existence behind that girl!

That attack yesterday had caused their chaos origin immortal sect to have an enemy with an immortal God, and it was a powerful enemy from an unknown faction.

Clearly, the other party had already fought with the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect.

This caused the three immortal gods of the Chaos Origin immortal sect to have gloomy expressions on their faces.

All their efforts had been for naught. Not only had they failed to kill that kid yesterday, but they had also provoked a terrifying force!

“Our Chaos Origin Immortal sect does not intend to assassinate your eldest princess. Please forgive us if we implicate you!”

The sect leader of the Chaos Origin Immortal sect said in a deep voice, “I wonder how we can let this matter go!”

“When we have killed enough people, we will naturally stop!”

Ao Jian’s cold voice continued to be heard.

“Outrageous! Do you really think that our Hunyuan Immortal Sect is afraid of You?”

The Supreme Elder of the Hunyuan Immortal sect roared with an extremely embarrassed expression.

“Close the city gates. No disciples are allowed to leave the city for the time being. I want to see how long they can stand here!”

The middle-aged immortal God ordered with an extremely embarrassed expression.
