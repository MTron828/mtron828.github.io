“Father!”

“Sect master!”

Feng Lingtian and Feng Jinqing quickly flew into the main hall of the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect. When they saw their green figures leaning against each other, they immediately shouted.

Feng Lingtian tightened his tattered clothes and felt slightly awkward.

“Hehe!”

The middle-aged man slowly turned around and looked at his son. There was a teasing look in his eyes as he laughed.

“Father!”

Feng Lingtian looked at his father’s expression and his face turned red. He walked over and said, “Father, lend me your limitless green fan tomorrow!”

“What are you using it for? !”

The middle-aged man continued to laugh as he looked at him.

“Father, it’s not like you haven’t seen it!”

Feng Lingtian was slightly embarrassed and he gritted his teeth. “That little witch, Little Witch, she actually embarrassed me in front of everyone. I will teach her a lesson tomorrow and let her know how powerful her little master is!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Alright, even if I give it to you, you’re not her match!”

The middle-aged man looked at his son and said in amusement.

He had never been willing to hit his son once, but he had been taught a lesson twice by a little girl.

However, the middle-aged man did not mind. After all, he had been beaten up by a girl, and it was his own fault for not being good at learning.

Moreover, being beaten up by a girl might not be a bad thing for his future, and it could also make this kid lower his profile.

“How could that be? Father, lend me your limitless green fan. I can teach her a good lesson and let her know how powerful I am!”

Feng Lingtian clenched his fists tightly. His face was filled with the desire to take revenge.

“That girl already has the strength of a half-step immortal God. Even with the limitless green fan, you are still not her match!”

The middle-aged man shook his head.

“What? How is this possible? A year ago, she was still at the Infant Stage!”

Feng Lingtian immediately jumped up. However, when he thought about how easily he was beaten up today, his expression changed drastically.

“Furthermore!”

The middle-aged man raised his head slightly and looked ahead. “With the energy emitted from her body, even two or three half-step immortal gods might not be her match!”

“That girl should be stepping into the immortal God realm soon!”

“What the F * * k, no way, she’s about to step into the immortal realm... this, this, she looks even younger than me!”

Feng Lingtian’s scalp tingled and the corner of his mouth trembled. “Doesn’t that mean that I’ll never be her match in the future, and I’ll be tortured forever!”

The middle-aged man’s expression gradually turned solemn. “This girl is not simple, and the ten subordinates beside her are not simple either. I also feel that there are a few experts who are good at hiding around her, guarding her!”

“Gulp!”

Feng Lingtian could not help but swallow a mouthful of saliva. Even Feng Jinqing, who was beside him, had a shocked expression on his face.

“That Dragon King is not simple. According to his past behavior, do not make an enemy out of him!”

The middle-aged man said faintly.

Feng Jinqing nodded in agreement.

“Then doesn’t that mean that I will really bring her here to play tomorrow?”

Feng Lingtian’s face was full of tears. Whenever he thought of her, he felt as though a whip was whipping him. He could not help but tremble.

“Hehe!”

The middle-aged man laughed and his body slowly disappeared.

“Oh my God!”

Feng Lingtian cried out in grief and indignation.

The next morning, Feng Lingtian could only grit his teeth and head to the restaurant where Xiao Yu was staying like a wronged little wife.

He did not dare not to come. After knowing that she had such terrifying strength and was about to enter the immortal God realm, he had already changed from wanting to resist to fawning over the little devil, asking her not to beat him up in the future.

In the end, the people of Yellow Sky City saw their crown prince standing next to a young girl with a smile like a little puppy, taking her to eat all kinds of delicacies.

This caused everyone in yellow sky city to be astonished.

However, when they thought of what happened last night, the expressions on everyone’s faces were very interesting.

Their crown prince had really become a little slave.

And when Xiao Yu was touring the yellow sky immortal sect, a major incident happened in Jiang City.

This incident caught everyone in Jiang City unprepared.

Jiang city was no longer the same Jiang City as before.

The aristocratic families in Jiang city had also undergone some changes.

After the appearance of the nine cauldrons, all the martial artists in the Jianghu had basically joined the immortal sects.

A large portion of them had joined the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect, but the weaker Yellow Heaven Immortal sect didn’t take them in.

Most of the families in Jiang City were weaker and didn’t have the qualifications to join the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect.

Therefore, after the other immortal sects appeared, some joined the Ming King Immortal sect, some joined the puppet immortal sect, and some joined other immortal sects.

After each cauldron appeared, after four to five months of conflict, they tacitly agreed that one cauldron occupied a territory.

This caused Jiang City to belong to the sphere of influence of the yellow cauldron. Those aristocratic families that joined other immortal sects directly moved to other cities.

There were also warriors from other aristocratic families who had moved to Jiang City because they had joined the Ming King Immortal sect and the Puppet Immortal sect.

In short, the current Jiang City was no longer the former Jiang City.

However, there were still many former Jiang City worlds that were still in Jiang City.

This Morning, an invitation was sent to all the aristocratic families.

When they saw the words “Dragon Gate banquet,”many warriors were shocked.

“Dragon Gate Banquet, the Dragon King is back?”

“The Dragon King is back! The former king of Jianghu, the king of Jiangcheng, is back!”

Everyone was stunned as they looked at the invitation in their hands.

They were all former jianghu warriors. They had witnessed the rise and hegemony of the Dragon Gate and witnessed the domineering and Invincible Dragon King.

“What is the Dragon King doing inviting the aristocratic families and warriors of Jiangcheng? Announcing his return and declaring the sovereignty of Jiangcheng!”

“The Dragon King is back. Get people to prepare immediately. Let’s go on time today. The former king is back!”

“This is the world of the Ming King Immortal sect and the Puppet Immortal sect now. What does this Dragon King want to do? Does he want to compete with the Ming King Immortal sect and the Puppet Immortal Sect? This is simply wishful thinking!”

“The former king is, after all, the former king. He has become a thing of the past. What more does this Dragon King want to Do?”

“I have to admit that the former Dragon King of the Dragon Gate once suppressed the entire jianghu until they couldn’t breathe. But now, it’s too far away from the immortal sect!”

The eyes of the warriors of the aristocratic families who received the invitations were shining.

In the world where the immortal sect was now the king, there were probably not many who could recognize the former Dragon King of the Dragon Gate.

There were even many warriors who disdained him.

At this moment, in the temporary base of the puppet immortal sect, Jiang City, about ten disciples of the Puppet Immortal sect stood in a room with despair on their faces.

Around them, several elders sat there with gloomy expressions on their faces.

In their territory, someone actually dared to cripple their ten disciples!

They deserved to die!
