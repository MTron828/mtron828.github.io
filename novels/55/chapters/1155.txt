Chapter 1156: 1157 was a slap in the face

Translator: 5496903

Bright Moon City was bustling with people, vehicles, and members of the mercenary group riding fierce beasts.

Everything seemed prosperous and peaceful.

Ao Yao stood at the top of a five-story tall restaurant, looking down like air.

His gaze was locked on the master of Undercurrent, a powerful warrior at the profound void realm.

The master of undercurrent was wearing a bamboo hat today, which revealed his mysteriousness.

There were not many people in Bright Moon City who were dressed like this, and no one paid attention to them.

When they stopped, ao Yao immediately took out the communication stone plate and sent a message to Long Yi and the others.

The members of the Dragon Palace were not as intelligent as those wild beasts and fierce beasts. Their intelligence was even much higher than that of ordinary humans.

In the past, the civil officials in the Dragon Palace had taught them a lot.

Their intelligence was not lower than that of humans of the same level. In fact, they were even stronger.

After sending the message through the communication stone plate, Long Yi immediately received the message and immediately sent it to the spy.

When the spy received long Yi’s message, he was slightly stunned and immediately walked further away.

According to Long Yi’s instructions, he immediately sent a message to the undercurrent assassin who kept the interspatial ring.

“Let the leader of your undercurrent, the master of Undercurrent, die. You want to play with us? I hope he can have a good time!”

After he sent the message, he walked forward aimlessly. He had no idea that he was the spy of the dragon spike.

The undercurrent assassin was waiting for the appearance of the dragon Spike’s spy. When he saw the message, he was slightly stunned and his face immediately turned dark.

A dark expression appeared on his face.

He hurriedly reported this matter to the white-clothed old man.

“Leader, something has happened. We have been discovered!”

When the white-clothed old man saw the message, his expression darkened. He took a deep breath and reported to the master of undercurrent beside him in a low voice.

“What? We have been discovered?”

The old man’s words also caused the master of Undercurrent’s expression to darken. He stood there, his eyes flickering with a luster as a murderous aura slowly spread out.

“Go Back!”

He expressionlessly returned to the undercurrent’s base and looked at the white-clothed old man. “Think of a way!”

These three words were directly thrown onto the white-clothed old man’s face. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

This caused the white-clothed old man’s face to be filled with worry.

How did the dragon assassin organization know that that person was their undercurrent’s assassin?

How was this possible? They had concealed themselves very well, so how had they been discovered?

The white-robed old man was puzzled and felt a little helpless.

How were they supposed to find them? The other party was obviously a powerful assassin organization as well. Neither of them knew anything about the other party.

Where was he supposed to find the dragon spike?

“I’ve met my opponent!”

The white-robed old man took a deep breath and could only walk towards the city lord’s residence, hoping to obtain some information from them.

Another Day passed. Nothing major happened during the day.

As night came, the night was much brighter than before.

In Bright Moon City, many families and mercenary groups’bases were brightly lit.

The appearance of the dragon Spike and the assassination made many people apprehensive.

Many aristocratic families and mercenary groups activated defensive formations to prevent people from hiring the dragon spike to assassinate them.

However, what they didn’t know was that these formations were completely useless against the dragon spike.

They also didn’t know how powerful the dragon spike was in Bright Moon City.

“AH, not good, master has been killed!”

“Young master has been killed, it’s the dragon spike, it’s the dragon spike. They’re here, someone hired the dragon Spike to assassinate Young Master!”

Because many families didn’t have any rest tonight, the guards were patrolling non-stop.

And the sky hadn’t yet brightened. In the middle of the night, some families in Bright Moon City started to exclaim.

When some people around heard it, they looked to the side in fear.

“It’s the dragon spike. The dragon Spike is making a move again!”

“The dragon Spike is too powerful. In Bright Moon City, as long as they receive a mission, the target of the assassination will be 100% killed!”

“Didn’t the undercurrent assassin organization say to deal with Dragon Spike? Didn’t the master of undercurrent say to kill all the assassins of dragon spike? What’s going on? Dragon Spike is still carrying out the mission!”

In the middle of the night, some family members and members of the mercenary group were talking to each other.

They looked at each other with some surprise in their eyes.

Dragon Spike was still carrying out the mission. Then, could it be said that the words of the master of undercurrent that day were simply slapping his own face?

“Damn, the members of the Dragon Spike assassin organization have posted the news in the Bright Moon City Forum Again!”

“The dragon Spike’s mission tonight has been completed. where is that trash, the undercurrent master? Didn’t they say that they wanted to kill the assassins of our dragon Spike?”

“The Dragon Spike assassin organization is simply a blatant provocation. They are definitely going to take down the undercurrent assassin organization!”

“This is too much of a slap to the face. That afternoon, in front of tens of thousands of people, the master of undercurrent directly said that he wanted to eliminate dragon assassin. Now, this slap to the face is really painful!”

“Right now, I want to know the expression of the master of undercurrent. This is a blatant slap to the face. If the master of undercurrent did not retaliate, it would be a huge loss of face!”

“It’s not just a loss of face. His entire undercurrent assassin organization can forget about mingling in star-moon kingdom!”

At this moment, the people who had been awakened in the forum saw the message dragon Spike had posted, and they all replied below.

Here, they were not afraid of the master of undercurrent, and the master of undercurrent would not be able to discover that they were speaking ill of undercurrent, so they replied without the slightest scruple.

This time, if the master of undercurrent and the others did not respond, they would really be slapping themselves in the face!

Time slowly passed, and the Sun gradually rose. The information in Bright Moon City’s discussion also became more and more fervent, and soon, the replies reached several million.

When it was morning, almost the entire Bright Moon City knew about the dragon Spike’s provocation to the undercurrent master.

“Is there any information from the city lord’s residence? Dragon Spike, within three days, I must have him die!”

When the master of undercurrent saw the dragon spike mocking him on the Bright Moon City Forum, his eyes were completely covered in blood. He suddenly turned his head to look at the white-clothed old man and growled in a low voice.

“Leader, don’t worry, don’t worry. They might have coincidentally discovered it yesterday. Let’s try again today. If they still discover it today, we still have a way. We still have a way!”

The old man in white hurriedly said with a face full of fear.

“Okay!”

The Master of undercurrent turned his head, and his long hair once again covered his eyes.

“Interesting, really interesting. It’s been a long time since I’ve met an opponent!”

After a full five minutes of silence, the master of Undercurrent’s somewhat hoarse voice was heard. There was a hint of excitement and madness in his voice.

“Sir, as long as we have the city Lord’s mansion to help us, we will be in an invincible position. The dragon Spike will only be arrogant for a few days!”
