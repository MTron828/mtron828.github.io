Chapter 607: Yong Chang’s Supreme Talents

All the disciples of the three major Yong Chang Immortal Sects gathered around in the contest arena at this time.

As a rare once in millennium event, every disciple was present.

Even those average disciples who had not advanced to Inborn were looking for a spot to observe the battle between top-notch Yong Chang talents.

Hundreds of thousands of disciples from three major Immortal Sects looked at that middle-aged man in the middle of the stage. All of them were discussing in astonishment.

His name was Roving Sword, the scary genius of swordsmanship from Immortal Slaying Sect.

Roving Sword was categorized as middle aged in the real world, but a young man in Yong Chang.

Seeing that he defeated Yonglin, third-ranked in Yong Chang Immortal Sect, all the disciples were in disbelief.

Yong Chang Immortal Sect was the strongest sect among the three Immortal Sects. In terms of the numbers of Immortals and supreme talents, it was almost better than Da Hong and Immortal Slaying Sect.

The fact that Roving Sword of Immortal Slaying Sect could defeat Yonglin, the supreme talent of Yong Chang, surprised everyone.

“You lost!”

Roving Sword, on the stage, remained aloof without any expressions on his face. Despite defeating the supreme talent of Yong Chang world, he remained as calm as a millpond.

As a golden swordfish, he did not have much emotion except for that related to becoming stronger and pledging his loyalty to the Dragon King!

“I lost!”

Yonglin looked awful. He wiped his neck that was being brushed by sword radiance and flew to one corner with a sullen face.

Roving Sword turned around and flew to another place.

“Senior Brother Ao!”

As the disciples of Immortal Slaying Sect saw Roving Sword, they greeted him with awe.

“Mm!”

Roving Sword nodded coldly as though he was like a block of ice!

“I never expected Roving Sword to be so strong. Yonglin, didn’t you say you could beat him? What a shame!”

In the other direction, Yonglin, with fiery-red hair, landed on a small hill nearby.

Over a dozen disciples sat on the mountain with tea on the side.

Compared to other disciples who were standing around, watching, the place where these disciples were sitting seemed more relaxing.

“Hmph, didn’t he knock you off from the top candidate list of cultivating disciples?”

Yonglin returned a cold bellow as he grimaced at a young man who had a sharp chin.

“He’s still no match for me!”

The young man with a sharp profile spoke without any emotion. His golden palms were like metal.

“His strength could be ranked in the top five or six!” Hong Tianda commented impassively at the side.

“Five or six? I don’t think so!”

As soon as Hong Tianda’s voice trailed off, a Yong Chang Immortal Sect disciple curled his lips upwards and spoke with a smile.

“This guy is familiar, but he’s too aloof. I don’t like him!”

At this time, a female voice was heard as she observed with doubts.

However, her strength was only at the Inborn level. Since she was standing at a distance of six kilometers, she could not see clearly.

“Haha, Xiao Xiao, this fellow is even more aloof than Hong Tianda, ignoring everyone like a fool. He only has eyes for swordsmanship!”

A young man of Immortal Slaying Sect chuckled and replied to the girl.

“He’s expressionless? Sounds familiar. Where have I seen this before?”

The girl murmured, with her eyes blinking non-stop. However, she could not recall anything. So she might as well cast this aside, and she tugged another girl by her arm with a smile. “This time, my sister will top the chart!”

“Senior brother Ge Wen is number one. Senior brother Hong is number two and Senior brother Bai is number three. I’m at most number four!”

The girl who was being hugged shook her head plainly.

“No, how can those guys fight with you? Unless they are not men!”

The girl laughed as she spoke.

The surrounding crowd chuckled. Even though the girl was of Inborn Level, she was the youngest daughter of an Immortal.

The little princess of the entire Yong Chang world who received more doting than her sister.

“When the last day is here, I’ll teach that Roving Sword a lesson!”

A young man of Immortal Slaying Sect held his Level 12 spiritual sword with a face of coldness.

The sudden appearance of this guy not only stole his limelight in Immortal Slaying Sect, but also gave him the cold shoulder many times, which embarrassed him.

He was prepared to teach him a lesson.

“Haha, Jin Jian. If you can beat him, you will be ranked number five. By then, we won’t have to compete with each other anymore!”

Upon hearing his words, a disciple of Yong Chang Immortal Sect smiled and commented.

“Heh, then I want the fifth position!”

Jin Jian smiled confidently.

“Among the disciples, you’re only number six. I’ll fight with Ge Wen for number two!”

At this time, Hong Tianda, sitting at the side, remarked once again.

“Hur?”

Everyone around him froze for a moment as they looked at Hong Tianda with disbelief.

“Senior brother Hong, don’t tell me there’s someone better than you and Senior brother Ge Wen?”

A young man was stunned and asked this with a smile.

“Yes!” Hong Tianda answered directly.

“Who? Who actually makes you feel inferior? All the supreme talents in Yong Chang are here. Who is our opponent?” asked Ge Wen to Hong Tianda with his eyes narrowed.

“You’ll find out on the last day!”

Without much strength, he answered. Hong Tianda thought of a person who could easily defeat him in a single move.

He was not convinced of Ge Wen, but he had to succumb to defeat by that demon-like figure!

He touched the huge sword in his hand with self-understanding that he was still far from that demon-like figure.

“Oh? Then I will really want to take a look. At the same time, I will show you my strength!”

Ge Wen’s lips curled up slightly with a pleasant look in his eyes.

Ao Shuwen, at the side, remained quiet with glistening eyes. His mind was not here as he was thinking of the Dragon King.

For half a month, over a dozen families searched the entire Yong Chang world. Still, none of them retrieved any information on the Dragon King.

This made them wonder.

Yong Chang world is not big. How can a person suddenly appear?

But all these forces were not willing to give up and continued to look up.

With that Dragon King around one day, the dozen forces would not have a day of peace. They must slay him!

Besides, they needed to find out how he had managed to kill fifteen Budding Realm experts. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Buzz!

At this time, Roving Sword was standing in front of the Immortal Slaying Sect disciples. A thing on his arm buzzed. He swung his arm and took out the Positive-Negative Metal.

Looking at the message on it, Roving Sword did not hesitate as he flitted towards Da Hong Immortal Sect.

Some of the elders and attendants from Immortal Slaying Sect furrowed their brows slightly when they saw the departing Roving Sword.

“This disciple is extremely talented. He’s very suitable for Merciless Swordsmanship, but he was simply ruthless!”

“The Sect Leader said the Merciless Swordsmanship focused on attacks. But when one attains mastery of it, one can become truly merciless, disregarding and annihilating everything. Such a disciple might be hard to come across, but he was not easy to control. The Sect Leader also said he would be banned from entering Yong Chang cauldron this time!”

“It’s better to prohibit his entry. If he could advance to the Immortal Realm with Merciless Swordsmanship, I don’t think that even the Sect Leader could command him!”
