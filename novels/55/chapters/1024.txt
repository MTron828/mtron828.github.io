The dragon spike was coming! Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The old Butler’s eyes flickered.

According to what he knew, once the dragon Spike came, it would bring darkness, panic, fear, and madness!

“Daring to assassinate an expert at Transcendent Level 8, assassinate the Mayor of a town, assassinate the mayor of star-moon kingdom, this...”

The old man’s face was filled with shock.

Not to mention an expert at transcendent level 8, he was also a top expert in East Sea city.

As for the identity of the mayor, it was even more shocking.

Daring to assassinate the mayor was equivalent to going against star-moon kingdom. Even undercurrent did not have the guts to do so, yet this dragon spike actually dared to do so?

“Patriarch, something has happened. Something has happened to the snake family next door!”

At this moment, a middle-aged man suddenly ran over and exclaimed towards the people in the hall.

“What happened? What happened to the Snake Family?”

The old man frowned slightly and asked in surprise.

“All the members of the snake family have been killed. Family Head, please go and take a look!”

The middle-aged man said in shock.

“What?”

The old man showed a shocked expression and walked out with big steps.

The relationship between the snake family and the song family was quite good. Because of the close distance, the two families often interacted with each other.

How could they have been assassinated?

He was very clear about the strength of the snake family. There were three level 8 transcendents.

This was definitely a big family in East Sea city.

The old Butler’s expression changed slightly, and he made a guess.

The group walked out of the courtyard and hurried toward the snake family.

“Hiss, what’s This?”

When the group came to the door, the old Butler looked at the red paper on the door and gasped.

“What’s Wrong?”

The old man turned his head!

“That’s the dragon Spike’s congratulatory death. The snake family members were killed by the dragon spike. As expected, as expected, only the dragon spike has the strength to do so!”

The old Butler said with a face full of shock.

Everyone immediately looked over. There was a bright red wedding invitation stuck on the door of the snake family.

Looking at the bright red wedding invitation, everyone felt their scalps go numb.

This was a congratulations from the Grim Reaper!

It wasn’t just here. Everyone in the entire Eastern Sea city who knew something about the dragon spike stared at the red piece of paper with their mouths Agape.

The dragon Spike had arrived!

As for those who didn’t know about the dragon Spike assassin organization, they quickly received all the information about the dragon spike.

Those who could get the dragon Spike’s contact information were all well-known mercenary groups and families in Eastern Sea city.

They were very well-informed.

When everyone received all the information about the dragon spike, they could not help but suck in a breath of cold air.

Assassinating a level 8 transcendent, assassinating the mayor of bridge forest town, shocking all the towns under Eastern Sea City. Everyone had to have a serious expression.

However, not long after, a piece of news came.

The snake family had been wiped out by the dragon Spike!

Three level 8 transcendents and a group of Level 7 and level 6 transcendents were all killed in one night.

It was not until dawn that the people of the snake family discovered that they were dead.

When this news spread out, the entire eastern sea city was in an uproar.

“How is this possible? This is the snake family. Three level 8 transcendents and a protective array. How can they be destroyed? !”

“Oh my God, this is too terrifying. In one night, a large family in East Sea city was destroyed?”

“I heard that every place the dragon assassin organization went, they would assassinate a powerful force there to announce their arrival. But I never thought that they would directly destroy the powerful snake family!”

“In the next period of time, the entire East Sea city will be in Chaos!”

Upon hearing this news, everyone had shocked expressions on their faces.

An assassin organization that could easily destroy the snake family, an assassin organization that dared to assassinate the mayor without any scruples, was simply the god of death.

Next, what if someone hired a dragon to assassinate him?

Everyone held the red piece of paper and their expressions changed drastically.

According to the information they had gathered, the place where the dragon’s Thorn came was the darkness.

Now they truly understood.

If you had this contact information, your enemy might also have this contact information. If you didn’t hire the Dragon’s Thorn, then your enemy might attack.

The dragon’s thorn was like a demon who had signed a contract with someone.

Now that this contract was placed in front of them, whether they signed it or not, they only needed to consider it for themselves.

Everyone’s expression changed.

Finally, someone gritted his teeth and took out his communication stone plate.

The world was so cruel.

At noon, Wang Xian came to a restaurant with a smile on his face. He was in a good mood and sat down at a table by the window on the second floor.

He ordered a few special dishes and a hundred-year-old wine. He sat there and watched the storm with a smile.

“Eh? Look at the discussion section in East Sea City. Dragon Spike? Someone said that dragon spike came to East Sea City?”

“What Dragon Spike and Ghost Spike? Hurry up and drink!”

“What? Dragon Spike actually wiped out the snake family. All the experts of the snake family were wiped out in one night. My God? What? Dragon Spike once assassinated the Mayor of Bridge Forest Town on the street? How is this possible?”

“Really? is what you said true? Oh My God, this is too terrifying!”

On the seat beside them, exclamations suddenly sounded. Wang Xian looked over and heard their discussion. Soon after, a smile appeared on his face.

Very soon, the two of them looked at the information on the communication stone plate in shock.

Wang Xian also took out the communication stone plate with a smile on his face and looked at them one by one.

Unlike those small towns, the communication stone plate was located in Donghai city. It could send messages through the special formation in the city.

Very soon, the news about the destruction of the snake family and the arrival of the dragon spike was sent to the entire Donghai city.

Even the news about the dragon spike was sent out.

This caused everyone to look at the information on the communication stone plate in shock.

“This dragon spike is too powerful. After the dragon Spike arrives, wouldn’t East Sea city be in Chaos?”

“I respect the rules of this dragon spike. Don’t kill good people, don’t kill children. F * ck, there’s actually a rule of crowdfunding. Crowdfunding kills people, rewards good and punishment evil, and even assassinations at half price. This is too f * cking showy!”

“F * ck, the rules of this dragon spike mercenary group are too F * cking awesome. F * ck, so the mayor of bridge forest town was assassinated by a few hundred crowdfunding people. The Dragon Assassin’s commission was halved!”

Not long after, the entire second floor of the restaurant was talking about the dragon spike mercenary group.

There were even people slapping the table, looking at the dragon Spike Assassin’s rules in astonishment.

There was such a rule for an assassin’s assassination?

Not killing children? weren’t children the easiest to assassinate?

Reward Good and punish evil, crowdfunding assassination, half-price assassination... You F * cking need to know that you are an assassin organization!

An assassin organization actually has such rules?

This is too showy!

“This assassin organization is really awesome. As soon as they entered East Sea city, they destroyed the snake family!”

A middle-aged man slowly drank a mouthful of water, he raised his head and continued, “I really want to say something to the dragon spike mercenary group. When I was young, my family was poor. The only thing that was valuable was the iron chain on the door. Every time it rained, I was very worried. Please don’t Rust!”

“The rules of the dragon spike are simply too showy!”
