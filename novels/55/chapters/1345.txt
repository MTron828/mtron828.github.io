Chapter 1346: 1346 destruction 7

“Boom!”

“AH, no, no!”

An explosion sounded in front of the palace of the Sky Island dynasty. The King of the sky island screamed in horror.

After the explosion ended, a corpse fell into a three-meter deep pit. It lay there quietly, not moving at all.

Everyone looked at the corpse. The screams from earlier echoed in their minds.

The King was dead!

Their king was dead!

He was killed in one move!

Looking at Wang Xian who was floating in the air hundreds of meters above them, he looked down at them like a king.

Everyone had a feeling of insignificance!

“From today onwards, there will be no more Sky Island Empire!”

Wang Xian stared at the ground below. The five elements millstone started to spin slowly, and beams of terrifying light shot downwards.

Boom! Boom! Boom

“No, no, don’t kill us. Our Sky Island Empire is willing to submit!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Master of the Dragon Palace, we were wrong. Don’t attack, don’t Attack!”

“It has nothing to do with us. It’s the decision of the royal family of the Sky Island Empire. It has nothing to do with us!”

When everyone felt that Wang Xian’s attack was about to land, the tens of thousands of people below had completely collapsed.

They were all powerful factions in the Sky Island Empire. However, when they saw their king being killed in an instant, they were all extremely terrified.

The other party had announced that he wanted to destroy the Sky Island Empire!

With his terrifying strength, it was a piece of cake!

Terrified pleas for mercy came from below. Wang Xian’s eyes did not have the slightest fluctuation.

War was cruel. The strong preyed on the weak.

Just as the King of the Sky Island Empire and the elder of the one leaf continent empire had said, if they worked together, any force that dared to lay their hands on the deep sea spiritual spring would be annihilated.

Wang Xian did not show any mercy either.

If he was not strong, then he would be the one to die!

Boom

A wave of attacks landed and thousands of people died instantly. They were completely powerless to resist.

“Master of the Dragon Palace, let’s talk this out. Our One Leaf Continent Empire is willing to withdraw from the competition for the deep sea spiritual spring. We will definitely not participate in it. Please don’t Kill Us!”

The old man from the one leaf continent empire shouted loudly as he looked at Wang Xian, who was as mighty as a god. His face was filled with despair.

He was terrified, terrified, trembling, and in despair!

He would never have thought that there was a terrifying existence at the fifth level of the Seethrough Void tier in this region.

Fifth level of the Seethrough Void Tier. This was the fifth level of the Seethrough Void Tier!

“After I destroy the Heaven Island Empire, I will go and destroy your one leaf continent Empire!”

Wang Xian said with a cold look in his eyes.

He would have to pay a heavy price for all his offenses!

“No, no...”

The old man’s eyes were filled with fear. He roared and stared at Wang Xian, wanting to beg for mercy.

“Disciples of the Dragon Palace, Listen Up. Destroy the Heaven Island dynasty. If they dare to take over our resources, they will compensate us with the entire dynasty!”

Wang Xian shouted softly and ordered the members of the Dragon Palace.

“It’s the Dragon King. Anyone who dares to offend US will die!”

The members of the Dragon Palace looked at their invincible Dragon King with excitement on their faces as they roared loudly.

“Attack!”

Even Prime Minister Gui roared loudly with a face full of emotions.

The Dragon Palace had been enduring for a very long time over the past few months.

Initially, they were prepared to fight back when the experts of the Dragon Palace achieved a breakthrough.

Now that the Dragon King had returned, he had invincible power.

“Destroy the Sky Island dynasty!”

The members of the Dragon Palace roared and gave off violent auras.

“Bring them here!”

Prime Minister Gui stared coldly at Prince Jiang, Princess Yi Ye, and the princes behind them. Then, he ordered the members of the Dragon Palace behind him.

“Yes, Prime Minister Gui!”

The dozen or so Golden Swordfish moved and stared at Crown Prince Jiang, Princess Yi Ye, and the other princes of the Sky Island dynasty with murderous intent.

They moved and attacked with their swords.

“Oh No, run!”

“Run, run!”

At this moment, Crown Prince Jiang, Princess Yi Ye, and the other princes and princesses beside them were no longer as high and mighty as before.

They were no longer as arrogant and despotic as before.

“Great-grandfather, save me, save me!”

Princess one leaf looked at the golden swordfish that was attacking them and yelled at the old man beside her in fear.

The old man from the one leaf continent dynasty turned his head and looked over with an ugly expression.

He opened his mouth.

“Pay for your ignorance!”

At this moment, the voice of judgement came from the sky. The old man’s body trembled and his eyes were filled with despair.

Today was the day of the marriage between the two countries. It was a joyous day.

Especially after learning about the deep sea spiritual spring, his heart was filled with excitement.

This was an opportunity. If he seized this opportunity, he would be able to bring a huge amount of resources to the one leaf continent dynasty.

However, what he didn’t expect was that what he brought wasn’t an opportunity, but destruction.

Weng

A terrifying energy swept over. He could sense that all the void interpretation realm experts from the Sky Island Empire had died under this attack.

They didn’t have the ability to resist at all. They didn’t have the ability to resist at all.

The Lord of the Dragon Palace in the sky didn’t hold back either.

Boom! Boom! Boom

He could feel the terrifying energy destroying his body. He widened his eyes and wanted to resist.

However, that chaotic energy was filled with destruction.

“Is a powerhouse at level five of the Seethrough realm really that strong?”

He widened his eyes and stared at Wang Xian’s huge body.

“No, Great Grandpa, Great Grandpa!”

At the side, when Princess Yi Ye saw her great grandpa, a powerhouse at level four of the Seethrough realm, being killed, she shouted in horror.

“Peng!”

“Peng, Peng, Peng!”

At this moment, a bone-piercing sword light landed on their bodies.

Princess one leaf, Crown Prince Jiang, and four or five other princes were knocked down by the powerful force.

They raised their heads in fear and looked at the seven or eight figures in front of them.

Seven Girls, one prime minister turtle with a turtle shell.

“Offending the Dragon Empress, do you think your status is very honorable?”

Prime Minister Gui stared coldly at the one-leaf princess, Prince Jiang, and the other princes.

“We were wrong. We were wrong. Please let us go. Please!”

At this moment, Prince Jiang and the others looked at all of them in fear and shouted in fear.

“How can you offend the Dragon Queen? Cut her into pieces!”

Prime Minister Gui judged harshly.

The Dragon King didn’t need to deal with matters that offended the dragon queen. As the head butler of the Dragon Palace, he would punish this group of damnable things ruthlessly.

Prime Minister Gui’s words caused Prince Jiang, Princess Yiye, and the other princes’faces to be filled with fear!

Especially those princes who were staring at Guan Shuqing fervently, and Princess Yiye who wanted hairpins and rings, their bodies trembled violently!

If can regret, they absolutely dare not be so insolent!
