Chapter 1317: 1318 acted unscrupulously

“Nameless Sword Demon, supreme chosen one, he’s really arrogant!”

“He has the right to be arrogant. I’m really envious. Who Do you think is stronger than our young master?”

“Of course it’s our young master. Our young master entered the forbidden land and obtained a huge opportunity. In the future, he’ll become the strongest expert in the flowing sea region!”

“This nameless sword demon is a little unbridled. Although he is a Supreme Heaven’s pride expert, he is a little too proud to behave like this in the main hall!”

Wang Xian rode on the demon soul and stood in the middle of the first level of the main hall. His unbridled aura caused everyone around to raise their eyebrows slightly.

At the position of Frost sect, a few young men looked at Wang Xian and discussed in a low voice.

Wang Xian stared at the Frost sect’s location with a hint of killing intent in his eyes.

“Roar Roar!”

The Demon Soul let out a low roar as a murderous aura was emitted. It slowly walked towards the Frost sect’s location.

“Eh?”

When the people on the first floor saw Wang Xian walking over, they were astonished and stared at him with doubt

“Demon Soul, you damn traitor!”

At this moment, a few low growls suddenly came from the side. Demon Soul turned his head and saw six demon scale demon beasts staring at him coldly.

In the past, Demon Soul was the pride of their demon scale demon beasts. Now, it had become the shame of their race.

Every Demon Scale Demon Beast wished that they could kill Demon Soul.

The Demon Soul took a glance at the few demon beasts. Each of them had the strength of the second level of the Seethrough realm.

“Roar!”

It let out a low roar in disdain and ignored them. It continued to walk towards the location of the Frost sect.

“Kill this traitor. Let’s Kill It!”

A Demon Lin Beast roared. The demon flames on its body spread out in a radius of a hundred meters.

“Wait a minute!”

A demonic Lin Beast took two steps forward slowly to stop the violent demonic Lin. It looked at Wang Xian and the demonic soul with a cold gaze.

“Eh? This nameless sword demon is going? To the location of the Frost sect!”

“What is he going to do? is he going to take revenge for the sneak attack that happened a few months ago?”

“With his strength, he shouldn’t be a match for the four level 2 insightful void martial artists. Furthermore, they are in the formation!”

When the forty to fifty insightful void martial artists saw Wang Xian walking towards the direction of the Frost sect, they were astonished.

“What is this nameless sword demon doing? Is he courting death?”

When the group of Frost sect saw Wang Xian walking over, their eyes revealed a cold expression.

“Kid, what do you mean?”

An elder at level two insightful void martial artist raised his head slightly and walked out of the formation. He stared at Wang Xian with a cold gaze and questioned.

“Six months ago, you guys ambushed me. Today, I will return it!”

Wang Xian stared at them and said with a calm expression.

“With just you?”

The elder’s face was gloomy. “Looks like you are here to court death. You really think highly of yourself as a supreme prodigy. HMPH!”

The elder stared at Wang Xian with disdain. Behind him, three experts at the second level of the Seethrough realm walked out and stood around the elder.

“He wants to deal with us? This nameless sword demon is really arrogant!”

“Hehe, he really thinks that he is invincible in the world. If our cold sect wants to kill him, it will be a piece of cake!”

The few young men in the formation looked at Wang Xian in surprise and said with a slightly disdainful and cold face.

“The sect master of the cold sect is a top-notch expert at the fourth level of the Seethrough realm. This nameless sword demon is making an enemy out of the cold sect. He is not rational!”

“Six months ago, the three people from the Frost sect attacked him and killed one of them. In the end, they didn’t dare to continue attacking him. Could it be that after six months of cultivation, his strength has improved?”

“Even if it has improved, making an enemy out of the Frost sect would be courting death. The elders and sect master of the Frost sect are up there!”

Some of the people around were also astonished when they heard Wang Xian’s words.

“I am a person who holds grudges. Since you dare to ambush me and want to kill and rob me, I will naturally not return the favor!”

Wang Xian looked at the group of people from the Frost sect and smiled faintly.

His crown shimmered. Wang Xian moved his body and instantly disappeared from his demon soul. The demon-free sword in his hand attacked the four insightful emptiness realm experts directly.

“You are courting death. Kill him!”

The four people from the cold sect were furious when they saw Wang Xian’s attack.

The Old Man in the middle roared loudly. A blue staff appeared in his hand. The few people beside him also picked up their weapons instantly.

The temperature of the entire first layer instantly dropped by dozens of degrees.

Buzz

However, at this moment, a black ray of light shot toward them directly.

The expressions of the four people from the cold sect who were about to make a move froze instantly.

Clang

Wang Xian’s figure appeared in front of them. He sheathed his demon-free sword and walked to the side of the four people who were still.

With a wave of his arm, he kept all the interspatial rings in their hands. He didn’t even spare their corpses.

“This... this...”

Everyone in the surroundings was stunned. They looked at this scene in astonishment.

“Trash!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly and looked at the few people in the frosty sect’s formation.

“You... you actually dared to kill our martial uncle. You’re done for. Our sect leader and elders are up there. You’re done for!”

The remaining six young men’s expressions changed drastically as they stared at Wang Xian and shouted.

“A bunch of trash. Back then, you guys dared to ambush me. You should be prepared to die!”

Wang Xian looked at the six young men in the formation and walked straight over.

“You... you...”

“Don’t be afraid. Let’s contact the elders and sect leader. We have the formation. They can’t get in, they can’t get in!”

The six young men saw Wang Xian walking over step by step and said with a face full of fear.

He smiled faintly and walked to the front of the water-blue formation.

Under the astonished gazes of the six young men, Wang Xian walked straight in.

“What?”

When the six young men from the Frost sect saw that Wang Xian had walked straight through the formation, their eyes widened as they stared at him in disbelief.

Looking at his indifferent expression, their bodies began to tremble.

“Hiss, this... how is this possible? An instant kill? The nameless sword demon actually killed four experts from the Frost sect who were at the second level of the Seethrough realm in an instant. This...”

“So powerful, insta-kill, insta-kill. This nameless sword demon’s strength has broken through again?”

“At least the strength of a profound void tier 3 expert, this... this...”

The surrounding profound void tier experts revealed shocked expressions.

Insta-killing four profound void tier 2 experts in one move... How did the nameless sword demon become so terrifying?

“Ahhhh!”

Right at this moment, a pained cry sounded from the side.

Seeing that the six core disciples of the Frost sect were killed, everyone’s pupils contracted again.

He could actually enter the fourth level of the Void Interpretation Formation directly!

This...

What treasures did he have on him?

Wang Xian took his time to put away the interspatial rings of the six core disciples of the Frost sect before putting away the formation.

He walked slowly to the side of the demon soul and looked in the direction of the Demon Beasts.

“You few demon beasts want to die. It’s good that you have finished them off. Now it’s Your Turn!”
