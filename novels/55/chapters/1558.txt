Chapter 1559: 1,559 heavenly demons appeared 5

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

Next to the gigantic statue in the ruins of the divine kingdom, terrifying sounds of collisions were heard within a radius of a few hundred kilometers.

More than 20 experts at the seventh level of the Seethrough realm attacked the gigantic dragon claws.

The powerful attacks landed on the dragon claws but did not cause much damage.

At this moment, Wang Xian controlled the gigantic dragon claws and charged at the level seven insightful void martial artists.

“Damn, what sturdy claws. What kind of supernatural ability is this?”

The face of an elder in a black robe at level seven insightful void martial artist turned ashen.

They thought that it would be easy to kill a person of the same level with more than 20 people attacking him.

However, they had not expected that the opponent’s attack would be so terrifying.

“Oh my God, what kind of monster is this? It’s actually fighting with more than 20 experts of the seventh level of the profound void tier!”

“This... this creature is so terrifying. That Demon Claw is simply too abnormal!”

In the surroundings, everyone saw the battle erupting here, especially the Dragon Claw that was two kilometers in size. It was exceptionally eye-catching in the entire sky.

Everyone had shocked expressions on their faces.

A creature that could fight against more than 20 seventh level void interpretation creatures? This must be an existence at the eighth level of the void interpretation realm!

“Aspect, Demon Eye!”

“Aspect, Heaven’s light!”

“Aspect, Heaven’s punishment!”

“Aspect, thunder god’s descent!”

...

When they saw Wang Xian’s dragon claw attacking them once again, the terrifying demonic aura attacked their bodies.

All the experts at level seven of the Seethrough realm had extremely grave expressions. They knew that they had encountered a tough opponent this time!

“Kill! He hasn’t reached level eight of the Seethrough realm. Kill him!”

An angry roar sounded. One by one, the black-robed elders cast their dharma idol.

Each dharma idol was like a heaven and earth phenomenon.

In the sky, a blood-red demon eye was directly in the sky. It was like a terrifying demon that was peering into the human world.

A beam of heavenly light swept towards the Dragon Claw from a height of 10,000 meters.

A giant that was a few thousand meters in size held a long sword in his hand and slashed towards the Dragon Claw.

There were also streaks of azure-blue heavenly lightning that wreaked havoc within a radius of a few thousand meters.

Streaks of attacks were directed towards Wang Xian.

“Boom, explode!”

Wang Xian raised his Dragon Claw and attacked all the Dharma idols in the sky.

He used the dragon kingdom in his palm to fight against more than 20 powerful dharma idols.

Boom! Boom! Boom

In an instant, destructive energy rolled out in a radius of 10 kilometers.

The terrifying energy fluctuation impacted a radius of 20 kilometers.

“This is bad!”

Seeing the terrifying energy impact the surroundings, the faces of the powerhouses at the seventh level of the Seethrough realm turned red. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Streams of energy spread out around them, blocking the impact of the various energies.

“Explode!”

Wang Xian’s Dragon Claw attacked an area of 2 kilometers below.

The boundless dark energy swept downwards.

“Not good, escape!”

More than 20 experts of the seventh-level of the Seethrough realm looked at the Dragon Claw that covered the sky and earth, fleeing in fear.

“My God!”

“It’s been a long time since such a terrifying battle broke out. Over 20 profound void tier 7 experts ganging up on one person, and in the end, they were completely suppressed!”

The earth-shattering battle caused everyone in the kingdom ruins to turn their gazes over.

In front of a huge black lake a few hundred kilometers away, many powerful factions and experts were staring at the center of the lake with fervent gazes.

However, when the terrifying sounds of battle came from afar, everyone hurriedly looked in that direction.

“What’s the situation? In that direction, there’s at least a group of seventh level profound void tier experts fighting!”

“What’s That Thing? What a huge claw, is that a Dharma Idol? What a terrifying demon claw!”

All the experts gathered here were all top-tier experts in the vast region.

When they looked into the distance, they could vaguely see a huge demonic claw.

“Send someone over to check if there are any treasures. Otherwise, why would such a terrifying battle break out?”

The eyes of the experts from the three superpowers flashed as they sent someone over to check.

Some first-rate forces also sent their experts over immediately.

“Ahhhhh!”

At this moment, under Wang Xian’s dragon claws, four desperate screams were heard.

The huge dragon claws crushed the four level seven insightful void martial artists who couldn’t escape in time.

The terrifying destructive power of darkness directly killed them.

Four level seven insightful void martial artists died!

“What?”

The deaths of the four level seven insightful void martial artists caused the other twenty level seven insightful void martial artists to show an embarrassed expression.

Half of them were swept away by the dark energy. The terrifying demonic aura caused their faces to turn pale!

“Too strong, simply too strong. We are actually not his match!”

An elder gulped and stared at the gigantic Dragon Claw with fear.

“Run!”

Some of the insightful void Tier 7 powerhouses revealed a look of fear. They turned around and fled into the distance.

“You want to escape? I’ve said it, all of you must die!”

Wang Xian moved his dragon claws. Within the Dragon Claws, a two-meter-thick devil chain slithered around, making an ear-piercing sound.

“Devil scale chain!”

Wang Xian swept the dragon claws in his hand and directly attacked the level 7 insightful void martial artist.

“How can he be so strong?”

The Level 7 insightful void martial artist looked at the Devil scale chain that appeared in front of him in an instant. His expression was extremely ugly.

He raised the large saber in his hand and slashed heavily at the devil scale chain.

“Hua la la!”

However, the devil scale chain rolled and swept towards his body.

The Devil scale chain that was a few thousand meters long and a meter thick, carrying the power of the Divine Dragon, swept towards his body.

“Pu Pu Pu!”

“Cough Cough Cough!”

The terrifying power caused the devil scale chain to spit out large mouthfuls of blood, mixed with internal organs.

The fifth insightful void Tier 7 expert had fallen!

“Kill! I don’t believe that I can’t kill him! At this time, don’t hold back!”

One of the insightful void tier 7 experts saw that the escaping expert had been killed, and his expression was extremely unsightly. He roared loudly, and his body emitted beams of dazzling light.

“The descent of the Radiant Emperor!”

He roared!

The other insightful void Tier 7 experts also revealed their bloodlust, and their eyes revealed a crazed killing intent.

“Aspect, Eclipse Moon!”

“Aspect, Thunder Disc!”

...

Since the other party didn’t want them to leave, they would kill them. Every single one of them had fought their way out from their bones.

The aspect that was even stronger than before attacked Wang Xian.

“Dragon Head World!”

Wang Xian looked at the aspect that covered an area of 10 kilometers and was attacking him. His dragon eyes were filled with blood.

It raised its head and a gigantic dragon head appeared.

“Drown it, Darkness!”

He opened the gigantic dragon head and the terrifying darkness attacked all the Dharma Idols.
