Chapter 1234: 1235 Heaven’s pride stage

Translator: 5496903

Wang Xian relied on the system. Due to his deep foundation and inheritance, he would automatically obtain supernatural powers.

Sometimes, Wang Xian could even obtain two to three supernatural powers.

However, these supernatural powers were all single-attribute supernatural powers. This was because Wang Xian did not cultivate dual-attribute combat skills.

It was only when he reached extraordinary level eight that his understanding of attributes deepened. He relied on the system to obtain dual-attribute supernatural powers.

Even so, it was still considered useless for a five-elemental divine dragon.

When Wang Xian began to comprehend the combination of the two attributes, this upgrade allowed him to comprehend three or even four attribute divine abilities.

During these few days, Wang Xian was also comprehending the combination of attribute attacks while he was selling various items.

With the successful examples of the three attributes, it was much easier for him to comprehend the next three attributes.

On the sixth day, he had two ideas. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

One was to use the descent of the wood world as the prototype. By adding the water and metal attributes, he would be able to summon an even more powerful combat object. Through the spirit enchantment, he would make it even more terrifying.

Wang Xian used the five elements of metal to create wood and wood to create water. After countless attempts, he finally grasped the basics.

Furthermore, due to the combination of metal and water, Wang Xian thought of the fire element in this combination of combat techniques.

Water countered fire, fire countered metal, and the five elements countered each other to form a combat technique.

In the end, when Wang Xian broke through to transcendent level nine, the system rewarded him with a divine ability, gold spirit tree demon, and gold fire cleansing.

Two terrifying divine abilities combined with three elements.

As for the final battle of the Earth, it was probably due to Wang Xian’s deepening of his attributes. The system rewarded him with a divine ability that combined four elements.

This was also the case. Wang Xian had basically mastered the combination of the three attributes. It would not be long before he could try the combination of the four attributes.

However, the understanding of the four attributes made it easier for Wang Xian to understand the combination of the four attributes in the future.

Wang Xian moved his palm slightly. The air in his palm seemed to explode. The four attributes revolved in his palm, causing an excited expression to appear on his face.

“These are only four attributes. If I can master the combination of the five elements, will I be able to destroy a level three or even level four void interpretation expert? This is too violent!”

An excited expression appeared in Wang Xian’s eyes. He could control the five elements with a flip of his hand.

“Phew. In the next few days, I should deepen my attack on the combination of attributes!”

Wang Xian took a deep breath as his eyes sparkled.

After transforming into the Divine Dragon, he was now able to destroy a level 3 Seethrough expert. With his strength, he could be considered a top-notch expert even in the graveyard of demi-humans.

Some kings of small countries like the nine stars Empire were only at level 3 Seethrough.

When his strength increased once again and he mastered the five elements, he would be able to directly destroy a Level 4 Seethrough expert. A Level 5 expert could fight him or even destroy him!

“However, I will need one billion dragon crystals for the next level up. If I exchange them for middle-grade spirit stones, I will need more than ten trillion!”

Wang Xian looked at the dragon energy required for the next level up and the corner of his mouth twitched.

There was one problem. If Wang Xian were to level up again, he would be at the first level of the see-through void stage. He would not be able to reach the half-step see-through void stage!

If he were to level up again, he would be able to step into the third transformation of the Divine Dragon Transformation!

With the increase in my strength, it would be easier for me to obtain resources. I will go back after I level up to the third change of the Divine Dragon Transformation

Wang Xian thought to himself. Next, he would have to accumulate ten times the resources that he had obtained previously.

After closing the dragon and Phoenix grocery store, Wang Xian flew towards his residence.

He had been staying in the store for the past few days and had not returned. In the next few days, Wang Xian would have to comb through his combination attributes to build a stronger foundation.

When he returned to his residence, Wang Xian placed the spirit purple qilin and the blood evil turtle in the courtyard. He returned to his room and began to comprehend them.

He still had to continue to improve his mastery of the fusion of the three attributes.

Star explosion was fire Earth Metal!

Fire penetrating metal was fire metal water!

Metal Spirit Tree Demon was metal water wood!

Metal fire cleansing was also fire metal water!

He could still continue to combine the four attributes — metal wood fire, metal wood earth, water fire wood, water wood earth.

In the following period of time, Wang Xian was immersed in the combination of attributes.

The combination of metal, wood, fire, and the brilliant sun combat technique was comprehended.

The combination of metal, wood, and Earth attributes of the Bramble domain combat technique was comprehended.

The combination of water, fire, and wood attributes of the spirit poison combat technique was comprehended.

The combination of water, wood, and earth attributes of the three spirits combat armor combat technique was comprehended.

Wang Xian spent seven to eight days to slowly master the combination of the three attributes.

After completely mastering the combination of the three attributes, he could easily kill anyone in his human form at the second level of the void interpretation stage.

Following that, Wang Xian began to comprehend the fusion of the four attributes.

Compared to the three attributes, the difficulty of fusing the four attributes had increased by a few levels.

How to perfectly fuse the four attributes and how to make it explode with terrifying power, all of these required a deep understanding.

Even with the four attributes, it was still extremely difficult for Wang Xian to comprehend the combined attacks of the four attributes.

According to his estimation, if he didn’t have any inspiration, he would need at least a few months of practice and comprehension.

“Awoo!”

“Awoo!”

Another few days passed, and Wang Xian heard Xiao Ha’s cry from outside.

This made him slightly stunned. He looked at the time and realized that another two days had passed!

It should be Ling Jian ‘er who has gathered enough spiritual liquid

Wang Xian thought to himself. He moved his body and opened the door.

He looked at the wall. As expected, Ling Jian ‘er was standing there with Xiao Ha in her arms.

“Have you gathered enough spiritual liquid?”

Wang Xian looked at her and asked with a smile.

“It’s time for the agreed time!”

When she heard this, she frowned slightly and threw a porcelain bottle to Wang Xian. “There are still two thousand left. I will bring it to you as soon as possible!”

“Huh?”

Wang Xian took the spiritual liquid that she threw over and reached out to catch it. He was slightly surprised when he saw that there were exactly five thousand drops inside.

From Long Xiaotian, he learned some information about Ling Jian ‘ER and knew that she was the one who obtained the spiritual liquid.

He was very surprised that she could obtain five thousand drops of spiritual liquid in half a month, which was equivalent to ten billion middle-grade spiritual stones.

“Eh? You’re injured again?”

Wang Xian kept the spiritual liquid into his interspatial ring. When he looked at Ling Jian ‘er who was about to ask some questions, he suddenly saw the injury on her arm. He was slightly stunned.

“It’s inevitable to get injured in a fight!”

Ling Jian ‘er said expressionlessly.

“I’ll give you the Golden Lotus tree first. If you tell me how you got so much spiritual liquid so quickly, I don’t want the rest of the spiritual liquid!”

Wang Xian threw the golden lotus tree to her and asked.

“The Heaven’s pride stage is the Heaven’s pride stage left behind by the Blood Stream sect. As long as you step onto the Heaven’s pride stage, you will be rewarded with spiritual liquid. The higher the ranking, the more generous the reward!”

Ling Jian ‘er took the golden lotus tree and said to him expressionlessly.
