Chapter 1735: 1735, the mighty dragon-phoenix Empire

"I'd like to see what you can do to me!"

The ape-man in the lead said to the dragon guards with a disdainful face.

After saying that, he flicked away the long sword in front of him with contempt and walked forward proudly.

All the citizens of the dragon-phoenix Empire looked at this scene with an embarrassed expression.

The demon beasts of the ten thousand fey empire were simply slapping their faces!

"Hehe!"

The Sacred Fire clan members watched this scene with smiles on their faces! Upstodatee from n(0)/vùíÜ/lbIn/.(co/m

"Clang!"

However, just as the ape-man pushed away the Golden Longsword and took a step forward, a sharp sound rang out!

"Those who resist will die!"

The sound of the sharp sword was raised, and the Dragon Guard's voice rang out at the same time.

The moment he swung his longsword, everyone in the surroundings had looks of astonishment on their faces.

The seven ape-men were stunned, and a look of shock flashed across their eyes.

Especially the ape-man in the lead. He looked at the sword that was coming towards him, and a look of confusion and fear appeared on his face.

"Pu!"

However, this only happened in an instant!

In an instant, the sword had already descended, and the ape-man in the lead did not have the slightest ability to resist.

"Peng!"

A corpse fell heavily to the ground, and his head was directly chopped off.

"What?"

Everyone in the surroundings looked at this scene in shock.

The guards of the dragon-phoenix Empire had actually killed the demonic beasts of the ten thousand Fey Empire!

"You... you actually dared to kill the demonic beasts of our ten thousand fey empire. Your dragon-phoenix Empire is simply courting death!"

Beside them, the other six ape-men from the Ten Thousand Fey Empire had savage expressions.

They pointed at the Dragon Guards and roared with killing intent!

"Pu Pu Pu!"

However, at that moment, the sound of swords being drawn rang out.

"Peng Peng Peng!"

Following that, the ape-men fell to the ground and were all killed!

The ape-men's eyes were filled with shock and disbelief, as well as a hint of regret deep in their hearts!

They really dared to make a move!

"Please abide by the law in our Dragon and Phoenix Empire. Those who violate the law together will be punished. Those who resist will be killed!"

The Dragon Guard's cold voice sounded. His face was still as indifferent as before, without the slightest bit of emotion.

"Hiss, this... the people of the dragon and Phoenix Empire are so powerful!"

"They really dare to make a move. These are the people of the ten thousand fey empire. They actually directly killed them!"

"Oh my God, the people from the Dragon Phoenix Empire are so tough? They actually killed them directly!"

"Haha, I support them. Well done. Kill those bastards!"

When the people gathered around saw the seven ape men from the ten thousand Fey Empire being killed, they were all shocked.

The factions that came to watch the ceremony were all dumbfounded. Even the people from the Ao Shan Empire were shocked.

To dare to kill people from the ten thousand Fey Empire, was the Dragon Phoenix Empire that ferocious?

Not afraid of the Ten Thousand Fey Empire taking revenge?

Or was it that they had nothing to fear!

However, compared to the shock from the other factions, everyone from the Dragon Phoenix Empire was extremely relieved.

Their strength was the true glory of an empire.

"Roar, your Puny Dragon Phoenix Empire actually dares to kill members of our ten thousand Fey Empire!"

At that moment, a roar suddenly came from behind them. The sound reverberated within a few hundred kilometers.

The sound instantly caused the entire imperial capital to tremble.

Everyone looked over at the same time. When the Ten Thousand Fey Empire members heard the sound, they immediately flew over.

"Flying within the imperial capital is prohibited. Get lost!"

At this moment, ao Jian's cold voice rang out. Everyone who flew into the sky had a drastic change in expression as their bodies plummeted downwards.

Ao Jian's figure instantly appeared in the sky above the restaurant. He looked down at everyone from above.

Buzz

At the same time, Feng Lingtian, who was also responsible for the city guards'duties, appeared at the side.

"Ao Jian, don't give the ten thousand fey empire any face!"

Wang Xian crossed his arms and transmitted his voice to Ao jian directly.

He watched this scene with a smile on his face. Today, he wanted to see how the ten thousand Fey Empire would dare to be arrogant!

"HMM?"

Ao Jian, who appeared in the sky, sensed the dragon king immediately. When he heard the Dragon King's voice transmission, he nodded silently.

"Who dares to make a ruckus in our dragon and Phoenix Empire!"

Ao Jian looked coldly at the claw-hunting demonic beast that had sharp claws and a slender body!

"Who gave your dragon-phoenix Empire the courage to kill a member of our ten thousand Fey Empire!"

The claw-hunting demonic beast slowly walked towards the center. Beside him, there were five clansmen!

"Leader, seven members of the ten thousand fey empire have seriously injured others for no reason. Under arrest, we will directly kill them!"

The Dragon Guard reported directly to Ao Jian.

"According to the laws of the dragon and Phoenix Empire, shouting in the imperial capital is prohibited. Anyone who makes noise will have their arms cut off!"

When Ao Jian heard the Dragon Guard's report, he looked at the claw-hunting demonic beast and said coldly.

"Clang!"

Just as he finished speaking, ao Jian flicked his finger and a sword qi instantly cut off the claw-hunting demonic beast's arm.

Ao Yao, who was at the first level of longevity, could fight against a demon at the second level of longevity, especially the Golden Swordfish clan, who had cultivated the heartless sword principle. It could be said that they were the most terrifying in the Dragon Palace.

Their terror was no less than that of the strange demon.

"What?"

Seeing ao Jian cut off the arm of a Demon Beast from the Ten Thousand Fey Empire on the spot, everyone was dumbfounded again!

"What is the dragon-phoenix Empire doing? Is it expressing their strength?"

The forces that came to watch the ceremony were shocked as their expressions changed.

The dragon-phoenix Empire's strength was beyond everyone's expectations!

"Hiss!"

When the claw-hunting demon beast whose arm had been cut off saw the extremely powerful ao jian, his pupils constricted, and a trace of fear appeared on his face.

At that moment, he realized that the dragon-phoenix Empire did not care about their identity as the ten thousand fey empire.

He had no doubt that if he dared to say anything else, he would definitely be killed by that merciless swordsman!

"Awesome!"

"Haha, Domineering. He's simply too domineering. I like it!"

"He dares to be so arrogant in our territory. Does he really think that we won't dare to do anything to them? Continue to be so arrogant?"

The surrounding citizens of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire looked on with excitement.

At this moment, they felt extremely good!

Feng Lingtian stood at the side and looked at Ao Jian in astonishment. Suddenly, he noticed Wang Xian's figure. He pursed his lips and didn't say a word!

Normally, Ao Jian and the Dragon Guards wouldn't be so overbearing and disrespectful to the ten thousand fey empire.

Clearly, all of this was under the command of his brother-in-law!

"Bzz!"

However, in the next instant, an extremely violent aura pressed down on them.

Within a radius of several hundred kilometers, everyone felt their breathing stop!

A death threat came!

"Dragon and Phoenix Empire, you'd better give us an explanation!"

"Otherwise, we will let you witness the roars of ten thousand beasts, wreaking havoc in the world!"

A violent roar resounded throughout the imperial capital!
