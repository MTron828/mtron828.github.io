Translator: 5496903

“Is that so? But I want to take off your mask and see the ugly face underneath!”

When Mu Yuan heard Wang Xian’s words, a sneer appeared on his face as he stared at him with slight disdain.

“You want to get involved too!”

When Ling Jian ‘er saw Mu Yuan walking over to target Wang Xian, a hint of coldness flashed across her eyes as she questioned.

“Haha, I’m not involved in your matters. I just want to take off a person’s ugly mask and let others know that there are some people who are not qualified to be on par with me!”

Mu Yuan laughed out loud. He narrowed his eyes slightly and stared at Wang Xian. His eyes were filled with coldness.

“This... This Mu Yuan is obviously here to help the people of the Hanhai Empire. Could it be that he is on good terms with the Prince of the Hanhai Empire?”

“Who knows? After all, even an ice-cold woman like Ling Jian ‘ER has someone to stand up for him. It’s normal for the Hanhai Empire to have some friends!”

“It’s really a bumpy ride. An unknown heaven’s favorite came to help Ling Jian ‘er, and in the end, Mu Yuan came to help the Hanhai Empire. This time, Ling Jian ‘er still hasn’t come out from the dead end!”

When the surrounding people saw this scene, they whispered to each other.

The atmosphere became heavy again. Mu Yuan stared at Wang Xian with a smile while everyone from the Hanhai Empire locked their eyes on Ling Jian ‘er with a cold and mocking expression.

Han Mingshan revealed a cold smile on his face. He glanced at Wang Xian and Ling Jian ‘er and said, “All those who oppose US must die!”

“That... that is... that is a senior. It is definitely a senior. That figure, that Aura, I will never forget it. I will never forget it!”

At this moment, a young man in tattered clothes was wearing a hat. He was staring at Wang Xian’s figure with excitement.

His body was trembling and his eyes were filled with gratitude.

However, he quickly turned his head around. His gaze was filled with endless killing intent as he stared at Mu Yuan. A terrifying aura was emitted in the surroundings.

“What’s going on?”

The youths around him felt the terrifying aura from his body and moved to the left and right in shock!

“Weng!”

Under the shocked gazes of the youths on both sides, a large sword appeared in his hand.

The large sword’s two attributes, gold and water, and that disdainful aura immediately erupted.

“It’s you. You Don’t have the qualifications to be on par with him!”

A furious roar sounded out without any warning.

Following that, a figure charged towards Mu Yuan.

There was no warning at all. There was only one sentence that carried a terrifying killing intent.

“Wear the Golden Sword!”

The youth in tattered clothes charged towards Mu Yuan.

“It’s Ren Xingchen. Heavens, what is he trying to do?”

The young man next to him cried out in alarm.

Mu Yuan, who had been locked onto by the terrifying killing intent, had a drastic change in expression. When he turned around and saw Ren Xingchen charging at him, a trace of fear flashed across his eyes.

Ren Xingchen. He had naturally heard of this name and had seen his battles before.

A terrifying genius with dual attributes of gold and water, a half-step void interpretation level strength. He was an almost invincible existence under the void interpretation level.

Looking at the signature gold-clad sword, he recognized Ren Xingchen at a glance.

Even if he was arrogant and didn’t put anyone in his eyes, he didn’t even put this nameless genius in his eyes.

But towards Ren Xingchen, he knew that he was absolutely not a match for him.

“Flourish and Bloom!”

Ren Xingchen hurriedly waved his hand in front of him, and countless vines on the ground blocked the gold-clad sword.

He hurriedly retreated.

“Ren Xingchen, I have no enmity with you, why did you attack me!”

He said with a gloomy face.

“Because of you, you deserve to die!”

The terrifying metal and water attributes on Ren Xingchen’s body were fully unleashed, and he directly unleashed his divine ability, slashing towards him.

“I...”

Hearing his words, Mu Yuan’s face revealed a sullen expression.

Should I die?

F * ck, how could there be such a reason!

“This Ren Xingchen is too violent. Why did he attack directly? Moreover, his attack contained killing intent. He wants to kill Mu Yuan!”

“What Ren Xingchen said just now was that you don’t have the qualifications to be on par with him. In that case, Ren Xingchen is acting on behalf of the Nameless Heaven’s favorite!”

“The Nameless Heaven’s favorite and Ren Xingchen have a good relationship? He actually caused Ren Xingchen to be filled with killing intent!”

“This is really a series of twists and turns. Even Ren Xingchen, who is ranked third on the prodigy roll, has appeared. Oh My God!”

Ren Xingchen’s sudden attack and sudden disruption caused everyone to be stunned.

Even Ling Jian ‘er and Wang Xian were slightly stunned.

This Ren Xingchen was too violent. He didn’t say a word and just killed him directly!

“This guy recognized me?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and looked at Ren Xingchen.

“Are you going to make a move?”

He looked at Ling Jian ‘er and asked calmly.

“You...”

Ling Jian ‘er opened her mouth.

“Kill him!”

Wang Xian didn’t wait for her to finish her sentence. He waved the scabbard in his hand.

A golden glow attacked the surroundings.

The combination of metal and water. Wang Xian liked this move very much. He would swing his arm over and the golden glow would sweep through everything.

“Ahhhhhhh!”

Wang Xian’s sudden attack caused screams to ring out from the surroundings.

More than ten people died in one strike. Only two young men who were at the half-step void interpretation realm were able to withstand Wang Xian’s casual attack.

Ling Jian ‘er was stunned. She stared at Han Mingshan and shouted, “Kill!”

The bright golden light instantly attacked him.

“Kill! Kill them all!”

Ren Xingchen’s appearance and Wang Xian’s sudden attack had killed more than ten people. Ling Jian ‘ER’s attack made Han Mingshan Roar in anger as he went up to meet her head-on.

“Leave that Mu Yuan to me!”

Wang Xian used a horizontal sweep to intimidate the remaining twenty or so people who were surrounding them. He looked at Mu Yuan, who was being suppressed by Ren Xingchen. A faint sneer appeared on his face.

“Yes!”

Ren Xingchen didn’t dare to disobey him. He immediately retreated from the position where he was attacking Ren Xingchen.

“Let me see what qualifications you have!”

Wang Xian flew straight towards Mu Yuan. The sword in his hand was still unsheathed.

It was still of the metal attribute.

It was a supernatural ability, the golden tear void!

“Damn it!”

Mu Yuan’s forehead was covered in cold sweat. When he saw that Ren Xingchen was no longer attacking him, he heaved a sigh of relief.

He stared at Wang Xian and his chest was filled with killing intent.

He wanted to vent his anger on this D * MN Fellow.

“Wood knotted strangle!”

Faced with Wang Xian’s divine ability, he also used his divine ability and attacked the gold-splitting void.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The two powerful divine abilities collided.

However, what shocked Mu Yuan was that his wood knotted strangle was directly penetrated by the golden needles.

The terrifying golden light covered his body. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Mu Zang!”

His pupils couldn’t help but shrink as his body emitted a dazzling green light.

On the ground, thorns as thick as an arm directly coiled around his body.

Mu Zang, a wood attribute divine ability.

This move, Mu Zang, could both attack the enemy and protect himself. It was the divine ability he was most proud of.

“Pu Pu Pu!”

However, when the golden rays of light attacked, his wooden burial was easily shattered.

Countless rays of golden light pierced through his body.
