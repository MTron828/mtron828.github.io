Chapter 1475: 1475 under the heartless sword path sect

The goddess of Desolation rode a 10,000-meter-long giant beast and destroyed a first-rate family. From then on, she entered the stage of the vast region.

The goddess of desolation occupied the sea of desolation. One Man and one beast became an existence that was superior to first-rate forces.

Even the three super forces had to be respectful to the goddess of desolation.

However, the terrifying human being in front of them might not be as huge as the giant beast of the goddess of desolation, but its head, which was three to four kilometers long, still looked extremely terrifying.

Wang Xian’s dragon eyes, which were the size of a house, stared at the two figures. He opened his mouth and a destructive energy shot forward.

The destructive energy of the five elements, which covered a radius of four kilometers, shot out from his mouth and engulfed the two swordmasters.

“Oh no, it’s this terrifying energy again!”

The expressions of the two swordmasters changed drastically. The golden crown on their heads shot out a terrifying golden light that enveloped their bodies.

“Zi Zi Zi!”

The five elements annihilation energy covered them. The corrosive energy caused the golden light to quickly disappear.

“Die!”

At this moment, a terrifying dragon claw descended from the sky and covered their entire sky.

“Break him!”

“Allheaven Sword!”

The two swordmasters clenched their teeth and roared loudly when they saw the terrifying dragon claw descending from the sky.

They raised the sharp swords in their hands and spun them rapidly like a tornado.

The sharp swords pierced through Wang Xian’s Dragon Claw.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

When the sharp swords landed on the Dragon Claw, the terrifying metal killing attack immediately created a five-meter-wide hole.

“Charge out!”

The two of them roared. The sharp sword reached a depth of ten meters in an attempt to pierce through Wang Xian’s Dragon Claw.

“Ants!”

Wang Xian stared at them with a cold smile on his face. He clenched his Dragon Claw forcefully.

A human was indeed like an ant in a dragon claw that was three to four kilometers in size.

Their sharp sword pierced through a wound that was five meters wide and ten meters deep. Wang Xian couldn’t even feel any pain.

Such a wound could only be considered as a superficial wound in front of such a huge body.

Boom! Boom! Boom

When Wang Xian’s dragon claws reached down, it was as though a planet had exploded to the two swordmasters.

Waves of terrifying energy were squeezing towards them.

“No!”

Despair appeared on their faces as the destructive energy landed on their bodies.

The Dragon Claw was completely clenched!

“With my current strength, it shouldn’t be too much of a problem for me to kill three opponents at the seventh level of the Seethrough Realm!”

Wang Xian revealed a smile on his face. His huge dragon eyes penetrated through the clouds and looked towards the sky high sword sect.

He opened his dragon claw and waved it gently towards the area below.

Two corpses fell towards the area below.

Wang Xian’s body moved and transformed into a human form. The five elements millstone shrunk rapidly and landed under his feet.

“Bang! Bang!”

At the area below, the corpses of the two swordmasters landed heavily on a ship with a loud sound.

When the two swordmasters fell from the sky, the experts from the families around them noticed them.

Looking at the familiar clothes, the two corpses seemed to have fallen onto their hearts.

“Those two... Those two corpses are the sword masters of the towering Sky Sword sect. Oh My God, the two sword masters have been killed!”

“It’s over, it’s over. The towering sky sword sect is completely finished. The Sword Masters are dead, and there’s nothing they can do about it!”

The experts looked at the two lifeless corpses with their mouths Agape as they muttered.

Their gazes swept across the surroundings, and their expressions were somewhat dazed.

The towering sky sword sect, a huge sect that had stood tall in the vast region for 4,000 years, had been destroyed.

It had been destroyed at a terrifying speed.

“The two swordmasters are dead. I surrender, I Surrender!”

“It’s over, it’s over. Run, the swordmasters are dead. Let’s Run!”

Not long after, the two swordmasters’deaths were discovered by the disciples of the towering Sky Sword sect.

When they saw this situation, the entire towering sky sword sect completely collapsed.

Some of the experts directly shouted for surrender.

There were also some who fled in fear.

There were not many people, only about a thousand people.

Because the rest had already been killed in the battle just now.

“Haha, Haha, an unexpected disaster, an unexpected disaster, the heavens want to destroy our towering sky sword sect!”

When the sect master of the towering Sky Sword sect saw this scene, he roared in despair, his face filled with madness.

The towering sky sword sect had been destroyed!

“Your last backer has been destroyed. Now, it’s Your Turn!”

From below, Ren Xingchen saw this scene and a grateful expression appeared on his face. He looked at Song Wan and the remaining ten or so members of the song clan as he brandished the sword of slaughter in his hand!

Despair had long filled their hearts. They had already lost the ability to resist.

The only thing in their minds were regret and regret!

Wang Xian stood about 500 meters above the sea. He scanned his surroundings and looked around indifferently.

“Sir, thank you. You have saved my life again. I, Ren Xingchen, have no way to repay you. I will definitely go through fire and water in the future!”

At this moment, Ren Xingchen flew over. He knelt in the air with a respectful expression and kowtowed to Wang Xian to express his gratitude.

“No Need!”

Wang Xian shook his head faintly and looked at the battlefield that was about to end.

Ren Xingchen looked over as well. A hint of bitterness appeared on his face.

He knew the reason why Sir Wang didn’t need him at all. It was because any one of the 200 experts that he brought along could easily kill him!

He was of no use to Lord Wang at all.

It was also because of this that Ren Xingchen was even more grateful. From saving him in the tomb of the demi-human, to now, he had even helped him to destroy a terrifying force.

He had no way to repay him. He could only secretly swear that he would repay him with his life in the future.

“Reporting to Dragon King, kill all the experts and disciples of the Atlas Sword Sect!”

When the last scream was heard, Ao Jian flew to the front of Wang Xian and reported respectfully.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and looked at the towering and majestic towering Sky Sword Peak.

“Treat the towering sky sword sect as our base!”

Wang Xian said plainly. His gaze swept across the row of golden swordfish in front of him and announced, “Change the towering sky sword sect to the heartless sword sect. Ao Jian, you will be the sect master!”

“Ren Xingchen, you have joined first. I will need you to handle the matter of finding Ling Jian ‘er!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he looked at Ren Xingchen.

“Yes, Sir!”

Ren Xingchen did not hesitate and nodded immediately.

Although he had joined the Heavenly Sword sect, the sect master of the current Heavenly Sword sect had already come to the vast region to find his daughter.

Obviously, Lord Wang had brought so many people here to look for Ling Jian ‘ER.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Jian also nodded his head heavily and stood up.

“The towering sky sword sect has been destroyed. Today, our heartless sword path sect is established. Three days later, we will be hosting a banquet for all the forces within a thousand kilometers!”

Wang Xian floated in the sky and his voice reverberated within a few hundred kilometers!
