Chapter 617: Wait While I Kill Them (4)

“Pyro Cell!”

The voice that seemed to have passed through the void sounded again as Hong Yan stretched out his finger and pointed at Wang Xian and Roving Sword.

Pyro Cell!

The moment his voice was heard, flames that shone like sunlight encircled Wang Xian and Roving Sword immediately.

The flames slowly blended together, forming a three-meter-tall flaming cage.

There were no flames rising from the entire flaming cage as the domineering red and gold fire had already coagulated into a real solid cage.

Pyro Cell!

Sss...

“This is the usual means of an Immortal!”

They saw the Immortal trapping the duo with a cage that suddenly appeared out of nowhere. All the surrounding elders revealed a surprised look.

Two tricky enemies were now easily trapped by the Immortal Excellency.

This was the mightiness of an Immortal, a daunting power!

“Hong Yan Excellency, I propose killing them right away. Since they killed so many of our men, we cannot let them off!”

“Yes, kill them all!”

One by one, the elders exclaimed. They glowered at Wang Xian and Roving Sword with eyes full of killing intent.

“Someone from the Age of Dharma Decline has actually caused you people to be so passive. All of you should practice hard in the future because Yong Chang is going to descend into the real world!” said Hong Yan nonchalantly to them with a slight dissatisfying tone.

“Yes, Hong Yan Excellency is right!”

The elders hurriedly responded with respect.

“Mm!”

Hong Yan nodded impassively as he looked at Wang Xian and Roving Sword. Without any emotion in his voice, he said, “Great talents. You are the unparallelled talents even in Yong Chang world, but you should not kill people over here! Since you have killed someone over here, bear the consequences now!”

“Hong Yan Excellency is going to strike!”

“Phew, luckily our Sect Leader came here in time. Otherwise, who knows how many lives we were going to lose just to kill them off!”

“The two of them were too wickedly strong. However, our Sect Leader will surely kill them off easily if he strikes!”

Upon hearing the words from Hong Yan Excellency, all the elders were slightly relieved.

“Phew, finally the Dragon King is going to be killed!”

“No matter how demon-like the people from the real world are, they will get sanctioned for being insolent in Yong Chang world!”

“Hong Yan Excellency is simply too strong. A finger of his can kill the Dragon King and Roving Sword!”

Those disciples below who saw this also heaved a sigh of relief.

The scene of Roving Sword killing their elders was too horrifying!

As such, they let out a sigh of relief when the group of supreme talents saw that the Immortal expert was here.

Now, they had developed a fear for Dragon King and Roving Sword.

“Is that so?”

Wang Xian looked at the Hong Yan who overlooked them, ready to sentence them. Wang Xian curved his lips slightly. He was an Immortal, the first one that he had met.

His mouth quirked slightly as he stared at Hong Yan. “I would really like to find out the consequences!”

Wang Xian said as he looked at Roving Sword, “Stop him while I kill a few more people!”

“Yes, Dragon King!”

Roving Sword respectfully nodded.

“You’re already the meat on the plate...”

When an elder heard what Wang Xian said, he replied with coldness and disdain.

However, his voice came to an abrupt halt.

In the eyes of many, the Pyro Cell around Wang Xian collapsed straightaway. The one that was trapping Roving Sword also crashed directly.

Blue water energy and a golden metal virtual image appeared around them.

Blue, the sacred color!

Gold, the noble color!

The colors that could compete with the sun slowly rose from their bodies.

“Feng, Ao, Dong, Liang Family. Well, before I go, I’ll destroy you guys first!”

Wang Xian startled everyone with his nonchalant voice.

Upon seeing the collapsing Pyro Cell, solemness swept across the calm-looking face of Hong Yan.

“Stop moving!”

Roving Sword held his longsword up and pointed it at Hong Yan.

It was just a simple action, but what shocked everyone the most was all the long metallic swords in all directions turned to Hong Yan.

Each of the swords contained fearsome energy.

“What’s going on?”

An elder could not help but shiver as he stared at Wang Xian and Roving Sword in disbelief.

“Immortal Realm, I didn’t expect that you two could advance to the Immortal Realm!”

As soon as Hong Yan spoke, he looked stern. He stole a few glances at the longswords around him, and the sword radiance struck a slight terror in him.

He looked at Wang Xian again, and the blue energy that was similar to sun rays glowing from behind him. The domineering power in it caused his expression to turn dreadful.

“Great Waterfall Water Shockwave!”

Before anyone could react, the horrifying energy burst out from Wang Xian’s body immediately.

As a pivot in the center, the daunting water region spread out at a fascinating speed.

Om!

In an instant, the Great Waterfall Water Shockwave shrouded an area with a radius of ten kilometers.

All the people around, including the hundreds of thousands of disciples from the three Immortal Sects were encompassed by the Great Waterfall Water Shockwave!

“No!”

Yet, the one comment that Hong Yan made struck horror in all the elders and disciples from the three Immortal Sects.

As they watched the water region besieging them, fear welled up in their eyes.

“Great Waterfall Water Shockwave! The High-class battle techniques that only those in the Immortal class can release. He’s an Immortal!”

“Roving Sword is also an Immortal. He has locked onto Hong Yan Excellency. This...”

Everyone felt like they were being thrown off into a fugue state.

Now that they were amid the water region, only Hong Yan Excellency was holding their ground. Yet, he was being locked onto by the surrounding longswords.

Even the Immortal-class Hong Yan Excellency was locked onto, and dared not act recklessly!

This struck fear into them.

“Great Waterfall Water Shockwave! We’re actually within the attack range of an Immortal!”

“Gosh, both of them are Immortals. No wonder they could easily kill the elders.”

“Since we’re amid the water region of an Immortal, it would be just too easy for him to kill us all!”

When the hundreds of thousands of disciples realized they had entered the water region, their bodies trembled even though the water did not attack them.

But the oppression from an Immortal caused a sense of worship to surge from within them. Their lives were completely in the hands of the Dragon King.

A Dragon King who had come from the real world was an Immortal-class existence. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Hong Yan peered around as he saw all the disciples from three major Immortal Sects were shrouded by Great Waterfall Water Shockwave. His face grimaced.

“Don’t be reckless!” Hong Yan stared at Wang Xian with a sullen look. “Otherwise, you’ll not walk out of Yong Chang!”

“Don’t worry. I’ll leave after I kill some people. Does the Immortal of Yong Chang world agree with this?”

As Wang Xian scorned, the five longswords beside him began to spin.

He swept his gaze across everyone. “I’m the Dragon King of the Dragon Sect from the real world. Let me give you a piece of advice. When Yong Chang world descends into the real world, keep a low profile and don’t offend me!”

“Feng Family, Ao Family, Dong Family, Liang Family... step forward to receive your judgment!”
