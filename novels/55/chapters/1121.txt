“With the power of the Heavenly Moon Soul Chaser, the Black Fiend Battle Team of the Star Moon Army, and the soldiers of the ocean cultivator army, we can deal with this group of people!”

Xing Guang’s eyes flickered as he stared at the 1,000 plus people of the Dragon and Phoenix Army.

The strength of these 1,000 plus people was already comparable to the strongest army in Star Moon Kingdom, and was even slightly stronger.

This time, if it wasn’t for the Heavenly Moon sect’s presence, they really didn’t have the slightest bit of confidence.

“It’s also fortunate that His Highness is wise enough to send our star-moon Army’s Black Fiend Battle Team!”

Standing beside Xing Guang, the star-moon Army’s deputy commander, Ju Xiuwei, who held a red staff in his hand, slightly narrowed his eyes as he spoke indifferently.

The Black Fiend Battle team was the strongest battle team in star-moon Kingdom’s strongest army, the star-moon army.

It could be said that the black fiend battle team was the strongest battle team in the entire star-moon kingdom. Only the cream of the crop in the army had the qualifications to enter this battle team.

The battle team had a total of 2,000 people, but there were dozens of extraordinary ninth rank experts among them. There were even quite a number of half-step void interpretation experts.

One should never underestimate the strength of a kingdom. With thousands of years of foundation and hundreds of millions of citizens, the possibility of nurturing dozens of extraordinary ninth rank experts was still very high.

This was especially so for some kingdoms. In order to nurture elite warriors, they would nurture bloodline warriors.

For example, the half-step void interpretation bloodline that Wang Xian sold last time. After a kingdom purchased it, they would nurture such bloodline warriors.

With the support of the kingdom, it was possible to nurture dozens of half-step void interpretation warriors.

The captain of the Black Fiend Battle team was an expert with the Black Fiend Beast bloodline. His bloodline level had reached the peak. The ferocious beasts under him were also at the half-step void interpretation level. When combined with the Black Fiend Beast, their strength was extremely terrifying.

This was also one of the reasons why Feng Luan’s expression was grave when she heard the Black Fiend Battle team.

“Star Moon Kingdom’s warriors, kill this group of intruders for me. Kill this group of traitors!”

Ju Xiuwei raised the staff in his hand and gave an order.

“Kill!”

“Roar Roar Roar!”

An angry roar and the roar of a fierce beast.

In the middle of the two soldiers, a group of two thousand soldiers who were emitting a terrifying aura were clad in black armor.

The armor covered their entire bodies, leaving only a pair of cold eyes.

Beneath them was a three to four meter long beast. The Beast was also completely black, even its eyes were black.

They had two huge fangs, and their limbs were covered with dense spikes. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The order to attack had been given, and the Beast began to roar.

“Kill!”

The 20,000 soldiers at the back, ranging from transcendent level four to half-step void interpretation, charged forward in a frenzy.

The advantage in numbers and the earth-shattering roars caused the entire dragon and Phoenix city to tremble.

“They are going to fight together!”

“There are too many of them!”

“Damn it, are they going to fight with me? Kill them!”

Some of the citizens in the formation of Dragon and Phoenix City revealed furious expressions. Some of them even charged out with furious expressions.

“Can we deal with them?”

At this moment, Wang Xian saw Feng Luan who was standing in front of him. He walked over and asked in a deep voice.

“Yes!”

Feng Luan looked at the 20,000 enemies who were charging over. A faint smile appeared on her face. “As long as star-moon kingdom does not deploy all their forces, we can deal with them!”

“Mang Hong and the rest can also deal with the five insightful emptiness realm experts!”

“That’s Good!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

Whoosh

At this moment, a voice that Wang Xian was familiar with came through the formation and charged towards the battlefield outside.

Wang Xian was stunned for a moment before he frowned.

“Ao Jian, you guys go and protect her. The other five strange demons are also following by her side!”

Wang Xian said immediately.

Hearing his anxious voice, Feng Luan, Guan Shuqing, and the other girls looked at the figure who was charging towards the battlefield. They were slightly enlightened and glared at Wang Xian.

“With just you people, you still want to destroy our dragon-phoenix Empire? Dream On! Face the enemy!”

Mang Hong roared.

“Kill!”

The more than 1,000 soldiers of the dragon-phoenix Army also started to move. Even if it was 1,000 against 20,000, they did not show any signs of weakness.

They did not even lose in terms of imposing manner.

In the sky, the five insightful emptiness realm experts from star-moon kingdom fixed their eyes on Mang Hong and the other two.

Mang Hong and the other two did not show any signs of weakness. They gripped the weapons in their hands tightly, ready to fight at any moment.

Soldiers versus soldiers!

Generals versus generals!

In the face of an overwhelming power, no one dared to act rashly.

“General Xing, there’s no need for us to act in a hurry. Today, we’ll let everyone see the Heavenly Moon Soul Chaser that can match up to you!”

The Heavenly Moon Sect’s vice sect master, Tian Yue Xing Hua, revealed a faint smile on his face as he spoke to Xing Guang Hun.

“Tian Yue chases the soul and seeks death, killing enemies thousands of miles away. Today, I want to experience it!”

Xing Guang Hun smiled and said.

“Okay!”

Tian Yue Xing hua revealed a proud expression.

“Tian Yue, chases the soul!”

He shouted softly.

At this moment, at the back of the army, there was a group of 500 people. Their clothes did not fit the soldiers in front of them.

There was no armor on their bodies, only a green light armor.

When Tian Yue Xing Hua finished speaking, the arms of the 500 people shook.

Gorgeous bows and arrows appeared in their hands.

The 500 people narrowed their eyes and a trace of coldness appeared in their eyes. A special metal bow and arrow appeared on the bow.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Before the two armies collided, terrifying arrows shot toward the dragon and Phoenix Army.

“Defend!”

The deputy commander at the front of the Dragon and Phoenix Legion saw the incoming arrows and his expression changed slightly.

A huge earth shield appeared in front of him.

The rest of the people hurriedly defended.

Because there were fewer people, the moment they blocked the arrows, the momentum completely disappeared!

“Ah!”

“Ah Ah Ah Ah!”

However, at this moment, a scream was heard.

The expression of the vice leader of the Dragon and Phoenix Legion changed slightly.

Mang Hong, who was floating in the sky, also had a huge change in expression. He looked down and found that more than ten people had been hit by arrows and were instantly heavily injured.

He stared ahead and his expression instantly darkened.

The five hundred people didn’t have the slightest expression as they drew their bows again and aimed!

“Tian Yue, Soul Chaser!”

The five hundred people shouted at the same time, and five hundred terrifying arrows attacked once again.

“Not good, it’s the Heavenly Moon Sect’s Heavenly Moon Soul Chaser!”

Feng Luan, who was standing at the back, had a huge change in expression. “The Heavenly Moon sect actually used all of their elites!”

“It’s the Heavenly Moon Soul Chaser. Oh My God, it’s the Heavenly Moon sect’s strongest trump card!”

“Heavenly Moon Soul Chaser, it’s The Heavenly Moon Soul Chaser. In the past, star-moon kingdom had two large sects, but in the end, the Heavenly Moon sect was directly destroyed in the battle. At that time, the Heavenly Moon Sect’s Heavenly Moon Soul Chaser was famous throughout the world, and even the star-moon royal family was extremely fearful of it!”

Within dragon-phoenix city, when some of the citizens heard their voices, shock appeared on their faces.

The Heavenly Moon Soul Chaser, one arrow killing!
