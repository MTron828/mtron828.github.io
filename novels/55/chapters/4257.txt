“Let’s go. Let’s go hunt the cosmic behemoth of the Centipede Beast Emperor!”

Wang Xian said to Tianci Hun.

With a wave of his arm, he opened up the channel where the Netherworld Dragon was chasing after him!

The energy enveloped Tianci Hun and they entered the channel where the Netherworld Dragon was chasing after them!

Buzz

In the next moment, they arrived at the side of the Centipede Beast Emperor!

The locking force of the wind and thunder was extremely powerful. It would take at least a few years for the Beast Emperor to recover from Wang Xian’s attack and get rid of the wind and thunder force in his body.

During this period of time, as long as the distance was not too far away, Wang Xian would be able to teleport and chase after the Beast Emperor!

When Wang Xian arrived at the side of the Beast Emperor, the Beast Emperor was flying forward rapidly.

Clearly, the incident just now had cast a shadow on him. He wanted to get as far away from that place as possible!

Wang Xian’s appearance caused the Centipede Beast Emperor to sense something.

His gigantic head looked towards the side!

“Don’t let him escape. Seal him completely!”

When Wang Xian saw this scene, his eyes focused as he shouted at the heaven-bestowed chaos and the rest!

Boom! Boom! Boom

At the same time, the body of the Void Dragon moved. Numerous sharp swords of the innate supreme treasure level floated in the surrounding void, completely surrounding Beast Emperor Wu.

The terrifying power of space sealed everything in the surroundings, preventing him from using any means to escape!

Tian CI also focused his gaze. Numerous branches were twining around his body!

The dense and huge branches also surrounded the entire beast emperor centipede in the middle!

“Roar!”

Wang Xian let out a low roar and immediately transformed into his divine dragon form. He carried an invincible aura as he attacked Beast Emperor Centipede!

“Roar!”

Beast Emperor Centipede could feel Wang Xian’s aura and a look of fear appeared on his face.

He wanted to escape in a hurry!

However, Wang Xian was too close to him!

The dragon claws clawed at his body. He opened his mouth and spewed out a torrent of energy!

“Roar!”𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Beast Emperor Centipede Wu revealed a violent expression when he saw Wang Xian’s attack.

He turned his body and the tens of thousands of poisonous claws clawed at Wang Xian’s body.

Similarly, the terrifying head opened a huge and sharp mouth and bit at Wang Xian’s Head!

Boom

However, in the next instant, Wang Xian’s energy torrent landed on his head and penetrated his head.

The Centipede Beast Emperor’s tens of thousands of poisonous claws grabbed onto Wang Xian’s body and produced a metallic sound.

He couldn’t break Wang Xian’s dragon scales at all.

Although this centipede Beast Emperor was very strong, there was still a huge gap between him and Wang Xian!

Crack! Crack! Crack

The head of the Centipede Beast Emperor was pierced through. His eyes revealed a look of fear and madness.

In the next instant, his head was directly cut off. A new head grew out and directly swallowed the head that was pierced through!

Bang

Wang Xian was in close combat with the Centipede Beast Emperor. At this moment, he grabbed the body of the Centipede Beast Emperor with his dragon claws and used his two dragon claws to attack!

A terrifying energy directly cut off his body!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Beast Emperor Centipede let out a shrill cry again!

His body was split into two.

A large amount of poisonous liquid covered Wang Xian.

The poisonous liquid corroded everything around him!

At the spot where he was split into two, a head grew out. It shook its huge body rapidly in an attempt to escape!

Two sections of the body, one to the left and the other to the right!

Wang Xian stared at the two sections of the Centipede Beast Emperor’s body. A cold look appeared in his eyes!

Buzz Buzz

At this moment, the Void Dragon’s body and heaven-bestowed chaos and the others locked onto half of the Centipede Beast Emperor’s body and launched their attacks.

Numerous void swords slashed towards half of the Centipede Beast Emperor’s body.

Streams of thorns wrapped around Centipede Beast Emperor’s body!

The void swords sliced the half of his body into pieces again.

The heaven-bestowed thorns pierced through his body and grew crazily in his flesh and blood!

Wang Xian stared at the other half of Centipede Beast Emperor’s body. Streams of chains gathered around him.

Nine chains, nine colors, containing nine terrifying powers!

The chains directly wrapped around Beast Emperor Centipede!

“Hualala!”

The endless chains completely wrapped around half of Beast Emperor Centipede’s body, piercing into his flesh and blood.

The elemental energy belonging to the chains corroded his body, wearing away his vitality!

“Ao ao ao ao!”

Beast Emperor Centipede once again let out an incomparably miserable cry.

His body suddenly collapsed again, turning into countless tens of thousands of meters small centipede Beast Emperor.

They broke free from the entanglement and penetration of the chains and fled in fear!

On the other side, the other half of his body also turned into countless small centipedes and fled in all directions!

“Thousand leaves Kill!”

Seeing the small centipedes beast emperor, Tianci’s eyes focused, and the divine tree of creation behind him trembled slightly.

Countless terrifying leaves shot towards the Centipede Beast Emperor!

When the leaves landed on the small-sized centipede Beast Emperor’s body, they started to take root and sprout rapidly.

They turned into numerous trees that floated in the air.

“Roar!”

From the trees, the Centipede Beast Emperor’s shrill cry could be heard!

“Space Lock!”

Wang Xian’s gaze focused. In order to prevent the Centipede Beast Emperor from escaping, he immediately took out the fragment of the galaxy and used the Space Lock’s power!

The surrounding void changed immediately as stars appeared out of thin air!

“Dragon tomb suppression!”

Wang Xian shouted in a low voice. An incomparably huge dragon tomb appeared and swept towards the small-sized Beast Emperor Centipede!

The terrifying dragon tomb seemed as though it was going to bury everything!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The small-sized beast emperor centipede let out maniacal roars.

Each of them raised their heads and spat out a ball of blood-red venom!

The venom gathered in everything and contained an energy that could destroy the world.

This drop of Venom was escaping into the distance at a terrifying speed!

“You want to escape?”

Wang Xian’s eyes turned cold. He opened his dragon mouth and an illusory divine dragon head appeared in front of him.

The dragon mouth directly swallowed the drop of Venom!

“Roar!”

The dragon mouth caught up to the venom at an unbelievable speed and swallowed it in one gulp!

“Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle!”

The entire dragon head let out a sound of corrosion and the majestic energy started to turn illusory bit by bit!

“HMM? As expected of the life-and-death counterattack of a control-level space beast. This vitality is dozens of times stronger than the king of all gods who believes in the universe!”

Wang Xian focused his gaze. The Tai Chi Dragon Disc brought with it the power of augmentation as it surrounded the dragon head that was devouring the venom.

The Tai Chi Dragon disc landed on the illusory dragon head, causing the entire dragon head to become more solid as if it was real!

“I can’t escape!”

Wang Xian focused his gaze and continued to attack the small-sized Centipede Beast Kings!
