Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

9.20 am. 10 more minutes to the official opening of Longxuan Restaurant.

At this moment, Director Xie and Lin Qingying were standing on the platform with the restaurant manager, the chief chef and Director Xie’s brother. Everyone had a bright and radiant smile on them!

“And now we will have the ribbon-cutting ceremony to commemorate Longxuan Restaurant’s opening and to wish them a bright future ahead!”

The ribbon-cutting ceremony is complete!

Director Xie’s face was wreathed with smiles as he took over the microphone and looked at the densely packed crowd in front of him.

At this moment, the streets had been congested with people. There were at least 700-800 people gathered here and this made him pleasantly satisfied.

“First, I’d like to welcome everyone who is here to witness the opening of Longxuan Restaurant. As the beautiful Lin Qingying has introduced, our Longxuan Restaurant has a long history and a range of top-quality seafood. Today marks the beginning of Longxuan Restaurant in Rivertown and this will signify Longxuan Restaurant becoming the best, the most luxurious and the most delicious seafood restaurant in Rivertown!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Our Longxuan Restaurant has always liked to prove it with our strength. In five minutes’ time, we will be opening officially. Everyone could come in and try our food. I believe that the top-quality seafood in our Longxuan Restaurant will be far superior to those in the nearby First-grade Restaurant. Atlantic Bluefin Marlin sashimi! We have it! Two-headed abalone! We have it! Top-quality caviar! We have it! Australian lobsters and King Crab! We have them too! We have every kind of top-quality seafood you can imagine!”

Director Xie spoke confidently. He was in a state of exuberance and had a confident disposition. Following which, the doors to Longxuan Restaurant were opened as he waved his hand.

A huge fish was placed right at the main door.

“This is a little benefit to commemorate the opening of our restaurant, large-sized grouper! It weighs over 300 catties and the market price of it is more than $100 per catty. As long as you eat in our restaurant today, we will be giving you a serving for free.”

“Wow, what a big fish!’

“Grouper! The price of grouper isn’t cheap. It’s over $100 per catty!”

“This grouper is really huge! Doesn’t this mean that this alone is worth $30,000 to $40,000? Longxuan Restaurant is really generous to give it out for free!”

“Rich! This Longxuan Restaurant is simply rich! Disregarding the publicity over the last few days, one could easily tell its strength by its ability to invite Lin Qingying over. Moreover, the range of top-quality seafood is really wide here!”

Some people looked at that huge grouper in awe. How extravagant! Awesome!

The lips of Director Xie curved into a smile and he was very satisfied with the reactions of the crowd. He smiled faintly at the people below the platform who were busy taking photos with their mobile phones.

However, there was a batch of people who were surprisingly not shocked. On the contrary, they were commenting softly, “It’s just a grouper! This is a far cry from First-grade Restaurant!”

“Yeah. Is this all they got? Why does it feel that they are miles behind First-grade Restaurant? Yet they dare to claim to be far ahead of First-grade Restaurant!”

This group of people was puzzled while looking at Director Xie acting cocky on the platform.

“Boss, is everything going at 50% of its original price?” A voice of a middle-aged man sounded suddenly. The crowd looked towards Director Xie and was waiting for his reply.

“Everything in our restaurant is going at 50% of the original price. This includes the drinks.” Director Xie smiled. However, he quickly added, “Naturally, some stuff couldn’t possibly be going at 50%. For example, the two-headed abalone. We have spent a lot of effort to get them from Australia and therefore these will be sold at the original price of $450,000. Besides that, Atlantic Bluefin Marlin and caviar will also not be at 50%. I believe everyone knows the prices of these.”

“However!” Director Xie’s face was still brimming with confidence. “Our Australian Lobsters and King Crab will be going at 50%. Just think about being able to have these for slightly over $1,000 when one typically costs $2,000-$3,000! Isn’t this great!”

“Our Longxuan Restaurant is really extravagant and generous. The price of a meal would be just $5,000 if it costs $10,000 initially. This is a once in a blue moon opportunity! Moreover, our promotional activities will only be for today and over the next few days. Today, we have the highest discount of 50%.” The manager added from the side.

“That’s a really good deal!”

“It’s a perfect deal! Even Australian Lobsters and King Crab are going for half price. This is simply too cheap.”

“Longxuan Restaurant is taking a loss with each sale! Awesome, awesome!”

The crowd couldn’t contain their surprise as they exclaimed.

Director Xie had also invited some members of the media to record this event. They were taking photos constantly to prepare for future publications.

They had already thought of the headlines. For example, “Extravagant Longxuan Restaurant! Everything at just 50% on the opening day! Top-quality seafood waiting for you to enjoy!”

“The most extravagant restaurant! The most luxurious restaurant! The most delicious restaurant! Top-quality restaurant awaits your arrival!”

However, there was a group of people looking at Director Xie and the manager with a weird expression.

A middle-aged man couldn’t contain himself and remarked loudly, “Please pardon me for my honest words! If this is all you have, I’m afraid Longxuan Restaurant has a long way to go to overtake First-grade Restaurant!”

“Yeah. To exclude Atlantic Bluefin Marlin, two-headed abalone and other top-tier ingredients from discounts, you guys are miles behind First-grade Restaurant!”

“Yeah. First-grade Restaurant is also having a promotional event today and all the ingredients in the restaurant are going at half price. Even a one-headed abalone is at half price. Think about it! A $2 million one-headed abalone going at half price!”

“I thought Longxuan Restaurant would be generous. What a huge discrepancy from expectation!”

When the middle-aged man spoke, those customers that were waiting for First-grade Restaurant’s opening couldn’t hold back anymore and seconded.

After five to six people had spoken, the crowd was stunned.

Director Xie was also taken aback and looked sternly at those people. “You guys are probably hired by First-grade Restaurant to cause trouble here! With First-grade Restaurant’s capabilities, there’s no way it has the strength to compete with Longxuan Restaurant. We are at least two tiers ahead!”

Director Xie’s words angered those people. We were hired? They naturally wouldn’t be happy about being accused of being something that they weren’t!

“We are hired? What a joke! We are just regular customers and would go to wherever has the most delicious food and widest range of top-quality ingredients. We are just speaking the truth!”

“That’s right. I really wonder where you find the courage to say that you guys are two tiers above First-grade Restaurant. You guys should take a look at others before saying that.”

“Ignorance! It’s you guys who are inferior by several tiers as compared to First-grade Restaurant and have to rely on a large amount of publicity to gain reputation. You guys should have checked out the difference between Longxuan Restaurant and First-grade Restaurant!”

The customers below the platform grumbled angrily. Since they were accused of being hired, they wouldn’t have to be courteous with Longxuan Restaurant.

“Who would have expected that First-grade Restaurant would send these troublemakers. What a despicable group of people. Security! Throw these people out.” A young man from below the stage was outraged upon seeing the few middle-aged men shouting.

“Interesting! Interesting! We are just speaking the truth. How do you even dare to be so presumptuous in claiming First-grade Restaurant is inferior to you when you haven’t even recognized the true strength of First-grade Restaurant!”

“I’m just going to say this and it isn’t because I’m biased towards First-grade Restaurant. In my opinion, Longxuan Restaurant is just thrash as compared to First-grade Restaurant!”

“You guys are just thrash!”
