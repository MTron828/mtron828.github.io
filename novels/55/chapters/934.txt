Chapter 935: 0936 Bridge Forest Beast Park

Translator: 549690339

“There isn’t a single mercenary group that meets our requirements. We have to set off today, or else the flame flowers will die!”

“In holy sea town, there are no more than five mercenary groups that can pass through the Bridge Forest Beast Park. This is going to be troublesome. Why Don’t we invite the mercenary groups at a high price!”

“Damn it, the living flame flowers can not be put into the interspatial ring. If we can’t find the mercenary groups, the flame flowers will all die. You have to know that as long as we send the flame flowers back, the price will be much higher.”

In the Demon Hunter mercenary group, two middle-aged men were discussing with furrowed brows.

They were the largest business group in bridge forest town, the bridge forest business group. Their business group was definitely the most powerful force in bridge forest town.

This time, they received the news in advance that a monster siege had happened in holy sea town, so they quickly came to holy sea town.

Sure enough, they were not disappointed this time. They obtained a large number of fierce beast corpses.

However, what surprised them the most was that they obtained a batch of raging flame flowers.

Raging Flame Flowers were extraordinary fourth grade spirit herbs.

Raging Flame Flowers were an important ingredient for medicinal pills. They were extremely rare in bridge forest town, and were even in urgent need.

If they could bring these raging flame flowers to bridge forest town, these raging flame flowers would be able to obtain at least fifteen million middle grade spirit stones.

This was equivalent to two years of profit for the Chamber of Commerce!

However, those damn mercenary groups didn’t keep the flowers perfectly when they picked them up.

This caused the flame flowers to need to be used as soon as possible.

Because of the Flame Flowers’special characteristics, they would die quickly if they were put into the interspatial ring.

Therefore, they could only use the original transportation method.

Moreover, they had to reach bridge forest town as fast as possible.

The shortest route between Holy Sea Town and bridge forest town was through the Bridge Forest Beast Park.

The Bridge Forest Beast Park was a huge forest that covered an area of 100 kilometers.

Because the Bridge Forest Beast Park was connected to the Donghua mountain range, it was a paradise for fierce beasts.

Without the power of a rank 5 or 6 transcendent, it was impossible to pass through the Beast Park.

With their strength, it would be difficult for them to pass through, so they had to hire a mercenary group to escort them.

However, the strength of holy sea town was about the same as that of bridge forest town, so it was very difficult to hire a mercenary group of this level.

For the whole morning, no mercenary group came, or perhaps they were not strong enough.

This made them very irritated, and their faces were extremely ugly.

“We’ll raise the commission of the mercenary group. If no mercenary group agrees, we’ll raise the price again. Young master, what do you think?”

A middle-aged man frowned and asked the young man next to him.

“How much profit can we get from this batch of Raging Flame Flowers?”

Among the five people, the only young man frowned and asked.

“Young master, the profit is about fifteen million middle-grade spirit stones, which is the profit of our chamber of Commerce for two years. The raging flame flowers are too precious!”

A middle-aged man next to him replied.

“Increase the commission by one million!”

The young man said with an unpleasant expression.

“Yes, Young Master!”

The middle-aged man nodded and swept his gaze across the surroundings. “Changing the commission will take a few hours. Let’s spread the word in the Chamber of Commerce first. I don’t believe that those mercenary groups won’t be tempted by the huge sum of money!”

The middle-aged man said, he cleared his throat and said, “The gold 4-star mission of the Bridgewood Business Association will be increased by another one million middle-grade spirit stones. We welcome the experts of the hiring association to accept the mission. If everything goes smoothly, we will be able to reach Bridgewood town in two days.”

“HMM?”

Just as Wang Xian was walking over, he suddenly heard the voice of a middle-aged man in front of him. He was slightly stunned before a smile appeared on his face.

An immediate increase of one million middle-grade spirit stones was not a small amount!

“Hiss, an immediate increase of one million middle-grade spirit stones. The Bridgewood Business Association is really rich!”

“It’s a four-star gold-grade mission. We have to face an extraordinary sixth-grade ferocious beast. It’s not something that we can accept!”

The middle-aged man’s voice caused all the members of the hiring association to look shocked as they discussed softly.

“We’ll Take It!”

Wang Xian walked over and said to the five people in front of him with a smile on his face. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Huh?”

The five people were slightly stunned as they looked at Wang Xian.

When they saw his face, everyone was slightly stunned.

“Do you guys have the ability?”

The young man in the middle raised his eyebrows slightly as he sized up Wang Xian.

Finally, his gaze landed on the middle-aged man’s chest. There was a different expression on his face.

“Gold 2-star mercenary group? Call your leader over!”

The young man said to Wang Xian.

“You’re the leader? Are you kidding me? You guys don’t have the ability to accept our mission!”

A middle-aged man shook his head in amusement.

A gold mercenary group was very powerful in Shenghai town. However, with a young man as the leader, they didn’t believe that the other party had the ability to cross the Bridge Forest Beast Park.

“If we don’t have the qualifications, no other mercenary group in Shenghai town would have the qualifications!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly and revealed a strong confidence on his face.

“Then call the leader of your mercenary group over to talk to us. You Don’t have the qualifications yet!”

The young man looked at Wang Xian and said directly with a frown.

“Hey, the leader of the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group is leader Wang. Just as leader Wang said, if leader Wang and the rest aren’t qualified to take on your mission, the entire Shenghai town would be disqualified!”

“That’s right. If captain Wang is not qualified, you can go back on your own. Haha!”

Around them, some members of the mercenary group saw this scene and laughed out loud.

The young man and the rest were slightly stunned. They looked at Wang Xian with a surprised expression and frowned.

“Celestial Phoenix mercenary group, Wang Xian!”

Wang Xian extended his hand and said to the five of them.

“Immortal Phoenix Mercenary Group?”

The five of them had a change in expression. Even though they had only been in holy sea town for a day, they had heard of the name of the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group.

Destroy the illusionary sea mercenary group and the Knife Scar mercenary group.

The current king of the mercenary group in Holy Sea Town was a mercenary group created by a genius, the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group!

“Hello, Captain Wang. With the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group escorting us, we can rest assured!”

“With the remuneration of six million middle-grade spirit stones and one million middle-grade spirit stones from the mercenary group, we will set off immediately if captain Wang agrees!”

A middle-aged man said hurriedly as he sized up Wang Xian in astonishment.

“Alright, we have accepted the mission. You guys can just confirm it!”

Wang Xian nodded.

“Alright, Captain Wang. We are in a hurry. After the mission is completed, we will give you all the Commission!”

The middle-aged man said to Wang Xian.

“Alright, let’s Go!”

Wang Xian nodded and said directly to them.

“Alright, I wonder if leader Wang has anything else to prepare?”

The middle-aged man continued to ask.

“It’s ready. Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.
