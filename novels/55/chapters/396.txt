Chapter 397: Get Out Of Our Territory (1)

“When you were in your human form, your strength was Half-Step to Dan Realm. After you turned into a Skeletal Dragon, your strength is close to Level 11, and the Divine Dragon Level is at 7. The difference is not that huge!” said Wang Xian after watching the strength exhibited by Xiao Yu and Elder Fang within the Dragon Palace.

Both of them were different from him. They had transformed into Divine Dragons through the Dragon Transformation Pool. Hence, their strength was not much different, regardless of whether they were in Dragon or human forms.

However, Wang Xian was transformed into a Divine Dragon through the system. Hence, there were some differences.

Both of them had upgraded their strength to Half-step to Dan Realm from Half-step to Inborn. That was a great leap in the levels. Very soon, they could advance to Dan Realm, and become the legendary existences of the Underworld.

“Too powerful. I’m simply too powerful now. Haha!”

Xiao Yu had excitement all over her face while Elder Fang was overwhelmed too.

She did not expect she could reach such a daunting stage with her strength.

As she looked at Wang Xian, there was an unusual radiance that flashed across her eyes.

If it were not for this young man, she would not have thought of entering the Inborn Realm, not to mention the legendary Dan Realm.

“Xiao Yu, you are much more powerful than me now. All of you are better than me!”

Guan Shuqing walked to Xiao Yu and spoke with envy.

“Hehe, Sister-in-law, why don’t you go into the Dragon Transformation Pool and evolve into a Divine Dragon? In that way, you can also become very powerful!”

Xiao Yu tugged at Guan Shuqing’s arm and spoke while smiling.

“No!” Wang Xian shook his head. “Shuqing has the most prestigious bloodline, and it’s unsafe for her to enter into the pool. Shuqing, I think you’ll be reaching the Inborn Realm soon, right?”

“Yes, soon. I still need at least half a month!” Guan Shuqing smiled. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Let’s have a celebration for Xiao Yu and Elder Fang’s recovery!”

Lan Qingyue smiled as she spoke when the gang came to the Dragon King’s bedroom.

“It’s better to go back to the yacht!” Wang Xian smiled and said after seeing the sizeable messy bed. “I’ll get some men to hunt for some food!”

The six of them came to the yacht above the Dragon Palace as they were happily cooking.

Living on the sea was very relaxing.

Having delicate seafood with a glass of red wine in each of their hands... They gazed upon the beautiful sea, looking extremely loosened up.

“It’s winter vacation. Let’s have some fun on the sea for a few days!”

Wang Xian was lying on the sofa as he suggested this to Xiao Yu, Guan Shuqing, and the rest.

“Sure!”

All of them nodded their heads, smiling from ear to ear. Standing on the deck of the yacht, they were gazing at the vast ocean while enjoying the sea breeze.

“Oh, Qingyue, do you know if there are other places like gambling cruises around the sea?” asked Wang Xian to Lan Qingyue with curiosity.

According to Mo Yuan’s investigation, there were many recreational zones on the vast ocean.

To humans, the vast underwater world was a mystery.

But on the surface of the sea, it was another paradise to the Martial Artists.

Martial Artists were unable to display their remarkable strength in the bustling urban society unless they were out in the sea.

There were many islands out in the sea for leisure and tourism. Most of the places only received the riches and the Martial Artists.

Things that could be found in the sea were nothing average.

Many of the Martial Artists, clans, and families had placed their focus on seeking marine resources, especially when the mainland had been lacking in resources for the last decades.

“My dad told me before that there is a region with cruises. There are food, entertainment and all kinds of leisure activities over there. Let me call my dad and ask him!” Lan Qingyue replied with a smile.

Wang Xian nodded. Even though the Dragon Palace was stationed underwater, he was still unfamiliar with the ocean.

“My dad sent me a coordinate. Let’s go over.”

Soon, Lan Qingyue received a reply and told this to Wang Xian.

“Great, let’s go!” Wang Xian chuckled.

Wang Xian got Mo Qinglong to steer the yacht while the rest were beaming as they headed to one of the recreational spots in the sea.

The recreational spots were closer to land compared to the Dragon Palace. Hence, they had to make their way back.

“Hur?”

“Xiao Xian, look! There are two vessels ahead. It’s about the same as those that we saw the other time!”

As the yacht was sailing along the sea, two vessels that seemed rather familiar appeared before their eyes.

Wang Xian slightly squinted his eyes as he looked over.

The bodies of the vessels were dark in color, looking durable.

There was a banner with a sharp sword flying in the air on the sail.

On the ship stood a mixture of middle-aged men and young men with swords in their hands.

The two vessels were similar to those of three cruises they had encountered not long ago. The only difference was the size of these two vessels. They were much smaller with a size of thirty meters each.

Something white was found on the water surface between the two vessels that looked unusually striking.

Wang Xian and the gang had a clear view this time as it was daytime.

“This is the second time we’ve run into them. What are they doing?”

Lan Qingyue was a little surprised to see the two vessels. They had also been anchored in the middle of the sea the other time. Now, they were doing the same thing.

“Let’s check it out!” Wang Xian told Mo Qinglong and the gang.

He remembered that an old man on that vessel attacked them with some mighty explosives in the last encounter. They were attacking them to chase them out of that region.

Back then, Wang Xian had been anxious about the construction of the Dragon Palace. Hence, he did not bother. This time, he wanted to have a good look.

“What’s going on?” We haven’t seen any Icefish in the past few days. Where have they all gone? This shouldn’t be happening!”

At this time, a middle-aged man was staring at the center spot with an awful look on the Sacred Seas of Swords’ vessels not far away.

“Attendant Yun, something has not been quite right these past few days. Not only are the Icefish gone, but also the Qilian fish. We haven’t seen any of them within these two days.”

The duo was flustered as they spoke.

A young man was holding onto a sword by the side. He was 1.9 meters tall with a striking appearance. He exhibited a prideful demeanor from within. However, he was frowning slightly at this point in time.

The ocean was a substantial treasure-hunting ground. One of the biggest reasons that many sects established their bases in the sea was because of its resources.

They could hunt mighty fish species in the sea through some special techniques.

These fish contained a high amount of energy. Feeding on them was not any different from eating the Spiritual Grass. It was more so that the high amount of energy from the marine animals could allow Martial Artists to enhance the strength of their bodies.

The dominant marine animals in the sea were valuable resources for the clans. These animals were known as spiritual fish.

However, Sacred Sea of Swords had been able to catch not a single spiritual fish in the past two days.

“Attendant Yun, Senior Brother Ma, there’s a yacht heading in our direction!”

Just then, a disciple walked over and pointed to the back as he reported to the middle-aged man and that young man.

“Get them out of our territory!” the duo said with much impatience.
