“Shuang ‘ER is too respectful towards this master!”

In the main hall, the Bei Chuan Sect Master said helplessly!

“There’s nothing we can do. After tens of thousands of years of silence, it was the Dragon King who helped her walk out. With bei Shuang’s character of repaying kindness with gratitude, she must be very respectful towards the Dragon King!”

A patriarch beside her also shook his head!

In their opinion, this was a good thing as well as a bad thing. The good thing was that bei Shuang did not hate the Bei Chuan sect because of this. As for the bad thing, her master might be even more important than the Bei Chuan sect!

Just like now, the three great forces, including the experts from the great sect from last month, were all here today to befriend bei Shuang. In the end, her master came and left!

However, they could not say anything!

“Let’s go and take a look!”

Bei Chuan sect master hesitated for a moment before following them out! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Around them, the people from the three major factions also flew out!

“Eh?”

When the group flew outside, they saw bei Shuang and a young man flying over!

Bei Shuang stood at a spot to the right, a little behind, her face filled with respect and respect!

“Eh? Goddess Frost is so respectful towards that master of hers!”

“I can see that she is very respectful. Her master seems to be the leader of a small galaxy, and his strength is not as strong as the current goddess of Frost!”

“The leader of this faction is really lucky. I don’t know where he got the frost cultivation method, but it made the silent bei Shuang Shine once again!”

“However, this leader doesn’t know his limits. His disciple is stronger than him, and the strong are respected. Even if it’s his master, he should be more humble!”

The people of the three forces looked over and said in a low voice!

The expressions of the Beichuan sect master and the others became even more unsightly!

“Sect master, my master has sent the experts of the Dragon Palace here. They want to enter the Abyss in our area and kill the abyssal seeds!”

At this moment, bei Shuang flew over and said to the Beichuan sect master!

“Of course there’s no problem!”

The Beichuan sect master squeezed out a smile and nodded immediately!

“However, Dragon King, our Beichuan sect has a lot of positions to guard. We might not be able to protect everyone’s safety at that time!”

He hesitated for a moment and continued speaking. After saying that, he could not help but look at bei Shuang!

In his opinion, bei Shuang, this master of his, obviously wanted to obtain some abyssal seed crystals through this war!

With their backing, even if they encountered danger, they could escape instantly without any worries!

Furthermore, there was still bei Shuang. If bei Shuang were to help them...

“The Dragon Palace is free to act. We will not drag down the Beichuan sect. We will not act together with you!”

Wang Xian heard what he said and spoke directly!

“Master, do you want me to act together with the members of the Dragon Palace?”

Bei Shuang spoke directly!

Her words caused the expressions of the Beichuan sect leader and the rest to change slightly!

“There’s no need for that. You can stay at the Beichuan sect. The Dragon Palace doesn’t need your help!”

Wang Xian shook his head and said as he swept a glance at the Beichuan sect leader and the rest!

The expressions of the Beichuan sect leader and the rest became better after hearing Wang Xian’s words!

“The next time we fight, the Dragon Palace will make a move!”

Wang Xian said to the Beichuan sect leader!

“No problem. With the help of the Dragon Palace’s experts, I would like to thank everyone from the Dragon Palace!”

The leader of the Beichuan sect cupped his hands in gratitude!

As long as he didn’t drag the Beichuan sect down, the leader of the Beichuan sect would be happy for the experts from the Dragon Palace to take action. If the Dragon Palace took action, it would also reduce the pressure on their side!

“We are also here for the crystallization of the abyss seed!”

Wang Xian smiled!

After chatting with him for a while, Wang Xian left immediately and flew towards the Dragon Peak!

“I hope the Dragon Palace doesn’t cause any trouble!”

The leader of Beichuan sect muttered as he watched Wang Xian’s disappearing figure!

Because of bei Shuang, he could only be polite to the Dragon Palace!

“Dragon King!”

In the Dragon Peak, the Heaven Formation immediately bowed when it saw Wang Xian!

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded and came to the command center at the top of the Dragon Peak!

From the top, he could overlook the outside and also overlook the interior!

“The members of the Heaven’s Eye Arrow Division have all arrived. More than half of the poison-making department of the eight Qi’s and the Starwood Dragon species have arrived. More than half of the strange demon clan and the Fire Hammer clan have also arrived!”

...

“There are a total of 100,000 members and about 1,000 immortal God Kings!”

Heaven Array continued!

“That’s enough!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. 100,000 members and 1,000 immortal God Kings!

As for the rest of the members of the Dragon Palace, none of them were below level five of the Eternal God Lord. Most of them were at level seven or even level eight of the Eternal God Lord!

Among them, there were about 35,000 members of the heaven’s Eye Arrow Division. Their one round of attack was definitely destructive!

Not to mention the Dragon Peak and the thousands of War artifacts on the Dragon Peak!

“When the next war breaks out, I’ll let all the forces on the demon island experience the strength of the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were shining!

Time was the most worthless in the universe. The war this time would break out ten days later!

Countless abyssal seeds were gathered at the exit. They could release their own power and expand the abyss!

...

As for the four forces of the Bei Chuan sect, they had to destroy them before they could expand the abyss!

Once the number of abyss seeds gathered in the Abyss reached a certain level, they would have to enter the abyss to hunt them down!

“All the disciples of the Dragon Palace, Get Ready!”

When the war broke out again, Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled. He stood on the command platform and shouted coldly!

“Yes!”

All the members of the Dragon Palace responded loudly. All the members of the Heavenly Eye Arrow Division stood on the Arrow Platform!

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and gave the order!

Buzz

The entire dragon peak trembled slightly and flew towards the Abyss in front of the Planet of the Beichuan sect at a terrifying speed!

“Eh? What is this? A large-scale war machine?”

“Which faction are they from?”

Some of the factions on the northern edge of the planet saw the Dragon Peak flying towards the Abyss and were astonished!

“Let’s go in!”

Long Feng’s speed was very fast. In less than five minutes, he arrived in front of the Beichuan sect’s group of planets. Wang Xian looked at the Abyss in front of him and immediately gave the order!

Buzz

Long Feng entered the Abyss directly and emitted a mysterious aura. It was like a Holy Peak!

“Huh? What is that?”

“Who are they from?”

Some of the disciples of the Bei Chuan sect looked at the war weapons that flew over in surprise. They were astonished and asked immediately!

“The Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian shouted softly and came to the Abyss. He looked at the millions of abyss seeds in front of him!

“The Dragon Palace? It’s the sect of the deputy sect master’s Master!”

“The sect master said that if the other party comes, we don’t need to bother about them. We will fight against us!”

“Is this the war weapon of the Dragon Palace? They look so powerful!”

Some of the disciples and experts of the Bei Chuan sect looked at the dragon peak that had stepped into the battlefield in astonishment!

“The lowest level is the abyss seed of the Eternal God Lord level. There are even quite a number of immortal god Kings!”

Wang Xian stared at the entire battlefield with a burning look in his eyes!
