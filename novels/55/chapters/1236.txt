Translator: 5496903

“Heavenly Blade Reincarnation!”

A terrifying blade light condensed in the arena and slashed forward, signaling the start of the Battle of the prodigies.

In the surroundings, tens of thousands of youths were watching the battle on the arena.

“Who do you think will win this battle? That Huang Tian from the divine wind academy feels extremely confident. He actually wants to be defeated within ten moves!”

“Huang Tian... Huang Tian, I remember now. A year ago, Huang Tian, who was ranked third in the Divine Wind Academy, was very strong. However, I haven’t heard from him since then. I didn’t expect him to be in seclusion for a year!”

“A year ago, Huang Tian had already reached the half-step void interpretation realm. He must be stronger now. Chen Lin might not be able to protect his reputation as a heaven’s favorite!”

Wang Xian stood in the air and looked at the two people fighting below. The three young men beside him were discussing.

“That Chen Lin is no match for Huang Tian!”

At this moment, seeing Huang Tian easily blocking Chen Lin’s attack, Wang Xian had some understanding in his heart.

The gap between the two of them was still very obvious. That Huang Tian indeed had the right to be arrogant.

“Oh no, senior brother Chen Lin is obviously not a match for that Huang Tian!”

“Kill him, senior brother Chen Lin, kill him!”

Around them, when three moves had passed, the people from the blood stream sect saw the battle below and said with furious expressions.

“Haha, Senior Brother Huang Tian is invincible. Defeating a person ranked 20th on the prodigy roll is a piece of cake!”

“Today, our senior brother Huang Tian will directly become the biggest dark horse and enter the top ten!”

When the students of Divine Wind Academy saw Senior Huang Tian’s relaxed appearance, their faces revealed an excited expression. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Another dark horse has appeared. This period of time is simply too crazy. There are so many prodigies appearing!”

“Ren Xingchen from a few days ago, Duan Jiuchuan from yesterday, and Huang Tian from today, this simply doesn’t allow people to Live!”

“Duan Jiuchuan has already made it to the 11th place. I reckon that he can still make it to the top few. I just don’t know how many places this divine wind academy’s Huang Tian can make!”

“The Prodigy Bridge is about to appear. All the hidden prodigies have come out!”

When the surrounding spectators saw this scene, their faces were filled with astonishment.

“Haha, the Ninth Move, Lose for me!”

In less than a minute, a maniacal laughter sounded from below. One could see Huang Tian holding a long sword in his hand.

The long sword was not unsheathed. With a shake of his arm, a 100-meter-long sword ray directly attacked Chen Lin.

“Not good!”

At this moment, Chen Lin’s face was covered in cold sweat. When he saw Huang Tian’s attack, he gritted his teeth in embarrassment.

“Block it for me!”

He roared loudly and the surrounding soil within a 100-meter radius started to gather around his body.

Although he knew that he was not Huang Tian’s match, he still had to endure ten moves!

“Haha, you still want to resist? Die!”

When Huang Tian saw Chen Lin’s defense, his eyes revealed a sinister look. A killing intent was hidden in the deepest part of his eyes.

“Sword Explosion!”

A savage look flashed across his face as he unsheathed his sword. A sharp sword light shot toward Chen Lin, who was defending himself.

“Oh no, he’s going to kill senior brother Chen Lin!”

“It’s over. Senior Brother Chen Lin has formed a defense, so he won’t be able to surrender in time!”

The expressions of the surrounding people, especially the disciples of the blood stream sect, changed drastically.

“Pu! Pu! Pu!”

In the center of the arena, Chen Lin’s expression changed drastically when he saw Huang Tian’s attack.

A terrifying sword light attacked him, and the Earth Tower’s defense quickly crumbled.

“He’s definitely at the peak of the half-step void interpretation realm!”

Chen Lin’s eyes were filled with shock, and despair filled his heart.

“Die!”

Huang Tian’s figure shot up, and countless sword lights covered Chen Lin from behind.

“Haha, I said I’d defeat you in ten moves, yet you still want to resist as if you’re courting death. In that case, I can only kill you!”

Huang Tian floated in the sky, looking at Chen Lin who had already lost his vitality on the stage, his eyes filled with disdain.

“Hong!”

“What a powerful attack! This Huang Tian is so strong!”

“Chen Lin was actually killed. Hiss, ten moves, as expected, it’s ten moves. He wasn’t defeated, but directly killed!”

“Haha, Senior Is Invincible, senior is awesome!”

When the surrounding people saw this scene, they revealed shocked expressions. The people of the Divine Wind Academy revealed excited expressions.

The disciples of the blood stream sect were all filled with anger.

“I am the Heaven’s Pride Divine Wind Academy’s Huang Tian. This battle is just the starting point. I will step on the heaven ladder step by step, stepping on the Heaven’s pride and climbing up!”

Huang Tian hovered above the arena. He looked at everyone coldly and said proudly.

A strong sense of confidence emanated from him. That proud and invincible posture made the faces of many young people change slightly.

Everyone knew that a dark horse had started to gallop!

“He really knows how to show off!”

Wang Xian looked at Huang Tian who was floating in the sky. He shook his head slightly and moved his body.

He came to the challenge stage and looked at the challenge rules on it.

“500 spiritual liquid? Challenge!”

“You need to input your name, Huh? Just name one!”

Wang Xian looked at the rules on the challenge stage and took out 500 spiritual liquid and placed it on it.

“Senior brother Huang Tian is invincible, heaven-treading prodigy, AO tianxing!”

“Nameless challenge the 20th place on The Prodigy Roll, Divine Wind Academy’s Huang Tian!”

Just as the students of Divine Wind Academy were calling Huang Tian Invincible and stepping on the Prodigy roll, a cold voice resounded throughout the entire prodigy stage.

In an instant, everyone was stunned and their faces revealed a look of astonishment.

Huang Tian, who was floating in the air above the stage and looking down at everyone arrogantly, his expression also stiffened slightly and slowly sank.

Just a moment ago, he had said that he would step on the prodigy roll step by step to reach a higher peak. In the end, someone had challenged him in an instant.

This was simply a blatant provocation and a slap to the face.

“F * ck, who dares to provoke our Huang Tian Brothers? They are courting death!”

“Cowardly, they don’t even dare to reveal their true names. They even dare to ascend to the Heaven’s pride stage. This is simply a great humiliation!”

“Courting death, they actually dare to challenge our senior. Senior, kill him!”

“This... What’s going on? This Huang Tian’s strength is clearly not at the 20th rank. How can there still be someone who dares to challenge him? Isn’t this courting death?”

“Huang Tian’s attacks are cruel. There’s still someone who dares to challenge him!”

The people from the Divine Wind Academy roared furiously. The rest of the people were also astonished.

At this moment, there was still someone who dared to challenge Huang Tian!

“Nameless rat, get out here!”

Huang Tian was floating in the sky. He roared at his surroundings with a gloomy face. His eyes were flashing with killing intent.

Wang Xian frowned slightly when he heard his words. A hint of coldness flashed in his eyes.

His body moved and he flew into the arena instantly.

After entering the arena, Wang Xian hovered in the sky and looked at Huang Tian.

“HMM? You’re challenging me?”

Huang Tian’s eyes flashed with a cold glint when he saw Wang Xian flying over. He sized him up from top to bottom.

“You don’t even dare to use your real name, and your face is still covered by a mask. You are an unknown rat, yet you still dare to step onto the Heaven’s Pride Stage?”

Huang Tian’s disdainful shout came from his mouth and resounded throughout the entire arena.
