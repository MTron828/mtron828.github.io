Chapter 527: One Minute

[What... Trap the beast and slay the dragon? What just happened? Are the guys from the Dragon Sect trapped by those from the Dong Hua Sacred Sect?]

The post was up for barely a minute, and it was the spotlight of the Underworld immediately.

Upon clicking the post, the various Martial Artists of the Underworld were shocked to see a photo of a group of masked Dragonians.

[Are those people wearing masks with black wings disciples from the Dragon Sect? Is the Dragon King among them? Who posted this? Is this from the Dong Hua Sacred Sect?]

[This is not real, is it? From the photo, it looks like the guys from the Dragon Sect have been trapped? Does this mean that the Dong Hua Sacred Sect has raised an attack on the Dragon Sect?]

[No way! The Dragon Sect destroyed the Remains only yesterday, much to the delight of everyone. But today, they landed themselves in the hands of the Dong Hua Sacred Sect. This spells total annihilation for the Dragon Sect!]

[The fifty people in the photo do look like they are from the Dragon Sect. By putting this information out, the disciples from the Dong Hua Sacred Sect most certainly want the Dragon Sect dead!]

[From the background in the photo, it seems like it was taken in the mountains. Could it be that the Dragon Sect had secretly planned for a sneak attack on the Dong Hua Sacred Sect, but was completely wiped out by them instead?]

[It does seem possible for the Dragon Sect to launch a sneak attack on Dong Hua Sacred Sect. Going by the character of the Dragon King, he had already intended to fight the Dong Hua Sacred Sect till the end. Thus he’ll not let them off easily. But by the looks of things, it looks like they were trapped by the Dong Hua Sacred Sect!]

[The Dragon King is too self-conceited. Maybe with the annihilation of the Remains yesterday, he felt confident enough to take on the Dong Hua Sacred Sect. But doing that is just an act of courting death!]

[Gone. The Dragon Sect is completely gone now. They chose to take on the Dong Hua Sacred Sect while they are still leagues below their level!]

Countless Martial Artists of the Underworld expressed their comments under the post.

Nobody expected that this would have happened.

Yesterday, the Dragon Sect destroyed the Remains. Today, they are on the way to being destroyed by the Dong Hua Sacred Sect.

The turn of events left the Martial Artists of the Underworld filled with emotions.

[The Dragon King is too self-conceited. That is the Dong Hua Sacred Sect we are talking about! Their presence is a sign of invincibility in the Underworld. Provoking them will lead to the downfall of the Dragon Sect for sure!]

[I knew that the Dragon Sect and Dragon King would not live long, not with their arrogance. It makes total sense that they get wiped out!]

One of the martial artists commented under the post.

[The Dragon Sect had lived their worth. By destroying the Remains, they got rid of one of the Underworld’s greatest nemeses. But the Dragon Sect and the Dragon King were threats themselves. This is good riddance.]

[Support the Dong Hua Sacred Sect!]

The news put a smile on the faces of some Martial Artists, who were in support of the decimation of the Dragon Sect.

Although some other Sacred sects were filled with mixed emotions when they first saw the post, their faces lit up with smiles eventually.

To them, it was certainly a good thing that the Dragon Sect was gone. They did not want such a strong yet unbridled force to remain in the Underworld.

While the Underworld was shocked by the content of the post, Wang Xian was found standing in the center of a Spirit Array. Faced with the smug looks of the gang of Dong Hua Sacred Sect disciples, he was seen beaming with a smile.

“Trap the beast and slay the dragon?”

“You will have to be able to trap the dragon first!” Wang Xian said with a slight sneer.

He looked up and slowly raised his right arm. In a split second, the entire arm underwent a horrific change.

The entire arm emitted a golden glow, turning gold in color, and then transforming into a golden dragon claw.

The partial dragonification replaced his arm with a solid dragon claw.

“Heh heh, trying to break our Spirit Array? Stop your wishful thinking. This is one of the only two legendary Spirit Arrays that our Dong Hua Sacred Sect practices. It’s impossible for any Dan Realm experts to break this array!”

Old Zhou saw the transformation on Wang Xian’s arm and had a look of contempt across his face.

“Really? Your lives are about to end in just one more minute!” Wang Xian said with a faint grin on his face as he fixed his eyes on the Supreme Elder of Dong Hua Sacred Sect.

“Haha, let me tell you this. You all have only five more minutes to live. After the five minutes are up, our experts from the Dong Hua Sacred Sect will annihilate your entire Dragon Sect!” Old Zhou laughed in the direction of Wang Xian.

The group of Inborn experts behind Old Zhou slowly raised their heads with their arms folded.

“Dragon King, give us your best shot. We will cheer for you from here! Haha!” They guffawed with sneers.

“Oh? Really?” Wang Xian chuckled at the sight of their laughter. He moved his body and launched an attack straight ahead.

With a leap, he lunged forward with an attack, clenching his dragon claw tightly.

Dead ahead, the gang of Dong Hua Sacred Sect disciples looked on, still with smiles on their faces.

The power of the spirit array was tested personally by their Sect leader. No Dan expert could ever think of breaking it.

They showed no signs of anxiousness, and their faces remained calm.

Bam!

When the dragon claw hit the spirit array, the array showed no signs of wavering.

“Haha, what a futile attempt at using your power!” The bald, middle-aged expert witnessed the scene and laughed out arrogantly.

“Heh heh...” Wang Xian looked up and grinned, his eyes sweeping across the entire gang. “Kill!”

Kill!

As soon as he finished muttering the word, the spirit array suddenly showed signs of cracking as if a piece of glass was swiftly breaking apart.

“What? This...”

The cracks of the spirit array shocked the entire Dong Hua Sacred Sect with smiles on their faces froze in an instant.

“What’s this?” Old Zhou’s eyes shrunk uncontrollably. He astonishingly realized that the strike from the Dragon King moments ago had penetrated the spirit array.

The strike penetrating the Spirit Array happened all too quickly, as if the force had caused time to freeze momentarily before the cracks became visible.

“Kill!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The group of Dragonians alongside Mo Yuan showed an icy glance in their eyes. They wore the Abyss masks, and the wings on their backs began to flap as they attacked the Dong Hua Sacred Sect disciples at a frightful speed.

Their arms were now slightly quivering as they looked at their approaching enemies with horror.

“No, no, he... he is capable of bursting an attack from the Budding Realm. How can he be...be that strong!?”

Old Zhou’s eyes twitched at the sight of the attacking group of experts from the Dragon Sect. Seeing the Dragon King had his eyes fixated on him, he was petrified.

“Run! Right now!”

In a flash, Old Zhou made the decision to retreat. They were no match for the Dragon Sect, not with their ability.

Without their Spirit Array, they had completely lost their right to battle.

“Run for your life!”

Trembling in fear, the surrounding group of Inborn experts from the Dong Hua Sacred Sect tried to escape when the Dragonians approached them with murderous looks on their faces.

“Five more minutes! Just hang on for another five minutes and the reinforcements from the ancestral sect will be here. We will be able to survive by then!” the bald, middle-aged expert said with his eyes twitching furiously. Gritting his teeth, he tried to run away.

“Do you really think you can escape?” Mo Yuan said with a cold smile on his face, glaring at the Dong Hua Sacred Sect experts.

The Devil Wings on the backs of the masked Dragonians fluttered violently.

“All of you from the Dong Hua Sacred Sect must die! There is no escape for any of you!”

Bam!

The Devil Wings moved with excitement, exuding a black luster from the wings.

The Spiritual Stone mounted on their Devil Wings channeled the powers of the Wind Feather stone, making them feel as light as feathers. With a gentle charge, they were able to increase their speed instantaneously by more than fifty percent!
