Chapter 322: Saint? One Strike

Several female disciples of the Heavenly Sound Sect mocked Tang Yinxuan. They looked at her before turning to Wang Xian.

When the Saint heard what the other disciples had said, he was clearly displeased.

He was the Saint of the Heavenly Sound Sect and had been wooing Tang Yinxuan for some time. All the gifts he wished to give to her were rejected. For the Saintess selection the next day, he disregarded the possibility of incurring the displeasure of the Vice Sect Leader by wanting to lend his Sky Devil Zither to her.

In the end, Tang Yinxuan rejected all his kindness and accepted a zither from an unknown person. Even he would not believe if one said there was nothing between them.

Tang Yinxuan heard the ridicule of her peers and was a little embarrassed.

Cough cough!

At this moment, Wang Xian coughed twice. He looked to the disciples of the Heavenly Sound Sect and said, “I’m sorry. If you guys don’t know anything, please choose your words wisely. I’m a married man!”

Wang Xian continued, “A gift from an unknown person might not always be a shitty item. Besides, I have not heard of all your names either.”

Huh?

Wang Xian’s response made the crowd of Heavenly Sound Sect’s disciples raise their eyebrows. They looked at him and started scrutinizing him from top to bottom.

“You have not heard of our Saint’s name? You must be cut off from the world. You can go look him up, the ninth-ranked youth on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart. Hehe! You must not have seen the world!” a young man said with contempt.

“He’s just another frog in a well. The only question is which sect he’s from. Tell us about it or let us see what you’re capable of!” The other young men lifted his head slightly and looked mockingly at Wang Xian.

“Haha, if there’s time, you will naturally be able to see it!” Wang Xian smiled and replied with hidden meaning.

“It seems like we have someone who is really confident about his strength. Instead of waiting for another day, why don’t we do it today? Show us a little!”

Seeing how casual and relaxed Wang Xian was, the Saint revealed a smirk. Moving his arm slightly, a long flute appeared in his hand.

The metal flute spun in his hand and pointed at Wang Xian. Metal attribute aura circled the flute, giving off a sharp glow in the process.

“This is my secondary weapon, Golden Imperial Flute.”

“Saint, this rascal is clearly acting tough in front of us. How could he possibly compare with you? He’s just a nobody who talks louder than what he’s capable of. I, your Junior brother, can easily defeat him!”

A young man smiled and looked at Wang Xian when he saw the Saint take out his weapon. At this moment, he smiled mockingly and gradually placed both of his hands before his chest.

“♩♫♭♯∮‖♪♬♩”

Suddenly, he chanted some music notes. The devilish music headed towards Wang Xian’s ears.

Suddenly, strong winds started blowing around them. The chilling cold wind turned into musical notes and struck towards Wang Xian.

The young man stared at Wang Xian with a mocking smile. Clearly, he wanted Wang Xian to make a fool out of himself.

The surrounding disciples of the Heavenly Sound Sect also looked on with ridicule.

As disciples of the Heavenly Sound Sect, their methods of attacking were creepier than other sects.

They could integrate their attribute energies into sounds. A strong Inborn expert with high music attainments could even make one lose his sense of direction and self.

In their view, an unknown rascal tried to act tough in front of them. That would be equivalent to asking them to humiliate him.

Crack!

At this moment, a crisp sound of a sharp weapon propagated.

A stream of metallic energy disintegrated all the wind attribute musical notes and headed for the young man’s palm.

Argh!

The young man cried out pitifully and immediately moved his hands aside. Looking at his own palm, he was horrified.

Long and deep wounds had appeared on his palms. They were so deep that one could see the bones. Fresh blood was oozing out from the wound.

“You dare to attack me!”

The young man revealed a pained expression. He held onto his arm and stared solemnly at Wang Xian.

Sss!

When the disciples of the Heavenly Sound Sect saw the injuries on the young man’s hands, they gasped. Their pupils constricted as they stared at Wang Xian.

Huh?

The Saint frowned and murderous intent gleamed in his eyes. He looked at the treasured sword in Wang Xian’s hand and commented, “You are pretty strong but you must be courting death to injure the disciples of the Heavenly Sound Sect!”

As he spoke, he moved the Golden Imperial Flute in his hand and pointed directly at Wang Xian. The next moment, the metal attribute energy shot out.

It was the disciple of the Heavenly Sound Sect that had started this. However, they ended up chiding Wang Xian. How domineering and unreasonable!

“Saint, this is a friend of mine!”

Tang Yinxuan was shocked. She quickly moved to stop the Saint from attacking.

She was really afraid that the Saint would offend Wang Xian and Wang Xian would kill the Saint on the spot.

Besides that, she was a little surprised by Wang Xian’s attribute.

If she had remembered things correctly, he was using water attribute attacks while fighting with the assassins from the Dark Conjurer. However, he was using metal attribute attacks currently.

“Your friend?”

Seeing Tang Yinxuan blocking his attack, the Saint’s expression turned gloomy.

“He dares to attack the disciple of the Heavenly Sound Sect. As the Saint, I have to stand up for them. I’ll cripple anyone who dares to injure us. Could it be that you, Tang Yinxuan, wish to stop me?”

As he spoke, he stared harshly at Tang Yinxuan. The anger in his heart raged even fiercer.

“Hehe! You started the fight and yet tried to stop me from retaliating. Saint? I’ve really not heard of the Saint of the Heavenly Sound Sect or the ninth-rank existence of the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart!”

“In my eyes, Saint? Hehe! One strike is enough!”

Seeing the young man before him trying to attack him, Wang Xian’s expression turned chilly. He lifted Zhan Lu in his right hand.

Dang!

“Tsk. I’ll let you know the consequences of being arrogant and talking big in front of me!”

Seeing that Wang Xian wanted to retaliate, murderous intent gleamed in the Saint’s eyes. He waved the Golden Imperial Flute in his hand.

Wu wu!

As the air entered the long flute, rapid notes were made. A sharp metallic edge shot towards Wang Xian.

Dang!

However, Wang Xian drew Zhan Lu partially out at this moment. The intense metallic edge on it formed a razor-sharp golden sword.

Before the sword left the scabbard, the glow of the sword had already been shot forward as an attack.

The metallic edge from the Golden Imperial Flute vibrated a little in the air before disintegrating rapidly.

As for the sword glow of Zhan Lu, it slashed towards the Golden Imperial Flute in the Saint’s hand.

Pa Pa!

Before the Saint could react to it, the sword glow had split the Golden Imperial Flute and was striking towards his shoulders.

“What?”

The Saint was horrified. He immediately dodged to the side. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

However, the razor-sharp sword glow still landed on his shoulders. Instantly, his clothes were dyed red from blood.

Pa!

The Golden Imperial Flute split in the middle and fell to the ground, giving off a crisp voice.

One strike was enough to split the weapon of the Saint of the Heavenly Sound Sect and injured the Saint.

“Trash!”

Wang Xian kept Zhan Lu away and looked nonchalantly at the crowd. Without having to pull Zhan Lu completely out of the scabbard, their Saint was already injured by it.

“We will meet again if fate dictates!” Wang Xian looked at Tang Yinxuan and spoke with a smile. After which, he turned around and left, as he felt disinterested.

Tang Yinxuan stood rooted to the ground. After which, she turned to look at the figure behind her.
