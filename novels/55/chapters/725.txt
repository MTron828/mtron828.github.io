Translator: 549690339

After deacon Zhang finished his words, the ten young men standing beside him stared at Wang Xian with hatred in their eyes. Their eyes were filled with killing intent.

These ten young men made the seven white-haired middle-aged men beside them slightly curious. They turned their heads and looked over. Their eyes were filled with astonishment.

Crippled? Those ten disciples of the puppet immortal sect were actually crippled!

“Hehe, these ten disciples of your puppet immortal sect are causing trouble in my restaurant. If I don’t cripple him, who else would i Cripple?”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the group and said faintly.

“Hehe!”

When deacon Zhang heard Wang Xian’s words, a hint of coldness flashed across his eyes. He said coldly, “Then do you know that they are disciples of our puppet immortal sect? How dare they cripple Our Disciples in our territory? I think you are courting death!”

“So what if they are crippled? So what!”

A hint of disdain flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes as he looked at the old man calmly.

“Deacon Zhang, he... just now, one of our disciples was crippled by him and thrown out of the window. There was also another disciple from the Ming Wang Immortal Sect!”

A middle-aged man walked to the side of the old man. He swept his gaze across Wang Xian and a hint of hatred flashed across his eyes.

“That’s right, elder Ming. One of our disciples was thrown out. We... We have no other choice. Please stand up for us!”

An old man who had joined the Mingwang Immortal sect immediately came to the front of the white-haired middle-aged man and spoke with a face full of anger.

“That’s right. Before the emergence of the immortal sect, he had already suppressed the entire jianghu. We dare not speak out in anger. Now, he wants us to submit to him. Please, elder Ming, stand up for us!”

“Please help us make a decision, deacon Zhang!”

Instantly, dozens of martial artists from Jiang City rushed to Deacon Zhang and elder Ming’s side and shouted loudly.

“Damn this fellow. He dares to act arrogantly in our territory. Father, we should destroy them!”

When Ming Feng heard the words of the martial artists, his eyes were filled with killing intent as he stared at Wang Xian.

“In my opinion, there’s no need for them to exist anymore!”

When executive Zhang saw the contemptuous look on Wang Xian’s face, his eyes were filled with killing intent as well. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Kid, don’t be too arrogant!”

The white-haired middle-aged man took two steps forward and said, “Let’s not talk about other things for now.”

He pointed at Ming Feng and said, “He is my son. The matter of you insulting my son is a little too much!”

Ming Feng raised his head slightly and walked towards Wang Xian slowly. He stared at him angrily.

Mu Zidao and a few other young men and women also walked towards Wang Xian slowly.

“It is a little too much. You can teach an ordinary disciple of our immortal sect a lesson. However, a core disciple has crossed the line!”

The skinny young man crossed his arms and sized up Wang Xian and the group of drakonids behind him. He looked down on them.

“So this is the Dragon King. He’s quite handsome, Hehe!”

The girl beside the skinny young man was holding a cell phone in her hand. She looked at him with a smile and said, “It wouldn’t be bad if you join our Mingwang Immortal Sect!”

“Kneel down and apologize immediately until we accept it. Otherwise, this matter won’t end so easily!”

Mu Zidao and the rest walked two meters in front of Wang Xian. They pointed at him and said coldly.

Wang Xian was slightly speechless when he heard their words. He sneered and said, “Join Your Immortal Sect?”

The surrounding warriors of Jiang City were slightly stunned when they heard Mu Zidao and the rest’s words. Following that, they exchanged glances with each other.

“The Dragon King of the dragon gate provoked the disciples of the Ming Wang Immortal sect in order to attract the attention of the immortal sect!”

“The Dragon King held this Dragon Gate banquet in order to attract the attention of the immortal sect!”

“He wants to join the immortal sect!”

The Warriors of Jiang City looked at each other and were basically certain in their hearts.

By attracting the attention of the two immortal sects, the Mingwang Immortal sect and the puppet immortal sect would discover the strength of the Dragon Gate and then invite the Dragon Gate to join them.

There was a difference between actively applying to join and being invited to join. The latter could obtain greater benefits!

“I didn’t expect the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate to actually want to join the immortal sect through this method. No wonder he dared to cripple the disciples of the immortal sect. This is because the value of the dragon gate far exceeds them. The Immortal sect wouldn’t blame the Dragon King for This!”

Some of the martial artists from Jiang City looked a little embarrassed. They didn’t expect the Dragon Gate banquet to have such a meaning.

“Now, immediately kneel down and apologize to me. Everything can be settled after the apology. Otherwise!”

Obviously, Feng also pointed at Wang Xian and said coldly.

A few young men at the side looked at him with smiles on their faces. The corners of their lips curled up slightly.

“Kneel down and apologize. How interesting. How narcissistic!”

Wang Xian glanced at the white-haired young men who were standing at the side with their hands behind their backs with a smile on his face. There were six young men surrounding him.

“The reason why I’m holding this banquet today is to tell all of you that the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate is back!”

The smile on Wang Xian’s face slowly disappeared. He said in a calm tone, “Also, in Jiang City, no one is allowed to provoke me, and no one is allowed to disturb me!”

“Violators!”

“Die!”

When Wang Xian finished his words, the atmosphere in the banquet hall changed instantly.

The air was filled with murderous intent instantly!

The members of the Dragon Gate behind Wang Xian instantly attacked the six young men of the Mingwang Immortal sect.

The sudden explosion caught the six of them off-guard.

“PFFF! PFFF! PFFF! PFFF!”

“Bang! Bang!”

The sound of four daggers piercing and two terrifying sounds of collision could be heard.

Everyone was completely stunned as they watched this scene in horror.

The four core disciples of the Mingwang Immortal sect were directly pierced through by the Daggers. The other two skinny young men and girls, whose strength had reached the infant stage, managed to avoid the disaster.

However, both of them were severely injured.

Ming Feng, who was pointing at Wang Xian, froze. His arrogant face was filled with fear. He lowered his head and looked at his chest.

He was in disbelief and despair!

“You... How dare you?”

Ming Feng’s face was distorted. The three young men beside him were filled with despair and disbelief.

They actually dared to kill him!

“I want you to die!”

On the side, the white-haired middle-aged man, who had been watching coldly from above, saw his son and the core disciples of the immortal sect being stabbed directly through their bodies, and his face changed dramatically.

He roared loudly, and his hair stood on end, and a dazzling white light filled the entire banquet hall.

All the warriors of the Jiang City World in the surroundings were horrified and their bodies trembled.

What the hell was going on?

The Dragon King was not going to join the immortal sect, but... He was going to warn everyone today, including the members of the immortal sect.

What would happen if you provoked me!

“Puchi!”

At this moment, a piercing sound was heard.

Everyone quickly turned their heads and looked over with widened eyes in shock.

A white shadow appeared behind elder Ming, and the Shadow’s arm directly pierced through elder Ming’s chest.

Around him, the dazzling white light quickly dimmed, and the white shadow behind him disappeared.

Elder Ming widened his eyes and looked down at his chest.
