Chapter 1362: Those who wanted to leave immediately left

“Believe in Her Majesty the Queen. Since the Queen said to hand it over to young master Wang, we don’t have to worry about it!”

Yu Chengzi pondered for a moment and comforted all the civil officials and generals in the hall.

“This... director Yu, this is not a question of whether we believe it or not. We are now in a good and bad situation with the dragon and Phoenix dynasty. Since we are staying, we will not betray the queen. We just want a guarantee!”

A civil official said with a bitter expression.

“Don’t worry. Young master Wang is extremely mysterious. Even we don’t know his trump card. However, the two middle-aged men who attacked just now, one of them is at level three and the other is at level two of the void interpretation realm. Since young master Wang dares to attack, he will definitely not harm Her Majesty the Queen!”

Yu Chengzi swept his gaze across everyone around him and said indifferently.

This caused the generals and civil officials to be slightly stunned. They thought of the two middle-aged men who had been following Wang Xian.

One was at level three of the void interpretation realm while the other was at level two of the void interpretation realm. To be able to have such subordinates, his influence was naturally extraordinary.

“Perhaps, he can really save our dragon-phoenix Empire!”

Everyone thought to themselves. They looked at each other and walked out.

“Go, go, take the things. Let’s go, the dragon-phoenix dynasty is finished!”

“It’s over, it’s over. The Queen’s friend actually killed the only life-saving straw, the people of the Dongyuan dynasty. Now, not only are we being attacked by the star-moon dynasty, but we will also suffer the revenge of the Dongyuan Dynasty!”

“Run, run away from here!”

A group of civil officials and generals had just walked out of the palace when they suddenly heard a series of terrified voices from their surroundings.

This made all of them slightly shocked, and they looked around with ugly expressions.

“Wei chibing, what are you doing?”

The Prime Minister of the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty stared coldly at the position in front of him.

More than ten horses were lined up in the middle of the road, and around them, many young and middle-aged men were putting things on the road.

At the front of the group, the general who had rushed out just now was riding a fierce beast.

“Of course, we are going to take my people and leave this place. Am I going to die here with you?”

When Wei chibing heard the prime minister’s figure, he stared at them with an ugly expression. He glanced behind him and said, “Hurry up and get ready. Take everything and leave this place!”

“You... you despicable and shameless person. Her Majesty the Queen has treated you well. How dare you do such a despicable thing!”

A civil official rebuked angrily.

“HMPH, then you mean you want me to die? Now the three dynasties have come to attack us!”

“Now that we’ve offended the Dongyuan dynasty, what can the dragon and Phoenix dynasty use to resist and take my life?”

Wei chibing snorted coldly and looked behind him. “Everyone, follow me!”

As he spoke, he directly walked forward.

“Let me kill this guy and take everything away!”

Mang Hong’s eyes were filled with killing intent as he stared coldly at Wei chibing.

“We can’t attack. The surrounding citizens are watching. If we attack, the hearts of the people will be in Chaos!”

The Prime Minister quickly stopped him.

The surrounding citizens were watching. If the enemy wasn’t here, the dynasty would start an internal conflict. If the enemy wasn’t here, the dynasty would fall apart!

“Are we just going to let this guy take the thing and leave?”

Mang Hong and a few generals had ugly expressions on their faces.

The prime minister shook his head and looked at the terrified citizens around him. After hesitating for a moment, he entered the palace once more.

“What happened? Why did General Wei Leave? They said that there would be three or four dynasties attacking us?”

“General Wei actually left with his family and subordinates. Is... is our dragon-phoenix dynasty really in a life-and-death situation?”

“Three or four dynasties attacking us? How... how are we supposed to fight? Is Our dynasty going to be destroyed?”

When the surrounding citizens saw General Wei leave with his subordinates, their expressions changed as they discussed.

The dragon and Phoenix Dynasty had sealed off the city recently, and the people already knew that there would be dynasties coming to attack them.

However, what they did not know was that there would actually be three or four dynasties coming to attack them.

Even the Dongyuan dynasty that was on good terms with them had turned against each other and might come to attack them.

How could they defend against this?

Panic spread from the bottom of everyone’s hearts.

Some of them widened their eyes and swallowed a mouthful of saliva as their expressions changed drastically.

“Everyone, don’t worry. Young master Wang has arrived. With young master Wang and the queen around, nothing will happen to us!”

Yu Chengzi heard the terrified voices of the people around him. He frowned slightly and said loudly.

There were some things that could not be hidden, and they were not prepared to hide it.

“What? Lord Wang Is Here? With Lord Wang around, we are not afraid anymore!”

“Young Master Wang? Which Young Master Wang? Who Is He?”

Some people knew Wang Xian’s name, while others didn’t.

But very quickly, many people had some understanding of Lord Wang and young master Wang.

However, after understanding them, they were unable to stop their panic.

No matter how strong he was, could he be as strong as three to four dynasties?

This made many people extremely fearful!

“No matter how strong that young master Wang is, he’s still not a match for three or four dynasties. Run, let’s Run!”

Some people ran out in fear.

Only the people of Saint Sea Town firmly believed in Lord Wang’s strength.

They were willing to advance and retreat together with the Dragon-phoenix dynasty, to live and die together!

“Your Majesty, General Wei’s departure has brought great fear to our Dragon-phoenix dynasty. It might not be long before some people want to escape. What should we do now?”

The prime minister who had returned to the palace reported with an unpleasant expression.

“Let those who want to leave leave leave. We can take this opportunity to see who is loyal and who is disloyal!”

“The dragon-phoenix Empire will never accept those who leave!”

Feng Luan shook her head expressionlessly when she heard the Prime Minister’s report.

Standing on the Tower of the palace, she looked at her surroundings and looked at Wang Xian who was sipping his tea at the side. A faint smile appeared on her face.

“Yes, your majesty. Then, we will announce that whoever wants to leave will leave immediately. Those who leave will be prohibited from stepping into the territory of the dragon-phoenix Empire in the future!”

The prime minister nodded slightly and retreated backward. The dragon-phoenix Empire had developed so quickly. There were bound to be some people who were not loyal to the empire.

The dragon-phoenix Empire could also use this opportunity to completely eliminate these people.

Those who remained would be the most loyal subjects of the dragon-phoenix Empire.

“If nothing goes wrong, the Star Moon Empire and the others will arrive soon. The strength of their three great empires will send at least forty insightful emptiness realm experts!”

“Apart from that, we also have to be on guard against the Dongyuan Empire. It is very likely that they will also send an army over!”

“The current dragon and Phoenix dynasty is like lambs waiting to be slaughtered. They are here to share the food with us!”

Feng Luan looked at Wang Xian, who was sitting leisurely by the side, and reminded him.

“We will be welcoming them during this period of time. Also, send someone to monitor the imperial cities and cities of these few dynasties!”

“Since we are going to fight, let’s fight a Big Country War!”

Wang Xian looked at Feng Luan with a smile and said confidently.
