3403 3402 was in the innate numinous treasure

“I should be able to reach it in two months!”

Wang Xian looked at the route and muttered.

Nine Sun City was not too far away from the Thundercloud Domain!

Two months was not a long time to fly and teleport. However, it would take Wang Xian around half a year to make a round trip.

Flying in the air, Wang Xian was very fast. When he was outside, there was nothing to hide his strength.

Moreover, he had also displayed some of his formidable strength in the Divine Thunder City.

Now, the Thunder Ray race should be guessing his specific strength.

“If I can successfully use the innate spiritual treasure this time, I will have the combat strength of A Level One universe Dominator!”

Wang Xian muttered to himself as a smile appeared on his face.

The journey was a little boring. He didn’t delay anything Midway and rushed at full speed.

“I’m almost there!”

Two months later, Wang Xian arrived in front of a city’s teleportation formation and stepped into it directly.

Through the teleportation formation, he was about to reach nine Sun City.

Buzz

The scene in front of him changed drastically. The scene in Wang Xian’s vision changed drastically.

In a huge stone square, warm sunlight shone down. The entire space was much brighter than the other areas.

He squinted his eyes and looked up.

Nine Scarlet Suns were suspended in the air, and they were lined up in a row, emitting warm light.

Each scarlet sun was incomparably huge.

These nine Scarlet Suns each represented a paradise.

The origin of nine Sun City also came from these nine Scarlet Suns.

The entire nine sun city was slightly huge, like a giant city.

Any building was over 10,000 meters tall. Standing here, it looked extremely tiny.

“The mountain-top giants seem to be a strong race around here!”

Wang Xian mumbled. The mountain-top giants were much stronger than the Thunder Ray race.

He moved his body and flew forward. Soon, he arrived at a trading market.

The trading market was a piece of information that Wang Xian had found on the universe’s AI in advance.

This was the only trading place in Jiuyang City. All kinds of treasures, pills, battle pets, and other items were sold.

From the lowest grade open-air stalls to large-scale shops, there were all kinds.

“Rent a stall!”

Stalls could be rented. There were at least a few million stalls in the entire set-up area. There were at least tens of millions of people in the entire set-up area.

If one was lucky enough to encounter treasures in such a stall, he would be able to make a profit. Of course, the chances of that happening were very slim.

To be able to cultivate to such a level, one must have good eyesight.

Wang Xian came to a room in the management stall and entered it to rent a stall.

That’s right, Wang Xian wanted to set up a stall for sale.

He was not familiar with Jiuri city. There were two ways to sell innate spiritual treasures. One was to sell it himself, and the other was to auction it off for the auction house.

It was easy to sell it himself. Set up a stall!

However, there were usually nothing good in a stall.

In fact, Wang Xian was more inclined to auction it at an auction house. However, there were no auctions in Jiuri city recently.

He didn’t want to wait here for too long, so he decided to set up a stall to sell it.

“Yes, sir. This is your stall number.”

The staff member gave him a number plate. He looked at it and walked towards the stall.

He came to the front of the stall and placed the number plate there. A stall covered in energy was opened.

Wang Xian entered and took out the innate thunder bell.

With a wave of his finger, Wang Xian wrote a few words in front of him.

Innate spiritual treasure. Sell it if the price is right!

After writing the words, he sat cross-legged and waited quietly. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“F * ck!”

However, when Wang Xian took out the innate spiritual treasure, he immediately attracted the attention of a stall owner.

He widened his eyes and stared at the innate thunder bell in disbelief.

“F * CK, F * CK, F * CK, F * CK, an innate spiritual treasure. He actually set up a stall to sell an innate spiritual treasure!”

After confirming it, he growled in a low voice with a face full of shock.

Wang Xian glanced at the middle-aged man at the side and smiled faintly. He sat there and waited quietly.

“What a powerful force. What kind of treasure is this?”

“Hiss, this pressure is definitely a powerful treasure. Is it real? Did an expert take out his weapon or did someone sell a powerful treasure?”

“What a powerful thunder wave over there!”

The position of the innate spiritual treasure could change the weather and color of the world.

Wang Xian took out the innate thunder bell. Waves of powerful thunder force spread out in the surroundings.

This force immediately attracted the attention of many people in the surroundings.

They immediately looked over and their faces were filled with shock.

“Innate numinous treasure, selling it when the price is right? Oh My God, selling an innate numinous treasure, this…”

“TSK, setting up a stall to sell an innate numinous treasure. D * mn, this… This is too crazy, isn’t it?”

Very soon, a large number of people gathered in front of Wang Xian’s stall.

All of them widened their eyes and were dumbfounded.

Connate numinous treasures were a treasure of such a level. Even a powerhouse at the peak of the universe knight level would find it hard to possess it.

Only a tribe leader or a pillar of a tribe could possess such a treasure.

Such a treasure was the weapon of a powerhouse at the level of the universe master.

In nine Sun City, such a treasure would only appear in an auction house. Furthermore, not every auction would have connate numinous treasures.

Yet, someone actually set up a stall to sell this!

This…

This was too ferocious!

More and more people gathered around and there were more and more discussions. In less than a few minutes, the surroundings had been blocked.

Furthermore, more and more people rushed over and looked in their direction in shock.

Wang Xian sat there quietly without any fluctuation.

He wasn’t afraid of anyone snatching this innate spiritual treasure. In nine Suns city, there were strong people guarding it. No one dared to rob it in public.

Furthermore, with Wang Xian’s current strength, he wasn’t afraid unless it was an expert with the combat strength of a Master of the universe.

“There are quite a number of thunder-attributed innate spiritual treasures here, especially those from the Divine Tiger Clan!”

As time passed, the news of someone setting up a stall to sell innate spiritual treasures quickly spread throughout the entire nine Sun City. Some of the experts rushed over upon hearing the news.

As they felt the power of this innate spiritual treasure, their eyes flickered.

Some disciples from various factions immediately passed the news to the experts from their clans.

Five days passed very quickly. During these five days, the surroundings of Wang Xian’s stall were crowded.

However, no one came to inquire about it.

This was because everyone knew that an innate spiritual treasure was not something that an ordinary powerhouse could buy.

Even a powerhouse at the peak of the universe knight level could not afford an innate spiritual treasure.

“Roar!”

On the sixth day, low roars were heard.

“Eh?”

When the powerhouse disciples around Wang Xian’s stall heard this voice, they were slightly shocked.

“It’s the strong men of the Divine Tiger Clan!”
