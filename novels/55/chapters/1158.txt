With Wang Xian’s current strength, he didn’t need an umbrella at all. Feng Luan didn’t need an umbrella either.

However, an umbrella was more romantic on a rainy day. There was no need to use spiritual energy to block the rain.

“Keep one of your tails and your eyes. Don’t have one blue and one red!”

Wang Xian stroked the head of the ice fire civet cat and said to it.

“Good chicken!”

A tender voice came out from the mouth of the ice fire civet cat. The voice was very cute.

As it spoke, its tail swayed and its eyes rolled. Other than the red and blue colors on its body, its eyes and tail returned to normal.

It was no different from an ordinary kitten.

“Meow!”

After it hid itself, the ice fire civet cat jumped onto Feng Luan’s shoulder.

“This little guy is really smart!”

Feng Luan smiled and patted its head. She looked at Wang Xian and said, “Let’s Go!”

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

As a top-tier demonic beast, the ice fire civet cat was able to babble after Wang Xian taught it how to speak for the past two days.

Its IQ was similar to that of a seven or eight-year-old child.

It was already drizzling outside when they walked out of the restaurant. Wang Xian held up an umbrella to shield the two of them.

Both Wang Xian and Feng Luan wore a mask. The function of the mask was not to hide their entire body, but to change their other faces.

Other than being able to see Feng Luan’s bright eyes, their entire face was completely different from before.

“I’ve been reading the forums of Bright Moon City for the past two days and I know of a very famous place. It’s a place that combines delicacies and beautiful scenery. Especially when it’s raining, it’s even more beautiful!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Alright, let’s go and take a look. Lead the way!”

Feng Luan nodded with a smile.

“Alright, let’s go then!”

Wang Xian smiled.

Tingxie Lake was a very beautiful place in the eastern district of Bright Moon City. It was a huge manor.

The main purpose of coming here was to eat and enjoy the beautiful scenery.

Tingxie Lake was very famous in Bright Moon City. Similarly, it was also very expensive.

Just like its name, Tingxie Lake was a huge lake, and the lake was incomparably beautiful.

Around it were many luxurious mansions belonging to powerful families.

Beside Tingxie Lake, there were pavilions and pavilions, and within the pavilions, there were many dining tables.

Here, one could eat the meat of an extraordinary eighth grade fierce beast, and one could eat delicious spirit herbs.

As long as one had spiritual stones, one would be able to taste anything.

Outside the pavilions and pavilions, there were blooming lotuses and colorful fishes. There were rockery in the lake and it looked extremely beautiful.

Especially when it was drizzling outside, it was filled with artistic conception.

There were many people who came here to eat. Wang Xian and Feng Luan were sitting in front of a table for two.

“Please be objective. The dishes you ordered will be served in five minutes. Please wait a moment!”

The staff said to Wang Xian and Feng Luan before leaving.

“TSK TSK!”

Wang Xian looked around and realized that many of them were a man and a woman sitting around. Clearly, this was a holy land for dating.

It had been a long time since Wang Xian sat down to eat and enjoy the beautiful scenery.

“This place is pretty good!”

Feng Luan looked around and said faintly.

“I think it’s pretty good too. It’s been a long time since I’ve been so relaxed!”

Wang Xian smiled.

“Make way, make way!”

Wang Xian and Feng Luan chatted with a smile. Soon, the dishes were served. Not long after, an angry voice was heard, attracting the attention of many people around.

The people who came here were all conversing gently. Their voices were very loud, causing many people to look at them with dissatisfaction.

“Young master, don’t be angry. It’s my fault. It’s My Fault!”

A soft and sorrowful voice was heard. The voice was charming and made people feel comfortable.

“Young master, don’t be angry. Don’t be angry!”

At the side, a middle-aged man was also speaking carefully.

The people sitting in the pavilions and pavilions looked over. Suddenly, many people were slightly stunned.

“It’s Miss Qinglian. Oh My God, it’s actually Miss Qinglian. The number one beauty of our Bright Moon City, Miss Qinglian. Why is she next to a man? !” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“It’s really Miss Qinglian. How is this possible? She’s actually so lowly next to a young man!”

A few young men could not help but exclaim in shock, their faces filled with disbelief.

They saw their bright moon city’s goddess holding onto a young man’s arm and smiling apologetically. This appearance was no different from stabbing a sword into their chests!

This was their goddess!

The number one goddess on the Bright Moon City’s beauty rankings.

“Scram. I saw your pure appearance, but I didn’t expect you to be so promiscuous on the bed. You’re already a F * cking Virgin!”

The young man directly pushed Qinglian.

Qinglian staggered and almost fell down. She looked at the young man pitifully.

“F * ck!”

Seeing this scene, the hearts of the surrounding young men almost bled.

This... this...

They didn’t expect their goddess.

“Bang!”

“Kid, I’m warning you. Treat Miss Qinglian better. Otherwise, don’t blame me, Tang Zhicheng, for not being polite!”

A young man slammed the table angrily. He looked at Qinglian and said angrily.

“Not being polite? Who Do you think you are?”

The young man looked over, his eyes extremely cold.

“You’re courting death. In Bright Moon City, no one dares to treat me, Tang Zhicheng...”

“Peng!”

However, before he could finish his words, the middle-aged man beside him started moving.

Before Tang Zhicheng could react, his body was sent flying into the lake.

He spat out a large mouthful of blood, his eyes filled with fear.

“What? He actually dared to attack in the city!”

“This... what terrifying strength, he’s at least at transcendent-level rank 8!”

“Who is he?”

The middle-aged man’s attack caused the surrounding people to reveal shocked expressions.

“If you dare to utter another word, I will kill you!”

The young man stared at Tang Zhicheng and said coldly.

Tang Zhicheng, who had landed in the lake, had a horrified look on his face. His body was trembling slightly.

His sudden attack caused everyone around him to fall silent.

Wang Xian looked over. His pupils contracted slightly as a hint of coldness flashed across his eyes.

Feng Luan saw Wang Xian’s expression and looked at the young man. She immediately transmitted her voice, “This seems to be the young man from the Hundred Beasts City. His identity shouldn’t be simple!”

“The third Prince of the star-moon Kingdom!”

Wang Xian replied to Feng Luan.

Feng Luan nodded her head.

“Young master, don’t be angry. Let Me Massage your shoulders!”

Qing Lian’s voice sounded from the side.

Wang Xian saw the third prince sitting beside them.

His face was filled with impatience and his mood was unusually irritable.

Qing Lian, who was standing at the back, was nervously massaging her shoulders. The middle-aged man at the side was also carefully serving her.

After the fire and ice civet kitten in the Hundred Beast City was snatched away by another young man, the third prince was extremely angry.

He was extremely angry when he thought of the throne that was right in front of him slipping away.
