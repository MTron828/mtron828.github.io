Chapter 1063: 1064 was the result of disobeying orders

Translator: 5496903

“Hmph, this Wang Xian really thinks highly of himself. He thinks that he has become the team leader and doesn’t even put his teachers in his eyes!”

“That’s right. He’s just a mere freshman. No matter how strong he is, he can’t possibly be as experienced and arrogant as his teachers!”

Qian Hu looked at Wang Xian and the rest who didn’t follow him. A mocking expression appeared on his face as he spoke loudly.

A young man beside him quickly echoed.

“This freshman Wang Xian is too conceited. He thinks that he is strong, so everyone should listen to him. His strength is at most at level seven of the extraordinary realm. He is still far from being comparable to director Qian!”

“The academy shouldn’t let an inexperienced kid be our captain. We should let Captain Qian Hu lead us!”

A few young men at the back echoed.

The group of students nodded slightly.

No matter what, even if you were the captain, you shouldn’t disobey the instructors’orders.

Could it be that you are better than the instructors?

Is this possible?

Everyone was slightly disdainful of Wang Xian’s earlier actions. A freshman wants us to completely obey your orders?

Wishful Thinking!

“For the rest of the journey, Qian Hu will be the team leader for the time being!”

At this moment, director Qian’s voice came from the sky.

“Alright, director Qian. We have no objections!”

“We support team leader Qian Hu being our team leader!”

“We support it!”

Some of the young men below responded loudly immediately.

Director Qian revealed a faint smile on his face as he looked ahead.

“Thank you for your support, students. Everyone, stay alert. This time, we must be the first to arrive at Holy Sea Town!”

A trace of excitement appeared in Qian Hu’s eyes. He lightly shouted and shouted loudly, “There might be fierce beasts ahead. If you encounter any fierce beasts, kill them ruthlessly. We are not new students, so we can’t be so cowardly!”

“Haha!”

When the students heard Qian Hu’s words, they burst into laughter.

Qian Hu’s eyes were filled with pride, and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The five instructors who were flying in the sky also had smiles on their faces. This was more like it. As students of the Demon Hunter Academy, how could they cower?

However, when they looked forward, the smiles on their faces instantly froze!

In front of them, there was a 20-meter-sized imperial crocodile lying on the ground.

Beside it, there was an alligator that was covered in wounds.

There were at least thousands of alligators around them.

At this moment, they were only 2,000 meters away from them.

“Stop, Stop!”

Director Qian’s anxious voice immediately sounded, and he quickly shouted at everyone.

“Huh?”

All the students were slightly stunned. The Sky was dark, and the color of the alligator’s body was the same as the ground. They didn’t see the alligators lying on the ground in front of them.

“There are fierce beasts in front. Run back, quickly, run back!”

Director Qian growled softly.

“Roar Roar!”

At this moment, he saw the two huge crocodile god from afar looking in his direction. His pupils contracted slightly, and a trace of fear appeared on his face.

“What’s wrong, teacher? If there are fierce beasts, we can just kill them directly. We are students of the Demon Hunter College. We will definitely not be afraid of fierce beasts!”

One of the students asked in shock.

Just a moment ago, they were still saying that as students of the Demon Hunter College, they should not be afraid. Why did their teacher let them escape?

“Boom Boom Boom!”

However, at this moment, everyone heard the sound of the ground shaking coming from the front.

Everyone’s expression changed slightly.

“Run, this group of beasts is not something we can deal with!”

One of the instructors shouted loudly when he saw the alligator king that had discovered them and was sprinting towards them.

All the students’expressions changed drastically. They turned around and fled towards the back.

“How is this possible? The ferocious beasts in front can’t even deal with the instructors? This...”

“Could it be that what Wang Xian said is true? We can’t walk in front but have to take a detour? He has already discovered that the ferocious beasts in front are not something we can deal with?”

“D * MN it, the teachers made the wrong choice. Captain Wang Xian’s choice is the right one. This...”

Hearing the voices coming from behind, the ground trembled slightly as if there were thousands of soldiers and horses behind them. Everyone’s faces were filled with fear as they hurriedly fled to the back.

“What, what’s going on!”

At this moment, Qian Hu’s face was extremely gloomy. He took a glance at the back and instantly felt his scalp go numb.

“Quick, hurry up and run!”

In the sky, the five instructors looked behind them with extremely ugly expressions.

The dozens of fierce beasts were only a thousand meters away from them. Among these dozens of imperial crocodiles, a few were at transcendent-level rank seven while the rest were all at transcendent-level rank six.

Behind this group of fierce beasts, there was also a group of transcendent-level rank five imperial crocodiles.

Transcendent-level rank six and rank seven imperial crocodiles’speed was not something that a group of transcendent-level rank four and rank five students could withstand.

“F * ck, how could this be!”

When director Qian saw this situation, a trace of fear appeared on his face.

If this group of Imperial Crocs caught up to them, it would be considered pretty good if even one-tenth of the Demon Hunter Academy students could survive.

When the academy found out about this, they would definitely cripple his cultivation.

“How could this be? How could that Kid discover the Imperial Croc so far in advance!”

At this moment, director Qian’s forehead was covered in cold sweat. Looking at the Emperor Croc that was gradually approaching, he gritted his teeth.

“All students, hurry up and escape. We’ll hold it off for a while!”

Director Qian’s face was flushed red as he said to the four teachers beside him.

“Alright, all students, hurry up and escape!”

The four teachers’faces were incomparably ugly. This time, they were in big trouble.

Regardless of whether it was the alligator king beast before their eyes or the fact that they insisted on walking this path, once the academy found out about it, their responsibility would not be light.

“Run, quickly!”

Qian Hu was also sweating profusely as he shouted desperately. His body moved and he directly fled to the front.

F * CK, a group of transcendent seventh rank and sixth rank beasts.

There were even transcendent eighth rank beasts that might chase after them. Even if there were five teachers present, they had to flee for their lives.

If things went wrong, they might even be devoured by the crocodile emperor.

When the students saw Qian Hu fleeing at the front, their faces turned slightly black.

“If it wasn’t for director Qian and the others insisting on taking this path, we wouldn’t have encountered so many ferocious beasts attacking us!”

“If we had followed the leader, we wouldn’t have encountered this group of Crocodile Emperor!”

Some of the students gritted their teeth and thought to themselves as they fled for their lives.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

Behind them, the intense sounds were getting closer and closer. The eyes of the students were filled with fear.

“Die!”

Director Qian and the other five instructors saw the weapons in their hands as they charged straight towards the attacking alligators.

They had to hold on for some time before the students had a chance to escape. Otherwise, they would definitely be crushed by this group of terrifying alligators.

They would never have thought that they would encounter such a terrifying crisis after passing through a blackwater swamp that they did not put in their eyes.
