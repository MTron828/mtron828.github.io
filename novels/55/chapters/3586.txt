3587 3,586, exterminating the great beings of the three races

Godly Dragon Roar!

Out of the more than 50 universe masters with Level 3 Combat Power, there were 12 pure-blooded godly dragons!

The rest, other than ao crab and the others, were all pinnacle dragon species!

Their roars were earth-shattering!

However, the Holy Dragon lineage, the light sound bug clan, and the light giant clan were all mutated great beings within their races!

Compared to the mutated powerhouses in the peak races, the members of the high-level races were more likely to mutate!

This was because there were very few treasures that could mutate the peak races. However, there were many more that could mutate the peak races!

However, the abilities of Wang Xian and Ling honggu were even more terrifying!

Boom! Boom! Boom

The tribe leader of the Holy Dragon King, the giant of light, the Lightsong Zerg, and the rest sensed the attack from the Dragon Palace. Without any hesitation, a terrifying energy engulfed all the members of the Dragon Palace!

Meanwhile, all the members of the Dragon Palace immediately released their energy to counterattack!

Wang Xian and Ling honggu were on the left and right respectively. They didn’t launch any attacks and attacked them at a terrifying speed!

With a terrifying speed, the two of them easily bypassed this terrifying attack and locked onto the experts of the three major races of the Holy Dragon lineage!

Whoosh

Wang Xian pushed his speed to the limit. On his shoulder, the water touch king was lying on one side while a spirit appeared on the other side. She waved the water lotus staff in her hand and waves of energy were injected into Wang Xian’s body!

His speed was even faster than the spirit red bone!

“There’s a figure rushing over. Be careful!”

When Wang Xian arrived at their side in the blink of an eye, numerous triangular eyes suddenly bloomed from the huge insects that had gathered together.

Those eyes locked onto Wang Xian and captured his movements.

However, even though he managed to capture it, it was useless!

Wang Xian’s speed was too fast!

He locked onto a huge giant of the giant of light!

The giant was at least 100,000 meters in size. Wang Xian instantly arrived in front of it.

“Starlight, be careful!”

Not far away, a giant warned loudly!

“Roar, light tremor!”

Starlight sensed the threat of death. His body trembled and a terrifying light fluctuation rushed towards his surroundings!

“Water Domain!”

When the king of water tentacles saw this attack, he let out a soft cry. The surrounding formed a water domain and enveloped Wang Xian!

Wang Xian was holding the five elements millstone in his hand!

“Die!”

The vibration of light was around him and was easily blocked by the water domain of the king of water tentacles!

He held the five elements millstone and sent waves of energy directly into it. Then, he smashed it forward!

Boom

“No, leader, save me!”

When starlight saw that his attack was blocked, he cried out for help in fear!

Crack! Crack! Crack

The five elements Millstone smashed into his body and his body trembled violently.

His life force quickly disappeared!

“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!”

The giant of light looked over and roared furiously!

“Giant of Light, kill the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace for me!”

He roared furiously with a blood-red face and waved his arm.

At the back, a few level three masters of the universe, the giant of light, lifted the enormous giant of light and smashed it at Wang Xian!

The terrifying force was like the collapse of the heavens!

“His speed is too slow!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the area. His figure flickered and he disappeared immediately!

“He is very fast up there. He is comparable to a real universe dominator!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The gigantic insects formed by the light chirping insects stared at Wang Xian with countless pairs of eyes and let out a roar!

“Sha, flame, Kill!”

However, at this moment, a cold and crisp voice was heard from the right!

A blood-red ribbon was heading straight for a divine radiant dragon of the Holy Dragon lineage!

The blood-red ribbon was beautiful and strange.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The Divine Radiant Dragon was shocked when he saw the blood-red ribbon that was heading towards him. He immediately let out a roar.

“You’re courting death!”

Beside him, another peak dragon of the Holy Dragon bloodline let out a roar and charged towards the blood-red ribbon together with him!

The Dragon Claw and Dragon Head formed by the light seemed to be about to devour it!

“Ka Ka!”

However, the blood-red ribbon was like a blood sword, easily piercing through the Dragon Claw and Dragon Head and continued to sweep towards them!

“Not good, send reinforcements immediately!”

At the side, Sacred Dragon Emperor saw this scene, and his expression changed drastically as he roared loudly!

“Instant life force, Destroy!”

Right at this time, the blood-red ribbon swept through the two universe masters of the sacred dragon lineage at a terrifying and strange speed.

The blood-red ribbon turned into a blood droplet that dodged and charged towards them!

A Light Dragon and a pinnacle dragon were instantly pierced through by the blood droplet!

Their bodies were slowly bleeding blood!

The blood covered their bodies, making them look extremely beautiful and miserable!

“Hou Hou Hou, how is this possible? Be careful, be careful of this great being from the Dragon Palace!”

Sacred Dragon Emperor was slightly stunned when he saw this strange scene, and he roared sternly!

In just a short moment, two universe master level three Great Beings of the Holy Dragon bloodline were killed!

This attack was too terrifying and strange!

How could the opponent be so powerful?

Even the leader of the ancestral Dragon Clan wasn’t this powerful!

“That’s a woman with the darkness and fire elements. She’s very powerful!”

In the middle, the gigantic light bug let out another warning sound!

However, his warning did not have any effect!

“Continue, kill!”

Wang Xian took a glance at the spirit red bone. When he saw that he had killed two level three masters of the universe by surprise, his eyes sparkled!

He let out a low roar and his body immediately transformed into the body of a divine dragon!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

A roar was heard.

“Disciples of the Dragon Palace, kill them all! Leave No one alive!”

Ao Qitian and the rest let out a furious roar in the front of the center.

“Strange, murderous, silent, and dark. Listen to the song of Despair!”

In the center, the leader of the Succubus Dragon slowly rose into the sky. She waved her extremely strange dragon wings and a black resurrection Lily slowly covered her body.

Waves of strange ripples covered the area in front of her!

“Freeze, winter world, Roar Roar!”

In the center of the group of powerhouses in the Dragon Palace, it was not ao Qitian, Ao Qi, Ao Tu, but the frost divine dragon, bei Shuang!

Wang Xian’s female disciple!

She was the mutated divine dragon of the Dragon Palace. Other than Wang Xian’s sister and wife, Fan Qinglan, bei Shuang was the only other mutated divine dragon!

The Frost Divine Dragon was an extremely terrifying existence regardless of whether it was in terms of attack or divine dragon!

She had almost no weaknesses and was so powerful that it made people despair!

She opened her dragon head and spat out a stream of white smoke. The void in front of her seemed to have been frozen!
