Chapter 1560: 1,560 Heavenly Devils appeared 6

“Heavens, what kind of monster is this!”

“What kind of dharma idol is this? It can make its claws grow by a few thousand meters, and even its head!”

“There are actually 5 Type 7 profound void realm experts that have fallen, this... this...”

In the surroundings, everyone saw the terrifying appearance of the dragon head, and those experts below the Type 7 profound void realm quickly retreated.

They retreated about 20 kilometers as they looked at the gigantic dragon head in shock.

“What the F * ck is this monster?”

When the remaining 20 powerhouses of the seventh level of the Seethrough realm saw the dragon head that was a few thousand meters in size appearing in their line of sight, everyone had a look of shock on their faces.

What kind of monster is this? !

A terrifying demonic aura spewed out from Wang Xian’s mouth and engulfed all of their dharma idols.

The Dragon Eyes, which were dozens of meters in size, locked onto the seventh-level insightful void martial artist who was like an ant.

“Crash!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, the demonic scale chains in Wang Xian’s hands moved. Numerous dark chains with sharp thorns swept towards the twenty seventh-level insightful void martial artists below.

At this moment, the remaining twenty seventh-level insightful void martial artists finally panicked.

Their eyes revealed a trace of fear, and their figures moved, quickly hiding in the surroundings.

“We admit defeat, and give those three spirit herbs to you, we won’t fight for them!”

“If we really fight with our lives, you won’t feel good either!”

One of the profound void tier 7 experts shouted out with a face full of fear, his expression extremely unsightly.

They originally thought that they could easily annihilate their opponents, yet they had killed five experts.

Furthermore, the terrifying dark chains had blocked their escape route.

“Since I have already made my move, I will not give up. You are seeking your own death!”

Wang Xian was filled with killing intent.

Since you dare to offend Ling Jian ‘er, you must be prepared to die.

As he spoke, the huge dragon head opened its huge mouth and attacked the twenty seventh level insightful void martial artists.

At the same time, the devil scale chain and the huge dragon claws attacked them at the same time.

“Do you really think that we are afraid of You? !”

With an angry and humiliated roar, the flames on one of the seventh-level insightful void martial artists intensified. He turned into a two-thousand-meter-large flaming giant and attacked Wang Xian with his bare hands.

The eyes of the other nineteen seventh-level insightful void martial artists slowly turned blood-red. Each of them was protected by energy and turned into a giant that was a few thousand meters in size.

“Hiss, what a terrifying battle!”

“Is that black creature an expert at the eighth level of the Seethrough Realm?”

At this moment, the experts from the various factions who came to check on the situation in the Black Water God Lake looked at the center of the battle with shock on their faces.

This was a life-and-death battle.

“That is?”

The two elders of the He clan looked at the terrifying dragon head and Dragon Claws. Their faces were instantly filled with shock.

They widened their eyes and looked at each other.

Wang Xian was the friend of He Yuan of the He clan, Wang Xian!

They were extremely shocked when they saw that young man transform into a terrifying dark creature that day. He destroyed the ancient demon city and killed seven demon masters.

Now, they were even more stunned when they saw him crushing more than 20 experts of the seventh level of the Seethrough void tier.

This was too terrifying!

“Do you know this creature?”

The two elders of the only sect looked at the two clan elders of the He clan. They raised their heads slightly and asked coldly.

“Yes...”

“Speak!”

The two clan elders of the He clan were somewhat hesitant. The two elders of the only sect coldly spat out a word.

In the surroundings, a group of powerful factions from the vast region looked over. Their eyes flickered with a luster.

“According to the information we received from the He clan, this creature is the Sky Demon. He was the one who destroyed the ancient city of demons!”

The two clan elders gritted their teeth and said directly.

Faced with the powerful questioning from the lone sect, they did not dare to not answer. However, they did not reveal Wang Xian.

“Sky Demon, he is the Sky Demon?”

A Cry of surprise came out from the mouths of the experts from the first-rate forces around them. They looked at the terrifying creature in front of them, who had crushed 20 experts of the seventh level of the Seethrough void tier.

He was the Sky Demon?

The Sky Demon who had destroyed the forces they feared?

“He should have reached rank 8 profound void martial expert. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have crushed 20 rank 7 profound void martial experts!”

An elder from the Wuji Empire looked at the center of the battlefield indifferently, his eyes flickering.

“All of you, come here!”

At this moment, the two elders from the only sect looked to the left five kilometers away and ordered the surrounding black-robed people.

When the black-robed people heard the order of the experts of the Solitaire sect, fear appeared on their faces.

They hurriedly flew over and shouted in fear, “Sir!”

“Why did they fight?”

An elder of the Solitaire sect stared at the battlefield and asked with a twinkle in his eyes.

“Reporting to sir, it’s because of three level eight sword heart grasses!”

The group of black-robed people hurriedly replied.

“Three Sword Heart Grass?”

The surrounding people were stunned once again. Although three level 8 void interpretation sword heart grass were precious, it was not enough to cause so many experts to fight to the death.

In fact, not even a level 7 void interpretation expert would risk their lives for this.

This...

“Three level 8 void interpretation sword heart grass? How could they fight to the death for three level 8 void interpretation sword heart grass?”

The elder from the solipsistic sect’s face turned cold as he asked them with a heavy face.

“Sir, that’s true. That... that figure who suddenly appeared said not to provoke me, and the rest of the level seven void interpretation masters wanted to kill him. In the end... In the end, they ended up like this!”

“Once someone wants to escape, he will directly stop them, not allowing them to escape at all!”

Sensing the might of the two elders, the group of black-robed men quickly bowed and said with a trembling voice.

“Not allowing anyone to escape?”

The pupils of the two elders narrowed, revealing a trace of shock.

Just for three sword heart grasses, just because 20 or so profound void tier 7 experts wanted to kill him, this sky demon did not allow anyone to escape?

“This sky demon is too crazy. Just for three sword heart grass, he wants to kill more than 20 insightful void Tier 7 experts?”

“This... this... killing is a habit. Not long after he destroyed the ancient demon city, he wants to kill more than 20 insightful void Tier 7 experts today? As expected of a Sky Demon, a demon!”

“If I am a demon, there is no demon in the world. It is true that for three spirit grass, he wants to kill more than 20 insightful void tier 7 experts. He is simply a madman. It is best not to provoke such a person!”

“We can not provoke this sky devil. Otherwise, we will be in Big Trouble!”

The first-rate forces in the vast region looked forward, their faces filled with fear as they looked at the incomparably huge dark figure.

The Devil’s might was truly unexcelled in the world!

All the first-rate forces had already decided that they absolutely could not provoke such a crazy fellow!

Even the three great super forces felt a slight fear in their hearts as they looked at this Sky Devil.

They are not afraid of powerful opponents, but afraid of this kind of crazy people who don’t care about their lives!
