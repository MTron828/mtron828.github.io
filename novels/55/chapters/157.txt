The middle-aged man taking records couldn’t hold back his exclamation and this drew the attention of the crowd.

Those who were chatting and those who were waiting to give their monetary gifts turned their heads over immediately.

“Xiao Xian, you... Are you sure you would like to give all this as a monetary gift?” the middle-aged man doing recording stood up and asked in disbelief.

“$660,000! Oh my gosh! The kid from the Wang Family is giving $660,000 as a monetary gift!”

“$660,000 as a monetary gift... He must be filthy rich!”

“I heard that Wang Xian just gave Old Zhang’s family gifts that cost $400,000 – $500,000 yesterday. Today, he gave $660,000 as a monetary gift! That would be over $1 million in total!”

“Oh my gosh. The Wang sibling is filthy rich!”

“Old Zhang took great care of the Wang siblings and their grandmother in the past. Now that the Wang siblings have gotten rich, it’s time that they start returning the kindness!”

“Isn’t this a little too extravagant. Giving out $1 million in just a few days?”

“$660,000 as a monetary gift! That’s enough to get a house in the county.

The neighbours looked over and their faces were filled with shock and envy.

Monetary gifts in the hundreds would be sufficient. Those who were closer might give a few thousand. However, Wang Xian gave $660,000 as a monetary gift! He must be really rich!

When Uncle Zhang saw the thick stack of monetary gifts, he was taken aback slightly. He stood up and walked over immediately.

“Xiao Xian, take it back. I can’t accept these. You have already spent over $500,000 on gifts. Take it back. Save it for the time when you get a wife!”

“It’s fine, Uncle Zhang. It’s just a small token. It’s only natural for me to give some gifts for Sister Li’s wedding. Just keep it and spend as you wish. I’m not lacking this money either.”

Wang Xian smiled and replied to Uncle Zhang.

“Even if you aren’t lacking these, you shouldn’t be giving so much. Take it back, son!”

“It’s really fine. When Uncle Zhang is free, come to Rivertown and I’ll bring you around.

Wang Xian waved his hand.

“This...” Uncle Zhang was hesitating. He also knew that Wang Xian was really rich now and his sister was driving a luxury car that cost over $4 million.

However, he was still really moved to see Wang Xian willing to spend $1 million on him.

Uncle Zhang patted Wang Xian on his shoulders and continued, “I didn’t really help you guys much and the help isn’t worth that much!”

“Uncle Zhang, some gratitude shouldn’t be measured in monetary terms!”

Wang Xian replied to Uncle Zhang in a serious tone.

“Sigh. Alright then. Although I don’t have a son, having you as a nephew is better than having a son!” [1]

Uncle Zhang was teary-eyed and moved.

“Uncle Zhang, you should go entertain your neighbours. You don’t have to be so courteous with us!”

Wang Xian smiled.

“Great, great!”

The gloominess that hung over Uncle Zhang was gone and he revealed an excited look. This nephew of his had really made him proud!

“Don’t just stand here, get a seat inside. The banquet will be starting soon. Please take a seat and wait a moment.”

“Old Zhang, you are really lucky. Your daughter is marrying into a rich family and now you have such a nephew. I’m really envious!”

“Yea, Old Zhang! $660,000 as monetary gift! I believe you could enjoy the remainder of your life.”

“Haiz. Who would have expected the Wang siblings to return Old Zhang’s kindness in such a way?”

“The Wang siblings are really rich now and Old Zhang is really lucky!”

“If we had...”

As the crowd was discussing, some were feeling regretful. If they had taken care of the Wang siblings previously, they might be the ones on the receiving end right now.

“Can you guys shut up and stop your babbling? Are you treating this as your house? Have you guys not seen the outside world before?”

At this moment, a cold sneer sounded from the side.

The crowd was slightly shocked and turned around.

At one end, a slightly plump and burly young man extended his arm and revealed his tattoo. He was pointing at the crowd and shouting.

“Damn you! Can’t you keep your volume down?”

Seeing that everyone had looked over, he shouted at them once again.

Seeing this, Uncle Zhang’s expression changed. He immediately walked over and apologized, “I’m sorry that we have gotten a little noisy. I’m sorry!”

The bride and groom beside the young man stared at Uncle Zhang coldly and sneered, “I wonder what you guys are babbling about. The groom isn’t here and yet you guys are making so much noise.”

“That’s right. The groom can’t be seen. Perhaps he’s not coming,” the groom and the bride remarked sarcastically.

The young man beside them raised an eyebrow and added, “Oh, so the groom isn’t here yet. Hehe. Are you guys hosting a wedding banquet with a dead person? What is there to be happy about?”

The mockeries of the bride and groom had embarrassed Uncle Zhang. When Uncle Zhang heard what the young man said, his face turned red immediately.

He was already mad that the groom wasn’t here today. Now that he heard others commenting that his daughter was marrying a dead person, his body shivered in anger.

“You, you... You better watch your words!” Uncle Zhang said in agitation.

“You better clean your mouth. Have you eaten shit?”

When Wang Xian heard the young man and saw the embarrassed looks on Uncle Zhang, he walked over emotionlessly as he spoke to the young man.

“So what if I’ve said it? I, Fenghai, have not been afraid of anyone in Pengzhou!” the young man replied arrogantly to Uncle Zhang and Wang Xian.

“They are here, Fenghai. Don’t waste your time entertaining the group of clowns!”

At this moment, the groom saw cars stopping outside and immediately reminded Fenghai.

“Tsk, trash!” Fenghai sneered at Wang Xian before turning to the groom and nodding his head. He saw people were arriving at the entrance and the three of them immediately went over.

“That’s too much!” Uncle Zhang looked at their back views, feeling embarrassed.

“These young men are really rude and arrogant!”

“Yeah, they are too arrogant. Is this something a human would say?”

The surrounding neighbour commented and also looked at the back views of these young men with displeasure.

“That is!”

However, at this moment, a middle-aged man was shocked to see the group of people that these young men had gone over to receive.

Walking at the front was a middle-aged man in a suit. He was full of smiles.

Uncle Zhang and his neighbour knew this middle-aged man well. He was one of the top figures in the entire Feng Lake County.

The middle-aged man didn’t have a good reputation. He had a group of underlings and no one in the entire Feng Lake County dared to offend him.

They saw the middle-aged man talking with the groom and bride while also trying to get on the good books of Fenghai.

“Du Qingshan! That’s Du Qingshan! He’s actually trying to get on the good books of that young man!” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“That young man must have a strong backing for Du Qingshan to be acting so respectfully!”

“Du Qingshan is here! Look at those behind him. Aren’t those famous businessmen in Pengzhou? Oh my gosh. The families and friends of this family are really awesome!”

“We can’t afford to offend them. Since even Du Qingshan is trying to get on the good books of them, Fenghai must be someone influential in Pengzhou too. There’s no wonder why they were so arrogant!”

The surrounding crowd looked in shock as they witness the arrival of the group of people.

Uncle Zhang looked even more ghastly. He clenched his fist tightly but his expression gradually turned into a helpless look.
