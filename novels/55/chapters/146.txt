Chapter 147: Shiver in Fear (2)

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Elder Fang and Elder Zhou shared a huge conflict all the time. A month ago, Elder Fang had found a talented disciple, but Elder Zhou snatched that disciple away.

Everyone knew about this, but none of them said anything. After all, that disciple had the final right to choose Elder Zhou.

Elder Fang could only suffer her loss in silence.

The middle-aged woman, Elder Zhou, cast a glance at Elder Fang as she straightened her body on the chair and continued looking at the field.

“Next, Wang Yu!”

One by one, the young girls and boys went up to the stage. When the youthful voice was heard again, Xiao Yu threw a nervous look at Wang Xian.

“Go on!” Wang Xian said to Xiao Yu with a smiling face.

“Okay.” Xiao Yu nodded as she walked perturbingly towards the Assessment Crystal.

“She’s the one you brought?” Vice Sect Leader Lei asked Elder Fang on the stage when he saw Xiao Yu walking up the stage.

“Yes.” Elder Fang nodded. “She’s not bad.”

“Is she better than Qiu Yun?” Elder Zhou, who was next to her, said with a smile.

Elder Fang frowned and kept her silence.

Several elders around them shook their heads at this.

High-class talents were one in a million. How could it be easy for Elder Fang to seek another one again?

“To practice the ancient martial art, it’s not only about being a talent, but also depends on the personal efforts and understanding!” Vice Sect Leader Lei consoled her.

“That’s true. Hehe!” Elder Zhou chuckled in agreement, but her tone was full of sarcasm.

Elder Fang remained calm and fixed her gaze on Xiao Yu.

She knew that Xiao Yu was a talent, but she was still far from the disciple which she’d found a month ago.

I just ask for her to be someone of good character, unlike the previous one! Elder Fang had coldness flashing in her eyes as she thought to herself.

“Heh, I want to see what kind of talent you are!” Zi Yan’er, next to Wang Xian, glared at Xiao Yu with a smirk.

“Only that juvenile from the Song Family was better than you. The rest are not as good as you. Hehe!” the middle-aged man beside her said to his daughter as he watched the training ground with a prideful face.

“Place your hand on the crystal!” On seeing Xiao Yu on stage, the young man instructed her.

“Okay.” Xiao Yu nodded as she placed her hand slowly.

Everyone’s attention was fixed on Xiao Yu.

“She’s quite pretty!” Song Aowen from the Song Family commented smilingly when he saw Xiao Yu.

“Hehe, you’ve grown up.” Song Aowen’s father patted his shoulder and said, “If you like her, go ahead and woo her. You are old enough!”

“Hehe.” Song Aowen giggled and observed Xiao Yu from head to toe.

Xiao Yu placed her palm onto the crystal.

One second.

Two seconds.

Three seconds.

“Hur? No reaction?”

All the people were stunned as they stared at the crystal with surprise.

The crystal had no reaction at all. It was as though it was not activated.

The young man standing at the side watched in surprise. Why is there no reaction from the crystal at all?

“What’s the matter?” The higher management members on the platform knit their eyebrows.

“Could the Assessment Crystal break down?” An elder raised the question.

“Impossible. The Assessment Crystal can never break down,” an elder rebuked immediately.

Elder Fang knit her eyebrows. She darted out and landed beside Xiao Yu. After careful examination, Xiao Yu’s palm was touching the Assessment Crystal firmly.

“Master, this... this doesn’t seem to be responding!” Xiao Yu looked at the crystal under her hand with confusion. She was at a loss.

“Lift your hands!” Elder Fang said with a frown.

“Okay.” Xiao Yu nodded and raised her hand.

Elder Fang stretched her hand out, and a tinge of black color appeared in the crystal.

She raised her eyebrow before she grabbed Xiao Yu’s hand and placed it on the Assessment Crystal again.

“What’s the matter?” Vice Sect Leader Lei stood up on the platform and asked doubtfully.

“Is she a jinx or what?” Elder Zhou said wickedly.

All of the people were watching curiously as they wondered what was happening.

Elder Fang had mixed expression when the Assessment Crystal was not responding to Xiao Yu’s touch.

She hesitated before she placed her hand on Xiao Yu with flickering eyes.

Immediately, a stream of Internal Energy passed through Xiao Yu’s hand and went towards the Assessment Crystal.

Om!

With a soft sound heard, the Assessment Crystal seemed to be activated as it was giving off a luster glow.

The glow continued to be incandescent under the moonlight.

“This...” Elder Fang narrowed her pupils with a trembling body. She stared at the glowing Assessment Crystal with disbelief.

She could not believe it even now. Even when the crystal was glowing, she still felt like it was a dream.

“This is...!”

Suddenly, the Vice Sect Leader Lei’s eyes were agape. He could not help but exclaim with a shaking body as he looked at the glowing Assessment Crystal.

His roar was so loud that some average people found it unbearable.

“Flawless and pure, Inborn Constitution!” Elder Zhou stood up immediately as she repeated the words with a shaken and nasty look.

“Flawless and pure, Inborn Constitution!” All the elders stood up too. One by one, they darted out and showed up in front of Xiao Yu.

“What’s the matter? Why are the higher management members of the Thistles and Thorns Sect so excited?”

“That young girl can make the Assessment Crystal give out a white luster glow. What’s going on actually?”

“Judging from the look of the higher management members, it seems like that girl is a tremendous talent!”

“What does ‘pure and flawless’ mean?”

On seeing the excitement of the higher management members, everyone was puzzled as they discussed.

“Xiao Yu, you actually have an Inborn Constitution. An Inborn Constitution! But I checked on you... You!” Elder Fang could not believe it as she grabbed Xiao Yu on her shoulder and spoke with excitement.

“Master, I have no idea either!” Xiao Yu was lost as she looked at her master. Seeing all the elders and Vice Sect leaders beside her, she turned back to peer at Wang Xian timidly.

“Little girl, let...let Grandpa check your body.” The Vice Sect Leader Lei stretched out his hand to Xiao Yu with a shaking voice.

Xiao Yu was puzzled as she looked back at Vice Sect Leader Lei. Did he call himself Grandpa?

Xiao Yu stretched out her hand.

With a pair of trembling hands, Vice Sect Leader Lei did not look like a vice sect leader now. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

All the surrounding elders stared hard at them with heavy breaths.

Vice Sect Leader Lei placed his hand gently on Xiao Yu’s hand as though he was afraid he might hurt her.

He closed his eyes, and a gentle stream of Internal Energy flowed into Xiao Yu’s body. The energy went through her eight extraordinary meridians slowly.

Vice Sect Leader Lei’s body was shaking as tears of excitement slowly ran down his cheeks.

Fu*k! It’s really the Inborn Constitution!
