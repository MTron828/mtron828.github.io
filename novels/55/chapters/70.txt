Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Apart from Mr. Liu and his clique that night, close to hundreds of people who turned up for dinner at First-grade Restaurant saw the luxurious line-up of the seafood.

Every customer who walked in was dumbfounded by the world’s best seafood.

What’s more, these seafoods could only be found on the news.

They thought the recent improvements from Longxuan Restaurant were already impressive. But now, they simply paled in comparison!

That night, Wang Xian instructed that all the promotion events of the First-grade Restaurant be sent to the customers on their contact list via their phones.

No other message was sent except for the “50% off.”

Yet, those images were shared on the social media feed among people within Rivertown that night.

“Crazy! Do you know what the best seafood in the world is? Australia Lobster, King Crab? Those are crappy. Let me tell you what the best seafood in the world is.”

Below the caption were some pictures with One-headed Abalone, Atlantic Bluefin Marlin, Chinese Bahaba fish.

“Splendid. This is the most awesome restaurant I have ever seen. The First-grade Restaurant is going the hell out of the way. All One-headed Abalone, Atlantic Bluefin Marlin, Chinese Bahaba fish are now 50% off.”

The photos and the information were shared on the WeChat feeds, which subsequently gave rise to some online jokes.

“I’ll marry any nouveau riches who treat me to a meal at First-grade Restaurant!”

“Bro, follow me to a feast at First-grade Restaurant. I’ll bring you, and you’ll bring the money!”

“How much does it cost to go all-out eating at the First-grade Restaurant? The price of your house!”

“I’m sitting in the private room of First-grade Restaurant while having abalone, sashimi and Chinese Bahaba fish. I envy those who are having street food outside. Sigh, my life is tough!”

Within a short period, the god-like First-grade Restaurant was plastered all over the WeChat feeds. Many people were prepared to check the restaurant out.

The next morning.

The entire old street was filled with a festive atmosphere as Longxuan Restaurant opened their doors early in the morning.

The dancing lion and dragons were performing non-stop on the road outside the Longxuan Restaurant.

At the entrance of Longxuan Restaurant stood 10 gorgeous-looking models who were smiling all the way.

Director Xie, his brother and the manager of the Longxuan Restaurant were standing in front of the restaurant with smiles all over their faces. They were happy to see the crowd gathering at their door.

“Director Xie, it’s only 9 am now and what a crowd we have. There will be more people when we officially open at 9.30 am. I bet they will start having their food at 9.30 am!”

“Haha, of course. We’re having a promotion of 50% off today. It will be a pity if you are not eating the top-grade seafood at half price,” said Director Xie, laughing out loud.

“Brother, the First-grade Restaurant is not even open yet. Interesting,” the juvenile next to Director Xie said with a smile.

“That restaurant will be closed forever!” said Director Xie confidently.

“Director Xie, the beauty, Lin Qingying is here. More people might be coming later!” At this time, the manager of Longxuan Restaurant saw a pretty girl with a pair of big sunglasses. An assistant was following beside her too.

“Oh? Get her to come over now. Ask her to sing a song later and participate in the opening ceremony of Longxuan Restaurant!” Director Xie said while beaming.

“Got it.” The manager nodded and went over immediately.

“Brother, we should hire a top star for our opening. Why would we get someone who is a B-lister?” the juvenile asked Director Xie.

“Lin Qingying might be a B-lister, but she is a special case. She’s a star who loves food, and her reviews are spot-on. Hence, she has a huge base of fans who are foodies. Getting her is much more appropriate than hiring other A-listers!” Director Xie beamed as he spoke.

“You’ve got great foresight, Brother,” the juvenile smiled and replied.

“Xiao Feng, you’re still young. There are things you need to learn!” Director Xie smiled at his younger brother. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Yes, Brother.”

A simple stage was set up at the entrance of the Longxuan Restaurant.

“Hi, Miss Lin Qingying!” Director Xie greeted Lin Qingying with a face full of smiles when he saw her walking over.

“Hello, Director Xie!” Lin Qingying smiled and nodded with slight arrogance.

Director Xie did not mind at all. He knew that Lin Qingying was quite well-off. She gained her popularity from being a foodie and from the two songs she sang. She was not the one who was short of money. Now, he was the one who needed her help.

“Miss Lin Qingying, we’ll need you to sing a song for us and introduce the Longxuan Restaurant later. Is there any problem?” asked Director Xie with a smile.

“No problem, Director Xie. Since I promised to take on this job, I’ll definitely do my best!” Lin Qingying tidied her hair and nodded.

She was 1.7 meters tall with a perfect figure, and she looked fit. Her lips may have been thin, but they were seductive in their own way.

“Welcome, everyone, to Longxuan Restaurant. Today is the opening of the Longxuan Restaurant. We are officially announcing our arrival in Rivertown with the most top-grade seafood and the most delicious food. In this opening ceremony, we have invited the renowned foodie star, Miss Lin Qingying! Next, let’s invite Miss Lin Qingying to introduce the Longxuan Restaurant, which has a rich history!”

The host stood on the stage with a microphone as he did the introduction. The beautiful and enchanting Lin Qingying walked up to the stage with a handheld microphone and a smiling face.

“Hello, everyone. I’m Lin Qingying. I’m very honored to be invited here for the opening ceremony of Longxuan Restaurant. The Longxuan Restaurant...”

“Lin Qingying! She’s pretty. Let’s go over now.”

“Lin Qingying was invited to this restaurant’s opening ceremony. This restaurant is splendid.”

“The publicity of the Longxuan Restaurant these past few days was strong. I have also heard that it is a high-class seafood restaurant with lots of expensive seafood ingredients. They are quite awesome.”

The presence of Lin Qingying on the stage drew all the people on the street instantly.

Director Xie curved his lips into a smile when he saw the crowd, which almost blocked the entire Longxuan Restaurant.

“This time, I want the entire Rivertown, or even the nation, to go crazy with my restaurant opening!”

Director Xie held his fist tightly as he revealed a confident look. He looked at the First-grade Restaurant, which had yet to open, with his lips slightly drawn!

At this time, a bunch of food lovers who had nothing to do rushed over when they heard the news.

“The First-grade Restaurant opens at 9.30. Since they are not open yet, let’s check out the Longxuan Restaurant first!”

“Longxuan Restaurant might have strong publicity, but they seem to lose out to First-grade Restaurant by a lot. In any case, we can check them out since we’ve got nothing to do. I think there’s a celebrity over there! ”

Some customers joined the crowd at Longxuan Restaurant, which was not far away, when they saw the closed door at the First-grade Restaurant.
