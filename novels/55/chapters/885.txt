Translator: 549690339

Night gradually descended. When the sky turned dark, it would be much more dangerous.

Wang Xian landed in an empty space with a satisfied expression. Around him, there were more than 300 level one big-mouthed piranhas guarding him.

These piranhas could not leave a range of two thousand meters from Wang Xian. Once they exceeded this range, they would immediately escape. Without any intelligence, it would be difficult to subdue them.

Wang Xian was not interested in subjugating them either.

“HMM? The sounds of Long Yi and the rest fighting!”

Wang Xian, who was living comfortably with the jade glue, suddenly raised his head and looked ahead. He stood up slowly with a smile on his face.

“Troublesome. I was thinking of dealing with all of you tomorrow!”

Wang Xian stood up slowly. With a wave of his arm, he killed all the big-mouthed piranhas and kept them into his interspatial ring. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

These piranhas were used to nurture the members of the Dragon Palace.

With a leap, the night of the ocean turned dark. Dark clouds blocked the bright moon in the sky.

The sounds of the battle were very loud. They were at least seven to eight kilometers away from Wang Xian.

“I didn’t expect you guys to be so strong. It seems like we have underestimated you guys!”

“However, you guys must die no matter what. And that damn young man!”

Just as Wang Xian approached, a cold female voice was heard.

“Haha, You Want To Kill Us? Wishful thinking. When our leader arrives, all of you will have to die. Do you think you can kill us? Wishful Thinking!”

A rough voice was heard, and his tone was filled with disdain.

“HMPH, how dare you spout such arrogant words!”

“Pay attention, they are very strong!”

The sounds of battle could be heard. Wang Xian looked at the location of the battle and slowly descended from the sky.

In front of him, a bonfire lit up the entire area. Eight drakonids were fighting against Ao Xue, bei Ming, and Qingfeng, the geniuses of Shenghai Town.

The eight of them were not at a disadvantage against the nine of them. In fact, if it were not for the formation treasure in their hands, they might have already lost.

At this moment, ao Xue, bei Ming, and Qing Feng looked extremely embarrassed as they attacked with murderous eyes.

“Is there someone fighting?”

“That voice just now seemed to be ao Xue!”

“It’s them!”

When Wang Xian arrived, two small teams rushed over from the surroundings.

At night, other than the sound of the waves, there was also the sound of their battle. It was very eye-catching.

When Wang Xian and the rest arrived, two small teams had already rushed over.

There were also people flying over one after another.

Wang Xian landed at the edge and looked at the field. With the current strength of the DRAKONIDS, they couldn’t do anything about it.

“Hiss, it’s Ao Xue and Bei Ming!”

“That’s true. They actually fought with those eight people to a standstill!”

“Who are these people, their strength is so strong!”

At this moment, the examinees also surrounded them, their faces full of shock as they looked at the battle’s location.

Ao Xue, Bei Ming, and Qing Feng were the geniuses of Holy Sea Town, possessing the strength of second level transcendents at such a young age.

The rest who followed beside them were all elite disciples nurtured by the Dogfish mercenary group, Bei Ming, and Qing Feng’s family.

However, they were actually on par with this group of complete strangers.

“I really didn’t expect that our holy sea town would have so many young talents hidden!”

A young man who acted alone walked over and looked at the group of drakonids with his eyes flashing.

There were more than 100,000 people who had reached the extraordinary realm in holy sea town. Among these 100,000 people, 90% of them were at the first level of the extraordinary realm.

Now that the eight drakonids were at the peak of the second level of the transcendence realm, they were considered good fighters. Most importantly, they were still very young.

It was not an exaggeration to say that they were young and talented.

“Zhao Zhixiong, come and help us. Kill them, and we will give you enough benefits!”

At this moment, bei Ming, who was fighting, suddenly turned his head and roared in a direction.

There, a red-haired young man was holding a staff in his hand and looking forward.

Beside him, five youths stood behind him expressionlessly.

“Oh? Benefits? If you give me twenty piranha jades, I can consider taking Action!”

The youth named Zhao Zhixiong said to Bei Ming with a smile on his face.

“F * ck, why don’t You F * cking snatch it!”

Bei Ming roared loudly as the longsword in his hand blocked the DRAKONID’s attack, and his expression changed.

“Five thousand middle-grade spirit stones!”

Ao xue shouted, “Is there anyone who can help us? If you help us, we’ll be friends in the future!”

“Five thousand middle-grade spirit stones!”

The surrounding people were moved.

“Haha, we want to be friends with Ao Xue!”

Zhao zhixiong narrowed his eyes and immediately laughed.

“Including us, you dare to offend the geniuses of Our Holy Sea Town? You’re simply courting death!”

After Zhao Zhixiong finished speaking, the seven to eight young men beside him exchanged glances and said loudly.

“Alright, help us kill them. We will definitely not mistreat you!”

A hint of coldness flashed in the eyes of Ao Xue and the other two as they said coldly.

“Haha, Alright!”

The group of people did not hesitate and replied loudly.

“Everyone, are you courting death by attacking my people?”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and said coldly when he saw more than a dozen of them preparing to attack.

“HMM?”

Wang Xian’s voice stunned everyone.

“Leader, leader!”

The group of drakonids were delighted when they saw Wang Xian and shouted hurriedly.

“It’s You, Kid!”

“Zhao Zhixiong, cripple him first and leave him alive. I’ll kill him myself later!”

Ao Xue revealed an excited expression when she saw Wang Xian.

“Alright, let’s kill this brat first!”

Zhao Zhihai and the other team turned their heads with a smile. Their faces slowly turned ferocious as they looked at Wang Xian.

“We have no enmity between us. If you dare to make a move, you will have to bear some consequences!”

Wang Xian looked at them expressionlessly.

“Haha, a Price? We would like to see what kind of price is there?”

A group of over ten people stared at Wang Xian with ferocious expressions as they walked towards him slowly.

“Hurry up and cripple that brat!”

Bei Ming endured the attack of a drakonid. His face turned slightly pale as he shouted loudly.

“Alright, Master bei Ming, don’t be anxious!”

Zhao zhixiong chuckled as he stared at Wang Xian. “Cripple his limbs!”

“This bunch of people are really unlucky!”

“That’s right. A bunch of small fries actually dared to provoke ao Xue and Bei Ming. They are simply courting death!”

“This bunch of people are not weak. It’s good that they are dead. There are fewer competitors!”

At this moment, forty to fifty people gathered around. When they saw Zhao Zhixiong and the rest, they said with a smile on their faces.

“Cripple my limbs?”

“Die!”

When Wang Xian heard their words, a hint of killing intent flashed across his eyes. He moved his body for a moment.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

In an instant, seaweed plants within a radius of 1,000 meters grew crazily and attacked them densely.
