Translator: 549690339

In addition, the Dragon Gate and the Dragon King had disappeared from Jianghu for more than a year. Therefore, almost all the immortal sects had forgotten about this once powerful force in Jianghu!

It was as if a big figure would not remember a commoner.

However, they were different. When the Dragon King made his move, Feng Jinqing could already confirm that the Dragon King was an immortal-level existence.

Therefore, he paid close attention to the Dragon King and the Dragon Gate, and checked all the news about the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate.

When he saw all the experiences of the rise of the Dragon Gate and the Dragon King, he couldn’t help but sigh slightly.

A heaven-gifted genius and a monstrous existence, like the reincarnation of an immortal God.

“He is actually an in-name disciple of an immortal god. No wonder he has such terrifying strength and talent at such a young age in the real world!”

Elder Feng Jin Qing sighed slightly.

“Stop spewing vulgarities. Let Me Ask You, why did you bully my martial nephew just now!”

Xiao Yu saw Feng Ling Tian’s shocked expression and reached out to grab his long braids.

“A gentleman speaks but doesn’t make a move!”

Feng Ling Tian shouted out in despair.

“I’m sorry, I’m a Woman!”

Xiao Yu stared at him mockingly.

“I’m not an elder of the immortal sect, why would i care about so many things!”

Feng Lingtian looked at his long hair being held tightly and being pulled unconsciously, and helplessly began to shift the blame.

This caused the surrounding elders of the immortal sect to twitch their brows violently.

“Cough cough, this matter is indeed our negligence!”

Elder Feng Jinqing’s figure moved, landing beside Xiao Yu and cupping his hands at her. “We will definitely handle this matter well. Miss, since your martial nephew has joined our immortal sect, it is also our honor!”

“I’m not afraid of normal competition. I’m just afraid that you people will gang up on my martial nephew and Bully Outsiders!”

Xiao Yu was also very polite to elder Feng Jinqing’s gentleness.

“Don’t worry, don’t worry. Since this old man has promised, I will definitely not go back on my words. I also know that this disciple Xiao ran will definitely be nurtured in the same way as the heaven chosen disciples of the immortal sect in the future. There won’t be any injustice!”

Elder Feng Jinqing promised.

“Then I’ll have to trouble this old man!”

Xiao Yu smiled and felt a little embarrassed.

“It’s fine, it’s fine. This is the first time this young lady has come to Our Yellow Heaven Immortal sect, right? Tomorrow, I’ll let this disciple bring you around and play here for two days!”

Elder Feng Jinqing said with a smile.

“Sure!”

Xiao Yu nodded. She had originally planned to stay here for two days.

“Tomorrow, you’ll bring me around here!”

Xiao Yu tugged at the long hair in her hands and said to Feng Lingtian with a smile.

“I...”

Feng Lingtian’s eyes widened and his face turned red.

However, just as he finished speaking, his head tilted and Xiao Yu’s arms slowly wrapped around his long hair, forcing him to lower his head.

“Good, good, good. Great Aunt, let go, let go!”

Feng Lingtian quickly said.

“That’s more like it. In the future, I will tell you that I have some friends in Your Yellow Heaven Immortal sect. In the future, help me take care of them. If...”

“Don’t worry, don’t worry. Leave it to me. Leave everything to me. I will definitely not let them suffer any grievances!”

Before Xiao Yu could finish, Feng Lingtian immediately squeezed out a smile and promised.

“That’s a good girl!”

Xiao Yu nodded her head in satisfaction. At this moment, her phone rang.

“HMM? My Brother’s video!”

Xiao Yu let go of Feng Lingtian’s long hair and took out her phone to answer the call.

Although holding the phone was a little out of place in an ancient city, this was the world today.

Two terrifying powerhouses might suddenly ring while they were fighting: You Are My Little Apple’s cell phone ringtone.

“Brother!”

Xiao Yu looked at the video and said with a smile.

“Are we there yet?”

Wang Xian was sitting in the villa and asked with a smile.

“We are here. We are now in Huangtian City. We have seen sect leader Tang, Xiao ran, Xiao clan, and Sui clan!”

Xiao Yu nodded and laughed. “Oh right, brother, let me show you a person. Haha!”

As she spoke, she pointed the video at Feng Lingtian. “It’s him. He’s the guy I taught a lesson to a year ago. Today, I beat him up again!”

When Feng Lingtian saw Wang Xian in the video, he forced a smile on his face and nodded respectfully. “Hello, brother! Hello!”

After all, he knew that Wang Xian was an immortal God and was worthy of respect!

“Alright, Alright. When did you have such a hobby? When will you be back?”

Wang Xian looked at his pathetic state and revealed a meaningful smile on his face. He couldn’t help but smile.

“Hehe, in two days, I will be back after playing with the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect in Yellow Heaven City for two days!”

“Alright, take care of your safety. Enjoy yourself. I still have some things to take care of!”

“Alright Brother!”

Xiao Yu hung up the video call and realized that there were people standing on the rooftops in all directions. He felt a little embarrassed.

“Sorry to disturb everyone!”

Xiao Yu bowed to the surroundings, causing the people from yellow sky city to be slightly stunned. They quickly nodded their heads.

“Alright, we still have to eat. Tomorrow, bring us around and I’ll let you recognize us!”

Xiao Yu looked at Feng Lingtian and said to him.

The corner of Feng Lingtian’s mouth twitched and he clenched his fists tightly. He gritted his teeth and said, “Alright!”

“If you dare not come, I’ll beat you up every time I see you in the future!”

Xiao Yu raised his fist and waved at elder Feng Jinqing before walking towards the restaurant.

Feng Lingtian took a deep breath and looked up at the sky.

He was really afraid that tears would flow out of his eyes. F * * K, how could there be such a witch.

He could not beat her in a fight. In the past, he could at least escape, but now, he could not even escape!

“Everyone, disperse!”

Feng Jinqing said to the thousands of people surrounding them.

“Disperse, disperse!”

Everyone looked at their crown prince with a strange expression and dispersed.

Seeing their expressions, Feng Lingtian almost found a hole to hide in.

This time, his crown prince had lost all his face! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Feng Lingtian!”

“Lingtian!”

In the surroundings, the proud sons of heaven who were with him earlier rushed over and shouted at him with a strange expression.

“Don’t bother me!”

Feng Lingtian said impatiently.

“I will get someone to investigate today’s matter!”

Feng Jinqing looked at the group of young men and women and said with a slightly sullen face.

The group of young men were stunned for a moment before a trace of nervousness appeared on their faces.

In their hearts, elder Feng was not as amiable as before. On the contrary, he had always been very strict.

Today’s matter was caused by them and they were going to be punished!

“Lingtian, Jinqing, come over!”

Right at this moment, a voice suddenly rang out beside Feng Lingtian and Feng Jin Qing’s ears.

Their expressions changed slightly.

“It’s father!”

“It’s sect leader!”

The two of them nodded their heads respectfully and flew towards the direction of the immortal sect.

When the surrounding people heard elder Feng and Feng Lingtian, they knew that the sect leader had witnessed what had just happened!

They just didn’t know why their son didn’t make a move after being beaten up!
