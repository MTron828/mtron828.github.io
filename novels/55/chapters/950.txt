“Huh? What’s wrong? Liuyan, do you know them?”

Zhou Hanhan looked at Jin Liuyan in surprise and asked curiously.

“How many Spirit Stones is the commission for this mission?”

Jin Liuyan asked in astonishment.

“Fifty thousand middle-grade spirit stones. You know that if it weren’t for you, our family wouldn’t be able to form a small chamber of Commerce!”

Zhou Hanhan said as she held her arm.

“50,000 middle-grade spirit stones? Hanhan, your luck is really good!”

Jin Liuyan said somewhat speechlessly.

“What’s Wrong?”

Zhou Hanhan looked at him in surprise.

“That young man is the leader of the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group, the King of the Holy Sea town mercenary group. Not long ago, the Monsters of Holy Sea Town attacked the city, and that young man killed everyone!”

“During the monster siege, the Fairy Phoenix mercenary group destroyed the Mirage Sea mercenary group, which was a 5-star silver mercenary group. Their leader was a level 6 transcendent!”

“Then, they destroyed the knife scar mercenary group. The Knife Scar mercenary group was once the strongest mercenary group in Holy Sea Town. Their leader, Knife Scar, was a level 7 transcendent!”

“That young man is very mysterious. At such a young age, he has two attributes, wood and fire. He is a monster and a prodigy!”

“Since you are able to hire them, it must be because the demon hunters academy is about to start its semester. He is heading to Donghai City to enroll!”

Jin Liuyan introduced him to Zhou Hanhan.

“This...”

Zhou Hanhan widened her eyes. “So... so powerful? Doesn’t that mean that I have gained a huge advantage!”

“What do you think?”

Jin Liuyan’s eyes were sparkling as she stared at Wang Xian. Her eyes were filled with shock.

Such a prodigy was unstoppable even in the entire star-moon kingdom, not to mention the genius disciples in their academy.

Compared to him, they were miles apart!

“Liuyan, looking at the way you worship him, don’t tell me you have fallen in love with him?”

Zhou Han clicked her tongue slightly. When she saw Jin Liuyan’s expression, she suddenly said mockingly.

“Such a young prodigy, even I admire him!”

Jin Liuyan didn’t try to hide anything and said generously.

“That’s true. If he’s really as powerful as you say, all the beauties in Donghai City will pounce on him!”

Zhou Han said softly.

A prodigy of a generation would attract countless beauties.

This was a world of powerhouses. As long as one had the strength, it was normal to have multiple wives.

“Let’s go and get to know each other!”

Jin Liuyan hesitated for a moment before walking towards Wang Xian.

“Hello, Captain Wang!”

Just as Wang Xian was sitting and drinking tea, a female voice sounded.

Wang Xian turned around and nodded at them. “Hello!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“I’ve heard so much about you!”

Jin Liuyan smiled and walked to the side before sitting down.

“I didn’t expect that I would be able to hire such a powerful mercenary group like Xianfeng!”

Zhou Hanhan also smiled as she spoke to Wang Xian.

“Hehe, I’m heading to Donghai City as well. It’s on the way too!”

Wang Xian smiled as his gaze swept across the two girls. Zhou Hanhan’s looks were above average. Jin Liuyan could be said to be a great beauty.

“With leader Wang’s strength, if you were to enter Donghai City, even the prodigies of Donghai city would pale in comparison. I heard that you are going to enter the Demon Hunter Academy?”

Jin Liuyan asked with a smile.

“Yes, I’m going to enter the Demon Hunters Academy to gain some experience!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“We are students of the Eastern Sea Academy. However, we have also joined the mercenary group of a senior from the Demon Hunters Academy! Is this your first time going to the Eastern Sea City?”

“Is that so? This is my first time coming to the Eastern Sea City!”

Two girls came over to chat with him. Wang Xian did not reject them and began to communicate with them.

He didn’t know anything about Donghai city. It was also his first time entering the city of the supernatural continent.

He learned a lot from them.

“Han Han, this must be someone from the mercenary group, right? Let’s go, we’re leaving!”

More than half an hour later, a middle-aged man walked over and said to them.

“Alright, let’s go. We’re leaving. The journey will take seven days!”

Zhou Hanhan stood up and said to them.

Wang Xian and the rest also stood up and walked out of the hiring association.

“Come, come, come. All the carriages, line up!”

Just as they walked out of the hiring association, there were shouts coming from outside.

Wang Xian looked over and saw nearly 200 carriages lined up neatly in two rows. They looked very imposing!

“The Zhou Chamber of Commerce will move your carriages to the last position!”

At this moment, two old men walked up to them and spoke directly to Zhou Han’s father.

“What?”

Zhou Han’s father was slightly taken aback. “What’s wrong? Didn’t we draw lots and decide the order? Why are you asking us to go to the last position?”

“Alright, Alright. Isn’t the last position pretty good? Hurry up and go if I ask you to go!”

The two old men stared at him and said with a sullen face.

“You... Good!”

Zhou Han’s father nodded with a sullen face.

“What’s wrong, father? Why did you let us be the last?”

Zhou Han saw it and quickly walked to her father’s side and asked.

“Sigh, forget it. Let’s be the last. The seats at the back are also okay!”

Father Zhou said with a sullen face, “Because of Miss Jin, we took down a batch of fierce beast corpses from the mayor’s mansion and offended the ancient river chamber of Commerce and the Green Vine Chamber of Commerce. They are somewhat against us. Originally, our fleet should be in the center of the lot drawing, but now...”. Let’s Go! Let’s Go

Father Zhou was a little unhappy as he spoke.

“These guys!”

Zhou Hanhan glared at the two largest teams in the middle of the town angrily.

“Brother mercenary group, we are at the back of the caravan. It will be tough on all of you for the next seven days!”

Father Zhou looked at Wang Xian and the rest. “We just need to be vigilant. If we encounter any ferocious beasts, the entire caravan will be attacked by hundreds of mercenary groups!”

“Don’t worry. We will escort you safely to Donghai City!”

Wang Xian nodded and said with a smile.

“Alright, Alright. Thank you for your hard work. Let’s get on the carriage!”

The two rows of caravans were two to three hundred meters long. They were pulled by strong horses and many members of the mercenary group were following them on horseback.

Father Zhou didn’t say anything when he saw that they didn’t have any horses to carry them.

After all, they had only offered fifty thousand spirit stones. It was already good enough for them to hire a mercenary group with extraordinary fifth rank experts!

The Chamber of Commerce walked out of the south gate and headed toward East Sea city.

It was already night time. Because they had to cross a swamp in ten hours, they had to set off at night. During the day, they would arrive at that relatively dangerous area.

“All mercenary groups are responsible for their own region’s problems. Especially the mercenary groups at the front and back, be a good scout!”

At this time, an old man directly flew into the sky and ordered all the mercenary groups.

“He’s the vice-leader of the Spirit Beast mercenary group in East Sea City, a powerful existence at transcendent seventh grade!”

“We only need to be on guard!”

Hearing the voice of the old man in the sky, some of the mercenary groups whispered.

Wang Xian gestured to a golden swordfish and asked him to follow behind.

With Ao Yao and the rest around, Wang Xian wasn’t worried at all.
