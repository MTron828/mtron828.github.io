“Brother, if Sect Leader Tang wants me to inherit the Thistles and Thorns Sect as the Sect Leader after four or five years, do you think I should do it?”

“Do whatever you like. Just letting your vice sect leader handle the sect’s affairs will do. Didn’t Sect Leader Tang do that to Vice Sect Leader Lei? Since Vice Sect Leader Lei and Sect Leader Tang will assist you, you shouldn’t have much to worry about.”

“But I’ll be just 23 or 24 then. Am I not too young? I’m afraid they will not listen to me!”

“In the Ancient Martial Arts World, people respect those who are highly skilled. Since you possess strength at such a young age, people will be respectful to you...”

“But...But...”

“If you don’t want to be the Sect Leader, you can just say no!”

Wang Xian and Xiao Yu laughed as they walked towards the carpark area near the Thistles and Thorns Sect. They walked as they exchanged conversation after midnight.

On hearing the last answer from her brother, Xiao Yu was displeased and she pouted. “But I want to become the Sect Leader. I want to uphold the righteous and help the weak, leading the Thistles and Thorns Sect to become the strongest sect. Then, I’ll be the renowned Xiao Yu, a female God of War and Warrior of the Ancient Martial Art World. Hehe.”

As she spoke, she seemed to be imagining herself to be the next Sect Leader, leading the Thistles and Thorns Sect and becoming a female God of War.

Wang Xian chuckled. “Well if you want to be a female God of Waryou must work hard. If you want to cultivate, I have ways to speed up your process in attaining Inborn Realm.”

“Really, brother?” Xiao Yu asked, brightening up her eyes.

“Yes, within half a year. Half a year is good enough for you to attain the Inborn Realm.”

Wang Xian smiled as he spoke to Xiao Yu. For Dragonians, Wang Xian could help them to attain the Inborn Realm within a hundred days even if they were average people. But Xiao Yu did not have the Divine Dragon bloodline. For her to achieve the Inborn Realm, half a year would be good enough.

“Half a year?” Xiao Yu parted her lips slightly. Then she nodded her head with a resolute look on her face.

Wang Xian beamed as he looked at the motivated Xiao Yu.

“Let’s go home the day after tomorrow,” said Wang Xian to Xiao Yu.

“Okay, Sister Li’s wedding is on October 3rd. Uncle Zhang is having a wedding banquet!” Xiao Yu said with a smile.

After they sat in the car, the middle-aged driver started the engine and drove them home.

“We’re fortunate this time. With the rise of the Thistles and Thorns Sect, it will be more advantageous to us!”

“That girl is quite a daunting talent. A Saintess! You must respect her when you see that girl in the future!”

“Yes, father.”

“Thanks to her, you can get into the Thistles and Thorns Sect this time. Practice hard on your cultivation.”

“Saintess’s brother is somebody. He could even talk to Sect Leader Tang, a Half-step to Inborn Expert, on an equal status. You must find a way to befriend the Saintess. She’s the future Sect Leader of the Thistles and Thorns Sect!”

When the Saintess and her brother went into the car, those middle-aged and old men reminded their children since they were following behind Wang Xian and Xiao Yu from about ten meters away.

The Song Family was among them too. They cast their respectful and fearful gazes on the young man and girl who went into the car.

“Your grandfather wants us to please the Saintess since she will be the leader of Thistles and Thorns Sect in the future. Also, it would be best if we could curry favor with her brother too!” An old man looked around the family members and spoke slowly.

“The Saintess’s brother, Miracle Doctor Wang?” Song Aowen frowned.

That young man was only older than him by a few years. In the beginning, Song Aowen had been a genius. But now, a girl appeared and surpassed him immediately. He was already feeling uncomfortable with it. If he was asked to please the Saintess, he had nothing to say. But he did not have to please the young man.

“Your grandfather is in charge of the Information Department of the Thistles and Thorns Sect. According to the information he got, he thinks that the Saintess’s brother is even more daunting than the Saintess. Remember how the rogue cultivators and the rich from Rivertown were acting tonight?”

Song Aowen froze and frowned.

“Your grandfather suspected that her brother does not only possess formidable medical skills, but also has mighty strength. Of course, all these things were speculation. But whatever we saw was already good enough to give him our respect,” the old man continued.

Song Aowen slightly hesitated before he nodded his head. “Grandfather, I know what to do.”

“Mm!” The old man nodded slowly.

...

When Wang Xian and Xiao Yu reached Xiao Yu, it was almost 1 am. The dormitory was locked. So they had to sleep in separate rooms in the hotel.

In such a situation, Wang Xian wondered if he should get a house.

As soon as the thought was planted, he could not control it from growing. If he had a house near the sea, he would not have to stay in the dormitory anymore.

Besides, he rarely went to school nowadays. Staying in the dormitory was inconvenient to him.

If he lived near the sea, he could go directly as and when he wanted to.

Moreover, it was inconvenient to date Guan Shuqing if he stayed in the dormitory. If he got a house outside... heh heh heh!

Wang Xian burst out with kinky laughter as he thought about it. After all, he was already 20 years old. Sometimes, his underwear got wet during his sleep.

Heh heh!

A sea-view house in Rivertown would cost over ten million. But he could afford to get one now.

It was one day before the National Day holiday, and it also marked the last day of the military training.

During the last night of military training, the school held an orientation night. The programs were quite good, but Wang Xian and Xiao Yu were not in the mood for it.

Xiao Yu had started her cultivation ever since she obtained the Art of Cultivation.

Wang Xian was speechless upon seeing her overdone way of cultivating.

On the first day of the holiday, Xiao Yu drove Guan Shuqing home before they headed back to their home.

Their hometown was next to Lake Xianfeng at Feng Lake County, in Pengzhou City. The county was small with lovely scenery.

When the pink Bentley drove into the county, it drew a lot of surprise from many people.

Such a luxury car almost did not exist in the county.

The car drove to the northern part of the county near Lake Xianfeng, which was surrounded by paddy fields.

About seventy to eighty residents were residing on one stretch of the paddy fields.

As it was far away from the city center, this area was also much of the countryside.

The road was smooth with poplar trees planted by the residents on both sides. Each poplar tree was more than ten meters in height.

During summer, those aunties and uncles who had nothing to do loved to gather under the shade for mahjong or chit-chatting sessions.

Looking around at the surroundings, Wang Xian felt a sense of belonging.

“What a beautiful car!”

When the pink Bentley was driving down the road, the surrounding people under the shade were staring at it with shock.

“This... this ‘B’ logo. Is that... a Bentley? Oh right, I heard their cars cost a few million each.”

“Wow, a few million? We can buy a few houses in the city center of this county.”

“It’s a dead-end in front. I wonder who their relatives are.”

“Who has such rich relatives?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

As everyone looked doubtfully at the car under the shade, the car stopped in front of the single-story house.

A young man and a young girl stepped out of the car.
