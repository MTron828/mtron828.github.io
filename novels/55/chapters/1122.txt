Chapter 1123: 1124, under a cloud piercing arrow

Translator: 5496903

Skymoon, soul chasing, one arrow killing!

This was a legendary existence in star-moon kingdom!

There were only two legends in star-moon kingdom. One was the star-moon royal family, and the other was the Skymoon Island.

Now, two powerful factions had actually joined forces to attack their dragon-phoenix city, causing the citizens in the city to reveal embarrassed expressions.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

At this moment, the second round of attacks arrived. Arrows pierced through the air and instantly appeared in front of the dragon-phoenix Army.

“Defend!”

The deputy leader of the dragon-phoenix Army roared. This time, even though they were prepared, more than a dozen people still fell to the ground under the terrifying arrows.

The Heavenly Moon chasing soul was not as simple as it sounded.

Archers were like snipers on the battlefield.

Especially under such circumstances, their surroundings were all empty. There were 20,000 soldiers in front of them to help them defend against their opponents. Their 500 people did not have any worries at all.

And among the 500 people of the Heavenly Moon Soul Chaser, all of them were top-tier existences.

The weakest was at transcendent-level rank 6, and the strongest was at half-step void interpretation.

When the two armies fought, if one side had archers behind them, the side without archers would definitely be afraid during the battle.

Because you didn’t know when a bow and arrow would fly over and sink into your forehead.

Especially such top-tier archers.

The people of dragon-phoenix City revealed embarrassed expressions. Those experts who went out to help in the battle were basically killed in an instant.

Zhang Fengying, who had rushed out, would have been pierced through by an arrow if ao Jian and the others had not helped to block the arrow.

This made her extremely embarrassed as she stood there with clenched fists.

“I didn’t expect that star-moon kingdom would actually send out so many experts. This is almost two-thirds of the entire star-moon kingdom’s strength!”

Feng Luan frowned, her expression somewhat unsightly.

“King Feng, what should we do now? The other party actually sent out so many experts, and there’s even the Heavenly Moon Sect’s Heavenly Moon Soul Chaser!”

Jin Qianyuan came to Feng Luan’s side and said with an unsightly expression.

“Kill!”

As he spoke, the dragon-phoenix Army’s 1,000 plus people had already collided with star-moon Kingdom’s army.

The first to bear the brunt was the powerful Black Fiend Battle team.

1,000 men against 20,000 men. If it weren’t for the 500 archers at the rear, they wouldn’t have been afraid at all.

However, the archers at the rear forced them to guard against the arrows that suddenly attacked them.

Moreover, as the core strength of the Heavenly Moon sect, the Heavenly Moon Soul Chaser could easily hit a person even in a densely packed crowd.

Even for such an expert, he could even control the trajectory of the arrow.

The instant collision caused the dragon and Phoenix Legion to be at a complete disadvantage!

Mang Hong and the other two saw the archers behind them. Their faces revealed a furious expression as they tightly gripped the weapons in their hands.

However, at the opposite position, five auras locked onto them.

“Hehe, let me show you how terrifying our Tian Yue Soul Chaser is!”

At the back, five hundred people stood in a row with proud expressions on their faces.

A middle-aged man’s lips curled up slightly and his face was filled with confidence.

Feng Luan stood there and watched as dozens of soldiers were killed in less than a minute. She clenched her fists.

These were the subordinates that she had painstakingly groomed. Every time she lost one of them, it would cause her great heartache.

“The war between soldiers has already been lost. I can only...”

Feng Luan’s eyes were filled with determination as she looked at Mang Hong and the other two.

“Wait, it’s not over yet!”

However, before she could finish her sentence, Wang Xian patted her shoulder and looked to the left of the battlefield.

“Huh? Wang Xian, what do you have...”

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Just as she opened her mouth, she heard the sound of arrows piercing through the air.

Every round of attacks would result in the deaths of at least a dozen soldiers of the dragon and Phoenix Army.

Now, they were already fighting with the soldiers of the Star Moon Army. Without any defense, there would be more casualties.

Feng Luan frowned and quickly looked over.

Arrows shot at the soldiers of the Dragon and Phoenix Army from a tricky angle.

“Oh no!”

“They are no match for them. Those five hundred guys with archers are too cunning!”

“It’s over, it’s over. Our Dragon and Phoenix Empire will not be...”

At this moment, not only Feng Luan’s expression was extremely ugly, even the citizens of Dragon-phoenix city were somewhat desperate.

This suppression was too great!

“WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH!”

Just as everyone’s faces were filled with embarrassment and even closed their eyes, the sound of wind whistling came from the left.

Numerous green light spots were like meteorites that fell from the sky.

“It’s over!”

“I’m going to die!”

On the battlefield, dozens of people from the dragon and Phoenix Legion looked at the arrows that were almost in front of them, their eyes filled with despair.

“Haha, Go To Hell!”

Beside their ears, the excited roars of the star Moon Legion soldiers could be heard.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

Just when they were filled with despair and thought that they were going to die, an intense collision sound suddenly rang out in front of them.

The arrow that was right in front of them was directly struck by an arrow that was condensed from green wind attribute energy, and it fell towards the ground.

The soldiers of the Dragon and Phoenix Legion revealed shocked expressions on their faces.

Even the soldiers of the Star Moon Legion who were surrounding them also had shocked expressions on their faces.

“WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH!”

At this moment, the sound of an arrow piercing through the air rang out once again. The expressions of the soldiers of the Dragon and Phoenix Legion instantly changed. However, when they glanced behind them, they were shocked to discover that the Heavenly Moon Soul Chaser behind them did not attack.

The sound came from the left.

“Cloud Piercing Arrow!”

A soft shout came from the left, and everyone hurriedly looked to the left.

Xing Guang, the five insightful void martial experts, Mang Hong, and the other three, as well as Feng Luan and everyone in Dragon and Phoenix city, all looked to the left.

What entered their eyes was a group of green-colored demonic beasts with long arms and two horns on their heads flying over.

Their bodies were emitting green energy, and they held a longbow in their hands. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

This green longbow was much larger than an ordinary bow.

Everyone’s faces were filled with astonishment.

“Ahhhhhhhhhhh!”

At this moment, a miserable cry sounded on the battlefield.

Everyone looked over and couldn’t help but suck in a breath of cold air.

A hollow position appeared in the center of the entire battlefield.

Corpses lay on the ground, their bodies crisscrossing the entire battlefield.

There were people who were still alive on the ground, groaning in pain.

Out of over three hundred arrows, three to four thousand people had fallen.

Even the members of the Black Fiend Battle team had dozens of people lying on the ground, not moving at all.

A neat bloody scar appeared on the battlefield.

A cloud-piercing arrow, a cloud-piercing arrow, and a bloody cloud.
