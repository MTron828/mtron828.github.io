Chapter 1062: 1063 disobeyed the order

Translator: 5496903

“This...”

When everyone heard Qian Hu’s words, they turned to look at Wang Xian. After all, the leader was Wang Xian. If he wanted to take a detour, they could only obey him.

“Student Wang Xian, according to what you said, we will encounter ferocious beasts wherever we go. Why don’t we take the direct route? If we waste this time and Donghai Academy and Oceanography Academy arrive early, we will be embarrassed!”

Qian Hu saw that everyone was looking at Wang Xian. His expression was a little unpleasant as he spoke directly.

“Listen to my orders. Go to the left!”

Wang Xian didn’t care about Qian Hu at all. He was the leader. who did he think he was.

He shouted loudly and ordered everyone.

“Wait, just as Qian Hu said, taking a detour will delay us for a very long time. If we waste an hour, the East Ocean Academy and Oceanography Academy will definitely arrive earlier than us. This is related to the glory of our Demon Hunters Academy. It’s not good to lose in our first competition!”

Suddenly, director Qian’s voice came from the sky.

Everyone was slightly stunned as they looked over.

Director Qian stood in the sky with his hands behind his back. He looked down at Wang Xian and said, “With your strength, as long as you don’t encounter a large group of powerful ferocious beasts, it’s nothing to worry about. There’s no need to waste time!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“There are many ferocious beasts in front of us. We can’t defend against them!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and looked at director Qian.

“Hehe, we can’t defend against them? But there are still five instructors who are related to the glory of Our Demon Hunter College. If we encounter any trouble, the five instructors will lend a helping hand!”

Qian Hu walked forward, he shouted loudly, “For the glory of the college, even if we encounter some difficulties, we have to face them head-on. Let the East Ocean College and the ocean college take a look. Compared to Our Demon Hunter College, they are a bunch of cowards and a bunch of flowers in a greenhouse!”

“That’s right, it’s just some difficulties. With the presence of five instructors, even if there are fierce beasts, we can easily resolve them!”

“Whether there is any danger ahead has yet to be determined. I feel that we should take a straight path and not waste time!”

A few youths who had been following Qian Hu stood out and echoed.

“I feel that we should listen to the words of the instructors!”

“That’s right, that’s right. Director Qian is an expert at transcendent level eight. With director Qian around, we won’t be in any danger!”

The rest of the students looked at each other and whispered.

Even Xia houming and the rest were a little hesitant.

In front of Wang Xian and the teachers of the academy, they naturally trusted the teachers of the academy.

“It’s very dangerous ahead. If we go this way, we will definitely suffer heavy losses!”

Wang Xian frowned and stared at director Qian. He said forcefully, “I’m the leader. I’ll decide where to Go!”

Director Qian saw Wang Xian staring at him forcefully and a cold glint flashed across his eyes.

The four instructors at the side also frowned slightly. There was a hint of displeasure in their eyes.

They were the instructors of the Demon Hunters Academy. From the beginning, they had said that they were late and they didn’t bother about it.

Now, they were saying the same thing again.

This made them very uncomfortable.

Although they said that you were the leader of the team this time, the few of US instructors were the ones who really had the right to decide.

Don’t think that just because you have the strength of a level seven extraordinary, you can be arrogant and look down on anyone.

“Go to the front!”

However, after Wang Xian finished his words, director Qian said coldly, “For the glory of the Academy, all students, go to the front!”

“Director Qian, will you be responsible if you encounter danger?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and asked him directly.

“Hehe, this Wang Xian, can you be responsible if you encounter danger if you mislead?”

Director Qian’s face revealed a hint of mockery. “You can’t, but I have the ability to ensure the safety of the students.”

“Wang Xian, the Academy has sent the five instructors to follow us to ensure our safety. The five instructors have the greatest authority. Do you really think that you don’t take the instructors seriously just because you are the leader? How arrogant!”

Qian Hu who was at the side said mockingly. A hint of pride could be seen in his eyes.

This Wang Xian dared to disobey his father and the few instructors. HMPH, he was simply courting death.

“Since director Qian has said so, captain, let’s listen to director Qian!”

“That’s right. We will listen to the instructors. The instructors won’t be wrong!”

The students behind him also said hurriedly.

Although Wang Xian was very strong and the subordinates following him were also very strong, how could they be stronger than five teachers?

Furthermore, not listening to the teachers of the academy and listening to the leader of a new student?

“Since you all want to court death, you can leave directly. Those who follow me to the left, come out directly!”

Wang Xian glanced at them coldly and said directly.

“Follow you to the left?”

When the five instructors heard Wang Xian’s words, they were slightly angry.

“HMPH, in this mission, you have to follow the instructors’orders. Do you really think that you can do whatever you want just because you are the leader?”

Director Qian stared at Wang Xian coldly and shouted directly.

“It’s just a matter of choosing where to go. If your instructors have to decide this, you can just lead the team directly!”

Wang Xian retorted with a deadpan expression.

“You...”

Director Qian’s expression changed slightly. “Alright, Alright. Those who want to follow this team leader, follow him. The rest of you, follow me!”

“What a waste of time!”

As he spoke, he flew straight ahead. The other four teachers snorted coldly and glanced at Wang Xian.

“Follow him!”

After saying that, they flew straight ahead.

“Let’s go, let’s follow the five tutors!”

“Follow them, of course we have to follow the tutors!”

“Although this captain is very strong, isn’t he taking himself too seriously?”

“That’s right. The mission this time is of course to follow the orders of the tutors. Moreover, the five tutors are much stronger than him. Now, they are even putting on the dignity of a captain and acting arrogantly!”

In an instant, the students immediately followed. They glanced at Wang Xian with a hint of mockery in their eyes.

“Team leader, we will follow you!”

“Team leader Wang Xian, we believe in You!”

Xia houming hesitated for a moment before walking towards Wang Xian.

No matter what, Wang Xian was his savior. It was impossible for him to leave at this moment. That would be too disloyal.

More than a dozen girls from the amethyst mercenary group came to Wang Xian’s side without any hesitation.

One of the girls followed Wang Xian to the wind chime forest last time. She had witnessed Wang Xian’s terrifying insight.

What Wang Xian said earlier was definitely true.

If Wang Xian and director Qian could calm down and send someone to investigate first, they would be able to get a perfect result.

However, it was obvious that director Qian had a problem with Wang Xian.

All the graduates from the Void Beast mercenary group and amethyst mercenary group stayed behind. There were a total of more than 30 people.

“Follow me. Let them die!”

Wang Xian looked at the group of people who had left with a hint of mockery on his face.

He could vaguely see the situation five kilometers ahead. It would be fine if he followed them.

However, if it was them, they would definitely suffer heavy losses.

However, Wang Xian was not so kind as to be mocked by others. He had to save them and help them.

Wang Xian only agreed to this mission after seeing that the demon hunters academy treated him well.

However, this did not mean that he had to be their nanny even when he was being mocked.

“Yes, Captain. We believe in You!”

Xia houming and the rest nodded immediately.

“Go left!”

Wang Xian led them straight to the left.

If they went left, their speed would definitely be faster than before. Even if he followed them and asked Ao Jian and the rest to kill the ferocious beasts, they would still be inferior to the left.

Therefore, director Qian’s decision was completely wrong.
