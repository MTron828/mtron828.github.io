Chapter 1372: 1372 wiped out 100,000 in one strike

“He escaped? The Dongyuan King actually escaped!”

“All the soldiers of the Dongyuan dynasty actually escaped, this... this...”

“Wiped out the power of the one leaf continent dynasty?”? “I know about the one leaf continent dynasty. That’s the most powerful existence among the dozens of dynasties nearby us. Could it be that this dynasty has been wiped out?”? “Furthermore, the Dongyuan King Looks so frightened. Was It Lord Wang and the others who destroyed it?”

“It must be. I didn’t expect Lord Wang to destroy such a huge dynasty. It’s simply too terrifying!”

The Dongyuan King’s escape caused everyone from the dragon-phoenix dynasty to be stunned.

What the hell, was there a need to be so cowardly?

However, when they heard the Dongyuan King’s words, they were all in a daze.

Many people knew of this powerful dynasty. It was not an exaggeration to say that the one leaf dynasty was even stronger than the three dynasties that had just united. However, what they did not expect was that.., such a dynasty had been destroyed by Lord Wang and the others!

How terrifying!

“No wonder the people of the Dongyuan dynasty were fleeing like they had wet their pants. They did not even care about the image of the King!”

Some of the soldiers of the dragon and Phoenix Dynasty thought to themselves.

“Kill! Kill them all! If they don’t attack me, I Won’t attack them! Kill them all!”

A general of the Dragon and Phoenix Dynasty roared when he saw that the soldiers of the Dongyuan dynasty were about to escape. He was filled with killing intent!

“Kill!”

The soldiers of the Dragon and Phoenix Dynasty roared with killing intent as they chased after them.

“Run! Run! Run!”

At this moment, the 150,000 soldiers of the Dongyuan dynasty were in complete chaos.

They had come here thinking that they could kill wantonly and have fun with the women of the Dragon and Phoenix Dynasty.

However, they didn’t expect to encounter a force that even the king was terrified of.

The soldiers fled into the distance in fear.

The entire army was in complete chaos.

“If you want to kill, we will send you to hell!”

Just as the 150,000 soldiers and powerhouses of the Dongyuan dynasty were fleeing frantically in all directions, Wang Xian’s cold voice rang out.

The five elements millstone that was suspended in the sky was operating slowly.

Wang Xian’s body trembled. The entire five elements millstone trembled slightly as well. A greyish destructive energy charged towards the 150,000 soldiers in front of him.

The greyish energy covered an area of two kilometers.

Like a long river, it swept towards the place with the highest number of people.

The speed was so fast that some insightful void martial artists could not Dodge in time.

“There’s an attack from the back. Defend!”

“You want to leave me here? Impossible! Run!”

One of the generals sensed the greyish energy sweeping towards him. His expression changed slightly as he charged forward and flew into the sky.

The other insightful emptiness realm expert clenched his teeth tightly and charged forward.

“Block, block, Block!”

The gray energy that covered an area of two kilometers and penetrated seven to eight kilometers arrived. An insightful emptiness realm expert at the back shouted loudly.

His body was emitting a thick and heavy earth energy. His entire body was completely covered by the earth energy.

The Earth attribute defense was the strongest.

However, just as he finished speaking, the gray energy covered his body.

His entire body trembled, and his eyes widened slightly.

The Earth attribute energy on his body slowly descended.

His life force vanished, and his body fell towards the ground.

“Weng!”

The gray energy covered an area of 7-8 kilometers.

It was as if a black ink had been left on a piece of white paper.

Silence, Silence!

“Ahhhh!”

A rank 2 void interpretation expert who had just started flying towards the sky quickly dodged the attack of the gray energy and flew upwards.

However, his legs were still swept by the gray energy. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

A terrifying destructive energy entered his legs.

He let out a loud roar and hurriedly flew upwards. It could be seen that his legs had completely lost their vitality.

“What?”

“This is impossible!”

“Oh my God!”

Following the expert’s roar, when he looked downwards, the surrounding soldiers saw the area that had been wiped out by the gray energy.

In an instant, their eyes widened, filled with fear.

At least two-thirds of the entire army, at least 100,000 people, had fallen to the ground.

There was not the slightest bit of life, nor were there any screams. They fell to the ground directly.

There were even quite a few profound void martial experts among them.

The remaining 40,000 to 50,000 people were somewhat dazed. Looking at the 100,000 people who were instantly killed, each of their eyes were filled with fear.

One Strike to kill 100,000 people?

“No, I don’t want to Die!”

“Devil, he is a devil!”

The remaining soldiers of the Dongyuan dynasty screamed in despair.

Some of them even collapsed on the ground.

100,000 of their comrades were killed in one strike. How could they escape?

“Roar!”

The members of the Dragon Palace rushed over and killed the 50,000 soldiers who had already collapsed.

“Hiss, Lord Wang is too terrifying. He destroyed 100,000 soldiers in one strike. This...”

“Heavens, he’s too powerful. With just Lord Wang alone, he can destroy an entire dynasty, right?”

Everyone from the dragon-phoenix dynasty stared with their eyes wide open. They looked at the peerless expert floating in the sky, their eyes filled with reverence.

“This... this strength, no wonder he was able to destroy the one leaf continent dynasty!”

The king of the Dongyuan Kingdom, who had already fled nearly ten kilometers ahead, turned his head and took a glance, his eyelids twitching.

He could already imagine how terrifying it would be to destroy that mysterious force from the one leaf continent dynasty. However, he had never expected that the other party would actually destroy 100,000 elites of his Dongyuan dynasty in one move.

His heart was dripping with blood. The soldiers who had followed him here to subvert the dragon-phoenix dynasty this time were the most elite army of the Dongyuan dynasty!

“If there’s a chance, I will definitely take revenge. I will definitely kill all of you and leave no one alive in your dragon-phoenix Dynasty!”

His eyes turned bloodshot.

Originally, he had thought of coming to the dragon-phoenix Empire to bring those two treasures over. With those two treasures, his strength would greatly increase.

It would also be of great benefit to the entire Dongyuan Empire. However, he had never thought that he would encounter the faction that destroyed the one leaf continent empire!

“Just you wait!”

He growled, glanced behind him, and continued to flee.

He wanted to return to the dynasty, collect all the treasures, and then... Abandon his country and flee!

“Do you think you can escape?”

At this moment, a cold voice sounded out beside his ear, and a figure of light and darkness appeared in front of him.

“Pu!”

“What... i...”

He widened his eyes, which were filled with disbelief.

Buzz

Everything disappeared, including the king’s body.

“Kill them, don’t let them escape!”

Roar! Roar

Angry killing sounds and the roars of the members of the Dragon Palace.

Soon, the army of the Dongyuan dynasty was destroyed.

At this point, the armies of the four countries were all destroyed!
