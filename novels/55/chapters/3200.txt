Chapter 3201: 3,200 stars shook the starry sky

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Star ink map galaxy.

The star ink map galaxy was what the ancient painting sect called their territory.

More than 10,000 stars gathered, and each star was emitting a luster.

From Afar, it looked like an extremely beautiful starry sky.

The ancient painting sect was different from the Heavenly Dragon Clan.

The Heavenly Dragon Clan’s territory only had that sea. They didn’t have their own planet, nor did they have their own people.

The ancient painting sect was different. They were a human race, and the human race was one of the largest races in the universe.

The ancient painting sect had trillions of people and a deep foundation.

Their experts grew stronger and stronger from generation to generation.

But unfortunately, they provoked the Dragon Palace.

The current star ink map galaxy hadn’t received any news that their experts had been destroyed.

Even the ordinary disciples did not know that their ancient art sect was heading to the distant Milky Way to annihilate the dragon palace.

“It’s really a bright starry sky.”

Wang Xian and the rest flew in the galaxy of the star ink map. Looking at the bright starry sky in front of them, they said faintly.

“Their ancient art sect has already formed a powerful inheritance. Generation after generation, unless all their citizens are annihilated, it will be difficult to completely destroy them.”

“However, this is a devastating blow to the ancient painting sect. Almost all the universe knights have been destroyed.”

The willow deity said faintly from the side.

“The headquarters of the ancient painting sect is on the bridge of the ancient painting planet. Come, let’s go.”

As Wang Xian spoke, his gaze landed on the center of the galaxy.

The bridge of the ancient painting planet was a huge bridge connecting more than ten planets and more than ten mountain ranges of the ancient painting sect.

This was the headquarters of the ancient painting sect, and it was also the most prosperous place of the ancient painting sect.

The Holy Land of the ancient painting sect.

Wang Xian and the rest were moving very fast. Half an hour later, the Magnificent Bridge of the ancient painting planet appeared in their line of sight.

“Seal off the surroundings.”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the Holy Land where the mountains connected to the planet and said.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The Forty Universe Knights of the Dragon Palace moved and immediately came to the left and right of the Ancient Painting Planet Bridge.

They stood in the void and a terrifying aura surged out from their bodies.

Boom! Boom! Boom

In the next moment, waves of dragon might crushed toward the ancient painting planet bridge.

“HMM? who dares to behave atrociously in our ancient painting sect?”

When waves of power swept over, five to six old men flew out from the center of the bridge on the ancient art planet.

Their eyes were filled with a terrifying killing intent.

Behind the five to six old men were a few hundred young and middle-aged men.

Their eyes swept toward Wang Xian and the rest, and their faces sank.

Swoosh

Wang Xian moved and arrived around the group at a terrifying speed.

Numerous chains sealed the surroundings.

“Huh?”

The pupils of the few people from the ancient art sect shrunk slightly when they saw this scene.

“Who are you?”

The old man in the middle stared at Wang Xian with a sullen face. His expression changed. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Hehe, Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian smiled and introduced himself lightly.

“Dragon King…”

Upon hearing Wang Xian’s words, the expressions of the few old men obviously changed.

“I don’t want to waste any more time. I’m here to inform you that your time of death has come. Your ancient art sect is about to be exterminated.”

As he spoke, chains shot towards them.

“Dragon King, stop. We are from the Xingjiang clan.”

An Elder’s expression changed drastically as he shouted immediately.

“Oh?”

Upon hearing his words, Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and looked at the elder who spoke. “Take out something to prove your identity. Leave within three seconds. Otherwise, don’t leave.”

A voice filled with dominance entered the old man’s ears, causing his expression to change drastically.

Behind him, a few young men revealed furious expressions.

“We are disciples of the Xingjiang clan. Are you trying to threaten us?”

A young man couldn’t help but growl in a low voice.

“PFFT!”

However, just as he finished his sentence, a chain pierced through him instantly.

He widened his eyes and revealed a shocked expression.

“Since that’s the case, let’s all die.”

As Wang Xian spoke, the chains pierced through them instantly.

“Dragon King, we are from the Starriver clan. Are you trying to make an enemy out of our Starriver clan by killing us?”

The universe knight-level elder of the Starriver clan had a shocked expression on his face. He immediately shouted loudly.

“Hehe.”

“I have already exterminated the ancient painting sect and the Heavenly Dragon Clan. Why would I be afraid of your Xingjiang Clan? How dare a mere disciple act so arrogantly in front of me?”

Wang Xian had a look of disdain on his face.

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

In the next moment, chains penetrated their bodies.

“Soul capture!”

At the same time, he waved his arm. The body of an expert from the ancient painting sect, who was at level two of a universe knight, trembled slightly. A stream of information entered Wang Xian’s mind.

“What are you doing? How dare you behave atrociously in our ancient painting sect!”

“TSK TSK tsk, behave atrociously. I will destroy all of you today.”

Boom

The sound of an attack was heard, accompanied by screams.

“Everyone, kneel down for me. Don’t even think about escaping. Behave yourself. Otherwise, I will slaughter your entire ancient painting sect today.”

Ba Qi’s cold voice spread across the entire ancient painting planet bridge. The killing intent on his body was not concealed at all.

“Hu!”

Wang Xian opened his eyes at this moment. A cold expression appeared on his face.

He swept his gaze across and kept the corpses.

According to the old man’s memories, when the Paragons of the ancient painting sect went to the Dragon Palace, to prevent any accidents from happening in their headquarters, they invited a few paragons from the Xingjiang clan to be guests.

This was mainly to intimidate some small fry.

“Kill all those above level three void God realm.”

Wang Xian absorbed some of the memories and opened his eyes, giving out a killing order.

Since the ancient painting sect wanted to destroy their dragon palace, their Dragon Palace could not allow the ancient painting sect to revive.

Kill all those above level three void God realm.

As long as the inheritance of the ancient painting sect was broken, the ancient painting sect would fall into complete silence.

“It’s the Dragon King, Jie Jie Jie, the trash of the ancient painting sect wants to destroy our Dragon Palace. Today, we will break your inheritance.”

“Everyone kneel down. Those above the void God Emperor Rank 3, come out and commit suicide. Otherwise, this father will start a massacre!”

Ba Qi threatened with a dense expression.

They did not need to make a move. As long as the disciples of the ancient art sect did not obey, they could blast a planet apart. It would depend on whether they wanted to live or to save the other disciples.

Wang Xian swept his gaze and flew straight to the location below.

According to the memories he obtained, he had already determined the location of the ancient art sect’s treasury.

“Gulp!”

“How… How could this happen? All the experts of our ancient art sect were killed?”

“The Dragon Palace attacked? They actually attacked. They want to destroy our entire ancient art sect.”

On the bridge of the ancient art planet, countless disciples of the ancient art sect trembled and their faces were filled with shock.
