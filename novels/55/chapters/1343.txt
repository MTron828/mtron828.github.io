Chapter 1344: 1344 destruction of the country 5

In front of the Palace of the Sky Island dynasty, the sudden outbreak of the battle shocked everyone.

The terrifying lightning covered an area of a thousand meters. The entire area was completely covered by the Lightning.

Everyone from the Sky Island dynasty quickly retreated to the surroundings.

At this moment, the gray energy released by Wang Xian directly met the Lightning Prison released by the leader of the electric eel.

It was a terrifying energy and a violent energy.

When the two types of energy collided, a scene that stunned everyone appeared.

The gray energy easily engulfed the Thunder Hell and attacked the leader of the electric eel without slowing down.

At the same time, the gray area covered the entire electric eel tribe.

“Oh no, no, no... What kind of energy is this?”

The leader of the electric water eel trembled slightly when he saw his energy being destroyed. A hint of fear appeared in his eyes.

“You puny electric water eel tribe are courting death!”

Wang Xian stood there and stared coldly at the four to five hundred beasts of the electric water eel tribe. His body trembled.

The grayish energy covered the aquatic electric eel monsters at an even more terrifying speed.

“What?”

“Oh no, the leader couldn’t resist it!”

“Run!”

Looking at the grayish energy that was right in front of them, the leader of the aquatic electric eel shook his body in fear, wanting to escape into the distance.

However, even though the leader of the aquatic electric eel was covered in lightning, his entire body was completely frozen when the grayish energy swept past him.

It was as if the river of history had directly pulled him into it.

The corpse of the leader of the electric eel fell to the ground, and the gray energy once again swept towards the electric Eel Demon Beast clan.

“No...”

The electric eel demon beasts saw their leader being killed in an instant, and they let out terrified roars.

Even their leader could not withstand the attack, how could they possibly withstand it?

Obviously, they couldn’t!

Screams of terror rang out in the banquet hall where the Sky Island dynasty and the one leaf continent dynasty were getting married.

“How... How is this possible? The Water Electric Eel Demon Beast Clan has close to twenty insightful void realm experts, and their leader is a level three insightful void realm expert. This... is instant kill!”

“His strength... His strength... is comparable to our King!”

“Since when did the dragon palace have such a terrifying expert!”

When the surrounding people saw this scene, their faces were filled with shock.

Prince Jiang and Princess Yi ye sucked in a breath of cold air, and their bodies couldn’t help but take a few steps back.

One move to kill an expert of their Sky Island dynasty.

One move to exterminate the entire aquatic electric Eel Demon Beast Clan!

How terrifying!

The King of the Sky Island Empire, who was walking over with murderous intent, froze when he saw this terrifying scene.

The murderous intent on his body slowly dissipated. He widened his eyes and stared at Wang Xian in shock.

He knew that he couldn’t destroy the entire tribe of the electric eel demon beasts with one move.

“Hiss, too strong!”

The tens of thousands of people surrounding Wang Xian and the rest couldn’t help but suck in a breath of cold air. Their faces slowly turned ugly.

Looking at the pile of corpses, no one from the heaven-island empire had expected that someone would dare to cause trouble on this day.

The strength of the other party had also exceeded everyone’s expectations.

“This master of the Dragon Palace, isn’t it not a good idea to make a move at my son’s engagement banquet with the one leaf continent Empire?”

Behind them, the king of the heaven-island empire took a deep breath. He stared at Wang Xian coldly and said with a gloomy face.

The other party dared to kill them here at this moment. This meant that he was looking down on the entire sky island empire.

Even if the leader of the Dragon Palace was not weaker than him, he could not lose face.

Furthermore, there was another powerhouse who was on the same level as him behind him.

He was not afraid of two against one.

Even so, his tone was much weaker when faced with a powerhouse who was likely to be on the same level as him.

“Only those who are courting death will come out and have a conversation with us!”

Wang Xian looked at the king of the Sky Island Empire slowly and revealed a faint smile on his face.

Looking at Wang Xian’s calm and composed appearance, the king of the sky island frowned slightly.

People without strength would definitely not be so calm.

“We can have a conversation anytime. At this moment, the people from the Dragon Palace are not giving face to our Sky Island Empire!”

The king of the Heaven Island stared at Wang Xian coldly.

The two of them were about 500 meters away from each other. Everyone in the surroundings watched the conversation between the two powerhouses. No one dared to speak.

Other than their voices, there was no other noise. Even their breathing was much weaker.

“I wanted to wait, but your son and some people from the Heaven Island Empire are courting death. I can only not give you face!”

Wang Xian looked at him and replied indifferently.

When the king of the Sky Island Empire heard Wang Xian’s contemptuous words, his expression turned uglier and uglier.

“Master of the Dragon Palace, speak your mind!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

He said coldly with a gloomy face.

If not for the powerful strength that Wang Xian had displayed, he would have already made his move!

“Hehe, then I shall speak my mind!”

Wang Xian smiled and took two steps forward slowly. He swept his gaze across the corpses on the ground and then looked at the sea fork demonic beasts on their right.

When the sea fork demonic beasts saw Wang Xian’s gaze, their eyes were filled with fear.

“Half a year ago, My Dragon Palace discovered a deep-sea spiritual spring at the bottom of the sea. After that, you guys found it and forcefully seized 70% of it. I’m here to discuss compensation!”

Wang Xian looked at the king of the Sky Island dynasty and said calmly.

He did not hide anything about the deep-sea spiritual spring.

“Deep-sea spiritual spring?”

When Wang Xian’s voice rang out, a glint flashed across the eyes of the old man from the mainland dynasty who was standing in the middle of the stage.

“No wonder the Sky Island dynasty suddenly took out a huge amount of spiritual stones recently. The entire dynasty’s strength has been greatly enhanced. So it’s the deep-sea spiritual spring!”

He murmured with a burning look in his eyes.

The deep sea spiritual spring was a huge fortune even if it was a small one.

“Compensation? Master of the Dragon Palace, spiritual artifacts and treasures. Those who are powerful will get them. You were weak in the beginning. We can redistribute the benefits in the future!”

The King of the sky island glanced at everyone in the Dragon Palace with a gloomy face.

“Haha, I’m Not Here to discuss compensation for you. I’m here to give you a choice!”

“For the period of four months, you will have to pay 100 billion middle-grade spiritual stones every month. Four months is equivalent to 400 billion middle-grade spiritual stones!”

“Now, with ten times the compensation, the matter of Your Sky Island Empire taking out four trillion middle-grade spiritual stones is considered to be over!”

“Otherwise, there is only one other option!”

Wang Xian stared at them and announced calmly.
