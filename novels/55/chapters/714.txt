Translator: 549690339

“Hello, I’m Sun Lingxiu!”

Sun Lingxiu saw the shocked expressions of the students behind Wang Xian and greeted them with a faint smile.

Sun Lingxiu’s smile was like an angel’s smile, causing everyone behind Wang Xian to be stunned.

“Ah Ah Ah, Hello, sister-in-law!”

Everyone nodded their heads and greeted enthusiastically.

“The girlfriend of little fairy that you guys are talking about should be Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue. I am one too. In fact, there is another one. Perhaps there will be another one soon!”

Sun Lingxiu smiled slyly as she held Wang Xian’s arm.

“This...”

Everyone was completely stunned. They knew that Guan Shuqing was Wang Xian’s girlfriend.

They were not sure if Lan Qingyue was his girlfriend. Now, another one had appeared, and there was even one or two of them.

Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue were the goddesses of Jiang City University. In terms of beauty, they felt that the beauty in front of them was even more beautiful than Lan Qingyue and Guan Shuqing.

Awesome!

In an instant, the way everyone looked at Wang Xian changed. Wang Dahai kept giving him a thumbs up with a face full of exclamations.

“Alright, let’s go, let’s go in!”

Wang Xian rubbed Sun Lingxiu’s hand, causing her face to turn red instantly. She glared at him.

Wang Xian chuckled and let her tease him.

“Welcome!”

As they walked into the shop, the welcoming voices of the guests could be heard. The two guests at the door were obviously new and didn’t know Wang Xian.

“Boss, you... You’re here!”

It was the cashier at the front desk who recognized Wang Xian and said in surprise.

“HMM, where’s manager Huang?”

Wang Xian nodded and asked her.

“I’ll go get manager Huang!”

The cashier immediately walked toward the back office.

Soon, manager Huang walked out. His eyes flickered when he saw Wang Xian. He walked over with a smile and said, “Boss, you’re finally back!”

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded. He had not been in the shop for more than a year and the staff had changed a lot.

“Prepare the largest private room and send some dishes over!”

Wang Xian said to manager Huang directly.

“Boss, the largest private room has been reserved!”

Manager Huang was slightly stunned when he heard Wang Xian’s words. He said with a frown.

“Tell them about it. If it doesn’t work, give them some discounts. Dahai, bring them in first. You know the largest private room!”

Wang Xian patted Wang Dahai’s shoulder.

“Alright!”

Wang Dahai nodded and waved to the students behind him with a smile. Then, he walked upstairs.

“Boss, I’m afraid it won’t work!”

At this moment, manager Huang suddenly said.

“HMM?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and looked at manager Huang.

“Boss, the people who booked the seats today are from the puppet immortal sect!”

Manager Huang frowned and said.

“No matter who the other party is, find an excuse and tell the kitchen to prepare some dishes as soon as possible!”

Wang Xian said directly to manager Huang. Then, he brought Sun Lingxiu upstairs.

Manager Huang opened his mouth and revealed an embarrassed expression. He walked into the office with a gloomy face. No one knew what he was thinking about.

“Xiao Xian, manager Huang’s expression has changed!”

At this moment, Sun Lingxiu suddenly said to Wang Xian.

“Yes, it has changed!”

Sun Lingxiu was a light attribute cultivator. She could see many things from a person’s eyes.

With Wang Xian’s strength, he also noticed some changes in manager Huang. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“However, manager Huang has followed me for more than two years. As long as there are no mistakes in principle, he will be in charge of this restaurant!”

“Okay!”

The two of them walked into the private room and sat at the dining table. They started chatting with their classmates.

They talked about the interesting things that had happened in the past year and the disciples of the Mingwang Celestial sect.

When the dishes were served, everyone was very happy.

Bang Bang

“Boss!”

At around eight o’clock, manager Huang knocked on the door and walked in.

“What’s the matter?”

Wang Xian looked at manager Huang and asked.

“Boss, the disciples of the celestial puppet sect are here. There are more of them and they insisted on having this private room!”

Manager Huang frowned and said to Wang Xian.

“Didn’t you explain it to them?”

Wang Xian frowned and the smile on his face disappeared.

“Manager Huang, have I made my decision? Tell your boss to hurry up!”

At this moment, an impatient voice came from outside. The door was pushed open and two young men in ancient costumes stood at the door. There was a hint of impatience on their faces.

“Alright, Alright. Master Ping, please wait for a moment. I’ll make it available for you immediately!”

Manager Huang hurriedly said to the young man outside in a flattering manner. He turned his head to look at Wang Xian and said, “Boss, they are from the immortal sect...”

“I will get someone to check the accounts of the time I left for more than a year. If there are no problems, I will give you a few hundred thousand. If there are any problems...”

Wang Xian interrupted manager Huang and looked at him coldly. “Now, you are no longer the manager here. Get Out!”

“Boss!”

Manager Huang’s expression changed drastically when he heard Wang Xian’s words. His expression changed drastically as he turned to look at the young man outside.

When Wang Xian saw that manager Huang was actually asking for help from the young man at the door, his eyes turned even colder.

“I say, you are the boss of this restaurant, right?”

The two young men raised their eyebrows slightly when they heard what was said. They stared at Wang Xian as he walked in.

“Speak!”

Wang Xian looked at them and said coldly.

“We are the disciples of the celestial puppet sect!”

As the two of them spoke, they raised their heads slightly and revealed a superior expression.

“Boss, they are from the immortal sect. We...”

Manager Huang squeezed out a smile from the side. It was obvious that the world had changed in his opinion. Currently, the world belonged to the immortal sect.

The reason why he dared to disobey Wang Xian was because he had a good relationship with the disciples of the puppet immortal sect.

He didn’t know that Wang Xian was the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate. In fact, none of the first-grade pavilion’s employees knew about it.

They only knew that the boss had great influence in Jiang City. However, that was in the past. Things were different now.

Now, the Mingwang Immortal sect and the puppet immortal sect were the kings of Jiang City!

“This is my restaurant!”

Wang Xian said to them coldly.

“Haha, interesting, interesting!”

When the two young men heard Wang Xian’s words, they didn’t get angry. Instead, they smiled and walked towards Wang Xian.

“Do you know whose territory this is?”

A young man dressed in ancient costume smiled and stared at Wang Xian mockingly.

It was the same sentence again. Whose territory is this?

Whose territory is the current Jiang City?

This was the second time Wang Xian heard this sentence from a disciple of the celestial sect.

It seemed that he, the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate, had been away from this place for too long.

“This is not your territory. Get Out!”

Wang Xian looked at the two young men and said expressionlessly.

“Kid, you’re acting too big. How dare you chase us out!”

The two young men stared at Wang Xian coldly. “Today, get out of this private room immediately and prepare some dishes for us to serve!”

“That’s right!”

As they spoke, the corners of their lips curled up slightly. “Let the few beauties in the room serve the dishes for us!”
