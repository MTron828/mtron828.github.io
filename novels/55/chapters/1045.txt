Translator: 5496903

They could sense the various defensive weapons on the princess once they activated them.

It was also because the princess had so many defensive weapons on her that they were at ease to let Huo Yuan and the others bring the princess out while they dealt with some matters.

However, what they didn’t expect was that the weapon on the princess was actually activated.

Once it was triggered, it meant that someone was attacking their princess.

Who Was it that wanted to die and dared to attack the little princess of the Fire Lark Clan?

The four extraordinary level 9 powerhouses instantly released all their strength and flew towards a room on the second floor of the restaurant.

In fact, many people didn’t even see their figures.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

“Miss!”

“Miss, Are You Alright?”

Four figures instantly appeared around the Little Loli under Wang Xian’s grave and Zhang Fengying’s shocked gaze.

The four of them looked at the Little Loli and asked with concern.

“I... I’m fine. Look at the few Sisters and the elder brother!”

The Little Loli heaved a heavy sigh of relief when she saw her men and said hurriedly.

A woman waved her arm and the four of them stood up immediately. They immediately regained consciousness.

“Master!”

“Mother!”

The four young men were in a daze. When they saw their elders, they quickly shouted.

The young man from the source of fire had a change of expression when he saw that the little princess had activated her weapon’s defense. Following that, he extended his hand in anger.

He pointed his finger at Wang Xian and said with a slightly ferocious expression, “Master, the few aunties were the ones who attacked the young lady!”

The three women and a middle-aged man were extremely cold. They looked at Wang Xian with murderous intent.

At the same time, the old woman and the two middle-aged men who were following behind the empress suddenly frowned slightly.

“Empress, there’s a problem with the little girl!”

The old woman said softly to Feng Luan.

“Oh? What’s Wrong?”

Feng Luan turned her head slightly.

“The defensive weapon on her body has been activated!”

The old woman said directly.

“Let’s go over!”

Feng Luan said directly.

After coming to the extraordinary continent and returning to the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan, the thousands of people of the entire clan were all respectful to her.

Even the fire cloud clan’s grand supreme bowed respectfully when he saw her.

Only that little girl, who was pure and innocent, was not afraid of her and could chat with her.

Feng Luan liked that little girl very much.

“Yes, Empress!”

The old woman nodded, picked up the red cane in her hand, and gently moved it.

The group of four instantly disappeared.

That’s right, they disappeared in an instant, as if they had teleported.

This instant disappearance was dozens of times stronger than Ao Yao’s Light and Shadow escape.

“Master, Aunt, kill him, kill him. He actually dared to attack the princess. This is an unpardonable crime!”

In the room of the small restaurant, the ferocious voice of Huo Yuan rang out.

The eyes of the four middle-aged men were filled with killing intent. The two people in front of them had already been sentenced to death for daring to harm their little princess of the fire Lark clan!

At this moment, the surrounding space seemed to tremble. Four figures appeared out of thin air in the room

The four middle-aged men were slightly shocked and quickly bent down to carry their luggage.

Wang Xian, who was already in an awkward state, could not help but narrow his eyes when he saw the four people who suddenly appeared in the room like ghosts and gods.

Zhang Fengying, who was standing at the side, saw their faces turn pale instantly. She grabbed Wang Xian’s arm nervously.

In an instant, Wang Xian felt a soft sensation on his arm. However, before he could feel it, he was stunned.

He looked at the Veiled Lady with a twinkle in his eyes.

At this moment, Feng Luan was also looking at Wang Xian with a little astonishment. Her eyes were also twinkling.

“It’s over, it’s over. We’ve offended an expert!”

Zhang Fengying’s trembling voice rang out. She shook Wang Xian’s arm and was completely flustered.

The four of them appeared out of thin air. He couldn’t even sense how they appeared.

Coupled with the hole-in-the-void grade defensive weapon on the Little Loli, she knew that they were in big trouble this time.

They had provoked an extremely terrifying force.

This force had the power to easily wipe them out. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“This matter is my fault. If you guys want to take revenge, you can just look for me!”

Zhang Fengying’s face was pale as she released Wang Xian’s arm. She clenched her fists tightly and took a step forward resolutely.

“This young lady is quite courageous and loyal!”

Wang Xian looked at Zhang Fengying’s actions and revealed a smile.

“Sister Feng, they want to hit me. They are bad people!”

The Little Loli immediately ran to the side of the Veiled Lady and pouted her lips as she spoke with some grievance.

Feng Luan revealed a smile on her face. Her smile was like a flower as she gently stroked the little girl’s head.

Huo Yuan, who was at the side, saw that the great empress and the rest had arrived. His eyes were filled with excitement. He looked at Wang Xian with excitement.

Haha, Kid, You’re going to die now. You’re going to die.

You actually made me so embarrassed and left a bad impression on my master and the rest...

You deserve to die... deserve to die...

His face slowly turned a little ferocious with excitement.

Wang Xian saw Feng Luan’s face full of smiles. Even though the veil completely covered her face.

However, he could still recognize her at a glance from her eyes.

One had to know that there was a period of time when Feng Luan and Shu Qing were in the same body. When Wang Xian saw the change in their eyes, he knew who was controlling the body.

Therefore, he would never forget the look in Feng Luan’s eyes.

Wang Xian walked towards Feng Luan with a smile on his face.

“Huh?”

The four middle-aged men were stunned. Even the two middle-aged elders beside Feng Luan had a slight change in their expressions.

The two middle-aged elders moved their fingers slightly. However, at this moment, the old woman beside them took a glance at them.

The two of them were astonished and did not move.

“HMPH!”

Wang Xian walked to Feng Luan. The Little Loli beside him glared at Wang Xian and snorted while pouting her lips.

“This way of meeting is a little special!”

Wang Xian looked at Feng Luan and raised his hand with a smile. “You are wearing a veil and bringing so many people. Are you trying to show me off?”

“This is not a way for friends to meet!”

As he spoke, under the shocked gazes of everyone around, Wang Xian pulled the veil off her face.

An exquisite and noble face was revealed. She looked at Wang Xian with a smile in her eyes.

“What a coincidence. She’s neither fat nor thin. She’s still as beautiful as ever!”

Wang Xian pulled down his veil and joked while feigning surprise.

However, when they heard Wang Xian’s words and saw him pulling down their Empress’s veil, everyone trembled.

The eyes of the old woman beside her flickered. Her eyes were filled with shock.

The two middle-aged elders widened their eyes and opened their mouths slightly.

As for the four middle-aged men and the four young men, they felt as though their eyes were blind. Their faces were filled with disbelief.

Even the Little Loli widened her eyes and opened her mouth.

Their empress, how was this possible!
