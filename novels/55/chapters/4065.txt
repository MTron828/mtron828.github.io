Translator: 549690339

“Everyone, you should all be in contact with the Dragon Palace. Please contact the Dragon Palace and tell the Heavenly Yuan creator to send them over! ”

The order of the Emperor of Phoenix and the Emperor of Angel caused the eyes of all the powerful disciples of the Phoenix clan and the Angel clan to shine.

The Fire Phoenix King looked at the experts of the peak races and said.

He knew that the peak races had connections with the Dragon Palace.

He knew that they could contact the Dragon Palace.

Okay!

The experts of the other peak races frowned slightly, but they agreed.

Now, the experts of the Heavenly Yuan Creation Realm issued an order!

Unless the other Heavenly Yuan creation realm experts objected, they couldn’t refuse!

Soon after, news spread to the Dragon Palace one by one!

At the same time, Prime Minister Gui quickly received a message from the disciples of the top races in the Dragon Palace.

Besides, there were also some messages from the disciples of the top races that the Dragon Palace had secretly trained.

When he saw this message, he narrowed his eyes slightly!

The message sent by the peak races was very simple. It was a major event in the nine-origin universe. The Heavenly Yuan creation realm expert had asked the Dragon Palace to come to the sacred literature field.

Some of the disciples who had good relationships with the Dragon Palace sent an additional message. It was not a good thing.

They did not dare to send all the information to the Dragon Palace, but they did give some reminders.

However, the subordinates that the Dragon Palace had secretly trained sent all the information.

Two of the Heavenly Yuan creator realm’s subordinates said that they would punish the Dragon Palace!

The Angel clan and the Phoenix clan also knew that the Dragon Palace would receive all the information.

However, they didn’t care too much about it!

The Heavenly Yuan creator realm’s decision wasn’t something that a small dragon palace could resist!

If the Dragon Palace really hid this time…

What awaited the Dragon Palace in the future would be complete destruction.

They would still have a chance to survive this time.

If they didn’t come, their chances of survival would be completely gone!

The Angel clan and the Phoenix clan had never paid too much attention to the Dragon Palace.

From the beginning to the end, they didn’t engage in a direct battle with the Dragon Palace.

It wasn’t that they didn’t want to, but the Dragon Palace didn’t dare. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Just like now, the Dragon Palace had gone into hiding and didn’t dare to appear in the open of the nine-origin universe.

“Let’s continue what we’re about to do! ”

“This time, we’ve gathered all the disciples above the knight level in the 9-origin universe. It’s a great opportunity. The catastrophe will arrive in two billion years. At that time, a great war between universes will break out. ”

“You should have some understanding of the catastrophe these days. The catastrophe war has started, and we have our own enemies. Before this catastrophe, our 9-origin universe was quite lucky. A Tree of chaos appeared in the chaos next to our universe! ”

“The surroundings of the tree of chaos are like an extremely powerful blessed land. You can quickly increase your strength in there. In the next two billion years, it won’t be a problem for our nine-origin universe to double its strength! ”

At this moment, Hetian saint continued speaking to all the disciples.

After saying this, all the experts above the venerable realm were shocked.

The Tree of Primal Chaos?

The powerful grotto-heaven paradise?

It could double their strength in the 9-origin universe!

Didn’t this mean that their strength could also increase a lot?

This made them look excited!

As for the Apocalypse.

When the starry universe was opened, all the beings in the 9-origin universe knew about the existence of the apocalypse.

They also knew about the specific situation of the amount.

At the same time, this news also reached the Dragon Palace!

The Dragon Palace was located in a very remote place in the nine-origin universe!

There were few people here and it was a dead zone.

The surrounding energy was also very thin!

Beside it was a lifeless chaotic space.

In the Dragon King Palace, Wang Xian’s figure slowly appeared.

Standing beside him, Lin Niu looked around curiously.

In the treasure vault of the Divine Dragon Clan, Lin Niu had refined the heaven origin jade horn and completely eliminated the suppression from the nine-origin universe!

“Dragon King! ”

The moment Wang Xian arrived, Prime Minister Gui flew over quickly.

Upon returning to the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian revealed a smile. He was in a very good mood!

“Dragon King, something has happened. ”

At this moment, Prime Minister Gui spoke to Wang Xian.

His words stunned Wang Xian. He looked at him and asked, “What happened?”

“Dragon King, this is a message from a group of peak races. Furthermore, this is the information obtained from some spies in the Dragon Palace. ”

As Prime Minister Gui spoke, he handed a document to Wang Xian. “Dragon King, it’s fortunate that you are back this time. Otherwise, I wouldn’t know what to do. ”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and took the document.

When he saw the contents, his eyes sparkled.

“The emperor of the Phoenix and the Emperor of the Angels, the destiny of the heaven. Do you want the Dragon Palace to pay the price?” Wang Xian mumbled as he looked at the document.

When he saw the last piece of information, his eyes lit up.

The Tree of Chaos?

The Grotto-heaven Paradise?

“Prime Minister Gui, how many disciples are there in the realm of the ruler of the Dragon Palace?”

Wang Xian asked Prime Minister Gui.

Hundreds of millions of years had passed.

This period of time was a period of rapid improvement for the Dragon Palace.

There were resources obtained from the starry universe.

There was a large amount of faith in the Dragon Palace.

However, Wang Xian did not know exactly how many Tianyuan fortunes the Dragon Palace had.

“Dragon King, after hundreds of millions of years of development, our Dragon Palace currently has around 300,000 overlord realm disciples. Among them, the Blue Dragon Queen, who has the highest realm, has now reached the level nine Overlord Realm! ”

“Currently, our Dragon Palace does not have any experts at the peak of the Overlord realm. The remaining 33 strongest overlord realm level eight succubus dragon species! ”

“Overall, the rest of the disciples of the Dragon Palace are all below level three of the ruler of the Universe!”

Prime Minister GUI reported.

Currently, there were many masters at the ruler realm in the Dragon Palace.

However, their realms were not very high.

There was still a gap between them and the other peak races!

After breaking through to the ruler of the universe realm, the improvement in realms would be much slower!

“Not bad!”

Wang Xian was very satisfied with the current strength of the Dragon Palace! “Get all the strong disciples to prepare for the holy literature field. Since all the disciples from the other peak races have gone, our dragon palace can not fall behind. Hehe. ”

“Let them experience the current strength of our Dragon Palace! ” As Wang Xian spoke, his eyes sparkled.

“From now on, Our Dragon Palace will stand upright in the nine-origin universe.. Anyone who dares to provoke US will have to pay a heavy price! “
