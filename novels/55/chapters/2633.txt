“It’s Master!”

In the abyss, bei Shuang heard Wang Xian’s words. Without any hesitation, she stopped stopping the three level 8 undying God King Abyss seeds!

“What is the Dragon King trying to do?”

When bei Chuan Leader and the rest heard Wang Xian’s words, they were slightly shocked!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

Without bei Shuang and the rest stopping them, the three level 8 undying god King Abyss seeds let out an angry roar. Their bloodthirsty eyes stared at Dragon Peak, bringing with them monstrous flames as they pounced towards Dragon Peak!

“Gulp Gulp Gulp!”

One of the undying level 8 abyss species opened its mouth, its stomach suddenly expanding!

“Rumble!”

A terrifying dark torrent rushed towards Dragon Mountain!

The terrifying attacks made the Beichuan sect leader and the others turn their heads!

Seven undying level 8 abyss species, they were now defending against four, the pressure was much less!

The Dragon Palace had intentionally let three of them come over, could they kill them?

Three undying level 8 abyssal seeds, even they would find it hard to kill them!

“Ao Yao, Mu Ze Sen, get ready, kill these three level 8 abyssal seeds!”

Sky array saw the abyssal seeds heading towards Dragon Mountain, his eyes revealing a cold expression!

“Alright!”

At the lower position, Mou Zesen pulled the bowstring to its maximum and a hurricane arrow flew towards the dark torrent!

The terrifying collision force caused the torrent and the arrow to dissipate immediately!

“Let’s attack together!”

Wang Xian stared at the three immortal king level eight abyssal seeds. His body moved and he flew out directly!

His gaze was locked onto an abyssal seed!

“Dragon Claw!”

Wang Xian stretched out his arm and attacked the level eight immortal King Abyss seed!

“Roar!”

The abyss seed growled and stretched out its dragon claw. Black Flames condensed on it as it charged towards the Dragon Claw!

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

A series of collision sounds rang out!

“Have a taste of the power of the Dragon Peak Array!”

The sky array stood on the command platform and waved the array compass with both hands!

“Hualala!”

The sound of branches came from the Dragon Peak. The entire thorny branches rapidly extended forward! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The countless branches gathered together and formed a terrifying monster!

An incomparably huge monster attacked an abyss seed!

Wang Xian locked onto one, Mou Zesen locked onto one, and the array of the Dragon Peak locked onto one!

In an instant, the three immortal king level eight abyss species were suppressed!

On Dragon Peak, the Heaven’s eye arrow, Starwood Dragon species, strange demon, and the rest were frenziedly hunting the surrounding abyss species!

“Sou Sou Sou!”

“Peng Peng Peng!”

“AO AO!”

Right in the middle of dragon peak, countless thorny monsters were formed. Thick thorny vines landed on their bodies, instantly causing them to let out miserable cries!

An instant attack, an instant suppression!

The brambles formed from Dragon Peak’s array formation could easily suppress a tier 8 abyssal seed!

“Roar Roar!”

The tier 8 abyssal seed was covered in blood, causing it to become even more berserk. Endless green blades slashed towards the brambles!

“Sou Sou Sou!”

At this time, two more oddly shaped brambles flew out from the back of Dragon Peak. Numerous law brambles directly sealed off the void behind!

“Roar!”

The tier 8 abyssal seed was slightly shocked. It let out a low roar with some fear and slightly bent its body!

“WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH!”

Following that, one after another, attacks were launched towards the tier 8 abyssal seed!

One after another, attacks came down, causing deep wounds to appear on its body!

That tier 8 abyssal seed revealed a panicked and terrified expression!

...

It was completely unable to resist!

There was no room for resistance!

At this moment, the sky formation could be said to be the strongest formation of Dragon Peak!

The formation he set up could destroy two to three level 8 undying godly king existences!

It was to destroy, not to fight!

With the power of the formation activated, an undying godly king abyssal seed was completely unable to resist!

“Dragon Claw!”

In front of him, Wang Xian was fighting against a level 8 abyssal seed. His dragon claw kept on waving, clashing with it time and time again!

The strength of the Divine Dragon race lay in their physical bodies and their origin laws!

Wang Xian covered his dragon claws with the laws, waving his dragon claws that were over 10,000 meters in size!

A human controlling a 10,000-meter long dragon claw. From Afar, this scene was a little strange and even comical!

...

However, fighting against a level 8 abyssal seed, everyone would be trembling!

“That Dragon King is also an undying god King Level 8 existence!”

The Beichuan Clan Warriors looked at the Dragon Palace Dragon King, bei Shuang’s teacher fighting against an undying level 8 abyssal seed alone, their faces filled with shock!

That Dragon King wasn’t Level 7, but had the same strength as their sect’s top warriors!

“Shuang ‘ER’s attack methods are similar to that Dragon King, looks like it must have been taught by the Dragon King!”

The leader of the Bei Chuan sect and the few patriarchs looked over. Their eyes were shining brightly!

They looked at bei Shuang and attacked with their terrifying frost claws as well!

This attack seemed unusually powerful and violent!

Boom! Boom! Boom

The terrifying sounds of collision rang out continuously in the abyss. The arrival of Wang Xian and the rest had greatly reduced the pressure on the entire bei Chuan sect!

The number of abyss seeds was being killed at a terrifying speed!

There were 5,000 immortal king level powerhouses in the Dragon Palace and quite a number of level 7 powerhouses. It was a complete massacre of the surrounding abyss seeds!

“AO AO!”

After fighting for three minutes, a scream suddenly came from within the area covered by thorns!

“This is?”

“The level 8 abyss seed was killed?”

Upon hearing this voice, the eyes of the Beichuan sect leader and the rest lit up. They immediately looked towards the area covered by thorns!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

At this moment, countless of monsters that were formed from thorns and entangled were attacking the abyssal seed in front of Wang Xian!

“What a fast speed!”

Wang Xian smiled when he saw that one of them had been killed by the Heaven Formation!

At the same time, his dragon claws attacked crazily!

When the abyssal seed saw the Thorn Monster that was attacking it, its expression changed drastically!

It hurriedly tried to defend itself!

“PFFT!”

The dragon claws attacked and the thorns attacked one after another!

Just as it was trying its best to defend itself, a strange black and white shadow appeared behind it!

The black and white shadow instantly penetrated its body!

“Roar!”

It widened its eyes and let out a low roar. Its body was trembling!

“Surround and kill the third one!”

When Wang Xian saw that the abyssal seed was being attacked, his gaze immediately locked onto the level eight abyssal seed that was being attacked by Mou Zesen!

“Roar!”

When the level eight abyssal seed saw the monster formed by Wang Xian and the brambles that were attacking it, as well as the strange black and White Shadow, it revealed a terrified expression on its face!

“Don’t let it escape!”

When Wang Xian saw that it wanted to escape, he immediately roared loudly!

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

The brambles and arrows immediately sealed its position!

“Boom!”

Wang Xian’s dragon claws clawed at it!

“Roar!”

It roared furiously in shock. Under the siege, it could only defend against the attacks with all its strength!

“PFFT!”

The Ao Yao’s figure flashed past its surroundings, leaving a heavy wound on its body!

Wang Xian and Mou Zesen’s attacks had arrived once again!
