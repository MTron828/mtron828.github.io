“Sou Sou Sou!”

On the planet where some of the warriors of the 6 alliances were, close to 600 undyings charged into the sky!

“Rumble!”

“Dragon Palace? I wonder if there are any undying level 7 warriors coming over for a fight, otherwise, I’ll be disappointed!”

Suddenly, an old man flew over, his gaze staring straight ahead, his eyes filled with aggressiveness and killing intent!

A month ago, when they had attacked the Dragon Palace, the other party had been hiding behind the array formation, not daring to come out!

Today, they had never expected that the other party would dare to counterattack!

If the other party had sent an undying King Level 7 warrior, it would be fine. Of course, if the Dragon Palace sent him, he would not be afraid. Even if two of them came, he would be able to deal with them!

If there was no undying King Level 7 warrior, it would be a joke!

“Eh? I didn’t expect the Ninth Grade Sky Sect’s undying King Level 7 warrior to be here. What a pleasant surprise, hehehe!”

In the distant darkness, ao Fenghuang, the current leader of the imperial dragon species, the Saturn Turtle Ao tu, and Ba Qi slowly walked out!

Ba Qi looked at the Ninth Grade Sky Sect’s undying King Level 7 warrior and let out an ear piercing laugh!

The three of them slowly walked out from the darkness of the Void, followed by a group of experts from the Dragon Palace!

There were not many of them, 200 of them, including 10 level 6 and 40 Level 5 undying godly monarchs!

“Oh?”

The ancestor from the ninth-grade sky sect frowned slightly when he saw Ba Qi and the others walking over from the void, carefully sensing the strength of the three of them!

“Keke Keke, one level 7 undying godly monarch expert and 500 undying godly monarchs, three minutes, I wonder if we can finish them all?”

Ba Qi stared at the Patriarch of the ninth-grade sky sect, his face revealing a bewitching smile as he laughed loudly!

“Leave it to me alone, I should be able to finish them in five minutes!”

Beside him, ao Fenghuang said coldly!

“Keke, after evolving into the Heavenly Thunder, Earth, fire, Dragon, and Phoenix Seed, your confidence is indeed different!”

Ba Qi looked at him and said with a smile!

“The three of you should work together and finish him off as soon as possible!”

Ao Tu said indifferently from the side. He stretched out his arm and a shield with a divine dragon coiled on it appeared in his hand!

“Boom Boom Boom!”

At this moment, his body trembled slightly. The ground in a radius of more than 100 million kilometers directly sank by a kilometer!

“Hiss!”

At this scene, all the experts from the six major factions narrowed their eyes as shock appeared on their faces!

“Acting tough!”

“Hehehe, the six major factions, today is the day of your destruction!”

Ba Qi laughed maniacally as he charged forward!

“Oh no, there are three level 7 undying godly monarch experts!”

Sensing Ba Qi’s might, the undying godly monarch Patriarch from the ninth grade sky sect confirmed their strength and his expression changed drastically!

They could basically confirm the strength of the Dragon Palace. At most, there were three undying godly monarchs!

With the array grandmaster guarding the Dragon Star, there were at most two of them. If there were two of them, he could fight them and even hold them off!

However, the other party had three undying godly monarch level 7 warriors!

This...

The Dragon King, along with the Tiger Chaos Demon Country’s imperial preceptor, the array grandmaster, and the three in front of them, how many undying godly monarch level 7 warriors did the Dragon Palace have?

This strength was enough to fight them a month ago!

“Hiss, behind them, there are about 10 undying level 6 warriors, and even more level 5. Not Good, how can they have so many warriors? We are not their match!”

At this time, the Warriors from the Sky Mountain Sword sect felt the strength of the Warriors from the Dragon Palace, their faces filled with shock!

“Why did so many experts suddenly appear from the Dragon Palace?”

“Break through, break through this strange space!”

The ninth grade celestial sect’s patriarch roared with a gloomy face!

“Hehehe, don’t even think about breaking through!”

Ba Qi laughed maniacally, and the poisonous fog that filled the sky covered the area below!

“Damn it!”

When the ninth grade celestial sect’s patriarch saw this terrifying poisonous fog, his expression changed. A lightning disc appeared in his hand, and countless bolts of lightning rushed into the poisonous fog!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

At this time, ao Fenghuang’s body moved and transformed into battle form as she charged towards the ninth grade sky sect patriarch!

Ao Tu did the same. He transformed into an incomparably huge imperial dragon seed and charged out with a terrifying force!

“This... how can their strength... and even I can’t sense the undying God country’s existence. If we fight for a long time, I might die here!”

The ninth grade Sky sect Patriarch’s heart sank, his expression extremely ugly!

... UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Kill!”

At this time, Ba Qi, ao Fenghuang and Ao Tu had already charged over!

Behind them, the rest of the Dragon Palace warriors charged straight into the three seas sect leader, demon slaying sect leader and the rest!

Here, there were only seven undying god King Level 6 warriors, they were no match for the Dragon Palace!

Not to mention, the enemy had even more undying level 5 warriors!

Dragon Palace? How could they have such power?

They were all shocked, their expressions extremely ugly as they looked around!

They couldn’t fight, they could only flee!

However very quickly, the warriors of the Dragon Palace surrounded them!

“6 powers, Hehe, prepare to die!”

A terrifying battle erupted!

...

“Kill a way out!”

The Warriors from the six powers saw this scene and their faces turned pale, gritting their teeth as they roared!

“Hehe, there are quite a number of undying level 6 warriors, I’ll take care of a few!”

“Rumble!”

However suddenly, in the air above, the eight Qi squinted his eyes at the three undying level 6 warriors, waving his arm!

Numerous law demon claws attacked the 3 undying level 6 warriors!

“Not good!”

“Despicable, an undying level 7 warrior attacked us!”

The expressions of the 3 undying level 7 warriors changed, they roared in shock and anger!

They thought that the 3 undying level 7 warriors would attack the 9th Rank Sky Ancestor First!

However, they did not expect the other party to be so despicable as to attack them in an instant!

“Stop! Even if you have three level 7 immortal king experts, don’t think you can ignore me!”

The ninth-grade celestial sect patriarch roared angrily as he waved his thunder disc. Bolts of lightning struck towards Ba Qi!

“Ao tu, help me block them!”

Ba Qi said casually!

“Boom Boom Boom!”

Ao Tu looked at him unhappily. With a wave of his arm, terrifying shields rose up. The Lightning did not even destroy the shields!

The imperial dragon seed could not even break through their defenses!

If Ao Yao wanted to assassinate Ao Tu, it was 100% impossible!

Of course, Ao tu could not do anything to Ao Yao, Ao Qitian and the rest!

“Keke Keke, not bad, not bad!”

Ba Qi smiled and waved his hand again, continuing to attack the level 6 undying fighters below!

“Hiss, it’s over... the patriarch can’t hold off the three level 7 undying fighters!”

A Level 9 sky sect fighter looked up, his face filled with despair!

How could they defend against A Level 7 undying fighter who wanted to kill them?
