Chapter 1423: 1423. Whoever I say is the chosen one will be the next

He flicked his finger!

It was still an ordinary flick of his finger!

Just now, with a flick of Wang Xian’s finger, Helian Hu, who was ranked 17th on the prodigy roll, was sent flying. He spat out a mouthful of blood.

Meng Wenbing, who was ranked 7th on the prodigy roll, was sent flying. He spat out a mouthful of blood.

Even an expert from the blood stream sect, who was at the third level of the Seethrough Void Tier, was sent flying and spat out a mouthful of blood.

Now, he flicked his finger again!

However, the target this time was the white-haired elder.

Everyone knew clearly about the strength of the white-haired elder. He was a top expert at level five of the Seethrough.

This..

When everyone saw that Wang Xian was actually attacking the white-haired elder with the same attack, they were all in a daze.

Wasn’t this a little too arrogant?

“Huh?”

When the white-haired old man from the blood stream sect saw that Wang Xian was attacking him with his fingers, his expression changed slightly.

His expression turned gloomy instantly as a hint of anger flashed in his eyes.

“Nameless Sword Demon, you are too arrogant!”

He said with a cold expression as he stared at the fist-sized grey energy that was attacking him.

“Buzz!”

His arm moved and a white skull appeared in his hand.

The white-haired old man moved his arm and a skull shadow directly charged towards the grey energy.

The skull looked like it came from hell and was filled with Gloom and terror!

It was lifelike and extremely strange!

“This nameless sword demon is simply too arrogant. Even if you are as monstrous as a demon, it’s completely impossible for you to defeat our grand elder with just a flick of your finger!”

“Arrogant! Do you really think that you can wipe out the world with just one move? Our Grand Elder is on the same level as you!”

The two middle-aged men from the blood stream sect watched as the grand elder took out his artifact and spoke with an ugly expression on their faces.

“Boom!”

The shadow of the dark black skeleton collided with the gray ball, resulting in a terrifying collision.

“Roar Roar!”

Suddenly, a terrifying roar came from within the dark skull.

“Weng!”

Just when everyone thought that something unexpected had happened, the roaring skull actually slowly dissipated.

The gray ball continued to attack the white-haired old man.

“What?”

The white-haired old man’s expression changed drastically, and the pale white skull in his hands was directly aimed in front of him.

“Ghost Devour!”

He let out a low roar, and a ten-meter-large ghost instantly appeared on the pale white skull.

The ghost emitted a ghastly and terrifying aura, causing everyone within a few kilometers to instantly feel their scalps go numb.

“Jie Jie!”

The ghost let out a strange cry and tore towards the gray ball.

“Weng!”

“Jie Jie Jie Jie!”

The ghost’s sharp claws landed on the gray ball, emitting a ghastly sound.

“This is impossible!”

However, under the incredulous gazes of the two middle-aged men from the blood stream sect, the ghost slowly dissipated.

The white-haired old man’s gaze also focused. His pupils constricted slightly, and his eyes were filled with shock.

The ghost quickly disappeared. He stretched out his hands and grabbed the pale white skeleton!

“Door of Darkness!”

A door of darkness filled with runes appeared in front of him.

“Bang!”

The gray ball landed on the door of darkness, emitting a terrifying collision sound.

The collision in an instant actually almost caused the door of darkness to crack open.

The white-haired old man’s body shook, and dark energy surged towards the door of darkness!

He stared at the gray ball in front of him, and his heart was extremely shaken.

The terrifying power caused his body to fly backwards.

After flying backward for a hundred meters, the gray ball dissipated.

The white-haired old man raised the door of darkness in his hand with an embarrassed expression.

“Hiss!”

The sound of gasps reverberated throughout the entire area. Everyone watched this scene in a daze.

With a flick of his finger, the powerful fifth-level insightful void martial artist was only able to block it with three moves.

Furthermore, under Wang Xian’s casual attack, his body was forced back by more than a hundred meters.

Although he wasn’t injured, the huge gap left everyone in shock.

It was so terrifying!

“Do you have any objections?”

Wang Xian continued to stare at the white-haired old man with a calm expression and asked.

Whoever I say is a heaven’s favorite is a heaven’s favorite. Do you have any objections?

The incomparably domineering aura caused the white-haired old man’s expression to change drastically.

“He is definitely not an ordinary fifth level void interpretation. In fact, he has already reached it...”

The white-haired elder looked at the indifferent Wang Xian and his heart trembled.

If this person in front of him had really reached that level, then the blood stream sect coming to the dragon and Phoenix Empire to snatch him away was simply courting death!

“Phew!”

The white-haired elder took a deep breath.

“Among the younger generation in the world, the only Peerless Heaven’s favorite is the nameless sword demon!”

“If you say that there are prodigies in this world, then there are prodigies in this world. If you say that there are no prodigies in this world, then there are no prodigies in this world!”

As he spoke, he slowly cupped his fists and bowed slightly!

Respect!

“Boom!”

The entire audience of more than 100,000 was in an uproar.

“Oh my God, the white-haired elder from the blood stream sect actually said such a thing!”

“If you say that there are heaven’s favorites in the world, then there are heaven’s favorites in the world. If you say that there are no heaven’s favorites in the world, then there are no heaven’s favorites in the world. This evaluation... I’m going to kneel down and speak!”

“Gulp, is this our dragon-phoenix Dynasty’s Lord Wang? This is simply heaven-defying. All Heaven’s favorites are decided by Lord Wang?”

One by one, the citizens stood up with their faces flushed red, their bodies slightly trembling!

How Strong was this Lord Wang to be able to make a powerhouse at level five of the Seethrough realm say such words!

The four people from the blood stream sect were also looking at their grand elder in shock.

They were very clear about the temper of the Grand Elder. Now, he actually said such words to a young man.

This was no longer as simple as facing a powerhouse of the same level.

Could it be..

The eyes of the four of them sparkled, and their breathing was a little hurried.

This was especially so for Meng Wenbing. His burning eyes were staring at Wang Xian with even more admiration.

This tall mountain was even taller and bigger!

“Is this our dragon and Phoenix Empire’s Lord Wang? The supreme prodigy. Whoever he says is a prodigy will be a prodigy!”

The ten young men from Daybreak Moon looked at Wang Xian who was floating in the sky from the arena. Their faces were filled with yearning.

This was a true heaven’s pride expert! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He was able to make experts from powerful sects bow down to him!

“The Dragon and Phoenix Empire’s Heaven’s pride expert competition has Lord Wang overseeing it. This is a true heaven’s pride expert competition!”

Feng Luan also looked at Wang Xian with slight astonishment.

She didn’t expect that Wang Xian would actually make a name for himself as a Supreme Heaven’s pride expert and so on.

“With Lord Wang around, the Heaven’s pride expert competition is the Heaven’s pride expert competition. Disciples of Our Flaming Sun Continent Region, don’t lose face for the Flaming Sun Continent Region!”

The city Lord of Flaming Sun City roared in a low voice, his eyes burning with passion.

“Yes, we will definitely give it our all in the Prodigy tournament!”

The ten people of Daybreak Moon City bowed and roared loudly. Their eyes were filled with fighting spirit!

They looked at Wang Xian in awe, their eyes filled with determination.

They wanted Lord Wang’s approval!

At this moment, Daybreak Moon realized that she was like an ant.

Fortunately, Lord Wang did not haggle with him!

He also wanted to be recognized by Lord Wang’s proud son of heaven..
