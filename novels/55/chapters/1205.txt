Chapter 1206: 1207, I, the sword king

Translator: 5496903

“Good, what terrifying strength!”

“A prodigy of his generation was actually defeated by a young man. He didn’t even have the ability to resist!”

“This...”

A cold wind blew past and the heavenly sword star that had turned into a blood mist dissipated. Everyone widened their eyes in shock.

“The Heavenly Sword Star is a half-step void interpretation expert. He is even wearing a level one armor. Even if I wanted to kill him, I would have to use the power of my abhijna. This young man’s strength is... So Strong!”

The only level one void interpretation expert was staring at Wang Xian with a twinkle in his eyes. He was filled with amazement.

It was very easy for him to kill a half-step void interpretation expert. He could even kill him in one move.

However, he wanted to kill a half-step void interpretation level heaven’s pride expert. This heaven’s pride expert was even wearing a level one armor. Even he had to attack several times consecutively before he could do it.

However, from the moment this young man attacked until the end, he had been suppressing heavenly sword star until he exploded into a bloody mist. Heavenly Sword Star did not have the ability to resist at all.

The level one armor of the void interpretation level collapsed immediately.

“Awooo!”

Xiao Ha, who was standing on Ling Jian ‘ER’s shoulder, saw Wang Xian’s violent attack. It let out a weak roar and shrunk its head.

As someone with higher intelligence, it naturally recognized that this young man was the owner of the gigantic ferocious beast that had bitten it last night.

“He’s really not simple. As expected of the owner of a level one void interpretation ferocious beast!”

Ling Jian ‘er was also sizing up Wang Xian with a face full of astonishment.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian swept a contemptuous glance across the arena and sneered. He raised his head and looked towards the left.

“You... you want to...”

Wang Xian swept his gaze over. The four young men who were following heavenly sword star had a drastic change in expression. They looked at him in horror and retreated backward in horror.

“Some people are not people that you can offend!”

Wang Xian looked at the four of them without any emotion.

He waved his arm and a golden light swept toward the four of them.

“No!”

The four of them hurriedly swept their faces towards the back.

However, due to the huge difference in strength, their escape was futile.

“Ahhhhhh!”

Four sounds of participation rang out. The four young men who had been following heavenly sword star and showing off their prowess died immediately.

“This... What attribute did he use?”

“Judging from the aura fluctuation, it’s water attribute. Golden Water? What kind of heaven and Earth Water Is This?”

“Also, his attack just now was weird. Could it be that he has dual attributes?”

“If he has dual attributes, that would be heaven-defying!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The two middle-aged men looked at Wang Xian’s attack with a thoughtful expression.

During Wang Xian’s attack, they could feel the strong fluctuation of the water attribute energy as well as other attributes.

However, Wang Xian had the heaven-deceiving pearl which could perfectly conceal his attribute attacks.

The fire territory that he released just now contained both fire and Earth attributes. However, from the outside, it seemed to be condensed from water energy.

However, since he had the heaven-deceiving pearl, Wang Xian had released five attributes consecutively, which still left them extremely bewildered.

“From the attack just now, he might really have dual attributes!”

The expert at the first level of the Seethrough realm muttered and made a guess.

“Pa! PA! Pa!”

Wang Xian ignored the surprise of the crowd. With a wave of his arm, he kept the interspatial rings and walked straight into the sword mansion.

“Is he trying to break into the sword tomb? He’s not a swordsman!”

“Yeah, from his attack just now, I can tell that he’s not a swordsman!”

When the crowd saw Wang Xian walking into the sword tomb, they were bewildered.

Ling Jian ‘er looked at his figure and her eyes flashed. She followed behind him and walked into the sword tomb.

“Who do you think is stronger, Ling Jian ‘ER or Tian Jian Xing?”

A young man asked curiously when he saw Ling Jian ‘er walking into the sword tomb.

“Ling Jian ‘ER is ranked fifth on the prodigy roll and is ranked ten places higher than Tian Jian Xing. I think Ling Jian ‘er can kill Tian Jian Xing as well!”

“I want to know who that young man is now. Where did he come from? Why isn’t his name on the Heaven’s Pride Roll?”

“Let’s go and take a look. Let’s see if Ling Jian ‘ER is the one who has gone far or if that young man is the one who has gone far.”

“You can still see their figures? I think if that young man dares to stay here any longer, the experts of swords gate will definitely come and kill him. Maybe even the leader of Swords Gate will come. After all, this is his most outstanding son!”

Everyone watched Wang Xian and Ling Jian ‘er enter the sword tomb and whispered to each other behind them.

Buzz

Inside the sword tomb, when Wang Xian walked in, it was obvious that he seemed to have entered another space.

He looked around. Iron swords were stabbed into the ground. Some of the iron swords were full of rust and there were even short swords.

The visibility in the entire area was very low and he could only see a distance of a hundred meters ahead.

He walked on the various iron swords and walked forward quickly.

“Eh, where is he? Where did he go? Impossible, it’s impossible for him to advance a hundred meters!”

Ling Jian ‘er, who followed behind him, looked around with a stunned expression.

Without the figure of that young man, how could this be possible?

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Before she could think further, the iron sword on the ground suddenly flew up and attacked her.

She quickly dealt with it.

“He came in just like that, Hehe!”

Wang Xian had been walking past the sword graveyard that was a thousand meters long. He looked ahead with a smile.

It was a door, a sword-shaped door.

Wang Xian looked at the door and pushed it open.

Clang

The moment the sword door was opened, the sound of a sharp sword rushed into his mind.

“I, the Sword King, Junior, Congratulations on breaking through the Sword Tomb!”

“Kneel down and bow three times. You will be my disciple and receive the sword King’s inheritance!”

A golden voice entered Wang Xian’s mind, causing him to be slightly stunned. A look of astonishment appeared on his face.

The cold metallic voice did not carry any emotion. It was definitely not made by a human.

Wang Xian looked ahead and was stunned to see a corpse sitting on a chair.

The corpse was extremely skinny. Both of its hands were holding a blood-red longsword that was flowing with light. The longsword was trembling at this moment.

The voice originated from this longsword.

Wang Xian pursed his lips slightly and stared at the longsword.

The Longsword was at the fifth level of the Seethrough realm. Its level was very high, but it wasn’t enough to make a longsword speak human language.

It was obvious that the owner of the Longsword had set it up beforehand. The moment the swords gate was opened, the Longsword made this sound.

“You’re playing tricks!”

The Dragon Eyes of light and dark fire were opened. Wang Xian walked straight over and took the longsword from the corpse with a smile on his face.

Buzz

The Longsword at the fifth level of the Seethrough realm trembled slightly and was filled with spirituality.

Wang Xian’s arm trembled slightly and the longsword quieted down.

“What a good sword. If I had used this sword in the battle just now, I would have been able to kill the heavenly sword star easily!”
