Chapter 169: Breeding Spiritual Grass (3)

Immense energy of Azure Dragon filled itself into the spiritual bead herb, which spurred its growth.

The Azure Dragon energy had allowed the herb to grow from 20 centimeters to 30 centimeters. Gradually, the spiritual beads grew to half a meter under the irrigation of the energy.

“Hmm? Why hasn’t it reached the level of a spiritual medicine?” Wang Xian stared at the spiritual beads in bewilderment and used his Dragon Energy to check its status.

“Oh my.... This spiritual bead might be at a bottleneck stage!” Wang Xian frowned. Every living thing had its shackles to unlock, spiritual grass included.

It usually required a long period of time before the spiritual grass reached the stage of spiritual medicine.

As time passed, the energy of the herb would be accumulated, and it would be able to break free from its shackles.

What Wang Xian was trying to do was to speed up the growth by force, but it was unable to break the shackles.

“Looks like it’s not going to be as easy as I’d expected.” Wang Xian frowned again as he realized that it was not easy to cultivate spiritual medicine.

It would be too absurd to think that any random person with a wood element energy could use their power to speed up the growth for spiritual medicine.

In fact, unknown to Wang Xian, his Azure Dragon energy contained essence of the wood element. A pinch of energy was equivalent to one hundred points of wood elements.

As he was trying to recover from the energy lost, he gave it a thought and shook.

“Since spiritual medicines are able to boost my dragon energy, does it mean that the shackles can only be broken by injecting dragon energy?”

Immediately, Wang Xian injected some dragon energy right into the spiritual bead herb.

Instantly, Wang Xian saw spiritual beads born from the spiritual bead herb.

[Spiritual Bead: Level 1]

[Extractable Dragon Energy: 432]

“Yes! I did it! I did it!”

A tuft of herb had finally been cultivated into spiritual grass after a massive amount of Azure Dragon energy and 14 points of dragon energy had been used up. Wang Xian was definitely on cloud nine.

In conclusion, compared to the energy depleted in cultivating the medicine and the amount of energy he could gain from it, he still had close to 400 points of dragon energy surplus.

However, the time taken to cultivate should be taken into consideration as well; it was not just the energy that was the crucial element.

Assuming Wang Xian took this amount of time, he would probably gain more than 400 dragon energy if he hunted in the sea.

“I shall continue and see if this can be cultivated to a higher level.”

Wang Xian’s heart was filled with willpower as he pumped more Azure Dragon energy into spiritual medicine.

The Azure Dragon energy allowed the spiritual bead medicine to speed up the growth upon breaking its shackles.

Gradually, as the spiritual bead medicine grew, the six spiritual beads on the stalk began to turn red.

After an hour, Wang Xian exhaled a long breath, looking exhausted.

In just an hour, he had used up all his Azure Dragon energy which only allowed the spiritual medicine to grow to about eighty centimeters, and was still far from the full evolution.

He decided to recover his energy before he carried on.

As the full recovery took place after an hour, he continued to pump the energy into the spiritual bead again.

Slowly, it grew to ninety centimeters, and to one meter.

Wang Xian sensed yet another shackle upon reaching one meter.

“Guess I have to use my dragon energy again.”

The difference between the Azure Dragon energy and the dragon energy was the Azure Dragon energy contained essence of the wood element and could be replenished through recuperation upon full consumption, while the dragon energy would be gone permanently under the same circumstance.

Currently, Wang Xian’s dragon energy was standing at 500,000, so it was not a big deal using just a bit to cultivate a tuft of spiritual medicine.

This time, Wang Xian used up 200 dragon energy.

[Spiritual Bead: Level 2]

[Extractable Dragon Energy: 2,312]

“It’s level 2! It has reached level 2, and the six spiritual beads have turned a fiery red color. These spiritual beads might be in their 500th year.”

He thought and continued to cultivate.

Since it was still early, he wanted to see how far he was able to cultivate.

One hour passed...

Two hours passed...

Eight hours passed...

Ten hours passed...

“I’m exhausted!” Wang Xian lay flat on the sea bed like a dead dragon after twelve long hours.

This was just like fighting in a war. No one would be able to stand after fighting such long hours, especially when all energy had been used up.

However, a smile was drawn across Wang Xian’s face as he persevered to push the spiritual medicine to three meters with the six spiritual beads bore with yellowish fruits.

[Spiritual Bead: Level 4]

[Extractable Dragon Energy: 13,654]

A Level 4 spiritual medicine had been created after more than ten hours, utilizing more than 3,000 dragon energy.

He realized that the cultivation would get tougher and tougher. It would require at least three days to reach Level 5.

It would take half a month to reach Level 6.

The higher the level, the tougher it gets. It might even need three to four months or more in order to reach Level 7 or 8.

He had to go on without any recuperation during this period.

“I shall let Xiao Yu try on one to test its effectiveness,” said Wang Xian happily as looked at the fruits and continued to recuperate.

Compared to the Level 1 spiritual beads, the current fruits were at the size of a fist and were beaming with a faint yellow light.

With a twist of his body, Wang Xian had transformed back to his human form. He then leaped to the villa’s roof. In his hand he held the spiritual bead medicine which stood at the height of three meters and the circumference of an arm.

“Let’s place it here then. It should not perish with a vitality of Level 4 spiritual medicine.”

Wang Xian set the six fruits down as he left the Level 4 spiritual medicine on the roof.

If anyone were to know that the spiritual medicine had been left on the roof, it would invite countless powerhouses to the villa to compete for it after a day.

I guess it’s past 8 o’clock, Wang Xian thought as he looked at the sky, which had already brightened up after he was gone with the cultivation for more than ten hours since the day before.

He got himself dressed and made his way down.

He peeped into the rooms at the second level. It seemed like both Xiao Yu and her master had already gone down.

When he came to the ground floor, he heard soft exclamations from outside.

He came to the front door and saw that Xiao Yu was training with a sword in her hand. Sweat was rolling down her cheeks.

On the other side, Elder Fang was dressed entirely different from her two previous outfits.

She was dressed in a complete tight-fitting gear which displayed her perfect body line.

Such sultriness to that derriere which was firm, round and big.

Such enticement with her hair tied up.

Elder Fang was standing on the other side while giving guidance to Xiao Yu’s sword skills.

“All right, we shall call it a day. We need to rush to Flow City,” said Elder Fang as she looked at the time.

Hu! Xiao Yu took a deep breath and replied, “Yes, Master!”

“Brother! Where did you come from? And just where were you yesterday?” asked Xiao Yu with some astonishment as she saw Wang Xian standing at the front door.

She had searched for her brother for a long time when he had suddenly disappeared.

“Oh, I went out and got something for you,” said Wang Xian with a smile.

“How mysterious. I can’t believe that you are starting to hide things from me already!” said Xiao Yu, with her lips touted. Feeling unhappy, she said, “What on earth did you get for me that you had to leave without a sound. I almost called the cops after a long and wasted effort searching for you.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Ahem ahem.” Wang Xian smiled awkwardly as he was faced with his sister’s complaint and said, “I went to get something for your training. Here, take this!”

As he spoke, he presented the fruits bore from a Level 4 spiritual medicine.
