Chapter 1139: 1140 beast taming techniques and special bloodlines

Translator: 5496903

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered with a demonic expression as he carefully observed his surroundings.

The light and dark fire dragon eyes penetrated the surroundings and directly penetrated through the sculptures. Just as Feng Luan said, there was a drop of blood of a ferocious beast at the head of each sculpture.

Some of the blood had even dried up and formed a lump.

“There are no hidden compartments in the surroundings, nor are there any other spaces. I have checked all the positions. If there are any abnormalities, these sculptures are the only ones!”

Feng Luan said to Wang Xian, “But I have already broken more than 20 sculptures and there aren’t any abnormalities at all!”

“Then why? Could it be that the two ferocious beasts outside are lying?”

Wang Xian frowned slightly.

The main hall occupied a radius of one kilometer and was more than 200 meters tall.

The hall was densely packed with sculptures of ferocious beasts. There were more than 1,000 sculptures of ferocious beasts in the entire hall. Among them, the most important one, the tallest and largest one, had been destroyed by the Phoenix. However, there was nothing inside.

“Why did this Hundred Patrol Master, a Beast Tamer, make so many sculptures?”

Wang Xian felt a headache coming on. This old man Bai Xun didn’t play by the rules at all!

If this was the last place where he died, you should at least make a coffin and place it in the middle. You should either place your treasures together with yourself or put them in your interspatial ring.

All of these sculptures were a mess of ferocious beasts. What a Weirdo!

“According to my understanding, this old man is very talented. He went from an ordinary powerhouse with half-step void interpretation bloodline to a top-notch powerhouse in the Liuhai region. The process is beyond everyone’s imagination. Maybe he has a unique mind!”

Feng Luan frowned and analyzed from the side.

“It’s just that he has some mental problems!”

Wang Xian said bluntly.

Feng Luan rolled her eyes at him and looked around. “The answer is definitely in this sculpture. Therefore, I plan to destroy all the sculptures!”

Wang Xian nodded his head slowly. This was the only way to deal with this kind of eccentric fellow.

“Roar!”

Suddenly, two shrill roars were heard, causing Feng Luan and Wang Xian to frown slightly.

“Those two explosive golden lions have been killed. They are coming in!”

Feng Luan said.

“Then let’s hurry up!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and waved his hand at the sculpture beside him.

“Peng!”

However, what surprised Wang Xian was that his casual attack did not break the sculpture.

“This sculpture is made from the mud at the bottom of the sticky sea that is 100,000 meters deep. It can only be broken by a powerful strike from a level nine transcendent!”

Feng Luan looked at it and said with a smile.

“Are you mocking me for being weak? !”

Chu Xian looked at her speechlessly.

“I am a little weak!”

Feng Luan said straightforwardly.

“Er...”

Wang Xian was speechless. His current strength was indeed much weaker than a void interpretation expert.

“Brat who sneaked in just now, come and face your death!”

At this moment, a cold and murderous voice was heard, causing Wang Xian to frown.

Boom! Boom! Boom

At this moment, six figures appeared at the entrance of the main hall.

The six of them did not barge in directly. Instead, they observed their surroundings vigilantly. When they saw the sculptures, they frowned.

At this moment, all six of them had serious injuries on their bodies. Even the level 3 insightful emptiness realm expert from the Windhowl Kingdom had a terrifying wound on his chest.

The two Golden Lions had gone all-out in their attacks, causing one void interpretation expert to fall on the spot, while the others were all heavily injured.

However, they did not hesitate and directly entered the main hall.

Now that someone had entered the main hall, they were afraid that all the treasures would be taken away.

“Feng Wuji, are you sure that someone has already entered?”

The old man in the Python robe from star-moon kingdom asked in a deep voice.

“Of course!”

Feng Wuji replied coldly. He scanned his surroundings and said, “Enter the hall and those who are strong will get the treasures!”

As he spoke, he flew to the highest position and swept his gaze forward.

The other five people didn’t have any objections as they scanned their surroundings.

“Who is it?”

“Someone has indeed entered!”

“Fish in troubled waters, kill them!”

The old man dressed in a python robe quickly looked towards Wang Xian and Feng Luan. His eyes were flashing with a cold expression.

The other five insightful emptiness realm experts moved and looked over. A terrifying killing intent gushed out from the six of them and locked onto Wang Xian and Feng Luan.

Wang Xian’s expression changed instantly when he saw them.

“Hehe!”

Feng Luan, who was at the side, looked at the injuries on their bodies. Instead, she smiled gently and stared at the six of them who were flying over with a smile on her face.

On her body, a terrifying flame rose slowly. A Phoenix started to rotate slowly around her, making her look extremely majestic.

Wang Xian retreated backward.

“Everyone, those who are powerful will know about the treasure!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Feng Luan looked at them and said indifferently without any hint of fear.

Her voice didn’t have the slightest fluctuation.

“What? An insightful void martial artist!”

“He actually took advantage of us to enter the main hall!”

“Damn it!”

The expressions of the six of them changed drastically. They had fought to the death just now, but they didn’t expect that someone had already entered the main hall.

They had suffered heavy injuries in order to enter the main hall, and one of them even died.

“I saw that you were all fighting, so I didn’t disturb you all!”

Feng Luan’s gaze swept past them. The terrifying flames and the mystical Phoenix made them look mysterious and powerful.

The six people’s expressions changed. Feeling Feng Luan’s aura, they felt some fear in their hearts.

The six of them looked at each other and then looked at their own injuries, their faces turning somewhat black.

If they were to fight at this moment, they might lose their lives here.

Just now, a profound void martial artist was injured!

“Did you guys get any treasures?”

The level three profound void martial artist from the Fengxiao Kingdom asked with a gloomy face.

“If we got any treasures, we would have already left. You guys can take a look around and see if we got anything!”

Feng Luan shook her head lightly.

The six insightful emptiness realm experts looked at Feng Luan and then at Wang Xian. They did not have any pet eggs in their hands. They looked at the broken sculpture on the ground. They could not sense any spiritual artifact fluctuation on it.

“Bang!”

A insightful emptiness realm expert scanned the surroundings. With a wave of his arm, he shattered a sculpture. Other than the dried blood of the ferocious beasts, there was nothing else in the broken sculpture.

The expert took a look at the blood and began to search the surroundings again.

“HMPH, let’s Search!”

The group of people snorted coldly. They scanned the surroundings and began to search for treasures.

Before they confirmed that there were treasures, no one would fight to the death.

The insightful emptiness realm experts had a lifespan of a thousand years. They cherished their lives very much.

“Let’s continue!”

Feng Luan looked at Wang Xian and said directly.

“Alright!”

Seeing that the six insightful emptiness realm experts did not make a move, he heaved a sigh of relief and nodded.
