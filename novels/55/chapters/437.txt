Chapter 438: The Champion Of The Younger Generation (3)

“Bian Yaoquan from the Medical Saint Sect attempted to ambush me previously. It’s only natural that I send him to hell!” Wang Xian’s voice reverberated across the crowd. He was completely casual in tone when he said it.

However, a lot of people felt their hearts skip a beat because of what he said as they were clearly dumbfounded.

“Miracle Doctor Wang admitted to killing the disciple of the Medical Saint Sect?”

“This... Is this confidence or arrogance?”

“No matter what, he’s too darn cool. He killed the disciple of the Medical Saint Sect just because he tried to ambush him. Moreover, he admitted to it without any fear!”

The surrounding crowd was astonished as their eyes widened and stared at Wang Xian. At the same time, they couldn’t help but exclaim at the thought of the incident!

A short distance away, several young men and the disciples of various Sacred Sects raised an eyebrow. They hesitated for a moment before walking over. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

This was a huge incident. Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown had admitted to killing a disciple from the Medical Saint Sect.

“Great. Great. I had not expected our brother from the Medical Saint Sect to be really killed by you!”

When Hua Mingshan heard Wang Xian, his face immediately sank as he stared at Wang Xian, brimming with killing intent.

“Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown, you are the first person to ever dare to kill the disciple of our Medical Saint Sect. You are also the one that is most deserving of death!”

The old and middle-aged men beside Hua Mingshan also squinted their eyes which were beaming with killing intent.

They had not expected Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown to admit to killing the disciple of Medical Saint Sect so casually.

His casual tone was a clear insult to their Medical Saint Sect!

“Hehe. If you wish to kill me, you’d better be prepared to be killed. Do you think I wouldn’t dare to make a move just because you guys are from a Sacred Sect?”

Wang Xian looked at Hua Mingshan with ridicule as he continued. “Since he dared to offend me, he better be prepared to die. The Elders of the Sacred Followers Guild were one example. Your Medical Saint Sect won’t be an exception!”

“Damn! How dominant is he! So what if they are Sacred Sects?”

“I have long heard that Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown is exceptionally arrogant and today I have finally witnessed it with my own eyes. He’s my idol!”

“To be daring enough to admit he killed a disciple of the Medical Saint Sect, it’s clear that he’s making the Medical Saint Sect his enemy. Now I’m really curious why the incident with the Sacred Followers Guild ended without a clear explanation!”

“It feels like Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown is going to get himself killed after offending Sacred Sect after Sacred Sect. The Medical Saint Sect isn’t like the Sacred Followers Guild. The Medical Saint Sect adopted a family-style format. The Medical Saint Sect would never just let it go like the Sacred Followers Guild after he killed a disciple of the Bian Family.”

“Sigh. I hope Miracle Doctor Wang has the strength to back his words. It’s a natural thing to do since the disciple of the Medical Saint Sect wanted to kill him first. However...”

When the crowd heard Wang Xian, they exclaimed in astonishment.

No one dared to say the same things Wang Xian had. If the disciples of a Sacred Sect offended you, you could either tolerate it or assassinate them without being discovered by the Sacred Sect.

Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown was definitely the first one to admit his actions so openly.

“Haha. How incredible! It’s no surprise you are ranked top on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart. Just considering your guts, no one would be a match. The only uncertainty is whether you will be finished off by the Medical Saint Sect subsequently!”

At this moment, a coarse voice sounded from the side.

The crowd immediately looked over and realized it was Shi Ming from the Imperial Beast Sect. He seemed to have a little admiration for Wang Xian after the incident.

“Tsk! He’s simply courting his own death. For a person to go against a Sacred Sect, he must be tired of living!” At the other end, Qiao Fuzi from the Qiao Clan stared at Wang Xian with disdain as he remarked coldly.

The crowd followed the voice and looked over once again. They saw Qiao Fuzi from the Qiao Clan crossing his arms before his chest with disdain beaming in his eyes.

“So what if he was to go against a Sacred Sect. I wouldn’t offend others if they didn’t offend me. If the disciple of a Sacred Sect is courting death, he deserves his death. There’s no way one should endure the humiliation!”

Xiao Ran from the Xiao Clan had just arrived when he heard Qiao Fuzi. He replied plainly as he stared coldly at him.

Huh?

Qiao Fuzi’s felt a little insulted as he turned and glowered at Xiao Ran. His eyes beamed as he commented, “A disciple of a Sacred Clan dares to make such claims?”

“A guy who becomes arrogant by relying on his family or sect will just be trash at the end of the day!” Xiao Ran replied plainly to Qiao Fuzi!

“Sss. F*ck! These words are too domineering!”

“A person who becomes arrogant because of his background will just be trash! Damn! This quote from the demon-like talent from Xiao Clan is just darned passionate!”

“It’s no surprise he’s a demon-like talent that has reached the Inborn Realm at the age of fifteen. For him to be able to say such words and have such a mentality, we aren’t a match for him!”

“Strength rules in the Underworld. People might be fearful because you are a disciple of a Sacred Sect but they would never respect you. Only true experts can command respect. He’s indeed deserving of the title of the youngest Inborn expert in history!”

The surrounding crowd looked towards Xiao Ran with shock and admiration. There were few people who could say those words. Moreover, he was a disciple of a Sacred Clan. One could say that there wouldn’t be a second person like him.

It’s no surprise he could become an Inborn expert at such a young age. Other than the resources he has, he also has the right mentality and attitude.

“YOU...”

Qiao Fuzi glowered at Xiao Ran as his expression changed drastically. They were both disciples of Sacred Clans but Xiao Ran’s noble words had completely embarrassed him.

“At this moment, you should be saying you will wait for our contest in the Outstanding Young Heroes Competition and speak with your strength. I will agree to your request!” Looking at Qiao Fuzi, who had turned furious from embarrassment, Xiao Ran commented plainly.

“Lololol... How domineering!”

“I can now understand why the Laozu of Xiao Clan has designated him to be the clan leader. He’s simply too cool!”

“He’s my idol from now onwards. To speak with strength and not be arrogant because of his background! Haha!”

“Wow. This little brother is so handsome. I’ll wait for you to grow up and I’ll marry you!”

“With your looks, don’t even bother thinking of marrying the young clan leader of a Sacred Clan. He’s a fifteen-year-old Inborn expert and could very well reach a higher realm when given time. All I wanted to ask is if the young clan leader is alright with guys? If he’s only interested in girls, it’s fine too. I can go to Thailand!”

The surrounding crowd erupted into a raucous discussion from what Xiao Ran said. This was the demeanor that a supreme talent should possess.

“Great, great! Just you wait! I’m going to let you kneel before me when the time comes!” Qiao Fuzi’s was flushed as he stared harshly at Xiao Ran. His expression had also turned hideous.

“Judging from what had transpired, this disciple of Qiao Clan is a far cry from the young clan leader of the Xiao Clan in the aspects of both mentality and demeanor of an expert!”

“It would seem Xiao Clan has a true supreme talent. This guy will definitely not be ordinary in the future!”

Around them, the elders of the Saint and Saintess were looking at Xiao Ran in awe.

Several Elders of the Xiao Clan, who were standing beside Xiao Ran, were extremely proud. This was their young clan leader and his actions had been exceptionally dominant!

At the side, there were also several disciples from Sacred Sects and Clans who looked at this overly young Inborn expert with surprise and astonishment.

Tang Yinxuan smiled faintly as she looked to Xiao Ran, turned to Hua Mingshan from the Medical Saint Sect and eventually turned to Wang Xian.

“He’s still as domineering as before.”

Recalling how this young man had annihilated the entire Dark Conjurers because of two disciples, and killed the Saint and Saintess of her Heavenly Sound Sect, she could feel her heart thumping violently.

In this generation of youths, who could be a match for him?

“Great! How domineering! Let me tell you this! No matter who you are and no matter what your reasons, you will die for killing the disciple of our Medical Saint Sect!”
