Chapter 1417: 1417, what is a chosen one? 3

“Sister Yinxuan’s charm is really great!”

“All of you have great charm. To be able to meet all of you is the blessing of my life!”

“That’s right!”

A group of people walked on the streets of Flaming Sun City with smiles on their faces as they chatted.

They strolled until twelve o’clock before they returned to the manor where they were staying.

As night fell, the entire flaming sun city was extremely quiet and filled with harmony.

This was the most harmonious city they had ever come to.

The customs of the people and the city Lord’s manor were very good, and there were no rich family disciples who were courting death to provoke them.

Even if they met a young prodigy who wanted to pursue Tang Yinxuan, their attitude was still considered very good.

“Let’s go, let’s go and watch the competition!”

The next morning, Xiao Yu, Guan Shuqing, and the other girls said excitedly.

“Let’s go, I also want to see the strength of some of the geniuses in the Flaming Sun Continent!”

Feng Luan nodded and paid a private visit in disguise. She naturally wanted to go and take a look at such important matters related to the dynasty.

She wanted to see the venue and the strength of the younger generation of the dynasty.

After eating some simple food, the group walked towards the Academy of Flaming Sun City.

Flaming Sun City Academy was the largest academy in the entire flaming sun continent region. It was also the most luxurious academy.

The Dean was an expert at the second level of the Seethrough Void Tier.

In this prodigy tournament, not only would the dean appear, even the mayor would come to watch the final match.

When Wang Xian and the rest arrived, they realized that there were already more than 100,000 people gathered in the surroundings.

As the first prodigy tournament held by the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, the prizes that were presented were extremely precious.

Once one could enter the dragon and Phoenix Royal City, one could basically become the general of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire in the future!

This was a dream for all the youths.

The surroundings of the entire competition ground were very lively. Many people sat on their seats and watched.

In the arena, there were five arenas competing at the same time. The arena in the middle was the largest, having a radius of more than a kilometer.

This competition came from more than 20 cities. Only the top five geniuses of each city had the qualifications to come to Flaming Sun City for the competition.

Among the 120 geniuses from each city, only 10 had the qualifications to enter the dragon-phoenix Royal City for the final competition.

At that time, there would be 200 geniuses from the 20 continents battling each other.

“Come, come, our seats are at the front!”

Everyone came to the front.

“Today is the first Heaven’s pride competition of the dragon-phoenix dynasty. It’s also the beginning of the battle for the Geniuses of Our Flaming Sun Competition Zone. You are from our flaming sun competition zone...”

Before the start of the competition, an old man floated at the front.

More than 100 geniuses from more than 20 cities came to the arena.

The old man was the city lord of Flaming Sun City, a third-level insightful void tier powerhouse.

The city Lord opened with a long opening speech, and then the competition began with the announcement of the principal of Flaming Sun Academy.

Draw lots and fight!

“Young Master Xiaoyue, Young Master Xiaoyue!”

“Qianjun, Qianjun will definitely win!”

“Goddess Huahua, I love you. If you get first place, I’ll Marry You!”

“Beat this guy up!”

When the geniuses from the various cities drew lots one by one, the audience cheered for them.

They cheered for the geniuses they liked and thought highly of.

“Great-grandfather, what are we doing here? Are We watching their match?”

“With their strength, I’m not saying that I can defeat all of them by myself!”

“With their strength, they still dare to call themselves geniuses. If they were placed in the LADYBOY graveyard, they would become a joke!”

At this moment, in a spectator stand around the arena, five or six people were sitting in a corner.

A young man lazily looked at the hundred or so geniuses in the arena, his eyes filled with arrogance and disdain.

In his opinion, he could easily crush these so-called geniuses.

They weren’t qualified to be called geniuses yet.

Only people like him were truly geniuses!

“There will be a huge change in the monster graveyard. The Monster Race is restless. There’s news that some monster race wants to establish a monster dynasty!”

“However, the monster race isn’t unified. Some monster race don’t agree. They want to split up like humans and establish a dynasty!”

“Right now, there is a huge battle going on inside the Demonic Beast Graveyard!”

An old man standing beside the young man frowned and said slowly with a solemn expression.

“A few hundred thousand demonic beast races want to establish a dynasty? This is really interesting!”

“Isn’t it better for them to fight among themselves? It will just weaken their own strength!”

The young man said with a curious smile.

“As the saying goes, if you don’t destroy it, you won’t be able to establish it. If you destroy it, you’ll be able to establish it later. This isn’t a good thing for the humans in the human-demon graveyard or even the flowing sea region!”

“In the transcendence continent, the ten thousand fey empire. You can see that they have the least number, but they are one of the five great empires!”

“Once the demon beasts in the human-demon graveyard are unified, they will erupt with terrifying might. We have to make some preparations in advance!”

“Although the strength of the young people here can not be compared to the geniuses in the human-demon graveyard, each of them is a talent that can be molded. In the future, they won’t be inferior to others!”

As the old man spoke, his gaze swept over the few young people on the arena, and a satisfied expression appeared on his face.

“It’s great-grandfather. Great-grandfather, you’ve come personally. It’s not easy to recruit some disciples. Our Blood Stream sect’s reputation is placed here!”

When the young man heard the old man’s words, his expression turned solemn as he spoke arrogantly.

The old man faintly nodded his head.

The mutation in the monster-human graveyard would definitely affect the human side.

And as the top faction in the monster-human graveyard, they were able to get to where they were today because they had a sense of danger.

With the rise of the demonic beasts, they had to make preparations in advance and recruit more geniuses and experts to prepare for the future.

When they came to flaming sun city, they happened to find out that the heaven’s favorites competition was being held here. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Let the competition begin!”

At this moment, on the four arenas, there were already eight young geniuses standing.

The Battle of Heaven’s favorites had already begun.

Wang Xian and the rest were watching it with great interest.

Although their battle seemed extremely childish in the eyes of Wang Xian and the rest, it was just like an adult watching a child fight. It was also filled with fun.

Cheers and cheers could be heard from the surroundings from time to time. The atmosphere of the entire competition ground was extraordinary.

Wang Xian and the rest watched more than ten matches in the morning.

In the afternoon, the group of girls felt bored and went to some gourmet restaurants in flaming sun city to eat delicious food.

The next morning, the group returned again.

The competition was only for two days. In other words, ten heaven’s favorites would be born in the afternoon and would head to the Dragon and Phoenix Empire to participate in the finals.

“That person called Xiaoyue, Qian Jun, Liu Fengwen, Zhou Hai, and Nangong Huahua are all at transcendent level 9. They should be able to rank in the top five!”

Mang Hong stood at the back and watched the competition.
