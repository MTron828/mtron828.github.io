“Those are the common brands inside.”

Wang Xian, Xiao Yu, and Xiao Mi were shopping around the car show.

All the luxury cars were placed at the entrance. As they walked further in, the cars in the show were mostly low to mid-range brands. The three of them walked one round briefly.

“Which car looks better?” asked Wang Xian to Xiao Yu with a smile.

“In terms of appearance, the pink Bentley is the nicest. Maserati is pretty, but if we’re getting a car, I suppose a BMW or Mercedes Benz will do,” said Xiao Yu to Wang Xian with a smile.

“Come with me.”

Wang Xian nodded and smiled. He thought that since he was still left with over 4 million in his card, it should be enough to get that pink Bentley.

When they returned to the pink Bentley, many people were gathered around, and the majority of them were ladies.

The Pink Bentley gave off youthful vibe amid elegance. Indeed, it was attractive to the ladies.

“Hubby, when you have the money, you can get me the pink Bentley, right?”

“No problem, Wifey. Tomorrow. If I got the lady of luck tomorrow, I’d buy it for you!”

“Tomorrow? Hubby, why do we have to wait till tomorrow?”

“I bought a lottery ticket, and the result will only release at night. If I win the first price, we can come and collect the Bentley immediately.”

“You... You go to hell.”

When they walked over, they overheard the young couple’s conversation. Everyone around them was smiling amiably.

“This car is lovely, but it’s too expensive. The entire car would cost 4.2 million. Alas!” A middle-aged man who dressed like a successful businessman in his suit shook his head.

“It’s Bentley. Even slightly cheaper ones will cost 3 million. The price of this pink Bentley can buy two decent houses,” a girl next to the car mumbled as she could not stop taking pictures of the vehicle.

Many people fancied the car, but they were being put off by the price.

“4.2 million?”

Wang Xian observed the car carefully. He made a decision after he noticed that Xiao Yu took a fancy to the car.

“Hey, handsome!” Wang Xian called upon the salesman who was standing next to the car.

“Sir, how may I help you?” the young salesman looked at Wang Xian puzzledly and asked with a smile.

“Can we do a test drive?” As Wang Xian asked, he took out a bank card. “We’ll buy it immediately if we’re satisfied with it!”

That young salesman was slightly taken aback as he looked at the bank card in Wang Xian’s hand. Immediately, he replied, “Sir, hang on. I’ll get my manager here!”

“Okay.” Wang Xian nodded. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Brother...” After the conversation, Xiao Yu tugged Wang Xian’s arm and shook her head, “Brother, this is too expensive. Besides, it’s too striking...”

“I told you to finish the money on the card. After getting this car, the card should have about $30,000 left. Just nice for your pocket money.” Wang Xian chuckled.

“You still have more than 4 million on it?” Xiao Yu’s eyes were agape with her lips slightly parted. She looked cute with her shocked look.

This afternoon, they had already spent almost $300,000 on their clothes and bags. After paying for a watch that cost nearly $900,000, the card still had more than $4 million on it.

“Gosh, he’s a nouveau riche indeed. Diamond card from the Agricultural Bank of China. To get that card, you’ll need at least $5 million in your account.”

“Someone is really buying the pink Bentley. He’s rich.”

“This is the true-blue nouveau riche. Buying a Bentley for his sister. Why don’t I have such a good brother?!”

“He’s the rich second generation. I’m sure. It seems like they spent the money on the card in just a day. Oh gosh!”

The crowd stared at Wang Xian shockingly.

A slender and tall figure with good-looking appearance. At the same time, he had a unique demeanor which gave off a noble vibe.

But the two girls beside him were somewhat ordinary even though they were pretty.

After all, there were too many pretty girls in this era.

“Xiao Yu, your brother is filthy rich now. He is actually buying you a Bentley that is over $4 million. if you drive this to school, I really can’t imagine...” Xiao Mi shook Xiao Yu on her arm as she spoke with her eyes bright.

“Xiao Mi, do you think I’ve become rich overnight?” asked Xiao Yu dumbfoundedly.

“You’re a swan that turns into a Phoenix now. I envy that you have such an awesome brother!” Xiao Mi said with envy.

“Hehe!” Xiao Yu chuckled as she wrapped her arms around Wang Xian’s arm.

“Sir, are you buying this car?” At this time, a middle-aged man was taking big steps as he followed beside the young salesman. With enthusiasm, he asked Wang Xian.

“Yes, but can we do a test drive?” Wang Xian asked, “Money is not an issue. We’ll buy the car immediately if there’s no problem.”

“Sure, of course!” The middle-aged manager answered without the slightest hesitation. He knew that the young man had the buying power.

“Great, where can we do the test drive?” asked Wang Xian.

“Sir, there’s a place outside just for test driving. I’ll accompany you guys there,” the middle-aged manager replied immediately.

“Okay,” Wang Xian nodded and looked at Xiao Yu with a smile. “Let’s go for a test drive!”

“Brother, I’ve only had my driving license for a few days. What if I damage the car?” Xiao Yu said with a bitter face, as she did not dare to drive.

She knew the repair cost of the car would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

“It’s okay. The manager next to you will remind you. Besides, the car is insured after you buy it. If you hit the car, just repair it!” Wang Xian smiled as he spoke without much thought.

The manager next to them chuckled when he heard Wang Xian. “Yes, babe. Don’t worry.”

There was another sentence that he did not spell out: Nouveau riches are rich. You don’t need to worry!

“Fine!” Xiao Yu nodded her head and walked to the car. The middle-aged manager sat in the passenger seat to drop reminders to her. Wang Xian and Xiao Mi were seated at the back seats.

“Here, babe, I’ll do an introduction!”

The middle-aged manager got into the car and began introducing the various functions of the luxury car to Xiao Yu.

Xiao Yu listened with flickering radiance in her eyes. The functions of this car were not what the cars in the driving school could compare to.

“Let’s go. We’ll take a drive out for two laps!” the middle-aged manager said with a smile.

Xiao Yu took a deep breath and spun to look at her brother.

“Don’t worry and drive on. Don’t be scared,” Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Yes, brother!” Xiao Yu nodded and drove out cautiously.

She was driving with care as she had just gotten her license. But after two rounds of the test drive, she got her smile back on her face.

Driving a luxury car was better than driving those ordinary cars. To a certain extent, it was a comfortable ride.

Wang Xian looked at Xiao Yu’s smile and turned to the middle-aged manager sitting at the passenger’s seat. “I’ll get this car. Prepare all the paperwork for us.”

“Sure, we promise to get you all the paperwork done today.” The middle-aged manager was excited as his eyes were beaming. “Sir, I’ll return to the showroom first. You can take a seat over there while waiting.”

“Sure!” Wang Xian nodded.

They drove the car back to the car show and followed the manager back to the 4S showroom.

“Director Cui, you’re here!”

The Bentley showroom was spacious, and the decorations were extravagant with various luxurious Bentley cars in it.

After they entered the showroom, the manager saw a middle-aged man speaking to a couple with polite smiles. He was slightly stunned as he hurriedly greeted them.

“Yes, I just arrived!” Director Cui nodded and said. “Manager Zhao, Young Master Lin is buying that pink Bentley. Please help him with the paperwork.”

Manager Zhao revealed a shocked face and said hastily, “Director Cui, a customer was about to pay for that car.”

“Is it sold?” The young man beside Director Cui knit his eyebrows slightly.

“Young Master Lin, not yet.” When Director Cui heard the young man asking, he quickly replied, “This car was prepared for you. How can we sell it?”

As Director Cui spoke, he looked at Manager Zhao. “Let the customer know that the pink Bentley is already sold. We can recommend other cars for them.”
