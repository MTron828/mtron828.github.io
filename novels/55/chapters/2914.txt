Chapter 2915: request for assistance from the Dragon Palace 1

Killing god-emperor was like killing a dog!

Seeing another evil god-emperor’s life force quickly disappearing, everyone’s bodies trembled.

In a short period of time, two rank one god-emperor evil demons were killed by invincible battle techniques!

This was a god-emperor, and even in the glazed domain, he was still a god-emperor who stood high and mighty.

However, when these words came out from the mouth of an eighth level god-king expert, it sounded very strange.

But in fact, that arrogant fellow had killed two god Emperor Fey Phantoms.

And he had killed them in an instant!

Although he had relied on a supreme treasure!

Being able to take out a supreme treasure was his own ability!

“Roar!”

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

On the side, Fey Phantoms God Emperor, who was fighting with an earth-elemental nomological creature, let out a terrified roar when he saw his companion die.

On the other side, the other two demonic god Emperor’s eyes swept over, filled with fear.

They let out a low roar in unison, looked at each other, and stopped attacking.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The three demonic god Emperor’s quickly retreated, letting out a roar of unwillingness.

Demonic God Emperor’s level already possessed their own intelligence.

Seeing their two companions being killed, they were somewhat fearful.

They retreated immediately.

“Good, good. Green Mountain, I didn’t expect your disciple to have so many precious treasures!”

At this moment, the grand supreme fourth elder flew over from the side. He sized up the invincible battle method with a surprised expression, his heart trembling.

As the commander of the battle platform, he was naturally very clear about some of the things that had happened in the past few days.

Some of his subordinates even reported to him whether they should chase this kid out.

Since Green Mountain had returned during the glazed tile crisis, he naturally had to give green mountain some face and let this kid do whatever he wanted.

However, he didn’t expect that he would have so many powerful and terrifying trump cards, even though he thought he was a bad disciple of Green Mountain.

Those weapons could kill him instantly.

“Hahaha, no need to be so polite. Master, What do you think? I said that I didn’t leave because I was afraid that you would die this time. Now, Humph!”

Invincible battle method raised his head slightly and said proudly.

“Humph!”

Seeing invincible battle method being so arrogant in front of him, Shangshui divine emperor’s face turned black. He moved his body and flew to the side of invincible battle method.

“Pa!”

He moved his palm and directly restrained the back of invincible battle technique’s neck.

“I think you are a little arrogant. Did you get a lot of good things from the Dragon Palace this time?”

As Shangshui Divine Emperor spoke, he carried him and flew toward the fighting ring.

The fourth supreme elder followed him curiously.

“Cough, cough, master, I asked boss Wang and the old man of Heavenly Array to take out all the treasures that they got this time. Now, they have basically all been used up!”

“I came here to save my life. If I didn’t see that you were in danger, I wouldn’t have taken them out!”

Invincible said with a dark face.

“Master, I’m Your Savior Now!”

He shouted loudly!

“HMPH, Kid, I see that you’ve grown wings. You can now hold three or four supreme treasures. Do you want to fly into the Sky?”

Shangshui divine emperor’s expression turned even darker when he heard him say that he was his savior.

With a wave of his arm, he threw the treasure onto the ground of the fighting ring.

“Peng!”

A powerful force immediately caused it to land on the deck of the fighting ring.

“AH, master, you don’t know what’s good for you. I begged grandfather and grandmother to get these treasures!”

Invincible battle technique said with a face full of grief.

“Junior Brother Invincible!”

Second Senior Sister looked at invincible battle technique who was thrown over and immediately walked over to help him up.

“Cough Cough, senior sister, did you record the scene where invincible battle technique easily killed the god Emperor just now!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Invincible battle technique put away the venerate scar on his body and hurriedly asked his senior sister.

“Don’t worry, it’s already recorded!”

Second senior sister said speechlessly.

“That’s good, that’s good. Fortunately, my invincible hero killed the god Emperor as if he was killing a dog. Otherwise, he would have suffered a great loss this time.”

Invincible battle technique heaved a sigh of relief and said with a smile.

On the surrounding battle platform, when everyone heard invincible battle technique’s words, the corners of their mouths twitched.

However, looking at that careless fellow, everyone was filled with fear.

This fellow had killed two evil God monarchs, and it was a real battle record!

“Qingshan, your disciple really has many treasures. He’s really amazing!”

Seeing that his battle method was invincible, the fourth supreme elder sighed slightly at the divine emperor of Shangshui.

“Hehe, although my bad disciple is mischievous, he’s also quite likable. Ten years ago, he got to know the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. These treasures were all obtained from the Dragon King.”

The divine emperor of Shangshui said with a smile.

Although he didn’t like to listen to his bad disciple’s words, if it weren’t for this kid today, he would really be in danger.

“Dragon King? The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace?”

The fourth supreme elder revealed a surprised expression.

“Yes, otherwise, how could this kid get so many treasures? Even if he got them, he wouldn’t be able to use them!”

Shangshui divine emperor said with a smile.

“Master, I borrowed these treasures and I have to return them. Furthermore, the immortal slaying sword in the immortal slaying Calabash has already been used up!”

“I don’t have any trump cards left. I think we should retreat. Why don’t we return to the Celestial Magus region of the Imperial Star Domain? We can go to the eight desolates and six harmonies. At the very least, with boss Wang around and the Dragon Palace around, it won’t be so dangerous!”

Invincible battle technique said to his master.

“It seems that the Dragon Palace is really very, very powerful!”

The fourth supreme elder glanced at the supreme treasure in invincible battle technique’s hand and said slowly.

“Of course.”

Invincible battle technique replied.

“Fourth, you just sent out a call for help. How is it now?”

“We just shook off the demon god Emperor from our side!”

At this moment, a vast number of figures flew over from the surrounding battle platforms.

Seeing that they were all fine, the glazed divine emperors heaved a sigh of relief.

“Hehe, it was very dangerous just now. However, it was thanks to the disciples of Green Mountain who killed two demonic god Emperors that our crisis was alleviated. Otherwise, it would have been hard to say!”

The fourth supreme elder looked at the godly monarchs and said with a smile.

“What? Green Mountain’s disciple killed two demonic god Emperors?”

“What… happened?”

The Ten Godly Monarchs were slightly stunned and asked with astonishment.

“It was my disciple who borrowed a supreme treasure to kill the two demonic god Emperors.”

The god Emperor of Shangshui explained from the side.

“Supreme Treasure?”

The godly monarchs were shocked as they looked at invincible in combat techniques.

“Hehe, greetings, seniors!”

Invincible in combat techniques greeted them with a smile when he saw everyone’s gaze on him.

“The disciple of Green Mountain has a good relationship with the Dragon Palace. He borrowed many powerful supreme treasures from there before he came.”

“He also borrowed treasures to kill more than half of our demonic army.”

The fourth supreme elder swept his gaze across the void in front of him and said to the celestial emperors.
