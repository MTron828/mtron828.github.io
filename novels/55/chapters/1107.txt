“You guys wait here first!”

After entering the mayor’s residence, Feng Luan spoke to the people behind her as she looked at Wang Xian.

Wang Xian nodded. “Let’s Go!”

He brought her to a courtyard in the backyard. The two of them sat inside while the old lady stood by the side.

“Are you sure we should start from here?”

Wang Xian looked at Feng Luan and asked her directly.

“Yes! Initially, I wanted to take down the eastern sea city. However, the king of star-moon kingdom has broken through to the fifth level of the void interpretation realm. It’s not something I can handle. The holy sea town is pretty good!”

“The holy sea town is just a small town. Even if it’s lost, the king of star-moon kingdom wouldn’t come personally!”

Feng Luan nodded and sat beside Wang Xian. “I have to thank you this time. Otherwise, I might have to wait for a few years!”

Wang Xian smiled and shook his head. “It’s better for you to be here. I’m preparing to move the Dragon Palace to the supernatural continent!”

“Are you going to move it over?”

Feng Luan’s eyes revealed a hint of joy. “That’s even better. We can take care of each other while you are at the sea area next to us!”

Wang Xian nodded. “The situation in Shenghai town is a little special now. The city of Xilai town has been invaded by ferocious beasts and about 800,000 people have escaped to Shenghai town. There are too many people here now and we need to expand the city!”

“More people? That’s even better!”

Feng Luan was full of smiles. “I’m not afraid of more people, but I’m afraid of fewer people!”

“Oh right, when you take over Shenghai Town, you have to establish a kingdom. What’s the name of the kingdom? Is it the Fengxian Kingdom?”

Wang Xian asked curiously.

“Fengxian Kingdom?”

When Feng Luan heard his words, her face turned slightly red. However, she quickly shook her head.

“No, I’ve already thought of a name!”

Feng Luan smiled and shook her head. She looked to the side and said, “The name is the dragon and Phoenix Dynasty!”

“Dragon and Phoenix Dynasty? Just use the word ‘dragon’. As for the Dragon Clan...”

“It doesn’t matter. Although the Dragon clan is extremely overbearing, if they don’t mean to insult you, the Dragon Clan won’t find trouble with you for no reason. Moreover, more than a thousand years ago, there was a dragon and Phoenix dynasty. However, it was destroyed by me at that time. Now, the name is a little misleading!”

Feng Luan said with a smile on her face.

“Dragon and Phoenix, it fits perfectly!”

Wang Xian looked at her with a smile.

Feng Luan rolled her eyes slightly when she saw his smile. “When are you going to move the Dragon Palace to the transcendence continent?”

“I’ll take action immediately after helping you settle the matter here!”

Wang Xian retracted his smile and said seriously.

“Okay!”

Feng Luan nodded her head.

“Sir Wang Xian, everyone has been called over!”

At this moment, Jin Qianyuan walked in and said to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian nodded his head and looked at Feng Luan. “Let’s Go!”

In the Mayor’s residence, a group of people with some reputation and strength were all standing inside.

They were discussing in a low voice out of curiosity. From time to time, they would look at the group of terrifying experts outside.

“Sir Wang!”

Upon seeing Wang Xian’s arrival, everyone looked over and immediately greeted him respectfully.

“Yes, I’ve called everyone over. I have an important announcement to make!”

Wang Xian nodded and walked to the front. Feng Luan stood beside him and swept her gaze across everyone.

“Sir, please give us your instructions. Our lives are given to us by you. No matter what you say, even if we have to go through fire and water, we will do our best!”

The group of them also realized that something big might happen next. They bowed and expressed their opinions respectfully. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Wang Xian did not doubt their words at all.

Jin Qianyuan also stood respectfully in the middle of them, waiting for Wang Xian’s announcement.

“This is my family member. Her name is Feng. The group of people standing outside have two experts at the second level of the void interpretation stage, one expert at the third level of the void interpretation stage, and more than a thousand experts. I am prepared to hand over Shenghai town to her!”

Wang Xian said to them.

Jin Qianyuan and the rest were slightly stunned. Their faces were filled with shock.

“She will use the holy sea town as her foundation to establish the dragon-phoenix Kingdom!”

Wang Xian continued to speak when he saw the shocked crowd.

“What?”

“Establish a kingdom!”

“This...”

When Wang Xian finished his last sentence, everyone, including Jin Qianyuan, could not remain calm.

Establish a kingdom?

This was establishing a kingdom!

Establishing a kingdom!

To be able to do such a thing, everyone must be an expert, a formidable person, and a person with great ambitions.

Otherwise, who would dare to establish a kingdom?

Now, Wang Xian actually said that the woman beside him wanted to establish the Dragon-phoenix kingdom. This made everyone feel surreal.

“My Name Is Feng. Everyone can call me king Feng in the future!”

At this moment, Feng Luan spoke.

She did not reveal her real name because she still needed to hide it.

The moment she spoke, a majestic aura erupted from her body like a prehistoric beast.

The moment she opened her mouth, it was as though the entire space was centered around her.

Jin Qianyuan and the others felt their hearts skip a beat. They suddenly felt that this veiled woman in front of them was like a high and mighty God!

She was like a peerless expert who controlled the power of Heaven and earth, like their king!

This made them feel an urge to become small and worship her.

Jin Qianyuan’s eyes widened slightly, and his face was filled with shock.

He had once witnessed this aura. It was the aura of a king.

He had once seen the king in the Royal Palace of star-moon kingdom. When he saw the king, he did not dare to look directly at him.

However, this young woman in front of him had an imposing aura that was dozens, or even hundreds of times that of the king.

This was definitely not an ordinary woman. Even the princes and princesses of star-moon kingdom could not compare to her!

“Shenghai town has already withdrawn from star-moon kingdom. From now on, follow Feng and conquer the world together. She will lead all of you to lead Shenghai town to the stage of the supernatural continent!”

Wang Xian said from the side.

“Sir... Sir Wang, What About You?”

An old man looked at Feng Luan with some respect, then looked at Wang Xian and asked.

“Me? I will always be here. However, I will not ask about your matters in the future. Leave everything to Feng!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he looked at all of them and said in a deep voice, “I have no other requests. I hope that all of you will obey Feng with all your might and follow her to build an invincible empire that will shake the entire supernatural continent!”

“Invincible! Empire!”

Jin Qianyuan and the rest widened their eyes and could not help but gulp.

Empire? There were only five empires in the supernatural continent!

“We will listen to Lord Wang Xian!”

Everyone replied respectfully.

Following that, they looked at Feng Luan.

“Greetings, King Feng!”

“Greetings, King Feng!”

Everyone knelt on the ground and bowed.

Since Lord Wang Xian had asked them to respect her as king, they would respect her as king in the future!
