Chapter 3898: The 3897 Army of Faith was disbanded!

Translator: 549690339

“Let’s go. ”

Wang Xian led Lan Qingyue and flew towards the left.

Their speed was very fast. In order to intercept them better, Wang Xian flew towards the direction of the channel of the universe of faith.

With his current speed, he was ten times faster than the Army of the universe of faith!

After flying for a month, Wang Xian and the rest searched aimlessly.

It was indeed like looking for a needle in a haystack.

If it wasn’t for the fact that there were a lot of needles, Wang Xian wouldn’t have tried it.

However, there was a benefit.

The millions of gods and disciples who believed in the universal army couldn ‘t hide perfectly.

As long as they left a place not long ago, Wang Xian would be able to sense it.

As long as he sensed it, he would be able to give chase quickly!

In addition, the benefits of destroying an army of faith were too great. Even if it was a waste of time and a chance, Wang Xian would not give up.

“Both the radiant sun palace and the Amie Mountain Palace have been destroyed. D * mn it, that Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is really terrifying! ”

Just as Wang Xian was looking for an opportunity to give chase, the news was also transmitted to the Army of the universe of faith.

When they received the news, their expressions were extremely ugly.

In fact, they were a little terrified!

These were two huge armies, especially the army of the Amie Mountain Palace. Their overall strength could be ranked at the top among the 24 temples of the belief universe!

Such terrifying strength was directly destroyed. Once they encountered the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, their fate would be the same!

“The entire starry universe is so big. We might not be touched, but we still have to be careful!”

In a void space in the starry universe, an army of the palace was rapidly flying forward.

A rank seven pantheon said with a solemn expression.

“Once we encounter them, there’s no way we can escape. The elders in the palace have already sent news, and the belief fragment has already been obtained by the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. The strength of the Dragon King and the others is no longer something we can contend against! ”

A rank seven pantheon beside him spoke, his expression uncertain!

“Once we meet them, we will definitely be wiped out. I feel that we can split up and escape, flying towards the passage of faith. ”

A rank seven pantheon suggested.

His suggestion caused the surrounding rank seven pantheon to look pensive.

If they separated, their army would not be completely destroyed, and everyone would have to depend on their own luck.

This had both advantages and disadvantages. Once they separated, the chances of encountering the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace would increase.

“Let me ask the Elder and listen to his orders! ”

One of the Tier-7 Gods said.

“From the Elder’s point of view, they should separate us. After all, every palace can’t bear the risk of being completely destroyed. The risk is simply too great!

A tier 7 pantheon said slowly!

The rest of the Pantheon nodded and looked at each other.

“Then let’s split up. Each of us will split into small teams and head to the belief passage. Everyone, pray for your own good fortune. ” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

A rank seven pantheon said.

“Alright! ”

The rest of the rank seven pantheon nodded.

Soon after, the entire million-strong army was split into hundreds of small groups and flew around.

Although this method increased the chances of encountering the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.

The biggest advantage was that it would not cause the entire army to be wiped out!

This method was also the most helpless choice.

It wasn’t just this faith legion that was flying towards the channel of faith in this way.

There was also a large portion of the Faith Legion that split up the entire legion.

This was because none of the palaces could withstand the loss of the entire legion.

Time passed day by day.

The gods and believers of the Legion that believed in the universe flew in fear.

Their speed was about ten times slower compared to the flying speed of the entire army.

Each squad and the seventh and sixth order gods were the main force.

A few months passed in the blink of an eye.

Wang Xian led Lan Qingyue to search aimlessly in the universe.

At this moment, his mind stirred and he looked in a direction.

In that direction, he could vaguely sense the aura of the power of faith.

(‘I can sense it. Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian’s face lit up as he flew directly in that direction.

His speed was very fast. However, in less than ten minutes, a team of more than a hundred people who believed in the gods of the universe and their believers appeared in his line of sight.

There were more than a hundred gods and believers, but only ten of them were at the level of the gods.

“Eh? Are they scattered?”

Lan Qingyue raised her eyebrows and asked when she saw this!

There were only a hundred-plus gods and believers. This number was too small!

“We’ll know when we see it! ”

Wang Xian smiled and flew toward them instantly.

In front of them, before the hundred-plus gods and believers who believed in the universe could react, they saw a figure appear beside them.

When they saw the face of this figure, their pupils constricted slightly and despair appeared on their faces instantly!

“It’s… It’s the Dragon King!”

One of the believers said with a face full of shock!

Buzz

Wang Xian didn’t say anything. He waved his arm and a wave of energy charged straight at them.

Even if Wang Xian didn’t use the star jade fragment, he could easily kill the level seven gods!

A wave of energy swept out. The terrifying power instantly drowned out more than a hundred pantheon believers.

Only the level seven pantheon let out a scream. The rest, except for the few pantheon that Wang Xian deliberately left behind, were all dead!

Soul-absorbing power! ”

At the same time, he waved his arm and used the soul-absorbing power on the other few pantheon believers.

Due to the belief in the gods of the universe and the special reason of the power of belief, Wang Xian was unable to use the soul-absorbing power on existences of the same level.

After the soul-absorbing power was used, waves of information were transmitted into his mind.

“The army of belief in their palace has been completely destroyed and divided into hundreds of small teams. Hehe! ”

Wang smiled and said to Lan Qingyue! “Oh? Then, Xiao Xian, do you know the location of the other teams?”

Lan Qingyue raised her eyebrows and asked.

“1 have a rough idea. There is a team nearest to this place. There are more than

200 gods in that team!”

Wang Xian said.

“In that case, even if their army breaks up the gods and their believers, they can still kill them one by one. Furthermore, Xiao Xian, I think we can split up. We can even let Xiao Lan and the rest act alone! ”

Lan Qingyue suggested!

Sure.”

Wang Xian nodded. This time, if they could hunt down more believers, they could hunt down more.

This was an extremely rich resource!
