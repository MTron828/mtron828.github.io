Chapter 2909: had the power of the Dragon Palace behind him

“Not going? If you enter the battlefield and have the protection of the Jade Token, you won’t be in danger. Don’t worry, you won’t Die!”

Shangshui Divine Emperor Glared at him and said when he heard that his battle techniques were invincible.

“I’m not going. What if I run into danger and return to my own divine kingdom? Then I can’t stay here.”

“Master, I’m not going to the battlefield. I still have to stay here to protect you!”

Invincible said in a serious tone.

“You… You Brat…”

Hearing Invincible’s words, the divine emperor of Shangshui was so angry that he wanted to teach him a lesson.

However, there were too many people around him, so he didn’t make a move.

And he still wanted to protect him?

The divine emperor of Shangshui glared at his bad disciple with a dark expression.

“Hehe, Qingshan, this little disciple of yours doesn’t seem very old when I sense his aura, but his strength is quite good.”

The fourth Supreme Elder said with a smile from the side.

“Hehe, this bad disciple of mine is good at everything, except for being cowardly and mischievous.”

The divine emperor of Shangshui shook his head with a smile, patting the head of invincible in battle technique heavily.

Invincible battle technique’s mouth twitched. He really wanted to protect his master.

He wanted so many treasures from the Dragon Palace mainly to protect his own life.

But if he was not in danger, he could protect his master!

After all, the treasures in his hands could easily kill two or three first level divine emperors.

If he returned directly to his divine kingdom, then the treasures in his body would be useless.

Therefore, before he came, invincible had decided not to take any risks. He would cower if he could!

“Junior brother, you are too cowardly. How long are you planning to cower? You need to hone your combat skills!”

The senior brothers and sisters beside him also looked at him speechlessly.

“Ahem, this isn’t cowardice. I’m planning to hone my combat skills after I become invincible.”

Invincible battle technique was thick-skinned and said shamelessly.

The three senior brothers and sisters were speechless. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Master, let’s familiarize ourselves with this place and go to the battlefield to temper ourselves!”

The three of them said to the god-emperor of Shangshui.

“Okay!”

Only then did the god-emperor of Shangshui reveal a satisfied expression.

“TSK TSK, this battlefield is really too cruel. Send some messages to boss Wang, the Old Man of Heaven Formation, Mo Sha Ba Qi, and the other Big Brothers. Let them know how dangerous it is for me to be here.”

As invincible battle technique spoke, he took out the communication stone plate that was specially used to communicate with Wang Xian and the rest. Immediately, he started filming ahead.

After filming, he started to edit the messages and sent them to Wang Xian and the rest.

Hence, invincible battle technique spent the next few days taking photos and videos whenever he had nothing to do.

Later on, he even filmed a bunch of people shouting about how dangerous it was here and how invincible battle technique was fighting bravely.

Especially when they sent a video to tianxin, it was even more exaggerated.

This made many people in the third Legion recognize this coward, invincible in battle techniques.

“Wow, boss Wang, you don’t know. This place is simply too tragic. On the fifth day, my master has already gone to the battlefield and is currently fighting with a rank one divine emperor demonic beast. The entire battlefield is too tragic!”

“Boss Wang, Look, there are many wounded soldiers here…”

Invincible battle technique stood at the front battle platform, filming all kinds of videos.

Finally, when he saw that someone was injured, he even filmed others for a while.

“You… you shut up. How can the deputy commander have such a cowardly disciple like you? Your Senior Brothers and sisters all know to enter the battlefield to fight, but you, a coward, don’t dare to film here and there!”

The injured soldier couldn’t help but curse at invincible battle technique.

“Cough cough, this brother, your words are a bit harsh. I’m not from your glazed domain.”

Invincible battle technique saw the injured soldier rebuke him and coughed. He raised his head and said.

“You…”

The soldier was somewhat speechless.

The other party wasn’t from the glazed domain, what else could he say?

“Fourth, fifth, and sixth battle groups, Attack!”

At this time, an order sounded in the air in front of them.

“Get lost!”

A slightly cold voice sounded from the back.

Invincible battle method turned his head and saw a middle-aged man staring at him coldly. He raised his middle finger and immediately made a path for him.

“Damn it, even my father is dead. I Am the disciple of your deputy commander and a man with the Dragon Palace backing me up. How Dare You Scold Me? I Will F * ck you in the future!”

Invincible battle technique looked at that figure and muttered.

“Sigh, why do I feel that the battle has become more and more intense these few days? Only the third Legion has suffered more than 20 million casualties.”

Invincible battle technique looked at the battlefield and frowned slightly. He had a bad premonition.

He touched the treasure in his arms and felt at ease.

“Hu!”

Five hours later, God Emperor Shangshui flew over and wiped the blood off his body.

“Master, Are You Alright?”

Invincible battle technique immediately ran over, took out a cup of water and asked.

“I’m fine. It’s the blood of that God Emperor Yao Xie.”

God Emperor Shangshui nodded.

“Master, eldest senior brother’s third junior brother is in danger. He was besieged by Yao Xie and forced to return to his own divine kingdom.”

At this moment, second senior sister flew over and said to the god Emperor of Shangshui.

“En!”

The god Emperor of Shangshui nodded and looked at the battlefield in front of him with a slightly solemn expression.

“Vice commander, Our First Battle Group’s commander has fallen!”

At this moment, a soldier flew over and reported to the god Emperor of Shangshui.

“Let the vice commander take the top position.”

The god Emperor of Shangshui frowned and said.

The leader of the battle group was a peak divine king expert. The battle now was getting more and more intense.

“Oh my God!”

Invincible battle method muttered when he heard this.

He patted his chest. Fortunately, he did not go over. Otherwise, even if he had a dragon weapon, he would not be able to withstand it.

The following battle was still extremely intense.

Invincible battle method’s expression also became more and more solemn.

Around him, soldiers with serious injuries were bandaging their wounds.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Third Legion, apart from the injured, all attack!”

Suddenly, terrifying roars sounded from the void in front of them.

Invincible and the others could see huge demon caves flying towards them.

Countless demonic beasts flew out and let out terrifying roars.

Those two roars were at the divine emperor level.

“The First Army, attack except for the injured!”

“The Second Army, attack except for the injured!”

“The Fourth Army, attack except for the injured!”

At this moment, voices came from the surrounding area.

This made everyone’s expression change slightly.

“Boom!”

Invincible battle technique frowned as he saw his master charging into the battlefield.

“The situation is a little bad!”

Invincible battle technique muttered as he frowned!

“My master can’t Die!”
