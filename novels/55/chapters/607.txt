Chapter 608: Annihilate The Dragon Sect. Unification Of The Underworld

“Dragon King!”

Roving Sword approached and descended into Wang Xian’s Mt. Refining. When Wang Xian saw Roving Sword, he revealed a smile.

“How many more days are left until the grand contest of Yong Chang world begins?” Wang Xian asked Roving Sword.

“We have about four more days!” answered Roving Sword.

“Four days? It’s been approximately one and a half months since we arrived in this world. When the grand contest ends, we will return after entering the Yong Chang Cauldron!” Wang Xian hesitated for a moment before answering.

“Dragon King, I’ve found the region where we came in from previously. If we break the spirit array of that region, we will be able to get out. However, we will suffer the attacks of the spirit array!”

Roving Sword had not forgotten Wang Xian’s instructions from before as he reported to Wang Xian.

“With our strength, it shouldn’t be a problem for us to get out. How many more units of dragon energy are you still lacking?” Wang Xian stared at Roving Sword.

“Reporting, Dragon King. I’m still lacking approximately thirty-three million units of dragon energy. With my current cultivation pace, I would require roughly ten years. If I can enter that Yong Chang cauldron, I should be able to shorten the time required substantially!” answered Roving Sword.

“Let me increase your strength to Level 13 first!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered, and he moved his arm and dense streams of dragon energy entered Roving Sword’s body directly.

“Thank you, Dragon King!”

Roving Sword sat on the floor right away to digest the dragon energy from Wang Xian.

Transferring dragon energy was an easy task for Wang Xian. Moreover, it was easy for Roving Sword to absorb.

Dang!

Weng!

At this moment, razor-sharp swords appeared around Roving Sword suddenly.

Eh?

Wang Xian looked with astonishment at the illusory longswords hovering around Roving Sword.

These longswords weren’t made of metal. Instead, they were exceptionally unique longswords that seemed to possess a special characteristic.

Five longswords circled around him slowly. When Wang Xian sensed Roving Sword growing stronger rapidly, he felt more assured.

Looking at the Level 11 longsword in his hand, Wang Xian hesitated for some time and decided to refine a Level 12 spiritual sword for him.

At the same time, Wang Xian was prepared to refine some pieces of spiritual equipment for himself. At the very least, he would want a spiritual sword.

With sufficient materials and having leveled up to Level 9, refining Level 12 spiritual equipment was an easy task for Wang Xian.

Soon, two Level 12 spiritual swords were refined.

Looking at the two swords, Wang Xian’s eyebrows knitted together.

Would it be possible to craft a dragon sword? To embed the dragon balls within and refine a five-elemental spiritual sword?

Or perhaps I could refine the set of dragon balls into spiritual equipment?

Wang Xian thought about it.

With his current strength, he was only capable of refining Level 12 spiritual equipment. If he wished to refine Level 13 spiritual equipment, he would have to dabble in spirit arrays. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The Arts of Water Refining of Da Hong Immortal Sect had no records on Level 13 spiritual equipment.

When spiritual equipment reached Level 13, it could be called Immortal Treasure.

The truncheon that Adjaya had should be an Immortal Treasure-class weapon.

Previously, Adjaya had relied on her Immortal Treasure to stand her ground against Budding Realm experts despite not having any other Budding Realm experts.

The Dragon Balls were, in fact, spiritual equipment. Wang Xian was rather unique as he was a five elements divine dragon. He could create five different Dragon Balls.

If he could use five different Dragon Balls at the same time, embedding them onto spiritual equipment would be a great decision.

I can embed them into five different swords or make them into a crown!

Wang Xian raised an eyebrow. At the thought of the crown that Adjaya was wearing, a smile appeared on his face.

With a thought, he looked across through the materials kept within through space rings.

At this juncture, the amount of materials within the space ring was astronomical. Level 10 materials could be considered the most common!

There was quite a large amount of Level 12 material too.

Golden Crown Metal: Level 12

Yellowstone Water: Level 12

Frozen Wood: Level 12

Fire Key Stone: Level 12

Yellow Spiritual Earth: Level 12

Five types of materials of metal, wood, water, fire and earth attribute. It’s enough to refine a crown. However, I only have Wood Dragon Ball, Water Dragon Ball and Fire Dragon Ball at this moment. I’m still missing Earth Dragon Ball and Metal Dragon Ball!

Wang Xian thought to himself. However, it didn’t really matter. He just had to collect two other elemental dragon balls in the future.

The crown he was going to refine was just going to be in its preliminary form!

Just as Roving Sword was advancing to Level 13 and Wang Xian was refining spiritual equipment, ten figures stood in the air at one corner of Yong Chang world.

Two figures standing in the middle were blurry and had immense energy.

The two figures emitted fiery-red light that was of a different shade than ordinary fire. Their flames had a tinge of holiness.

Around then, a group of people stood behind the two figures deferentially.

“Remember what we have instructed you to do!”

A figure spoke to the crowd.

“Yes, Great Fire God. We assure you that we will build a powerful information network in preparation for Yong Chang world descending into the outside world!”

Two familiar figures reported respectfully to the two illusory figures.

Emperor Qi from Diabolism and Nie Wushuang, the Sect Leader of Dong Hua Sacred Sect.

The seemingly invincible duo in the Underworld was now standing deferentially behind the two illusory figures.

“Hmm. We will send four other guys with you. As long as it is regarding the establishment of an information network, they will listen to your instructions. Both of you have to establish an all-knowing information group in the shortest time!” one of the two illusory figures added.

“Yes, we will definitely complete it!” Emperor Qi and Nie Wushuang gave their guarantee instantly.

“Alright, we will send you guys out now!”

The two illusory figures nodded their heads and raised their palms.

Both of them wore red spiritual gloves and expanded instantly at this juncture.

The immense energy from the two pairs of huge five-meter palms shocked Emperor Qi and Nie Wushuang.

Ka ka ka!

A crack easily ripped apart the sky.

“Get out now!” the two illusory figures shouted.

Emperor Qi and Nie Wushuang didn’t dare to hesitate a moment. They moved and headed towards the other piece of sky instantly.

Beside them, four old men followed closely.

Crack crack crack!

Explosions reverberated from the space as Emperor Qi and Nie Wushuang left the area. The sounds of these explosions sent chills down the spines of those who heard them.

The previous time, they had almost died from the attacks of the spirit array. If the immortals had not intervened, they would have been dead by now.

“We are back!”

The duo looked at the familiar sky and excitement beamed in their eyes.

Huashan was below them and they were ten thousand meters above in the sky.

The duo pondered for a long time before meeting the eyes of each other.

“The alliance of orthodox sects and Diabolism shall work together to build a powerful information network!” Nie Wushuang said solemnly.

“Alright!”

Emperor Qi nodded his head, looked before him and remarked, “I wonder if the Dragon King and the middle-aged man are dead?”

“They must be dead. Even if they are dead, the Dragon Sect still exists!”

“We can’t keep the Dragon Sect!”

“In that case, let’s annihilate the Dragon Sect first to unite the Underworld.”

The duo was emotionless and flew away, leaving a trail of light.

Behind them, the four old men followed closely!
