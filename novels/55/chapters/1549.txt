Chapter 1550: 1550 souls of darkness

What happened at the banquet of the Crown Prince of Wuqing City today would definitely cause a stir in the entire vast region.

The name of priest Wang would definitely spread across the entire vast region.

A young man above a heaven’s pride would rise up strongly.

However, just as many people were discussing Wang Xian, he was currently staying on the roof of the courtyard where Ling Jian ‘er was staying. He was quietly comprehending the situation where light and darkness intersected.

The trip to the banquet today made him feel extremely helpless. Ling Jian ‘er didn’t like him at all. She might even hate him a little.

This gave him a headache!

He thought that he was a graceful and peerless handsome man. Why was it so difficult to deal with Ling Jian ‘er?

“Junior sister Jian ‘er, don’t come into contact with priest Wang in the future. That fellow has offended solipsistic sect. He will definitely become a dead man in the future. I Can’t let him drag you down!”

After about two hours, a voice came from the courtyard.

Wang Xian leaned against the shadow on the roof and looked down.

“I know, senior brother. I’m going to cultivate!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Alright, Alright. Junior sister, rest early!”

Bing Jinghuan walked Ling Jian ‘er to the door and waved at him before leaving.

Ling Jian ‘ER opened the door and entered the room.

“If not for Jian ‘er forgetting her feelings now and you being her senior brother, I would have killed you long ago!”

Wang Xian, who was on the roof, heard Bing Jinghuan speak ill of him. His eyes revealed a hint of coldness as he muttered.

“Huh?”

He looked down and realized that Ling Jian ‘er was not cultivating immediately. Instead, she was sitting in front of the table with a statue in her hand. She was observing her quietly.

“Is it useful?”

Wang Xian revealed a hint of joy on his face. However, it didn’t take long before Ling Jian ‘er sat cross-legged on the bed and continued to cultivate.

Wang Xian scanned the room and continued to comprehend the blending of light and darkness.

The next morning, he placed two statues at Ling Jian ‘ER’s door as usual. He looked at them with a smile on his face.

Creak

Not long after, the door opened and Ling Jian ‘er, who was dressed in golden clothes, walked out.

When she saw the statue that appeared at her door every day, her eyes lit up and she picked it up.

She looked at her statue and then looked at the statue of the young man. After a moment of hesitation, she placed them all into her interspatial ring.

In the next two days, the events that happened on the day the Crown Prince of Wuqing City held a banquet shook the entire ruins of the divine kingdom.

Priest Wang and Wang Xian, these two names shocked everyone.

Above the heaven’s pride, there was an invincible youth!

Even the crown prince of Wuqing City said that in front of him, he was trash!

One could imagine how powerful and terrifying that priest Wang would be.

This incident, coupled with the fact that Wang Xian had cured nearly 100,000 people for free in the past, made him famous. He even gained quite a number of supporters.

Some people even stated that they wanted to follow priest Wang.

Of course, there were also some people who thought that this priest Wang was too arrogant. Only my sect would not let him off.

The entire ruins of the divine kingdom was in an uproar.

However, Wang Xian did not take all of this to heart. He turned into a peeping devil and followed around Ling Jian ‘ER.

When he had nothing to do, he would study the blending of light and darkness.

“This won’t do. Currently, the power of the light and dark dragon bead is too weak. Once it enters the Tai Chi diagram formed by the heart of Light and darkness, it will melt directly. It Won’t be able to move. I need to raise the level of the light and dark divine dragon bead!”

In a corner of Ling Jian ‘ER’s courtyard, Wang Xian looked at the location of his heart and pondered in his heart.

He was prepared to transform the heart of darkness into the appearance of the Taiji diagram. He would use two intelligent light and dark divine dragons to operate the Taiji diagram to prevent the light and dark from being out of balance.

Once he succeeded, he would complete the fusion of light and dark.

However, he realized that the power of the light and dark dragon bead was not enough to affect the entire Taiji diagram. He needed to upgrade the level.

“To upgrade the level of the light and dark dragon pearls, I need a large number of light and dark pearls. Moreover, I need high-level ones. This is a little troublesome!”

Wang Xian frowned slightly.

The light and dark pearls were originally considered very precious items. Currently, the light and dark dragon pearls in his hands belonged to the seventh level of the Seethrough realm.

The seventh level of the Seethrough realm was considered very high. In order to upgrade the level, he needed at least 20 to 30 light and dark pearls of the seventh level of the Seethrough realm.

It was very difficult to obtain so many pearls of light and darkness. Perhaps only the existence of the three superpowers would be able to take out 20 to 30 pearls in one go.

“Princess Bing Jian ‘er, the ninth prince and the rest are waiting for you outside!”

At this moment, a voice came from the side. Wang Xian looked over and a maid said to Ling Jian ‘ER.

“Are we leaving? I’ll Head Over Now!”

Ling Jian ‘er nodded. She sheathed the long sword in her hand and walked out.

“Is the black curtain garden about to open?”

Wang Xian followed behind her with his eyes flickering.

The black curtain garden was an entrance to the medicinal garden in the ruins of the divine kingdom. Experts above level four of the profound void tier were prohibited from entering, including those at level four of the profound void tier.

There were large amounts of spirit herbs in the black curtain garden. Even the lowest grade spirit herbs were at least at transcendent tier 8 or 9. There were even many spirit herbs at profound void tier.

There were even spirit herbs at profound void tier 7 or 8.

However, there were large amounts of darkness souls in the black curtain garden.

Especially those precious spirit herbs. They had darkness souls protecting them. If one wanted to pick the spirit herbs, they had to destroy the darkness souls protecting them.

The Black Curtain Garden opened once every hundred years. Every time it opened, it was a grand event for the entire vast region.

It was also a massacre!

Wang Xian followed behind Ling Jian ‘er and walked out.

If Ling Jian ‘er wanted to enter the black curtain garden, he had to guard the surroundings.

Although the black curtain garden limited the realms of the people who entered, the extremely powerful soul of darkness, who had lived for thousands of years and was a level three void interpretation expert, was also a dangerous place for Ling Jian ‘ER.

“Junior sister Jian ‘er, Our Ice Heart Empire has sent more than 500 experts into the black curtain garden this time. Among them, there are 200 insightful void realm experts!”

“When the time comes, we will follow the strongest team and hope to return with a full load!”

Seeing Ling Jian ‘er walking over, Bing Jinghuan went up to her with a smile and said to her.

“We will listen to senior brother’s arrangements!”

Ling Jian ‘er nodded her head!

“Alright, let’s go. We will head to the interior of the Kingdom of God’s ruins first. Our people are already waiting there!”

Bing Jinghuan smiled and nodded his head. He followed the group of people and flew towards the interior of the Kingdom of God’s ruins.

Wang Xian followed behind and looked ahead. He looked at the gigantic statue and the dark area in front of him.

This was Wang Xian’s first time stepping into the Kingdom of God’s ruins.

In the sky, there were many people flying towards the ruins of the Kingdom of God. Among them, there were hundreds of experts at the insightful void level.

The opening of the black curtain garden had affected all the forces in the entire vast region.

Even third-rate forces or even unrated forces would send people over.

This was because this was the ruins of the Kingdom of God. It was an area left behind by a demigod who wanted to build his kingdom of God!
