Chapter 641: Merman

Everyone has to surrender!

Thinking back to the times when Huaxia was in its most glorious days, they had swept through vast lands easily. [1] What had they relied on to subdue the masses within the four seas? [2]

Peerless experts and the powerful and prosperous Immortal Sects and army!

When the nine cauldrons stabilized the nation’s fortune, all the tribes and dynasties within Asia had to pay pilgrimage to them!

The Underworld in the past was incomparably powerful and prosperous. It was only when experts from various Immortal Sects privatized the nine cauldrons for their vested interests that the fortune of the nation started to dissipate, eventually leading to the decline of the nation!

Although the times had changed, the malicious and amoral Immortal Sects beyond the region would definitely be extinguished.

The fifteen disciples from Xia Cauldron looked across the group of people with contempt.

In their eyes, they were the only rulers.

“There’s someone by the name of the Dragon King that has appeared in the Underworld. Rumor has it that he’s a demon-like talent and that he vanquished countless experts of the Underworld. It’s a shame that we aren’t aware of his current location!”

A lady played with the mobile phone in her hands with great interest while speaking with a smile.

“If we happen to meet him, we can make him our subordinate and instruct him to do as we wish!” another young man standing by the side joked.

“This Dragon King is indeed a talent in the Underworld. At this moment, the entire Underworld sees him as their ruler. If we could subdue him, he would be greatly useful to us!”

“That’s completely pointless. Looking at the current Underworld, I could have slaughtered all the martial artists in the Underworld myself!”

“He’s just an ordinary man who has been enshrined as a legendary person. If we really encounter him, he would at most be at the Budding Realm. He might not even be a match for me. We wouldn’t have much use for him!”

The group was conversing and commenting on the current Underworld with a sense of superiority!

Wang Xian glanced across the people before him before entering the trading grounds ahead of him.

The entire trading grounds only had roughly fifty to sixty stalls. Besides these stalls, some people had laid their items on the ground for sale.

Wang Xian looked around him and saw weapons, spiritual grass, the flesh of the underwater Manta Rays, and many other things with prices indicated clearly.

These items would be really precious if brought to the Underworld. However, they weren’t of high value to Wang Xian.

While Wang Xian led Mo Qinglong and the rest around each store, the surrounding people were also observing the group.

Some of them squinted their eyes and light flashed across their eyes. No one knew what they were thinking about.

“The Lord of the disordered region is here!”

“The people from Heavenly Spirits are here too!”

“The leaders and heads of various prominent Wandering Groups are here! I wonder what kinds of treasures there are this time?”

At this moment, raucous discussions could be heard from the surroundings.

Wang Xian turned around and looked to the entrance. Various martial artists emitting brutal and powerful aura were walking in his direction without any emotions on their faces.

The first group of roughly thirty people had a myriad of tattoos on their faces, making them look exceptionally hideous and frightening.

Among the group of thirty people, there were a dozen-odd Inborn level experts. They were led by an old man with a tattoo of a devil on his face.

Budding Realm expert!

Several emaciated dwarves followed closely behind. Although they were at most seventy to eighty centimeters tall, the aura emanating from them made it impossible for anyone to belittle them!

All of them were carrying black truncheons or black samurai swords.

Among them, two of them were carrying a cage covered in black cloth. No one could tell what was inside it. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Behind this group, various experts from various groups were also entering the trading grounds.

The groups of people could be easily differentiated. Judging from the auras they were emanating, none of them would be pushovers!

“Quite a number of people are here today!”

The old man with a devil tattoo on his face looked eerily across everyone around him. When he saw the foreign faces of Wang Xian and his group, he commented plainly.

“Get the trade started as soon as possible. I, your mother, still have things to handle.”

Just as the old man finished his words, a rather plump lady with a pitch-black poisonous snake in her hands remarked impatiently.

The moment she completed her remarks, she waved her arm and the boxes in the hands of the middle-aged men behind her opened directly.

“Pure blood corals, cubs of Manta Rays, the blood of Inborn experts... Is there anyone who wishes to make a trade? We are looking to exchange these for treasures and spiritual stones!”

“Hehe! Decisive! Buying pure blood corals and teeth of a Dan Realm Manta Ray with spiritual stones!”

“Devil’s Blood Pill, three pieces of spiritual equipment...”

Various Wandering Groups took out their treasures and laid them out on the ground

Those who were around started moving towards the stall gradually with their eyes fixed fervently on various treasures.

“Although the items available for trade are great, they are similar to the past. Our Heavenly Spirits has brought something great today!”

An emaciated old dwarf looked across the crowd like a sinister snake. He smiled creepily before continuing, “Let’s start the trade with what I have!”

Swish!

As he spoke, he waved his arm and sent the cage behind him onto a platform in the center.

“If it isn’t something great, don’t waste our time!”

The old man with a devil tattoo on his face remarked plainly.

“Hehe! You will know once you see it!”

The old dwarf moved his arm and the black cloth was flipped aside, revealing the contents of the cage.

Huh?

“This is...?”

The surrounding crowd was astonished and had their eyes locked intensely on the creature in the cage.

“Is this a merman?” an old man with a strange outfit exclaimed in surprise after seeing what was in the cage.

“That’s right. This is a merman we caught alive by chance!” the dwarf answered with a smile.

“A merman? This isn’t even a beautiful mermaid. What’s the use of getting it?” a middle-aged man asked with contempt.

“Its skin is a great treasure. While wearing it, one can swim freely under the water. Why don’t you tell us what use it would have? Hehehe!” the dwarf stared at the middle-aged man and answered in a creepy tone.

Huh?

The explanation from the old dwarf instantly aroused the interest of the crowd.

Even Level 10 spiritual equipment wouldn’t allow them to swim freely under the water.

“What are you looking to exchange it for?” the plump lady who spoke at the beginning asked with her eyes beaming with excitement.

“Blood! The fresh blood of Manta Rays or Inborn experts!”

The old dwarf licked his lips as he spoke.

“Merman?”

Wang Xian, who had just been standing by the side as a spectator, was astonished to see the items being put up for trade in the center of the trading grounds.

A merman was a marine creature that had existed in the myths. He had not expected that he’d encounter one in this place today.

However, the surrounding crowd didn’t seem to be as surprised. It would appear that they had seen countless other strange and unique creatures from the sea.

“We are taking this merman!”

At this moment, a voice reverberated throughout the crowd.

A dozen-odd people entered the trading grounds. The surrounding crowd stared harshly at them as they squeezed past them forcefully.

However, members of various Wandering Groups paled upon sensing the terrifying auras being emitted by the two young men standing at the edge of the group. They instantly moved aside and opened up a path.

“What an unexpected encounter! I would have never expected myself to find a merman today. Moreover, it’s a merman who has not awakened. This is really uncommon!”

The old man in the middle of this group stared fervently at the merman on the center stage with his eyes beaming with excitement.
