“Anyone who wants to form a team to enter the abyss, looking for a teammate who is good at defense, preferably of the Earth attribute!”

“Anyone who wants to enter the Abyss Desert River together, look after each other and distribute them according to their work!”

“I heard that Head Instructor Horizon Killed A Level 6 undying godly monarch abyss species. TSK TSK, how impressive!”

As soon as he entered the abyss continent, all sorts of lively voices could be heard. Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the surroundings as his eyes sparkled!

It was completely different from the atmosphere in the southern star system. The people here treated the abyss as a training ground for killing monsters. Some of them even formed teams to enter!

“World’s end sect!”

Wang Xian noticed a name and muttered to himself!

A sect was a form of address for first-rate forces and above. first-rate forces and above were not limited to celestial empire, sects, or sword sects. They were directly referred to as a sect!

The so-called sect leader and elders of great sects were not comparable to sects like the divine dynasty in terms of power and prestige!

The Imperial Star Lady once said that the people who chased after Qing Yue and Lingxiu were people from the world end great sect!

“Such a great sect has a level nine immortal king or even a peak immortal king. It is not something that the current Dragon Palace can afford to provoke!”

Wang Xian mumbled as his eyes sparkled. He found someone to ask about the biggest shop in the Abyss continent and flew straight to the center!

In the Abyss continent, fighting and killing were prohibited. The entire continent was under the control of the Beichuan sect, and they were also in charge of public security!

The Beichuan sect was a first-rate force with a level 8 immortal king guarding it!

Soon, Wang Xian flew to a city in the center of the continent. His gaze swept across the surroundings and landed on the Bei Chuan Market!

The bei Chuan Market was a store set up by the Bei Chuan sect to collect pills, weapons, and even the crystals of the abyss seeds. The entire store was huge!

“Senior, may I know what you wish to buy?”

A female attendant walked over and asked Wang Xian!

“I want to sell the abyss seed Crystal, the level seven Abyss Seed Crystal of the Immortal King!”

Wang Xian said directly to the attendant!

“Level seven abyss seed Crystal of the Immortal King?”

The attendant was shocked and nodded immediately!

“Senior, please follow me to a private room in the back. I will call our person-in-charge over immediately!”

The waiter said immediately!

Wang Xian nodded and led ao Qitian and the rest into the room!

The waiter poured the tea respectfully and walked towards the back!

“Senior, are you selling the level seven abyss seed crystals of the Immortal King?”

Soon, a lady followed the waiter into the room!

The lady had short hair and her snow-white clothes were covered with layers of small ice and snow. She looked valiant and valiant. She looked at Wang Xian and asked!

Wang Xian looked at the lady and raised his eyebrows slightly. A hint of surprise flashed across his eyes!

A strong and special physique!

“I have quite a number of abyss seed crystals in my hands. All of them have been replaced with elixirs. Do you have enough elixirs here?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and asked!

“Oh? How many do you have, senior? Can you tell me?”

When the lady heard Wang Xian’s words, she asked!

“Five level seven abyss seeds of the immortal king level and seven to eight hundred of the Immortal King Level!”

Wang Xian spoke directly!

“That much?”

The Lady revealed a look of surprise. She pondered for a moment and said, “We can’t take out so many pills here. However, senior, you can wait for a few hours. We will transfer them from other planets!”

“What’s the price?”

Wang Xian asked!

“Senior, the price of the abyss seed crystal is very transparent. It is also very easy to sell it. The price will be the divine stones that the abyss seed crystal is worth in exchange for the pills. What do you think?”

The Lady said!

“Sure. Give me the pills that you can take out first. As long as they are pills, it doesn’t matter whether they are effective or not!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and took out two level seven abyss seeds of the Immortal King!

“Go and bring the equivalent pills over. Also, inform the shopkeeper to contact the sect and ask them to transfer more pills over!”

The woman instructed the waiter beside her!

“Yes, Miss!”

The waiter nodded his head!

“It’s extraordinary that seniors can get so many abyss seeds. If there are any abyss seeds that can come to our north stream market in the future, we can give you a discount!”

The woman sat at the side and said to Wang Xian!

“Sure!”

Wang Xian nodded. He looked at the woman and raised his eyebrows slightly!

...

“Senior, what are you doing?”

The woman saw Wang Xian sizing her up. She frowned slightly and said!

“I don’t understand. Your physique is so strong. Why are you only at the peak of the Eternal Lord Realm? You shouldn’t be young anymore!”

Wang Xian could not help but ask!

This lady had the strongest physique he had ever seen since he came to this resplendent world. Even her invincible combat techniques were far inferior to her!

The lady’s physique was the ice body of origin, a variation of the water attribute!

This physique was much stronger than the origin physique!

The Divine Dragon Clan once had a variation of the attribute physique. It was extremely compatible with her and hence gave birth to the name of the Frost Divine Dragon!

The Frost Divine Dragon was a powerful divine dragon that could fight against the bone dragon!

According to his senses, the lady in front of him was already tens of thousands of years old. She was already at the peak of the god Lord Realm at the age of tens of thousands of years old. This was considered pretty good in this starry sky!

However, to Wang Xian, this didn’t seem right. She should be at level eight or nine of the Immortal King Realm!

...

“Eh? Senior, you noticed it too?”

The woman was visibly moved. She stretched out her hand and the illusory ice law on it changed!

However, she soon shook her head bitterly and spat out two words, “There is no door to cultivation!”

There was no door to cultivation. Due to her physique, she was once the most outstanding heaven’s favorite in this starry sky. Even the children of the big sects were suppressed by her. Even the disciples of the core region of the imperial court were at a disadvantage!

Her talent, even attracted the attention of the imperial court warriors, but in the end, a warrior said everywhere, after eternity, there was no door to cultivation!

Just saying that there was no door to cultivation, it almost cut off her path of cultivation!

Back then she was very unwilling, but when her strength reached the pinnacle of the Eternal God Lord, she finally understood these four words!

The Eternal God Lord wanted to break through to the undying god King level, he needed to solidify the laws, she couldn’t do that!

To cultivate, one must have a cultivation method and direction. Every force had the other nine attribute cultivation methods. All they needed to do was to follow the path of their predecessors!

However, she did not have a path to take. She had stayed in this realm for more than 20,000 years. Even if she had a deep understanding of frost, she could not take that step!

“Is there no path to cultivate?”

Wang Xian looked at her shaking her head bitterly and raised his eyebrows slightly! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

One attribute led to another path. Many predecessors had already walked down this path, so it was easy for the future generations to walk down this path!

Frost was a mutated physique. As it was due to one’s physique, it was impossible for one to cultivate other attributes. One could only walk this path!
