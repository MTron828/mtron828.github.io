Chapter 480: All Of These Are Mine? (2)

All it would take was a thought from him and the girl would explode from within.

This was a rather terrifying thing as he had indirectly gained control of her.

The transmission through the hexa-star is really incredible. I wonder what kind of Spirit Array it used for the direct transfer of energy through the hexa-star!

Looking at the hexa-star on his own chest, Wang Xian then turned to the girl before him.

He patted the girl on her shoulders lightly and woke her up.

“Hmm! I...”

The girl turned around, still feeling a little drowsy. The next moment, she checked on her body and instantly turned away in horror.”

“I only did so because I’m out of options!”

Wang Xian shrugged his shoulders and covered his body in flames.

The girl moved away from him and a small fire flashed in her eyes. When she looked at Wang Xian again, her face turned red rapidly. She turned around and her heart was palpitating violently.

“Greetings, master!”

At this moment, the growl of the fire demon woke the confused girl. The fire demon went down on a knee and greeted her respectfully.

The girl regained her senses and looked to the fire demon. “You may get up now!”

“Yes, master!”

The fire demon stood up and remained stationary.

She felt the changes in her body and was completely astonished.

“There’s nothing else I can do. I believe you will know the consequences if you choose to remove the hexa-star. I’m just going with what I can. Speaking of which, I have saved your life!”

Wang Xian shrugged his shoulders and spoke with a smile.

“What are your plans now?” the girl took a deep breath and asked while still shivering a little.

“Nothing? I’m only here to seek treasures. Now that you have inherited the position of the Fire God, I’m fine with all the treasures!” Wang Xian said heartily.

With regard to this girl, he really did not have many feelings. Naturally, he was excluding natural instincts.

Other than these natural urges, he didn’t even know the name or the age of the girl. There was no way he could develop romantic feelings for her.

It wasn’t that he was against it. It was just that he wouldn’t make it past Lan Qingyue and Guan Shuqing.

Now that Sun Lingxiu was staying with them, Lan Qingyue and Guan Shuqing could tell his relationship with her clearly.

This matter wasn’t settled yet. If he was to get involved in other matters, his harem would be in real turmoil.

The girl was taken aback by Wang Xian’s words and shock was written all over her face.

She waved her arms and lava flowed out from the surface to envelope her. Looking at Wang Xian, she took a deep breath.

“I have to take away the Fire God’s Secret Book, the Holy Water Scripture and the Holy Water Vial. As for the rest, you can have them. What do you think?”

“Let me make a copy of the Fire God’s Secret Book!” Wang Xian nodded his head and answered.

The main reason he was here was for the fire attribute cultivation arts.

Moreover, Wang Xian was curious about the Fire God’s Secret Book. The secret book of the Fire God would definitely have incredible battle techniques and attacking moves. He was eyeing it closely.

“Only I can view the Fire God’s Secret Book. Others are not allowed,” the girl said to Wang Xian.

“Huh? What about the Holy Water Scripture then?”

Wang Xian raised an eyebrow.

“The Holy Water Scripture is a secret long held by my clan and will never be disclosed to outsiders!” The girl looked a little bitter as she continued, “As for the other treasures, you can have them all.”

“This... Let me see what treasures are around first!”

Wang Xian didn’t agree. Looking at the fire demon at the side, he walked towards the throne.

The girl glowered at Wang Xian before conversing with the fire demon.

Wang Xian moved his arm and a shield flew into his hands from the side of the throne.

Colored Glass Shield: Level 12

“Even a Level 12 shield was placed casually. Fire God Hephaestus was a really powerful blacksmith,” Wang Xian sighed.

He turned around and looked at the girl. “Oh right! Where is the Fire God’s Art of Weapon Refining?”

“It’s in the Fire God’s Secret Book!”

The girl lifted her head, looked at him and answered coldly.

“Explain the Art of Weapon Refining to me,” Wang Xian replied with a smile.

After which, his attention turned to the location directly above him.

At that place, there was a branch burning. Looking at this branch had jolted his memories of the Progenitor Tree and Soul Returning Branch in the Dragon Palace.

This branch is constantly burning and seems to have endless flames!

Wang Xian stared at the branch and information appeared in his mind.

[Boundless Branch: Level ???]

Boundless Branch! It’s another unique tree branch!

Wang Xian was shocked and reached out to grab it.

Weng!

A unique energy welled up in his body and the Boundless Branch flew into it to his astonishment.

Wang Xian didn’t attempt to stop it. As the Boundless Branch entered his body, it disappeared instantly.

In the Dragon Palace a far distance away.

Above the dragon throne, the jade green Progenitor Tree started swaying a little. The Soul Returning Branch shifted slightly and another branch grew beside it.

This branch was emitting a weak and faint flame.

Weng!

The entire Dragon Palace seemed to have experienced some changes. The Fire Divine Dragon head on one of the nine pillars beside the Dragon Transformation Pool lit up.

Following which, the entire Fire Divine Dragon glowed faintly and appeared as vivid as it could on the pillar.

Wang Xian wasn’t aware of the changes to the Dragon Palace. As he felt the branch disappearing in his body, he had some understanding in mind.

Progenitor Tree.

The Progenitor Tree once grew in his body and had since seen him as its master. This branch was similar to the Soul Returning Branch and must not have been growing on the Progenitor Tree.

At the thought of how incredibly strong the Soul Returning Branch was, this Boundless Branch would definitely be terrifyingly incredible.

Wang Xian continued to look around and gather the treasures together enthusiastically.

There were over fifty Inborn Spiritual Weapon or even stronger weapons together with a ton of spiritual-grade metal. The materials required for upgrading the Dragon King Hall to Level 2 were a ton of spiritual-grade metal and ten thousand spiritual stones. Now he had finally gathered the metal required!

The Dragon Field required a thousand Inborn Spiritual Weapons. There should be approximately one to two hundred Inborn Spiritual Weapons in the entire Fire God Palace!

Wang Xian was exhilarated. He looked towards the side hall and his lips curved into a smile.

“All these are mine!”

Wang Xian looked towards the middle of the main hall and found the girl and the fire demon lowering the spiritual cabinet into the depths of the lava. They were sending off the Fire God.

“This... Pretty.” Wang Xian didn’t know how to address her as he looked at her. He smiled and continued, “Can I trouble you to bring all the treasures from the other eight side halls to this place? At the same time, please instruct the fire demons to help me kill a few people!”

Huh?

When the girl heard his request, she lifted her head, looked at him for a moment and nodded her head.

“Great. Kill all the people from the Nether Flame. Thank you!” Wang Xian chuckled, moved to the girl and thanked her by clasping his right fist with his left palm.

Tsk!

The girl seemed a little angry as she turned around and ordered the fire demon to start the purge.

This was the Fire God Palace and the territory of the Fire God.

Now that the Fire God Palace had a new master, those intruders should now be kicked out from the place.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com
