2711 2711’s terrifying parasitism

“This is the Abyss where the imperial court meets the Cold Night Island. This is also the edge of the Abyss.”

Wang Xian and all the members of the drug manufacturing department stood in front of the Abyss and looked at the place in front of them.

There were very few people here. There were also fewer species of Abyss. There was no one within a radius of a few hundred million kilometers.

Wang Xian did not tell the empress or bei Shuang about his visit this time.

“Dragon King, you are looking down on our drug manufacturing department. We should start our attack from this remote place.”

Mo Sha scanned the surroundings and said.

“Aren’t you clear about the strength of the drug manufacturing department?” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian looked at him indifferently.

“Keke, Dragon King, at the very least, we are stronger than AO Yecha and his patrol department. Ao Yecha is the one who is in trouble.”

Ba Qi laughed at the side.

It was the opportunity for the drug manufacturing department to rise up. Ba Qi and Mo Sha naturally hoped that the drug manufacturing department could rise up quickly.

“At the moment, safety is the priority. How much you can rise up next is up to you. There are still 8,000 more people in the Dragon Palace of the poisonous horned dragon seed.”

Wang Xian smiled and said to them.

“Ao Yao, you guys go and check out the surrounding situation.”

He looked to the side and continued.

This time, Wang Xian brought along three immortal king level 9 spiky dragons. Ao Yao was among them.

The main reason why he brought Ao Yao and the rest was to help the demonic fiend to check out the location of the abyssal seed. This would allow them to safely carry out their first parasitism.

As long as the parasitism was successful, Ao Yao and the others would not need to ask about the rest of the matters.

Once they succeeded in their first parasitism, they could completely become abyssal seeds and blend in with other abyssal seeds. They could take advantage of their unprepared state to hunt.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao and his two subordinates nodded and immediately entered the abyss.

The thorned dragon seed was not suitable to carry out individual assassinations in the abyss because the abyssal races gathered in groups. Ao Yao and the others were suitable for individual assassinations and were not suitable for this kind of group battle.

Due to the fact that this place was relatively remote, it was tens of trillions of kilometers away from the position of the Empress.

It would take a few days to fly. Ao Yao and the rest only returned after five hours of investigation.

“Dragon King, we have discovered an abyss species at a distance of over a billion kilometers. There are a total of over 100,000 abyss species. There are three of the strongest undying godly monarch level 8 species.”

Ao Yao immediately reported to Wang Xian.

“There are no other Abyss races nearby, right?”

Ba Qi asked.

“No, we have already checked. If we make a move, we won’t attract other Abyss races.”

Ao Yao said.

“Then what are we waiting for? My minions, prepare to set off.”

Ba Qi’s eyes lit up as he shouted.

“Remember, when you head to a place, send a message and meet once every half a month.”

“Be careful. Also, pay attention to the human powerhouses who went into the abyss to hunt.”

Wang Xian took the communication stone plate in his hand and said to them.

“It’s the Dragon King.”

Mo Sha and the rest nodded.

The communication stone plate was specially made by the Heaven Array. It could communicate in the abyss.

Both parties who had the communication stone plate had to be in the abyss. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to communicate.

They would meet once every half a month to exchange the abyss seeds they harvested for medicinal pills at the imperial court.

After that, Wang Xian could use the medicinal pills to help mo sha and the rest improve their strength.

“Let’s go, let’s go. Everyone, don’t embarrass me. This is a great opportunity for our poison making department to rise up.”

Ba Qi roared and took the lead to fly into the abyss.

Ao Yao and the rest took him to the location of the group of Abyss seeds.

Wang Xian did not go over. He stood in front of the Abyss and closed his eyes.

Just now, he had placed a stream of energy on Ao Yao’s body so that he could temporarily see the situation on their side.

There were not many meteorites in this remote abyss. There were also many things to hide.

There were not many active abyssal seeds either.

The group flew for twenty minutes and arrived at the gathering place of the abyssal seeds.

It was a huge meteorite the size of a star. There were many holes in the star.

“It’s in here. You guys go in and hunt. We will help you guard the surroundings.”

Ao Yao said to fiend eight qi and the rest.

“Alright, leave the rest to us. Little Ones, pay attention to me. Leave one parasite and kill the rest.”

...

Eight Qi roared and ordered his subordinates.

“Yes!”

All of them immediately replied.

“Poison Nine, Big Brother will help you get rid of that undying level 8 abyss seed. When the time comes, you can take it as a parasite.”

Mo Sha said to poison nine, his body moving as he entered the meteorite.

“Paralysis, dizziness, confusion!”

Mo sha and eight Qi entered and immediately unleashed their poison dragon attacks.

The Poison Dragon was just like its name, its entire body was filled with poison.

As long as the poison was strong enough, it would be terrifying in a group battle.

Of course, if the poison was weak, it would be useless.

However with the eight Qi Mo Sha’s strength, killing the strongest undying level 8 race was a piece of cake.

...

10 minutes later, a group of Abyss species walked over from the meteorite.

“Damn, I’m parasitic on this abyss species, I can only unleash the strength of an undying emperor level 8, the moment my energy exceeds that, this body will self destruct.”

Among the three abyss species in the center, one of them sized up his own body and cursed.

“This is too much, after being parasitic, one’s strength will be restricted to the host’s true body.”

An abyss seed beside them also said.

The two of them were the eight-limbed demon and the eight-limbed demon.

They were very dissatisfied after parasitizing.

“Eight-limbed demon, did you get any information after parasitizing?”

Ao Yao immediately flew over and asked them.

“There is some information. These abyss seeds are very stupid. They only know how to kill.”

The eight-headed abyss species shook its head. “However, according to the abyss species that I parasitized, there is an order in my mind. The Emperor ordered them to expand the Abyss and invade the Imperial Court.”

“Is there any other information?”

Ao Yao continued to ask.

“There is another order. All Abyss species are not allowed to kill each other. All races must cooperate with each other to fight against humans.”

Ba Qi continued.

“HM!”

Ao Yao nodded, “You guys can act on your own here, we’ll be leaving first.”

As he spoke, he brought his two underlings and immediately flew out of the abyss.

“Hehe, all abyss species are not allowed to kill each other, from their Emperor’s information, that Emperor must be a god emperor level abyss species.”

“This order is perfect for us, even though it can only unleash an undying emperor level 8 strength after parasitizing, it’s more convenient to sneak attack an undying emperor level 9 abyss seed.”

Ba Qi and Mo Sha looked at each other, smiling sinisterly.

“Little ones, let’s go, we’ll hunt the abyss seeds.”

“Also, all of You Better Act well, don’t let the other abyss seeds be wary, even though those beasts are very stupid.”
