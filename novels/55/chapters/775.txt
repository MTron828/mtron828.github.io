The disciple competition officially began!

The disciples of the Xuan Yuan clan stepped out and proudly announced that the Xuan Yuan clan was the strongest existence among all the immortal sects.

This was a display of the immortal sects and also a strong confidence.

The competition itself was a declaration of the strength of the immortal sects, so the disciples of the Xuan Yuan clan did not keep a low profile. They proudly glanced at all the disciples of the immortal sects around them.

A few immortal gods and disciples of the Xuanyuan clan looked at Xuanyuan Hao with smiles on their faces.

Xuanyuan Hao, who was the first to appear, was definitely not ordinary. For a time, no one came to challenge him.

“If there aren’t any, I’ll take one of the twenty-one spots!”

The corner of Xuanyuan Hao’s mouth slightly curled up as he announced confidently.

“Xuanyuan Hao is the most outstanding disciple besides Xuanyuan Fengyi. He has the strength of an infant realm cultivator and has two grade-12 spirit weapons. His strength is very terrifying!”

“Xuanyuan Hao dared to come out for the first time. He must have great confidence and strength. His strength is comparable to some seeded disciples of the immortal sects!”

The surrounding disciples of the immortal sects discussed in a low voice.

“This person is really arrogant. are all the disciples of the immortal sects so arrogant?”

Xiao Yu looked at Xuanyuan Hao below and curled her lips as she said.

“He is showing off the strength of the Xuanyuan clan. At this moment, the disciples are outstanding and represent the immortal sects!”

Wang Xian said lightly with a smile.

No one from the Xuan Yuan clan accepted the challenge. Next, a disciple from the Yuwen clan also went up. No one accepted the challenge.

“Eh, Xiao Xian, look. This disciple from the Wild Beast Immortal sect looks like a wild beast!”

The third person who went up was a disciple from the wild beast clan. He was extremely tall and sturdy. He was about three meters tall and exuded a ferocious aura.

Wang Xian looked over and narrowed his eyes slightly. “There are two immortal gods in the Wild Beasts Immortal sect. Both of them are spirit beasts. The strongest golden lion can speak human language and has the strength of a Superior Immortal!”

“The disciples of the Wild Beasts Immortal sect are not only humans, but also Spirit Beasts!”

“It’s really magical!”

Lan Qingyue and the other girls exclaimed in surprise.

Even when the disciples of the Wild Beasts Immortal sect entered the arena, no one dared to accept the challenge.

“Disciple of the Holy Doctor Immortal sect, Bian Poisonous Dragon, come and challenge me!”

After the disciples of the Wild Beast Immortal sect left the arena, a young man flew out from the direction of the Holy Doctor Immortal sect. He was holding a black scepter in his hand.

On the head of the scepter was the head of a black poisonous snake. It looked sinister and terrifying!

He stood on the arena and scanned his surroundings. Finally, he suddenly looked in the direction of the Dragon Gate. The corner of his mouth curled up slightly as he asked arrogantly.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows when he saw the young man’s gaze.

“Is there anyone who wants to challenge me?”

The young man’s gaze was still fixed on the Dragon Gate’s platform. He raised his head slightly and his eyes were filled with a cold expression. He raised his voice and shouted.

“This is?”

All the other disciples of the immortal sect were slightly stunned. Even the immortal gods were smiling as they watched this scene.

The Immortal Gods were the chess players, and the disciples of the immortal sects were the chess pieces.

With the relationship between the Holy Medicine Immortal sect and the Dragon Sect, the immortal gods’Chess Pieces moved.

Naturally, they wanted to use the chess pieces to embarrass the Dragon sect.

“Why didn’t the Dragon sect have any disciples participate in this competition? The Dragon sect should have disciples under the age of forty, and their strength has reached the infant realm!”

“Maybe they think that their disciples are not strong enough. There is still a big gap between the battle strength of the infant realm. The Dragon sect has only been established for a few years. No matter how powerful the Dragon King is, he can’t be compared with the Holy Medicine Immortal Sect and the Holy Medicine Immortal Sect!”

“I didn’t expect the Holy Medicine Immortal sect and the Dragon Gate to have a conflict. These two immortal sects have more than a thousand years of foundation. This flatpoison dragon poison wood technique is very terrifying. I feel that among the 21 disciples who won in the end, he is definitely one of them!”

“If the Dragon Gate doesn’t have any disciples, it will be a little embarrassing!”

The surrounding disciples of the immortal sect looked at the Flatpoison Dragon who was staring at the Dragon Gate and started to discuss.

“Let me have a taste of brother Bian Du Long!”

At this moment, a young man flew out from the Natural Born Immortal sect and landed on the arena, staring at Bian Du Long!

“Eh?”

When the surrounding disciples saw the natural born immortal sect’s disciple making a move, they were also slightly stunned, and their faces revealed a look of surprise and doubt.

“Are you courting death?”

Bian du long saw a disciple from the natural born immortal sect making a move to destroy the arena, and a cold expression appeared on his face.

“My hands are itchy, so I made a move once!”

The young man said to Bian Du long indifferently. At the same time, he was sending a message that they, the innate immortal sect, would only make a move once.

This was a message to the Holy Medicine Immortal sect and the Holy Doctor Immortal sect. At the same time, it was also a message to Wang Xian.

The innate immortal sect was cooperating with the Dragon sect. Making a move once could be considered to be doing their best!

“If you don’t know what’s good for you, Don’t blame me for being Merciless!”

The cold-faced young man moved and attacked.

With a wave of his arm, the terrifying black poisonous wood instantly grew crazily under his feet. The poisonous wood was filled with sharp thorns and contained a terrifying poison!

The young man from the innate immortal sect had a solemn expression. Similarly, the green trees around him also grew.

The first battle began!

“Peng!”

“Brother, that fellow is too arrogant. He is clearly provoking us. I will teach him a good lesson!”

At this moment, Xiao Yu slapped the chair and stood up with an angry expression.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes and said, “Sit down, Xiao Yu. Even if you were to make a move, you don’t have to make a move. Moreover, if you were to make a move, it wouldn’t be as simple as teaching him a lesson!”

He looked towards the positions of the Holy Medicine sect and the Holy Doctor sect. He met the cold and mocking expressions of the six celestials of the green-robed elder and the rest.

The Disciples of the Holy Medicine Immortal sect also looked over with their heads held high.

Wang Xian smiled and knocked on the chair indifferently.

“Ah, I admit defeat!”

At this moment, a scream came from below.

The face of the young man from the innate immortal sect turned black. Black blood spewed from the corner of his mouth as he shouted in fear. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“HMPH, you dare to challenge me? You Don’t know Death!”

The pitch-black thorn in the flat poison dragon’s hand swung heavily towards the young man. The powerful force caused him to fly backwards as he spoke with a face full of disdain.

“Peng!”

An innate immortal sect elder finished off the young man with an embarrassed expression.

“What a Killjoy!”

The young man held the black poisonous snake scepter in his hand as he spoke with disdain. His gaze directly turned towards the direction of the Dragon Gate.

“Originally, I wanted to challenge the disciples of the Dragon Gate, but in the end, I actually became a coward. Hehe, Disciples of the Dragon Gate, you are welcome to fight at any time. Hahaha, Our Holy Medicine Immortal Gate and the Holy Doctor Immortal Gate will accept all of them!”

The flat poison dragon laughed loudly and flew directly in the direction of his immortal gate.

“Hehe, Dragon King, since you are here, don’t be a spectator. Come out and play. Can’t you be a disciple?”

At this moment, an indifferent voice filled the entire battleground. At the position of the Holy Medicine Immortal Sect, an immortal said with slight mockery.

Everyone was shocked and held their breaths as they looked over!

“Play? Haha, Alright. Tomorrow, the life-and-death battle between the young disciples of the sect, can you accept it?”

Wang Xian looked over with a smile. A trace of coldness flashed in his eyes as he asked indifferently.

“Our Holy Medicine Immortal sect and Holy Doctor Immortal sect have been around for a thousand years. Why would we be afraid of a newly established Dragon Sect? Haha!”

The Immortals from Holy Doctor Immortal sect and Holy Medicine Immortal sect laughed maniacally as they spoke loudly.

Their voices spread across a radius of dozens of kilometers!

This was the confidence of the two immortal sects that had been around for a thousand years!
