Chapter 336: Insignificant Being! Scram!

At this moment, the surrounding crowd started whispering. Medical Saint Sect was one of the three strongest Sacred Sects. Every action of theirs could draw the attention of the crowd.

Although most of the people here were from powerful forces, few could match the Medical Saint Sect.

Wang Xian heard the old man. He frowned, lifted the cup by his side and took a sip.

“Aren’t there seats right there?” he replied coldly.

Hehe!

The young man laughed upon hearing Wang Xian. He ignored Wang Xian and looked to Sun Lingxiu who was beside Wang Xian.

“I believe this beautiful lady must be the Holy Goddess, Miracle Doctor Sun. I have long heard of your name but I’m still surprised to finally get to see you. You are indeed deserving of the Goddess title!” The young man extended his hand, smiled and greeted, “I’m Bian Yaoquan from the Medical Saint Sect!”

“He’s Bian Yaoquan? He’s the core disciple of the Bian Branch of Medical Saint Sect and has a high chance of becoming the successor of the Sect Leader of the Medical Saint Sect!”

“The Hua Family and Bian Family of the Medical Saint Sect don’t have many descendants. However, every single one of them is part of the core or a member of the higher management of the Medical Saint Sect!”

“Hehe! It appears that even the core disciples of the Medical Saint Sect couldn’t resist the charm of Miracle Doctor Sun. The name of Holy Goddess is indeed apt!”

When the surrounding crowd heard the young man’s introduction, they began whispering softly among themselves.

Sun Lingxiu lifted her head and looked coldly at the young man. She then looked towards Wang Xian.

There was an old man with lots of scars on his face beside Bian Yaoquan. At this moment, he revealed a horrifying smile.

“You aren’t qualified to sit here!” said the old man emotionlessly to Wang Xian. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Who’s that young man?”

When the crowd heard the Poison Duo, they looked towards where Wang Xian was.

Wang Xian had a young face and many people did not recognize him.

Only a few people frowned and sank into deep thought after looking at Wang Xian.

“Oh?” Coldness gleamed in Wang Xian’s eyes. The young man and two old men in front of them were incomparably imperious.

“Who is qualified then?” Wang Xian asked emotionlessly while tapping lightly on Zhan Lu with his finger.

“A brat like you is indeed not qualified!” the old man with lots of scars said plainly. Waving his hand slightly, a faint gas shrouded towards Wang Xian.

“Ugly old man, keep your small tricks away!”

At this moment, a faint blood figure flashed across Wang Xian and the voice of Miracle Doctor Blood Man resounded throughout the entire tent.

Huh?

Huh?

Two displeased voices sounded. One was from Bian Yaoquan. Seeing that Sun Lingxiu had completely ignored him, he was annoyed. As for Wang Xian, he wasn’t paying attention to him at all. The Poison Duo would settle him.

The second voice came from the old man with lots of scars. When he saw Miracle Doctor Blood Man move, he frowned.

“That is Miracle Doctor Blood Man, a famous Miracle Doctor in Europe. He is now following the Holy Goddess, Miracle Doctor Sun, and sees her as his master!”

“That young man must be... He must be that Miracle Doctor from Rivertown.”

“They actually dared to go against the Medical Saint Sect. That’s not a wise decision!”

When the surrounding crowd witnessed the developments, they were all shocked.

“Scram! Bring your men along and get lost!” Sun Lingxiu’s expression turned cold immediately after seeing that ugly old man attacking Wang Xian with intoxicating poison.

Even if others had attacked her, she wouldn’t be this furious.

In her heart, Wang Xian was someone that couldn’t be offended. No one was allowed to do so.

A flash of light gleamed in her eyes as she stared harshly at Bian Yaoquan.

Sss!

The surrounding crowd gasped upon hearing Sun Lingxiu. They had not expected the Holy Goddess to chide the people from the Medical Saint Sect.

“YOU...”

When he heard Sun Lingxiu’s emotionless remarks, Bian Yaoquan instantly felt embarrassed.

He had been courteous to her and yet she chided him and demanded that he leave!

Bian Yaoquan was really embarrassed and furious to be chided by someone he was fond of in front of the public.

“Die!”

When the Poison Duo heard Sun Lingxiu, their expressions changed as they turned around and glowered at Sun Lingxiu.

“Scram! Is there something freaking wrong with your hearing? Acting all high and mighty when you have just arrived. Which mother f*cker raised you? You guys even attacked others with poison! Bastards, are you courting death!?”

Sensing the two old men staring coldly at his master, Miracle Doctor Blood Man slammed his fists on the table heavily, stood up immediately and went on the offensive verbally with a string of vulgarities in English.

He was in a tuxedo and looked just like a gentleman. However, what he said greatly contrasted his appearance.

Rumble!

The moment Miracle Doctor Blood Man finished his words, the Poison Duo turned green from anger. Horrifying aura started being emitted from them.

“What? You guys want a fight? Hehe! This is going to be interesting!”

Sensing the two old men releasing their aura, Miracle Doctor Blood Man stared at them coldly. Blood mist circulated around him.

“Everyone, please don’t start a fight here!”

At this moment, a voice broke the standoff. The middle-aged man in a military uniform walked out and warned them.

“Hey, did you see what they have done. This ugly old man attacked us with poison. How presumptuous of them! They must be treating this as their backyard!”

Hearing the middle-aged man, Miracle Doctor Blood Man released his bloody aura, pointing at the old man with lots of scars as he spoke.

The Poison Duo felt their eyebrows twitching a little as they stared intensely at Miracle Doctor Blood Man with dense killing intent.

“What right do you have to sit here?” Bian Yaoquan looked furiously at Wang Xian and asked plainly.

“He’s the ninth rank on the Miracle Doctors Chart, Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown! He’s also the youngest of the Miracle Doctors!”

At this moment, the voice of Poison Doc, Yan She, sounded from a corner. He was playing with the poisonous snake in his hand as he made the remark in a light-hearted tone.

When Bian Yaoquan heard him, he was taken aback and started feeling embarrassed.

“Bian Yaoquan?”

Wang Xian lifted his head, looked at the young man and said, “What are you then? You are just an insignificant being. You might have your parents giving in to you in Medical Saint Sect, but you are in the outside world now. Who’s going to give in to you? Questioning me? Just get lost!” Wang Xian chided.

The surrounding crowd looked at Bian Yaoquan with ridicule.

There were lots of people here who were from Sacred Sect. Even if they weren’t from Sacred Sects, they were Inborn experts.

They might fear the Medical Saint Sect, but if they were afraid of a disciple from the Medical Saint Sect, they would have let down their efforts to reach the Inborn Realm.

“Haha, rascal! Take a look around you. Who dares to act cool if he doesn’t have the strength to back it. Take a look at yourself. Among those that are seated, who is a second-generation good-for-nothing? All of them are here because of their strength. The one who isn’t qualified here is you!” Miracle Doctor Blood Man mocked coldly.

“YOU...”

Bian Yaoquan’s eyes were bloodshot as he stared furiously at Wang Xian and Miracle Doctor Blood Man.

This was the first time his parents had let him out to experience the outside world. Yet... Yet...

“I’m a Level 3 Alchemist! Just wait and see!”
