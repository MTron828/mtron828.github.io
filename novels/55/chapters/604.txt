Chapter 605: Immortal Realm

“Elder Wang, this will be the Exlir Mountain exclusive to you for refining your equipment and elixir pills from now on. On the left is a spiritual medicine garden, and material storage is on the right. There are five disciples in the mountain to do your bidding!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Five elders brought Wang Xian to a mountain.

The mountain was hundreds of meters tall, and it was not that lofty. But the surrounding environment was not something Mt. Fengyu could compare to.

There was no waterfall, and the surrounding was hushed. On the mountain was planted dawn redwood that could refresh the mind.

This type of dawn redwood belonged to Level 2 Spiritual Trees. With Spiritual Trees spreading across the entire mountain, one could imagine how precious this mountain was.

“How is it, Elder Wang? This mountain is one of our best few peaks within Da Hong Immortal Sect!”

The Great Elder chuckled. “Here, follow us to check out your alchemy and blacksmith room!”

The room was located in the middle of the mountain. It was not a house or building but hollowed out from the mountain.

Upon entering, Wang Xian’s attention was drawn to something in the middle.

Five Spiritual Liquid Balls were suspended in the air, emitting white radiance.

“These are Scarlet Liquid Balls which were once Immortal-class treasures of Da Hong Immortal Sect. When five Scarlet Liquid Balls gathered together, they could support Elder Wang refining Level 12 Spiritual Equipment and Level 7 elixir pills. Given your talent, you could become a Grand Master in no time!” said Great Elder to Wang Xian slowly.

“Five Level 12 Scarlet Liquid Balls!”

There was radiance flickering in Wang Xian’s eyes.

Scarlet Liquid Balls could help to coagulate extreme high-temperature water, they were the best auxiliary Spiritual Equipment for the Art of Water Refining.

Five Scarlet Liquid Balls were connected by an array such that Wang Xian could make use of it to refine Level 12 Spiritual Equipment and Level 7 elixir pills.

“Over here is the place where you can rest. I heard that you like to drink spiritual tea, so I got the disciples to pluck some for you!” said Elder Mu to Wang Xian with a smile.

“Thank you, elders!”

Wang Xian was very pleased with the environment. This place was not something that small shop in Yong Chang City could compare to.

This place was absolutely the sacred grounds of refining equipment and elixir pills.

“Let the disciples help you with the carrying of the materials. Elder Wang, we shall leave you to your rest. If you need anything, you can just find any of the five of us!”

The Great Elder waved a dismissal hand to Wang Xian and left after finishing his words.

Wang Xian cupped his fists at them and studied the surroundings with a satisfying look.

“I’ll advance to Level 9 within five days!”

Wang Xian took a deep breath with glistening eyes. With a soft yell, he said, “Men!”

“Yes, Elder Wang. Is there anything for us to do?”

Immediately, five disciples went to Wang Xian with respect and admiration in their eyes.

“Bring the material over, and bring more. I’ll begin to refine elixir pills!”

Wang Xian looked at the five Scarlet Liquid Balls as he instructed them.

“Yes, Elder!”

The five of them immediately went to retrieve the Spiritual Grass for refining the pills.

Om!

Wang Xian stood before the forging table and swung his arm while fixing his eyes on the five Scarlet Liquid Balls.

A hot Water Veil appeared while Wang Xian revealed a satisfied look.

“Elder Wang, here’s the material!”

Five disciples brought hundreds of portions of materials over, leaving them by the side.

Wang Xian waved them off as he entered into the state of refining elixir pills.

...

“Elder Wang is really obsessed with pills and equipment. It’s been almost five days, and I heard the disciples saying his refining period is not less than twenty-three hours per day!”

“Crazy speed in refining elixir pills. He could refine thousands of elixir pills in a day. That’s madness. He alone could beat all the alchemists of Immortal Sects in terms of speed!”

“At this rate, all the Spiritual Grass of Da Hong Immortal Sect would not sustain his refinery for half a month!”

“I’d guess all the Spiritual Grass and the refining materials of Da Hong Immortal Sect could only last him for a month. But this should be good news for us. Good news!”

“That’s right!”

On the mountain next to Wang Xian, the five elders wanted to pay him a visit. They revealed a shocked look on their faces after hearing the reports from the five disciples.

Seeing his frantic rate of refining elixir pills, the fact that Wang Xian was an alchemy and blacksmith master was no longer horrifying.

“It’s almost time!”

After Wang Xian was done with refining four elixir pills, he squinted his eyes as he looked outside.

In the middle of the night, Wang Xian walked out of the cave and came to the summit.

The dawn redwood was exuding a sapphire glow that beautified the surrounding environment.

Wang Xian took out elixir pills one by one and popped them into his mouth while smiling.

[Ding! Taken Level 6 elixir pills, 111239 Dragon Energy extracted!]

[Ding! Taken Level 6 elixir pills, 112098 Dragon Energy extracted!]

.....

Wang Xian closed his eyes while the system notification continued to ring in his mind.

[Ding! 112045 Dragon Energy taken, level up to Level 9!]

Ka Ka Ka!

Wang Xian opened his eyes as a virtual shadow of a Divine Dragon flashed across his eyes.

His body let out a bone-cracking sound as he released a daunting aura from his body.

Roar!

A low bellow was heard with a five-colored divine dragon slowly circling around his body.

“Level 9 Divine Dragon!” Wang Xian gently said.

“The strength is multiple folds stronger than before. Is this the power of the Immortal Realm?”

Wang Xian’s eyes were gleaming as he felt that he could sustain twenty minutes of Great Waterfall Water Shockwave after casting it.

On top of that, the area that Great Waterfall Water Shockwave could encompass hit a radius of ten kilometers.

A ten-kilometers radius was a rather scary range.

That was equivalent to brewing a storm on rivers and seas.

“Not even the modern heat weapons, including nuclear weapons, could injure me. Given my speed, I could travel to Yong Chang Immortal Sect from here within a minute. My speed is five times the speed of sound!”

Wang Xian looked up. With a thought, his figure instantly appeared ten thousand meters above in the air.

Wang Xian brought a smile to his face as he overlooked the entire Yong Chang world.

“This place could no longer bind me. I’m fearless against Immortals of this world!”

“Haha!”

Wang Xian chuckled loudly. With a shift, he landed on the mountain again instantly.

“Make me a cup of tea!”

Wang Xian drew his lips slightly as he shouted below.

“Hur? Yes, Elder!”

A disciple who was on vigil hurriedly nodded as he immediately made a cup of spiritual tea.

“Elder, it’s done!”

“Mm!”

Wang Xian went back to his room, picked up the hot spiritual tea and sipped it.

“Elder, the three Immortal Sects are selecting ten disciples to enter Yong Chang cauldron tomorrow. Do you want to take a look?”

At this time, the disciple who was keeping watch at night asked Wang Xian with slight hesitation.
