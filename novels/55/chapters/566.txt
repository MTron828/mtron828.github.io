Chapter 567: The Two Shocked Girls (1)

Water has a temperature limit, but the temperature will rise when oil is added.

Everything melts in the form of water.

“The Art of Water Refining has great demand for strength and energy!”

Wang Xian looked at the melting Bo Yu sword as he revealed a smile.

The usual blacksmith master with Art of Water Refining would require an immense amount of energy to melt Bo Yu sword slowly. This could probably take up to an hour or two.

Even so, many water-refining blacksmith masters required spiritual objects like a Spiritual Liquid Ball to support the work.

But not Wang Xian. His Origin Source of water and the system worked like plugins.

Bo Yu sword is as light as a feather that slices with sharpness. However, there’s a drawback to its hardness. If the hardness of the sword can be enhanced, this sword will become a Level 12 Spiritual Sword!

Wang Xian pondered to himself with a relaxed expression.

Given his current strength, it was an easy job for him to refine a Level 11 weapon using Art of Water Refining.

“Dismantle!”

“Melt!”

“Combine!”

...

Wang Xian went according to the tip of the Art of Water Refining and began the repair.

Art of Water Refining had a significant disadvantage as it could only solidify melted metal once. That is to say, the performance of the metal might be reduced if it is repeatedly dissolved and refined.

Based on this characteristic, the success rate of Art of Water Refining was far lower than the Art of Inferno Refining.

However, this did not pose a problem to Wang Xian either.

This was because the Origin Source Water was able to keep the metal properties despite repeatedly dissolving it.

Just like how he’d done while refining the elixir pills, the Origin Source Flame could ensure that the effectiveness of the pills remained.

Wang Xian did not know if this was because of the system or the Origin Source Water. In any case, it was sick.

“Done!”

Within five minutes, the Bo Yu sword was completely fixed.

Wang Xian exhibited a smile and looked at the remaining materials.

The remaining material was of a palm-size and weighed about a kilogram or so.

Obviously, it was not enough to refine another short sword.

“Since that girl is rich, why don’t I...!”

Radiance flickered in Wang Xian’s eyes as he smiled while looking at the remaining material.

“I can make some thin weapons like hidden weapons. That would make this a real Bo Yu sword.”

Wang Xian looked at the hilt.

The hilt was not made of Bing Yi Metal, but larderite stones that were Level 11 material, and it was smaller than the average hilts.

Wang Xian looked at the hilt and drew his lips slightly. Immediately, he dug out six layers on the hilt with Art of Water Refining.

Every layer was so thin that it could only fit a piece of paper.

Wang Xian took out the remaining Bing Yi Metal and began to forge Bo Yu swords. However, the six Bo Yu swords did not have any hilts and were over ten times smaller than the girl’s Bo Yu sword.

Each one of them was only the size of two fingers, yet the sharpness and grade were not any lower than the original Bo Yu.

Soon, the six mini, hilt-less Bo Yu swords appeared in the hands of Wang Xian.

“Next, I’ll make it a set, and the mini Bo Yu swords can return to the sword when triggered.”

In the records of Art of Water Refining, not only did a suit have a low-grade connection of energy like the Devil Wings and Devil Shadow Masks made by Wang Xian, but also a spiritual connection.

Spirituality could be understood as the magnetic field in modern terms.

This is the principle of magnetic attraction.

Art of Water Refining called it the Spiritual Complement, which was more troublesome.

“It looks like it will take another ten minutes!”

Wang Xian pondered, but he was not bothered by it as he continued with his craft.

...

“Ten minutes is up, why isn’t that guy coming down?”

At this time, the young girl looked at the timer on her wrist and remarked impatiently downstairs.

The girl furrowed her brows slightly. “It’s been ten minutes already. Obviously, he can’t fix Bo Yu!”

“If he can’t fix it, why did he say ten minutes? Is he playing games with us? The more I see this shop, the more I feel it’s unreliable!”

The young girl scanned around and noticed that there were no valuable items around. Suspiciously, she speculated, “Sister Xue, do you think this shop is a scam? Even though your Bo Yu is damaged, its value is still quite high!”

The girl’s eyebrows locked even more tightly upon hearing the young girl’s comments. With a flash of blue radiance, she immediately went upstairs to check it out.

“He’s still here!” said the girl with relief.

“This is odd. Why would a master stay in such a rundown shop?”

The young girl pouted as she complained.

“Hur?” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

However, what the young girl had just said stunned her. Slowly, her expression darkened. She immediately went upstairs again with flickering blue radiance on her body.

There was only one person around. She was certain about it.

Be it the second or the third story, there was only one young man around.

The expression on the girl’s face gradually turned awful.

“What’s wrong, Sister Xue?”

Sensing something wrong with her, the young girl quickly asked her this.

“There’s only a young man in the entire shop and no one else!” the girl replied with a sullen face.

“HUR? What do you mean?” The girl was confused, but subsequently, she jumped. “Sister Xue, are you saying that there’s only a lad over here, and no other masters around?”

“Yes, I don’t sense the presence of other people. Unless...” The girl darkened her expression with flickering radiance in her eyes. “Unless he’s the blacksmith master!”

“He’s a blacksmith master? How is this possible? How old is he? All the masters have to be deeply involved in the field of blacksmith and alchemy for decades and centuries. Even the most talented alchemy master, Ou Ziming, could only forge Level 10 Spiritual Weapons at the age of forty!”

The young girl spoke at the top of her lungs.

Alchemy and blacksmith were not easy subjects to master. It was way more complicated than cultivation.

As the most skilled sect among the three Immortal Sects, the most outstanding blacksmith of Yong Chang Immortal Sect could only forge Level 10 Spiritual Weapons at age forty.

Even so, he was known to be the future blacksmith master, the blacksmith genius of Yong Chang Immortal Sect of the last thousand years. It was possible for him to reach the realm of a Grand Master too.

But how old was that lad? He might just be over his twenties.

“This is an unscrupulous shop. It must be!”

The young girl was furious. On her little face, her long lashes were fluttering in anger.

Clang!

She drew out an exquisite belt sword immediately. “Sister Xue, let’s go. We’ll go up and teach this unscrupulous owner a lesson. How dare he cheat us? Doesn’t he know our names in Yong Chang City?”

The girl showed some hesitation before she nodded her head slowly.

Bo Yu sword was a sword she had been carrying around since she started her cultivation. It was extremely important to her.

She did not think that the lad in the shop, who was in his twenties, could be a blacksmith master.
