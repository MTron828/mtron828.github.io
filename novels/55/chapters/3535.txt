3536 3535 was easily destroyed

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

When the Hundred Cities Alliance Master activated all the array formations on the hundred cities peak, the one hundred and eight mountains immediately began to tremble.

An illusion flew out from each mountain peak.

These illusions slowly solidified and formed a terrifying mountain peak.

On each mountain peak, there was a connate numinous treasure!

At this moment, the aura emitted from it was abnormally terrifying!

The virtual image of the largest mountain peak in the center immediately arrived below Hundred City Alliance Master.

He stood there, looking extremely terrifying!

“Hiss, what a terrifying aura! I feel that any mountain peak can crush us!”

A great being with the Combat Power of a universe ruler at level one felt the terrifying 108 mountains, and his face was filled with shock. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Our Alliance master is so strong!”

“This is the place that our alliance master has been managing for billions of years. Here, Our Alliance Master can fight against two to three people of the same level!”

The experts of the Hundred Cities Alliance watched this scene with excitement!

“Die, Hahaha!”

The Alliance Master of the Hundred Cities Alliance roared. He waved the staff in his hand and numerous huge mountains charged toward Wang Xian and the Dragon Palace Army.

“Destroy these mountains!”

Wang Xian let out a low roar. He flapped his incipient saint wings and attacked the mountains directly.

Compared to the previous mountains, this time around, it was even more terrifying because they were in a formation!

Wang Xian’s attack power was about the same as those of the same level. It would be a little troublesome for him to destroy them!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

At the side, Ao Qitian ao crab, Lei Ming, let out a low roar and attacked the mountains.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

They let out a wild roar and immediately transformed into gigantic demon monkeys, devouring dragons, and Lightning Dragons!

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

At this moment, Wang Xian had already arrived in front of the mountains and punched them.

The mountain peaks formed by the formation were blasted apart!

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

At the same time, the ghost avatar immediately took away the innate numinous treasure on the mountain peaks!

The three innate numinous treasures were immediately obtained!

“Roar!”

At this moment, ao Qitian’s thunderous ao crab also rushed over.

This time, ao crab was not included in the elevation of the Dragon Palace’s experts.

Ao crab had devoured the Divine Kingdom of a level three universe dominator. The speed of his breakthrough had exceeded Wang Xian’s expectations!

Ao crab’s current realm had already reached the level of a universe dominator. Unfortunately, due to the dragon seed, he could only fight two levels higher.

However, this was not important. What was important was that ao Crab’s strength was also a level three universe dominator.

They rushed over and immediately bombarded the mountain peaks.

“Hong!”

In an instant, the mountain peaks were immediately destroyed. They stretched out their hands and grabbed at the connate numinous treasure.

“What!”

The instant ao crab, Ao Qitian, Lei Ming, and the others attacked, Alliance Master Bai Cheng’s face revealed a shocked expression.

The aura of a universe ruler at level three.

There were actually three universe rulers with level 3 combat power in the Dragon Palace!

“Damn it, no wonder they dared to invade my hundred city peak. It turns out that they have a powerful backer. Four universe rulers with level 3 combat power. Even if there are four of them, I will leave all of you here today!”

Hundred City Alliance Leader’s eyes were a little blood-red. The black dragon scales on his chest were slowly cracking, revealing blood-red eyes!

“There are actually four masters of the universe with level three combat strength in the Dragon Palace?”

“Hiss, how terrifying. However, our alliance leader still seems to be very confident!”

When everyone heard the alliance leader’s words and felt the aura of Ao Qitian and the rest, shock appeared on their faces!

Fortunately, their alliance leader was still full of confidence!

“Hehe, you are very confident. Do you also have experts? Helpers from the Holy Dragon Lineage?”

Wang Xian stared at the Bai Cheng Alliance leader with a mocking look in his eyes.

He was still so confident even after revealing the combat strength of four universe overlords. It seemed that the Bai Cheng Alliance leader had really obtained a powerful trump card!

“Helpers? I can destroy all of you by myself!”

The Bai Cheng Alliance leader roared with a cold expression. Each of his blood-red eyes stared at Wang Xian with a violent aura in them!

“Is that so? Haha!”

Wang Xian laughed out loud. His figure flashed and he charged straight at the leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance.

“Attack him and destroy this fellow!”

When the red-eyed man saw Wang Xian charging towards them, he immediately shouted out loud.

More than 30 masters of the universe with level two combat strength did not hesitate and charged straight at Wang Xian!

“You’re courting death!”

“Is Our Dragon King also someone you can attack?”

King of water touch, who was lying on Wang Xian’s shoulder, said indifferently. She moved her body and attacked the experts of the Hundred Cities Alliance!

“Water Explosion!”

She growled and water balls suddenly appeared around the universe Dominators in front of her.

The water balls exploded instantly!

“Ahhhhh!”

In an instant, more than a hundred masters of the universe with the combat strength of a master were instantly killed by the Water Touch King!

“What!”

At this moment, the sudden attack of the Water Touch King stunned the Alliance Master of Bai City!

This attack, this terrifying attack!

There was even a master of the universe with the combat strength of a level three master?

How was this possible?

Fog Grass!

This…

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian chuckled and charged at the Hundred Cities Alliance leader at a terrifying speed.

“Haha, a bunch of Trash, lackeys!”

King aqua tentacle laughed maniacally and roared with a face full of killing intent.

In her opinion, the Hundred Cities Alliance was a lackey of the Holy Dragon lineage.

And the Holy Dragon lineage was a lackey of the angel race.

Lackeys of lackeys, die!

“Not good, this is a demon beast with level three combat strength of a universe overlord. Alliance master, Save Us!”

At this moment, the expressions of the universe overlords of the Hundred Cities Alliance changed drastically.

There were also universe overlords with level three combat strength?

There were a total of five of them?

Save Them?

When Hundred Cities Alliance master saw this scene, his body trembled!

He controlled the array formation to fight against the three universe overlords with level three combat strength outside the Dragon Palace.

He also had to fight against Wang Xian who was charging at him!

This was already his limit!

Why did he still save them?

“Hold on, I will destroy this dragon king immediately!”

Alliance Master Bai Cheng Roared. He moved his palm. At this moment, he could no longer hide!

The strongest attack, the strongest innate supreme treasure!

“Supreme treasure innate, heavy kill Xuan Huang Talisman!”

He held the heavy kill Xuan Huang Talisman in his hand and charged straight at Wang Xian.

“Heavy!”

The heavy kill Xuan Huang Talisman expanded rapidly in the wind. The leader of Bai Cheng let out a low growl.

On the Xuan Huang Talisman, the word “Heavy”emitted a luster. An earthy yellow glow enveloped the surroundings.

“Eh? This Is? An innate treasure?”

Wang Xian felt the power of the heavy kill Xuan Huang Talisman and his pupils constricted slightly!

“You don’t have any helpers, but you have an innate treasure. Is this your trump card?”

He mumbled as his eyes sparkled!
