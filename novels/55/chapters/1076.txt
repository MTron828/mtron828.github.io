Chapter 1077: The son of General 10

Translator: 5496903

The eight-eyed eel had eight eyes, and each eye was extremely pale.

The eight-eyed eel was a water attribute demonic beast, and its eyes could release magical powers. With eight eyes, it could release eight magical powers at most.

Its limit was also to advance to transcendent level eight.

When the eight-eyed eel came out of the cave, everyone immediately felt their bodies turn extremely cold.

“Not good, it’s a demonic beast.”

Zhang Yushu saw the eight-eyed eel coming out of the cave and his expression changed slightly. He quickly shouted.

“Shut up, continue to attack. Hold on for ten seconds!”

Hai Wen saw the eight-eyed eel coming out of the cave and was slightly shocked. However, he quickly roared.

How could he call for help at this time? Once a transcendent level 7 expert came over, the green vine fruit would no longer belong to him.

He wanted to put the green vine fruit away before calling for help.

“Sou!”

At this time, the eight-eyed eel peeked out from the hole, its eyes shooting out a cold glint as cold water arrows shot towards them.

Its body drilled out, at least five meters long. Its head was huge, and it had a snake-like body.

“Attack!”

Hai Wen roared and waved the sword in his hand, creating a 100-meter vacuum in the sea. The vacuum was torn toward the eight-eyed eel.

Zhang Yushu and the others looked serious as they slashed their weapons.

“Buzz!”

One of the eight-eyed eel’s eyes flashed with a blue ball of light. The ball of light came out of the eye and slowly grew bigger, enveloping its entire body.

One after another, attacks landed on the eight-eyed eel’s body, causing faint ripples.

It shook its body, and its huge tail began to turn white. The surface of its tail began to freeze, directly charging towards them.

“Good timing!”

Zhang Yushu held a spirit tool in his left hand, and his eyes revealed an excited expression as he directly went up to meet the attacks.

“Peng!”

“Peng!”

The eight-eyed eel’s frost-white tail directly swung onto Zhang Yushu’s body. However, at the instant it struck, a thin stream of water appeared on his body, and the stream of water blocked all the attacks.

Zhang Yushu’s body moved and he fell down.

The eight-eyed eel didn’t see Hai Wen who was hit. It ignored him and attacked Zhang Yushu and the others.

“Haha!”

When Hai Wen saw that the eight-eyed eel didn’t attack him anymore, he moved and flew towards the green vine fruit. With a wave of his arm, he kept the green vine fruit into his interspatial ring.

“Not good, please help!”

However, Zhang Yushu and the others, who were facing a transcendent level 6 eight-eyed eel, had a huge change in expression. They hurriedly shouted.

“Trash!”

Hai Wen, who had just kept the green vine fruit, heard this shout and said disdainfully.

However, he had already obtained the green vine fruit. Even if there were experts coming over, he would be fine.

“Ahhhh!”

At this moment, a scream was suddenly heard. He turned around and realized that three people had actually died under the attack of the eight-eyed eel.

Hai Wen frowned and a hint of impatience could be seen in his eyes. “What a piece of trash!”

“Teacher, request for reinforcements!”

He immediately shouted out loud. The three level 7 extraordinaire powerhouses nearby immediately looked over and flew over quickly.

“Eh? What’s going on?”

Wang Xian and the four level eight supernatural realm experts looked down from the sea and raised their eyebrows slightly.

“I’ll go and take a look!”

The old man from the Ocean Academy heard this familiar voice. His body moved and he immediately flew down.

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. When he saw the eight-eyed eel, he frowned slightly. Not far away from the eight-eyed eel, there was a familiar figure.

“Someone’s dead. I’ll go over and take a look!”

Wang Xian scanned the area. His eyes sparkled. After saying that, he flew towards that location.

The old man and the president of the East Ocean Academy hesitated for a moment before flying over as well.

Boom

When Wang Xian flew over, the eight-eyed eel had already been killed. His gaze swept across the surroundings and landed on Zhang Yushu’s body.

There was a huge wound on his chest. The wound almost took his life.

“What’s going on? I told you to report immediately if you encounter any demonic beasts. How could you still be attacked by Demonic Beasts?”

Wang Xian took out a transcendent level 6 pill and passed it to Zhang Yushu. He swept his gaze across the surroundings and asked in a deep voice.

Four young men died at the hands of the eight-eyed eel.

“It should be the demonic beasts that suddenly came out from the cave. They didn’t react in time when they were attacked!” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Standing beside Hai Wen, the old man who was at supernatural level 8 from the Ocean Institute suddenly spoke.

He looked at Hai Wen and asked worriedly, “Are You Alright?”

“Uncle Jiang, I’m Fine!”

Hai Wen shook his head.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and looked at Zhang Yushu beside him. He opened his mouth and his eyes flickered. However, after a moment of hesitation, he looked at the old man from the institute.

“It’s inevitable that there will be casualties in the wild. Demonic Beasts are too cunning!”

“That’s right. It’s already lucky that only four people died in this operation!”

The old man from Eastsea Academy and the President of the hiring association shook their heads helplessly.

A few middle-aged men who were at transcendent level seven were prepared to collect his body.

“Who plucked the green vine fruit by the entrance of the cave?”

Wang Xian pointed at the remaining green vine fruit by the entrance of the cave with an expressionless face and asked directly.

“Huh?”

The people around were slightly stunned as they looked at the location that Wang Xian pointed at.

“What? I discovered the green vine fruit and risked my life to obtain it!”

Hai Wen raised his head slightly and said with a displeased expression when he saw Wang Xian discovering the green vine fruit.

“Your team members were attacked by the eight-eyed eel, yet you still have the time to pluck the green vine fruit!”

A hint of coldness appeared in Wang Xian’s eyes. He patted Zhang Yushu, who was beside him, and said, “Speak. Tell us everything that happened just now!”

“You...”

Hai Wen stared at Wang Xian with anger in his eyes. He looked at Zhang Yushu coldly.

“Phew!”

Zhang Yushu took a deep breath and said with a solemn face, “Captain Hai Wen called our team over just now. He wanted us to attack the green vine fruit that was guarding them together with him.”

“There was a deep hole beside the green vine fruit. We suspected that there were more powerful demon beasts or fierce beasts inside, but Captain Haiwen didn’t let us ask for help and asked us to attack together with him!”

“After we attacked together, an eight-eyed eel drilled out of the black hole. I didn’t expect Captain Haiwen to dodge the attack of the eight-eyed eel and pick the green vine fruit after he blocked it with a defensive spiritual artifact!”

“In the end, four of our comrades were killed during this period of time!”

Zhang Yushu said with a bad expression. Hai Wen’s background was too big. It would be a disaster for the Zhang family if they were to offend him completely.

“Zhang Yushu, you better think it through before you say anything!”

Hai Wen stared at him coldly. He was full of threats.

“Then what explanation do you have?”

Wang Xian stared at Hai Wen coldly.

“I have nothing to explain!”

Hai Wen tilted his head and said disdainfully.

“Good. As the captain, you caused the death of four members because of your selfish desires. You deserve to die!”
