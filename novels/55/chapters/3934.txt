“Yuan Hua, please enlighten us! ”

The young man flew to the sky and cupped his hands at Wang Xian.

“Wang Xian, please enlighten us. ”

Wang Xian cupped his hands at him as well and said.

Below them, all the students were looking at them with sparkling eyes.

On the side of the Ming Yi Saint Academy, a battle of this level was very exciting. With the strength of an eternal swordsman at level eight, he was already considered a top-notch student.

“Let’s begin then! ”

As Yuan Hua spoke, he moved his palm. A sharp sword appeared in his hand and shot directly at Wang Xian.

Wang Xian waved his arm and easily blocked the attack.

After the probing attack ended, Yuan Hua disappeared instantly!

Wang Xian saw that Yuan Hua drew a circle around him with the long sword in his hand!

Following that, he sensed something and attacked from behind!

The circular shape turned into an extremely sharp space disk and attacked

Yuan Hua directly.

“Huh?”

Yuan hua slightly adjusted his brows. With a wave of his arm, the sharp sword in his hand condensed into a powerful sword ray and slashed forward!

In the next instant, Wang Xian’s figure disappeared instantly and appeared at

Yuan Hua’s side.

Spatial teleportation. When one teleported to a certain place, they were both spatial swordsmen and could sense spatial fluctuations.

Therefore, the moment Wang Xian appeared, the sharp sword in Yuan Hua’s hand stabbed towards him.

“Disperse! ”

Wang Xian saw the sharp sword in his hand tremble.

At the position in front of him, the spatial disc that was slashed by Yuan Hua disintegrated into many sharp swords.

The sharp sword attacked Yuan Hua at a terrifying speed!

At the same time, he raised his long sword to meet Yuan Hua’s sword.

“This is bad!”

Yuan Hua sensed this scene and his expression changed slightly.

The sharp swords collided with each other. The spatial force of the two of them was about the same.

However, Yuan Hua’s back was attacked by more than ten sharp swords.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

A violent collision sound was heard. Cracks appeared on the spatial barrier on Yuan Hua’s body.

This caused Yuan Hua’s expression to change drastically. His body froze on the spot.

“Thank you for letting me win! ”

Wang Xian looked at him and cupped his hands indifferently.

(‘D * mn, it can’t be. Such a fast speed. The Victor has been decided just like

“This is an instant kill. Yuan Hua must have arrived at the Songyi Saint

Academy thousands of years ago. How could he be defeated so easily?” “That sword technique called Wang Xian is more ingenious. ”

The students below revealed a shocked expression when they saw this scene.

It was extremely rare for someone of the same level to defeat another opponent so quickly.

One had to know that they were all space practitioners. It was extremely difficult to determine the victor among those of the same level.

Although their sword techniques were inferior to the opponent, it was still very difficult to be defeated as long as one escaped.

In the previous battles, which one of them did not fight for an hour?

The outcome of the battle was determined just by a simple exchange of blows.

“Huh? What a powerful swordsmanship. ”

Yin Xueyue looked at Wang Xian and said with astonishment. “HMM, not bad. Your swordsmanship is very ingenious.”

Instructor he looked at Wang Xian and nodded his head in praise.

Wang Xian smiled and flew back to his previous position.

Yuan Hua’s expression changed slightly as he flew back. His expression was a little ugly.

It was hard for him to accept that he was defeated so easily by someone of the same level.

“Let’s go for the next one.”

At the side, the other two eternal swordsman level 8 students exchanged glances and began to spar.

This time, the strength of both parties was about the same. They fought for an hour but there was no result.

After that, the two of them did not continue fighting.

Student Wang Xian, it didn’t take much effort for you to spar with Yuan Hua just now. Let’s Spar.”

After the battle between the two of them ended, Yin Xueyue finally looked at Wang Xian and said.

Her strength had already reached the peak of level eight of the Eternal Swordsman. She could step into level nine of the eternal swordsman at any time.

She was publicly acknowledged as the strongest level eight eternal swordsman in the class.

She stared at Wang Xian, her eyes filled with fighting spirit.

sure!

Wang Xian nodded and teleported to the sky.

Yin Xueyue followed closely behind.

Instructor he used two barriers to protect them. “Student Wang Xian, your strength is very strong. Let’s Begin! ”

Yin xueyue stared at Wang Xian and said directly!

“Alright, I’m going to make my move!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. Waves of energy were injected into the longsword and started to swing it in front of him!

When Yin Xueyue saw the energy on Wang Xian’s sharp sword, her eyes revealed a look of vigilance!

Buzz

He didn’t give Wang Xian much of a chance. He immediately teleported in front of Wang Xian. It was filled with the tearing force of space and wrapped around him.

Sword Net! ”

Yin xueyue snorted coldly and displayed her powerful swordsmanship.

Under the cover of the sword net, Wang Xian felt that the space around him was a little unstable. He couldn’t teleport at all! Numerous sharp swords were flying towards him.

Sword Hum! ”

Wang Xian’s arm trembled. The sharp sword in his hand was suspended in front of him and started to rotate.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The continuous sounds of collision rang out. All the attacks from the sword net were blocked.

“Sword chime as one! ”

The moment all the sword nets were blocked, a sharp sword formed from space attribute appeared above Wang Xian ‘s head. It instantly attacked Yin Xueyue!

This attack caused Yin Xueyue’s heart to tremble violently.

“How can it be so sharp?”

Yin Xueyue’s body moved and she hurriedly teleported away!

However, Wang Xian, who was staring at her, sensed the fluctuation of the space and attacked that direction directly.

The moment Yin Xueyue appeared, a sword ray slashed directly at the top of her head.

Crack! Crack

The space barrier on his body cracked slowly.

“How did you sense my teleportation location so quickly?”

Yin Xueyue’s expression changed slightly when she saw the sharp sword slashing at the top of her head. She asked Wang Xian in shock.

“Thank you! ”

Wang Xian smiled and cupped his hands without replying.

The improvement of one’s realm not only represented the improvement of one’s destructive power, but it also represented the improvement of one’s perception and reaction.

Wang Xian’s void dragon body was extremely terrifying in terms of the convenience of his senses.

Even if his senses required the support of his own energy.

However, his senses were still a few levels higher than those of the same level!

Therefore, Wang Xian was able to capture the location of his teleportation when Yin Xueyue teleported.

After all, teleportation required the use of the power of space. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

All he needed to do was to capture the fluctuation of the power of space!

“Very strong sensing ability! ”

Instructor he looked at Wang Xian with a twinkle in his eves as he praised.

“This brother named Wang Xian is too strong, isn’t he?”

“He is simply insane. How can he be so terrifying when they are of the same level? Also, what sword technique did he use? It seems to be very strong. ”

“He can actually sense the location where Yin Xueyue teleported.. Amazing! He should be able to take on two or three people of the same level, right?”
