The atmosphere above dragon star was slightly awkward!

The disciples of the six major factions stood there, staring blankly at the powerful defense in front of them!

If they couldn’t break through, what should they do?

By now, the entire star South Galaxy must have known that they were attacking Dragon Star. However, if everyone knew that they still couldn’t break through the opponent’s defense, it would be too embarrassing!

Two of the four forces couldn’t break the defense of the Dragon Star. were they too weak? Or was the Dragon Palace too strong?

“Damn it, if we can’t break the defense of the enemy, we can’t do anything to the Dragon Palace!”

The leader of the ninth grade Sky clan growled in a low voice with a gloomy face!

The enemy was right in front of them, but they couldn’t do anything about it. This made them extremely angry!

They were full of confidence just a moment ago, but now...

What should they do?

“There’s another way. We can use the teleportation formation to enter the inner part of dragon star directly. Now, the teleportation formation on dragon star is not sealed!”

An elder from the Sky Mountain Sword sect said with a gloomy face!

“No, they can set up such a powerful defensive formation. It’s not necessarily impossible for them to set up a powerful killing formation. Once we enter, there will be a great risk. Moreover, this might not be a trap they deliberately left behind!”

A Patriarch from the ninth grade heaven sect immediately shook his head!

“Our strength is clearly much stronger than the other party, yet we are so aggrieved. This F * cking array master really deserves to die!”

A patriarch could not help but curse!

The Dragon Palace and Tiger Chaos Fey Country had at most two to three undying godly king level 7 experts. It was easy for them to destroy the other party!

However, it was because of this formation that they were helpless!

This feeling was extremely stifling!

“There’s another way, with the defensive power of this formation, the attacks of over a dozen undying level 7 warriors will be the upper limit, unless we can find a few more undying level 7 warriors!”

The sect Master of the ninth grade Sky sect said with a dark expression!

“That’s basically impossible. Other than us, only the Sky Eagle Cloud Group and the North Gate Undying Dynasty have level 7 undying fighters. Without sufficient benefits, they will definitely not attack!”

Sword Emperor gripped the blood sword in his hand and said solemnly!

“Then what do we do?”

An expert could not help but growl!

What do we do?

They didn’t know what to do either!

If we can’t even break through the other party’s defense, what else can we do?

The atmosphere turned gloomy, and no one in the surroundings spoke a word!

The group of disciples didn’t even dare to breathe heavily when they saw this scene!

“Hu, there’s only one way at the moment. Seal off the dragon planet completely and prevent any factions from contacting the planet. I’d like to see how they’ll develop without all the resources!”

“As long as we see any of them come out, we’ll send people to kill them!”

A few minutes later, a Patriarch of the ninth grade heaven sect said with a gloomy face!

If they couldn’t break through and destroy them quickly, they could only seal them off!

Seal them off and prevent them from contacting the planet. destroy all their teleportation arrays. Anyone who entered the dragon planet would have to consider their revenge!

As long as anyone from the Dragon Palace and the Tiger Demon Country came out, they would send people to kill them!

At the moment, this was the only way!

“Okay!”

The rest of the experts gritted their teeth and nodded. This was the only way!

“Send people to monitor this place. Even if a mosquito flies out, we must monitor it!”

The Sword King roared with a gloomy face!

“Yes!”

The experts from the Sky Mountain Sword sect nodded and immediately gave the order!

After everything was set up, all the experts from the six major forces left with gloomy faces!

“Hahaha, a bunch of trash, why did you leave? Didn’t you say that you were going to destroy me today?”

“You can’t even break through our defenses, yet you still dare to say that you are going to destroy us? The six major trash, you still dare to shout and curse at us!”

On the nine planets around Dragon Star, a group of disciples from the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom saw that all the experts from the six major forces had returned with extremely ugly expressions on their faces. Their faces were filled with ridicule!

Some of the irascible heavenly demons immediately cursed at the top of their lungs!

Their voices reached the ears of the experts from the six major forces, causing their faces to turn extremely gloomy!

“Hahaha, the defense of the dragon star is simply too strong. The Array Formation Master from the Dragon Palace is simply too powerful!”

“If the other forces in the southern star system knew about this, they would definitely be shocked beyond words. The millions of experts from the two major forces couldn’t even break through our defenses!”

“I almost wet my pants just now, I didn’t expect the warrior from the Dragon Palace to be so powerful!”

“I want to spread this news to the AI, it will definitely shock everyone!”

...

The disciples from the Tiger Chaos Demon Country saw them escape and discussed excitedly!

There was also sky demon spreading the news to the AI!

When the people on the AI saw the news, they didn’t believe it at first!

This was the combined attack of the six powers, eight or nine undying level 7 warriors!

From their point of view, the news of the destruction of the Dragon Star would soon arrive!

At first, when they saw the news, they didn’t believe it, but more and more of it appeared, causing everyone to be stunned!

Very quickly, the Sky Mountain Sword sect, Level 9 Sky sect and the other six powers were discovered, the entire star South Galaxy was in an uproar!

The defense of the Dragon Star was able to withstand the attacks of the six major forces. How terrifying was this?

Some of the bravest people hesitated for a moment and directly arrived at the Dragon Star through the teleportation array!

When they saw that there were no people from the six major forces in the surrounding void space, their faces were filled with shock!

“They actually managed to withstand it. Hiss, the safety of this dragon star is too heaven-defying!”

...

“Crazy, crazy. If the millions of experts failed to break through, wouldn’t more people enter the Dragon Star in the future?”

Some people stood around the tactical teleportation array and murmured!

They could already imagine that the dragon star would soon be overcrowded!

This made the people who retreated the houses cry in pain. It was too difficult for them!

The Dragon Star had accomplished what they thought was impossible time and time again!

The southern star system was in an uproar. Countless people were teleported to the Dragon Star and flew to the sky, discussing in shock!

“I’ve decided. I’m going to buy a house on the Dragon Star!”

“I’m going to move my family members here!”

Some people secretly decided that such a safe planet with such a powerful training ground was the most suitable place to settle down!

“Look at the AI. The ninth-grade sky sect of the Sky Mountain Sword sect and the other four forces have jointly issued a statement. They want to seal off the Dragon Planet!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

However, at this moment, a middle-aged man’s shocked voice sounded!

“What?”

“Seal off the Dragon Planet? This... They want to destroy all the teleportation arrays leading to the dragon planet and warn everyone that as long as they enter the dragon planet, they will be their enemies!”

“Hiss, with the six major forces, they indeed have the ability to seal off Planet Dragon!”

Everyone opened their AI and saw the information on it. Their expressions changed slightly!
