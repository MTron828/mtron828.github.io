2612 2612’s strength had broken through, and the Abyss was undergoing a metamorphosis

The other members of the Dragon Palace would naturally not have any objections to letting the sky array raise its strength first!

Not to mention that the sky array was a special dragon species, it was a void God Emperor in itself. A powerful array master would have much more use in raising its strength compared to the other members of the Dragon Palace! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Just in terms of defense, after he raised his strength, he would be given sufficient time to set up a defense that could not be broken by more than ten people of the same level!

“Haha, at least you juniors are sensible!”

When Tian Chen heard them say that he was taking advantage of his seniority, he smiled and started to take advantage of his seniority!

“Tsk Tsk, no wonder Tian Chen was killed by someone. So, you’re annoying!”

Ba Qi mocked from the side!

“Hmph, I’ve evolved into a dragon shaman now. I can easily kill those guys who attacked me in the future!”

When Tian Chen heard his words, he said with a cold expression!

“Haha, in a few years, we will be able to easily destroy those who killed you. At that time, you can retire!”

Mo Sha said with a smile!

Tian Chen smiled and did not continue speaking!

It was just as Mo Sha and the others had said. If the Dragon Palace was given a few more years, the divine emperor would be able to easily destroy it!

At that time, he might not even need to make a move. This bunch of unlikable brats in front of him would be able to avenge him!

However, he would avenge himself!

“Alright, let’s go down and take a look. This bunch of abyssal seeds have been guarding this place. There are also many abyssal seeds who have risked their lives to charge in. The fruits inside are definitely extraordinary!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he immediately flew towards the bottom of the lava!

A group of members from the Dragon Palace immediately followed from the left and right!

After flying down for a few minutes, the gigantic tree below appeared in their line of sight!

A tree that lived in the lava was rooted at the bottom of the entire gigantic mountain. It looked extremely huge!

According to Wang Xian’s guess, the entire divine tree was at least hundreds of millions of kilometers in size!

It was definitely a gigantic object!

On the gigantic tree, there were many bright red fruits growing!

The fruit was one meter in size and had a huge body!

Wang Xian moved his body and arrived at the location of a fruit!

“Flame Birch Tree, Immortal King level nine divine tree!”

As he approached the gigantic tree, the system notification entered Wang Xian’s mind, causing him to be slightly surprised!

Immortal King level nine divine tree. A divine tree of this level was considered a gigantic divine object!

“Flame Birch fruit, level six immortal King Fruit!”

Looking at the fruit in front of him, the information of the fruit appeared in his mind!

He scanned his surroundings with his yin-yang five elemental dragon eyes. His eyes were sparkling!

“There are at least a thousand fruits. Many of them are not fully ripe yet. Even so, the energy of these fruits is enough for me to upgrade myself!”

A smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face. He moved his body and continued to fly downwards!

“Eh? Dragon King, this divine tree has completely merged with the Giant Mountain. If you want to take this divine tree away, I’m afraid you have to take the Giant Mountain Away Too!”

Ao Xingmu, who was not far away, sensed the entire tree and spoke!

“Is that so?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and came to the lowest position!

“This lava is created by this divine tree. It can only survive in this environment. I am communicating with it now. Once it leaves this environment, it will suffer great damage!”

Ao Xingmu continued to speak to Wang Xian!

“Oh? In that case, let’s take the entire mountain peak away!”

Wang Xian spoke!

The gigantic mountain peak was like an entire planet. If they wanted to take it away, they could do so too!

“Dragon King, we can turn the entire mountain into a powerful war machine, I can set up powerful defense and attack arrays on it, after I upgrade, as long as we have enough god stones to defend against a dozen undying level 8 warriors, it won’t be a problem!”

The sky array sized up the entire mountain!

The holes were perfect for attack, and the entire mountain was extremely sturdy because it was one with the undying level 9 flame birch tree!

He could definitely turn it into a powerful war machine!

“That’s totally possible, Dragon King, our fire hammer clan can also build powerful war machines on it!”

At the side, Duan Jinming and the old clan leader spoke up!

The golden-fire dragon seed was the strongest dragon seed in the forging arts of the Dragon Palace. Even if it was not the best in the universe, it was still one of the top five existences!

The huge war machines that they forged could be said to be large-scale and powerful divine weapons. Needless to say, they were powerful!

“War machines that run amok in the Void?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows!

In fact, the Dragon Palace was a powerful war machine of the Divine Dragon Clan. However, it was obviously inappropriate to bring the Dragon Palace to battle in the void sometimes!

...

It was not bad to create a war machine that belonged to the Dragon Palace!

“Alright, I’ll leave this matter to the heaven array and the Fire Hammer clan!”

Wang Xian nodded. Then, he looked at the members of the dragon palace and said, “Let’s go back with this huge mountain!”

As he spoke, he flew out immediately!

The members of the Dragon Palace followed closely behind. They brought along a mountain peak that was as big as the stars and flew toward the exit of the Abyss!

Wang Xian and the rest brought along this huge mountain peak. Their speed was not affected much!

Two days later, they arrived at the entrance of the Abyss!

The entrance was big enough. The huge mountain peak could be brought out directly!

“Roar!”

“Ga Ga Ga!”

“Ji Ji Ji Ji!”

...

Just as they reached the exit, an extremely shocking sound came from the Abyss!

“Huh?”

Wang Xian and the rest were slightly shocked when they heard the sound. They immediately looked into the Abyss!

“What a terrifying sound!”

Some of the members of the Dragon Palace frowned slightly. They were shocked!

“It should be a level 9 immortal king. It’s the roar of a peak immortal King Abyss seed!”

Heaven Array’s eyes flashed as he looked inside!

“It’s very, very far away from us. Let’s go. There’s no need to bother about it!”

Wang Xian took a glance and didn’t pay too much attention to it. Everyone brought the huge mountain and flew towards the direction of the southern star system!

More than ten hours later, Wang Xian and the rest brought the huge mountain to the surroundings of the Dragon Star!

Some of the powerhouses on Dragon Star were astonished when they saw the gigantic mountain that the Dragon Palace brought over!

“Sky Formation, go and improve your strength first. After that, modify this gigantic mountain!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he flew straight into the Dragon Palace!

After a long time, his strength could finally be improved!

After that, his strength could be considered as an overlord in the entire Imperial Star Field!

“Hu!”

In the Dragon Emperor Palace, the flame birch fruits were swallowed into his stomach. Wang Xian’s dragon energy was rapidly increasing!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Ding, Congratulations on your upgrade, you have advanced to undying god King Level 2!”
