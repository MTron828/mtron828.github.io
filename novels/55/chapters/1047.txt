Chapter 1048: Target 10

Translator: 5496903

The old woman did not know what had happened to Her Majesty the Empress.

However, she would support the Empress 100% in whatever she did.

Even if the Empress wanted to take in a man as her husband, she would support him unconditionally.

The old woman did not enter the room. Instead, she gently closed the door.

Today was the happiest day since she had followed the empress. Naturally, she could not disturb her.

After closing the door, her eyes flickered when she looked at the group of strange demons beside her. Her eyes were filled with shock as well.

The light and darkness were perfectly fused together?

What kind of demonic beast race was this?

However, she could sense that this demonic beast race was very powerful.

“Have a taste!”

In the room, Feng Luan poured a cup of tea for Wang Xian. She asked with a smile, “Has sister Shu Qing and the rest arrived yet?”

“No. I was afraid that they weren’t strong enough, so I didn’t ask them to come here for the time being!”

Wang Xian shook his head and looked at Feng Luan. “However, with such a powerful lackey around, I can call them over!”

Feng Luan revealed a bitter smile. “Things are different from what you saw!”

“How is it different? Your current strength is at level one of the void interpretation stage. The two middle-aged men outside are also void interpretation stage powerhouses. The strength of that old lady is even more unfathomable. This is just what I saw. Your current strength should be very strong in the empire, right?”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“The firecloud Sparrow clan was my personal guard in the past. Ever since I fell, they withdrew from the Phoenix dynasty and lived in seclusion in the firecloud mountain range. I was betrayed and killed by some people from the dynasty. Now, the Phoenix dynasty is in the hands of those people!”

Feng Luan poured herself a cup of tea. “The strength of the firecloud Sparrow clan can not be moved. Once they move, the Phoenix dynasty will know that I’m not dead!”

“If they knew that I’m still alive, they would mobilize the entire Empire’s forces to kill me. More than a thousand years have passed, and I no longer have anyone in the Phoenix Empire!”

As Feng Luan spoke, her expression slowly darkened.

“You mean to say that you can’t touch the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan? At most, they can only provide some resources. Do you still need to rely on yourself for everything?”

Wang Xian frowned slightly and said slowly.

“When they don’t have the ability to resist the Phoenix dynasty, the fire Lark clan can not be moved. Moreover, the fire Lark clan doesn’t have many resources. They still have to sustain the birth of their own race. Hence, I established the Phoenix Elixir and Weapons Workshop!”

Feng Luan replied.

“Do I need you to start from scratch?”

Wang Xian looked at her.

“Yes, starting from scratch is ten times more difficult than a thousand years ago!”

More than a thousand years ago, she directly inherited the throne. She had the resources and manpower under her. That was why she was able to become the number one empress of all time.

Now, she didn’t have anyone and didn’t have many resources. Most importantly, she had an enemy, the Phoenix dynasty. The difficulty was ten times or even dozens of times more than before.

“Do you know how long it took me to stand at the top of the Earth?”

Wang Xian suddenly asked her.

“HMM?”

Feng Luan looked at him in surprise.

“Two years. In two years, no one on Earth can rival the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian answered his own question with a strong confidence on his face.

Feng Luan looked at him and nodded with a smile.

“Do you know how long I have been in the transcendence continent? Three months. I have established the dragon Spike mercenary group, which is awe-inspiring in the entire East Sea City

“In the entire East Sea city, other than the city lord of East Sea City and the leader of the ocean cultivators, I can not kill anyone in the entire East Sea city, including the towns under East Sea City

“In ten years, do you believe that I can stand at the top of the transcendence continent?”

Wang Xian exuded a strong sense of confidence as he stared at Feng Luan with burning eyes.

Feng Luan looked at him with sparkling eyes and didn’t say anything.

“So when I came to the transcendence continent, I was still thinking about how we would develop independently and see who would stand at the top of the transcendence continent first. Now, it seems that I will stand at the top of the transcendence continent First!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he stood up and looked at Feng Luan with a smile. Then, he continued, “But it doesn’t matter. As long as I’m here, I will help you take revenge. I will destroy the Feng Dynasty and stand on the throne once again. I will become the number one empress of all time!”

“At most, in ten years!”

He said the last sentence heavily.

Feng Luan looked at him and smiled. She stood up and stared at him. “I don’t need your help. Since you said that we will see who will stand at the peak of transcendence first, I would also like to see if it’s You or me!”

“Haha, Alright. However, you are destined to lose to me!”

Wang Xian laughed. “But now, I still need your help. My Immortal Phoenix auction is going to be held here. Also, Feng Xian, help me promote it. Is That Alright, Your Majesty?”

Feng Luan opened her mouth and rolled her eyes at him. She was very flirtatious.

“Alright, I will get someone to instruct you later!”

Feng Luan smiled and said to him. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Sure!”

Wang Xian smiled and started to chat with Feng Luan.

When they talked about the future development, Feng Luan told Wang Xian all of her thoughts.

This included his desire to conquer Donghai city and his development today.

Wang Xian listened quietly at the side. He also told him about his intention to move the Dragon Palace to the supernatural continent.

The two of them talked in the room for at least three to four hours.

“Alright, it’s getting dark. I should leave now. I’ll look for You Tomorrow!”

The sky outside the window turned dark. Wang Xian stood up and said to Feng Luan.

“Okay, where do you live?”

Feng Luan nodded and asked him.

“I don’t have a place to live. Aren’t you going to let me stay?”

Wang Xian looked at the boudoir inside and said with a smile.

“Take care!”

Feng Luan stretched her back and walked straight inside.

Wang Xian shook his head and left after giving a shout.

After pushing open the door, the old woman and two middle-aged men stood guard there. The three of them nodded at him in a friendly manner.

“Young master Wang!”

On the first floor, the three women greeted Wang Xian respectfully.

The young master in front of him had such a close relationship with their empress. He had to be careful in the future.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded and walked out of the auction house. He looked around.

“Reach the peak again? Destroy the Phoenix Dynasty? That is your goal. However, I have a goal for myself too!”

“Unify the supernatural continent’s sea area and help you become the first empress since ancient times!”

“When the time comes, I will rule the sea!”

“You will rule the land!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and walked toward an inn not far away.

One must have a goal. Wang Xian had already set his goal.

The only thing was that he didn’t know when he would be able to accomplish it.

Within ten years!

He hoped that he would be able to accomplish his goal within ten years.

On the fourth floor of the restaurant, Feng Luan stood in front of the window. She looked at Wang Xian’s figure with a happy smile on her face.

The journey in the future will not be lonely!
