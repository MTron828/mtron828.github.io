Chapter 1661: 1661 was instantly killed

“Not good, we’re in trouble!”

“We have people from the masked assassin organization!”

The sudden attack of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop and the appearance of the masked assassin caused the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan to fall into chaos.

Before the Demon God tribe’s five rank 9 void interpretation experts arrived, the difference in strength between the two sides was not completely overwhelming.

However, due to the existence of the masked assassin organization, the Fire Cloud Sparrow tribe’s formation could not be organized.

If the clansmen beside him were from the masked assassin organization, he could be ambushed at any time.

Now that the demon god Tribe’s experts had arrived and restrained the sacred fire tribe, the Fire Cloud Sparrow tribe did not have the strength to resist.

This was because the main force this time was the sacred fire tribe.

“Demon God tribe, are you guys going to participate in this war! ?”

The Fire Cloud Sparrow tribe Elder’s expression was incomparably ugly as he shouted at the five insightful void realm experts of the demon God tribe who were flying over.

“Haha, What Does Our Demon God tribe want to do? There’s no need to explain to you guys. We are participating in this war, so what?”

The Demon God tribe Elder in the middle shouted arrogantly. He did not put the fire cloud sparrow tribe in his eyes at all.

Not to mention the others, just the strength of their demon God tribe wasn’t weaker than the Fire Cloud Sparrow tribe. Naturally, they wouldn’t show any weakness!

“Prepare to retreat!”

The four rank nine profound void realm experts of the sacred fire tribe looked around with extremely unsightly expressions and said to all the disciples.

“Retreat? Can you retreat?” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The experts of the demon God tribe laughed loudly.

“Not a single member of the Fire Cloud Sparrow tribe is left alive!”

Cold killing intent could be heard from both sides.

Figures quickly flew over.

Although none of these people were too strong, there were around 500 to 600 people at the profound void realm on the left and right sides.

Seeing the 20,000 people charging over from the sides, the faces of the Fire Cloud Sparrow tribe members were filled with despair.

The detection array could detect people who were stronger than them, but the people coming from the flanks were not that strong.

The detection array was extremely precious to begin with, and only a small number of people had it. The people of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan who were at the eighth or ninth level of the profound void tier held the detection array, so they would not be on guard against them.

Because the other party did not have an expert who was half a step away from longevity.

This resulted in the current situation.

“Hahahaha, I’ll exterminate you all today. It Won’t be long before your fire cloud sparrow clan disappears from the transcendental continent!”

The elders of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop held weapons in their hands, and their faces revealed savage expressions.

They had invited the demonic God tribe in order to exterminate the fire cloud sparrow clan as soon as possible.

“It’s over, their people are many times more than ours!”

“Oh No, oh no, will our fire cloud sparrow tribe’s experts come to rescue us!”

“This group of despicable fellows, they are actually ambushing us!”

Furious and despairing expressions were emitted from the fire cloud sparrow tribe’s mouths.

They scanned their surroundings warily and shouted loudly.

“Fight!”

The two fire cloud sparrow elders looked at each other. They gritted their teeth and roared loudly.

“Kill! Even if we have to die, we have to kill one!”

“Killing one is worth it. Killing Two is a profit!”

Everyone from the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan clenched their fists tightly and prepared to die.

“Everyone from the masked assassin organization, wait for my order and immediately attack. Haha!”

At this moment, the elder from the life and Death Elixir Workshop laughed out loud.

To be able to kill more than 20,000 members of the fire Lark clan this time was a great morale boost for them.

Upon hearing the words of the elder from the life and Death Elixir Workshop, everyone from the fire Lark clan looked extremely embarrassed.

They didn’t know if they were teammates or assassins.

“Brother Wang Xian!”

At this moment, Huo Luo'er widened her eyes as she stared blankly at Elder Xuan Hua who was pierced through by Wang Xian’s arm and the enemies around her. She shouted softly.

Wang Xian stood in the sky. The face of elder Xuan Hua who was pierced through began to change. Clearly, it was the change of the masked assassin organization.

He scanned his surroundings and saw that the enemies on both sides and in front of him had already rushed over. A smile appeared on his face.

“Come, little sister Huo Luo'er. Today, I will let you see what instant kill is!”

Wang Xian gently pushed away the corpse of the masked killer in front of him and said to Huo Luo'er calmly.

“HMM?”

Huo Luo'er looked at Wang Xian in a daze.

“Five elemental grindstone!”

Wang Xian touched her head and his body shook. His Dharma Idol, five elemental grindstone, was instantly unleashed.

With his human-dragon unity, he could unleash the terrifying strength of a half-step into the realm of longevity even in his human form.

Buzz

At the same time, he opened his mouth and his weapon, the five elements Millstone, flew into the sky instantly.

Boom! Boom! Boom

In an instant, a terrifying pressure spread out in a radius of 100 kilometers.

The entire sky turned dark in an instant.

A voice that sounded like a millstone was heard in the sky.

“What?”

“What’s going on? are the half-step longevity realm experts of the life and death forging workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop also hiding around?”

As they felt the changes in the world, everyone’s expressions changed drastically.

Shocked and terrified voices came from the fire Lark clan.

Two gray millstones of the five elements floated in the sky. Each of them had a terrifying radius of 20 kilometers.

The two millstones covered an area of 40 kilometers.

The Sky couldn’t be seen at all.

All the members of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan were in despair!

“This is?”

However, this sudden change also stunned everyone in the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop.

The elders of the two large forces looked at the terrifying millstones that had suddenly appeared in a daze, and their faces were filled with shock.

It seemed that there were no half-step longevity experts from their two forces.

“Who is it?”

“Someone from the two large factions?”

Everyone’s gazes, including the Demon God tribe’s five rank nine profound void realm experts that had just flown over, all looked over in shock.

“Oh? That is?”

Everyone saw Huo Luo'er and a youth standing together in the middle of the sky.

A terrifying energy connected the terrifying millstone in the sky to that youth.

“It seems to be, it seems to be one of our people...”

Xu Xingcan and Huo Mingtu of the fire lark tribe looked at the young man beside Huo Luo'er in shock and muttered.

“That is?”

However, at this moment, the five experts of the demon god tribe who were hovering in the sky recognized Wang Xian instantly.

“It’s him, it’s him, this... this...”

The five elders of the demon God tribe revealed a hint of fear in their eyes.

A few days ago, when they were chasing after the flaming soul, they were sent flying 50 kilometers away by this figure and were severely injured.

They took two days to recover from their injuries.

Originally, they had followed the disciples of the Demon God tribe here today. It was because their injuries had yet to fully recover that they were a little late.

But they had just recovered, and they met this person again?
