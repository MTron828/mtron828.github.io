“It’s the Void Beast mercenary group and the amethyst mercenary group. I didn’t expect them to arrive here before us!”

“That’s Zhang Fengying from the Zhang family and Zeng Qixiong from the Xiahou mercenary group. He’s a transcendent level 7 powerhouse!”

“They’re almost finished with the Jinlin Boa at the entrance!”

There were more than a hundred people. Two middle-aged men and two old men stood at the front.

Beside them were four young men.

Obviously, Zhang Yitian, Xia Hou, and the rest had called Zhang Fengying and elder Zeng over for this mission. The group of them had also called over four experts who were at transcendent level seven.

They were a team formed by seven mercenary groups from the Demon Hunter College. Their abilities far surpassed the void Beast mercenary group and the amethyst mercenary group.

When Wang Xian noticed the arrival of the group of people, he had already stopped and looked at their location.

“Twenty-three. HMPH, you seem to only have a dozen of them!”

After Zhang Fengying had killed twenty-three Caracas, she looked at Wang Xian with a smug expression.

However, when she saw Wang Xian looking into the distance, she was slightly taken aback. Immediately, she noticed a group of people that was a thousand meters away.

“What sharp eyes!”

Zhang Fengying mumbled to Wang Xian with an unhappy expression.

It was obvious that he was unhappy when he saw that Wang Xian had discovered that there were people outside before him and that he had lost in the investigation.

He looked at the group of people with displeasure.

“Captain Zhang, Captain Xiahou, and two seniors. I didn’t expect you guys to arrive faster than us!”

The group of people walked over and spoke to Zhang Yitian, Xiahou Ming, and the rest.

“What a coincidence!”

Zhang Fengying clearly brought her emotions to them as she said coldly.

“Hehe, we’re just lucky. Thank you for getting rid of these brocade scale boas!”

A middle-aged man at the front said with a smile.

“Should we work together or go our own ways?”

Elder Zeng walked over and looked at them.

“What do you think?”

The middle-aged man looked at them and exchanged glances with the three transcendent-level 7 experts beside him. He smiled.

“Alright!”

The few people beside them nodded.

It was not as if no one had entered the cave of the windwing savage fish before. They either died or returned empty-handed.

No one knew how dangerous it was.

Most of them were just students. It was fine if they could not get the treasure, but it was not worth it if they lost their lives.

At the last banquet, their idea was to join forces. This time, they naturally would not refuse.

“Commander Zhang, Commander Xiahou, let’s Make a plan. I have a map of the cave of the wind-winged savage fish. Although it may be detailed, it is better than nothing!”

A young man held a map in his hand and said to Zhang Yitian and Xiahou Ming.

“Alright, it’s good that we can complete this mission. Even if we fail, we can treat it as an experience. Our lives are more important!”

Xiahou Ming walked over with a smile on his face.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and walked towards the young man.

“Huh?”

However, when the young man saw Wang Xian walking over, he was slightly stunned. Then, he slowly folded the map in his hand and looked at him with a frown. “Wang Xian!”

“Wang Xian?”

“Eh? That new student Wang Xian. I didn’t expect him to follow the void Beast Amethyst over!” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

When they saw the young man calling out the name of Wang Xian, the rest of the people behind looked over at the same time with curious expressions on their faces.

Currently, everyone in the Demon Hunters Academy knew the name of Wang Xian.

No one dared to admit that he was the one who killed Yun Hanhai and the rest.

However, most people felt that he was foolish and was courting death.

“Captain Lian, the young master’s mercenary group has said that whoever defends him, regardless of which mercenary group, they will definitely make him pay a heavy price!”

“Also, on the Yun family’s side...”

A young man walked over and whispered to Captain Lian who was holding a map in his hand.

When the four middle-aged men heard their words, they raised their eyebrows and waved at a young man beside them.

“Captain Zhang, Captain Xiahou, we can work together, but this Wang Xian...”

Captain Lian looked at Zhang Yitian and Xiahou Ming and said indifferently, “We can’t bring him along. I heard that the Yun family is already preparing to take revenge!”

“Huh? What’s Going On? Why Can’t we bring him along? This fellow is much more useful than you guys!”

Zhang Fengying heard Captain Lian’s words and said coldly with some surprise.

“Hehe, there are some things that you might not know, senior. Right now, no one dares to get close to this person!”

A young man next to him looked at Wang Xian with a mocking expression. “It’s not good for a person who is about to die to implicate others!”

“Huh?”

Zhang Fengying was stunned. Zhang Yitian and Xia houming frowned and looked at them. “From the looks of it now, our cooperation...”

“That’s good. You guys can go with them. I’ll go alone!”

Wang Xian didn’t pay any attention to the words of the few young men. He said directly to Zhang Yitian, Xia houming, and the rest.

“Leader Wang, don’t worry. We won’t...”

Zhang Yitian was slightly stunned and quickly explained.

“I’ll go alone. I’ll be a burden if I go with you guys!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Hehe, you really know your limits. You know that you will be a burden!”

Captain Lian said with a smile when he heard Wang Xian’s words.

“Captain Wang Won’t be a burden. Captain Wang’s strength...”

“Xiao Hua, don’t speak!”

A girl from the amethyst mercenary group wanted to refute on Wang Xian’s behalf, but Zhang Yitian quickly stopped her.

The young master’s mercenary group and the Yun family wanted to deal with Wang Xian. However, they didn’t know Wang Xian’s true strength yet. Once he revealed his true strength, he would be in even more danger.

“Stop!”Zhang Yitian quickly shouted.

Xia houming also gestured to his subordinates behind him to stop them from talking.

“You... You Brat!”

Zhang Fengying revealed a displeased expression when she heard that he was dragging them down. She knew that he was referring to them.

“Hehe, you guys can come along. I’ll be leaving First!”

Wang Xian was all smiles. He waved his hand at Zhang Fengying and the rest and walked straight into the deep pit.

Speaking of which, he still had to thank these people.

Now that he was here, he had already understood everything that he needed to know. Following that, following the amethyst mercenary group and the Void Beast mercenary group would make him feel restricted.

Wang Xian was more than happy to part with them.

Although it was a little like burning the bridge after crossing the river, he would give them some compensation if he could obtain the treasure.

“You Bastard, get lost now!”

Zhang Fengying became even angrier when she saw Wang Xian’s happy face.

Clearly, this fellow was eager to part with them.

It was obvious that he despised them!

“Kid, Hurry up and leave. The young master’s mercenary group and the Yun family might come looking for you soon. Hehe, it’s better to die at the hands of the ferocious beasts than to be tortured to death!”
