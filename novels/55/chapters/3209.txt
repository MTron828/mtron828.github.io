Chapter 3210: The Heavenly Dragon 3209 roared, and the Starriver clan submitted

The Heavenly Dragon King, as one of the leaders of the powerful races in the Starriver Galaxy, most of the venerables had seen him before.

The universe venerables of the Starriver clan had naturally seen the Heavenly Dragon King before.

The Great Beings of other races might be afraid of the Heavenly Dragon King, but their Starriver clan wasn’t.

In terms of strength and foundation, their starriver clan was much stronger than the Heavenly Dragon Clan.

And now, the Sky Dragon Clan was destroyed by the Dragon Palace.

Now, the Sky Dragon King might have inherited the Sky Sea Dragon Palace and had a breakthrough in strength.

But he wanted the Starriver clan to submit?

Their eyes were cold.

“How can that lowly thing, the Sky Dragon King, be compared to me? You two are courting death, die for me. Today, if your Starriver clan doesn’t submit to me, I will destroy all of your clansmen.”

Sky Sea Dragon King heard the words of the two universe knights and his eyes revealed a cold and violent look.

He moved and charged towards the two universe knights of the Starriver clan at a terrifying speed.

“What!”

“Are you going against our Starriver Clan?”

The two universe knights of the Starriver clan heard his words and saw him charging over. Their expressions changed slightly.

Hua La La

One of the universe knights focused his gaze and waved his arm. The sound of rushing water instantly spread to the surrounding starry sky, giving off an alarm sound.

They sensed the speed of Sky Sea Dragon King and dodged to the side with grave expressions.

“Die For me, You Lowly Thing!”

At this time, Sky Sea Dragon King roared, and terrifying golden lights suddenly appeared around the two universe knights of the Star River clan.

The golden light instantly attacked their bodies.

“What!”

Seeing the golden light that suddenly appeared around them, their faces were filled with shock.

Pu! Pu! Pu! Pu

However, there was no time for them to dodge. The golden light instantly entered his body, and his life force was completely gone.

“Two lowly humans still dare to provoke me, Dragon King.”

Sky Sea Dragon King roared coldly. He waved his arm, and the Dragon Palace quickly flew forward.

“What!”

“He killed two of our venerables. Who is he? The Tianhai Dragon King or the Tianhai Dragon King!”

“Hiss, the Tianhai Dragon King wants to invade our Xingjiang clan.”

Some disciples of the Xingjiang clan saw this and their faces changed. They growled in a low voice.

“Shut up, all of You Die!”

The Tianhai Dragon King flapped his huge wings and stood in the sky above the Dragon Palace. He glanced at the people who were looking at him and waved his arm.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The four Golden Dragon Phantoms attacked the surroundings.

The terrifying attack and speed caused everyone to be shocked.

“Run!”

“No, no, no!”

They looked terrified and wanted to run.

However, the Tianhai Dragon King’s attack wasn’t so easy to dodge.

They didn’t even manage to return to their own divine kingdom in an instant and were instantly killed.

“Enemies have invaded. Disciples of the Starriver clan, get ready.”

At this time, a loud shout came from the shrine on both sides of the seven-colored river.

More than ten universe knights flew over in an instant. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Behind them, legions of the Starriver clan flew over quickly.

“Call your Starriver clan’s clan leader over. Tell him to bring all his disciples to kneel in front of this Dragon King. Otherwise, they will die!”

Sky Sea Dragon King stared at the dozen universe knights flying over from the Starriver clan. His eyes were filled with killing intent as he ordered coldly.

“Arrogant, making our Starriver clan submit to you. Do you have the qualifications?”

“Sky Dragon King? Your Sky Dragon Clan has already been destroyed, yet you still dare to be arrogant.”

The Dozen Universe Knights flew over and stared at Sky Sea Dragon King.

The leader of the Star River Clan, a universe knight level three great being, had a cold look in his eyes.

“Lowly human, die! Remember, I Am Sky Sea Dragon King!”

Sky Sea Dragon King heard their address and instantly went berserk. His body moved and charged towards them.

At the position of his dragon head, a golden crown slowly appeared.

The crown glowed, and in the center was a blade crossed with a sword.

An illusory crown flew out from the top of his head and trapped over a dozen universe knights.

“HM? Be careful, he has the combat strength of a Level 4 universe Knight.”

“Dodge.”

The leader of the level 3 universe knights focused his gaze and immediately roared.

“Rustle!”

However, just as they were about to dodge, the blade on the crown of the Phantom suddenly flew out.

The blade slashed towards where they were.

“Hong!”

A dazzling golden blade light and blade light slashed across half of the starry sky.

“What!”

The Universe Knights of the Starriver clan were shocked.

Hong

The energy swept across, and more than ten corpses fell down.

They didn’t even scream.

“A bunch of ungrateful things, die!”

Sky Sea Dragon King was enraged. He moved and attacked the huge temples in front of him.

“Hide, the elders are killed. They are not his match. Hide!”

“He is not Sky Dragon King, he is Sky Sea Dragon King! Sky Sea Dragon King is not dead!”

In front of the Godly Palace, some universe knights who had rushed over saw that even a level three universe knight elder had been killed instantly. They looked shocked and shouted loudly.

From the words and actions of Sky Sea Dragon King, they also realized that this was not Sky Dragon King.

He called himself the Tianhai Dragon King, and it was very likely that he was the master of the Tianhai Dragon Palace, the Tianhai Dragon King.

As for why he took over the body of the Tianhai Dragon King, they had some vague guesses.

Seeing the incomparably Berserk Tianhai Dragon King and his terrifying might, their faces were filled with shock.

They hurriedly fled into the distance.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Rays of terrifying golden light shot towards the palaces in front of them.

The terrifying attacks instantly covered over a hundred thousand palaces.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

Under his terrifying attacks, all of the palaces instantly collapsed.

There were still a large number of people inside who didn’t have time to escape before they were directly killed.

“If you don’t submit, then die! Leave No one alive!”

The Tianhai Dragon King seemed to be in a crazed state as he roared wildly. One attack after another raged in the sky above the Xingjiang clan.

Each attack killed countless people and destroyed more than 100,000 palaces.

“Run, run, he’s a demon!”

“All disciples of the Xingjiang clan, run! Our clan leader is coming right now!”

All the experts of the Xingjiang clan saw this scene and their expressions changed drastically as they continued to roar.

Looking at the maniacal Tianhai Dragon King, their expressions were abnormally ugly.

“Impudent! Tianhai Dragon King, you actually dare to slaughter a disciple of my Xingjiang clan.”

Right at this moment, an angry roar sounded out from the distant void.

A hundred thousand feet tall Xingjiang clan patriarch with a scarlet sun on his head walked over.
