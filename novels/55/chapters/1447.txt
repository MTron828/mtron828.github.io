Chapter 1448: 1448, you are not qualified to sign it

The Barbarian dynasty was established!

The first barbarian emperor was the leader of the blood barbarian demon beasts.

This was not surprising to many people.

The humans had received news a few days ago that the blood barbarian demon beasts had won the battle between the three top forces not long ago.

Although many humans were worried about the blood barbarian demon beasts becoming royalty.

There was nothing they could do. This was not something they could stop.

However, when the king of the Wildlands announced the establishment of the Imperial City and the signing of the contract with the blood flow empire, everyone was stunned.

“Eh? What’s going on? Why did they sign the contract with the Blood Flow Empire?”

“Isn’t this the agreement with the humans? Why is it the blood flow empire? Did the demon beasts say something wrong?”

The barbaric emperor’s words caused all the humans to reveal stunned expressions as they discussed with their eyes wide open.

“Oh?”

Feng Luan, sect leader Ling, and everyone from the Flowing Emperor Alliance were also slightly stunned.

A bad premonition surged into everyone’s hearts.

Feng Luan frowned and immediately stood up. “Barbaric emperor, didn’t Your Demon Beast clan sign the peace agreement with the humans of the Flowing Sea Region?”

As she spoke, her gaze flickered as she stared at the Emperor of the Blood Barbaric Demon Beast.

On the side, the people of the blood flow empire looked over with smiles on their faces, revealing mocking expressions.

“That’s right, Emperor of the blood barbaric, didn’t you sign a peace agreement with the humans of the flowing sea region?”

Those neutral dynasties and sects were slightly shocked when they heard the words of the emperor of the wildlands, and their expressions were somewhat awkward as they asked.

Signing a peace agreement with the humans in the flowing sea region and signing a peace agreement with the Bloodflow Empire were two completely different concepts. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

This was especially true when the Wildlands Empire was established and the blood barbarian demon beasts were part of the royal family.

Everyone knew very well about the blood barbarian demon beasts. They were an extremely cruel and bloodthirsty Demon Beast Race.

They had always been the natural enemies of the humans.

If they only signed an agreement with the blood flow empire, it meant that they could kill humans other than the blood flow empire.

In this situation where three parties were standing at the same time, the Demon Beast race was the strongest.

If they attacked them, they had no room to resist.

“We want to sign a peace agreement with the humans. The blood flow empire can represent your human race!”

The emperor of the wildlands stared at Feng Luan with his pair of blood-red eyes. He opened his ferocious mouth and said coldly.

“Haha, the Emperor of the wildlands is right. Only the dynasty can speak with the dynasty as equals. Our blood flow empire can represent all the humans in the blood flow region!”

The blood emperor stood up and said with a loud laugh.

“Your blood flow empire can not represent the entire flowing sea region!”

Sect leader Ling stared at the Blood Emperor with an icy cold expression as he cried out in a deep voice.

“Our Demon Beast Desolate Empire will only sign a peace agreement with the blood flow empire. All of you are not qualified!”

The desolate emperor stood beside the Dragon Chair and looked down at the members of the Flowing Emperor Alliance. He announced in an incomparably cold and indifferent manner.

The words of the desolate emperor caused the expressions of everyone from the Flowing Emperor Alliance to change drastically. Their expressions instantly became ugly.

The expressions of those neutral factions also changed slightly. They all stared at the Flowing Emperor Alliance’s position.

“Emperor of the wildlands, what you mean is that in the future, you will become enemies with our flowing Emperor Alliance. You will even become like the humans and demonic beast race in the past!”

Feng Luan frowned and questioned with an ugly expression.

“I will answer your question on behalf of the Emperor of the wildlands. It might not take long. Haha!”

At this moment, the blood emperor stood up directly. His body moved and he floated in the sky as he laughed loudly.

As he spoke, his palm moved, and a crown that was emitting a brilliant light appeared in front of him.

On the Crown, there was a miniature picture of a Blood Savage Beast.

The entire crown was incomparably luxurious. It was obviously not inferior to a fourth or fifth level profound void tier weapon.

“King of the wildlands, this is a gift from our bloodflow empire to you. We, the Bloodflow Empire, congratulate you on the establishment of Your Empire!”

“We also congratulate you, the blood barbarians, on becoming a member of the imperial clan. We wish for the friendship between Bloodflow and the Wildlands!”

As he spoke, he waved his arm and the resplendent crown flew towards the location of the king of the wildlands.

“Roar Roar, thank you, Blood Emperor. Today, our Wildlands Empire announces that we will sign a peace agreement with the Bloodflow Empire. In the future, all the demon beasts of the Wildlands Empire and all the humans of the Bloodflow Empire will definitely not have any conflict or fight. As for the humans outside of the bloodflow empire, we can not guarantee that!”!

The blood barbarian emperor took the resplendent crown and also roared with joy.

“Haha, Good!”

The blood emperor laughed loudly and his eyes were filled with killing intent as he looked towards the direction of the Drifting Emperor Alliance.

“What? What is the meaning of this? Is... is the Barbarian Empire going to form an alliance with the Blood Flow Empire?”

“This is obvious. In the future, the Barbarian Empire will continue to fight with the humans other than the forces of the blood flow empire. With the strength of the Barbarian Empire, how are we going to resist?”

“This... this... is they trying to kill us?”

As soon as the desolate dynasty and the blood emperor finished speaking, the expressions of the tens of millions of humans around them changed drastically.

Many people revealed terrified expressions as they cried out involuntarily.

The desolate dynasty’s words were extremely obvious!

Next, other than the Bloodflow dynasty, the rest of the humans were still their enemies and targets for them to devour.

Moreover, the blood flow empire and the desolate empire had clearly reached an agreement.

In the future, this would be a disaster for the forces outside of the blood flow empire.

The expressions of all the experts of the blood flow alliance changed drastically. They looked at the people of the blood flow empire who were filled with killing intent, and their faces were filled with vigilance.

“Haha, everyone, don’t be anxious. Today, our blood flow empire will open its doors and welcome anyone and any force to join us!”

The Blood Emperor looked at the terrified expressions of the tens of millions of people around him. The corners of his mouth curled up and a glint flashed across his eyes.

He floated in the sky and spoke to all the factions.

His words caused the neutral factions to be stunned and their expressions changed drastically.

At this moment, they were 100% sure that the blood flow empire and the desolate dynasty had already reached an agreement.

They were forcing them to join the Bloodflow Empire!

This caused the expressions of the experts from the neutral forces to change as they discussed in low voices.

“Everyone, we don’t have much time. After the establishment of the desolate empire, there will be a bloody ceremony. We only have three minutes!”

As the Blood Emperor spoke, he looked at the emperor of the desolate empire.

“Roar Roar, that’s right. We only have three minutes. Next, we will hold the founding ceremony of the Demon Beast Dynasty. It will be a carnival!”

The Barbarian Emperor roared with his mouth wide open. His long tongue stuck out and licked his lips.

It was hideous and terrifying!

A bloody ceremony?

Carnival?

At this moment, everyone was shocked!
