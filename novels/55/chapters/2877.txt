Chapter 2878: 2,878 seconds

“That’s the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. He looks so young!”

“Look at that Dragon King. If you don’t look closely, it’s as if he doesn’t exist. But if you look closely at him, he’s so eye-catching. I have to say, this dragon king is really handsome. He has a powerful aura about him!”

“The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace actually came to our holy region. It seems like he has a very good relationship with our red wind divine emperor.”

“It seems that the celestial emperor of the imperial court and the eight barrens are still here. This… The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace might not know that the eight barrens and the imperial court have joined forces!”

“If the three major forces of the imperial court and the eight Barrens form an alliance to attack the Dragon Palace, it would be difficult for the Dragon Palace to resist.”

“At this time, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace coming over is not a good thing for our holy region.”

When the experts and disciples of the holy region around the Holy Tower saw the arrival of Wang Xian and the rest, their eyes were filled with shock, curiosity, and astonishment.

The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace was here personally!

He was the leader of the top three forces in the starry sky.

However, from their point of view, the current situation of the Dragon Palace was a little dangerous. It was even extremely dangerous.

Once the three forces joined forces to attack the Dragon Palace, the Dragon Palace would probably encounter a huge calamity.

“I came late to cultivate in the dragon palace. Congratulations on advancing to celestial thearch.”

Wang Xian heard the discussions around him clearly. He didn’t take it to heart. He came to the front of Hong Fengyan and the rest and said with a smile.

“The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace has given me a lot of face by coming here.”

Hong Fengyan smiled and gestured to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian smiled and followed them to the top of the Holy Tower.

Everyone’s gaze was also on the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace following the Red Wind Celestial Emperor into the Holy Tower.

“This is a big event. The Imperial Court’s Shaman Association and the eight Barrens Celestial Emperor just reminded us of the Red Wind Celestial Emperor during the ceremony. Now, the Red Wind Celestial Emperor has received the Dragon King!”

“The arrival of the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is going to shake the entire holy region.”

Everyone looked at them as they entered the Holy Tower. Their eyes were filled with astonishment.

“Boss Wang, you’re finally here. We thought you weren’t coming.”

At the top level of the Holy Tower, invincible battle technique said with a smile.

“I lost track of time in my cultivation. I didn’t expect you to achieve a breakthrough so quickly, Hong Fengyan!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“This is all thanks to that wind jade of yours.”

Hong Fengyan said with a smile. She waved her hand and asked her disciple to prepare some food.

“By the way, do you know about the alliance between the eight barren and the imperial court? This situation is not good for the Dragon Palace.”

After everyone sat down, the celestial emperor of Shangshui reminded Wang Xian.

“I’ll know more on the way.”

Wang Xian nodded slightly and looked at Hong Fengyan. “Yesterday, the Celestial Emperor of the imperial court and the eight barren threatened you during the ceremony?”

“I can’t say that it was a threat. He warned us, the holy region, not to get involved in the matters between the two of you. Hehe, the Holy Region is the holy region, and I am me.”

“Our Holy Master will not stop me from deciding certain matters.”

Hong Fengyan said with a smile. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“There is no need for you to get involved in this matter.”

Wang Xian shook his head and said with a smile.

“Boss Wang, the three major forces are working together. Will the Dragon Palace be able to withstand it?”

Invincible battle technique came over and asked with concern.

“Although it’s unexpected that the eight desolates and the imperial court of the Wizard Association are working together so quickly, the dragon palace can still handle it.”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“It’s good that they can handle it. Don’t you know that those two guys were very arrogant yesterday?”

Invincible battle technique said from the side.

“Is that so?”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly.

“This is a small matter. They are just putting on an act. They don’t dare to be arrogant in our holy region. They are also afraid of forcing us to the Dragon Palace’s side.”

Hong Fengyan shook her head nonchalantly.

“Master, the dishes are here. Dragon King, this is the most famous delicacy in our holy region.”

At this moment, ye Luying walked over and said with a smile on her face.

“Haha, the Number One dish in the holy region. I want to have a good taste of it.”

The celestial emperor of Shangshui said with a smile.

While Wang Xian and the rest were chatting and eating, the entire holy region was in an uproar because of his arrival.

In the Holy Region, the communication equipment was also using an AI.

Now, the entire AI was filled with news about the arrival of the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.

Everyone in the holy region was extremely surprised by the arrival of the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King.

“What is the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King doing here? Could it be that he wants our holy region to stand on the same side as their Dragon Palace?”

“It’s really possible. Otherwise, the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King would have arrived yesterday. They might have found out that bhang had allied with the imperial court’s Shaman Association, so they wanted to become allies with us!”

“Yesterday, during the emperor-becoming ceremony of God Emperor Red Wind, the two god Emperors of the imperial court, Bhang, were indeed a little disappointed. Their words also carried a hint of threat. However, our sacred Lord also said that he would not participate in the war between them.”

“The Dragon Palace is courting death. Please don’t Drag US along. Our holy region has always been peaceful.”

On the AI, everyone in the Holy Region was discussing the arrival of the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.

“Holy Lord, Lord Red Wind and the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace are in the Holy Tower. Now that Lord Red Wind is so close to the Dragon King, could it be…”

At the same time, a few protectors of the Holy Region stood respectfully in front of the Holy Lord and reported the news.

“Ignore them. If the Dragon King wants to visit me, just say that I’m not here.”

The Sacred Lord held his scepter and leaned back on his chair as he said with a twinkle in his eyes.

“Yes!”

The few protectors nodded in agreement, and they understood a little.

The Sacred Lord’s refusal to meet the Dragon King was also a signal to the two celestial emperors of the imperial court.

However, if God Emperor Hong Feng insisted on helping the Dragon Palace, they had no choice.

“God Emperor Shen Wu, we’ve received news that the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace has also come here.”

In a luxurious sky garden not far from the Central Palace of the Sacred Kingdom, a divine emperor from the eight barrens held an artificial intelligence in his hand and said to divine emperor Shenwu, who was sitting in the study and drinking.

“Oh?”

Divine Emperor Shenwu’s eyes focused, and he slowly stood up.

“Divine Emperor Hongfeng has personally received the Dragon King and is now at the Sacred Tower.”

“Obviously, Divine Emperor Hongfeng didn’t take our words to heart.”

The eight desolation God Emperor’s gaze was somewhat cold as he spoke.

“Then what about the sacred territory sacred master’s side? What’s their reaction?”

God Emperor Shen Wu’s face carried a trace of killing intent as he coldly asked.

“There’s no reaction from the sacred master’s side.”

The eight desolation God Emperor shook his head.

“Since that’s the case, then we’ll go over and ask God Emperor Hong Feng what he means. He just broke through to become a god emperor, yet he wants to court death?”

God Emperor Shen Wu said with a sinister tone.

“Alright. If she really wants to become our enemy, then don’t blame us for making things difficult for her. Don’t blame us for not being polite either.”

The eight desolation God Emperor nodded in agreement.

The two of them moved and flew directly towards the sacred tower.
