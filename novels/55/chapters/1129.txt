Chapter 1130: On the 1131 undercurrent assassin organization

Translator: 5496903

“Where is that?”

Star-moon kingdom was located at the seaside. Bright Moon City’s terrain was somewhat similar to East Sea city.

It was close to the vast ocean.

However, when they flew over, they saw a shocking scene two to three kilometers into the ocean.

In the ocean, there were at least tens of thousands of densely packed martial artists.

Even at the edge of the city, there were tens of thousands of people standing there looking at the location of the ocean.

Wang Xian looked over with a shocked expression on his face.

In the ocean, there was a building that was a hundred meters tall floating on the surface of the ocean. It was similar to a tower in the city.

The entire body of the building was aqua blue and emitted a strong water elemental energy.

The building that appeared out of thin air on the ocean naturally attracted everyone’s attention.

“It’s a formation. Moreover, it’s a very powerful formation. One corner of the formation was destroyed, so it revealed a little of the situation inside.”

Feng Luan’s eyes flickered as she stared at the location of the building. The two of them flew towards the seaside together.

“Eh? There are quite a number of experts?”

When Wang Xian and the rest approached the seaside, he swept his gaze across them and revealed a surprised expression.

Around them, there were four insightful emptiness realm experts, half-step insightful emptiness realm experts, and even transcendent level nine experts. There were dozens of them in total.

“There are thirteen insightful emptiness realm experts in the royal family of Star Moon Kingdom. There are two here. There is one insightful emptiness realm expert from Heavenly Moon sect and one from the royal family of Fengxiao Kingdom!”

Feng Luan’s gaze swept across them and her voice rang in Wang Xian’s ears.

“The people of the Fengxiao kingdom are here as well?”

Wang Xian revealed a hint of surprise.

“The Fengxiao Kingdom is close to star Moon Kingdom and is slightly stronger than Star Moon Kingdom. In the past, the Fengxiao kingdom was very strong. However, after the break with the phoenix-eyed demonic beast clan, half of the insightful emptiness realm experts of the Fengxiao Kingdom died in that huge battle!”

As Feng Luan spoke, she looked at Wang Xian who was beside her.

Now, the fengeyed clan was Wang Xian’s subordinate, a member of the Dragon Palace, and the former Fengeyed clan. They had a good relationship with the Fengxiao Kingdom.

However, as the Fengxiao Kingdom grew stronger at that time, they wanted the bloodline of the fengeyed clan’s Demon Beast. As a result, a series of conflicts occurred.

In the end, for some unknown reason, the fengeyed clan and the royal family of the Fengxiao Kingdom had a huge battle.

More than half of the Wind Howl Kingdom had lost their insightful emptiness realm experts. On the other hand, almost all of the Wind Eye clan’s insightful emptiness realm experts had been wiped out.

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly. He didn’t know much about the past of the Wind Eye clan.

“This formation is so powerful. Even the expert at level three of the insightful emptiness realm in the wind howl kingdom was unable to open the formation.”

“This is a combination formation. A combination formation at level three of the insightful emptiness realm. The formation covers an area of ten kilometers around the entire island. To break it, five to six insightful emptiness realm experts must join forces!”

“This formation is really impressive. I wonder who left this island or what faction it belongs to!”

“I wonder how long this island has been drifting in the ocean!”

“I heard that the royal family of star-moon kingdom will send another expert of the void interpretation stage today. If we wait any longer, more experts will come!”

In the surroundings, the martial artists were conversing softly.

Wang Xian looked over. His eyes were flashing with a demonic luster. The outline of an island appeared in his line of sight.

However, due to his low strength, even the light-dark fire dragon eyes could not see what was inside.

However, with Wang Xian’s abhijna, the light-dark no formation, he could ignore the formation outside and enter directly.

The group of strange demons could also follow him and enter directly.

He didn’t choose to enter rashly. It was a mysterious island. No one knew the situation inside. If there were void-seeing creatures inside, it would be suicide to enter!

“Can you break this formation?” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Wang Xian asked Feng Luan who was beside him.

“Yes, I can. However, when I break the formation, others will notice me. Moreover, once the formation is broken, others can enter as well!”

Feng Luan nodded her head with a contemplative look on her face.

“Judging from their looks, it will be difficult for them to break the formation within a short period of time. Let’s go to Bright Moon City First!”

Wang Xian said to Feng Luan.

She nodded her head and the two of them flew straight into Bright Moon City.

When they arrived at Bright Moon City, they realized that the city was a little crowded. City guards were patrolling around vigilantly.

It was obvious that the arrival of so many strong people had put a huge pressure on the security of Bright Moon City.

“Find a place to stay. We will stay in Bright Moon City for a few days!”

Wang Xian said to Feng Luan. He wanted to wait for the arrival of the DRAKONIDS before he started to set up the dragon assassin organization in Bright Moon City.

“Sure!”

Feng Luan nodded. She also knew the strength of the dragon assassin organization.

This was a force that made her very envious. Once this assassin group was fully developed, the power of the Dragon Assassin Group would be an existence that could shake the world.

“What a coincidence. Our restaurant only has one room left. Now, in the entire Bright Moon City, only the western region’s restaurant still has rooms. The other restaurants are all full!”

Entering a restaurant, the manager smiled at them and said.

There was only one room in the legends. A man and a woman living together in the same room?

The truth was the same.

“Yes, cultivate in the room for the next few days!”

Feng Luan said expressionlessly.

With their cultivation level, cultivation could replace rest. Their bodies were free from dirt and didn’t need to be cleaned. There was nothing inconvenient about it!

“Alright, Please Come Upstairs!”

The shopkeeper brought them to the third floor with a smile and opened a room for them.

“You have to settle your matters as soon as possible!”

She looked at Wang Xian and reminded him.

“Hehe, within two days, I will command the Dragon Assassin organization to shake the entire Bright Moon City!”

Wang Xian said confidently.

“There are many strong people in Bright Moon city now. Be careful!”

Feng Luan reminded him.

Ao Yao, who was the strongest, was able to avoid the detection of a level 1 Seethrough void martial artist. However, a level 2 Seethrough void martial artist could already sense him.

“I know!”

Wang Xian nodded his head with a solemn expression.

The good thing was that the forty strange demons that he brought this time were the forty strongest among the strange demons.

Twenty of them had the ability to assassinate a level nine supernatural realm expert, while the other twenty had the ability to assassinate a level eight supernatural realm expert.

There was also Ao Yao.

“Young master, Miss!”

Wang Xian ordered some food. Feng Luan was constantly paying attention to the information in Bright Moon City. She held the communication stone plate and kept checking.

Not long after, there was the sound of knocking on the door as well as some noisy conversations.

“What’s Wrong?”

Wang Xian opened the door and asked a waiter curiously.

Behind the waiter stood three young men and a group of middle-aged men.

“I’m very sorry, sir. Our restaurant has to vacate the entire third floor!”

The waiter at the door said to Wang Xian with a smile on his face.
