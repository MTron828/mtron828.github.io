2651 2651 Emperor’s daughter

“Wang Xian, let’s Go!”

The next morning, the voice of the Emperor’s daughter rang out from outside!

Wang Xian opened his eyes and walked out of the room!

Bei Shuang also came out from the room at the side!

“Eh? The outfit today is very cool.”

Wang Xian looked at the emperor’s daughter who was wearing a fiery red armor and couldn’t help but size her up!

The soft armor that was close to her body made her look more valiant!

Coupled with her perfect appearance, it made her look different.

“Not bad, not bad.”

He smiled and nodded his head.

“Pervert.”

Di Xingnu pursed her lips.

“Xingnu, let’s go.”

At this moment, Di Xingnu’s mother said with a smile from the side!

“Let’s Go!”

Di Xingnu said. She went straight to the crane and stood on it!

Wang Xian and bei Shuang each stood on a crane and flew towards the vast palace!

The crane flew into the sky. Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and realized that there were a lot of people in the sky today!

All of them were elders with some young men and women!

At a glance, there were at least a few million people!

“I estimate that there will be a million people participating in the assessment for this generation of the imperial court!”

Wang Xian mumbled to himself. There were at least a few hundred million people in the current generation of the imperial court. Among these hundreds of millions of people, the disciples who thought they had the ability would come and participate in the Grand Competition and test!

Even if they could not become the sons and daughters of the imperial court and could not be ranked in the top 100, there would still be a lot of resources and treasures.

Moreover, if they were lucky, they might be taken in by the powerhouses of the imperial court and be accepted as their disciples.

All of these were possible.

Wang Xian and the rest flew to the front of the palace very quickly.

When they arrived at the palace, everyone came down immediately.

Flying was prohibited in the sky above the vast palace.

The group of people below gave off an extremely small feeling.

The entire vast palace seemed to be inhabited by giants. An ordinary palace was more than 10,000 meters tall!

Every pillar was incomparably huge.

In the surroundings, some people looked around with reverence and exclaimed.

Those who entered the palace were slightly quiet. Even their voices were not loud.

“The material of this palace might not be able to be broken by an expert who has just stepped into the Immortal King Realm.”

Wang Xian sized up the surroundings and was slightly shocked in his heart.

The faction that had stood tall in the emperor star field for hundreds of millions of years was indeed extraordinary.

The people around them walked for ten minutes as if they were worshiping the Emperor Star Field. Then, they arrived at an extremely huge square.

The entire square was surrounded by staircases for the ceremony. In the middle of the staircases, there was an extremely huge bell.

The bell was over 10,000 meters tall and it was emitting a faint aura. There were thunderbolts revolving on the bell!

“Go to the front of the observation stairs.”

The Empress Star Lady said. She quickened her pace and walked towards the front!

Wang Xian and the rest followed behind. They stood there after they arrived.

The Empress Star Lady’s mother patted her head and didn’t say anything. She sized up the disciples of the imperial court who had entered one by one.

Wang Xian and bei Shuang stood behind her and also looked around.

The selection of the Empress and the son of the same generation of the imperial court’s disciples was a major event for the entire imperial court.

There were many people who came to watch the ceremony, especially the relatives of the disciples who were participating in the competition. They stood on the viewing stairs and watched.

This time, the competition was comparable to the civil servants examination on Earth!

Wang Xian and the rest stood there. More and more people arrived. An hour later, the number of people gathered around had reached over ten million people.

In the front row, there were young men and women who were sizing each other up!

“The disciples from the vast palace are here.”

“Among the disciples who live in the vast palace, the men are Di Jiu, Di Hun Ge, and Di Ming who are stronger. As for the women, they are stronger with di suiting.”

“It’s very likely that the emperor and the Empress will be born among them this time.”

“That might not be the case. In the past competitions, there have always been dark horses emerging from the Emperor’s daughter. The emperor’s daughter might not be them.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

...

“That’s right. I heard that the Emperor’s daughter is very powerful and her influence is also very strong. She should have a place today and even compete for the title of the Emperor’s daughter.”

At this moment, a group of young men and women walked over. There were several thousand people in total!

These people could be said to be the core of this grand competition. At the same time, they were also the core disciples of this generation.

Living in the vast palace meant that their parents were very powerful. Their natural resources were also much more than the other disciples.

Many disciples looked at the young men and women in front of them and discussed in low voices.

These young men and women were the people of their generation who were more powerful and had more influence.

They were the ones who had the ability to compete for the position of the Emperor’s daughter.

There were a few thousand people in the group. They raised their heads slightly and swept their gaze around. There was a hint of pride on their faces.

“HMM?”

Wang Xian looked over and landed his gaze on one of the young men. A glint flashed across his eyes.

He had learned about this young man from the memory of an expert from the Blazing Flame Divine Empire!

...

At the same time, he was also the young man who sent the Blazing Flame Divine Empire to destroy their Dragon Palace a few years ago!

Looking at that young man, a cold look flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes!

“Look, they are heading to their respective forces.”

The few thousand young men and women arrived. A large portion of them headed straight for the front of the stairs!

At the front of the stairs, the middle-aged elders saw them walking over and bowed respectfully.

These were all powers that their disciples had nurtured.

“Every generation of the Emperor Court has a few exceptional disciples, not only are they strong, they also have a group of followers!”

“Undying Level 4, I wonder if they are hiding their strength.”

Beside the Emperor Star Lady, her mother sighed as she looked at the group of people behind the disciples.

She could sense that these disciples of the imperial court who were less than 5,000 years old had quite a strong influence.

Some powerhouses and even some influences were willing to follow these elite disciples!

This was because once these disciples of the imperial court gained influence in the future, they would also gain a lot of benefits.

This also allowed those god Lord level disciples to have the immortal god King’s subordinates.

“It seems that the celestial maiden is destined to become the celestial maiden!”

Wang Xian glanced around and patted the Celestial Maiden’s shoulder with a smile on his face!

“In terms of strength, I think I’m stronger than them. If It’s a faction, please take good care of me, Dragon King!”

When the celestial maiden heard his words, a smile appeared on her face as she looked at Wang Xian who was beside her!

“Isn’t it a little too late for you to know how to suck up to me now?”

Wang Xian looked at her with a smile!

“It’s not too late. Sister Yinxuan told you to take care of me!”

The Celestial Maiden said with a smile on her face!

“Don’t Worry!”

Wang Xian patted her shoulder!

For No other reason, Wang Xian would have helped the celestial maiden when she saved Qing Yue and Lingxiu back then!

Moreover, his relationship with the Celestial Maiden was pretty good now!

He would naturally help her with this small favor!
