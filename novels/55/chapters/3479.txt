Buzz

Wang Xian sensed that the netherworld ghost avatar had suffered a heavy blow. With a thought, the Netherworld Ghost Avatar returned to his body instantly.

In the Dragon Palace, the ancestral tree’s soul-returning wood branch emitted a gray glow, nourishing the Netherworld Ghost Avatar’s injuries.

At this moment, he had already rushed to the front of the pink finger bone. The Five Elements Millstone was the first to collide with it.

Wang Xian’s body trembled. Numerous chains instantly sealed the surrounding area.

“Bang!”

The pink skeleton finger seemed to have sensed the pressure from the five elements millstone and immediately flew backward.

It directly struck the surrounding chains.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

On the Five Elements Millstone, the five divine dragons roared. The millstone revolved and the green dragon stuck its head out. Numerous thorns attacked the pink finger bone.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The attack of the pink finger bone was extremely terrifying. When it collided with Wang Xian’s chain, the chain let out a cracking sound.

This made Wang Xian’s eyes focused as he flew over quickly.

When the pink finger bone had just broken through the chain’s defense, the branches wrapped around it and restrained it.

“Boom!”

However, at this moment, the tiny finger bone burst into violent flames. The terrifying flames caused the branches to turn black.

“Roar! Roar!”

The five elements were grinding against each other. The fire god Dragon roared and spewed out flames towards the branches to block the flames from the finger bone!

At this moment, Wang Xian rushed over. His palm turned into light, which condensed into a point and attacked the pink finger bone.

“Bang!”

“Ah!”

The terrifying penetration and collision rang out.

A shrill sound of pain could be heard from within the finger bone.

Wang Xian focused his gaze. A bright and magnificent dragon horn condensed above his head. The Dragon Horn locked onto the pink finger bone and attacked once again.

Buzz

However, the finger bone trembled violently. Pitch-black claws appeared around him.

Each claw seemed to come from Hell as it attacked Wang Xian and the five elements millstone.

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly. With a wave of his arm, the five elements millstone flew into his hand.

Waves of five elements power surged into the five elements millstone and a terrifying energy was injected into it.

The Five Elements Millstone was accompanied by five divine dragons that roared.

Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. The five attribute swords slashed towards the pink finger bone.

The surrounding hell claws collapsed one by one under the sharp swords. Although two of the five attribute swords had dissipated, there were still three that landed on them.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

“Ah! Ah!”

The painful screams continued to ring out. There was a hint of brutality in the voice.

“Void realm-breaking finger!”

At this moment, five words suddenly came from the pink finger bone. Following that, Wang Xian sensed that there seemed to be a terrifying change in his surroundings.

His surroundings seemed to have changed into the void of the universe. There was nothing in this endless void except for a finger pointing at his head!

This powerful and strange attack made Wang Xian’s heart skip a beat!

“How can this pink finger bone be so terrifying?”

His expression was a little solemn as he hurriedly picked up the five elements millstone in his hand.

A huge amount of five elements power surged into it. The five elements revolved and turned into the Earth attribute.

The earth dragon slowly entrenched itself and completely surrounded Wang Xian.

“Bang!”

A tremendous force was transmitted over. Wang Xian could feel his body flying backward rapidly.

Everything around him was restored once again. His body flew backward and collided with countless dry bones.

The energy of the pink finger bone dimmed a little and was about to flee into the distance!

Crack! Crack! Crack

The incipient sacred wings on Wang Xian’s body flapped violently. A force of wind and thunder instantly landed on it.

He steadied his body and chased after it immediately.

This finger bone was definitely a treasure.

Even if he couldn’t use it, he could at least increase the combat strength of a level two universe dominator in the Dragon Palace after being absorbed by the Dragon Transformation Pool.

The void seeking enemy had already attached itself to the pink finger bone. Wang Xian exerted his speed to the maximum.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

The pink finger bone was the size of an ordinary human’s finger. Its speed was abnormally fast inside.

Wang Xian quickly shrunk his body size and followed behind.

Shrinking one’s body size was maintained by energy. Furthermore, shrinking one’s body size did not mean that one’s strength would not change.

Otherwise, wouldn’t it be better for a strong person to become a needle than a large creature?

After all, the smaller one was, the stronger one’s penetrating force would be!

This was not the case. This involved the circulation of the energy in one’s body.

There was still a gap between Wang Xian in his human form and his divine dragon form.

Although the gap was not huge, he was still slightly stronger in his divine dragon form.

Wang Xian followed behind him. In just ten minutes, he could not see the pink finger bones at all.

However, Wang Xian relied on the power of wind and thunder to lock down his enemies. He quickly sensed and chased after them.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

Wherever he passed by, a terrifying sound spread to the surroundings.

Some of the powerhouses in the land of devil bones sensed Wang Xian’s undisguised energy and hurriedly hid far away.

Wang Xian did not have any scruples. After all, if he were to encounter a powerhouse with the combat strength of a level three master of the universe, he would only be considered unlucky.

He continued to give chase from behind. Time passed by little by little.

After pursuing him for more than two months, Wang Xian could already feel that he had arrived at a place far away.

This place did not even have any information about the spiritual demon race.

This made him cautious.

He made the already recovered ghost avatar in front while he was at the back.

After advancing for another ten days based on the ability to search for enemies in the void, he finally arrived in front of the pink finger bone.

Wang Xian immediately stopped and looked ahead.

The Ghost Avatar also stopped.

“The condition of the pink finger bone should be no different from being injured. I can see if I can seal it up!”

Wang Xian mumbled and instructed the ghost avatar to bring the five elements millstone to the left.

Ten minutes later, the Ghost Avatar and the Five Elements Millstone arrived behind the pink finger bone.

According to the information brought by the enemy search in the void, the pink finger bone was located in the middle.

“As long as I capture it, it will be a great harvest!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled as he began to approach slowly, concealing his figure.

The Ghost Avatar was also approaching the opposite position.

Crash

When Wang Xian was about to approach the finger bone, it seemed to have sensed something and immediately flew away from Wang Xian.

It was also the place where the ghost avatar and the Five Elements Millstone were.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian sensed it and no longer had any cover. He quickly increased his speed. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Boom! Boom! Boom

He flew away quickly while the ghost avatar and the Five Elements Millstone hid themselves rapidly and waited for the pink finger bone to charge over.

Bang

When he was within the attack range of the ghost avatar and the pink finger bone, a terrifying attack immediately erupted!
