Chapter 1664: 1664, the real killer 2

The room fell silent. Feng Yun and the five clan elders sat there with unpleasant expressions.

“Fight? Young master Wang, the problem is that we can’t win even if we fight!”

One of the clan elders said with a bitter expression.

“Young master Wang, do you have any ideas?”

Feng Yun looked at Wang Xian and asked after a moment of hesitation.

“We can still fight. As long as my strength breaks through and I reach longevity, the two major forces wouldn’t be enough!”

Wang Xian said with a twinkle in his eyes.

As long as he could achieve a breakthrough once, he would be able to resolve the current predicament of the fire lark tribe!

“Young master Wang, you have achieved a breakthrough?”

Feng Yun was slightly taken aback as she looked at Wang Xian in astonishment.

When she met Wang Xian a few years ago, he was merely at the extraordinary realm. However, in less than four years, he actually said that he wanted to achieve a breakthrough and attain longevity.

This made her feel incredulous.

“Young master Wang, do you need any help to break through?”

Feng Yun asked directly.

“Pills, a large number of pills. There are at least 5,000 pills at the level of the ninth-level void interpretation!”

Wang Xian did not hide anything and said directly.

“Hiss, 5,000 pills at the level of the ninth-level void interpretation, this...”

Feng Yun and the five elders took a deep breath and frowned.

“Even if we take out all the savings of our fire cloud sparrow clan, we can only take out 1,000 level nine void interpretation pills!”

One of the elders said.

“Regarding the issue of resources, I will think of a way myself. From now on, I will act without any scruples!”

“If the patriarchs of the three major forces come, we can only prepare to escape!”

Wang Xian looked at Feng Yun and said.

“Let’s do it. As the personal guard of the empress, it won’t be easy for anyone to break into our Fire Cloud Mountain!”

“If worst comes to worst, I will lead everyone into the Nirvana Cave!”

Feng Yun nodded his head heavily. His eyes were filled with coldness.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. “Senior Feng Yun, I will leave First!”

He stood up, nodded his head and left immediately.

“I hope the demon god from the demon God tribe doesn’t make a move, or else...”

Seeing Wang Xian leave, an elder said weakly.

“Let’s go to Fengtian City!”

Wang Xian flew out of the Fire Cloud City and headed towards Fengtian City.

Since the Fire Cloud Sparrow tribe was forced to such a state, there was no need for him to be afraid of anything.

The dragon Spike could be used to assassinate anyone without fear this time.

After entering the fire cloud forest, Wang Xian activated his yin-yang and five elements dragon eyes.

He used the power of light and darkness to hide his aura.

Under his extreme concealment, even the detection formation could not detect his existence.

“HMM? Fengtian city is completely sealed. The news of the annihilation of the people from the three major forces must have spread to Fengtian City!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. He looked at the one-eyed bird that was circling around the city. He hid himself and entered the city.

He glanced at the center of the city and smiled. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Five experts in the longevity realm were gathered there!

More than 20 elders at level nine of the Seethrough realm were also there!

He moved and arrived at a restaurant in the center of the city.

“The people of the demon God tribe have just arrived, but they were all exterminated. My God, the Fire Cloud Sparrow tribe is too violent!”

“All the heaven’s favorites and Outstanding Disciples of the Life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop were also killed. This time, the younger generation of the two major forces was almost exterminated!”

“It’s such a good arena battle, but the Fire Cloud Sparrow tribe actually set up an ambush. How despicable!”

“The fire Yunque tribe is now completely provoked. We have to be more careful when we go out!”

“The fire Yunque tribe is now accelerating their own death. The people they killed are the elite core disciples of the Demon God tribe. That is the demon God tribe of the nine God Empire!”

When Wang Xian entered the restaurant, he heard voices of discussion.

He narrowed his eyes slightly and a cold glint flashed across his eyes.

An ambush by the fire Lark Clan?

Hehe!

“Waiter, please serve some good tea and dishes!”

Wang Xian sat in a corner and said to the waiter beside him.

“Alright, sir, Please Wait a moment!”

...

Plop

“Sir Demon God, this matter is our fault. We didn’t know that they had a half-step Wanshou master hiding there. All the elite disciples of our life and Death Elixir Workshop and holy item forging workshop were also killed!”

However, at this moment, in the center of the city, more than twenty old men were kneeling on the ground, their faces covered in cold sweat.

Five of the old men in the center had similarly unsightly and shocked expressions.

In front of them was an image. In the image, a black-robed old man with golden stripes embroidered on his body sat in the center.

The old man’s eyes were a little cloudy, but there was a willful, unruly, and arrogant charm.

Beside the old man, one was wearing a white robe with a spirit tree on it.

The other old man was wearing a fiery-red soft armor that emitted a mysterious energy.

The white-robed old man was the medicine master of the life and Death Pill Workshop!

The soft-armored old man was the tool Master of the Holy Item Forging Workshop!

These two were the top experts of the continent who had lived for seven to eight thousand years.

And the identity of the person who could sit in the middle in front of them was obvious.

The Demon God of the nine God Empire.

And a new demon god.

Even the medicine master and weapon master looked at the demon god beside them with some trepidation.

This demon god was the newly risen demon god of the demon God tribe.

He had just risen up, but he had already suppressed the old demon god and almost killed him.

He was wild, overbearing, and crazy. No one in the demon God tribe dared to refute his words.

Logically speaking, there was no need for the five half-step Wanshou experts from the life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop to kneel down when they saw a wanshou expert.

However, in front of this crazy demon god, they could only tremble in fear.

“Keke, the people of our demon God tribe were killed as soon as we went over. I really don’t know whether I should say that the people of our demon God tribe are trash, or that the two major forces are trash!”

The Demon God smiled coldly and said.

With that, the expressions of medicine master and weapon master became slightly awkward.

“As expected of the craziest demon god!”

The two of them looked at each other and their hearts trembled slightly.

“Demon God, this matter is the fault of our two great forces. We can not absolve ourselves of the responsibility for causing the death of the demon God tribe’s disciples. We are willing to compensate them!”

The weapon master said to the Demon God.

“Why are you looking for me? Do you want me to help you exterminate the Fire Cloud Sparrow Tribe?”

The Demon God suddenly changed the topic and asked them.

The weapon master and the medicine master were slightly stunned. They could not keep up with the brain circuits of this demon god.

“Yes, we want to invite the Demon God to help us. A few days ago, we visited sacred fire ancestor. He clearly stated that he would not help the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan!”

The weapon master directly said.
