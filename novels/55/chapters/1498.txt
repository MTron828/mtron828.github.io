Chapter 1499: 1499 sanction?

“Haha, brother Wang Xian, I haven’t seen you for two years. You haven’t changed at all!”

He Yuan patted Wang Xian’s shoulder happily and laughed out loud.

“You haven’t changed either. You even found a wife!”

Wang Xian patted he Yuan’s shoulder with a smile.

“Haha, you two have met. I’m not as good as your brother!”

He Yuan winked at Wang Xian, implying that he had a few wives.

Wang Xian smiled.

He had not seen his friend for more than two years. Now that they had met again, he felt closer to him.

“Come, Xiao Qing, let me introduce you to my good brother who I made friends with in the Liuhai District!”

“This brother of mine is very powerful. Even I was convinced by him back then!”

“I didn’t expect this brother of mine to be able to come today on my birthday. I’m very happy!”

He Yuan looked at he suiqing with a smile on his face. Then, he looked at Wang Xian happily. “Brother Wang Xian, let me introduce you. This is my fiancée, he suiqing!”

Stunned, shocked!

Dumbfounded!

Everyone around, including he suiqing, looked at him with a confused expression.

They had never expected that this young man who dared to provoke young master he Feng, who dared to reject miss he suiqing, was actually young master he Yuan’s good brother. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Moreover, judging from young master he Yuan’s happy expression, it was obvious that the two of them had a good relationship.

“I didn’t expect this young master to be the brother of Xiao Yuan. No wonder he has such a personality. It was my fault for what happened just now. Young master Wang Xian, I’m really sorry!”

He suiqing reacted quickly. He bowed to Wang Xian with a smile on his face to express his apology.

“Huh? What’s Wrong?”

He Yuan asked in surprise.

“Nothing. Just now, your fiancée wanted to buy a pet cub from me. I didn’t agree to it. Later, I wanted to say that this was a gift for you, but I was interrupted. It’s nothing!”

Wang Xian nodded at he suiqing and explained with a smile.

He suiqing also smiled. Just now, Wang Xian was interrupted by He Feng when he was talking.

However, this Wang Xian was his fiancé’s brother. Furthermore, he wanted to give the pet cub to he yuan. When that happened, he could ask he yuan to come over.

Fortunately, he didn’t have any conflict with him.

He suiqing thought to himself.

“Haha, So What If he’s here? What’s the point of giving him a gift!”

When he yuan heard that, he burst into laughter. He was in a great mood.

Dui Dazhuang, who was standing at the side, raised his head and stared at Wang Xian with his eyes wide open in disbelief.

“Thigh, thigh!”

He mumbled as his eyes lit up.

Everyone around was also looking at Wang Xian in shock.

No wonder he rejected he suiqing directly and dared not to give young master he Feng Face.

It turned out that he had such a good relationship with young master he yuan.

However, compared to the shock of the people around him, he feng, who was standing there, had an unsightly expression.

Just now, he had said something. Today, if I, he Feng, don’t kill you, I won’t have to stay in the He clan anymore.

However, such a sudden change made his expression change.

That young man was a friend of his younger brother, he yuan, so what did he say?

His expression kept changing, and slowly, his expression turned cold.

He knew that he wasn’t weaker than he yuan, and now he had become a dragon among men.

It wasn’t certain who would be the future clan leader, and he didn’t need to give in to he yuan. When it was time for him to be strong, he had to be strong.

Otherwise, the other members of the He clan would think that he was easy to bully and that he was inferior to he yuan.

“Brother he yuan, this friend of yours is really arrogant. He is really undisciplined!”

At this moment, he feng raised his head slightly and stared at Wang Xian with a cold expression.

The moment he said that, the surrounding instantly fell silent.

Everyone took a deep breath and stared at He Feng in astonishment.

Even the disciples of the He clan stared at him with sparkling eyes.

They could faintly guess that this time, he feng would probably become stronger.

The words that he feng had just released and the provocation that the young man had issued.

Now, just because he was a friend of he yuan, he feng did not care. In everyone’s eyes, he Feng was a little afraid of He Yuan.

Although their relationship wasn’t bad, sometimes, what needed to be fought for still needed to be fought for.

He Feng, who had become a dragon among men, had the right to do so.

“Eh? Big Brother, what are you doing? What do you mean?”

When he yuan heard he Feng’s abrupt words, a stunned expression appeared on his face. He turned around and looked at him.

“Just now, your friend injured a young man and even provoked me. This matter can not be settled like this!”

He Feng looked at he yuan coldly and stared at Wang Xian.

“Big Brother, this...”

He Yuan was stunned for a moment before he continued, “Big Brother, if my friend offended you in any way, I will apologize on his behalf. Let’s forget about this matter!”

“Forget about it? Just now, I said that I wanted to kill him. On account of you, I will teach him a lesson. This is already giving you a lot of face!”

He Feng looked at he yuan with a strong expression.

This caused he yuan’s expression to slightly change.

“Big Brother, he is my friend!”

He Yuan’s expression slowly became ugly as he emphasized.

“I know he is your friend, so I let him off. Don’t ask about this, little brother!”

He Feng said faintly to he yuan.

The conversation between He Feng and the He Yuan brothers caused everyone to hold their breaths as they watched this scene with some fear.

The confrontation between the two most outstanding disciples of the He clan... They didn’t dare to say a word.

Even the Lin Yao, Yao, and he clan disciples and he suiqing didn’t dare to interrupt.

“Big Brother, today is my birthday. What if I say that I must protect him today?”

He Yuan’s expression also slowly turned cold as he spoke in a deep voice.

“Hehe, he yuan, in other times, I always let you win. But this time, I won’t let you win. If he dares to provoke me, he will have to pay the price!”

He Feng’s expression also turned cold as he stared at he yuan. “I, he feng, am a dragon among men. Not just anyone can provoke me!”

He Feng’s domineering attitude caused he yuan’s expression to turn slightly ugly. He stood there and stared at him.

“Move aside. You are not my match now!”

He Feng took a step forward.

“He Yuan, move aside. This kid is too arrogant. It’s fine even if big brother He Feng taught him a lesson!”

“It’s just little brother he yuan. Don’t get involved. Big Brother He Feng Won’t do anything to him!”

Some of the He clan’s disciples who were close to He Feng spoke up when they saw how domineering he feng was.

Obviously, there were already disciples who supported the dragon-like he feng.

Their words caused he yuan’s expression to change drastically.

“Brother he yuan, I’ll give you a way out. This is the law enforcement pavilion’s token. I’ve just joined the law enforcement pavilion!”

At this moment, he feng took out a token. He squinted his eyes and looked at Wang Xian. “I have the right to punish him for daring to make a move in the He clan’s territory. You Can’t protect him either!”

He took out the token from the law enforcement pavilion. Although it was to give he yuan a way out, it was a different attitude.

I Won’t let this guy off today!
