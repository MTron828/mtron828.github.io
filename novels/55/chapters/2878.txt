Chapter 2879: set out, sweeping across a region

During the Emperor Ascension ceremony of Red Wind God Emperor, all the experts of the holy region came forward to pay their respects.

This made the entire holy country extremely lively, the incomparably huge holy country was slightly crowded at this moment.

As the symbol of the holy country, countless people gathered at the Holy Tower.

Within the Holy Country, there was a rule that anyone below undying level 9 was prohibited from flying here.

Only the sacred region elders and above could fly here.

Unless there was an emergency, the normal elders and protectors wouldn’t fly within the sacred country.

“It’s in the sacred tower ahead!”

At this time, above the sacred tower, the emperor court and eight desolation emperor were floating in the air.

Their gazes were staring at the top of the sacred tower, their eyes flashing coldly.

“Ask God Emperor Red Wind again. If the sacred master and the others don’t come out, everything will be fine. If they come out, we must immediately inform the Wizards, the emperor, and the desolate god Emperor to get ready.”

“No matter what the result is this time, we will leave immediately.”

God Emperor Shenwu said to the eight desolation God Emperor.

The eight desolation God emperor nodded slightly and frowned.

If the Holy Region really participated in this war and stood together with the Dragon Palace, they would have to think about it.

“Emperor Hongfeng!”

The two of them floated in front of the top of the Holy Tower and shouted toward the room at the top of the Holy Tower.

“Huh?”

At the top of the Holy Tower, Hong Fengyan, who was chatting with Wang Xian and the rest, was slightly stunned. She looked outside through the window.

When she saw the two figures outside, she narrowed her eyes slightly.

“Eh? Why are they here?”

God Emperor of Shangshui was slightly stunned. He looked over with a frown.

“The Celestial Emperor of the imperial court, the Celestial Emperor of the eight barrens?”

Wang Xian looked at the two figures. His eyes were sparkling.

“What are these two guys doing here?”

“How disappointing. These two obviously have bad intentions.”

The expressions of invincible ye Lui Ying and the others also changed slightly as they looked outside.

Hong Fengyan stood up and walked to the window, staring coldly at the two figures outside.

“May I know what business divine Emperor Shenwu and divine emperor sunshade flame have?”

Hong Fengyan stared at the two of them expressionlessly and asked indifferently.

“Oh? What’s the situation?”

The voice from the Holy Tower and the two figures that suddenly appeared attracted the attention of many people around.

“It’s the two divine emperors from the imperial court and the eight barrens. What are they doing?”

“This is? They’re here to look for the red wind divine emperor. What are they trying to do?”

“Not good. They must have seen the Dragon King coming, so they came to look for trouble with our red wind divine emperor.”

Some people around them raised their heads and looked at the sky above the Holy Tower.

Some of the experts in the sacred tower opened their windows and looked over with furrowed brows.

“Sacred Lord, the Divine Emperors of the eight barrens and imperial court have gone to look for Xiao Yan.”

At this moment, the five divine emperors of the holy region were sitting on the top floor of the sacred tower opposite the child sacred tower. An old man was frowning as he looked towards the child sacred tower.

With his strength, he could see everything over there.

“That Lady Xiao Yan is a little stubborn. In addition, she was able to break through to the Celestial Emperor Realm because of the Dragon King. She should choose her own. If the Dragon Palace can get through this, it will be beneficial to Xiao Yan.”

The sacred master shook his head helplessly.

“Sacred master, if the eight desolate imperial court and the Witch Formation Association really join forces to attack the Dragon Palace, how will the Dragon Palace Defend? If they can defend, it would be too heaven-defying. I think the Dragon Palace might be finished.”

“Xiao Yan is so deeply involved with the Dragon Palace. What if…”

A sacred emperor shook his head and said with a frown.

“We can’t stop Xiao Yan’s matter.”

The god Emperor beside him also said with a slightly helpless expression.

“Look!”

Sacred Master sat there indifferently and looked in the direction of the child sacred tower.

…

“God Emperor Hong Feng, before we leave, let us bid you farewell!”

In front of the child Holy Tower, Divine Emperor Shenwu said to Hong Fengyan with a smile.

“Oh? Then I won’t send you off!”

Hong Fengyan said faintly.

“Hehe, there’s no need for divine emperor Hong Feng to send you off. We just received a message that the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace has arrived and divine emperor Hong Feng is receiving him.”

The eyes of the divine emperor from the eight barrens were a little cold as he said with a sneer.

“Who do I need to report to the two of you about the banquet I’m hosting?”

Hong Fengyan also replied coldly.

“Hahaha, God Emperor Hong Feng, does that mean that you’re determined to make an enemy of the imperial court and the eight barrens?”

God Emperor Shen Wu laughed loudly and asked in a somewhat sinister manner.

“This…”

When everyone around heard this, their expressions changed drastically.

If they responded, it meant that their god Emperor Hong Feng would have to participate in the war between the Dragon Palace and the eight desolations witch union of the imperial court.

In a war of this level, even a god Emperor would fall if he was not careful.

“Hehe, so what if we are enemies if we have to take a stand?”

Hong Fengyan replied indifferently.

“Stand? Is this your God Emperor Hong Feng’s stand or the sacred region’s stand?”

The eight desolation God Emperor stared at Hong Feng Yan.

“Of course it’s my stance. Yesterday, our sacred master also made his stance clear. Sacred Master can represent the sacred region, and I can only represent myself!”

Hong Feng Yan replied indifferently.

“Good, good, good. God Emperor Hong Feng, then I must give you a reminder here. You have just become a god Emperor, so you must learn to keep a low profile and stand on the wrong side. Sometimes, you will have to pay with your life, even if you are a god Emperor!”

The eight barrens celestial emperor laughed and said with a cold gaze.

“Hiss, this… they are threatening our red wind celestial emperor!”

“Sigh, our red wind celestial emperor has actually participated in this chaos.”

“It’s our red wind celestial emperor who is too generous. The Dragon King helped our Lord to break through to the Celestial Emperor Realm, so our Lord stands with the Dragon Palace.”

“This Dragon King is simply playing with fire. It’s fine that you offended a powerful force in the starry sky, but now that you’ve offended two or three of them, you’re simply asking for your own destruction!”

Around them, all the experts from the holy region whispered to each other with ugly expressions on their faces. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

They shook their heads helplessly. They couldn’t do anything about the choice made by the Lord Hong Feng.

“The price of your life?”

In the room on the top floor of the Holy Tower, Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a hint of killing intent when he heard their words.

He walked toward Hong Fengyan slowly and patted her shoulder, asking her to leave the window.

“Are you seeking death by threatening my friend here?”

Wang Xian stood in front of the window and looked at the two god Emperors of the imperial court.

“Dragon King!”

When the two of them saw Wang Xian, their eyes narrowed slightly.

“Dragon King, you won’t be able to be arrogant for long!”

Hatred and killing intent appeared in the eyes of Celestial Emperor Shenwu as he stared at him.

“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, it’s not so easy to kill the celestial emperor of the eight barrens. Next, you will have to pay a heavy price for this!”

The Celestial Emperor of the eight Barrens said with a cold face.

“I think you really want to die!”
