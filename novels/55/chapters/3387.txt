“Huh?”

Sensing the arrows heading toward him, Wang Xian’s mind flickered and his body flickered.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

The next moment, a series of explosions sounded. About 100 million kilometers to the right of Wang Xian’s figure, over a hundred thundermale apes were directly destroyed by him.

Thundermale apes were a type of dire beast in the Thundercloud region. They were good at team battles.

There were more than a hundred thunder male apes. All of them were at the seventh level of the Universe Knight Realm.

However, they had attacked the wrong target this time.

“You’re courting death.”

Wang Xian said coldly. With a move of his arm, he kept all the corpses.

“No wonder it’s said that the interior of the Thundercloud is more dangerous. We can’t be careless!”

His body moved. After a moment of hesitation, he flew downwards and landed on the ground.

The thunderclouds were connected to the ground. It was possible that there were dire beasts underground.

By landing on the ground, he could be more alert of his surroundings.

He kept flying forward. After a short while, Wang Xian arrived in front of a mountain peak under the sensing of the incipient saint wings.

The mountain peak was not tall. It was only a few tens of thousands of meters. However, there was a lightning pillar that was connected to the peak.

At the top of the mountain peak, there was a lightning tree. The entire tree was emitting a powerful energy.

“Tsk Tsk, a universe knight level nine lightning tree. This is a treasure!”

His eyes were sparkling as he sensed his surroundings.

There should be a desolate beast guarding the lightning tree.

However, after sensing for a while, he did not find any desolate beasts.

Whoosh

Wang Xian’s body moved and landed at the peak of the mountain, beside the Thunder Tree.

He scanned the surroundings and reached out his hand to grab it.

The moment he made his move, the mountain below suddenly erupted with a terrifying attack power.

A palm condensed from huge rocks was smacked toward Wang Xian!

“What? A peak with the combat strength of a universe knight level nine?”

He immediately changed his form slightly. His arm turned into a dragon claw. He clenched it and smashed it towards the peak.

“Bang!”

The huge force of the collision caused the arm of the peak to collapse instantly.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

An angry roar came from within the peak. In the next moment, countless huge rocks containing terrifying thunderbolts smashed towards Wang Xian like meteorites.

“You’re courting death!”

Wang Xian let out a furious roar. Gusts of wind that contained the power of Thunderbolts appeared on the uninitiated holy wings on his back.

The hurricane headed straight for the entire mountain peak.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The huge rocks that resembled meteorites collapsed instantly and scattered in all directions.

However, when the huge Thunderbolts attacked Wang Xian, the huge mountain peak began to turn illusory.

It was already prepared to escape.

“It’s Too Late!”

Wang Xian’s gaze was locked onto the desolate beast on the mountain peak. His eyes revealed a cold expression.

At such a close distance, it was impossible for him to escape.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

In an instant, Wang Xian arrived in front of the body that was about to disappear. Streams of destructive power of the five elements blasted into it.

“Roar, Roar!”

A terrifying roar was heard. Wang Xian swung his body and a phantom image of a divine dragon’s tail charged out.

“Bang!”

Cracks appeared on the body of the entire mountain desolate beast. Its vitality gradually disappeared.

“This ability to hide its aura is really powerful. Even I can’t sense it.”

Wang Xian looked at the dead mountain desolate beast and muttered.

“Huh?”

At this moment, he saw purple lightning essence flowing out from the crack of the mountain desolate beast.

Wang Xian waved his hand and all the purple liquid landed in front of him.

“What a majestic power of lightning. I can absorb it directly. Not Bad!”

Wang Xian smiled and kept it away. Then, he looked at the lightning tree above.

He flew over and kept it in the Dragon Palace.

“There are so many treasures here. Let’s continue!”

Wang Xian continued flying forward.

In the next month, he found a lot of treasures. He also caught hundreds of dire beasts.

“Eh, there’s a huge tree in front of us. What a strong power of lightning!”

On this day, Wang Xian was flying in the thunderclouds when he suddenly saw a huge purple tree.

The huge tree was bathed in the lightning and looked exceptionally divine.

His eyes were glowing and he immediately approached it.

“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”

Before he could approach it, a familiar chirping sound was heard.

“Thundercloud Vulture!”

He narrowed his eyes slightly and concealed his figure as he continued to fly forward.

“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”

“Crackle crackle!”

Just as he flew over, an inescapable net covered him.

The Lightning Net formed from the lightning emitted a terrifying aura.

This made Wang Xian slightly shocked. He was actually discovered.

“The desolate beasts inside the thunderclouds are really powerful. The desolate beasts on the mountain peaks that I can’t sense are able to discover my Thundercloud Vultures. Furthermore, they have prepared an inescapable net to attack me!”

He thought to himself as he flapped the prieless holy wings on his back.

Waves of wind and thunder energy surged towards the surroundings. The net of heavenly thunder that covered him dissipated immediately.

“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”

At this moment, a rapid chirping sound was heard. A Thunder Cross was heading towards Wang Xian.

“The attack of a level nine universe knight, Thundercloud Vultures!”

“There are still two of them!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze forward. His eyes revealed a cold expression. With a move of his palm, the five elements Grindstone flew out and went straight for the Thunder Cross.

“Peng!”

The five elements grindstone flew over and the entire thunder cross collapsed.

“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”

The two level 9 universe Knights Thundercloud Vultures revealed a fearful and fearful expression when they saw this scene. They hurriedly flew towards the thunder tree in the distance.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian saw them flying onto the tree. He narrowed his eyes slightly and moved his body. He immediately chased after them.

“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”

The two Thunder Cloud Vultures that landed on the tree raised their heads and let out a hurried sound. The surrounding densely packed thunder cloud vultures flew towards the purple tree.

“So Many?”

Wang Xian swept his gaze over and was slightly stunned.

There were a total of seven to eight hundred Thunder Cloud Vultures standing on the purple tree. Their eyes were filled with killing intent as they stared at Wang Xian.

From A Level One universe knight to a level nine universe knight, they had everything.

“Whoosh!”

Wang Xian’s eyes glowed as he arrived in front of the purple tree in an instant.

“Buzz!”

The moment he stepped into the purple tree, a purple lightning barrier enveloped the tree completely. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Bang!”

Wang Xian’s body collided with the tree, producing a loud sound.

The Lightning Shield did not move at all.

“What is this?”

He raised his eyebrows as his palm landed heavily on the shield.

“Bang!”

A tremendous rebounding force came over, causing his expression to change slightly as he flew backward.

“Paradise, a defensive paradise with rebounding force!”

His expression changed slightly as he frowned.
