Chapter 1653: 1653 meeting the little princess again

“Noisy!”

Wang Xian looked at the five ninth-level profound void martial artists who were flying at a speed of at least five to six thousand meters per second and said indifferently.

He looked at the flaming soul in his hand and revealed a smile. His body moved and he continued flying towards the direction of the battlefield.

He did not have the slightest fear towards the experts from the nine gods empire.

However, he didn’t kill them on the spot. After all, it wouldn’t be good if he offended a longevity level expert.

Wang Xian had some understanding of the nine God Empire.

The nine God Empire was formed by nine tribes. Legend had it that it was an empire formed by nine gods.

In the current nine God Empire, every tribe had a longevity level expert.

In other words, there were at least a few longevity level experts in the nine God Empire.

The Demon God of the nine gods was the demon God tribe of the nine God Empire. This tribe was extremely belligerent and was ranked in the middle of the nine God Empire.

Wang Xian’s figure flashed and disappeared into the sky.

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

However, at this moment, the five elders of the demon god of the nine gods tribe, who were at level nine of the Seethrough realm, spat out fresh blood as they flew backward.

Each of their faces were filled with shock.

“The Elders of our tribe are back!”

“Hiss, our elders are so fast. The fire soul must have been obtained by the Elders!”

“The fire soul, the fire soul of the ninth level of the void interpretation is simply a treasure for fire attribute experts!”

In the Sky 50 kilometers behind them, more than a thousand youths and middle-aged men were flying rapidly.

When they saw the figures of the five elders, shock and excitement appeared on their faces.

Just now, when they were flying in the sky, they unexpectedly found a fire soul. This was simply an opportunity that had fallen from the sky.

The five elders immediately gave chase.

Now that they saw the elders returning, they would definitely return triumphantly!

“Eh, that’s not right. That is?”

Just as the five figures approached, everyone could not help but be slightly stunned.

That’s not right, why were the five elders flying backwards.

What kind of divine ability was this?

“The five elders are injured, quickly catch them!”

“Quick, Quick!”

When the few profound void tier 8 experts standing in front saw the five elders spitting out blood and flying backwards, their faces were filled with shock, and they hurriedly shouted.

“Catch, Catch!”

Instantly, over a dozen profound void tier 8 experts immediately went up to the elders and caught their bodies.

“Hu hu!”

The five elders of the demon God tribe steadied their bodies and panted heavily. Their faces were extremely pale.

“What terrifying strength. With a casual wave of his hand, he actually sent us flying 50 kilometers!”

“If that expert were serious, he would be able to instantly kill us in one move!”

The five elders looked at each other with palpitations on their faces as they said with extremely embarrassed expressions.

“What? Elder, an expert attacked you?”

The surrounding demon God tribe members surrounded them with faces full of shock.

“He looks very young. He must have consumed some kind of medicinal pill. However, his strength is really terrifying!”

“He has the strength of a half-step wanshou. I didn’t expect that his luck would be so bad this time. He actually met an expert of half-step Wanshou!”

“Damn it. If our tribe’s half-step wanshou expert came, how could the flame soul benefit that guy! ?”

The five elders revealed unwilling expressions.

However, they were completely convinced by the strength of that seemingly young man.

Fortunately, the other party was afraid of their background. Otherwise...

“Let’s go. We are recuperating at the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop!”

The Elders of the demonic God tribe took a deep breath and said with a gloomy face.

“Let’s Go!”

The group of people didn’t dare to ask further when they saw the silence of the elders. They quickly flew towards Fengtian city.

“Hehe, it seems that Fengtian city has been completely sealed off. I wonder if I can fight against the five half-step longevity experts with my own strength!”

A few hours later, Fengtian city appeared in Wang Xian’s line of sight.

He looked at Fengtian city which was completely sealed off and the corner of his mouth curled up slightly.

When he returned again, this city could no longer give him too much pressure.

Of course, it was impossible for him to charge into the city directly.

After witnessing the foundation of the life and Death Pill workshop, Wang Xian reckoned that he wouldn’t be able to get out if he charged in.

“With the strength of the fire lark tribe, they can’t withstand the desperate attack of the two forces. I can’t infuriate them completely either. Since that’s the case, I might as well make a move on those people who are courting death!”

“Kill them and accumulate resources at the same time. Only when I can fight against longevity will I have the right to be arrogant!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. With a move of his body, he flew towards the center of the fire cloud forest.

Floating in the sky, the Dragon Eyes of the Yin Yang and five elements scanned the area below. Within a radius of 100 kilometers, everyone appeared in his sight!

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

The storage spirit bag vibrated and numerous shadows appeared in the sky.

“Why are there so few people? Within a radius of 100 kilometers, there are only over 2,000 people from the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop. There are only over 100 void interpretation experts and two of them are at the ninth level of the Void Interpretation Stage!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows.

“Let’s do it!”

Wang Xian transmitted all the enemies within a radius of 100 kilometers into the minds of the strange demons. His figure moved and he flew towards the north.

There were two people at level nine of the insightful void stage in the entire battlefield. One of them was in the south while the other was in the north.

The other direction was left to Ao Yao to deal with. He would deal with the one in the north.

A person at level nine of the insightful void stage would be considered a top-notch upper echelon in front of a faction like the fire lark. It would be heartbreaking if one of these factions were to die.

Within five seconds, he was rapidly approaching the level 9 insightful void martial artist.

“Oh no, there’s a half-step longevity expert approaching!”

However, when Wang Xian approached the level 9 insightful void martial artist, his expression changed drastically.

Without any hesitation, he immediately fled in the direction of Fengtian City.

“A half-step longevity expert from the Fire Cloud Sparrow has appeared!”

The moment he turned around and fled, he shouted at the same time. His voice instantly covered an area of over a thousand kilometers.

“Eh? You can actually sense my arrival?”

Wang Xian was slightly shocked. Looking at the level 9 Seethrough void martial artist who was 50 kilometers away, his figure flashed.

“Damn it, the fire Lark clan actually sent out a half-step Wanshou martial artist at this time!”

The escaping level 9 Seethrough void martial artist had a gloomy expression. Today, he was frustrated and prepared to go out and hunt some enemies. However, he did not expect to encounter a half-step Wanshou.

Fortunately, he had a sensing formation on him, and had managed to escape in time.

The distance of 50km was enough for him to avoid the pursuit of Wanshou.

“Peng!”

However, just as he was deep in thought, a palm landed on his body, causing his body to freeze.

“This...”

He widened his eyes, his expression filled with shock.

However, in the next second, his corpse was kept into his interspatial ring.

“Is it a sensing formation?”

Wang Xian was holding a formation compass in his hand as he sized it up curiously.

“There are experts from our fire lark tribe nearby. I wonder which tribe elder it is!”

“This is a little boring. Sister Huo Luo'er, the moment your tribe Elder appears, some of the weaker ones will dodge in advance. How are we going to kill the enemy!”
