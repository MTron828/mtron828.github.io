Chapter 1127: 1128 retreated from the enemy

Translator: 5496903

The entire battlefield fell into a slight silence.

Xing guanghun, the two insightful emptiness realm experts from the Heavenly Moon sect, and the deputy general of the Star Moon Army kept changing their expressions.

He hurriedly distanced himself from Mang Hong and the other two, and looked over with uncertain expressions.

Insta-kill!

The effect of an insightful emptiness realm expert being insta-killed shocked everyone.

Especially since the one who had attacked just now was the mysterious queen of star-moon kingdom.

None of them knew how powerful this mysterious queen was.

This was also the first time they had seen this mysterious queen attack.

The moment she attacked, she shocked all of them.

The four of them looked at Mang Hong, Yu Chengzi, and Yan Wenshan with embarrassed expressions.

In the battle just now, they had witnessed how terrifying these three people were.

In a one-on-one battle, they had always been suppressed. If they fought for a long time, they would definitely lose.

These three people were all top-notch existences of the same level.

Their gazes looked towards the center of the battlefield, and their expressions became even darker.

The entire battlefield was in a one-sided situation after the heavenly eye illusory arrow sniped the Heavenly Moon Soul Chaser’s experts.

The Dragon and Phoenix Corps’1,000-plus experts quickly massacred their star Moon Corps’soldiers.

More than 20 half-step void interpretation realm experts and more than 100 transcendent ninth rank experts. Even though their numbers were relatively small, it was still not something their corps could withstand.

In the short two minutes after Heavenly Moon soul-chaser was attacked, at least several thousand of their subordinates died.

As for the experts of the Dragon-phoenix army, they suffered very little losses.

They were defeated!

They knew that their attack on the dragon-phoenix Empire this time had already failed.

In fact, if the mysterious Queen did not stop until she died, they might lose even more.

When they came, they had never expected that a dynasty that occupied their town and established a kingdom would have so many terrifying experts.

Especially the appearance of the heaven-eyed Demon Beast clan, which completely defeated their attack this time.

In the current situation, the mysterious queen had killed a rank one void interpretation expert with only one move.

Two peak rank two void interpretation experts and a peak rank three void interpretation expert.

There was also an expert from the Heaven’s Eye Demon Beast Clan.

They had completely defeated them!

“Retreat!”

Xing Guangheng roared with an embarrassed expression. The Star Moon Army’s soldiers hurriedly retreated.

The Dragon and Phoenix Army did not pursue them. They stared at them coldly.

“I’m establishing a dynasty here and establishing the dragon and Phoenix Imperial City. Does Your Star Moon Kingdom have any objections?”

At this moment, Feng Luan flew into the sky, her veil completely covering her face.

This time, she did not exude the aura of an expert. Instead, she exuded the aura of a superior from within.

She did not exude any aura, but the aura of an emperor who controlled the world was completely unleashed.

The former great empress had unleashed her might!

“His strength is definitely not lower than the star Moon King!”

“Cough cough, even if his strength is not unleashed, just this demeanor is definitely not an ordinary profound void martial artist!”

The vice sect master and elders of the Sky Moon sect looked at Feng Luan who was standing in the sky. They almost had the urge to worship her in their hearts as they growled in astonishment.

Even when they met the star Moon King, they did not feel this way.

Xing guanghun stared at the mysterious Queen of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire in the sky, and his expression was extremely grave.

He realized that he did not even dare to look her in the eye.

“This queen’s strength is absolutely terrifying!”

He thought to himself, and his expression kept changing.

“Go, Retreat!”

Xing guanghun gritted his teeth and said to all the soldiers of the Star Moon Kingdom in a deep voice.

“If there’s a next time, my dragon-phoenix Empire will make sure that you all never return!”

Feng Luan’s eyes flashed with a trace of joy when she saw them leave, and she spoke coldly.

Xing Guanghun’s body stiffened, and without the slightest expression, he directly flew forward.

He had suffered a great defeat!

Moreover, once they left, it also meant that the dragon-phoenix Empire would be officially established, and their star-moon kingdom would be unable to do anything about it.

“We won, Haha, we won!”

“Star-moon kingdom admitted defeat. They actually admitted defeat. That’s Great!”

“The Queen is Mighty, the Queen is invincible, and she instantly killed a void interpretation expert with a single move. That’s Too Amazing!”

The citizens of dragon-phoenix City revealed excited expressions as they waved their arms in excitement.

They had won, they had actually won.

As citizens of star-moon kingdom, they were extremely clear about the power of star-moon kingdom. However, star-moon kingdom had actually returned in defeat.

Those legendary missions had been defeated by the experts of their kingdom.

Their former city Lord had been instantly killed by the Queen in one move!

They were as powerful as the star-moon kingdom.

And as citizens of the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty, they were incomparably happy. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Even if they were only a small city now, they would definitely become a powerful dynasty in the future.

As citizens of the Imperial City, their lives would also become better and better.

This caused everyone’s faces to be filled with excitement.

Feng Luan saw them leave, and a trace of a smile appeared on her face. She knew that the dragon-phoenix dynasty could be considered to have completely stabilized.

Her deterrence had also played a sufficient role.

The star-moon kingdom would definitely think that she was a high-level insightful emptiness realm expert.

In addition to the experts under her, the star-moon king did not dare to take the risk to come and attack them.

After all, this was only a small city in star-moon kingdom.

“Go and rest for a while!”

Wang Xian’s voice rang in her ears, causing the smile on her face to become even more radiant.

She moved and landed beside Wang Xian.

“I have to thank you this time. If not, it would be troublesome!”

Feng Luan looked at Wang Xian and said with gratitude in her eyes.

If it wasn’t for the sudden appearance of the Heaven’s Eye Demonic Beast, the Dragon and Phoenix Army would have lost at least half of their strength.

“No need. It’s just a small matter!”

Wang Xian smiled and shook his head.

“Sister Feng Luan, it’s my duty to help you. Hehe!”

Guan Shuqing and the other girls walked over and said with smiles on their faces.

“Our Dragon and Phoenix Empire is officially established in the transcendence continent. As the citizens of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, you will be the founding members of the Empire in the future. With the empire around, you don’t have to worry about the ferocious beasts attacking the city. Here, everyone has the chance to become a powerhouse. Everyone has the chance to become the founding general of the Empire!”

Feng Luan turned around and looked at all the citizens of dragon-phoenix city.

“Long live the dragon-phoenix Dynasty!”

Outside of dragon-phoenix City, Mang Hong shouted loudly.

“Long live the dragon-phoenix Dynasty!”

The experts of the dragon-phoenix Army also shouted loudly.

“Long live the dragon-phoenix Dynasty!”

“Long live the dragon-phoenix Dynasty!”

All the citizens of the dragon-phoenix dynasty shouted excitedly.

They naturally knew what benefits would come with the rise of a dynasty.

The current policies, benefits, and security were dozens of times better than in the Star Moon dynasty.
