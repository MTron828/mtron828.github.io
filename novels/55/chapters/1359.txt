Chapter 1360: 1360 killed him

“What?”

“What? A marriage alliance between the two countries!”

“Nonsense...”

As soon as the middle-aged man finished his sentence, a group of civil officials and generals in the back of the main hall revealed furious expressions.

They shouted softly and glared angrily at the people of the Dongyuan dynasty.

Especially Yan Wenshan, Mang Hong, Yu Chengzi and Jin Qianyuan. They wanted their queen to marry the Dongyuan dynasty.

Their intentions were despicable!

Wang Xian had just sat on the chair when he heard the middle-aged man’s words. He narrowed his eyes slightly and looked at the middle-aged man indifferently!

“Hehe, this condition of your Dongyuan dynasty is really interesting!”

When Feng Luan heard the middle-aged man’s words, a hint of coldness flashed across her eyes. She took a deep breath and said faintly.

“Our Dragon and Phoenix dynasty has already shown our sincerity. Please show your sincerity too!”

She continued to say expressionlessly.

“Dragon-phoenix queen, we are not joking, but our Dongyuan King also knows that if the Queen does not agree, we can not force it.”

“Other than this condition, there is another condition. We want the flourishing era fire lotus and the flourishing era fire lotus formation. In addition, the dragon-phoenix Empire will become a vassal state of our Dongyuan Empire!”

As the middle-aged man spoke, his eyes flashed with fervor.

“Flourishing era fire lotus! Vassal State!”

After Feng Luan heard their second condition, her expression turned completely cold.

“That’s right, it’s these two conditions. As long as you agree to one of these two conditions, our Dongyuan dynasty will send troops to protect your dragon-phoenix Dynasty!”

“Otherwise, with the strength of the Star Moon Dynasty and the other two dynasties, your dragon-phoenix dynasty will definitely be destroyed!”

“Dragon-phoenix Queen, you don’t need to consider the first condition or the second one. Only these two methods can protect your dynasty!”

The middle-aged man’s tone was firm as he stared at Feng Luan with confidence.

“The flourishing age fire lotus is a fifth-level profound void martial art treasure, and the Fire Lotus Array is a fourth-level profound void martial art cultivation auxiliary array. These two treasures are priceless!”

Feng Luan stared at the middle-aged man, and her face darkened. “Other than these two things, you want our Dragon Phoenix Empire to become your vassal state?”

“Just a vassal state? Every year, we hand over some tributes, and there’s not much else to do. Compared to being destroyed, becoming a vassal state is just a small matter!”

The middle-aged man looked at Feng Luan, and a faint smile appeared on his face.

The middle-aged man’s words caused Feng Luan’s expression to change.

Below them, the civil officials and generals looked extremely embarrassed.

If they were to become a vassal state, they would be bound and restricted by the Dongyuan dynasty. Their future development would definitely not be so easy.

They would even have to hand over tributes every year.

Becoming a vassal state was equivalent to becoming someone else’s underling.

“What if both of them disagree?”

Wang Xian looked at Feng Luan who was frowning. He turned to the middle-aged man and said faintly.

“Huh?”

The middle-aged man was slightly stunned when Wang Xian suddenly spoke. He raised his eyebrows and glanced at him. Then, he said faintly, “You don’t have the right to speak here!”

His words made Wang Xian smile.

“What if we don’t agree?”

Feng Luan stared at the middle-aged man and said coldly.

“If you don’t agree, then forget it. There are some things that we can take for ourselves!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The middle-aged man said faintly.

“Are you threatening us?”

At the back, the hot-tempered Hong Mang could no longer hold it in and shouted furiously.

“No, no, no. I’m helping you. Star-moon kingdom came to our country to discuss some matters not long ago... hehe...”

As he spoke, he could not help but laugh.

His tone was filled with a threatening tone.

They looked at Feng Luan, as if they were going to eat her alive.

The middle-aged man’s words caused the entire hall to fall silent.

“There’s no rush. We’ll give you time to consider. If you don’t agree in half an hour, we’ll leave immediately!”

The middle-aged man straightened his clothes with a smile.

He turned around and walked out.

The people beside him stood up with smiles on their faces and followed behind the middle-aged man.

“Your Majesty, we’d better...”

An old civil official looked at the people of the Dongyuan dynasty walking out arrogantly and opened his mouth hesitantly.

Everyone in the Hall looked at the old man and felt a little helpless.

This old man was the Prime Minister of the Dragon and Phoenix Dynasty and was responsible for the civil servants.

His meaning was clear. He chose the second condition. If not, the dragon and Phoenix dynasty would not be able to survive this calamity.

Feng Luan opened her mouth. She knew that this was the best choice for the Dragon and Phoenix Dynasty.

There was still room for them to turn things around if they became a vassal state. However, if they were destroyed, how many years would it take for them to rise again?

It would be difficult to establish a dynasty!

“Everyone, please wait!”

Feng Luan opened her mouth slightly. Just as she was about to speak, Wang Xian, who was sitting at the side, suddenly spoke.

The people from the Dongyuan dynasty who were already walking at the door raised their eyebrows. Their eyes were filled with smiles.

The middle-aged man turned around slightly and looked at Wang Xian arrogantly. Then, he stared at Feng Luan with a smug expression.

“Why? Have you made up your mind? Are you going to choose the first or the second one?”

The middle-aged man raised his head and asked with a smile.

“Let me choose for them!”

Wang Xian watched as the middle-aged man ignored him again and again. Then, he stood up slowly.

He wanted them to see clearly.

“HMM?”

The middle-aged man raised his eyebrows slightly.

Feng Luan also looked at Wang Xian with a frown. There was doubt in her eyes.

“Only a child would make a choice, but adults are all...”

Wang Xian looked at the middle-aged man and his group with a smile on his face. “Kill them!”

Kill them!

It was a simple word.

This word stunned everyone in the surroundings. Even the middle-aged man and his group from the Dongyuan Empire were slightly stunned.

However, they soon realized what this word meant.

“Clang! Clang!”

Two bone-piercing sounds of sword rays rang out. Ao Jian and Wang Xian, who were behind Wang Xian, moved and directly attacked the group of over ten people from the Dongyuan Empire.

“What?”

“Dragon and Phoenix Empire, you are courting death. If you dare to attack us, our Dongyuan Empire will guarantee the extermination of everyone in Your Empire!”

When the middle-aged man and the rest saw the two golden swordfish attacking them, they looked extremely embarrassed.

The middle-aged man in the middle raised his head and stared coldly at Ao Jian and Ao Jian.

They did not fight back. If they dared to kill them, they would be seeking their own destruction!

He dared to guarantee that the other party would not dare to do anything to them!

Moreover, when the two armies fought, they would not kill their envoys!

If they dared to lose any hair here, it would be the dragon-phoenix dynasty declaring war on their Dongyuan dynasty!

With the current situation of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, it would be too late for them to curry favor with them. How could they still provoke them?

“HMPH!”

The group of people behind the middle-aged man also stood there arrogantly as they stared coldly ahead.

“10,000 Swords Destroy!”

However, they were wrong.

Anyone who wanted to show off in front of Wang Xian would have to pay a heavy price.

“Not good!”

“No, no, they really dare to attack...”

“How dare they? How dare they!”
