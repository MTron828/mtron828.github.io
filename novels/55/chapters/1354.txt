Chapter 1355: 1355 laughed as they watched the dynasty fall

“Roar!”

On the battlefield at the north gate, on average, hundreds of soldiers from the one leaf continent dynasty surrounded and attacked a member of the Dragon Palace.

Two or three void interpretation experts surrounded and attacked ao qitian, eight Qi, Ao Qi, ao Xia, and a few newly advanced void interpretation experts.

In terms of numbers, the continent dynasty completely crushed them in one night.

However, when the roars of the nine flood dragons sounded on the battlefield and the strange demons that had been hiding in the surroundings started to move, everything started to change.

“Roar! Roar!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

The nine flood dragons flapped their wings, and their bodies emitted a green light. Their bodies moved, bringing along countless wind blades as they attacked the insightful void martial artists one after another.

The nine enormous figures, and any nearby humans, were all directly crushed by the sharp wind blades.

“Ah!”

In the chaotic battlefield, an expert from the first leaf continent dynasty of the second rank of the insightful void martial artists faced off against a flood dragon.

In an instant, when they collided, his eyes were filled with fear.

Terrifying strength, powerful wind attribute attacks.

His body flew far away, his eyes filled with fear.

“Be careful, these nine creatures have the terrifying strength of the third rank of the void interpretation realm, be careful!”

He hurriedly roared.

“What?”

When everyone from the one leaf continent heard this, their expressions changed instantly.

“All of them are third-level void interpretation?”? “There are only nine third-level void interpretation in our entire country. Moreover, the other party doesn’t only have nine third-level void interpretation experts. In addition, the berserk devil monkey, the terrifying lightning creature, the middle-aged man holding the Golden Longsword, and that sinister eight-headed creature are all third-level void interpretation!”

“Don’t be afraid, our King hasn’t made his move yet. Kill, Kill, Kill!”

“We’re all covered in black clouds, and that raindrop actually carries poison. That sound wave can increase the opponent’s strength and disrupt our minds. Those arrows all contain powerful poisons, and anyone who touches them will die!”

“Don’t be afraid, we have dozens of times more people than them!”

Hundreds of thousands of people in front of the one leaf dynasty shouted.

Nine Flood Dragons joined the battle, which greatly reduced the pressure on AO qitian and the other members of the Dragon Palace.

The people of the Heavenly Eye Arrow Division stood at the back and shot arrows toward the overwhelming attacks.

What frightened all the warriors of the one leaf dynasty was that the arrows carried a terrifying toxin.

The poison splashed onto their bodies, and the powerful poison killed them instantly. Only those above the Type 8 realm could withstand the poison.

Other than the poison, the rain of poison in the sky, as well as the terrifying sound waves, had greatly reduced their attacks.

On the other hand, after receiving the attack, the blue raindrops fell on their bodies, speeding up the recovery of their injuries.

There were even streams of water flowing towards them, healing their injuries.

“Go and kill those archers and dolphins in front of us. We can’t let them support and attack from the back!”

An expert at the profound void tier sensed that the attack he released was less than 90% of its peak, and his expression was extremely unsightly. He roared loudly and pointed in the direction of the heaven’s eye clan and dolphins, shouting loudly.

“Go, go, block the other creatures. Our Sky Wolf Battle team will charge forward!”

A hundred-man battle team riding on a water-blue wolf-shaped creature charged forward.

Their strength was at least at the 8th rank of the extraordinary realm. Together with the powerful beast mounts they were riding, one of them could fight against two or three of the same level.

“Keke!”

Around the hundreds of dolphins, each of them was entrenched in the air. Colorful venomous snakes saw someone charging towards them.

Their ice-cold eyes were filled with mockery.

“Kill them!”

The hundred members of the Sirius Battle team glanced at Wang Xian warily before charging towards the group of dolphins and the Heaven’s eye clan.

Wang Xian looked at them with a cold expression. He didn’t move. The members of the heaven’s Eye Arrow clan didn’t even spare them a glance.

When they were within a 500-meter radius, streams of poisonous substances instantly charged towards them.

The terrifying poison started to boil in the air, as if it was going to corrode the space.

“Ah, be careful of the poison!”

“Oh no, we can’t block it. We can’t block it at all. Retreat, Retreat!”

In an instant, terrified voices came from the Sirius Battle team.

The cold eyes of the poisonous snakes were filled with disdain.

As the auxiliary and long-range attackers of the Dragon Palace, they naturally wanted the enemy to come and kill them.

They had long prepared the surrounding toxins. These toxins would kill even those at the first level of the profound void tier.

Only those at the second level of the profound void tier could charge over.

However, the experts of the Dragon Palace blocked all the enemies at the second level of the profound void tier.

The battle entered a short-term stalemate when more than 100,000 people of the one leaf continent dynasty charged over.

The experts at the ninth level of the extraordinary realm were powerful, but they could not kill hundreds of experts at the eighth level and seventh level of the extraordinary realm in an instant.

“Continue, those at the back, continue charging forward!”

One leaf king looked at the entire battlefield.

Generals versus generals, soldiers versus soldiers, their strength was temporarily tied. His eyes flashed with a cold expression as he stood there and shouted once again.

“It’s the king, charge, kill them!”

In the imperial city, there were at least 800,000 to 900,000 people who did not make a move. Although their strength was not as strong as those who charged out, their numbers were huge.

A quantitative change could produce a qualitative change.

Thirty level seven transcendents might not be able to defeat one level eight transcendent, but it was hard to say if there were 50 or 60 of them!

“They are not our match. Let’s kill these bastards!”

Once again, more than 100,000 people flew out of the city, their cold gazes locked onto the members of the Dragon Palace.

“Ahhhh!”

However, at this moment, screams of terror suddenly came from the battlefield.

Among the screams, there were three experts at the insightful void realm.

The rest were all half-step insightful void realm experts and rank 9 transcendents.

In an instant, it was as if the half-step insightful void realm experts and rank 9 transcendents on the battlefield had been cleaned up.

The sudden death and screams caused everyone to be somewhat stunned.

Especially the members of the one leaf continent imperial city below the void interpretation stage. Their leader, their captain, had suddenly died.

Many people only saw a ray of light and realized that their captain was already dead!

After their captain, sergeant, and their commander were killed, the entire team was thrown into chaos.

Operation Beheading hands began!

The Strange Demon moved!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

When their captain and sergeant were killed, the roar of the demon monkey, the roar of thunder, and the sound of metal swords covered the entire battlefield.

“Ahhhh!”

In just a few seconds, at least ten thousand people were killed.

The One Leaf dynasty was at a disadvantage, and as time passed, more and more people were killed.

“Be careful, there are assassins, Assassins!”

A rank 9 transcendent expert shouted in fear, his face filled with panic.

How terrifying would assassins be in battle?

During battle, they did not have time to guard their surroundings. If they were targeted, 90% of them would die.

What made them even more afraid was where were those assassins hiding?

“Not good!”

“Not good!”

In the sky, at the dimension sundering realm battlefield, the expressions of all the dimension sundering realm experts of the one leaf continent changed slightly.

Facing the experts of the Dragon Palace, they had already felt immense pressure. Now that three more dimension sundering realm experts had died, what was going to happen next...

Danger!

“We have to kill him, or else...”

When the one leaf king saw this scene, his expression changed drastically. His expression slowly became ferocious as he stared at that young man.

That fellow who said that he wasn’t qualified could only obtain victory by killing him!

He wanted this fellow to know whether he was qualified or not!
