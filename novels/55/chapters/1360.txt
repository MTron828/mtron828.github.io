Chapter 1361: 1361, I like to destroy empires the most

In the main hall, a bone-piercing sword filled with killing intent charged straight towards the more than ten people from the Dongyuan Empire who were acting cool.

They thought that the dragon and Phoenix Empire would not dare to make a move and offend them.

Indeed, if Wang Xian had not arrived, the dragon and Phoenix Empire would definitely not dare to do anything to them.

However, it was a pity that the one who made a move was Wang Xian.

Anyone who tried to show off in front of him would not have a good ending.

“Run away...”

“Block it, quickly block it!”

When Ao Jian and the rest’s attack arrived, more than a dozen people from the Dongyuan Empire were completely panicking.

The middle-aged man standing in the middle narrowed his eyes slightly. His eyes were filled with fear.

“Dragon and Phoenix Empire, you are courting death!”

He roared, and a flame shield instantly appeared on his body.

The Flame Shield was completely formed, like lava.

The terrifying might of a rank 2 void interpretation expert erupted from his body.

However, the ones who killed them were Ao Jian and a Rank 1 void interpretation golden swordfish.

Ao Jian could fight a rank 3 void interpretation expert, while the other Golden Swordfish could fight a rank 2 void interpretation expert.

Ao Jian wanted to kill a level 2 insightful void martial artist, and he was caught off guard. It was completely...

“Pu Pu Pu!”

Instant Kill!

A series of saber and sword sounds, and streaks of dazzling golden light directly pierced through their bodies!

“No, stop, Stop!”

In the Great Hall, the civil officials and some generals of the dragon-phoenix dynasty were also panicking.

This queen friend who had suddenly appeared had actually killed all the people of the Dongyuan dynasty without saying a word.

This was killing all of them.

The Dongyuan dynasty was the last support of the dragon and Phoenix dynasty, and now that they had suddenly offended them, what awaited them was destruction!

100% destruction!

Even without the star Moon dynasty taking action, the Dongyuan dynasty would destroy them.

Everyone in the Dragon and Phoenix Dynasty’s hall was filled with fear.

“Cough Cough, you dare to kill us? You’re dead, you’re dead... Cough Cough...”

“My brother Wang will kill everyone in the dragon and Phoenix Empire... Everyone...”

“Shut up!”

“PFFT!”

The middle-aged man in the middle widened his eyes and looked at the sharp sword that pierced through his heart. He raised his head and stared at everyone in front of him with a ferocious look. He growled with an incomparably ferocious look!

Wang Xian, who was standing on the stage, spoke blandly. The long sword in ao Jian’s hand caused his head to fly up.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

The head rolled down. Every sound of it landing on the ground caused the hearts of the civil officials and generals in the hall to tremble.

The Prime Minister of the dragon-phoenix Empire was ashen-faced. His eyes were filled with despair.

“You, you... you have harmed our dragon-phoenix Empire!”

His body was trembling as he shook his head helplessly and growled.

“Your Majesty, Forgive me for not being able to serve the empire. Your friend has killed the envoy of the Dongyuan Empire. This is a provocation to the Dongyuan Empire. This is suicide!”

A middle-aged man took two steps toward the center, bowed, and said with an extremely embarrassed expression, “I can fight for the dynasty, but I won’t die in vain. Please forgive me for not being able to continue serving the dynasty. Farewell!”

As he spoke, his body moved and flew out.

When the other civil officials and generals saw a rank 2 profound void martial general leaving the dynasty, their expressions were extremely embarrassed.

Their Hearts were slightly shaken. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Feng Luan stood in front of the throne and looked at the corpses on the ground and the generals who had left expressionlessly. She looked down at everyone below.

What made her feel gratified was that none of the generals and civil officials wanted to leave. This caused a faint smile to appear on her face.

In the entire hall, the most calm person was probably the golden origin.

He had known Wang Xian for the longest time. He knew that since young master Wang dared to make a move, he must have his own thoughts.

Young master Wang would not make a move rashly.

The entire hall fell silent. The generals and civil officials all looked at Feng Luan, waiting for her order.

Feng Luan glanced at Ao Jian and Ao Jian. After a flash of surprise, she turned to look at Wang Xian and shook her head speechlessly.

“By killing the envoys of the Dongyuan Empire, you are declaring war on them. The only one who can support us will also attack the dragon-phoenix Empire. How am I supposed to defend against three to four empires?”

She looked at Wang Xian and said bitterly.

“So be it!”

Wang Xian looked at Feng Luan and shook his head. He smiled at her and said, “There’s still me!”

“Three or four dynasties? I like destroying dynasties the most!”

“I’ve said it before. I’ll make you the only king on this road. I’ll do it!”

I like destroying dynasties the most?

I’ll make you the only King on this continent?

When Wang Xian’s voice rang out in the hall, the civil servants and generals opened their mouths slightly.

The prime minister widened his eyes. He gulped and wanted to say that he was bragging!

“I believe it!”

However, at this moment, they heard Her Majesty’s voice again.

Everyone was stunned!

How could they believe such nonsense?

Could it be that their unworldly majesty, the Queen, had fallen in love?

The IQ of a woman in Love Was Zero?

“Just trust me. Leave the matters of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire to me. I really want to see how many empires are coming. The more, the better!”

Wang Xian smiled at Feng Luan.

After obtaining benefits from destroying the Heaven Island Empire and the one leaf continent empire, Wang Xian wondered if he might as well start destroying some empires in the future.

However, after thinking about it, he decided to let it go!

There must be a limit to killing. One must not lose one’s heart.

If one provoked one’s enemies, one should kill them!

However, if one did not provoke one’s own people, he would not kill the innocent.

The Dragon Palace would also maintain this rule in the future.

Now that he saw someone wanting to destroy the dragon and Phoenix dynasty, Wang Xian was rather happy.

That was because this gave him a reason to destroy them.

“I’ll leave it to You Then. These few days have been too tiring!”

A city-toppling smile appeared on Feng Luan’s face.

After hearing Wang Xian’s words, her tensed nerves could finally relax. She felt relaxed all over.

“This feeling of having someone to rely on is really good!”

A thought suddenly appeared in her mind. This made Feng Luan squint her eyes. It was unknown whether she was happy or flustered.

“Let’s withdraw from the court. Each of you should stand guard at your respective positions and monitor the enemy’s actions!”

Feng Luan waved her hand lazily and walked towards the back of the hall.

Wang Xian followed her with a smile on his face.

Seeing the queen leaving just like that, many people below looked at each other in dismay.

“This... isn’t the queen quite responsible? Why is she... following now...”

The prime minister watched Feng Luan leave with a dumbfounded expression.

He didn’t finish his words, but in the end, what he wanted to say was, why was she acting like a stupid monarch?

One had to know that the queen was usually a wise monarch with great ambitions...

“Yu Chengzi, Mang Hong, Yan Wenshan, the few generals, that is... what should we do now...”

Some of the civil servants and generals looked at the three of them.

The three of them had followed the queen for the longest time. They knew a lot of things that they didn’t know.

“This is a real man. Young master Wang is a man that the queen can rely on!”

Suddenly, Mang Hong looked at Wang Xian’s disappearing figure with some admiration and uttered these words.

Everyone’s lips twitched slightly!

Faint!
