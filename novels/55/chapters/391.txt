Chapter 392: Death Of The Sacred Enforcers

“As I’ve said, since you are here, don’t bother leaving!”

Rumble!

Swish!

Torrential rain fell. However, it was not stopped by the terrifying aura this time and the torrential rain fell in the yard of the villa.

Hearing the devil-like noises, the group of young men froze in fear. Although they were thinking of escaping, all they could do now was shiver in fear.

The raindrops that landed on their cheeks were eerily cold. Every single one of them was petrified.

“Wang... Miracle Doctor Wang... This... This had nothing to do with us! We... We are just here to take a look!”

One young man turned and spoke to Wang Xian while shivering in fear. The cold sweat on his forehead together with the raindrops made him look especially wretched.

Compared to his high-spirited self previously, he looked like a completely different person!

Bam!

“Miracle Doctor Wang, I know I’m wrong. I’m wrong...! But please spare my miserable life! Please let me off! We were blinded to have come! Miracle Doctor Wang, I know my mistakes now! Please give me a chance!” Jiang Yuan immediately went on his knees, kowtowed and begged for mercy!

However, it was he who had brought the group of experts from the Sacred Followers Guild previously! Furthermore, he’d added insults!

At this moment, as he saw the blood mixed with the rainwater flowing to him, his eyes were filled with despair and horror. He had disregarded all sense of dignity as he pleaded for mercy.

Bam! Bam!

“Miracle Doctor Wang, it was our mistake previously! Please let us off! I am begging you! I kowtow to you!”

“Miracle Doctor Wang, we were wrong! Please spare our lives! Please spare us!”

All the young men had broken down! When the first one went on his knees, the rest followed quickly. Fear was written all over their faces!

Wang Xian looked at them with ridicule and contempt.

Just a while ago, they were still gloating over his punishment from the Sacred Followers Guild. What about now?

“When you came, didn’t you hear what I said?”

“Since you came in, you have made your own decision!”

Wang Xian looked at the group of young men before him. Killing intent flashed across his eyes as he turned around and headed back to the villa.

Since they had made their decision, they would have to pay a price for it!

“No! No! Please don’t kill us!”

The young men were in despair as they saw Wang Xian leaving and the four young Inborn experts walking slowly towards them. They were shouting for mercy loudly!

Argh! Argh!

However, the screams lasted only for a short while.

This bunch of elites from various families and sects would never have expected that coming to gloat at Wang Xian for being punished by the Sacred Followers Guild would lead to their death.

Huh?

At this moment, Sui Huang appeared at the entrance of the villa. He looked at the corpses in the villa and raised an eyebrow. He then quickly looked towards Mo Qinglong and the rest before shaking his head and leaving.

The Sacred Enforcers had been annihilated and so had the group of young men who came for a show.

The Sacred Enforcement this time ended with total annihilation. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

However, everyone was still waiting for the outcome on the Underworld website. They were waiting to see the Sacred Followers Guild uploading pictures of the corpse of Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown.

That post from the young man was still being discussed actively on the Underworld website.

The number of replies was increasing at an astonishing speed.

[OP, hurry up and update us! What is the situation now? Did Wang Xian get killed?] [1]

[Hurry up! Hurry up! Let us see the demon-like genius’ corpse!]

[What a shame! A demon-like genius like him appeared before us like a meteor and will be disappearing quickly like a meteor.]

[Seven Inborn experts and twenty-odd Half-step to Inborn experts. This will be more than enough to kill Miracle Doctor Wang! OP, update your post!]

The replies kept piling up as everyone was rushing the OP to update his post. They wanted to see the scene of the demon-like genius being killed.

Time passed by gradually. One hour... Two hours... Yet, the OP was nowhere to be seen.

The martial artists of the Underworld were as restless as cats on a hot tin roof!

[What happened to the OP? Are you eating shit? Why aren’t you updating?]

[Hurry, hurry! What is the situation now!? I can’t wait any longer!]

[Yeah. Just look at the novel Invincible Divine Dragon’s Cultivation System! Their updates are so fast! Why are you so slow?]

[Hurry up and update, OP! I, your father, have been waiting here for two hours!]

However, just as everyone was waiting for the ending, another thread surfaced.

[All my friends are uncontactable. Those that have gone to Rivertown for the show are all uncontactable! It has been over two hours since I heard anything from them!]

When this thread appeared, it instantly attracted the attention of many people.

When they clicked in and saw the contents, their expressions turned heavy.

Last night, many people had decided to head to Rivertown to watch the Sacred Followers Guild kill Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown. This was known by many in the Underworld.

However, all those people who went to Rivertown were all uncontactable.

Furthermore, the previous OP had gone silent after updating it for some time.

All these facts when pieced together made the rest feel that something wasn’t right.

Even the OP who made the new thread felt that something might have happened to his friends.

[Encountered a mishap? Sacred Followers Guild is a reputable sacred sect. They wouldn’t kill those who came for the show recklessly.]

If that was the case, only one possibility remained. They were killed by others.

And the “others” could only be Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown.

When someone made this conjecture, everyone was shocked.

[With the experts from the Sacred Followers Guild around, how could Miracle Doctor Wang kill innocents?]

[What is happening in Rivertown? Where are the experts from the Sacred Followers Guild? Why aren’t we getting any information from the Sacred Followers Guild now?]

[I have a bold conjecture. Could it be the Sacred Followers Guild and those who went for the show were all killed by the Miracle Doctor?]

[How could this be possible? The team that was sent down by the Sacred Followers Guild this time around was incomparably powerful! How could they be killed instead?]

The discussion went on. Gradually, half a day passed.

In the evening, a new thread appeared suddenly and took the entire Underworld by surprise.

[We can almost verify that all the experts, Elders from the Sacred Followers Guild and those who went to Rivertown to watch the show have been killed!]

The poster had the name “All-Knowing.” It was from the Omniscient Group, the most powerful information agency in the Underworld.

Once the Omniscient Group confirmed an event, its reliability would be a hundred percent.

When this thread was posted out, it was like the Underworld experiencing a 10.0 earthquake.

The powerful experts from the Sacred Followers Guild had all been killed!

All the powerful Elders and captains of the Sacred Followers Guild were dead!

Death of the Sacred Enforcers!
