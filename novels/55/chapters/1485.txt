Chapter 1486: In the blink of an eye, 1486 turned into ashes

“Elder Du, elder Li, he’s up there. A young man is so arrogant that he doesn’t even give young master he any face!”

The He clan’s forest was quieter in the middle of the night. The chirping of some insects made the entire night very pleasant to the ears.

Occasionally, there would be people walking, but it was no longer as lively as during the day.

At this time, it was a pure land.

Two young men and two old men were standing in the shadows not far away, talking.

“An ant, we can easily crush him to death!”

The two old men nodded indifferently. They didn’t care at all about a young man who was courting death and had offended their young master.

“Then leave it to the two old men!”

The two young men said with a smile.

“Wait until the experts from the patrol team arrive. Tell them about it!”

The two old men nodded and said to them.

“Don’t worry, old men. The young master has already instructed us. Don’t worry and Take Action!”

The two men nodded.

It was forbidden to take action within the He clan’s forest. Even the profound void martial experts did not dare to disobey.

“Alright!”

As the two men spoke, they waved their arms, and an array formation directly enveloped the area in front of them.

In order to prevent alerting the others, they had to use the formation to cover the area.

However, they knew the consequences of releasing the formation. That was if they were discovered by the patrol team in the He clan’s forest.

Buzz

The fluctuation of the formation instantly enveloped the house that Wang Xian was staying in.

At the same time, there was also the house that was built with a single tree.

As for one-tree Dazhuang, he was just killing him along the way.

“Huh?”

In the house that was 300 meters long, Wang Xian was lying in the room. He suddenly felt the fluctuation of energy around him and raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Such a narrow-minded person. If he really had a conflict with the He clan...”

He frowned slightly and revealed an unhappy expression.

Wang Xian didn’t want to see a conflict with the He clan. However, it was obviously impossible for him to lower his head to a kid at level two of the Seethrough realm.

A hint of coldness slowly appeared in Wang Xian’s eyes.

“There’s a fluctuation in the formation. Southwest direction, you’re courting death!”

At this moment, the moment the formation was activated, three Seethrough realm experts from the forest fairy race and four Seethrough realm experts from the He clan were slightly shocked.

They flew over at a terrifying speed.

“Sir Patrols, we are the subordinates of young master He Feng!”

When the seven patrolling experts flew over, the two young men who had been waiting below immediately called out to them respectfully.

“Eh? What are the two of you doing?”

“This array formation has something to do with you!”

The seven insightful emptiness realm experts narrowed their eyes slightly and glanced at the two people below, their gazes fixed on the position of the array formation.

Through a special method, they could see the two old men floating in the sky.

“Reporting to the Lords, we are here to take care of a kid under the orders of young master he Feng!”

The two young men immediately said respectfully.

Their words caused the seven patrolling experts to frown slightly.

“During the day, young master he Feng and Princess Yaoyao came across a shop and wanted a young man to help them sculpt objects. Not only did that young man not agree, but he even insulted young master and the others, so...”

The two of them explained to the seven patrolling experts.

The seven of them looked at each other. Naturally, they did not believe their clumsy excuses.

“Since we have provoked young master He Feng, let’s kill him!”

A middle-aged man said in a deep voice.

“Tell young master he feng not to do such things that break the rules!”

“I really admire young master he feng. It is already good enough that he did not kill him in public. He is decisive in killing and complements young master he yuan!”

“Have he Feng’s men wipe out all traces!”

The seven patrols looked at each other and said, but did not stop this matter.

Moreover, it was not the first time they had encountered such a thing.

However, with He Feng’s talent and status, killing a few reckless fellows in the dark, killing them was as good as killing them.

“Yes, yes. Don’t worry, My Lords. There’s only a young man inside. Elder du and elder Li are both third level void interpretation experts. We’ll be able to settle this very quickly!”

The two of them said hurriedly.

The seven of them nodded their heads and looked towards the position of the formation. Through their perception of the trees, they could see the scene inside the formation clearly.

At this moment, the two elders were floating in the sky 300 meters away. They were staring at the house in front of them.

Elder du and elder Li exchanged a glance. Their eyes revealed a cold killing intent.

A black aura slowly emerged from their bodies.

Kacha

At this moment, Wang Xian’s door was suddenly opened.

This made elder Du and elder Li slightly stunned.

“He Feng sent you guys here? You Want to kill me?”

The door was opened. Wang Xian looked at the two elders who were standing outside and swept his gaze across the position behind them.

The seven insightful emptiness realm experts were clearly seen by him.

He also knew that they were the patrolling members of the He clan who had just arrived.

“Kid, if you want to blame someone, blame yourself for your own death. Hehe, remember, don’t provoke young master he in your next life!”

The two old men were slightly stunned, but they recovered quickly.

Elder du stared at Wang Xian and said coldly, “Go to hell!”

He growled in a low voice and a gust of black gas attacked Wang Xian directly.

“I originally didn’t want to attack you guys, but if I don’t, you guys are courting death again!”

Wang Xian stared at them expressionlessly without even looking at the black gas. With a flick of his finger, he flicked it.

Buzz

Two streams of energy were released. In an instant, the black gas dissipated.

“Huh?”

Elder du and elder Li were slightly stunned. This kid still dared to resist?

However, their expressions were frozen there forever!

Buzz

His body seemed to be frozen by time. Following that, his entire body seemed to have been retrieved by this world and dissipated immediately.

He vanished completely without leaving a single trace.

“What?”

At the spot outside, when the seven insightful emptiness realm experts saw elder du and elder Li disappear, their entire bodies were instantly covered.

They stared at Wang Xian’s location in disbelief.

What greeted them was a pair of cold eyes.

“Hiss!”

In an instant, the seven insightful emptiness realm experts sucked in a breath of cold air at the same time.

Their eyes revealed a look of fear.

They also knew elder Du and elder Li’s strength, the third level of the insightful emptiness realm.

Among them, the strongest was only at the third level of the insightful emptiness realm.

However, under their shocked gazes, the two third level insightful emptiness realm experts flicked their fingers, and that young man directly turned into ashes.

There wasn’t the slightest trace.

This... How was this possible?

What was his strength?

Everyone felt a chill on their backs.

At this moment, they saw the young man in front of them waving his arm gently. The formation of the third level of the void interpretation stage collapsed and dissipated.

A pair of eyes looked at them. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Eh? Why isn’t this guy dead yet? Where are elder Li and elder du?”

However, the two young men below looked at the formation that had suddenly disappeared and Wang Xian who was standing at the door with a stunned expression.

“I don’t want to have any conflict with your race. However, they must die!”

Wang Xian looked at the seven patrolling men. With a flick of his finger, two streams of energy shot towards the two young men.

“What’s the situation?”

The two young men were suddenly at a loss when they heard Wang Xian’s words.

However, they were soon freed from any worries and turned into ashes!
