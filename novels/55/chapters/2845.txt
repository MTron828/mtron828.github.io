2846 2846 windless day

“Dragon King, we are now in a deeper part of the wilderness. It will take a long time to get there.”

“We will get there as soon as possible.”

Soon, a message came from the eight-pointed sky array.

When Wang Xian saw their reply, he raised his eyebrows slightly.

The sky array had brought the eight-pointed demonic fiend and Ao Yao to search for treasures. They had also sent him a lot of messages over the past few days. They had even surrounded and killed a first level divine emperor abyss seed. The harvest was very good.

“There’s no need to rush. We can just come directly to the windless forest.”

Wang Xian did not urge them.

The Heaven Array’s eight-limbed demonic fiend and the others had followed them. Wang Xian was the one taking action.

With them around, it was just a guarantee.

It did not matter if they arrived a little later.

“Handsome Wang Xian, let’s go. We are going to the windless forest.”

On the fourth day, Ye lui Ying’s voice came from outside the door.

“Alright!”

Upon hearing the voice from outside, Wang Xian replied immediately and walked out of the room.

“Let’s go, let’s go. Master asked me to call you.”

As Ye lui Ying spoke, she brought him outside.

Not long after, four figures appeared in front of them.

Wang Xian swept his gaze over and saw that Ye lui Ying’s master, senior sister, and senior brother were all there.

However, there was an additional woman.

“Master!”

Ye lui Ying walked over and greeted the woman with a smile on her face.

“Yes!”

The woman nodded her head. Her gaze landed on Wang Xian and her expression changed.

“Did you gain your understanding of the wind from that Holy Feather?”

The immortal slaying calabash that Wang Xian demonstrated to her four days ago shocked her greatly.

From the condensation and attack of the immortal-slaying calabash, she gained some insights. Now, she felt that one of her feet had already taken that step.

She had a feeling that she would be able to achieve a breakthrough in a few decades, at least a few years or months.

All of this was because of this young man in front of her.

Furthermore, she felt that if this young man had his current realm, he would already be able to break through to the celestial thearch realm.

Even so, as long as he was given enough time, he would be able to break through to the celestial thearch realm.

This was because he had already broken through the shackles of different levels in advance.

Now, when she faced this young man, she was no longer facing a junior or a weakling. Instead, she was facing an existence of the same level.

“I guess so!”

Wang Xian looked at her and nodded with a smile.

“Your method has given me a lot of insights. After this, follow me to my divine kingdom. I will help you to increase your strength quickly.”

The lady pondered for a moment and said to Wang Xian.

“Let’s talk about it in the future.”

Wang Xian rejected tactfully.

“Do you have a strong background?”

The lady frowned slightly when she heard his rejection.

“I’m just an ordinary cultivator from an ordinary force.”

Wang Xian said faintly.

“Think about it. We’ll talk about it after we return from the Windless Forest!”

The Lady said but didn’t say anything else.

Wang Xian smiled and nodded at the side.

However, at the side, Ye Lui Ying and the other three were looking at this scene with their mouths Agape.

What was going on? How could their master treat a young man so politely?

And even bring him to his own divine kingdom?

This was their master’s divine kingdom.

They hadn’t been there too many times.

This..

What was going on?

Did their master have feelings for his daughter?

Impossible!

They knew their master well. They hadn’t had any intimate contact with any man for over eight million years.

Some gossipy disciples had even discussed their master once or twice.

It was impossible for them to have such thoughts towards a young man.

The four of them looked at each other in confusion.

“Let’s Go!”

The woman waved her arm and a banana fan appeared in front of them.

Wang Xian flew up and followed her. Since they had the same goal, he could learn more about the windless forest from them.

The banana fan flew at a fast speed. After more than ten hours, Wang Xian realized that there were more people.

One by one, the powerhouses brought their disciples towards the windless forest.

There were also some forces that brought thousands of disciples over.

The windless forest was a very good training ground for wind attribute cultivators.

On windless days, many powerhouses would bring their disciples over for training and to look for Feng Yu.

It would take one day to travel from the Blue Moon planet to the windless forest at master ye Lui Ying’s speed.

One day later, they arrived at the front of the windless forest.

In the surroundings, many forces and powerhouses were leading their disciples to stand in front of the windless forest.

The sound of leaves clashing could be heard. In the sky, tornadoes and typhoons were wreaking havoc.

“Eh?”

Wang Xian raised his head and looked up. He revealed a curious expression.

There were many people in this area. There were at least a hundred thousand people.

No one entered the windless forest. At this moment, the windless forest was moving on its own.

The tornado and the collision of the leaves were slowly spreading into the forest.

“The Windless Day has just begun. The sound of the leaves is heard. Wherever the hurricane passes by, the attacking power of the trees will be greatly reduced. Only when the sound of the leaves colliding with the hurricane is heard throughout the windless forest will the windless day be fully activated.”

“The real windless day will only last for one day. However, the outer area can last for two days. These two days are the best time to obtain the Wind Jade.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The woman looked ahead and said.

“Little four, lead them into the inner area later.”

The woman said to the woman who had just arrived.

“It’s Master!”

The woman immediately nodded.

“Protect him well.”

After hesitating for a few seconds, the woman instructed the woman again.

“Yes!”

The woman nodded her head and looked at Wang Xian who was beside her.

Wang Xian smiled when he heard her words.

It was not like he was going to act together with Ye lui Ying and the rest.

“During the windless days, how many wind jades you can obtain will depend on your luck!”

“It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Whether I can make a fortune or not depends on this one time.”

“Whether I can make a breakthrough this time depends on how much wind jade I can get!”

“Go, go, go. The attacks from the trees at the edge have been greatly reduced. Let’s go over.”

“Be careful. Don’t let others attack. If there are any attackers, don’t be afraid. Kill them!”

At this moment, voices came from the surrounding area.

The disciples were rubbing their fists, and some experts began to instruct their disciples.

Right now, the attacks from the surrounding trees were greatly reduced. Some experts did not move, and their target was the deeper parts of the windless forest.

“Boom Boom!”

Right at this moment, a terrifying might charged over.

“A divine emperor level expert has appeared!”

“A divine emperor has appeared!”

Sensing this might, the experts and powers that had already arrived swept their gazes over. Their pupils constricted as shock appeared on their faces.

In the sky, an old man shrouded in green light was floating there quietly.
