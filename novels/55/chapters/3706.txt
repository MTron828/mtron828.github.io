3707 Under the 3706 Void Pagoda

With Wang Xian’s current strength, which was even stronger than the level two realm of the Universe Dominator, he was able to stop the void barrier from moving at all!

On the other hand, an lie was able to extend his hand and send it over. It was obvious that this energy was similar to the energy in an Lie’s body.

“Enter!”

Wang Xian said to an lie!

An lie nodded his head. With a move of his body, his figure disappeared immediately!

Wu Sha and the rest reached out to touch the spot beside him. They wanted to enter, but there was nothing they could do!

“Dragon King!”

The next moment, an Lie’s figure appeared. He looked at Wang Xian with a hint of shock in his eyes!

“What’s Wrong?”

Wang Xian looked at him!

“Dragon King, there are dozens of corpses inside. Take a look!”

As he spoke, Wang Xian felt the surrounding scenery change. It was as if he had entered a special space!

This space had no attributes and he could not feel any energy!

“Eh? Dragon King, I can feel that the energy in my divine kingdom has been isolated!”

Shi Sen suddenly exclaimed!

The energy had been isolated. This meant that they could not absorb the energy from the divine kingdom.

There was no energy in this place. Over time, their physical bodies would die here!

That was the true death!

“HMM, there is no energy around and the divine kingdom is isolated!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and looked ahead!

At this moment, they seemed to have entered the interior of the beehive. It was an oval-shaped space!

In front of this space, there were corpses!

There were the corpses of human experts and a few corpses of Space Beasts!

The corpses of space behemoths were obviously killed while the corpses of humans were entrenched there. It was as if they died because there was no energy to absorb!

“Dragon King, look at that corpse. It has golden skin, golden hair, and golden bones. This is a golden man. It’s a Golden Man!”

Suddenly, an exclamation was heard!

Wang Xian looked over and his gaze landed on the Golden Corpse!

The golden men were also known as the Golden God of War!

They were once the peak race before the last calamity.

“It’s really the golden men. Didn’t the golden men race perish in the last calamity? Why are there still their corpses here?” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Wu Sha asked with a face full of astonishment!

Wang Xian’s gaze flickered slightly. The golden men were the powerhouses of the peak race before the last calamity!

They were an existence with a terrifying physical body.

Wang Xian walked over and touched his bones with his hands. He could still feel an indestructible feeling!

“Just the bones left behind are definitely not weaker than a level six overlord when they were alive, or even higher!”

Wang Xian mumbled.

He did not expect to encounter such a miraculous thing this time!

To be able to encounter a race at the peak before the Cataclysm!

Wang Xian did not know much about the cataclysm. In fact, it seemed that all the peak races would keep the matter of the cataclysm a secret!

“Dragon King, there are treasures here!”

At this moment, a pleasantly surprised voice came from Lei Shan beside him.

Wang Xian looked over. There was a sword not far from the Golden Man’s corpse.

It was a golden sword!

The sword had already been sheathed, but even so, one could still tell that this sword was extraordinary!

Lei Shan stretched out his hand and took out the golden sword. He drew it out directly!

A sharp aura was emitted.

However, it seemed that the special ability had disappeared because he had not absorbed energy for a long time!

“This is definitely an innate treasure, a powerful innate treasure!”

Lei Shan opened his mouth and said!

Wang Xian nodded and walked over immediately. He held the Golden Sword in his hand and moved his palm!

Buzz

A wave of metallic energy was injected into the sword. A golden figure could be vaguely seen around the longsword. A sharp light swept across the surroundings!

It was a very powerful golden sword!

Wang Xian was slightly surprised.

“Dragon King, there are still treasures here. I don’t know if there is one, but there are a total of six innate treasures!”

At this moment, the voices of Wu Sha and the rest could be heard from the side!

Wang Xian flew over and immediately saw the treasures placed around the corpses!

Even though there was no energy, he could still tell that they were innate supreme treasures that could snatch the fortunes of the world!

There was a book, a seal, a chessboard, a dagger, a black paintbrush, and a painting.

Wang Xian swept his gaze across and waved his arm. One treasure after another floated around him!

Buzz

The six innate treasures were floating around him. All of a sudden, there were some changes to the painting!

The painting suddenly moved and a shadow slowly appeared!

The face of the shadow could not be seen clearly. It was in the form of a human and was wearing a windbreaker!

“Juniors, I don’t know if you are from the Void universe or the nine-origin universe. Just treat it as if you are the disciples of the nine-origin universe. It is fate that you are able to enter this place!”

At this moment, the Phantom suddenly spoke. It was obvious that the remaining energy had been activated!

Wang Xian looked over and revealed a curious expression!

Void Universe? Nine-origin universe?

“The corpses that you see are none other than us. We are all survivors of the previous calamity. The location that you are at is the enemy of our nine-origin universe. The Void Pagoda of the Void Universe, the Void Pagoda, and the war treasure of the Void Race of the Void Universe.”

“This treasure was left behind by the Wargod of the Golden Man, a peak race, during the previous calamity. We tried to crack it but failed… it was later snatched away by the Void Beasts of the Void Universe…”

Buzz

Wang Xian and the rest listened quietly as the Phantom spoke. Suddenly, the phantom trembled and slowly disappeared!

“What the F * ck, he disappeared without finishing his sentence? What’s going on?”

Demon Wings couldn’t help but shout loudly when he saw this scene!

The words of this phantom had really left them too confused and shocked!

9-origin universe, Void Universe, starry universe, what did all of these mean?

What about the Apocalypse?

They could confirm that the 9-origin universe was their universe, but what about the Void Universe?

Enemies of the nine-origin universe?

And what was the meaning of the space behemoths in the starry universe?

Weren’t the space behemoths the space behemoths in their universe?

When Wang Xian heard the words of the Phantom, his face was filled with curiosity.

“Void universe, Void Tower.”

Wang Xian mumbled as he looked at an lie who was beside him!

An lie had previously teleported to the coordinates in his mind and said that that world was very strange!

Furthermore, when Wang Xian received the genesis wings, he had inherited an image.

The owner of the Genesis Wings was fighting against a powerful existence that could teleport!

“Does this have anything to do with the Apocalypse? According to the time, there are still billions of years before the Apocalypse arrives.”

Wang Xian mumbled as he scanned his surroundings!

Apart from these corpses, there was nothing else in the oval-shaped space!

This space was only a few thousand kilometers in size. It was not very big. Obviously, this was only a small part of the Void Pagoda!
