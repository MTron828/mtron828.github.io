Chapter 1239: 1,240 battles of the Prodigies

Translator: 5496903

To be on the prodigy roll at the age of 26, this was definitely the first person in history.

Most importantly, this 26-year-old youth’s strength was extremely terrifying.

Looking at the few pieces of information on the prodigy roll, everyone was shocked.

Regarding this unknown piece of information, it also caused many people to be curious.

Some people guessed that it was a heaven defying disciple nurtured by the blood flow empire, because in their eyes, only the blood flow empire had the ability to do so.

As for why he hid his identity and his real name, in everyone’s opinion, he should hide his strength and keep a low profile!

That’s right, he should hide his strength and keep a low profile.

In order to prevent some people with ill intentions from attacking him before he matured.

In less than ten minutes, Wang Xian went from an unknown rat to a Peerless Heaven’s favorite who hid his strength and kept a low profile.

However, while the rest of the people were extremely shocked, the students of the Divine Wind Academy looked extremely embarrassed.

The person that Wang Xian killed was one of the most elite students of their divine wind academy.

Initially, the Divine Wind Academy was prepared to amaze the world. However, it had now become a stepping stone for another person.

This was a huge humiliation to the divine wind academy.

Wang Xian sat in a corner of the Heaven’s pride pavilion, drinking tea and reading the books in the pavilion.

These books were all about the current Heaven’s Pride Roll’s Heaven’s Pride Roll’s Heaven’s Pride Roll’s introduction.

Since he had nothing better to do, he decided to take a look and understand his next opponents. This could be considered as a small respect for them.

“The three people surnamed Tang on the heaven’s pride roll are actually the blood flow empire’s disciples. No wonder they are worthy of being the strongest faction in the Liuhai Region!”

Wang Xian took a sip of his tea and thought to himself.

He sat in the prodigy pavilion and attracted many curious and surprised gazes. Soon, the pavilion, which was originally only half-filled, was overcrowded.

Wang Xian didn’t pay any attention to the curious gazes around him. He sat there and casually read some information.

“Tang Yuan is here. There’s also Tang Ling ‘er and Han Ming Qing!”

“What are they here for? Are they here to look for an unknown heaven’s pride expert?”

At this moment, rustling sounds came from the surroundings.

At the entrance, four people walked in. There were three men and one woman. Among them, Tang Yuan and a young man whom everyone was unfamiliar with walked in the middle.

The moment they entered the heaven’s Pride Pavilion, they also attracted the curious gazes of the people inside.

The four of them raised their eyebrows slightly. The young man standing beside Tang Yuan was dressed in blue and exuded a noble aura.

“Brother Tang Yuan, is that Nameless Heaven’s pride from Your Royal Family?”

The blue-robed young man asked curiously.

“Not really. If he is a disciple of the royal family, he wouldn’t have any disguise!”

Tang Yuan shook his head and looked at Wang Xian. “Why? Brother Han Mingshan wants to get to know him!”

The young man in blue, Han Mingshan, shook his head and said, “If he has the ability, he will be able to get to know him. If he doesn’t, there is no need to get to know him!”

“Although he is very outstanding at the age of 26, brother Mingshan is not bad either. When he reaches brother Mingshan’s age, he might not be as strong as brother Mingshan!”

Tang Ling ‘er, who was beside him, said with a smile on her face.

Han Mingshan shook his head and said, “Princess Ling ‘er is really flattering me!”

“I’m not being kind. Brother Mingshan, you’re here to teach Ling Jian ‘er a lesson. If you didn’t have the strength, you wouldn’t have come!”

Tang Ling ‘er giggled.

Han Mingshan smiled. “This Ling Jian ‘er killed more than ten elite disciples of our Hanhai Empire. If I hadn’t come, he would have really thought that our Hanhai Empire was easy to bully. At the same time, he also happened to catch up with Supreme Genius!”

The conversation between the four of them was not concealed at all. This was because with their background and strength, there was no need for them to hide anything.

When the surrounding people heard their conversation, they revealed a look of surprise.

Wang Xian’s heart stirred slightly. He raised his head to take a look and then continued to lower his head.

The entire Heaven’s pride stage became lively. Dark horses appeared one after another. They were all 26-year-old prodigies.

The Heaven’s pride stage, where battles occurred every day.

The imminent appearance of the Heaven’s Pride Bridge attracted many low-key young experts. The rankings of the Heaven’s pride roll changed from time to time.

Later, someone revealed that a powerful prince from the Hanhai dynasty had arrived and was preparing to deal with Ling Jian ‘ER.

The Heaven’s sword sect and the Hanhai dynasty had always been enemies. It had been a long time since an intense battle broke out.

The two top forces also watched the battles between the disciples below the profound void stage without breaking this rule.

Not long ago, Ling Jian ‘er killed a female disciple because she said that Ling Jian ‘er was her biological father and didn’t want her biological mother to be killed. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

At the same time, more than a dozen disciples from the powerful families of the Hanhai Empire were killed.

Now, the Hanhai Empire came to seek revenge.

It might not be a massacre, but there would definitely be some humiliation.

Wang Xian didn’t care too much about the gossip outside. When he stayed in the Heaven’s Pride Pavilion until night time, he returned directly to the Heaven’s pride stage.

Now, he was ranked 20th and could freely enter his own heaven’s pride stage.

After entering the room inside, he continued to study the combined attacks of the four attributes.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

Not long after, the heaven’s pride stone on his body started to tremble. Wang Xian took a look and revealed a faint smile.

“He’s finally here!”

His body moved and he flew directly towards the Heaven’s pride stage.

At this moment, on the 19th Heaven’s pride stage, a young man was standing in the middle with a stick in his hand.

When he saw Wang Xian flying over, he revealed a solemn expression.

The moment Wang Xian entered the arena, many young men from the surrounding areas entered the arena to watch.

“Hiss, the Nameless Heaven’s Pride has continued to challenge again!”

“Is this the Nameless Heaven’s Pride? Is He really 26? Oh My God, he’s Too Young!”

“He has started to challenge the 19th Place’s Zhou Yanjun. I don’t think Zhou Yanjun is his match!”

“Definitely not a match for him. The Nameless Heaven’s favorite is simply too strong. He is at least in the top ten, or even higher!”

Tens of thousands of people swarmed in. Many of them were curious as this was the first time they saw Wang Xian.

As for those who called him a nameless rat, they no longer existed. All they could do was exclaim in admiration.

“The 19th place of the Heaven’s favorite, Zhou Yanjun, please enlighten me!”

Zhou Yanjun was obviously aware of Wang Xian’s battle record. He cupped his hands with a solemn expression.

“You are not my match!”

Wang Xian cupped his hands lightly at him to show his respect and said directly.

“I know, but I want to see how big the gap is between us. I will not admit defeat directly!”

Zhou Yanjun’s face revealed a determined look. He held the cudgel with both hands and made an offensive stance.

Wang Xian smiled with a hint of admiration in his eyes. As expected of a heaven’s chosen disciple.

However, Wang Xian did not show any mercy. With a shake of the longsword in his hand, streams of golden sharp swords shot towards Zhou Yanjun.

“Ha!”

He shouted softly and swung the cudgel directly, stirring up the space within a thousand-meter radius.
