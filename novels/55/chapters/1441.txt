Chapter 1442: 1442 left

“Ahhhh!”

When the experts of the blood flow empire were about to make a move inside the array formation, screams and endless screams came from the surrounding areas.

The screams that suddenly rang out stunned the blood emperor and the three emperors inside the array formation.

“What’s going on? Who Did It? Who Did It? !”

“Thousands of people died. Oh My God, I don’t see anyone who did it!”

“Don’t kill me, don’t kill me!”

In just two seconds, the streets of the bloody dynasty became chaotic.

The tens of thousands of people who gathered around were terrified by the scene.

Thousands of people fell to the ground. They widened their eyes and didn’t know how they died.

Even the surrounding people did not see how these people were killed.

The sudden death of 1,000 people caused everyone’s faces to reveal terror.

“What?”

The Blood Emperor was instantly stunned, his eyes shooting out terrifying rays of light.

All the surrounding experts of the blood flow empire also frowned, their faces full of shock as they looked outside the array formation.

“All four factions are under our surveillance. Don’t tell me they have helpers?”

Crown Prince Tang Xuewen stared at the spot on the left with a gloomy face. His gaze swept across the thousands of citizens of the blood flow empire who were lying on the ground.

The expressions of the other factions from the other empires around them changed slightly as well. They took a deep breath.

These four factions were going to completely go against the Dragon and Phoenix Empire!

“Blood Emperor, this is only the beginning!”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept outside as a faint smile appeared on his face.

Buzz

Just as he finished his sentence, a special fog shrouded the area below.

“What is this?”

“What is that fog? Damn it, let’s find the enemy!”

When a stream of fog enveloped the group of people, their faces revealed a look of fear as they shouted loudly.

“Ahhhh!”

However, they were only given one second. Before anyone had the time to dodge, the fog enveloped the group of people.

The moment the fog descended, death was approaching.

The group of people who were shouting arrogantly that they wanted to kill Wang Xian and the rest fell to the ground and lost their life force.

This time, there were at least four to five thousand people.

“Run, run!”

When the four to five thousand people were killed by the poison, the rest of the people from the bloodshed empire panicked and fled into the distance.

Boom! Boom! Boom

However, the moment they fled for their lives, the bright crosses that covered a thousand meters in the sky attacked the group of people.

This was the imperial city of the blood flow empire, and the surroundings of the imperial palace.

It was the place with the densest number of people, and when the 7-8 bright crosses landed, all of them were instantly killed.

The beautiful castle was reduced to rubble under the attack.

Destruction! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

If a bunch of type 3 and Type 4 void interpretation experts wanted to destroy a city, it would be too easy.

If a sixth level void interpretation expert was added, the blood flow imperial city would also be reduced to ruins.

“Kill them for me, go immediately!”

The Blood Emperor’s expression was slightly malevolent.

He did not expect that there were many void interpretation experts hiding around him.

Was this blood flow empire’s supervisory department a waste?

He stared at the people from the other dynasties and sects around him and ordered loudly.

“It’s the blood emperor. We will definitely stop this group of murderers and protect the safety of the blood flow Imperial City!”

The kings and sect leaders of several dynasties gritted their teeth as they looked at the blood emperor staring at them.

“Vile spawn of the four great factions. You actually dare to kill innocents in the blood flow imperial city. Get Out Here!”

A king held a scepter in his hand as he shouted with an icy expression.

“Since you dare to be a lackey of the blood flow empire, then die!”

At this moment, a cold voice rang out in the air. Following that, a black and white figure directly attacked the king.

A black and white light flashed and instantly penetrated the body of the king.

“Cough cough, how... how is this possible! ?”

The King, who was dressed in luxurious clothes, widened his eyes as he looked at his chest in disbelief.

“Your Majesty!”

“Your Majesty!”

In the surroundings, a few experts of the dynasty looked at their king in shock, looking at the huge hole in his chest.

“Hiss, is this the fifth or sixth level of the Void Interpretation?”

A shocked shout came out from the mouth of an expert of the dynasty.

“Why don’t we try and find out?”

In the sky, Ao Yao was enveloped by black and white light. He slowly raised his arms, one half bright and half dark. His left arm was like a scythe, and his right arm was like a dagger. He was like the god of death.

The entire shadow was more than two thousand meters tall, and it was emitting a murderous aura that made people tremble.

“Sixth level of the profound void tier! This aura is definitely of the sixth level of the profound void tier!”

A king of a dynasty cried out involuntarily.

All the people in the surroundings were dumbfounded.

If the assassination of the strange demon group had made them feel fear, it had now become despair.

Their blood emperor and three emperors had trapped two level six insightful void realm experts in the formation, but they had not expected that there was another level six insightful void realm expert outside.

There were three in total, three!

Three level six insightful void realm experts against four level six insightful void realm experts in the imperial city. Although they were at a disadvantage, it was not impossible for them to fight.

Especially now, if the Blood Emperor and the others really attacked, it was completely imaginable that this level six insightful void realm expert would massacre the entire bloody flow imperial city.

With this kind of destructive power, one-tenth of the imperial city could be destroyed in a minute.

“Rank 6 insightful void martial artist and one rank 6 insightful void martial artist!”

Inside the array formation, the blood emperor and the three emperors floated in the air with extremely ugly expressions.

They looked at Ao Yao in the sky outside, and their bodies trembled slightly.

There were three of them, and the other side actually had three rank 6 insightful void martial artists.

Their blood flow empire had seven to eight thousand years of foundation, and they controlled the most enormous resources in the flowing sea region. Now, they only had four level six profound void martial experts.

Yet, the other party actually had three, this...

Especially this level six profound void martial expert outside.

If they attacked and killed the two profound void martial experts inside the array, with their strength, they would have a great confidence, but to kill two experts of the same level, they would need at least ten minutes.

Or even more.

In this time, the entire imperial city would be in ruins.

Tens of thousands of foundations would be destroyed in an instant!

They could not bear such a loss.

“I didn’t expect the dragon-phoenix dynasty to hide a level six insightful emptiness realm expert. My God, their strength...”

The King of the Light Dragon Kingdom and Hierarch Yi revealed excited expressions when they saw ao Yao suddenly appear.

A feeling of having survived a calamity surged into their hearts.

“Blood Emperor, open the formation. We can’t play with you anymore. Haha!”

Wang Xian looked at the blood emperor and the three emperors in the sky and laughed out loud. His face was filled with mockery!
