Chapter 2951: king of the resplendent starry skies

“Roar Roar Roar!”

In the void at the center of the glazed domain’s sacred territory’s boundary, the devouring dragon was chasing after one demonic beast after another.

Countless demonic beasts in that incomparably large demon lair were completely flustered when they saw their leader escape into the demon lair.

All of them were terrified and wanted to fly into the demon lair.

!!

There were even some who fled in their surroundings.

But the difference between them and the devourer is too great.

The devourer dragon with the third-order combat strength of the Emperor of God, its mighty pressure enshrouds most of the evil spirits and quickly slaughters them.

Those more than 50 evil god emperors, under the attack of the two devouring dragons just now, only about 10 left.

These ten evil gods can’t make any waves.

The slaughter, it goes on.

“Hehehe, let’s go, let’s go collect the corpses!”

Mo Sha Ba Qi’s eyes lit up when he saw the demonic corpses in the air. He immediately flew over.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Roar Roar Roar!”

At this moment, a roar of anger and pain came from the huge demon cave. From the roar, one could tell that it came from the two leaders.

“Hehe, the demon cave can enhance Yaoxie’s combat strength, but under the Siege of the devouring dragon, they still can’t resist. Entering the demon cave is a dead end for them.”

Prime Minister Gui looked at the two deep and terrifying demon caves and said with a smile.

They had entered the demon cave on Earth and knew some characteristics of the demon cave.

“The six members of the Dragon Palace are so powerful!”

The surrounding godly monarchs sighed.

Boom

At this moment, one of the demon caves in the void ahead suddenly shook violently.

A huge crack slowly appeared on one side of the demon cave.

The crack slowly extended and a huge hole appeared.

The Demon Cave had been broken!

“Hahaha, the six divine emperors of the Dragon Palace are too strong, too powerful. Kill, Kill, Kill!”

“They can’t fight back at all. Those demons can’t fight back at all!”

Below, all the citizens of the VELURIYAM domain were in an uproar, cheering excitedly.

The two demon caves were about to be destroyed, and they were safe!

“The Dragon Palace is invincible, the Dragon Palace is invincible!”

Some citizens of the glazed domain shouted loudly.

At the same time, the news quickly spread to the saint realm battle line.

When the citizens of the glazed domain received this news, they revealed an extremely shocked expression.

“The six experts of the Dragon Palace directly destroyed the two great devil dens?”

“Isn’t this Dragon Palace too strong? Those are the two great devil dens. The strength of the two great devil dens is even stronger than our entire glazed domain!”

“From the news that came from the void over there, the two great devil dens did not have the strength to resist at all. The six experts sent by the Dragon Palace all have the combat strength of a rank three void God Emperor. Their strength is incomparably terrifying!”

“Is this the true strength of the Dragon Palace? No wonder that invincible combat technique said that the Dragon Palace could easily destroy the machine royal territory. So It’s true!”

“Great, Great, Great. If the Dragon Palace is willing, perhaps the dragon palace can help us take back the glazed area and return to our homeland!”

Countless people roared in excitement, their eyes wide with excitement.

Who would have thought that the Dragon Palace would be so powerful?

They thought that they would have to go through another big battle and join forces with the Dragon Palace experts to resist the attack of the demon cave.

However, the Dragon Palace only sent six experts and directly destroyed two demon caves.

Such strength was so terrifying!

This was the true terrifying power of the Dragon Palace!

The power of the Dragon Palace also made them excited.

“Roar, the leader of the evil demons on our side has been killed!”

In the Demon Cave of the leader of the evil demons on the battlefield, a voice was heard after a roar.

Three Devouring Dragons flew out, and a devouring dragon in the middle was holding the corpse of the leader of the bewitching evil sprites.

“There are three people on your side, and there are two of them. Go and support them, and finish them as soon as possible!”

Outside the demon lair, the devouring dragons were hunting the bewitching evil sprites, and they said with a smile.

“Haha, I’ll Go!”

A devouring dragon moved and flew into the demon lair of the bewitching evil sprite leader.

“TSK TSK tsk, brothers, well done!”

The eight limbed devil fiend and the others flew over. Their eyes were burning as they stared at the corpse of the bewitching demonic leader under the claws of the Devouring Dragon.

This was the corpse of a rank three void God Emperor.

The resources from a corpse could immediately raise their strength.

“Killing this group of bewitching demonic beasts is a piece of cake.”

A devouring dragon turned into a human and said with a smile.

“Put away these demon corpses and bring the two demon caves back!”

Prime Minister Gui and the others flew over and said with a smile.

“Prime Minister Gui, this demon cave has a great effect on our improvement!”

The Devouring Dragon said with excitement.

The Demon Cave was similar to the divine kingdom, but it was completely different. It was a special energy that had a great effect on the devouring dragon.

“Your devouring dragon can really eat anything!”

The eight-headed demon Fiend and the others said enviously.

“Prime Minister Gui, we’ve finished the job here!”

Soon, three devouring dragons flew out from another demon cave with a corpse in their hands.

“Very good!”

Prime Minister Gui smiled.

There were also evil lairs in the demon cave. The effect of these lairs was the same as the divine kingdom.

If the Dragon Palace wanted to upgrade again, it shouldn’t be a problem to find nine elemental nests in the demon cave.

“Thank you again, everyone! Thank you!”

“Here are the demonic corpses that we killed not long ago. They are all here.”

The domain Lord and the others thanked them respectfully and handed over a few interspatial rings.

“You’re welcome!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded and put away the interspatial rings.

“Prime Minister Gui, I wonder where the Dragon King is now. We have a request!”

The governor looked at Prime Minister Gui and the others, clenched his fist and asked. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Oh? Our Dragon King is still in the Machine Emperor region. What’s the matter, Governor?”

Prime Minister Gui looked at the Governor and asked.

“Prime Minister Gui, the Veluriyam region can not repay you for helping us. For the sake of the billions of citizens of the Veluriyam region, we would like to request the Dragon Palace to help us take back the Veluriyam Region!”

“If we can return to the Veluriyam region, our Veluriyam region is willing to submit to the Dragon Palace. With the Dragon King as our king, we will submit to them!”

As the governor spoke, he bowed.

Around him, the glazed domain divine emperors also bowed and cupped their hands.

The glazed domain was the number one large domain in the resplendent starry sky. However, all of this was already in the past.

The chimei domain had taken over their glazed domain, and all the citizens had nowhere to go.

With the Dragon Palace’s strength, they could help them take back the glazed domain.

And with the Dragon Palace’s strength, they were qualified to submit to them.

The Dragon King only sent six experts of the Dragon Palace and they were able to destroy the two demon caves. How Strong was the Dragon King?

How terrifying was the full strength of the Dragon Palace?

With the Dragon King as their leader, they were not unconvinced.
