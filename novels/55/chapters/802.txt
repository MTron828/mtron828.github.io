Chapter 803: 0804 ambushed them

Translator: 549690339

“I told you, I will let your Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect slowly walk towards destruction and fear!”

When the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect destroyed the Dragon Gate forging workshop and killed the group of DRAKONIDS, Wang Xian was already prepared for a long-term battle.

Let alone a month, he could even play for two months in a year.

Everything was waiting for the nine-headed Hui to break through.

However, during this period of time, Wang Xian would not let them have a good time either.

The disciples of the immortal sect did not dare to come out. Since the immortal god was leading the team, fine, then he would kill the Immortal God.

In the past few days, Wang Xian had forged more than 20 level-13 spirit weapon daggers.

It was difficult for a half-step immortal God to break through the immortal God’s defense with his sharp claws. However, a level-13 immortal God’s weapon could.

Moreover, the attacks launched by more than 200 infant stage powerhouses were enough to drown the immortal God.

If the quality was not enough, the quantity would be sufficient. According to Wang Xian’s estimation, 100 infant stage powerhouses and 20 half-step immortals were enough to easily destroy a lower immortal.

Of course, the prerequisite was to be fully prepared.

The return city was a third-tier city, located next to the Yongchang region.

“Sir, the marriage between us and the Yuwen clan has succeeded. It will be very beneficial to us in the future!”

“Hehe, the little fairy and that kid from the Yuwen clan can be considered to be in love. The marriage this time is mainly to prepare for the future!”

“My lord, if the Yuwen clan is willing to help us, our three immortal sects will be enough to affect the agreement between the immortals and gods. At that time, my Lord will directly destroy that Damn Dragon Gate!”

On the way back to the city, a group of more than a hundred people were walking on the road. Behind them was a special horse beast pulling boxes of items.

Because entering the city, they could only slow down.

The group of Holy Medicine, Holy Medicine, and Immortal sect immortals were talking with fairy hua and the other disciples.

“If the Dragon Gate evacuates them as soon as possible, then they still have a chance of survival. If they dare to oppose us, then the Dragon Gate will be destroyed!”

A cold look flashed across the middle-aged immortal God’s eyes, followed by a faint smile on his face.

The conversation with the Yuwen clan this time was relatively smooth. If they could get the Yuwen clan to speak up for them in the future, and if the Dragon Gate still dared to ambush around their immortal gate, then their immortal God would have to make a move!

“EH, those are the people from the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal Gate!”

“It’s true. How dare the people from the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal Gate Go Out Now? No, there’s an immortal God there!”

“So there’s an immortal God following them. Shh, Keep Your Voice Down. Don’t let them hear you!”

“The Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect is too pitiful now. They even need an immortal god to escort them out!”

At this moment, sounds of conversation could be heard from the surroundings. The faces of the disciples of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect stiffened, and an embarrassed expression appeared on their faces.

Even the immortal God’s expression was ice-cold as he swept his gaze over them.

“Shut up. It Won’t be long before we teach that Dragon Gate a lesson!”

Fairy Hua and a few infant stage experts said with ice-cold expressions.

The few passersby not far away shrunk their heads and hurriedly left. Their strength was far from that of an infant stage expert. They were afraid that the other party would vent his anger on them.

“Damned Dragon Gate. Once we settle the matter of the immortal God agreement, we will immediately destroy them!”

The disciples of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect said with an unsightly expression.

“Boom! Boom!”

At this moment, the entire world suddenly changed color, and the originally clear sky instantly became irritable.

Everyone in the city felt as if the sky was falling, and a situation that seemed like the end of the world suddenly appeared.

From all directions of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect, terrifying attacks instantly attacked.

Dazzling and explosive golden light, demonic Qi that was like an abyss, and terrifying power radiated throughout the entire city.

“Someone is ambushing us, courting death!”

Countless golden light and demonic qi shot towards the two immortal sect experts. The middle-aged immortal God instantly sensed it, and his expression turned cold.

He actually dared to ambush an immortal God, courting death!

“Boom!”

He moved his arm, and a fiery-red staff appeared in his hand. Instantly, towering flames covered all of them.

“What? He actually dared to ambush us? He’s courting death!”

“Sir, kill them! Kill them!”

The expressions of the other disciples of the immortal sect changed drastically. As they felt the energy that was coming towards them, their eyes revealed a trace of fear.

It was too terrifying. That energy that was like an ocean was definitely not something that an infant stage or even a half-step immortal God could withstand.

Could it be that the immortal God was attacking them?

Otherwise, how could there be such a terrifying attack.

“A group of infant realm experts actually dared to ambush me. They’re courting death!”

The middle-aged immortal God’s eyes shot out dense flames, and his entire body was like a god of fire. The Flames rose as he roared.

“This, this...”

However, some of the surrounding martial artists almost wet their pants when they saw the terrifying attack that suddenly appeared.

That energy that could almost destroy the world.

That group of infant realm experts actually dared to attack the immortal God.

The experts of the Dragon Gate actually dared to ambush the immortal God of the Holy Medicine Immortal sect, this...

“At least a hundred infant realm experts!”

Some of the surrounding disciples of the immortal sect had faces full of shock.

The Dragon Gate’s over a hundred infant realm experts actually dared to besiege the immortal God, this was too f * cking awesome! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Boom Boom Boom!”

As if the attack was going to destroy the world, everyone in the city looked over.

The attacks of more than a hundred nascent realm experts collided with the fire defense of the middle-aged immortal God. The terrifying energy collided and extinguished the flames.

The golden light dissipated, and the demonic qi disappeared!

The full-strength attack of a hundred nascent realm experts was only able to clash with the immortal God’s attack. One could imagine how terrifying the immortal God was.

“Stupid thing, you actually dared to ambush the immortal God!”

The terrifying energy dissipated. The middle-aged immortal God swept his gaze around and roared with a face full of frost.

“All of You Must Die!”

He roared loudly, and flames instantly rose from his body.

“Courting death! Courting Death!”

Beside him, the two disciples of the immortal sect looked around excitedly.

The infant realm experts dared to ambush the immortal God. This was something they had never expected. However, they had come to seek death. This was an opportunity for their immortal sect.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

However, at this moment, figures that were emitting white light appeared around the middle-aged immortal God.

Numerous daggers that contained a terrifying aura directly attacked the middle-aged immortal God.

“What? Damn it!”

The middle-aged immortal God’s expression changed slightly. He waved his hand, and a terrifying flame directly blocked it.

“Bang!”

A terrifying collision occurred as the white shadow was sent flying.

“PA PA!”

However, at the side, the terrifying white shadows’daggers landed on the flame defense on his body. The terrifying attacks instantly pierced through the flame defense.

Cracks appeared!

“Scram!”

The middle-aged immortal God’s body trembled as the terrifying power spread out in all directions.

“Peng Peng Peng!”

The five strange monsters were once again sent flying.

“All of you have to...”

The middle-aged immortal God was enraged. Flames danced in his eyes as he raised the staff in his hand.

“Whoosh, Whoosh, Whoosh!”

However, before he could finish speaking, terrifying white shadows appeared once more, and terrifying daggers once again pierced through.
