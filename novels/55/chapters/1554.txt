Chapter 1555: One out of 1555 demons appeared

“There are actually three spiritual herbs of the eighth level of the void interpretation in this area. This is a little strange. I only managed to harvest 20 spiritual herbs of the eighth level of the void interpretation when I reached the deepest part of the Valley!”

Wang Xian looked at the three resplendent sword heart herbs in the middle of the valley and was slightly surprised.

His heart skipped a beat as he scanned the entire valley with his dragon eyes of fire and light.

“As expected, it’s not that simple. Although I don’t know why there are three spiritual herbs of the eighth level of the Seethrough realm in this valley, it’s basically impossible to obtain these three spiritual herbs!”

Wang Xian stared at a spot three meters away from the sword heart grass in the valley. There was a spiritual herb of the dark attribute with a leaf of about one meter.

Underneath this leaf was a dark soul that looked like a ghost.

Only two to three powerhouses at level six of the Seethrough realm would be able to destroy a level six of the Seethrough realm’s dark soul.

However...

Wang Xian swept his gaze across his surroundings. This was not the deepest part of the area. There were more than a thousand people gathered around. Among them, there were only about a hundred people at level three of the Seethrough realm.

The rest were all below level three of the Seethrough realm. There were even quite a number of transcendents.

As long as this group of people dared to touch that sword heart grass, they would definitely die without a burial ground.

“Sword heart grass at the eighth level of the profound void tier, the eighth level of the profound void tier. Our Luck is simply too good!”

An old man stared at the three ice heart grass with blazing eyes, his face revealing an excited expression.

“There are also two to three hundred spirit grass at the profound void tier below. However, there are more than a hundred darkness souls at the third level of the profound void tier!”

A middle-aged man swept his gaze across the entire valley, his eyes flickering.

“Attack! I want to act as soon as possible. Otherwise, when those people from the major factions arrive, we won’t have anything to do with them!”

“Charge! Even if we can’t obtain the insightful void tier eighth level sword heart herb, the remaining spirit herbs are still worth taking action!”

“That’s right! Let’s all attack together! Whoever can obtain the sword heart herb will be the one with the most luck!”

At this moment, the leaders of several teams glanced at everyone around them and shouted loudly.

Each team didn’t dare to rashly charge into the Divine Valley alone. There were more than 100 rank 3 void interpretation realm dark souls.

Only by attacking together could they have a chance to obtain the spirit grass in the deep valley.

“Alright, let’s attack together!”

Everyone around them glanced at each other and nodded in agreement.

They couldn’t delay any longer. If those people from the super forces arrived, those three spirit herbs at the eighth level of the profound void tier would have nothing to do with them.

“Let’s do it!”

An old man shouted loudly, and the more than one thousand people in the surroundings all started to move. They immediately rushed into the Divine Valley, and everyone’s gazes were all burning as they stared at the three sword heart herbs.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

However, the moment they rushed into the Divine Valley, all the Darkness Souls moved.

They attacked all the people who entered the Divine Valley. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Because the darkness souls could enter a person’s body, they had to be careful when dealing with them.

Even if there were more than one thousand people, they had to be careful when dealing with the more than one hundred darkness souls.

“You don’t have to take the other spirit herbs. You must definitely get those three sword heart herbs!”

Bing Jinghuan’s eyes were blazing as he stared at the sword heart herbs in the middle as he spoke to everyone in the Ice Heart Empire.

Amongst the thousand or so people, they were considered to be a relatively strong team. There was a high chance that they would be able to obtain those three sword heart herbs.

Ling Jian ‘er was also staring at the three sword heart herbs with a fiery expression.

The metal attribute sword heart grass was of great help to her cultivation.

In fact, if she obtained the three sword heart grass, she was confident that she would be able to achieve a breakthrough in her strength.

Once she achieved a breakthrough, even the two heaven’s chosen of the so-called supreme sect, the crown prince of Wuqing City and the southern Emperor Wudi, would not be a match for her.

The heartless sword principle, together with the origin gold, could allow her to easily fight against those above her level.

Therefore, she was very eager to obtain the three sword heart grasses.

However, just as they flew into the deep valley, one by one, the souls of darkness came up to them.

“Damn it, finish these damn things as soon as possible!”

Seeing that they were stopped, Bing Jinghuan growled in a low voice with an extremely embarrassed expression.

“Ninth prince, we’ll help you block them. Go and pick up those three sword heart grass!”

The surrounding elders shouted loudly with solemn expressions.

“Alright!”

Bing Jing Huan moved and dodged the attack of the Darkness Souls. He directly flew toward the center.

All the powerful teams in the surroundings also wanted to use this method to break through to the center.

“SH * t, this group of Darkness Souls won’t let anyone get close to the center!”

However, just as Bing Jinghuan flew over a hundred meters, he immediately discovered that two darkness souls were attacking him.

His expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly fled to the back.

In the surrounding area, all the teams that wanted to break through had encountered this problem.

“Kill these guys first!”

An old man’s furious roar came from not far away.

“Jian ‘er seems to want the three sword heart grass!”

Wang Xian, who had been hiding at the back, saw Ling Jian ‘er trying to break through to the center time and time again. However, he was blocked by the soul of darkness.

He raised his eyebrows slightly.

“The sword heart grass is of the metal attribute. It fits Jian ‘er perfectly. In that case, I will help you!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. With a wave of his arm, the evolved Dark Dragon Bead transformed into a demonic dragon. The fist-sized demonic dragon flashed and landed on Ling Jian ‘ER’s body.

“Huh? What’s going on?”

Ling Jian ‘ER was fighting with the soul of darkness in front of her. Suddenly, she realized that the soul of darkness that was attacking her was retreating abruptly.

It was as though it had encountered a terrifying natural enemy and did not dare to attack her.

This caused Ling Jian ‘er to be stunned. However, her gaze shifted as she stared at the sword heart grass in the center.

She hesitated for a moment before flying towards the sword heart grass.

In the surroundings, some of the soul of darkness saw Ling Jian ‘er flying towards the center and revealed a sinister expression.

However, they quickly revealed a terrified expression.

When Ling Jian ‘er saw that there were no darkness souls to stop her, an excited expression appeared on her face as she directly flew towards the sword heart grass.

“Oh no, someone has broken through!”

“Damn it, damn it, it’s the people from the Iceheart Empire!”

In the surroundings, when some people saw Ling Jian ‘er rushing into the deep valley, they revealed expressions of unwillingness and anger.

“Junior sister Jian ‘er!”

Bing Jing Huan’s face revealed an excited expression.

Ling Jian ‘ER’s face was also filled with joy as she directly grabbed towards the sword heart grass.

“Boom!”

However, at this instant, an aura of death completely enveloped it.

Ling Jian ‘ER’s face instantly turned pale as she hurriedly looked towards the bottom of a spirit grass leaf.

A terrifying dark soul was staring at her coldly.

She could feel that this dark soul was at least at the sixth level of the profound void tier!

“It’s over!”
