Chapter 3206: 3205 golden dragon and charming dragon

In the past few days, the ancestral tree had saved Wang Xian twice.

The first time was the terrifying and Bizarre Forbidden Art, heaven pilfering meridian exchange.

The first time was to look directly at the bizarre sculpture.

Both attacks were extremely bizarre and almost caused his death.

However, during the time in the skysea Dragon Palace, the ancestral tree had absorbed the forbidden art and also absorbed half of the skysea Dragon King’s Dragon Soul.

At this moment, there was a black branch beside the branch of the ancestral tree’s soul-returning tree. There were symbols on the black branch and it looked very strange.

On the branch of the soul-returning tree, there was a golden fruit.

The golden fruit was in the shape of a dragon and looked like a golden dragon.

Wang Xian walked over and took a look at the black branch. His gaze landed on the fruit and his eyes sparkled.

“The golden divine dragon fruit is on the soul-returning embryo. Is it able to revive the Metal Elemental Divine Dragon?”

He mumbled to himself. After hesitating for a moment, he walked over and plucked the fruit.

Sensing the power of the fruit, he moved to the front of the dragon transformation pool.

“The golden divine dragon embryo fruit and the dragon bone of the metal elemental divine dragon should be able to create a golden dragon.”

Wang Xian was deep in thought. With a wave of his arm, the dragon bones in the mother nest flew out.

There were more than 100 dragon bones in total. They were all universe knights when they were alive.

Among them, there were more than 10 dragon bones of pure-bred golden dragons.

These dragon bones contained immense pressure.

With a wave of his arm, he threw the more than 10 golden dragon bones into the transforming Dragon Pool.

At the same time, the golden fruit landed around the dozen or so Golden Dragon Bones.

“These dozen or so golden dragon bones can already have the combat strength of more than a dozen universe knights. I hope I can nurture a purebred Golden Dragon.”

Wang Xian muttered.

Purebred divine dragons could fight across three levels. In the Dragon Palace, there were quite a number of dragon species that could fight across three levels.

There was a reason why purebred dragons were the most precious, and that was because of the purity of their bloodlines.

Peak dragon species like Imperial Dragons and thorned dragons were the offspring of purebred dragons and other powerful bloodline creatures.

In other words, because of the purebred dragon bloodline and the mutation, a powerful existence was born.

It was very difficult to replicate the birth of such dragon species.

At the peak of the Divine Dragon Clan, there were no more than 10,000 imperial dragons and berserk dragons.

At that time, over a thousand berserk dragons could form a terrifying army of the Dragon Palace.

If it wasn’t for the Bug clan’s technology, the Dragon Palace wouldn’t have been able to give birth to a peak dragon so easily.

A purebred divine dragon was very important to the dragon palace because if they wanted to mutate another peak dragon, they needed the bloodline of a purebred divine dragon.

Currently, the Dragon Palace only had two purebred divine dragons, the Thunder Dragon and the Divine Wind Dragon.

If a golden dragon could be born, it would be of great benefit to the Dragon Palace.

“I hope I can give you a surprise.”

After taking a look in front of the dragon transformation pool, Wang Xian moved his body and arrived in front of the dragon throne.

Behind the Dragon Throne, the ancestral tree was emitting a faint glow. It made Wang Xian feel as if he was in a mystical realm.

He thought of a figure.

With a wave of his arm, a female snake landed in the middle of the Dragon King’s Hall.

“Ah!”

The female snake appeared and looked around in astonishment. When she saw Wang Xian in front of her, a look of awe appeared on her face.

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

She bowed and greeted him immediately.

“HMM, what treasures did you obtain in the Dragon King’s Hall of the skysea Dragon Palace?”

Wang Xian looked at the female snake and asked.

“Dragon King, I have obtained many treasures from a treasure vault in the Dragon King’s palace. Please take a look.”

As she spoke, she waved her arm and placed some divine herbs and divine artifacts aside.

The divine herbs were in bottles and it was obvious that they were valuable.

The divine artifacts were all very powerful. Two of them were acquired Numinous Treasures.

Other than these, there was also a pair of gloves with a huge golden claw.

The Golden Claw looked like it was made from a dragon claw. To be able to wear it on one’s hand, it was also an exceptionally powerful acquired Numinous Treasure.

“Is this all?”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across and asked with a twinkle in his eyes.

“Yes, Dragon King. When I entered the Dragon King’s Hall, I could only take these things out. Some of them are too powerful and I didn’t dare to touch them.”

“Also, I realized that the Tianhai Dragon King didn’t die.”

The female snake replied immediately.

“HMM, your bloodline isn’t weak. How did you get to such a state? Don’t you have any clansmen?”

Wang Xian nodded his head and looked at the female snake. He asked curiously.

Through his senses, the female snake’s bloodline was very pure. At the very least, she could fight above her level.

In this universe, there was a watershed.

The universe wasn’t fair to begin with. Some races were born strong.

The strong with bloodlines and strong physiques would be of great help to their cultivation.

Later, some of the strong were divided into a few simple divisions.

Those with bloodlines and physiques that could fight above their level, as long as they developed steadily and had powerful spells, could reach the level of a mid-level race in the universe.

Those with bloodlines and physiques that could fight a level higher had powerful techniques and could reach the level of a high-level race in the universe.

And the peak races of today could fight a level higher than three.

This was the power of bloodlines and physiques.

The female snake’s bloodline power was very strong, and she could fight a level higher. However, she looked very miserable.

Once, she was chased by a universe knight, and once, she was chased by other demon beasts.

“I… I escaped from my race.”

The female snake lowered her head slightly and said with a slightly unwilling expression.

Wang Xian nodded and didn’t ask further.

“Do you want to leave or stay in the Dragon Palace?”

Wang Xian asked him.

“I… I’ll stay in the Dragon Palace. It’s too dangerous outside.”

The female snake said weakly.

She had almost been killed twice. She was completely terrified.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded and instructed ao nu, “Bring her around.”

“It’s the Dragon King.”

Ao nu nodded and flew to the female snake’s side.

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the treasures. With a move of his palm, a box appeared in his hand.

It was a taboo item of the Heavenly Dragon Clan.

After hesitating for a moment, Wang Xian waved his arm and the soul-returning tree branch of the Fuchang tree landed on his body.

The Fuchang Tree and the soul-returning tree were both targeted at the soul. They should be able to withstand this weird taboo item.

Wang Xian opened the box and sized up the weird sculpture inside. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The weird sculpture was emitting a strange energy.

Wang Xian landed on the dragon tail on the lower half of the sculpture. Suddenly, he sensed a very familiar bloodline power.

His eyes were filled with astonishment. This dragon tail was forged with the blood of a purebred divine dragon.

“Dragon King.”

At this moment, the female snake who was brought away by Ao nu walked in.

She looked at the sculpture in Wang Xian’s hand with a shocked expression. Her eyes were filled with astonishment.

“Eh? Why are you here?”

Wang Xian looked at her and raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Dragon King, I sensed a strong attractive force, so I came over to take a look.”

The female snake spoke and her gaze landed on the statue.
