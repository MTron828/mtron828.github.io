Chapter 117: The Destructive Devil Monkey

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Jagged peaks of seamounts jutted out from the seabed in the dark.

A pair of bloodshot eyes were exceptionally obvious in the sea as it hugged the tips of the peaks with a hideous and horrifying expression.

A pair of sharp fangs were exposed from its mouth, with its entire body covered with fur.

Wang Xian stared at the Water Monkey, and the monkey did the same too.

Devil Monkey: Level 5

Extractable Dragon Energy: 544

“Devil Monkey?”

Wang Xian was taken aback as he read the information about the Water Monkey. A Water Monkey, standing at 1.5 meters tall, had Level-five strength, which was even more dominating than sharks.

Wang Xian rocked his body and swam towards the Devil Monkey.

Zi zi, Zi zi!

The Devil Monkey screeched the moment it saw Wang Xian approaching. Wang Xian could vaguely hear the message it was trying to convey.

Get out of here. The Devil Monkey told them to get lost.

“Monkeys’ IQ is relatively high. Indeed. A mere Level-five Devil Monkey already has Spiritual Intelligence. Not bad!”

Wang Xian’s eyes brightened up while displaying his imposing disposition.

Roar!

With a soft dragon growl, the Dragon Power enveloped the Devil Monkey immediately.

As a Divine Dragon, his Dragon Power could subdue all creatures lower than his level.

Now, he was already in Level Six. He could subdue all creatures below level six.

Zi zi, Zi zi!

The Devil Monkey was petrified. It let out a frightenful scream and hugged the seamount peak with uneasiness.

“Submit to me!”

Wang Xian yelled softly as the Dragon Power encompassed the Devil Monkey

Zi zi!

Just then, the Devil Monkey hugged its head in pain. It looked up and let out a sharp screeching sound.

The sound traveled far, far away.

“Bad news, Dragon King. It is trying to summon all other Water Monkeys here!”

Upon hearing the sharp shriek, the Prime Minister Turtle behind him had a change in expression. He quickly reminded Wang Xian.

Wang Xian knit his eyebrows slightly. “How many Water Monkeys are there?”

He gazed at the dark waters. The area seemed to span to a dozen kilometers away.

Just when Wang Xian finished his question, he suddenly noticed more and more bright red eyes appearing in front of him.

These Devil Monkeys jumped and leaped around the jagged peaks on the sea bed just like a great army that exuded ferocious devilish aura.

The sharp claws dug into the peaks as they leaped towards them.

“So many of them!”

Wang Xian stared at the mighty Devil Monkeys ahead of him as he was looking shocked.

At least a thousand Devil Monkeys were glaring at them coldly.

“Apart from level five, there are Devil Monkeys in level six and seven!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across all the Devil Monkeys. At the same time, their information appeared in his mind too.

Zi zi!

“Tear them apart!”

At this time, a sharp cry was heard. Wang Xian looked over immediately.

Right in the middle, a Devil Monkey of three-meters tall with a burly body squatted on one of the peaks as it let out a roar!

Zi zi, Zi zi!

Zi zi, Zi zi!

The Devil Monkeys around it reciprocated with high-pitched cries too. The sound of it was extremely sharp even in the water.

One by one, the monkeys leaped and attacked with sharp claws, honed fangs and agile movements.

“Courting your own doom!”

Upon seeing the charging bunch of Devil Monkeys, Wang Xian fired his imposing Dragon Power and encompassed them. All the Devil Monkeys below level six were shuddering and did not dare to move at all.

He stretched out his metal dragon claws at the nearest Level-seven Devil Monkey.

“Courting your own doom. Submit to me or die!”

The Prime Minister Turtle let out a cold bawl. His body was close to the ground as he swept up a massive amount of earth and stones at the dozens of Devil Monkeys.

“Surrender!”

Roving Girl was standing behind. The ocean in front of her swirled and turned into gushes of water currents which she used to attack the Devil Monkeys.

Kaka. “Die!”

Roving Lobster raised his pair of gigantic claws and attacked them.

“Tearing you apart!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The Level-seven Devil Monkey was not afraid of Wang Xian’s incoming attack. With a pair of sharp claws, it reached out to Wang Xian’s head.

“Since you are disobedient, I’ll bash all of you up till you surrender!”

With a swing, Wang Xian’s dragon claws confronted the Devil Monkey’s claw.

The metal dragon claws, accompanied by a tearing sound, turned the entire sea in front of him into a vacuum.

Sss!

As the dragon claws struck across, the Level-seven Devil Monkey was torn into two.

Wang Xian opened his mouth and swallowed it up.

At the bottom of the sea, the Prime Minister Turtle acted like a stone mountain. Pieces of hard soil blocks around him were thrown at the dozens of monkeys in front of him.

Bam!

The massive amount of soil blocks hurled the monkeys against the peaks behind them.

On the right, the Roving Girl was controlling the water as she bound four monkeys with it. The water current strangled their necks to death.

On the left, the Roving Lobster was surrounded by eight monkeys. All of them were quick-moving as they struck their claws occasionally at the Roving Lobster.

But the Roving Lobster had a body of metal. The claws of the Devil Monkeys were only able to leave a few marks on his body.

When the Roving Lobster expanded his pair of claws, the claws were so sharp that he could snap the Devil Monkeys into two once he caught hold of them.

Practicing the Divine Dragon Transformation had allowed them to battle with strengths that were beyond their levels.

For a moment, thousands of Devil Monkeys were entirely suppressed by them.

In less than 20 seconds, they had killed hundreds of Devil Monkeys!

“Submit to me, or else, I’ll exterminate all of you!”

On seeing the dauntless Devil Monkeys, the color of Wang Xian’s body changed violently. Eventually, it stopped at the fiery-red color.

As the Inferno Divine Dragon made his appearance, the seawater around him began to seethe.

Wang Xian opened his mouth, and a fiery-red Dragon Ball appeared inside it.

After his nurturing, the current Dragon Ball was even more formidable than before.

The combined power of the Inferno Divine Dragon and the Fire Dragon Ball doubled.

Roar!

The dragon roar echoed throughout the waters. He opened his mouth and wrapped the Dragon Ball with immense flames. With the Dragon Ball, he lurched forward to attack.

Boom!

The boiling waters were rapidly evaporating as the power of the flame from the Dragon Ball was dominating.

Bam!

The monkeys let out painful cries as the Dragon Ball swept across hundreds of meters ahead.

Some of the weaker ones were incinerated.

Bam!

The Dragon Ball eventually landed on a small peak, crushing the tip of it.

One could see a fiery zone with various types of fish within the thousand meters, killed under such high temperature outside the sea.

“Surrender!” Wang Xian bellowed angrily once again with his roar resounding through the world.

The path to becoming the strongest was built on blood and flesh. Hence, Wang Xian did not have the slightest bit of pity for killing all these Devil Monkeys.

It was his destiny to blaze his way through all obstacles!

Blood and flesh pathed the way to the peak!

Boom!

“How dare you kill my younger generations. Go and die!”

Just then, a seamount peak was split open as a fierce cry was heard.

A Devil Monkey of a size of five meters came into sight.

It was burly and muscular, glaring at them with a pair of bloodshot eyes.

Evil aura lingered around it as it held a seven-meters long metal rod in its hand.

Like a destructive Devil Monkey!
