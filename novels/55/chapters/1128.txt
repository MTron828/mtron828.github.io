Chapter 1129: Floating Sea city, 1,1

Translator: 5496903

“Hu, the spiritual energy in this dragon palace is even richer than some of the kingdoms’paradises. I really don’t understand why the difference between the Phoenix inheritance and yours is SO GREAT!”

Inside the Dragon Palace, Feng Luan looked at the Dragon Palace that covered an area of 80 kilometers with a shocked expression.

On Earth, the Dragon Palace only had an area of 20 kilometers. However, the size of the Dragon Palace here had increased by four times, and the spiritual energy had doubled.

A dragon palace as vast as the bottom of the sea was miles away from the current dragon-phoenix city.

Feng Luan, who had stayed in dragon-phoenix city for more than ten days, followed Wang Xian and the others to the Dragon Palace. She looked around in shock.

“Sister Feng Luan can come to the Dragon Palace frequently in the future. She can even stay here. It’s proven that it’s so close to dragon-phoenix city. It’s only a Ten-minute Flight!”

Guan Shuqing and the rest said with smiles on their faces.

The Dragon Phoenix city was not very far from the Dragon Palace. With Feng Luan’s speed, it would take less than ten minutes.

“This is a good idea!”

Feng Luan did not refuse and nodded with a smile.

In the next few days, Feng Luan spent most of her time in the Dragon Palace.

Wang Xian was also dealing with the matters of the Dragon Palace. Speaking of which, there was nothing much to do. Prime Minister Gui could handle the development and planning of the Dragon Palace.

The only thing that required him to handle personally was the dragon assassin organization.

Currently, the Dragon Assassin organization was preparing to enter other cities.

With the current strength of the dragon assassin organization, more than a hundred level six extraordinary light assassins could definitely assassinate a level eight extraordinary powerhouse. In addition to the group of twenty level seven extraordinary individuals, the dragon assassin organization could completely cover the entire star-moon kingdom.

The speed at which the Dragon Assassin Group earned resources couldn’t be matched by all the members of the Dragon Palace combined.

“What?”

Feng Luan, who was in the Dragon King Palace to check on the situation in dragon-phoenix city, suddenly exclaimed in surprise.

Her eyes were sparkling as she looked at the information she had brought this morning.

“Floating-sea city, a floating-sea city actually appeared in the sea area next to star-moon kingdom!”

Feng Luan’s eyes flickered. She stood up slowly with a contemplative look on her face.

“Wang Xian, let me show you some information!”

She hesitated for a moment before walking over to Wang Xian, who was also reading the information. She passed the information in her hand to him.

“What?”

Wang Xian revealed a curious look on his face. He looked over and asked, “Floating sea city on the sea?”

“What is this?”

He asked in surprise.

“It is similar to the floating island on your earth. It is the private island of the strong. As the island is huge, it is also known as Floating Sea City!”

Feng Luan explained to him.

“The private island of the strong. What is the information on it? Will there be treasures or inheritances left behind by the strong on this island?”

Wang Xian looked at Feng Luan and asked her.

“It’s possible. According to the information I got, there is a formation on this island. However, there is no one on it. It is an ownerless floating sea city. The appearance of this floating sea city has caused a huge commotion. Many forces are rushing there!”

“To be able to possess an expert of the level of floating sea city, one must be at least at level five of the Seethrough Realm or a powerful sect!”

Feng Luan explained to Wang Xian.

“Do you want to go and take a look?”

Wang Xian looked at Feng Luan.

“If you want to develop rapidly, you must have sufficient resources. If Dragon Phoenix city has the spiritual energy density of Your Dragon Palace, how crazy would that be? “Of course, it’s impossible to have the spiritual energy of your Dragon Palace. However, you have to fight for some resources on your own!”

“I have used up a lot of the information I have at the moment. Currently, the dragon-phoenix Empire has not opened up any trade. It’s all because I have taken out the resources. It Won’t last long!”

Feng Luan’s eyes flickered. “I want to go and take a look!”

“You will go personally?”

Wang Xian looked at her in astonishment.

“Yes, the dragon-phoenix Empire is stable now. I can go and take a look. Are You Going?”

Feng Luan asked Wang Xian.

“Is it near Bright Moon City?”

“Yes, I’ll go there too!”

Wang Xian thought for a moment and nodded. The development of the Dragon Assassin organization was about to start in another city.

Bright Moon City was the second largest city in star-moon kingdom. He could make arrangements for the dragon assassin organization this time!

“Alright, I’m only going to take a look this time. There might not be any gains!”

Feng Luan reminded Wang Xian.

“I’m going to deal with the Dragon Assassin organization. The matter in floating sea city is just a side issue!”

Wang Xian smiled.

Feng Luan looked at him and shook her head speechlessly.

“Let’s go. If there’s nothing else, let’s set off now!”

Feng Luan said to him.

“Sure!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and left with Feng Luan after talking to the girls.

He didn’t bring Shu Qing and the rest. They were a little weak and their operation this time might be dangerous.

Wang Xian and the rest flew towards Bright Moon city with 40 strange demons.

“I hope we can get a good harvest. After the expansion of dragon-phoenix city is completed, we can carry out the next step!”

Feng Luan was obviously in a good mood these few days. While flying in the air, she said with a smile on her face.

“Such a huge floating-sea city has been discovered. By now, it should have been completely plundered, right?”

Wang Xian looked at her and asked.

“Don’t worry. With the strength of star-moon kingdom, they don’t have the ability to plunder the entire floating-sea city. They might not even be able to enter now. Right now, the floating-sea city has only revealed one foot. The rest of the places are still in the Maze Formation!”

Feng Luan said to him.

“That’s good. I hope we can get a good harvest!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

Bright Moon city was very far away from Dragon and Phoenix city. It would take at least two days to fly at full speed.

Bright Moon City was much bigger than East Sea city. Its overall strength was only below star-moon city.

Flying in the sky, Wang Xian could be considered to have seen the vast supernatural continent.

There were all kinds of plants and creatures, as well as all kinds of terrain.

There were even trees that were thousands of meters tall. On the trees, there was a type of bird and beast whose strength had reached level five or six of the supernatural realm.

In the wild, it was a paradise for ferocious beasts. They even saw a few groups of demon beasts.

Wang Xian and the rest did not dare to make a move rashly. In star-moon kingdom, there were at most 20 human insightful emptiness realm experts.

However, there were at least 40 to 50 or even more ferocious beasts in the wild that had reached the insightful emptiness realm!

In the wild, if one were to kill wantonly, it would definitely attract the attention of powerful ferocious beasts and demon beasts.

In the past two days, people were out of town. Today, the three chapters were all written in the hotel. There was only so much to write. There were still things to do.

It felt like the quality of the writing had dropped a little!

I’m sorry, readers. There will be an update on the 23rd or 24th of this month. There will be 40 updates on the same day.

When I’m done, I’ll go back and save my manuscript. I’ll update it at the end of the month!
