Chapter 442: Sacred Sect: Dragon Sect (2)

“Weaklings can just stay off or be killed!”

While the surrounding crowd was looking around them curiously, the emotionless voice of a young man resonated.

“Twenty supreme talents! It’s only interesting this way!” said another young man.

“My initial aim was to just have some fun here. However, after seeing so many supreme talents, let me have some real fun!”

“The Outstanding Young Heroes Chart in previous years has been inflated. This year is really interesting. For this year, I’ll declare myself as the champion then!” The voice of two other young men reverberated.

Every single one of them was hugely confident in themselves as they spoke.

They remained exceptionally confident in themselves despite facing the Saints of Sacred Sects and clans, knowing the battle records of Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown, and having the Young Master of Sea Serpent Island around.

This was a form of confidence that only the strong experts possessed.

“Gosh! There are six more Inborn experts hidden within the crowd!”

“Oh my god! The Outstanding Young Heroes Chart only ranks the top twenty. Those who haven’t reached the Inborn Realm can forget about it. Don’t embarrass yourself by participating.”

“The contest would be interesting. Haha! Regardless, I’m not qualified!”

The surrounding crowd was shocked by the young men who spoke. Every single one of them was emanating strong confidence.

At this juncture, all the supreme talents weren’t hiding anymore and stood at the front. Some had their arms crossed while others held longswords in their hands.

Some had their hands behind their back, lifting their heads slightly and displaying the demeanor of an expert.

The surrounding crowd of thousands of people looked at the twenty people in awe and respect.

As for those Half-step to Inborn experts who were still looking to showcase their abilities on the Outstanding Young Heroes Competition, they were feeling extremely bitter.

The competition this year was simply too insane.

“The last few Inborn supreme talents that stood out were all disciples from powerful first-class forces!”

“All the weapons in their hands look extraordinary!”

“Those that could become Inborn experts at this age are undoubtedly outstanding disciples who are the focus of nurturing in their sects. Their weapons and hidden trump cards are definitely terrifying.”

The surrounding crowd discussed fervently.

“Let’s get it started!” Xiao Ran looked across the dozen-odd Inborn experts and showed a faint smile. “Since I’m the youngest, let me choose my opponent first. Qiao Fuzi from Qiao Clan, step forward!”

As Xiao Ran spoke, he got moving and flew to the middle of the arena directly. His eyes were fixed on Qiao Fuzi.

“Dumbass! Today, I’ll put you, who don’t know what’s best for you, on the ground!”

Qiao Fuzi’s expression turned chilling. He leapt into the air and landed before Xiao Ran while staring harshly at him.

“I’ll be taking your sword!” Xiao Ran said plainly while staring at the longsword with savage beast engravings in Qiao Fuzi’s hand.

“Haha! I’ll slice you down with it!” Qiao Fuzi broke into hysterical laughter.

Dang!

The sounds of a treasured sword leaving the scabbard shocked the surrounding martial artists who were carrying longswords.

“The name of this sword is Despondent Sword. I have defeated three Inborn experts with it. You shall be the fourth!”

Qiao Fuzi pointed his Despondent Sword proudly at Xiao Ran.

Shingz!

“The name of my sword is Ancient Spiritual Sword. I have killed more than three Inborn experts with it!”

Xiao Ran drew his Ancient Spiritual Sword directly and met the cold gaze of Qiao Fuzi.

“Sss... Inborn Spiritual Weapons! Two Inborn Spiritual Weapons! F*ck! The people from the Sacred Clans are darned loaded!”

“An Inborn Spiritual Weapon could increase one’s battle strength substantially. Since both of them have Inborn Spiritual Weapons, the outcome of the contest will be dependent on their individual strength!”

“Who do you think will win?”

“Qiao Fuzi is thirty years old this year and his battle experiences are definitely richer than Xiao Ran. Although Xiao Ran is the youngest Inborn expert in the Underworld, his youth is also a weakness! He’s lacking in experience!”

“A demon-like talent like him couldn’t be assessed using common sense. Let’s just watch!”

“Place your bets! Place your bets! You can place your bets on the Underworld website!”

Pa!

Just as the crowd was discussing fervently, Xiao Ran and Qiao Fuzi clashed.

As the Inborn Spiritual Weapons clashed, sounds of metal clashing reverberated through the skies.

Everyone was astonished and watched the battle in the arena attentively.

“Haha! Damn brat! What gives you the guts to be so arrogant with your level of strength?”

After the first collision, Xiao Ran was knocked several steps back. Qiao Fuzi laughed loudly and brazenly as he stared at Xiao Ran with contempt.

Tsk!

Xiao Ran snorted but remained unmoved. He executed his phantom sword technique which was exceptionally frightening.

Qiao Fuzi focused his attention, wiggled his arms and strengthened the golden glow on his Despondent Sword.

“Golden Ray Embodiment!” As he shouted, he turned completely golden and was charging ahead with his sword.

Around the Despondent Sword, golden longswords that were formed from metal attribute energy appeared suddenly.

Over ten golden longswords emitted dazzling rays.

“That’s Qiao Clan’s Golden Ray Embodiment! The Qiao Clan is known for their Golden Ray Blades. They are extremely deadly and incomparably domineering.”

The surrounding crowd was shocked to see Qiao Fuzi emitting golden rays.

“Qiao Fuzi, together with his Inborn Spiritual Weapon, could match those experienced Inborn experts in battle!”

“It will be hard for Xiao Ran to clinch the victory. What a shame!”

The crowd around the arena was analyzing the battle as it progressed. Several members of the Qiao Clan revealed satisfying expressions and looked mockingly in the direction of the Xiao Clan.

However, a few Elders from the Xiao Clan were smirking. This was just the beginning. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Golden Ray Embodiment?

Looking at the blinding golden rays, Xiao Ran squinted his eyes and flexed his body.

Boom!

A chilling yet scorching blue flame was emitted from his body creepily.

The flames covered the Ancient Spiritual Sword and Xiao Ran, turning him into a man burning in blue flames.

“Have a taste of my Tranquil Blue Heavenly Flame!”

Xiao Ran swung his long sword and creepy blue flowers emerged around him.

“This move is called Tranquil Blue Flowers!”

Xiao Ran charged ahead without fear.

“Heavenly Flame! Oh gosh! It’s a Heavenly Flame!”

“Sss! He got a Heavenly Flame! In the entire Underworld, there are probably only two to three people who possess a Heavenly Flame. Moreover, every single one of them is exceptionally powerful.”

Several members of the Qiao Clan were taken aback as their expressions turned gloomier.

“What?”

Qiao Fuzi was also shocked to see Xiao Ran shrouded in blue flames.

Weng!

At this instant, the swaying Tranquil Blue Flowers clashed heavily with the Golden Ray Blades and resulted in frightening explosions.

As the blue flame contacted the golden blades, the golden blades dissipated one after another.

Bam!

The Ancient Spiritual Sword slashed downward and blue sparks sputtered. Qiao Fuzi was flabbergasted as he saw the flames land on him.

“This is bad!”

His golden body was easily penetrated by the Tranquil Blue Heavenly Flame and the terrifying temperature sent chills down his spine.

Rumble!

Qiao Fuzi gathered the golden rays towards his chest as he retreated rapidly.

The golden rays withstood the attack for a moment before falling onto the floor of the arena.

Pa Pa!

Two one-meter-deep holes appeared instantly.

“What an incredible Heavenly Flame. The arena was forged using the toughest stone from Huashan. Yet, the Heavenly Flame was able to burn out such terrifying holes!”

The crowd’s eyes contracted unconsciously as they witnessed the deep holes on the ground of the arena. Even the Inborn experts frowned upon witnessing the strength of the Heavenly Flame.

Qiao Fuzi’s face was covered in cold sweat as he stared at the potholes caused by that blue Heavenly Flame. He was exceptionally impressed and frightened.

“Aren’t you going to admit your defeat? If the Tranquil Blue Heavenly Flame landed on your body, you wouldn’t be able to withstand it!”
