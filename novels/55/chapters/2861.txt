Chapter 2862: bright starry sky, Dragon King 3 of the Dragon Palace

“Eh? That young man doesn’t seem to be afraid at all. Could it be that he has a trump card?”

“God-emperor wind destruction seems to have some misgivings about that young man. What’s going on?”

“Didn’t that young man suffer heavy injuries when he fought with the disciples of the eight desolates? What happened to god-emperor wind destruction now?”

The surrounding people were slightly shocked when they saw Wang Xian standing there nonchalantly. They whispered to each other when they saw god-emperor wind destruction’s vigilant look.

Behind Wang Xian, Hong Fengyan frowned slightly when she saw Wang Xian’s figure. Her eyes were filled with bewilderment.

To her, Wang Xian was very mysterious and extremely mysterious. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

However, she had tested his strength before. He was even weaker than the immortal king level six that she sensed when she first met him.

Now that she saw how calm he was when he was facing the god of destruction, could he have some trump card?

Everyone around looked on in astonishment.

“Boss Wang, if we can’t make it, we’ll run!”

Invincible battle technique muttered softly when he saw this scene.

Wang Xian stared at the Celestial Emperor of wind destruction, and a cold look slowly appeared in his eyes.

Buzz Buzz

However, at this moment, Wang Xian sensed the communication stone plate in the mother nest trembling.

There was a message from the Heaven Formation on it.

“Dragon King, we have already sensed your location. We will arrive in 75 seconds, 75 seconds.”

When Wang Xian saw this message, he narrowed his eyes slightly.

The aura that was surging from his body disappeared.

He smiled and stood there indifferently.

“HMM?”

When everyone saw Wang Xian’s smile, they were slightly shocked. How could he still smile at this moment?

Even the god-destroying wind god was slightly shocked as he revealed a vigilant expression.

The atmosphere was silent for ten seconds.

Ten seconds later, Wang Xian was still standing there. His smile had already disappeared. He closed his eyes and waited quietly for the time to come.

Ten seconds was already a long time for everyone around him.

“Didn’t he want to witness the strength of the god-destroying wind god?”

“What’s going on? is he standing there and not moving? Is he holding back his ultimate move?”

Everyone around looked at the scene with their eyes closed and revealed a curious expression.

It had already been ten seconds, yet he was still standing there.

The sounds of discussion rang out. The god of wind destruction, who was standing in front of them, frowned slightly and was on high alert.

However, another ten seconds passed. Wang Xian was still standing there with his eyes closed.

“What is this guy doing?”

“He was severely injured in the battle with us disciples of the eight barren. Now, he wants to fight us? He must be faking it!”

“Twenty seconds have passed. What is this guy doing?”

Another ten seconds passed. The group of strong disciples of the eight barren were a little agitated. They looked at Wang Xian, who was standing there with his eyes closed. A cold look appeared in their eyes.

What is this guy doing?

Time passed by second by second.

“D * mn, is this guy trying to act cool? Standing there motionlessly?”

“It’s very possible. I think he’s trying to act cool. It’s already been half a minute and he’s closing his eyes in front of the god-destroying wind emperor. Is He trying to act cool?”

“I think he’s trying to stall for time on purpose to see the abilities of the god-destroying wind emperor. What does he have to show us?”

After another ten seconds, the surroundings became noisy.

He said that he wanted to see the abilities of the god-destroying wind celestial emperor. Half a minute had passed and he was still standing there with his eyes closed.

“This… This is too pretentious. He is even better than invincible in battle techniques!”

The middle-aged men behind Tian Xin looked at Wang Xian in a daze and could not help but complain.

They really thought that this young man would unleash such a powerful attack. They didn’t expect him to be showing off.

God-emperor of wind destruction stood there with an impatient look in his eyes.

He stared at Wang Xian with a murderous look in his eyes.

Earlier on, because he had seen this young man being sent flying from the depths of the windless forest valley, he thought that he had a powerful trump card.

However, he was still there with his eyes closed.

What was the meaning of this?

Was he playing with him?

God-destroying wind stared at him coldly.

Ten seconds passed in the blink of an eye.

“Are you playing with us?”

The burly elder Zhou couldn’t help but shout with a cold face.

Everyone’s gaze was focused on Wang Xian.

At this moment, everyone had a feeling that they were being teased.

Forty seconds had passed. If they were to delay any longer, it would be one minute. He would just close his eyes and act pretentious here!

“Does this guy want to live a few more seconds?”

“I think so. Is He playing this game? There are no energy fluctuations on his body. Is this guy trying to delay his death?”

“Die early and reincarnate early. What’s the point of being pretentious here? What a joke!”

The people around could not help but speak. Their eyes were filled with mockery.

“Master Feng!”

At the back of the god of wind destruction, guardian bhang, who was holding a horsetail whisk, shouted. His gaze was fixed on Wang Xian.

“Ten seconds. In ten seconds, if you guys still don’t leave, Don’t blame me for not giving God Emperor Shangshui and the holy region any face!”

Wind destruction god Emperor’s patience had also disappeared. He stared at invincible battle technique, Hong Fengyan, and the others and issued a final warning.

While they were talking, more than ten seconds had passed.

Now, it was already close to sixty seconds.

“Invincible battle technique, come over quickly!”

“Big Brother Invincible, come over quickly. Otherwise, lord wind destruction god Emperor will really make a move!”

When Tian Xin and the rest heard God Emperor of wind destruction’s final warning, they shouted at him anxiously.

“Master!”

Ye Lui Ying and the rest clenched their fists tightly and shouted at Hong Fengyan with pale faces.

Hong Fengyan stared at Wang Xian and frowned slightly. She stood there without saying a word!

“Ahem, boss Wang, do we have any ideas? If not, let’s escape. I have the life-saving treasure that my master gave me!”

Invincible battle technique became anxious when he saw the situation. He transmitted his voice to Wang Xian.

He had the life-saving treasure in his hands. However, the chances of him escaping from an immortal emperor were very small.

“Sixty-eight seconds!”

Wang Xian did not reply invincible battle technique. Instead, he spat out four words calmly.

“Hehe, you guys are really loyal. However, it’s good too. You Can’t be born in the same year but die in the same month!”

Ten seconds passed. God-emperor of wind destruction swept his gaze across invincible Hong Fengyan and the rest. Waves of terrifying aura burst out from his body.

“Invincible, leave quickly!”

Tian Xin shouted from the side in shock.

“You’re bluffing, HMPH!”

God-emperor of wind destruction said coldly.

“You’ve been acting tough for more than a minute. It’s worth it to die a minute later!”

At the back, the three guardians of the Barrens said coldly.

At this moment, nearly ten thousand people had gathered around. They were all looking at Wang Xian mockingly.

Initially, they did not have any dislike for this young man. However, when he stood there with his eyes closed and acted tough for more than a minute, the people around him felt a little disdainful.

Other people were at least struggling on the verge of death. Are you trying to stall for time on the verge of death?

“Since you are not leaving, I will kill all of You First!”

God-destroying wind waved his arm and wind swords appeared in the wind prison where Wang Xian and the rest were imprisoned, aiming at them.

“73 seconds!”

Wang Xian looked at the appearance of the wind swords and sensed a familiar aura. A smile appeared on his face!
