Chapter 2888: 2,888 dragon punishment 4

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

A storm, an incomparably terrifying storm!

In front of Wu Mountain, the seven great array formations enveloped the area.

The Seven Wind Divine Dragons that were the first to fly over roared when they saw Wu Ying attacking them.

Their wings flapped rapidly.

In an instant, the entire sky seemed to have undergone an extremely terrifying transformation.

At its peak, the sky array might be stronger than a rank two divine emperor, the wind god Dragon. However, the three of them, the wind god Dragon, could kill the sky array in an instant.

The two sky arrays at their peak were comparable to the three rank two divine emperors of the Dragon Palace, the Wind God Dragon.

As for the Wizards, they predicted that with Wushan’s defense, it would be able to withstand the three sky arrays at its peak.

Of course, there was another prerequisite, which was that he, the monarch, and the other divine emperors would attack together.

Hence, when the nine wind divine dragons attacked, the world in front of Wu Mountain changed!

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The sound of wind laws reverberating instantly enveloped the entrance of Wu Mountain.

A terrifying hurricane attacked Wu Ying directly.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The Witch Shadow formed by the spell formation rushed forward without any intelligence.

A violent collision sounded and the enormous witch shadow slowly collapsed.

The terrifying hurricane continued to charge forward as if it was going to destroy the world.

“This…”

Just the attack of the nine wind divine dragons caused the wizard monarch and all the experts and disciples of the two forces to stop.

They looked at the incoming hurricane in shock, their hearts beating fast.

It was too fast.

The attack of the wind dragons was too fast.

In the first round of collision, the shadow of the spell formation collapsed.

The terrifying hurricane continued to attack them.

“Those nine creatures roared just now. Are they the wind dragons? Wind Dragons!”

Tian Chen opened his eyes wide and looked at the attack in front of him in shock!

“All members of the Magus Guild, Attack, Attack!”

“Reinforce the formation, reinforce the formation!”

Seeing this scene and hearing Tian Zi’s voice, the Magus’heart pounded violently as he roared.

“Purgatory world, block it for me!”

With a loud roar, the formation diagram floating on his body flew straight towards the hurricane in front of him. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Kill, Kill, Kill!”

All the powerful disciples on the surrounding Shaman Mountain reacted and immediately roared loudly.

Streams of energy directly covered the area in front of them.

Billions of people launched their own attacks, and like a natural disaster, they covered everything in front of them.

“Boom, Boom, Boom!”

The sound of explosions rang out, and the intense sound covered everything.

The hurricane was blocked, and it was stuck in the void.

Half of the world of wind was a world of chaos.

Slowly, the world of wind was destroyed.

All the attacks from the imperial court of the Cheng Sorcerer Association were not something the nine wind divine dragons could withstand.

But even so, the fact that the nine wind divine dragons were able to force them to this point was already very terrifying!

“Keke, bear the wrath of the Divine Dragons!”

Ba Qi roared and moved forward to attack.

At the very front, more than ten Dragon Palace emperors also charged forward. Their bodies carried a terrifying might.

“Wu Wu Wu!”

“Wu Wu Wu!”

Little Blue and the others raised their heads and let out a low roar as they charged towards the formation in front of them.

“Defend, defend with all your strength. Activate all the arrays!”

When the Magus saw all the energy from the Dragon Palace attacking, his expression was extremely ugly.

“Oh no, Sir Magus. Those three divine dragon-like creatures in the middle are all rank two void God Emperor Experts!”

As the Magus’voice faded, a god Emperor from the Magus Union shouted with an abnormally ugly expression.

“There are four rank two god Emperors in the Dragon Palace!”

The Emperor clenched his fists and roared.

They had clearly sensed the attack of the nine wind divine dragons.

This power was very strong.

Now that there were more than ten God emperors from the Dragon Palace attacking, how could they defend?

“It’s not that we can’t defend. With all the arrays activated, we can at least defend against four to five rank two god Emperors!”

The wizard gritted his teeth and roared loudly.

“Kill!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his body moved and flew up into the sky, casting formation after formation around him.

The strength of the Dragon Palace had completely exceeded their expectations.

Especially the number of rank two divine emperors.

“Four to five rank two divine emperors? Then even if the Dragon King has reached rank two divine emperors, he should be able to defend!”

The monarch’s eyes flashed when he heard the Wizard’s words.

He moved and rushed into the sky, launching attacks forward.

“Heaven Secret Killing Array, Attack!”

A God Emperor of the Wizard Association controlled the array with a solemn expression and blocked the Dragon Palace’s divine emperors.

Each of the seven arrays was powerful.

It was not an exaggeration to say that the array here could kill a rank one divine emperor.

However, there were too many divine emperors in the Dragon Palace.

The shamanic shadow array was instantly destroyed.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Countless wind blades covered the front and attacked the divine emperors of the Dragon Palace.

However, this array posed no threat to AO Qitian and the other divine emperors.

“They’re fighting!”

“The strength of the Dragon Palace seems to be beyond our expectations. Those nine creatures call themselves the wind divine dragons. Could they be real divine dragons?”

“Those nine divine dragons are so powerful. Hiss, they broke through a great formation of the Witch Formation Association in an instant!”

“The great battle has completely erupted. The strength displayed by the Dragon Palace is very terrifying. Can the Witch Formation Association withstand it?”

Some of the powerful warriors hiding in the sky shaman realm in the surrounding void trembled slightly when they saw the battle erupt completely and felt the waves of mighty energy.

They would not even be left with a speck of dust after entering such a war.

“Wu Wu Wu!”

“Connect the mountain and boundless Earth Great Array, block that gigantic beast.”

At this moment, Little Blue’s figure had already arrived in front of the Magus Mountain. The Magus looked at little blue and ordered with an extremely gloomy expression.

He had fought with little blue before, and he could not do anything about it.

Looking at little blue, his expression kept changing.

He was confident that the Magus Union could withstand four to five rank two divine emperors, but this was only against ordinary rank two divine emperors.

This huge beast was very terrifying. It could probably crush those of the same level.

“Mountain Boundless Earth Grand Array, Mountain Earth Soul, Defend!”

Below, a group of Magus Union experts heard the Magus’order and activated the mountain boundless Earth Grand Array!

Numerous Earth Mountains condensed from laws appeared out of thin air and attacked little blue.

“Woo Woo!”

Little Blue saw the mountains that were attacking him, and gray energy radiated from her body as she crashed heavily into the mountains.
