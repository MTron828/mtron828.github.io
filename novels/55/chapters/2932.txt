Chapter 2933: conquering the machine imperial region 8

“Warning warning, retreat quickly! Retreat quickly!”

The urgent warning sounded in the creator’s mind, causing him to be shocked and furious.

The strength of this dragon palace was actually so terrifying.

The strength of that Dragon King was actually so strong.

With his current giant body, even against a domain lord, the creator wasn’t afraid at all.

This body of his had gathered the best treasures and metals in the entire machine imperial region.

Within the core, there were many secret treasures that provided power for him.

However, facing the Dragon King’s terrifying speed, he actually did not have the slightest ability to resist.

His terrifying speed was not something that a level 3 divine emperor expert could possess.

“Run, I can’t be defeated!”

“No, I can’t just run away like this. I have to kill a divine dragon. As long as I kill one, I will be able to make up for my losses!”

The creator kept calculating in his mind. When he saw the Dragon King attacking him again, he let out a low roar.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

“Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!”

On his body, numerous powerful weapons were fired at Wang Xian.

The bullets were made of god-level metal, and the powerful laser weapons were enough to destroy more than a dozen planets.

Countless energies were directed at Wang Xian.

“Target the wind god Dragon. All the Mechanical Corps, kill one wind god Dragon at all costs!”

At the same time, he gave an order in his heart.

“Roar!”

“Ka Ka Ka!”

“Kill a divine dragon, kill Kill Kill!”

At this moment, all the cyborgs and mechs on the battlefield suddenly changed their targets and attacked the nine wind dragons crazily.

All the cyborgs on the battlefield suddenly changed their targets, shocking the nine wind dragons who were wreaking havoc.

They were not strong enough to fight against all the mechs.

“Ao Feng, be careful. These guys are targeting you. I think they want to kill you!”

Prime Minister Gui reminded them loudly when he saw this scene.

“All the Dragon Palace emperors, restrain the guys in front of you. Don’t let them break free and attack the Wind Dragons.”

He roared again.

“Why are they attacking us so crazily? We can’t even kill as many as the devouring dragon and the others!”

A female wind god dragon shouted softly to express her dissatisfaction.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

However, in the next moment, countless attacks swarmed toward him.

“Roar! Roar!”

The Wind God Dragon roared and quickly dodged to the side.

“HM?”

Tian Chen saw the automaton army targeting the 9 wind god dragons, he was shocked too.

With a wave of his arm, each of them were able to defend against an undying level 2 defensive formation, rushing towards the 9 Wind God Dragons.

“Howl Howl, many thanks to Tian Chen’s support, Kill!”

The 9 wind god Dragons felt the defensive formation in front of them and roared.

Their huge bodies directly withstood the rain of weapons as they attacked the warframe warframes.

“Hong Hong Hong!”

Their huge claws grabbed onto the warframes, causing them to crumble.

“Damn it, damn it.”

The creator felt the information being transmitted from his surroundings and was panicking.

He discovered that the array master from the Dragon Palace was extremely terrifying. He couldn’t compare to an ordinary void God Emperor Level 3 expert.

A Dragon King and a powerful array master could fight against five to six undying God king rank 3 experts.

How could the machine emperor region fight against them!

“I calculate the victory rate to be zero, the victory rate is zero!”

“I suggest you flee, immediately flee!”

The creator’s mind was filled with notifications. He was filled with shock and anger as he watched the Dragon King easily sweep past his body.

At this moment, he knew that he was definitely not a match for the Dragon King. At this moment, he could only flee.

“I’m not resigned. Our machine royal territory has no enmity with Your Dragon Palace. Why are you attacking us? !”

The creator shouted at Wang Xian furiously.

“Hehe, creator, don’t you find it funny to say such words?”

Wang Xian said to the creator mockingly.

“Roar Roar!”

He lowered his hand and moved his body. In an instant, he arrived at the head of the Creator.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

The head of the creator was extremely huge. A pale white aurora shot toward Wang Xian.

However, Wang Xian easily dodged this attack. The incipient saint wings on his back drew a long scar on his head.

The Mark went deep into the center of his head.

At this moment, the creator looked a little unbearable.

“Dragon King, die!”

All of a sudden, the creator let out an extremely violent roar. Two of his arms flew out from his body and attacked Wang Xian directly.

Each of his arms was the size of a planet. They were made of powerful metal and were the combination of the most advanced technology of the machine royal territory.

Boom

Boom! Boom! Boom

The two arms chased after Wang Xian. Streams of flames were emitted from the position of his palms. It was abnormally terrifying.

Faced with the Creator’s desperate attack, Wang Xian responded with vigilance. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Run!”

At this moment, a hole appeared at the creator’s chest.

In the hole, there was a mechanical brain.

The entire brain was wrapped by the bright theory of light and a liquid that was emitting blue light. Suddenly, it flew out from the creator’s body.

The speed at which it flew out was abnormally terrifying.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian, who was dodging the attacks of the two gigantic arms, sensed that something was escaping. His pupils constricted slightly as he stared at the heart.

“What is that? The core of the Creator?”

“He wants to escape!”

Wang Xian focused his gaze as his dragon body swayed.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The primaless saint wings were unleashed to its limits as the dragon claws attacked the two arms in a frenzy.

“Crack Crack Crack!”

The sounds of the arms being destroyed rang out.

“Heaven Array, let’s destroy the creator together!”

Wang Xian immediately roared out loud.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

At this moment, all the threats on this side had been dealt with by the Heaven Array. All the battleships and weapons that could unleash the level 2 attack power of the void God emperor were destroyed by him.

Hearing the Dragon King’s order, the sky array did not hesitate and quickly set up the array.

“Split!”

“Dragon King, be careful!”

Soon, an array formation was formed. Many intersecting rays of light appeared in front of the creator and directly attacked the creator’s giant body.

“Hong Hong Hong!”

The creator stared at the countless intersecting rays of light and immediately raised an incomparably huge defense to block the intersecting rays of light.

Bang! Bang! Bang

The array split apart and landed on the Creator’s defense, causing the rising defensive metal to slowly crack apart.

However, the energy used to split the array had also been exhausted.

“Kill!”

At this moment, Wang Xian charged over. His dragon claws clawed at the creator’s head once again!
