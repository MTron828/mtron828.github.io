Chapter 1641: 1641 stepped onto the stage of the continent

Little Blue flew, slowly swaying her body as she flew towards the dragon-phoenix Empire’s domain.

In this vast region, second-rate and first-rate powers no longer existed.

Today, the agreement between the three superpowers and the dragon-phoenix Empire could decide the fate of the entire region.

The three superpowers had agreed to give half of the vast region’s domain to the dragon-phoenix Empire. As for the remaining cities and smaller powers, they didn’t dare to have any objections.

For the next period of time, the dragon and Phoenix Empire only needed to control one city after another.

In the ruins of the divine kingdom, the three superpowers and everyone below watched Wang Xian and the rest leave with shock and embarrassment on their faces.

“Xiao Xian, do you want to move the Dragon Palace to the barren sea?”

On Xiao Lan, Lan Qingyue looked at Wang Xian and continued, “The ferocious beasts and demonic beasts in the barren sea have basically been devoured by Xiao Lan!”

“The sea of desolation is located in the north of the vast region. It is not far from the ruins of the divine kingdom. There are more resources in the ruins of the divine kingdom than in the ocean. We can totally transfer the Dragon Palace here.”

“Furthermore, the development of the Dragon Palace in the future will mainly be based on the forging workshop. The profits from the forging workshop alone will enable the rapid development of the entire Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian said to her.

Lan qingyue nodded. This time, they had killed about 60,000 powerhouses in the vast region. Together with the resources they had, the members of the Dragon Palace would be able to receive a huge boost.

In the future, the resources obtained from the forging of weapons by the Fire Hammer clan alone would be able to increase the number of void interpretation stage powerhouses in the Dragon Palace by more than ten a day.

Creating a third or fourth level insightful void realm expert in three or four days was also possible.

One or two years later, the Dragon Palace’s strength would definitely be able to suppress the three super forces.

“The Dragon and Phoenix Empire’s imperial palace will be moved to the vast region this time. The flowing sea region will be managed by the former Light Dragon Empire’s long family!”

Feng Luan said from the side.

Half of the vast region’s territory was about five times the area of the flowing sea region. As for the resources, they weren’t something the flowing sea region could compare to.

Even a place like the LADYBOY graveyard was not as good as the base of a first-rate force in the vast region.

Furthermore, she had an even grander plan.

That was, not long after the vast region was completely unified, the sixth great empire of the transcendental continent would be established.

Such a grand feat might take thousands of years in Feng Luan’s original plan, but now, she could complete it in less than ten years after returning to the transcendental continent.

It was all because of the man beside her.

Feng Luan looked at him and smiled.

The Dragon and Phoenix Empire returned triumphantly.

In the next half a year, the Dragon Palace moved and the Dragon and Phoenix Empire moved their capital.

The Sea of desolation was the largest ocean in the vast area. The ocean was connected to the main sea of the extraordinary continent, the extraordinary sea.

In the extraordinary sea, there was another area called the Dragon Sea.

The Dragon Sea was the land of the dragon race. That area occupied a quarter of the sea of transcendence.

Moreover, all the demon beasts in the sea of transcendence were under the control of the dragon race, or the dragon race was the king.

The area of the sea of transcendence was equivalent to five to six earths.

The area of the five great empires added together was almost as big as the sea of transcendence.

All the powerful demon beasts and fierce beasts in the barren sea were basically swallowed by little blue, which made the barren sea within a million kilometers seem a bit desolate.

At the bottom of the sea, which was more than ten thousand kilometers away from the barren sea, a huge dragon palace stood tens of thousands of meters deep in the sea.

Within a hundred and fifty kilometers of the Dragon Palace, there were many tall and sturdy guards patrolling around the dragon palace like divine weapons. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Inside the Dragon Palace, there were spiritual herbs and trees that were emitting spiritual energy. Each of them would cause a huge fight if placed outside.

In the Dragon Field, the warriors of the Dragon Palace were sparring.

On the left was a group of mountains. In the mountains, thousands of members of the fire hammer clan were forging all kinds of weapons and equipment.

At the front, the huge, majestic and beautiful Dragon King Palace was exuding endless majesty.

Above the Dragon King’s palace, Wang Xian was enjoying the pleasure of being with everyone.

Ever since the matters in the vast region were resolved half a year ago and the Dragon Palace was relocated to the Dragon King’s Palace, everything was handed over to Prime Minister GUI to handle.

Meanwhile, Wang Xian began to lead a licentious life.

Ling Jian ‘er was found and her worries were completely resolved. Lan Qingyue was back, which made Wang Xian exceptionally happy.

Every day, he stayed in the Dragon King’s bedroom with eight girls for half a month.

Every day, he killed his way in and out, and the sky was dark.

“Where is Your Dragon King? Is He in the bedroom again?”

In the Dragon Palace, Feng Luan entered the Dragon King’s palace with a displeased expression and asked Prime Minister Gui.

“Yes, Emperor Feng. Our Dragon King and the Dragon Queen are in the bedroom!”

Prime Minister Gui smiled embarrassedly and didn’t dare to offend Feng Luan.

As a Prime Minister Gui who was well-versed in the human world, he naturally didn’t dare to offend Feng Luan as he thought that this emperor Feng had unknowingly become their Dragon Queen.

In the entire Dragon Palace, apart from the eight dragon queens, one emperor Feng and the eldest princess, he was considered the boss.

“Sister Feng Luan, do you want me to call my brother!”

At this moment, Xiao Yu walked in with Feng Lingtian’s arm on his arm and said with a smile.

Feng Lingtian stood beside Xiao Yu and looked in the direction of the bedroom with envy.

He was envious, but he did not dare to. A Bone Dragon’s wife was about to break his bones.

In the past half a year, he had obtained an enormous amount of resources. All the girls, including Xiao Yu, had reached the seventh level of the profound void martial stage.

They could fight against the eighth rank of the profound void martial stage.

At the same time, Feng Lingtian could fight against the eighth rank of the profound void martial stage.

Feng Luan had given them the resources to help them improve their strength.

Now that the dragon-phoenix Empire controlled half of the territory of the flowing sea and the vast area, they had more profits than the Dragon Palace.

A large part of Feng Luan was used to cultivate experts.

However, it was much more difficult to nurture other experts compared to Guan Shuqing and the rest.

Guan Shuqing and the rest of the girls were able to raise their levels as long as they had the resources.

Speaking of which, the group of girls could be considered an elder group of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire.

“Go, there’s something we need to talk to him about!”

Feng Luan said with a dark expression.

Every time she came to the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian would drag eight girls and not come out of the bedroom. This made her very angry.

What was in this guy’s mind.

“Feng Luan, what’s the matter?”

Not long after, Wang Xian stretched his back and flew out. He flew over with a smile on his face.

“Get your men to help forge some weapons!”

Feng Luan rolled her eyes at him when she saw his expression and said directly.

“Sure, just go to the fire hammer clan and give your orders!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.
