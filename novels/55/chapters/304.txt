Chapter 305: Arts of Refining Elixr Pills

A storm was over just like that.

However, it did not affect the ebullient mood of the girls at night.

The next day, the four ladies knocked on Wang Xian’s door at 4 am or 5 am as they dragged him to see the flag-raising ceremony, all in high spirits.

Wang Xian was speechless. Sometimes, women’s energy was beyond imagination.

After watching the flag-raising ceremony, they went to the famous bun shop in Shang Jing to have some buns.

Subsequently, they went shopping again. Wang Xian could only help to carry their shopping bags behind them as he watched the four pretty ladies walking into stores, one after another.

It was only after just past 3 pm in the afternoon that they stopped after receiving Sui Huang’s call.

“This is insane!”

Wang Xian let out a brief sigh. The group took a car and came to an ancient district in Shang Jing.

This place was known to be old and ancient because it was filled with Siheyuan.

In Shang Jing, an ancient Siheyuan could easily cost a few hundred million. It was not easy to get a place here even if one was wealthy.

However, there was a mountain known as Shengsui Mountain just right behind the Siheyuan.

Many people did not know why it was named Shengsui Mountain. Only those who knew called it Sui Family, Sacred Mountain. [1]

There were three Sacred Mountains in Shang Jing, which represented three powerful Sacred Clans in Shang Jing.

When Wang Xian and the rest drove a car to somewhere near, someone from the Sui Family Sacred Clan would guide them around.

“Great nanny, please follow me!” said a middle-aged man to Guan Shuqing respectfully as he led the way ahead into Shengsui Mountain.

“Okay!”

Guan Shuqing nodded as she looked around with curiosity. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

They were surrounded by Siheyuan. Most of them were connected, and the doors were not closed within.

Groups of well-dressed Sui Family members were either dressing up or exchanging conversations.

Most of them were talking about Sui Family’s Laozu accepting a disciple. [2]

They were in awe of it when they were talking about it.

From there, one could tell Sui Huang’s status in Sui Family.

“Does the entire region belong to Sui Family?”

Xiao Yu was surprised as she looked around. There were hundreds of Siheyuan around them, spanning an area of several kilometers. This seemed like a small village.

“Yes, this is Sui Family’s territory. Our sacred mountain is just ahead!”

The middle-aged man smiled and nodded. He was a little proud, as this was the strength of Sui Family.

“Impressive!”

Xiao Yu, Lan Qingyue, and the rest were slightly stupefied. Just these Siheyuan of Sui Family were worth close to $100 billion. Besides, not everyone could get Siheyuan even if they had the money.

The gang followed the middle-aged man into the mountain.

The entire Shengsui Mountain was landscaped. The peak stood at about forty to fifty meters tall, which was not very high. A cave was found at the center of the mountain.

A domineering flame seemed to be coming out from that cave.

There were quite a number of houses on the mountain that resembled ancient buildings.

“Laozu is staying in this room. You may go in!”

The middle-aged man pointed to a house.

“Sure!”

Guan Shuqing nodded, and the group walked into the room.

“Master!”

“Come in!”

Sui Huang’s voice was heard. After Wang Xian entered the room, they saw him sitting in a chair, reading a book in his hand.

“My disciple!”

Sui Huang put down his book and smiled. He was wearing the uniform of Sui Family, with no hair out of place. Every move that he made exuded the superior vibe of an expert.

He looked very different from how he had looked back in Rivertown.

“Master!” Upon seeing Sui Huang, Guan Shuqing walked to him and beamed, “Master, you became more good-looking!”

“Haha, well, I was even more handsome when I was young. Many girls in Shang Jing carried a torch for me!”

Sui Huang chuckled as he stroked Guan Shuqing’s head. “Xiao Qing is also a pretty girl. You need to change into Sui Family’s uniform later in the disciple acceptance ceremony tonight. I already got them ready for you. Since there’s nothing much going on now, go and change your clothes now.”

“Yes, Master!”

“Take Xiao Qing in to change her clothes!” Sui Huang instructed a servant in the house.

“Yes, Old Master!” The old servant nodded and looked at Guan Shuqing, “Miss, please follow me!”

“Okay!”

Guan Shuqing nodded.

“Let’s follow them and check it out!”

The three ladies went to join in the fun, leaving the rest behind.

“Old Sui, your Sui Family is quite impressive!”

Wang Xian sat down at the side bluntly and began to sip his tea.

“Haha, of course. After all, this is the Sacred Clan, which I founded!”

Sui Huang was very proud as he praised himself shamelessly.

Wang Xian quirked his lips and did not answer him.

Ever since they had towed the plane together yesterday, both of them were less awkward, and their relationship was closer than before.

Besides, Sui Huang may have been old, but he acted like a child. Hence, he was someone easy to get along with.

Wang Xian had a rather good impression of Sui Huang.

“I can tell that you have quite a number of good things in this Sacred Mountain. Old Sui, I want to check it out!”

“Haha, sure. I’ll take you around. I’ve been managing this place for a hundred years!”

Sui Huang stood up with pride. He signaled for Wang Xian to go out with him.

“This is the Sui Family’s Sacred Mountain, and it’s not just a name!”

Sui Huang gazed at the surroundings and smiled when they were outside.

“What treasures do you have inside that cave?” asked Wang Xian with a smile.

“Let’s go. You’ll find out when you get there!”

Sui Huang chuckled and brought Wang Xian into a cave in the Sacred Mountain.

They were swamped by the heat as soon as they went in. The temperature inside was at least a hundred degrees.

Any ordinary people would be incinerated the moment they entered. The entire cave was glowing in red.

Wang Xian looked up and spotted two giant Flame Spiritual Beads embedded in the top.

Below it was fuming magma and a few tables for the use of cultivation.

There was a red door deep inside, but he did not know what was behind the door.

“This is our cultivation area. What do you think? Two Spiritual Flame Balls, and one of them is Body Refining Spiritual Flame Ball. Not bad, is it?” Sui Huang said with slight contempt as he had spent quite a lot of effort to obtain these two Spiritual Flame Balls.

“Not bad!”

Wang Xian did not rebuke him this time. The two Spiritual Flame Balls were all Level 10, one level higher than the Spiritual Flame Ball he had gotten the other time.

Never underestimate the difference between levels. It marks a significant difference between Inborn or non-inborn.

“Let’s go. I’ll show you my alchemy room!”

Sui Huang was beaming as he walked inside and opened a door. More than 330 square meters of space popped out in front of them.

In the middle of the room was an alchemy furnace.
