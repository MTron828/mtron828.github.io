3358 2257 breakthrough and treasures

Boom! Boom

Above the Cape of the Sea Revival Wonderland, the Dragon Palace slowly descended into the ocean and stood tall above the Wonderland.

A white light slowly enveloped the dragon palace.

In the sky above the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian and the experts of the Dragon Palace scanned their surroundings with a faint smile on their faces.

Now, the Dragon Palace could be considered to have truly established itself in the heaven-splitting chaotic land.

The energy from the grotto-heaven blessed land entered the Dragon Palace, causing all the disciples of the Dragon Palace to feel that their recovery abilities had improved tremendously.

“All the disciples of the Dragon Palace, raise your abilities for the time being and train hard. After your abilities have improved, explore the surrounding sea areas.”

Wang Xian’s voice entered the ears of every disciple of the Dragon Palace.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

All the members of the Dragon Palace replied immediately.

Currently, there were less than two million disciples in the Dragon Palace. The resources this time were sufficient to allow all the members of the Dragon Palace to step into the combat strength of a universe knight.

“Ao he, you guys take charge of the surroundings. The rest of the leaders of the Dragon Palace have also gone through the upgrade, right? Prime Minister Gui, place all the treasures in the Dragon King Palace and arrange for the upgrade of the disciples.”

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and said with a smile on his face.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The leaders immediately responded.

Wang Xian moved and arrived at the Dragon King Palace.

Soon, a large number of treasures were placed in the middle of the Dragon King Palace. These treasures were all obtained from the corpse-wrapping race and the Lich Kingdom.

In the middle of the palace, there was a huge demonic dragon head.

It was the head of the Lich King. The Lich King had accidentally obtained a dragon head of a demon dragon and transferred it to his head.

There were countless medicinal pills, divine herbs, and divine trees.

The treasures obtained this time were extremely terrifying.

The countless experts of the three great races, the accumulation of their divine kingdoms, and the treasures they had stored were mostly obtained by the Dragon Palace.

One could imagine how huge this number was.

Wang Xian looked at the large number of treasures and muttered.

He hesitated for a moment and decided to upgrade himself first before seeing what treasures were here.

His body moved and immediately transformed into the body of a divine dragon. With a wave of his arm, the Five Elements Millstone appeared at the side.

One by one, the acquired treasures were devoured by the Five Elements Millstone.

“Roar Roar!”

Wang Xian growled and all kinds of pills flew into his mouth.

The moment the pills entered his mouth, they turned into thick dragon qi.

He crouched in the Dragon King Palace below and was improving rapidly.

Crack Crack Crack

The terrifying Dragon Qi started to rise on Wang Xian’s body.

On his dragon scales, the shadows of the Divine Dragons were flickering.

Buzz

Ding! “Congratulations on your upgrade to a Level 3 universe Knight!”

Ding! “Congratulations on your breakthrough to comprehend the Law Form: Towering Dragon Horn!”

Two days later, the system’s voice was heard. Wang Xian’s aura was also elevated to its peak.

Eight dazzling rays of light filled the entire Dragon King Palace.

Wang Xian slowly opened his eyes. He spat out a colorful ball of air and a smile appeared on his face.

“Universe Knight Level 3 realm, combat strength of a universe Knight Level 9.”

Wang Xian smiled. With his current strength, he was not weak in the universe.

“Let’s see if there are any treasures that can increase my strength?”

His gaze swept across the entire Dragon King Palace. Sensing it, he waved his dragon claw and three items flew to his side.

These three treasures emitted a strange energy. They were even more mysterious and powerful than acquired treasures.

One was the silver-white metal from the iron and Steel Union, and the other was a green fruit. However, it didn’t look like a fruit either. The ‘fruit’would make a thumping sound, like a heart.

Apart from these two items, there was also a blood-red cloth.

The cloth contained a terrifying bloodthirsty energy. If the weak got close, they would go crazy.

“These three treasures are each stranger than the last. What are their uses?”

Wang Xian mumbled.

These treasures were not innate spiritual treasures. They were just very special treasures.

Wang Xian did not even know what their uses were.

“Let the Enchantress take a look at this blood-red cloth.”

As he spoke, he immediately transmitted his voice to the Enchantress.

The Enchantress was also the current leader of the charming dragon. Her full name was AO Meimei.

The Enchantress controlled the black spider lilies and the mysterious dark energy.

“Dragon King!”

Very soon, the Enchantress flew over and bowed to Wang Xian.

“Take a look at what treasure this is!”

Wang Xian handed the blood-red cloth to her and said.

“HMM?”

The Enchantress took it and examined it. Her eyes were sparkling.

“Some of them look like the treasures of the Netherworld race.”

The enchantress guessed, “However, I still need to study their exact uses.”

“You can take this first!”

Wang Xian said to her. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The Enchantress nodded her head.

“What’s the use of this silver-white metal?”

Wang Xian’s gaze was fixed on the metal in the crystal box. His eyes were sparkling.

He opened it. The metal did not corrode and did not have any offensive power. Similarly, this metal seemed to have a life of its own as it kept moving.

Wang Xian used his hand to sense it and discovered that he could control it.

Buzz

With a thought, the silvery-white metal transformed into various forms.

Slowly, it transformed into a silvery-white glove. After Wang Xian put it on, he held it tightly and narrowed his eyes slightly.

He discovered a characteristic of this metal.

Isolation.

When he put on this glove with his dragon claw, the energy in the external world seemed to be completely isolated.

It didn’t touch any of the energy in the outside world.

“If it’s only this kind of energy, it would be too useless!”

Wang Xian mumbled to himself. By isolating all the energy in the outside world, it was equivalent to a very powerful treasure used to deal with curses.

However, there were too many restrictions and it wasn’t of much use.

Putting it aside, Wang Xian landed on the green ‘fruit’.

It was a very strange fruit that emitted a surging wood attribute like a living creature.

“Let’s give it a try!”

Wang Xian was looking forward to the treasures related to plants.

With the ancestral tree, wood attribute treasures could be easily detected.

He transformed into his human form and came to the front of the ancestral tree. He took the fruit and placed it on the trunk of the ancestral tree.

Buzz

At this moment, what surprised Wang Xian was that the green ‘fruit’landed directly on the ancestral tree.

Then a message appeared in his mind.
