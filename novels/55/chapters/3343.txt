3344 3343, the three forces besieged

The liches were wreaking havoc in the sky above the heaven opening primal continent. They gathered together and stood above a black cloud.

The leader of the liches was riding on the body of a heaven swallowing centipede. He flew toward the nine-essences pit aggressively.

A white cloth covered the sky and covered more than half of the starry sky. Above the cloth, many experts of the wrapped corpse clan stood there quietly. They were filled with a cold aura.

The leader of the wrapped corpse clan held a pyramid-like acquired supreme treasure in his hand and slightly raised his wrapped head.

In the sky above the iron and steel union, one terrifying battleship after another rose into the sky.

Countless fighter jets whistled in the sky above the heaven opening primal continent, and huge mecha glowed.

In the center, on a starship that was more than 10,000 kilometers long, the leader of the iron and Steel Union and 28 generals of the iron and Steel Union stood there, their eyes filled with coldness.

Behind them were thousands of members of the cursed spirit village, their eyes filled with coldness.

At this moment, the three great races moved at the same time. They had the same goal and the same direction.

The three great races had mobilized all their experts and weapons, so they couldn’t hide at all.

They weren’t going to hide anything either.

The Dragon Palace had completely entered the heaven-opening primeval continent. They couldn’t escape.

“The army of the Lich Kingdom is moving. There are at least a few million experts of the Lich kingdom on the Black Cloud. Are they… going to fight the Dragon Palace?”

“The warships of the iron and steel union are roaring in the starry sky. The iron and steel union is moving. They must be ready to attack!”

“Hiss! The corpse-wrapping race is also moving. The corpse-wrapping race has sent out a large number of experts!”

As one of the top three forces in the heaven opening primal continent, each of their movements would cause the various forces to be shocked.

When the Lich Kingdom moved, there were people who spread their speculations on the AI.

When the Steel Union moved, all the forces’experts were basically certain.

However, when someone revealed that the corpse-wrapping race had also moved, everyone was somewhat dumbfounded.

“What’s going on? The corpse-wrapped race is also involved? This?”

“These… these three races are all going to attack the Dragon Palace? It Can’t be, right? It’s actually… it’s actually so terrifying!”

“Hiss, is this for real? These are the three most powerful forces in the heaven opening desolate continent!”

At this moment, the entire edge of the heaven opening desolate continent was in an uproar. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

They were extremely shocked!

As time passed, the forces at the edge of the heaven opening desolation continent were shocked to find that the three races’destination was the same place.

This caused all the experts to be in an uproar.

The three most powerful forces of the heaven opening desolation continent were attacking the Dragon Palace!

The Dragon Palace was going to be finished!

This was the first thought in everyone’s mind.

The Dragon Palace was going to be finished, 100% finished.

This was one of the top three forces of the heaven opening desolate continent.

The three forces besieged the Dragon Palace together. Even if the Dragon Palace had a heaven-defying defense, the three forces could still completely suppress the Dragon Palace.

On the side of the surrounding Lu Xingkong, all the powerful disciples of the surrounding Lu Xingkong were also paying attention to the landing battle of the Dragon Palace.

When they heard the news from the edge of the heaven splitting chaotic land, their expressions changed drastically.

The Dragon Palace was very powerful, but under the siege of the three forces, the Dragon Palace couldn’t resist at all.

Even if the members of the Dragon Palace came out, they would be destroyed.

In this way, the other side could completely suppress the Dragon Palace forever!

This…

The Dragon Palace was in danger!

This was the opinion of all the experts from the factions surrounding Lu Xingkong.

They did not expect that the Landing Battle of the Dragon Palace would reach such a terrifying stage.

All the factions did not understand the enmity between the wrapped corpse clan and the Dragon Palace.

“Dragon King, the Steel Union has already made a move. The Lich Kingdom has also made a move. However, what we did not expect was that the wrapped corpse clan has also made a move!”

At the same time, Prime Minister Gui, who was in the Dragon Palace, reported the news to Wang Xian immediately. His eyes were sparkling.

“The corpse-binding race has also made a move? It’s not surprising, right? Back then, I killed two universe knight level eight experts of the corpse-binding race!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and said.

Back then, in order to snatch the acquired Supreme Treasure, he had killed two corpse-binding race experts.

Universe Knight level eight members were the best among the corpse-binding race. They were also the ones with the highest status. Two of them had been killed by him. It was normal for the other party to want to take revenge.

“The light race and the nine-candle demon race have sent us news. They want us to escape and return to the Lu Galaxy to give up on the landing battle!”

Prime Minister Gui said with a smile.

“Oh? They are kind enough to remind us. After all, they are the three strongest forces in the heaven opening primal continent. Hehe!”

Wang Xian smiled and his eyes were cold. “Get the sky array and the others to prepare and set up the array. Also, call ao he and the eight-headed demon fiend over.”

“It’s Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Turtle replied immediately.

“Dragon King!”

Very soon, Ao he and the Three Universe Knight Level 9 devouring dragons flew over.

“Ao he, get an lie to take you to the Lich Kingdom’s Lich City and the old nest of the corpse-wrapping race. Leave one person at each place and some subordinates. The eight-headed Devil Fiend, Bring the poisonous horned dragon along. Sneak into the Lich City and the old nest of the corpse-wrapping race first and send a message to the devouring dragon.”

“This time, I want to capture all the members of the Steel Union of the corpse-wrapping race in the Lich Kingdom in one go!”

Wang Xian immediately instructed them, his eyes shining brightly.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao he, eight-limbed demonic fiend and the rest nodded their heads and replied immediately.

“Three races, this time, I will completely annihilate all of you!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with killing intent.

He sent two level nine members of the devouring dragon along with the eight-limbed demonic fiend to the Lich City and the lair of the corpse-wrapping tribe. It was not for them to launch an attack immediately.

Instead, it was for them to wait.

To wait for the order to attack.

This time, the three tribes had come to besiege the Dragon Palace. Wang Xian was confident that he could defeat them completely. However, he was not confident that he could leave all of their experts behind.

The steel union was still fine. They followed the path of technology. Without their own divine kingdom, they could not escape directly.

However, the experts from the Lich Kingdom and the corpse-wrapping race could escape back to their own divine kingdom in an instant and into their nest.

At this moment, it was time for the devouring dragon to make its move.

Even if they managed to escape, they would still be attacked by the devouring dragon.

Especially when the eight-limbed Devil Fiend and the others had figured out the trump cards of the two forces, it would be easier for them to attack from the inside.

He wanted to completely destroy the three forces.

As for whether there was any danger in sending out two universe knight level nine swallowing dragons, there was no danger at all.

Even if the three races had true treasures that could unleash the power of two or three universe knight level nine true treasures, the two swallowing dragons would be able to return to Dragon Palace in an instant.
