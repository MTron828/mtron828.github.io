“A girl from the Dragon Gate defeated Fairy Hua and Yuwen Yue in the god of cooking restaurant!”

“Fairy Hua was humiliated and Yuwen Yue was defeated. The one who made the move was a girl from the Dragon Gate.”

“The pathetic beauty fairy Hua and the heaven’s favorite Yuwen Yue were easily defeated by a girl from the Dragon Gate!”

“Fairy hua and Yuwen Yue claimed that the disciples of the Dragon Gate were trash. In the end, they were severely humiliated by a girl from the Dragon Gate!”

“A girl from the Dragon Gate humiliated Yuwen Yue. Could it be that the Dragon Gate is going to make an enemy out of the Yuwen Clan?”

“The Dragon Gate has brought this upon themselves. First, they made an enemy out of the Holy Medicine Holy Doctor, and now they are provoking the Yuwen clan!”

On the first day of the grand competition, while the jianghu was still discussing the matter of the Dragon Gate making an enemy out of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect, another explosive news suddenly appeared on the Internet.

On the Jianghu Internet, not only were there posts, there were also several pictures of fairy hua and Yuwen Yue in a sorry state.

Especially Fairy Hua, her face was covered in blood and she was lying on the ground, not having the grace of a fairy at all.

Looking at the pictures and the posts, everyone had shocked expressions on their faces.

This Fairy Hua was too miserable and Yuwen Yue was also in a sorry state.

However, seeing the miserable state of the two, many people were shocked.

A girl from the Dragon Gate could easily defeat fairy hua and Yuwen Yue?

Fairy Hua was in the infant realm and might not be very strong among the infant realm, but Yuwen Yue was a heaven’s favorite who entered the finals today.

And with his strength, he was basically on the 21st Heaven’s favorite list.

In the end, he was actually defeated by an unknown girl from the Dragon Gate. Moreover, she didn’t even have the strength to resist. This caused everyone to be extremely shocked.

“This face-smacking is too miserable. In the God of cooking restaurant, they said that the Dragon Gate was inferior to them. Yuwen Yue even said that she alone could crush all the young disciples of the Dragon Gate. In the end, she was instantly smacked in the face. Fairy Hua was in a sorry State!”

“Yuwen Yue was smacked in the face like this. Will the Yuwen clan react? Will they become enemies with the Dragon Gate?”

“That girl is the sister of the Dragon King. Her strength is very terrifying. She is at least at the half-step immortal God level!”

Following that, three replies that were more popular were pushed up.

The miserable fairy hua and Yuwen Yue!

Will the Yuwen clan stand up for Yuwen Yue!

The younger sister of the Dragon King!

This incident made the Heaven’s pride competition even more interesting.

And the battle tomorrow was even more exciting.

“Brother, that pair of B * stards Yuwen Yue and Fairy Hua are really annoying!”

On the guest reception peak of the Xuanyuan clan, Wang Xian and Xiao Yu were sitting in front of a table. Xiao Yu said to him angrily.

“Yu Wenyue?”

Wang Xian smiled. “If they don’t offend me, we won’t offend them. If they offend us, don’t hold back!”

“They still dare to spout such arrogant words. I alone can teach them a lesson. If the people from the Yu Wen clan dare to cause trouble, I will teach them a good lesson in the Heaven’s Pride Competition Tomorrow!”

Xiao Yu pouted and said unhappily.

“There’s no need for you to do anything. The Golden Swordfish clan will be here tomorrow. Let’s eat. All of you can enjoy yourselves here!”

Wang Xian smiled. He wasn’t too concerned about the matter with Yuwen Yue.

Night fell very quickly. The jianghu internet was still bustling with activity as they discussed what happened today.

When the bell rang the next day, one by one, the immortal sects flew towards the arena.

Wang Xian, Guan Shuqing, and the rest of the members of the Dragon Gate also flew towards the spectator stand.

When they arrived, they instantly felt the gazes of the crowd.

The group of immortal sect disciples stared at the members of the Dragon Gate with curiosity as they swept their gaze over Xiao Yu.

The fact that Xiao Yu defeated Yu Wenyue yesterday shocked many people.

Many people guessed that the person who went up to the arena to duel with the Holy Medicine Holy Doctor Immortal sect was most likely the girl from yesterday.

Because it seemed that only that girl in the Dragon Gate had the strength to do so.

“Brother, it’s that girl, it’s her!”

At this moment, in front of the Yuwen clan’s platform, Yuwen Yue’s face was filled with anger as she looked at Little Yu in the distance. She gritted her teeth and said.

“You can’t even defeat a girl. You were forced to use up the defensive array that Father spent a lot of money to build for us. You’re really embarrassing!”

Beside Yuwen Yue, a thin youth coldly glanced at his younger brother.

“She... she’s very strong... i. . .”

Yuwen Yue lowered her head with an embarrassed expression, her clenched fists filled with fury!

“Alright, since she dared to hurt you, I’ll naturally teach her a good lesson. Don’t say that you’re my younger brother, but if you dare not give face to my Yuwen clan, I’ll let everyone know the consequences!”

As the thin and weak youth spoke, a trace of coldness flashed in his eyes.

Their words were not concealed at all, and the few immortal gods from the Yuwen clan heard them.

Especially a middle-aged immortal god. He glanced at them indifferently and did not say anything, with a smile on his face.

Regarding the fact that the second most outstanding disciple of the immortal sect was defeated by the girl from the Dragon Gate last night, they were not the least bit affected.

They would not order their disciples to make a move, nor would they stop them from doing so.

Everything would be settled by the disciples of the immortal sect themselves.

However, they were very supportive of the disciples of the immortal sect taking revenge.

As the top existence of the twenty immortal sects, the disciples of the immortal sect should have been able to get back at them for humiliating them. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

No matter who the other party was, this was the dominance of their Yuwen clan.

The Holy Medicine Immortal sect was not afraid of the Dragon Gate, and they were even more fearless!

One by one, the immortal sects arrived, and the twenty-two platforms filled with itinerant cultivators.

The Immortal Gods of the Holy Medicine Immortal sect and the sect masters of the two immortal sects slowly stood up and looked coldly in the direction of the Dragon Gate.

“Holy Medicine Immortal sect, Disciples of the Holy Medicine Immortal sect, step forward!”

“It’s the sect master!”

In an instant, ten youths of the Holy Medicine Immortal sect stood in front.

Hua Gujiang was in the center.

The ten elite disciples of the two great immortal sects had the lowest strength of the infant realm. They raised their heads and looked in the direction of the Dragon Gate. Their eyes were filled with provocation and fighting spirit.

“Disciples of the Dragon Gate, come out and fight. Today, Our Holy Medicine Immortal sect will kill all the elite disciples of Your Dragon Gate. Come out and die!”

Hua Gujiang waved his arm and a two-meter-long dark green staff appeared in his hand. He pointed it directly in the direction of the Dragon Gate. It was extremely domineering!

“Two Minutes!”

Ao Jian sat beside Wang Xian. He looked into the distance and said faintly.

“Then, before that, let me do it first!”

Just as Wang Xian finished his words, a thin voice flew down from the Yuwen clan’s platform.

He landed on the stage in the middle. The ground was slightly distorted under the control of the Earth elemental energy.

He turned his head and stared at Xiao Yu coldly. There was no expression on his face.

“How dare you insult my younger brother? You Don’t put the Yuwen clan in your eyes. Come Down. I want you to kneel down and apologize. Otherwise, you will die!”
