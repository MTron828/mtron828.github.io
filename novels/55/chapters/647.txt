Chapter 648: Kraken

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The Dragon Palace was still too weak.

Currently, only Roving Sword and he possessed supreme-class combat capacity, and there were a dozen or more Budding Realm experts.

As the Dragon King of Dragon Palace, it was not possible for him to suppress the entire sea region. Hence, he would need Roving Sword and the rest.

However, he alone was completely useless if they encountered a situation similar to Manta Ray King.

There must be two Level 13 Dragon Palace members here to suppress this place. On top of that, it was best to have an Immortal-class expert in suppressing this place too.

Hence, the best-case scenario was to have two Immortal-class members from Dragon Palace.

With high-end combat capacity, Dragon Palace could better develop themselves.

In order to establish the order in the sea, the prerequisite was to have a strong military force to suppress it.

During the battle with the Manta Ray King, it had high intelligence and knew when to retreat. Knowing that it could not beat them, the Manta Ray King ran away.

If there were more compelling members in Dragon Palace, they could totally take down the Manta Ray King.

Even though they could not kill it, they could at least stun it and eventually rein it in.

Even if Manta Ray King did not surrender and wanted to continue to stay there, it must be bound by the Dragon Palace.

Immortal-class Manta Ray King’s intelligence was very high, but its subordinates were otherwise.

Dragon Palace could order their subordinates to go through the Dragon Gate test. If they passed the test, they would become the members of Dragon Palace.

With talents and the boost in cultivation, Dragon Palace would slowly turn stronger!

Fueling their combat capacity with warfare would enhance the speed of their cultivation too.

If they had sufficient Immortal-class experts in Dragon Palace, they could easily kill those Immortal-class creatures who failed to surrender. They could suppress one place and establish an invincible force centered around Dragon Palace, or even underwater civilization.

Let’s hope we can comb through the resources from this disordered region to groom two Immortal-class members of the Dragon Palace. If that’s the case, the territory of the Dragon Palace will expand to a thousand kilometers!

Wang Xian pondered to himself. He surveyed the surroundings. On his left and right, a few hundred Dragon Palace members and dragonians were scattered around a few kilometers away from him, combing the entire disordered region for treasures inch by inch. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Looking ahead, he could see mountains standing under the sea in darkness.

“There’s a pure Blood Coral over there!”

Dragon Spirit dwarf stared at the middle of the mountain with excitement in his eyes.

They had dived to the bottom of the sea. In the past, the Wandering Groups could only dive no more than a hundred meters deep.

Diving a thousand meters in a big group was not what Budding Realm experts would dare to do as the Manta Ray in this water region were extremely scary.

Failing to seek it out, Wang Xian and Roving Sword could only survey the surroundings with vigilance to prevent Manta Ray King from sneaking an attack.

“There are too many pure Blood Corals in this entire region. Besides, the pure Blood Corals will still grow if we cannot clear their roots completely!”

“The Manta Rays devour pure Blood Corals to gain their strength while the pure Blood Corals devour the Manta Rays and the other marine creatures to enhance their own strength. This is a perfect cycle. As long as there are marine creatures in this water, the pure Blood Coral will not go extinct!”

“Pure Blood Corals can give off a special scent to attract the marine creatures, feed on them, and grow. Even without Manta Rays in the disordered region, there is a large number of fishes around!”

Mo Qinglong, Dragon Kid, and Dragon Spirit were exchanging conversations.

“I guess the Devil Sealing Immortal Sect disciples also spotted this natural treasure ground. Thus, they wanted to take over this place!”

Wang Xian pondered as he listened to them.

The members of Dragon Palace and the dragonians discovered pure Blood Corals and Devil Cloud Bead Spiritual Grass from time to time.

Their advancing speed was fast. Even when there were occasional appearances of Manta Rays, Roving Sword took care of them easily.

As long as the Manta Ray King was not here, this place would not pose the slightest danger to them.

The entire disordered region spanned over a thousand miles, and it would take at least half a month to comb through the area thoroughly.

But they had all the time.

After reporting the situation to Xiao Yu, Lan Qingyue, and the rest, Wang Xian stayed put in the disordered region.

His space rings were filled with priceless pure Blood Corals and Devil Cloud Beads.

“Let’s pluck those low-level Devil Cloud Beads and plant them in the Dragon Palace!” said Wang Xian to the members of the Dragon Palace and dragonians.

He was going to open up space for a medicine garden to grow all kinds of Spiritual Grass.

“Hur? Dragon King, there’s something odd ahead!”

At this time, the Dragon Spirit sounded quizzical. He fixed his eyes ahead with vigilance.

“Hur?”

Wang Xian looked ahead when he heard the Dragon Spirit.

The Dragon Spirit was that old dwarf who was not even a meter tall. However, he possessed alertness that dragonians did not have.

They had combed through more than half of the disordered region for six days when they came across the region with mountains lined up ahead. Dozens of mountains were closely packed together thousands of meters away.

Wang Xian furrowed his brows with a puzzled look.

“What’s strange about it?” asked Wang Xian, looking at Dragon Spirit.

“I don’t know either. When I was chased by the Creepy Snake Group from Japan, I always had the same feeling. We are good at hiding, assassinating, deception... This place gave me a similar vibe!”

The small-built Dragon Spirit was looking around with all his wrinkled skin squeezing together. This made him looked scary.

Clang-clang!

Roving Sword took out his sword and put it in front of him, giving off the clanging sound of metal.

A hint of doubt flashed on Wang Xian’s face. His body slowly circled around.

Boom!

“Great Waterfall Water Shockwave!”

The blue energy instantly covered an area with a radius of ten kilometers, and the whole entire region was within the coverage.

“Hur, quite a good hidden means... Is this the Kraken that you were talking about?”

Wang Xian looked to Roving Sword with surprise.

“Yes, Dragon King. This must be the Kraken we encountered before. It’s quite creepy, not very strong, but it can easily avoid my tracking!”

Roving Sword nodded as he looked at the surroundings.

Boom!

The water within a radius of ten kilometers vibrated immediately when Wang Xian swung his dragon claws.

Whoosh!

At this time, figures sharing similar colors with the sea seemed to have wriggled out from two dimensional space, striking at Wang Xian.

“What a great way to hide! They are actually just a hundred meters in front of us!”

Wang Xian was taken aback as he watched a claw that was as sharp as daggers coming at him.

The claw fell on the dragon head without leaving any trace.

Wang Xian jerked backward, and a blue glow appeared ahead instantly.

A Kraken of 1.5 meters, with two sharp claws that were bigger than its body, appeared before him.

But to his surprise, the Kraken showed up under the blue light for one second, and then vanished once again!
