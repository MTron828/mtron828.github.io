“Coo Coo Coo Coo Coo!”

The sound of the Thunder Fish was heard. On the other side, six heavily injured thunder fish leaped up and flew up the mountain.

“Pu!”

However, it was not that easy to shake off Ao Yao.

Ao Yao’s black and white figure flashed and arrived on top of a thunder fish’s head. His claws went straight into its head.

“Boom!”

A violent explosion occurred on its head. The body of the thunderfish was instantly put into the Ao Yao’s interspatial ring.

“Coo-coo, coo-coo!”

Seeing another thunderfish die, the leader of the Thunderfish let out an angry roar.

The remaining six thunderfish were all gathered on the peak of the mountain, surrounding the ten-meter-wide area that was emitting a blue-green light.

The injuries on their bodies were slowly recovering under the glow.

Ao Yao came to Wang Xian’s side in an instant with a solemn expression.

“Dragon King, I’ll kill them. Take the treasure on the top of the mountain!”

Ao Yao clearly realized that the treasure on the top of the mountain was extraordinary.

It was definitely not simple for it to be able to heal the injuries on its body quickly and was valued by the thunderfish.

“Alright, be careful!”

Wang Xian looked at Ao Yao and nodded.

Ao Yao had some injuries on his body, but it was not a big deal!

“Kill!”

Ao Yao growled in a low voice. His body moved and instantly attacked the six thunderfish.

When the group of Thunderfish saw Ao Yao disappear into the air, their faces were filled with fear.

“Roar!”

The leader of the Thunderfish let out a furious roar. He opened his huge mouth and his five to six meter long fish whiskers stood up.

“Crackle!”

The other five thunderfish also raised their heads like the leader of the thunderfish, and their fish whiskers stood up.

The thundersnakes covered an area of a thousand meters, and there was no gap at all.

Ao Yao’s figure was instantly forced out.

The light and darkness on his body slowly intertwined together, blocking the surrounding thundersnakes. His speed did not decrease as he attacked the six thunderfish.

“COO COO, Coo Coo!”

The six lightning fishes flapped their huge wings and attacked ao Yao with lightning wings.

“The lightning fishes standing around the mountain peak have become stronger!”

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly. After hesitating for a moment, he arrived at the foot of the mountain peak.

“Wrath of the Earth!”

Wang Xian transformed into the Earth Dragon God. The rich Earth attribute energy was boiling in his body as he unleashed the Earth attribute divine ability for the first time.

Wrath of the Earth!

Rumble

At the top of the mountain peak, the diameter of the mountain peak was about 200 meters.

The mountain peak that was struck by lightning all year round was extremely sturdy.

However, Wang Xian’s strength was not to be trifled with.

The huge Earth attribute divine ability landed directly on the mountain peak.

The entire mountain peak started to tremble violently as huge rocks started to fall downwards.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Wang Xian swung his huge tail and swung it towards the top of the mountain peak.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Streaks of tears appeared on the mountain peak as even larger rocks began to roll downwards.

At this moment, at the bottom of the mountain peak, the thunderfish on the mountain peak could clearly sense the terrifying battle coming from the top of the mountain despite the cover of the dark clouds.

Now, more than ten-meter-sized rocks were rolling downwards, causing the thunderfish to show terrified expressions.

They hurriedly ran towards the bottom of the mountain peak, afraid that they would be attacked by those huge rocks.

The entire main peak of the Thunder Island was in chaos.

Boom! Boom! Boom

“It’s cracked!”

When Wang Xian struck for dozens of times consecutively, an excited expression appeared on his face.

“Crash!”

In an instant, the rocks 300 meters below the mountain peak started to collapse and fell downwards.

When the group of thunderfish realized that the mountain peak had collapsed, their faces revealed a furious expression.

Wang Xian moved his body and looked towards the area on the mountain peak that was emitting a blue-green light.

The mountain peak was slowly falling downwards. His gaze was fixed on it.

“Coo Coo Coo Coo!”

When the leader of the thunderfish saw this situation, his eyes slowly turned blood red. He roared as the Lightning in the bluish-green area seemed to be pulled.

“Boom!”

Bolts of lightning struck towards Ao Yao.

Ao Yao’s expression changed slightly as he hurriedly dodged.

“Roar!”

The peak of the mountain began to collapse downwards. The bluish-green area also fell downwards.

Wang Xian’s face was filled with joy.

However, all of a sudden, he saw five pairs of eyes staring at him.

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The faces of the five thunderfish were filled with fury. The terrifying lightning struck directly at him. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Not good!”

Wang Xian’s expression changed drastically. He hurriedly went into defense.

However, this time, it was a full-force strike from the five extraordinary level eight thunderfish. Bolts of lightning struck on his defense.

In just a second, the lightning penetrated through Wang Xian’s defense and landed on his body.

“Ah!”

Wang Xian instantly felt as if his body was being torn apart. His face was filled with malevolence.

“You’re courting death!”

At this moment, ao Yao’s figure blocked in front of Wang Xian. She immediately restrained the group of thunderfish.

Wang Xian felt as if his body was about to shatter.

The attacks of the five thunderfish caused him to be severely injured in an instant.

This time, his injuries were very serious.

“What is this thing?”

Wang Xian’s gaze suddenly caught sight of the blue-green area hanging on the mountain peak beside him.

In the middle of the area, a blue-green wooden stick was inserted into the mountain peak.

Under his gaze, the blue-green light disappeared at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Wang Xian endured the pain on his body. With a move of his dragon claws, he clawed at the wooden stick.

The blue-green wooden stick was about 1.5 meters long. The light was completely restrained and it looked like an ordinary tree.

“COO COO, Coo Coo!”

“Roar!”

When they saw Wang Xian snatching away their treasures, they instantly went into a frenzy.

They didn’t even bother with the Ao Yao’s attack. Endless Thunderbolts struck at Wang Xian.

“Oh no!”

Wang Xian’s expression changed drastically. He quickly moved towards the mountain peak.

Boom! Boom! Boom

A large amount of lightning bolts landed on his body. He could not help but spit out a large mouthful of fresh blood as his body fell downwards.

Ding! “Lightning strike wood detected!”

At this moment, the system’s voice suddenly rang out.

Wang Xian was slightly stunned. His body moved and he quickly transformed into his human form.

The lightning struck wood in his hand emitted a faint glow. A terrifying life force entered his body and repaired his broken body.

However, compared to the almost fatal injury in Wang Xian’s body, this life force could not allow him to recover immediately.

He could not even sustain the strength to fly.

His body fell heavily towards the bottom of the mountain peak.

At this moment, the commotion caused by the main peak of the Lightning Island had attracted the attention of the mercenary groups from the Demon Hunters Academy.

They didn’t see the battle on the main peak of Thunder Island, but the sound of the mountain peak rolling down did reverberate throughout Thunder Island.

Some people hesitated for a moment before rushing over to the main peak.

As the strongest amethyst mercenary group on Thunder Island, they hesitated for a moment before rushing over!
