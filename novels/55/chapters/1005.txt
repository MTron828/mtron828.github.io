Chapter 1006: 1007 was convinced

Translator: 5496903

“Eight to one!”

After driving for an hour, Zhang Fengying waved the long whip in her hand and killed the anaconda. She looked at Wang Xian with a hint of contempt in her eyes.

She had a tall and slender figure to begin with. Now that she raised her head, she looked even more impressive!

“Sister Zhang’s alertness is one of the best in the entire Donghai City!”

“That’s right. There aren’t many people in the entire Donghai city who possess ocular skills. Sister Zhang is the best!”

“That’s right, that’s right!”

After walking for an hour, all the dangers were easily resolved by Zhang Fengying. Behind them, the amethyst mercenary group and the Void Beast mercenary group also revealed relaxed expressions. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

All of them said flatteringly.

“Alright, stop flattering us. Just now, we were only at the outer perimeter. There were some extraordinary level five jinlin boas. Next, we will be approaching the central area of the wind chime forest. We might encounter the windwing Savage Fish!”

Zhang Fengying waved her hand indifferently and looked at Wang Xian. “Little guy, there are still many things that you need to learn!”

Wang Xian and Zhang Fengying looked a little smug and felt amused. “Awesome, Awesome! You’re still the best, Big Sister!”

“Are you convinced now? You’re not allowed to wear those big words. In the future, when you see me, be good and call me big sister. Call Me Big Sister!”

Zhang Fengying looked at Wang Xian with her chin and said happily.

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth twitched. “I think it’s better to call you big sister!”

“Just call me whatever I tell you to call me. In the future, don’t be arrogant and don’t be arrogant in front of me. Be Humble and be defeated!”

Zhang Fengying looked at her and said with a smile on her face.

“Let’s continue!”

Wang Xian said to her helplessly.

“Captain Wang, if you want to compete with sister Zhang in Scouting, you have lost!”

“That’s right. Sister Zhang’s eye technique is too powerful and she has a lot of experience!”

The two young men behind whispered.

“When we reach the central area, there might be a group of Jinlin boa. Everyone, be careful!”

After walking for more than ten kilometers, elder Zeng jumped down from a tree and reminded everyone.

“A cave has appeared. We have to be prepared to fight at any time!”

Zhang Fengying looked at the underground cave in the distance and reminded loudly.

Entering the cave meant that they had truly entered the territory of the wind-winged savage fish. Around these underwater caves, there might be more than a dozen caracal boas or wind-winged savage fish that would suddenly appear.

Once they entered the center, Wang Xian became vigilant. In his vision, there was a cave entrance that was about two to three meters wide every 100 meters in front of them.

Beneath these caves were numerous tunnels that were densely packed together.

They were considered to have gone smoothly in the periphery of the wind chime forest. However, the central area was the real beginning.

“Take out the induction stone plate!”

Old Zeng said to a young man.

The induction stone plate could sense the concentration of spiritual energy. The sensing range was 100 meters.

The Cave of the wind-winged savage fish was complicated, but the depth was less than 100 meters.

Using this induction stone plate, if one discovered a spot where the spiritual stones were suddenly higher, it meant that it might be the true cave of the wind-winged savage fish. There might be treasures inside.

Wang Xian took a look. To him, this induction stone plate was of no use.

With his current strength, he could penetrate 500 to 600 meters of land when he looked underground.

After walking for about half an hour, Zhang Fengying took care of the two golden scaled boas that were hiding around.

The golden scaled boas here had reached transcendent level 6.

“Take the induction plate and go to the cave!”

Zhang Fengying looked at the surrounding caves and walked over to check them. She pointed at the first cave that she checked.

“Alright, Sister Fengying!”

The girl nodded her head and immediately ran over with the induction plate.

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and looked at the bottom of the cave.

“Huh?”

Suddenly, Wang Xian was slightly taken aback.

“Wait!”

He quickly said to the girl who was walking over.

“Captain Wang, What’s Wrong?”

The girl looked at him curiously.

“What’s Wrong?”

Zhang Fengying also looked at Wang Xian and asked curiously.

“There’s a wind-winged savage fish down there!”

Wang Xian pointed to a spot beside the cave and said.

It was a demonic beast with a pair of wings. Its head and body were similar to that of a shark. It had a thick layer of skin and a fish tail.

Just now, Wang Xian took a look at his surroundings. There were no wind-winged savage fish there. Instead, they had just swam over from below. It was as though they were waiting for their arrival.

Wang Xian pointed there and said. His gaze swept across his surroundings. More than a thousand meters ahead, another wind-wing Savage Fish’s head was revealed from the entrance of the cave. His gaze was cold as he looked over.

“Why are there wind-wing savage fish? I have just checked over there. Little Guy, are your eyes playing tricks on You?”

Zhang Fengying looked at Wang Xian. However, she walked towards the cave that he was pointing at.

Her green eyes looked into the cave and tried to sense it again.

“It’s confirmed that it’s safe. Little one, you’re still not up to it!”

Zhang Fengying smiled and looked at Wang Xian mockingly.

Wang Xian did not look at her. Instead, he looked at the area below.

He realized that when Zhang Fengying walked over, the wind-winged savage fish could sense her approaching and moved three to four meters into the cave.

“The wind-winged savage fish is a wind attribute demonic beast. They can sense whether or not they are approaching through the flow of water!”

Wang Xian thought to himself.

“Come over!”

Zhang Fengying waved at the girl. The girl immediately walked over.

“Leader Wang, don’t worry about my aunt’s investigative methods!”

Zhang Yitian thought that Wang Xian was unwilling to give up and said to him with a smile.

“Don’t worry, Captain Wang. I still have faith in Sister Fengying!”

The girl smiled at him and walked to the entrance of the cave.

Zhang Fengying continued to look at the cave in front of her.

At this moment, the wind-winged savage fish slowly approached from the bottom of the cave.

“Bang!”

When Wang Xian saw this scene, the lightning wood in his hand gently landed on the ground.

Boom

At this moment, a one-meter-sized fish head suddenly emerged from the hole and attacked the girl.

The girl held the communication stone plate in both hands. When she saw the wind-winged savage fish that had suddenly attacked her, her face revealed a look of horror.

The loud sound caused the expressions of everyone around to change drastically.

Zhang Fengying turned her head and her face instantly turned ugly. The long whip in her hand wanted to rescue her.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

However, at this moment, thorns emerged from the ground beside them and penetrated the wind-winged savage fish instantly.

Wang Xian pulled his arm gently and pulled the three-meter-long wind-winged savage fish out.

“This...”

Everyone was stunned when they saw that Wang Xian was killed by the wind-winged savage fish before its head even reached half a meter out.

“Thank you!”

The girl thanked Wang Xian in a state of shock.

If it wasn’t for Wang Xian, she would have died for sure!
