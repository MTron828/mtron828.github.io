3361 2260 muscular-headed snake

The Horn of the sea was the name of the region where the Dragon Palace was located.

It extended all the way to the Horn of the sea and headed straight ahead. It was the real mountain and sea sea.

Wang Xian didn’t know much about this sea, nor had he ventured deep into it.

However, Wang Xian began his voyage today!

“Dad, I’m hungry. I want to eat seafood.”

In the depths of the ocean, a figure was rapidly spreading his legend.

On his head, a little girl the size of a fist was flapping her wings and making a sweet sound.

“Alright, Alright. I’ll give you seafood!”

This big and small figure was naturally Wang Xian. He took out a piece of meat and handed it to the little girl.

“Hehe!”

The little girl immediately hugged him and opened her mouth to eat.

The little girl, Wang Lingling, was born from the ancestral tree in Wang Xian’s body. She grew up by absorbing Wang Xian’s blood. She could not be too far away from him.

Similarly, the little girl’s strength was closely related to Wang Xian.

| The advantage of a half-life elf was that she had a powerful assistant. The bad thing was that she needed to feed her with her own energy constantly. This would cause her to require more energy for her own cultivation.

However, feeding a little girl was nothing to Wang Xian.

“I might need one to two years to travel through the ocean this time!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian mumbled as he watched her eat and looked at the map.

He had already left for three days. After bidding farewell to the girls and giving instructions to the Dragon Palace, he entered the vast ocean.

The Cape of the ocean was considered a relatively deep place at the edge of the continent. However, there was still a considerable distance to go.

If he were to fly, with Wang Xian’s current speed, it would take him one to two years.

Wang Xian’s speed was not slow at all. It was comparable to the peak of a universe knight.

The little girl who had satisfied her craving sat on top of Wang Xian’s head. She extended her little finger and pointed ahead.

Wang Xian smiled and disappeared in an instant.

With the little girl, it was not boring to travel.

There were many powerful desolate beasts in this ocean where desolate beasts lived.

He had encountered desolate beasts at the level of a universe knight, or even desolate beasts at the peak of the universe knight level, Wang Xian.

With his speed and strength, he could easily kill level nine desolate beasts.

However, for those at the peak level, he could only run away.

Wang Xian’s target this time was the lightning race. The distance between the Lightning race and the Dragon Palace was not close. If he flew in a straight line, it might take him more than ten years.

Fortunately, as long as he reached the interior of the mainland, there would be a large number of teleportation arrays that could be used to rush over.

Currently, Wang Xian had the realm of a Level 3 universe knight. He could directly rule over the aquatic desolate beasts below level 3.

After traveling in the ocean for half a year, he managed to rule over tens of thousands of level one and level two universe knights. This brought a considerable amount of resources to the Dragon Palace.

Boom! Boom! Boom

After traveling in the ocean for a year, a series of rumbling sounds came from above.

Wang Lingling, who was sleeping on top of Wang Xian’s head, opened her eyes and looked up.

“Eh, did I bump into someone?”

At this moment, Wang Xian was pleasantly surprised. He narrowed his eyes slightly.

On the surface of the sea, numerous ships that were emitting powerful energy were located in front of a deserted island on the sea.

On that deserted island, there was a desolate beast with more than ten heads that looked like a giant snake.

It raised its head and its body was more than 100,000 meters in size. Streams of dark green venom were sprayed out in the surroundings.

There was no lack of experts on Wang Xian’s dozens of ships. When the two sides fought, a terrifying explosion was heard.

“Dad, there are people fighting!”

Wang Lingling said in surprise.

“Let’s go and take a look!”

Wang Xian’s body moved and flew up.

Splash

After he revealed the surface of the sea, his dragon eyes scanned the location of the battle.

There were more than 1,000 humans on the dozens of ships. The strongest one had the combat strength of a Level 9 universe knight, and the weakest one had the strength of a Level 3 universe knight.

The desolate beast they were attacking had the combat strength of a Level 9 universe knight.

“Quick, quick, be careful of the venom of the muscle-headed snake. The weaker ones should retreat and get out of its attack range.”

“Attack one of its heads with all your strength and kill one First!”

A loud shout came from the front. One ship after another set up a defensive barrier and quickly retreated backward.

“This muscular-headed snake is very powerful. Even when three universe knights and level nine masters attacked it, they couldn’t suppress it. It must have a powerful bloodline.”

Wang Xian looked over, and his eyes were shining.

However, this also allowed him to see the strong masters within the heaven-opening primal continent.

Before he could reach there, he encountered three universe knight level nine great beings.

Hualala

At this time, in front of him, the muscular-headed snake suddenly raised seven or eight heads, and behind it, endless waves surged.

The waves rose into the sky and slowly turned dark green, rushing toward him.

In the sky, dark green rain started to fall.

Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle

The dark green rain fell on the surface of the sea and emitted a terrifying sound of corrosion. Even the seawater was corroded by it.

The Tai Chi Dragon Plate on Wang Xian’s body flashed and easily blocked the dark green rain.

“Be careful. All ships, spread out and retreat further away. This muscle-headed snake is much stronger than we imagined!”

An old man shouted loudly in front of them.

“Pen and ink judge the Heaven and Earth!”

At the side, a middle-aged man who looked like a scholar was holding a black brush. He was writing a golden ‘kill’character in the air.

The ‘kill’character attacked the muscular-headed snake directly.

“Eh? This attack is a little special!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly when he saw this attack.

“Retreat quickly!”

At this moment, a ship was retreating towards Wang Xian’s direction.

Wang Xian looked over but didn’t avoid it. He remained standing on the surface of the water.

“Eh? Is there someone here?”

On the ship, a middle-aged man noticed Wang Xian on the surface of the water and was astonished.

“Brother in front, we are from Haotian City.”

The middle-aged man immediately introduced himself and scanned the surroundings to see if there were any of Wang Xian’s companions around.

“I was passing by and saw that there was a battle here. I came here to take a look. I didn’t mean to offend you.”

When Wang Xian saw the middle-aged man introducing himself, he immediately replied.

“Huala!”

“Huh?”

At this moment, Wang Xian saw an extremely huge tail sweeping across the ocean in front of him.

The tail should be condensed from water-elemental laws, but it contained a terrifying power.

“There’s an attack at the bottom of the sea. Abandon the ship and escape to the sky.”

On the ship in front, an old man shouted sternly.

Buzz

When Wang Xian saw this scene, he hesitated for a moment before he slowly extended his palm. A dragon claw condensed from the water attribute attacked the tail.

Boom

A dull and loud collision sound came from the bottom of the sea. The surface of the sea rolled.

However, the tail was directly crushed under the attack of Wang Xian!
