“This... how is this possible... This is impossible...”

The time that Wang Xian and Mu Yuan fought was very short. It was less than two seconds.

Just when everyone was stunned by the sudden outbreak of the battle, Mu Yuan was already dead.

He widened his eyes and looked at his chest in disbelief.

How could this be? He had used two divine abilities to fight against the opponent’s one divine ability. How could he not win?

“TSK tsk, with such strength, you still dare to come forward and throw your life away?”

Wang Xian shook his head in disdain.

“What!”

“What!”

“What!”

At this moment, it was as though the entire space had quieted down. Everyone widened their eyes and stared in disbelief at Mu Yuan who was slowly falling to the ground!

“He... he died just like that?”

Tang Yuan and Tang Ling ‘er’s bodies trembled as they muttered.

He died just like that!

This was too fast!

Instant Kill!

“Hiss!”

Around them, orderly gasps of cold air could be heard. They stared blankly at Wang Xian who was wearing a mask and a black robe. They were extremely shocked.

Just now, even Ren Xingchen was unable to defeat Mu Chen within five to six moves. He could only suppress him.

However, the nameless genius only used one move!

This...

“The nameless genius is stronger than Ren Xingchen. Otherwise, Ren Xingchen wouldn’t have said that Mu Yuan doesn’t have the qualifications to compete with him!”

A young man thought of what Ren Xingchen had just said and took a deep breath as he said in a daze.

The people beside him nodded in agreement.

“No... His strength!”

Han Mingshan, who was fighting Ling Jian ‘er, glanced past Mu Yuan, who was instantly killed, and his eyes widened.

“Peng Peng Peng!”

Just as he was in a daze, a resplendent sword ray landed on his chest.

His expression changed slightly, and blue light blossomed on his body. The area on his chest directly condensed into a terrifying whirlpool.

The armor on his body was immediately activated.

However, when this resplendent sword ray landed on his body, a terrifying collision sound was heard.

Han Mingshan’s expression changed drastically as he stared at Ling Jian ‘er, “How can your sword ray be so terrifying!”

He knew that his strength was not weaker than Ling Jian ‘er, but now he realized that he was wrong.

“Ahhhh!”

Around him, screams could be heard as his face turned red.

“Run!”

A roar came out from his throat. A pair of water wings appeared directly behind him.

His entire body was like a swift and violent stream of water as he fled into the distance.

Ling Jian ‘er looked at him fleeing and frowned slightly. She did not give chase.

The other elite disciples of the Hanhai Empire who were being massacred by Ren Xingchen also fled into the distance hurriedly.

Seeing that Ling Jian ‘er did not chase after them, Wang Xian did not make a move either.

“Awoo!”

Xiao Ha looked at Wang Xian excitedly. His body moved and he pounced towards him directly.

“Eh?”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned when he saw Xiao Ha pouncing towards him. “The quality of this dog’s meat is not bad. It should be very delicious!”

“Hmph, Xiao Ha, come over here!”

Ling Jian ‘er shouted as she walked towards Wang Xian when she heard that Wang Xian was trying to cover up.

Ren Xingchen also walked towards Wang Xian with burning eyes.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian glanced at them and threw Xiao Ha to Ling Jian ‘er. He then turned around and walked towards the Heaven’s pride stage.

He looked at the tens of thousands of people around him and a faint smile appeared on his face.

“Heaven’s pride experts who are ranked ahead of me, please return to the Heaven’s pride stage. I want to break through the Heaven’s pride ranking. Don’t waste my time!”

The light words came from his mouth, causing all the young men to be stunned.

Wang Xian ignored them and flew towards the Heaven’s pride stage.

Ren Xingchen didn’t hesitate and chased after him directly.

Ling Jian ‘ER’s eyes flickered as she looked at his figure. She also chased after him directly.

“Break through the Heaven’s pride ranking? How strong is this Nameless Heaven’s pride expert!”

“He killed Mu Yuan in a single move. This nameless prodigy should have the strength to break through the prodigy roll!”

“Originally, it was the people from the boundless sea empire who were attacking Ling Jian ‘ER. Now, they are fleeing in fear. That nameless prodigy is too terrifying!”

Tens of thousands of gazes stared at the three figures as they gasped in shock.

“Sixth brother, do you think... Fourth Brother is a match for him? !”

Tang Ling ‘ER’s expression changed drastically as she looked at Tang Yuan with uncertainty.

“A few days ago, second brother said that he might not be a match for Ren Xingchen...”

Tang Yuan’s eyes flickered as he said slowly. After saying this, he did not say anything else.

This was because everyone could see that the nameless prodigy was stronger than Ren Xingchen.

“This ranking, perhaps no one can stop the nameless prodigy!”

A young man sighed and said heavily.

“Who said that? Our Divine Wind Academy’s Senior Qian ye is definitely stronger than him!”

At this moment, a voice of objection sounded.

A young man dressed in divine wind academy’s uniform raised his head with an unconvinced expression. “With our senior Qian Ye’s strength, that nameless prodigy is definitely not a match for him!”

“That’s right, our senior Qian ye is the strongest. HMPH, back then, our senior also defeated a top ten genius with a single move!”

“I feel that even Qian Ye isn’t a match for the nameless genius. Mu Yuan is ranked ninth, yet he was able to insta-kill him with a single move. What kind of concept is that? Even Qian ye isn’t able to do it!”

“That’s right. It’s obvious that the nameless genius is powerful. Qian ye is definitely not a match for him!”

“Nonsense. Our senior brother Qian ye is the strongest in the younger generation. No one is his match!”

“Everyone from the Divine Wind Academy, is it so difficult to admit that someone else is strong? It’s definitely the nameless prodigy!”

“Bullsh * t, I dare say that as long as the nameless prodigy dares to challenge our senior Qian Ye, he will definitely be taught a good lesson!”

Suddenly, the entire Heaven’s pride stage became lively as voices of debate rang out one after another.

Many people believed that the Nameless Heaven’s pride expert was the strongest and could defeat the entire Heaven’s pride ranking.

On the other hand, the Divine Wind Academy and some others believed that Qian ye was the strongest and that the Nameless Heaven’s pride expert was definitely not a match for her.

Slowly, more and more people joined in and almost started arguing.

They were just short of picking up their weapons and starting a fight.

“Compared to Qian Ye? That nameless expert is still a little lacking!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Tang Yuan swept his gaze across the group of people who were arguing. He walked straight into the Heaven’s pride pavilion with a bad look on his face.

A battle between the Hanhai Empire and Ling Jian ‘ER had ended in the dispute between the Nameless Heaven’s pride expert and Qian Ye.

“Senior...”

At this moment, Ren Xingchen, who was chasing Wang Xian to the heaven’s pride stage, shouted at Wang Xian hesitantly.

“Alright, Hurry up and hide when you have nothing to do. Don’t let the people from the Hanhai Empire kill you!”

Wang Xian turned around and said to Ren Xingchen with a frown.

“Senior, I want to follow you!”

Ren Xingchen lowered his head and said weakly to Wang Xian.

“You’re so weak. Don’t Hold Me Back!”

Wang Xian shook his head and looked at Ling Jian ‘er who was beside him.

“I want to repay you for saving my life!”

Ling Jian ‘er looked at him and said.
