Chapter 1168: 1169 came to a shocking end

“According to the information we received, this dragon assassin organization is a race of demonic beasts. They are good at hiding and possess the light attribute. They...”

“Lord Ling, Lord Ling! !”

Ling Kaitian glanced at City Lord Liu who was checking the communication stone plate. He then looked at the four people beside him and said slowly.

However, just as he opened his mouth, city Lord Liu, whose forehead was covered in cold sweat, hurriedly interrupted him.

“Eh?”

Ling Kaitian looked at City Lord Liu with slight displeasure, his gaze fixed on him.

“Lord Ling, something has happened, something big has happened!”

City Lord Liu swallowed a mouthful of saliva and looked at him with an extremely embarrassed expression. “Something has happened in the eight towns under Bright Moon City!”

“Something has happened in the town? What Happened?”

Ling Kaitian frowned and asked him.

“It was the dragon spike. The dragon Spike actually assassinated the mayors of the eight towns under Bright Moon City just now. All the mayors were thrown at the entrance of the Mayor’s residence!”

“Furthermore, there was a note beside them that said, ‘tell your king that it was us who assassinated him. If you want to continue, then we will continue as well!'”

“All eight town mayors have been killed. All of the town mayors have died. Eight towns are currently in Chaos!”

City Lord Liu swallowed a mouthful of saliva and reported with a grim expression.

Eight town mayors had been killed at the same time. This was a huge blow to bright moon city.

Even for star-moon kingdom, this was an extremely important matter.

The head of a town guarded a town. With the death of the head of a town, the entire town would be left in an ungoverned state.

A town might not be important to the kingdom, but eight towns, even for star-moon kingdom, would be extremely important.

“What?”

Ling Kaitian’s expression changed slightly, and he stood up abruptly, his face darkening.

“The heads of eight towns were assassinated?”

Ling Kaitian asked in a low voice with a gloomy expression.

“Lord Ling, this is only an accident in the towns under Bright Moon City. I wonder if there are any other towns that have been assassinated. If there are, there might be more than eight!”

City Lord Liu lowered his head with an extremely ugly expression.

This dragon Spike actually sent people to assassinate all the town mayors under Bright Moon City. This was no different from assassinating a prince!

When Ling Tiankai Heard City Lord Liu’s words, his expression changed slightly.

Without the slightest hesitation, he immediately took out his communication stone plate and contacted the city lords of the various cities.

As the second strongest person in star-moon kingdom and the only king with a different surname in star-moon kingdom, Ling Kaitian’s authority was second only to that of the king.

All the City Lords did not dare to hide anything from him.

One by one, messages were sent to his side, causing his expression to become gloomier and gloomier.

“King Ling, What’s the situation?”

Xing Guanghun looked at Ling Kaitian’s expression and frowned as he asked with a grave expression.

“Peng!”

Ling Kaitian sat down on the chair, his expression constantly changing. “Up till now, 20 town Mayors have been killed. This matter needs to be reported to the king for handling!”

“What?” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“20 Town Mayors!”

“How... How is this possible? How can the dragon spike have so many terrifying experts!”

The group of five insightful void realm experts, star-moon kingdom’s top existences, widened their eyes in disbelief when they heard Ling Kaitian’s words.

20 town mayors!

20 towns. To assassinate a town mayor, one had to have at least the strength of a transcendent level 9.

Twenty towns represented twenty rank 9 transcendent assassins!

How could the dragon spike have so many terrifying experts?

One had to know that within the undercurrent assassin organization, there were only five rank 9 transcendent experts.

Just these five experts, together with the undercurrent master, dominated the entire star-moon kingdom’s underground.

Yet, the dragon Spike actually had at least twenty!

Perhaps this number was much, much higher, because the dragon Spike still had quite a number of assassins within Bright Moon City.

The expressions of the five insightful emptiness realm experts kept changing.

They knew what it meant to have so many top-notch assassins.

It meant that they could kill all the mayors of eighty towns in star-moon kingdom.

It could cause a city to sink into a state of panic.

Back when the undercurrent was famous in star-moon kingdom, the king had paid special attention to it.

In the end, they had even cooperated with the undercurrent.

A powerful assassin organization, even if it was a kingdom, would be extremely fearful.

The birth of a transcendent level 9 assassin was not inferior to nurturing a half-step void interpretation expert.

A half-step void interpretation expert was not inferior to a void interpretation expert.

The strength of an assassin lay in their divine abilities. They were all used to kill.

The inheritance of an assassin was extremely difficult.

Twenty level 9 extraordinary assassins could cause the star-moon kingdom to fall into a state of panic.

Ling Kaitian expressionlessly transmitted this information to the king.

The entire city Lord’s Manor fell silent.

The situation had already far exceeded their imaginations. It was no longer something they could decide!

Now, if they wanted to deal with the dragon spike, perhaps the towns below the kingdom would be completely massacred by the dragon spike!

For a time, the four insightful void martial artists who had just arrived here and vowed to destroy the dragon spike, their bodies filled with murderous aura, all withered.

...

“The town mayors of twenty towns have been assassinated by the dragon Spike!”

Within star-moon kingdom, the star-moon King sat on the dragon throne with his eyes closed, muttering.

He just sat there and did not open his eyes for a full ten minutes.

Finally, he sent a message to Ling Kaitian.

Return!

“Return!”

Within the mansion of the city lord of Bright Moon City, Ling Kaitian’s pupils constricted when he saw these two words.

However, he was not too surprised.

His opponent was too mysterious and too powerful. He was also an assassin organization.

Facing such an enemy, it was completely unwise to make an enemy out of him.

Even if the third prince was killed!

However, the life of the third prince was insignificant compared to the lives of eighty towns and the entire star-moon Kingdom’s dynasty.

The king could not possibly suffer heavy losses because of one son.

The king might have to deal with the dragon Spike next, but it was definitely not now.

Because right now, the king and the dragon Spike really could not afford to play with each other.

“Hu, let’s go back!”

Ling Kai Tian looked at Xing Guang and the other two and said expressionlessly.

Xing Guang and the other two were slightly stunned and nodded silently.

They also knew the King’s concerns. If it were them, they would also make the same choice.

There was no other way. Facing such a crazy and powerful assassin organization, if they could not directly destroy it, it would be a disaster for the kingdom.

The King couldn’t bear it, and neither could the kingdom.

However, they had arrived at Bright Moon city in an awe-inspiring manner, as if they were the ruler of the world. However, they had left in less than an hour.

This was a little too much of a slap to their faces!

It wasn’t just a slap to their faces. It was also a slap to the face of the entire star-moon kingdom.

When City Lord Liu and the Bright Moon Army general heard this, bitterness appeared on their faces.

Even Ling Sir They all left, then here is the world of the dragon Spike!
