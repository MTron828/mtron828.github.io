Chapter 1281: I’ll help you take the throne

Translator: 5496903

Everyone lived in a different environment, and her thoughts were also different.

Ling Jian ‘ER had a very beautiful childhood, and even when she was twenty years old, she had a perfect background.

But her mother was assassinated by er Niang and her younger brother, and she killed them.

Her father chased her out, and for more than ten years, she lived alone in the Ladyboy graveyard.

Under such circumstances, it was indeed able to change a person’s heart. Some people who were not strong-willed would even have their hearts distorted.

During this period of time, Ling Jian ‘er did not trust anyone. She kept to herself and looked at the entire world coldly.

It was only until Wang Xian appeared and helped her twice. Although the communication between them was very simple, to Ling Jian ‘er, this was the only person who had barged into her world in the past ten years.

She, who didn’t understand the ways of the world and didn’t understand love, would say such words.

Ling Jian ‘er didn’t even know if she liked Wang Xian. She just wanted to be by his side.

Especially in the past few days, when the Heavenly Sword sect came to look for her and begged her to go back, her father came to acknowledge her and wanted to bring her back.

This made her very conflicted. That was why she wanted to be by Wang Xian’s side even more.

“I think there’s a fool... HMM, there’s a person whose temper is very similar to yours. He might be very suitable for you, Ren Xingchen!”

Wang Xian looked at Ling Jian ‘er speechlessly and said directly.

“You want me to find a fool... a Fool? I don’t want to be with a fool!”

Ling Jian ‘er frowned slightly when she heard Wang Xian’s words and spoke frankly as well.

When Wang Xian heard her words, he was utterly defeated.

Ling Jian ‘Er and Ren Xingchen were very similar. They would not turn back if they did not hit the wall. They might not turn back even if they hit the wall.

Both of them had problems in their hearts.

Obviously, it was impossible for the two of them to see eye to eye.

“Your father is able to walk out from the knot in his heart. I think you should be able to walk out. After all, he is your father. I think you can go back with him!”

Wang Xian stopped talking about what happened earlier and changed the topic immediately.

“I don’t have a knot in my heart, and I’m not in the wrong!”

Ling Jian ‘er looked at him and said with determination in her eyes.

Wang Xian opened his mouth and sat down weakly. “You are not in the wrong. Everything is your father’s fault. Then, you should let your father make it up to you, right?”

“He is your father after all. The reason why you were able to live safely in the tomb of the demi-human for the past ten years was all because of your father. You weren’t killed by the Hanhai dynasty at The Prodigy stage. It was all because of your father!”

“That’s why I said that he was at fault. However, you have to give him a chance to make up for it. After all, he is your father. He must have been very angry in that situation. After all, you killed his son!”

Wang Xian took a sip of tea and looked at her.

Ling Jian ‘er was deep in thought. After a few seconds of silence, she said, “But that doesn’t stop me from following you!”

“Forget it, forget it. I don’t like cold people like you. If you want to follow me, that’s fine too. You can be a servant girl, serving tea, pouring water, washing clothes, cooking, and washing feet!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he crossed his legs and looked at her mockingly.

“Ren Xingchen asked me where you are, but I didn’t tell him. I feel that he can serve you tea, pouring water, washing clothes, cooking, and washing feet. HMPH!”

As Ling Jian ‘er spoke, she snorted coldly. She carried Xiao Ha and turned around to leave.

“F * ck, you...”

When Wang Xian saw her leaving, he stood up with a stunned expression. He then shook his head speechlessly.

“You should go back to your father’s place. Oh right, don’t let Ren Xingchen bother me. If he comes looking for you again, let him join Your Heavenly Sword sect!”

Wang Xian said directly.

Ling Jian ‘ER’s body paused for a moment. She didn’t reply and her figure disappeared.

“It’s difficult to communicate with people who are eccentric!”

Wang Xian smiled and shook his head.

However, what he didn’t know was that in the sky 10,000 meters away, the white-haired middle-aged man had an excited expression on his face.

The old man beside him also had a happy expression.

“Sect leader, I feel that the knot in Jian ‘ER’s heart should be solved very soon!”

An excited expression appeared on the old man’s face.

With his strength reaching their level, coupled with the fact that he had lived for more than a thousand years, he was able to sense every fluctuation of Ling Jian ‘ER’s emotions.

Just now, he was able to see Ling Jian ‘ER’s hesitation and hesitation. This was a very good sign.

Moreover, that nameless sword demon actually allowed Ren Xingchen to join their heavenly sword sect.

This was Ren Xingchen, ranked third on the prodigy roll. Most importantly, they could tell that Ren Xingchen’s strength would definitely be extraordinary in the future!

If Ling Jian ‘er returned with Ren Xingchen, their heavenly sword sect would at most be able to contend against the blood flow empire in a hundred years.

“I’ll go look for Jian ‘er!”

The white-robed middle-aged man did not hesitate and flew towards Ling Jian ‘ER’s courtyard.

Just as Wang Xian shook his head speechlessly, the communication stone plate beside him vibrated.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian looked over.

He didn’t have any friends here. The only person who sent him a message was long Xiaotian.

Looking at the contents of the message, he frowned slightly.

“Brother Wang Xian, you should be more careful recently. I received news that a few of my brothers seem to want to deal with you!”

“I have found a mole among my subordinates. They have already found out about you helping me tame the nether deer!”

“They will definitely make a move against you recently. Do you want to come to my place and stay in the Guanglong Island? No one will dare to harm you!”

Long Xiaotian sent three sentences with a worried look.

“It seems like I have completely fallen into the battle for the throne of the Guanglong Dynasty?”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered and a hint of contemplation appeared on his face. “However, since I am involved, I shall be involved. I shall help long Xiaotian to take the throne. In the future...”

He was deep in thought. In the near future, the dragon and Phoenix Dynasty would definitely come here.

It would be much better if he had an ally.

Moreover, at the Heaven’s sword sect...

“It’s alright. We will go to the blood refinement ground tomorrow. I will help you tame some ferocious beasts. I will help you to take the throne!”

Wang Xian replied to Long Xiaotian.

It was a very domineering reply!

In a training ground on the Guanglong Dynasty Island, Long Xiaotian stood next to a corpse with a gloomy face.

Around him, there were more than three hundred people standing there.

When he saw the message sent by Wang Xian, his eyes widened, followed by a look of pleasant surprise on his face.

“Haha, good brother. Haha, Haha, what a good brother!”

He couldn’t help but laugh wildly.

This caused the subordinates around him to look at the second prince in astonishment.

Since when did the second prince lose his composure?

However, what they didn’t know was how excited long Xiaotian was when he saw Wang Xian’s promise. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

This meant that the throne was within his grasp.

As long as Wang Xian helped him tame hundreds of powerful ferocious beasts, what was there to be afraid of even if all his brothers joined forces?
