The Dragon King wants him to go there?

Deep Swamp Abyss widened his eyes and his body kept trembling.

Why did the Dragon King ask him to go there?

How did the Dragon King Find Him?

“What happened? Then why did the Dragon King Find Him?”

When the old man heard this, his face was also a little flustered. He naturally knew about his son’s matter.

This time, his son’s death was killed by the Dragon King.

Now, the Dragon Palace actually came looking for him?

This was going to…

“Deacon Zuo, let’s go over as soon as possible. Once our deep pool race infuriates the Dragon King, we will be exterminated!”

The disciple of the deep pool race urged.

“No, no, father, I won’t go over. I Won’t go over!”

The Deep Swamp Abyss was terrified. He quickly ran outside.

“Phew, let’s Go!”

Deacon Zuo took a deep breath and stretched out his hand to grab his body.

“No, no, father. The Dragon King will kill me. The Dragon King will kill me.”

The Deep Swamp Abyss roared in fear.

“Yuan ‘er, how did you provoke the Dragon King?”

Deacon Zuo’s expression was equally unsightly as he stared at his son and roared in a low voice.

“I. . . I. . . Father, I only said a few things on the universe’s AI. I didn’t provoke him in any other way. Back then, he directly killed all of us!”

Deep Swamp Abyss shook his head in fear.

“Stupid!”

Deacon Zuo’s expression was incomparably gloomy. “Can such inherited powerhouses be easily provoked? can their methods be imagined by you?”

As he spoke, he brought his son and flew towards the sky.

“No, no, father, don’t!”

Abyss roared with a face full of despair.

“There’s nothing I can do. You’ll have to rely on your own luck from now on!”

Deacon Zuo said weakly.

Provoking the Dragon King wasn’t something he could solve.

If it wasn’t good, their entire Abyss race would have to pay a heavy price.

If anyone was to blame, it would be their son who had provoked the other party.

Boom

Soon, Deacon Zuo brought the Deep Swamp Abyss out of the swamp. Looking at Wang Xian who was in the sky, his eyes were filled with fear.

The Dragon King in front of him was too ruthless!

“Dragon King, the Deep Swamp Abyss has been brought over!”

The leader of the deep swamp race immediately said respectfully.

Wang Xian moved his palm. The grayish energy transformed into claws and grabbed him directly.

“No, no, no!”

Deep Pool Abyss roared with a face full of despair.

Buzz

Wang Xian’s eyes flashed with a demonic expression as he cast the soul-absorbing spell.

He wanted to check some information. If the deep pool tribe was involved in something that was bad for the Dragon Palace, he would not let them off today.

Deep Pool Abyss’s body was suspended in the air and he was motionless.

When the tribe leader of the Deep Pool tribe saw this scene, his expression changed drastically.

At this moment, they were also a little scared and flustered.

If it were to implicate their deep pool tribe, how would they be able to resist this dragon king.

The tribe leader of the deep pool tribe was filled with anxiety. His expression changed drastically.

He moved his palm and a box appeared in his hand. He waited there anxiously.

“Peng!”

After checking the memories of Deep Pool Abyss, Wang Xian waved his arm and killed him.

“Dragon King, my disciple from deep pool tribe has offended you. This is our apology gift. Please accept it, Dragon King!”

Seeing that Wang Xian had killed deep pool abyss, Deep Pool Tribe Leader’s heart skipped a beat. With a wave of his arm, boxes containing powerful force flew towards Wang Xian.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and swept his gaze over.

Some seventh-level universe Knight Pills and a acquired treasure.

This could be said to be a considerable amount of effort!

“Dragon King, there is also this map of Paradise. It was obtained by our previous tribe leader. It should be useful to you!”

Deep Pool tribe leader waved his hand again and a box flew over. He was introducing it.

“Grotto-heaven blessed map?”

Wang Xian’s interest was piqued. He raised his eyebrows and his eyes sparkled.

He opened the box. It was a special stone that looked like a treasure map. There were some routes and images carved on it.

Looking at this grotto-heaven blessed map, his eyes sparkled.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian put away all the treasures. His figure gradually turned illusory and disappeared!

At the side, the Heaven Array also disappeared.

Seeing Wang Xian leave, the deep pool tribe leader and the rest heaved a heavy sigh of relief.

They never expected that on this day, they would be so respectful to a force that surrounded the starry sky.

Buzz

In the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian’s figure appeared in the Dragon King’s Hall.

After returning this time, he was in a good mood.

This time, not only were the treasures of the righteous God race returned, but he also obtained a large amount of treasures and resources.

There were two acquired true treasures, one treasure map, and the corpses of the strong warriors from the Lich kingdom that he had killed.

These resources were enough to raise the Dragon Palace’s strength by quite a bit.

They could bring at least 30,000 universe knights to the Dragon Palace.

Now, with 60,000 plus 30,000, he could get close to 100,000.

The most important thing was that this time, he could increase many high-end fighters of the Dragon Palace.

After destroying three main cities of the Lich Kingdom, there were more than 20 universe knights at Level 7.

As for the other levels, there was no need to mention them.

“Dragon King!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Sensing the return of the Dragon King, Prime Minister Turtle immediately came to pay his respects.

“Since the main planet of the ancient sea tribe has already collapsed, let’s move the Dragon Palace directly to the edge of the heaven-splitting primordial lands this time!”

“In addition, all the members of the Dragon Palace have absorbed the resources to increase their strength. After AO he and the rest have achieved a breakthrough, we will directly land!”

Wang Xian instructed Prime Minister Gui.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister gui immediately replied, “I am now preparing to look for some paradise in the heaven-splitting primordial lands to see which is more suitable for our Dragon Palace!”

“Yes, that’s fine. Make preparations in advance. Also, recruit some disciples!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile.

The Dragon Palace was not in a hurry to proceed with the landings. All they had to do was to wait for Ao crab and the rest to make a breakthrough.

Furthermore, Wang Xian pondered for a moment and was also prepared to recruit some disciples of the Dragon Palace.

Although the number of one million members of the Dragon Palace was not a small number, it was definitely not much compared to a race.

Let’s see if we can recruit one million more this time and expand it.

After all, having more people meant having more strength.

Once the Dragon Palace entered the heaven opening primal continent, the races that would compete with them would be high-level races in the universe.

In the end, they might even compete with the peak races in the universe.

At the peak of the Divine Dragon Clan, there were about one million pure-blooded divine dragons, and there were even more other dragon races.

The number of the Dragon Palace had to be increased.

With the influence of the Dragon Palace, it would be very easy to recruit disciples.

It was estimated that all the water tribe experts in the surrounding starry sky would swarm over.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded in agreement.
