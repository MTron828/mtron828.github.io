3508 Under the friendship of the 3507 Great Elves

“Why are there so many of them?”

Wang Xian could not help but ask this question.

A race could be called a peak race once they had a master of the universe.

A master of the universe. This was a qualitative change.

“Because of the resources and the war, there are some things that you have yet to come into contact with. There is no need for you to know now. You need to know one thing. A master of the universe has no right to speak to a peak race in the universe.”

“The top races in the universe have a rule. The top races can not interfere in their affairs personally. This is the rule. No top race would dare to break it first. However, once they advance to the top race, this rule will no longer exist.”

“Of course, there are rules between the top races and the top races. There are almost no fights. However, there are things that are more terrifying than fights. Therefore, sometimes, advancing to the top race may not be a good thing. After you have dozens of experts at the level of a universe dominator under you, you can announce that the Dragon Palace has returned to the top.”

The old elf continued to speak to him.

Although his words were not incomprehensible, Wang Xian did not get much information from it.

The rules of a peak race?

Resources?

War?

Something Scarier than a battle?

“Hehe, you don’t have to think too much now. There are still billions of years before the arrival of the calamity. Improve yourself well. I look forward to your revival with the Divine Dragon Race.”

A great elf in the middle said with a smile.

“I will definitely!”

Wang Xian nodded and said with a smile.

Currently, among the peak races in the universe, all of them had a large number of experts at the ruler realm.

Although Wang Xian didn’t know how many of the Peak Divine Dragon Clan were at the ruler realm, there were at least 10,000 of them.

This was the least he could guess. He didn’t know the exact number.

As for the rules and the war, there were no legacies in this area.

He did not know if the seniors of the Divine Dragon Clan were hiding it on purpose or if they were afraid that some things would be a form of pressure, so they hid it.

Wang Xian was more inclined to the latter.

“Dragon King, you can come to our Elf clan anytime. You can cultivate here or hide in danger. With your current strength, it will be difficult for anyone below the level of the ruler of the universe to kill you. Those who are at the level of the ruler will be watched by our Elf clan. No one will dare to violate the rules and touch you. Work hard. Today, we will form a good relationship with you.”

The Big Elf in the middle said with a smile.

“Thank you, senior. I, Wang Xian, will remember your kindness today!”

Wang Xian cupped his hands and stood up. His face was filled with gratitude. “In the future, the Dragon Palace will definitely repay you. I shall not disturb all of you.”

“Hehe, good karma is good karma. Then, Dragon King, we shall not hold you back. In the future, Summon your accompanying Elf and you can enter and exit our Elf clan as you wish.”

The Big Elf in the middle said with a smile.

Wang Xian nodded his head and cupped his hands once again. After that, he bade farewell and left.

With Wang Xian’s strength and ability, he was not qualified to repay the favor he had done today.

Wang Xian remembered the friendship between the Big Elves and the Elves in his heart.

He flew out. Wang Xian looked behind him and immediately flew back to where he came from.

Huala

Just as he was flying forward, a leaf suddenly floated towards him.

“This is a leaf!”

The leaf landed in front of him and a calm voice appeared in his mind.

Wang Xian was slightly stunned. He picked up the leaf beside him and a stream of information gushed into his mind.

A leaf!

A blind spot!

This was a leaf that could conceal one’s attributes. Even in a battle, it could conceal one’s attribute aura.

Wang Xian moved his palm and a flame appeared in his hand. Through the vision of the ghost avatar in his body, he could see and sense that this was a branch, a bright red branch.

With a move of his palm, the flame condensed into a fire sword. The Ghost Avatar’s vision and senses showed that this was a wooden sword

A leaf that could obstruct one’s vision!

It was an extremely powerful concealing treasure.

It was simply unbelievable.

This was to better conceal the attributes that he possessed.

“Thank you, senior of the Elf tribe. I, Wang Xian, will definitely repay you tenfold and hundredfold in the future!”

Wang Xian turned around to express his gratitude and continued to fly out.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

While Wang Xian was at it, the group of great elves from the Tree of life immediately flew out and looked up.

“Empress, you are actually paying attention to him too!”

The group of great elves came to the top of the tree of life and looked at a beautiful wooden house condensed from the tree of life. They spoke with respect.

“He has great potential. The Divine Dragon Clan needs such a leader.”

A voice came from the wooden house.

“Seven attributes. It is indeed a little heaven-defying. I wonder if he can step into your realm and step into the realm of the water god Dragon.”

The old Great Elf said softly.

“Difficult!”

A word came from inside the wooden house.

The rest of the great elves nodded their heads slightly.

The more attributes one had, the stronger one would be. However, the more attributes one had, the more difficult it would be to step into the realm of invincibility.

“When the calamity arrives, I hope there will be another peak race.”

A great elf sighed softly.

…

“I owe them a huge favor this time.”

Wang Xian was not someone who liked to owe people favors. However, he did owe the elves a huge favor this time.

Three drops of the liquid of life. One drop allowed him to achieve a breakthrough in his strength.

One drop was given to the spirit while the other was absorbed by the water lotus of the twelfth grade.

After the water lotus of the twelfth grade absorbed it, the three flower buds grew several times larger.

This made Wang Xian a little amazed. The level of the tree of life could not be described with the innate treasure divine tree.

He was probably only one step away from the Heaven’s origin creation.

However, he would never be able to cross this step.

It was rumored that one attribute could only give birth to one heaven’s origin creation. With the divine tree as the Heaven’s origin creation, there would not be a second one.

The ancestral tree was the Heaven’s origin creation.

After arriving at the fairy flower city through the teleportation formation, Wang Xian flew towards the entangled land at a terrifying speed.

The Golden Hoop Sky plant demonic beast had already been killed by the elven experts. However, there were still eight level two masters of the universe there. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Before the Azure Dragon Whisker Shadow took control of the Azure Dragon Palace, it would be difficult for these experts to resist.

Wang Xian sent them a message and continued to fly forward.

Having achieved a breakthrough in his strength, his speed had reached an astounding level. He had escaped for more than two months when he came here. Now, he had arrived above the entangled land in more than two hours.

At this moment, the Green Dragon Beard Shadow, Green Dragon Moon, and the rest also sent him a message. After reading the message, his eyes flickered.

Azure Dragon Beard Shadow didn’t completely control the Dragon Palace now, but it greatly prevented the sky plant demon beast powerhouses from taking over the Dragon Palace.

It was still in a stalemate.
