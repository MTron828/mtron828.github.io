“The sect leader will personally handle the matter of elder Ming and the others. All the disciples of the immortal sect will wait for the news!”

“The murderer will be beheaded by the sect leader. Anyone who dares to provoke us, the disciples of the Ming King Immortal sect, will be punished!”

“If the sect leader makes a move, no matter who the other party is, they will have to pay the price of blood!”

“Lord sect leader, please hang the Dragon King’s corpse in our Mingwang City and let everyone know the fate of those who dare to kill our disciples!”

The elite disciples were killed, and the elders of the immortal sects were killed!

The exaggerated post on the forum had completely aroused the anger of the people of the two immortal sects.

Even the powerhouses of the immortal sects were full of anger and killing intent when they saw the post.

However, the sect master had already ordered them to deal with it personally, which made the disciples of the immortal sects look excited.

If the immortal sect master made a move, the other party would definitely be killed!

Now, they just needed to wait for the news.

They just needed to wait for the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate to be killed and the Dragon Gate to be destroyed!

A former force of the Jianghu dared to challenge their immortal sects. They were courting death!

At this moment, at the top of a mountain peak.

There was a small platform on top of the mountain peak, and six seats were placed on the platform.

Curling White smoke rose from the mountain peak.

At this moment, six figures stood on the platform, two white figures, two blue figures.

There was also a golden figure and an earthy yellow figure.

The six people stood on the mountain peak, and their faces could not be seen clearly. Each of them seemed to be a small world.

“Have you read the information about the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate?”

“It’s a little surprising. This Dragon Gate and the Dragon King are not simple. Since they dare to say such words, it’s almost certain that they have the strength of an immortal God!”

“No matter what, their actions are a provocation to our two immortal sects. If we don’t destroy them, I’m afraid that all the immortal sects will laugh at us. We can’t even deal with a force that once belonged to the Jianghu!”

“It doesn’t matter if they have immortal gods or not. There are a few immortal god experts who must be destroyed!”

“With the two brothers wind devil, the six of us, even if they have three immortal god experts, will die!”

“Don’t worry, everyone. Since we’ve joined your immortal sects, we’re already prepared to fight against a strong enemy together!”

“It’s still easy to destroy a force that once belonged to the pugilistic world!”

On the platform, the calm voices of six people could be heard. They were talking at a moderate pace.

“Jiang City’s seaside villa. Let’s go there.”

The six people moved and instantly disappeared from the peak of the mountain, flying towards Jiang City.

Ming Wang Immortal sect and puppet immortal sect were not considered powerful immortal sects among the twenty immortals.

Their overall ranking was below fifteen. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

In the past, the two immortal sects only had four immortal god-level powerhouses. Later on, due to a coincidence, two immortal god-level powerhouses were added.

The speed of the six of them was extremely terrifying. In less than ten minutes, they appeared at the Villa area by the sea.

Streams of terrifying energy swept across.

“Dragon King of Dragon Gate, come out and face your death!”

A calm voice rang out and covered the entire area.

“Oh? You came so quickly!”

At this moment, Wang Xian, who was staying in his room, smiled when he heard the voice.

He wasn’t too surprised by the arrival of the two immortals from the immortal sects.

At this moment, the immortals were forbidden to make a move in the martial arts world. That was only an agreement between the immortal sects.

The Dragon Gate wasn’t part of the original agreement. Therefore, the immortals from the two immortal sects didn’t have any reservations.

“There are six immortals. This is a little unexpected!”

Wang Xian sensed the six figures in the sky and revealed a look of surprise.

According to the news, there were only four immortals from the two immortal sects. Now that there were two more, it was completely out of his expectations.

“However, so what if there are six Immortals?”

The corners of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly as he walked out slowly.

“You came quite quickly!”

His faint voice rang out in the sky. In a villa beside him, ao Jian was holding a spiritual sword in his arms as he walked out of the villa slowly.

“Do you know your crime?”

When one of the immortals in the sky heard Wang Xian’s voice, his gaze turned cold!

“Your disciple didn’t discipline him strictly. In that case, I can only help you to kill him. Six Immortals, Hehe, this is really unexpected!”

Wang Xian walked out of the villa slowly and raised his head to stare at the sky indifferently.

This caused the immortals from the Ming Wang and puppet immortal sects to frown slightly.

Too Calm!

Too Calm!

It was as if they had already expected their arrival!

This made their faces solemn and their hearts vigilant.

There wasn’t a single idiot among the immortals who dared to wait for them here. They must have their own background.

“Two of them!”

The old man who was emitting an earthy yellow figure sensed the area below and said faintly.

“Two celestials still dare to be so arrogant. They are really as described in the information!”

A white figure snorted coldly. Killing intent gradually surged from his body.

Swoosh! Swoosh

Wang Xian and Ao Jian moved and stood in the void. They stared at them who were a thousand meters away.

“Eh?”

Suddenly, a look of surprise flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes. He looked at the two old men who were emitting blue light.

“Eh?”

At this moment, the two old men were stunned as well.

Their bodies stiffened. They stared at Wang Xian and Ao Jian in shock. Their eyes flickered.

“Dragon Gate. I really didn’t expect that there would be two immortals!”

A white figure’s body shimmered as a staff appeared in front of him. He stared coldly at Wang Xian and Ao Jian.

“Just two celestials and you dare to provoke us? Do you think that we can’t do anything to You? Today, we are going to kill the Celestials!”

A low growl came out from the golden figure’s mouth as a strange golden puppet appeared beside him.

The puppet was three meters in size, and it was emitting a sharp metallic light.

“You killed our disciples. Even if you are immortal gods, you will die here today!”

Numerous spirit tools containing terrifying energy appeared in front of them, and the pressure of immortal gods instantly covered them.

“Three to kill one. It’s easy. Brother Windfiend, windfiend, and windfiend, we’ll take care of the middle-aged man who is emitting sword light!”

A white figure holding a scepter said with a cold gaze.

“Cough Cough!”

The two old men with blue figures could not help but cough violently and looked around with some trepidation.

“Huh?”

The other four experts from the Ming King Immortal sect and the puppet immortal sect sensed the expressions of the two old men and immediately frowned. A hint of displeasure flashed in their eyes.

“Wind Devil and Wind Fiend Brothers, the powerful enemy is at the front!”

“Let’s Retreat!”

At this moment, an old man suddenly opened his mouth and whispered to them.

This caused the four immortal gods to be completely stunned, and their faces revealed a stunned expression.

“Wind Devil and Wind Fiend Brothers, what nonsense are you talking about?”

A hint of ice-cold voice flashed in the eyes of the four people as they stared at him.
