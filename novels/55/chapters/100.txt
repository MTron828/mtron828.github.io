“Yes, Sir. $9,308. This is your receipt. You may check.”

The waiter nodded and passed him the receipt.

Wang Dahai took the receipt with an embarrassed look. When they started to drink, the cover and a few drinks had cost just more than $2,000. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Even after a second round of drinks ordered, he calculated that it would only add up to not more than $4,000. How did it end up at $9,308?

But when he looked at the drinks that were ordered while they were away in the bathroom, Wang Dahai darkened his expression.

Five bottles of alcohol that cost more than $4,000. On top of that, those fruit and snack platters they ordered added up to the $9,308.

The price was clearly stated, and the pub was not at fault.

Wang Xian looked at the bill and darkened his expression. Wang Dahai did not have over $9,000 with him. His family was well-off, but not to the extent of getting more than $10,000 for his monthly allowances.

$9,000 was peanuts to Wang Xian. He could pay without batting his eyes.

But, he was unhappy with what the three girls did.

They probably treated Wang Dahai as someone who could be bullied by his generosity.

It is right to treat and pay for the three of you. But your friends tagged along. What does that mean?

Wang Xian looked at Wang Dahai, who was looking embarrassed.

Wang Dahai was a person who did not want to shame himself. He could not bring himself to say something as he would rather not disgrace himself.

“More than $9,000?”

Wang Xian took over the bill and put it on the table. He told the waiter, “When we were here, we only ordered drinks that cost about $2,600. We’ll pay for that. We did not order the rest.”

“This...” The waiter looked at Wang Xian, “So who will pay for the rest?”

“You’ll have to ask them that. We are only paying for what we drank!” Wang Xian said nonchalantly.

“Hur?” Three girls and four young men looked over at Wang Xian.

“What? You want us to pay?” the girl who seduced Wang Xian just now frowned at them and asked.

“The drinks and fruits that we treated the three of you to will be paid for by us. The ones that you treated your friends to should be paid for by you guys!” Wang Xian stared at the girl and said.

“What? What do you mean by this?”

Upon hearing what Wang Xian said, Rongrong stood up angrily and glared at Wang Dahai.

“Wang Dahai, what do you mean by this? You asked us out to the pub, and now you want us to pay for ourselves?”

On hearing Rongrong’s question, Wang Dahai’s expression was even more awful than before. He gritted his teeth, lifted his chin, and stared at Rongrong, “I’ll treat you to your drinks. But not your friends!”

“Besides, you guys just ordered the drinks that amount to $9,000 while we were in the bathroom. Do you think I’m a fathead?”

Wang Dahai had finally seen the true colors of Rongrong, so he spoke without giving her any face.

“Fathead?” Rongrong jeered at him, “Hey, you were the one who asked us out. Now you think we’ve ordered too much, and you refuse to pay for it.”

“Do you count yourself as a man? If you don’t have that kind of money, don’t woo any girls. $9,000 is considered expensive? Then why are you here?” A girl next to Rongrong criticized with a sharp remark.

“That’s right, you two paupers. If you had said that you’re broke, we would not have come out with you. Now you refuse to foot the bill. Are you a man? How dare you ask people out when you’re acting this way. Aren’t you a joke?”

The three girls took turns to mock him as they looked at him disdainfully.

Upon hearing their remarks, coldness flashed in Wang Xian’s eyes. He looked at Wang Dahai, who was quivering and took a step forward. “We’re buying drinks for the three of you. Not your friends. So? You need to bring your friends along to get the treats? Don’t they have money?”

“Hey, lad. What do you mean by this? Are you saying that we are so broke that we have to get free drinks from you?”

A young man rolled up his sleeves as he stood up. He stared coldly at Wang Xian when he heard what he said.

“If you have the money, how about paying for what you’ve ordered?” Wang Xian stared at the young man and said emotionlessly, “We’ll pay for the beginning round of drinks. You can pay for the rest that you’ve ordered!”

“I finally got it. Both of you are just too broke, and you guys are finding excuses to leave. If you are broke, why did you ask us out? How funny. Guys like you actually want to woo girls. What a dumbass!” A girl scorned Wang Dahai and Wang Xian.

“Wang Dahai, I never expected you to be someone like this. Guys like you should be made known in the school forum. Let everyone witness what a pauper you are. You’re broke, and you acted tough by asking us out? I bet you borrowed that motorcycle of yours from someone else!” Rongrong said to Wang Dahai coldly.

“You...” Wang Dahai stared at Rongrong, who was unkind with her words, with his eyes red.

“We were blind as we thought you were just ordinary students. Never did I expect that... Hehe!”

Wang Xian scoffed and continued, “We’ll pay for the starting orders. Those that you added on, you’ll pay for yourself.”

“Waiter, we’ll pay $3,000. The rest you can get from them. We didn’t order that!”

The waiter frowned as he looked at the girls and the four young men.

“Hey, what do you mean by that?” Rongrong pointed at Wang Xian and asked furiously.

“Am I not being obvious enough? Whoever ordered the drinks pays for them,” Wang Xian said coldly.

“Pauper, you’re penniless and yet you tried to woo a girl. You’re a thrash!” the young man said to Wang Xian in a cold tone.

“Heh heh.” Wang Xian sneered, “Since you’re not a thrash, you can pay for it.”

“Damn you, I have the money!” The young man took his wallet from his pocket and slammed it on the table. “But I don’t like what I see. I’ll not pay for the bill. You guys are leaving without paying after you asked the girls out?”

“I have the money too, but I’m not spending it on thrashes!” Wang Xian put his foot on the table as he swept his gaze across the three girls. Eventually, he stopped at the young man and spoke coldly.

“Damn, are you seeking trouble? F*ck you. Didn’t you find out who I am? I can beat the shit out of you guys!”

“F*ck, you’re arrogant. Let me tell you this. Today, you’re paying it whether you like it or not. Otherwise, I’ll make sure you guys can’t walk out of the door.”

“Two jerks are running away without paying after asking us out?”

Upon seeing the conceited look of Wang Xian, the young men and girls stood up and glared at him.

One of the young men even removed his shirt, revealing his vest. The areas that the vest could not conceal were filled with tattoos.

“Fine!”

Wang Xian wet his dry lips. He picked up an unopened bottle of wine from the table and smashed it at the middle young man!

Bam!
