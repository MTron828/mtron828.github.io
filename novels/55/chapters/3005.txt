Chapter 3006: The 3006 treasures were divided into different levels, below the acquired spiritual treasure

“There are words on the ground

“I, the Mo Han Ghost Art, the guardian of the Mo Han clan, fought with the skeleton clan before the Great War. I fought to the death with a guardian of the skeleton clan. My body was heavily wounded, and the wounds on my body can not be healed

“If the Great War has already begun, the Mo Han clan is definitely no match for the skeleton clan. The Mo Han clan is about to be annihilated. I am unwilling to accept it, but I can not do anything about it. I will leave First

“If any living being enters this place, other than a acquired spiritual treasure, all the treasures have been given to my clansmen. There’s nothing else!”

“If any clansmen are still alive, my cultivation room contains my life-long witchcraft. It’s my life-long collection, and I can practice it!”

There was only a skeleton body leaning on a golden chair in the center of the cultivation room.

There were a few lines of clear words on the ground.

“So it’s an existence at the guardian level of the Mohan clan. No wonder he’s so strong. He even killed a universe knight before he died. Amazing!”

Ba Qi looked at the words on the ground and clicked his tongue.

“But this guy is a little stingy. He said he didn’t leave any treasures. Oh right, what level is the acquired spiritual treasure? Is it at the Universe Knight Level?”

Following that, Ba Qi asked Wang Xian and the others about the heaven array. He was still looking at his surroundings.

“What about the acquired spiritual treasure?”

He asked in puzzlement.

“I’m not too sure about the grade of the weapons at the center of the Universe!”

Wang Xian shook his head. In the memories of the Divine Dragon’s inheritance, there were very few things regarding weapons.

The Divine Dragon clan basically didn’t use weapons. Their physical body was their best weapon.

If there was a weapon, it might be the natal dragon bead.

Moreover, not every divine dragon cultivated the natal dragon bead.

Therefore, Wang Xian was not very clear about the division of the weapon at the center of the universe.

Tian Chen also shook his head unknowingly. His gaze was also looking around.

“Eh? where is the acquired spiritual treasure that this fellow mentioned?”

An lie also looked around and revealed a curious expression.

Ao crab frowned slightly and immediately flew up into the sky.

On the surrounding walls, there were many secret compartments. In front of the secret compartments, there was a protruding area with chairs on it.

In the secret compartments, there were books.

There were thousands of such secret compartments.

Wang Xian looked around with his dragon eyes and looked in the direction that the treasure-seeking ant was pointing at.

“Huh?”

At this moment, Wang Xian saw a figure on the seat beside a secret compartment above.

“Dragon King, there’s another corpse here!”

At this moment, ao crab also noticed the figure above and immediately said to Wang Xian and the rest.

Swoosh

Wang Xian and the rest frowned slightly and immediately looked up.

“This is?”

At the spot beside the secret compartment that was protruding for reading, a skinny old man was sitting cross-legged on the ground.

The old man was almost skin and bones. His eyes were closed as though there was no flesh and blood.

The green blood vessels were exposed and looked rather terrifying.

“Why is there a dead man?”

Ba Qi looked at the old man who was almost skin and bones and was full of surprise. “Furthermore, it doesn’t look like he is in cahoots with the Mo Han ghost technique. Even his skin isn’t rotten. Could it be that he entered this place later?”

“He’s still alive!”

Wang Xian was also looking at this body. With his powerful perception, he could feel a faint life force in his body.

“What? He’s still alive?”

Ba Qi and the rest were astonished.

An lie approached the old man. After a moment of hesitation, he touched the old man’s head.

“Dragon King, is it obvious that there’s no life force?”

He couldn’t help but ask after sensing for a moment.

“There seems to be a little bit of life here!”

Ba Qi placed his hand on the old man’s body in shock.

“This old man should be the same as us. He entered this place later, but I don’t know what was willing to trigger the array formation here. He was locked inside and couldn’t get out.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“There is nothing to eat or drink here. Although powerful people only need energy to survive, did you notice that there is no more energy here? It has formed a vacuum domain!”

“The spiritual energy here has been completely absorbed by him. Without the spiritual energy, he can only use his physical strength to preserve his life force. It’s obvious that this old man used a special method to seal the consumption of his body so that he could preserve a trace of his life force!”

“I wonder how long he has been here!”

Tian Cheng said in surprise.

“To be able to enter this place, his strength should be at the peak of the Celestial Thearch!”

Wang Xian said as he looked to the side. There was a chessboard at the side.

There were flags on the chessboard with different colors, on the flags were written A, B, C, D, E, F, G, Xin, Ren, GUI, Zi, Chou, Yin, Mao, Chen, Si, Wu, Wei, Shen, you, Xu, Hai and some other words.

The entire chessboard was emitting a mysterious power.

This was obviously a wizard artifact.

Furthermore, it was very likely to be the acquired spiritual treasure mentioned by Mo Han’s ghost technique.

Beside the chessboard, there was a book.

On the book was written the treasure of the universe, the treasure forged with great power.

With a wave of Wang Xian’s arm, a book made of metal appeared in his hand.

He opened the first page.

All living things in the world could be classified into grades. This book mainly introduced the divine artifacts in the universe.

In the center of the universe, the Great Beings divided the treasures into heavenly creation true treasures, also known as Primal Chaos true treasures.

Next were innate true treasures, innate spiritual treasures, acquired treasures, and acquired spiritual treasures.

The first page of the book introduced the division of treasures in the center of the universe.

From weak to strong, acquired spiritual treasures, acquired true treasures, innate spiritual treasures, innate true treasures, and finally primal chaos true treasures.

The weakest among these treasures could only be refined by universe knights.

With powerful treasures, one could kill experts of the same level.

As he continued to scroll down, he found records of some powerful treasures.

There were also some records of Primal Chaos Supreme Treasures. However, the author of this book was not sure if the primal chaos supreme treasure existed.

Wang Xian continued to scroll down and found that there was a page marked at the back.

The page marked was a record of an acquired Numinous Treasure.

An acquired numinous treasure that was like a chessboard was called the heaven acting chessboard.

The heaven acting chessboard, the Wizard’s Array Board, the acquired Numinous Treasure, and it was a very powerful acquired Numinous Treasure.

Its power was almost comparable to some acquired numinous treasures. It was forged by an extremely powerful wizard.

There was a difference between innate and acquired treasures, and the difference was huge.

Innate treasures were treasures that were born from the universe, and they still existed after going through a calamity. Acquired treasures were created by powerful existences with great power.

Innate treasures were much more powerful than acquired treasures.

As for the top-grade Primal Chaos Treasure, the creation treasure, that was a treasure that was born with the universe.

Only the legend of the treasure of chaos, no one has seen!
