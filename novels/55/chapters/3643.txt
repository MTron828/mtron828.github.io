After the five elements millstone broke through, it possessed two terrifying abilities!

First: innate technique!

Innate technique, after the five elements millstone broke through, it could condense a large number of innate numinous treasure phantoms!

These innate numinous treasure phantoms were the innate numinous treasures that the five elements millstone devoured.

From the start till now, the Five Elements Millstone had devoured at least 3000 innate numinous treasures.

More than 3,000 innate spiritual treasures. This was an extremely huge number!

More than 3,000 innate spiritual treasures attacking at the same time. What kind of concept was this?

This move could instantly kill an existence at the first level of the Universe Dominator!

As for the second move, it was even more powerful.

Five elements disc destruction!

Five elements disc destruction. This was the ability of the second move!

As for how powerful it was, Wang Xian had never used it before!

However, when Wang Xian used the innate technique, the five elements millstone beneath his feet trembled slightly. The illusory images of the innate spiritual treasures floated around him!

There were five types of attributes and all sorts of them!

Blades, spears, clubs, halberds, and whips!

More than 3,000 illusory images of the innate spiritual treasures gathered. With a wave of his arm, Wang Xian headed straight for the dozens of gold mountains!

Boom! Boom! Boom

The next moment, the sounds of collision and explosion rang out.

Wang Xian stepped on the five elements grinding mill. His body circled around the tai chi dragon disc. He flapped his incorporeal holy wings and charged straight for the Mad Demon Prohibition!

Boom! Boom! Boom

The attacks of innate spiritual treasures broke through the gold mountains one by one. More than 1,000 innate spiritual treasures disappeared!

The remaining two thousand of them continued to attack the Mad Demon Prohibition!

“So Powerful!”

At this moment, the expression of the mad demon prohibition changed slightly. When he saw Wang Xian who was right in front of him, the forbidden pupils kept jumping!

“Come into my world!”

The black dots in his pupils started to expand rapidly and eventually covered his entire pupil!

Wang Xian, who was rushing over, felt the scene around him changing rapidly. He was completely in the middle of the ocean!

The huge waves around him were churning. In the ocean, there were shadows swimming rapidly!

Wang Xian sensed that there was a space beast behind him that seemed to be trying to devour him!

Everything seemed to be an illusion, but it was also extremely real!

“Is it a special space or an illusion?”

Wang Xian’s dragon eyes scanned his surroundings. Energy was surging in his body!

“Move!”

He let out a low growl and the energy that had been destroyed rushed towards his surroundings!

Crack! Crack! Crack

Splash

In an instant, the energy that had been destroyed swept across. The seawater started to collapse. The Shadows in the sea and the space beasts behind them all collapsed!

Everything was clear in front of Wang Xian!

In front of him, the mad demon prohibition was floating there. There were some bloody marks in his pupils. These bloody marks were extremely clear!

“Is that all you’ve got? If that’s all you’ve got, you can die!”

Wang Xian stared at the mad demon prohibition coldly.

“Crash!”

As soon as he finished his sentence, his figure instantly appeared beside the Mad Demon Prohibition!

His arm turned into a dragon claw and clawed directly at his head!

“What a fast speed!”

“What a strong strength!”

The heart of the mad demon prohibition pounded violently. His pupils stared at Wang Xian’s figure as he retreated backward!

“Too slow!”

Wang Xian stretched out his dragon claws and said with disdain!

“Roar Roar Roar, get lost!”

When the prohibition of madness saw this scene, he suddenly opened his mouth crazily and roared loudly!

His expression was extremely ferocious. At this moment, he seemed to have lost all reason!

The Golden Horn released a beam of golden light that shot to the sky and attacked Wang Xian!

Buzz

The Tai Chi Dragon disc around Wang Xian’s body revolved as energy gathered on his arm!

He continued to claw at the head of the Mad Demon Prohibition!

Bang

The attack of the mad demon prohibition landed on Wang Xian’s Dragon Claw and was blocked by the Dragon Claw!

The backlash of the Tai Chi Dragon Disc landed on his golden horn instantly!

Bang Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Another loud sound was heard. A large amount of blood oozed out from the position of his Golden Horn!

The blue horn immediately emitted a luster and formed a powerful defense around it!

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

However, at this moment, the innate spiritual treasure phantom of the innate technique smashed toward the blue defense!

The strength displayed by the mad demon prohibition could at most be comparable to a five elements millstone!

However, once Wang Xian controlled the five elements millstone, he could easily suppress it!

Not to mention, Wang Xian still had the tai chi dragon plate and the incipient Saint Wings!

Under such circumstances, the mad demon restriction had no way of resisting at all!

The defense of the water element was easily broken by Wang Xian. His dragon claws clawed at the huge golden horn!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The Mad Demon restriction hurriedly retreated backward, trying to escape!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

However, the next moment, he let out an intense scream!

The entire Golden Horn was grabbed off by Wang Xian and detached from his head!

However, although he was screaming in pain, his body kept retreating and was sent flying backward!

At the same time, his pupils became even deeper as if there was a special space inside!

In the space, an extremely terrifying space beast tore out from within.

“Eh?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly when he saw this scene!

“Hiss? This… This Dragon King is so strong. He actually tore off a horn of the mad demon prohibition in such a short period of time!”

“This Dragon King’s strength is so terrifying. The Mad Demon Prohibition is actually not a match for the Dragon King at all. How is this possible? How can the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace have such a deep foundation?”

“The Dragon King’s speed is so terrifying and what a powerful treasure. The Forbidden Spell of madness is at a disadvantage in an instant. However, the forbidden eye of the forbidden spell of madness has been completely opened. Legend has it that he has absorbed a powerful space beast into his forbidden eye. This space beast can boost his energy and can also be summoned!”

“What a terrifying aftershock from the battle. I feel that as long as we get close, this aftershock will be able to kill us. The Dragon King’s strength is much stronger than we imagined. No wonder the old scholar, the Taishui Demon King, and the Black Tower’s wizards were killed by him!”

When the Hundred Old Monsters of the invincible region saw the battle between Wang Xian and the mad demon seal, their faces were filled with shock!

They were extremely shocked by the Dragon King’s terrifying combat strength!

His opponent was the mad demon seal, yet he was suppressed in an instant and even tore off one of his golden horns!

This strength was too terrifying!

“No wonder the Dragon King dared to unleash the ability to sweep across the invincible region. This strength…”

The eyes of the group of old freaks flickered as they watched!

“This galactic Behemoth?”

Wang Xian stared at the galactic behemoth that flew out from the hole of the Mad Demon Prohibition. It had a body size of hundreds of thousands of kilometers and was like a tortoise. Its body was filled with a thick and heavy aura!

“Roar!”

The Mad Demon Prohibition stood in the sky above the galactic behemoth. With a wave of his arm, an incomparably huge golden cudgel appeared in his hand!

It was a cudgel of the innate treasure level!

“Kill, Kill, kill! I’m going to kill you!”

He roared crazily as the space beast beneath him charged straight at Wang Xian!

“Ha, this is your trump card? In that case, you can die now!”

Wang Xian sneered as his dragon eyes flickered!

Dragon Eyes locked onto all corners!
