Chapter 1112: The 1113 Dragon Palace descended

Translator: 5496903

“You want to bring Xiao Lan to explore alone? This... This won’t do. Qingyue, you...”

Upon hearing Lan Qingyue’s words, Wang Xian’s face was filled with astonishment. He quickly shook his head.

“Actually, some time ago, I wanted to enter the transcendence continent, but I was stopped by Prime Minister Gui!”

Lan Qingyue looked at Wang Xian with a hint of determination in her eyes. Following her gaze, she looked at the top of the Dragon Palace.

Boom

At this moment, a huge object blocked the sky above.

It had a gray body and was extremely huge. It looked like a prehistoric giant beast.

The Kun was one of the most powerful creatures in the universe.

When Wang Xian left, the Kun that Lan Qingyue raised was only about 300 meters long. Now, it was at least 600 to 700 meters long.

“Xiao Lan went to the south and north poles that the Dragon Palace has never been to before. She devoured 80% of the creatures there. Now, her cultivation has reached transcendent level six!”

“My strength has also reached transcendent level five. There is no room for Xiao Lan on Earth anymore. I am prepared to go to the transcendence continent with her!”

As Lan Qingyue spoke, her body emitted a gray energy. “Furthermore, Xiao Xian, I have inherited the inheritance of the ancient god who raised the Kun master. I have become the last bloodline of the ancient god Race. I want to help you and not drag you down!”

“This...”

Wang Xian looked at her and was slightly silent.

Lan Qingyue had obtained the inheritance. It was the best inheritance in the universe. There were only a few that could be compared to her.

The Kun of the ancient god Race dared to devour the divine dragons and Phoenixes, as well as all kinds of top-tier races.

A Kun that had grown up was not weaker than the top-tier dragon kings of the Divine Dragons.

After obtaining such an inheritance, Lan Qingyue wanted to become stronger, help him, and show the glory of the ancient god Clan.

“Qingyue, I’m afraid that you will be in danger. The extraordinary continent is not earth. There are countless level six extraordinary creatures there. Your and Xiao Lan’s strength is not enough to deal with the Unknown Danger!”

Wang Xian said with some worry.

“Xiao Xian, don’t worry. The ancient God clan was once hunted down by all the major races in the universe. They are definitely top-notch when it comes to avoiding danger. Moreover, I don’t think that an extraordinary continent can cause the death of an ancient god-level Kun master, even though he is just an ancient god-level Kun master who has just obtained the inheritance!”

Lan qingyue smiled and said confidently.

Wang Xian saw her determined look and touched her face. “I have two void interpretation level corpses here. In a while, pass one of the transformed dragon blood to Xiao Lan!”

“Thank you, Xiao Xian!”

Lan Qingyue kissed him happily.

Wang Xian smiled and said, “Where’s Xiao Yu? I wonder how long it will take for her to return from this trip to the extraordinary continent!”

“Little sister Xiao Yu came back a few days ago. She even said to inform her next time if you are here!”

Guan Shuqing replied to Wang Xian.

“Okay, inform her and ask her if she is going to the supernatural continent!”

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment before replying.

“Alright, let’s inform little sister Xiao Yu!”

The few girls nodded their heads.

Wang Xian looked at the sky and flew into the sky.

On Earth, due to the gravitational force, his speed was ten times faster than that of the extraordinary continent.

The destructive force that he could cause was several times greater than that of the extraordinary continent.

With a single attack, he could cover an area of ten kilometers. He could easily destroy a huge mountain.

Looking around, he could see a location of fifty to sixty kilometers with his Dragon Eyes of light and dark fire.

The entire earth had undergone tremendous changes. Martial arts had gradually replaced science and technology.

“Under the nurturing of the spiritual energy, the Earth’s gravitational force will also increase. At that time, it might reach a balance with the transcendence continent. At that time, it might not be able to fly until one has reached transcendence!”

Wang Xian arrived in the sky above a city within a dozen seconds. Looking at the lush and verdant city below, he thought to himself.

After taking a round, Wang Xian returned to the Dragon Palace.

In the next few days, Wang Xian stayed in the Dragon Palace. The strength of the members of the Dragon Palace was improving at a terrifying speed.

There were hundreds of thousands of corpses, including many high-level corpses. This was a huge improvement to the Dragon Palace.

In the past few days, Ao Yao, Ao Jian, and the rest led Prime Minister Gui to the Sea of the supernatural continent. They were searching for the location of the Dragon Palace.

“Brother!”

On this day, Xiao Yu and Feng Lingtian arrived at the Dragon Palace. Xiao Yu ran over excitedly and hung herself on Wang Xian’s body.

“Alright, you’re already married. You’re such a big girl!”

Wang Xian patted her head with a smile on his face.

“Brother, how many days will you be staying for this time?”

Xiao Yu asked hurriedly.

“I might be staying for four to five days. I’ll be leaving in four to five days. Furthermore, I’m preparing to move the Dragon Palace to the supernatural continent!”

Wang Xian looked at Xiao Yu and said lovingly.

“Ah?”

Xiao Yu was slightly shocked. She stared at him with her eyes wide open. Her face was a little anxious.

“I want to ask if you guys are going to the transcendence continent or staying on Earth!”

Wang Xian looked at Xiao Yu and then at Feng Lingtian before asking directly.

“I. . . That brother-in-law of mine, I have long thought of this day. It is very difficult for me to step into a higher realm while I am on Earth. My lifespan is no more than 500 years. Unless I improve my strength, I will finally be able to reach a higher realm!”

Feng Lingtian, who was standing at the side, smiled. His eyes were shining.

The Great Dao of humanity was eternal life. In this environment on Earth, it was probably the peak for extraordinary experts to appear. If one wanted to step into a higher realm, the only way was to enter a higher world.

“Yes, brother. From now on, we will live in the Dragon Palace and fight side by side with the Dragon Palace!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Xiao Yu seemed to have thought of this day as well. Without much hesitation, she said directly.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian revealed a smile. “Brother-in-law, when you enter the Dragon Pool later, I will teach you the cultivation method of the wind god Dragon!”

Feng Lingtian revealed an excited expression and nodded quickly.

Xiao Yu’s willingness to enter the extraordinary continent with him was somewhat out of his expectations. However, this was the most perfect thing.

Time passed day by day as batches of members of the Dragon Palace entered the Dragon Pool.

The dragon blood was being consumed rapidly.

“Roar Roar Roar, Buzz Buzz Buzz Buzz!”

A week after Wang Xian returned to the Dragon Palace, a roar that sounded like the end of the world was heard from the sky above the Dragon Palace.

The roar was extremely loud and it even spread across a radius of several thousand kilometers.

All the humans who heard the roar had a look of shock in their eyes.

“A Kun that is half a step into the void interpretation realm. With such power, it shouldn’t be a problem for it to kill a first level void interpretation realm expert.”

Looking at Xiao Lan who was more than a thousand meters in the sky above the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian felt his scalp tingling.

After consuming a large amount of dragon blood, including the corpse of the leader of the Blood Barbaric Demon Beast, its strength had directly increased to half a step into the void interpretation realm.

It was invincible!

“Dragon King, we have already chosen the location of the Dragon Palace!”

At this time, Prime Minister GUI came to report.

“Good, then get ready to descend to the extraordinary continent!”
