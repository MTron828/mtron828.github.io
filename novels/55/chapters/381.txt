Chapter 382: Total Annihilation

“So powerful! So powerful!”

“A person in a single strike. All of them were killed in a single strike. How could Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown have such insane strength?”

“He’s just twenty and yet ranked ninth on the Miracle Doctors Chart and has the strength that easily kills Inborn experts. What kinds of insane talents does he have to reach this level?”

Amidst the Sky Mountains, the surrounding crowd looked in shock.

A young man with a longsword in his hand was slaughtering the entire Nine Lotus Sect without reservation.

A person in a single strike. All the experts from the Nine Lotus Sect, including Inborn level experts, were all falling with a single strike.

“His strength is incredible!”

When the Sect Leader of the Nine Lotus Sect saw the experts in his sect being killed easily, he felt a chill running down his spine. Staring coldly at Wang Xian, he clenched his fist tightly.

“How dare you kill our people from the Nine Lotus Sect. Die now!”

Seeing Elders and attendants of the Nine Lotus Sect falling one after another, the Sect Leader of the Nine Lotus Sect was burning with anger. He moved and attacked Wang Xian directly.

The aura around him was no inferior to Mo Yuan. As he moved his palm, his aura had the momentum of a deluge and swept towards Wang Xian.

The surrounding martial artists, who weren’t at the Inborn Realm, immediately retreated.

“What an incredible Miracle Doctor! He has hidden his strength too well previously. A master alchemist, a Miracle Doctor and now he’s also an Inborn expert!”

Elder Feng stood by the side and witnessed the horrifying acts of Wang Xian. He couldn’t help but feel a chilling sensation as his expression turned exceptionally bitter.

“For a person like him, even if we can’t become friends, we can never become his enemies. Otherwise...”

Elder Feng clenched his fist tightly. A razor-sharp weapon that resembled a surgical knife appeared in his hand.

“We must definitely kill him. Otherwise, there will be countless troubles in the future!”

Ruthlessness gleamed in the eyes of Elder Feng.

If Miracle Doctor Wang were just a master alchemist or a Miracle Doctor, he wouldn’t be wary of him at all.

As an Elder of the Sacred Followers Guild, a Miracle Doctor or an alchemist wouldn’t concern him, even if this person was a genius.

However, if the same person possessed insane strength, he couldn’t just overlook him any further.

In the Underworld, strength dictated everything!

An insanely talented young man like him would likely have an eighty percent chance of entering the Dan Realm in the future. He could never allow a person like him to get stronger.

“Kill!” Elder Feng shouted coldly. Horrifying aura erupted from his body. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The Miracle Doctors around him followed closely behind him. In their hands, they had identical surgical knives.

“The Elders of the Sacred Followers Guild are taking actions!”

“Oh gosh? Why would the Sacred Followers Guild wants this young man dead?”

“That Miracle Doctor Wang crippled the disciple of the Elder in the Sacred Followers Guild. It’s only natural that they want to kill him. In fact, the entire Sacred Followers Guild might just attack him!”

When the surrounding crowd saw Elder Feng attack, they were shocked.

Wang Xian’s eyes were chillingly cold. Seeing Fang Huazi’s master and the Sect Leader of the Nine Lotus Sect approaching him, he waved his arm.

A dazzling golden glow emanated from Zhan Lu.

“That sword is emanating dazzling golden light?”

“Why am I feeling the treasured sword in my hands trembling violently? What is happening?”

“Inborn Spiritual Weapon! That sword is an Inborn Spiritual Weapon!”

The crowd exclaimed and stared fervently at Zhan Lu in Wang Xian’s hand.

“Inborn Spiritual Weapon. It’s no surprise why it’s so sharp and could kill an Inborn expert in a single strike!”

The Sect Leader of the Nine Lotus Sect gritted his teeth and shouted, “Die!”

A huge, five-meter palm struck towards Wang Xian with the momentum of a deluge.

Boom!

“How dare you injure my disciple! Today, I’m going to annihilate you!”

Elder Feng pierced his weapon towards Wang Xian coldly.

On the weapon, a chilling light gathered into a point and seemed capable of shooting through all objects.

Hehe!

Seeing over ten people attacking him from all directions at the same time, Wang Xian plunged Zhan Lu into the ground coldly.

Bzz bzz bzz!

At that instant, the surrounding crowd felt as though they were being dragged into a dazzling gold world.

Rays of golden light coalesced into sharp weapons and attacked in all directions from Wang Xian within a radius of twenty meters.

“What? This is a Sword Domain?”

Elder Feng, the Sect Leader of the Nine Lotus Sect, and the rest, who were charging towards Wang Xian, were in shock to notice the razor-sharp weapons that appeared from nowhere.

“That’s a powerful sword, but you will still die!”

The Sect Leader of Nine Lotus Sect drew a circle around him with his palm. The next instant, a water screen appeared around him.

The water screen was just like taichi as it rotated gradually around him.

Using minimal force, he swept aside the razor-sharp swords.

Ha!

Elder Feng let out a loud cry. At the same time, metallic aura emanated from him and surrounded him completely.

It was as though he had turned into a golden Vajra. As the sword energies fell on him, sounds of metal clashing resounded.

“This is really glamorous and cool!”

Wang Xian looked around him. With the energy of the Metal Divine Dragon, he incited the razor-sharp edge of Zhan Lu and coalesced them into countless razor-sharp sword energies. After which, he attacked in all directions within a twenty meters radius around him.

At that instant, he felt as though he was controlling thousands and thousands of swords.

“However, you guys are still going to die!”

Wang Xian placed his hand on Zhan Lu and smiled gently as he gripped it.

“Die!”

At this instant, the palm of the Sect Leader of the Nine Lotus Sect was already above Wang Xian’s head. With a gruesome expression, he smashed down heavily.

However, the golden light on Zhan Lu shone even brighter. Strong and dazzling golden rays caused everyone to tear.

Everyone in the surrounding crowd had now looked away as a painful sensation cruised in their eyes.

Roar!

Suddenly, everyone heard a horrifying roar.

The golden rays coalesced into a five-meter-long divine dragon that met the palm of the Sect Leader of Nine Lotus Sect directly.

The Metal Divine dragon emanated bone piercing rays. He opened his huge jaws and attacked the Sect Leader of the Nine Lotus Sect directly.

“What?”

The Sect Leader of the Nine Lotus Sect was horrified to see Wang Xian’s head turning into a horrifying divine dragon.

Retracting his palm, the taichi water screen around him emitted strong blue light and circulated even quicker.

Bam!

The Metal Divine Dragon swung its claws towards the water screen directly.

Bam!

Dreadful energy of the Metal Dragon split the defense of the Sect Leader of Nine Lotus Sect easily and the claws struck heavily into his body.

Fresh blood spattered everywhere.

Bam!

Having knocked the Sect Leader of the Nine Lotus Sect down in a single strike, Wang Xian swung his tail towards Elder Feng and the rest.

Boom!

Strong and powerful dragon energy landed on the bodies of the surrounding people.

“What?”

Elder Feng was greatly shocked and immediately pierced the razor-sharp weapon in his hand towards the dragon tail.

Dang!

What he heard was the sounds of metal clashing. Following which, tremendous force fell on him.

Boom!

As the dragon tail swept across, all the people fell to the ground.

Whoosh!

The divine dragon disappeared and countless long metallic sword energies appeared once again.

Swoosh swoosh swoosh swoosh!

Countless sword energies struck towards the people on the ground.

Argh!

Pitiful cries filled the atmosphere as the surrounding crowd felt their hearts palpitating violently.
