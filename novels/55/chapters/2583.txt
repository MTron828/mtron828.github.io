2584 2,584 abyss continent

Boom! Boom! Boom

In the sky, after a continuous battle of half an hour, Wang Xian finally managed to kill all three immortal god King level seven Abyss species!

“Are there any injuries?”

He wiped the blood off his arm and asked the members of the Dragon Palace around him!

“Dragon King, there are no injuries this time!”

Ao he replied!

“This abyss species is rather fierce, Dragon King. I have to go all out to deal with it alone!”

Ao Qitian said to Wang Xian!

“It is indeed a little powerful. I feel that it is stronger than human powerhouses of the same level!”

Wang Xian nodded. Of course, this was also because ao Qitian and the rest were fighting above their level!

If Ao Qitian and the rest had a level seven immortal king, they could easily kill these abyssal seeds!

“According to the A.I. , the kings among the abyssal seeds can fight above their level. It seems to be very likely!”

Wang Xian said!

Ao Qitian and the rest nodded in agreement!

“Our strength is still a little weak!”

He mumbled!

Three level seven immortal king abyssal seeds were already so difficult to fight against. If four of them appeared, it would be even more difficult for them to kill them!

Furthermore, Wang Xian felt that there should be a stronger abyssal seed guarding that huge mountain!

Once that kind of existence was attracted over, they could only flee in Panic!

“If I can convert the abyssal seed in my hands into resources, I can have another six to seven people with the combat strength of A Level Seven Immortal King!”

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment!

“Let’s try to attract it again!”

Wang Xian thought for a moment and brought ao Qitian and the rest to another location!

This time, they were about 200 million kilometers away from the giant mountain. They took out their dragon blood and started to wait there! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Roar!”

“Woo Woo Woo!”

Roars were heard more than ten minutes later. Wang Xian looked over!

“There are three immortal king level seven abyss seeds again. Get Ready!”

When Wang Xian saw that there were three more, his eyes sparkled as he ordered all the members of the Dragon Palace!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

All the members waited quietly!

“Kill!”

When the abyssal seeds approached, Wang Xian and the rest instantly attacked!

“Boom!”

In an instant, the terrifying sounds of battle rang out. Waves of law energy spread out in all directions!

Wang Xian’s body moved and immediately transformed into the form of a divine dragon. He unleashed a violent attack!

Four against three, Ao Yao was still hiding in the void, preparing for a fatal attack!

As long as they killed one of them, their battle would be much easier!

However, Wang Xian and the rest were not as lucky this time!

When they were fighting, the terrifying aftershock once again attracted the attention of many abyss seeds in the huge peak!

Five minutes later, another group of Abyss seeds flew over. There were four abyss seeds in the lead!

“Oh no!”

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly when he saw these four immortal king abyssal seeds!

“Run!”

Without any hesitation, he shouted at all the members of the Dragon Palace!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Without any hesitation, they turned around and fled!

Wang Xian and the rest were very fast. Some of the members could not keep up, so he immediately kept them into the mother nest!

Ten minutes later, they broke away from the pursuit of the abyssal seeds. Wang Xian heaved a sigh of relief and stopped moving!

“Your strength is still a little weak!”

He said indifferently!

“Dragon King, why don’t we return to the Dragon Palace? The next time we come back, we have about ten immortal king level seven combat strength. It shouldn’t be a problem for us to come back here again!”

Ao Qitian suggested from the side!

...

“It will take a month to go to the Dragon Palace to upgrade our strength!”

Wang Xian shook his head slightly. “Let’s go to the vicinity of the Demon Island!”

He thought for a while and decided!

The Demon Island was actually a galaxy. It was one of the three small island galaxies in the Imperial Star Field. Its area was more than 10,000 times that of the Southern Star Field!

The Demon Island belonged to the central region of the Imperial Star Field!

The reason why it was called the Demon Island was because it was too close to the Abyss!

At the place where the Demon Island was close to the Abyss, an abyss entrance suddenly appeared and devoured the entire planet!

If one was strong, one could escape immediately. If one was unlucky and weak, one might be devoured by the abyss seed at the entrance of the Abyss!

Wang Xian was prepared to make a trip there and exchange the abyss seed law crystal in his hand for elixirs!

As long as he exchanged it for medicinal pills, he would be able to immediately increase the strength of the members of the Dragon Palace around him!

After all, he could just directly pass the dragon energy to them after devouring it!

...

This was the fastest way to increase his strength. If it was fast, he would be able to do it in a few days!

“I’ll make a trip there and take a look. I have to go there in the future too!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he immediately flew towards the exit!

When the Dragon King and the rest were about to reach the exit, they were on the land plate at the entrance!

Over 40 undying god King Warriors from the Sky Mountain Sword sect were in a manor!

After the anonymous information on the AI, along with the Dragon Palace Dragon King and the rest being so coincidental, the Sky Mountain Sword sect sword Emperor had sent an elder to look for the Dragon King’s traces!

They weren’t here to ambush the Dragon King and the rest, but to verify the answer!

“Reporting to Elder, according to the news we received, the Dragon King and the rest have come out of the Abyss and are flying towards the Demon Island!”

A message was transmitted to the manor!

“Have they come out?”

One figure after another instantly arrived in the manor’s Hall. They looked at the disciples who had come to report!

“Yes Elder, the Dragon King and the others are rushing towards the demon island at high speed. We can’t catch up with them at our speed!”

The member reported!

“Let’s go, we’ll go there immediately!”

The leader of the elders said immediately. With a wave of his arm, a huge crimson-gold sword appeared in front of him!

“Let’s go after the Heaven Alliance sword immediately!”

The group immediately boarded the crimson-gold Heaven Alliance sword and chased after the Demon Island at a high speed!

“We’ll need a day to fly to a relatively prosperous market. We should be able to exchange the abyss seed law crystals in our hands for elixirs there!”

Wang Xian looked at the map on the AI and flew quickly!

His speed was very fast as he shuttled through the starry sky!

Wang Xian could occasionally see a huge entrance to the abyss in front of the Void!

He even encountered an abyss seed in the void and killed it immediately!

“I’m here. It’s right in front of me!”

A day later, Wang Xian saw a huge land plate. This land plate was comparable to the Tianze continent!

However, underneath the land plate, it looked extremely smooth!

“The Abyss Continent!”

Wang Xian mumbled. According to the records on the AI, this continent used to be a planet. However, half of it was devoured by the Abyss and was attacked by the abyss seeds. It became a continent today!

This was a relatively prosperous continent at the border of the Demon Island!

About 1,000 kilometers away from this continent, there was an extremely huge entrance to the abyss!
