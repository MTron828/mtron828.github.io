“The disciples of our two races can not die for nothing! ”

The Emperor of Phoenix stared coldly at Wang Xian and said coldly, “The

Dragon Palace must pay the price. ”

“Other people, the one who died was not a disciple of your race. This Dragon King is powerful, but he does not have the strength yet. Let My Phoenix race prevent this from happening. ”

As the Emperor of the Phoenix spoke, his gaze swept past the other Heavenly Yuan creation realm experts!

“It’s impossible to just let this go. Someone has to pay the price for our disciple’s death! ”

The Emperor of the Angels also spoke with a cold expression!

When the other six heavenly Yuan creation realm experts heard their words, they slightly furrowed their brows.

“Then Dragon King, take out some compensation. The Phoenix clan and the

Angel clan are much stronger than all of you. If this continues, it won’t be of any benefit to Your Dragon Palace! ”

“Take out some treasures to compensate us and end this enmity. In the future, we will deal with the arrival of the calamity together! ”

The Hetian Saint looked at Wang Xian and said!

Saint Hetian, enmity is not so easy to end. If it were not for the betrayal of the

Angel clan, the Divine Dragon Clan would not have perished! ”

When Wang Xian heard the words of the Emperor of Phoenix and the Emperor of Angels, a cold look appeared on his face!

He looked at the Hetian saint who was trying to resolve this grudge and spoke indifferently!

“HMM?”

His words shocked all the powerful disciples of the peak races around when they heard it!

The eyes of a few of the Heaven’s origin destinies also flickered slightly!

“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, do you know what you are talking about?”

When the Emperor of Phoenix heard Wang Xian’s words, a terrifying killing intent burst out from his eyes. A terrifying aura surged toward Wang Xian directly!

“Hehe! ”

Wang Xian smiled coldly and stared at the Emperor of Phoenix, he narrowed his eyes slightly and said, “Emperor of Phoenix, let me tell you clearly. The grudge between the angel race can be settled. However, the grudge between your Phoenix race and My Divine Dragon race can not be resolved. You are all clear about what your Phoenix race has done!”

“Hahaha, I am naturally clear about what my Phoenix race has done. Why? Do you still want to exterminate my Phoenix Race? For the sake of the overall situation of the nine-origin universe, I can let you off the hook for the sake of the other few heaven-origin destinies. However, you actually want to take an inch and take a mile. Do you really think that I don’t dare to kill you?” The Emperor of the Phoenix’s aura began to climb up!

The Aura belonging to the Heavenly Kismet gushed out in all directions!

The expressions of the disciples below the Heavenly Kismet changed drastically when they felt this scene!

Their faces were extremely pale.

Those at the supremacy level were trembling as they retreated continuously!

This was even under the influence of the other Heavenly Kismet Experts!

The Emperor of angels was staring at this scene with a thoughtful expression on his face!

This situation obviously involved the destruction of the Divine Dragon Clan!

There was obviously something going on behind the scenes!

The Dragon Palace now possessed the Heavenly Yuan creator realm!

If their Angel clan joined in, they wouldn’t gain anything!

“Dragon King, if you want to settle the grudge with My Angel clan, give me a satisfactory answer! ”

The Emperor of angels stared at Wang Xian and said coldly, “If this result is not satisfactory, you will bear the consequences yourself! ”

“The entire nine-origin universe knows about the matter between your Angel clan and My Dragon Palace. It is your Angel clan that is courting death. The so-called settling of the grudge means that it is over. This is my answer to you!

Wang Xian replied directly when he heard the Emperor of Angels ‘Words!

The Emperor of Angels’face instantly turned gloomy as soon as he finished his sentence!

What did he mean?

Letting it go was a response to the angel race?

This was simply too arrogant!

He did not put his angel race in his eyes at all!

A hint of coldness and fury appeared in his eyes!

The other six powerhouses in the Heaven’s origin realm opened their mouths slightly when they heard Wang Xian’s words. A hint of shock appeared on their faces as well!

What the F * ck?

What was the meaning of this?

Although the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace had reached the Heaven’s origin manifestation stage!

However, the Angel clan and the Phoenix Clan had two heaven’s origin manifestation stage powerhouses.

Furthermore, they were both veteran Heaven’s origin manifestation stage powerhouses.

If they were to really fight, the possibility of destroying the Dragon Palace was still very high!

The problem that could be solved by just paying a little of the resources was now going to be decided by the two peak races? “Hiss, this… The Dragon King is so strong! ”

“Isn’t this too strong? This…”

“The Dragon King is so arrogant that he doesn’t care about any of the Heavenly Yuan’s fortunes. is the Dragon King going to start a war with the angel race and the Phoenix Race?”

All the powerful disciples in the surrounding area were shocked when they saw this scene!

The Dragon King was too arrogant!

He was simply too ferocious!

Was he going to start a battle directly?

“Hehe, Alright, Alright. It’s been a long time since I’ve had any activity. Let’s have a big battle then!”

The Emperor of angels smiled coldly. His hands slowly clenched the angel sword in his hands!

The angel sword was emitting a radiance!

Around him, the shadows of Angels were flickering!

“You are really courting death and no one can stop you! ”

The Emperor of Phoenix was also staring at Wang Xian with murderous intent. He flapped his wings slightly!

The red clouds above his head seemed to be brewing a terrifying might!

“Everyone, we have already given him a choice. He has chosen to die. If we do not fulfill his wish, he will think that our Phoenix and Angel Race are afraid of him. Today, in this nine-origin universe, there is no us with their Dragon palace !

“Retreat!”

The emperor of Phoenix swept his gaze across the six powerhouses in the Heaven’s origin blessed realm and spoke coldly!

The Hetian Saint, the elven empress, and the rest frowned when they saw this scene!

“Dragon King, there’s no need for that.”

The Elven empress looked at Wang Xian, sighed, and spoke!

The situation before her was clearly disadvantageous to the Dragon Palace!

She didn’t understand why Wang Xian still wanted to make a move.

At the beginning, they could still persuade him.

But at this stage, they had a way out, but Wang Xian had broken it.

In that case, they could no longer persuade the emperor of the Phoenix and the Emperor of the Angels.

All the powerful disciples in the surrounding nine-origin universe were also staring at this scene!

“Senior elven queen, everyone in the nine-origin universe knows the cause of the enmity between the Dragon Palace and the Angel Race of the Phoenix race.

So what if they are two peak races?”

Wang Xian looked at the elven empress and said!

“So what if they are two peak races? So what if they are two Heaven’s origin destinies? What does our Dragon Palace have to fear?”

Just as Wang Xian finished his sentence!

From the back, the Kylin bull flew over slowly. He flew to a step behind Wang Xian.

Boom

His body trembled and transformed into his own body!

At the same time, the aura that belonged to the Heaven’s origin destinies charged towards the Emperor of angels and the Emperor of Phoenix!Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com
