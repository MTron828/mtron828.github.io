Chapter 1260: 1261, the unrivaled king Beast of heaven

Translator: 5496903

The King Beast of the demon race, King Beast of Heaven, was the title for the strongest demon beast under the age of 50.

At the same time, it was also the title for the two Demon Beast Kings in the human-demon graveyard.

One was the demon Lin King Beast Race, and the other was the Blood Barbarian Demon Beast King race.

These two demon beast races were the most powerful existences in the human-demon graveyard.

Their bloodlines had reached the sixth level of the profound void tier.

There had never been a demon beast slaughtering the young generation of humans in the training grounds before, and they had even blocked the entrance to the training grounds.

This was simply the greatest humiliation to the humans.

The hiring association had directly taken out a reward of 100,000 spirit liquid, making the blood flow empire want to make a move. They did not hesitate to consume a large amount of spirit liquid and blood essence to use the descending technique.

They even took out a second level void interpretation killing formation.

This was also the ultimate killing formation that a half-step void interpretation expert could control.

“Follow me in and clean up all the demonic beasts in the training grounds!”

The blood flow empire’s void interpretation expert, Tang Lingwen, revealed a proud expression. His gaze looked towards the entrance of the training grounds, and his eyes flickered with a luster.

The so-called King Beast of the demon race, the Chosen King Beast, in his opinion, was nothing more than this.

His strength was the most powerful existence in the blood flow empire’s cave rank 1. Moreover, in order to obtain even greater rewards this time, he wore a powerful set of equipment.

He was confident that he could kill a demon beast of the profound void tier within ten moves!

“Uncle Thirteen, Let’s Go!”

Tang Feng, Tang Yuan, and the others also revealed confident expressions on their faces!

“Let’s Go!”

Tang lingwen nodded and directly walked into the trial grounds.

“Weng!”

After walking to the entrance of the trial grounds, Tang Lingwen’s body wasn’t obstructed by the array formation and directly entered!

“If we really enter, with Senior’s strength, wouldn’t he be invincible in the trial grounds?”

“Absolutely invincible. Haha, this time, that group of damnable demonic beasts will have to pay a heavy price!”

“It’s best if senior Tang Lingwen can head directly to the entrance of the Demonic Beasts clan. Kill all the demonic beasts that step into the training ground. Haha!”

Behind them, everyone was excited when they saw Tang Lingwen really entering the training ground.

“Let’s go, let’s follow him in!”

The group of people walked in. Wang Xian hesitated for a moment before following them in.

There were at least tens of thousands of people who followed them in.

“Little B * stard, come here and face your death!”

When Wang Xian had just passed through the thousand-meter passage, a majestic roar came from the front. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Wang Xian moved his body and flew forward. When he looked over, a look of astonishment appeared in his eyes.

In the sky in front of him, there was a seven to eight-meter-tall demonic beast that looked like a horse. Its entire body was covered in blood-red scales. It had two huge curved horns and a tail that was burning with flames.

Its body exuded a powerful aura. The entire demonic beast looked extremely domineering.

There were a few other demonic beasts that looked exactly the same around this demonic beast. However, they were about twice as small as it.

Under Wang Xian’s astonished gaze, the demonic beast slowly stood up. The blood-red scales on its body twisted and claws grew out one by one. It looked similar to a human.

However, its body was still seven to eight meters in size. Its cold eyes were staring at the area in front of it.

In front of the entrance of the training ground, Tang Lingwen was floating proudly in the sky. Tang Feng and the rest followed behind him.

“Your lifespan is obviously over fifty years old. How did you enter this place?”

The gigantic demonic Lin spoke in human language and stared at Tang Lingwen with flickering eyes.

“Haha, Beast, the Reason I came to the training ground is to slaughter you, this reckless beast!”

“Very soon, the training ground will become a nightmare for your demonic beast clan!”

Tang Lingwen laughed loudly as he looked down at the demonic Lin in front of him. His aura slowly spread out as a blood-red long blade appeared in his hand.

“Cunning humans, you actually used a secret technique to enter the training ground. Damn it! Damn it!”

Behind them, more than ten demonic beasts coldly stared at Tang Lingwen and the tens of thousands of humans behind him.

“Haha, the ones who deserve to die are you beasts!”

“Senior, kill them and avenge us humans!”

“Kill these damn beasts!”

Behind them, a group of humans looked at the dozen demonic beasts in front of them and roared furiously.

“Beast, I will definitely kill you within ten moves!”

Tang Lingwen was worried that the group of demonic beasts would escape. His body moved, and his blood-red longsword directly slashed towards the insightful void level demonic Lin.

“HM? Kill me within ten moves?”

The Demonic Lin King Beast sensed the dark attribute blade light that was attacking it, and a trace of disdain flashed in its eyes.

It waved its arm, and a terrifying flame directly met the blade light.

“Boom!”

The Dark Blade Ray collided with the terrifying flames, emitting an intense explosion.

“Eh? You Little Bastard can actually block my attack? Not Bad, not bad!”

Tang Lingwen saw that his blade ray had been blocked, and a trace of astonishment appeared on his face.

However, he did not take it to heart, and a trace of a cold smile appeared on his face. “Take another one of my moves!”

“Bloodthirsty Wolf Soul!”

He let out a low roar, and his blood-red long blade shook.

A 100-meter long black wolf opened its huge mouth and attacked the demonic Lin King Beast.

Bloodthirsty Wolf Soul, Tang Lingwen’s divine ability attack.

“Roar Roar!”

The Demonic Lin King Beast opened its huge bloody mouth and let out a loud roar. A flaming demonic beast that looked exactly like it directly attacked the 100-meter long bloodthirsty Wolf Soul.

“Boom!”

The two terrifying attacks collided once again.

“What?”

However, what shocked Tang Lingwen was that the bloodthirsty wolf soul actually slowly dissipated under the attack of the Demonic Beast’s flames.

The Demonic Beast’s flames still had half of its power left and were still attacking him.

“Good, good. I didn’t expect that a beast like you still had some strength!”

Tang Lingwen’s expression changed slightly. He waved the long saber in his hand and directly split the demonic beast in front of him. He roared with a gloomy face.

“Haha, Damn Human, didn’t you say you wanted to kill me in ten moves?”

The Demonic Lin King Beast’s eyes revealed a mocking expression as it roared loudly.

“Hiss, this demonic Lin King Beast’s strength is so strong. It can actually block senior Tang Lingwen’s Attack!”

“Such powerful strength!”

The tens of thousands of people at the back watched Tang Lingwen and the Demonic Beast’s battle with shocked expressions on their faces.

“Humph, Beast, today, you must die!”

“Attack!”

Tang Lingwen heard the voice from the back and felt greatly embarrassed. He roared angrily, “Chaotic blade slash!”

“Array formation, activate!”

At this time, Tang Feng’s voice also sounded. The ten or so young men around him moved their arms.

The second level void interpretation killing array instantly enveloped the ten or so demonic beasts.

“Haha, Die!”

Tang Feng and the others revealed excited expressions as they roared loudly.

“From today onwards, the training grounds Will Be Your Demonic Beast Clan’s Nightmare!”

“Because, I’ve descended!”

Tang lingwen howled wildly, and terrifying dark energy churned, descending like a demon king!
