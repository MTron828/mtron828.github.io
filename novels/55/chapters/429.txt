Chapter 430: Everything Settled

“Laozu!”

“Laozu!”

“Father!”

...

At approximately 3-4 am, no one in the entire Xiao Clan was asleep.

In the Sacred Mountain of the Xiao Clan, all the members of the Xiao Clan had gathered. Even ten-year-old kids were present.

When a bald old man flew in, all the members of the Xiao Clan stood up and greeted the old man respectfully.

The bald old man was still reflecting some light, even at night, off his head and had extremely thick eyebrows. Overall, he looked rather comical.

However, everyone in the Xiao Clan was shivering in fear when facing of this old man.

A long time ago, two men had been widely addressed as the Explosive Duo. At that time, they were both exceptionally famous.

One of them was the Laozu of the Sui Clan, Sui Huang, and the other was the Laozu of the Xiao Clan, Xiao Quanshan.

Both of them were fire attribute cultivators and had explosive tempers. Subsequently, Sui Huang started refining elixir pills which wore away his fiery temper.

At that time, members of the Sui Clan recalled Sui Huang’s roars reverberating throughout the entire clan when he first started refining elixir pills. Subsequently, refining elixir pills had honed his temper.

This made the members of the Xiao Clan extremely envious. Not only did their Laozu’s temper not improve, but it got even worse.

Once, two disciples of the Xiao Clan committed illegal acts. Their Laozu slaughtered both of them before the entire clan without reserve.

Everyone was afraid of his fiery temper!

“Speak! What’s this all about?”

The old man stopped in the middle. He didn’t sit down and simply looked across the crowd as he demanded coldly.

“Laozu, Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown led fifty Inborn experts to our Sacred Clan at night–”

“Tell me about Xiao Fan first!” Xiao Quanshan interrupted the clan leader of the Xiao Clan loudly.

“Yes, yes!”

The clan leader of the Xiao Clan wiped off the cold sweat on his forehead while recollecting the incident. “The cause of this matter is because a sixth-generation disciple of Xiao Clan married the daughter of the clan leader of the Liang Family. Subsequently, he had another woman outside with a boy and a girl. The boy had exceptional talents and was brought back to the Xiao Clan. He was badly treated by the daughter of the clan leader of the Liang Family. Moreover, she attempted to assassinate them with poison. Subsequently, the three of them fled and were pursued by assassins hired by the daughter of the clan leader of the Liang Family. After a year of being pursued, the mother of the boy and girl was killed. In the end, the boy and girl were rescued by Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown, who took the boy in as his disciple. They were here today to seek revenge! Among those who oppressed the mother and two kids, there were two fifth-generation Elders!”

“I don’t care how many women or kids you guys have outside the clan. I’m asking you why there are intentional killings and oppression within the Xiao Clan? Tell me!”

When Xiao Quanshan heard the explanation of the clan leader of Xiao Clan, he chided loudly. He looked across every single person before him and remarked, “This even involves the management of the Xiao Clan. Are you guys courting death?”

Xiao Quanshan berated the members of the Xiao Clan. “As for you, you can stop being the clan leader. Our Xiao Clan has the least members among the three main Sacred Clans in Shang Jing and yet you can’t even deal with this appropriately!”

The clan leader of the Xiao Clan paled and nodded his head immediately. “Yes, Laozu!”

“Who else was involved in this matter? All those who know about this, step forward now!”

Xiao Quanshan took a glance at the clan leader of the Xiao Clan before berating once again. “I don’t believe that only those two trash that were killed knew about this and condoned the oppression. You better step forward now. If you don’t, don’t blame me for not being courteous if I learn otherwise in the future!”

Below him, some members of the Xiao Clan had turned as pale as chalk. Six women and five old men stepped forward bitterly.

“Tsk! Quite a few of you!”

Xiao Quanshan snorted, “The imprisonment area of the Sacred Mountain happens to be empty. Every single one of you shall reflect on what you’ve done in it for a year!”

The group who stepped forward shivered and cold sweat had broken out on their foreheads.

“How old is that Xiao Ran now?” Xiao Quanshan diverted the subject and asked.

“Laozu, Xiao Ran is currently fifteen years and eight months old. He possesses a Heavenly Flame and an Inborn Spiritual Weapon!” replied the clan leader of the Xiao Clan immediately.

When he heard about Xiao Ran’s age, Xiao Quanshan was shocked too.

He was definitely the only fifteen-year-old Inborn expert throughout history.

“Reaching the Inborn Realm at the age of fifteen!” Excitement gleamed in the eyes of Xiao Quanshan. “He has close to a ninety percent chance of stepping into the Dan Realm in the future.”

“That Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown has likely invested huge resources into him to groom him into an Inborn expert. He even gave Xiao Ran a Heavenly Flame and Inborn Spiritual Weapon.”

“Damn! Our Xiao Clan finally gets a demon-like talent and yet he ends up going against us. All of you are useless.”

“Damn! Get twenty guys to come with me to invite that kid back to our clan. We can’t let this type of demon-like talent walk off!” Xiao Quanshan instructed the crowd. Soon after, he moved and entered into the depths of the Sacred Mountain.

“All of you go get yourself prepared to welcome that kid back. When I die, a talented teenager like him could at least still protect our Xiao Clan for another hundred years!”

Xiao Quanshan’s voice reverberated across. The next instant, all the members of the Xiao Clan started moving. No one dared to delay or slack off.

...

“Master, I want to become an expert. I want to be able to protect master in the future to repay this gratitude. I want to protect my sister.”

On the second day, Xiao Ran looked at Wang Xian and spoke seriously after returning from Shang Jing.

Wang Xian looked at him, smiled, sipped on a mouthful of tea and responded, “Alright.”

“Master, I wish to head out and roam the world myself.” Xiao Ran paused for a moment before continuing. “Now that my strength has reached the Inborn Realm, I wish to roam the world and achieve something for myself!”

Huh? Wang Xian was slightly surprised. He hesitated for a moment but still nodded his head. “You can choose your own path. The Underworld is scheming and perilous. If you encounter any issues, your master will seek revenge for you!”

“Rest assured, master. I’ll be careful!”

Xiao Ran gave Wang Xian a radiant smile. After a year of running, and after experiencing the incidents over the last few days, his mindset had changed substantially.

Even a twenty to thirty-year-old man might not be as mature as him.

Wang Xian looked at Xiao Ran and scrutinized him from head to toe once again.

His composure and determined gaze wasn’t something that belonged to one of his age and maturity!

As long as he did not die prematurely, he would definitely not be ordinary!

“Haha, is Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown in? I have long heard of the big name of Miracle Doctor Wang and I’m here to pay you a visit today!”

At this juncture, a rough voice came from outside the villa.

Wang Xian was taken aback and said to Xiao Ran, “Go take a look!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Yes, master!”

Xiao Ran nodded his head and headed towards the door of the villa. When he saw the bald old man standing before the door, he had his suspicions.

“Who are you? What matters do you have with my master?”

Cough cough!

The bald old man scrutinized Xiao Ran from top to bottom and was satisfied with what he saw. “You are a pretty good-looking kid. I have long heard about your master’s name and have brought presents to pay him a visit. Can you allow me in?”
