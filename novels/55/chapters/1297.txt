Chapter 1298: 1299 collided

On the back mountain of the entire Heavenly Sword Sect’s Island, everyone was stunned as they watched the two women clash head-on.

One was the blood flow empire’s princess, the proud daughter of the heavens on the prodigy roll.

The other was the mysterious and powerful Divine Wind Academy’s beautiful teacher, an expert at the profound void realm.

If one were to talk about background, it was naturally the blood flow empire’s Princess Tang Ling’er who was stronger.

However, Zhang Fengying’s dominance left everyone dumbfounded.

“What is the relationship between this beauty and that young man? To think that he offended Princess Tang Ling ‘er for him. This... if their relationship is average, I wouldn’t believe it at all!”

“Could it be that this beautiful teacher is also Wang Xian’s old lover? It’s possible. Otherwise, she wouldn’t protect him like this!”

Zhang Fengying, who was standing beside Wang Xian, had a glint in her eyes.

There were two situations where a woman could offend an organization that could not be provoked for a man. One of them was the relationship between a mother and a child or a relative.

The other was the relationship between a lover.

Obviously, they were most likely the latter.

Jiang Chuan’s face turned completely black when he saw Zhang Fengying protecting that guy so forcefully.

Then, he felt that his head was a little muddled.

This woman that he had spent so much effort to get, had actually sacrificed so much for someone else.

This made him feel like he was crowned a cuckold.

Although this was also his narcissistic coronation.

But it still made him feel extremely uncomfortable.

“You...”

Tang Ling ‘ER’s face instantly changed when she heard Zhang Fengying’s words. She felt his profound aura and her small face instantly turned red.

“Which family are you from?”

Slowly, Tang Ling ‘er’s expression turned cold. She stared at Zhang Fengying with murderous intent in her eyes.

“I don’t represent any power!”

Zhang Fengying replied coldly.

Wang Xian looked at Zhang Fengying in front of him and smiled.

“There are some things that Princess Tang Ling ‘er doesn’t understand. Please don’t make trouble without reason!”

He turned his gaze to Tang Ling ‘er and said faintly. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Princess Tang Ling ‘er, regarding the matters of your subordinates, I, Long Xiaotian, will give you an explanation in the future. I hope that you will give me some face. I will apologize to you here first!”

Long Xiaotian felt a little helpless when he saw Zhang Fengying and Wang Xian being so domineering. He apologized to Tang Ling ‘er.

Tang Ling ‘er stood there and her expression kept changing.

At this moment, the surroundings were silent. Even the powerhouses at the first or second level of the Seethrough realm remained silent when they saw this scene. They were watching silently from the side.

“Huh?”

At the edge, Tang Feng and Tang Yuan, who had just followed her in, raised their brows slightly when they saw their sister’s situation. A hint of coldness flashed in their eyes.

They looked at long Xiaotian and exchanged a glance.

“You guys go over there. How Dare You Bully Our Sister? Hehe!”

Tang Feng and Tang Yuan gestured to the group of young men beside them and said indifferently.

“Yes!”

The proud son of heaven beside them nodded. His eyes flickered as he walked straight over.

“Even if it’s only us, Princess Tang Ling ‘er, alone, the consequences are not something you can bear!”

“I advise you to do as the princess says. Apologize and nothing will happen. Otherwise, you will be making an enemy out of us!”

Just as the entire situation was in a stalemate, a young man’s voice was heard.

A few footsteps were heard. They raised their heads slightly and walked proudly behind Tang Ling ‘ER.

They came to Tang Ling ‘ER’s side and stood directly behind her. Their eyes were staring at Wang Xian, Zhang Fengying, and the rest. Their eyes were filled with coldness.

“These... are the heaven’s favorites on the Heaven’s favorites list. The other three have been on the heaven’s favorites list before. Oh My God!”

“That’s Hongshan. He used to be the second strongest heaven’s favorite on the Heaven’s favorites list. He’s already 60 years old now, but his strength has already reached the first level of the Seethrough Void Tier!”

“I knew it. Tang Ling ‘er didn’t come here by herself. How could Tang Feng, Tang Yuan, and the rest not help their little sister?”

“This is interesting. If they want to clash with Tang Ling ‘er, neither long Xiaotian nor that teacher from the Divine Wind Academy have the qualifications!”

“The five powerful geniuses on the prodigy roll, or those who have been on the prodigy roll, plus Tang Ling ‘er, this lineup is so grand that only the bloody imperial family can bring it out!”

When the crowd saw the group of prodigies walking over, their eyes flashed with shock.

Each and every one of these prodigies was famous. Now that they were all gathered together, it was even more shocking.

Tang Ling ‘er looked at the few prodigies who were following her brothers and her somewhat embarrassed expression slowly turned better.

She took a deep breath and stared coldly at Zhang Fengying.

At this moment, she no longer wanted to stand up for her seduction.

Instead, she wanted this woman to apologize to her.

“Now, it’s not just you who has to apologize to the members of the cherry blossom mercenary group.”

“You also have to apologize to me and loudly apologize until I Forgive You!”

Tang Ling ‘er extended her hand and pointed at Wang Xian and Zhang Fengying as she said coldly.

“With just the few heaven’s favorites behind you?”

Zhang Fengying looked at the few young men behind Tang Ling ‘er and raised his eyebrows slightly.

“What? Are we not qualified enough?”

Hong Shan, who was at the first level of the Seethrough realm, who was standing behind Tang Ling ‘er, stared at Zhang Fengying indifferently.

A trace of aura was locked onto Zhang Fengying’s body.

“Meow!”

When his aura was released, the ice fire civet cat standing on Tang Ling ‘ER’s shoulder let out a cry.

His red and blue eyes flickered with a demonic expression, and that trace of aura instantly collapsed.

The ice fire civet cat stared at Hongshan with a demonic gaze.

It was as if it was ready to kill him at any moment!

Hongshan’s pupils constricted slightly, and his face was filled with vigilance.

“Oh?”

Some of the experts around also noticed the unusual behavior of the ice fire civet cat on Zhang Fengying’s shoulder. All of them revealed astonished expressions.

“If we add in the strength behind us, are we still not qualified?”

A Heaven’s pride expert stared at Zhang Fengying and Wang Xian with a gloomy face.

“I’ll give you ten seconds. After ten seconds, if you can’t satisfy us, I’ll settle this in my own way!”

Tang Ling ‘er raised her head slightly and looked down at Wang Xian and Zhang Fengying.

“Sigh!”

Long Xiaotian saw this scene and looked at the two princes who were looking over from afar. He sighed slightly.

This matter was related to Tang Ling ‘ER’s face.

Tang Ling ‘ER’s face still had to be taken into consideration.

“Brother Wang Xian, Tang Ling ‘ER’s background is not something we can deal with. It’s better for us to give in!”

Long Xiaotian whispered to him.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. Zhang Fengying, who was at the side, wanted to say something. She patted her shoulder gently, indicating for her not to say anything.

He looked at Tang Ling ‘er and said, “I would like to see your solution!”

Such strong words came out of Wang Xian’s mouth!
