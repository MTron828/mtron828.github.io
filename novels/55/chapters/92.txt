Chapter 93: Get Out

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“It’s okay!”

Wang Xian shook his head to Manager Huang, who came in and checked on him. Then he turned to look at the middle-aged lady and her daughter. With a cold voice, he said, “The first-grade Restaurant is my restaurant. What’s wrong with my customers carrying a bag when they are dining in my restaurant? Tell me who forbid the bag to be carried here?”

“You know it very well yourself if your daughter is ill-mannered. She was spoilt by you. But I’m telling you this. You can pamper your daughter, but others will not! So, don’t boss people around. No one is giving in to you here. If you have a temper, I’ll beat you till your temper is gone.”

Wang Xian looked at Manager Huang impatiently and said, “Throw the three of them out. I get annoyed when I see them.”

“Yes, Director Wang!” Manager Huang nodded his head and looked at the three of them. In a cold tone, he said, “Please leave the First-grade Restaurant. Otherwise, we’ll chase you out personally.”

“You...”

The middle-aged couple was stunned with mixed expressions on their faces. They did not expect that the young man before him owned the First-grade Restaurant.

Isn’t he just a year-two student? How could he be the boss of the First-grade Restaurant?

However, the manager who was staring at them coldly wanted them to get out!

The middle-aged man had an embarrassing expression as he clenched his fist tightly.

Their daughter was shocked to witness this, and her facial expression changed dramatically.

“If you are not going out, don’t blame us for it.” Seeing that the three of them were keeping still, Manager Huang warned them again.

“Fine, you’re good!”

The middle-aged man stared at Wang Xian with a darkened expression as he headed out.

The lady was fuming with redness flushing to her cheeks. She glared at Wang Xian angrily as she pulled her daughter out of the restaurant. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The girl also stared at Wang Xian ferociously as she followed her parents.

“Never did I expect that this lad is the boss of the First-grade Restaurant...”

The middle-aged man walked out with a sullen look. His facial expression continued to change.

Given the current strength of the First-grade Restaurant, he could somewhat guess how influential the boss was. He was only running a construction business for a property company. Even though his status was not too low, he would not dare to provoke the First-grade Restaurant’s boss.

“Hur?” Just when the plump middle-aged man walked to the entrance, he saw a familiar figure at the door.

He stopped walking as an idea came to him. Immediately, he put up a smile and greeted him, “Director Sun, I wasn’t expecting to see you here!”

“Hey, Old Zhao, you’re here with your family? Have you eaten?” asked a man with a smile. He was in his thirties, and he was slightly taken aback when he looked at the middle-aged man.

“No, not...” the middle-aged man smiled awkwardly.

“I’m meeting a few business friends. Since all of us know each other, let’s have lunch together!” Director Sun smiled as he invited him.

“Director Sun, perhaps... perhaps you can help me out with one thing.” The middle-aged man looked towards Director Sun hopefully with cold radiance flashing in his eyes.

Director Sun and he were quite familiar with each other. To be exact, he was relying on the property developers under Director Sun for his livelihood.

Director Sun was working in the property developing company as high management with waters that ran deep.

His networking power was extensive as he got dozens of helpers at hand to settle those stubborn households who were reluctant to move.

Apart from that, Director Sun owned three to four nightclubs, bars, and KTV. Many people who were working in Rivertown had to lower themselves and address him as “Second Master Sun” respectfully.

Director Sun could almost call the shots in the Rivertown!

So what if he was the boss of the First-grade Restaurant when he could ask for help from Director Sun?

“Help? What is it about?” Director Sun looked at the middle-aged man, puzzled.

“Director Sun, just now the boss of the First-grade Restaurant threw us out of the restaurant. I hope you can settle this for me!” said the plump middle-aged man with a bitter face.

“The boss of the First-grade Restaurant?” Director Sun was slightly shocked as his expression darkened when he heard it. He looked at the middle-aged man with radiance flickering in his eyes. “Why did he chase you out?”

“This...This... Director Sun, this is a long story. That lad was rude, and he actually scolded my daughter. This is simply too much. Director Sun, I can’t swallow this down. Since you’re so formidable, I hope you can avenge me. I’ll repay you handsomely!” the middle-aged man said with a solemn face.

“You’re kidding your father!” Director Sun looked at the girl beside him and said slowly.

“What?” the middle-aged man asked puzzledly, hearing his weird remarks.

“It’s all right, wait for my news here., Director Sun said to the middle-aged man with a disdainful look in his eyes.

“Great!” When he heard Director Sun’s promise, sharp radiance filled his eyes. “Thank you, Director Sun, for avenging for me. Tomorrow night, I’ll treat you to a sumptuous dinner.”

“Okay.” Director Sun gave a gentle nod.

“Director Sun, please have your lunch. I shall not disturb you anymore.” The middle-aged man gave a polite smile as he spoke.

Director Sun nodded and entered the restaurant.

“Hubby, is this the formidable Director Sun that you mentioned?” The lady beside them overheard their conversation and asked with a pair of beaming eyes.

“Yes, he’s the one.” The middle-aged man revealed a thrilled expression. “Director Sun has promised that he would avenge for me... Hmph, a restaurant owner. No matter how famous his restaurant is, he can never outfight Director Sun.”

“Dad, you should get someone to bash that lad up. He’s too arrogant!” said the girl ruthlessly as she clenched her fist tight.

“That’s enough.” the middle-aged man looked at his daughter and frowned. “Can’t you stop throwing your temper around? With such a character, how can you make friends in school? I wanted to treat them to lunch so that your roommates could take care of you. Now, you ruined everything!”

“But, since Director Sun has agreed, that lad is either going to lose his arm or his leg!”

“Who wants them to take care of me? I’m not befriending them. Don’t meddle in my affairs, will you? And Dad, don’t let that arrogant fellow get away that easily!” The girl waved her hands impatiently.

“You imp...”

The middle-aged man walked out.

“What an ignorant fellow!” Director Sun turned and looked back at the family who just left with cold-looking eyes.

“But I have to thank this idiotic fellow!”

Director Sun raised his eyebrow and grinned as he looked inside the restaurant for Wang Xian.

“There!” His eyes brightened up as he walked to a table in the hall immediately.

He still remembered clearly how the young man had shouted at the banquet that night.

“You might want to ask if Qin Guohui dares to say this to me!”

Back then, everyone was shocked, including him.

In particular, Old Qin showed up and chased Second Master Qin out of the Qin Family. Not only this, but Old Qin even bowed and apologized to him.

That scene left a deep impression on him.

How formidable could this young man be, such that even Old Qin needed to bow and apologize to him?

He was only someone from high management under the ruling of Qin Family. It was not an exaggeration to say that he looked highly upon this young man.

Since there was a chance to fawn upon this young man, he must seize it for sure!
