Chapter 559: Art of Water Refining

Yong Chang City was the most prosperous central area and the only city in the Yong Chang world.

A total population of ten million lived in the city, along with the surrounding villages.

But many of them here were ordinary people.

Yong Chang City serviced three Immortal Sects.

After a long-time development, the city had become an ancient bustling city.

There were taverns, restaurants, weapon stores, forging workshops, and elixir stores for both ordinary and Martial Artists. You name it, they had it.

Inborn Spiritual Weapons were for sale, along with high-level elixir pills, which could be purchased with Spiritual Stones.

“Senior Brother Ao, I wonder...how long does it take for the Spiritual Energy in Yong Chang Cauldron to be depleted. Today, I saw the outside world. Looks interesting!”

“This isn’t a good thing for us. It’s the Age of Dharma Decline outside. The Spiritual Energy in Yong Chang will be reduced by two to three times then!”

“Our world is too small, and it’s so boring. The world outside is big. How interesting it would be if we could roam around in the Underworld!”

“Brother Nan, the Dan Realm experts in the Underworld can conquer a territory. Then, wouldn’t we be dominating the Underworld if we go out?”

“The Martial Artists in the outside world are trash. Oh, I heard some junior brothers mention that there’s an outstanding disciple who emerged from Mt. Fengyu. His name is the Dragon King, who knocked out eight mountain sects alone and promoted Mt. Fengyu’s ranking from nineteenth to eleventh.”

“Dragon King? Haha, the disciples are talking big nowadays. He’s at most a Dan Realm expert. Such a person is not in our league!”

Back at the top floor of a restaurant, there were five young men exchanging conversations with broad smiles.

A young man in the middle revealed a faint smile as he looked out the window as though there was nothing worth his attention.

In Da Hong Immortal Sect, all the experts had their own circles. Even with the appearance of the Dragon King today, they just chuckled and forgot about it.

As soon as Wang Xian returned to his residence at Mt. Fengyu, he picked up the manual of Da Hong Immortal Sect’s swordsmanship.

Illusory sword, water sword.

Following these up would be the Sword of Extreme Frost and Sword of Extreme Heat.

“Illusory sword, water sword, Sword of Extreme Frost, and Sword of Extreme Heat are just types of application using water energy. Water Tiers Blade is considered a Sword Technique. But other than that, there aren’t any other Sword or Battle techniques!”

Wang Xian read the content in the manual with brows furrowed.

I better head to the Scriptures Depository for the real battle techniques, and I must be quick. It would be better still if I could get some resources like Spiritual Grass or weapons!

“Wang Xian!” Just when he was in his thoughts, Mentor Yu called out to him.

Wang Xian looked up and saw Mentor Yu walking to him.

“Your strength surprised me!”

Radiance flickered in Mentor Yu’s eyes, who appeared slightly emotional.

Wang Xian smiled and said nothing. Since he arrived at this place, his words had reduced significantly. After all, he belonged to the outside world.

“You promoted Mt. Fengyu to eleventh place. This time, the resources for Mt. Fengyu will be greatly increased. Do you have anything you want? Anything that can help you in your cultivation?” asked Mentor Yu to Wang Xian, looking at him.

“I want to enter the Scriptures Depository!”

Wang Xian answered frankly. After a slight hesitation, he asked again, “Mentor Yu, does Yong Chang have any huge lakes around?”

“I have a token that allows access to the Scriptures Depository with me. Since I’m not using it, you can take it. We don’t have any huge lakes around here, just some small streams.”

Mentor Yu handed him a token.

“Hur?”

Wang Xian froze for a moment as he was startled, seeing the token.

“The ranking of a mountain sect determines how much resources the mentor can receive. Take this token, and you can enter the Scriptures Depository. The time remaining for your stay is around one day!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Mentor Yu continued to explain, “Next month, all of you will receive five hours of reading time in the Scriptures Depository. At the same time, you can enter the first story of the Scriptures Depository!”

Wang Xian nodded. “Thank you, Mentor Yu!”

“You’re welcome. This is what you deserve. You don’t have to hurry with the challenges of other mountain sects. Pace it according to your strength, and no casualties allowed!” Mentor Yu reminded Wang Xian.

Wang Xian nodded. “Mentor Yu, I would like to go to the Scriptures Depository and pick some battle techniques!”

“Okay, go on!”

Mentor Yu nodded with a smile as she watched him riding on his sword to the main peak.

The main peak was the most eye-catching one amongst peaks of Da Hong Immortal Sect.

Before the main peak was a thousand-meter-wide waterfall with several towering peaks surrounding it.

The Scriptures Depository was right beside the main peak. It was situated at the top of a big and tall building.

The building was about fifty meters tall, and looked extremely lofty.

Wang Xian rode his sword and came to the Scriptures Depository. He gazed around as soon as he arrived.

He saw disciples walking in with identity tokens in their hands. When Wang Xian came to the door, he handed the token to a middle-aged man beside him.

“Mentor’s token. You have 25 hours remaining in it. You can enter the second story, and the first story will not consume time in the token!”

Wang Xian nodded and entered.

The large number and myriad of books in the Scriptures Depository of Da Hong Immortal Sect really widened Wang Xian’s horizons.

In particular, the first story. However, there were not many books on cultivation, but rather, a variety of general knowledge books.

Thousands of people stayed put on the first story, but it was nothing to such a massive library.

“Oh, this is the map of Yong Chang world!”

Wang Xian walked over immediately when he saw a map in an eye-catching spot.

“Yong Chang City is huge!”

Wang Xian scanned the map and memorized the entire map.

After he surveyed the books around him, he went up to the second floor.

“An array! There’s a Protection Array on the second floor! Without the token, no one can enter here. If the token does not come with enough corresponding energy, access is prohibited too!” Wang Xian exclaimed in surprise. An Immortal Sect is, indeed, an Immortal Sect.

After he entered it, he noticed that the second floor was much smaller than the first story. However, a variety of secret cultivation manuals and guide books written by experts based on their experiences could be found over here.

“Battle techniques!” Wang Xian murmured as he swept his gaze around. There were a few hundred disciples on the second floor, looking down, reading their books with seriousness.

This place was different from the first story, as the time limit was exercised here. Nobody dared to waste any time at all.

“Path of Swords!”

“Path of Water Applications!”

“Art of Water Refining!”

Wang Xian hurriedly headed to the three distinct zones. But he went to the Art of Water Refining zone, instead of the Path of Swords zone.

“What’s the difference between Water Refining and Inferno Refining?”

With doubt in his eyes, Wang Xian immediately walked to it.

As soon as he saw the book on the Art of Water Refining, he quickly flipped it open and began reading.

“No alchemy furnace, forging table, hammer required. Only for refining elixir pills and Spiritual Weapons that are levels below thyself. This Art of Water Refining is so convenient!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were gleaming, as he had thought of a quick way to gain resources!
