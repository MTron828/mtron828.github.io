Translator: 549690339

Wang Xian chatted with Liu Lan and hopeless sky for a while.

After that, Wang Xian left the body of the Void Divine Dragon here and returned to the nine-origin universe.

This time, Wang Xian was prepared to hunt down a control-level Heaven’s origin creation. He had to be prepared.

He had to be fully prepared.

He was prepared to bring along the unicorn ox.

In addition, he had to call Tianci over.

Tianci’s strength was very strong, allowing him to exchange blows with a true heaven origin creation realm expert and gain some battle experience!

Within the six paths universe!

At the border of the water source and the grassland.

A huge tribe stood there!

Although this location was at the border of the two great treasure lands, the energy density here was not inferior to the center!

This was the Mu Li tribe.

On the left was the Nine River tribe.

On the right were many top tribes of the grassland.

Because divine providence was of the wood attribute.

It was better to cultivate here in the grassland.

Hence, the Mu Li tribe moved the entire tribe to the border between the grassland and the water source.

The Nine River Tribe also moved here directly because of Gong Cheng aiming and Divine Providence.

After all, this was a place where a heavenly Yuan creation realm expert was stationed.

It was naturally safer here, and there were many benefits.

When the top tribes of the prairie received this news, they also wanted to curry favor with TIANCI.

After all, Tianci was a wood element heavenly yuan creation realm expert. In terms of cultivation, he was relatively close to the large tribes of their prairie. The calamity was about to arrive, so it was naturally safer to follow a heavenly Yuan creation realm expert.

Although they had moved away from their own tribe, there were more benefits here.

Tianci naturally did not have any objections to the top tribes moving here.

He was originally of the wood element, so his attitude towards wood element cultivators was quite friendly.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

He even occasionally gave some guidance to the wood element disciples.

On this day, tianci, Mu Li Yin ‘er, and grandfather were discussing something in a study room.

All of a sudden, Tianci felt something! “Mother, grandfather, foster father is here!” Tianci raised his head and said to them!

“Oh? is the Dragon King Coming?”

Mu Litianci’s grandfather was slightly stunned and asked.

Tianci nodded. He took out his communication stone plate and sent a message!

Buzz

Soon, Wang Xian arrived above the Mu Li tribe.

Tianci sensed Wang Xian’s aura and flew over immediately!

“Foster Father! ”

Tianci shouted happily when he saw Wang Xian!

Okay!

Wang Xian looked at him and nodded his head. The two of them flew down. “Foster father, I can feel that the ancestral tree in your body seems to have matured completely!”

Tianci knew that the ancestral tree in Wang Xian ‘s body could also sense his aura.

“Yes, it’s a little ripe. Take this maternal fruit. ”

Wang Xian nodded his head and passed the maternal fruit to him.

It was more cost-effective to give the maternal fruit to a powerhouse in the Heaven’s origin realm.

It was too wasteful to use it in the ruler’s realm!

After all, in the ruler’s realm, even if one needed to cultivate again after resurrection, the resources required were also less!

“It’s a revival-type fruit, foster father. This fruit is very powerful. It’s a second life form. ”

Tianci received it and his eyes lit up. He said excitedly.

“Yes, take it yourself first. If you die accidentally, you can be revived directly on the ancestral tree! ”

Wang Xian nodded. “I’m here this time to bring you to another universe for a hunt!

Tianci was astonished when he heard Wang Xian’s words. He looked at him.

Wang Xian nodded his head. “I’m going to hunt down a heaven origin creator who is at the control level. In the chaos, his strength is about the same as yours. This time, Pll let you experience the real battle of a heaven origin creator so that you can gain some experience! ”

“Alright, Foster father. I’ll listen to you. Pm bored at home now. I have a feeling of invincibility. Hehe! ”

Tianci nodded his head with interest. He was eager to give it a try.

After all, being invincible at a young age was very lonely!

Wang Xian nodded his head with a smile.

“Tell your mother and the rest. They’ll probably be away for a few hundred

Wang Xian said to him.

“Yes, yes. Foster father, since you’re here, let’s have a meal before we set off! ”

Tianci nodded and said! “Alright! ”

Wang Xian agreed.

Then, they came to a quiet courtyard.

Wang Xian, tianci, Mu Liyin’er, Gong Cheng, and Tianci’s grandfather were sitting at a dining table, eating and chatting about some things!

“Mom, lianci, I’m going out with godfather this time. I’ll be back in a few hundred years at most! ”

Before they left, Mu Lianci spoke to them!

“Tianci, you have to pay attention to your safety! ”

Mu Liyin c er said with a smile.

“Don’t worry, Mom. With godfather around, what can happen?”

Tianci said with a smile, “Furthermore, godfather gave me a treasure that can resurrect me without any injuries. It means that I can be resurrected directly after I die. Nothing will happen. Godfather gave me a lot of resurrected treasures. It’s difficult for anything to happen! ”

(‘I know, I know. Listen to your foster father when you’re outside. Don’t try to be brave. ”

Mu Liyin ‘er smiled and nodded.

She wasn’t too worried about tianci and the rest.

Mu Liyin ‘er and the rest all had the soul-returning embryo fruit that Wang

Xian had given them.

Tianci had even more resurrected treasures in his hands. He could be resurrected even if he was in real danger!

“Tianci is already very strong. He still needs to accumulate some experience! ”

“With me around, everything will be fine! ”

Wang Xian said to them.

“The child will have to face some problems on his own eventually. It’s better for him to experience more with you now. You guys go ahead. I’ll prepare some delicious food for you guys when you return! ”

Mu Liyin nodded.

“Don’t worry, Mom. Take a look. Goodbye. I’ll be back soon! ”

Tianci waved his hand at them.

The dark energy at the side enveloped them and disappeared instantly!

“Foster father, which universe are we going to? Are there any powerhouses in that universe? Will I be suppressed by that universe if I Go There?”

Tianci followed Wang Xian to the Dragon Palace.

He asked Wang Xian continuously out of curiosity.

(‘We are going to the sword and Magic Universe. There are very few powerhouses in that universe. There are only two heaven origin destiny realm powerhouses. Furthermore, they are no match for you even if they join forces. There are already other heaven origin destiny realm powerhouses setting up altars around that universe. They are preparing to attack that universe when the calamity arrives! ”

(‘We need to kill the Heaven origin destiny realm powerhouses who are coveting that universe. Our target is the heaven origin destiny realm powerhouses who believe in the universe. Their attacking methods and abilities are different from ours. We must be careful and be careful! ”

Wang Xian said to tianci!

Sword and Magic Universe? I’ve never heard of this. I’ve heard of the belief universe! ”

Tianci raised his eyebrows and said.

“Oh? You know about the belief universe?”

Wang Xian looked at him and asked curiously.

“Uncle Tusha City and the rest gave me some information about other universes. Among them, there are some records of the belief universe!”

Tianci nodded!
