Chapter 240: Pilgrimage (3)

Voices from a few attendants and Elders of Thistles and Thorns Sect sounded from the side. Wang Xian looked briefly across the crowd before continuing his casual chat with Guan Shuqing.

“The one heading towards us is from the Fengyang Family and the one at the forefront is Fengyang Lie, an Inborn Realm expert!”

“Fengyang Family is one of the strongest families in Feng City. They have a lot of descendants. The entire family has over 2,000 members and they are a huge family with more than a hundred years of history!”

“That young man right there is Fengyang Cai. He used to be the ranked twentieth on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart!”

“Greetings, family head of Fengyang Family!”

“Yeah, hehe!”

Several people beside the Thistles and Thorns Sect were whispering among themselves. When Sect Leader Tang saw Fengyang Family walking in his direction, he immediately stood up and greeted them.

Fengyang Lie, who was walking at the front, looked coldly at Sect Leader Tang before giving a forced smile.

Sect Leader Tang was a little embarrassed. However, he didn’t say a word and sat to the side.

“Thistles and Thorns Sect is really unlucky to offend an Elder from the Flame Palace. The future development of Thistles and Thorns Sect will become tough!”

“It’s their fault, offending those they shouldn’t have. They only have themselves to blame!”

Two young men walking at the front of the Fengyang Family crowd were chatting. They were quite loud and weren’t concerned about the Thistles and Thorns Sect who was just beside them.

This made the crowd from Thistles and Thorns Sect embarrassed.

Wow!

“Eh, it’s that beautiful girl!”

At this moment, the young man who was talking opened up the folded the fan in his hand while staring intensely at the position beside Wang Xian.

“Looking at the clouds reminds me of her clothes. Looking at the flowers reminds me of her looks. The spring breeze blows and the flowers bloom. If I haven’t seen her at the foot of the mountain for immortals, I’ll see her under the moonlight by the abode of immortals.” [1]

The young man recited a poem as he fanned himself. He was staring at Sun Lingxiu fervently.

When Fengyang Lie saw his son, he smiled and said, “Let’s just sit here while waiting!”

“Father, your son is going to get you a daughter-in-law!” the young man with a folded fan smiled and said to his father.

Fengyang Lie returned a faint smile before looking to Sun Lingxiu. “She’s indeed beautiful and befitting of our Fengyang Family!”

“Haha!” the young man laughed loudly.

“Brother Cai, that girl is really stunning. I just wonder if she has a boyfriend!”

The young man beside him was stunned by Sun Lingxiu’s beauty and commented enviously.

“She sits with her legs closed together and the distance between her eyebrows is short. She’s definitely still a virgin!”

Fengyang Cai moved his folded fan as he continued, “Rare! Rare! Holy and noble! Let me go over and get to know her!”

As he finished his words, he walked directly to Sun Lingxiu. “Hi, I’m Fengyang Cai from the Fengyang Family. I am greatly attracted by your looks. May I know the name of this beautiful lady?”

Fengyang Cai fanned himself lightly and gave off the vibe of a scholar from Jiangnan.

Sun Lingxiu sat beside Wang Xian with a medical book from Miracle Doctor Blood Man in her hands. She simply sat there quietly while reading.

As she flipped through the book, the stunning disposition she displayed was similar to that of a deity who had descended to the mortal realm.

Sun Lingxiu ignored Fengyang Cai’s question completely. As an Inborn expert, she could hear his conversation with others previously and had chosen to completely ignore him.

“Sun Lingxiu is really attractive. There’s actually someone trying to pick her up!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Guan Shuqing, who was beside Wang Xian, was a little envious while speaking to Wang Xian.

“You are equally attractive!” Wang Xian smiled and pinched her cheeks. He then turned around and looked towards Sun Lingxiu.

When the crowd from Thistles and Thorns Sect saw Fengyang Cai greeting the beautiful girl who came with Wang Xian, they looked over inquisitively.

Huh?

Seeing Sun Lingxiu completely ignoring him, Fengyang Cai was slightly shocked.

“Brother Cai, what’s the matter? Why don’t you let me, your brother, give it a try?”

The other young man by the side spoke with a smile when he saw Sun Lingxiu completely ignoring his brother.

Fengyang Cai looked a little embarrassed. He leaned towards Sun Lingxiu again and asked, “Hey girl, it’s rude to be ignoring others, right?”

“My master is already ignoring you. Don’t be so thick skinned and keep coming over!”

Miracle Doctor Blood Man, Xiao Hong, who was standing beside Sun Lingxiu, lifted his head slightly and spoke with contempt.

His broken Mandarin sounded a little quirky.

Huh?

Upon hearing Miracle Doctor Blood Man, Fengyang Cai was shocked. He squinted his eyes and stared at him. “An underling has no right to speak here!”

“Hey, girl. I, Fengyang Cai, am talking to you. Are you not going to show me any respect?”

His face sank as he stared at Sun Lingxiu, who was still going through the book. In his eyes, fury was raging.

However, Sun Lingxiu still didn’t say a word. Miracle Doctor Blood Man, Xiao Hong, walked forward and stared at him with disdain. He then remarked, “Get... Lost!”

Miracle Doctor Blood Man’s quirky Mandarin coupled with the disdain look on him was hilarious.

“Shut up and get lost!”

Pa!

When Fengyang Cai heard Miracle Doctor Blood Man, his already embarrassed look sank further. He waved the folded fan in his hands and a crisp noise sounded instantly. The fan was in fact made of metal and wasn’t any ordinary fan.

“Hey girl, you have gone a little overboard!” He looked coldly towards Sun Lingxiu once again.

Huh?

Some members from the Fengyang Family also frowned and looked over, feeling confused about what was happening.

“F*ck your mother! You asking me to shut up? Asking me to get lost? Hey, brat, I’m telling you to scram now. Can you hear me? Brat!”

When Miracle Doctor Blood Man heard Fengyang Cai, he immediately chided him.

Pfft!

“What the!”

“This... This...”

Wang Xian, Xiao Yu and the crowd who was watching silently from the side couldn’t help but break into laughter. The crowd of Thistles and Thorns Sect was also shocked as they looked at Miracle Doctor Blood Man.

A well-dressed and good looking foreigner was hurling vulgarities in Mandarin. His voice and expression at that moment were truly hilarious.

Even Sun Lingxiu who was reading a book silently couldn’t help but break into laughter.

“YOU...”

In that instant, Fengyang Cai’s expression turned violent and savage as he stared at Miracle Doctor Blood Man!

When Fengyang Lie heard Miracle Doctor Blood Man, killing intent flashed in his eyes. F*ck your mother? Wouldn’t that be f*ck his wife?

“You must be tired of living!” Fengyang Cai’s eyes turned cold as he swung his folded fan towards the chest of the Miracle Doctor Blood Man.

“Brat, I can kill you with a swing of my hand!”

Miracle Doctor Blood Man, Xiao Hong, was extremely pissed. He waved his hand casually and slapped Fengyang Cai in the face before anyone reacted to it.

“What?”

Fengyang Cai was horrified. Following which, a strong force sent him falling to the ground.

Bam!

His body smashed onto the floor and blood was oozing out from his mouth!

“Filthy blood! You’ve dirtied my hand!”

Miracle Doctor Blood Man saw a drop of blood land on his fingers. He took out a piece of tissue impatiently and wiped it off with contempt.

“You are such an ugly guy and yet you dare to flirt with my master. Trash! Trash!”

Miracle Doctor Blood Man stepped on Fengyang Cai’s face with his feet and remarked with disdain.

“You must be tired of living!”
