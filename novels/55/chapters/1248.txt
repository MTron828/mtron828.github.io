Chapter 1249: 1,250 me, thousand leaves

Translator: 5496903

Thousand Leaves’challenge caused a huge sensation. Countless people discussed the question of who would win and who would lose.

Compared to thousand leaves, who had stayed at the top for two years, most of the youths still believed that the nameless prodigy would win.

Because his strength was simply too strong.

Legendary Prodigy!

Son of a monster!

The youngest prodigy in history!

Each and every one of these names was generously given to him by the youths in the Prodigy stage.

When the students of the Divine Wind Academy saw that most of the people were supporting the nameless prodigy, their faces were filled with rage.

But they had no choice. Even in the depths of their hearts, they had some doubts as to whether their senior Qian Ye was a match for the other party.

The entire prodigy stage was bustling with activity. Everyone was waiting for the big battle tomorrow.

The news of this big battle also spread to the area where the humans gathered in the monster graveyard. When they heard about this big battle, tens of millions of people were filled with shock.

Many people were prepared to come and watch this battle of the Heaven’s pride. They wanted to see which Heaven’s pride would be able to reach the peak.

Many factions were also rushing over. They wanted to try and recruit some heaven’s pride disciples.

The battle tomorrow attracted the attention of all the humans in the LADYBOY graveyard.

At this moment, the void interpretation realm experts of the boundless sea empire were already prepared.

Revenge!

Hunting Heaven’s chosen!

Everything had to wait until tomorrow.

“HMPH, they really think that Nameless Heaven’s chosen is invincible. I hate this kind of people the most. They don’t even dare to show their faces!”

Within the Heaven’s Pride Pavilion, three figures stood at the very top, overlooking the entire Heaven’s pride stage.

The girl on the left spoke with a displeased expression.

“They really thought that nameless would win. What a joke!”

Tang Yuan coldly drank a mouthful of tea, his eyes filled with disdain.

“Right now, Qian Ye’s strength is something that no one could have imagined. Not only her strength, but also her achievements in the past two years. In the future, this Qian Ye will definitely be a dragon among men!”

Tang Feng’s eyes flickered as he thought of Qian Ye. His gaze was solemn as well.

“Big Brother, I heard that this Qian ye wants to establish a sect and a Dynasty?”

Tang Yuan asked curiously.

“With his strength, he is still far from establishing a sect and a dynasty. However, he has great ambitions. If he doesn’t die, he might really be able to establish a powerful faction in the future!”

Tang Feng evaluated with a serious expression.

Tang Ling ‘Er and Tang Yuan revealed expressions of surprise. There weren’t many people who could make their big brother comment in this way.

The stars changed, Day and night alternated.

On the second day, a large number of people rushed over from the front of the Heaven’s pride stage.

Under normal circumstances, 30 to 40 thousand people around the heaven’s pride stage was already a very large number.

However, today, around 9 am, more than 100,000 people had gathered around the heaven’s pride stage.

There were still a few hours before the duel in the afternoon.

“There are so many people. The arena can’t support so many people!”

“Yeah, I reckon there will be many people who won’t be able to enter the arena to watch!”

“Just watch from the sky. Who knows, the battle might end very soon. After all, the Nameless Heaven’s pride stage is so strong!”

“You’re underestimating the top stage. This is the top stage. It can accommodate more than 200,000 people!”

When there was still about half an hour before the scheduled battle time, more than 200,000 people gathered around the prodigy stage.

The densely packed crowd made many young people frown.

Everyone hurriedly flew into the sky. They wanted to enter the stage as soon as possible.

The sky, which was five hundred meters high, was filled with people.

Some of them would occasionally look at the arena and the cultivation room in the middle, which belonged to the top heaven’s favorites. Many of the young men had envious looks in their eyes.

“Eh? There are actually so many people?”

Wang Xian walked out of the room and looked around. He revealed a surprised expression.

There were more than twenty people. It was densely packed. It was like a sea of people.

Luckily, I wore a mask to hide my identity

Wang Xian thought to himself. He scanned his surroundings and realized that there were more than a dozen insightful emptiness realm experts.

He looked at the time. It was almost time for the scheduled battle.

Buzz

At this moment, Wang Xian sensed the vibration of the formation coming from the heaven’s favorites arena above him.

He raised his eyebrows and flew upwards.

“The formation has been activated. We can enter now. Qian ye should be nearby!”

“Let’s go in first!”

“Look, the Nameless Heaven’s favorites have entered the heaven’s favorites arena. Haha, the Battle for the first place on the heaven’s favorites list has begun!”

The crowd around them sensed the changes in the heaven’s favorites arena. They were all excited as they flew into the arena.

More than 200,000 people swarmed into the arena. The densely packed crowd was also very shocked.

Wang Xian had already arrived at the center of the arena. It was an arena with a radius of three kilometers.

Only he and Qian ye could enter the arena. The rest could not enter.

“Nameless! Nameless! Nameless!”

When some people entered the arena and saw Wang Xian standing in the arena, they shouted excitedly.

A strong person would be respected no matter where he was.

This was especially so for someone like Wang Xian, a genius of the current generation who could suppress the entire era. Many people were filled with admiration for him.

Ren Xingchen and Ling Jian ‘er stood closer to the ring. As they looked at Wang Xian, their eyes sparkled.

“There are more people who are optimistic about the Nameless Heaven’s Pride!”

“To be able to possess such strength at the age of 26, how terrifying. I wonder which faction nurtured him!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Most of them support the nameless prodigy. After all, Qian Ye hasn’t made a move for two years. Moreover, when she defeated Tang Feng, she barely won in a few moves!”

“Maybe this nameless prodigy can really make history. At the age of 26, he can become the top prodigy in the Liuhai region and suppress the entire Liuhai region for an era!”

Those who were older than 50 years old, or those who did not mingle in the prodigy stage, had astonished expressions on their faces when they heard this earth-shattering Shout!

Those from the divine wind academy who supported Senior Qian Ye had embarrassed expressions on their faces. Their shouts were completely unable to cause any ripples here.

“Senior Qian Ye, hurry up and come out. Hurry up and kill this arrogant fellow, Nameless!”

Some of the Divine Wind Academy students thought to themselves as they sized up their surroundings.

The arena had already opened, which meant that senior thousand leaves was in the surroundings.

“Roar Roar!”

Right at this moment, a roar suddenly sounded in the sky above the arena. The abrupt sound caused everyone to be slightly taken aback.

“Who is so arrogant? To actually bring a mount here?”

“Doesn’t he know how to keep a low profile? This is an act of courting death!”

The roar of the fierce beast caused many experts of the profound void tier to be dissatisfied. They all looked to the right.

“En? Thousand Shadow mercenary group, over five hundred people? Why are all the members of the Thousand Shadow mercenary group here?”
