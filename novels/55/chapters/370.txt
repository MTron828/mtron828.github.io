Chapter 371: Goddess Kun Breeder

“Inheritance? From Ancient God Kun Breeder? What’s that?” asked Lan Qingyue to Wang Xian with surprise.

“Take it, and you’ll know!”

Wang Xian chuckled. “Shuqing possesses the fire-elemental talent in her cultivation because she has the Suzaku Blood Essence. Towards the later stage of her cultivation, she can evolve into one of the great races in this universe – Suzaku! This Ancient God Kun Breeder’s inheritance is as good as Suzaku!”

“Suzaku? Ancient God Kun Breeder?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Lan Qingyue was filled with disbelief. She did not know about Ancient God Kun Breeder, but she knew about Suzaku. That was the most powerful Divine Beast among the myths, the legendary Phoenix!

“Blood essence of Suzaku?”

Guan Shuqing was taken by surprise. Wang Xian did not shed light on the Blood Essence of Suzaku to her.

But when she thought of the mighty and domineering Phoenix she sometimes dreamt of, all her doubts were finally answered.

“So I have the Blood Essence of Suzaku. No wonder I’ve noticed I have the natural ability to control fires ever since...that time. I don’t even feel the pain when boiling water is spilled on me. My cultivation speed is breakneck. Even Master told me that I’m a rare genius in cultivation!” Guan Shuqing said, enlightened.

“This is the effect of the Blood Essence of Suzaku. It is most likely because you obtained the Inheritance of Suzaku that your strength is boosted.” Wang Xian was uncertain as he spoke.

Guan Shuqing had absorbed the Blood Essence of Suzaku. Still, he was unsure if she had obtained the Inheritance of Suzaku.

However, Lan Qingyue would get the Inheritance of Ancient God Kun Breeder after she absorbed the Essence Soul. She would learn all the secrets about the Art of Cultivation from the Ancient God Race!

“Mm!”

Lan Qingyue took the Essence Soul of Ancient God Kun Breeder from Wang Xian and popped it into her mouth.

As the Essence Soul entered her body, immense energy was exuded from her body.

A bout of quaint, dignified, vintage aura slowly dispersed to the surroundings from her body.

With a thought, Lan Qingyue sat on the bed with her legs crossed as she accepted the Inheritance of Ancient God Kun Breeder.

“Her strength is rapidly improving. Within seconds, she has attained Half-step to Inborn Realm. If she possesses the entire inheritance, her strength can hit Level 11!”

Wang Xian was also shocked as he observed the increasing power of Lan Qingyue.

A drop of almost-diminishing Blood Essence, yet, contained such domineering energy. No doubt, the Ancient God Clan was powerful. That was why supreme-class races and clans had to join hands in wiping them out.

“Let’s go. We shall leave Qingyue alone!” Wang Xian climbed out from his bed and whispered to Guan Shuqing.

“Mm!”

When they walked out of the bedroom, Sun Lingxiu threw a beaming face as she stared at Wang Xian and Guan Shuqing.

“Xiao Xian, you better pay attention to your health!”

“Hur?” Wang Xian was slightly stunned as Sun Lingxiu sounded as if she intended more than what she said.

“Mm.” He smiled. He did not have to move, so there was absolutely no problem.

“Dragon King, the Anomalocaris, and Swordfish races are willing to join the Dragon Palace!”

At this time, a Venomous Sea Snake swam over to Wang Xian and reported respectfully.

“Did they agree to join?”

A trace of happiness was exhibited on Wang Xian’s face. He quickly asked, “Have they all jumped over the Dragon Gate?”

“Yes, all of them did. So we gave them two choices. Either we kill them, or they join the Dragon Sect. They chose the latter!”

The voice of the Venomous Sea Snake continued to be heard.

Wang Xian giggled. During the battle, he had already taken notice of those two strange races.

From their eyes, he could see intelligent radiance.

Moreover, Wang Xian felt the power of thunder from the Anomalocaris.

As for the Swordfish race, they had the metallic radiance.

Both races possessed elemental attacks.

Out of those races that had besieged them yesterday, only Anomalocaris and Swordfish race came with attack properties.

Even as mighty as Pliosaurus, Dunkleosteus, and Mega Teeth Shark were, they did not have it.

All they had was a powerful bloodline.

“Bring them over!”

“Yes, Dragon King!”

The venomous sea snake made a swift movement and swam out of the Dragon King Hall.

Wang Xian smiled as he sat on the Dragon Throne.

Guan Shuqing and Sun Lingxiu witnessed the amazing scene with flickering eyes as they stared at Wang Xian with admiration.

“Greetings to the Dragon King!”

Soon, a Level 11 blueish Anomalocaris, with flashing radiance of thunder at its two front limbs, led about two hundred Anomalocaris over. They swam over and bowed on the floor with respect.

Hundreds of Swordfish were floating above the ground as they shouted in synchrony.

“Mm!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across them with a satisfying expression.

The prawn species was a compelling race. Just take the most common Mantis shrimps, for example. Their two massive forelimbs could strike with great power.

It was so powerful that they could break the aquarium glass.

The Anomalocaris before him had similar forelimbs as the Mantis shrimps. In addition, they had terrifying thunder attribution.

Beside them were Swordfish, a very common marine species. But the Swordfish race before them was very different.

They had a protruding part on their heads, which seemed like razor-sharp swords, giving off a metallic radiance. Any creatures would be killed if they were to be pierced by it.

“Count yourself lucky to join the Dragon Palace. After the other members of the Dragon Palace are resurrected, I’ll assign your departments. Now, here’s your opportunity!”

Wang Xian slowly stood up and imparted upon them the Cultivation Arts of Metal Dragon Transformation and Thunder Dragon Transformation. After this, he looked towards the Nine Venomous Sea Snakes.

“Take them to the Dragon Transformation Pool for Dragon Blood Baptism.”

“The nine of you will guard the Dragon Palace now. After Prime Minister Turtle and the rest are resurrected, you’ll also have your Dragon Blood Baptism in the Dragon Transformation Pool!”

“Thank you, Dragon King!”

The Anomalocaris and Swordfish were looking excited as they quickly replied at the top of their lungs.

“Go on!”

Wang Xian waved them off.

“Wow, Xiao Xian. You looked so impressive just now. Dragon King, that’s so cool!”

When Guan Shuqing saw the majestic-looking Wang Xian, she walked over with admiration and smiles as she spoke.

“Hehe, of course!” Wang Xian chuckled. “What do you want to eat? You must be hungry. Let’s get some food!”

...

For the next two days, Wang Xian recuperated in the Dragon Palace.

Lan Qingyue, who had been receiving her inheritance, suddenly opened her eyes when Wang Xian was sleeping after Guan Shuqing rode on top of him.

A huge beast flashed across her eyes.

A torrent of controlled and terrifying energy was filling her body.

The majestic, quaint, and magnificent aura surrounded her.

But as soon as she spotted Wang Xian and Guan Shuqing by her side, she rolled her eyes.

She walked out of the bedroom with a beaming face. But she knit her eyebrows slightly as soon as she saw the Anomalocaris and Swordfish races.

But after she lifted her chin and saw the blue whale swimming above the Dragon Palace, her eyes were filled with a pleasant surprise!
