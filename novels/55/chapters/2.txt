Chapter 3: Arowanas That Cost Millions

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

During the summer break, the entire school was plunged into quietness as not many students stayed back in school.

Hence, the school canteen was not opened. Wang Xian would usually have his meals outside of school.

The University of Rivertown, unlike other universities, was not situated in the desolate suburbs.

The university was situated within Rivertown College Town which had three universities and three vocational schools in total.

The area surrounding the University of Rivertown was extremely robust with an old street. Even though it was known as the old street, everything was new inside. It was a street that was full of buildings that were imitations from the ancient days.

The old street was the most robust street within Rivertown as it gathered all the students from the six schools. With a few high-class residential areas surrounding it, many people were there even though it was summer break.

However, there was not much of a crowd on the street as it was raining today.

Wang Xian looked at the restaurants around him. “Let’s have something good today.”

Previously, he was so thrifty that every meal would not cost him more than fifteen dollars. Most of the time, he would settle his meals with instant noodles.

Even though Wang Xian was as broke as usual, he thought of ways to earn money with the golden opportunity he chanced upon today. So, he decided to splurge for once.

Wang Xian observed the restaurants around him and fixed his gaze on a restaurant that was called First-grade Seafood Restaurant.

First-grade Restaurant was the most expensive restaurant on the street. Wang Xian’s roommate mentioned that two people could spend almost six to seven hundred dollars for a simple meal here.

Average spending per person was about three to four hundred dollars, which was a price that he could not afford before. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Yet, at the same time, this restaurant served the most delicious food on this street.

“This is it.” Wang Xian decided to have a sumptuous meal.

“Welcome.” The two greeters at the door bowed welcomingly.

“Sir, you can leave your umbrella here.” The waitress on the right said to him with a crisp-clear voice.

“Sure.” Wang Xian nodded.

“Eh?” However, he revealed a surprised look on his face when he looked up to the girl.

Seeing Wang Xian staring at her, the girl smiled at him politely.

“Guan Shuqing? She’s Guan Shuqing, the hottest girl in our major.” Wang Xian recovered from his state of shock. The girl who was greeting him was also a student from the same year as him.

A pretty girl who was also among the top few beauties in the school – Guan Shuqing.

However, they were not from the same class. Hence, she would not know a nobody like Wang Xian.

Guan Shuqing had many admirers courting her in school. One of the most epic incidents was that a rich man’s son drove a Ferrari with a full trunk of flowers to woo her, but was rejected.

“Never would I expect to see Guan Shuqing working as a part-timer during the summer break.”

Wang Xian was thinking to himself. A pretty girl like her would gain easy access to money if she needed it, just like how she... but now...

“But probably, this was the reason why many people took a liking to Guan Shuqing.”

Wang Xian shook his head. He did not care about the gossip in school, so he was unaware of her situation.

“Sir, how many of you?” A waiter walked over and asked.

“One.”

“Sir, this way please.”

The waiter led him into the restaurant. Wang Xian observed the crowd that was dining in the restaurant. The business here was extremely good.

After getting himself seated, Wang Xian studied the dishes on the menu.

“It’s indeed the First-grade Restaurant. They even have twin abalones that are worth two hundred thousand dollars.” Wang Xian stared at the price on the menu.

Apart from the high-priced twin abalones, a portion of sashimi cost seven to eight hundred dollars and a portion of caviar cost a few thousand dollars.

On top of that, an Australia lobster of three to five jin cost two thousand dollars each.

“That is simply expensive!” Wang Xian was slightly stunned. He ordered a plate of oysters, two cheap dishes and a soup which cost him over two hundred dollars in total.

“Sir, please wait for a moment. The dishes will be brought to you in no time.” The good-looking waitress said with a sweet smile.

“Okay.” Wang Xian nodded. Good restaurants simply had better service. Even the waitresses are all young and beautiful.

Soon, the dishes were served to him. Wang Xian began to tuck in his food excitedly. Previously, he had eaten all kinds of artificially flavored instant noodles including stew beef, tomato beef, Sichuan spicy beef, and pickled vegetables. He almost wanted to puke. Today, he could finally upgrade his meal.

After a hearty meal, Wang Xian burped with satisfaction and took a few sips of tea.

“The food here is really delicious. When I’m rich in the future, I’ll bring my sister here every day.” Wang Xian told himself.

“Excuse me, can I have the bill?”

Wang Xian called out and foot the bill of over two hundred dollars. A meal like this was equivalent to more than one week’s worth of his meals.

After footing the bill, he was about to leave with a smiling face.

Bang!

“Ah!”

When he got up, he heard something shatter and a fearful scream coming from the entrance.

Wang Xian wondered for a while, but he was not bothered by it and continued on his way out.

When he was at the door, he saw a fish tank that was about 1.8 meters long, three fish and some water lying on the floor.

A middle-aged man was yelling anxiously, “Get some water now. Hurry! It can’t die. It can’t die.”

As he was yelling, he walked to the three fish. Two of them were fine while the remaining one was looking half-dead under the broken glass of the tank.

“Boss, I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I didn’t see you just now.” A greeter in her uniform who was standing to the side was apologizing to the boss with an ashen face.

“Don’t apologize to me. You’ll be lucky if the arowanas are fine. If anything happens to them, you can’t even compensate me even if you sell yourself away.” The middle-aged boss was howling at the girl with anger.

The girl paled immediately with her eyes red.

“Gosh, Mr. Li, how did this happen? Why are the three arowanas on the floor?” At this time, an elder walked over with a surprised look.

Mr. Li looked up at the elder and replied quickly, “Zhao, a young lady accidentally broke the tank when the workers were moving it.”

“Do these three arowanas belong to Old Wang? They’re worth five to six million dollars. Old Wang treated them like precious jewels. How did you borrow the fish from him?” Zhao squatted down and examined the three arowanas.

At the same time, the employees from the hotel fetched a huge basin of water.

Zhao began to examine the condition of the three arowanas.

The greeter at the side got even paler when she heard the old man.

Wang Xian was stunned by the old man’s words too. Three fish for five to six million?

“If three fish are worth five to six million, each of them would have cost one to two million?” Wang Xian was aghast in hearing the price. He looked towards the greeter and frowned immediately. “Guan Shuqing!”
