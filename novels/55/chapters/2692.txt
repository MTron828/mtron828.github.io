2693 2693 erupted in full force

“Eh? The imperial court actually issued such an announcement at this time?”

In the boundless starry sky of the universe, the Dragon Peak dashed toward the center of the Demon Island at full speed.

When Wang Xian opened the AI, he immediately saw this message.

He raised his eyebrows slightly, and his eyes were sparkling.

“This should be related to the battle between the Dragon Palace and the horizon sect.”

He mumbled to himself. It was almost certain.

There was such an announcement right after the battle between the Dragon Palace and the horizon sect. It was obviously a warning to them.

However, Wang Xian did not take it to heart. The battle had ended. Furthermore, he also saw the news from the AI that the people from the horizon sect had left the demon island.

In a short period of time, they would not be able to start a battle with the Heaven’s end sect.

“The Dragon Palace’s strength is still a little lacking if we want to destroy the Heaven’s end sect. After this upgrade and the addition of the Heaven’s end ruler, we might have a chance, but the chances are still slim.”

In this battle with the Heaven’s end sect, the dragon palace indeed possessed overwhelming strength.

However, there was another crucial reason for them to be able to destroy so many people from the heaven’s end sect.

That was because the world margin sect underestimated their enemy and directly surrounded Dragon Peak, allowing the disciples of the Dragon Palace to kill wantonly.

However, they were still able to escape in the end. After all, the world margin sect was a huge force that had stood on the demon island for hundreds of millions of years and had many powerful trump cards.

After witnessing the strength of the Dragon Palace, it would be difficult for them to have such an opportunity in the future.

“However, as long as the Dragon Palace improves a little more, it will be able to completely destroy the world margin sect.”

He mumbled as he stood on the command platform and stared at this area.

“Dragon King, we’re here.”

Two days later, Dragon Peak arrived at the central territory of the Demon Island, the trump card of the world margin sect.

“Let’s go. We’ll take over all the planets of the world margin sect.”

The corners of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly.

The people of the world margin sect were afraid that the Dragon Palace would rush over and left in a hurry. They only took one planet and left immediately.

Currently, there were more than 100,000 life planets in the territory of the world margin sect. These life planets all belonged to the Dragon Palace now. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Eh?”

At this moment, Wang Xian saw a few thousand people standing in the void in front of him. They looked over as if they were waiting for the arrival of the Dragon Palace.

“Go over!”

Wang Xian said faintly.

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

Dragon Peak drove over and shouted respectfully when he saw more than 3,000 people.

“You are?”

Wang Xian stood on the command platform and swept his gaze across the crowd.

All of them were immortal king level, but the strongest one was only at level 6 immortal king.

“Dragon King, we are some families and merchants from the world margin sect. All the strong disciples of the world margin sect have retreated. We are here to welcome everyone from the Dragon Palace.”

The Level 6 immortal king in the lead said respectfully.

“Alright, your position here will not change. We are about to take over all the planets.”

Wang Xian looked at everyone and smiled.

With them, it would be much more convenient for the Dragon Palace to take over the planets.

“Yes, yes, yes, Dragon King. We will cooperate fully with the rest.”

Everyone nodded immediately and said respectfully.

“Yes, bring us to the best planet at the moment.”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly and gave them an order.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Everyone nodded their heads immediately and brought Wang Xian and the rest to a planet in front of them.

An hour later, they arrived in front of a planet.

“As expected of the planet of the world’s end sect. It’s much better than the planet where the main Dragon Palace is now. They are not on the same level at all.”

Wang Xian looked at the planet in front of him. Immortal Qi lingered. Ancient trees, ancient mountains, and some divine trees could be seen everywhere.

In his heart, he decided to move the main dragon palace to this side.

“Everyone, please wait on the ocean for a while.”

As Wang Xian spoke, he flew directly to this planet called Gu Tian and entered the ocean.

His body moved and he immediately summoned the Dragon Palace.

The Majestic Dragon Palace appeared and stood straight in the ocean. The Dragon Palace was considered to have gone through another migration.

...

“Prime Minister Gui, there’s a group of people up there. Go and learn about the situation in the world’s end domain from them. Also, bring some people to take over the planet that belongs to the world’s end sect.”

Wang Xian entered the Dragon Palace and instructed immediately.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

“All the other disciples of the Dragon Palace, come over and prepare for another upgrade.”

As Wang Xian spoke, he immediately came to the front of the dragon transformation pool.

Soon, the members of the Dragon Palace rushed over one by one with smiles on their faces.

Wang Xian stood at the side and transformed the corpses into Dragon Qi.

The harvest this time was not small. It could allow the immortal king level powerhouse of the Dragon Palace to break through to 100,000.

And the level 9 undyings could break through to 20.

Over the next few days, the Dragon Palace began to take over the stars, the sky array led people to use array techniques to search for the god countries hidden in the void.

This battle had killed 7 to 8 million people from the world margin sect, close to 20,000 undyings, and their God countries were all hidden within the void crevices.

...

Finding the god countries within these void crevices was also a huge resource.

At the very least, it could give the devouring dragon clan a huge boost.

Right now, the Devouring Dragon Ao Xie and the others’improvements were already much slower.

Time passed day by day, and the Dragon Palace was also madly improving.

And half a month later, the imperial court used their AI to once again announce to everyone in the Emperor Star field that an all-out war had broken out.

The three major islands, including the Demon Island, which were located on the central island of the imperial court, had been invaded by the abyss.

And the war between the humans and the Abyss in the imperial star area had completely begun.

The entire army of the imperial court started to operate, and countless experts of the imperial court rushed to the battlefield.

The entire imperial star area instantly became nervous. All the people in the AI were discussing about the invasion of the abyss.

News also came from the Imperial Star Lady. The most outstanding disciples of the current generation of the Imperial Court had already entered the frontline of the Abyss.

Wang Xian had already sent an immortal king level eight and three immortal king level seven experts over twenty days ago to help the Imperial Star Lady build up her achievements.

With the help of the members of the Dragon Palace, the imperial star lady had reaped huge rewards in the first battle.

On the Demon Island, the Northern line continued to expand. However, it would take three to four months to reach the center.

Due to the last encirclement, the Abyss on the east side had calmed down. No abyssal seeds had appeared.

Compared to the calm on the demon island’s side, the rest of the places had completely erupted.

Wang Xian was also paying attention to the battles in other places through the AI.

After more than half a month, the advancement of the members of the Dragon Palace had come to an end.

Therefore, he was ready to speed up the promotion of the strength of the Dragon Palace.

Take the initiative to attack!
