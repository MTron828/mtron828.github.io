Chapter 3010: had killed tens of millions of people

“Hahaha, it’s been half a year. We’ve finally found the entrance to the starry sky!”

At the edge of the Mohan clan ruins, everyone from the four-armed race and the three-eyed race stared at the place in front of them with excitement.

The two forces had a total of 10 million experts. After searching for more than half a year, they finally found the entrance to the space.

At the very front, the four-armed patriarch and the three-eyed patriarch, who were sitting cross-legged on the Treasure Lotus, had faint smiles on their faces.

They looked at the entrance to the starry sky and exchanged a glance.

“This array can defend against the attacks of a rank six divine emperor. The person who set it up should be a rank six divine Emperor Magus. No Wonder Our Vanguard Army was destroyed!”

The four-armed race leader said indifferently.

“Hehe, no matter how powerful it is, we will make them pay the price of destruction this time!”

“Let’s Go!”

The three-eyed race leader said indifferently. His body moved and the two of them flew towards the entrance.

The two race leaders entered. At the back, the clansmen followed behind with excited expressions. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

This time, the two large clans had sent 80% of their forces.

With the two large clans joining forces, it wasn’t an exaggeration to say that this was a powerful force around the Mo Han clan ruins!

“I wonder how many God Dragon bloodlines the Dragon Palace has!”

“As long as there are a few hundred, it’s still a huge amount of resources. You have to know that the god Dragon bloodlines are extremely valuable in the current universe!”

“If there are tens of thousands of them, that would be even more satisfying. We can also become Dragon Knights!”

The two races entered the resplendent starry sky. They were all looking around with great interest and discussing amongst themselves.

In the current universe, even the Asian dragons were worth a lot.

The bloodline of the Dragon God was incomparably noble. As long as one had the bloodline of the Dragon God, with a little nurturing, one could possibly rise to the pinnacle of the Emperor God realm.

If one’s bloodline was pure, one could even reach the level of a universe knight.

What kind of concept was this?

A Universe Knight was a terrifying existence that only the primary races of the universe had.

To be able to have the Dragon God’s mount represented one’s status and status.

Even their clan leader didn’t have the right to use the dragon God as a mount.

When they said that they wanted to become Dragon Knights, it was just for fun!

A group of ten million people, with the weakest being a tier six divine emperor expert, the core strength of the two great clans, and over 20,000 divine emperor level experts, entered the resplendent starry sky in a grandiose manner.

“Oh? What are the people from these two great clans doing? Nearly 80% of their strength is gathered here. Yi, they actually entered the Mo Han Room Ruins.”

Just as everyone from the two large clans entered through the entrance, behind them, more than a dozen figures were hidden in the air, watching them enter with puzzlement.

More than a dozen of them had noticed the situation here two months ago.

The three-eyed clan and the four-armed clan added up to more than ten million people. Although they had done a lot of hiding and had scattered their members, they had still noticed something fishy.

“Let’s go and take a look. The two big races have been searching for so long, there must be a treasure!”

One of them said.

“Let’s Go!”

More than ten people moved and immediately followed behind and entered.

“Three-eyed clan leader, can you find the route?”

At the front of the two big races, ten million people entered.

The four-armed clan leader, who was sitting cross-legged on the lotus, looked around and said to the three-eyed clan leader.

“Let me check it out!”

The three-eyed clan leader nodded, and the pitch-black eyes between his eyebrows looked at the world coldly.

Under his gaze, everything was deathly white.

“I’ve found traces of your four-armed clan. Follow Me!”

The three-eyed clan leader said faintly. The one-eyed rhinoceros immediately galloped forward and flew towards the planet in the eight desolation six directions.

…

“Dragon King! They have already entered the eight desolation six directions and are flying towards our direction. TSK TSK, I have to say that the abilities of this race in the universe are really strong. They actually know our direction!”

At this moment, Wang Xian and the rest were standing on a piece of void meteorite not far away from the two tribes.

An lie teleported over and reported the situation!

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and revealed an extremely cold expression.

“Heaven Formation, how is the formation set up?”

Wang Xian asked the Heaven Formation at the side.

“Dragon King, we can definitely set up the formation before they arrive. However, the formation that I set up will collapse once it is attacked by two to three level seven celestial thearch powerhouses!”

The Heaven Formation said.

“It’s enough to trap the rest of the members of the two tribes. Those level seven celestial thearch powerhouses don’t have the chance to attack the formation!”

Wang Xian said faintly.

“Hehe, with the strength of a level six celestial thearch, don’t even think about breaking our seal!”

The Heaven Formation smiled and revealed a look of confidence.

“Trap them and leave it to me alone!”

Wang Xian stood there quietly. The Five Elements Millstone turned into a crown and was placed on his head. The Yin-yang dragon coiled around him.

Time passed little by little.

Tian Chen stood behind Wang Xian and waited as well.

Not long after, an army of over ten million people appeared in their sight.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and they sparkled.

The black eyes on the forehead of the three-eyed tribe leader were staring ahead. When he saw the two figures standing on the meteorite, his black pupils fluctuated slightly.

“There’s someone ahead!”

The three-eyed clan leader said indifferently.

“Eh?”

The pupils of the four-armed clan leader slightly contracted, and a blurry figure appeared in his line of sight.

“Does he know that we’re Coming?”

The four-armed clan leader raised his eyebrows and said indifferently.

“Be careful!”

The eyes of the three-eyed clan leader flickered.

The leader of the four-armed race nodded and the group continued to fly forward.

The distance between the two sides was getting closer and closer.

“Eh? There are people in front of us?”

“There are indeed two people. What are they doing standing on the meteorite?”

Soon, the experts of the two races at the back also noticed the two figures in front of them. They revealed curious expressions on their faces and whispered to each other.

“Everyone, may I know why you have come to our resplendent starry sky?”

Wang Xian looked at them and asked calmly.

“Who are you? Are you members of the Dragon Palace in the Resplendent Starry Sky?”

When the three-eyed clan leader heard Wang Xian’s words, he waved his hand and everyone immediately stopped.

The four-armed clan leader also ordered everyone to stop and looked at Wang Xian.

“Yes. Are you here to invade our Dragon Palace?”

Wang Xian continued to ask.

“Were the disciples of my four-armed clan killed by Your Dragon Palace?”

The four-armed clan leader slowly stood up from Bao’s face and asked with killing intent.

“It’s your people who are courting death!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and the incipient Saint Wings appeared on his back.
