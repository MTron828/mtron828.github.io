“The first one!”

When he saw Ao Yao’s sharp claws piercing through the heavily injured immortal king level abyss seed, Wang Xian revealed a smile.

The immortal slaying gourd coupled with Ao Yao’s attack instantly killed an immortal king level 9 abyss seed.

In fact, if Wang Xian was caught off guard and released the immortal slaying gourd, he would be able to kill an immortal King Level 9 abyss seed with just the immortal slaying gourd alone.

However, when Wang Xian made his move, the abyssal seed had already seen it clearly.

Even so, Wang Xian was very satisfied with the effect.

“There are 15 left. Ao Yao, let’s continue hunting the next one!”

Wang Xian moved his body and attacked the immortal king level nine abyssal seed that Ao Qitian was fighting.

It was a human-shaped abyss seed that was similar to the peak-stage immortal King Abyss Seed.

It was about 500 meters in size and its entire body was pitch black. Its ribs were its sharp weapon.

Faced with Ao Qitian’s violent attacks, the level 9 immortal King Abyss Seed did not lose out in the short collision.

Swoosh

At this time, a terrifying flame blade charged straight at it.

Howl Howl Howl

The human shaped seed felt the power of the flame blade, its face filled with fear as it tried to dodge!

“Trying to escape, wishful thinking!”

Ao Qitian looked at the flame blade, the sea calming needle immediately released blood red chains.

The chains went straight for the human-shaped abyssal seed.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

When the human-shaped abyssal seed saw the blood-red chains coming towards it, its eyes were filled with fury.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

In the next moment, its body split apart. Its bones were scattered and it hid in the surroundings.

“Huh?”

When Ao Qitian saw this strange move, he was slightly shocked.

Even Wang Xian had a look of surprise on his face.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

However, at this moment, the Flaming Longsword’s attack still landed on the bones of its body. It penetrated the bones in an instant.

Black blood seeped out from the bones.

“Awoo!”

Its head, which was flying high up, let out a miserable cry.

“Bang!”

The head wanted to escape but a dazzling white light penetrated through its head. Ao yaoyao waved her hand and threw it directly at AO qitian!

“Haha!”

Ao Qitian roared and the ocean-pacifying divine needle landed heavily on it.

The Second Level 9 undying godly monarch abyss seed was dead!

“There are still 14 left.”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes. “Let’s go, the next one!”

He shouted softly and went straight for the Undying Godly monarch abyss seed that Ao Qi was fighting.

“Tie it down!”

Ao Qi followed behind and they shouted at Ao Qi.

“Good!”

Blood-red chains instantly appeared around Ao Qi. The blood-red chains attacked the winged immortal king abyssal seed in front of him.

Boom! Boom! Boom

This time, Wang Xian did not use the immortal sword in the immortal-slaying gourd. Instead, he grabbed at it with his dragon claws.

Ao Qitian’s ocean-pacifying divine needle smashed towards it.

In a four-on-one situation, there were still two berserk dragon species. One of them was able to assassinate a thorny dragon species of the same level. There was no need to waste the immortal sword in the immortal-slaying gourd.

A violent attack was launched, and that Level 9 undying god King Abyss species revealed a terrified expression.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

As it retreated, it wanted to get the support of its surrounding companions. However, the rest of the abyss species were completely tied down.

“Roar Roar Roar Roar Roar!”

20 seconds later, the Third Level 9 undying god King Abyss species died.

“There are still 13 left, Hahaha, kill!”

The victory had been won. Wang Xian’s face was filled with excitement. He led Ao Yao, Ao Qitian and Ao Qi to hunt down the other Level 9 undying godly monarch abyss seeds.

...

“Roar Roar!”

When Wang Xian and the rest were attacking the fourth level undying godly monarch abyss seed, the human-shaped Level 9 undying godly monarch abyss seed cried out for help in fear.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

From above, the peak level immortal King Abyss seed heard the roar from below. Its blood-red eyes looked over and its face was filled with rage.

It waved its arm and an incomparably sharp black rib on its arm instantly attacked Wang Xian and the rest.

“WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH!”

However, the pitch-black rib was intercepted by a thorny monster in mid-air. Dense thorny vines covered it.

On the other side, another thorny monster also stretched out countless thorns, directly enveloping it within a domain.

“Roar Roar!”

The humanoid abyssal seed roared angrily, and with a wave of its arm, the pitch-black ribs on its body extended towards its palm, and the ribs directly turned into a huge sword.

The humanoid monster held a huge sword that was 1,000 meters long, and slashed towards the surrounding thorns.

...

“Sou Sou Sou!”

Dense thorns shot out from all directions, piercing straight at it.

The sky array formed the thorn monsters, every one of them could kill an existence of the same level.

In a 2 against 1 situation, it was even more terrifying.

The countless thorns had no space to Dodge, the pinnacle undying God emperor human shaped abyss species wielded the huge sword and slashed in all directions.

“Peng Peng Peng!”

However after its huge sword sliced through tens of thousands of brambles, the huge sword in its hand was completely covered by the brambles.

“Howl Howl!”

Seeing this scene, the pinnacle human form God King Abyss seed let out a furious howl, the bones on its body instantly scattered, turning into sharp weapons that slashed at the surrounding brambles.

“HM? This Pinnacle Undying God king abyss seed isn’t simple.”

On the Dragon Peak Command platform, Tian Chen watched the battle between the three brambles. Seeing how powerful the pinnacle human God Emperor Abyss seed was, he revealed a shocked expression.

His gaze swept to the side. Compared to the Pinnacle God Emperor Abyss seed that had four pairs of wings, this one was much stronger and stranger.

The other was suppressed by the brambles and the world’s end ruler, this one still had the ability to resist.

“However, that’s all.”

Heaven array muttered. As soon as he finished speaking, his body instantly changed.

A Dragon Wizard with eight dragon heads and arms appeared with a water elemental dragon head. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

With a wave of his arms, four dragon heads and arms flew directly towards the two bramble monsters, disappearing into the bramble.

At the next moment, the bramble monsters surrounding the human-shaped peak god King Abyss species had two strange dragon heads in the middle of them.

The dragon heads were embedded in the brambles, making them look slightly ferocious.

They stared at the pitch-black skeletons of the human-shaped god King’s peak abyss species. Thick brambles attacked the bones and ribs one by one.
