Chapter 1494: Dragon 2 out of 1,494 people

Tian Qing’s call of a handsome man struck the heart of Dui Mu Dazhuang, making him feel comfortable all over.

However, the last sentence was obviously impossible.

Little Goody was not his, so how could he have the right to sell it.

“I’m sorry, beauty, I’m not selling it. I’m really sorry!”

Dui Mu Dazhuang said to the woman.

“That’s such a pity!”

Seeing that Lone Wood Dazhuang rejected her without hesitation, she shook her head in disappointment and reached out her hand to tease him for a while.

Before leaving, she asked again. After Lone Wood Dazhuang rejected her again, she left in disappointment.

“Hey Hey Hey, beautiful ladies, don’t squeeze, don’t squeeze. If anyone really likes little goody, we can leave a way to communicate!”

Tian Qing left, and Dui Dazhuang was once again surrounded by a group of girls who were overflowing with love. At this time, Dui Dazhuang revealed his purpose.

Leaving a way to communicate, he would have a good in-depth exchange in the future. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

If he could marry a girl from a large family, then he would be rich.

Dui Dazhuang was in the middle of the group of girls, talking to each of the girls with a face full of enjoyment. He was chatting cheerfully, wiping his saliva from time to time.

“I forgot to ask what kind of ferocious beast cub it is. If there’s a chance, ask father to buy one for me!”

Tian Qing turned around to look at Dui Dazhuang and shook her head.

“What’s troubling our Miss Tian Qing?”

At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded.

The group of girls looked in the direction of the voice. Twenty to thirty young men were walking towards them.

The leader was a slightly flirtatious young man dressed in red.

His handsome smile and frivolous smile were very attractive to girls.

“It’s nothing. I just met someone I like. Gongsun Ning, are you going to join young master he Yuan’s army today?”

Tian Qing shook her head slightly and asked the young man.

“Yes, I’m going to join young master he Yuan’s army. This is a good opportunity for me!”

Gongsun Ning said with a smile.

“With Gongsun Ning’s strength, no one can beat him in the whole field. I believe Gongsun Ning can become the commander of young master he Yuan’s Army!”

A few girls next to him said to Gongsun Ning in a fawning manner.

“Haha, Thank You for Your Kind Words!”

Gongsun Ning said with a smile.

“I’ll go there and wait for Princess Yaoyao and the others. You Guys Talk First!”

Tian Qing said with a smile and left.

Obviously, she didn’t have any good impression of Gongsun Ning.

“We... Miss Tian Qing, you guys go first. I’ll go right now!”

Gongsun Ning wanted to go with her, but he hesitated and said with a smile.

As he watched Tian Qing leave, his eyes flickered.

“Young Master Gongsun, I believe that you will be able to capture Miss Tian Qing’s heart in no time!”

A young man beside Gongsun Ning said with a smile.

“Of course!”

Gongsun Ning smiled, his eyes flickering with confidence.

He, Gongsun Ning, was the most outstanding young man other than the chosen disciples of the He clan. He had the strength of a peak-stage profound void martial artist.

Among the subordinate forces of the He clan, his Gongsun clan was also considered a top-notch force.

Within the same generation, no one could compare to him, Gongsun Ning.

“What did Miss Tian Qing want just now?”

As Gongsun Ning spoke, his gaze turned towards the group of girls clustered around him. His eyes flickered.

“Oh? Let’s go take a look!”

The group of youths looked over and their gazes landed on Little Rascal.

“It should be this cute vicious Beast Cub!”

The group of youths thought to themselves.

“Eh?”

However, at the last position behind Gongsun Ning and the others, Young Master Dumu looked at Dumu Dazhuang who was surrounded in the middle with a stunned expression.

“This guy!”

His expression changed as he said.

“Dumu Jiang, you know that Kid!”

The youth at the side heard his voice and asked in surprise.

“I know him, he’s my younger brother!”

Dumu Jiang didn’t dare to hide anything when he heard the youth’s question and said with a sullen face.

The youth at the side wasn’t someone he could offend.

“Oh? Really?”

The youth’s eyes reflected light. “Dumu Jiang, if you can bring that Vicious Beast Cub in your younger brother’s hands over to young master Gongsun, Young Master Gongsun will be happy and won’t be short of your benefits in the future!”

“Moreover, I won’t be short of your benefits, Brother Dumu Jiang!”

“Really?”

Dumu Jiang was slightly taken aback. His eyes revealed a hint of excitement as he hurriedly asked.

“Of course!”

The young man patted his shoulder and nodded.

“Haha, Big Brother Zhou, to be honest, this little brother of mine wouldn’t dare not give me what I Want!”

“Wait for me, I’ll bring it to you in a minute!”

Dumu Jiang said as he walked towards Dumu Dazhuang confidently.

When the young man saw this scene, his face was filled with excitement. He hurriedly walked to Gongsun Ning’s side and said softly.

“Oh? Not Bad, not bad!”

When Gongsun Ning heard the young man’s report, he said to him with a face full of praise.

“It’s my honor to be able to do something for young master Gongsun!”

The young man said with a face full of smiles.

“Dui Dazhuang, come here!”

Dui Jiang looked at Dui Dazhuang, who was full of joy, and shouted with a cold face.

“Huh?”

Dui Dazhuang, who was surrounded by a group of girls, was slightly stunned. He looked over with a face full of astonishment, and his face was slightly embarrassed.

“Ladies, I’m Sorry!”

He squeezed out a smile and walked out of the group of girls.

“Big Brother, what’s the matter!”

Dumu Dazhuang walked over with a somewhat embarrassed expression.

“Give me this ferocious beast cub on your body!”

Dumu Jiang said directly with a somewhat impatient expression and reached out his hand to grab little rascal.

“Big Brother, what are you doing?”

Dumu Dazhuang was slightly stunned and hurriedly took a step back. He stared at him and asked with an embarrassed expression.

“You’re giving it to me just because I asked you to? Why? Have you grown a pair of wings?”

Dumu Jiang glared at him with a cold expression.

“Little rascal isn’t mine. It belongs to a friend of mine!”

Dumu Dazhuang shook his head and said with a slightly unpleasant expression.

“I don’t care if it belongs to your friend. Give it to me. Tell your friend!”

Dumu Jiang ignored him and reached out his hand to grab little rascal again.

“No, I’m going to send little rascal to my friend!”

As Dumu Dazhuang spoke, he quickly turned around and walked towards Wang Xian’s seat.

“Huh?”

Dumu Jiang was slightly taken aback. When he saw that Wang Xian dared to reject him, his expression turned cold instantly.

“Dumu Dazhuang, if you don’t want to die, send it to me immediately!”

He growled in a low voice.

However, Dumu Dazhuang ignored him and walked towards Wang Xian.

This made Dumu Jiang’s eyes burn with anger.

“Huh? What’s Wrong?”

At this moment, Gongsun Ning’s voice came from behind, causing Dumu Jiang’s face to stiffen.

“Dumu Jiang, what’s going on? Didn’t you say that you could bring it over in a minute?”

Following that, the young man’s somewhat angry voice was heard.

This caused Dumu Jiang’s expression to change slightly.

“Big Brother Zhou, Young Master Gongsun!”

He hurriedly turned his head and revealed an apologetic smile on his face. “That Vicious Beast’s cub belongs to this younger brother’s friend!”

“Just that friend of his, if I go over, I can directly ask for it. I’ll go over right now!”
