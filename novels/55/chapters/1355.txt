Chapter 1356: 1356 watched as the dynasty was destroyed

“Prepare to die!”

At the north gate of the Imperial City of one leaf, a bitter war broke out.

Hundreds of thousands of people besieged more than a thousand people, but they were completely crushed.

This made one leaf king’s eyes almost pop out of their sockets. Looking at this scene, he let out a roar, and his body surged with seawater.

Above his head, a raging wave that covered an area of about two kilometers slowly gathered.

He raised the water-blue staff in his hand with an angry expression. The staff was about two meters in size and looked extremely heavy.

On the staff, three water spirit pearls were embedded in it.

“Damned thing, I will tell you that invading our one leaf kingdom is your stupidest decision. Today, I will kill you and bury you in the Sea!”

The One Leaf King held his staff with both hands and stared at Wang Xian coldly.

The two of them faced each other from afar. The staff in his hand was connected to the huge waves above his head.

“This... The king is about to make his move. Furthermore, His Majesty’s strongest attack is the wave forward thrust!”

“Even with hundreds of thousands of us, we are not his opponent. If the king does not make his move, he will lose. How can his opponent’s strength be so terrifying?”

“All of them have the strength of at least rank 9 transcendents, as well as that terrifying assassin. However, if the king makes a move, he will definitely be able to turn the tide!”

“That’s only natural. His Majesty is one of the strongest experts within a thousand kilometers. He isn’t someone a young man can deal with!”

When the one leaf king’s cold voice rang out and the dharma idol in the sky condensed, the eyes of the citizens in the Imperial City of the one leaf continent behind him flickered as they stared at him.

They were somewhat shocked by the strength of these 1,000 plus creatures.

Seeing the generals of the dynasty being killed and the soldiers being crushed, each and every one of them had an extremely unsightly expression.

However, it was fortunate that His Majesty the King was still there.

Everyone in the Imperial City knew of King One Leaf’s strength. He was the most powerful existence among the surrounding dozen or so countries.

“If the king makes a move, he will definitely be able to turn the tide!”

All the citizens at the back were filled with absolute confidence. They clenched their fists and stared at him.

“Dharma Idol, wave front thorn, prepare to die, you little thief!”

The king of one leaf slowly floated in the air. The waves that covered a radius of two kilometers above his head slowly condensed into a long spear.

It was a long spear that was at least one to two thousand meters long.

He raised his staff with both hands and a terrifying water energy burst out from his body. he shouted loudly, “Charge!”

With a loud shout, the terrifying water energy spear shot towards Wang Xian like a huge siege weapon.

“Die!”

The one leaf king’s expression was extremely ferocious. His eyes were filled with ferocity.

Behind him, nearly a million people were staring at the attack of His Majesty. There were also many people on the battlefield looking over.

If the King could defeat the leader of this force, then they would have won this war.

Everyone firmly believed that their one leaf king would definitely win. Their one leaf king was invincible!

“I’ve said it, you don’t have the right to make me attack!”

“Since you want to die, then die!”

The king’s hand looked at the terrifying dharma idol in the sky that was attacking him. His expression was still incomparably calm.

Looking at the one leaf king, his expression was filled with disdain.

“PFFT!”

Just as he finished his sentence, the one-leaf king who was floating in the sky trembled.

Following that, under everyone’s shock, they saw their king.

The head of the King who was invincible in their hearts flew straight into the sky.

His eyes were wide open and filled with disbelief.

There were no signs at all. No one could see who was the one who attacked.

The spear attack from the Dharma Idol arrived two meters in front of Wang Xian. The terrifying piercing light dissipated instantly.

The corpse fell towards the city wall. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Everyone was stunned!

What was going on? The king was killed before the king’s attack even arrived?

Stunned and shocked!

“Boom!”

“No, how is this possible? The King... His Majesty the King... Who Killed Him?”

“What’s going on? What’s going on? Why Did His Majesty the King suddenly die?”

“Assassin, it was the assassin who attacked just now. Oh My God, the King actually died!”

After a short period of silence, the millions of people behind exploded with incomparable fear.

Under the illumination of the Sun, their king’s head flew up directly, and that terrifying impact force went straight into their hearts.

Everyone’s bodies trembled, and they all roared in shock.

“What? Your Majesty... Your Majesty...”

In the sky, a void interpretation expert from the one leaf continent dynasty felt their king’s death, and his body trembled.

Instant Kill?

Their king was a peak void interpretation tier 4 expert, yet he was killed in an instant.

Just how terrifying was the assassin hidden in the Void?

Furthermore, there was also that young man standing in front of the Dragon Throne, the leader of this group of forces.

The morale of the army was in Chaos!

When the team leaders and sergeants were assassinated just now, the morale of the army had already been shaken.

Now, the morale of the army was in Chaos!

“Take This!”

At this moment, a violent sound rang out in the sky.

“Bang!”

The sound of a terrifying collision was heard.

Ao qitian held the sea-pacifying needle in his hand, and the 100-meter-long metal rod directly smashed into the body of an elder at the third level of the insightful void tier.

The violent impact force caused the elder at the third level of the insightful void tier to fall directly toward the city wall.

“Boom!”

With a loud sound, the old man’s body was completely smashed into the city wall.

“Kill!”

A violent roar came from Ao Qitian’s mouth. His figure moved and he rushed to the front of Ao Qi, joining hands to fight against another expert at the third rank of the profound void tier.

The death of the king and the death of the third rank of the profound void tier expert were the prelude to the destruction of the one leaf continent’s dynasty.

At this moment, the second round of assassinations of the strange demons had begun.

With more than 200 strange demons assassinating them, more than half of the top-tier combat strength on the battlefield would be lost.

“It’s over, it’s over, our one leaf continent empire is over!”

Seeing this scene, the millions of people behind them had terrified and desperate expressions on their faces.

“Ahhhh!”

On the battlefield, Ao Yao began to move.

As a fully formed thorned dragon species, his strength could kill a person two levels above him.

As a third-level void interpretation, he could assassinate a fifth-level void interpretation.

Currently, in the Dragon Palace, Ao Yao’s strength was only second to Wang Xian.

After ao Yao made his move, there was no need for Wang Xian to make a move on the entire battlefield.

One by one, experts at the void interpretation level died. One by one, experts from the one leaf continent Empire died under the hands of the Dragon Palace.

The terrifying roar of the demon monkey, the violent thunder and lightning of the thunder shrimp, the piercing of sharp swords, and the deadly arrows.

The members of the Dragon Palace were like a powerful army that had never been defeated in a hundred battles. They charged forward fiercely.

Close combat, long-range attacks, support, Poison!

The army and experts of the one leaf mainland dynasty fell rapidly. Panic spread to the entire imperial city.

Wang Xian stood quietly in front of the Dragon Palace. He smiled as he looked at his subordinates who were killing in all directions in an awe-inspiring manner.

Smiling as he looked at his enemies who were filled with fear and despair.

Smiling as he looked at the destruction of the dynasty!

Smiling as he looked at the rise of the storm!
