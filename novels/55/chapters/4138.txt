Translator: 549690339

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The impact of the energy and the mighty power continued to roar within the Divine Light Bell.

The Light Attribute Heavenly Yuan creation Holy Father’s eyes were burning as he continuously bombarded Lin Niu.

After fighting for more than 20 hours, he could already sense that Lin Niu was not his match.

Especially in the beginning of the life-and-death battle. Although he was injured, he still held the upper hand.

This made his heart filled with excitement.

Even if he was heavily injured, he had to take this heavenly yuan destiny treasure away today.

He had to bring it back to his own universe.

In that case, his strength would be greatly increased.

He would have nothing to fear in the face of the arrival of the calamity.

The battle continued to erupt.

Tianci, who was on top of Lin Niu, lay on top of him, his face still full of shock.

He could only see the vast energy around him.

He felt like a leaf in the sea.

He could die at any time.

Now, he also understood his current situation.

Tianci was a smart person.

According to what he knew, he had a clear understanding of himself.

There had been invaders from other universes in the six paths universe 100 million years ago.

His grandfather had even been recruited to join a team that hunted invaders.

Even the three lords of the six paths universe couldn’t do anything to these invaders. One could imagine their strength.

He also knew the purpose of these intruders entering the six paths universe.

It was to seize a treasure of the six paths universe.

As for what treasure it was, the disciples of the Great Beings of the six paths universe didn’t know.

Now, he understood that he was that treasure.

Once he was discovered, he would be killed, and the treasure in his body would also be taken away.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

This caused his body to tremble.

“No Wonder Godfather didn’t allow me to reveal my wood attribute. No wonder godfather placed a seal on my body.”

Tianci understood.

He looked at the bleeding Lin Niu and his expression changed.

“Uncle Xiao Niu, should we escape? You’re injured! ”

Tianci said to Lin Niu!

“Don’t Worry! ”

Lin Niu transmitted his voice to him and continued to face the attacks in front of him.

“Roar! Roar! ”

After dozens of minutes, Lin Niu suddenly roared!

“If you want to fight with me, then let’s see who will live and who will die today!

Lin Niu instantly went berserk and no longer passively continued to defend.

All kinds of symbols shot out from the scales all over his body. These symbols turned into strange and terrifying phantoms.

Each of these phantoms was like a demonic god.

“Hahaha, good, good, good. Then let’s fight to the death, Haha! ”

Seeing that Lin Niu wanted to fight to the death with him, the holy father laughed maniacally.

His eyes emitted a luster as he directly faced Lin Niu, completely engaging in close combat.

“Boom, Boom, Boom! ”

Lin Niu and Lin Niu exchanged blows. The terrifying energy impacted the flesh and blood of both sides.

In less than five minutes, wounds appeared on their bodies!

Based on this intense battle, it wouldn’t be long before the victor would be decided!

Buzz

However, at this moment, a figure flew over quickly from the outside!

Wang Xian stood at the front and looked ahead. His eyes were sparkling.

“An old-fashioned powerhouse of the Heaven’s origin creation. He is slightly stronger than the Unicorn Ox. If I add myself and the five elements grinding, I should be able to kill him! ”

Wang Xian mumbled.

His gaze focused and his pupils were flickering with grey energy.

“This divine bell with light attributes is actually a broken fragment of the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin creation.”

Wang Xian looked at the divine bell.

The Ultimate Treasure of Tianyuan was not something that could not be destroyed.

It was at the control level and the Great Dao level. If one continuously attacked a ultimate treasure of Tianyuan, it could also be destroyed.

This was especially so for the ultimate treasure of Tianyuan that had yet to reach its peak.

The Ultimate Treasure of Tianyuan could be said to be the same as the powerhouses of Tianyuan. It could also be defeated.

However, the difference was that the ultimate treasure of Tianyuan could only be destroyed and not completely destroyed.

The Shattered Ultimate Treasure of the Heaven’s origin still contained some power.

If he could find all the fragments and nurture them with a large amount of time and energy, he could still recover!

Whoosh

In the next instant, Wang Xian arrived above the divine bell of light.

With a wave of his hand, the five elements millstone appeared at the side.

The star field fragment and the book of Water Forbidden Spell, two ultimate treasure fragments of the Heaven’s origin origin origin, also appeared in his hand.

Boom

In the next instant, Wang Xian controlled the star field fragment and the Book of water curse to attack the Divine Bell.

At the same time, the five elements grinding mill also unleashed a powerful attack and attacked the Divine Bell!

Boom

The sudden attack caused a huge crack to appear on the defensive barrier set up by the Divine Bell.

Furthermore, the energy barriers in other places started to collapse!

“Pu, not good, there are other heaven origin creation realm experts coming!”

At this moment, the Holy Father who was fighting with Lin Niu suddenly felt

that the Divine Bell’s defense had been broken.

The Divine Bell suffered a huge attack and its expression changed drastically. It couldn’t help but spit out blood.

The Divine Bell had been nurtured by him and was one with him. If it was heavily injured, its main body would also be injured.

Just like how heaven bestowed took away the Heavenly Yuan creation treasure in his body, it also represented the end of his life!

“Roar Roar, die! ”

Lin Niu’s eyes shone with light, and the horn on his head emitted blood-red energy as it directly charged towards him!

“Stop, there’s an external heavenly yuan creation expert. If You Fight Me, you won’t have a good ending either!”

The Holy Father saw the unicorn ox charging towards him. Due to the impact of the Divine Bell, his original body was also affected.

This made him look extremely embarrassed.

In such a short period of time, there was actually a powerhouse of the Heaven’s origin destiny realm who discovered this place.

His luck was simply terrible to the extreme!

“Kill!

However, at this moment, an ice-cold voice entered his ears.

In the air, after Wang Xian broke through the defense of the god Bell, his arm immediately turned into a dragon claw.

The terrifying Dragon Claw carried destructive energy as it clawed at his body!

Close combat!

Wang Xian also engaged in close combat. He was fighting with his life on the line!

“Oh no, are you guys together?”

When he saw Wang Xian attacking him directly, a look of shock and anger appeared on his face.

He didn’t expect the unicorn ox to have a helper.

Scram! ”

He growled and waved the staff in his hand.

The sharp thorns on the staff were like laser beams as they charged towards Wang Xian.

Wang Xian didn’t Dodge at all. His dragon claws continued to attack!

At the back, the five elements grinding ground. The heads of the five divine dragons were intertwined together and formed a five-colored divine dragon head.

The Divine Dragon Head attacked this light attribute heavenly fate powerhouse!
