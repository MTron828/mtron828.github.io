Chapter 301: Call Daddy! (3)

“Zhou Qingkong, are you sure you want me to scram?!”

The middle-aged man slapped cold words on that young man, embarrassing him instantly. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The young man looked malevolent as he glared at Zhou Qingkong.

“Hur?” Zhou Qingkong squinted his eyes slightly as he peered at that young man with flickering eyes. Subsequently, he clenched his teeth to show his determination. “I said, get lost, and you better do it now!”

“Fu*k you, Zhou Qingkong. Do you think I’m scared of you just because you’re an Inborn Expert? Feng Family didn’t annihilate you, so you want Yuan Family to do it?”

The young man burst into outrage as soon as he heard Zhou Qingkong. He pointed at him and chided with an extremely arrogant attitude.

Even though he knew Zhou Qingkong was an Inborn Expert, he did not show the slightest fear. Obviously, his backing was somewhat powerful.

“Hehe, I want you to get out now. You jolly well should do so. Annihilate me? Stop bragging, lad!”

Zhou Qingkong spoke to the young man with a sullen face. He knew which side he should be on by now.

“Fine, you...”

The young man was morose and his face was flushed with redness. He pointed at Zhou Qingkong with constantly changing expressions. “Zhou Qingkong, you better watch out. If I don’t destroy your hotel today, I, Yuan Fei, will tarnish my own reputation in Shang Jing!”

“Didn’t you hear me asking you to get out?”

Zhou Qingkong gradually turned gloomy when he saw Yuan Fei’s behavior, encompassing him with a tyrannical oppression.

“Five minutes. Just you wait.”

Yuan Fei felt the magnitude of Zhou Qingkong’s imposing demeanor. His face paled, he gritted his teeth, and spoke ferociously.

Then, he turned to Wang Xian and his gang with icy-cold eyes. “And you guys too. Just you wait. I’ll show you what it takes to provoke me!”

“Let’s go!”

He then turned and spoke to Ling Yi and the other two people next to him while he dug out his phone exasperatedly.

“Hmph!”

Zhou Qingkong was slightly embarrassed. He took a deep breath and turned to look at Guan Shuqing again. “Miss, it’s my honor that you stay in our hotel. I hope you have a pleasant rest today!”

“Thank you, Director Zhou!”

Guan Shuqing was delighted on her face as she expressed her gratitude when Director Zhou went all out to offend the young man in their defense.

“You’re welcome. Miss, which room are you staying in? I’ll show you the way!” Director Zhou said quickly.

“It’s okay. We can go over ourselves!” Guan Shuqing shook her head.

“It’s nothing. It’s my pleasure to serve you!”

Director Zhou shook his head in a hurry as he led them ahead.

Manager Sun, behind him, was a little dumbfounded as he stared at his boss with doubts on his face.

Who was that girl such that his boss did not hesitate to offend Yuan Family?

Wang Xian, Xiao Yu, and the rest went into the president suite.

Boom boom!

After Wang Xian placed his things on the table, Elder Fang opened the window for ventilation, and they could hear the roaring of engines outside.

Smash!

Subsequently, the shattering of the glass window was heard.

“Hur?”

Wang Xian, Guan Shuqing, Xiao Yu, and the rest were slightly stunned as they went to the window immediately.

“What a line-up!”

Elder Fang looked outside with a surprised look. “It’s Shang Jing, indeed, with daring people stomping over the hotel of an Inborn Expert!”

At this time, more than a score of supercars were gathered at the hotel entrance.

Each of the supercars was vrooming loudly with unruly young men standing in front of them. They were gazing at the hotel before them with arrogance.

The engine sound from earlier had been from one of the supercars crashing into the hotel rampantly.

Arrogance above anyone else!

“Zhou Qingkong, you son of a bitch. Get your ass out here. Those whores, too!”

A familiar conceited voice was heard, stunning Wang Xian and the rest as they exchanged gazes.

“Let’s go down together,” Wang Xian told Xiao Yu and Guan Shuqing immediately with a stern face.

“How dare he scold us!”

The girls were infuriated with that young man’s cockiness and swollen head.

They put down their stuff and headed downstairs.

Bam!

However, when they reached the lobby, a figure was sent flying to their faces.

He spat out a mouthful of blood with a face as white as a sheet.

“Director Zhou!”

Guan Shuqing was aghast as she exclaimed. She hurriedly walked over and checked on him.

“I’m fine!”

As soon as Director Zhou saw Guan Shuqing arrived at the lobby, he revealed a smile on his pale-looking face. At the same time, a hint of doubt flashed in his eyes.

“Haha, how dare you agitate my buddy? Zhou Qingkong, are you sick of living?”

A disdainful and complacent voice was heard.

The hotel door was knocked down entirely, with a sports car crashing into the sofa in the lobby.

Yuan Fei stood beside it, and he did not feel sorry for the luxurious car that had crashed.

With his chin lifted up, he stared at Zhou Qingkong disdainfully. When he noticed Wang Xian and his gang were walking out, his face turned cold with a taunting look.

All the luxury sports cars had already blocked the entrance of the hotel.

More than a score of cars were parked at the entrance. A young man was sitting in a limited-edition sports car at the center, and he had crossed his legs with a smile as he remarked just now.

Beside that young man stood a domineering middle-aged man. Obviously, he was the one who had struck just now.

Apart from that middle-aged man, in every sports car sat a young man with taunting looks.

They wore branded goods, drove branded cars...the typical rich second-generation who had strong backings.

Other than this group of affluent young men, several middle-aged men and elders were around with several Inborn Experts amongst them.

Such a force was daunting.

“You guys came out. Haha, I’ll make sure you kneel over here for the entire night!”

Yuan Fei took a look at Wang Xian and the gang with a stone-cold face.

He was so conceited that, in his eyes, he had high regard for no one.

“He’s quite something. No wonder he was such a rich idiot in Shang Jing. They really must have some backings if nobody dares to go against them.”

Wang Xian observed Yuan Fei and turned his attention to the rest of the young men and two Inborn Experts at the door. Finally, he fixed his eyes on the young man at the center who had spoken just now.

“His last name is Sui? Is he from Sui Huang’s family?”

Upon recalling what that young man had said, he whispered to Xiao Yu, Lan Qingyue, and Guan Shuqing next to him. All of them froze for a moment.

“If that’s the case, it’d be interesting!”

Xiao Yu exhibited a teasing look as he looked at the young man in the sports car at the center position. With a smile, he said, “Hey, lad in the middle. Your nanny is here. If you’re not paying your respects, then what are you waiting for?”

Boom!

Xiao Yu’s words struck all the young men in the sports car dumbfoundedly almost immediately.

How dare a lass speak to Sui Ao in such a manner. Tired of living?

The young man in the middle was slightly stunned as he looked at Xiao Yu, Lan Qingyue, Guan Shuqing, and Elder Fang. With a smirk drawn at the corner of his lips, he sneered.

“Tell me. What do you think of asking them to crawl over to lick my shoes and call me daddy?”
