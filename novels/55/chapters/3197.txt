Chapter 3198: 3197 caught them all in one go

“We’re not his match!”

“A universe Knight Level 4, he’s a universe Knight Level 4, he can easily suppress us.”

Seeing that the ancient painting and the Golden Dragon Pearl were useless, sensing the terrifying strength of the Dragon Palace Dragon King, the ancient painting sect leader Tian long gong and the others trembled violently.

They wanted to escape, but by this time, it was too late.

!!

“Ah Ah Ah!”

At this time, screams sounded from below. They heard the screams and immediately looked over with their eyes wide open.

As far as their eyes could see, they saw the willow leaves swiftly piercing through the universe Knight Level 2 warriors.

Under the terrifying attack of the willow leaves, the universe knight level 2 warriors couldn’t resist at all.

What kind of terrifying attack was this?

“Universe Knight Level 4, Dragon Palace has another universe knight at Level 4!”

Their bodies started to tremble, and their hearts were filled with despair.

How could they defend against two universe knights at Level 4?

“No, no, it’s only been three years, how can dragon palace improve at such a terrifying speed?”

The ancient art sect leader roared in disbelief.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

At this moment, the shadows of the Holy Dragon, which had only been slightly blocked, completely landed on the ground.

Their bodies trembled violently as they fell towards the ground.

Although they didn’t die, they were still severely injured.

“Dragon Tomb, you can die now!”

At this moment, Wang Xian came to the sky above them and waved his dragon claws gently.

A pitch-black divine dragon that was emitting Earth and darkness attributes appeared and coiled around them.

At the moment of the entanglement, it took the shape of a coffin and suppressed them inside.

“No, no, no, don’t kill us. We are willing to submit, submit!”

A desperate voice came out of the Heavenly Dragon Duke’s mouth. His body trembled as he begged for mercy.

“Bang!”

However, at this moment, the coffin slowly closed. What awaited them was destruction.

“Not good, not good. Our sect master and the others have been killed!”

When the sect master and the others’life force disappeared, a terrified voice came from the side.

Hearing this voice, everyone from the ancient art sect panicked.

The surroundings were covered in clouds and mist. They couldn’t see far at all.

Now, they could only feel that the powerful warriors of the Dragon Palace were slaughtering the venerables of their ancient art sect.

The screams were incessant.

Until now, they still couldn’t understand why the Dragon Palace suddenly erupted with such terrifying strength.

Why did the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace suddenly appear.

Wasn’t he killed by the Sky Dragon King?

“Leave no disciple of the two races alive!”

The seven universe knights were suppressed by Wang Xian. With a wave of his arm, the clouds dispersed and he shouted coldly.

“Kill!”

When the clouds dispersed completely, all the disciples of the Sky Dragon Clan of the ancient painting sect saw the scene around them.

In the middle, a huge coffin stood in the sky.

The sect leader of the ancient painting sect, the Sky Dragon Mother and the other universe knights had disappeared.

In the surrounding area, the level 2 universe knights from the two powers had all been killed.

There were less than 50 Level 1 universe Knight Disciples.

When the disciples from the two powers saw this scene, their eyes revealed a look of extreme fear.

“This… how is this possible!”

One of the disciples roared in disbelief.

In such a short period of time, almost all of their great beings had been killed. How could it be so terrifying.

“Leave no one alive. Keke, Keke, little ones, kill everyone from the two large factions for me.”

Ba Qi’s body was covered in blood as he roared with a ghastly face.

He had injured himself in the previous battle. This time, he wanted to let everyone from the two large factions know what fear was.

“Boom!”

His entire body emitted a might. The terrifying dragon might caused the heaven dragon clan’s disciples to tremble. Their faces were filled with panic.

They widened their eyes and were filled with shock.

Some of the Heavenly Dragon clan members who were below level five Emperor God realm did not even have the strength to resist under this terrifying pressure.

“Kill!”

The disciples of the Dragon Palace were filled with killing intent as they charged toward the disciples of the ancient painting sect, the Heavenly Dragon Clan.

“Don’t Kill Us, don’t Kill Us!”

When the disciples of the two forces saw that more than half of their knights had been killed, their faces were filled with terror and despair. They wanted to submit.

Hong

However, at this time, all the disciples of the Dragon Palace, including dozens of knights, had already charged over.

Surrender?

If they could win, they wanted to destroy the Dragon Palace. If they couldn’t win, they wanted to surrender.

How could there be such a good thing in this world.

Waves of terrifying energy engulfed them. Following that, a one-sided massacre began.

If people didn’t invade the Dragon Palace, the Dragon Palace would never invade others.

Since they came to destroy the Dragon Palace, the Dragon Palace would destroy them too.

This was war.

“Hiss, this, this…”

At this moment, the warriors who were observing the situation in the surrounding void space were shocked when they saw this scene.

What was going on? Such a huge change happened in such a short time.

In such a short period of time, more than 100 universe knights were massacred.

Hiss!

This…

After the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace returned, he was actually so terrifying that he turned the tide of the battle in an instant.

Looking at the disciples and powerhouses of the ancient painting sect and the Heavenly Dragon clan being massacred so quickly, their bodies trembled.

From the time Wang Xian and the rest came out to the time when the powerhouses of the two major forces were killed, it had only been a few minutes.

This was a huge suppression of their strength.

Wang Xian didn’t need to make a move in the upcoming battle.

He hovered in the sky above the Dragon Palace and looked at them coldly.

With the willow deity around, the venerables from the two major forces had no room to resist.

The disciples from the two major forces were being slaughtered rapidly.

They were fleeing in a state of collapse, but how could they escape the pursuit of the experts from the Dragon Palace.

The following battle was one-sided.

Wang Xian waved his arm and the two ancient paintings and the golden dragon bead flew towards his hands.

His eyes were sparkling as he looked at the two ancient paintings.

A powerful spiritual treasure with Earth attribute.

It was an extremely powerful existence among acquired spiritual treasures.

He waved his arm and the five elements millstone appeared in his hand. He then started to devour the ancient paintings.

He sized up the two golden dragon beads in his hand and hesitated for a moment. He did not absorb the five elements millstone.

In the surrounding area, there were postnatal numinous treasures beside the corpses of some venerables.

There weren’t many of them, but there were more than twenty of them.

Most of them had five elements attributes.

They could completely make the five elements millstone swallow them.

In addition to these two extremely powerful ancient paintings, the five elements millstone should be able to make a breakthrough.

On the battlefield, the disciples of the two big forces were quickly slaughtered. Ten minutes later, all the disciples of the ancient painting sect and the Heavenly Dragon Clan were killed.

“Dragon King, all of them have been dealt with!”

Prime Minister Gui flew over. His eyes were sparkling.

“Bring half of the Dragon Palace’s venerable level people with you. We will make a trip to the ancient painting sect and the Heavenly Dragon Clan’s Lair!”

Wang Xian said faintly.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com
