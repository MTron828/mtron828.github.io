Chapter 1496: Dragon 4 out of 1,496

“What? Gongsun Ning is actually not a match for that young man!”

“He was defeated in one move, this... that young man’s strength is so terrifying!”

“He actually dared to make a move at young master he Yuan’s birthday banquet, is he courting death?”

“So what if he makes a move? That young man was able to defeat Gongsun Ning, and his strength is at least at the peak of the first level of the profound void tier. With young master he Yuan’s breadth of mind, he might even admire him very much and make him join the army, becoming the commander of the Army!”

Sounds of shock could be heard from the surroundings.

Most of the people present were clear of Gongsun Ning’s strength. Among the younger generation, the only ones who could suppress him were the He clan’s disciples.

Yet now, he was actually easily defeated by someone. This young man who suddenly appeared out of nowhere had monstrous talent.

This time, he would definitely be able to join young master he Yuan’s army.

“HM? What formidable strength. Looks like he should be one of the strong contenders for the position of commander of young master he Yuan’s army this time.”

Not far away, Miss Tian Qing and the others looked in their direction with a surprised expression on their faces.

“Princess Yaoyao is here. Some young elites of the Forest Yaoyao race are here!”

“That beauty, that beauty should be he suiqing of the He Suiqing family, young master he Yuan’s fiancée!”

“Hiss, Princess Yaoyao, miss he suiqing of the He suiqing family of the first-class family, and the elites of the Forest Yaoyao race are all here!”

At this moment, a group of more than ten figures at the entrance attracted everyone’s attention.

They didn’t even pay attention to what was happening here.

Princess Yaoyao walked with a woman in the center of the group of more than ten figures. The elites of the Forest Yaoyao clan were on both sides of the group.

The woman was wearing a pink dress and a shiny necklace around her neck.

She was dressed very nobly.

The woman was chatting with Lin Yaoyao in a low voice with a smile on her face.

The group of people walked forward and made way for them.

“Huh?”

However, when they walked forward, they suddenly saw Gongsun Ning lying on the ground and spitting out blood.

This made Lin Yaoyao and he suiqing slightly stunned.

“What’s going on?”

A young man from the Forest Yaoyao clan frowned and looked at Gongsun Ning on the ground, asking coldly.

“It’s... It’s nothing. Princess Yaoyao, miss he suiqing, it’s nothing, it’s nothing. I just had a simple exchange with someone!”

Gongsun Ning hurriedly stood up and endured the intense pain in his body, smiling with a pale face.

He dared to be arrogant in front of the others, but he didn’t dare to be arrogant in front of Princess Lin Yaoyao and miss he suiqing.

A single word from the two of them could wipe out their entire family.

“Gongsun Ning, your strength is one of the best among the younger generation in the area of the forest ancestor’s land. How could you be defeated so easily?”

A young man from the Forest Yaoyao race smiled and asked curiously.

“I was ambushed. I wasn’t prepared!”

Gongsun Ning braced himself and glanced at Wang Xian’s position. His eyes were filled with anger as he spoke.

He had lost a lot of face today!

Lin Yaoyao and the rest followed Gongsun Ning’s gaze and looked over.

Gongsun Ning could definitely be considered a heaven’s favorite. Someone who could defeat him must be a talent that could be molded.

“Huh?”

“Eh?”

A surprised voice came from Lin Yaoyao and he suiqing.

Lin Yaoyao looked at the young man sitting there in surprise. He looked very familiar.

He Suiqing looked at little rascal curiously.

“Zhi Zhi, PA PA!”

Seeing that someone was staring at him, little rascal also raised his head and patted him. He looked unusually cute.

“What a cute little fellow!”

He suiqing stared at Little Goody with a doting heart. She couldn’t help but walk over.

“Huh?”

Lin Yaoyao saw he suiqing walking over and frowned slightly. She followed closely behind and curled her lips at Wang Xian before following him immediately.

“What a cute little fellow. Is this your pet?”

He suiqing walked over and brought along a fragrant scent. She stared at Little Goody with a face full of affection and asked Wang Xian.

“This guy’s luck is really good. He actually caught the attention of miss he suiqing!”

“Ah, I’m really envious. If I had known earlier, I would have gotten a cute pet too. As long as that young man fawns over miss he suiqing a little, that kid will be rich in the future!”

“That’s right. Miss he suiqing is the most beloved daughter of the He Suiqing family head. Furthermore, she is going to marry young master he yuan in the future. As long as miss he suiqing says the word, that kid will have a bright future!”

“As long as he hands that pet to miss he suiqing, young master he yuan will owe him a favor in the future. Oh My God!”

When the crowd saw he suiqing walking towards Wang Xian and looking at the pet with a face full of love, they were all envious.

Even Gongsun Ning was looking at it with a face full of envy and passion.

How great would it be if that pet was his!

Miss he suiqing, her status was much higher than Princess Lin Yaoyao’s.

Once she fawned on her, she would have a bright future!

“Okay!”

Wang Xian took a glance at he suiqing. Hearing the discussions around him, he took a few more glances. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

He Yuan’s fiancée, not bad, not bad!

“Can you sell this pet to me, or can I exchange it with something?”

He Suiqing looked at little rascal with some fondness and couldn’t help but ask.

At the side, Lin Yaoyao stared at Wang Xian.

She had a deep impression of this young man. After all, he was the only one who dared to reject him.

When she saw that he suiqing wanted to buy his pet, she looked at him curiously.

“I’m sorry, I’m not selling it!”

Wang Xian shook his head without any hesitation.

He suiqing was stunned. Everyone around was stunned as well!

Dui Dazhuang covered his face with his hand and walked to Wang Xian’s side hurriedly.

“Brother Wang Xian, miss he suiqing, the eldest daughter of the first-class he suiqing family, the fiancée of young master he yuan. Her future status is honorable. Uncle, you should think about it carefully!”

Dui Dazhuang said to Wang Xian with a flushed face.

Once he gave the pet to this young lady, he would be rich!

Damn it. These few days, when he saw Wang Xian’s temper, he was a little afraid!

“Huh?”

When he suiqing heard that Wang Xian rejected him directly, she was obviously stunned. She didn’t expect that this young man would reject her.

“Your strength is not bad. If you give this pet to me, I will ask Xiao Yuan to make you the commander. How about that?”

“If it really doesn’t work, I’ll give you some more things!”

He suiqing said with a frown.

“Hu!”

When the surrounding youths heard he suiqing’s words, their breathing quickened, and their eyes shone with a fiery luster.

Commander, what did they come here for? To join young master he Yuan’s army.

Now miss he suiqing directly promised him a corps leader. This was simply a meteoric rise. Everyone knew what this corps leader meant in the future.

Not to mention, there were some other things!

“Not for sale!”

However, to everyone’s astonishment, the cold voice of refusal came again!
