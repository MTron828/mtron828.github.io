Chapter 1358: Lord Wang 1358 had arrived

“Let’s go, back to the Palace!”

A majestic voice resounded in the sky. Nine Dragons swayed their huge bodies as they flew into the sky.

“Roar Roar!”

With a roar, they increased their speed and flew into the sky.

Below, all the citizens of the one leaf continent dynasty looked at the thousand something creatures flying into the sky with ugly expressions. Their eyes were filled with helplessness.

In less than half a day, all the valuable items in the imperial city had been taken away.

All the treasures in the families had been taken out.

Boom! Boom! Boom

As the people of the Dragon Palace flew, the members of the Dragon Palace who had gone to other cities flew back and followed behind them toward the Dragon Palace.

The Flames of war covered the entire dynasty. With the return of the members of the Dragon Palace, the one leaf continent dynasty would enter a new era.

Perhaps it could be rebuilt, or perhaps it would disappear completely in the future.

“Xiao Xian, how is it?”

Upon returning to the Dragon Palace, Guan Shuqing and the other girls came up to welcome him.

“Returning with a full load!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly and said with a smile.

He waved his arm and threw the interspatial ring in his hand to Prime Minister Gui who was beside him.

“Prime Minister Gui, you handle all the resources. First, increase the strength of the members of the Dragon Palace. Then, clean up the surroundings and see if you can recruit new members!”

Wang Xian instructed him.

There were still too few members of the Dragon Palace at the moment. More than 3,000 subordinates were considered a small number even for a low-level dynasty.

If it was not for the fact that the top-tier combat strength of the one leaf continent dynasty was relatively strong, the dragon palace might not be able to win in a real battle.

The hundreds of thousands of people could defeat the Dragon Palace with a huge number.

After obtaining the resources of the entire dynasty, all the members of the Dragon Palace were at least at the half-step void interpretation realm.

There would be more than ten or twenty void interpretation experts.

However, it would be difficult for the group of leaders to get another upgrade.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded respectfully and left immediately.

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the Dragon Palace which covered an area of 150 kilometers. Finally, he landed on a few girls and chuckled.

He had left for a year and had yet to have a good time with them after he returned.

His body moved and, amidst the exclamations of the girls, he flew straight into the bedroom.

Xiao Yu, who was at the side, rolled her eyes. Zhang Fengying was stunned and shook her head slowly.

In the next few days, Wang Xian lived a happy and unrestrained life.

Prime Minister Gui would take care of the matters in the Dragon Palace. He could just accompany a few girls on the collapse every day.

They lived a carefree life.

Under the huge amount of resources, the cultivation of the few girls was directly elevated to the second level of the profound void stage.

“Dragon King, this is our herb garden. There are more than 50,000 spiritual herbs in there. The highest level is the transcendent level nine spiritual herb!”

“Ba Qi brought AO qitian and the rest to the surroundings to subdue some demonic beast races. The area of 150 kilometers of our Dragon Palace’s territory is currently not used in many places!”

After resting for three to four days, Wang Xian and Prime Minister Gui toured the entire Dragon Palace.

Prime Minister Gui introduced them to him one by one.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded slowly. The area of 150 kilometers was very, very large. On the other hand, the Dragon Palace only had over 3,000 creatures. Compared to this space, it was simply too little!

“Brother!”

At this moment, Xiao Yu flew over from the Dragon King’s palace and shouted at him.

“Eh? What’s wrong? Xiao Yu!”

Wang Xian looked over and asked with a smile.

“Brother, Ling Tian... is Sister Fengluan in trouble!”

Xiao Yu flew to his side and said to him with a frown.

“In trouble? What Happened?”

Wang Xian immediately asked.

“Ling Tian’s communication stone plate told me that the Dragon and Phoenix Empire is currently at war with the star-moon Empire and a few other empires. The armies of the other empires are rushing over. The Dragon and Phoenix Empire is currently in a crisis!”

“Sister Fengluan asked Ling Tian to return to the Dragon Palace. She will not allow him to participate in the following battles. I think sister Fengluan will not allow Ling Tian to return unless it is a crisis!”

Xiao Yu said to Wang Xian worriedly.

During the period when Wang Xian had just left, Fengluan had basically stayed in the Dragon Palace to cultivate. As time passed, the group of girls became more familiar with each other. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

After the Dragon Palace discovered the deep sea spiritual spring, the dragon-phoenix Empire had also attracted a large number of citizens. Therefore, the chances of them meeting each other were limited.

“I’ll go over and take a look!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and flew out directly.

Ao Jian led a golden swordfish behind him immediately. As the Dragon King’s guards, they had to follow the Dragon King at all times.

“He actually sent Feng Lingtian back to the Dragon Palace. It seems that the situation is extremely critical!”

Wang Xian flew quickly in the ocean. Due to the migration of the Dragon Palace, it would take at least 20 minutes to travel to the Dragon and Phoenix Empire.

Whoosh

When he arrived at the seaside, Wang Xian flew straight towards the dragon and Phoenix city.

“Who is that in front of me? Stop right there!”

A cold voice was heard. Beams of sharp light pierced straight into the sky.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned as he looked towards the city wall.

At this moment, rows of soldiers were scattered on the city wall. They were dressed in armor and emitted a murderous aura.

When he saw Wang Xian, Ao Jian and the other two, he shouted coldly.

“It seems that many people in the dragon and Phoenix Empire don’t recognize themselves after a year. That’s right. The population of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire is more than 10 million now. It’s seven to eight times more than before. Many new people won’t recognize themselves!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. He stopped in the air and swept his gaze across the surroundings. he shouted indifferently, “I’m Wang Xian!”

“Wang Xian?”

On the city wall, an old man’s eyes revealed a look of surprise. However, he followed up with a cold gaze as he stared ahead. “No matter who you are, the dragon-phoenix royal city has been sealed off...”

“Wang Xian, it’s Lord Wang. It’s Lord Wang!”

Before the old man could finish his sentence, a young man’s excited voice could be heard from the surroundings.

“Eh?”

The old man was slightly shocked as he looked at the captain.

“Lord Gu, it’s Lord Wang, a friend of Her Majesty the Queen. I didn’t expect Lord Wang to Come!”

The young captain looked at the old man and said hurriedly.

“Lord Wang, I didn’t expect Lord Wang to come. Is he here to help our dragon-phoenix Empire?”

“He must be. This city was conquered by Lord Wang to Her Majesty the Queen back then. Furthermore, Lord Wang was the one who sent people here to help tide over the crisis!”

“That’s great. I didn’t expect Lord Wang to be here at this time!”

On the city wall, dozens of soldiers from the past looked excited when they saw Wang Xian.

They still remembered that when this place was still a town, they encountered a terrifying crisis. Lord Wang guarded the city by himself.

He had saved their lives.

They still remembered that when the star-moon dynasty had attacked them, it was Lord Wang who had led the powerful heaven’s Eye Demon Beasts to once again save the entire dragon-phoenix dynasty.

This time, he had definitely come to help them.
