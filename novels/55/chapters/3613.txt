3614 3613, the second netherspirit clone

The situation of Wang Xian’s netherspirit clone was slightly different from that of the Netherworld race!

The energy of Wang Xian’s netherspirit clone came from the ancestral tree.

When Wang Xian improved, the netherspirit clone would absorb the energy of the ancestral tree and directly improve itself!

In other words, there was no need to consume additional resources!

It was also because of this that he captured this expert of the Netherworld race alive and kept him alive!

The soul capturing technique was successfully executed. Waves of information were transmitted into his mind!

“HMM?”

However, at this moment, he felt a strange energy preventing him from detecting more energy!

Furthermore, the body of this expert of the Netherworld race began to distort.

The information that he had detected also started to become chaotic!

“Summon Your Divine Kingdom!”

When Wang Xian saw this scene, he hurriedly gave an order!

Buzz

At this moment, a strange divine kingdom slowly appeared in the Dragon King’s Hall!

When the divine kingdom was summoned, Wang Xian could no longer search for any information!

“Is this the inheritance protection of a peak race? Or is it a unique ability of the netherworld race?”

Wang Xian mumbled. When he invaded the mind of this powerhouse from the Netherworld race, the energy in his body automatically protected him and directly destroyed his consciousness!

Looking at the mass of energy that had lost its consciousness, Wang Xian shook his head and looked at the divine kingdom at the side!

Although he didn’t obtain much information, his main goal this time was to obtain some treasures!

His dragon eyes scanned the entire divine kingdom and soon, treasures flew out one by one!

Divine fruits and herbs with darkness attribute, some special treasures, and some innate spiritual treasures!

They didn’t have any innate treasures!

Other than that, there was something that Wang Xian was familiar with!

Ghost!

A ghost that hadn’t been nurtured yet!

After Wang Xian took it out, a strange and incorporeal child appeared!

“Drink, drink, drink!”

He let out a sinister voice and stared at Wang Xian with his blood-red eyes!

With his previous experience, Wang Xian brought the ghost to the front of the ancestral tree.

Just like the last time, the Little Netherworld Ghost flew to the branch of the ancestral tree’s soul-returning tree. Its blood-red eyes stared at a soul-returning fruit as it opened its mouth to bite it.

Buzz

The soul-returning fruit entered his mouth, causing his body to emit gray energy.

“HMM?”

However, at this moment, a message from the ancestral tree was transmitted over!

According to the information from the ancestral tree, the current ancestral tree could only increase the strength of a netherworld ghost without any burden for the time being!

In other words, even though Wang Xian had improved, the Netherworld Ghost had also improved. However, it could only support one!

In the future, when the ancestral tree grew bigger, it would be able to support more. Now, if Wang Xian wanted the Netherworld Ghost Avatar again, he would need to provide the resources himself!

This made him slightly enlightened!

“The ancestral tree is the most important. Naturally, I can’t delay the advancement of the ancestral tree for the sake of an Netherworld Ghost Avatar.”

He mumbled and commanded the soul-returning tree branch to wrap around this Netherworld Ghost!

“Ahhhh!”

A terrifying and ear-piercing sound came from the Netherworld Ghost’s mouth. He was slowly wrapped by the soul-returning tree and was soon completely wrapped up.

A humanoid soul-returning fruit was formed.

This humanoid shape was exactly the same as the Netherworld Ghost, but it had shrunk by ten times.

It was exactly the same as the last time.

Wang Xian swallowed this netherworld soul-returning fruit and had a thought!

“Weng!”

Two Netherworld ghosts appeared around him. One of them was exactly the same as him while the other was a miniature version of him!

That miniature version had a very weak aura too!

At the level of the void God Emperor.

“It just so happens that I still have that Netherworld Ghost to devour. In addition, my other Netherworld Ghost Avatar still has energy stored in it. I can transfer it to my smaller Netherworld Ghost Avatar!”

He immediately began to operate!

“Boom Boom Boom!”

Very soon, that smaller Netherworld Ghost Avatar began to upgrade!

The speed of upgrading was extremely fast!

However, the consumption of the improvement was also huge. After the Hades expert who had four Hades Ghost Avatars was completely devoured, Wang Xian’s other Hades Ghost Avatar finally reached its peak!

Even so, the speed of the improvement was extremely terrifying!

It was no wonder that the Hades Ghost clan was the only race that was not harmonious among the peak races. They devoured, fought, and fought! Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Everything was for the sake of becoming stronger. The speed at which they became stronger was too fast!

“Hehe, with the addition of the Netherspirit clone, I have become stronger again!”

Wang Xian smiled. He was very satisfied with his gains this time!

The current him was simply too strong!

He was invincible below the level of a universe master!

How lonely would it be to be invincible?

He smiled. With a wave of his arm, the surroundings of the Dragon Palace were displayed!

Taking this opportunity, he could get to know the experts from the other peak races and the Invincible Zone!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

While Wang Xian was inspecting the invincible zone experts around the Dragon Palace, more than 70 figures were leaving at a terrifying speed in a city!

In fact, some of the experts’disciples couldn’t even see their figures clearly!

“In five hours, we’ll be able to reach the Heavenly River, the Dragon Palace’s Nest!”

The Sacred Dragon King and the others looked at the black tower wizards, the Supreme Water Demon King, and the old scholar in the center and said!

“Hahaha, it’s been a long time since I’ve fought with powerful people. I hope that Dragon King won’t disappoint me!”

The supreme water demon king was still laughing arrogantly!

“The three of you, the Dragon Palace can not be underestimated. The Dragon Palace has a woman in red who can withstand the combined attacks of me and my eight subordinates, and she has the upper hand. In addition, the Dragon Palace has powerful spell formation magi, and that is their nest. Spell Formation magi are extremely terrifying in terms of defense!”

The leader of the giant of light spoke to them.

His gaze could not help but sweep across the Black Tower Magi!

Because from his aura, the leader of the giant of light could sense that he was also a Magus!

“A formation? With the Black Tower Magi here, as long as it isn’t a formation at the universe ruler realm, it can be easily broken!”

The old scholar heard this, smiled, and spoke indifferently!

“I can also break an ordinary ruler Realm Formation!”

Just as he finished speaking, the Black Tower Magus spoke indifferently!

His expression was calm, as if he was describing a normal matter!

“That’s good, that’s good.”

When the Sacred Dragon King and the clan leader of the shepherds heard this, their eyes were filled with excitement!

“Haha, that Dragon King, I’ll kill him within a minute!”

The water demon king beside him laughed maniacally once again!

“It’s good that the three lords are so confident.”

The current clan leader of the Guang Ming Bug Clan said with a smile!

“Don’t worry, with our strength, we’ll be able to fight against 70 of you without any problems!”

The old scholar waved the fan made of angel wings in his hand and said casually!

His words caused the pupils of Sacred Dragon Emperor and the others to constrict slightly.

They looked at each other, some in disbelief, some in disbelief!

Three against 70 of them?

Wasn’t that too crazy?

Only a true three universe ruler level 1 warriors could do it right?

“Yes Yes!”

However the more confident they were, the more excited Holy Dragon Emperor and the rest were!
