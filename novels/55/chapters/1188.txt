Chapter 1189: Prince 1190, he had to hug his thigh tightly

Translator: 5496903

The Black Shadow Forest could be considered to be the outer part of the bloody forest in the Ladyboy graveyard. The area of this forest was about 500 kilometers in radius.

It was not very big, but because there were often demonic beasts from the LADYBOY graveyard coming here, it made the entire forest extremely dangerous.

Even those mercenary groups with extraordinary Type 8 powerhouses did not dare to stay here at night.

The word ‘shadow’perfectly illustrated the dangers of this forest.

Bai Qingshan scanned his surroundings with a cold expression.

The few people beside him looked around and frowned slightly.

Wang Xian turned his head around as well. He looked around with his bewitching eyes and raised his eyebrows slightly.

“There are quite a number of people here, and they are not weak either!”

There was a hint of surprise in his eyes as he looked around.

“What?”

Long Luo looked around. She was only at transcendent level five and did not see anything.

Ling Zilin, who was lying on the ground, looked around in surprise. He then looked at Wang Xian and continued to lie on the ground, ignoring him.

“There’s a black shadow leopard. Everyone, be careful!”

Bai Qingshan stood up slowly and reminded everyone.

“What? A Black Shadow Leopard?”

“Black Shadow Leopard. We didn’t realize that the black shadow leopard is the king of the Black Shadow Forest. It has the strength of an ordinary level eight or nine!”

The subordinates of Long Xiaotian quickly picked up their weapons and stood up. They scanned their surroundings vigilantly.

They did not sense the arrival of any fierce beasts around them, and their faces revealed a vigilant expression.

“Roar!”

At this moment, a muffled low roar sounded, and numerous blood-red eyes densely appeared around them in the middle of the night.

“Hiss, so many!”

Long Xiaotian’s subordinates sucked in a breath of cold air, and a shocked expression appeared on their faces.

There were at least fifty to sixty of them in the surroundings, completely surrounding them. Even on the trees above, there were black shadow leopards staring at them coldly, preventing them from escaping. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“You’re courting death!”

Long Xiaotian stood up, his eyes flickering with a cold light.

The group of Black Shadow Leopards in the surroundings might not have realized what kind of opponents they were surrounding. Their gazes were ice-cold as they opened their mouths and slowly surrounded them.

“Roar!”

At this moment, a three-meter-long black shadow leopard with Bright Eyes opened its mouth and revealed its teeth. It jumped to the front.

It had a strong body and a strong figure. It looked extremely ferocious.

It stared at Wang Xian and the rest and roared in a low voice. It was ready to launch a fatal attack at any time.

“Wow, this big cat is so cool!”

Long Luo looked at the black shadow leopard with a look of surprise on her face. She sized it up from top to bottom.

Long Xiaotian shook his head speechlessly. “This is a black shadow leopard. The one in front of us is only at the half-step void interpretation level. It’s very ferocious!”

“Of course I know it’s a black shadow leopard!”

Long Luo said without turning her head.

“Then why did you say it’s a big cat!”

Long Xiaotian was speechless.

“I was just saying that!”

Long Luo said without changing her expression, causing long Xiaotian to shut his mouth obediently. He knew that he was just looking for trouble.

“Roar!”

A cold howl came from the leader of the Black Shadow Leopards.

The sound echoed throughout the night sky.

“Hualala!”

One by one, the Black Shadow Leopards appeared in the surroundings and surrounded them.

There were fifty to sixty Black Shadow Leopards. The weakest among them was at the seventh level of the transcendence realm. Most of them were at the eighth level of the transcendence realm, and there were quite a few at the ninth level of the transcendence realm.

“Bastards looking for Death!”

The two middle-aged men swept their gaze across the group of Black Shadow Leopards. With a move of their arms, they drew out their long swords and sabers.

The surrounding people also took out their weapons.

Bai Qingshan did not make a move. As an expert at the profound void realm, it was impossible for him to make a move just because he encountered a ferocious beast. If that was the case, it would be useless for the others.

He would only make a move when he encountered a problem that could not be solved.

“If we kill them, we will be able to obtain quite a good harvest. The Black Shadow Panther’s skin is quite valuable!”

A middle-aged man at the half-step insightful emptiness realm glanced at the surrounding Black Shadow Panthers and said with a cold smile.

“Yes!”

Everyone immediately clenched the weapons in their hands.

“Kill!”

A middle-aged man at the half-step insightful emptiness realm moved and directly swept toward the fierce beasts in front of him.

Another half-step void interpretation realm expert directly attacked the black shadow leopard leader.

In an instant, long Xiaotian and his subordinates erupted with terrifying strength.

This caused the black shadow leopard leader to be slightly stunned.

“Roar!”

It roared loudly, and all the Black Shadow Leopards turned into black shadows and directly charged over.

“Roar Roar!”

In a breath’s time, the half-step void interpretation realm expert who attacked first easily pierced the head of a black shadow leopard with the long sword in his hand and easily killed it.

The Black Shadow Panther let out a miserable cry and fell to the ground.

“Such a handsome black shadow Panther was killed directly. What a pity!”

In the center, Long Luo looked at the Black Shadow Panther who was killed and said regretfully.

“Roar Roar!”

Seeing their companions killed, the group of Black Shadow Panthers took advantage of the situation and became bloodthirsty. Each of them threw their heads back and let out a long roar. They roared angrily and charged toward the group of people.

“AH, another one died!”

In the middle, Long Luo looked at another black shadow leopard being killed. Her face revealed a look of heartache.

“Oh Right!”

Suddenly, she raised her head and stared at Wang Xian. Her eyes flickered as she asked, “Brother Wang, aren’t You a Beast Tamer? Can you tame that Big Black Cat for me?”

“If it’s really not possible, I can buy it with money. I have a lot of spiritual liquid. Can you tame it and use it as my Mount?”

As she spoke, she pulled Wang Xian’s arm and looked at him expectantly.

“Long Luo, stop fooling around. It’s not that easy for a Beast Tamer to tame a ferocious beast. It requires a long period of training. Even if you tame it, you won’t be able to control it!”

Long Xiaotian saw her pestering Wang Xian. He patted her head and glared at her.

“Oh!”

Long Luo pouted.

“You want this mount?”

When Wang Xian heard her words, his heart skipped a beat as he looked at her.

“Brother Wang, can you subdue it?”

Long Luo’s eyes lit up as she asked hurriedly.

“There shouldn’t be a problem!”

Wang Xian looked at the black shadow leopards around him. His heart skipped a beat as he looked at Ling Zilin.

“Injure all the Black Shadow Leopards. Don’t let them escape!”

Wang Xian ordered Ling Zilin.

“Roar!”

Ling Zilin, who was lying on the ground, let out a muffled sound as he stood up.

“Roar!”

Following that, a roar filled with a powerful pressure was heard. The voice was filled with the aura of a king of the Seethrough realm.

All the Black Shadow Leopards paused for a moment at this moment. A hint of fear could be seen in their eyes.

“Eh? Brother Wang Xian, what are you trying to do?”

At the side, Long Xiaotian stared at Wang Xian in astonishment when he saw Wang Xian ordering his mount to take action.

What was he trying to do?

Was he really going to tame that half-step void interpretation level ferocious beast?

Was he joking? It would take at least one to two months or even longer after he had tamed it!

Furthermore, he could only command it himself after he had tamed it. Why would he listen to the orders of others.

With a cave-level mount, also need this Black Shadow Panther?
