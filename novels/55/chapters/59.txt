Chapter 60: A Storm In The Banquet (5)

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“You, you... What an arrogant brat!” Second Master Qin pointed at Wang Xian and was shivering in anger.

At this very moment, Old Qin and his family, together with the three generations of Xue Family, were walking towards the entrance of the banquet hall.

“You won’t let me off? You might want to ask if Qin Guohui dares to say this to me!”

However, just as they arrived at the entrance, all of them heard this angry roar.

Old Qin was completely stunned and Old Xue immediately frowned.

“Grandfather, that’s Brother Wang Xian’s voice,” Xue Jing commented quickly upon hearing as his expression turned solemn.

Old Qin clearly heard Wang Xian’s voice too. His expression changed quickly and a worried look hung on his face. “Let’s quickly get there and take a look!”

He couldn’t understand why Wang Xian would let out such an angry roar.

He couldn’t understand why the seemingly amiable Wang Xian, who he had an enjoyable lunch with in the afternoon, would be so angry.

Disregarding the fact that Old Xue believed that he had unparalleled horrifying strength, Wang Xian had just cured his beloved grandson. Their Qin Family couldn’t make him an enemy.

Moreover, even the Qin Family wouldn’t go offend such a strong expert for no reason.

In the modern era, other than the society, there was also an underworld. Although the Qin Family was very strong in society, they still wouldn’t dare to offend strong experts of the underworld.

Old Xue frowned and quickly hurried in.

At this moment, the crowd was completely astounded by Wang Xian’s words.

Everyone was shocked as no one expected him to shout that Qin Guohui wouldn’t dare to say this to him in the Qin Family’s banquet.

“Step aside. All of you, step aside!” At this moment, Xue Jing’s growl sounded from behind the crowd.

Everyone who was gathered here was shaken as they quickly looked back.

“Old Qin is here and Old Xue is here too!”

A middle-aged man couldn’t contain his shock and exclaimed.

The crowd opened up a path of them automatically.

“This lad is finished.”

“His death is certain!”

A weak voice sounded from the side. When Lan Qingyue saw Old Qin and Old Xue, she couldn’t help but feel deeply worried.

As for Guan Shuqing, she was dumbfounded when she looked over. Following which, joy and relief replaced her initial emotions and were shown on her face.

They really are! They really are...!

She was shaken up. The two people who were walking at the front of the group were the two old men she’d had lunch with in the afternoon.

When she arrived, she was still a little suspicious. However, she didn’t dare to think so and assumed that they were these two old men. At this moment, all her worries had dissipated entirely.

She recalled the attitude of the two old men when speaking with Wang Xian in the afternoon. She was more confident that Wang Xian truly had the qualification to say what he had just said previously.

“You’re finished! How dare you start a fight and injure others in a banquet hosted by the Qin Family. You’re finished! My dad is here.” Second Master Qin was exhilarated upon seeing Old Qin walking over.

Wang Xian’s expression didn’t change a bit and was still emitting the aura of the divine dragon. He turned his head around and looked towards Old Qin’s Family and the three people from Xue Family.

What a strong disposition!

Old Xue could sense the faint aura around Wang Xian and was shocked. He thought that his strength was probably similar to Wang Xian after making the breakthrough. However, he felt that he still wasn’t a match for Wang Xian after feeling this disposition.

The Qin Family and Xue Family walked over in a straight line.

The surrounding atmosphere had frozen up and no one even dared to take a deep breath.

When Old Qin heard what his adopted son said, his hand, which was holding onto the walking stick, started trembling. He walked directly towards Second Master Qin without any expressions.

“Father, he actually dares to ... in the banquet organized by us... Argh!” When Second Master Qin saw his father walking over, he reported happily.

However, before he could even complete his sentence, the walking stick in Old Qin’s hand had landed ruthlessly on his leg.

Crack crack!

The walking stick made of solid wood broke directly! One could easily imagine how furious Old Qin was.

“Father, you... Why did you beat me...” Second Master Qin’s face turned pale as he grabbed onto his leg and spoke in horror.

Haiz! Old Qin suddenly heaved a sigh. “When your father passed away and handed you over for me to take care of, I saw you as my biological son. However, you have repeatedly...I have always turned a blind eye to your actions but you didn’t learn your lessons and committed so many heinous acts under the name of our family. There will be a day when our family might get into serious trouble because of you!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Old Qin threw his walking stick onto the floor. “Lianhui, transfer Rivertown Mining Grounds to his name. From this day onwards, he would have nothing to do with our Qin Family. No matter if he is dead or alive, it has nothing to do with the Qin Family. Our Qin Family isn’t blessed enough to have him!”

Old Qin’s strong words propagated throughout the banquet hall. No one could have expected this development.

“Second Master Qin was directly expelled out of Qin Family! This... This...”

However, what shocked the crowd the most was Old Qin’s bowing down slightly as he spoke to the young man. “I’m sorry Brother Wang Xian. I’m sorry. It’s because of my loose teachings that you had to suffer!”

“Brother, don’t be angry. Hug, hug!” Little Kite looked at the solemn-faced Wang Xian and said as he walked in front of him and raised his arms.

After witnessing the attitude of Old Qin and the cute Little Kite, a smile appeared on Wang Xian’ss face. He reached out his arm and carried Little Kite. “Old Qin, it was I who was impulsive. Sorry for causing you troubles.”

Old Qin heaved a huge sigh of relief upon seeing Wang Xian’s expression. He smiled, “That’s great, that’s great... As long as Brother Wang Xian doesn’t blame it on this old man.”

Wang Xian smiled and replied, “I was impulsive. I hope you wouldn’t blame me.”

“Haha!” Old Qin laughed out. “Old Xue and I were a little late. Sorry about it. Brother Wang Xian, come! Let us take a seat now. I’ll definitely give you a good explanation for what happened today.”

Wang Xian smiled.

“Grandfather, I have found out about the incident.” Xue Jing returned immediately after going over to a service attendant to find out more. Subsequently, he repeated the whole event softly.

“Hmm? It seems like it’s still about the incident in the afternoon. Bi Famly?” A murderous intent flashed passed Old Xue’s face. “In that case, I shall use Bi Family to establish our dominance. As for the rest, I’ll leave them to Qin Family to settle.”

“Yes, father!” Xue Jiahua nodded his head and looked to Qin Lianhui.

Qin Lianhui nodded his head and headed directly to Director Wu, Director Gong and Director Song.

As for Xue Jiahua, he walked over to Master Bi San who had crawled up.

“Father, no. This can’t be...”

At this moment, Second Master Qin was mumbling to himself in a daze. He couldn’t believe that what had happened was the reality. If he left Qin Family, who would he be in Rivertown in the future?

And at this moment, the crowd in the banquet hall had their attention focused on the young man who was carrying Old Qin’s beloved grandson. They were completely lost.

They would have never expected things to end up this way.

Second Master Qin was expelled from Qin Family and that young man could make Old Qin bow down to apologize?

They quickly looked towards the future successor of Qin Family who was heading towards Director Wu, Director Song and Director Gong.

They then looked at Xue Jiahua, the future pillar of Xue Family.

Eventually, they turned and saw Director Wu, Director Song, Director Gong and Master Bi San. Their faces had turned pale and they seemed to be scared out of their wits.
