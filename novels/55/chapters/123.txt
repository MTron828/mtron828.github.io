Chapter 124: Princess Xiao Yu

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

In a large private lounge in First-grade Restaurant. There were two tables in the private lounge.

Xiao Yu and her classmates were sitting around a table.

Wang Xian, Wang Dahai, Zhang Wen and Zhang Feng sat around the other table.

“Come tycoon! Let’s have a toast!”

Wang Dahai, Zhang Wen and Zhang Feng raised their cups and signalled to Wang Xian.

“I had really not expected you to become so rich. If I hadn’t heard it from Dahai, I wouldn’t have believed it. Incredible!”

“A million thanks to the tycoon, Wang Xian, who is treating us today! I have to eat till I can’t even walk today!”

Zhang Wen and Zhang Feng looked at the dishes on the table and remarked emotionally.

Wang Xian smiled and said, “Come, let’s have a toast! It’s fate that brought us together as roommates!”

“Cheers!”

Wang Xian’s table had started eating without holding back. As for the table beside them, Xiao Yu and her classmates had not started at all.

Nowadays, girls like to take pictures of their food before they start eating. It was the same for some of the guys.

There were also guys who weren’t into this.

However, everyone resisted the temptation of the food this time. They wanted to take photos before they start eating.

Nope! Rather, they wanted to show off to others before they started eating.

“After we upload these pictures to our circle of friends, they will definitely be impressed. Two-headed abalone and Atlantic Bluefin Marlin for this meal? Hehe... Hehe!”

“Xiao Yu, this is too extravagant!”

“Thank you, Xiao Yu, for your warm welcome!”

The group commented as they took pictures and uploaded them to their circle of friends.

Even Liu Ranran and Liu Hui, who came from well-to-do families, couldn’t contain themselves and took a few pictures to show off.

“Come, let’s take a group picture!” Liu Hui stood up and said to the group.

“Eh, take a look at our school forum. There are many people commenting on Xiao Yu’s pink Bentley!”

“Really? Let me see!”

“It’s true. There’re quite a number of replies too!”

“Don’t just look at the forum. Take a look at our class Weixin group! They were talking about this too!”

The few guys commented and soon everyone took out their phones to check.

In their class group chat, a student had uploaded a few pictures and added, [There’s a pink Bentley beside the female dormitory block. It’s so stunning!]

[Oh damn! Who’s that filthy rich girl who could actually afford to drive a pink Bentley!]

[Looking at the cup noodles beside me... Haiz. Forget it, I’ll add a strip of bacon!]

[Who’s that girl? Is she single? I’ll pursue her!]

[Comparing with others would only deflate myself. I was still considering the brand of bicycle I should get. Now...]

In the class group, the group of students were chatting raucously and sighing.

The group around the table found this to be hilarious. Su Qian laughed and uploaded the pictures she took today onto the group.

“Take a look! Who do you think this is?”

She smiled and clicked the “send” button.

The group got silent for a few seconds. However, it exploded shortly after.

[Damn!]

[What the!]

[What the hell!]

[Why does she look a little like Wang Yu?]

[She doesn’t just look like Wang Yu. It’s her!]

[The owner of the pink Bentley is our class goddess, Wang Yu?]

[She has hidden it too well! Wang Yu looks so approachable like the girl next door. Who would have expected her to drive a Bentley?]

[Worship, worship! I never expected our class to have a hidden Princess-level existence!]

The group exploded immediately as the students couldn’t help but sigh.

Towards the end, even the school counsellor commented.

No one had expected that demure, cute and beautiful girl would be so incredible!

“Let’s give them another piece of shocking news!”

One of the male students revealed a smile and uploaded a picture of their meal.

[Xiao Yu’s brother is giving us a treat. First-grade Restaurant is her brother’s restaurant. This meal alone costs over $100,000!]

That male student added the comment.

Replies flooded in quickly for that comment.

Perhaps they couldn’t imagine the life of the filthy rich.

$100,000 for a meal? They wouldn’t even dare to dream about it.

[This is equivalent to a Princess-level existence!]

The students sighed emotionally.

After this incident, Xiao Yu had become famous in the class. In fact, the entire school might get to know about her in the near future.

Wang Dahai and Wang Xian were chatting joyously while eating. Soon, Xiao Yu and her classmates also started.

Towards the end of the day, Xiao Yu’s classmates went over to Wang Xian one after another to give a toast to him.

No matter what, they had to thank Wang Xian and Wang Yu for treating them to such a luxurious dinner.

The dinner ended at around 10 pm. Wang Xian stood up and walked over to Xiao Yu.

“You will be having your off-day tomorrow. If you’d like to tour around, take this card along. You could stay and play for free in the Summer Sun Resort with it!”

Wang Xian passed the Family membership card of the Summer Sun Resort to Xiao Yu, as he wouldn’t be using it himself.

“Alright, brother. Aren’t you coming with us to play tomorrow?” Xiao Yu asked while taking the card from Wang Xian.

“I’ll give it a pass. I’ll be a little busy for the next two days and have things to attend to. You guys could go and have fun!”

Wang Xian smiled as he replied.

“Mm. Alright then!” Xiao Yu nodded her head and didn’t question further.

The group headed back towards the school with satisfied smiles on their faces.

This time, when Xiao Yu drove her car to the carpark behind the girls’ dormitory block, Liu Ranran went over enthusiastically and even helped her put up the car hood.

In fact, if it wasn’t for the fact that she knew that Wang Xian had rumors with Lan Qingyue and Guan Shuqing, she might have asked for Wang Xian’s contacts from Xiao Yu!

However, after giving it some thought, she gave up on the idea.

Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue were famous goddesses of the school. They weren’t something she could match up to.

When Wang Xian got back to his dormitory, he had a good night sleep. He had not slept for the last three to four days.

The next morning, Wang Dahai went over to look for Su Qian at the break of dawn.

When Wang Xian woke up, it was already 10 am.

After washing up, he went over to his Medical Hall.

He would still prefer to take a look at the renovations of the Medical Hall. Moreover, there were still some things that he had to give instructions about before buying.

Currently, Wang Xian liked to wear a pair of sunglasses while in school. It wasn’t that he wanted to look cool to others, but rather that he wanted to prevent others from recognizing him!

However, when he reached the entrance of the school, he still sensed a sharp gaze looking at him.

Wang Xian looked over in the direction and was slightly surprised.

It was a juvenile that was looking at him. That juvenile from the Sacred Followers Guild.

There was also a middle-aged man beside the juvenile.

That middle-aged man was skinny and wore a white shirt and a pair of grey pants.

The middle-aged man was also staring at Wang Xian. His gaze was sharp and felt chilly.

Wang Xian didn’t pay attention to it as he continued walking forward.

However, even if Wang Xian didn’t want to be bothered by them, it didn’t mean that they wouldn’t bother him.

The two of them headed straight to him.

Wang Xian lifted his eyebrows and stopped. He looked at the middle-aged man and that juvenile.

“Hey son, how are you?” the middle-aged man walked over and said to Wang Xian.

“Do you have something for me?” Wang Xian looked at them and asked.

“Nothing.” The middle-aged man looked at Wang Xian from head to toe. He shook his head and commented, “It’s just...”

“If you have nothing, I have something going on. I’m not too close to you guys so don’t come and disturb me!”

Seeing their attitude, Wang Xian interrupted his words directly in a sharp and cold manner.

After finishing his sentence, he turned around and left.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com
