Chapter 1421: 1421. Whoever I say is a chosen one will go up

“Haha, a Chosen One? What is a chosen one? If I say you are a chosen one, you are a chosen one!”

The arrogant voice was filled with confidence and arrogance.

These words that everyone heard were extremely arrogant and entered everyone’s ears.

The voice caused everyone to be stunned.

So arrogant!

I said you are a heaven’s favorite, and you are a heaven’s favorite?

What arrogance!

Everyone looked towards the source of the sound. They wanted to know who it was that had such a tone.

“Hehe!”

When Wang Xian saw everyone looking over, he flew towards the arena with a smile on his face.

Feng Luan and a group of girls followed behind and flew towards the arena.

“Eh? That is?”

The city lord of Flaming Sun City, who was standing on the main stage, saw the figures of Wang Xian and the rest. He stared at Feng Luan and his expression changed slightly.

The Dean of Flaming Sun Academy, who was standing at the side, also widened his eyes.

The two of them did not hesitate at all and flew towards the arena.

“Your Majesty!”

The two of them landed in front of Feng Luan in the air. They bowed and greeted her respectfully.

“What?”

“Her Majesty the Queen? The Queen of our dragon-phoenix Dynasty?”

The words of the Flaming Sun City Lord and the Flaming Sun Academy’s dean caused everyone’s faces to reveal shock.

“Greetings, your Majesty the Queen!”

Some experts from the flaming sun city’s families immediately stood up from the viewing platform and bowed as they called out.

“Greetings, your Majesty the Queen!”

When all the citizens saw their queen, they also hurriedly stood up and bowed as they called out.

“I’ve always heard that Her Majesty visited US incognito. I didn’t expect that she would actually come to Our Flaming Sun City!”

Everyone knew about this legendary queen, especially in the past few months.

The story of the Queen visiting the city incognito, destroying the city lord, beheading the unscrupulous family, and serving the country and the people spread to every city.

What they didn’t expect was that Her Majesty had actually come to Flaming Sun City!

“Greetings, your Majesty the Queen!”

The ten youths on the arena immediately half-knelt on the ground.

The people of Feng Luan and the others, who had faces full of shock, as well as the owner of the arrogant words.

This...

Wasn’t this the group of people on the shore of Flaming Sun Lake that day?

“All subjects, Rise!”

Feng Luan stood in the air, her hands slightly floating, and her voice entered everyone’s ears. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“It’s the Queen!”

The city lord of Flaming Sun City took the lead and said.

“The Dragon and Phoenix Queen?”

The elder from the blood stream sect slightly raised his brows when he saw the sudden appearance of Queen Feng Luan.

“Everyone from the blood stream sect, this is our dragon and Phoenix dynasty. You have crossed the line by coming here to recruit disciples!”

Feng Luan looked at the Elder in the center and said coldly.

At first, they were a little surprised when they saw a young man suddenly come out to cause trouble.

When they saw that the blood stream sect was actually here to steal their genius young man, they naturally couldn’t sit idly by!

“Haha, Dragon-phoenix Queen, Our Blood Stream sect is a sect, not a dynasty. There are no restrictions on the recruitment of disciples by the sect!”

The white-haired old man in the middle laughed loudly.

“I don’t care what sect you are from. This is the place for our dragon and Phoenix Dynasty’s prodigy competition. You are here to seduce our competition disciples. You are courting death!”

Mang Hong’s body instantly erupted with a fierce aura as he directly charged toward the three people from the blood stream sect.

“Hehe, don’t be so violent!”

The white-haired elder in the center felt the aura from Mang Hong’s body. He waved his arm, and an imposing aura directly struck back.

“Eh?”

“Fifth level of the profound void tier!”

Mang Hong’s expression changed greatly, and so did the expressions of the surrounding spectators.

“What? Fifth level of the profound void tier!”

“Any old man from the Blood Stream sect is already a fifth level of the profound void tier. Heavens, how can he be so strong!”

“What a terrifying old man!”

Everyone around exclaimed.

Even the Flaming Sun City Lord’s and the others’expressions changed greatly.

On the arena, the ten people of Daybreak looked at the white-haired old man in shock, their eyes flickering.

“Hehe, The Prodigy competition? The prodigies that you have conferred can not be called prodigies. Prodigies are honed and can not be selected from the competition!”

The white-haired old man said indifferently, his gaze fixed on the ten people of Daybreak and the others on the arena. “Only by joining my blood stream sect will you have a chance to become true prodigies!”

This caused the expressions of the ten people from Daybreak Moon sect to change continuously!

They were slightly moved!

“Haha, Heaven’s favorites, whoever I say is!”

When Wang Xian heard the old man say the word “Heaven’s favorites”again, he laughed out loud and said it again.

“HMM? If you say so, then so be it. You sure have a big mouth!”

When Helian Hu heard Wang Xian’s arrogant words, he glared at him and said with a cold smile.

“You think too highly of yourself!”

The middle-aged man behind the white-haired old man stared at Wang Xian coldly and spat out four words.

“The 17th on the Heaven’s Pride Roll?”

When Wang Xian heard Helian Hu’s words, a faint smile appeared on his face. With a flick of his finger, a gray dot of light shot towards him.

“How dare you attack me? You are courting death!”

When Helian Hu saw a young man who was about the same age as him attacking him, a hint of killing intent flashed across his eyes.

He waved the bone fan in his hand, and the dark energy instantly condensed into a fierce beast, directly attacking the gray light spot.

“Not good!”

“Be careful!”

Meng Wenbing, who had been expressionless the whole time, saw the gray light spot, and his face changed greatly as he warned.

Helian Hu’s pupils also slightly shrank.

“Peng Peng Peng!”

When the gray light spot landed on the fierce beast condensed by the dark energy, the dark energy instantly dissipated.

When the gray light landed on the bone fan in his hand, the fan collapsed instantly.

Finally, the light landed on his body, causing him to fly backward. He spat out a mouthful of blood and his face was extremely pale.

“Seventh on the prodigy roll?”

Wang Xian looked at him expressionlessly. With a flick of his finger, he launched another attack at Meng Wenbing.

Meng Wenbing had a serious expression on his face. With a move of his hands, a dark disc appeared in his hands.

“Bang!”

When the gray light spot landed on the dark disc, Meng Wenbing was horrified.

The dark disc collapsed instantly. When the gray light spot landed on his body, he was sent flying and spat out blood!

“You are courting death. How dare you attack the elite disciples of our blood stream sect!”

The expression of a middle-aged man behind the white-haired old man changed drastically. His eyes were filled with murderous intent. An aura of the third level of the Seethrough realm burst out instantly.

A golden longsword appeared in his hand.

“Third level of the Seethrough Realm?”

Wang Xian remained expressionless as he flicked his finger!

The gray specks of light attacked the middle-aged man again.

“You are courting death!”

When the middle-aged man saw Wang Xian’s contemptuous expression, he roared furiously. The longsword in his hand slashed directly at the specks of light.

“Bang!”

However, just like Helian Hu and Meng Wenbing, the Longsword collapsed and the gray light spots landed on his body.

His eyes were wide open and filled with disbelief. The powerful attack made him spit out blood!

“You... you are the nameless sword demon!”

The other middle-aged man behind the white-haired elder suddenly widened his eyes and exclaimed.
