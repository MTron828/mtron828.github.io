Chapter 452: Dragon Sect’s Killing Order (3)

Argh!

When the last person from the eight forces had finally died, the entire competition field for the Outstanding Young Heroes Competition went silent.

As a cold breeze blew over, everyone could feel the chill down their bones. This type of chill was more penetrative than what they felt from the young lord of Sea Serpent Island.

Looking at the corpses around them, they couldn’t help but shiver.

Among the eight forces, there were subordinates of the second strongest man in the Underworld, people from the Sacred Clan, Qiao Clan, the Wu Family and many other first-class forces.

Only the young lord of Sea Serpent Island among the thirty Inborn experts had made it out alive after two Half-Step to Dan Realm experts sacrificed themselves to help him escape with the treasure he had.

All the rest were killed on the spot.

Looking at the fifty dragonians appearing behind the young man, everyone was truly shocked.

Any force that could establish itself as a Sacred Sect would undoubtedly be a force to be reckoned with over a certain region. From today onwards, that young man would be the same.

His name is the Dragon King!

The Sect Leader of the Sacred Sect, Dragon Sect.

No one had any doubts about Dragon Sect becoming a Sacred Sect and no one would doubt its strength.

Just the fifty Inborn experts before them would be more than the Inborn experts many other Sacred Sects had.

“When he said he wasn’t participating in the Outstanding Young Heroes Competition, there were still lots of people mocking him. They accused him of being afraid after seeing the experts and thought he didn’t dare to take on the challenge. It would seem now that... Hehe! He definitely has the strength. It is just that he had no regard for those participating at all!”

“Considering he could make so many experts address him as the Dragon King, how strong is he? I believe he is definitely above the Inborn Realm!”

“That’s a hundred percent certain. His sister alone is able to defeat the young lord of Sea Serpent Island. He wouldn’t be any worse!”

Another unparalleled expert has appeared in the Underworld once again. The Dragon King from the Dragon Sect! the crowd thought to themselves.

Wang Xian looked across and noticed there were still a lot of camera equipment over the entire competition ground for the Outstanding Young Heroes Competition.

All these cameras were broadcasting live for the entire Underworld over the Internet.

At this point, he knew that whatever happened here was known by the entire Underworld.

“Medical Saint Sect’s killing order? Hehe! Today, my Dragon Sect shall also issue a killing order to all those forces that fought against us as well as the Medical Saint Sect. We will definitely annihilate all of you in the future!” Wang Xian looked towards a camera and said coldly.

“In three days, our Dragon Sect will be hosting a pilgrimage for two consecutive days. On the first day, I hope you guys will come and our Dragon Sect will definitely be a good host!” Wang Xian’s voice resounded and the crowd could hear him clearly.

Those who relied on the cameras for the live stream over the Underworld website had also seen it clearly with their eyes.

Despite being separated by the screen, they could still see and sense the boundless dominance and killing intent in Wang Xian words. All of them were greatly shocked.

[This... This... Is Dragon King from the Dragon Sect declaring war against Medical Saint Sect and the Qiao Clan? We are talking about two Saint-class forces here!]

[He’s too domineering and arrogant. After slaughtering everyone from the eight forces, he announced he would be annihilating all of them! That’s too insane!]

[Establishing a Sacred Sect at the age of twenty and having fifty Inborn experts as subordinates! This is too shocking! Every action of Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown has been shocking the entire Underworld. And now he’s issuing a challenge to the Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan!]

[Is he a little too brazen to announce he will annihilate all the forces who accepted the killing order from the Medical Saint Sect? Those are eight forces. Among which, one is even a Saint-class force. If we put the other seven forces together, they could also be equivalent to a Sacred Sect. Together with the Medical Saint Sect, that would be the strength of three Saint-class forces!]

Wang Xian’s announcement shocked everyone to the core. He made it clear that he wouldn’t rest until either his side perished or Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan perished. That was too terrifying.

Nonetheless, everyone was filled with respect and fear towards him.

No one dared to make it clear publicly to go against the Medical Saint Sect, the Qiao Clan and the other seven forces.

Even other Sacred Sects wouldn’t dare to make two other Sacred Sects their enemies at the same time.

“Arrogance! He’s too arrogant. He is saying he’s going to annihilate our Medical Saint Sect!”

Boom!

At this very moment, within the mountain valley of Medical Saint Sect.

When the two Sect Leaders of Medical Saint Sect saw Wang Xian’s declaration over the video, they were infuriated.

While their eyes were glowing with anger, they were also a little shocked.

“He should be counting himself lucky if we don’t pursue him. Yet, he’s saying he’s going to annihilate us. Haha! Great. Dragon King of the Dragon Sect... Great, great!”

The two of them stared furiously at the video. Dense killing intent was leaking out of their bodies. “In three days, it will be the death anniversary of your Dragon Sect.”

“Inform the Supreme Elders of the Medical Saint Sect. We have reached the point that this incident won’t end without a side perishing. We will be mobilizing all our forces!”

“Although that brat possesses unexpected influence, just the Dragon Sect alone isn’t enough to shake the foundation of our Medical Saint Sect. Wishful thinking!” the two Sect Leaders shouted and looked hideous.

The surrounding Elders of the Medical Saint Sect were also brimming with killing intent. The words of that young man in the video didn’t just constitute provocations. He was declaring that he wouldn’t rest until one side perished.

And he was making the same statement to two Sacred Sects!

A wise Elder pondered for a moment before remarking solemnly, “Sect Leaders, I believe our best option is to ally with the Qiao Clan. The Dragon Sect isn’t weak. Moreover, that Dragon King will most likely be above the Inborn Realm!”

“Inform our Supreme Elders too. There’s nothing to fear about just a Dragon Sect,” the other Sect Leader pulled a long face and shouted.

“I’m just thinking of playing it safe. Since he dares to challenge us and the Qiao Clan, he should be aware of the strength of the two Sacred Sects. I’m only afraid that he’s still hiding his true strength,” that Elder reminded.

The two Sect Leader of the Medical Saint Sect calmed down and replied, “We will get in contact with the Qiao Clan!”

If Dragon Sect was still hiding their strength, they would indeed be horrifying!

...

“Damn it! Damn it! The Dragon Sect is too arrogant and brazen. It’s just a newly established Sacred Sect and yet he dares to be so arrogant!”

Nanjing. Within a mountain peak, a group had gathered at the Grand Hall and was watching the video on the screen solemnly.

The Qiao Clan would never have expected the other party to go to this extent after killing four of their disciples for simply accepting the killing order of the Medical Saint Sect.

It was especially so after learning that the other party possessed such terrifying strength.

If the Qiao Clan had known that the other party was a Sacred Clan, they would have never gotten themselves involved in this.

Now that they had boarded the ship, they couldn’t alight. The other party issued a challenge to them directly and even declared that they would be annihilating them.

Domineering and arrogant!

In the Grand Hall of the Qiao Clan, everyone was extremely bitter. A Sacred Sect had declared that they would annihilate them. Moreover, it came from Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown who had been known to be domineering in his actions.

This wouldn’t be a joke. No matter how this incident turned out, their Qiao Clan would have suffered a huge blow.

Even if they achieved victory in the end.

Looking at the fifty powerful Inborn experts, the Qiao Clan was fearful despite being infuriated. The entire Qiao Clan didn’t even have that many experts.

“Inform Laozu about this and let him decide!” said the clan leader of the Qiao Clan helplessly. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

He was regretting his actions. Because of greed, he had accepted the killing order from the Medical Saint Sect. Now, he was forced to go against another Sacred Sect.
