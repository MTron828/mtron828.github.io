Chapter 898: 0899 was shrouded in the light of death

Translator: 549690339

Within a day, the entire Shenghai town was shaken by the Dragon Assassin organization.

When Wang Xian realized that everyone in Shenghai town was shaken, he was slightly taken aback. Soon after, he understood that it was very difficult to train assassins in this world.

“Dragon King!”

At this moment, Long Yi and the rest came into the room and shouted at Wang Xian.

“We have found the 20 spies. Should we proceed with the next operation?”

The group of DRAKONIDS said to him.

“Continue with the operation. If we only assassinate the members of the horned shark mercenary group, we might be exposed!”

Wang Xian said immediately. He waved his hand and said, “This is 20 drops of dragon blood. Let them swallow it. Then, give each of them a communication stone plate!”

“Tonight, I want all the upper-class people in Shenghai town to get the contact information of the dragon assassin mercenary group. After that, the light will envelop the entire Shenghai Town!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slowly and said with a solemn face.

“It’s the Dragon King. Let’s get ready immediately!”

The group of Drakonids left immediately.

Wang Xian had to control 100% of the spies of the dragon assassin organization. This way, even if the spies were caught, nothing would be leaked.

These spies were all people who were about to die. Now that they had gained another few hundred years of life, they wouldn’t refuse even if they knew that they could die at any time.

However, every day that they lived was another day!

Moreover, as long as they hid well, there wouldn’t be any danger.

“The light will envelop the holy sea town. However, this is the light of Death!”

Wang Xian mumbled.

A Day passed slowly. The leader of the squawk shark mercenary group gathered all the members who were carrying out their mission.

After bei Qianjun and Qing Guya learned that Ao Kuang had been assassinated, their faces were filled with fear. They were afraid that it would be their turn tonight.

When they thought of that young man, a hint of fear and embarrassment appeared on their faces.

In order to seek revenge for their children urgently, they went to look for an assassin organization. However, they did not expect that the other party would also look for an assassin organization!

Moreover, it was such a powerful assassin’s organization.

At night, the Bei and Qing families were brightly lit. Bei Qianjun and Qing Guya even gathered in a courtyard and sat there discussing countermeasures with embarrassed expressions on their faces.

“Huh? What should we do? What if this assassin’s organization comes to assassinate us?”

“It shouldn’t be. According to the information we’ve received, that Kid lives in a slum area. He probably doesn’t have that much money to hire an assassin!”

“Let’s Hope so. Where did this dragon assassin organization come from? How can it be so powerful? The undercurrent branch in our holy sea town only has a transcendent level 5 assassin at most!”

The two of them talked with an embarrassed expression.

“Whoosh!”

At this moment, a flying knife suddenly flew towards them.

“Watch Out!”

“Watch Out!”

The two’s expressions changed drastically as they hurriedly stood up, their bodies emitting a terrifying aura.

“Bang!”

A flying knife landed on the pillar of the house. The two’s expressions were filled with shock as they looked over.

“Hiss, this time? This is the piece of paper that congratulates Death!”

“Why did they send us a piece of paper?”

The two’s bodies trembled as fear appeared on their faces.

Bei Qianjun’s expression changed as he quickly walked over and pulled out the flying knife that was embedded in the pillar. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

His eyes flashed as he took the piece of paper.

“There are words on it?”

“What’s written on it?”

Qing Guya quickly asked.

“It’s the contact information of the Dragon Assassin Organization!”

Bei Qianjun’s expression changed drastically as he looked at the contact information and immediately took out his communication stone plate.

At the same time, all the powerful forces and families in the entire Shenghai town received a contact information from the dragon assassin organization.

This caused the expressions of everyone in the entire Shenghai town to change slightly.

Some of them frowned while some of them revealed a hint of viciousness on their faces.

The next morning, the sun was still rising high in the sky.

Wang Xian opened his eyes and revealed a smile on his face. He had a simple breakfast.

“Dragon King, there are already people looking for us!”

Wang Xian had just finished his breakfast when a group of drakonids walked over excitedly and said to him.

“Is that so? The business is here already?”

Wang Xian was full of smiles. “What Mission?”

“To assassinate the leader of an extraordinary level four mercenary group!”

The DRAKONIDS replied immediately.

“What is the character of the leader of the mercenary group?”

Wang Xian asked faintly.

Although the Dragon Assassin Group was established, Wang Xian did not make the group a zombie.

There were three types of missions that the dragon assassin group did not accept!

They did not accept missions to assassinate children!

They did not accept missions to assassinate good people!

They did not accept missions that exceeded the capabilities of the Dragon Assassin Group!

The three types of missions that the dragon assassin group did not accept could be considered as the bottom line of an assassin group.

“Dragon King, the leader of the mercenary group that the other party requested to assassinate is not a good person. I heard that he has killed quite a number of members of the mercenary group in the Wild!”

The group of Drakonids knew the rules set by Wang Xian and would definitely follow them. They immediately said.

“Alright, Ao Yao, do it!”

Wang Xian nodded and said directly to the side.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao’s voice rang out before it disappeared immediately.

“Dragon King, there’s another mission!”

Not long after, another drakonid walked over.

There was another mission.

The reward for the mission was extremely generous. If one were to assassinate a level 3 extraordinaire and obtain jade to buy elixirs, the reward would be increased by 20 dragon crystals.

If one were to assassinate a level 4 extraordinaire and exchange it for Dragon Crystals, the reward would be 100 dragon crystals.

Assassinating A Level 5 transcendent expert would be worth 700 dragon crystals.

Assassinations were far more profitable than mercenary missions.

In a short morning, the dragon Spike received five missions, one of which he rejected.

Four missions, assassinating one level 3 transcendent, two level 4 transcendents, and one level 5 transcendent.

None of them were innocent people who could not be killed.

“Carry out the mission immediately!”

Wang Xian gave the order on the spot.

Currently, the Dragon Assassin organization had a total of 21 strange demons who had evolved into light spikes.

Including Ao Yao, there were a total of eight level-three transcendents.

Light spikes with level-three transcendents had an 80% success rate in assassinating level-five transcendents.

Kill!

After dragon Spike received the mission and obtained the commission through the spy, the Dragon Assassin organization took action.

One was at rank 3 transcendent, two were at rank 4 transcendent, and one was at rank 5 transcendent.

These four people were very weak to dragon spike.

During the day, in a restaurant, a burly middle-aged man slammed the table and shouted, “Waiter, serve the wine!”

An old man was sitting in his shop with a smile on his face.

A young man was walking toward the forging workshop with a weapon in his hand.

A leader of a mercenary group led a group of members to the red chamber in an awe-inspiring manner.

The Sun was high up in the sky. The four of them were in the middle of a riot during the day, so they were not vigilant at all.

The light of death shrouded them!
