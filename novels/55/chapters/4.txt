Chapter 5: Upgrading with Dragon Energy

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“The most expensive Koi carp is worth 150,000 dollars while the most expensive arowana will cost about 100,000 dollars.”

Wang Xian was observing the ornamental fish in the aquarium store. The two most expensive fish cost only about a few hundred thousand in this shop.

He looked at the fish and realized that most of them were at Level 0. Only the arowanas and the Koi carps possessed slightly more Dragon Energy.

But those arowanas and the Koi carps in the fish tanks were indeed beautiful.

The scales on the arowanas were glittering, and they had prominent foreheads with long whiskers.

Bright and colorful patterns were all over the bodies of the Koi carps. As they swam in the tank, they looked as though they were living pieces of art.

“Hey, pretty, your arowanas and Koi carps are quite expensive.”

Wang Xian smiled to the salesgirl beside him as he struck up a conversation.

“Do you think this is expensive? You must have not seen those Koi carps and arowanas that cost millions of dollars. Our price is considered to be at the mid-range,” said the salesgirl smilingly.

Wang Xian listened to her reply and asked immediately, “Pretty, how do you differentiate a good Koi carp and arowana?”

“Red arowanas are the most valuable breed among the arowanas while Chilli Red Arowanas are the most precious breed among red arowanas. Koi carps are more expensive, in particular, from the island countries. Those that are larger in size with bright colors are worth a few million dollars.” The salesgirl explained to him smilingly.

Wang Xian pondered as he nodded. He asked, “If I want to buy Koi carps and arowanas that cost a few million dollars, where can I get them in the Rivertown?”

“Koi carps and arowanas that cost a few million dollars? You can check out the Flowers and Birds Market of the Oceantown. But a few million dollars of Koi carps and arowanas are not common. Moreover, not many people will purchase such expensive ornamental fish. Those that cost a few hundred thousand are for sale though.” The pretty salesgirl continued.

“Okay, thank you.” Wang Xian nodded with a smile. He pulled out his phone and did a simple search.

“Just like what the salesgirl said, Koi carps and arowanas that cost a few million are uncommon and not easy to sell. But people would buy a few hundred thousand dollar ones.”

Wang Xian ran through his thoughts. He smiled at the salesgirl and left.

It’s just noon. Let’s check out the Flowers and Birds Market.

After Wang Xian walked out of the aquarium store, he headed to the Flowers and Birds Market by cab.

The Flowers and Birds Market was situated at the East Ocean district of the Rivertown, and it was not far for him.

After a 20-minute drive, the car stopped at the entrance of the Flowers and Birds Market.

The Flowers and Birds Market of Rivertown was a more substantial market since many wealthy people resided in Rivertown, because it was one of the top second-tier cities.

Wang Xian went into the market. He followed the signs and strolled towards the fish viewing area.

On the way, he saw a pet shop selling pet dogs for fifty thousand dollars.

“A pet dog can be kept for dozens of years, but a Koi carp or an arowana can be kept for one’s entire life. There’s a reason for the hefty price tag on the ornamental fish.”

The Flowers and Birds Market was well-maintained with wide and clean pedestrian roads. There were stores on each side of the road.

Due to the rain today, there was not much human traffic. Wang Xian went to the fish viewing area and began to skim through the individual aquarium stores.

“There will be a two-day Goldfish Fair starting tomorrow. It will attract many local people and those from other cities. The exhibition will bring a large amount of human traffic. So, let’s do a proper clean-up today.”

“Goldfish Fair? Is it the exhibition jointly organized by the Jinhua Goldfish Farm, Longlian Goldfish Farm, and other large-scale goldfish farms?”

“That’s right. The exhibition organized by these goldfish farms will attract many customers. After all, these goldfish farms are among the market’s top list.”

“I wonder what kind of goldfish they will be exhibiting tomorrow. Will there be rare goldfish like Redcap Brown Oranda?”

“Hard to say. But given the resources of those goldfish farms, there might be Redcap Brown Oranda.”

When Wang Xian walked into one of the aquarium stores, he overheard the conversation in the shop.

He was stupefied for a moment. “Goldfish?”

Goldfish was the most commonly seen ornamental fish breed. Even though they were common, rare breeds could fetch up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. The Redcap Brown Oranda they mentioned could sell for three to four hundred thousand dollars. It was known as the most expensive goldfish in the world.

“If there is a Goldfish Fair tomorrow...” He raised his eyebrows and looked at some of the goldfish in the store with an idea. “Give me some goldfish, Boss.”

“What kind of goldfish do you want? The goldfish that I have are premier grades, incomparable to those goldfish stalls from the flea markets.” The middle-aged storeowner chuckled as he spoke after hearing Wang Xian.

“Okay.” Wang Xian nodded and observed the goldfish in his store. He realized that the goldfish here were indeed costly. Some cost forty to fifty dollars each while others cost a few hundred dollars each.

“Boss, give me two of this, three of this and three of that.” Wang Xian observed the colors on some of the goldfish as he spoke.

“Sure. Four fifty, please. Pal, I’ll give you a fishbowl for free.” The store owner put up a smiling face while speaking to him.

“Thank you.” Wang Xiang smiled and handed the money to the store owner.

“It’s quite expensive, but I would reap profits thousandfold if I succeed.”

Radiance flickered in Wang Xian’s eyes as he lugged eight goldfish out of the door.

He took a cab and headed back to school. On the way, Wang Xian researched a lot of information on goldfish.

After doing research for the entire afternoon, he realized that Koi carps had the highest value, followed by arowanas. Wang Xian wanted to improvise some arowanas for sale. But the Goldfish Fair spoiled his plan.

Even though arowanas had a high value, it was more than ten times bigger in size than the goldfish. Hence, the consumption of the Dragon Energy would be high. His current level of Dragon Energy was still quite low. Besides, the value of the goldfish was not bad either.

Tomorrow is the Goldfish Fair. There must be buyers. I can use my Dragon Energy to upgrade a few goldfish that are of high worth.

Wang Xian thought to himself as he hugged the goldfish under the umbrella and headed towards the dormitory.

The rain was still as heavy as before, and there were only a few students in the school compound. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

That...seems to be him. As she entered the school gate, Guan Shuqing was holding onto an umbrella when she saw the figure who was pacing briskly pass her.

She stared at his umbrella and the clothes he was wearing with radiance flickering in her eyes.

Guan Shuqing hesitated, but she quickly caught up and called out, “Hey, you.”

“Huh?” Wang Xian looked back in complete bewilderment when he heard a voice from behind.

It’s really him. Guan Shuqing recognized Wang Xian’s face with an astonishing expression on her face.

“It’s really you. Thank you for your help today,” Guan Shuqing walked over and said gratefully.

“Guan Shuqing?” Wang Xian was slightly stunned, but he nodded with a smile.

“Do you know me?” asked Guan Shuqing, surprised when he called out her name.

“How could I not know the renowned beauty of Class of 2020?” Wang Xian looked at her and chuckled.
