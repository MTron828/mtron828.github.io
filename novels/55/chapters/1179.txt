Chapter 1180: During the Battle of 1181 against the Void interpretation ferocious beast

Translator: 5496903

“Roar!”

The Purple Lightning on the Spirit Purple Unicorn’s body disappeared, but it did not stop its monstrous flames. Layers of lightning swirled around it, making it look extremely mystical.

Boom

At this moment, the void exploded. Its speed was increased by more than twice, and it attacked Wang Xian like a bolt of lightning.

“Earth burial entanglement!”

Wang Xian took a deep breath and shook his arms. The earthy yellow energy and the green wood attribute energy were directed forward.

The earthy yellow mist that covered a hundred meters was directly in front of him. When the spirit purple qilin rushed over, thorns grew rapidly in the earthy yellow space.

Earth and wood countered each other and attacked each other. Under this kind of attack, the thorns connected to every single grain of soil in an instant.

Under the counteraction of these chaotic attributes, they formed a dense cage made of thorns.

This cage covered the spirit Zilin directly

The earth burial entwining force was doubled under the burst of energy from the counteraction of the two attributes.

The tough thorns completely wrapped around the spirit Zilin.

“Roar!”

The Spirit Zilin flapped its wings violently and the thorns were cut off by its sharp wings.

However, during this period of time, Wang Xian had already restrained Ling Zilin for a few seconds.

“Gold crack void!”

Without any hesitation, Wang Xian released his metal-type divine ability once again.

The terrifying golden glow seemed to pierce through the void. In an instant, it landed on Ling Zilin’s body.

“Ow!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Ling Zilin let out a painful cry once again and immediately broke free from the encirclement of the Earth burial.

A half-meter deep wound appeared on his abdomen, and bright red blood flowed out slowly.

Wang Xian retreated hurriedly and exhaled slightly.

The continuous attacks were either combined elemental attacks or supernatural powers.

Each attack could easily kill a half-step void interpretation level powerhouse.

“When I’m in my human form, I have to use a combination attack or supernatural powers to deal with a first-stage void interpretation level powerhouse. Otherwise, I can’t hurt a void interpretation level powerhouse at all!”

“Furthermore, I can’t let a void interpretation expert get close to me. Otherwise, my defense won’t be able to withstand it!”

Wang Xian analyzed the battle just now and looked at Ling Zilin who was attacking him again. He took a deep breath.

“Water tomb!”

He waved his arms again and an ocean appeared in front of Ling Zilin.

Earlier, he had used Earth and wood to create a strong binding domain.

At this moment, Wang Xian had used water and wood to create a strong binding domain once again.

The moment Ling Zilin was covered by the ocean water, countless thorns grew out from the surroundings and covered it once again.

“Water hazard explosion!”

Once again, Wang Xian unleashed his supernatural ability.

Ling Zilin, who was trapped in the water tomb, was directly covered by his supernatural ability.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

After continuously attacking, the spirit purple qilin that had been suppressed all this while let out an angry roar.

Its purple fur directly exploded, and purple lightning flowed on its fur that was dozens of centimeters long.

The surrounding water energy was directly evaporated.

“Roar!”

The Spirit Purple Qilin let out a roar, and densely packed lightning bolts that were like golden needles covered the surrounding area.

The terrifying purple lightning bolts covered an area of two to three kilometers.

It was a completely indiscriminate attack.

Wang Xian’s expression changed drastically. Dragon scales appeared all over his body. The earthy yellow soil rapidly covered his entire body.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The terrifying sound of the collision caused Wang Xian’s body to tremble.

“Roar!”

At this moment, the furious Ling Zilin let out a roar. All the lightning and golden needles condensed into a terrifying lightning bolt that pierced through Wang Xian.

“Let’s give it a try!”

Wang Xian took a deep breath. His eyes narrowed slightly as three types of energy — gold, fire, and earth — appeared in front of him instantly.

The three types of energy rapidly condensed into a small mountain about one meter in size and attacked straight ahead.

Fire creates Earth, Earth creates gold!

Earth creates gold, and fire suppresses gold!

The soil wrapped the gold in the middle and the terrifying flames burned the earth attribute outside.

Under such circumstances, the three unstable attributes were like an unstable planet.

Star explosion was a very feasible attack method that Wang Xian felt was a fusion of the three attributes.

Once it was unleashed, it could definitely be comparable to the attack of the Divine Dragon Queen.

Buzz

However, the moment Wang Xian unleashed his attack, the condensed attack became restless.

“Oh no, I failed!”

His expression changed drastically as he moved his body.

“Roar!”

A dragon’s roar came from his mouth. His terrifying fifty-meter-long body retreated rapidly.

“Boom!”

Before the Star Explosion’s attack could meet the spirit purple qilin’s lightning, a terrifying explosion occurred.

The terrifying explosion sent out a wave of smoke.

“F * ck, this is bad!”

His expression changed slightly. He didn’t have time to defend himself and was directly hit by the aftershock of the explosion.

Streams of blood appeared around the dragon’s scales at the position of the dragon’s body, causing Wang Xian to feel a little numb.

The lightning from the Ling Zilin dissipated directly in the explosion.

“So powerful. If this move can be executed perfectly, even if I don’t transform into a divine dragon, I can still severely injure a powerhouse at the first level of the Seethrough Realm!”

Wang Xian swayed his body which was in pain. His body moved and excitement could be seen in his eyes.

“Next, it’s time to see the combat strength of my Dragon Transformation!”

“Roar!”

Wang Xian let out a dragon’s roar and swayed his gigantic body which was 50 meters long. Two gigantic dragon claws attacked the spirit Zilin directly.

The sudden transformation of Wang Xian into a divine dragon shocked the spirit Zilin beast slightly. A hint of fear could be seen in its eyes.

Clearly, the 50-meter-long divine dragon body had filled the Spirit Zilin beast with fear.

“Roar!”

However, when the bloodthirsty beast sensed that Wang Xian was not able to suppress it completely, it let out a wild roar and charged forward. Its purple eyes slowly turned blood-red.

Clearly, the Spirit Zilin Beast had slowly entered a berserk state.

“Let me show you my strength!”

“Extreme ice and fire explosion!”

His two dragon claws, which were seven to eight meters in size, one was emitting a fiery red light while the other was emitting a blue light. With a wave of his dragon claws, he directly attacked Ling Zilin.

“Roar!”

Ling Zilin directly raised his front hooves and stepped forward without the slightest bit of fear.

Two thick lightning figures that were like hooves directly charged towards the extreme ice and fire explosion.

Boom

A terrifying collision resounded within a radius of tens of kilometers. The ferocious beasts below fled in fear.

The collision of the void interpretation level had truly begun.

Wang Xian’s attack just now had only slightly injured the spirit purple qilin.

“Alright, let’s see how many times you can withstand my attacks. Haha!”

Wang Xian’s face was filled with confidence. His huge dragon tail swept across.

The entire flame was like a mixture of lava. It was extremely red. Drops of red liquid even dripped downwards.

Divine ability, divine dragon fire tail!
