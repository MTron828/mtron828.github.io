Chapter 3090: 3089 killed him in one move

Huh?

All of them came?

When the group of experts heard Wang Xian’s words, they were slightly stunned and looked at him in astonishment.

What did he mean by that?

Also, why was this guy so calm?

Did the Dragon Palace not know about the current situation in the outside world?

Didn’t they know about the strength of the chief of the Mohan Clan?

“I really hate you, so you can go to hell!”

The clan leader of the Mohan clan stared at Wang Xian with a hint of coldness in his eyes.

He really hated this calm and composed young man in front of him.

Since he was so reckless, he could die as well.

Boom

As he spoke, he waved his arm and black characters flew out from his body. The characters instantly condensed into a “Kill”character and attacked Wang Xian.

“Level One universe knight? You’re courting death!”

As Wang Xian spoke, his figure disappeared instantly.

When the black “Kill”character had just arrived in the middle of them, before the chief of the Mohan clan could react, Wang Xian’s figure had already arrived behind him.

The Dragon Claw penetrated his body directly.

At this moment, it was as if space had frozen.

The clan leader of the Mo Han clan widened his eyes. His pupils dilated bit by bit, and his eyes were filled with disbelief.

“Cough Cough Cough!”

After a full second of silence, a special horrifying sound came from the side.

On both sides, the elders of the Mo Han clan all opened their mouths wide and let out sounds of shock. Their bodies trembled violently.

They turned their heads stiffly and stared at this unbelievable scene.

“You have offended the wrong person. Since the Mohan clan has been wiped out, you should disappear forever. There is no need for you to appear again.”

Wang Xian’s voice rang out. Waves of deathly silent energy came from the Dragon Claw.

The deathly silent five elements energy entered the body of the clan leader of the Mohan clan and quickly melted his life force.

“No, no, no, don’t kill me!”

Feeling the loss of life force in his body, the chief of the Mohan clan revealed a look of panic and fear.

He cried out involuntarily and wanted to resist.

However, Wang Xian’s dragon claws had already pierced through his body. Standing behind him, he had completely suppressed him.

The chief of the Mohan clan widened his eyes and was filled with disbelief.

He was a universe knight!

He had just broken through less than a day ago.

He didn’t want to die!

“Stop, stop, let go of our clan leader!”

At this moment, the elders of the Mohan clan also reacted. They roared loudly, and a terrifying aura surged from their bodies as they attacked Wang Xian.

Hualala

Wang Xian looked at them and saw chains appearing around them. The chains instantly wrapped around them.

“What!”

The elders of the Mohan clan stared with their eyes wide open. Their eyes were filled with shock as they looked at the chains binding their bodies.

Hiss

At this moment, the bodies of the experts from the surrounding races trembled as they looked at the scene in front of them in horror.

What was going on?

The powerful and invincible universe knight-level clan leader of the Mohan clan was instantly killed by the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!

The other pinnacle emperor elders were restrained by the Dragon King with just a glance.

This scene was beyond his imagination.

They had never expected this scene.

“That… that Dragon King of the Dragon Palace has the power of a universe knight, and he is not an ordinary universe knight!”

“My God, this, this, this… how is this possible!”

Growls came out from the mouths of the experts of the various races. They kept swallowing their saliva.

Who could imagine such an ending?

“Die!”

Wang Xian’s faint voice continued to ring out like a trial.

A grayish five elements power completely enveloped the entire body of the chief of the Mohan clan.

“Peng!”

He threw it casually like throwing a dead dog. He threw it in front of Prime Minister Gui, Ba Qi, and the other leaders of the Dragon Palace.

He glanced at the nine elders of the Mohan clan and pulled at the air with his hand.

“Crash!”

“No!”

The chains contracted and a scream sounded.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

At the same time, bodies were casually thrown in front of the Dragon Gate.

“Gulp!”

Seeing the ten experts being casually killed, the experts of the other races couldn’t help but take two steps back.

They glanced at the corpses and felt their scalps go numb.

The remaining experts of the Mo Han clan were already invincible in their eyes. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The powerful race of the Qian Hai clan, one of the top domain-level races in this starry sky, was easily destroyed by them.

However, the experts that they couldn’t resist were easily killed by the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.

They could not resist at all.

They still wanted to watch the Dragon Palace being destroyed, but now…

“It’s time to talk about our matters!”

Wang Xian looked at the powerhouses from the other races and revealed a smile.

Buzz

At this moment, at the back, God Emperor Hong Tian’s face was pale and his forehead was filled with cold sweat.

His figure slowly started to turn illusory.

Wang Xian looked at him. Around him, space started to collapse. God Emperor Hong Tian, who wanted to escape back to his divine kingdom, appeared.

Whoosh

With a face full of fear, he quickly turned around and wanted to walk out.

Roar

However, at this moment, a dragon’s roar sounded. An illusory eight-colored divine dragon entered his body directly.

“No!”

God Emperor Hong Tian screamed with a face full of despair.

Wang Xian waved his hand and threw god Emperor Hong Tian’s corpse to the side.

Eleven corpses lay there quietly. The weakest among them was the strongest expert in this starry sky.

“Greetings… Dragon King!”

The leader of the mountain-piercer tribe trembled and immediately knelt on the ground. He shouted at Wang Xian.

The other experts of the mountain-piercing tribe also knelt on the ground and shouted, “Greetings, Dragon King!”

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

The other experts of the tribe followed suit and knelt on the ground. Their bodies were trembling.

They now knew that the sky had changed.

However, the owner of this sky was not from the Mohan clan but the Dragon Palace.

They knelt on the ground and waited for the Dragon King’s judgment with fear.

Especially the powerful beings from the living soul clan and the brain spirit clan, cold sweat kept falling to the ground.

They had a grudge against the Dragon Palace!

But now they didn’t dare to escape, and they couldn’t either.

Even the Universe Knights had died at the Dragon King’s hands. With the Dragon King’s methods, if the Dragon King wanted them to die, this universe wouldn’t be able to accommodate them.

They could only pray in their hearts that the Dragon King would not kill them.

“Everyone from the Nethersky clan, please get up. Prime Minister Gui, I’ll leave them to you to handle.”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the group of experts from the various races kneeling on the ground in front of him and said faintly.

After saying that, he turned around and walked into the Dragon Palace.

He no longer cared about these forces and they were not worth the attention of the Dragon Palace.

His goal now was the Milky Way.

“The Mohan clan has brought a lot of resources to the Dragon Palace.”

He murmured.
