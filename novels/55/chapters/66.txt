Chapter 67: Establish Dragon Sect

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

In the ocean, Wang Xian swayed his enormous body and swam out hundreds of meters away in a single move. He headed towards the spot where the Roving Lobster was at.

Roar!

A dragon roar was heard in the area filled with messy reefs. All the marine animals in the region were shuddering.

Soon, Roving Lobster, with a pair of two-meters claws, swam quickly and lowered himself. “My respect to the Dragon King!”

Wang Xian looked at the Level-four Roving Lobster and drew his lips. “I’m here to enhance your strength for your cultivation.”

“Thank you, Dragon King!” The low-intelligence Roving Lobster said gratefully.

Wang Xian swung his arm and instilled a stream of Dragon Energy into the body of Roving Lobster.

Ka Ka Ka!

The Roving Lobster gave off frying sound from his body. His body did not grow any bigger, but all his legs, including his claws, grew muscular.

His pair of large claws, as sharp as razors, were about 1.5 meters long. His legs were about the same size as the human ones.

Slowly, the Roving Lobster stood up. With a height of two meters, two out of eight legs were supporting his body. The rest of them looked extremely strong and durable.

The two claws located on his head were exuding mightiness. This was the authentic Roving Lobster General.

The Roving Lobster upgraded to Level Six after Wang Xian transferred 100,000 points of Dragon Energy.

Compared to a Martial Artist, a Level-seven Martial Artist was no match for a Level-six Roving Lobster.

“Guard this land of lobsters. That would be sufficient.” Sharp radiance flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes.

“Thank you, Dragon King!” The Roving Lobster knelt again and said with gratefulness.

“Carry on with your cultivation!”

After leaving his instruction, he made a move and headed towards the island where Mo Qinglong was residing.

When Wang Xian swam out of the water, Mo Qinglong immediately walked over humbly. “Dragon King!”

“Okay.” Wang Xian nodded and asked, “When will your subordinates be arriving?”

“Dragon King, they will be here in no time!” Mo Qinglong answered with respect.

“In no time?” Wang Xian looked at Mo Qinglong with astonishment. “So fast?”

“Dragon King, they were receiving military training. I called them just now, and they were not far away from the Rivertown. Now, they are on their way. I believe they will be here soon!” Mo Qinglong replied.

“Oh?” Wang Xian nodded his head with sharp radiance in his eyes. He looked at the shore where a ship was sailing towards them, “Are they here?”

Mo Qinglong looked over and nodded his head, “Yes, it should be them!”

“Where did their ship come from?” asked Wang Xian curiously.

“Dragon King, as an elite assassin, getting a ship is a piece of cake,” Mo Qinglong replied.

“Great!”

Wang Xian displayed a satisfied look while he waited quietly for the ship to arrive.

“Gather here!” When the ship docked, Mo Qinglong called out.

“Master!”

A surprising voice was heard. Soon after, a middle-aged man, along with a team of young men, ran towards him.

“Come here!” Mo Qinglong said in a low voice.

“Yes!”

A group of people crowded around.

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the people and noticed 50 fit and muscular young men. They were standing there uniformly without making the slightest sound.

A chilling killing aura exuded from them.

This bunch of people was not strong because they were from a sub-branch of the Ancient Fiend Clan, and none of them had learned Ancient Martial Arts.

Besides, at their age, their meridians would have stiffened up. It would be extremely difficult to do any cultivation. Only the middle-aged leader was a Level-six Martial Artist.

“This is the Dragon King, and he will be your king from now on too!” Mo Qinglong told the 50 people.

The middle-aged man leading the team revealed a shocking expression as he looked at his Master.

“I’ll take you to another world!”

Wang Xian walked to the center slowly as the Dragon Power gradually encompassed everyone.

Boom!

After the encompassing of the Dragon Power, the entire world seemed to have undergone a drastic change. Infinite oppression was suppressing them.

“Dragon King!” This group of well-trained assassins was horrified. They, including the middle-aged man in the lead, quickly knelt down on the ground.

“All of you shall not resist.”

Wang Xian swung his palm, and 50 drops of dragon blood emerged in his hands. He flung his arm and sent the blood to each of their glabellas.

Everyone was horrified and dared not resist when they saw the skills he displayed.

“Next, I’ll unblock your eight extraordinary meridians. During this period, you’ll focus on your cultivation. In the shortest possible time, cultivate yourself to the Inborn Realm and become invincible masters!”

Wang Xian swung his arm and injected a large amount of Dragon Energy into their bodies. He closed his eyes and unblocked all the meridians.

Unblocking their meridians would not make them Inborn Experts immediately. They would still require absorbing Spiritual Energy.

However, their absorption speed would increase by 100 times after unblocking their meridians.

Roar!

After all the medians were unblocked, they let out a soft dragon roar. All their clothes were torn into pieces by the domineering force. Faint dragon scales were attached to their bodies.

“Thank you, Dragon King!”

After everyone absorbed the dragon blood, they clutched their fists tightly with excitement on their faces. They knelt, and their voices echoed through the sky.

“From now on, you’ll be the security of the Dragon Palace, and will be known as the Dragon Sect from the Dragon Palace. The entire Dragon Sect would be led by Mo Qinglong,” Wang Xian ordered them.

“Yes, Dragon King!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Mo Qinglong knelt down before him thrillingly.

“Find a basecamp for everyone to cultivate!” Wang Xian nodded and said slowly.

“Dragon King, why don’t we make this place the basecamp of the Dragon Sect?” Mo Qinglong suggested while standing up.

“Here?” Wang Xian observed the surrounding. The entire island had a size of 3,000 meters. The surface area was enough, but the island was too bleak.

“It would take a lot of money to transform this place into the Dragon Sect!” Wang Xian slightly frowned.

“Dragon King, we have some funds here. Just enough for us to establish our basecamp.” Mo Qinglong was exhilarated. “Besides, my strength will reach the Inborn Realm soon. Till then, we can apply for this island to be the basecamp for the Dragon Sect.”

“Great!”

Wang Xian’s eyes glimmered with sharp radiance. “I’ll leave the Dragon Sect to you. I hope everyone can become Inborn Experts in no time!”

“Everyone will become an Inborn Expert within 100 days!” Mo Qinglong guaranteed, “Since we’ve got your bloodline, we can even strive for a more powerful level too!”

“From now on, I, Mo Qinglong from the Dragon Sect, will clear all the obstacles in your way! Everyone will worship the Dragon Sect!”

“We will make Dragon Sect well-known in the world and clear all obstacles for the Dragon King! Everyone will worship the Dragon Sect!”

The rest of the Dragonians at the back roared with passionate eyes.

Wang Xian swept his gaze across all the people. He bellowed to the sky, Roar!

The roar symbolized my arrival, the arrival of the Five Elements Divine Dragon, Wang Xian. I’ll definitely soar to the highest point in the world!
