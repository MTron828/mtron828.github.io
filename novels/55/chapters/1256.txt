Chapter 1257: 1258 nether deer

Translator: 5496903

“We’ve arrived. This was once the training ground of the blood stream sect. Now, the outer buildings have been destroyed. Only the entrance that was covered by the array formation hasn’t been broken!”

“The array formation left behind by the blood stream sect is very powerful. The main reason is that there used to be a spirit stone lode under the blood stream sect. The blood stream sect connected several important buildings to the spirit stone lode, increasing the power of the array formation by several times!”

“Even if all the spirit stones in the spirit stone mine have been dug out, the foundation is still there!”

When they arrived at the training ground, Long Xiaotian said to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian nodded his head. Looking at the extremely deep entrance, he then looked at long Xiaotian and his men. “Among them, there are not many who can follow us in!”

“Not many. There are only 43 of them. However, the ferocious beasts that brother Wang Xian helped to subdue this time are mainly at transcendent level eight. Our group’s strength shouldn’t be a problem!”

Long Xiaotian said with a smile.

“No problem. There shouldn’t be any problem with a transcendent level nine beast either!”

Wang Xian smiled.

“Haha, it’s All Up to you, brother Wang Xian!”

Long Xiaotian revealed an excited expression when he heard his words. He looked behind him and said, “Those who are not allowed to enter, wait for us around. The rest of you, follow me in!”

“It’s the Prince!”

Everyone nodded and waited around the trial grounds.

Over forty people followed long Xiaotian as they walked into the deep trial grounds.

“The entire trial grounds is very large. There are at least a million ferocious beasts in there, and there are all sorts of levels. There are even many void interpretation level beasts in the center. Everyone must be careful. Our main mission this time is the nether deer!”

After stepping into the training ground, Long Xiaotian said to everyone vigilantly.

“It’s the second Prince!”

The training ground on the human side was a thousand meters deep underground.

After walking along the pitch-black hole for a thousand meters, an incomparably huge underground world appeared before them.

In the past, this place was a mineral vein where the blood stream sect mined, but it was later transformed into a training ground.

The height of the training ground could reach up to eight to nine thousand meters, and there was a type of black tree growing inside. The tree was about a hundred meters tall.

The entire underwater forest world.

In this direction was the underwater forest world, and in front of it was the seabed. Half of the training ground was at the bottom of the sea.

In the pitch-black world, one could occasionally hear the roars of fierce beasts.

There were many people at the entrance.

For many families, sects, and dynasties, this was the training ground for their elite disciples.

There were many people in the training ground, at least tens of thousands of people.

Many mercenary groups would also organize people under the age of 50 to come here to hunt fierce beasts.

After all, compared to the cruel blood flow sect’s training ground, this place was relatively safe.

The blood refinement ground was the stage for the real powerhouses. It was difficult for anyone below level seven of the extraordinary to survive in there.

The arrival of Wang Xian, Long Xiaotian and the rest did not attract much attention.

In the trial ground, as all of them were cultivators below the age of 50, there were not many treasures here.

Therefore, there were very few fights. Most of them were fights with demonic beasts.

“Brother Wang Xian, follow me!”

Long Xiaotian said to Wang Xian and flew straight ahead.

In the training ground, they had already found their target and flew straight ahead.

The entire empty ground wasn’t flat. There were also holes left behind by mining. It was a complicated scene.

Wang Xian sized up his surroundings. His eyes flickered with a demonic glow as he looked around.

The pitch-black training ground did not pose any obstruction to him. Everything around him appeared in his mind.

There were no ferocious beasts at the edge of the training ground. Occasionally, there would be a few ferocious beasts that were at the second or third level of the supernatural realm, but they did not bother with them.

“It’s just ahead. Everyone, be careful. Surround all the hell deers. Don’t let them escape!”

Wang Xian spoke to everyone behind him as he looked at Wang Xian.

Wang Xian nodded his head and stared at the spot ahead.

There were many holes at the bottom of the forest.

The holes were dozens of meters deep. There was a four-meter-long black ferocious beast lying in each hole.

They had two horns that were five meters in size. It was as though they had huge weapons growing on their heads.

Not only were there ferocious beasts lying on the ground around the trees in the cave entrance, but there were also ferocious beasts lying on the ground.

“The nether deer is a ferocious beast of level eight transcendence. There are a few hybrid nether deer with the strength of level nine transcendence. There are about sixty of them. With our strength, we can definitely deal with them!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Long Xiaotian looked at Wang Xian and said softly.

“No problem. It’s very easy to tame a ferocious beast of level eight or nine transcendence!”

Wang Xian waved his hand. With his current strength, even a level two void interpretation beast would have a chance to tame it.

“Alright, the two of us will go straight for it!”

Long Xiaotian nodded his head heavily and waved his hand at the people around him.

More than 40 subordinates immediately spread out and surrounded the entire area.

Long Xiaotian’s strength was at the half-step void interpretation realm. He was much stronger than his subordinates. The two of them would not be in any danger if they were to invade head-on.

Long Xiaotian held a long sword that was emitting light in his hand and looked at Wang Xian.

The two of them did not bother to hide anything and charged forward.

“Yoo-yoo!”

When Wang Xian and Long Xiaotian charged forward aggressively, the hell deer that was lying around the trees immediately stood up. Their blood-red eyes stared at the two of them coldly.

“Attack!”

Long Xiaotian moved his body. The sharp sword in his hand drew out a ray of light and attacked the hell deer directly.

“Yoo-yoo, yoo-yoo!”

The hell deer let out a hurried sound when someone invaded. The surrounding hell deer stood up immediately and growled with a murderous aura.

In the caves, the hell deer walked out one by one and shook their huge horns.

“Just knock them down!”

Wang Xian was the first to strike. A golden ray of light swept toward the hell deers.

He didn’t use all his strength. He didn’t even have one-tenth of his strength.

Under Wang Xian’s control, the golden ray of light easily hit the hell deers who were at supernatural level 8.

At least twenty hell deers fell to the ground after a golden ray of light.

Long Xiaotian’s mouth twitched when he saw this scene. He looked at the five or six nether deers who were bleeding from the slashes and said, “Brother Wang Xian, I’ll leave them to you. Haha!”

Wang Xian smiled and moved forward.

“Yoo-yoo-yoo-yoo-yoo!”

An even more powerful roar was heard. The voice was filled with anger.

Wang Xian looked over. The five blood-red nether deers lowered their heads. Streams of black energy with a hint of blood-red darkness shot directly at Wang Xian.

He waved his arm gently and the attacks of the five supernatural level nine deer collapsed.

He waved his arm again and the Golden Light landed on the five deer, causing them to fall to the ground in pain.
