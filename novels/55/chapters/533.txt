Chapter 534: Crimson Bug Annihilated

Wherever the Dragon Sect went, there would be bloodshed.

The crowd from Diabolism was arrogant and domineering. After being through the incident with the Remains, Wang Xian didn’t have a good impression of Diabolism.

Now that the disciples of Crimson Bug were acting pompously and arrogantly before him, he would naturally not let them off. When it was time to kill, he would do as such.

Wang Xian didn’t feel the slightest bit of guilt for killing the people from Diabolism.

Similarly, he wouldn’t feel any guilt for killing his enemies.

As for those good-natured people, or innocent people or forces, Wang Xian would not kill rampantly.

All along, Wang Xian had adopted an attitude of not offending others if they didn’t offend him in the Underworld.

If others offended him, he would just have to kill them.

Naturally, the members of the Crimson Bug before him looked savage and even a little perverse. In Wang Xian’s view, they couldn’t even be considered humans.

Seeing how Wang Xian casually pointed to the ashes of the disciples from Crimson Bug while replying, the second-class forces around him couldn’t help but feel their mouths twitch. They looked to the thousand-plus experts from Crimson Bug and staggered back in fear.

They were afraid and terrorized.

After moving back a hundred meters, they finally stopped ahead of the Dongmen Clan. At this moment, they heaved a long sigh. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“What’s happening? The experts of the Crimson Bug are all here?”

As part of the mountain was blocking their sight, they couldn’t see what was happening to their right. When an Inborn expert from Dongmen Clan saw the second-class forces retreating towards them in horror, he immediately asked this.

“The experts from the Crimson Bug are all here. There are over a thousand of them and they are truly terrifying!” an old man answered, speaking to the Inborn expert from Dongmen Clan respectfully.

“They are really here? Haha! Great! Another devil sect will be annihilated!”

When that Inborn expert heard the old man, he couldn’t help but grin.

The crowd behind him also revealed smiles. Offending the Dragon Sect? These people must be tired of living!

Hadn’t they heard of the saying “You’d rather offend Hades than offending the Dragon King”?

As the people ahead had stopped, those at the back could only do the same. Some were rushing the people ahead of them impatiently.

As a result, the news of the clash between the Dragon King of Dragon Sect and the Crimson Bug quickly spread.

“Crimson Bug must be tired of living!”

“Music to my ears! The Dragon King is going to annihilate another devil sect!”

“The Dragon Sect is really high profile. If they really annihilate the Crimson Bug, all of Diabolism will probably be after Dragon Sect!”

“It isn’t just Diabolism; Dong Hua Sacred Sect will probably go after them too. He’s too fearless!”

The crowd behind discussed while, ahead of them, Wang Xian looked to the thousand-odd people from Crimson Bug with a radiant smile.

“Kill all of us? Give it a try! I do hope that the Crimson Bug has the capability to do so!”

As he spoke, he turned his body slightly to face the entire crowd from Crimson Bug. “Just to let you have a good death, I’ll tell you that the one who will be killing all of you is the Dragon Sect!”

“Kill!” Wang Xian ordered coldly. This time, it wasn’t just the fifty dragonians who struck. The 150 golden swordfish also struck.

Roving Sword didn’t make a move. This was because they weren’t qualified for him to take action. If he really participated, he would finish off all the enemies in a single strike.

Wang Xian would still like to see the true strength of the golden swordfish race.

“Kill!”

When Wang Xian made his order, all the dragonians and the golden swordfish race moved.

In an instant, terrifying killing aura filled the entire sky.

Energy of the Gold Summit, devilish aura, and unparalleled killing intent surprised even the people a hundred meters behind.

“What terrifying auras! Retreat! We’ve got to move back further!”

Those from Dongmen Clan who hadn’t reached the Inborn level paled. The experts from Dongmen Clan shouted immediately as they moved back rapidly.

The auras from more than a hundred fifty Inborn experts together and five Dan Realm experts could even suffocate an Inborn expert.

They didn’t dare to witness the fight at all as they rushed back in horror.

Obviously, when Wang Xian made his last statement regarding who would be killing them, the eyes of the old man at the forefront of the Crimson Bug group widened. Fear instantly gripped him.

When he saw those horrifying figures charging towards him, he instantly felt as though he was in an ice cellar. His body was shivering and cold.

“Oh gosh! This... All those behind him are Inborn experts! How can this be...? And those five at the front, those are Dan Realm experts. They are experts at the same level as me... How can this be... How can there be so many unparalleled experts?”

As one of the vice-leaders of Crimson Bug and a Dan Realm unparalleled expert, this was the first time he felt fear.

When Wang Xian said they were from Dragon Sect, his heart was wrenched.

Dragon Sect was the force that had annihilated the powerful Remains and this group of people before him was from the Dragon Sect!

That young man was the Dragon King!

Seeing experts charging towards him from all directions, he shouted in horror, “Dragon King, our Crimson Bug has no feud with you. Why do you have to annihilate us?”

“Because I want to represent justice. Therefore, I’m annihilating all of you!” Wang Xian answered in a nonchalant tone.

Pfft!

The vice sect leader of Crimson Bug also threw up blood. Looking at the golden swordfish experts that were attacking him, he immediately fled without a moment of hesitation. “Run! Run immediately!”

Run! The vice sect leader of Crimson Bug didn’t hesitate at all as he shouted in horror.

These terrifying existences had greatly exceeded his expectations.

Didn’t Dragon Sect only have fifty Inborn experts?

Isn’t the Dragon King the only Dan Realm expert in the Dragon Sect?

How are there more than a hundred fifty Inborn experts and five Dan Realm experts here?

What did Crimson Bug have to go against it?

The roar from the vice sect leader of Crimson Bug reverberated across Huashan. Even if one was standing several tens of kilometers away, he would be able to hear it clearly.

“Ancient Spiritual Sword Slash!”

At this moment, a ray of golden light glowed dazzlingly and illuminated the sky.

Rumble!

A ten-meter-long golden ray slashed towards the vice sect leader of the Crimson Bug.

“What?”

Seeing the golden sword ray approaching him, the vice sect leader of Crimson Bug was flabbergasted.

“Return of the Spiritual Sword!”

At this moment, an emotionless voice resounded and another long golden ray of a sword edge flew over.

However, this ray of golden light came from directly before him.

One from the front and one from the back. Ancient Spiritual Sword Slash.

The golden swordfish race resembled sword celestials. As they swung their blades, thousands of creatures were killed instantly.

Argh!

At this moment, a wretched cry reverberated throughout the sky of Huashan.

The path of sword techniques was widely regarded as the strongest path of killing. An attacking sword celestial was the strongest in the world.

Due to their gifts, the golden swordfish race had sharp swords from birth. After practicing the Ancient Spiritual Sword Technique and training in the Dragon Field, their sword techniques could triumph over the world.

The terrifying sword of killing was even sharper than the attacks from the dragonians.

Crimson Bug only had twenty-odd Inborn experts. There was no way they could withstand a wave of attacks from more than 150 Inborn experts. As for those who weren’t even at the Inborn Realm, their state was even more brutal.

After the sword of killing and terrifying devilish aura swept across, less than five people were alive.

When the vice sect leader of the Crimson Bug saw this, his vision darkened.

Two sword edges slashed across his body!
