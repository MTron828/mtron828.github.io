Translator: 549690339

“Alright! ”

When Wang Xian saw that Lin Niu was about to go over to the space-destroying forbidden ground, his eyes flickered slightly and he nodded his head.

He waved his arm and the Tai Chi Dragon Disc and the Five Elements Millstone landed on his body directly!

Both the Five Elements Millstone and the Tai Chi Dragon Disc had Wang Xian’s clone.

He could also see the situation over there.

If Lin Niu couldn’t end up, he would attack again!

However, with the five elements great mill and the Tai Chi Dragon Disc, it should not be a big problem for Lin Niu to destroy the forbidden space!

“Hahaha, boss, leave it to me! ”

Lin Niu laughed loudly and his body moved, instantly flying into the black hole!

“Forbidden Space, your doomsday has come, Die!”

Lin Niu entered the black hole and roared wildly. A terrifying power covered the entire forbidden space’s domain!

That overwhelming aura and the terrifying aura of demonic beasts enveloped the entire lair of the forbidden space!

On their side, they could also hear his violent roar!

When Wang Xian saw it, he smiled faintly and used his energy to support the black hole passage. He watched on with an expressionless face!

“A powerful enemy has invaded! ”

“Oh no, what level of demonic beast is this? Prepare all the experts of the forbidden space!”

“Call the Master of the forbidden space to beat us up, call us the forefathers of the Forbidden Space!

The shocked and furious roars of the experts of the forbidden space rang out in the black hole!

“This? ? ?

At this moment, all the powerful disciples of the forbidden space and the Sacred Academy were dumbfounded!

Their faces were filled with shock and astonishment.

They were all filled with disbelief!

Especially when they looked at the black hole.

The bodies of all the powerful ones could not help but tremble!

This place was very, very far from the base of the forbidden space.

Then, that Sage Wang Xian!

No, that Wang Xian, who was known as the Dragon King, actually opened up a passageway!

What shocked them the most was that.

That magical beast that could speak human language.

It was impossible to tell how it attacked, but it killed all the experts in the forbidden space in an instant.

One had to know that among them, there was an expert who was at the level of a ruler at level nine!

This expert who was at the level of a ruler of the universe at level nine could be comparable to the first elder, second elder, and Granny Yuan in the Flowing Water Forbidden Space!

Such a terrifying master was instantly killed by that demonic beast!

What level was that demonic beast at?

Even if it wasn’t a Heavenly Yuan creation-level demonic beast, it was probably not something that a master at the peak of the universe could compare to!

In fact, it might even be able to destroy the forbidden space!

Then, such a terrifying existence was just the Dragon King, the Mount of that Sage Wang Xian?

Then, what level of existence was this one?

A terrifying thought suddenly appeared in their minds!

Could it be?

Could it be an existence above the ruler realm?

Could it be the Heavenly Yuan Destiny Realm?

Granny Yuan, the first elder of the flowing water forbidden ground, and the second elder!

As well as the other forbidden grounds and sacred academies, the peak-stage ruler realm experts who had rushed over also looked at this scene in shock!

The strength of the Linniu was so powerful that it caused them to feel fear and astonishment!

“Although the strength of that demonic beast has not reached the Tianyuan blessed realm, its combat strength is still able to kill any peak-stage ruler-level powerhouse in an instant!”

A peak-stage ruler-level powerhouse from the undeserved forbidden land muttered in astonishment!

He then looked at Wang Xian who was floating in the air.

He was stunned, completely stunned!

What kind of existence was this person?

When did such a terrifying expert appear in the sword and Magic Universe.

Such a terrifying expert!

Was He in the Heaven’s origin destiny realm?

He felt that there was at least a 50% chance!

That was because if he was not in the Heaven’s origin destiny realm, how could he make such a terrifying demonic beast as his mount?

Shocking!

Shocking!

At this moment, flowing Water Haolian, Flowing Water Qingming, and a few other powerful disciples of flowing water forbidden ground were all stunned.

As well as Xu fangxue, Qi Jiangping, Qi Xiaohe, and all the powerful disciples of the surrounding forbidden ground were all stunned! All of them had participated in killing long Yinhao.

At this moment, they were all stunned!

Especially the powerful disciples from the surrounding forbidden space!

There were thousands of powerful disciples from the forbidden space around them!

Just now, Lin Niu had only killed a few of them!

Many powerful disciples from the forbidden space were still gathered in the surroundings.

In the end, that terrifying demonic beast had already charged towards the nest of their forbidden space.

It was going to destroy their forbidden space!

The young man in front of them was even more unfathomable!

In fact, he seemed to be an existence at that realm!

This? ?

“Damn, brother-in-law, you… You? ? ?”

Long Yinhao stood there in a daze with his eyes wide open.

At this moment, he was in a daze and similarly, he couldn’t believe it!

This? ?

This brother-in-law of his?

What kind of existence was he?

“Brother Wang Xian, which one is you?”

Long yinyin couldn’t help but ask again. Her small face was filled with shock!

“Both of them are me. There’s no difference!”

Wang Xian’s real body looked at long yinyin and said with a smile.

The body of the Void Divine Dragon at the side slowly disappeared!

“Brother-in-law, brother Wang Xian, is that your clone? Is that your clone?” Long Yinhao asked in a daze!

“Yes, it can be considered as such. Due to an unexpected opportunity, I obtained a clone. Hence, it allowed me to cultivate the attributes of the controls. In essence, there is no difference! ”

Wang Xian smiled and replied again!

“Then… then, brother… are you an existence from the Heaven’s origin?” Long Yinhao widened his eyes and continued to ask!

His question made the hearts of everyone in the surroundings tighten. Their eyes were fixed on him!

They looked at Wang Xian in fear and waited for his answer!

This was especially so for the great elder and the rest of the people in the flowing water forbidden ground. They clenched their fists tightly.

It was very important to them whether it was the heaven’s origin creation or not!

That was because the signal that Wang Xian had just expressed.

Was not friendly to them!

Furthermore, the actions that they had just displayed had also provoked this existence.

“He has not reached the realm yet! ”

Wang Xian did not hide anything and answered directly!

His words made many people in the area heave a sigh of relief!

However, the next sentence made everyone’s eyes widen!

“As for his combat strength, I will only be able to confirm it when I have a clash with the Heaven’s origin creation! ”

This was Wang Xian’s second sentence!

Yes, he was going to have a duel with the Heaven’s origin creation!

The Heaven’s origin creation powerhouses from the sword and Magic Universe would definitely have a duel with Wang Xian!

This was because after Wang Xian had dealt with the space forbidden ground.

He would have to deal with the matters of the flowing water forbidden ground! Some of the powerhouses in the flowing water forbidden ground would have to die!

“This? Brother, brother-in-law, I will be your brother-in-law from now on. From now on, you will be my biggest thigh. ”

When Long Yinhao heard this sentence, his face was full of excitement as he roared!
