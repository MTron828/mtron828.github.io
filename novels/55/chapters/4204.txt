An unexpected piece of good news suddenly reached Wang Xian.

The news came from the celestial nation. It was from the Queen of the floating waters!

And the news was that she was about to break through!

The current her had a feeling that she would be able to break through in a month or two at most.

When the queen of the floating waters sensed that she could break through her shackles, she immediately passed the good news to Wang Xian.

After Wang Xian saw the news, his eyes sparkled.

This was a good thing.

It was also a good thing for the Dragon Palace.

Similarly, it was also a good thing for the nine-origin universe.

“The breakthrough of the Queen of floating water will definitely be a great joyous occasion for the nine-origin universe. At that time, all the powerhouses in the Heaven’s origin realm should be here.” Wang Xian thought to himself as his eyes sparkled.

It’s time to make a move!

Wang Xian made up his mind!

It’s time to make a move against the Phoenix clan.

To end all the grudges.

To end everything!

With his current strength and the current strength of the Dragon Palace, he could definitely make a move!

Previously, Wang Xian had the strength to destroy the Phoenix clan.

The reason why he didn’t do it was because he wasn’t 100% confident.

This 100% confidence didn’t mean that he couldn’t destroy the Phoenix clan.

It was because he was worried that the other heaven origin creation powerhouses in the nine-origin universe would interfere.

They might not help the Phoenix clan.

However, they might not let Wang Xian destroy the Phoenix clan for the sake of the nine-origin universe’s strength.

The calamity was about to arrive. With the addition of a powerful peak race, there would naturally be a large number of experts.

For the sake of the future of the nine-origin universe, there might be some heaven’s fate who would not advise Wang Xian to make a move.

Even the fallen shadow demon emperor might not let Wang Xian make a move for the sake of the overall situation.

This was what he was most worried about.

But now, there was no need for him to worry!

The Queen of the floating waters would break through and stand by his side!

With his current strength and the presence of Heaven’s gift, even the shadow devil emperor had to hesitate when he sensed this power and consider the consequences.

Wang Xian firmly believed that this consequence would be on his side!

Having made up his mind, Wang Xian sent a message to the queen of the floating waters.

“Brother Liu Lan Wangtian, let’s part ways here. Pm going back to the nine-origin universe!”

Wang Xian looked at Liu Lan Wangtian and the rest and said directly.

“HMM? Dragon King, why don’t you stay with us a little longer? We haven’t thanked you properly yet! ”

Liu Lan Wangtian said hurriedly.

“No need. I have an expert who is about to make a breakthrough. I have to go back and take care of some other matters. My clone will go back with me! ”

Wang Xian smiled and shook his head. He waved his hand at them and rushed towards the nine-origin universe.

Liu Lan and Wangtian opened their mouths and watched as Wang Xian and the rest disappeared quickly.

“Your first real battle is not bad! ”

Wang Xian said to Tianci as he rushed towards the nine-origin universe.

“Foster father, the main reason is that this person is too weak. Furthermore, it was you who made the move, so I used the immortal binding twigs! ”

Tianci said with a smile.

“This immortal binding twigs of yours is very strong. It can render some of the escaping treasures ineffective. It is very lethal to weak heaven origin powerhouses!”

Wang Xian said to him.

Tianci used the immortal binding twigs at the last moment. It could render a control-level powerhouse unable to escape even if he used a supreme treasure. Such an effect and ability was very terrifying.

It was worthy of being the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin!

“HMM, the next time, godfather, you asked me to fight more. In the past, I still had my companions to train and spar with. Now, there’s no one left. It’s too boring!

Tianci said.

“Hehe! ”

Wang Xian smiled. “If you’re bored, I’ll spar with you. ”

“Godfather, you’re too strong. Two powerful treasures and a powerful clone. Your strength is comparable to the Great Dao, right?”

Tianci asked curiously.

“More or less!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. “This time, follow me to the nine-origin universe.

I want to get rid of an enemy. ”

“Oh? Foster father, are you going to get rid of another Tianyuan Creator?” Tianci’s eyes lit up as he spoke!

“Yes, he is not strong. He is not as strong as you. He is one of the top races in the nine-origin universe. He has a grudge with the Divine Dragon clan who used to be foster father.” Wang Xian nodded.

Buzz

He chatted with Tianci and soon arrived at the location of the teleportation.

Through the teleportation formation, he quickly teleported to the tree of Chaos!

“This way! ”

Wang Xian gestured to tianci and quickly flew toward the Celestial Nation!

Buzz

Soon, Wang Xian sensed the aura of the queen of the floating water.

Beside him, a group of experts from the celestial nation gathered in front of her. Their faces were filled with excitement.

Wang Xian flew over and sensed the situation of queen floating water.

“Greetings, Dragon King! ”Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Greetings, Dragon King! ”

When queen floating water saw Wang Xian flying over, she immediately bowed respectfully!

The group of powerhouses from the Celestial Nation also bowed respectfully!

Their eyes couldn’t help but glance at Tianci who was beside Wang Xian.

From that aura, they immediately confirmed that this was a powerhouse from the Heaven’s origin realm.

“You ‘re welcome! ”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly. He looked at Queen of floating water and smiled. “Congratulations, you’ve succeeded! ”

(‘I have to thank you for your treasure, Dragon King. If not for your treasure, it would be impossible for me to achieve a breakthrough. ”

Queen of floating water’s face was filled with a smile. (‘I can already sense the mirror before my breakthrough. Now that the mirror has cracked, I’ll achieve a breakthrough in two months at most! ”

“It is your own good fortune that you are able to achieve a breakthrough. ”

Wang Xian smiled at her and said, “I am contacting the various Heaven’s origin destinies now. Your breakthrough is a big deal for our nine-origin Universe! ”

As he spoke, he took out a communication stone plate.

Buzz Buzz

Coincidentally, just as Wang Xian took out the communication stone plate used by the Heaven’s origin destinies to communicate with each other, a message suddenly came from it.

When Wang Xian saw this message, he was slightly stunned.

“Everyone should be in the nine-origin universe. Our Phoenix Clan has an important announcement. Ten days later, our Phoenix clan’s disciple, the Water Phoenix King, the Water Phoenix King, has made a breakthrough and invited everyone to come and watch the ceremony. At that time, our Phoenix clan will invite all the powerful disciples in the universe to a banquet to add a heaven’s origin creator to our universe! ”

This was a message from the communication stone plate.

It was a message from the emperor of the Phoenixes.

When Wang Xian saw this message, he was stunned.

This was such a coincidence!

The queen of floating water was about to break through to the Heaven’s origin blessed realm. It would take at most two months.

The Queen of the water phoenixes from the Phoenixes announced that she would break through in ten days!

The time taken for her to break through was merely more than a month longer than the queen of floating water!

This is simply a joke of fate.

It is simply heaven playing with the floating queen.

The last slot, was actually cut off!
