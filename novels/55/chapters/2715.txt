“Damn it!”

When the two patriarchs of the world margin sect saw the world margin ruler under Wang Xian and the rest, their expressions turned extremely ugly.

This was the cornerstone treasure of their world margin sect.

Now, it was actually being used by the enemy.

“Dragon King!”

The two of them let out a low growl. An incomparably terrifying killing intent surged from their bodies as they charged forward.

“Hehe, a stray dog.”

Wang Xian stared at them and spoke in disdain.

“You’re courting death.”

When the two patriarchs of the world margin sect heard this, their faces revealed an extremely violent expression.

They raised their palms and a wave of energy shot straight at Wang Xian and the rest.

“Dragon King, do you want me to take action?”

Ao qitian, who was at the side, looked at their attacks and asked Wang Xian in a low voice.

“Hehe.”

Wang Xian shook his head and stared at the people from the horizon sect indifferently. His eyes were still filled with mockery.

Buzz

Ao jian controlled the horizon ruler to move slightly and dodged to the side to avoid their attacks.

“Kill them. All of us will kill this fellow, the Dragon King.”

“Kill, Kill, Kill!”

Behind them, a group of experts from the world margin sect roared furiously.

“Useless rage.”

Wang Xian smiled coldly.

“Dragon King, don’t be arrogant. Before long, we, the world margin sect, will make all of you pay a heavy price.”

An elder from the world margin sect clenched his fists and roared with a grim expression.

“So what if I’m arrogant? I have the right to be arrogant to a bunch of stray dogs like you.”

Wang Xian smiled and continued.

“Dragon King, I hope you can still laugh in the future.”

The two patriarchs of the world margin sect were breathing rapidly. They suppressed the anger in their hearts and growled in a low voice.

“Don’t worry, there’s no future for you guys.”

Wang Xian stared at them indifferently.

“Let’s Go!”

The two patriarchs of the world margin sect growled with a gloomy expression. They turned around and left immediately.

“Forefathers!”

Around them, the experts of the world margin sect shouted with ugly faces.

“Let’s go. It’s very difficult for us to destroy the Dragon King and the others. Besides, the Dragon King and the others can easily escape by using the world margin ruler.”

“Fighting here will attract the experts of the imperial court. It’s forbidden for humans to kill each other here.”

An elder of the world margin sect said with a gloomy face.

“When can we take revenge?” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

A middle-aged man said unwillingly.

The crowd was silent.

They didn’t know when they could take revenge.

“If the Lord of the imperial court is willing to help us, we’ll have a chance.”

An old man said helplessly.

With their strength, it was very unlikely that they could destroy the Dragon Palace and take revenge.

However, if the powerhouses of the imperial court were willing to take action...

However, the chances of the powerhouses of the imperial court helping them were also very, very small.

“Let’s go. Once we enter the abyss, even if we can’t take revenge in the future, we won’t let the Dragon Palace have a good time either.”

An elder spoke to the back and flew straight into the abyss.

“People from the horizon actually appeared here. Looks like this horizon sect really has some connections with the powerhouses of the imperial court.”

At the same time, Wang Xian stood in the air and muttered to himself as he looked at the departing figures of the people from the world’s end sect.

“Dragon King, a thorny dragon is already following behind them.”

Ao Yao’s voice sounded from the side.

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly.

...

“Dragon King!”

“Dragon King!”

At this moment, two voices were heard. Poison nine and Mo Sha flew over excitedly.

Just now, Du Jiu’s name had reached the top of the heroes list. Furthermore, he had a score that was three times higher than second place.

Naturally, they had also obtained a huge amount of elixirs.

“Du Jiu, I’ll increase your strength first. Mo Sha, go and call the members of the poison making department over.”

Wang Xian stretched out his hand to receive their elixirs and said immediately.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Mo sha nodded and immediately flew into the abyss.

The gains this time could increase the poison making department by 25 Undying Level 8 and 3 undying level 9 abyss seeds.

As for Level 7, it could increase to 70.

...

After this, the members of the poison making department were all at least level 3 undying.

After all, there were more than 3,000 immortal king corpses this time.

Wang Xian took out the pills and swallowed them directly, turning them into a large amount of dragon energy.

Twenty minutes later, Wang Xian had finished digesting all the pills and waved at poison nine.

In less than two minutes, Poison Nine’s strength had broken through to the immortal King Level 9.

“Dragon King!”

At this time, Ba Qi and his men rushed over. Mo Sha was guarding the group of Abyss species that needed to live in the abyss.

“Begin to raise your strength.”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept over and a smile appeared on his face. This time, Ba Qi and his men could reach the level of 5 undying godly monarchs.

As for the level of 8 undying godly monarchs, they could reach the level of 28.

With such strength, even among the abyss species, they were exceptionally powerful.

“Dragon King, there’s news from the Thorn Dragon. The powerhouses from the world margin sect have entered the abyss and are preparing to hunt down an abyssal race.”

Just as Wang Xian was increasing the strength of the members of the poison making department, Ao Yao flew out from the Abyss and sent a message.

“Oh?”

Wang Xian stopped and raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Hunting down an abyssal race nearby? There’s a race nearby that has three immortal king level 9 abyssal races. This is our next target.”

Ba Qi frowned slightly when he heard this news.

“With the abilities of the world margin sect, they can definitely hunt down that group of abyssal races.”

Wang Xian stopped. His eyes sparkled as he looked at Ba Qi.

“Ba Qi, send someone to the world margin sect immediately. When they hunt down the abyssal races, think of a way to parasitize one of their members.”

As he spoke, he raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Oh? Dragon King, are you going to let us poisonous horned dragon seed devour them?”

Ba Qi’s eyes lit up as he spoke.

“There’s no need to devour them. We can also control their every move. As long as we control their actions, what happens next...”

Before Wang Xian could finish his sentence, Ba Qi also understood.

As long as the Dragon Palace controlled all the actions of the world margin sect, the Dragon Palace could set up an ambush for any future actions of the world margin sect.

“Dragon King, leave this matter to me. I promise to complete it.”

Ba Qi said immediately.

“Alright, I don’t want to parasitize too many. One is enough. As long as I parasitize one, the rest will be much easier.”

“Don’t expose yourself.”

Wang Xian reminded him.

“Don’t worry, Dragon King!”

Ba Qi nodded and looked at Ao Yao beside him. “Old Demon, let me see if it’s the abyssal race nearby. If it’s there, it’ll be easy.”

“This location.”

Ao Yao took out the communication stone plate and showed it to him.

“This is it.”

Ba Qi narrowed his eyes slightly.

“Dragon King, I’ll go over now. You just wait here for the good news.”
