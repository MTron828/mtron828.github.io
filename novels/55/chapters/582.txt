Chapter 583: Saint Forge Workshop Is Indeed Trash (3)

A young man, who could easily pass as a juvenile, was spotted in the center of the room.

At this moment, he was refining elixir pills at a rapid speed.

With compelling Art of Water Refining, his arms were swinging fast in front of him.

Before him and the rest were elixir pills forming at an amazing speed. Each pill contained an immense amount of energy.

They were familiar with this type of energy as it came from Level 6 elixir pills.

Level 6 elixir pills could significantly enhance the strength of Dan Realm experts.

However, only master-level alchemists could refine Level 6 elixir pills.

“Form, form!”

Wang Xian pretended to be someone great as he let out a bellow while elixir pills quickly formed before him.

“Done!” he yelled again when four elixir pills were formed amid a faint glow. Instantly, the room was filled with the aroma of medicine.

Everyone gasped involuntarily.

“Level 6 elixir pills! Level 6 elixir pills. Master, he’s a real master!”

The various in-charges could not help but narrow their eyes as they revealed a surprised look.

This young man looked too young to be an alchemy master.

He was the master that even Mu Family had handed over their materials to for refining elixir pills.

A respectful look surfaced on everyone’s faces.

“Who wants to refine Spiritual Equipment or elixir pills?”

With an arm swing, Wang Xian placed the four elixir pills in a jade container within a chest. They noticed that the jade container was already filled with all kinds of elixir pills!

“Master, master, we... we would like you to refine elixir pills!”

One by one, the in-charges from the various forces turned fervent and spoke immediately.

“Do you know the price?” Wang Xian stood up and said.

“Price?”

All of them froze for a moment before they turned to the five Tianwen Sect people.

“Two sets of material for one piece of Spiritual Equipment. Four elixir pills for three sets of elixir pills material. No other additional fees!” said the five men from Tianwen Sect to the in-charges as they slightly lifted their heads.

“What?”

“Gosh! That’s... that’s so cheap?”

“How... How is this possible? It’s much cheaper than Saint Forge Workshop!”

All the in-charges were stupefied as they widened their eyes with looks of disbelief on their faces.

“Yes, this is the price. Bring your materials over if you want the service. I’ll get all your Spiritual Equipment and elixir pills ready within half a month!” said Wang Xian indifferently.

“This... Master. Great. We’ll bring over the materials now!”

“Master, you offer such an affordable service. You’re a great master that Saint Forge Workshop can’t even be compared to.”

The in-charges of various forces were going crazy.

Damn, compared to Saint Forge Workshop, this master was not only someone great, but a saint.

They could save at least sixty thousand, or up to hundreds of thousands of Spiritual Stones as compared to Saint Forge Workshop if they handed the materials to this master.

Comparing the two of them, Saint Forge Workshop was just none other than an unscrupulous shop!

“Hehe, how can we compare you to Saint Forge Workshop? Saint Forge Workshop is absolute trash in front of you, the master!”

The five men from Tianwen Sect immediately licked his boots.

“Saint Forge Workshop?”

Wang Xian turned to the crowd as he recalled his last visit to Saint Forge Workshop. When he thought of the two masters, Xuanhuo and Qingming, coldness flashed in his eyes. He remarked plainly, “Saint Forge Workshop is indeed trash!”

At this time, people from Mt. Zhenliu, an alchemist and that staff member from Saint Forge Workshop who was following behind, stepped into the shop together.

They were looking around with disdainful looks.

“Such a small shop like this could actually house a master? What a joke!” the alchemist from Saint Forge Workshop ridiculed.

“What a trashy shop. What master!?” the several middle-aged men from Mt. Zhenliu mocked.

“The Saint Forge Workshop is indeed trash!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

At this time, an impassive voice came from the second floor, which darkened the expressions of the staff and the alchemist from Saint Forge Workshop.

“Who dares to badmouth our Saint Forge Workshop. Do you wish to die?”

Without any expression, the alchemist of Saint Forge Workshop shouted to the stairs.

“Heh heh!”

Upon hearing the voice from downstairs, Wang Xian chuckled coldly. “Chase them away. Those who want to refine equipment and elixir pills, bringing over the materials will do!”

“Yes, master!”

The in-charges immediately spoke with respect.

Wang Xian nodded and continued with his work.

The various in-charges and the five men from Tianwen Sect exchanged gazes as they walked down the stairs.

“Which ignorant dog is yelling in the master’s shop?”

One of the in-charges bellowed coldly.

“Who are you guys? How dare you say the Saint Forge Workshop is trash? Are you seeking death?”

The alchemist of Saint Forge Workshop did not recognize the group of people as he stared daggers at them with cold eyes.

However, the staff member of Saint Forge Workshop and the few middle-aged men from Saint Forge Workshop were taken aback.

“So what if I said Saint Forge Workshop is trash? Trying to stop people from commenting when you’re indeed trash?”

Immense aura began to surge around the in-charges of several forces. At this moment, they totally disregarded the Saint Forge Workshop.

Just now, they had really needed help from Saint Forge Workshop.

But even a staff member from Saint Forge Workshop dared to show them attitude and act brazenly.

They had already stomached their anger for very long.

If not for the fact that they required help from Saint Forge Workshop, why would they even swallow this?

Now that they had found a master who offered a more affordable price than Saint Forge Workshop, and a shorter waiting time, why would they give face to an insignificant alchemist?

Or even to an employee?

They were in-charges of the various forces.

As everyone spoke, they walked down the stairs with icy-cold eyes, glowering at the two people from Saint Forge Workshop with rage.

“We said Saint Forge Workshop is trash, and you asked us if we’re looking for our deaths?

An old man swept his expressionless eyes at the two of them, exploding an immense amount of aura and oppression that aimed straight at them.

“What? You... you people...”

The alchemist of Saint Forge Workshop had a huge change in his expression as he looked at them in fear.

“Hand over the things that we gave you, brat!”

The old man fixed his eyes on the staff member disdainfully.

“You people... don’t you want your equipment and pills from Saint Forge Workshop? You guys...”

The eyes of the staff widened with astonishment as he growled with an awkward look.

“The trashy Saint Forge Workshop? Damn you, the elixir pills and Spiritual Equipment over here are much cheaper than you guys. Why should we go over to your place?”

A middle-aged man could not be bothered as he screamed at them, “Get out of here now, and don’t taint this place, trash from Saint Forge Workshop!”

“You people...you people...”

The alchemist and the staff member of Saint Forge Workshop paled as they looked at them with surprise.

How could they say such things to Saint Forge Workshop?

Why did their attitude change so quickly?
