Translator: 5496903

“F * ck, void-level weapons and armor, a half-step void-level pet. The items that Phoenix Immortal is auctioning this time are too terrifying, right?”

“No Way, is this for real? Void-level weapons and armor are awesome, but this half-step void-level pet, isn’t it a little too crazy!”

“Having a half-step void interpretation level pet can build a big family, and make a big family not fall for a thousand years!”

“If I had a pet that could grow to half-step void interpretation level, I would be able to do whatever I want in East Sea City!”

“A treasure of this level actually appeared in our East Sea city. My God, if it appeared in the auction house, wouldn’t all the big families compete for it!”

“What does a half-step void interpretation level pet egg look like? Damn it, when the Phoenix Immortal is auctioning it, I must go there. Even if I can’t buy it, I must take a look!”

“With your level, can you go in? When the time comes, I reckon that even people from other cities will rush over to bid for this pet egg!”

If a half-step void interpretation level pet egg could be obtained, it could at least allow a clan to continue for another thousand years.

Within the Eastern Sea City, within a thousand years, there would be a half-step void interpretation level fierce beast guarding it, and absolutely no one would dare to provoke it.

It was even possible that even the dragon Spike wouldn’t dare to provoke it.

A treasure of this level was a fatal temptation to all clans.

When this news was confirmed, the entire Eastern Sea city was in an uproar, and even the news about the dragon spike was suppressed.

Everyone was talking about the Phoenix Immortal’s auction in six days. Their eyes were shining, fantasizing that they would get a pet that could grow to half-step void interpretation level.

Then, they would go on a killing spree and build a powerful family...

“It seems that the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop will also hold an auction in six days. Originally, they wanted to stop the Phoenix Immortal, but now it seems that no one will come even if they hold an auction that day!”

“That’s right. The Life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop will jointly hold an auction. Although the value of the items they take out is very high, it can’t be compared to Feng Xian at all!”

Some people thought of the auction jointly held by the life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop, and smiled faintly.

This time, the items that Feng Xian took out were too precious, and all the clans were moved. Some clans even prepared to sell their items to collect spirit stones.

This was especially so for the few large clans in eastern sea city. They had already prepared to use all their clan’s resources to snatch this half-step void interpretation pet egg.

“I knew that Feng Xian would definitely be unwilling, but I never thought that they would actually bring out such a precious treasure like a half-step void interpretation pet egg!”

At this moment, in a luxurious auction house, two old men sat there.

From the clothes they were wearing, it could be seen that one was the life and Death Pill Workshop, and the other was the holy item forging workshop.

One of the two behemoths was selling pills, and the other was selling weapons. There was no competition at all between them.

On the contrary, after the appearance of the Phoenix Immortal, they often cooperated. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

This time, the Phoenix Immortal held an auction. Life and death would join forces with the holy item to hold an auction to suppress the Phoenix Immortal.

However, what they hadn’t expected was that the Phoenix immortal had actually taken out such a precious treasure.

A half-step void interpretation level pet egg. which family wouldn’t be envious?

“I really don’t know why the Phoenix Immortal took out such a precious treasure for such a small auction. Is It Worth It?”

“You can’t say that. The Phoenix Immortal has been suppressed by us in star-moon kingdom. They have to think of some way. Otherwise, how could he have a foothold? This matter isn’t something we can control. Report it to the higher-ups and see what they say!”

“Alright, if the higher-ups really want to take out more precious treasures, that would be interesting!”

The two old men were chatting with smiles on their faces.

...

“Huh? Feng Xian actually took out a half-step void interpretation level pet egg and a void interpretation level weapon and armor in this auction. What a huge sum of money!”

When Wang Xian saw the messages in the Donghai City Forum from the communication stone plate, he was astonished.

“It seems like they are taking this auction very seriously!”

Wang Xian mumbled.

The news of Phoenix Immortal holding an auction a few days ago had already been publicized. However, following the joint announcement of life and death and the holy item, the auction was also held.

Furthermore, the items they took out were much more luxurious than Phoenix Immortal’s.

Phoenix immortal took out such a precious item again today. Clearly, she didn’t want to be at a disadvantage.

“A half-step void interpretation level pet egg still can’t be compared to a half-step void interpretation level bloodline.”

Wang Xian smiled.

This time, he could not blame Wang Xian for being ruthless. He had prepared for several days for this auction. Furthermore, he had to sell his bloodline. He had to hold this auction.

Looking at the various weapons in front of him, Wang Xian continued to refine.

A Day passed very quickly.

The assassination of the dragon spike was still going on every day. Many people were still trembling in fear every day.

However, the popularity of the auction was no less than that of the dragon spike assassin organization.

However, on the second day, the life and Death Elixir Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop issued a statement.

“In the auction six days later, we will be auctioning off a half-step void interpretation demonic beast cub. In addition, there will be a large number of precious treasures.”

Once this news was released, it once again caused a sensation throughout the entire eastern sea city.

“Holy Shit, is this the rhythm of the life and Death Pill Workshop’s holy item forging workshop going to go head-to-head with Immortal Phoenix?”

“Too savage, Good Heavens, a half-step void interpretation demonic beast cub. As expected of the continent’s enormous power, to actually be able to take out such a heaven-defying item!”

“Immortal Phoenix’s pet egg is obviously a fierce beast’s pet egg, but this is a demonic beast cub. The gap between the two is extremely large, and demonic beasts possess powerful intelligence!”

“The Phoenix Immortal has just taken out a half-step void interpretation pet egg, yet they have taken out a half-step void interpretation cub. This is completely crushing!”

“The Phoenix immortal still can not be compared to the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop. After all, their foundations are still too far apart, not to mention that they are working together!”

“It is said that the life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop have spread this news throughout star-moon kingdom. I reckon that when the time comes, even some families from star-moon kingdom will come!”

On the forum, countless people were chatting. Their faces were filled with excitement, washing away the killing intent of the dragon spike.

However, at this moment, in that luxurious auction house in the Central Region.

Supervisor Yi and the five shopkeepers stood there with worried expressions, reporting the news over.

The three women were already a middle-aged man with a frown. Hearing their report, their faces didn’t look too good either.

There was indeed a huge gap between the ferocious beast pet egg and the Demon Beast Cub.

The difference in combat strength might not be big, but the difference in intelligence couldn’t be made up for.
