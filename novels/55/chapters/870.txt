Chapter 871: 0872 invincible in the world

Translator: 549690339

When the last scream was heard, the entire world fell silent.

The battle in the surroundings stopped. Everyone looked at the tree world in shock.

“Roar!”

A roar was heard. The voice was filled with a domineering and invincible aura.

Everyone took a deep breath and stared at the five-colored divine dragon hovering in the sky in shock.

The Divine Dragon’s body moved and transformed into a human form. With a wave of his arm, a tree branch bound a body and extended to his side.

Wang Xian stretched out his hand and held onto the middle-aged man’s body.

The middle-aged man was already dead. His gaze swept over and a strange glint flashed in his eyes.

Supernatural ability, soul catcher!

Soul catcher could absorb the souls of the dead. After absorption, it could be placed on the soul-returning wood and turned into a soul fruit to resurrect them.

It could also absorb all the information in the souls and disappear into thin air.

Wang Xian looked at the ocean as well. The soul that was killed at the first instance was also absorbed.

He directly devoured the soul of the first young man that was killed. Waves of information surged into his mind, waiting for him to check it out. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

He raised his head and scanned his surroundings.

In the sky, the other ten people were in an extremely sorry state. They stood there in fear.

They were just a small mercenary group on the transcendental continent. When they were on a mission, they were chased by undersea creatures in the ocean and accidentally came to Earth.

They thought that they were invincible here, but they didn’t expect that.

Their leader was actually killed.

The extraordinary fourth rank leader, the most powerful existence among them, had been killed.

With his strength, he could deal with all of them alone, but now he was killed.

Then, what qualifications did they have to fight him.

Moreover, even if the powerful Dragon King didn’t make a move, it wouldn’t be long before they were killed by the experts of the Dragon Palace.

This made all of them feel a deep sense of despair.

Their dream of becoming a king had been shattered. Their dream of standing at the top of this small world and holding the lives of thousands of people had been shattered!

In fact, what awaited them next was death.

Everyone’s eyes were filled with despair and their expressions were extremely ugly.

“Kneel down, I can spare your lives!”

Wang Xian’s cold gaze swept across all of them as he shouted in a deep voice.

In an instant, the remaining ten people’s expressions changed slightly. Kneel down, let them kneel down!

Just a moment ago, they were still seated on the divine seat and asked the other party to kneel down. However, in just over ten minutes, they were the ones who had to kneel down.

The ten people’s expressions were extremely awkward.

However, if they didn’t kneel down, the only outcome awaiting them was death!

This was asking them to surrender!

“I Surrender!”

The expression of the shady young man changed drastically. Finally, he faced Wang Xian and knelt in the air.

“I Surrender Too!”

When the rest saw the shady young man kneeling, they hesitated for a moment before kneeling on the ground.

They were not some holy king or some ancient god.

They were just a small mercenary group on the transcendence continent. They did not have high status and did not have much pride.

If they could survive by submitting, they would kneel down.

For a moment, the remaining ten people knelt in the air and faced Wang Xian.

“Hiss!”

Upon seeing this scene, be it the gods of the western divine realm, the immortal gods and the disciples of the immortal sects, all of them were overwhelmed with shock.

The so-called holy king, the so-called ancient god, actually knelt down to the dragon king and submitted completely.

This... this...

Just how powerful was the Dragon King? He was actually able to make a group of experts, who had subdued the western divine realm, established the Sacred Glory Empire, and even made the immortal sects and gods kneel down, submit to him directly!

The Dragon King was invincible!

Everyone’s expressions changed drastically. There was shock, disbelief, and disbelief in their eyes. There were all sorts of people!

“Dragon King, Invincible!”

“Long live the Dragon King!”

At this moment, the faces of the immortals in the western divine realm changed drastically. Following that, the immortals knelt in the air and shouted at Wang Xian.

They had already submitted to the twelve people from the supernatural realm. Now that the Dragon King had subdued them, it was normal for them to submit to the Dragon King.

Therefore, the immortals did not hesitate and knelt respectfully.

Seeing this scene, the faces of the immortal gods and disciples of the Eastern Immortal sect changed dramatically and were filled with shock.

Ten terrifying experts had submitted to the Dragon King, and now the gods of the western divine realm had also submitted.

“Ahhhhh!”

At this moment, screams suddenly came from the center of the immortal sect.

“Dragon King, Invincible!”

“Long live the Dragon King!”

Everyone was slightly shocked. They quickly looked over, and their pupils couldn’t help but shrink.

The people of the Wild Beast Immortal sect killed all the immortal gods and disciples of the Chaos Origin Immortal sect directly. They respectfully knelt down on one knee towards the Dragon King in the sky like an ancient general.

“Dragon King, Invincible!”

“Long live the Dragon King!”

Slowly, some of the sect leaders took the lead and bowed towards the Dragon King.

Although they did not kneel down like the western gods, it was more or less the same.

It represented submission!

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

“Dragon King, Invincible!”

“Long live the Dragon King!”

Everyone was not stingy with their knees. They landed heavily on the ground and shouted at Wang Xian loudly.

One was invincible, and the other was long live!

As for the Hunyuan Immortals, they were killed just because an immortal had offended the Dragon King.

When one’s strength had reached a certain level, there were times when the offender did not even need to be dealt with.

Now, the Dragon King had also achieved this step.

Now, with Wang Xian’s strength, a single sentence from him could decide the life and death of tens of millions of people.

Today’s battle allowed everyone to truly witness the Dragon King’s strength.

Invincible in this world, able to suppress the rest of the world!

In the future, all the martial artists on Earth would have to respectfully address him as the Dragon King!

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the surroundings and a hint of a smile flashed across his eyes.

He didn’t have the intention of becoming the king and Conqueror. All he needed to do was to occupy the ocean.

Moreover, the mission of the Divine Dragon system was to occupy the ocean and become the lord of the oceans in the myriad realms.

“Get up. I have no intention of contending for hegemony and neither do I have the intention of becoming the king. In the future, the ocean will be the domain of my Dragon Palace. The water tribe will be the subjects of my Dragon King. Since you guys are occupying the mainland, I will not interfere in your matters!”

Wang Xian said faintly.

His words made everyone feel a little happy. At the same time, they heaved a sigh of relief.

If the Dragon King wanted to establish an empire, then everyone had to obey him and address him as a king.

The Dragon King occupied the ocean and did not interfere in matters on the mainland. On the contrary, it made them a little excited and grateful.

“In the future, if the Dragon King has any orders, we will follow your orders to the death!”

“We will follow your orders to the death!”

Although the Dragon King did not establish a country and did not participate in land disputes, the Dragon King’s strength was already a king in the hearts of everyone.

They did not dare to disobey the king’s words!
