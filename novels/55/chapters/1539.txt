Chapter 1540: 1540 to suppress all heaven’s favorites 3

Wang Xian looked ahead. At this moment, in front of the Black Lotus Lake, a group of young men and women were scattered around.

Exquisite tables and chairs were placed there. There were also some black pets running around.

“Looks like there will be quite a number of people coming today!”

Wang Xian looked at the huge venue. There were already hundreds of young men and women gathered there and conversing.

Ling Jian ‘er and the rest were surrounded by a group of people.

One by one, the young men and women were chatting with the young men and women from the Bingxin Empire with some compliments.

Many young men and women were dressed in the attire of their families, empires, and sects. Most of them were the core heaven’s favorites from second-rate forces.

The Bingxin Empire was the only one from a first-rate force.

“You’re here a little early!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and walked forward.

Wang Xian had an unfamiliar face. Moreover, he couldn’t tell which force he was from from the clothes he was wearing. His arrival didn’t attract anyone’s attention.

He looked at Ling Jian ‘er who was surrounded by a group of people and frowned slightly.

Ling Jian ‘er didn’t know him now. He had to think of a way to gain Ling Jian ‘ER’s favor and bring her back to the Dragon Palace.

He couldn’t just kidnap her right away?

It didn’t feel right!

“Give me some gifts. I forgot to bring Ling Jian ‘ER’s pet. Other than the pet...”

Wang Xian really didn’t know what Ling Jian ‘er liked. He rummaged through his interspatial ring and found a golden sharp sword.

It was a longsword of the sixth level of the void interpretation stage. It was much better than the sword in her hand.

Wang Xian came to a seat and sat down. He picked up the Teacup on the table and poured a cup. He looked at Ling Jian ‘ER’s seat.

“HMM?”

Ling Jian ‘er, who was in the crowd, sensed Wang Xian’s gaze. She frowned and looked over.

When she saw Wang Xian’s face, a hint of coldness flashed across her eyes. Then, she turned her head around.

“There’s still a long way to go!”

Wang Xian looked at Ling Jian ‘ER’s gaze and shook his head helplessly.

More and more people came. As one of the three super powers in the vast region, the heir to the throne of Wuji Empire was holding a banquet. Everyone had to give him face.

The disciples of the second-rate forces and first-rate forces flocked to the banquet.

Each and every one of the powerful heaven’s favorites had a strong sense of confidence on their faces.

Soon, the number of people gathered in the surroundings reached over a thousand.

The men were handsome, the women were beautiful, and they had an extraordinary temperament. Any one of them would be the best.

“There’s finally no one beside Ling Jian ‘er!”

Wang Xian saw the few princes and princesses of the Bingxin Empire who were beside Ling Jian ‘er leave. Ling Jian ‘er, who was not good at communicating, sat alone.

A smile appeared on his face. He tidied up his clothes and walked towards Ling Jian ‘er with a staff and a long sword in his hands.

“Ahem, this beautiful lady. I Am Wang Xian. I fell in love with you the moment I saw you. This is the second time we meet. This is a gift for you!”

Wang Xian walked over and said with a smile when he saw Ling Jian ‘er who was sitting there.

Ling Jian ‘er raised her head and fixed her gaze on Wang Xian. A hint of coldness slowly appeared in her eyes as she stared at him emotionlessly. “Did you follow me and leave the sculpture at the door?”

A cold voice came out of her mouth, causing Wang Xian to be slightly stunned.

“Ahem, ahem, this... this is because I really Miss Miss Miss Ling Jian ‘er too much. That’s why I leave every time I put down my things!”

Wang Xian smiled embarrassedly. This was a little self-defeating!

Don’t Tell Me Ling Jian ‘er thinks I’m a stalker?

“Take your things and scram. If I find out again, I’ll kill you!”

Ling Jian ‘er stared at Wang Xian with a frosty gaze.

“This...”

Wang Xian looked at Ling Jian ‘ER’s frosty face and a bitter expression appeared on his face.

Did I bring this upon myself?

“Eh? It’s you. How dare you come here?”

At this moment, a cold voice suddenly came from beside him.

This made Wang Xian, who was feeling a little annoyed, frown when he heard this voice. He looked to the side.

“Brother Fifteen, who is he?”

A curious voice asked Tian Qingguang who was beside him.

“It’s that priest, that arrogant and arrogant priest!”

Tian qingguang gritted his teeth as he stared at Wang Xian. His eyes were filled with ferocity!

Ever since he was thrown out from the fourth floor, he had lost a lot of face.

He had been thinking about taking revenge, but he realized that this fellow didn’t leave the Holy Medicine Clinic at all. This had been bothering him for a long time!

What he didn’t expect was that this fellow would actually come here!

He actually dared to come here to attend the banquet!

One had to know that the day he insulted the child of light, the daughter of Light, was a piece of trash. However, Wu Qingyan was also included.

Today’s banquet was organized by brother Wu Qingyan.

“Priest Wang? That fellow who dared to insult Princess Wu Qingyan!”

The young man next to him narrowed his eyes slightly and stared coldly at Wang Xian.

“That’s right, brother. It’s him!”

A hint of killing intent flashed across Tian Qingguang’s eyes as he stared at Wang Xian.

“Eh? Just now, this guy seemed to be confessing to this beauty, but he was rejected!”

A woman beside him sized up Wang Xian and said mockingly.

More than ten people from the divine light empire sized up Wang Xian as their eyes turned cold.

Wang Xian’s statement that the son of light and the daughter of light were all trash had offended the entire divine light empire.

“Get out of the way!”

Wang Xian looked at the people from the divine light empire surrounding him and said impatiently.

“If you want us to move aside, so be it. Who Do you think you are?”

“Pastor Wang, I wonder who gave you the courage to come here!”

The young man standing in the middle placed his hands together and stared at Wang Xian coldly.

“Don’t challenge my patience!”

Wang Xian looked at the young man in the middle and raised his head slightly.

“Hehe, challenging your patience? So what if I challenge you? Throw Me Out?”

The young man stared at Wang Xian and said with some sarcasm.

“Trash, I will let you know the consequences of offending me!”

Beside the young man, Tian Qingguang stared at Wang Xian with a dark expression.

At the place where the Crown Prince of Wuqing City was holding a banquet, they would definitely not dare to cause trouble here.

However, he did not have any scruples when facing this priest Wang.

This fellow had once insulted Princess Wu Qingyan. If he were to teach him a good lesson, the crown prince of Wuqing City would definitely not blame him. On the contrary, he would leave a good impression on Princess Wu Qingyan!

Ling Jian ‘er, who was at the side, saw that the people from the Divine Light Empire were targeting this young man whom she thought was crazy. She frowned slightly and ignored them.

“Scram!”

A hint of coldness appeared in Wang Xian’s eyes as he walked forward. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

An invisible force rushed towards Tian Qingguang and the young man.

“Bang!”

“What? How dare you attack!”

A powerful force rushed towards them, causing the expressions of Tian Qingguang and the young man to change drastically. Their bodies could not help but fly backward.

“Bang! Bang!”

They were located beside the Black Lotus Lake. Under the powerful force, the two of them fell into the lake directly, causing a splash and producing a loud sound.

“How Dare You Sneak Attack Me? You are courting death!”

The young man and Tian Qingguang fell into the water, causing them to be in an extremely sorry state instantly. They stared at Wang Xian and roared with a ferocious expression!

“What’s going on?”

The voice that came from this side instantly attracted everyone’s attention!
