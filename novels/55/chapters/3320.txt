3321 3320 was in an uproar

Time passed day by day, and the Dragon Palace was completely locked down.

And there was no more news of the destruction of the city from the Lich Kingdom.

It was as if the Dragon Palace and the Lich Kingdom were in a stalemate.

Some people in the universe’s AI guessed that the battle between the Dragon Palace and the Lich Kingdom would last for a very, very long time.

The Lich Kingdom still maintained a high level of vigilance against the Dragon King’s attack.

At the same time, they were also looking forward to the Dragon King’s attack to destroy him.

Once the Dragon King was destroyed, the Lich kingdom would be able to obtain victory in this battle.

A lot of time had passed in half a month. At this moment, Mo Sha’s figure appeared in Blackwing city.

Wang Xian looked at Mo Sha and smiled.

“Let’s Move!”

He said faintly.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Mo Sha nodded his head. His body moved and he immediately entered Blackwing city.

In half a month’s time, Mo Sha had completed his breakthrough. All he needed to do now was to wait here quietly!

Time passed once again and everything became calm.

Mo Sha and Ba Qi sneaked into the black wing grotto-heaven.

The two of them were parasitic on the strong lich, so they could easily enter.

However, Wang Xian could not enter. Once he entered, he would arouse vigilance.

This was also the reason why he could not join hands with them to deal with the thousand-eyed city lord.

Another half a month passed. Ba Qi and Mo Sha were looking for an opportunity until half a month later.

In an extremely luxurious small palace in the highest sky of the black wing grotto-heaven, a blood-red lich with densely packed pupils on his arms, face, chest, and even legs stood in the middle, a smile appeared on his face.

Beside him lay a lich. This Lich’s body was trembling violently, with only a faint life force remaining.

“Keke, it’s really hard to deal with. It took us half a month to finish it. If it weren’t for the Dragon King obtaining the poison from Scorpion Emperor City, we might not have succeeded this time.”

“Ba Qi, let’s go, let’s Go get the Dragon King!”

At the side, another lich laughed loudly and said.

The two figures moved and walked out. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Dragon King!”

Ten minutes later, the two liches stood respectfully in front of Wang Xian and bowed.

“Very good. How is the information now?”

Wang Xian looked at them and asked with a smile.

“We have all the information. Currently, every level 8 universe Knight Lich in the Lich Kingdom has a few secret teleportation arrays. The other liches don’t know about this teleportation array.”

“If we attack recklessly, the Lich Kingdom will be able to gather seven level 8 universe knights in five seconds to come and support us.”

Ba Qi, who was parasitizing the thousand-eyed city lord, reported.

“Oh? Let’s not worry about anything else. We are prepared to take action and destroy Blackwing City first!”

Wang Xian instructed.

“It’s the Dragon King. However, before we destroy it, we can get all the resources in Blackwing City.”

Ba Qi said with a smile.

“How long will it take?”

Wang Xian looked at them and asked with a smile.

“One day. One day later, we’ll look for you, Dragon King!”

Ba Qi said.

“Alright, we’ll Take Action One day later!”

Wang Xian nodded and watched the two of them leave.

After the two of them left, they were ready to take action immediately.

As the city lord of Blackwing City, the thousand-eyed city Lord had great authority.

It wasn’t difficult for him to get his hands on some treasures and resources.

A Day passed quickly. On the second day, Thousand Eye City Leader gave a notification.

In the entire black wing city, over 10,000 universe knight level warriors all came to black wing grotto-heaven.

“Why did the city leader call us here?”

“I don’t know, it’s probably related to the Dragon Palace. It’s all because of that Damn Dragon Palace Dragon King, he’s making everyone in the Lich Kingdom nervous!”

“If we can break through the Dragon Palace, I’ll transfer the Dragon God’s head and body to my own body!”

“Don’t even think about it, we only got the head of a demon dragon, I heard that it’s very powerful!”

Over 10,000 universe knight level liches from Black Wing City were gathered together, they didn’t have too many doubts.

Naturally, they wouldn’t have any doubts when the city leader summoned them.

Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong

However, at this moment, waves of terrifying energy came from above them.

This made the liches from black wing city slightly shocked, and their faces were filled with shock and horror.

“What’s going on? What Happened?”

Feeling the threat of death and the arrival of death, the liches roared in fear.

What on Earth had happened?

Why was there such a terrifying energy enveloping them all of a sudden?

Hong

However, before they could react, the gray energy in the sky swept downwards.

At the same time, an extremely terrifying five elements millstone descended.

Everything happened in an instant.

“Oh no, run, run, run!”

“There’s an ambush, run!”

Those universe knights at level seven could still resist for a while.

“You want to run?”

“Die!”

At this moment, Wang Xian’s figure slowly appeared at the side. With a wave of his arm, chains attacked.

“It’s the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!”

“What’s going on? Where’s our castellan? Where’s our castellan!”

A desperate voice came out from their mouths. Their eyes were filled with disbelief.

Boom

However, very soon, all the exclamations disappeared.

“You guys pack up. I’ll go destroy the city!”

Wang Xian said to them. His figure moved and flew out of the black wing grotto-heaven.

“Yes!”

In the depths of the black wing grotto-heaven, the eight-limbed demon fiend and the rest walked out.

In order to prevent any accidents, they did not show up just now.

Everything that followed was much simpler.

When a divine dragon floated in the sky above black wing city, all the liches’faces were filled with fear.

Then why did the Dragon King appear?

Where was their black wing city’s city Lord and the other lords?

The destruction of the city began!

Black wing city was very big, but with the five elements grinding, his attack speed was still very fast.

Streams of gray energy swept out and covered a radius of hundreds of millions of kilometers.

Within a radius of hundreds of millions of kilometers, all the liches were killed instantly.

A mouthful of dragon flame spewed out and a radius of tens of millions of kilometers turned into a sea of fire. It was like a land of lava.

Blackwing city was destroyed at a terrifying speed.

This attack was much easier than the previous attacks by Wang Xian.

In blackwing city, countless liches let out miserable screams and fled in all directions.

However, there weren’t many people who could escape.

When Wang Xian started to wreak havoc in Blackwing city, the news from this side was quickly transmitted to the lich king.

“How is this possible? How is this possible!”

This time, even the lich king was filled with disbelief.

The Lich King panicked!
