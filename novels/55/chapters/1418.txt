Chapter 1419: 1419, what was a chosen one? 5

“All of you are not worthy yet!”

When the last sentence resounded in the sky above the competition ground, the noisy surroundings instantly quieted down.

Everyone, a total of over 100,000 people, all looked towards the source of the voice.

The youth from the blood stream sect stood there with a smile on his face.

He did not pay any attention to the cold gazes of the people.

“Who is spouting nonsense here?”

On the stage, the tall and sturdy Qian Jun looked at the young man with a cold expression. His eyes were filled with cold killing intent!

“Haha, I’m not spouting nonsense. If I say that you’re not worthy, then you’re not worthy. At the very least, you’re not worthy now!”

The young man laughed loudly. His body moved and he directly flew towards the stage.

He was dressed in a black robe and wore a robe, looking incomparably carefree.

Facing everyone’s gazes, his expression was still incomparably calm.

His body moved, and he directly stood on the highest stage, smiling as he looked at the ten geniuses of the Flaming Sun Continent.

“HM?”

On the main viewing platform, the city lord and the headmaster of the Flaming Sun Academy frowned slightly, and a cold light flashed in their eyes.

However, when the Flaming Sun City Lord looked towards the direction where the young man was flying towards, he furrowed his brows slightly and his gaze flickered as he looked at the few middle-aged men and elders from the blood stream sect.

“Hehe, since you say that we aren’t worthy of being called Heaven’s pride, then I would like to know what a heaven’s pride is. Are You Like This?”

Nangong Huahua giggled as she sized up the young man. A faint sneer flashed across her eyes.

“I don’t deserve it. However, only someone like me can be called a heaven’s Pride!”

As Helian Hu spoke, the corners of his mouth curled up slightly as he spoke arrogantly.

“Haha, arrogant. You said that we aren’t worthy of being called a heaven’s pride. Only you are worthy. Then I want to see what qualifications you have to be called a heaven’s Pride!”

On the arena, the face of the youth ranked seventh in the flaming sun continent revealed an ice-cold expression.

As he spoke, his body moved, and like a gust of wind, he attacked Helian Hu.

“A trash who has just stepped into the eighth level of transcendence wants to challenge me!”

When Helian Hu saw the attacking youth, a disdainful expression appeared on his face. He waved his arm, and a gust of black wind directly swept towards him.

“What?” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

When the black wind landed on the youth’s body, his expression changed greatly, and a trace of fear appeared in his eyes.

“Bang!”

His entire body flew backward at an even faster speed.

“What? This is impossible. Ling Feng was actually killed in one move!”

“This... that young man also looks very young. His strength is so strong. You have to know that even Qianjun and Zhou Hai couldn’t kill Ling Feng so easily!”

“What terrifying strength. Who Is He?”

In the surrounding audience stands, when everyone saw Helian Hu instantly kill Ling Feng with a single move, all of their faces revealed shocked expressions.

“Just like this? He still dares to call himself a heaven’s Pride?”

Helian Hu watched Ling Feng fall heavily to the ground, and a trace of disdain and ridicule appeared on his face.

“You are too arrogant!”

The Blazing Sun continent region’s top heaven’s pride competition’s leader, Xiao Yue’s gaze flickered as he stared at Helian Hu and coldly took two steps forward.

With a move of his arm, a blue longsword appeared in his hand.

“Young master Xiao Yue is going to make a move. Young master Xiao Yue has broken through to half-step void interpretation. That kid actually dared to show off in front of young master Xiao Yue and crippled him!”

“He dares to say that our dragon and Phoenix Empire doesn’t have the qualifications to hold the Prodigy tournament. Hmph, teach this kid a lesson!”

“Young master Xiao Yue, teach this guy who doesn’t know the immensity of Heaven and Earth a lesson!”

In the surroundings, some of the spectators in the audience seats shouted loudly.

“City Lord!”

On the main viewing platform, the flaming sun academy’s principal frowned and shouted at the city lord.

“Let’s see what they want to Do?”

The Flaming Sun City Lord’s eyes flickered as he shook his head and watched with some solemnity.

“Hehe, more than twenty of the most powerful experts of the younger generation in the city have just broken through to the half-step void interpretation realm. Your strength is still not bad!”

Helian Hu stared at Xiao Yue and commented indifferently, “However, you’re still a little bit away from becoming a heaven’s favorite. If you can receive intensive training in the future, you have a chance to become a heaven’s favorite!”

“But for now, you’re not qualified enough. If you want to challenge me, you’re not qualified either. Come on, you so-called Top Ten Heaven’s favorites of the Flaming Sun Continent region, attack together!”

“Don’t say it, I Won’t give you a Chance!”

“Arrogant, arrogant guy!”

“Let me tell you, this is not a place where you can be arrogant. You want to challenge all of us? Arrogant!”

As soon as Helian Hu’s words fell, the ten young men of the Flaming Sun Continent Region revealed angry expressions. Each of them instantly erupted with a terrifying aura and charged toward him.

They were the ten strongest people in the entire flaming sun continent, yet they were actually looked down upon by others. How could they not be furious!

One person wanted to challenge the ten of them?

“Your tone is quite arrogant. If I defeat you, I alone will be enough!”

Xiao Yue’s face was also filled with anger. Her body moved and the blue longsword in her hand directly stabbed towards him.

“To be honest, you don’t even have the qualifications to challenge me!”

As Helian Hu spoke, a bone fan appeared in his hand. He waved his arm, and a black wind blew, directly facing Xiao Yue.

“HMPH, you are the first one who dares to be arrogant in front of me!”

Xiao Yue’s arm trembled, and several hundred densely packed blue water swords appeared around her.

The longsword pierced through the air, emitting a sound like a waterfall.

The two flying swords crossed together and rushed forward!

“You are just a frog at the bottom of a well!”

Helian Hu said with slight ridicule, and waved the bone fan in his hand several times.

“Roar!”

A fierce beast condensed from dark energy directly attacked the water swords.

“You have some skills!”

Seeing that his attack was easily blocked, Xiao Yue’s heart slightly tightened.

“Divine ability, water moon in the sky!”

He shouted loudly, and a water blue demonic blue crescent appeared in front of him.

Ripples appeared on the crescent, and each ripple was like a sharp sword, directly attacking Helian Hu.

“Water Moon in the sky, this is young master Xiao Yue’s famous divine ability, it will definitely be able to defeat the other Party!”

“Teach him a good lesson, let him know the consequences of being arrogant!”

Seeing Xiao Yue and the arrogant youth fighting fiercely, the spectators shouted loudly.

“Hehe!”

The youth laughed disdainfully, waving the fan in his hand forward.

Pitch-black spears pierced towards the crescent moon.

“Boom!”

A dull sound came from the collision.

Following that, two pitch-black spears continued to attack Xiao Yue.

“What?”

“Not good, Xiao Yue, be careful!”

The top ten youths at the back quickly warned.

“Water seal!”

Cold Sweat instantly appeared on Xiao Yue’s forehead as streams of water formed a seal in front of him.

The water seal completely enveloped him and protected him!

“Peng!”

The Dark Spears landed on the seal in front of him and the entire defense shook violently.

His body could not help but retreat to the back.

“Crash!”

In the end, the water seal collapsed, and the dark spear only disappeared.

“Xiao Yue, be careful behind you!”

“Be careful!”

However, just as Xiao Yue thought that she had difficulty dodging the other party’s attack, a cry of surprise came from the side.

“Hehe, I said that you are still far from it, far from it!”

Helian Hu, who was standing in front of him, arrogantly looked down at him and said condescendingly.

At this moment, Xiao Yue, who was standing there motionlessly, had an incomparably pale face. He sensed behind him.

A long dark spear stopped at the position of his back.

A feeling of powerlessness surged into his heart!
