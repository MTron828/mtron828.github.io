“My cultivation base has broken through. In the future, the resources in the yellow cauldron domain will have to be redistributed!”

Streams of golden liquid flowed into the old man’s eyes as he slowly walked out.

After walking out of the mountain peak, he looked towards the position in front of him.

“Grand Elder, your current strength is completely comparable to Ling Xiao. Heaven and earth, it’s time for our Chaos Origin Immortal sect to take control!”

The middle-aged man next to him said with a twinkle in his eyes, “We’ll go straight to the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect and ask them to hand it over!”

“That’s right. As long as we occupy the heavens and Earth, our immortal sect will be able to nurture even more elite disciples!”

The old man next to him echoed.

“There’s no rush, there’s no rush. Ling Xiao once killed my son. Now that my cultivation base has broken through, I’m completely unafraid of him. Hehe, I’ll let him experience the pain of losing his own son too!”

The old man’s expression was slightly malevolent as he spoke with a fierce gaze.

The middle-aged man and the old man by the side were slightly startled. They frowned and said, “Grand Elder, now that we have signed an agreement, immortal gods are not allowed to fight among immortal sects. The Disciples of our Chaos Origin Immortal sect are slightly inferior to the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect!”

“Hehe, isn’t there the Chaos Origin Formation? Let the disciples bring the chaos origin formation. We have been fighting with the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect for hundreds of years. This time, we will completely suppress them and kill all their disciples, especially their son. With his son’s talent, he will definitely become an immortal god in a few decades!”

The old man slowly opened his hand, and a large knife slowly condensed.

“Pa!”

He squeezed his arm, and the large knife immediately shrank into metal fragments, which scattered on the ground. “Kill him!”

“Kill! Ling Xiao once killed hundreds of our elite disciples. Today, we will pay him back tenfold!”

“These two days, the immortal sect will be discussing the first immortal sect disciple competition. The Yellow Heaven Immortal sect only has one immortal god. Ling Xiao has to rush over. This is the best time for us to make a move!”

The two middle-aged elders also had cold expressions on their faces.

...

“You did well today. Tomorrow, bring us to that Jin Ming mountain that you mentioned!”

In Yellow Heaven City, Xiao Yu raised her eyebrows in satisfaction and said to Feng Lingtian.

“Alright, Alright. Young Miss Xiao Yu will do whatever she says.”

Feng Lingtian smiled and nodded as he said with an apologetic smile.

“Come early tomorrow, Hehe!”

Xiao Yu raised her head happily and walked into the restaurant.

Elder fan watched from the side with a smile on his face. The corners of his mouth revealed a meaningful smile.

“Phew, luckily she’s in a good mood today. Damn it, she’s been on tenterhooks all day. Tomorrow is the last day. Hurry up and send this god of plagues away!”

Seeing Xiao Yu and the others enter the restaurant, Feng Lingtian wiped the sweat off his forehead and let out a sigh of relief. “Anyway, my father will leave tomorrow morning. He doesn’t have to train in the morning. He’ll just stay in the city for one night. Hehe.”

“Teacher, let’s go. We’ll play for one more day today. We’ll go back tomorrow!”

The next morning, Xiao Yu knocked on Elder fan’s door and shouted.

“Xiao Yu, you can go by yourself. Later, the previous elders of the Thorn sect have something to ask of me!”

Elder fan opened the door and said to Xiao Yu.

“AH? Then how boring would it be for me to be alone?”

Xiao Yu pouted unhappily.

“Isn’t there Ling Feng accompanying you? Master can’t accompany you today!”

Elder fan said with a smile.

“Okay, okay!”

Xiao Yu could only nod and walk out!

“This girl isn’t young either!”

Elder fan looked at Xiao Yu’s back with a smile. Unknowingly, Xiao Yu was already 22 years old.

“I think I’m already 31 years old!”

Elder fan shook his head self-deprecatingly. A figure appeared in his mind and shook his head again.

“Let’s go, Little Slave!”

Walking down the stairs, Xiao Yu saw Feng Lingtian downstairs and nodded at him in satisfaction. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Young miss, I’ll bring you to eat a delicacy first!”

The corner of Feng Lingtian’s mouth twitched as he said to Xiao Yu.

“Let’s eat while walking. It’s the last day today, we have to stroll around properly!”

Xiao Yu said with a smile.

“Young miss, can you be more ladylike? How can you eat while walking!”

When Feng Lingtian heard her words, he could not help but exclaim.

In the Yellow Cauldron world, the ancient rules were still maintained. Women had to be reserved when eating, and there was no eating while walking. It was very disgraceful.

And the thighs under this skirt!

Feng Lingtian could not help but take a look. There was no woman in the yellow cauldron world who wore such revealing clothes.

“What are you talking about?”

Xiao Yu raised her eyebrows and looked at him.

“I’m talking about eating while walking. It’s... It’s helpful for digestion. Very good, very good, hehehe!”

Feng Lingtian’s expression changed and he quickly said.

“Your desire to live is quite strong!”

Xiao Yu glanced at him and walked on the street like a young lady bringing her servant along.

The people in Yellow Sky City were already used to this scene.

They had also accepted the fact that their crown prince had become a servant.

“They should be heading to Jin Mingshan!”

“They must go to Jin yaotai to go to Jin Mingshan. Make preparations there!”

“There’s another girl who is very powerful. According to the information we received, elder Jin and the others died at the hands of this girl.”

“That girl came from the Dragon Gate, which used to be a big force in the jianghu. We don’t know anything else about her.”

“The murderer who killed Jin Kunming? No matter who she is, kill them all!”

“Yes!”

In the sky, a mirror reflected the figures of Xiao Yu and Feng Lingtian.

Beside a middle-aged man, there were more than ten people standing around.

The middle-aged man in the middle concealed everyone with the strength of an immortal God. Even the four strange demons who had been following Xiao Yu all this time did not notice that there were people in the sky.

“This is Mount Jin Ming. You’ve never seen a golden waterfall before, right?”

Mount Jin Ming was located at the junction between Yellow Heaven Immortal sect and Hunyuan Immortal sect.

It was a mountain that was a thousand meters tall. A waterfall was left behind on the mountain peak.

At the spot where the waterfall had washed over, the mountain was golden. In the morning, under the sunlight, the entire waterfall was also golden.

“It’s so beautiful. Let’s go, take a few more photos of me later!”

Xiao Yu looked at the Golden Waterfall with a face full of pleasant surprise and ran towards it.

“You don’t even recognize it, why are you running? Xiao... I’ll bring you to a good place to watch, the Golden Platform!”

Feng Lingtian raised his head and acted like he was familiar with this place. Only by doing so could he regain some of his pride.

“Then why aren’t you leading the way for me? Are you asking for a beating?”

“You... Hello!”

Feng Lingtian immediately increased his speed and led the way towards the Golden Brilliance Stage!

“Oh?”

Suddenly, Feng Lingtian narrowed his eyes and looked at the group of people standing on the Golden Brilliance Stage.

On the golden platform, there were more than a dozen people standing there. All of them were from the Chaos Origin Immortal sect!

However, Feng Lingtian did not care. He raised his head and walked forward.

Although the two immortal sects were enemies, they did not have time to fight because of the appearance of the immortal sects.

In addition to the fact that the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect was relatively stronger, Feng Lingtian was even more fearless!
