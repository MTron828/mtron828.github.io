Chapter 1323: 1324 laughing sky was the crown prince. Who would object?

“Who’s that young man? How could he sit with the Hua clan leader?”

“No one else could sit with the Hua clan leader besides the second Prince’s brother!”

“I heard that the second Prince became the crown prince today has a lot to do with his brother!”

“What do you think? All the mounts of the second prince were obtained by that brother of his. Without him, the second prince would not have achieved his current achievements so easily!”

“No Wonder, no wonder a young man could sit with the Hua clan leader!”

“Don’t you know that? The Hua clan is nothing when it comes to the relationship and background of this brother of the second prince. Even the second prince is weaker. The daughter of the sect master of the Heavenly Sword sect has a close relationship with that young master!”

“Is he... that powerful?”

“You can just ask any faction in the tomb of the transvestite and you will know!”

Wang Xian sat beside the Hua clan leader and chatted with him casually. The city lords and powerful clans of the Guanglong dynasty looked over with curiosity on their faces.

The few Hua clan disciples behind them widened their eyes when they saw Wang Xian chatting with their clan leader.

They wiped the cold sweat off their foreheads. Fortunately, they didn’t act arrogantly in front of this young master earlier. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be enough even if they were given two more lives.

“At noon, the sacrificial ceremony will begin and the crown prince will be appointed. After that, the crown prince will make an oath. Currently, Xiaotian isn’t considered as the crown prince. Only after the oath is made can he be considered as the first successor to the throne!”

At the front, Long Xiaotian’s maternal grandfather was introducing the next steps to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian nodded slightly at the side.

“The king, the Royal Elder Council and a bunch of ministers are here!”

“Is it about to start? There are still ten minutes left before the ceremony!”

“Basically, everyone who came to watch the ceremony has arrived. Almost all the forces in the Liuhai region are here!”

“There must be at least tens of thousands of people around!”

At this moment, sounds of conversation could be heard from the surroundings. Wang Xian looked to the side.

A middle-aged man wearing a yellow robe, a crown on his head, and a scepter of light with a dragon head in his hand walked towards the main stage.

This was the king of the Light Dragon Dynasty.

Standing beside the king was a luxurious woman. The woman looked similar to Long Xiaotian.

This was long Xiaotian’s mother.

A mother depended on her son. After long Xiaotian became the crown prince, his mother would become the queen.

“Grandpa, brother Wang Xian!”

At this moment, Long Xiaotian, who was dressed in a yellow python robe, rushed over from behind. He opened his arms and hugged Wang Xian excitedly.

Wang Xian smiled and hugged him.

“Brother Wang Xian, where have you been for the past half a year? I can’t even contact you!”

Long Xiaotian asked with a smile.

“I went out to gain some experience. Coincidentally, it happened to be today. After you become the Crown Prince Today, I’m going back!”

“Are you going back? I wonder how long it will take for you to meet me when you get back!”

“Don’t worry. I’ll be back in a year or two at most!”

Wang Xian revealed a smile on his face and exchanged a few words with him.

“Alright, Alright. When you’re done with your matters today, you guys can have a good gathering tonight. Go and make some preparations!”

Long Xiaotian’s grandfather said with a smile on his face.

Everyone’s gaze was fixed on Wang Xian and the second prince.

The second prince, their future king.

As for the young man who had such a good relationship with the second prince, his future status was naturally very precious.

“Let the heavenly worship ceremony begin!”

At exactly 12 o’clock in the afternoon, a white-haired old man floated in the sky and shouted loudly.

Every time the crown prince was appointed, a heavenly worship ceremony would be held.

The process of heavenly worship was not complicated. The main purpose of heavenly worship was also to worship the ancestors.

Under the leadership of the King, the royal family of the Light Dragon Dynasty began to worship.

Tens of thousands of people in the surroundings watched the ceremony.

“The ceremony is over. The crown prince has been chosen!”

“The ninth generation disciple of the long family, the ninth generation Prince of the Light Dragon Dynasty, has led his forces to the stage after two years of assessment!”

“The Royal Elder Council will assess the development of the princes in the past two years. They will choose a prince and make him the crown prince. In the future, he will have the first right to inherit the throne!”

After the ceremony, the old man who was floating in the sky continued to speak.

“All princes, come on Stage!”

He shouted softly, and the princes who were preparing at the back led their subordinates to the center of the stage.

A total of fifteen princes participated in this assessment.

At that time, the strongest people were the first prince, the second prince, and the eighth Prince’s group of seven.

“Ta ta ta ta!”

The princes led their subordinates, but when long Xiaotian led his subordinates out, all eyes were on him.

He was wearing a yellow robe and stood on the body of a Dodo bird.

The Dodo bird at the first level of the profound void tier flapped its wings and emitted a bright energy.

Around him, there were four experts at the first level of the profound void tier and one at the second level of the profound void tier accompanying him. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Behind the group of experts at the profound void tier, the black armored cavalry, riding on Black Shadow Leopards and hell deer, emitted a powerful aura.

They held their heads high and followed behind with proud faces.

A stark contrast.

Compared to the second Prince Long Xiaotian’s faction, the other fourteen princes were no match for him even if they joined forces.

Especially after the battle seven months ago, the other princes no longer resisted and directly returned to the dynasty.

Their strength was much weaker than the second Prince’s.

“Hiss, there’s no comparison at all. The second prince will undoubtedly inherit the Crown Prince!”

“The entire Light Dragon Dynasty knows that the second Prince’s position as the crown prince is 100% . However, there’s still a need to go through the motions!”

“Eh? Why is there a prince missing? Where’s that Prince?”

“I heard that he went to a dangerous mystic realm in the Light Dragon Dynasty. I think it’s the eighth prince who was the first to be destroyed by the second Prince’s brother, Wang Xian!”

“Long Xiaotian is too powerful. Five insightful void realm experts and one insightful void mount. Good Boy!”

In the surrounding area, regardless of whether it was the family forces in the Light Dragon dynasty or the other forces in the flowing sea region who came to watch the ceremony, they were all amazed when they saw the second prince’s subordinates and power.

There was no doubt about the position of crown prince.

“Humph!”

“How unreconciled!”

The first prince, Long Xiaochen, the sixteenth prince, the twenty-second prince, and the others looked at long Xiaotian proudly standing on the dodo bird, and their expressions were extremely ugly.

Long Xiaotian’s gaze swept across the group of brothers, and a faint smile appeared on his face. He proudly jumped off the dodo bird and stood there with his head held high.

“After two years of investigation and tracking by our light dragon royal family’s stable regiment, and according to the strength and influence of the princes, we have unanimously decided!”

“To appoint the second Prince Xiaotian as the crown prince, are there any princes, ministers, and generals who object?”

The white-haired elder, Long Xiaotian’s second grandfather, stood up slowly on behalf of the Peace Corps. His gaze swept across everyone around him as he asked indifferently.

Is there anyone who can object?

Naturally!

“I object, I, Long Xiaoyun, object!”
