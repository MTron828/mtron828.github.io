Chapter 2925: 2,925 Dragon Palace’s shocking decision 5

“Only the Dragon Palace thinks so, they will invade the machine royal territory. Otherwise, where would their confidence come from?”

The domain Lord sighed slightly.

When he heard the Dragon King say that he would invade the machine royal territory, he was also extremely shocked.

Would the Dragon King be a fool?

Would the Dragon Palace’s God Emperors Be Fools?

Impossible!

Since they were not fools, it meant that the dragon palace was indeed stronger than them, and it was very likely that they were much stronger.

Otherwise, how would they dare to leave the expeditionary royal territory?

“This is really unexpected!”

The expressions of the divine emperors of the glazed domain changed as they were filled with shock.

From their point of view, the Dragon Palace’s strength that was similar to theirs was already very heaven-defying.

“With our strength, we don’t dare to rashly invade the machine royal territory. That will cause many disciples to die, and many celestial emperors will also die!”

The first supreme elder sighed slightly.

“Regardless of whether the dragon palace has the ability to destroy the machine royal territory, once they attack the machine royal territory, it will be a huge good thing for our glazed domain.”

“Order all the generals and disciples to prepare. After the war between the Dragon Palace and the machine royal territory erupts, we will immediately leave and destroy those beasts from the chimei territory.”

The governor ordered with a cold expression.

“Yes!”

The Celestial Emperors replied.

…

“Dragon King, the machine royal territory is not weak. The number of robots has reached more than 100 billion. All of them are above the strength of a Celestial Master.”

At the same time, in the Dragon Palace not far away, Wang Xian and Prime Minister Gui were looking at the information on the machine royal territory. Prime Minister Gui could not help but comment.

“It’s not weak. In the past, there were a lot of weak robots in the machine royal territory. However, the creator destroyed them directly to create more powerful robots. Now, they are mainly made up of elite warriors.”

Wang Xian looked at the information in front of him and sighed.

Not long ago, the information given to him by the governor was only the approximate strength of the machine royal territory.

This information was even more detailed.

Close to a billion years ago, the Machine Emperor Domain had countless robots in it, similar to the humans in other domains.

However, because the robots couldn’t cultivate on their own, they could only rely on resources to increase their strength and rely on resources to be born. Their creator had done something unimaginable.

The creator had destroyed all the weak robots and used the energy from the weak robots to create powerful robots.

There were only a few hundred billion robots in the entire mechanical imperial region.

Compared to the trillions of humans and creatures in other domains, they were like a drop in the ocean.

Although they were few in number, they were all elites.

The veluriyam domain was so powerful, but they did not use their strength to invade the mechanical imperial region. One could imagine their strength.

They were not much weaker than the glazed domain.

This was especially so for the creator, a monster that had lived for more than a billion years.

The best resources in the entire machine royal territory were all concentrated on him.

“This creator is not simple!”

Wang Xian mumbled.

“Dragon King, I’m afraid the entire devouring Dragon Clan doesn’t have enough power. In addition to the Heaven’s Eye Arrow Division’s berserk dragon seed and imperial dragon seed, it should be enough!”

Prime Minister Gui said.

“Alright, go and inform all the Divine Emperors of the Dragon Palace, the devouring dragon and the three dragon species of the Dragon Palace. It should be enough!”

Wang Xian nodded and ordered.

“Yes!”

Prime Minister Gui replied immediately.

Soon, the members of the Dragon Palace flew over one by one.

Led by 51 divine emperors, the heaven’s Eye Arrow Division, the mad dragon species and the imperial dragon species followed behind.

The nine divine dragons swayed their bodies and emitted powerful dragon might.

Ao he and the other two first level divine emperors, the devouring dragons, were extremely excited. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Dragon King, all the members have arrived!”

Prime Minister Gui said with a smile.

“Ao he, how are the preparations going over there?”

Wang Xian asked Ao he and the rest.

“Dragon King, all the devouring dragons are ready.”

Ao he said with fighting spirit.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and swept his gaze across the celestial emperors of the Dragon Palace.

“Heaven Formation, the two of us are mainly responsible for killing battleships that can threaten celestial emperors. If we encounter a creator, we will kill him first!”

“Nine Wind Divine Dragons, you are responsible for sealing off the surroundings to prevent them from escaping!”

“During the battle, Prime Minister Gui will give the command. Ao Tu, protect Prime Minister Gui!”

Wang Xian immediately gave out orders.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The group of Dragon Palace disciples immediately responded loudly.

“Dragon King, I’ll summon my subordinates First!”

At this moment, ao Xie said. His body moved and immediately transformed into a terrifying devouring dragon.

Within his 20,000 meter body, devouring dragons flew out from his body.

Very quickly, over a million swallowing dragons flew out.

Amongst them, the weakest had the strength of an undying level 4.

As for the 3 beside him, as the core strength of the Dragon Palace, the weakest amongst them was an undying level 5.

There were about a million swallowing dragons, 200,000 berserk dragons, 150,000 arrow dragons and 150,000 Imperial Dragons.

There were a total of 1.5 million experts from the Dragon Palace.

This was almost four-fifths of the strength of the Dragon Palace!

“All members of the Dragon Palace, remember the star map of the mechanic Royal Territory. Also, you have to understand some of the characteristics of the various warships and armies in the mechanic Royal Territory.”

Wang Xian waved his arm and displayed all the information collected from the glazed domain to the members of the Dragon Palace.

The rapid development of the members of the Dragon Palace and the rapid increase in their strength did not mean that their intelligence was weak.

On the contrary, Prime Minister Gui of the Dragon Palace had trained 5,000 civil servants to teach all the members of the Dragon Palace all kinds of knowledge in order to prevent such problems from occurring.

Furthermore, Prime Minister Gui would also conduct an assessment for all the members of the Dragon Palace on a regular basis.

This assessment was related to the distribution of resources among all the members of the Dragon Palace in the future.

This allowed every member of the Dragon Palace not only to possess formidable strength, but also a considerable amount of intelligence.

It was not an exaggeration to say that in terms of quality, the Dragon Palace far surpassed the experts from other factions.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The members of the Dragon Palace immediately replied.

“Domain Lord, Get Ready!”

While all the members of the Dragon Palace were looking at the information, Wang Xian sent a message to the domain lord.

At this moment, in the void in front of the war continent, the governor and the glazed celestial thearchs were floating in the void.

After receiving the message from the Dragon King, he looked at the planet where the Dragon Palace was located.

“Get all the soldiers and disciples to prepare for evacuation!”

The governor ordered the celestial thearchs.

“It’s the Governor!”

The celestial thearchs nodded immediately and flew around.

At the same time, they looked at the planet where the Dragon Palace was from time to time.

They were also curious about what kind of force the Dragon Palace would send to conquer the machine royal territory!
