Chapter 2954: King 4 of the 2954 starry sky

“Buzz, Buzz, Buzz!”

In the starry sky of the glazed domain, a demon cave suspended in the void trembled slightly and slowly moved forward.

An lie stood on top of an altar in the deepest part of the demon cave, his face red.

“Brother, the demon cave moved, but its flying speed is not as fast as that of a godly monarch expert!”

!!

Ao he looked at an lie speechlessly.

“Ahem, it’s mainly because I’m too weak. Besides, such a huge devil den requires a huge amount of energy to be activated.”

“A devil den can fly at a fast speed. Usually, all the evil monsters are located in the nest inside the Devil Den. They will provide some power!”

An lie said.

“Tell me this method. I’ll get my subordinates to activate the Devil Den!”

Ao crab’s body moved and immediately transformed into a devouring dragon. Over a million subordinates flew out from his body.

“TSK tsk, ao crab, you guys look more like Yaoxie than Yaoxie!”

An lie looked at the devouring dragon and said with a smile.

“Actually, creatures like Yaoxie are not very powerful at the same level. Special existences like them mainly rely on this altar. Yaoxie calls it the devil spirit altar. This altar can allow them to teleport through black holes, just like a teleportation array.”

“However, Yao Xie can not make the decision to activate this teleportation array. Instead, it requires the connection of creatures from another place. To put it bluntly, this is a high-level teleportation array. With the connection of creatures, Yao Xie can be teleported over.”

“I don’t know why, but some humans in some places have mastered this method. But Yao Xie is not sent over as a fighter. They want to plunder a world.”

“If you don’t have the strength to suppress the evil, you will be easily devoured. If you stay in the demon cave for a long time, you will be easily assimilated into the evil. The weaker you are, the easier it is for you to be called evil.”

“No, I don’t think so. I don’t think so.”

Suddenly, in the head held high when talking, dark strong suddenly jumped up, opened his upper body clothes.

Strange bloody marks appeared on his chest.

“Ah, Dragon King, save me! I’m about to be assimilated by the demon cave. I’m about to turn into a demon!”

An lie shouted loudly.

Wang Xian was slightly stunned when he saw this scene. He looked at an lie in astonishment.

“It can’t be that serious, right? He was infected so quickly?”

He said in astonishment.

“Dragon King, this is the third level Demon Cave of the void God Emperor. I’m weak, so I’m naturally infected!”

An lie shouted.

“Then why aren’t there any changes in my subordinates?”

Ao he looked at his subordinates below the god Emperor level and did not find anything strange.

“Big Brother AO he, your subordinates are all dragon species. Their bloodline is high, and I have not turned into a dragon species, so I will be infected!”

An lie shouted.

“It’s fine. You have already entered the Dragon Palace, so you should not lose your mind. If you are really infected, then turn into a dragon species.”

Tian Chen looked at an lie from the side, his eyes full of curiosity.

“This strange ability is somewhat similar to a shaman’s!”

He murmured.

An lie wanted to vomit blood, and he looked at his chest with a dark face.

He looked at the Dragon King and found that the Dragon King was also looking at him with curiosity, full of helplessness.

“Dragon King, I don’t want to turn into a demon!”

An lie said with a bitter face.

“It’s alright. Let’s see what will happen in the end. If you benefit from this misfortune, you might evolve into an even more powerful dragon.”

Wang Xian comforted him.

This made an lie fall into complete despair. He had become a lab rat.

“AO he, get your men to control the demon lair while devouring these lairs. Let’s head to the Chimei Territory!”

Wang Xian instructed ao he.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao he nodded and gestured to an lie.

An lie told them the method to control the demon lair. He stared at his body and his face was filled with sorrow.

“Don’t worry, you won’t die. Even if you die, I can save you!”

Tian Chen walked over and patted his shoulder to comfort him.

“It’s okay, brother Tian Chen. It’s my duty to sacrifice myself for the Dragon Palace!”

An lie raised his head and said righteously.

“Yes, yes. Come, come. Let me study your body. How and why are you infected?”

Tian Chen smiled and took him to the side.

“Brother Tian Chen, what are you going to do?”

A terrified voice sounded.

“Buzz Buzz Buzz!”

At this moment, the gigantic demon cave was activated. The gigantic demon cave flew forward rapidly.

Wang Xian smiled and glanced at the sky array before flying to the exit of the demon cave.

“This speed is so fast. It’s not slower than the speed of a level three void God realm expert. In fact, it’s even faster!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Wang Xian looked at it in astonishment.

This was because the demon cave was too huge. Even if it moved a little, it would still be a very long distance.

This made the demon cave’s speed extremely fast.

In the void, two huge demon caves were flying rapidly in the direction of the Chimei region.

The demon cave flew rapidly for two days and passed through more than half of the glazed domain. It was getting closer and closer to the Chimei region.

“There should only be these four demon caves that invaded the glazed domain!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. He took out his communication stone plate and sent a message to the governor and the rest.

Buzz

At the same time, in the vast void between the glazed area and the holy region, the governor’s eyes lit up with excitement when he saw Wang Xian’s message.

“The Dragon King sent a message. The two demon lairs in the glazed area have been destroyed by the Dragon Palace!”

He could not help but growl in excitement.

“Governor, the Dragon King and the others have destroyed the two demon caves as well?”

“Hiss, they are so fast. How long has it been? The Dragon King and the others have already destroyed the other two demon caves!”

“Great, Great, Great. Governor, can we return to the glazed domain now?”

Excited voices came from the surrounding divine emperors.

They stood up, their faces filled with shock and excitement.

The experts from the Dragon Palace did not leave because they were worried that the other two demon caves might be behind them and might chase after them.

However, the Dragon King had already destroyed the other two demon caves even though the experts from the Dragon Palace had not left. What did this mean?

This meant that the dragon palace might have more than ten third level divine emperors.

More than a dozen third level divine emperors?

This power was too terrifying!

It could easily sweep across the entire bright starry sky.

“The Dragon King said that the two demon dens and the two leaders were all destroyed. As for whether the glazed domain still has more demon dens that have invaded, he doesn’t know. Now, the Dragon King is leading experts into the chimei domain!”

The domain Lord said with some shock in his heart.

They were already very shocked that the experts of the Dragon Palace had easily destroyed the two demon dens here.

The Dragon King had also easily destroyed the two demon caves. Now that he had entered the chimei domain, he was even more shocked.

The strength of the Dragon Palace might be even stronger than they had imagined.
