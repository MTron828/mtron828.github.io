3549 3548 was shocked! Ancestral Dragon ruler level three great being was dead!

“Hahaha, Niya, even if you risk your life, you will die today. Today, I will use your head to blow the Horn of your ancestral dragon bloodline’s destruction, to blow the Horn of our Holy Dragon Bloodline’s unification of the Godly Dragon Race!”

Seeing Niya attacking him, holy dragon son laughed crazily!

He was not afraid of any great being at the same level as two connate true treasures!

One had to know that even a true universe master might not have a connate true treasure!

The reason why their Holy Dragon bloodline could have so many connate true treasures was because the angel race had lent them to them.

Otherwise, how could they have so many connate true treasures?

“Sacred Peak, suppress!”

Seeing the incoming chi ya, the sacred dragon son waved his claw, and the Bright Mountain Peak immediately emitted a light!

The light instantly shone on the sky above Chi Ya, and a mountain peak slowly formed in the sky above him!

“Heavenly Water Supreme Dragon, explode!”

Seeing the sacred dragon son directly using the innate supreme treasure, Chi Ya’s expression was abnormally ugly, and he instantly used his law projection to counterattack!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Holy Dragon Angel, Slash!”

The son of Saint Dragon saw him using his law projection and immediately used it as well.

“Dragon Pearl!”

Que Ya roared and spat out a water dragon pearl which flew towards the Holy Dragon Angel.

“Boom Boom!”

A terrifying collision sound was heard, but the shadow of the mountain of light was still formed above que ya!

“Suppress!”

When the son of the sacred dragon saw this, his face revealed a ghastly expression!

As the most outstanding son of the Sacred Dragon King, the resources of the sacred dragon lineage, other than the Sacred Dragon King, was him!

His strength, even without relying on the innate supreme treasure, could be ranked third in the sacred dragon lineage!

The second was an old minister who followed his father!

But with the innate supreme treasure, he was the strongest person other than his father!

With Que Ya’s strength, even if he didn’t rely on the innate supreme treasure, the sacred dragon son was confident in suppressing him!

Not to mention that he also had the support of these two innate supreme treasures!

A bright mountain peak immediately appeared in the sky above que ya. This bright mountain peak seemed to be able to follow him like a shadow, slowly pressing down on his body!

Chi Ya’s expression changed drastically, and fear appeared in his eyes.

“Haha, You Want to resist? You Don’t have the qualifications, I’ll kill you in three moves!”

The Sacred Dragon Son looked over, and a cold expression flickered in his eyes.

He slowly raised his Dragon Claw, and the two dragon eyes in the sky shone.

A Ray of light landed on Chi Ya’s body, causing his body to tremble slightly!

“No, disciples of the Water Cloud Clan, run!”

Chiya’s face was filled with despair when he saw sacred dragon son use his second connate true treasure. He shouted sternly!

“Not good, not good! We, Sir Chiya, are no match for Sacred Dragon Son at all!”

“He has two connate true treasures!”

“Run? How can we run? The other party has ten universe masters and level three battle Li Great beings guarding the surroundings. All disciples have entered the grotto-heaven Blessed Land!”

Below, the disciples of the Raincloud clan were trembling as they watched the battle in the sky. Despair was written all over their faces!

Their lord que ya was no match for this Holy Dragon Son!

The two dragon eyes were locked, and the Holy Peak was suppressed. When they landed on que ya’s body, his body began to crumble!

“What happened over there?”

“What’s going on over there? What’s going on over at Crouching Dragon Lake? What a terrifying power!”

The battle and the terrifying power that erupted around Crouching Dragon Lake attracted the attention of some living beings.

They looked over, their faces filled with shock.

The power over there was definitely not something that an ordinary universe ruler could unleash!

Peng

Roar! Roar! Roar

At that moment, a mournful roar was heard. It represented the death of a universe master level three great being from the ancestral dragon bloodline, Que Ya!

Another universe master level three great being had died!

“Hahaha! A pinnacle dragon seed! I can easily kill it!”

Holy Dragon Son looked at que ya’s corpse and laughed maniacally. He looked down at the water cloud clan!

“Kill! Exterminate the Raincloud clan!”

He roared and gave the order to exterminate the clan!

“It’s the son of the Sacred Dragon!”

The experts of the Sacred Dragon Clan replied loudly as they opened their mouths!

Hong

A bright torrent of light rushed down.

The lake water evaporated rapidly, and everything below melted!

The Raincloud clan’s building appeared, but in the next second, it disappeared!

The grotto-heaven blessed land, which could resist a level 3 universe ruler, slowly collapsed!

In the grotto-heaven blessed land, all the disciples and warriors of the Raincloud clan had despair on their faces.

If they couldn’t resist, they couldn’t resist at all!

Hong

A muffled sound rang out, and a powerful high-level race was easily wiped out!

More than 20 Great Beings of the Holy Dragon bloodline flew down and collected the treasures of the defective tooth god country and the water cloud race!

The Holy Dragon Son looked at the defective tooth corpse with a smile on his face. He took out the universe AI and took pictures of it before uploading them to the universe ai!

The Holy Dragon Son: one year is up. I, the Holy Dragon Son, will lead the Great Beings of the Holy Dragon bloodline to unify the Holy Dragon Clan. Those who submit will prosper and those who rebel will perish. The Ancestral Dragon Bloodline, the universe ruler Level 3 great being, defective tooth, will be easily beheaded by me!

Very soon, a message was sent out from the universe ai!

It was a message from Holy Dragon Son!

When this message was sent out along with Que Ya’s corpse, it caused a huge sensation!

The Holy Dragon Bloodline had announced a year ago that they were going to unify the Godly Dragon Clan!

Now that the one-year deadline had just arrived, Holy Dragon Son had killed a universe master level three great being from the ancestral dragon bloodline!

This… This was simply too terrifying!

“Is this for real? Is this impossible? The one-year period has just passed, and Sacred Dragon Son has already killed a pinnacle great being from the ancestral dragon lineage!”

“Hiss, the path of unification of the sacred dragon lineage is about to begin, right? Sacred Dragon Emperor did not make a move, and just sacred dragon son and his men were able to kill a universe master level three great being?”

“Too powerful! The unification of the Holy Dragon bloodline is about to begin. How are the Great Beings of the Dragon Palace of the ancestral dragon bloodline going to deal with it?”

“They killed a pinnacle great being of the ancestral dragon bloodline right from the start. The Holy Dragon bloodline is determined to get it!”

On the universe AI, all the disciples of the Great Beings were shocked when they saw the information released by Holy Dragon Son!

A Level 3 universe master, a great being of such a level, he was definitely a top-tier great being in the universe!

Under the circumstance that the pinnacle races didn’t appear, they were invincible. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

They were also the Guardians of the high-tier races!

However, a year had just passed, and the Holy Dragon son of the Holy Dragon lineage had already killed one?

How terrifying!

One could foresee that the holy dragon lineage was determined to win this battle of unification!

After all, this was a battle that the Holy Dragon King hadn’t even made a move to achieve!
