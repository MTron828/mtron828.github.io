Chapter 1282: 1283 night assassination

Translator: 5496903

“Big Brother, the spy we placed with second brother has been discovered!”

On the same island of the Light Dragon Dynasty, in a courtyard close to the sea, four princes were sitting at a round table. One of them looked at long Xiaochen and said with a gloomy face.

“We have received the news. So be it if he has been discovered. I really didn’t expect that young man named Wang Xian to have such a powerful ability, the art of Beast Taming!”

Long Xiaochen’s eyes flickered and he looked extremely embarrassed. He looked at the other three and said, “In the future, if we have the help of that kid, how can we fight against the second brother?”

“Then... Big Brother, what are you saying?”

The eyes of the other three princes flickered and there was a faint killing intent on their faces.

“You and I both know very well that we must not let that Kid Live!”

Long Xiaochen said coldly.

“That Kid has two level-1 void interpretation beasts by his side. It’ll be difficult for us to kill him with our strength unless...”

A prince knocked on the table and said, “Find an assassin!”

“It’s not cheap to assassinate a Beast Tamer who has two level-1 void interpretation beasts. If we hire a magic-level, the four of us will split the commission equally. There’s no problem, right?”

Long Xiaochen nodded and said in a deep voice.

“Of course there shouldn’t be a problem. Not only do we have to get rid of him, we also have to ensure that nothing goes wrong. If we don’t get rid of that kid, we won’t be qualified to compete with our second brother in the future!”

The other three princes didn’t hesitate and nodded immediately.

“Alright. In case anything goes wrong, we will act immediately!”

The four princes stood up slowly, their eyes flashing with a cold glint.

The Young Beast Tamer who helped long Xiaotian must not be allowed to stay.

Time passed slowly. Wang Xian sat in the courtyard and looked through the information regarding the blood refinement ground.

The blood refinement ground was not really considered as the territory of the ancient blood stream sect.

The blood refinement ground was located in a place further away. It was a paradise for ferocious beasts.

There were all kinds of ferocious beasts. The highest level among them was even at level six of the Seethrough realm. The blood refinement ground was extremely vast. People from the cemetery of demi-humans preferred to call it the wilderness territory.

It was where all the disciples of the ancient blood stream sect and even the powerhouses were trained.

In the wildlands, the blood stream sect had built a safe passage. At the entrance of the passage stood a huge stone tablet with the words ‘land of blood refinement’written on it.

Therefore, the wildlands was called the land of blood refinement.

“Get ready to make your move. The two of you restrain the two ferocious beasts in his courtyard. Leave the target to me!”

“Hehe, alright, no problem. To assassinate a mere beast tamer, he actually sent out an epic-level assassin of the Devil Realm. What a waste!”

“Hehe, since our employer is rich, we will naturally be happy. Don’t be careless. Since that kid is able to tame two ferocious beasts of the first level of the Seethrough realm, his strength is definitely not simple!”

“Let’s go in!”

It was already night time. In front of Wang Xian’s courtyard, three black figures were conversing in the dark. They looked forward and exchanged a glance before disappearing.

Buzz

At this moment, Wang Xian did not rest. He sat in the courtyard and read the information under the moonlight. Suddenly, he was slightly stunned. Sensing the energy from the surroundings, he slowly lifted the Teacup in his hand.

“Wang, there are three powerhouses at the first level of the Seethrough Realm!”

At this moment, the voice of the Demon Soul entered his mind.

Wang Xian nodded silently and looked at the spirit purple qilin and the blood evil turtle in front of him.

The two beasts at the first level of the Seethrough realm did not sense that someone had entered the courtyard.

Assassin!

A word appeared in Wang Xian’s mind. He was very clear about assassins.

To be able to hide from the senses of the two ferocious beasts, only assassins who were good at hiding could do it.

“The few princes from the Light Dragon Dynasty sent them over? No, it should be the assassins they hired!”

Wang Xian drank a mouthful of tea indifferently and sensed the strength of the three figures.

With the strength of these three figures, they wouldn’t be here to deal with the identity of the Nameless Sword Demon. They could only be here to deal with him.

Other than the few princes of the Light Dragon Dynasty, there wouldn’t be anyone else.

In addition to long Xiaotian’s reminder to him this afternoon, he was already 100% certain.

Sensing that the three assassins were getting closer and closer to him, Wang Xian revealed a faint smile.

“Everyone, are you courting death?”

He slowly placed the blanket in his hand on the table and raised his head to sweep at the three assassins.

“What?”

The three assassins who were hiding in the surroundings were slightly stunned when they saw Wang Xian’s gaze sweeping over them. Their faces revealed a look of shock.

However, at this moment, Wang Xian did not give them any chance.

His figure moved and attacked the three assassins at a terrifying speed.

“Not good!”

“This is bad. The strength of the target does not match the information!”

When the three assassins saw Wang Xian making his move, they were shocked.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

“Three assassins at the first level of the Seethrough realm are trying to assassinate me?”

Wang Xian’s voice was heard. However, it was accompanied by a terrifying attack.

The three assassins at the first level of the Seethrough realm were very strong. However, they were not strong enough in front of Wang Xian. It was normal for him to kill them in an instant with his strength.

“Cough cough, how... how is this possible?”

The three figures appeared. They widened their eyes and stared at Wang Xian in disbelief.

The target of their assassination was a young man. How strong could a young man be?

Not every young man was as strong and terrifying as the nameless sword demon!

They could feel the sound in their bodies disappearing rapidly. They could not believe it as they stared at the young man in front of them with widened eyes.

Wang Xian waved his arm and kept the three corpses into his interspatial ring. He continued to lie on the chair and picked up the Teacup.

It was a breeze!

“Maybe they still don’t know who they are trying to assassinate!”

Wang Xian shook his head slowly and revealed a faint smile.

This assassin organization was not weak. They sent out three assassins of the first level of the Seethrough realm at once.

It was a pity that he was Wang Xian. At the same time, he was the nameless sword demon in their minds.

After helping long Xiaotian tame the ferocious beasts this time, I will help him get rid of all the subordinates of his brothers. It will save me a lot of trouble in the future

I need the resources to level up next. If I don’t have enough, I can ask Long Xiaotian to help me think of a solution

Wang Xian thought to himself.

He and Long Xiaotian had been helping each other all this while. It would be very beneficial to him if he helped long Xiaotian to obtain the throne.

He sat until dawn. With his strength, he didn’t feel the slightest bit tired.

“Demon Soul, you stay here. Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian looked at the time and leaped onto Ling Zilin’s body. The blood evil turtle followed behind him and walked out. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

When he arrived at the place he had agreed to with long Xiaotian, he had already led more than 300 subordinates to wait there.

Among them, more than 50 of them were riding on Black Shadow Leopards while another 50 to 60 of them were riding on dark deer.

Awe-inspiring!
