“Keke, after dealing with one elder, the rest will be much easier.”

In the study room, Ba Qi sat in the center.

Beside him, an elder and a deacon of the world margin sect stood there respectfully.

“Boss, please give us your instructions on what to do next.”

The two of them stood in front of Ba Qi respectfully.

“The world margin sect still has six elders and one leader, think of a way to parasitize a few more elders, it’s best to parasitize the leader.”

Ba Qi squinted his eyes.

“Boss, according to my memories, the leader has a life saving treasure. If you want to parasitize the world margin sect leader, it’s best to parasitize him at the Pinnacle Undying Emperor realm, it’s safer that way.”

“If it’s an elder, there’s a huge chance.”

The elder said.

“Alright!”

“Then parasitize the three elders and proceed to the next step.”

Ba Qi said coldly.

If he parasitized another three elders, the entire world margin sect would not be far from destruction.

“It’s boss!”

After parasitizing an elder, it was much easier to parasitize them.

With the formation specially set up by the Heaven Array to block out any abnormal movements, it was not difficult for him to parasitize the elders.

In fact, it was much easier than before.

Soon, in less than two days, there were three more elders from the world margin sect in front of Ba Qi.

“Keke, let’s carry out the plan.”

Ba Qi smiled sinisterly.

“Sect master, some disciples who went to investigate have sent news that someone saw people from the world margin sect flying to the right.”

Half a day later, an elder came to sect master Tian Ya’s palace and reported to him.

“To the right? Why did they go to the right?”

Sect Master Tian Ya frowned and said with an unpleasant expression.

“I don’t know, but the last time we met the Dragon King was on the right. Sect master, I want to go with a few elders and lead the world margin experts to investigate.”

The elder said.

Hierarch Tianya looked hesitant.

“I can take more disciples this time and not go into the Abyss and split up the team. If we really encounter any trouble, or even the strange array formation of the Dragon Palace, we’ll be able to react immediately.”

“I think it’s best to check out the disappearance of five or six thousand disciples and see if the Dragon Palace has done something in secret.”

Elder Tianya continued.

“It’s fine if we ensure safety. We must pay attention to the strange array formation of the Dragon Palace. Once we’re trapped, we’ll be in Big Trouble.”

“Why don’t we inform the Patriarch?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Sect Master Tianya nodded and said.

“Sect master, there’s no need to inform the patriarch about this. We’re not going to confront the powerhouses of the Dragon Palace and look for them. Once there’s any danger, we’ll return to the divine kingdom directly.”

“It’s enough for me to call a few elders to come with me.”

Elder Tianya shook his head.

“Okay, old an, I trust you to do things. Be careful.”

Sect Master Tianya thought for a moment and nodded in agreement.

“Don’t worry, sect master. I’ll call three elders. Nothing will happen.”

Elder Tianya said with a smile.

“Okay!”

Sect Master Tianya nodded and watched him leave.

“If it’s really done by the Dragon Palace, then let’s fight to the death.”

Sect Master Tianya murmured.

They had already become stray dogs. If they still had to be assassinated by the Dragon Palace at this time, then their Tianya sect could go crazy.

“Boss, the plan has succeeded.”

When the world margin elder walked out, he immediately took out his AI and sent a message.

Then, he immediately went to look for the other elders.

“Very good!”

At the same time, Ba Qi received the message and left immediately.

“Dragon King.”

A few hours later, Ba Qi flew over.

...

“Is it done?”

Wang Xian looked at him and asked with a smile.

“It’s done. We have parasitized four elders. If we kill the other three tomorrow, the elders will all be ours.”

“Dragon King, if we make a move tomorrow, we might need the heaven array to come over personally to set up the array.”

Ba Qi nodded with a smile.

“Alright.”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile.

“This time, there will be more than 10,000 immortal king powerhouses. One of the subordinates of elder Tian Ya can not return. We will be able to obtain four level 9 immortal king corpses. I want to accumulate 10 of them and raise my combat strength to the peak of Immortal King.”

“At that time, I can parasitize on sect master Tianya. If that’s the case, hehehe...”

Ba Qi said to Wang Xian with a sinister laugh.

“Sure.”

...

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered.

Once he parasitized sect master Tianya, the other three elders would also be on his side. The entire Tianya sect would be in his pocket.

If the Tianya sect knew that the elders and sect master were from the Dragon Palace, he did not know if they would die of fear.

“Dragon King!”

Ten hours later, the sky array rushed over.

“Discuss with Ba Qi about tomorrow’s operation. It’s best not to let anyone from the world margin sect off.”

Wang Xian said to the sky array.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The sky array nodded and immediately started to plan with Ba Qi.

..

“All the disciples are separated by 100 million kilometers. If we need to enter the Abyss to investigate, everyone else should wait outside.”

“We must be on high alert. There might be powerful warriors targeting us in the dark.”

Time passed quickly. The next morning, the four sect leaders of the world margin sect stood at the very front and said to all the disciples.

“It’s the Elder!”

Over 10,000 undying emperor level warriors immediately replied.

They also knew about the operation this time. They wanted to find out if the warriors of the world margin sect were killed in the Abyss or assassinated.

If they were assassinated, they would be able to confirm that it was done by the Dragon Palace.

If that was the case, the world margin sect would walk a different path.

“Brothers, be careful!”

The elder who spoke looked at the other three and warned.

“Don’t worry, if they can kill us, we won’t have to live anymore.”

The other three elders said confidently.

They were undying level 9 warriors, under such vigilance, and outside the abyss, if they were killed, they couldn’t blame anyone else.

They could only say that the other party was too strong, and they were too weak.

As for this operation, they didn’t think it was dangerous at all.

“Alright, since that’s the case, I’ll take the lead, you guys split up to the left, right and back.”

That Tian Ya elder smiled and said.

“Alright!”

The group nodded.

“The clues you guys found, I’ll let you guys lead the way.”

The leader Elder said to the undying disciples beside him.

“It’s the Elder!”

The disciples immediately led the way.

The leader Elder’s lips curled up, the disciples beside him also smiled.

These few people, of course, were poisonous horned dragons.
