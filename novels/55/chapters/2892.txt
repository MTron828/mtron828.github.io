Chapter 2893: ’s Starry Sky Shook

“In just two minutes, the Cheng Wizard Association’s defense was broken through by the Dragon Palace. The Dragon King attacked and killed the Wizards. The monarch was scared out of his wits and ran away!”

“In less than half an hour, all the monarch-level powerhouses of the Cheng Wizard Association were killed. The rest of the disciples had to submit to the Dragon Palace to survive. The Dragon Palace is invincible!”

“Those nine huge creatures are the wind divine dragons. They are the divine dragons. The real divine dragons are very terrifying!”

“The Witch Formation Society has been defeated. In the future, the Dragon Palace will take over the sky shaman region. All the experts from the forces hiding in the surroundings will show themselves and submit to the Dragon King!”

“The strength of the Dragon Palace is simply heaven-defying. It’s too terrifying. The Witch Formation Society can’t resist it at all!”

“It’s too powerful. The divine dragon roars and the Dragon King is invincible!”

“Today, our ancient Shaman Sect announces that we will submit to the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King. In the future, the Dragon Palace will be the main force and the Dragon King will be the most respected!”

The entire sky shaman region was paying close attention to the fact that the Dragon Palace had invaded the Sky Shaman Region and was preparing to attack the Witch Formation Association!

However, what made everyone in the sky shaman region feel incredulous was that when the Dragon Palace arrived at the Witch Mountain, within half an hour, information was transmitted one after another.

This was especially so when the ancient Magus sect directly made a statement on the communication network, causing the entire Heaven Magus region to be dumbfounded.

Looking at the information regarding the Wu Mountain, everyone opened their mouths slightly, their expressions filled with incredulity.

The Magus was dead, killed by the Dragon King!

All the experts above the god King level of the formation Magus Union were also dead, not a single one was left alive!

Only the disciples below the godly monarch level were spared by the Dragon Palace.

Otherwise, the entire success Wizard Association would have been wiped out by the Dragon Palace.

Only the imperial court’s Monarch had escaped while the other godly monarchs had all perished.

Within a day, all six godly monarchs of the success wizard association had been wiped out. Not a single one had escaped.

One of the godly monarchs of the imperial court had also been easily killed.

When everyone in the Heaven Magus region saw this news, their eyes widened in disbelief.

“In the past, the success Wizard Association was very strong, but many of the large sects of the Heaven Magus region still did not submit. However, now they actually announced that they were submitting to the Dragon Palace. This… just how strong is the Dragon Palace!”

“It’s almost 100% certain that the Dragon Palace has a divine dragon, a true divine dragon!”

Countless people were discussing in the communication network of the Heavenly Wizard territory.

However, three hours later, everyone in the communication network received a message.

Anyone who had a communication stone plate would receive this message!

“From today on, the Dragon Palace will take over the heavenly wizard territory. In the future, the Dragon Palace will rule the entire heavenly wizard territory. The Dragon Palace will establish a new order based on the imperial star area. Those who refuse will be killed!

“In addition, soon, the Celestial Wizard territory and the imperial star field will be connected through communication.”

A message announced that the Dragon Palace would completely control the entire celestial wizard territory.

When all the people of the Celestial Wizard territory saw this message, their bodies trembled slightly.

“The Dragon Palace wants to open up the two territories and take control of our Celestial Wizard Territory!”

“Hiss, the Dragon King wants to re-establish the order of our Celestial Wizard Territory? Will he have to provoke many people and forces?”

“Provoke many people and forces? Whoever refuses to submit will die immediately. Even the formation wizard association was destroyed within half an hour. The other forces are all small fries in the Dragon Palace’s eyes. Can’t you see that the other forces have already declared their submission?”

This piece of information could be said to have caused a stir in the entire celestial wizard territory.

However, very quickly, all the citizens of the Celestial Wizard territory discovered that the forces that could be called out by the Celestial Wizard Territory had once again issued a statement on the communication network.

They had to obey the orders of the Dragon King and the orders of the Dragon Palace unconditionally!

This…

Seeing that all the factions were cooperating so respectfully at the first instance, everyone knew that the heaven of the Heaven Magus region had changed.

From the side, they could also feel the terror of the Dragon Palace.

“Dragon King, all the treasures have been collected. The Divine Kingdoms of the few divine emperors have also been found.”

At the same time, on the highest peak of Mount Wu.

Heaven’s array came to Wang Xian with a smile and reported.

“Very good. Move an ocean to Mount Wu. We will build a dragon palace here.”

Wang Xian said to Heaven’s array.

“Yes, I know there is an ocean nearby.”

Heaven’s array nodded immediately.

“Dragon Palace, this time, we have obtained resources and treasures. We can increase the number of divine emperors in the Dragon Palace by at least 25. We can double the number. In addition, we can increase the number of second-level divine emperors.”

Prime Minister Gui, who was seated at the side, said excitedly.

“Bring those few void God realms over and let the Dragon Palace absorb them.”

“Also, after we establish the Dragon Palace here, we will have to completely reform the Heaven Magus region. We will send the experts of the Dragon Palace to kill all those vicious people.”

“Leave the management to the Green Moon Phoenix Luan and the others!”

Wang Xian instructed Prime Minister Gui.

“Yes, Dragon King. I will help the Dragon Queens to take control of the entire celestial wizard territory as soon as possible!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded.

“By then, we can get the nine wind divine dragons to work together. The speed will also be faster.”

Wang Xian smiled and said.

“Yes, Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui replied.

The Celestial Wizard territory was different from the Emperor Star Field. This star field was chaotic and could not be compared to the Emperor Star Field, let alone the holy region.

Although it wasn’t like the Heaven Punishment Ancient Heaven Domain, it was still full of killing.

There were many things like human experiments, killing people to refine treasures, and so on.

Since the Dragon Palace wanted to take over this star domain, they had to clean it up.

As for whether anyone resisted, they had to kill them directly.

With the Dragon Palace’s strength, it would be too easy to clean them up.

With the sky array and the wind god Dragon, they couldn’t escape even if they wanted to.

“After controlling two domains, the speed of improvement of the Dragon Palace will be even more terrifying in the future.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Wang Xian mumbled as a smile appeared on his face.

After this, after killing more than a million god Emperors of the Wizard Association, the strength of the ordinary members of the Dragon Palace would be greatly enhanced.

At the very least, the weakest members of the Dragon Palace would be able to reach the level of immortal king level four or five.

“I wonder how the barren lands would react if they knew about the situation here?”

The corners of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly as he looked down at the mountains and rivers.

Following that, a huge ocean was quickly transported over by the nine divine dragons of the Dragon Palace as well as the Heaven Formation.

The huge ocean transported hundreds of millions of miles, causing a huge commotion in the entire Heaven Wizard region.

Such a mighty force was so terrifying!

Buzz

The Ocean was transported to a spot on Mount Wu and landed in the center of Mount Wu.

Wang Xian immediately established a dragon palace and connected to the main Dragon Palace of the Imperial Star region.

“Xiao Xian? The Celestial Wizard Territory has been conquered?”

A group of girls received the message and immediately teleported over. They asked Wang Xian.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded and smiled.

“Next, you guys can develop the dragon and Phoenix Divine dynasty to the Heaven Magus region and take charge of this place. However, this place might take some time and is more troublesome than the Imperial Star Region!”

“We have obtained quite a number of treasures this time. Qing Yue and Feng Luan, both of you should raise your strength to the celestial thearch level first.”
