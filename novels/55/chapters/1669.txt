Chapter 1670: 1670 escaped?

Their scalps went numb!

When the city guards passed the news to the elders and elders, even the experts at the ninth level of the profound void tier felt their scalps go numb.

Over 10 million people in Fengtian city had gathered in the center due to the assassination yesterday.

However, it was impossible for all 10 million people to gather in the center. There were still many brave ones who stayed in their own residences.

However, in just one night, these people had all disappeared!

These were millions of people. Moreover, most of them were martial artists above the transcendent seventh rank. If they were placed in a city, they could be considered as experts.

In a small family, they were considered elites.

It was these millions of elite experts who had all disappeared in one night.

“These are several million people. How long will it take to assassinate each and every one of them?”

“What kind of F * cking assassin organization is this? How can it be so terrifying? A night has passed, and not even a scream has occurred!”

“Now I want to know how many assassins are hiding in our Fengtian City!”

The group of elders swallowed a mouthful of saliva and muttered.

They were afraid. They were truly afraid.

If the disappearance of three to four thousand insightful emptiness realm experts in the afternoon had caused them to feel fear, then the disappearance of several million people in the surroundings of the city overnight had caused them to be completely afraid.

Was this an assassin or a devil?

In the entire continent, the most powerful assassin organization, the Dark Nether, should not be so terrifying, right?

One had to know that the entire city’s longevity-level defensive array had been activated.

The one-eyed demon beasts were patrolling in the sky.

Even so, this group of incomparably mysterious assassins was able to make a million people disappear in a single night. They were truly demons.

“Reporting to the elders and elders, there’s a mercenary group of experts asking us to open the city gates. They want to leave this place!”

Right at this moment, a middle-aged man flew over with some fear in his eyes and reported loudly.

“What?”

Inside the room, the expressions of the elders and clan elders of the two major forces changed. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Their bodies moved and they flew out directly.

“Experts of the life and Death Pill Workshop’s holy item forging workshop, we want to leave Fengtian city. Please open the city gates!”

“We want to leave this place. The Assassins in Fengtian city are too terrifying. Millions of people disappeared overnight. We don’t want to stay here anymore!”

“That’s right. We have to leave this place. When we accepted the mission, it said that we could leave freely!”

The five elders and the group of elders had just walked out when several thousand people gathered outside and said loudly.

The five half-step longevity experts’faces darkened and they took a deep breath.

“The longevity-level array has been activated. Our Medicine Master and weapon master will arrive soon. Don’t be anxious, everyone!”

A half-step longevity expert shook his arm and said in a deep voice.

“Sir, may I know when the medicine master and Weapon Master will arrive? Who knows what will happen if they are two days late!”

“That’s right. Unless you can catch the killer hiding in Fengtian City, we don’t know when we will be assassinated!”

As soon as the half-step longevity expert finished speaking, a few elders couldn’t help but speak out.

“Please let us leave this place!”

“Please open the city gates, lords, we want to leave!”

Shouts rang out one after another, causing the elders and elders of the two great forces to float in the air with unsightly expressions.

This group of people had accepted their mission to come here.

The two major forces couldn’t order them, nor could they force them to do anything.

In fact, they didn’t even dare to make a move.

Once they made a move, which mercenary group would accept the missions of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop in the future?

“Not good, the people in that area have disappeared. The people in that area have actually disappeared!”

“Oh my God! Those killers are on the move again! We have to get out of Here!”

At this moment, a terrified voice came from a distance.

The faces of the people from the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop changed drastically.

“How is this possible? They are still making a move at this time!”

A half-step wanshou expert flew toward the direction of the voice with a furious look on his face.

“There were over ten thousand people on the street just now. In just ten seconds, they’ve all disappeared!”

“This is too terrifying! This is too terrifying! I want to leave this place! I want to leave this place!”

The half-step Wanshou expert had just flown over when a series of terrified voices sounded. One by one, figures flew towards the center.

Feng Tian City forbade flying, but at this moment, that group of people completely disregarded it.

The old man floated in the air and looked towards the empty street, sniffing.

An extremely faint smell of blood spread out, causing his body to tremble.

His icy cold gaze carefully scanned his surroundings, but he didn’t find any traces.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

“Elder Jiang, did you find anything?”

At this moment, two figures flew over and asked the old man.

“No. They assassinated more than 10,000 people on this street in an instant. How powerful are they? And how many assassins are there?”

The old man sighed and looked towards the center.

It was chaotic. The entire Fengtian city was in complete chaos.

Those who had come because of the reward directly floated in the sky, wanting to leave.

The city guards of the two major factions could only appease them.

After all, these were people on their side. What could they do?

“We can be sure that there are half-step longevity experts among this group of killers. Let us report to the Medicine Master and Weapon Master Again!”

The other two half-step longevity experts said helplessly.

“Everyone, wait here for a few minutes. We will report to the medicine master immediately. We will try our best to ensure your safety!”

The three of them flew toward the center of the crowd. Looking at the chaotic crowd, they said in a deep voice as they entered the manor below.

“Hehe, the more chaotic it is, the easier it will be for us to attack!”

At this moment, in a room not far away, Wang Xian was watching everything with a smile on his face.

The more chaotic Fengtian city was, the easier it would be for them to make a move.

Once there was a hidden location, he would make a move together with the five hundred strange demons. More than 10,000 people would be instantly killed.

After all, among the 10,000 people, there were only a dozen or so insightful void martial artists.

It was too easy to kill them.

“Retreat! Everyone, retreat from Fengtian City!”

“All the disciples of the life and Death Elixir Workshop, gather all the items and prepare to leave!”

“All the disciples of the holy item forging workshop, gather all the items and prepare to leave!”

At this moment, orders were sent one after another, causing Wang Xian to be slightly stunned.

“They escaped? They actually escaped? This...”

Wang Xian was a little speechless. This was the base of the two major factions before the battle. What did he mean by leaving now?

Admit defeat?

However, if he admitted defeat, how could he attack the fire Lark clan with this retreat?
