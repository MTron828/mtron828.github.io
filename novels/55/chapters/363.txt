Chapter 364: Horrifying Creatures Besieging the Dragon Palace (4)

Roar!

The Pliosaurus lifted its huge head and looked down on the entire Dragon Palace. Eventually, his gaze landed on Wang Xian.

Roar roar roar!

Excitement gleamed in the eyes of the Pliosaurus as he roared loudly.

A message was transmitted to Wang Xian.

“Devour me?”

When Wang Xian heard the Pliosaurus, he was infuriated.

He moved and transformed into a seven-meter-long divine dragon immediately.

Roar!

He let out a furious roar. Extending his mouth to the fullest, he growled, “Scram!”

Roar roar roar!

Prime Minister Turtle and the other members of the Dragon Palace growled in unison and shot cold looks at the surrounding marine races.

“Little thing, I’m going to devour you. I’ll be able to evolve further after consuming you!”

The Pliosaurus lowered its head, fixed its gaze at Wang Xian and growled loudly.

The Level 13 creatures had long had its intelligence manifested. From Wang Xian, it could feel a tremendous amount of energy.

It had the premonition that if it could devour this little thing, it would be able to evolve further. After which, it would be able to enter the broader seas.

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up and his heart palpitated violently upon hearing the Pliosaurus.

Roar!

At this moment, the Pliosaurus extended one of its huge wings and slapped it on the Dragon Array.

Crack crack crack!

In just a single strike, crisp cracking sounds came from the Dragon Array. Wang Xian looked up and saw cracks appearing at the location where the Pliosaurus attacked.

These cracks were healing at a very slow pace.

However, Wang Xian was certain that if the Pliosaurus were to attack again, the Dragon Array would definitely shatter.

This won’t do. The Dragon Array wouldn’t be able to withstand the attacks of the Pliosaurus. Once the Dragon Array is shattered, the Dragon Palace would be destroyed and I wouldn’t be able to escape!

Wang Xian’s expression changed constantly. At this point, he saw the Pliosaurus moving its wing once again.

“Kill!”

A deep growl came from Wang Xian. He moved and charged out of the Dragon Palace through the Eastern Gates.

He couldn’t allow the Pliosaurus to attack again. Otherwise, all of them would die.

Rumble!

A five meter blue ball of water formed before Wang Xian and was shot towards the Pliosaurus.

“Roar! Little thing, you are finally out!”

The Pliosaurus wiggled its huge wing in response to the attack from Wang Xian.

Pa!

Under the dreadful strength of the Pliosaurus, the water ball shattered instantly.

“Die!”

Wang Xian swung his dragon claws towards the wing.

“Roar! Kill!”

Behind him, Prime Minister Turtle, Roving Heavens and the crowd followed Wang Xian closely as they charged out of the Dragon Palace and attacked the Pliosaurus.

Roar!

The Pliosaurus looked in contempt as he saw Wang Xian swinging his dragon claws at it.

The Pliosaurus was almost five times the size of Wang Xian at over thirty meters long. When facing this little thing, it wasn’t wary at all.

Once again, it wiggled one of its wings towards Wang Xian.

“You must be courting death!”

Seeing the contempt in the eyes of the Pliosaurus, Wang Xian underwent a transformation. His body turned golden in color as his dragon claws glowed dazzlingly.

“Break!”

The glow of the metal extended over a dozen-odd meters in an instant. This strike was the best strike Wang Xian could put up.

Prime Massacre!

The strongest strike!

Ci ci!

Roar!

The dragon claws struck the seven meter wing and spewed blood everywhere.

The entire wing was ripped off under the attack from Wang Xian.

Grrrr, grrr!

The Pliosaurus grimaced in pain. He stared furiously at the broken wing and bloodthirst filled his eyes.

“How dare you injure me! Little thing, I’m going to devour you!”

The Pliosaurus extended its other huge wing and stretched its huge head towards Wang Xian. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Get lost!”

Wang Xian swung his giant claws from the top to bottom.

A huge five meter dragon claw left five trails of blood across the face of the Pliosaurus.

“Roar! Roar! You shall die! You shall die!”

Having been injured once again, the Pliosaurus tried to knock Wang Xian with its head.

Bam!

Wang Xian was prepared for it. The color of his body changed into that of the Earth Dragon and he used the shield of the Earth Dragon to withstand the attack.

However, the strength of the Pliosaurus was incomparably powerful. Wang Xian was knocked back several hundred meters and fresh blood oozed out from his mouth.

“How dare you injure the Dragon King! Die!”

At this instant, Prime Minister Turtle, Roving Heavens and other members of the Dragon Palace growled in unison. Huge earthy thorns with horrifying wind blades were launched towards the Pliosaurus.

Countless devilish snakes and the huge fork formed from the combined attack of the Yaksha using water streams landed heavily on the Pliosaurus.

“Ants!”

The attacks of the members of the Dragon Palace were much stronger under the 50% buff from the Dragon Palace.

Previously, if it weren’t for the buff from the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian wouldn’t have been able to injure the Level 13 Pliosaurus.

All the attacks from the Dragon Palace members landed on and wounded the Pliosaurus, infuriating it further.

This group of ant-like existence had actually injured the mighty Pliosaurus.

“With the buff from the Dragon Palace, we stand a chance in the battle!”

Wang Xian licked away the blood from his mouth. A cold light flashed in his eyes and he turned into the Metal Dragon once again. Carrying a powerful and sharp edge, he dashed forward.

“Assist the Dragon King!” Prime Minister Turtle shouted out loud. Members of the Dragon Palace glowed in a gold, blue, black and dullish yellow glow as they attacked in unison.

The physical body of the Pliosaurus was extremely tough. However, it was just an existence with a lowly bloodline. Moreover, it didn’t have any cultivation arts.

As for the members of the Dragon Palace, they had all practiced Divine Dragon Transformation. The Devil Division practiced the Devil Dragon Transformation, Roving Lobster practiced the Metal Dragon Transformation and the Prime Minister Turtle practiced the Earth Dragon Transformation. All of them were better in close combat than the Pliosaurus.

Nonetheless, their range attacks weren’t any weaker.

Countless elemental attacks exploded on the Pliosaurus.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian beamed. With the strength of all the members of the Dragon Palace, they might just be able to kill a Level 13 Pliosaurus with the assistance of the Dragon Palace.

Roar!

Wang Xian growled loudly. Revealing his razor-sharp teeth, he bit towards the Pliosaurus.

The Pliosaurus, who was defending against the attacks from the members of the Dragon Palace, instantly felt an intense pain cruising through his body.

To the right of his body, a three-meter-long wound was ripped open.

The wound was a meter deep. If it wasn’t for its huge body, this strike may very well have been fatal to it.

However, a three-meter-long and one-meter-deep wound on a thirty-meter-long body wouldn’t be considered too grave.

Rawr rawr!

The Pliosaurus was infuriated. It wiggled its huge tail and swept towards Wang Xian.

Swish!

Wang Xian’s color changed as he turned into the Earth Dragon once again and relied on the earth shield to guard him.

Bam!

Earth Dragon had the strongest defense among all other attributes. However, Wang Xian was still knocked back and threw out blood from the impact.

Wang Xian wiped off the blood from the edge of his mouth and stared coldly at the Pliosaurus.

“Roar roar! All of you here! Kill these ants-like existences for me!”

At this moment, the Pliosaurus turned to the other creatures around him and gave his orders.
