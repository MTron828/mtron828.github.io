Chapter 968: 0969 took his revenge

Translator: 549690339

More than 30 heroes of the demon hunters mercenary group were in the worship square.

Then, vice principal Zhao led them directly into the academy.

After entering the academy, there were huge trees on both sides of the road.

The trees were shaded, and each one was 100 meters tall.

These trees were all planted when the demon Hunters Academy of East Ocean City was founded, and they had a history of more than two years.

The ground of the Demon Hunter College was black, and the black soil was extremely hard.

Upon entering the demon Hunter College, Wang Xian could clearly feel that the spiritual energy in the Demon Hunter College was two to three times higher than the spiritual energy outside.

After walking for three to four hundred meters on the tree-lined road, statues appeared in front of him again.

He bowed once again.

Behind the statues were buildings.

The black buildings were as thick and heavy as the ground.

Demon Hunter Academy Library!

Demon Hunter Academy Treasury!

Demon Hunter Academy Mission Office!

In front of them, three huge buildings were exceptionally eye-catching.

These three buildings were thirty meters tall. In Eastern Sea city, they weren’t very tall, but in Demon Hunter Academy, they were considered relatively tall buildings.

Only the city towers that were four to five hundred meters tall in demon hunter college were taller than them.

In front of them were many huge buildings. The names of the classes were written on the front of each building.

There were ten thousand students in Demon Hunter College, and they were divided into ten grades.

In other words, they could stay in Demon Hunter College for ten years.

There was a learning field for every hundred students, and two instructors would teach them.

One instructor to teach the knowledge category, and one instructor to teach the combat category.

Both were very important to the students

The Demon Hunter Academy didn’t have the teaching of arrays, alchemy, and refining, so the actual combat category was more.

Sometimes, the instructor would take all the students in the class out to do missions.

“Hiss, that’s the attribute tower in front, it’s so magnificent!”

“This is the foundation of the entire Demon Hunter College. The speed of cultivating and comprehending divine abilities in the attribute tower is more than ten times faster than in the outside world!”

“I heard that entering the attribute tower requires a lot of points. I only have a pitiful 30 points in my hands!”

“I only have 20!”

After walking for more than half an hour, at the back of the college, there were seven towers emitting various kinds of energy.

There were wind attribute training towers with green wind whistling, and fiery red training towers with flames rising.

There were water attribute training towers with flowing water, and Golden and dazzling metal attribute training towers.

...

There were a total of seven of them, but there were no light and dark attributes.

“Attribute towers, training towers. They can speed up the comprehension of supernatural powers and increase the speed of cultivation!”

Wang Xian looked at the attribute towers and revealed a look of surprise.

This was the Holy Land of cultivation in the supernatural continent.

“It can increase by more than ten times. It’s similar to the current Dragon Palace. It’s even worse than the Dragon Palace!”

The Dragon Field of the Dragon Palace also had the ability to speed up the improvement of supernatural powers.

Overall, it might not be as good as the Dragon Palace.

“On each admission notice, there is a serial number from zero to nine. Everyone, take a look.”

“Students whose serial number is zero, come to me!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Students from one, come to me!”

...

One instructor after another walked out and shouted at all the students.

The group of new students walked to the corresponding instructor.

Wang Xian was number three. He walked directly to instructor number three. This was a female instructor, a middle-aged female instructor.

When he saw Wang Xian walking out, one of the twenty teachers who stood in a row smiled at Wang Xian and waved at him with a smile on his face.

The middle-aged female teacher who was in charge of student number three looked at Wang Xian in astonishment.

Some of the surrounding freshmen were also looking at Wang Xian, who was walking towards a teacher, in astonishment. Their minds were filled with thoughts.

“Student Wang, from now on, I will be in charge of the actual combat teaching of your class. If you have any needs in the future, just let me know. Oh, right, if you want to enter the attribute tower to cultivate, I will give you a pass later. You can enter directly!”

The middle-aged man said with a smile when he saw Wang Xian coming over.

There was a hint of awkwardness in his smile.

After they learned that Wang Xian was a new student of the Demon Hunter College, Vice President Xia decided to let the teachers present at the scene to be in charge of Wang Xian’s class.

Upon hearing this news, all the teachers smiled bitterly.

What the F * ck? To be the teacher of this student?

Are they qualified?

Such a student can cripple you with one hand. How are you going to teach him?

Everyone was unwilling. They had no choice but to draw lots to decide.

In the end, Wang Xian, who was tragically held in one hand, was drawn.

At that moment, his emotions were unusually complicated.

He was the only one present who had been beaten up by that evil young man!

However, when he saw the gloating expressions of the other teachers, he could only grit his teeth and agree.

Now that he was facing such a student, he could only smile instead of being polite.

“Thank you, teacher Ma!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile.

“Also, this is for you. It’s the key to a house next to the academy. This is the reward given by the academy. Follow me to meet Dean Xia and the rest later!”

The middle-aged man took out a key and said to Wang Xian again.

“Okay, thank you, teacher Ma!”

Wang Xian took the key and nodded.

“Let’s go, teacher Yuan. Bring the students to grade one, class three first!”

Teacher Ma nodded and spoke to the middle-aged female teacher. Then, he gestured to the higher-ups of the academy who were not far away.

Wang Xian followed behind him and walked in the direction of the attribute tower.

They arrived at the back of the attribute tower. There was a residence there.

Each house had its own courtyard. The scenery inside was exceptionally beautiful.

Moreover, as they were relatively close to the attribute tower, the spiritual energy here was more abundant than other places.

Vice Principal Xia and a few elders were sitting there. When they saw Wang Xian, their eyes lit up.

Wang Xian walked over and started chatting with him with a smile.

After agreeing to a few conditions of the vice principal and the rest, Wang Xian left after chatting for a few minutes.

“This young man is not simple. His temperament and calm expression are definitely not from an ordinary family. It is very likely that he is an elite disciple of one of those big families or even some sects!”

Seeing Wang Xian leave, an old man who was sitting in the courtyard said with a twinkle in his eyes.

“This is inevitable. For such a young man to possess such powerful strength, it is very likely that he is a disciple from a bloodline family who came out to gain experience!”

Vice Principal Xia who was standing at the side slowly shook the tea in his hand. “However, no matter what, we will only ask him to help our academy during the competition of the three academies. Haha!”

“That’s right. We will not offend a youth with such a mysterious identity. We will just give him some benefits and not get too involved!”

The two elders beside him smiled and nodded.

The academy did not belong to any organization. After students graduated, they would no longer have much to do with the academy.

A talented and monstrous student would attract the academy’s attention and give them some benefits. However, that was all.
