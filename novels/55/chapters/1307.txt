Chapter 1308: 1309. Under the despair of the Prince of the Light Dragon Dynasty

On the island of the Heavenly Sword sect, the people who came here left one after another.

Long Xiaochen and the other princes of the Light Dragon dynasty stared at Long Xiaotian angrily.

Looking at his smug expression, they wanted to give him a good beating.

“The second Prince of the Light Dragon dynasty is too lucky. He knows Wang Xian. With that Wang Xian’s strength and connections, it won’t be easy for him to help long Xiaotian inherit the throne!”

“I guess long Xiaotian’s ability to obtain so many mounts is related to that Wang Xian. This year, I heard from the Yan clan that the He clan is the top clan in the vast region. Young Master He is a powerful Beast Tamer!”

“That should be it. The other princes are too pitiful. What right do they have to compete with long Xiaotian? No one is helping them!”

“Before this, who knew that Wang Xian was so terrifying? Ling Jian ‘ER’s pursuit, young master he from the vast region, and even shopkeeper Qian were killed. The princes and princesses from the bloodshed empire left with their tails between their legs!”

Some of them walked out as they watched Wang Xian and long Xiaotian discussing softly.

This was especially so for Wang Xian. What happened today was too shocking for them.

The appearance of powerful figures one by one had a close relationship with him.

Even the blood flow empire was smacked in the face.

In the future, there would be very few who dared to provoke Wang Xian in the Liuhai region.

Everyone was envious that Long Xiaotian was able to befriend such a brother.

At the same time, sympathy appeared on the faces of Long Xiaochen and the rest.

When the princes heard the discussions around them, their faces turned dark and gloomy.

“HMPH!”

Long Xiaochen and the rest took a glance at long Xiaotian and Wang Xian. They snorted coldly and walked out in a huff.

“Brothers, you have to pay attention to your safety in the future!”

Long Xiaotian and Wang Xian looked at each other. A faint smile appeared in their eyes as they said provocatively.

After saying that, the two of them followed behind the princes and walked out.

Long Xiaochen and the rest paused for a moment. They did not say anything else with a gloomy face.

Buzz! Buzz

After walking out of the island of the Heavenly Sword sect, the few of them moved and flew straight into the sky ahead.

In the sky in front of them, a group of over a thousand people were waiting.

The leaders were five experts at the first level of the profound void stage.

These were all the forces of the five princes of Long Xiaochen. Initially, they were prepared to show off their forces today and wanted to recruit some subordinates.

However, it seemed that it would be very difficult for them to recruit subordinates in the future.

After all, Long Xiaotian was like the Sun in the sky now.

“Actually, every Prince of the Radiant Dragon Empire has quite a strong influence. However, the second prince met Wang Xian and now his influence has completely surpassed theirs!”

“I think it’s very likely that long Xiaotian will inherit the throne. Although their influence is not bad, the gap between them and the second prince is still a Little Big!”

“That’s hard to say. Now that the five princes have joined forces, Long Xiaotian is still not qualified to fight against them when the five of them join forces!”

Some of the forces that walked out from the surrounding looked at the subordinates of the princes in the sky and discussed in low voices with sparkling eyes.

Long Xiaochen and the others who flew to the side of the subordinates looked at Long Xiaotian.

“Second brother, don’t be complacent too early. There are still seven months left. The winner and loser haven’t been decided yet. Don’t be too arrogant. Otherwise, the higher you fly, the harder you fall. As your elder brother, I also warn you to be careful in the future!”

The five princes stood side by side. They looked at long Xiaotian coldly and warned him.

“Is that so?”

Long Xiaotian narrowed his eyes slightly. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Long Xiaochen, and the rest of you. I want to ask you something.”

At this moment, Wang Xian looked at the five of them. “It was you who hired an assassin organization to kill me a few days ago, right?”

“It’s fine if you don’t answer. It’s because there’s no one else besides you.”

“Also, the woman on the island of the Heavenly Sword sect was also arranged by you guys, right?”

He said faintly. Although he was asking them a question, he seemed to be stating a fact.

When Long Xiaochen and the rest heard Wang Xian’s words, their expressions did not change at all.

“Wang Xian, don’t slander us. Don’t think that we are afraid of you just because you have a lot of connections. In the upcoming competition for the throne, if you still want to stand on Long Xiaotian’s side, we are still enemies!”

Long Xiaochen and the rest stared at Wang Xian with dark faces as they spoke.

“Enemies? Haha, after today, all of you will no longer have the right to be my enemies!”

Long Xiaotian, who was standing at the side, suddenly laughed maniacally as he stared coldly at long Xiaochen and the rest.

“Huh?”

Long Xiaochen and the five princes were slightly stunned as they stared at Long Xiaotian in astonishment.

“RIP! There’s a group of people flying over here!”

“So many mounts! Those are long Xiaotian’s subordinates! What are they trying to do? They are no match for the five Princes Now!”

“Is... is there going to be a fight?”

The group of people who had just walked out of the Heavenly Sword Sect’s Island looked at the nearly 300 or so mounts in front of them that were flying over with killing intent soaring into the sky. All of them had shocked expressions on their faces.

“What?”

Long Xiaochen and the other princes were slightly shocked and quickly looked around.

The subordinates behind them also looked around and saw a group of people riding their mounts and surrounding them. Their expressions changed slightly.

At the same time, a hint of envy flashed in their eyes.

If they had submitted to the second Prince back then, they would also have a powerful mount!

There were more than 300 people in the group, and nearly 300 of them were riding on mounts.

Bai Qingshan and elder Zhu stood in the center and rushed over in high spirits.

“Second Prince, do you want to kill the enemy?”

The group of more than 300 people surrounded them. They stared at Long Xiaotian with fiery eyes and shouted loudly.

Do you want to kill the enemy? !

Everyone’s faces were filled with excitement and violence.

If they succeeded today, they would be the trusted aides of the future king of the Light Dragon Dynasty.

“Haha, Good, good. Second Brother, second brother, I really don’t know where your confidence comes from. You want to destroy my subordinates just because you have so many people?”

Long Xiaochen and the other five swept their eyes over long Xiaotian’s subordinates, laughed loudly, and roared with ice-cold eyes.

“Long Xiaotian, I don’t know if you’re stupid or if you want to become the crown prince too much, but I like what you’re doing!”

Long Xiaochen licked his lips as his eyes sparkled.

The five princes had joined forces. With their current strength, they were not afraid of Long Xiaotian at all.

They were even looking for an opportunity for long Xiaotian’s subordinates to travel and were ready to make a move.

What they didn’t expect was that Long Xiaotian would actually send people over at this time to determine the winner with them.

They were more than happy to see such a situation.

“Get Ready! Get Rid of these arrogant fellows for me!”
