Chapter 1126: 1127 retreated from the enemy

Translator: 5496903

“As far as the eye can see and as far as the arrow can reach, it seems that many people have forgotten the fame of our wind eye illusory arrow!”

Mou Zesen’s eyes revealed a trace of contempt when he saw the city lord of East Sea City, Lei Feihu, dodge his arrow.

Even though both of them were at rank one of the exceptional realm, his eyes were still filled with contempt!

Their Wind Eye Demon Beast clan was once famous and famous, and they had shaken the neighboring wind howl kingdom. At that time, their reputation was well known even in the star-moon kingdom.

Before joining the Dragon Palace, Mou Zesen’s strength had been at the peak of the first level of the profound void tier. Now that he had obtained the Divine Dragon bloodline and cultivated the wind dragon transformation, his strength had faintly reached the second level of the profound void tier.

Now, the only thing missing was a bit of time and the process of transforming his divine ability into a dharma idol.

“Whoosh!”

Lei Feihu dodged Mou Zesen’s attack and heaved a sigh of relief in his heart.

However, at this moment, he suddenly felt a sense of danger coming from behind him. His expression changed, and with a flash, he appeared several thousand meters in the air.

Looking at the arrow that was still chasing after him, his eyes revealed a cold expression.

“Lei Mang!”

He was wearing a blue glove in his hand, and he clenched his fist tightly as he attacked the arrow below.

“Boom!”

A bolt of lightning that was seven to eight meters thick turned into Lei Mang and attacked the arrow.

A terrifying explosion sounded and the arrow disappeared. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Mou Zesen did not continue to attack Lei Feihu. He turned his head and drew the bowstring in his hand. Green light flashed on the bowstring and a one-meter-long arrow shot toward the elder of the Heavenly Moon sect in the sky.

Only Lei Feihu and the elder of the Heavenly Moon sect had the strength of the first level of the profound void tier.

Once they were attacked by Mu Zesen, they would be injured.

“Whoosh!”

An arrow shot across the sky and directly attacked the elder of the Heavenly Moon sect who was four to five thousand meters away in the sky.

The elder of the Heavenly Moon sect and the Deputy Sect Master of the Heavenly Moon sect were jointly attacking Yan Wenshan, who was holding a magic staff.

The two of them were working together to attack one person, but at this moment, their faces were filled with vigilance.

They were somewhat shocked. This middle-aged man holding a staff and attacking with flames in his hand was simply like a ghost or God.

The terrifying control, the terrifying temperature of the flames, as well as the terrifying abhijna, caused the two of them to be in an extremely sorry state.

Even the elders of the Heavenly Moon sect were almost injured.

On the other hand, Yan Wenshan was as calm as a breeze and did not feel the slightest bit of pressure.

This made people’s faces extremely ugly.

After all, he, Yan Wenshan, was the empress who personally taught him the art of fire a thousand years ago. She was once the Empress who was at the peak of the transcendence continent.

Under his teachings, if he could not crush those of the same level, then he, Yan Wenshan, would be able to smash his head into a rock.

The sound of arrows rang out, causing the expressions of the elders of the Heavenly Moon sect to change greatly.

He already knew the identity of the Wind Eye clan, the Wind Eye Demon Beast clan that had shaken the entire howling wind kingdom a few hundred years ago.

If it wasn’t for the conflict between the royal family of the Howling Wind Kingdom and the Wind Eye clan back then, the howling wind kingdom might have become several times stronger now.

Hearing the sound of the Arrow, the Heavenly Moon sect elder hurriedly wanted to dodge to the side.

“Hehe!”

However, at this moment, a disdainful laugh suddenly sounded in his ear.

The Sky Moon sect elder’s expression changed drastically. He looked around and saw many fiery red chains writhing around him.

“Deputy Sect Master!”

He quickly cried out for help.

“Break for me!”

The Sky Moon sect deputy sect master waved his arm and numerous thorns attacked the arrow, breaking the arrow that Mu Zesen shot out.

“First, pin down the wind eye illusion Arrow’s insightful emptiness realm expert. Otherwise, his attacks can even threaten a second level insightful emptiness realm expert. Get close to him and tie him down!”

The Heavenly Moon Sect’s deputy sect master roared loudly.

“Lei Feihu, tie him down!”

The Star Moon Army’s deputy commander gritted his teeth and fought against Yu Chengzi. He swept his gaze over and roared loudly.

“Good!”

Lei Feihu hovered in the air over two thousand meters high. He stared at Mou Zesen, and a fierce expression appeared in his eyes.

“Dharma Idol: Thunder Tiger Roar!”

Having witnessed Mou Zesen’s powerful archery skills, Lei Feihu did not hesitate at all and directly unleashed his most powerful attack.

Thunder Tiger Roar.

He heavily slammed both of his hands toward the area below, and the Thunder and lightning all over his body exploded and gathered in front of him.

“Boom Boom!”

“Roar!”

A thunder and lightning tiger that was at least a hundred meters in size roared. It stared at the area below and directly dashed forward.

The crackling sound of lightning exploded in the air, causing everyone’s scalps to go numb.

Mou Zesen saw Lei Feihu charging towards him, and an illusion appeared in his hand.

“Weng Weng Weng!”

In an instant, a dense number of arrows flew towards Lei Feihu in just a second.

“Roar!”

Lei Feihu’s expression changed slightly. With an angry roar, the 100-meter-long Lei Hu opened his huge mouth and attacked the wind arrows.

Mou Zesen looked at the Lei Hu who was only a few hundred meters away from him. His expression did not change as the green glow on his arm intensified.

“Wang Xian, tell your men not to attack. Let Me Do It!”

At this moment, Wang Xian, who was watching the battle with a smile on his face in Dragon-phoenix city, suddenly heard the voice of Feng Luan from the side.

He was slightly taken aback. He looked over and realized that Feng Luan was like a volcano that was about to erupt.

His heart skipped a beat and he immediately sent a voice transmission to Mou Zesen.

Mou Zesen was slightly taken aback when he heard Wang Xian’s words. His figure flashed slightly and instantly pulled away from Lei Feihu by a thousand meters.

“Don’t even think about escaping!”

Lei Feihu saw that Mou Zesen wanted to dodge. His eyes revealed a cold glint as he growled in a low voice.

“Boom!”

However, at this moment, a will of death instantly enveloped his heart.

Lei Feihu’s expression changed drastically, and his forehead was instantly filled with cold sweat. A great fear descended upon him.

To everyone’s surprise, a small fireball that was almost condensed to the extreme flew towards Lei Feihu’s location.

The Fireball’s speed seemed very slow, but Lei Feihu did not even have the time to react.

The fireball landed on the lightning around him, and the Lightning instantly ignited a red flame.

“No...”

Sensing the terrifying danger contained within the fireball, Lei Feihu’s scalp almost exploded, and he let out a terrified roar.

This roar spread across dozens of miles.

“Boom!”

The explosion wasn’t very big, and it only covered an area of three to four meters.

The explosion exploded Lei Feihu’s body. Finally, the ball of flames, including Lei Feihu, turned into white smoke and disappeared.

The terrified screams and the muffled sound of the explosion caused the entire battlefield to fall into dead silence.

Xing Guang and the other four insightful void martial artists looked over, and their expressions changed drastically.

An instant kill. A Level 1 insightful void martial artist was actually killed in an instant. He did not have any strength left to resist, and he did not even leave behind a trace.

What kind of strength was this? At least, he was at least at the third level of the extraordinary realm, or even higher.

Fear flashed in the eyes of the four of them.

“Get out of our place. Otherwise, none of you will be able to leave!”

Feng Luan’s emotionless voice rang out, causing the hearts of everyone in star-moon kingdom on the battlefield to jump.

Only Wang Xian, who was standing beside her, saw Feng Luan’s trembling arm.

She was making a scene!
