Chapter 518: The Treasures of Remains

Crack crack crack!

The bright moon illuminated the earth and explosions erupted from various corners of the creepy region.

From time to time, one could even hear the sharp cries of the cadaveric crows.

A huge, two-meter skull was constantly devouring skeletons and cadaveric crows.

As a stream of will-o’-wisps swept across, huge flocks of cadaveric crows and skeletons fell to the ground.

The entire region was exceptionally terrifying.

Wang Xian waved his arm and a stream of fire dragon energy shrouded over. Several skeletons fell and the will-o’-wisps from them entered into the Nether Skull.

Wang Xian could feel the Nether Skull getting exhilarated as it absorbed the surrounding will-o’-wisps with greed.

“Dragon King, the Remains are really strong. The bone puppets they have created could also match us in defense and strength!” Mo Yuan led the dragonians to clean up

the battlefield before returning to Wang Xian’s side and commenting solemnly.

The disciples of the Remains together with the bone puppets they had forged gave a total of roughly seventy to eighty Inborn experts.

On top of that, Lord Ossein could even match four to five Dan Realm experts. Overall, they were incredibly tough.

At the very least, if Dong Hua Sacred Sect didn’t have Nie Wushuang, the Remains might have chosen to target Dong Hua Sacred Sect by now and could even have defeated them.

It would take roughly three ordinary Sacred Sects to stand up against it.

There were four main devil sects within Diabolism and Remains was just one of them. The strongest of them all was the Devil Corpse Palace.”

Emperor Qi was the Palace Master of Devil Corpse Palace and the strongest existence within Diabolism.

Other than the four main devil sects, there were also other devil sects. Spirits Land, Cursed Venom and Crimson Bug were examples of other devil sects below the four main devil sects.

There were also Dan Realm experts within the four main devil sects. It was just that they weren’t as insane and powerful as Lord Ossein of the Remains.

On the surface, Diabolism and the orthodox sects had equivalent strength.

As to whether the alliance of orthodox sects could eliminate Diabolism, the crux was still the battle between Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi.

“These bone-made weapons have been refined and can’t undergo further processing. What a shame!”

Wang Xian looked across the ivory daggers, bone swords and other weapons used by the Remains. They were all Level 9 weapons.

These bone-made weapons were clearly forged through unique refining methods by the Remains.

Their limits had been reached and could no longer be improved.

Wang Xian appeared beside the body of Lord Ossein, glanced at his tailbones and shook his head slightly.

“Go search for the treasures within the Remains and bring all of them here!” Wang Xian instructed Mo Yuan and the dragonians while he remained to control the Nether Skull absorbing the will-o’-wisps.

The Nether Skull was a rather mystical spiritual weapon. Now that Wang Xian had mastered the arts of forging spiritual equipment, he still couldn’t decipher how it was created.

Vaguely, he felt this involved spirit arrays.

From the staff of Adjaya, Wang Xian could also feel the presence of spirit arrays.

The Nether Skull constantly absorbed the will-o’-wisps from the bones around him.

The will-o’-wisps from the bodies of the experts from the Remains were being sucked dry.

In the end, the Nether Skull came before the corpse of Lord Ossein. Its teeth were chattering and it seemed to be exceptionally excited.

Dense and terrifying vibes came from the Nether Skull as it landed on the tailbones of Lord Ossein.

The tailbones were cracking and streams of dense will-o’-wisps entered into the Nether Skull.

Bzz bzz!

The Nether Skull started to expand to two meters once again. However, two meters wasn’t its limit as it continued to grow at an astonishing pace.

In the hands of the Deity Lady from Nether Flame, the limit of the Nether Skull was three meters. At this point, the Nether Skull had also grown to three meters.

When it reached three meters, the Nether Skull had only absorbed the third tailbone. There were another seven to go.

Streams of dense will-o’-wisps gushed into the Nether Skull. As the last tailbone was turned to ashes, the entire Nether Skull had grown to over five meters.

The five-meter skull hovered in the air. At its eyes, eerie will-o’-wisps were burning and one could feel a creepy and evil aura coming from it.

Wang Xian waved his arm and the Nether Skull returned to his hands, reverting to the size of a fist in the process.

The effects of the Nether Skull were a little like the Dragon Ball. They could both be released to attack. However, the Dragon Ball was much easier to control as compared to the Nether Skull.

If the Dragon Ball reached Level 12, he would have little use for the Nether Skull.

Even so, it was still a little weak.

“Dragon King, we have located where the Remains kept their treasures!” At this moment, Wang Xian heard Mo Yuan.

Wang Xian moved and instantly arrived in the middle of the platform used for sacrificial rituals.

Within the structure, will-o’-wisps were burning. There was also a huge five-meter skull without any flesh and blood that was being enshrined.

The treasure cove was located at the lowest level.

Wang Xian jumped in and saw Mo Yuan and the dragonians looking at the items before them.

“Dragon King, this should be the most important treasure cove of the Remains!”

The area was dark with small will-o’-wisps hovering, illuminating the area.

The underground area wasn’t big and spanned only a thousand square meters or so.

There were several racks with skeletons hung on them. These skeletons were also glowing with a dull shade.

Wang Xian looked across and realized these were the bones of experts. They were useless to him.

“Huh? This is...?”

Wang Xian walked to the left and saw pieces of black metal being placed on the rack neatly.

[Devil Shadow Steel: Level 10]

Devil Metal Steel? Inborn-level materials!

Excitement beamed in Wang Xian’s eyes. There were over a hundred pieces of Devil Steel and each was the size of a human head.

Devil attribute Inborn-level materials. I can use them to forge equipment!

Wang Xian continued moving deeper and saw masks made of human skin hung on the walls. These masks could totally change one’s appearance.

In the middle, there was a blood-red mask emitting a devilish vibe.

[Devil Shadow Mask: Level 10]

Devil Shadow Mask?

Wang Xian raised an eyebrow. He removed it and put it over his face. Instantly, energy welled up and a shadow of him appeared beside him.

The shadow looked a little illusory. If he could catch his opponent by surprise, the effects would be tremendous.

What an interesting mask! Devil Shadow Mask? Is this made from the Devil Metal Steel? Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Wang Xian pondered as he continued looking around.

[Tenacious Devil Stone: Level 10]

More Inborn-level materials!

Looking ahead, a pile of stones that were glowing dimly appeared before his sight.

There were over fifty pieces and Wang Xian was elated.

Walking to the middle, Wang Xian found several thick books. On them, the word “Remains” was written in an ancient-looking font.

This is the art of creating bone puppets!

Wang Xian stared fervently at a book before flipping it open.

“Bones have spirituality. Refining them with special materials can forge powerful and terrifying bone puppets...”

The method of forging bone puppets was recorded within. Besides that, the extraction technique of the human mask was also recorded.

Including the ability to shed one’s skin to escape.

Wang Xian took a look and shook his head. The crafting of bone puppets was too brutal.

One had to use the bones of living creatures that had just passed away or the bones of a living human!
