Chapter 1643: 1643. The fire Lark clan was in a difficult situation

“Xiao Xian, be careful. This time, it will be a year at most. You have to come back for us!”

“Also, you have to remember not to mess around with other women. Otherwise, don’t blame us for being rude!”

On the barren sea, Wang Xian stood in the sky. In front of him, a group of girls warned him.

“Don’t worry. I went out this time just to become stronger. I have no other thoughts!”

Wang Xian assured them with a straight face.

“HMPH, remember what you said!”

The group of girls stared at him in disbelief.

“I’m leaving. Feng Luan, Qing Yue, I’ll leave this place to you guys!”

Wang Xian said to them.

“Don’t worry, Little Xian!”

“Be careful!”

Lan qingyue and Feng Luan nodded.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian looked at the five hundred strange demons behind him. With a move, he flew directly in the direction of the extraordinary sea.

He only brought 500 strange demons with him on this expedition.

These 500 strange demons were the strongest force in the Dragon Palace.

Each of them was at least at the fifth level of the Seethrough realm. There were also some at the sixth level of the Seethrough realm. Including Ao Yao, there were also 10 of them.

The corpses of 60,000 experts in the vast region and the resources paid by the three superpowers were mostly spent on them.

The resources for the past half a month were also spent on the 500 strange demons.

While flying in the sky, Wang Xian swept his gaze toward the north and revealed a smile.

With Xiao Lan in the dragon and Phoenix Empire, he wasn’t worried at all.

The Life Stone that he obtained from the solipsistic sect gave Xiao Lan a huge boost in her strength.

Even Wang Xian thought that he was no match for Xiao Lan.

With her in charge, it wouldn’t be a problem even if he wasn’t around.

“Once you step into the sea of transcendence, you will be considered to have truly stepped onto the stage of the mainland. Ao Yao, you guys enter the spirit storage bag first!”

Wang Xian looked at the endless sea and said to all the strange demons beside him.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao nodded and immediately entered the storage spirit bag.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian’s figure moved and a formless yin-yang tai chi appeared under his feet. With a flash, he appeared 20 kilometers away.

Another flash and another 20 kilometers.

20 kilometers. To him, flying only took about 10 seconds. Teleporting could only reduce the time by 10 seconds.

Flying at full speed, Wang Xian flew towards the sea of transcendence at a terrifying speed.

Two kilometers per second. It would only take three days to cross the entire barren sea.

“The sea of transcendence is up ahead, and that is also the central continent region!”

“The central continent region is as big as the other regions combined. There are more than ten vast regions!”

“The Drakonid Empire occupies the east, the Aoshan Empire occupies the center, the Nine Gods Empire occupies the west, the Ten Thousand Demons Empire occupies the south, and the Phoenix dynasty occupies the north wind.”

“The five empires occupy three-fifths of the central continent’s territory. The rest of the territories are occupied by other forces!”

“The Fire Cloud Mountain of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan is not part of the five empires’territory. It is close to the Phoenix dynasty. The Life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop are also not part of the Empire’s territory. On the other hand, they are close to the nine gods Empire!”

Wang Xian looked ahead as information about the central continent appeared in his mind.

Regardless of whether it was the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan, the life and Death Pill Workshop or the holy item forging workshop, all of them belonged to the top-tier powers below the empire.

The longevity realm experts were in charge of suppressing the fire cloud sparrow clan for tens of thousands of years.

The Fire Cloud Sparrow clan was once the personal guard of the Empress of the Phoenix Empire, the strongest personal guard of the Phoenix Empire. The Empress of the Phoenix Empire retreated to the fire cloud mountain after her death.

The Life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop were not weak either.

They had been standing on the transcendent continent for 70,000 to 80,000 years. They were the strongest pill and weapon workshop on the continent. They had a deep foundation and were extremely wealthy.

According to the map in his mind, Wang Xian quickly flew towards the direction of the Fire Cloud Mountain.

The Fire Cloud Mountain was a continuous mountain range.

The mountain range was as long as 2,000 kilometers. Some of the fire elemental forces gathered in the surroundings with the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan as their backing.

“The continent is ahead. It should be the territory of the Phoenix Dynasty!”

After flying for two days, the continent appeared in Wang Xian’s sight.

He hesitated for a moment before flying towards the direction of the continent.

At the very least, he needed to understand some information about the entire central continent region and the strongest place on the continent.

“There’s a city ahead!”

After flying for two hours, a city appeared in his line of sight.

It was a city with a radius of 100 kilometers. The city walls were not very high, but the layers of thick formations were obviously higher than the vast area.

Wang Xian’s body moved and landed on the ground. He walked quickly into the city.

There were many ferocious beasts running around the city. With a glance, there were many level five or six extraordinary ferocious beast mounts.

There were even quite a number of level eight or nine extraordinary ferocious beasts riding on them.

“The strength of any random remote city is no weaker than the strength of a medium-sized city in the vast region!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. He raised his head and looked at the city gate.

The words ‘Feng dynasty side city’were carved on the top of the city gate.

It was very lively inside the city. There were also many people.

The overall strength of the people here was also slightly higher than the vast area. However, perhaps it was due to the remote city, it was not much higher.

Wang Xian walked past the city and bought a map. Then, he continued to fly in the direction of Fiery Cloud Mountain.

“The arcane city of the Phoenix dynasty is the closest to fiery cloud mountain. It is also the border city of the Phoenix Dynasty!”

Wang Xian flew. According to the information on the map, a day later, a city that was two to three times bigger than the peaceful city appeared in his line of sight.

This city belonged to a border city of the Phoenix dynasty.

“I didn’t expect the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan to be forced into such a situation. They actually requested for reinforcements from our Holy Fire clan. They are really declining!”

“Back then, when the Empress failed to achieve Nirvana, the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan actually went into seclusion. If they didn’t go into seclusion, how would the current life and Death Pill Workshop and holy item forging workshop dare to provoke them?”

“In my opinion, the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan is too arrogant. It’s not good to be enemies with anyone. They just had to provoke the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop. Now, they want us to make a move. HMPH!”

“No matter what, we are not the main force in their battle this time. Let’s just let the disciples of our clan gain experience!”

Just when Wang Xian arrived at the entrance of the Arcane Art City, he saw a team of more than a thousand people coming out of the city.

The leaders were two old men. Wang Xian could tell their strength at a glance.

Ninth level of the Void Interpretation Stage!

Behind them, half of them were void interpretation stage powerhouses!

At least 500 of them were void interpretation stage powerhouses!

In the middle of the team, a few young men were chatting with displeasure on their faces.

“The Holy Fire clan, the fire Lark Clan has already reached the point of asking for help from others? It seems that their situation is not looking good!”

Wang Xian paused for a moment and revealed a look of surprise. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The biggest trump card of the fire Lark clan that dared to provoke the two major factions was that they had some connections with a powerful clan in the Phoenix dynasty.

This relationship was enough for them to come over and help the fire Lark clan.

Now, it seemed that the fire lark clan had already used this relationship.

From the looks of it, the other party did not seem to be very happy about it!
