Chapter 113: Known Throughout University of Rivertown (4)

Sarcastic laughter was heard in the Taekwondo Club. Most of the members had only mocking expressions when they saw the young man at the door.

They looked relaxed as though they were watching a show.

They did not regard Wang Xian highly even though he was here for the challenge.

Sparring with their President was as good as getting bashed by their President.

“Hey, Lad. Wait over here. I’ll get our President here.”

A burly member gazed disdainfully at Wang Xian from head to toe.

“Hurry up, I’m busy!”

Wang Xian looked at that member before he walked impassively to a chair.

“Hmph, how arrogant. I hope you can remain arrogant later!”

Seeing the impatient look on Wang Xian, that member snorted and went to the back of the club.

People who had followed Wang Xian to the Taekwondo Club were standing around with interest.

In less than a minute, Xu Qingcheng appeared with five members behind him.

All of them fixed their eyes on Wang Xian, who was sitting in the chair.

Xu Qingcheng displayed a mocking expression on his face. He did not expect that Wang Xian would run over here.

“Some courage you’ve got. Not a coward, huh!”

Xu Qingcheng slowly walked towards Wang Xian. The way he gazed at Wang Xian was as though he was almighty.

Wang Xian hated this kind of person!

Self-flattering!

“I don’t have time for you people. Xu Qingcheng, show me your best. I want to see if you’re formidable like what others have said!”

Wang Xian stood up and stared at Xu Qingcheng.

“Brother Cheng, this fellow is too cocky. You don’t even have to step out. I can take him on!”

Before Xu Qingcheng could say anything, the burly member spoke his mind. He stared at Wang Xian with a dismissive look as he stretched his well-built body. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Wang Xian was 1.75 meters tall. He was not very tall, and he was quite skinny.

As such, none of the long-time members of the Taekwondo Club regarded him highly.

“How can you be such a bully?” Xu Qingcheng gestured for him to shut up. He put on a smiling face and looked at Wang Xian, “I’ve made myself clear on the forum. This is just sparring. There is no restriction to the type of martial arts used. Anything will do. Let me see the capability of this highly-acclaimed character. I want to know how qualified he is to dine with Lan Qingyue and Guan Shuqing!”

Wang Xian laughed at his words as he threw a taunting look at Xu Qingcheng. “Save me that look. You asked me here to show off yourself. Since you want to have some fun, I’ll do it with you. Let’s do some sparring!”

The smile on Xu Qingcheng froze on his face when he heard what Wang Xian said. He looked coldly at Wang Xian. “Fine, since you’re courting your own doom, I’ll grant your wish!”

“Heh heh!”

Wang Xian looked at the sparring arena in the center of the club. With a face full of smiles, he walked towards it.

“Enjoy the walk. You might be carried out of this place later.” Xu Qingcheng’s cold voice came from behind him.

“Old Wang, are... are you confident?” Wang Dahai, next to him, asked him with concerns.

Wang Xian gave him an assuring look.

“They’re really sparring. Hurry, let’s get a good seat!”

“Before we comment on the fight, Wang Xian is indeed courageous to begin with!”

“Courageous, my ass! Sparring with Xu Qingcheng is simply looking for his own trouble!”

“Haha, I really want to see Xu Qingcheng.”

The surrounding students were exhilarated as the two of them headed to the arena. All of them quickly circled around the arena.

“Brother Cheng, you don’t even have to dirty your hands. This is overkill!” a few guys around Xu Qingcheng looked at Wang Xian and said disdainfully.

“It’s okay. I’ll not use both hands and give him some handicaps. If not, someone will think I’m a bully.”

Xu Qingcheng looked at the figure in front of him with a smiling face. An idea came to him. He looked at the few people beside him and continued, “Later, you’ll go live on the forum so that all students in the University of Rivertown will know him!”

“Live? “Some of the members brightened their eyes and chuckled, “Sure, Brother Cheng. Leave this to us.”

Going live on the forum did not mean video streaming, but more like updates using images.

One of the members took his phone out and snapped a few photos of Wang Xian.

Subsequently, he found a few more angles to take charming photos for Xu Qingcheng.

He opened the school forum and drew his lips slightly while starting a new thread.

Title: [Who will kneel? Xu Qingcheng, the Prince Charming vs. Wang Xian, the Beast with a handicap of two hands.]

He had a smirk when he looked at the headline and photos he posted.

Edit, send.

Wang Xian and Xu Qingcheng walked into the ring, which was surrounded by hundreds of students.

Many students took out their phones, ready to record this PK match.

The members of the Taekwondo Club were spectating the match with ease. They were waiting for their President to abuse his target.

“You still turn up despite knowing you’ll lose. Lad, you aren’t really that lousy.”

Xu Qingcheng stood around casually in his white Taekwondo robe, criticizing Wang Xian.

It was as if a teacher was reviewing a student.

“Why not this? I’ll not use either of my hands!”

Xu Qingcheng went on. He placed his hands behind his back, protruding the black belt on his waist.

This symbolized his strength.

“Wow, Senior Xu Qingcheng is simply too cool!”

“Such generosity by not using his hands. Prince Charming Xu Qingcheng is too domineering.”

“This is the stance that a powerhouse should adopt. Comparing him to Wang Xian, Wang Xian is just an evil clown!”

The students outside of the ring were deeply impressed by Xu Qingcheng. He was looking mighty with his hands behind his back.

The member who was posting on the forum took a few snapshots excitedly. His caption was written as [The look of a winner].

[Wow, that Wang Xian accepted the challenge from Senior Xu Qingcheng.]

[Ah, I’m in the dormitory now. I wonder if I can still make it to watch how Senior Xu Qingcheng knocks out Wang Xian with a kick!]

[Xu Qingcheng already gave him the leeway by not using his hands. Wang Xian will be embarrassed if he can’t even block 10 strokes from him.]

[Thread owner, please update soon. We want to see the photos of how Beast Wang Xian was beaten to a pulp. You must take more photos.]

There were more than hundreds of replies below the thread that was started not long ago.

The excitement was all over that member’s face.

“I’ll let you start first!”

Just then, Xu Qingcheng’s voice was heard from the ring again. He tilted his head slightly and sneered at him!

“Do it. This is your only chance to strike. Haha!”

“President, let’s not talk about giving him a two-hands handicap. Even if you use just your leg, you can also send him flying with a kick.”

Confident and sarcastic voices came from a group of Taekwondo members outside the ring.
