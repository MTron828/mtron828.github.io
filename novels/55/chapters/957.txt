Chapter 958: Under the Panic of the 0959 Caravan

Translator: 549690339

“Who is it?”

The sudden voice caused the expressions of all the experts in the caravan to change slightly. They hurriedly looked towards the direction of the hidden weapons.

“Watch out, be careful!”

A leader of the mercenary group shouted loudly.

“Clang, Clang, Clang!”

Everyone pulled out their weapons and looked around vigilantly.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

At this moment, one metal after another was inserted into the carriage. Everyone quickly looked over.

Supervisor du and elder Xiao suddenly had a bad premonition. They looked around with an awkward expression and walked towards the carriage.

“This is?”

When they just arrived, a member of the mercenary group had already walked over and removed the hidden weapon embedded in the carriage.

“This... Spirit Beast mercenary group? This... Why is this the Spirit Beast Mercenary Group’s Badge?”

The mercenary group member let out a cry of fear and pulled out one badge after another with a face full of shock.

“Spirit Beast Mercenary Group’s Badge?”

Supervisor du and elder Xiao’s expressions changed drastically.

Why would the Spirit Beast Mercenary Group’s Badge Be Here?

The badge was directly pinned onto the clothes. Even if it was a battle, it would be very difficult for it to fall off!

Unless...

In an instant, their foreheads were full of cold sweat. The two of them looked at each other and hurriedly walked over.

“This is Deputy Commander Ling’s Badge!”

At this moment, the mercenary group member widened his eyes and said loudly.

“Deputy Commander Ling’s badge. This... won’t happen, won’t Happen!”

Supervisor du and elder Xiao hurriedly walked over and snatched the badge from that person’s hand.

When they saw the badges one by one, their pupils couldn’t help but shrink.

The number of badges was the same as the number of experts from the Spirit Beast mercenary group who had just left.

“What happened? Could it be?”

Their expressions changed drastically.

“Oh right, where are Vice Commander Ling and the others? Why aren’t they here?”

“Eh, it’s true. Several experts from the spirit beast mercenary group have also disappeared!”

At this moment, the people of the mercenary group and the Chamber of commerce around them suddenly noticed that vice commander Ling and the others had disappeared. Their expressions changed slightly.

“Those badges?”

The faces of some people from the Chamber of Commerce slowly turned solemn. They looked at supervisor du and elder Xiao.

Obviously, they were hiding something!

“Supervisor Du, elder Xiao, Vice Commander Ling and the others?”

Finally, a person in charge of the caravan couldn’t help but ask.

On the way from holy sea town to East Sea city, their caravan rarely encountered transcendent-level rank 7 beasts, but transcendent-level rank 6 beasts were definitely not rare.

Especially for the huge caravan, the caravan could deter some weak beasts from attacking.

But as long as it was a beast that dared to attack the caravan, its strength was not weak.

Moreover, a huge caravan lacked flexibility. If there were no experts guarding it, it would be safer to travel alone in a small chamber of Commerce.

However, now that their caravan’s transcendent-level rank 7 expert was not seen to be dead, it made them somewhat fearful.

They had only covered one-third of the journey, and the rest of the journey was still very long. Without a transcendent-level rank 7 expert, it would be very difficult to reach East Sea city safely! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Supervisor du and elder Xiao’s faces were gloomy and uncertain.

The sudden appearance of the badge completely made them panic.

Vice Commander Ling and the others might really have met with an accident.

And once something happened, their two chambers of commerce would be finished!

Without the Spirit Beast mercenary group, how could they return to East Sea city.

What worried them the most was who gave them the badge?

The Zhou Chamber of Commerce and the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group?

Seeing the expressions of supervisor du, elder Xiao, and the others, the faces of the people in charge of the Chamber of Commerce slowly turned ugly.

They must know what vice-leader Ling and the others had gone to do!

Moreover, the current situation was that something had happened to the other party!

“Supervisor Du, elder Xiao, say something. What should we do now?”

A person-in-charge of the Chamber of Commerce asked with a gloomy face.

All the people in the caravan were staring at them, their faces extremely ugly.

“There are still two-thirds of the way back. Do We have to go back?”

Supervisor du looked at elder Xiao with a gloomy face and asked in a low voice.

“Go Back? How can we go back? We have already traveled one-third of the way back. If we go back, when can we go back to Eastsea City? How much will we lose this time? Our Chamber of Commerce can’t afford to lose!”

“That’s right. Even if we go back, we’ll issue a mission in holy sea town and have the powerful mercenary group of East Sea city pick us up. The commission will be even higher!”

Before elder Xiao could speak, the people in charge of the Chamber of Commerce who heard this immediately said loudly.

This caused supervisor du and elder Xiao’s expressions to instantly turn ugly.

“But right now, we don’t have any transcendent-level rank 7 experts to hold down the fort. If we continue moving forward, such a huge team will encounter five or six transcendent-level rank 6 beasts. It will be extremely troublesome!”

Another person in charge of the Chamber of Commerce said loudly with an embarrassed expression.

They all stared at supervisor du and elder Xiao, their eyes flickering.

With this huge chamber of Commerce joining forces, as the organizer, the Ivy Chamber of Commerce and the Xiao Chamber of Commerce would receive huge benefits. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have needed to hire a powerful mercenary group to move forward with them.

Now that the Spirit Beast mercenary group was in trouble, they were also in trouble!

What angered them the most was that supervisor du and elder Xiao had obviously hidden something from them.

“Continue moving forward. We will return all of Your Spirit Stones to You!”

Supervisor du and elder Xiao said with extremely unsightly expressions.

“Our mercenary group doesn’t care about your matters. However, because of your situation, this mission has become extremely difficult. If you don’t give us a satisfactory answer, we have the right to reject your mission!”

However, just as they finished speaking, a mercenary group leader walked out and swept his gaze across all the chambers of commerce.

“That’s right, the difficulty of this mission has more than doubled. If we reach eastsea town, there is a very high chance of death. We will quit this mission!”

“There is another way. Each Chamber of Commerce will leave alone. The smaller the number of people, the less danger there will be!”

Another two mercenary groups spoke up.

Because of the person who issued the mission, the difficulty of their mission had more than doubled. They had the right to terminate the mission and receive a part of the compensation.

In the current situation, if they continued to move forward, it would be extremely dangerous for the mercenary groups.

Moving alone, although the danger was still great, it was much lower.

Supervisor du and elder Xiao trembled when they heard the words of the mercenary group.

Whether it was ending the mission or acting alone, it would put them in a desperate situation.

“No!”

They quickly exclaimed.

“This is not up to you!”

A mercenary group stared at them coldly.

“We are willing to give you a satisfactory reward. The caravan will continue moving forward!”

The two people clenched their teeth and growled in a low voice.

This time, they simply lost a lot! !
