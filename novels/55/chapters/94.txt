Chapter 95: Underworld Affairs

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“Brother, where are we going?”

After Wang Xian settled the middle-aged man, Xiao Yu, Yuan Yuanyuan and Su Qian questioned him after their lunch.

“It’s about two o’clock, why don’t we...”

Buzz!

Just when Wang Xian was about to take them to the Summer Sun Resort to relax, his phone suddenly rang.

“Old Xue.”

Wang Xian took out his phone and looked at the number with surprise. Old Xue seldom called him. It was always Xue Jing who contacted him the most.

“Hello, OId Xue!”

Wang Xian picked up the phone and greeted doubtfully.

“Wang Xian, are you busy?” Old Xue’s voice was heard on the phone.

“Hur? What’s the matter, Old Xue?” asked Wang Xian curiously.

“There is something that I would like to discuss with you. Old Qin is with me too. I wonder if you’re free in the afternoon!”

Wang Xian hesitated before he nodded, “Okay, I’ll pop by!”

“I’ll send you the address, or I can get someone to pick you up.”

“I can go over on my own. You can just send me the address!”

“Sure, see you later!”

Wang Xian nodded and hung up. He glanced at Xiao Yu and the other two girls with a shrug of his shoulders.

“Xiao Yu, I can’t keep you company in the afternoon. I’ve got something going on!”

“That’s great. It would be inconvenient for the three girls to follow you around too. Hehe. Besides, we can check out the school too,” said Xiao Yu to Wang Xian with a smile.

“You little one, go ahead and have fun. I’ve got to go.” Wang Xian patted her head and followed them to the school.

He came to the back of the dormitory and rode on his Harley motorcycle before he headed to the place Old Xue sent him.

“Wow, Xiao Yu. The Harley motorcycle that your brother is riding is so cool. Do you think I could stand a chance with him after I slim down?”

Su Qian looked at Wang Xian with affectionate eyes. She then looked at her plump figure with dissatisfaction.

“Hehe, my brother seems to have a girlfriend. But if you slim down, I’m sure you will be gorgeous.” Xiao Yu chuckled as she spoke.

“You’re very kind,” said Yuan Yuanyuan gratefully as she gazed at Wang Xian who had left and Xiao Yu who was right by her side.

“That’s enough. I wanted to get my brother to bring us out. But since he has something on, we can walk around and get some daily necessities. We should also decorate our room too.”

...

The address that Old Xue sent him was not Summer Sun Resort. It was another place.

An area that was near the sea with many villas – Bamboo Forest Estate.

When he reached it, Wang Xian made a call, and Xue Jing rushed over soon after.

“Brother Wang Xian, you’re here. My grandfather and Old Qin are waiting for you!”

“What did Old Xue and Old Qin ask me here for?” Wang Xian asked Xue Jing curiously.

Xue Jing paused before he said, “Should be something to do with the underworld affairs!”

“Underworld affairs?”

Xue Jing nodded slowly. There were two ecosystems in the current modern world — Society and underworld.

Underworld was a place for people who possessed domineering powers.

Wang Xian followed Xue Jing into the villa, which was surrounded by a bamboo forest. Along the path, he found a quiet stream with a small bridge that made a picturesque scene.

From the wooden door, he entered into a courtyard where he could see some nostalgic and posh-looking houses.

In the courtyard were some ponds with ornamental fish.

Old Qin and Old Xue were sitting under a willow tree on the left, drinking their tea.

“Wang Xian is here!”

Both Old Xue and Old Qin smiled and greeted him as they saw him.

“Sorry to keep both of you waiting.”

Wang Xian smiled and sat on the seat beside them. Xue Jing was filling a cup of tea for him.

“I just arrived not long ago too.” Old Qin smiled and shook his head, “We wanted to discuss something with you today. Hence, we invited you over.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“What is it about?” Wang Xian took a sip of tea and asked.

“Let me explain.” Old Xue straightened his posture with a solemn expression. “It has something to do with the underworld. Something has been brewing in the underworld these past two days. Those hidden clans and sects revealed themselves one after another. I’m afraid there will be upheavals in the underworld soon.”

“Oh?” Wang Xian expressed his curiosity, “Hidden clans? Hidden sects?”

“That’s right. The number one Ancient Martial Arts Family in Rivertown, Yan Family, returned yesterday after staying out of underworld affairs for 20 years. The Lingluo Sect of the provincial city began their recruitment of disciples all of a sudden. Fierce battles broke out between the two sects in the north due to some cultivation treasures. A sect in the Eastern Sea announced that they will be expanding and recruiting more disciples. The Sacred Followers Guild began their recruitment too.” Old Xue explained this slowly to him.

“Yan Family? Disciples’ recruitments?” Wang Xian was deep in thought. “Why did these hidden clans and sects start their recruitments all of a sudden?”

“Because they wanted to compete for resources in advance.” Old Xue frowned and continued, “Currently, the cultivation resources are lacking. It is even scarce when we’re now in the modern era. These hidden clans needed more people to search for resources, tackle other living creatures, and refine medicines.”

“Other living creatures?” Wang Xian was stunned as he raised his eyebrows.

“Yes, Wang Xian. You may not know these. Humans are not the only domineering ones on Earth. There are also other creatures around.”

“Let’s not go into the mysterious ocean. Numerous spirits and monsters lie in the mountains and rivers too. Creatures like sea monsters that lurk around various lakes and the well-known monsters in the mountains are all spirits and monsters!”

“Just like Jianghai Lake in the Rivertown. I’m sure you would have heard of all the tales about the sea monsters in Jianghai Lake.”

Upon hearing that, Wang Xian nodded his head gently. Jianghai Lake was a lake that connected to the sea. The lake was huge with a depth of 178 meters.

He knew about the tales with regards to the sea monsters in Jianghai Lake, but he did not pay attention to it.

“The tales about the water and sea monsters have always been around. But not all are rumors. They really exist. Currently, we’re lacking cultivation resources. Hence, we need to find other ways to them. Just recently, someone caught some powerful creatures to enhance their own strength, and the effect was significant.”

“Currently, various Ancient Martial Artist Families surfaced just to compete for these resources. The underworld will be greeted with bloodshed and brutal fights again. At that time, not only the hidden Ancient Martial Artist Families will be involved, but ancient sects might also join in too.”

Wang Xian listened quietly to the conversation between Old Qin and Old Xue. From the conversation, he had a deeper understanding of the cultivation techniques of the various clans and sects in this world.

Currently, not only the ancient martial arts existed, but there were also ancient yoga, Ninjutsu, western Bloodline Art, and Beast Transformation Art.

But, in actual fact, all Cultivation Arts may seem different, but they were similar to each other. Towards the later stages of the cultivation, all the goals of the cultivations were the same.

Wang Xian not only learned about the Cultivation Arts, but he also found out a lot of anecdotes about the underworld’s mountain spirits and sea monsters.

That’s interesting. Sea Monsters? Currently, my cultivation speed is too slow. Perhaps I can devour them or recruit some sea monsters to build up the Dragon Palace as soon as possible!

Wang Xian pondered to himself. He was not concerned about those hidden clans which surfaced in the underworld again. He trusted himself.

And the Dragon Sect which was developing rapidly!
