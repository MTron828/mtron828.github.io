Chapter 109: The Fight Between Two Women

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

[Liu Feng, the third-year student, drove a sports car. With flowers in his hand, he was rejected by Guan Shuqing for his confession!]

[Guan Shuqing turned down Liu Feng’s confession flatly and went lunch with another guy!]

[Who is this guy? Guan Shuqing actually rejected Liu Feng, who drove a sports car and went to the canteen for lunch with him?]

[Bro Liu Feng, are you heartbroken? Did you throw your face?]

As his roommates looked at him with bewilderment, Wang Xian opened his computer and read the messages one by one.

The entire school forum was flooded with dozens of threads regarding Liu Feng’s confession for Guan Shuqing.

Wang Xian clicked on a thread randomly.

[Our third-year senior, Liu Feng, was in his formal attire, driving his Audi R8 Sports Car that was worth more than two million dollars in the school. He held a beautiful bouquet of flowers and confessed to the Goddess Guan Shuqing.

Just when all the students thought he was going to succeed, Guan Shuqing rejected him without hesitation. She then walked off to the canteen and had lunch with a guy who was waiting for her with empty hands.

All of you did not witness the mixed expression on Senior Liu Feng’s face back then. A loaded person like him actually lost to a nobody.

Heart-shattering. This is too heart-shattering.]

In addition to the text, some pictures were uploaded too.

With one knee down, a guy was holding flowers with a luxurious car beside him.

In the end, the girl who received the confession left with another guy.

The photos were clearly taken. Guan Shuqing, Liu Feng and another guy were clearly captured in the photos.

“I look handsome, but...” Wang Xian looked at himself in the photos and gave a bitter smile.

“Old Wang, you’re going to be famous. Damn! You are courting Goddess Guan Shuqing quietly. You need to give us a treat. A treat!” Zhang Wen was yelling from the bottom bunk.

“I don’t want to be famous!”

Wang Xian shook his head. As he continued scrolling down, he was surprised to find a video clip.

The entire incident that had happened in the afternoon was recorded in the video. This made him speechless.

At the same time, Lan Qingyue was sitting in front of the computer on her desk as she browsed the school forum in the female dormitory.

Her face paled, and she bit her lip tightly when she saw Wang Xian and Guan Shuqing walking side by side to the canteen.

Eventually, her face revealed a determined expression.

Wang Xian had gone famous. Other classes might not know him, but his own classmates would definitely recognize him.

As such, all his classmates were staring at him when he arrived at his class in the afternoon.

The guys were half envious, half jealous of him. Some even gave him a thumbs up.

“Awesome!”

Wang Xian chuckled.

In the afternoon, he had two lessons. With a Divine Dragon’s body, Wang Xian’s memory had attained a daunting level.

Learning was far too easy for him.

Just when he was in class, his phone rang suddenly.

He checked his phone and realized it was a WeChat message from Lan Qingyue.

[Can we have dinner tonight?]

A shy emoticon was attached behind the text.

Wang Xian got used to how Lan Qingyue chatted in a girly manner.

He pondered and replied, [Sure!]

[Great, do you have class in the afternoon?]

[Yes, I’m in the midst of it, but it is going to be over soon.]

[Okay, I’ll look for you then!]

[Okay!]

After he chatted with Lan Qingyue for a while, Wang Xian looked at the time. It was almost 5 pm. Time for dinner.

At this time, Lan Qingyue was dressed elegantly in a blue dress. She had a slim figure and a refined profile.

She bunned her hair up, which gave her a youthful and noble vibe.

While waiting for the class dismissal, Lan Qingyue stood quietly in front of the building with a bottle of water in her hand.

5 pm. The school bell rang.

“Old Wang, let’s have dinner together. I’m starving!” Wang Dahai shouted loudly as soon as the class was over.

“Let’s go together!” Zhang Wen said in agreement.

“Hey, Wang Xian might not be going with you guys. With the company of a beautiful girl, who still would want to stick around with you guys?”

“Damn, Old Wang. Are you that kind of person who forsakes friends for love?”

Three of them, Wang Dahai, Zhang Wen, and Zhang Feng, raised their voices as they stared at him.

Wang Xian looked at them speechlessly. He said, “Eh, not tonight. I’ll treat you guys to dinner tomorrow!”

“Gosh, Zhang Feng is right. Old Wang, I never expected you to be such a person!”

“Geez, if I had such a pretty girlfriend like Guan Shuqing, I would want to stick with her all day long.”

“Let’s go and ignore this ungrateful fellow. The three of us will have dinner on our own!”

They walked out as they talked.

Wang Xian shook his head without any words. He followed behind them and sent a message to Lan Qingyue: [Where are you?]

However, he spotted a blue figure in front of the building when he walked out of his class.

“Wow, Lan Qingyue. It’s Lan Qingyue!”

“Lan Qingyue is extremely gorgeous. Her beauty is beyond comparison. We could only appreciate her from afar!”

“Lan Qingyue is a well-known goddess in our school. She’s even more famous than Guan Shuqing. I heard her family owns billions of assets. She’s way too awesome!”

“If I could marry a goddess like her, I’d be willing to shorten my life by 20 years.”

The rest of the guys, including Zhang Wen, Zhang Feng, and Wang Dahai, were commenting on her as they looked at the blue figure fervently.

Guan Shuqing was a Goddess, and she was known as one of the five Goddesses in school.

Same for Lan Qingyue. But Lan Qingyue enjoyed a higher reputation than Guan Shuqing in the University of Rivertown.

Firstly, she was the vice-chairman of the student council. Secondly, she was a billionaire princess.

Elegant, aloof, and she made people feel ashamed of themselves.

Guan Shuqing received many confessions, but not Lan Qingyue, as not many guys had the confidence to do it.

Even the children of the wealthy families did not dare to fool around in front of her.

Elegant, aloof! This was Lan Qingyue!

“Hey, Lan Qingyue rarely makes an appearance in school. I wonder who she is waiting for!” Wang Dahai said curiously.

“Perhaps it has something to do with the student council!” Zhang Feng made a guess.

The rest of the surrounding students were staring at Lan Qingyue with interest.

Wang Xian chuckled when he overheard their conversations as he walked towards Lan Qingyue.

“Hey, Old Wang. Where are you meeting Guan Shuqing?” asked Wang Dahai curiously as he spotted Wang Xian walking out. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“I’m not having dinner with Guan Shuqing!”

Wang Xian spun around and smiled at him. Without any words, he came to Lan Qingyue.

“Sorry to keep you waiting!” Wang Xian looked at her and said with a smile.

“I just got here too. Let’s go to the canteen. There’s a new delicious hot-plate rice!” Lan Qingyue smiled as she handed the beverage to Wang Xian, “This is for you!”

Wang Xian was a little stupefied when he looked at the pretty and gentle Lan Qingyue. “Thanks!”

“Let’s go. It’s been a long time since I last ate in the canteen!”

Lan Qingyue was tagged closely to Wang Xian as they made their way to the canteen.

Wang Dahai, Zhang Wen, Zhang Feng, and the rest of the classmates were behind them.

They watched them walking off with their eyes wide open. All their faces wore unbelievable looks on them.
