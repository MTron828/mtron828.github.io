Chapter 1295: 1296. You are too ugly and not qualified

Long Xiaotian frowned slightly. Indeed, just as long Xiaochen had said, using such a low-level method to frame Wang Xian and implicate him was of no use.

A woman could at most cause Wang Xian’s reputation to be a little bad.

But speaking of which, it didn’t affect Wang Xian at all. In a world where strength reigned supreme, there was no need to care about anything else.

Looking at the seductive fox and Luo Hongjuan on the ground, Long Xiaotian looked at Wang Xian again.

Even he had some doubts. Wang Xian was really a reckless person who was always abandoned.

When the crowd heard long Xiaochen’s words, they nodded their heads silently.

They also knew that it was meaningless to use such means in the fight for the throne.

It was impossible for the Prince of the Light Dragon dynasty to use such low-level means. This had no effect on the overall situation.

With this, it made others think that Wang Xian was a scumbag.

“HMPH, Fengying, I didn’t expect your friend to be so despicable. I think it’s better for you not to get so close to him in the future!”

Xiao Ya and Zhang Fengying came closer. When they heard the conversation over here, they said angrily.

Zhang Fengying looked at Wang Xian and then looked at the Vixen. She frowned slowly.

“I don’t know why you are trying to frame me. But let me tell you, you are from the Fox clan, right? I will seek justice!”

Wang Xian looked at Hu Mei who was trying to frame him. His heart was filled with killing intent.

Since the other party dared to deal with him, he would have to pay the price.

And some of the costs were not something that some people could afford.

Hu Mei’s face turned pale when she heard Wang Xian’s cold words. Her Eyes revealed a look of horror.

She couldn’t help but take a glance at the 42nd Prince’s position.

The 42nd Prince’s expression changed slightly as well. He immediately shouted, “Hmph, you are really arrogant. Don’t think that you can do whatever you want just because you have second brother. Why? Don’t tell me you want to exterminate the Fox bloodline clan? How arrogant!”

When Wang Xian saw Hu Mei’s pleading gaze earlier, he looked at the 42nd Prince with a cold gaze.

“I hate arrogant people like you the most. Not only did you abandon a woman, you even wanted to exterminate another family. Let me tell you, don’t be too arrogant. Do you believe that I can exterminate you?”

Jiang Chuan raised his head slightly and took a few steps forward. He stared coldly at Wang Xian and said with a face full of disdain.

“Hiss... looks like this guy has angered the public. Even Young Master Jiang Chuan Can’t stand it anymore!”

“Jiang Chuan is the descendant of the Dean of the Divine Wind Academy. If he really wants to deal with this Wang Xian, he really has the ability to do so!”

“I support Young Master Jiang Chuan to kill this scumbag, Haha!”

“Young Master Jiang Chuan is so upright. I support you!”

When the surrounding people heard Jiang Chuan’s words, they all looked over with admiration and admiration.

When Jiang Chuan saw this scene, he raised his head slightly with a smile on his face.

He glanced at Zhang Fengying, who was not far away, with a smug look in his eyes.

He was standing at the highest point of justice. If he were to trample on a jerk, she would definitely look up to him.

“Wow, Young Master Jiang Chuan is really handsome. Fengying, Jiang Chuan has been chasing you for such a long time. You should consider it. He’s handsome, strong, and has a strong background.”

“You have to stay away from this guy. Such a scumbag is really annoying!”

Xiao Ya looked at Jiang Chuan who stood up and spoke to Wang Xian in a domineering manner. A hint of admiration appeared on her face as she spoke to Zhang Fengying.

“Jiang Chuan, if you dare to touch my brother, you better consider the consequences!”

Long Xiaotian stared coldly at Jiang Chuan and said coldly.

“Humph, what? Long Xiaotian, do you think I’m afraid of You?”

Jiang Chuan’s face turned cold when he saw long Xiaotian threatening him.

“Second brother, it’s good to protect your friend, but don’t forget your heart and don’t be too arrogant!”

Long Xiaochen and the others took a few steps forward and said in a tit-for-tat manner.

Everyone was slightly silent when they saw this scene.

In the current Liuhai region, the strongest few powers were the blood flow empire and the Heaven Sword sect.

Next were the Hanhai Empire, the Light Dragon Empire and the Divine Wind Academy.

Long Xiaotian and Jiang Chuan were confronting each other. Other than those few forces, no one else had the right to interfere.

However, many people were on Jiang Chuan’s side this time.

“Wang Xian, is this true?”

At this moment, Zhang Fengying, who was standing at the side, walked towards Wang Xian and asked with a frown.

“Huh?”

Zhang Fengying walked out, causing many people to be slightly stunned. This was the first time many people had seen her.

However, her outdated appearance and hot figure had attracted the attention of many people.

“It’s the first time I’ve seen her!”

Wang Xian’s face revealed a hint of bitterness as he spoke to Zhang Fengying.

Damn it, he was framed by this woman. There was really no way to refute it.

The other party’s plan was simply foolproof.

“Fengying, do you know him?”

Jiang Chuan’s expression changed slightly when he saw her walking out, he pretended to be surprised and said, “Fengying, it’s best for you to stay away from such a scumbag and arrogant guy. If he doesn’t apologize to this lady today, I will definitely not let him off!”

As he spoke, he even pretended to be righteous and raised his head as though he was showing off his greatness.

However, Zhang Fengying didn’t even look at him.

“I believe you!”

Zhang Fengying nodded at Wang Xian and looked at the Vixen. After sizing her up, she said to her directly, “His looks are average and his figure is average. He won’t take a fancy to you. You’re the one who lied and framed him!”

“This...”

Jiang Chuan was stunned when he heard Zhang Fengying’s words. He opened his mouth slightly and his face was filled with astonishment.

This...

Everyone around was stunned as well. They didn’t expect this beautiful lady to say such words. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“You... who are you calling average-looking and average-looking? You... He pursued me for a long time and now he abandoned me... you...”

When Hu Mei heard Zhang Fengying say that she was average-looking, she revealed an angry expression. Her face was embarrassed and her body was trembling.

“You are indeed average. He has six wives, and each one of them is completely incomparable to you. There is no need for him to find someone like you!”

“To put it bluntly, you are too ugly and unqualified!”

As Zhang Fengying spoke, she walked to Wang Xian’s side and smiled at him. Following that, she stared at Hu Mei with a cold expression. A hint of coldness flashed in her eyes.

“You are a lady from the Fox clan. The Fox clan’s bloodline is only at the first level of the Seethrough realm. I don’t know why you are framing him. However, if you dare to cause trouble for no reason, be careful of your entire clan!”

As she spoke, a faint pressure emanated from her body.

This was the pressure of a first level Seethrough expert.

“Meow!”

Following that, the ice fire civet cat that was hanging on her clothes jumped onto her shoulder. Its demonic eyes were sparkling.

A murderous aura erupted from its body. This was also the murderous intent of an insightful emptiness realm expert.

The Aura that Zhang Fengying suddenly released shocked everyone around!
