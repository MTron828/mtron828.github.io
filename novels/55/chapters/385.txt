Chapter 386: Sacred Enforcers (2)

“That’s right. No matter who’s at fault in this incident, the one who killed them deserves death. This is to let everyone know the consequences of messing with us, the Sacred Followers Guild!”

Before Yan She could finish his sentence, two old men seated opposite him shouted harshly.

“We will post the image of the corpse of that brat onto the Underworld website and make him the example of the consequences of messing with the Sacred Followers Guild!”

“Send out the Sacred Enforcers! That young man has to be killed. If he had just crippled Elder Feng, we wouldn’t have said a further word. However, since he chose to kill him directly, it is a show of disrespect to our Sacred Followers Guild. We have to let him know the consequences!” Another two old men shouted emotionlessly.

Yan She frowned and looked displeased. He faced the group of Elders and said in a solemn tone, “Let’s report this to the Guild Leader and see what he has in mind before acting!”

“Our Guild Leader went out to sea three days ago and we aren’t sure when he will be back. We can’t possibly be waiting for him forever. Yan She, since you don’t want to be involved in this, shut your mouth. We will lead a few Sacred Enforcers over!”

At this instant, an old man opposite him stood up and chided. He looked across the group opposite of him. “I’ll bring the Sacred Enforcers along with a few Elders. We don’t need your involvement. Tsk!”

As the old man finished his words, he headed for the exit. Five Elders stood up, followed closely behind and left.

Yan She was feeling conflicted. The few other old men around him shook their heads, stood up and left without saying another word.

...

“Brother Wang Xian, this incident has been blown out of proportion!”

The journey from Sky City to Rivertown took six hours. Night had fallen when they arrived back at the villa. The moment they stepped in, they saw Sui Huang sitting on the sofa.

“Is that so? All I did was annihilate a First-class Force!”

Wang Xian looked at Sui Huang before carrying Xiao Yu to the sofa.

Sui Huang took a look at Xiao Yu and shook his head. “Brother Wang Xian, your name has shocked the entire Underworld now. Annihilating the entire Nine Lotus Sect, killing the Elder from the Sacred Followers Guild, the number one demon-like genius on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart... Any single achievement is able to shock the entire Underworld! You are much better than I was when I was young!”

“You are making it sound like you are better than me now!” Wang Xian looked at Sui Huang and made a joke.

Upon hearing Wang Xian, Sui Huang raised an eyebrow and was clearly infuriated. “Brat, do you want to have a fight now? With my experiences, I will easily crush you to the ground!”

“I shall not be calculative with an old man like you. Seeing that night has fallen and you are still here, I believe you aren’t just interested in telling me this, right?” Wang Xian smiled and sat beside Sui Huang.

“What? Am I not welcome?” Sui Huang stared at him and started scrutinizing him from head to toe. He squinted his eyes and commented, “Are your Arts of Refining Elixir Pills really as incredible as the rumors have claimed? You can now refine Level 3 elixir pills easily?”

“I guess so? I’m a demon-like genius and am not someone you can compare with!” Wang Xian chuckled and his lips curved into a smile.

“You...” Sui Huang choked on his words and stared harshly at him. “You are really arrogant. Now that you have killed an Elder from the Sacred Followers Guild, they will definitely not let this go easily.”

“Old Huang isn’t in the Sacred Followers Guild currently, and the matters of the guild are managed by the group of Elders. I believe they will be giving you troubles soon!”

As Sui Huang spoke, he looked to Wang Xian. “I haven’t managed to get in contact with him. When I do, please let this matter rest!”

Huh?

Wang Xian was taken aback by what Sui Huang had said. The Old Huang that he was talking about was most likely the Guild Leader of the Sacred Followers Guild.

“Give me troubles? Tsk!”

Murderous intent gleamed in Wang Xian’s eyes. “This matter isn’t something he could just put to rest on his side!”

Sui Huang sensed the murderous intent in Wang Xian’s eyes. He frowned and asked in a solemn tone, “What are your thoughts then?”

Wang Xian leaned back on the sofa, looked to his side and saw Guan Shuqing chatting with Xiao Yu. Subsequently, he remarked coldly, “If the Sacred Followers Guild has the antidote, this matter could be put to rest. If they don’t, all the families and kin of that Elder Feng will have to die!”

As he spoke, he looked to Sui Huang. “I don’t wish to see an incident like this for a second time!”

Sui Huang felt his heart skip a beat when he met Wang Xian’s eyes. His eyebrows gradually knitted together.

The overly confident young man before him wasn’t his junior. Instead, he was a terrifying expert that could equal him.

As an expert, he would have his pride and bottom line. Clearly, the Elder from Sacred Followers Guild poisoning his sister with lethal venom had completely breached his bottom line.

At this point, it was no longer the issue of whether the Sacred Followers Guild would seek revenge. Instead, it was whether this young man would let this matter slide.

The Elder of the Sacred Followers Guild had poisoned his sister because he was taking revenge for his disciple. This put Wang Xian on the defensive.

Will there be others attacking him once again to seek revenge for that Elder?

As an expert, Wang Xian would never let this happen again. He was going to crush this idea that people might be harboring against him.

In that case, he had to ensure the deaths of all his potential enemies.

This was a very domineering method but was also a method often used by strong experts. Experts wouldn’t let this type of risk linger on.

“Brother Wang Xian, can you hold back and not act at this moment. Within five days, I’ll let Old Huang give you a satisfactory answer!” said Sui Huang as he looked to Wang Xian.

Huh? Wang Xian was stunned for a moment by what Sui Huang said. Subsequently, he nodded his head and answered, “Alright. Since, Old Sui, you have requested this, I shall listen to you this time. Five days. If this isn’t settled in five days, I will go to the Sacred Followers Guild!”

“Alright, five days are enough!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Sui Huang revealed a smile. Five days was enough time for him to contact the Guild Leader of the Sacred Followers Guild.

As long as he explained the situation, Old Huang should know how to handle it.

This matter had started because of an Elder from the Sacred Followers Guild after all.

“Alright, the old man shall leave. Regarding your sister’s situation, I’ll ask some of my old friends and see if they have any solutions. My dear disciple, your master shall be leaving now. We will start on refining elixir pills tomorrow!”

After exchanging some pleasantries with Wang Xian, Sui Huang stood up and headed for the exit with a smile.

After Wang Xian finished his dinner, he returned to his room and looked up the Underworld website on his computer.

Seeing that all the comments were about him or matters related to him, he chuckled nonchalantly.

He could be considered as a rather low profile person, as he would leave some matters for the dragonians to handle. If this incident didn’t concern Xiao Yu, he wouldn’t have acted personally.

However, since he did, so be it. If he became known throughout the Underworld, so be it. As for those comments about him being likely to die young as he was favored by the Gods, he simply chuckled upon seeing them.

It was still not certain who would be dying first.

After Lan Qingyue and Guan Shuqing returned home, Wang Xian continued browsing for some time before getting into the bed. He was pondering about the situation of Xiao Yu and Elder Fang.

I’ll bring them to the Dragon Palace in five days’ time!

Just as Wang Xian was resting, the Underworld was still discussing fervently about what had happened today.

When it was close to 10 pm, a new thread appeared suddenly.

[Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown shall die for killing an Elder from our Sacred Followers Guild!]

It was from the Sacred Followers Guild!
