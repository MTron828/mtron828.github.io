Chapter 3159: 3158 battled for 10 days

“Die!”

When the furious and murderous voices rang out from the Dragon Palace, the terrifying attacks rushed into the battlefield.

The battlefield in front of the Dragon Palace was only a battle between universe knights and below.

If 10 universe knights suddenly rushed out at this time, wouldn’t they be killed?

This wasn’t a simple death.

“Not good, there are universe knights in Dragon Palace.”

“Hiss, Dodge quickly, there are 10 universe knights hiding in Dragon Palace.”

“Dodge, Dodge quickly!”

When they saw the arrow that looked like a dragon, the leaf that looked like a dragon scale, and the Dragon Sword that looked like a dragon…

All the Great Beings of the three races were shocked.

Even the skeleton members, who were not afraid of death, trembled, and the ghost fire in their eyes flashed with fear.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Streams of energy entered the army of the three clans, and in an instant, countless skeletons lost all their vitality.

More than 30,000 members of the nine-sword clan were killed, and 5,000 to 6,000 of them were killed. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The bloodthirsty clan also suffered heavy losses.

“Kill!”

The other disciples of the Dragon Palace were excited when they saw the knight-level members flying over.

They roared and charged forward.

The 10 universe knights had already torn a hole in the ground.

They could charge forward and kill them.

“Kill!”

“Sou Sou Sou!”

The 10 Universe Knights of the Dragon Palace also let out a cold shout. Arrows shot out, and they all rushed over.

“Not good, Knight, save me!”

“Leader, save me!”

Seeing another 10 universe knights appear in the Dragon Palace, the disciples of the three races were shocked.

The power of the Dragon Palace was not weaker than them. Now that 10 Universe Knights had rushed out, what could they use to fight them?

Just 10 universe knights were enough to kill all of them.

“Damn, why are there so many knights in the Dragon Palace!”

“Not good, there are 10 universe knights in the Dragon Palace, our disciples are no match for the Dragon Palace.”

In the sky, the Universe Knights of the three races felt the situation below and opened their eyes wide, shocked.

Another 10 universe knights.

This was 10 universe knights!

The skeleton race didn’t even have 10 universe knights.

Even the bloodthirsty race only had 14 universe knights.

Now, there were 10 universe knights hidden in Dragon Palace.

How could the disciples of their race defend against this?

And no matter how powerful the skeleton race’s trump cards were, they couldn’t have 10 universe knight-level treasures!

“Damn it!”

At this moment, the golden skeleton clan leader looked down and his face darkened.

However, at this moment, the five elements Millstone was attacking him.

The golden skeleton clan leader’s face changed drastically. The destructive five elements power landed on his body, causing the bones on his arm to slowly crack.

He was a little terrified. He was not the Dragon King’s match.

“As expected of the skeleton clan leader. His defense is really terrifying.”

At this moment, Wang Xian’s continuous attacks landed on the body of the golden skeleton clan leader. The powerful attacks only caused a crack to appear on his skeleton body.

If it were any other Level 2 universe knight, they would have been killed by him long ago.

“Five Elements Millstone!”

“I don’t want to waste your time. Go and kill the others.”

Wang Xian waved his arm. The five elements millstone floated around the golden skeleton clan leader and kept attacking him.

The skeleton clan leader’s attack power was average, but his defense was very strong. Even Wang Xian would find it difficult to kill him in a short period of time.

He might as well let the five elements millstone pin him down.

Whoosh

His speed was extremely terrifying. In the next moment, he appeared behind a Level 2 universe knight who was being suppressed by the Heaven Formation. His dragon claws clawed at his body.

“What!”

The Level 2 universe knight from the skeleton race was already being suppressed by the sky formation. Now that Wang Xian had suddenly appeared, his expression changed drastically.

His body suddenly turned into bones as he fled in all directions.

“If you want to escape, die!”

“Great Heaven Annihilation Formation!”

The Sky Formation seized the opportunity and revealed a cold expression. A formation landed directly on the skeleton.

The terrifying power of destruction caused the law power on its body to collapse rapidly.

“Nine mountain suppression!”

A nine-elemental mountain pressed down on the skeleton’s body.

“Leader, save me.”

The Universe Knight level two great being of the skeleton race’s face changed drastically, and he howled shrilly.

“Get lost!”

The golden skeleton leader looked over and rushed over quickly.

“Roar!”

However, at this moment, the five godly dragons raised their heads and spat out dragon breath.

The five Elemental Dragon Breath made the golden skeleton clan leader’s expression change drastically, and he quickly dodged to the side.

“Ah Ah, clan leader, save me!”

At this moment, another scream came from not far away.

The golden skeleton clan leader looked over and his heart sank.

A Universe Knight Level 1 warrior from the bloody race was surrounded by two wind god dragons from the Dragon Palace. His blood-like body was torn apart and filled with fear.

They had fewer knights than the Dragon Palace to begin with, and many of them were fighting one against two.

Fighting one against two at the same level and against a pure-blooded dragon, that was courting death.

“Lord Dragon Skeleton, clan leader, fight together.”

“Retreat to the side of Lord Dragon skeleton and the others!”

The golden skeleton clan leader saw this scene and immediately ordered.

With their current strength, they were no match for the Dragon Palace. There were too many knights in the Dragon Palace.

Their only reliance was that they had two universe knights with level 3 combat power.

“Retreat, Retreat, Retreat!”

The Universe Knights of the three races looked extremely embarrassed and hurriedly retreated into the sky.

Even though the impact of a universe Knight’s Level 3 combat power was too terrifying, they had no choice but to do so.

They weren’t a match for Dragon Palace alone.

On their side, they had already lost four universe knights, and three of them were Level 2 universe knights.

They weren’t a match for Dragon Palace at all.

“This… Dragon Palace is so powerful!”

“Dragon Palace actually has ten universe knights. That’s a total of 40. This is crazy.”

“The three races are no longer a match for Dragon Palace. Now, it’s up to the dragon skeletons and blood dragons of the three races. It’s hard to say who will win!”

“Although the three races have suffered huge losses, they still have one more person with Pinnacle Combat Power.”

“No matter what, this battle can already be recorded in the history of the Milky Way.”

The universe knights watching the battle were shocked.

In this battle, it could be said that godly kings were cannon fodder, and even godly emperors couldn’t survive.

Even knights were dying one after another.

The outcome was unknown!
