“Two at the control level and five at the beginner level!”

Wang Xian read through all the information about the intruders and mumbled.

Two at the control level could be compared to six of the weakest heaven origin creation stage powerhouses.

The remaining five could at least be compared to six to seven of the weakest heaven origin creation stage powerhouses.

If the other party attacked him together, Wang Xian might not be a match for them.

“It seems like it’s the right choice to let the Tiger Roar Mountain not break through. Once they break through, they will definitely be attracted over. When that happens, I won’t be able to defend myself! ”

Wang Xian thought to himself!

Currently, the intruders had already surrounded the center of the mountain range and universe.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

They had used the teleportation formation to connect all the places.

In other words, they were preparing to launch a general attack.

Once they launched a general attack, it would definitely be a devastating blow to the mountain range universe.

The four heaven origin creation stage powerhouses in the mountain range universe would not be a match for them at all.

In the entire mountain range universe, unless the four heaven origin creation stage powerhouses were able to take away a portion of the living beings, the rest would be massacred!

It could be said to be extremely tragic!

Wang Xian left the nest-like war weapon and flew to the side with a thoughtful look on his face.

According to the information he received, the universe that initiated the invasion not only needed blood and food, but it also needed some Powerhouses to make a breakthrough.

As for what kind of attribute the powerhouses had to make a breakthrough, Wang Xian did not receive any specific information.

Overall, the probability of metal attribute was still one-fifth.

This probability was not small.

If there were two disciples who wanted to break through in this invading universe, the probability of needing a metal attribute slot would be increased by another one-fifth.

(‘I can’t wait for the Drobabilitv to be equal. Moreover, if the invading universe really occupies this universe, even if they don’t need a metal attribute slot, they will sell this slot to the powerhouses from the evil sequence faction. ” Wang Xian pondered in his heart.

If he wanted to make huming mountain achieve a breakthrough, he couldn’t let the intruder occupy this universe!

“Perhaps we can cooperate! ”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered slightly. He felt that he could give it a try. Perhaps, he could obtain some benefits as well!

With a plan in mind, Wang Xian moved his body and concealed himself. He flew toward the center of the mountain range universe.

He easily passed through the blockade line of the intruder universe and entered the interior of the mountain range universe.

After flying for a few hours, a huge mountain peak that stretched as far as the eye could see appeared.

It was like a life planet connecting to a Life Planet!

Wang Xian came to the top of these life mountain peaks and could see countless living beings shuttling back and forth.

Most of the living beings ‘eyes were filled with horror.

It was obvious that the invasion of the experts from the evil sequence faction had frightened them and made them feel despair!

However, what could they do?

Escape? Where could they escape to?

Their roots were right here. Where could they escape to?

Countless living beings were filled with sorrow.

At this moment, they could only pray that the four lords from their mountain range and universe would be able to resist the invasion of external enemies!

Wang Xian flew over the mountain peaks and felt the helplessness of the creatures below. He shook his head slightly.

He had truly experienced the cruelty of the calamity!

Wang Xian continued to fly forward and passed through the huge mountain peaks quickly!

Ten days later, he arrived at the core of the mountain range universe.

There were more than ten huge mountain peaks in the sky.

They were emitting an extremely terrifying aura.

These mountain peaks were all forged into war weapons.

The place where the war weapons surrounded was an extremely huge mountain peak.

The mountain peak was incomparable.

The majestic energy within filled the surroundings!

When Wang Xian flew over, he could feel that there were four powerful auras within the mountain peak!

“Indeed, none ot them are at the control level. There are two who are at the beginning to enter level two!”

Wang Xian mumbled. His strength could not be compared to the intruders at all.

If the intruders were to attack them, they would not be able to defend against them.

At this moment, four powerhouses of the Heaven’s origin realm were gathered together.

Their brows were knitted tightly. Their faces were filled with worry and helplessness.

As the strongest powerhouses in the mountain universe, the Saints of the mountain universe!

Now that they were facing the invasion of foreign enemies, there was nothing they could do!

This made them feel a little despair!

“How’s the request for reinforcements from the justice sequence?”

Four figures sat in a hall located at the highest point of an unparalleled mountain peak.

One of them asked solemnly.

“The other side agreed, but their request was too ruthless. They actually want two spots for our mountain universe’s Tianyuan creation and a large amount of resources from us. Sigh! ”

An elder in the heavenly fate realm said helplessly!

“As long as they can come to support us, everything will be given. However,

I’m afraid that we won’t be able to hold on until then! ”

A heavenly fate realm powerhouse in the center said with a helpless expression!

Justice Sequence Alliance.

They were one of them!

With the arrival of the calamity, they huddled together.

However, if the members of the Justice Sequence Alliance were to encounter danger and wanted to ask for help…

They would have to pay a price!

The enemies that the mountain universe had encountered this time were too powerful!

This would require at least seven or eight ordinary heaven origin creation realm experts.

Or they could invite powerful Great Dao realm experts over to help.

However, inviting so many experts, or such powerful experts, the price was too great!

Not only did they need resources, they also needed two heaven origin creation realm experts.

To them, the price was very heavy.

But even if it was heavy, they had to ask for help.

Right now, what they were worried about was that their mountain range universe would not be able to hold on before the reinforcements arrived!

At that time, if they wanted to take back the universe, the price they had to pay would be even greater.

And for the reinforcements to arrive, they would need at least a thousand years.

A Thousand Years!

The four Heaven’s origin creation realm powerhouses suddenly fell silent. They leaned on their seats and felt helpless!

Buzz

At this moment, Wang Xian, who was outside, happened to hear their conversation.

This caused Wang Xian to squint his eyes slightly.

He moved his body and headed straight into the hall!

Wang Xian entered the hall. The four Heaven’s origin creation realm powerhouses were slightly stunned. Then, they looked in a direction. They were too close to him and could sense Wang Xian’s aura.

Wang Xian looked at them and slowly revealed his figure!

When the four Heaven’s origin powerhouses saw Wang Xian’s figure, they were instantly horrified.

A person had entered their area and they only realized it when they were so close to him!

This? ?

Boom

The four Heaven’s origin powerhouses in the mountain universe instantly erupted with a terrifying aura as they locked their eyes on Wang Xian.

“Everyone, don’t be afraid. I’m not an intruder from your mountain universe.

I’m here to make a deal with all of you! ”

Wang Xian saw their vigilant expressions and spoke with a smile on his face!
