“Hehe! ”

Prime Minister Gui saw this scene and heard the exclamations around him. His face revealed a look of excitement!

Over the past few days, all the powerful disciples of the Dragon Palace had seen all the information on the communication stone plate.

However, Prime Minister Gui did not make any statement without Wang Xian’s order.

What he said just now was to let all the peak races know how much the Dragon Palace had sacrificed in the war between the nine-origin universe and the belief universe!

Now, he saw the army of the belief universe escaping because of the Dragon King.

He was also full of smiles.

Prime Minister Gui had a very clear understanding of Wang Xian’s situation.

He also knew that their Dragon King had already broken through. Their Dragon Queen, the ancient god Feed Kun master, had already made a breakthrough!

With the Dragon Queen’s breakthrough, all the gods surrounding the Dragon King were killed.

The news of the Dragon Queen’s breakthrough also spread to the belief universe.

Therefore, the experts of the belief universe were somewhat afraid!

This caused the army of the belief universe to immediately retreat!

“Prime Minister Gui, do you know some information? What exactly happened?”

Over at the skeleton clan, a skeleton king couldn’t help but ask when he heard Prime Minister Gui’s laughter!

Now, he was too curious!

He was curious about what had happened to the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.

What kind of situation could cause the army of the belief universe to retreat!

Hearing the skeleton clan’s words, the other experts from the peak races all turned their eyes to Prime Minister Gui.

“I know the specific situation, but I think our Dragon King has escaped the blockade of the belief universe.”

Prime Minister Gui replied with a smile.

All the powerful beings of the peak races twitched their lips when they heard his words.

Was it that simple for the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace to escape the blockade of the powerful beings of the belief universe?

To be able to make the army of the belief universe so frightened and escape directly after escaping the blockade?

Who would believe that?

“However, there is one thing that our Dragon Palace wants to make clear today. A few days ago, more than a dozen disciples of our Dragon Palace were killed. Our Dragon King also knew about this news, but our Dragon Palace didn’t make any noise! ”

Prime Minister Gui suddenly changed the topic. His eyes swept across the peak races and the powerful disciples of all the races.

Finally, it landed on the Phoenix clan!

“Firstly, according to the Phoenix clan, the disciples of the Dragon Palace were killed because they stole their treasures. Now, the Dragon Palace is prepared to pay a huge price to resurrect the dead disciples. After the resurrection, the Dragon Palace will find out the truth of the matter. If the disciples of the

Dragon Palace were in the wrong, the Dragon Palace will admit their mistake! ”

“If it’s not our Dragon Palace’s fault, then as an old minister, I don’t know how our Dragon King will deal with this matter, Hehe. ” Prime Minister Gui smiled faintly at the end of his speech.

As for how the Dragon King would deal with it?

The entire nine-origin universe knew the Dragon King’s style of doing things.

He had led the Dragon Palace all the way here.

Who cares what high-level race you are, kill!

Who cares if you have a peak race backing you, Kill!

Who cares if you are invincible in the invincible region, kill!

Who cares if you are a peak race expert, kill!

Over the past tens of millions of years, the disciples of the nine-origin universe all understood the Dragon Palace’s style of doing things.

Over the past tens of millions of years, the Dragon Palace had never provoked any power, and even suppressed the other high-level races.

The situation of the Dragon Palace was that if someone didn’t offend them, they wouldn’t offend them!

However, if someone offended the dragon palace, then with the style of the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, the person who offended them would definitely have to pay a terrible price!

Prime Minister Gui didn’t finish speaking, but everyone knew what the consequences were!

When all the powerful disciples of the Phoenix clan heard Prime Minister Gui’s words, their faces instantly turned extremely ugly!

Their faces were all volatile!

Especially those experts of the Phoenix clan who knew the truth, their faces were even more unsightly!

“This… This declaration of the Dragon Palace is so domineering. I wonder what the truth is this time?”

“I don’t know. In any case, the current strength of the Dragon Palace is absolutely not afraid of any of the peak races. If there really is a force deliberately provoking us, then we will have to pay a terrible price this time! ”

“I have become a hardcore fan of the Dragon King. I support whatever the Dragon King does! ”

At the back, some powerful disciples of the high-level races couldn’t help but whisper.

They didn’t dare to say it out loud because the Phoenix clan was also there.

However, many powerful disciples focused their eyes on the Phoenix clan.

Their gazes were a little strange!

“In short, take care of yourself. No one can bully our Dragon Palace!”

Prime Minister Gui added indifferently, cupped his hands toward the other peak races, and left!

The experts of the other peak races looked at each other and glanced at the Phoenix clan.

They could guess the truth from the expressions of some of the experts of the Phoenix clan.

This time, it was most likely the Phoenix clan who deliberately provoked them first!

(‘We don’t need to worry. Even if that Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is very strong, he at most has the strength of a peak ruler. Our Phoenix Clan has already contacted a space beast race in the starry universe. With their help, we will be fine! ”

A Level 7 ruler of the Phoenix Clan had an ugly expression as he transmitted his voice to the clansmen beside him.

When the clansmen heard this, their expressions relaxed a little.

“That’s right, we don’t need to worry. As long as that expert from the Space Beast Race Comes, we won’t be afraid of the Dragon King! ”

A Level 7 sovereign water phoenix nodded heavily.

They firmly believed!

This was their only hope.

After all, the Dragon King’s power this time had completely scared them!

Even the entire belief universe was afraid of the Dragon King. So what if they were a phoenix clan?

Wang Xian didn ‘t know about the situation at the starry giant city.

He didn’t know either. Although he didn’t come, he pretended to be awesome!

He had become the great hero in the hearts of all the strong disciples in the nine-origin Universe!

At this moment, he was standing on Xiao Lan’s body, chasing after the starfield fragment crazily. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

It was the lock fragment of an ultimate treasure of Tianyuan grade!

He wanted to obtain it!

Even if the chance was slim, he wanted to do his best to fight for it!

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

Xiao Lan and Lan Qingyue’s powers were entangled on the starfield fragment.

However, although Xiao Lan and Lan Qingyue’s powers were strong, the power of the Starfield fragment to break free was also very terrifying!

“Are you confident?”

Wang Xian looked at the galactic fragment in front of him that was struggling to break free and asked Lan Qingyue.

“I’m not confident! ”

Lan Qingyue replied with a solemn expression!

“It’s very likely that a heaven’s fate level powerhouse has placed a restriction on it to prevent it from being lost. ” Wang Xian was indignant!
