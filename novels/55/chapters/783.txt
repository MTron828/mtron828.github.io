Chapter 784: 0785 continued to fight

Translator: 549690339

“Hiss!”

Seeing Hua Gujiang squatting on the ground, all the immortal sects were shocked.

A complete defeat!

A complete defeat!

A complete crushing!

“My God, it’s unbelievable!”

“I...”

The entire arena was silent. Everyone had no idea what to say!

Everyone stared at the arena with their mouths Agape.

The Immortals and deities of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect were slightly trembling. Their eyes were slightly red as they stared at the arena below.

Nine young prodigies and nine nascent realm cultivators.

Although the deaths of nine nascent realm cultivators couldn’t hurt them at all, they were the most outstanding disciples of this generation.

Especially on the arena. They were instantly killed by the Dragon Gate in front of everyone’s eyes. To the two immortal sects of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Holy Medicine, this was simply a slap in the face!

“Clap, clap, Clap!”

At this moment, on the arena, ten golden swordfish slowly walked toward Hua Gujiang, who was surrounded by green energy. Their eyes were filled with cold killing intent.

“It’s a battle of life and death. They are going to kill Hua Gujiang!”

“The defense on Hua Gujiang’s body can withstand the full-force attack of an immortal God. It’s very difficult to break through it!”

“Hua Gujiang is the future immortal god that the two immortal sects, Holy Medicine and holy medicine, are most focused on nurturing. How can the two immortal sects just watch him be killed?”

The surrounding disciples of the Holy Medicine sect looked at the group of golden swordfish that were walking over and started discussing softly.

The group of Immortal Gods from the Holy Medicine sect and the Holy Medicine sect also looked at him with an awkward expression.

“Phew!”

The green-robed elder took a deep breath and looked at Wang Xian. “We, the Holy Medicine sect and the Holy Medicine Sect, admit defeat!”

“We admit defeat!”

“Even if we don’t admit defeat, we have already lost. The Holy Medicine sect and the Holy Medicine sect are completely defeated. This is really out of everyone’s expectations!”

When everyone around heard this, they muttered to themselves.

“How can we admit defeat in a life-and-death battle?”

Wang Xian stared at them with an expressionless face and said in a mocking tone.

“Dragon King, we will give up after killing nine of our outstanding disciples. The competition is over!”

The green-robed elder said in a low voice with an embarrassed expression.

“There’s still one more. It will be over soon!”

Wang Xian revealed a smile as he looked down calmly.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

As if they were responding to Wang Xian, ten golden swordfish raised the golden longswords in their hands and slashed at Hua Gujiang’s rain shield.

“Dragon King, don’t go too far. I’m Warning You!”

A cold light shot out from the green-robed Elder’s eyes as he pointed at Wang Xian.

“Haha, since you dare to fight to the death, let’s fight to the death. If you don’t Dare, why are you spouting nonsense? Is this the immortal sect that has been passed down for thousands of years? Today, so what if I, the Dragon Sect, kill the two disciples of Your Immortal Sect?”

Wang Xian laughed out loud and stared at the green-robed elder with a cold expression. He did not show any signs of weakness.

So what if he killed him?

When he said this, everyone was shocked.

“Dragon King is indeed the Dragon King. If you dare to provoke him, you will have to pay a heavy price!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

All the immortal sect disciples and even the immortal gods stared at Wang Xian with flickering eyes.

The Grand Elder and Sect Master of the Hunyuan Immortal sect had initially wanted to take revenge. Now that they saw how domineering Wang Xian was, their expressions kept changing.

They were considering whether they should make an enemy out of this kind of person.

“Haha, Good, good. Dragon King, very good. Today, Our Holy Medicine Holy Doctor Celestial sect will remember that we have a long future ahead of us. Just as you said, in the near future, there will only be one between us!”

The eyes of the green-robed elder were filled with frost. His cold killing intent was not concealed at all.

“Repeating what I said is very boring!”

Wang Xian stared at the green-robed elder without showing any signs of weakness.

“No, no!”

Hua Gujiang’s terrified voice was heard from the arena below.

Everyone quickly looked over. At this moment, the defense on Hua Gujiang’s body was actually showing signs of cracking.

Under the continuous attacks of five half-step immortal gods and five infant stage powerhouses, the terrifying defensive power was actually slowly cracking.

Hua Gujiang, who was on the arena, revealed a look of fear in his eyes.

He might not feel fear after being killed in an instant, but now that he was slowly walking towards death, this was even more terrifying.

The Immortal Gods of the Holy Medicine and Holy Medicine sect looked over, their eyes extremely cold.

“I’ll definitely make you pay back tenfold for today’s matter!”

The sect leaders of the two great immortal sects said with a cold expression.

“Ah!”

A blood-curdling scream represented the end of the life and death battle between the Dragon Sect and the Holy Medicine and Holy Medicine sect.

Ten of the most outstanding disciples of the Holy Doctor and Holy Medicine sect were killed.

Hua Gujiang, who had a high chance of obtaining the first place in this competition, was killed!

Everyone could hear the conversation between the two immortal sects and the Dragon King clearly. This made everyone have a premonition that the Dragon sect and the two immortal sects would become enemies completely.

It was to the extent that they were going to kill each other!

This made all the disciples of the immortal sects feel the confidence and fearlessness of the Dragon King. So what if he challenged the two immortal sects?

“Leave one of the strongest ones behind!”

At this moment, Wang Xian’s voice reverberated through the entire battleground once again.

All the disciples and immortals of the celestial sect were slightly shocked. They looked at Wang Xian in astonishment.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

On the stage, the nine golden swordfish nodded their heads. Their bodies moved and they flew toward the stage of the Dragon Gate.

“Please give us your instructions, Dragon King!”

The last Golden Swordfish asked Wang Xian respectfully.

“Continue, Fight!”

Wang Xian looked in the direction of the Yuwen clan expressionlessly and said indifferently, “Let’s begin. Let’s see if the Dragon Gate disciple dies or if you die!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The Golden Swordfish accepted the challenge. With a wave of its arm, it pointed in the direction of the Yuwen clan. Its face was cold and emotionless. With a resounding voice, it said, “Come and fight. You Die, or I Die!”

You Die, or I Die!

The emotionless voice resounded throughout the entire battleground. The long sword of the Dragon Gate disciple pointed straight at the Yuwen clan.

Just like not long ago, the Yuwen clan’s Yuwen Hua pointed his weapon straight at the Yuwen clan and challenged them to a battle.

However, this time, it was the Dragon Gate’s side.

Moreover, it was a battle that would not end until one of them died.

A half-step immortal God inviting another half-step immortal God to a battle that would not end until one of them died. It had to be said that this was an extremely terrifying thing.

No half-step immortal God dared to invite another half-step immortal god of the same level down the arena to fight to the death.

No one wanted to die!

But now, the half-step immortal God disciple of the Dragon Gate had directly invited Yuwen Hua of the Yuwen clan to fight.

Everyone couldn’t help but suck in a breath of cold air.

They didn’t expect that after the disciple of the Dragon King killed the Holy Doctor and holy medicine disciple, he would really kill Yuwen Hua again as he said!

Doing so would undoubtedly anger the Yuwen clan.

But the Dragon King was still the Dragon King, a strong enemy. So what?

At this time, Yu Wenhua, who was on the Yuwen clan’s stage, saw the golden swordfish pointing straight at him. Hearing his words, his face changed slightly and his pupils could not help but shrink.

Not only Yu Wenhua, but all the disciples of the Yuwen clan, as well as the immortals and gods, also changed their faces.
