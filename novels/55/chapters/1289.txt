Chapter 1290: 1291 ling Jian ‘ER’s invitation letter

Two hundred thousand spiritual liquid was not a small amount.

If converted to spiritual stones, it would be at least a trillion.

He had obtained the title of the supreme prodigy, and the amount of dragon crystals he obtained was only over two hundred million.

The one hundred thousand spiritual liquid he obtained just now, together with the two hundred thousand spiritual liquid, was equivalent to over two hundred million dragon crystals.

Even though he yuan had an extraordinary status, he could not take out so much spiritual liquid at once.

Furthermore, he had already lost 100,000 spiritual liquid to Wang Xian.

“Aren’t you trying to scam me?”

He Yuan couldn’t help but shout at Wang Xian with a furious expression.

“It’s a little expensive. Let’s take 100,000 spiritual liquid then!”

Wang Xian also felt that the price he wanted was a little too high. He lowered the price by 100,000 with a smile on his face.

“HMPH, that’s more like it!”

He Yuan snorted coldly and immediately looked at his interspatial ring. However, his expression quickly turned stiff.

“I have no more spiritual liquid here. I only have 10,000 essence blood. I’ll give you the rest of the spiritual liquid in two days!”

He Yuan took out a porcelain bottle and gestured at him.

“Alright, I feel that you, as a young master, will not go back on your word!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and threw the Beast Tamer technique that he obtained from old man Bai Xun directly to him.

The Beast Tamer technique was not of much use to Wang Xian. Moreover, it was definitely worth it to exchange for 100,000 spiritual liquid!

“HMM?”

He Yuan looked at the secret manual that Wang Xian threw to him with some surprise. He took a glance at it.

His impression of Wang Xian had changed a lot.

“Alright, I, he yuan, will naturally not do such a despicable thing. Tell me a place and I will get someone to send it over!”

He Yuan raised his head slightly and said to Wang Xian.

“Alright, you can get someone to send it directly to the island of the Guanglong Dynasty!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“It will definitely be delivered within three days!”

He Yuan promised.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian responded and looked at long Xiaotian.

“Brother Wang Xian, let’s go back now. We can go back first, Hehe!”

Long Xiaotian looked at the first level void interpretation realm dodo bird beside Wang Xian and a dozen other half-step void interpretation realm dodos. His eyes lit up as he spoke.

“Alright, let’s go back!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile. He knew that Long Xiaotian couldn’t wait to go back and tame them.

Furthermore, with the dozen of half-step void interpretation realm dodos, the influence of his subordinates had almost doubled.

“Let’s go back!”

Long Xiaotian shouted and glanced at he yuan and the others with a red face.

“Let’s Go!”

Long Xiaotian and the others also shouted at their mounts with excitement.

“Huh?”

“Brother he, are you going back too?”

When they returned and saw he yuan and the others in the same direction, Long Xiaotian hesitated and asked.

“Let’s go back!”

He Yuan looked at Long Xiaotian, who still appeared a little arrogant.

However, he looked at Wang Xian curiously and said, “This person, I wonder which family you come from. How can you be so strong?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“I come from a small country. My strength isn’t that strong. At the very least, I can’t be compared to the Supreme Heaven’s favorites here!”

Wang Xian said indifferently, praising himself in a disguised manner.

“Nameless Sword Demon, is it? I’ve heard of this person before. To be able to defeat a demonic beast of the second level of the Seethrough realm easily, and he’s only 26 years old, he’s indeed very heaven-defying!”

As he yuan spoke, he frowned slightly.

He was one of the top heaven’s favorites in the vast region. However, to come to this small place and have two contemporaries who were stronger than him, this made him feel a little uncomfortable.

“This brother’s strength is also very powerful. He has three insightful void-level fierce beasts and more than twenty half-step insightful void-level fierce beasts under him. Among his contemporaries, there are few who can match him!”

Long Xiaotian said with a smile.

“These are just some of my pets. At home, I still have three insightful void-level pets. If I bring all of them here, I Won’t lose our competition!”

When he yuan heard Long Xiaotian’s praise, he raised his head in enjoyment and said.

“Three more? That’s impressive!”

Long Xiaotian’s eyes were filled with astonishment. He didn’t flatter him.

To have six pets at the first level of the insightful void tier at such a young age was indeed heaven-defying.

He Yuan smiled and his face was filled with pride. “In the future, I want to build a strong pet army. An army that is even more powerful than the old man Bai Xun!”

“Is the old man of Bai Xun very famous in the vast region?”

Wang Xian asked he yuan curiously.

“Famous, of course he is famous. More than a hundred years ago, the old man of Bai Xun had five pets at the peak of the sixth level of the Seethrough realm. Don’t you think they are powerful?”

“There are more than a hundred pets above the Seethrough realm. Their strength is simply heaven-defying. However, they were too arrogant and provoked...”

He Yuan began to explain to Wang Xian about the deeds of the Hundred Patrol Masters.

During the rest of the journey, Wang Xian, Long Xiaotian, and he yuan started to chat.

He Yuan came from a vast region, so he was naturally more knowledgeable.

As the Prince of the Light Dragon Dynasty, Long Xiaotian was also very knowledgeable.

Wang Xian was considered to be the least knowledgeable among the three of them.

However, Wang Xian was the strongest. Long Xiaotian was close to him, so he yuan was obviously superior to Long Xiaotian.

When the young men of the Yan clan saw young master he conversing with the second Prince of the Guanglong dynasty and the young man who defeated young master he, they were slightly envious.

They were not on equal terms with young master he at all.

Perhaps, only long Xiaotian, who had a high chance of inheriting the throne, and the young man who defeated young master he were qualified to have a normal conversation with him.

The two middle-aged men behind him saw he yuan conversing with him and were more supportive.

He Yuan came out to train mainly to train his heart.

“Brother he yuan? How long have you been in the transvestite graveyard?”

Long Xiaotian asked he yuan as they walked out of the blood refinement ground.

“I’ve only been here for half a month, and I’ve spent most of my time in the blood refinement ground. I need to rest well for the next few days!”

He Yuan replied to Long Xiaotian.

“Oh? Then, brother he yuan, if you want to take a stroll around the tomb of the demi-human, you can come and look for us. I’m the host here. I’ll bring you around to have some fun!”

Long Xiaotian looked at Wang Xian and said with a smile.

Wang Xian nodded his head in agreement at the side.

“HMM, sure. Of course, there’s no problem. Let’s do it tomorrow. I’ll deliver the rest of the spiritual liquid to brother Wang Xian tomorrow morning!”

He Yuan also revealed a smile and nodded his head.

“Haha, Alright, Alright, Alright. How about brother Wang Xian? There are still a lot of fun to be had in the human-demon graveyard!”

Long Xiaotian laughed out loud and looked at Wang Xian.

“Sure!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

Apparently, Long Xiaotian also wanted to befriend someone with a deep background like young master he. Wang Xian didn’t have much to do recently.

The three of them agreed on a time. When they arrived at the edge of the tomb of the demi-human, they separated from he yuan and the rest.

Wang Xian followed long Xiaotian to the island of the Guanglong dynasty and tamed the ferocious beast.

Then, he returned to his own residence.

“Eh? This Is?”

When he returned to his room, he was slightly stunned when he saw an invitation card on the table in the courtyard.
