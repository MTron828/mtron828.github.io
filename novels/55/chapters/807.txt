Translator: 549690339

“Roar, Roar, Roar!”

Nine whistling sounds rang out.

While the Immortal Gods of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect were filled with fighting spirit, the disciples of the two immortal sects were filled with fighting spirit and vowed to exterminate the dragon sect.

While the disciples and family members of the two immortal sects were filled with excitement in the holy city.

Just as they were about to set off for battle.

Nine terrifying roars rang out. The voices were filled with violence, coldness, and brutality.

In an instant, the entire world seemed to shake.

The eyes of the immortal gods and the experts from the immortal sects who were gathered around to watch the battle suddenly narrowed.

Everyone looked toward the east with shocked expressions.

“This is?”

“Heavens, this... this...”

The infant realm experts and the few hidden immortal gods suddenly revealed shocked expressions. Their bodies couldn’t help but tremble in the air.

In the sky above the Eastern Gate of the Holy Medicine Immortal sect, nine roars caused the expressions of the people from the two immortal sects to change slightly.

Their gazes flickered as they looked ahead.

However, because the voices were too far away, they couldn’t see clearly at all.

However, in the next second, nine terrifying behemoths suddenly appeared in everyone’s line of sight.

Nine green-colored behemoths with two horns on their heads, their bodies reaching a terrifying size of around 20 meters.

Their bodies were three meters wide and their scales were the size of a human head. They contained a terrifying wind attribute energy.

They had a ferocious head and their green eyes were filled with coldness.

The nine terrifying creatures emitted a desolate aura.

Just their aura was definitely not something that an ordinary immortal could compare to.

When they saw the appearance of the nine terrifying creatures, everyone’s expression changed.

“There’s still someone up there!”

Right at this moment, an infant stage expert from the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect couldn’t help but swallow a mouthful of saliva as he spoke loudly.

There was someone up there!

Ten figures, a total of ten figures stood on top.

One was a devil monkey that held a metal rod.

One was an old man that carried a turtle shell on his back.

One was a prawn that was covered in golden light and possessed two huge pincers.

A beautiful woman with a blue shell on her back.

A prawn covered in terrifying lightning had a thunder hammer in one hand and a thunder spear in the other.

A middle-aged swordsman with a long sword in his hand.

However, a man and a woman stood in the middle of the nine terrifying creatures.

The man was naturally the Dragon King of Dragon Gate, while the woman was the Dragon King’s girlfriend.

They stood on each of the nine terrifying bodies, and a terrifying energy was emitted from their bodies.

Every force made the lower-level immortal’s heart palpitate, especially the aura emitted by the Central Dragon King. It was terrifying.

“Seventeen Immortal Gods? Oh My God, it’s actually seventeen immortal gods!”

“That’s not right. There should be another immortal God who is good at hiding in the void. According to the matter of the Strange Thorn clan, there’s a white shadow who is also an immortal God who is good at hiding!”

“That means there are eighteen of them. There are actually so many strange immortal gods among them. The ferocious aura on their bodies is completely incomparable to that of an ordinary immortal God!”

Everyone looked at the Dragon King and the rest in astonishment.

The scene in front of them was too unbelievable. Each and every one of them was a special immortal God who was awe-inspiring to the Holy Doctor, Holy Medicine, and Immortal sect.

“Master pledge ceremony? Not bad. However, there’s no need for you to look for the Dragon sect. I have personally brought people here!”

Wang Xian looked down at everyone from the two immortal gates of medicine and holy medicine and said faintly.

Boom

When he finished speaking, an invincible pressure was emitted.

Roar

Ao qitian, who was at the side, followed Hui directly. No, he should be called a flood dragon at this moment. Although it was only a young flood dragon, it was still terrifying enough.

Ao Qitian roared loudly and his body turned into about eight meters. He held the sea-pacifying divine needle in his hand and the pressure also covered him.

“Crackle! Crackle!”

The sound of thunder and lightning resounded through the void. A bolt of lightning landed directly on Ao Qi’s body. Like a god of thunder, he flew to the side from the body of the flood dragon.

“Anyone who provokes the Dragon Palace, Kill!”

Prime Minister GUI jumped lightly and stared coldly at all the people in front of him, releasing their mighty pressure.

The mighty pressure of all the immortal gods of the members of the Dragon Palace covered the sky and covered the earth.

“Retreat!”

The aura of nearly twenty immortal gods caused the expressions of some experts in the surrounding ten kilometers to change drastically, and they retreated again.

“The Holy Doctor Holy Medicine Immortal sect asked the Dragon King to send over an immortal God for them to kill and then pay a sum of resources as the price for not destroying the Dragon sect. But now, before they set off, the Dragon King has led a group of immortal gods here. This power is too powerful!”

Too powerful, simply too powerful!

This was the most terrifying power they had ever seen.

“How is this possible!”

All the disciples of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect were completely dumbfounded, cold sweat slowly appearing on their foreheads.

The fighting spirit and killing intent from just now had completely disappeared, and they looked forward in horror.

Seventeen immortal gods, a total of seventeen, five more than them.

What frightened them the most was that there were only a few of these seventeen celestials and humans. The rest were all terrifying monsters.

Their auras were extremely violent!

“Dragon King of the Dragon Gate!”

Bian Jiangtu’s expression was extremely ugly. He took a deep breath and stared at Wang Xian with a serious expression as he growled in a low voice.

“I am the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian stared at Bian Jiangtu indifferently and opened his mouth slightly.

Three Dragon Balls appeared in his mouth. Each of the Dragon Balls contained a terrifying energy.

The dragon balls floated above his head. He raised his head slightly and shouted, “Let’s fight. Today, I want to see who will be the one to destroy who!”

“Supreme, their strength is so strong, so strong!”

A celestial god revealed a look of fear in his eyes. He looked at the Dragon King and the rest who were filled with killing intent. His eyes sparkled.

He was afraid!

If they really fought, their side would obviously be at a disadvantage!

Bian Jiangtu’s expression kept changing. The Dragon King’s strength was comparable to his, and every other creature was much stronger than a lower immortal!

They really weren’t a match for him.

However, his expression quickly changed, and he took a deep breath. “I didn’t Expect Your Dragon Palace to be so powerful. The past grudges are over, and we won’t interfere in each other’s business in the future!”

Bian Jiangtu’s voice reverberated in the surroundings, causing the faces of all the disciples of the two immortal sects to freeze. However, they lowered their heads slowly. This was the best choice.

“Hehe, it’s a little too late to reconcile now!”

Wang Xian revealed a hint of mockery on his face.

“What do you want, Dragon King? Don’t go too far. Even if you guys are stronger than us, there will still be immortals among you if you really fight!” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Bian Jiangtu shouted at Wang Xian with a cold expression.

“You want to reconcile? You want to negotiate terms!”

Upon hearing the voice, everyone who was staring at them from afar held their breaths and stared at them with burning eyes.

“Haha, What Do I Want? I want to destroy all of you!”
