2882 The 2,882 divine dragons were on their way

“Saint Lord, I want to build a legacy teleportation formation at the edge of the Holy Region. We can give the Dragon Palace a planet, a barren planet with an ocean.”

In the Holy Mother Tower, Wang Xian spoke after chatting with the Saint Lord and the rest for more than half an hour.

This was also one of the reasons why he came here.

“A long-distance teleportation formation? The Dragon Palace can build such a long-distance teleportation formation?”

The Saint Lord asked in surprise.

“Sure. I want to build a teleportation formation near the heaven’s punishment ancient heaven’s domain in the Saint Land. It will be much easier to go to the barren lands in the future.”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Of course, we can do such a small matter. We can go over now and find a planet for you to use to set up the formation.”

The Saint Lord replied with a smile and stood up.

“Thank you very much.”

Wang Xian cupped his hands.

“Dragon King, follow me. We will go through the teleportation array here.”

As the Saint Lord spoke, he waved the scepter in his hand and led Wang Xian and the rest down.

“This is our strategic teleportation array in the holy region. We can reach most of the planets directly.”

A Holy Emperor of the Holy Region said with a smile on his face.

Wang Xian nodded slightly.

“We can reach the edge of this place.”

The holy master waved the scepter in his hand and pointed at a location.

Under their bodies, the formation began to light up.

The next moment, they appeared in an empty space in a palace.

“Greetings to the Holy Master and the few Celestial Emperors.”

When the soldiers guarding this place saw the arrival of the Holy Master and the rest, they showed a respectful expression and immediately knelt down.

The Saint Lord nodded his head faintly. He looked at Wang Xian beside him and said, “I remember there is a planet nearby. There are no humans living on it, but there are quite a number of desolate beasts.”

“Thank you, Saint Lord. I’ll get my subordinates to search for them.”

Wang Xian cupped his hands at him and gestured to the six wind divine dragons beside him.

“Roar!”

The six wind god Dragons moved and immediately flew into the sky.

At the same time, they let out a low roar.

“Boom!”

A terrifying draconic aura rushed out from their bodies. The six wind god Dragons spread their dragon wings and flew toward the surrounding starry sky.

“What is this?”

When the six wind god Dragons showed themselves and the mighty draconic aura filled the world, the divine lords and the other divine emperors were slightly shocked. They stared at the figure of the wind god Dragons with their eyes wide open.

“D * mn, what… What is this? What is this?”

Invincible battle technique rubbed his eyes and roared in shock.

“Divine Dragon, the legendary divine dragon, Hiss!”

The holy master’s body trembled and his face was filled with shock.

The Divine Dragon was an existence at the pinnacle of the universe. It was the legendary race of the Heaven and earth. It was powerful and invincible.

“This is the Divine Wind Dragon!”

Wang Xian stood at the side and said faintly.

“No Way, boss Wang. There’s actually a divine dragon in the Dragon Palace. Is this a purebred divine dragon? Is this a purebred divine wind dragon?”

“I… I, invincible in battle techniques, actually saw a divine dragon?”

Invincible in battle techniques roared in disbelief. His eyes were filled with passion.

The expressions of the godly monarchs of the holy region kept changing. They looked at the six divine wind dragons with reverence.

They also looked at the Dragon King with respect.

The Dragon Palace had a divine dragon!

If the others in the starry sky knew about this, they would definitely be able to cause the entire starry sky to boil.

The legendary Divine Dragon was an existence at the pinnacle of the universe.

Such an existence could stand at the pinnacle of the universe as long as they were given sufficient resources and time.

This was not the peak of the starry sky, but the peak of the universe.

Everyone was extremely shocked.

After witnessing the terrifying strength of the Dragon King, they were already extremely shocked. However, the six wind god Dragons that the Dragon Palace displayed made their hearts churn even more.

This was no longer something that could be described as shocking.

The dragon swimming in the shallow beach was only so-so.

“Dragon King, over here!”

Soon, the voice of a divine wind dragon was heard.

Wang Xian looked over and appeared in the void instantly.

Below, the Saint Lord and the rest were still standing there in a daze.

“Dragon Palace, Divine Dragon, Dragon King!”

The divine emperor of Shangshui muttered.

“Rumor has it that the rise of the Dragon Palace only took a few years. They defeated the imperial court within a few years. Could it be that the Dragon King has obtained the inheritance of the Divine Dragon?”

One of the Divine Emperors of the Holy Region opened his mouth slightly and asked.

“The inheritance of the Divine Dragon?”

Everyone’s body trembled.

The inheritance of the divine dragon was the inheritance of the pinnacle of the universe.

Since the destruction of the Divine Dragon clan a few hundred million years ago, there was very little information about the divine dragon.

However, there was no doubt that the inheritance of the divine dragon was heaven-defying.

“Let’s go over!”

The Saint Lord of the Holy Region pursed his lips and looked at Wang Xian with respect.

Regardless of anything else, just the six wind god Dragons displayed by the Dragon Palace was an existence that they had to look up to in the future.

Even if these six wind god dragons were not purebred divine dragons, they could still become an existence that they could not contend against.

“Divine dragons, they are actually Divine Dragons!”

Ye Lui Ying and the rest of the senior brothers and sisters said in a daze.

“Hahaha, no wonder the Dragon King improved so quickly. When we first met, he only had the strength of a divine lord. Now, he has become a divine emperor in less than ten years!”

“I’m going to be invincible in battle techniques, I’m going to be completely invincible!”

On the side, invincible in battle techniques was dancing with excitement.

The Dragon Palace had a divine dragon. In the future, as long as he clung onto the Dragon King’s thigh, he would be invincible in battle techniques and be able to roam the starry sky. No one would dare to provoke him.

“Hahaha!”

Thinking of this, he could not help but laugh maniacally.

However, at the side, Divine Emperor Shangshui and the other divine emperors felt a slight chill in their hearts.

A few years ago, he was still a divine master, but now, he was a divine emperor?

This was simply defying the heavens.

In a few more years, wouldn’t he reach an even higher level.

They could not help but swallow a mouthful of saliva. In their hearts, they could not help but mourn for the eight barrens of the Witch Association’s Imperial Court. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

They had provoked the Dragon Palace which possessed the inheritance of the divine dragon. They were prepared to die.

More than ten people moved and flew towards that planet.

“This, this, this…”

At this moment, the soldiers of the Holy Region who were guarding this teleportation formation widened their eyes. They looked at each other and could feel the deep shock from it.

The Dragon Palace was actually this terrifying?

At this moment, Wang Xian had already entered the ocean of the planet and started to build the Dragon Palace.

The speed of building the Dragon Palace with the system was very fast. However, in the eyes of the Saint Lord and the rest, this was the power of the Divine Dragon.

“Alright, we can reach the main dragon palace directly from here. I wonder if everyone is interested in visiting the imperial star field.”

After the construction of the Dragon Palace was completed, Wang Xian invited them with a smile on his face.

“In that case, we shall accept your invitation!”

The eyes of the Holy Lord and the rest sparkled. They looked at each other and nodded with anticipation.
