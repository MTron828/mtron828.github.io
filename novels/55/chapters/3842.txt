3843 3842. Ten palaces working together to destroy the Dragon King

“Dragon Palace Dragon King, this dragon palace hasn’t been around for long. Back then, this Dragon Palace Dragon King single-handedly made the Phoenix and Angel races in the nine-origin universe bow their heads. Their Dragon Palace has an ancient god that feeds the Kun lord, which feeds the space beasts. Currently, it’s estimated that the ancient god feeds the Kun lord with three Kun, which are comparable to level six space beasts.”

“That Dragon King now has such a terrifying treasure. Conservatively speaking, their Dragon Palace’s strength is comparable to eight or nine sixth level Space Beasts.”

At the passage of the belief universe, a palace’s god expert frowned as he looked at the information in his hand!

“If I’m not wrong, the Heavenly Palace’s Black Scripture treasured land and the void spirit treasured land were both attacked by the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.”

The elder of the Decree Palace said coldly with a gloomy face.

The decree palace had lost a total of seven to eight thousand experts from the void spirit treasured land, as well as many experts from the other palaces.

They had also lost three to four thousand gods and a large number of believers from the Heavenly Palace.

The Decree Palace, the Heavenly Palace, and the now-destroyed Qianyuan Palace, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace had almost killed one hundred thousand of the gods they believed in.

What kind of concept was this?

This was a huge loss. Even after fighting for 10 to 20 billion years, not many gods had died.

However, so many of them had been killed by the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!

“The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace has killed so many of our experts. We must kill him. We must kill him!”

The elder of the Decree Palace continued to speak, his eyes full of murderous intent.

“We must first exterminate the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. Otherwise, once he attacks us one by one, our army will not be able to withstand it.”

The elders of the Heavenly Palace chimed in at this moment.

Their Heavenly Palace’s Black Scripture treasured land had been occupied, and a large number of the gods and believers had been killed. This enmity must be avenged!

“That is indeed the case!”

In the surrounding area, the elders of the palace nodded slightly.

Most of them hadn’t been attacked by the Dragon King, but the Dragon King was a powerhouse from the nine-origin universe.

His strength was so terrifying that he had to be destroyed!

Otherwise, there would be endless trouble.

Especially when their palaces were separated, none of them were a match for the Dragon King.

Even if two or three palaces joined forces, they wouldn’t be a match for the Dragon King.

And the 24 palaces couldn’t always gather together.

Therefore, the Dragon King had to be destroyed!

“Immediately inform the other gods of the 23 palaces to gather together.”

An elder of a palace immediately said!

The other elders nodded.

They had to gather the gods and believers immediately. Otherwise, if the Dragon Palace continued to kill their army, the result would be the same as the Qian Yuan Palace.

This loss was too great!

“Prepare the elite forces of ten palaces to kill the Dragon King First.”

Another elder said as he looked around.

The elders of the surrounding palaces nodded in agreement.

They had to deal with the Dragon King first before they could kill the other powerful disciples in the nine-origin universe.

“Should we change the plan now? If we don’t fight back now, they might attack us.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

An elder of a palace spoke, he hesitated for a moment and continued, “I suggest that ten palaces fight against the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, and the other thirteen palaces fight against the powerful disciples of the nine-origin universe. With the power of our thirteen palaces, the nine-origin universe might not be our match.”

“That’s fine. The peak races of the nine-origin universe have been a little arrogant recently. Even if we only send out the power of 13 palaces, it’s enough to suppress them.”

An elder nodded.

“Since that’s the case, then we’ll use the method of prayer to lock onto the position of the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace and destroy him.”

An elder spoke.

The gods of the belief universe began to make plans!

At the same time, in the belief universe, the legions of the palaces received the message from the elder, and their faces were filled with astonishment.

“The million legions of the Qian Yuan Palace were actually destroyed. This… The strength of the other party is somewhat terrifying!”

“Dragon Palace Dragon King? There’s actually such an expert in the nine-origin universe. is the black scripture treasured land of our heavenly palace related to him? He’s courting death. Let’s go and meet up with the other palaces!”

When the other experts of the twenty-three palaces received this news, they immediately began to meet up!

They weren’t very far from each other, and very soon, the legions of the various palaces began to gather.

Half a year later, in a certain part of the starry universe, ten legions of the belief universe gathered together.

Ten Legions, ten million gods, and believers.

Just the existence of the gods alone had reached more than 800,000.

In addition, there were five level 6 space beasts and some special powerful treasures!

They gathered together and the 1,000 or so level 7 gods looked at each other!

“Let’s begin. Follow the orders of the elders and destroy the Dragon King First!”

A Level 7 god from the Heavenly Palace said coldly!

“Okay, Let’s pray and lock on to the Dragon King!”

The group of Tier 7 gods nodded.

“Pray, kill me, pray to the universe gods, pray for karma, lock onto the enemy, lead!”

A Tier 7 god shouted and his voice entered the ears of the tens of millions of gods and believers.

“Yes!”

The gods and believers replied and all the believers immediately sat cross-legged in the air.

The rest of the gods below tier 7 closed their eyes and pressed their palms together!

“Weng Weng Weng Weng!”

“Weng Weng Weng Weng!”

Waves of faith energy floated in the sky. The faith energy changed and condensed together, releasing a special energy.

Slowly, the faith energy condensed into a hairpin and pointed in a certain direction.

Very soon, this arrowhead flew in a certain direction!

“Go, kill that Dragon Palace Dragon King!”

When the faith universe gods saw this scene, they immediately ordered loudly!

Boom! Boom! Boom

At the next moment, the ten belief legions started to move and flew towards the direction that scissors had pointed out.

Belief locking the enemy!

This was an extremely powerful ability of the belief universe.

However, the execution of this move required a large number of believers to gather the power of belief and pray.

The stronger the enemy that they were tracking, the more power of belief they needed.

However, with the power of the ten legions, it was still very easy for them to lock onto Wang Xian’s figure!

The speed of the ten legions was not slow. They flew along with the scissors at a terrifying speed!

At this moment, Wang Xian did not know that he was locked onto.

He was flying towards a direction, looking for the legions of the universe of faith!

Let’s see if we can kill one or two more of them.

“HM?”

After flying for more than half a year, he suddenly felt a terrifying force of faith rushing towards him.
