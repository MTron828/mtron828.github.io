“Dragon King, Prime Minister Turtle and the rest have not been revived yet in the Dragon Palace.”

Evening. Wang Xian sat by an outdoor restaurant near the beach and was talking to Mo Qinglong over the phone.

Wang Xian had sent Mo Qinglong to the Dragon Palace to teach the golden swordfish race to read and speak, and at the same time, to check if the rest had been revived.

The time required to revive them had exceeded his expectations.

With the powers of the Soul Returning branch and Dragon Transformation Pool, it would still take more time before they could be revived.

There aren’t any treasures in the Dragon Palace currently. Let’s hope that I can get some on this trip to the Fire God’s Graveyard!

Sitting by the restaurant next to the beach, Wang Xian looked towards the clear seawater some distance away. Before him, there were tourists from various countries in sexy bikinis playing by the beach.

In the sea, a yacht steered by and left behind a long trail of white waves.

“Sister Lingling, you are so annoying. I want to go surfing! I want to go surfing!”

“Have you forgotten that you almost drowned the last time you went surfing? You can forget about it. Just sit here, drink your tea obediently, and enjoy the sun!”

“Tsk! You...! How... Eh?”

Wang Xian glanced over after hearing a conversation coming from his side.

It was between two girls. One was a loli with two ponytails. Her clothes resembled those cosplay costumes and she looked adorable in them. [1]

The other girl was wearing a white skirt. Both of them were chatting casually.

Wang Xian looked over with eyes of admiration. When he noticed that the loli was staring at him, he felt a little embarrassed and turned around.

“What’s the matter, Xiaowan? You are finally at the age where you are interested in handsome guys?” the girl teased Xiaowan after seeing her staring at Wang Xian.

“Sister Lingling! It’s him! Look! It’s him! He’s that uncle!”

Suddenly, that loli pointed at Wang Xian and shouted.

Huh?

The girl by her side looked curiously towards Wang Xian.

When Wang Xian heard the shouts of the loli, he also turned his head over. He raised an eyebrow and found them to be rather familiar.

“He’s the one who raced with us. The one that rode a heavy-duty motorcycle! It’s him!” the loli exclaimed.

Eh?

The girl by the side pondered for a moment, turned her attention towards Wang Xian and was struck by a sudden realization. “It’s really him!”

“You are that little brat!”

After the loli kicked up a ruckus, Wang Xian also recalled this little brat.

He met her when he had just had the mysterious encounter. After winning a heavy-duty motorcycle from a guy, he encountered three sports cars. Those two girls were in one of the three sports cars.

At that time, they raced and crashed into a big truck after they went into the opposite lane.

This little brat had both legs broken on the spot and that beautiful girl also suffered a huge blow to her chest.

At that time, he had helped to heal them.

Who would have expected he would meet them here after half a year?

Wang Xian’s lips curved up slightly. He looked to the little brat and found her a little more attractive as compared to half a year ago.

“So my daughter is here! Yeah? How are your injuries?” Wang Xian smiled, looked towards the slender legs of the loli and teased her.

He still could recall this little brat asking him to call her mom if he had lost. After the accident, Wang Xian made her call him dad and this little brat did so while crying.

Hmm. The memories were still fresh in his mind.

After all, she was the first daughter he had.

“You... Rascal!”

Seeing how Wang Xian was teasing her, the loli instantly fumed. She gritted her teeth and stared at him.

She could still remember clearly that when she was about to fall unconscious, this guy made her call him daddy.

At the thought of this, she couldn’t wait to eat him.

“Xiao Wan, don’t be rude!”

The girl by the side pulled the loli by her arm and turned to Wang Xian. With a sincere voice, she thanked Wang Xian. “I’m really grateful for your treatment last time. We heard it from the doctor. If it wasn’t for you, we would have been in trouble.

“However, I’m really sorry about it. Because of our family matters, we had come to Dubai for treatment and didn’t have the opportunity to express our gratitude. We really did not expect to see you here!”

Wang Xian shook his head with a smile and answered, “It’s alright. What a coincidence!”

“Yeah, what a coincidence,” the girl chuckled. Soon, she continued, “I’m Tang Lingling and this little girl here is Mu Xiaowan. She’s a little playful!”

“My name is Wang Xian. Please take a seat.” Wang Xian gestured for them to sit.

Tang Lingling nodded her head, pulled Mu Xiaowan along and sat down. “Are you here in Dubai for the holidays?”

“Yeah. What about you guys?” Wang Xian nodded his head and asked the girls.

“Our family has business here,” answered Tang Lingling.

“Do you know how to swim?” At this moment, Mu Xiaowan suddenly asked him this.

“Huh? Of course, I know!” Wang Xian looked at the little girl and answered with a smile.

“Do you know anything about surfing then?” Mu Xiaowan’s eyes beamed and she continued asking.

“It is nothing to me!” Wang Xian said heartily.

“Why don’t we go surfing? It’s so boring staying here. Let’s go, handsome uncle!”

Mu Xiaowan stood up instantly and continued, “To thank you for saving us the last time... Hmm... For the next few days, the great Missy here can bring you around in Dubai. I’ll cover your accommodation and meals. What do you think?”

“I’m not interested in surfing today. All I wanted is to sit here and rest!” Wang Xian said heartily.

“This... This won’t do...” Mu Xiaowan’s jaw dropped. Seeing how Wang Xian was leaning against the chair lazily, she pouted, “When would you be interested in going surfing then?”

“We will see again.” Wang Xian found her hilarious and chuckled.

“Mr. Wang, how many days will you be hanging around here?” Tang Lingling asked with a smile.

“I’m not sure yet. It depends.”

“In that case, we can be the host and bring you around Dubai. We have been here for half a year and know this place really well.”

“Hmm... Alright!”

“Let me treat you to a sumptuous meal. However, you have to bring me surfing. Are you okay with it?”

...

Seeing people from his home country in a foreign land, Wang Xian chatted for close to two hours with the two girls. The little brat constantly begged Wang Xian to bring her to surf.

Eventually, Wang Xian gave in and agreed to her request with a smile.

At night, the little girl brought him to a seafood restaurant. At 9 pm, they bade each other farewell.

The beaches in Dubai were still well lit at night. It was especially so for the beach near the number one hotel in the world. Looking at it from afar, it was breath-taking.

Wang Xian lay below an umbrella on the beach and waited silently.

At midnight, Wang Xian arrived at the seaside punctually.

“Brother, this is a curse beetle that came from your Underworld. After the six of us consume it, I believe you will feel more assured!”

The five people from Dubai had been waiting for him. As compared to the day, all five of them were now wearing capes and resembled those martial artists in China.

“Alright!” Wang Xian didn’t ask them about their outfits and the group consumed the curse beetle.

Curse beetles originated from the Underworld and were still widely used internationally.

The promises and constraints between martial artists could be enforced using curse beetles. Those who went against the rules would suffer great consequences.

Even Inborn experts or even stronger existences had to follow the constraints.

“Let’s go!”

The five of them didn’t speak much. They jumped onto a boat by the side and steered it towards the Fire Spirit Island.
