Chapter 1270: 1,271 humans, trash?

Translator: 5496903

Sickle Blood’s arrogant voice rang out in the arena. His ice-cold eyes stared at Duan Qinghun, who was ranked ninth on the prodigy roll, and his voice was incomparably sharp.

The battle between the two races of the Prodigy bridge was a battle between prodigies of the same rank and those of the same rank.

Similarly, those ranked lower could challenge those ranked higher.

This was a rule left behind by the blood stream sect in the past.

The Demon Beast Clan’s sickle blood directly challenged Duan Qinghun, who ranked ninth on the prodigy roll.

Seeing Sickle Blood’s challenge, Duan Qinghun’s expression was extremely unsightly as he tightly clenched his fists.

“HMPH, you really think I’m afraid of a beast like you. Today, I’ll chop you into pieces!”

Duan Qinghun’s expression was incomparably cold as his body moved and he directly flew into the arena.

After entering the arena, Duan Qinghun held an earthen yellow broadsword in his hand, and his body emitted a powerful Earth attribute energy.

“Duan Qinghun, kill this beast. How dare a guy ranked 10th act so arrogantly? Kill It!”

“Kill it. Tell them not to be so arrogant!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Angry voices sounded in the surroundings, and the entire sky was filled with angry roars.

The number one ranked Demon Beast clan had yet to arrive, and they still said that they didn’t have the qualifications.

The person ranked 10th even challenged the person ranked 9th. This was simply a blatant humiliation to the humans.

“Die!”The humans in the arena shouted angrily.

In the arena, Duan Qinghun’s eyes were filled with killing intent!

“Keke, today, I’m going to eat you!”

Sickle blood waved his two tails and stared at Duan Qinghun coldly. He said disdainfully, “Human, I’ll let you attack First!”

“HMM? You’re courting death!”

Seeing the arrogant words of this demon beast, Duan Qinghun’s eyes turned colder. He waved his arm and a sharp earth knife flew toward sickle blood.

“Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!”

When sickle blood saw Duan Qinghun’s attack, the triangular tongue in its mouth spat out black poisonous mist.

In an instant, the area within a thousand meters was covered by sickle blood, and its entire body was hidden within.

Duan Qinghun’s attack entered the poisonous mist, but there was no response.

“Oh? The poisonous mist domain of the Sickle Snake Clan?”

Duan Qinghun had a serious expression on his face. His body shook, and an earthen yellow armor slowly covered him.

He held his long saber with both hands and swung it forward heavily.

“Sky Splitter, damn beast, Get Out Here!”

He roared, and thousands of earth sabers shot toward the poisonous fog domain.

Whoosh

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

However, at this moment, the poison domain within a 1,000-meter radius suddenly covered Duan qinghun.

“What can a small poison mist do to me?”

He roared as four Earth Shields appeared around him and spun around him rapidly.

“Dust, explode!”

His body moved as he charged into the poison domain. Looking at the sickle blood stained by the Earth attribute energy, he directly killed it.

In the surroundings, hundreds of thousands of people were staring at the battle in the middle of the arena. Many of them were cheering loudly.

“Not good!”

Wang Xian, who was standing outside, had a demonic look in his eyes. Suddenly, he frowned slightly.

“Ah!”

At this moment, a scream of agony was heard from the Black Fog.

“Keke, how can such trash be called a heaven’s favorite? He’s really trash. Humans are really trash!”

An arrogant voice came from the black fog, and the thick black fog quickly disappeared.

“Hiss, this...”

“What? This damned beast, shut up, shut up immediately!”

“Bastard Bastard, how can Duan Qinghun be so weak? He was easily defeated by this demon beast. This demon beast is only ranked tenth!”

The black fog dissipated, revealing a scene that caused everyone to feel cold.

The huge mouth of the sickle-tailed snake demonic beast bit Duan Qinghun’s head and slowly swallowed him into its stomach.

Its eyes were filled with disdain.

Duan Qinghun’s body was still trembling, but he did not have the strength to resist at all.

This scene made all the humans feel extremely embarrassed.

“Gulp, TSK TSK, it’s really delicious!”

After it swallowed Duan qinghun into its stomach, its triangular tongue stretched out and licked him. A hint of excitement could be seen in its eyes.

It swept its gaze in the direction of Wang Xian and the rest.

“Come on, next!”

Sickle blood raised its head slightly and said with a face full of disdain.

“Haha, Sickle Blood, Hurry up and get down here. Leave some food for us!”

“That’s right. It’s been a long time since I’ve tasted delicious human flesh. Hurry up and get down here!”

“Humans only know how to use some despicable methods. If we were to fight them head-on, we would crush them completely!”

At the back, a group of demonic beasts let out mocking voices as they laughed arrogantly.

“Hehe, humans are all a bunch of trash. In a one-on-one fight, they are completely no match for US Demonic Beasts!”

In the demonic beast crowd at the back of the arena, a 20-meter long sickle-tailed snake raised its proud head and roared disdainfully.

Behind it was a group of sickle-tailed snake demonic beasts. Their triangular eyes were filled with disdain.

“Damn it, these demonic beasts are too arrogant!”

“The gap is too big. We, the ninth-ranked human genius, aren’t a match for the tenth-ranked demonic beast genius, and we were killed so easily!”

“The gap is too big, it’s really too big. No wonder humans rarely get the title of Supreme Genius!”

“The demonic beast genius this time is even stronger than the last one. As the rumors say, the Demonic Beast clan isn’t a match for the human genius at all!”

“Humiliation, this is a huge humiliation!”

All the humans around turned pale when they saw the arrogant demon beasts.

In a one-on-one situation, humans were indeed much weaker than demon beasts.

The dragon race was a good example.

In the entire transcendence continent, the dragon race was the strongest existence. Even humans had to bow down to them.

However, even though everyone understood in their hearts, after being humiliated in this battle of the prodigies, everyone’s faces were extremely ugly.

“I told you. The prodigies of your Liuhai region are completely no match for the Demon Beast Race!”

At this moment, around the arena, shopkeeper Qian looked at the battle below with a faint smile on his face.

He said to Long Xiaotian and the other six or seven youths beside him.

He was not from the flowing sea region, so he did not care about humans being humiliated by demonic beasts.

“Looks like it’s really as shopkeeper Qian said, Sigh!”

One of the youths shook his head slightly.

“Hehe, among the elites of the flowing sea region, apart from the nameless sword demon, the others are all too weak. However, even that nameless sword demon is still far from being comparable to the Demonic Beast King!”

Shopkeeper Qian said with a faint smile.

The surrounding youths were somewhat silent.

The genius beast that killed the blood flow empire had yet to come out. If he came out, who would be his opponent?

Even the nameless sword demon couldn’t do it!
