3804 3,803, two pinnacle races seeking peace

“Sou! Sou! Sou!”

At the entrance of the passageway between the nine origin universe and the starry universe.

Terrifying figures flew over.

There were angels of light that were like white stars.

There were angels of darkness that flapped their wings in the endless darkness.

There were also fire phoenixes that flapped their phoenix wings and emitted monstrous flames.

There were also water phoenixes that flew like an ocean.

There was also a golden phoenix that was emitting rays of golden light!

This was a group of experts from the Angel race and the Phoenix race. They were all experts at the level of deacons and elders.

There was even a terrifying existence sitting on the divine seat of light in the middle of the group of experts from the angel race. Above his head was a light reincarnation pool.

This existence was from the angel race, the king of the radiant angels.

He was already a peak existence among the rulers of the nine-origin universe.

There were less than one hand that could defeat him.

This one hand contained the existence of the Heavenly Yuan destiny.

One could imagine how powerful the king of the Radiant Angels was.

There was also an existence on the same level as the king of the radiant angels from the Phoenix race.

A Water Phoenix.

She flapped her wings and flew over as if she was carrying a water world!

The Phantom of the Phoenix in the surroundings gave off a joyful name!

Countless experts gathered in this direction.

Around the tunnel, the eyes of some experts from other peak races flashed when they saw this.

“It’s because of the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!”

“It must be. In the past hundreds of thousands of years, our elven race has added hundreds of rulers. This universe is a treasure land. Now that the Dragon King wants to exterminate the Phoenix race and the angel race, the loss of the two peak races is too great. They can’t bear it!”

“Hehe, who would have thought that the Dragon King who was chased to our angel race has grown to such a level?”

The Great Elves from the Elf clan looked on with smiles.

The Elf clan was the first to befriend the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.

Moreover, their elven empress had given the Dragon King a treasure to conceal his aura.

Without this treasure, the fact that the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace had seven attributes would have been exposed!

If the Angel clan had known that the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace had so many attributes, even if they broke the rules, they would have killed the Dragon King in the cradle.

The Elf race had done the Dragon King a favor!

They could tell that the Dragon King had always remembered this favor.

“This is going to be interesting. I wonder what the Angel Race and the Phoenix race will do. Will they give up on the universe, bow to the Dragon King, or do something else?”

The experts of the peak races discussed.

The angel race and Phoenix race were in deep trouble!

“Buzz Buzz Buzz!”

At this moment, the experts of the angel race and Phoenix race flew over.

They floated in the air with ugly expressions!

This included the king of the Light Angel race and the King of the Water Phoenix race!

This matter had already affected the future development of their two great races.

After all, not even one-fifth of the starry cosmos had been explored.

Now, they had added several hundred ruler-level existences, and they had also found powerful grotto-heavens.

Some grotto-heavens were only slightly weaker than their grotto-heavens in the core of the nine origin universe.

How could they bear to give up.

But if they didn’t give up, what could they do now?

Should they really bow down to the Dragon King?

Bow down to the Dragon Palace?

The question was, would the Dragon Palace Dragon King agree to bow down now?

They would probably have to pay a price!

“Ancestral witch of the Shaman Clan, Our Angel clan is willing to offer enough treasures in exchange for an ancestral witch of the Shaman Clan to kill the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. Do you agree or not?”

After hovering in the air for a few seconds, the king of the radiant angels suddenly looked towards the shaman clan.

The strongest member of the Shaman clan was called the twelve ancestor witches.

Just like their names, there were twelve of them, and each of them was extremely terrifying.

“Lord king of the Radiant Angels, the price is too great. Our ancestor witches won’t make a move. We only know the Dragon King of Dragon Palace’s real name, and we have to kill him with a curse across a universe. Even if the twelve of US attack together, it will only be a glimmer of hope.”

On the Shaman Tribe’s side, an ancestral Magus who was a ruler at the eighth level replied indifferently.

This was just a polite response from them!

If it was not polite, then it would be nonsense!

It was too sleepy!

With only one real name, the twelve ancestral magi could indeed kill him with a curse. However, they were separated by a universe, so they could forget about it.

Even if the twelve ancestral Magi joined forces, the chances of success were only one-tenth.

Hearing this, the King of angels of Light’s face darkened.

He also knew that the chances were slim, but under the current circumstances, he had no other choice.

“The space beasts in the starry universe have already warned us that once an existence above the level seven ruler enters, he will definitely be killed. There is a slight chance of a powerful true treasure, but the chance is too small.”

The Water Phoenix King’s eyes gleamed as he looked at the Radiant Angel King. “Negotiate with the Dragon Palace. Let the Dragon King make the conditions. Even if we have to pay a price or some resources, we can not give up on the universe!”

“HM?”

The surrounding experts from the peak races were surprised to hear the Water Phoenix King’s words.

They were surprised that the water phoenix king wanted to negotiate with the Dragon Palace.

The two peak races wanted to make peace with the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!

This made all the living beings boil again!

The Radiant Angel King sat on the divine throne with a bad look on his face. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

But he didn’t have any other way now.

They couldn’t enter the starry universe.

The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace had the ancient god Kun sovereign, and the ancient god Kun sovereign wasn’t suppressed by the starry universe. He might become stronger and stronger in the future.

He might even be so strong that even if they entered, they would be able to contend with him.

After all, they would be suppressed when they entered.

Under this situation, the other party was simply invincible!

There was no other way!

They could either leave the starry universe.

Or they could seek peace with the Dragon Palace!

But they would probably pay a huge price to seek peace!

The King of angels of light floated in the air and nodded weakly after a few minutes.

“Yes!”

Yes, yes!

They had been completely cornered by the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.

The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace was the first one who could make the two peak races helpless!

The Angels and the phoenixes flapped their wings around them.

They also helplessly looked at each other.

This time their third prince (Green River Water Phoenix) caused trouble, will make them lose too much!
