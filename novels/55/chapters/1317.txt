Chapter 1318: 1319 was completely suppressed

When Wang Xian finished his words, his body moved and instantly attacked the six demonic beasts.

“Roar!”

“Damn it, run, run!”

“This despicable human, all of us demonic beasts will join hands to kill him!”

The demonic beasts stared at Wang Xian with wide eyes and shock. When they saw him rushing over, they fled back in fear.

Some of them even roared in anger.

However, Wang Xian didn’t give them any time.

Among the demonic beasts that stayed on the first level, none of them were above the second level of the Seethrough void stage.

The demon-free sword in his hand vibrated slightly. A special energy attacked the six demonic beasts of the demonic Lin clan in front of him.

“Oh no, quickly Dodge!”

Two of the demonic Lin Beasts were filled with shock as they hurriedly fled into the distance.

The other four demonic beasts were unable to dodge in time and were directly enveloped by a black fog. The five elements energy contained in the fog directly annihilated and killed them.

Another four experts at the second level of the Seethrough realm were instantly killed.

At this moment, Wang Xian was like an invincible demon king. Any enemy would be instantly killed in one move.

Watching the nameless sword demon kill eight experts at the second level of the Seethrough realm in two moves, the entire first level was completely silent.

Regardless of whether it was the demonic beasts or the humans, all of them swallowed a mouthful of saliva. Their eyes were filled with fear.

It’s almost time to return to the Dragon Palace. I should get some corpses of the insightful void martial artists back to help the members of the Dragon Palace raise their levels

Wang Xian thought to himself. He swept his gaze across all the demonic beasts in the hall and started moving.

“Run, run, run!”

“This despicable human!”

“Hide in the formation, hide in the formation!”

“Not good, he can break into the formation directly. The third-level formation of the void interpretation stage is completely useless!”

A series of panicked voices and terrified cries were heard, causing chaos in the entire first level of the main hall.

When some demonic beasts saw Wang Xian rushing into a formation and killing the demonic beasts inside, they were even more terrified.

They used the array formation to create a safe space to prevent the other party’s experts from coming over to kill them wantonly.

Now, this human actually disregarded the array formation?

This...

The rest of the demonic beasts didn’t hesitate at all and fled frantically outside.

“All of you, stay behind!”

The crown on Wang Xian’s head swayed slightly and charged forward with destructive energy.

The energy covered an area of a thousand meters. All the demonic beasts that were covered by the energy were killed.

At least twenty corpses of the demonic beasts were lying on the ground.

This caused the rest of the demonic beasts to walk out frantically.

Wang Xian didn’t continue to chase after them. He moved his body and kept the corpses into his interspatial ring.

The demonic beasts also possessed interspatial rings. However, the treasures in them were much less than those of humans.

The improvement of the strength of the demonic beasts depended entirely on resources. After they obtained some resources, they would immediately convert them into strength.

However, even so, more than twenty demonic beasts at the insightful void tier still brought Wang Xian a lot of blood essence and spiritual liquid. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Nameless sword demon... he... he...”

Behind them, the human powerhouses who were staying in the formation saw this scene and their pupils couldn’t help but shrink.

They swallowed a mouthful of saliva and kept the formation. Then, they slowly retreated outside.

It was very common to kill and Rob people in the graveyard of demons and humans. They were really afraid that the nameless sword demon would attack them.

This made some people flee outside in fear.

Wang Xian’s eyes swept across more than 20 insightful void martial artists. His eyes were sparkling.

If he could kill all of them, his level would definitely increase.

“No... Don’t kill us. We have no enmity with you!”

One of the insightful emptiness realm experts saw the glint in Wang Xian’s eyes. He quickly shouted and walked out.

“Forget it!”

Wang Xian shook his head. He did not attack when he saw all the human experts escaping.

On the first level of the main hall, everyone had escaped.

“Eh?”

At this moment, at the stairway to Heaven, at the entrance to the second level, three middle-aged men walked out.

They were dressed in blood flow dynasty’s attire. When they saw that Wang Xian was the only one riding on the demon soul in the hall, they were surprised.

“Nameless Sword Demon?”

“This is the nameless sword demon who obtained the Supreme Heaven’s pride.”

“It’s him, a very mysterious kid!”

The three of them looked at Wang Xian.

“Kid, where are the people in the hall on the first floor? Where did they go? Could it be that there are treasures unearthed in the main hall?”

The old man in the middle stared at Wang Xian with a twinkle in his eyes as he asked him.

“I don’t know!”

Wang Xian shook his head lightly. He patted his demon soul and walked towards the stairway to heaven.

“Eh? Kid, I’m asking you a question. What’s with your attitude?”

“Maybe he thinks that he’s a Supreme Heaven’s pride expert and doesn’t take anyone seriously. Back then, when our blood flow empire invited him, this fellow didn’t even reply!”

The two elders beside him saw Wang Xian’s cold and arrogant look. They narrowed their eyes slightly and said coldly.

“How impudent!”

The eyes of the Elder in the middle also revealed a cold look. He raised his palm and a terrifying flame rose from it!

“You’re courting death!”

When Wang Xian saw them making their move, the crown on his head spun and turned into a hundred-meter-wide five elements millstone. It pressed down on them directly.

“You still dare to fight back? Do you really think that a Supreme Heaven’s pride expert can suppress everyone?”

The elder in the middle glared angrily. An aura of a level three insightful void martial artist was emitted.

He raised both his palms and attacked the five elements millstone directly.

“Suppress!”

Wang Xian moved slightly. The two flaming palms that were attacking the five elements millstone suddenly doubled in size and attacked the three of them at an even more terrifying speed.

“What?”

“What kind of supernatural ability is this?”

The third-level insightful void martial artist’s face was filled with shock. His entire body was exuding an even more terrifying flame.

However, the moment the flame rose, it actually became chaotic. It was as though he could not control his own strength.

“What is this?”

He had a horrified expression on his face as he watched helplessly as the flaming palm descended.

“Boom!”

The expert at level three of the Seethrough realm was instantly killed, along with two other experts at level two of the Seethrough realm!

A look of contempt appeared on Wang Xian’s face. He walked over and kept the interspatial ring and the corpse.

Wang Xian checked all the interspatial rings. He took out the spiritual liquid and blood essence and consumed them immediately.

There were more than 30 interspatial rings of void interpretation stage powerhouses in total. The spiritual liquid and blood essence contained in the interspatial rings increased the amount of dragon crystals by about 40 million.

He looked at the amount of dragon crystals required to upgrade his level. It was only about 10 million.

If he was lucky, it wouldn’t be long before his strength would be able to break through the void interpretation stage and reach the third change of the Divine Dragon Transformation.

“Let’s go up and take a look!”

Wang Xian looked at the stairway to heaven. He rode on his demon soul and flew straight up.

At a height of about 20 meters, when Wang Xian arrived at the upper level, he realized that the second level was completely different from the first level.

On the second level, there were many rooms. Each room contained a majestic spiritual energy.
