Chapter 1299: 1,300 people collided

“Eh? He didn’t give Princess Tang Ling ‘er any face. This... this Wang Xian is so arrogant!”

“He has some qualifications to be arrogant. He has two beasts at the first level of the profound void tier under him.”

“Arrogant, arrogant. Let’s not talk about the scumbag thing he did to the fox. Even if he is arrogant to Princess Tang Ling ‘er, I don’t think this kid will live for long!”

“Among the few heaven’s favorites behind Tang Ling ‘er, some of them have powerful families. Their families also have experts at the second or third level of the Seethrough realm. This kid is probably courting death!”

“Good, good. It would be good if such an ungrateful bastard was killed!”

When the surrounding people saw Wang Xian’s domineering and arrogant words, they were all stunned.

However, following that, some of them showed disdain on their faces.

Although Tang Ling ‘ER’s identity could not represent the entire bloodshed empire, she was not someone that ordinary insightful void martial artists could bully.

If a kid dared to clash with Princess Tang Ling ‘er to the end, he would definitely pay a heavy price.

“Alright, Alright!”

When Tang Ling ‘er heard Wang Xian’s domineering words, her face turned cold.

However, very soon, a smile appeared on her face. “Since that’s the case, I will let you witness it within a day!”

“Princess Tang Ling ‘er, you don’t have to do anything about this. Leave it to me!”

“A brat still dares to be arrogant towards you. If this isn’t the Sword Whisper Sect’s Sky Sword Lingyun Association, I’ll let him die here right now!”

“I’d like to see what qualifications you have to be arrogant here!”

The few elites behind Tang Ling ‘er narrowed their eyes slightly. They looked at each other, their eyes filled with killing intent.

“Alright!”

Tang Ling ‘er nodded her head and looked at Long Xiaotian. “If anyone dares to help him, they would be making an enemy out of me!”

“Princess Tang Ling ‘er, don’t worry. If my second brother dares to help, we will help you to stop him. Haha!”

Long Xiaochen laughed out loud when he heard Tang Ling ‘ER’s words and said fawningly from the side.

“Don’t worry, Princess. No one can help him outside the Heavenly Sword Sect’s Island!”

The group of Heaven’s favorites behind him stared coldly at Wang Xian and curled their lips in disdain.

Even if a kid had a pet at the first level of the Seethrough void tier, even if he had the help of the lady beside him, it was still suicidal to go against Tang Ling ‘er and them.

To kill them, it was a piece of cake for the group of Heaven’s favorites to rely on their family’s influence.

When Long Xiaotian heard their words, his expression changed drastically and he looked worried.

The people around him were gloating at Wang Xian.

Especially Long Xiaochen and the other princes. They couldn’t hide the smile on their faces and almost burst out laughing.

Wang Xian swept his gaze across all of them and a hint of coldness appeared on his face.

They still wanted to kill him? It was simply wishful thinking. When the time came, it was uncertain who would kill who.

“Whoever dares to deal with him, you will have to ask the sword in my hand!”

Just when the atmosphere was a little heavy, a cold voice was suddenly heard.

The sudden voice caused everyone to be slightly stunned. Their faces were filled with astonishment.

What was going on?

At this moment, there was still someone who dared to stand up for Wang Xian and the rest.

Tang Ling ‘ER had just released the words that whoever dared to help him would become his enemy!

The group of Heaven’s favorites even swore to kill him!

Under such circumstances, who would dare to stand up for him?

“HMM?”

When Wang Xian heard this familiar voice, he was also slightly stunned as he looked in front of him.

In front of him, a young man with a huge sword in his hand walked over. Compared to his tattered clothes from before, he had slightly long hair at this moment.

He had sharp eyes and was dressed in golden clothing. In the middle of the golden clothing, there was the word ‘large sword’.

Looking at the young man walking over to him, he raised his eyebrows and a smile appeared on his face.

The young man holding the sword was naturally Ren Xingchen. Behind him, there were more than ten sword Whisper sect disciples.

These disciples stood behind him and looked at him with some respect.

When they saw Ren Xingchen suddenly speaking, they were slightly shocked. However, they didn’t say anything.

“Eh? That’s Ren Xingchen!”

“It’s Ren Xingchen. It’s actually him... this... why is he wearing the uniform of the Heaven Sword Sect? Could It Be... The Heaven Sword sect is announcing that a disciple has joined today? Could it be him? Ren Xingchen has joined the Heaven Sword sect!”

“Hiss, Ren Xingchen has actually joined the heavenly sword sect. However, what is the relationship between this Ren Xingchen and Wang Xian? Why would he say such a thing?”

Everyone was shocked.

Everyone understood Ren Xingchen’s strength. A Peerless Heaven’s favorite with dual attributes was able to fight against a powerhouse at the first level of the Seethrough realm.

If it wasn’t for the appearance of the nameless sword demon, he could be said to be the most dazzling existence and the strongest dark horse in this year’s prodigy roll.

Seeing him joining the Heavenly Sword sect, everyone was a little surprised.

What was even more surprising was that under everyone’s gaze, he walked straight towards Wang Xian.

However, at the next moment, everyone was dumbfounded.

Ren Xingchen walked to Wang Xian’s side and bowed respectfully. He bowed heavily.

When everyone saw this scene, they were a little dumbfounded.

Ren Xingchen was a Peerless Heaven’s favorite of the current generation. He was a dual-attributed genius who was comparable to a powerhouse at the first level of the Seethrough void stage.

Now, he was actually bowing respectfully to that young man.

This bowing contained a lot of things.

When Wang Xian saw Ren Xingchen walking over, a faint smile appeared on his face.

Although this Ren Xingchen was rather stubborn, he was still more obedient.

Ling Jian ‘er should be the one who relayed his words to him when he joined the Heavenly Sword sect.

He had also obtained his true identity from Ling Jian ‘ER.

Clang

Ren Xingchen stood beside Wang Xian. The huge sword in his hand let out a cold sound.

The long sword in his hand was pointed straight at Tang Ling ‘ER’s position.

This sword finger caused everyone to reveal a look of horror.

“You bunch of trash want to deal with him? !”

Ren Xingchen’s cold voice came from his mouth.

His sword covered Tang Ling ‘er and all the heaven’s favorites behind him.

His words caused Tang Ling ‘er and the other heaven’s favorites behind him to have a drastic change in expression. Their expressions instantly turned gloomy and cold. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

A moment ago, they were still saying that whoever dared to help him would become their enemy.

No one could save such words.

The next moment, Ren Xingchen rushed over and pointed his fierce longsword at him.

This matter was a little too serious.

In particular, everyone looked at Ren Xingchen’s clothes.

A few days ago, the Heavenly Sword sect had sent news that a new disciple would be announced at the Heavenly Sword Lingyun meet today.

This disciple was obviously Ren Xingchen.

Ren Xingchen’s strength and talent definitely belonged to the most outstanding and core disciple of the entire heavenly sword sect.

Now, Ren Xingchen, who was ranked second on the prodigy roll, was standing directly beside that young man to confront Tang Ling ‘er.

What was he trying to do?

A confrontation between the blood flow empire and the Heavenly Sword sect?
