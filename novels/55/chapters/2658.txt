“This trip went very smoothly. I wonder how the situation on the Demon Island is.”

After informing the mother of the Imperial Star Lady, Wang Xian did not stay in the imperial court for long. He flew directly in the direction of the Demon Island.

After flying and making a detour, Wang Xian and the rest arrived at planet Yao Yue after more than ten hours.

“Master, I’ll return to the Beichuan sect first.”

Bei Shuang said to Wang Xian and flew towards the planet of the Beichuan sect.

Wang Xian flew straight towards the planet where the Dragon Palace was located at the edge of the Northern line.

“Eh?”

When Wang Xian arrived at the planet where the Dragon Palace was located, he saw a few hundred people floating in front of the Dragon Peak.

He raised his eyebrows slightly and flew over immediately.

“Huh? The Dragon King Is Here!”

“The Dragon King is here. Let’s go and thank him.”

Beside the Dragon Peak, a few hundred people noticed Wang Xian flying over and immediately went up to welcome him.

“This is? Ancient God Dynasty!”

Wang Xian looked at their attire and raised his eyebrows slightly.

His gaze swept across more than 200 people, including two immortal King Level 8 powerhouses.

“Greetings, Dragon King.”

“We finally meet you. Thank you for your help in the battle not long ago. Our Ancient God dynasty is extremely grateful.”

Everyone flew over and thanked Wang Xian immediately.

“Oh? I have been away for a few days. I don’t know what happened on the Demon Island.”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and looked at the few civil officials of the Dragon Palace in front of the Dragon Peak.

“Dragon King, after you left, the experts of our Dragon Palace also returned to the Dragon Palace to increase their strength. Another war broke out on the Demon Island. This time, the scale of the war wasn’t very large. However, the ancient God dynasty was unlucky to encounter six immortal king level eight abyss species.”

“They asked us for help. Prime Minister Gui sent the Fire Hammer clan of the Dragon Palace to control the Dragon Peak and sent a group of experts to help them defend this crisis.”

A civil official immediately walked over and whispered to Wang Xian.

“It’s all thanks to the Dragon Palace’s help this time. Otherwise, our ancient God dynasty would have suffered a great loss. If the Dragon King has any orders in the future, our ancient God dynasty will not decline.”

Beside him, an old ancestor of the ancient God dynasty said to Wang Xian with a smile and bowed.

“Hehe, it’s just a small matter. I just came back from the outside and have some matters that I have yet to settle. Let’s meet again after this war is over.”

Wang Xian shook his head nonchalantly when he heard his words.

“Alright, Alright. We shall not disturb the Dragon King then. After the Battle of the Abyss, our ancient God dynasty would like to thank everyone from the Dragon Palace!”

Everyone from the ancient God dynasty nodded their heads.

Wang Xian smiled and flew straight into the Dragon Palace on the planet beside them.

“The Dragon Palace is really loyal. They have helped us so much but the Dragon King did not take it to heart at all.”

“That’s right. It’s fortunate that the Dragon Palace appeared in the Battle of the Abyss this time. That Dragon King is really carefree and magnanimous. In the future, when the disciples of the ancient God dynasty meet the people of the Dragon Palace, we should treat them with more respect.”

When the people of the ancient God dynasty saw Wang Xian leaving just like that, they sighed slightly.

The Dragon Palace had helped them a lot this time. Although the ancient God dynasty had given them enough corpses from the abyss, the ancient God dynasty still owed them a favor.

“Prime Minister Gui, another war happened while I was away?”

In the main Dragon Palace, Wang Xian immediately went to the dragon transformation pool after he returned. Prime Minister Gui stood there.

“Dragon King!”

“Dragon King, a war broke out on the fourth day after you left. The ancient God dynasty encountered some trouble. They gave us some abyss seed corpses, and I sent people to ride Dragon Peak to help them defend.”

“However, because the sky array and most of the members were improving their strength, they were unable to kill the level 8 undying god King Abyss Seed.”

Prime Minister Gui said.

“HM, how’s the situation on the Demon Island?”

Wang Xian asked.

“There’s no situation at the moment. However, last month, the great sect had another level 9 undying god King Abyss seed. The future situation isn’t good.”

“Last month’s great sect’s strength is not the best among the few great sects. There are no peak undying godly king level powerhouses.”

“According to the information we received, last month’s great sect should have four godly king level 9 powerhouses.”

Prime Minister Gui said.

“Four, call Ao Yao and Mu Ze Sen over.”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly and ordered him.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded and immediately flew back.

Wang Xian stood in front of the dragon transformation pool and looked at the group of Dragon Palace powerhouses inside.

Ao Fenghuang, Ao Jian, AO qitian, Ao qi and the rest were all improving inside.

...

In the middle was the sky array with an extremely strange body.

The sky array was heading towards the immortal King Level 9 breakthrough while Ao Fenghuang, Ao Jian and the rest were breaking through to the immortal King Level 8.

After this, the Dragon Palace would be able to increase the combat strength of one level 9 immortal king and eight level 8 immortal king.

However! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Wang Xian moved his palm and a space ring appeared in his hand. Within the space ring, there was a large amount of resources.

“These resources will allow the Dragon Palace to increase the combat strength of four level 9 immortal kings.”

Wang Xian revealed a smile. He was prepared to increase ao Yao, Mu Zesen, Ao Xingmu and AO Fenghuang.

After the upgrade, the Dragon Palace would have six immortal King Level 9 powerhouses.

If the great sect was as powerful as Prime Minister Gui had said, they would not be a match for the Dragon Palace.

“Dragon King!”

Soon, Ao Yao and Mu Zesen rushed over.

...

“Let’s upgrade the two of You First!”

Wang Xian looked at them and said directly.

“HMM?”

The two of them already possessed the combat strength of an immortal king level eight. Hence, the improvement this time was not as good as theirs.

Upon hearing Wang Xian’s words, he was slightly stunned.

“You are lucky to have obtained some resources. You guys can sit here with your legs crossed.”

Wang Xian smiled and poured a large amount of resources into his mouth. They were quickly converted into dragon energy.

Following that, Wang Xian transferred the Dragon Energy to Ao Yao and Mu Zesen.

Boom! Boom

Half an hour later, ao Yao and Mou Zesen’s strength had a smooth breakthrough.

After the breakthrough, the power of the two of them became even more majestic.

“Dragon Palace, Ao Yao, Mou Zesen, and the rest have improved. Next, we will be able to obtain more abyssal seed corpses!”

Prime Minister Gui said excitedly from the side.

“We don’t know how long this war will last. The war at the imperial court is about to break out soon. This is also an opportunity for our Dragon Palace!”

“However, opportunities and dangers coexist.”

Wang Xian mumbled as his eyes sparkled.

Now, he hoped that the war on the Demon Island would last longer.

The longer it lasted, the more resources the Dragon Palace would obtain and the faster the Dragon Palace’s strength would increase.

If the demon island was breached, it would be a huge problem.

With a thought, he came to the front of the Dragon Throne!
