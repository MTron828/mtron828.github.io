“This… This is the power of Dragon Palace? 100 universe masters with level-three combat power, hiss, so terrifying!”

“This power is too terrifying, so powerful. Is Dragon Palace really so powerful?”

“How Can Dragon Palace develop so quickly? 1,000 years ago, they were forced by the Hundred City Alliance to seal and Suppress Dragon Palace. Now, they are so terrifying. This power is practically invincible among the high-level races!”

“Just the power displayed by the Dragon Palace and this array is almost invincible.”

The Great Beings of the pinnacle races were slightly shocked!

And the Great Beings of the high-level races’disciples were incomparably shocked!

Ever since the Dragon Palace had destroyed the three supreme water demon emperors of the invincible region, and only used 10 minutes to destroy 71 universe rulers with level 3 combat power, the universe ai.., many powerful disciples called the Dragon Palace Invincible among the high-level races!

Now it seemed that they were truly invincible!

Who below the peak could compete with them?

Especially since the Dragon King had the strength to kill the Old Monsters of the invincible region, and the Dragon Palace had the frost dragon, even the technological world couldn’t be the Dragon Palace’s match, right?

“The Dragon Palace is invincible, the Dragon King is invincible!”

Some of the powerful beings of the high-level races couldn’t help but Exclaim!

“With the strength displayed by the Dragon Palace, the Frost Dragon God, the red-clothed woman, the old scholar of the Monster King and the Black Tower’s wizard, it’s normal for them to be killed. This Dragon King’s strength should be top-notch in our invincible region. He might be stronger than the monster King and the others, but to be invincible, I’m afraid he’s still a little lacking!”

An expert from the invincible zone heard the comments of the disciples of some high-level races and analyzed the situation indifferently!

“It’s impossible to be invincible below the peak. If we’re talking about invincible people, there should be a few crazy old monsters in our invincible zone who are truly invincible!”

An illusory figure of the Netherworld race replied.

The strength displayed by the Dragon Palace was very strong. This force could completely destroy the three top-level experts of the Invincible Zone!

This also made them conclude that two years ago, the old scholar, the supreme water demon king, and the Black Tower Magus were killed by the Dragon Palace!

They didn’t think that it was the dragon king who killed them all!

The experts of the Invincible Zone didn’t agree with the Dragon King’s invincibility!

Because the Invincible Zone had a terrifying existence!

“HMM? is the invincible zone really as powerful as they say?”

Some of the high-level race disciples heard their conversation and looked over with puzzled faces!

“Welcome to the territory of the Dragon Palace, experts from all races. This is a small auction in the Dragon Palace!”

At this moment, Wang Xian and the rest had already arrived at the front of the auction venue and sat down. Prime Minister Gui walked onto the stage and said with a smile on his face.

“Also, the eight experts who are hiding around the river of eternity, please enter our auction venue. This is an auction, not the outside world.”

Prime Minister Gui glanced around and continued with a smile!

“Oh?”

In the front, a few universe ruler-level great beings from pinnacle races raised their eyebrows and looked around!

“Sou Sou Sou!”

After Prime Minister Gui finished speaking, some great beings hiding around didn’t continue to hide anything and flew straight over!

On the far right, five angels flew over!

Three angels of light and two fallen angels!

In front of them were the dark clan’s skeleton figures. Their eyes were flashing with red light as they scanned their surroundings!

Their eyes landed on the black vulture king, and there was a hint of respect in their eyes!

“Greetings, Black Vulture King!”

The two skeletons bowed respectfully!

The skeleton clan was a peak race. Although they were the kings and there were many wars between the kings, the strong ones would always be respected.

“Well!”

The black vulture king glanced around and replied calmly! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“The Angel clan. I didn’t expect that the Angel clan would come. They are not on good terms with the Dragon Palace. Almost all the subsidiary races of the Angel clan have been wiped out by the Dragon Palace

“The Angel clan is relatively close to this place. Besides, they naturally need the innate supreme treasures of light and darkness attributes this time. It’s not strange for them to come here. After all, the so-called subsidiary races are nothing to the Angel clan!”

“Those two lords should be masters of the universe of the skeleton clan. They actually paid their respects to the elder beside the Dragon King. is that elder an even more powerful existence of the skeleton clan?”? “That red-clothed woman seems to have a very good relationship with him. Isn’t this red-clothed woman from the Dragon Palace?”

The sudden appearance of the experts of the angel race and the skeleton race caused the surrounding experts and disciples of the high-level races to discuss in shock!

They all looked on with reverence!

“Boom!”

On the left side, a figure flew over. His body was filled with an extremely chaotic aura. His entire figure was like a bomb that was about to explode!

His body strangely had two types of energy, metal and blue. There was a pair of horns on top of his head.

A golden horn and a blue horn!

He entered the auction and quietly floated there. His eyes were closed and he did not look at anything!

“Oh? Isn’t this a restriction?”

“It’s a restriction. It really is him. The blue and golden horns are him. This… this… I didn’t expect this person to come!”

“Hiss, he won’t Go Crazy Here, will he?”

His arrival seemed to attract more attention than the great beings from the skeleton race and the angel race!

The Great Beings from the invincible region looked over with shock in their eyes!

This figure with the blue and golden horns and closed eyes was called forbidden!

This was the only word, but all the great beings in the invincible region knew how terrifying he was!

A crazy demon, an old crazy demon!

It was said that he was born from the fusion of the flesh and blood of the Space Beasts and universe masters at the beginning of the invincible region.

He had a lifespan of more than 10 billion years, and his level was still at the pinnacle of Universe Knights!

But his power was not something Tai Shui Demon Emperor and the others could compare to!

He was one of the crazy demons in the Invincible Region!

Because when he fought, he would lose his mind and become a mad demon!

Secondly, some people guessed that if he was imprisoned for a year, he might not be able to control his mind for half a year and become a terrifying fighting machine!

The experts of the invincible zone discussed, but the experts of the peak races only glanced at him and ignored him!

They didn’t take the experts of the invincible zone seriously, and they even looked down on them!

Because these were all people who couldn’t break through and had gone astray!

“Hehe, since everyone is here, let the auction begin!”

Prime Minister Gui saw them coming out and said, “For this auction, the innate supreme treasures that our dragon palace has brought out, you can place your bids with five elements innate spirit treasures instead of medicinal pills, divine herbs, divine fruits, and the like.”
