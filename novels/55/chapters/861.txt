Translator: 549690339

“How was it, Xiao Xian? How did it go with Father Feng Lingtian?”

One day a year later, Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue and the rest asked with a smile when they saw Wang Xian return.

When Xiao Yu saw her brother return, she stared at Wang Xian with a slightly red face and looked at him expectantly.

“It’s done. We will prepare Xiao Yu’s wedding in half a year. Hehe!”

Wang Xian walked to Xiao Yu’s side and patted her head as he said to her.

“Brother, I’m not in a hurry. When are you going to hold your wedding with your sisters-in-law?”

Xiao Yu said to Wang Xian with a slightly red face.

She had been together with Feng Lingtian for two to three years. These two to three years were neither long nor short.

Xiao Yu was already a 25-year-old girl.

As for Wang Xian, he was already 26 years old this year.

However, time did not leave any traces on their bodies. They still looked the same as before.

“US!”

Wang Xian looked at Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue, Sun Lingxiu, and a Jiaya beside him. He glanced at Tang Yinxuan and elder fan, intentionally or unintentionally, and chuckled.

“Right now, your brother only has you to worry about. So, let’s settle your wedding first, Xiao Yu!”

Guan Shuqing smiled and said to Xiao Yu, “As for our wedding, there’s no rush. When Xiao Xian becomes a peerless master, we can get married again!”

“That’s right. We’re with Xiao Xian every day, so there’s no rush. Let’s Settle Your Wedding First!”

Lan Qingyue and the others smiled. Although they were looking forward to the wedding, they were not in a hurry.

Now that they were together every day, the wedding was just a formality.

Now, all the members of the Dragon Palace were addressing them as the Dragon Queen. They could be considered as the real mistress of the Dragon Palace.

“I can only leave with peace of mind after I settle all your matters!”

Wang Xian said to Xiao Yu with a smile on his face.

“Brother, are you going to the transcendental continent?”

Xiao Yu frowned and said to Wang Xian.

“Just settle your matters and it will be over. There are no longer any opponents on earth and the development of the Dragon Palace is about to reach a bottleneck. Therefore, let’s go to Feng Luan’s world to take a look!”

Wang Xian said with a smile as he thought of Feng Luan who had left Earth for two years.

He wondered what the former empress was doing.

Xiao Yu was a little silent. “Brother, I’ll go with you when the time comes, right?”

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian patted Xiao Yu’s head lovingly. “I’ll go and take a look first. In the future, I’ll move the Dragon Palace to the entrance of that world. When the time comes, I’ll be able to come back directly from there!”

“When I’ve really established my footing in the transcendental continent, I’ll bring you guys there!”

“Brother, you have to be more careful in the future!”

Xiao Yu said worriedly.

“Don’t Worry!”

Wang Xian smiled. “It’s not like I want to go there now. Besides, I won’t Die!”

With the ancestral tree and the soul-returning wood, Wang Xian could revive in the Dragon Palace even if his physical body was damaged on the transcendence continent. When that time came, he would be a hero again.

He was filled with curiosity towards the transcendence continent.

According to the empress, the transcendence continent could only be considered as a real step into cultivation if one became a transcendent. Above the transcendence, there was the profound void. Above the profound void, there was longevity!

In that world, there were as many experts as the clouds and as many experts as the rain.

The so-called immortals and gods of Earth were just small figures in that world.

There were powerful dragons, Old Demons who had lived for tens of thousands of years, and countless treasures.

The sky was high enough for birds to fly, and the sea was wide enough for dragons to roam!

Xiao Yu nodded slowly.

“Okay!”

Xiao Yu nodded. She knew that her brother had powerful treasures. Even if he died, he could be resurrected in the Dragon Palace. This made her feel much more assured.

“Reporting to Dragon King, the entire ocean is under the control of our Dragon Palace. All the sea areas are under our control!”

At this moment, Prime Minister Gui came to the Dragon King’s palace excitedly and reported to Wang Xian.

“All of them?”

A smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face.

“It’s the Dragon King. Including the South Pole and the North Pole, all of them are under the control of our Dragon Palace. In addition, I plan to build an underwater city to form a true underwater culture!”

Prime Minister Gui’s eyes were full of luster as he spoke.

“Build a city?”

Wang Xian’s eyes were also sparkling. With the impact of the spiritual energy, many creatures on the seabed had evolved.

Under his guidance and the guidance of the civil officials of the Dragon Palace, millions of aquatic creatures had already developed their intelligence.

Build an underwater city to build a perfect underwater civilization.

“Alright, we will build a city around our dragon palace. Oh right, the Dragon Palace will be transferred to the entrance of the extraordinary mainland soon. The city will be planned there!”

Wang Xian nodded and said.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded immediately.

Ding! “Congratulations to the host for unifying the Earth’s oceans and completing the side mission of unifying the oceans of Ten Thousand Worlds. The reward is the dragon seed, the Thorned Dragon!”

At this moment, the system’s voice rang out suddenly. Wang Xian was stunned for a moment before an excited expression appeared on his face.

Dragon Seed, Thorned Dragon!

“The mission of unifying the Earth’s oceans has been completed. The reward is dragon seed, Thorned Dragon!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled. His heart skipped a beat as the information of the Dragon Palace appeared in his mind. Dragon Palace: Level 2

“As expected, there’s an additional thorned dragon species in the Dragon Palace.”

Wang Xian looked at the information in the Dragon Palace and focused his attention on the thorned dragon.

Thorned Dragon: wandering in the light and darkness, Walker of Light and darkness, Reaper of slaughter.

A message and an image appeared in Wang Xian’s mind.

This image was of a monster that was half-light and half-darkness.

It wasn’t much different from the strange demon’s body size. It was about one to two meters in size, but it had sharp claws.

Unlike the strange demon, this thorned dragon had a sharp claw on one arm and a scythe-like one on the other.

Half Light, half darkness, it was very strange!
