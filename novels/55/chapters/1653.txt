Chapter 1654: 1654 met the little princess again

Just as Wang Xian was studying the induction compass in his hand, a voice came from the back.

“Huh? There’s someone there!”

“Clang! Clang! Clang!”

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

At this moment, more than 20 figures surrounded him quickly. A murderous aura was condensed.

“There’s no sign of the fire Lark clan. They’re enemies!”

“Haha, I didn’t expect to meet a stray fish!”

Cold murderous aura and arrogant expression charged at Wang Xian. Waves of Aura locked onto him completely.

Each of them was an expert at the Seethrough level. The weakest was at level one of the Seethrough level, while the strongest was at level five of the Seethrough level. They were all young men.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. He turned around and looked at everyone around him.

They were dressed in white and there was a fiery red flame on their chests. Each of them had an arrogant look on their faces.

Among them, there were five to six young men and women dressed in fiery red clothes.

In the middle of the room stood two to three young men dressed in white and a young girl dressed in fiery red clothes.

Seeing that they were surrounding him, Wang Xian smiled faintly.

“I’m not the enemy!”

Wang Xian said faintly.

“If a cunning person wants to live, he won’t say that he’s our enemy because he wants to Live!”

A young man in the center stared at Wang Xian with an indifferent expression.

“Do it!”

He ordered faintly.

“Haha, I’ll take his head!”

A young man moved and slashed at Wang Xian. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Eh? Wait, Wait!”

Suddenly, the young girl standing in the middle widened her eyes and shouted loudly while staring at Wang Xian in astonishment.

“Big Brother Wang Xian, it’s You? Big Brother Wang Xian!”

Just as Wang Xian was about to leave, a soft voice was heard.

Big Brother?

Only a child or a little Lolita would call him that, right? Why would someone call him that.

He paused and looked at the young girl with a whip as he sized her up.

It felt familiar...

“Be careful!”

At this moment, the young girl shouted out loud again.

Beside Wang Xian, the young man at the first level of the Seethrough realm was thrusting his flaming longsword at him.

Wang Xian took a glance at him and an illusory Taiji diagram appeared around him.

When the young man’s attack landed on it, it was as though he had stabbed an indestructible rock.

“You Are... A Little Loli?”

At this moment, Wang Xian recalled the face of the fire lark queen. He looked at the young girl and shouted.

The Princess of the fire Lark Clan had this little loli when she first met Feng Luan.

At that time, the Little Loli had yet to reach adulthood. Now, nearly four years had passed and the Little Loli had actually grown into a young girl.

It was really true. A girl would change eighteen times as she grew up!

“It’s really you, Big Brother Wang Xian!”

When Huo Luo'er saw that Wang Xian recognized her, her face was filled with smiles. She immediately walked over to him.

The young man who was attacking Wang Xian at the side was embarrassed. His attack was completely blocked, and the flaming longsword landed on it without leaving a single trace.

When he saw that the young man knew the Little Princess of the fire Lark clan, he withdrew the flaming longsword in embarrassment.

“Huo Luo'er, you know him?”

The young man standing beside Huo Luo'er raised his eyebrows slightly and walked over immediately. His gaze was fixed on Wang Xian.

“I know him!”

Huo Luo'er replied casually and walked to Wang Xian’s side with a smile on her face.

“Brother Wang Xian, when did you come to our fire Lark Clan?”

Huo Luo'er asked with a face full of surprise and joy.

“I’ve been here for a few days. I didn’t expect the Little Loli at that time to have grown so big now!”

Wang Xian patted her head and said with a smile.

“I’ve grown up, yet you still Pat My Head!”

Huo Luo'er glared at him and said coquettishly.

When Huo Luo'er saw Wang Xian, she indeed felt very friendly because she was with the Empress!

A few years ago, she was still very dependent on the empress.

“That’s right. She has grown up and is now on the battlefield!”

Wang Xian sighed slightly. The Innocent Little Loli who was not even aware that she was being used by others back then was now on the battlefield.

“That’s right. I have killed quite a few enemies!”

Huo Luo nodded her head heavily.

“Huo Luo'er, who is he?”

At this moment, the young man beside her asked with an unpleasant expression.

“Oh, this is a good friend of one of my elder sisters!”

Huo Luo'er was slightly taken aback before she replied.

She knew that she could not tell anyone about the empress.

“Oh, is that so?”

Upon hearing Huo Luo'er’s words, the young man beside her smiled.

“I am lie Hanshan from the sacred fire tribe!”

Lie Hanshan looked at Wang Xian indifferently and said proudly.

In his opinion, Huo Luo didn’t have a biological sister, so she could only be a sister in the clan. The friends of those people should be the disciples of the subsidiary forces of the Fire Lark clan.

He didn’t need to take a disciple of a subsidiary force to heart.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly.

“Okay?”

However, lie Hanshan frowned slightly when he saw Wang Xian’s attitude. A hint of displeasure appeared on his face.

“Brother Wang Xian, are you alone? Then, come with us. We will go and kill the enemies together!”

At this moment, Huo Luo'er said to Wang Xian.

“Come with us. We are the most elite disciples of the sacred flame clan, especially our young master lie Hanshan. He is a dragon among men and has the strength of a fifth-level void interpretation!”

“When the time comes, we can bring you to kill more enemies and obtain some rewards!”

A young man from the Sacred Flame clan looked at lie Hanshan and said proudly.

“Follow our words and follow our orders. We can bring you along!”

When lie Hanshan heard the disciple’s words, the corner of his mouth curled up slightly as he said condescendingly.

“Hehe, a dragon among men? There’s no need!”

“Little Loli, I will act on my own. I will not follow you!”

Wang Xian glanced at them and landed on Huo Luo'er.

“How can we do that? It’s so dangerous here. That voice just now was an enemy at the ninth level of the Void Interpretation Stage!”

“Follow us. We have a detection array so we can know the opponent’s strength in advance!”

Huo Luo'er looked at him and said immediately.

Lie Hanshan’s face turned cold when he heard his words.

“Huo Luo'er, since he doesn’t appreciate your kindness, let him act on his own. In this battlefield, he might not even know how he died!”

A young man from the Sacred Flame clan glanced at Wang Xian and said.

“This...”

“You guys can come together. I’m going to act now. Be careful!”

Huo Luo'er wanted to say something but was interrupted by Wang Xian. He patted her head.

“Brother Wang Xian, give me the contact details of the communication stone plate. I’ll contact you when I Get Back!”

Huo Luo'er said immediately.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded and gave her the contact details. He waved his hand at her and left.

“Huo Luo'er, is he very strong?”

Lie Hanshan saw Wang Xian leaving. He squinted his eyes and asked Huo Luo'er.

“He should be very strong!”

Huo Luo'er said with uncertainty.

“A Peerless Heaven’s favorite? A dragon among men? At such a young age, how can he be as strong as our young master lie Hanshan?”

A young man asked Huo Luo'er.

Huo Luo'er shook her head, indicating that she didn’t know.

However, in the eyes of the rest, it was a different answer. It was better!

“Hehe!”

Lie Hanshan smiled coldly.

“Let’s continue. I heard that we have a hunting ranking here. I want to climb up this ranking!”

He said to the surrounding people with a proud face, his face full of confidence.

As the son of a founding general family of an empire, he had the right to be proud.

Even if he ran into the core disciples of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop!
