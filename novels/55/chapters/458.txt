Chapter 459: The Battle of The Ages (5)

“What if you count our Xiao Clan in?”

A kiddy voice came from behind, followed by an immense aura shrouding over Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan.

There was no slightest attempt to conceal their strong fighting spirit and killing intent.

Xiao Ran swept his cold gaze across everyone before him as he ran towards Wang Xian. “Master!”

“Mm!”

Wang Xian looked at Xiao Ran with a smile and a nod before he turned to Xiao Quanshan.

“Xiao Clan will only strike once for such a lineup!”

The baldy Xiao Quanshan grinned as he was slightly relieved upon seeing the people from Sui Clan.

It was not his idea to take part in this battle of the Sacred Sects.

After all, this was a Saint-class battle. If something went wrong, the entire Sacred Clan would suffer a huge loss.

Too bad he had promised Xiao Ran, that little fellow, that he had the right to mobilize the enforcement elder team in the clan.

If he allowed Xiao Ran to bring the dozen-odd elders here, that was as good as seeking death. Hence, he simply brought all the people from Xiao Clan here.

“Uncle Xiao!”

When the eldest son of Sui Huang spotted the arrival of Xiao Clan, his eyes were filled with pleasant surprise. Hurriedly, he greeted him.

“Mm, where’s Sui Huang, that old fellow?” asked Xiao Quanshan.

“My father is abroad and couldn’t make it back!” the old man replied.

“Xiao Quanshan, don’t tell me the Xiao Clan is intervening too!”

Laozu of Qiao Clan spoke in a cold voice as he stared at Xiao Quanshan with a darkened expression.

“So what if we do? Damn, can’t you see we’re already here?”

Xiao Quanshan fired his rage at Laozu of Qiao Clan. He looked at the two Supreme Elders of Medical Saint Sect with wariness. “Hmph, think this over carefully. If a battle were to break out today, it’s a losing end for both parties!”

“Ninety-odd Inborn Experts are going to perish over here. Think about it!”

“Xiao Clan, are you making an enemy with the Medical Saint Sect?”

The Supreme Elder stared daggers at Xiao Quanshan with a frozen face.

“I’m not scared!” Xiao Quanshan widened his mouth. “If it’s between Xiao Clan and Medical Saint Sect, I may have my concerns. But now, I have Sui Clan and Dragon Sect on the same side. Why should I fear you all?”

“Well, well. Xiao Clan and Sui Clan, it looks like you all are going up against the Medical Saint Sect!”

The Supreme Elder of Medical Saint Sect was looking menacing.

The appearance of Sui Clan and Xiao Clan had completely disrupted their plans. None of them had expected that the Dragon Sect could invite two Sacred Clans for assistance.

“No wonder you dare to be insolent, killing the future successor of our Medical Saint Sect’s Sect Master and bragging to us!”

Radiance flickered in the eyes of the Supreme Elder of Medical Saint Sect as he stared at the gang before him.

Combining three Sacred Sects, Dragon Sect, Xiao Clan, and Sui Clan, would make more than ninety Inborn Experts on their side.

With one Dan Realm expert, Xiao Quanshan, and the possibility of the Dragon King to be a Dan Realm Expert being eighty percent.

They had greater repression with three against two Dan Realm experts.

However, the battle between Inborn Experts would be a close margin even if they won.

Apparently, Laozu of Qiao Clan realized this as his expression slowly grimaced.

Things had gone far beyond their expectations. With the appearance of Xiao Clan and Sui Clan, they leveled their overpowering strength.

None of them would have thought that the young Clan Leader of Xiao Clan, aka the current youngest Inborn Expert, would be the disciple of the Dragon King!

If a battle were to break out, Qiao Clan would receive a huge blow. Towards the end, those surviving Inborn Experts might not number more than five.

Three unparalleled experts had a dramatic change in their expressions. They did not dare to act recklessly as the price was too huge to pay!

The two Sect Masters of Medical Saint Sect were so infuriated that their bodies trembled.

Their enemy was right before their eyes, yet they could not strike under such circumstances.

They were clear that the damage of Medical Saint Sect was beyond imagination once they made their moves. They may not lose their Sacred status, but a massive loss was guaranteed without a doubt.

“How is this possible?”

The experts from the seven forces, including Wu Family, had terror in their eyes.

Xiao Clan and Sui Clan had come to support the Dragon Sect.

The legendary Clan Leader of Xiao Clan was the disciple of Dragon King.

Even if they could rough it out today, they would only be left with high numbers of casualties.

If they did not start the fight today, how could they resist the Dragon Sect when they seek revenge in the future?

Unlike Medical Saint Sect or Qiao Clan, they were just first-class forces that could not afford to have a Sacred Sect seeking them out to take revenge.

In particular, from such a powerful Dragon Sect.

A touch of despair surged in their hearts.

Given such a situation now, when a fight was unlikely to break out, they could only dismiss clans, ancestral sects, and run! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

This was the only way.

“Dragon King of Dragon Sect, we’ll mark this grudge since we have plenty of time ahead!” said the two Supreme Elders of Medical Saint Sect coldly as they glowered at Wang Xian with icy eyes.

“Without Xiao Clan and Sui Clan, the Dragon Sect would be annihilated today!”

Laozu of Qiao Clan stared daggers at Wang Xian.

“Oh?” Wang Xian looked at them with interest. His face was full of a teasing look.

“Hmph, let’s go!”

The Supreme Elders of Medical Saint Sect cast a murderous gaze at Wang Xian before they told the disciples behind them this with a twisted expression.

“Let’s go!” said Laozu of Qiao Clan with a wry look.

Phew!

All the disciples heaved a sigh of relief. It would only be a bloodbath today if they really engaged in a battle today. No one could guarantee their survival.

“Hehe!” Sensing their departing intention, Wang Xian sneered as he lifted his chin slightly. “Did I allow you all to go?”

“Hur?”

“Hur?”

Did I allow you all to go?

All of them were stunned. The Supreme Elders of Medical Saint Sect, Laozu of Qiao Clan, and the rest of the disciples frowned as they turned around with cold faces.

Even the people from Sui Clan and Xiao Clan knit their eyebrows together.

Xiao Quanshan fixed his eyes on Wang Xian with his eyebrows locked. “They are not weaker than us in terms of strength. In fact, they might be even stronger than us!”

“Old Xiao, and people from Sui Clan, the Dragon Sect is very grateful that all of you turned up today. We’ll repay the help you rendered to us today in the future.” Wang Xian beamed at them. “However, since Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan are present today, they don’t have to leave anymore. You all can just stay by the side and look!”

Wang Xian spoke flatly as the Dragonians beside him walked forward.

Wang Xian spun around as he fixed his cold eyes on the Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan. Killing intent flashed in his eyes. “Since the disciples of Medical Saint Sect dared to ambush me, so what if I kill your disciples? If you’re here to annihilate me, then I can only exterminate the Medical Saint Sect in return. As for Qiao Clan, this was your end the moment you accepted the killing order of the Medical Saint Sect!”

“Since you have come all the way here, then none of you shall leave today.”

“Haha!” He chuckled as he said, “Three Dan Realm Experts with Ninety Inborn Experts. Today, all of you will wage a battle with the Dragon Sect.”

“This place will be a grave for all of you!”

Wang Xian’s dominance swept across all of them as a bout of murderous aura loomed over the entire island!
