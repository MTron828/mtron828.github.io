Chapter 1519: 1519 passed down the idea

“Give you all a chance? Am I not thinking straight?”

Wang Xian looked at the more than 20 people in the judgement mercenary group and said slowly.

His words once again stunned everyone around him.

Not thinking straight?

What kind of thinking was not thinking straight?

“Sir, what do you have to do to be able to forgive us?”

The leader of the judgement mercenary group’s expression changed slightly. He took a deep breath and spoke respectfully once again.

They had experienced the terror of this young man earlier. He was sure that this young man in front of him had the strength of the insightful void stage.

With such an expert, even a radiant priest would be able to destroy them.

“I became a radiant priest so that I wouldn’t kill!”

Wang Xian looked at them and said slowly.

His words caused the expressions of the people around him to change again.

Old Hu was stunned. He looked at Wang Xian and felt a familiar feeling.

This feeling was similar to the feeling he had when he cultivated the power of darkness and was invaded by the darkness in the ruins of the divine kingdom a long time ago.

“Then what do you want to Do?”

Li Si asked loudly with an embarrassed expression when she heard Wang Xian’s words.

“Purify all of you, purify all the filth, purify all the Evil!”

Wang Xian slowly raised the scepter of light in his hand. A Ray of light shot towards them directly.

“Not good!”

“You... you...”

The Ray of light shot towards everyone in the judgement mercenary group, causing their faces to reveal a look of horror instantly.

The great joy of surviving the calamity was enveloped by this dazzling ray of light.

However, the expressions on their faces were completely frozen.

Ashes to Ashes, dust to dust.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The sound of weapons falling could be heard. It was as if they had hit the hearts of everyone around them.

The old woman, three women, and four girls looked over in a daze. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Especially the girl who was standing beside Li Si. She stared at Wang Xian in fear.

“You... why did you kill them... didn’t you say no...”

Her eyes were filled with fear as she cried out involuntarily.

“Uncle Hu, purification isn’t killing, right?”

Wang Xian smiled and said to Old Hu who was standing at the side.

This made old Hu slightly stunned. Following that, a bitter smile appeared on his face. “It doesn’t count, it doesn’t count. Purification is purifying all filth and evil. It’s not killing!”

He was the one who told Wang Xian this sentence.

He didn’t feel anything when Wang Xian purified the judgement mercenary group.

Not only were these people the first to escape when they were in danger, they even wanted to use them to resist for some time.

For such people, it was fine to purify them!

Now, he already had some guesses in his heart as to why this mysterious young man would say those strange words to him.

Slaughter, darkness, evil, purification...

“There’s no one left, and you still say that this isn’t slaughter... you...”

When the girl heard Wang Xian’s ridiculous words, her expression turned a little awkward.

“A person like you is really annoying!”

Wang Xian looked at the girl and said expressionlessly.

“What? You... What are you doing? Don’t kill me, no... Don’t...”

Seeing Wang Xian’s expressionless face, the girl panicked. Only then did she realize what kind of person she was talking to.

She was talking to a madman, a madman.

Killing wasn’t called killing, it was called purifying!

Just now, he had said that he was disgusted and had directly purified everyone in the judgement mercenary group. Now, would he...

When she thought of this, she was completely terrified. Her body went limp as she begged for mercy.

“You should go. I’ve Saved Your Life and you still don’t know how to repay me. A person like you has no right to follow us!”

Old Hu looked at the girl and said directly.

He looked at Wang Xian and didn’t say anything.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and looked at the old lady and the rest. “Let’s continue on our journey!”

“Alright!”

The old lady nodded her head quickly and looked at Old Hu.

Old Hu nodded his head at her.

“Let’s go, young man. Let’s get in the car and let them drive us for a while. We will be there in a few hours!”

Old Hu patted Wang Xian on the shoulder and the two of them walked over.

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment before nodding his head with a smile.

The old lady heaved a sigh of relief when she saw them enter.

“This... a simple mission actually attracted such a terrifying young man. However, it’s fortunate that we have this young man. Otherwise, we would have been dead already!”

A woman exclaimed.

From the beginning, they felt that this young man had a gentle expression and a good temper.

They had thought that this young man might be weak.

But in the blink of an eye, he had annihilated the entire judgement mercenary group. No, he had cleansed them.

The word “Cleansed”was indeed quite suitable to be used just now.

The judgement mercenary group was just a bunch of trash.

“Let’s go. That young man saved our lives. We must know how to be grateful!”

The old woman’s eyes flickered as she nodded. As she spoke slowly, she went to the carriage and personally drove it.

Her gaze swept past the girl who was still in shock and left immediately.

As for her life and death, it would depend on herself.

That was because others had already saved you once.

“Young man, were you invaded by the Soul of Darkness?”

In the carriage, old Hu looked at Wang Xian curiously and asked.

“Soul of Darkness?”

Wang Xian was slightly taken aback as he looked at Old Hu in astonishment.

He had a very good impression of Old Hu. Although there was a huge age difference between the two of them, they were always able to chat together.

Moreover, it was also because of old Hu that he was able to release a few shackles.

“Aren’t you? “The Soul of Darkness is a group of evil spirits in the ruins of the divine kingdom. They are formed from the darkness attribute, giving birth to spiritual intelligence. They are violent and brutal. Once they are invaded by the soul of darkness, they will lose their rationality if they can’t withstand it

“In the ruins of the Kingdom of God, thousands of people lose their rationality and die every year after being invaded by the soul of darkness. You look very similar to me, but you can suppress yourself a little!”

Lao Hu continued to speak to Wang Xian.

“Soul of Darkness? Then my situation is similar to this. If I am under intense stimulation or if I kill too many people, I will lose my rationality too!”

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment before nodding his head.

“It is very difficult to be invaded by the soul of darkness. I can only rely on myself to maintain my mind. If I am strong enough, I might be able to get rid of it!”

“Young man, in your current state, you are already very good. It is not bad to be a priest of light. Do you still plan to follow us to the Holy Medicine Clinic?”

Old Hu asked Wang Xian.

“Yes, of course. I’m basically not losing my mind now. I’m Looking for a complete solution!”

Wang Xian said ambiguously.

Although his current condition was different from the soul of darkness that Old Hu mentioned, it was somewhat similar.

Going to the clinic would allow him to have a better understanding of the darkness attribute and the light attribute.
