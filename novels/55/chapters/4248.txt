“Let’s break through! ”

Wang Xian smiled when he heard Huming Mountain’s words!Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Huming mountain bowed to Wang Yun on his knees.

Just like the floating queen back then, he bowed respectfully.

After that, he stood up and hovered in the air.

Boom

His body trembled and the surrounding energy surged towards his surroundings!

The world changed color as the breakthrough began!

In the mountain universe, the four heaven origin creation realm experts sighed in their hearts when they saw this scene.

Their mountain universe would have one less spot in the future.

This was the mountain universe’s foundation.

However, compared to the current situation, it was already the best!

Even if the Justice Sequence Alliance came to seek help, the situation wouldn’t be any better than now!

The Dragon King and the others only wanted one spot.

‘Ine Justice sequence Alliance wantea two spots! Overall, this was the most ideal situation!

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom

Boom! Boom! Boom

Rumbling sounds rang out, causing huge tremors.

“What’s going on?”

“Heaven and earth energy is converging. What is this? Is there an expert in our mountain universe making a breakthrough?”

“It’s at the center of Our Mountain Range Universe, where the four saints are.

Could it be that our mountain range universe has given birth to another

Tianyuan Creation Realm Powerhouse?”

“A Tianyuan creation realm powerhouse, can it alleviate the situation in front of us? Can it expel the invaders?”

“It’s very difficult. The strength of the invaders from the evil sequence camp is too terrifying. Even if our mountain range universe has one more Tianyuan creation realm powerhouse, it’s still very difficult to be their match! ”

In the surrounding area, countless strong disciples from the mountain range universe were discussing in shock when they saw the strong cultivator making a breakthrough.

“Disciple, do not approach. Today, our mountain range universe has the help of the strong cultivator. The crisis has already been resolved by half. ”

A Heaven origin creation stage powerhouse from the mountain range universe spoke!

His words caused the strong disciples from the entire mountain range universe to be in an uproar.

Wang Xian ignored the shock of the strong disciples in the mountain range universe.

He quietly watched the Tiger Roar Mountain’s breakthrough!

However, around the center of the mountain range universe.

The five heaven origin creation stage powerhouses from the Blood Naga universe were gathered there. Their expressions were abnormally ugly. Two heaven origin creation stage powerhouses were ambushed and killed.

Now, they were in a state of resurrection and recuperation.

Now, there were only five heaven origin creation stage powerhouses.

The five of them looked towards the center of the mountain range universe. When they saw this powerful force, their expressions kept changing.

They naturally knew that someone had broken through to the heaven origin creation realm!

This also meant that there were currently six heaven origin creation realm experts in the mountain range universe.

The most terrifying thing was that one of them had the strength of a Great Dao.

“We are no longer their match! ”

A heavenly fate realm expert from the Blood Naga universe said in a deep voice.

They had laid out their plans here for so long, but they did not expect that a great dao realm expert would appear.

This caused their entire universe to fall short!

This made them feel extremely helpless!

“Retreat, with that Great Dao realm expert around, they will not be able to

“Moreover, if the other party counterattacks us, our disciples will suffer heavy casualties! ”

The Heavenly Yuan creation experts of the Blood Naga universe made a prompt decision.

If the other party counterattacked, they wouldn’t be a match at all.

They could escape, but their disciples would probably suffer heavy casualties.

“Retreat!”

They immediately gave the order and prepared to immediately retreat from the mountain range universe.

Not long after, Huming Mountain’s breakthrough was completed!

He took a deep breath and his face was filled with excitement.

After transforming into his human form, huming mountain bowed to Wang Xian once again!

Wang Xian smiled and nodded his head!

“Dragon King, according to our investigation in the heaven-looking bronze mirror, the Blood Naga universe has already begun to retreat! ”

At this moment, the four heaven origin creation powerhouses from the mountain ridge universe had also sensed the situation of the blood Naga universe army.

They were also excited.

“That’s good. I’ll stay here for another ten years and leave in ten years. Next, if the Blood Naga universe attacks you again, you can inform me!”

(‘I have treasures here. I can rush over immediately! ”

Wang Xian spoke to them!

“Thank you, Dragon King. We will prepare all the resources in a few hours for you in the palace that you invited US to prepare for you! ”

The Heaven origin creation stage powerhouses from the mountain range universe said happily!

Although they had paid a great price.

However, if they could get to know a powerhouse at the level of the Dragon King, they might be able to survive this calamity safely!

“Alright! ”

Wang Xian nodded his head and looked at huming mountain. “We will return after ten years!”

“I will follow your orders, Dragon King! ”

Huming Mountain replied respectfully!

Wang Xian nodded his head and followed the powerhouses from the mountain range universe to a grand hall!

It was the highest mountain peak in the entire mountain range universe and the most luxurious Grand Hall!

A few hours later, the four powerhouses from the heaven origin creation realm in the mountain range universe brought over all the resources.

“Dragon King, these are our resources. Please take a look! ”

The four powerhouses of the Heaven’s origin realm handed over the resources respectfully and said!

Wang Xian nodded his head. After receiving the resources and taking a look, he nodded his head in satisfaction.

“By the way, do you know where we can exchange for resources?”

Wang Xian looked at them and asked.

Although the mountain universe was not very strong, they were a faction of the Justice Sequence Alliance. They should have some understanding in this aspect!

“Exchange of resources? Dragon King, we can exchange resources within the Justice Sequence Alliance. Our Justice Sequence Alliance has a communication device that contains all kinds of information from different universes. ” “Such as transactions, requests for help, some exchanges, etc. , etc. , etc. ! ”

The Heaven’s origin creator powerhouse from the mountain universe answered truthfully, “If you want to trade, you can do so too. The trade of the Justice Sequence Alliance is open to the public. As long as you are not from the evil sequence alliance, you can do so! ” “I’m from the Neutral Sequence Alliance.”

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly.

“Dragon King, we have a communication device here. However, in order to prevent the evil sequence alliance from obtaining it, we need to verify it.

Therefore, we have no way to give it to you. ”

“If you want to trade with the Justice Sequence Alliance, you have to go to the justice universe to obtain it. Many experts from the neutral sequence camp also trade with us. ”

“Of course, I heard that you can also trade with the evil sequence camp.” The experts from the mountain universe said to Wang Xian.

Both the evil sequence camp and the justice sequence camp had information exchange.

They make all kinds of deals that help them grow.

The nine-headed universe is a neutral alignment, so there’s no such connection..
