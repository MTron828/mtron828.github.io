Chapter 2913: During the performance of 2913

“What’s going on?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Hiss, look, the entire demonic army seems to have stopped!”

“Look at the eight demonic beasts at the peak of the godly monarch realm in front of us, they are actually roaring crazily. Their bodies are festering again, as if they are going to die!”

“This… what a terrifying attack, what is that thing!”

“It really makes one’s scalp tingle. What on Earth is that guy throwing out? The entire Demonic Beast Army seems to be infected by it!”

At this moment, all the glazed soldiers on the fighting ring stared with their eyes wide open. They were somewhat shocked as they looked ahead.

The eight peak-stage godly monarch-level demonic beasts were actually collapsing. Their vitality was rapidly disappearing.

The Demonic Beast Army of billions of soldiers stopped in the void. Extremely miserable sounds could be heard endlessly.

The entire demonic army seemed to have entered hell, and they let out miserable cries that came from their souls.

All the soldiers felt their scalps go numb when they saw this scene.

Only one billion of them could fight against this demonic army.

However, the thing that Kid took out could almost wipe out the entire demonic army.

The demonic army in front of them died one after another, and hundreds of millions of them fell.

After they died, their bodies looked extremely hideous and disgusting.

“It should be poison. Look at the Demonic Beasts’corpses. This is an extremely terrifying poison. Even peak-stage king God realm experts would die if they touched it. How terrifying!”

“This poison shouldn’t have been given to this brat by the vice-commander. The vice-commander wouldn’t have given such a dangerous thing to him.”

In front of the battle platform, several commanders said with their eyes full of shock.

The treasures that the annoying kid took out were more and more terrifying.

“Look, four-fifths of the entire demon Army has died.”

The shocked voice came from the surroundings, and all the soldiers watched in a daze.

The cowardly guy who disgusted them, who was as timid as a mouse, and who looked a little shameless, had almost destroyed an entire demon army.

One had to know that even their third legion could not achieve such a feat.

“Oh?”

In the void at the very front, the besieged Shangshui Divine Emperor and the fourth supreme elder also sensed the situation over here. They swept their minds and revealed astonished expressions.

“Good, good, good. Invincible, I can still hold on for a while!”

An excited expression appeared on Shangshui divine emperor’s face. He knew that this disciple of his must have obtained something good from the Dragon Palace to save his life.

However, this thing was a little fierce!

“Good!”

The fourth supreme elder also revealed a smile.

Once the soldiers were certain of their safety, they could also escape.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

However, at this moment, the three rank one divine emperor demonic beasts that surrounded Shangshui divine emperor suddenly attacked the invincible battle technique.

“Not good!”

Shangshui divine emperor, who had been passively defending, had a huge change in expression. He hurriedly moved to block.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

However, at this moment, the other two rank one god Emperor Abyss seeds suddenly became vicious and pounced towards him.

The expression of the upper water god Emperor was horrified. His body was swept away by the energy.

“Pu!”

He spat out a mouthful of fresh blood.

“Invincible, hurry up and escape!”

The Upper Water God Emperor roared loudly. His face revealed an anxious expression.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

That rank one void god-emperor demonic evil that was around 5,000 meters in size and looked like a mantis stared at the invincible battle technique in front of him. His figure flashed as he charged over at an abnormally terrifying speed.

“Not good, a god-emperor demonic evil has its eyes on that brat!”

“Oh no, he has been locked onto a space by a god-emperor. Even if he wanted to return to his own God country, he would not be able to do so!”

“It’s over. It’s a pity that that kid is done for. Although it’s disgusting, he did it beautifully just now!”

On the battle platform, the soldiers’expressions changed drastically when they saw a rank one divine emperor demonic beast attacking invincible battle technique.

It was too easy for the divine emperor to kill a divine king expert. He couldn’t even escape even if he wanted to.

“F * ck!”

Invincible battle technique sensed that he was enveloped by a great terror. His body trembled as he cursed. With a wave of his arm, he kept the dragon weapon into his interspatial ring.

Before he could take out a treasure to defend himself, he saw a huge claw falling toward his head.

“Please Bless Me!”

Such a terrifying speed did not allow unrivaled battle technique to have any reaction. He could only stand there in a daze.

“It’s over!”

When second senior sister saw this scene, her face turned pale and she hurriedly closed her eyes.

On the fighting ring, all the soldiers frowned slightly. They looked at each other and sighed in their hearts.

“Boom!”

A terrifying collision sound was heard. The figure of invincible in battle technique was sent flying dozens of kilometers backward.

However, there was no injury on his body at all.

At this moment, the venerable mark on his body was emitting a blood-red light. Behind him, there was a blood-red shadow that was about ten thousand meters in size that enveloped him.

“Hahaha, you are indeed powerful. Ga Ga Ga!”

Seeing that there were no injuries on his body and sensing the majestic phantom that was surrounding him, invincible battle technique revealed an extremely excited expression.

“Little Bastard, you still dare to attack this young master? Don’t you see who is protecting this young master!”

Invincible battle technique floated in the void and pointed his middle finger at the mantis-like first level God Emperor Yao Xie as he roared disdainfully.

“This is? This is a defensive true treasure. It can actually resist an attack at the level of a god Emperor!”

“Damn, how many treasures does that guy have? He actually has such a true treasure!”

In front of the battle platform, the group of battle group leaders could not help but curse when they saw this scene. They shouted in shock.

It was an extremely powerful water-elemental cannonball divine weapon with extremely terrifying poison.

And now, he had taken out a protective treasure that could defend against a divine emperor’s attack.

This fellow’s entire body was filled with treasures. This was too awesome.

“This fellow has so many treasures!”

All the glazed soldiers sighed in their hearts.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

However, at this moment, the mantis-like first rank divine emperor Yao Xie saw that his battle technique was unharmed. His bloodthirsty gaze stared at the illusory figure that was enveloping him. A sinister expression appeared on his face.

His body moved once again, and he pounced towards invincible battle technique.

“Do you really think that I’m easy to bully?”

Invincible battle technique revealed an angry expression when he saw that the demonic beast was attacking him once again.

With a move of his palm, the resplendent immortal slaying gourd appeared in his hand.

Without the slightest hesitation, he pulled out the gourd’s cover, and with a thought,.

Numerous wind attribute law-type immortal slaying swords attacked the rank one celestial emperor in front of him at a terrifying speed.

Half of the wind-attribute immortal slaying swords that had been accumulated for two years flew out.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The moment the immortal slaying swords appeared, the rank one celestial emperor felt the threat of death.

A look of fear appeared in his eyes. He wanted to stop and escape.

However, the distance between them was too close. The immortal slaying swords were too fast!

“Sou Sou Sou Sou!”

The 13 immortal slaying swords instantly covered the area.

Each of the immortal slaying swords could unleash the offensive power of a rank one god Emperor.

This was equivalent to the 13 god Emperors attacking at the same time.

And this was before the rank one god Emperor could react!

“Pu Pu Pu!”

At the next moment, the 13 immortal slaying swords pierced through its body.

“Ao!”

A painful scream came from the rank one demonic emperor’s mouth.

His life force was fading at a terrifying speed, and his body was slowly falling down.

The rank one demonic emperor had fallen.

When invincible in battle saw this scene, his heart was beating rapidly. He pursed his lips and slightly raised his head.

“You’re courting death. Who Do you want to mess with? You want to mess with me?”

He pretended to be calm.
