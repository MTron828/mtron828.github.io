Chapter 553: My Name Will Start To Spread (2)

“Go ahead with your practice. I’ll give you another sword!”

After they went back to Mt. Fengyu, Mentor Yu spoke to Wang Xian with a radiant look after taking a look at the longsword in his hand.

“Yes, Mentor Yu!”

Wang Xian nodded and suspended his sword in the air. He took the sword at his feet and rode to the waterfall.

“Let’s hope he will bring some hope to Mt. Fengyu by advancing to Dan Realm!”

Seeing Wang Xian’s figure, Mentor Yu sighed with flickering radiance in her eyes.

Shoo!

The speed of Wang Xian riding on the sword was so fast that he was quickly at the waterfall.

More than a score of Mt. Fengyu’s disciples were training over there while Wang Xian flew into the air above them.

Upon seeing Wang Xian riding his sword and overlooking them in the air, the group of disciples was slightly pissed off.

His act was an obvious show of contempt for all of them. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Hey, why are you doing up there? Get over here for your training!”

Yu Ling’er called out to Wang Xian, irked when she saw him.

Wang Xian looked at Yu Ling’er and swept his gaze across all the people. With a faint smile, he said, “You guys are just too weak, show me what you’ve got!”

You guys are just too weak, show me what you’ve got?

What he said just struck more than twenty disciples with extreme self-contempt, and everyone froze.

Even Yu Ling’er and Hua Yu, who’d been defeated in the morning, was caught by an unexpected surprise.

“Brat, what did you just say?”

Yu Ling’er pointed the sword in her hand at him as she spoke with anger.

“Nothing, I just want you guys to show me what you’ve got!”

Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam!

As Wang Xian remarked, figures that looked exactly like Wang Xian suddenly popped out from behind the waterfall.

In a brief moment, more than twenty water clones emerged.

“Show me what you’ve got!”

Without giving them any time to hesitate, he struck at the group of people below.

“Fu*k, who the hell do you think you are!?”

“Damn you, how dare you talk big and challenge all of us!”

“What an arrogant guy!”

The disciples were infuriated upon seeing the disdainful look on Wang Xian, who was charging toward them.

Yu Ling’er was livid as she said, “You’re looking for a beating!”

“Just show me your Inborn-level capability and try all your Sword Techniques on me!”

Wang Xian drew his lips slightly. Since he needed to become a genius over here, he had to convince all the disciples of Mt, Fengyu!

Burst!

Bam!

In an instant, two water clones exploded into water vapor, enveloping the surroundings within a range of a thousand meters.

Everyone was shrouded in the water mist.

However, it did not affect them at all.

“Hmph, how dare you challenge all of us alone. You’re really a brazen fellow. Today, let me teach you a lesson!”

Hua Yu scowled at Wang Xian furiously.

His entire body was emitting azure blue radiance while a fogless space showed up around him. Hua Yu had not taken his eyes off from Wang Xian.

“Illusory sword!”

Wang Xian looked at all of them while the water mist convened into thousands of Illusory swords.

In creating this many Illusory swords with Inborn-level strength, the damage of these swords was too sparsely spread.

“These Illusory swords have no power. Ignore them!” a disciple called out loudly.

“Take care of this brazen fellow!” over a score of disciples exclaimed together.

“He’s up there!”

Needless to say, everyone locked onto Wang Xian and lurched at him.

With a smile, a water clone suddenly broke out an immense amount of energy ten meters away.

“Over there!”

Since Wang Xian was surrounded by water vapor, they could only rely on energy to lock onto his location.

More than a score of people thrust at that water clone instantly.

“Go!”

Wang Xian waved his sword in the air, and the Illusory swords behind the group started to solidify and turn into razor-edge water swords!

“Oh no, how can his water control ability be so strong!”

Whoosh!

Argh!

“Damm, that’s a fake one. The real one is here!”

“Oh no, this one is also fake!”

Argh!

“How can it be!?”

“Damm, he’s toying us!”

“This is impossible. How could he be so terrifying with his water control ability. Even Half-Step to Dan Realm experts are not that sick!”

Panic and incredulous voices were heard everywhere.

“You guys are just too weak!” Wang Xian said in a dull tone.

With a glimpse, he converted the Illusory swords into water swords, which landed behind Yu Ling’er and Hua Yu.

“Oh no, behind you!”

Bam, Bam, Bam!

A splashing sound was heard when some of the last disciples fell in the water.

Wang Xian swung his arm while the sword went back to his hand. All the Illusory swords around him disappeared as he looked at the twenty-odd disciples who were in the water.

“How is this possible? How can your Sword Technique be so powerful!”

Yu Ling’er stood in the water as she questioned Wang Xian loudly in disbelief.

“You’re not an Inborn. An Inborn would not have such strong power over water. Controlling water clones is not something easy, and an Inborn can’t create these numbers of Illusory swords!”

Hua Yu glowered at Wang Xian with red eyes as he questioned Wang Xian.

“What I just displayed was really Inborn-level strength!”

Wang Xian overlooked them. What he had shown just now was really Inborn-level strength. However, his energy was immense, and his water control ability was superb since he was a Divine Dragon.

“You guys are just weak!”

Still the same words. The group of people had heard him repeat the same line a few times.

A mixed expression was plastered on Yu Ling’er as she had not expected this at all. The young man who scared her to death was such a formidable character.

The rest of the twenty-odd disciples trembled slightly as they realized they’d lost to a new junior who’d just joined them.

Besides, the fact that he defeated twenty-odd people alone amazed them, and at the same time, struck panic into them.

“You, come over!”

Wang Xian pointed to Hua Yu.

“What? Me...me...”

Seeing Wang Xian pointing at him, Hua Yu was stunned, with trepidation in his eyes.

He was brought over in the morning, and now, Wang Xian had beaten them all single-handedly. Hua Yu was already unnerved at this moment. Seeing Wang Xian calling out for him, his consternation grew.

“Come over!” said Wang Xian flatly as he looked at Hua Yu.

“What do you want? Mentor Yu is coming. When she comes, she won’t spare you!”

Hua Yu looked at Wang Xian with the deepest fear as he staggered back involuntarily.

“I didn’t hurt you just now, and I won’t do it now either. Come over!”

Seeing Hua Yu’s behavior, Wang Xian shook his head with disdain.

“You... Fine, I’ll go!”

Hua Yu felt instant humiliation when he spotted the belittling look in his eyes. Gritting his teeth, he came forward to Wang Xian.

“How do you gain access to more resources?” asked Wang Xian straightaway.

“What? More resources?”

Hua Yu froze for a moment as this was an unexpected question from Wang Xian.

“Yes!” Wang Xian nodded.

“There are two ways to gain more cultivation resources. We can either improve our ranking among the sects or get into the top twenty in the individual ranking!” Hua Yu answered blankly.

“Hur? Is that so?”

“Yes, there’s no other way except these two!” Hua Yu nodded quickly, as he did not dare to hide any truth. Now, he was terrified of this aloof junior brother.

“How do I improve the ranking of the sect?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrow.

“You can issue a challenge anytime, and each sect will send five disciples for the challenge. Once we win against them, we can upgrade the level of our mountain sect!”

Wang Xian nodded his head in silence. Then he murmured, “I wonder how much of a reward I’ll get for thrashing the entire Immortal Sect...”
