Chapter 1320: The 1321 strong creature and the nameless sword demon

I have to improve my strength to the insightful emptiness realm first. When the time comes, I have to find an opportunity to kill that Frost sect

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. He moved his body and continued to fly towards the higher level.

“Roar!”

“Roar!”

When Wang Xian arrived at the thirteenth level, the situation inside and outside had completely changed.

There were more than a dozen ferocious beasts, and each of them was at level three of the void interpretation stage.

Four of them had a body size, thick scales, and two huge rhinoceros horns. However, their bodies were not that heavy.

“Spirit horn scale beasts, they are spirit horn scale beasts at level three of the Void Interpretation Stage!”

Wang Xian immediately recognized the group of ferocious beasts, and his eyes flashed with a cold luster.

“According to rumors, the upper levels of the main hall were occupied by ferocious beasts. Even the strongest person in the Liuhai region had only reached level 17 or 18. No one had entered the top level before. Now, it seems that it was as expected!”

“Kill!”

Without any hesitation, Wang Xian turned into a divine dragon and attacked the dozen of spiritual horned scale beasts.

Boom! Boom! Boom

A huge five-elemental millstone appeared on the 13th floor.

“Suppress!”

After transforming into a divine dragon, Wang Xian’s strength increased by a notch.

Under the suppression of the five-elemental Millstone, the dozen of spiritual horned scale beasts of the third level of the Seethrough realm were instantly suppressed.

“Huh?”

These few rooms had all been searched by someone. What bad luck.

After putting away the corpse of the spirit horn beasts, Wang Xian looked around a few rooms but did not find any treasures.

He looked up and moved to the fourteenth level.

“This is?”

When he had just stepped into the fourteenth level, he immediately saw a huge demonic beast entrenched inside.

It had a 20-meter-long body, pitch-black scales all over its body, and a huge triangular head.

“Hiss, hiss, hiss!”

“Demon-tailed venomous snake, it’s a demon-tailed venomous snake demonic beast!”

Wang Xian stared at this demonic beast with his dragon eyes. Demon-tailed venomous snake demonic beast was a species of demonic beasts.

This kind of demonic beast was very rare among the demonic beasts in the human-demon graveyard.

However, the bloodline level of this kind of demonic beast was not low.

Seeing that Wang Xian had arrived at the fourteenth level, it raised its head slightly. Its cold triangular eyes were filled with warning.

“Get out of my territory!”

The demon-tailed venomous snake roared directly.

“Water creature, if that’s the case!”

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a cold expression. He moved his body and attacked the demon-tailed venomous snake directly.

“Get out of my territory!”

The demon-tailed Viper roared loudly as a mouthful of black liquid spewed out from its mouth.

The terrifying liquid instantly engulfed the entire 14th layer!

“Suppress!”

Wang Xian’s dragon body trembled as the five elements millstone covered the entire 14th layer.

The terrifying destructive power emitted by the five elements counteracting each other was directed towards the demon-tailed viper.

“Hiss, hiss, hiss!”

“What is this?”

Its cold triangular eyes were filled with fear as it stared at the Five Elements Millstone. With a long tail, it attacked the five elements millstone directly.

Boom

The terrifying attack caused a violent tremor!

“Suppress!”

Wang Xian roared once again. The five divine dragons on the five elements millstone started to run wildly while the five elements millstone was operating.

Below them, a world-destroying scene appeared.

The demon-tailed Viper below seemed to be undergoing a tribulation and was being attacked by the Heaven and earth.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The entire 14th floor seemed as though it was about to explode. The power of the five elements explosion caused many wounds to appear on its body.

“Hiss! Hiss!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Feeling the intense pain from its body, the demon-tailed viper was filled with fear.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Its huge body fled out of the window.

“If you want to escape, I will devour you. Then, I will be able to level up. Where are you going to escape to?”

Wang Xian’s eyes were extremely cold. He opened his huge mouth.

The five elements grinding mill immediately shrunk and entered its mouth.

Buzz

His dragon scales emitted a bright luster. Wang Xian moved his body and flew out.

“Roar!”

A dragon roar was heard in the main hall. Wang Xian stared at the escaping demon-tailed venomous snake and chased after it.

After dashing out of the 14th floor of the main hall, Wang Xian’s dragon eyes stared at the demon-tailed venomous snake. He opened his huge mouth and bit at it.

“Hiss, hiss, hiss!”

The demon-tailed venomous snake was suspended in the air. It swung its huge tail and swung it at Wang Xian.

“Annihilate!”

The five elements energy circulated in the scales on Wang Xian’s body. The five elements grinding mill was located behind his body. Its attack was even more terrifying.

The Dragon Claw struck out and contained the explosion of the five elements.

Boom! Boom! Boom

A violent explosion was heard. Huge wounds appeared on the tail of the demon-tailed Viper instantly.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss

The demon-tailed Viper shook its body in fear and wanted to escape into the distance.

“Bind!”

“Roar!”

Wang Xian roared again. The Phantom of a divine dragon dashed out from his body.

The Phantom was formed from the five elements energy. It flew to the surroundings of the demon-tailed venomous snake and coiled it tightly.

“Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!”

The rapid and terrified sounds reverberated throughout the entire sky.

“Look, what is that? Oh My God, it’s two powerful demonic beasts at least at the fourth level of the Seethrough realm fighting!”

“That’s the demon-tailed viper, what is that? What kind of demon beast is that, or is it a ferocious beast?”

“Oh my god, that thirty-to forty-meter-long ferocious beast is going to devour that demon-tailed viper. That demon-tailed Viper is a fourth level profound void Tier Demon Beast!”

“In the main hall, there are very few human experts at the fifth level of the profound void tier, and those at the sixth level of the profound void tier have not appeared for a long time. Two fourth level profound void tier creatures are basically at the top level!”

“Is that 30 to 40-meter-long creature at level four or level five of the Seethrough Realm?”

Wang Xian and the demonic vipers were fighting about 1,000 meters away from the main hall. Many humans and demonic beasts in the surroundings looked over at the same time. Their faces were filled with shock.

However, in this place, the Demonic Vipers were directly swallowed by the 30 to 40-meter-long creature under everyone’s shocked gaze.

Terrifying!

Terrifying!

“Roar!”

With a howl, the enormous creature flew towards the human exit.

“What kind of creature is that? Why is it flying towards the human exit! ?”

“This creature has at least the strength of a fifth level profound void martial artist!”

Below, all the profound void martial artists stared in shock at the rapidly disappearing figure.

Not far from the entrance of the main hall, the group of people that frigidsect had just walked out saw this scene.

The bald old man’s eyes were filled with fear.

“This... what is that 30 to 40 meter long creature? How terrifying, is he a fourth or fifth level profound void martial artist!”

The long-haired skinny young man standing by the side was also filled with shock as he asked the withered old man beside him.

“Fifth level of the void interpretation realm, that creature is a fifth level void interpretation realm expert!”

The withered old man’s eyes were filled with fear.

“Good heavens, we can’t stay in this main hall any longer. A nameless sword demon easily killed a second level void interpretation realm expert, and now, another terrifying creature has appeared!”

“We’d better go back and come back after a period of time!”

At the side, more than ten profound void martial experts gulped and walked out.
