Chapter 1512: “1512, I said that only when there is light can there be light.”

The Bright Moon was in the sky. From Afar, one could see a huge dragon head heading straight for a human figure.

Like a demon in the abyss, it suddenly opened its mouth to devour everything.

The two-headed demon lord appeared extremely tiny in front of the huge dragon mouth.

It was completely devoured easily. Following that, there was no sound at all.

“Roar!”

After swallowing the two-headed demon lord, Wang Xian let out a furious roar. The Devil scale chain in his hand started to coil around the demon lords.

The Darkness Millstone spun and headed towards the two demon lords.

Meanwhile, the Heavenly Devil Dragon Gate started to block the escape route of the demon lords.

“Damn the two-headed demon lord. If we escape together, we still have a chance. Now...”

The demon lord who was holding the scythe in his hand roared with a gloomy expression as he fought for the entanglement of the demon scale chain.

However, they had been fighting for nearly three hours and their strength was less than 30% of their peak.

Under such circumstances, they were completely suppressed by Wang Xian.

The huge dragon mouth was like an abyss as it devoured the demon lords one by one.

“Ah, I am not reconciled, I am not reconciled!”

“Just because of a woman, you want to destroy everyone in our ancient demon city. You are the demon, you are the demon!”

A series of indignant and angry roars sounded.

Even though they were all demon lords, compared to this crazy creature in front of them, they suddenly felt that they were still lacking.

In front of this terrifying creature, they were not worthy of becoming devils.

As the saying goes, if Wang Xian became a devil, there would be no devils in the world.

The most terrifying ancient devil city in the entire vast region was known as the devil land by the people outside while the people inside were known as devils.

In just a few hours, all of them were killed.

Many of them were devoured by that terrifying creature.

“Ahhhh!”

Miserable screams sounded one after another. They were filled with unwillingness and despair, and they continued to ring out for the next few minutes.

Along with the last scream, the entire world suddenly quieted down.

There was no sound within a hundred kilometer radius. The entire ancient Devil City had been turned into ruins.

Not a single creature was still alive.

Miserable, miserable, miserable!

This was a true massacre of the city, a massacre that would destroy everything!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

At this moment, a violent roar came out from Wang Xian’s mouth. The voice traveled far, far away.

One could hear it from thousands of miles away or even further away.

After the Roar, Wang Xian fell silent. His body landed directly in the middle of the ruins.

His eyes were as deep as the abyss. He scanned his surroundings and slowly lowered his head to look at the location of his heart.

“Hiss, not a single one survived. Not a single one survived. This is ancient demon city after all. It has always been the villains of ancient demon city who annihilated other factions and families. Today, someone actually annihilated ancient demon city!”

“This is too terrifying. I never expected that young master Wang would actually be this terrifying!”

The hearts of everyone from the He clan trembled. They were the core members of the He clan, the upper echelons of the He clan, and the upper echelons of first-rate factions.

Even so, seeing ancient devil city being destroyed with their own eyes, they were extremely shocked.

This was especially so when seven devil lords were killed on the spot.

“There was once a first-rate force that wanted to destroy ancient devil city. In the end, when that rank 8 profound void martial expert had just arrived, the group of Devil Lords directly fled far away. They even said that if they dared to destroy their ancient devil city, they would turn their territory into a bloody place!”

“From then on, out of fear, that first-rate force did not dare to make a move. Once they encountered a strong enemy, the demon lord would immediately flee. It would be very difficult to destroy him!”

“However, they did not expect to encounter such a terrifying existence of the same level!”

Clan head he sighed slightly.

The ancient demon city and the group of demon lords that shook the vast region were destroyed.

After today, the entire vast region would definitely be in shock.

“Brother Wang Xian, how is it?”

He Yuan looked at Wang Xian who had transformed into a dragon from afar. He heaved a sigh of relief and stared at him with flickering eyes.

“If you guys don’t say it, I can’t believe that this is just a young man in his twenties. This young man is really a monster. In the future, Yuan ‘er, make friends with him!”

The white-haired elder said slowly to he yuan.

“It’s the Patriarch!”

He Yuan nodded his head.

Lin Yaoyao and he suiqing, who were at the side, were looking at him with sparkling eyes. They were exclaiming in their hearts.

If he didn’t fall in ten years, he would definitely be a legend.

The moonlight shone on the 100-meter-long body of the demon dragon. Wang Xian’s tyrannical heart calmed down a lot.

“Hahaha, what I seek for the Dark Ones is eternal life in the darkness and eternal life in the Slaughter!”

At this moment, the tyrannical voice came from his heart once again.

The emotions that Wang Xian had just calmed down became irritable again, causing him to have the urge to destroy the world. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Where there is darkness, there will definitely be light. Darkness will bring death, and light will bring life!”

“Where there is good, there will be opposition. Chaos will turn into nine, and the two poles will merge. Darkness will fade, and Dawn will revive!”

Just when Wang Xian was about to lose control, a gentle voice rang out once again, suppressing his violent emotions.

One of his dragon eyes slowly turned into light.

“Haha, What Light? If I become a demon, there will be no demons in the world. Wherever I go, there will be no light. It will only bring endless darkness. My World is the world of other living beings!”

Just as that gentle voice fell, that brutal voice sounded again.

It seemed to be competing with that gentle voice.

“Where darkness comes, it can bring darkness, but it can not destroy light!”

The gentle voice retorted.

“What kind of light do you want? What you want is eternal life, eternal life, Slaughter, and blood. Roar Roar!”

That brutal voice roared wildly.

“We are the souls of the light and Dark Dragon King. The balance between light and dark was broken by you, junior. The heart of light and dark has already fused into your body. Darkness is invading. If you want to completely control the heart of light and dark, you need to do the following four things: eliminate a wisp of our remnant souls, maintain the original heart, balance between light and dark, and Fuse Light and dark. Remember This!”

“Get lost!”

The gentle voice continued to speak. However, the violent voice came directly at him.

Wang Xian laid there in a daze. As he listened to the gentle voice, he had a slight understanding in his heart.

It turned out that the loss of control of his emotions was the cause of the heart of light and darkness.

“Kill, Kill, kill! Whoever dares to disobey me, kill them all!”

“Destroy, destroy everything that is not pleasing to the eye. Let’s create a new world that belongs to us!”

...

The violent voice kept ringing in his mind.

Wang Xian lay there quietly with a ferocious expression. His breathing was slightly rushed due to the influence of the darkness.

With a thought, one sculpture after another appeared in the Dragon Claw. When he saw Ling Jian ‘ER’s sculpture, his heart was filled with another wave of violence.

However, when his gaze landed on the female sculptures of Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue, and his sister, he felt a wave of calmness and warmth in his heart.

Time passed slowly. This one lie of his lasted for an entire night. His brutal voice never stopped.

A Ray of dawn sunlight shone over and landed on Wang Xian’s pitch-black body.

“Roar!”

At this moment, Wang Xian suddenly raised his head. His pitch-black eyes became extremely clear.

“If I become a demon, there will be no demons in the world. If I have light, then there will be light!”

A voice that reverberated for over 10,000 kilometers shook the world.

When Wang Xian’s voice rang out, his body gradually shrank and returned to his human form.

At this moment, his eyes were extremely determined. He spoke with a voice that only he could hear:

“My Name Is Wang Xian!”
