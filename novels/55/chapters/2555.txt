2556 2556 must give an explanation! Go

The sky array had reconstructed his physical body and possessed the combat strength of a Level Seven Immortal King!

In addition to the tiger turmoil demon nation, Wang Xian was not afraid of the peak strength of the old-timers from the southern star system!

Even if the ninth-grade heaven sect had no enmity with the Dragon Palace, they were protecting the demon Slayer sect and wanted to wreak havoc on his planet!

They had to give an explanation. They had to chase the demon Slayer sect out or suffer some consequences!

“Dragon King, if you are not afraid, what is there to be afraid of in the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation? Furthermore, the demon Slayer sect is targeting us!”

The eyes of the old king of the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation sparkled as he spoke to Wang Xian!

“Send out the notice immediately. Also, Sky Formation, imprison them and prevent them from escaping. Hang them on Dragon Star as a warning!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile and said to sky array!

“No Problem!”

Sky array nodded. With a wave of his arm, formation after formation entered their bodies!

“Leave it to us!”

Chaotic Tiger Nation’s leader walked over and grabbed more than 20 immortal godly monarchs. His face was filled with fear!

“Alright!”

Sky array nodded!

Whoosh

Chaotic Tiger Nation’s leader moved his body and flew towards the teleportation formation with the rest of them!

“Let’s go to the place where the battle pets are sold to get ready!”

Wang Xian took a look and flew down with a smile on his face!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

“Hehe, I’ll nail you here in the next few days to let everyone know the consequences of daring to cause trouble on our Dragon Star!”

Weng

Chaotic tiger country leader came to the teleportation formation, pillars rose one after another, with a wave of his arm, over 20 silhouettes were thrown onto it!

After which, the nails pierced into their bodies, completely impaling them!

“That is?”

“Si, that seems to be over 20 undying emperors, they are all nailed there!”

“This... This is the undyings that wanted to massacre the entire Dragon Star, who would have thought that they would be nailed there, this is an undyings!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

At the teleportation formation, everyone looked at the rising pillar and the over 20 undyings nailed there, their faces filled with shock!

“Ah Ah Ah!”

At this moment, the over 20 undyings felt so humiliated, their bodies trembling non stop!

They were undyings, yet they had become prisoners, for everyone to watch and mock!

“Look at the AI, Chaotic Tiger Demon Country, Dragon Palace and Dragon Star have all made a statement!”

At this time, a voice resounded, everyone immediately opened their Ai!

On the AI, Chaotic Tiger Demon Country, Dragon Palace and Dragon Star all made the same statement!

“Today, the dragon star will be opened. The more than twenty undying godly monarchs who were preparing to massacre everyone at the concert have all been captured alive. They were sent by the demon slaying sect and Xing Hua Planet!”

“Very soon, we will make you pay the price. Also, the demon slaying sect is currently under the protection of the Ninth Grade Heaven sect. Now, the Ninth Grade Heaven sect requests that you expel them from your territory. Otherwise, you will have to bear the consequences!”

A notice was sent to the AI!

With the popularity of the Dragon Star and what had just happened, everyone was paying attention to it!

Seeing their statement, they were all shocked!

“I didn’t expect that planet Xing Hua would send people to the dragon star to cause trouble. Do they not want the commercial planet of the Dragon Star to rise?”

“Xing Hua planet’s three seas sect and Dragon Palace have a conflict, Xing Hua Planet definitely doesn’t want the planet to rise. Besides, it’s normal for the beheading demon sect to send people to kill. However, the chaotic Tiger Demon Country and Dragon Palace are so tough, they actually asked the ninth grade heaven sect to give an explanation!”

“What a tough dragon palace and chaotic tiger demon country, they actually said they would make them pay the price, and is this considered provoking the ninth grade heaven sect?”

“The ninth-grade sky sect is one of the four strongest factions in the southern star system. They don’t only have a Level 7 immortal king guarding them. Have the Dragon Palace and chaotic tiger demon country grown too arrogant?”

All the factions in the southern star system discussed when they saw this news!

They were very surprised by the strength of the Dragon Palace and Chaotic Tiger Demon Country!

However, none of them thought highly of their provocation of the ninth-grade heaven sect!

The ninth-grade heaven sect was one of the four strongest forces in the southern star system. They had an extremely deep heritage and no one knew that they had an undying god King level seven expert!

No one knew exactly how powerful they were!

However, they were definitely not something that the chaotic tiger demon country and the Dragon Palace could compare to!

“Oh No? They actually said that we sent people to kill wantonly. Do they have any evidence?”

Not far away on Xing Hua Planet, the three powers gathered together, seeing the news from the Dragon Palace and Tiger Chaos Demon Country, their expressions were ugly!

With their strength, they were no match for Tiger Chaos Demon Country!

Even if the three powers joined forces, they weren’t even enough to fight an undying level 7 warrior!

“Damn it, our three seas sect sent people to contact the Black Cloud Star Skull organization, they don’t even know that we hired them, how could they know it was our Xing Hua Planet!”

...

“That Dragon King is purposely saying that we sent people to disturb them!”

The three seas sect leader saw this information and was so angry that his body trembled!

“They want us to pay the price? What Price?”

The expressions of the Warriors from the three powers were extremely dark!

They knew that they were in big trouble this time!

The other side had the Tiger Chaos Demon Country and an undying level 7 warrior, if they really wanted to pressure them, they wouldn’t be able to withstand it!

“Immediately issue a statement, since the Dragon Palace and tiger chaotic demon country said it was our Xing Hua Planet, then produce evidence, without evidence, we can not frame them!”

The President of the Jian Hua Group roared softly!

“Yes!”

A warrior beside immediately nodded!

They had to give an explanation to the tiger chaotic demon country’s warning and threat!

...

However, they definitely wouldn’t agree to hire the black cloud skull organization to kill this time!

...

“Sect master, this is the statement made by the Tiger Demon Nation and the Dragon Palace. The Demon Slayer sect sent people to the Dragon Star to prepare for mass slaughter and capture. Now, they are asking us to drive the demon Slayer sect away!”

At the same time, on a prosperous planet far away!

A ninth-grade commercial planet, or even a commercial planet that had stood in the starry sky for forty to fifty million years, had an extremely deep heritage!

More than ten elders rushed to the ninth-grade sky sect’s sect master’s cultivation place and immediately reported!

“Oh? You Want Us to drive away the demon slaying sect? was this really done by an expert from the demon slaying sect?”

A middle-aged ninth-grade sky sect’s sect master asked indifferently and opened his AI to take a look!

“It’s sect master. The demon slaying sect has indeed made a move!”

Everyone nodded!

“Hehe, the juniors nowadays are so arrogant, just let them say that they won’t expel us and let us bear the consequences!”

The sect Master of the ninth grade Sky sect looked at the information on the AI, his face revealing a hint of mockery!

“Then sect master, we?”

An elder hesitated for a moment before asking!

“JUST A Level 7 undying god King holding down the fort thinks that he can be on equal footing with us, what a joke, Alright, you guys handle this matter!”

The ninth grade sky sect leader said indifferently, waving at the group!

His words also showed his attitude!
