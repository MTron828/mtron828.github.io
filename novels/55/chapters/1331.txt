Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Boom! Boom! Boom

The dragon’s tail swept across and a series of terrifying explosions erupted in the sky. Even though the dragon’s tail had yet to land on Bing Hanzi’s body.

The explosions were already deafening.

“What?”

Sensing Wang Xian’s terrifying dragon’s tail, Bing Hanzi’s expression changed slightly. With a wave of his arm, a longsword that was 60 to 70 meters long slashed directly at the dragon’s tail.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

Obviously, the sound of breaking could be heard. Cracks appeared on the ice sword.

“Dragon Claw!”

Wang Xian did not hesitate at all. A huge dragon claw clawed towards the center of the Ice Armor God.

At the center of the Dragon Claw, waves of violent energy were being destroyed and destroyed!

Wang Xian, who had fused with the five elements, had destructive energy in his every move.

The pinnacle of the five elements, the reversal of the five elements.

“God of Ice Wings, Slash!”

The huge ice wings slashed directly at Wang Xian’s dragon claws.

“Dragon Breath!”

Wang Xian opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of lava-like flames from his mouth.

This time, the lava that he spat out did not disappear immediately after it was spat out. Instead, Wang Xian was like an erupting mountain of flames.

The lava surged forward continuously.

Water and fire were incompatible. The impact of the lava landed on the ice wings and the ice wings began to melt rapidly.

Wang Xian’s dragon claws pressed forward and grabbed the chest of the god of ice armor.

“Explode!”

“Boom Boom Boom!”

The explosions at the starting point rang out continuously.

Cracks started to appear on the 20-meter-long god of ice armor.

Han Bingzi, who was standing in the middle of the ice armor God, had bulging eyes that were bloodshot.

“Dissolve, Retreat!”

He shouted softly. The spot where Wang Xian attacked turned into a stream of water as he retreated rapidly.

“Han Bingzi is at a disadvantage!”

“After Wang Xian merged with that terrifying millstone, his strength has increased by a lot!”

“This is too terrifying. Is this the Battle of a level five void interpretation expert? They are already 10,000 meters high in the sky. Below them, it still gives me a feeling that I can’t Breathe!”

Below them, everyone looked up at the battle in the sky. Their faces were all red.

In the entire demi-human graveyard, everyone’s gaze was focused on the sky above the island of the Light Dragon Empire. They were all in shock.

“Die!”

Wang Xian saw Bing Hanzi escaping. He swayed his huge body and rushed over without giving him any time to catch his breath.

“I, Bing Hanzi, didn’t die even after being trapped in the radiant dragon origin pond for more than two thousand years. You’re Dreaming if you want to kill me. You’re the one who’s going to die!”

Bing Hanzi gritted his teeth and clenched his fists.

He opened his mouth slightly and a blue ice ball came out from his body.

The ice ball was emitting a faint white mist, and cracking sounds came from the air.

An extreme cold filled an area of dozens of kilometers.

Everyone below couldn’t help but wrap themselves around their bodies.

After the ice ball came out of Bing Hanzi’s mouth, Bing Hanzi looked even thinner and weaker. His body was completely wrapped in skin, and he looked like a skeleton.

His eyes were completely protruding out, making him look extremely terrifying.

“I knew it. As a monster that lived a few years ago, he definitely has some trump cards!”

“The real battle has only just begun!”

When everyone below saw the shining ice ball, they all took a deep breath and stared at the sky without blinking.

At this moment, Long Xiaoyun and Long Xiaotian were both clenching their fists.

No matter who won or lost this battle, it would have a great impact on their forces in the future.

“Are you going all out?”

Wang Xian could feel the extreme cold temperature from the ice ball. A cold glint flashed in his eyes.

“Dharma Idol, surrounded by icebergs!”

Bing Hanzi stood in front of the ice ball. He stared at Wang Xian and roared.

Surrounded by icebergs, another powerful Dharma Idol.

With the three broken dharma idols on his body, this was his fourth Dharma Idol!

Crack! Crack! Crack

As soon as he finished his sentence, the ice ball emitted rays of blue light. Around him, icebergs that were a thousand meters in size appeared out of thin air.

There were a total of five icebergs.

The five icebergs guarded Bing Hanzi above. The ice ball bloomed and stood a few thousand meters in the sky.

At this moment, Bing Hanzi was like an ice god.

“Haha, Good, good. This will be interesting. Since that’s the case, let’s have the strongest collision!”

Wang Xian stared at Bing Hanzi who was standing above the five icebergs with a fiery gaze and laughed out loud.

“Aspect: five elemental grindstone!”

Five elemental grindstone was the aspect that Wang Xian comprehended when he reached the first level of the void interpretation stage. It was also a weapon that he forged with the five Elemental Dragon Pearl, the five elemental origin, and the immense five elemental energy.

The moment the five elements Grindstone Dharma Idol appeared.

An enormous grindstone appeared beneath Wang Xian.

Wang Xian stood at the center of the Grindstone within a range of two thousand meters. Around him, five three to four ten-meter-long five elements divine dragons were located in five different directions.

The divine dragons guarded him and stood on top of the grindstone.

With the augmentation of the five elements energy, Wang Xian’s strength increased explosively once again.

Bing Hanzi looked at Wang Xian’s Dharma Idol and felt a little embarrassed. He clenched his yellowish teeth tightly.

“Fight!”

At this moment, Wang Xian was dashing on the dharma idol of the five elements grinding technique. The five divine dragons were also dashing forward with the five elements grinding technique.

“Kill!”

Bing Hanzi’s face revealed a ghastly expression. He clenched his teeth and roared loudly.

Numerous icebergs attacked Wang Xian directly.

“Destroy!”

Wang Xian’s gaze was like a torch.

“Roar!”

On the five elements millstone, the fire dragon leaped up directly while the other four dragons spun the Millstone.

Under the support of the other four dragons, the fire dragon grew larger and larger until it was over 200 meters long. Its terrifying tail swept out directly.

“Boom!”

An iceberg instantly collapsed under the fire god Dragon’s attack.

“Boom Boom!”

Following that, the second and third icebergs also collapsed. The Flames on the fire god Dragon’s body began to decrease.

The chains pulled the fire god Dragon back. After that, the Earth god Dragon leaped up again.

Earth countered water.

“Boom Boom!”

A dragon tail swept out, and two icebergs instantly collapsed.

All the icebergs that guarded Bing Hanzi collapsed.

“Dharma Idol, freeze the Earth!”

Seeing that his dharma idol was easily destroyed, Bing Hanzi’s expression changed drastically. With a wave of his arm, the ice ball in front of him smashed towards the five elements grindstone.

At the same time, the last dharma idol was unleashed.

“Take it!”

When Wang Xian saw that the ice ball and even the air were sealed, his eyes narrowed and he let out a loud roar.

His body slowly turned into a water-blue color.

The water dragon of the five elements Millstone started to expand and directly swallowed the extremely cold ice ball.

The entire five elements millstone revolved the water energy to the extreme.

The water dragon wrapped the ice ball with the Dharma Idol.

The ice ball was directly swallowed by the Water Dragon and the water dragon instantly froze.

The frozen ground landed on the five elements Millstone and the five elements Millstone started to freeze.

“This is my chance!”

At this moment, Wang Xian looked at the lone icicle in the sky and leaped up. He opened his huge mouth and swallowed it.
