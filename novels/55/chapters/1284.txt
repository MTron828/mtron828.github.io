Translator: 5496903

“Hehe, Alright, Alright. We can’t force ourselves to meet a ferocious beast of the first level of the Seethrough Realm!”

Long Xiaotian grinned when he heard Wang Xian’s words.

Wang Xian nodded with a smile as he scanned the surroundings with a smile. The group of people started to chat.

Long Xiaotian’s subordinates were also chatting excitedly.

They were now 80% confident that their prince would become the crown prince and inherit the throne.

As the first batch of loyal subordinates of the King of the Light Dragon Dynasty in the future, their future would also soar.

Some of the subordinates were discussing Wang Xian with admiration.

They were only short of comparing him to the supreme genius.

“Chirp chirp, CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”

The night slowly passed. When a ray of sunlight broke through the sky, the chirping of a flock of birds woke everyone up.

Wang Xian sensed the aura coming from the front and was slightly stunned. He immediately stood up and looked towards the sky.

“The ferrybird, a bird of light attribute. It possesses the bloodline of the insightful void tier. That is the leader of the ferrybirds, the first level of the insightful void tier!”

When Wang Xian saw more than ten white ferrybirds flying in the sky, he was pleasantly surprised.

“Our luck is really good. Come, lock down this group of Dodo Birds!”

Wang Xian did not hesitate at all. He moved his body and flew directly into the sky.

“Void interpretation level ferocious beasts, go and help brother Wang Xian. We must capture that Dodo bird!”

Long Xiaotian saw the White Bird Beast in the sky and his eyes were filled with excitement. He quickly shouted loudly.

“Yes!”

“Yes!”

Bai Qingshan and elder Zhu did not hesitate at all. They knew very well that if they managed to capture this dodo bird, it could be the prince’s mount.

The two of them used all of their strength and flew straight into the sky.

“Roar!”

Ling Zilin and the blood evil turtle did not hesitate at all and flew straight into the sky.

Two thousand meters in the sky, a group of Dodo birds who were fleeing for their lives saw a group of experts who suddenly flew over from below. Their eyes turned red.

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

The seethrough-level ferrybird flapped its two-meter-wide wings. Rays of light rays shot towards Wang Xian.

Under the sunlight, the wings flickered with a dazzling white glow.

“Roar Roar!”

Ling Zilin and the blood evil turtle immediately sealed off the surroundings. Bai Qingshan and elder Zhu immediately attacked the first-level seethrough-level ferrybird.

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

After being attacked by several Seethrough realm experts consecutively, the Dodo bird that was at the first level of the Seethrough realm let out a panicked cry.

Wang Xian moved his arm and lightning struck wood appeared in his hand. With a wave of his arm, a thorn easily wrapped itself around the dodo bird’s claw.

He pulled it gently and the Dodo bird that was at the first level of the Seethrough realm fell towards the ground.

“I’ve caught it, Haha!”

Long Xiaotian looked excited when he saw this scene.

“Bang!”

Under the restraint of Wang Xian, Bai Qingshan and elder Zhu immediately launched their attacks and pressed down on the Dodo bird.

The powerful force caused the dodo bird to land on the ground with a loud thud. Seawater splashed in all directions.

Wang Xian looked at the Dodo bird that was lying on the ground with a smile on his face. This was really a bird that had descended from the sky.

Initially, he wanted to continue searching for it, but in the end, it flew over directly.

The might in Wang Xian’s body trembled and directly struck the head of the Dodo bird, squeezing out a trace of blood.

In less than 20 seconds, the Dodo bird was easily tamed.

“Brother Wang Xian, there are still more than a dozen dodo birds here!”

Long Xiaotian revealed an excited expression when he saw Wang Xian taming it. He pointed at the other dozen dodo birds that were restrained at the side.

These dozen of beasts were all at the half-step void interpretation level.

One was at the first level of the void interpretation level, while the other dozen were at the half-step void interpretation level. If all of these beasts belonged to him, his strength would almost double.

“Who dares to capture my ferocious beasts? You’re courting death!”

At this moment, an angry voice was suddenly heard, causing Wang Xian, Long Xiaotian, and the rest to be slightly stunned.

“That’s right!”

Long Xiaotian raised his head and looked over. A hint of surprise flashed across his face as he looked at the group of people flying towards them with a solemn expression.

There were more than twenty people in the group. Most of them were young men. Only two middle-aged men were around the young man in the middle.

The young man’s skin was fair and tender. He looked like a gigolo, but his face was filled with arrogance.

When Long Xiaotian and the others were surprised, there were more than twenty fierce beasts behind them, and each of them was emitting a powerful aura.

Three of them were at least at the first level of the profound void tier.

He looked over with an icy gaze.

“Eh? That’s the Yan family!”

Long Xiaotian narrowed his eyes slightly and stared at the few men and women beside the young man in the center, his eyes flickering.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Behind them, Long Xiaotian and his men were riding on their mounts. They stared coldly at the group of people who were flying over.

“Huh?”

The young man in the lead ignored long Xiaotian and his men. His gaze landed on Wang Xian and the Dodo bird beside him.

When he saw the Dodo bird lying obediently beside Wang Xian, a hint of surprise flashed across his eyes.

There were more than a dozen of them and more than twenty ferocious beasts. Although their numbers were much smaller than long Xiaotian and the rest, their powerful aura caused Bai Qingshan and elder Zhu’s expressions to change slightly.

“This group of Ferrybirds is ours. Hand them over!”

The young man with fair and tender skin raised his head slightly. He stared at Wang Xian and ordered.

When Wang Xian heard the young man’s words, his gaze swept toward the two middle-aged men beside him. His pupils constricted slightly.

“Yours? Then call them over!”

Wang Xian pondered for a moment and said expressionlessly.

“That’s right. If you say it’s yours, then it’s yours. What proof do you have?”

Long Xiaotian took two steps forward and said coldly.

“HMM? It’s the second Prince of the Guanglong dynasty, Long Xiaotian!”

“It’s him!”

The men and women behind the young man looked at Long Xiaotian with astonishment in their eyes.

“This is the one we chased after. Moreover, that Dodo bird is my pet. I order you to hand it over to me!”

The young man pointed at the insightful void realm Dodo bird and said with a strong expression.

“Who do you think you are? You still order us?”

Hearing the young man’s words, a trace of coldness appeared on Long Xiaotian’s face.

He was the Prince of the Light Dragon Dynasty. In the flowing sea region, the only one who had a higher status than him was the blood flow empire.

Even so, he was not afraid of the young masters of some families of the blood flow empire.

“You’re courting death!”

When the young man heard Long Xiaotian’s words, the aura on his body trembled. A powerful aura of the first level of the profound void tier directly covered long Xiaotian.

“Be careful!”

“Be careful, Prince!”

Bai Qingshan and elder Zhu’s expressions changed slightly. They hurriedly stood in front of the young man and blocked the young man’s aura.

“Young master he, that young man is the Prince of the Light Dragon Dynasty. His power is not weak!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Behind him, a girl quickly approached him and whispered to him.

“No matter who he is, the pet I like is mine. Give me the ferrybird!”

Young master he arrogantly ignored him completely!
