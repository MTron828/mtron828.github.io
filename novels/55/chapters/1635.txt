Chapter 1636: 1636 launched a counterattack in the vast region

“How is this possible...”

A Cry of surprise came out of the middle-aged man’s mouth.

“That’s? Those are the experts from our vast region? Oh My God, those five old men in front are some old ancestors!”

“Why are they in such a sorry state and their expressions are extremely ugly. Why are there only 60,000 of the 120,000 troops that went there?”

“What’s going on? Did We lose half of our people in order to destroy the dragon-phoenix Empire?”

“If I remember correctly, there were six patriarchs in the army, but there are only five now. Oh My God, could it be...”

At this moment, a cry of surprise came from the surrounding area. Everyone looked at the experts in the vast area in shock.

They widened their eyes, and their eyes were filled with disbelief.

“I didn’t expect that our vast region would suffer such a great loss when we set out to conquer a flowing sea region!”

Seeing all the experts of the vast region disappear, an old man said with a frown.

“That’s right. It seems that the dragon-phoenix Empire is really not simple. They could actually cause our vast region to suffer such heavy losses!”

“A small region is able to fight against the experts of our vast region to such an extent. They can be considered to have no regrets even in death!”

“Hmph, I really didn’t expect that a small flowing sea region would actually cause our vast region to suffer such heavy losses.”

Some people in the surroundings were discussing in shock.

They were filled with shock at the loss of experts from the vast region.

They were even more shocked by the strength of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire.

“The vast region, our dragon and Phoenix Empire is back, Hahaha!”

“How dare you invade us? Today, we will fight back and make all the factions in the vast region pay a heavy price!”

However, half an hour later, the people of the vast region were discussing the return of the experts from the vast region.

Suddenly, a roar filled with fury and excitement came from the north flowing sea.

The voice covered an area of more than 100 kilometers.

“What?”

Everyone in the city and by the sea was instantly stunned. Everyone looked in the direction of the north flowing sea in shock.

“This... this... this...”

When they saw the familiar giant beast, their eyes widened and their bodies trembled. Their faces were filled with shock.

The flag of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire fluttered in the sky.

Tens of thousands of experts who were emitting a strong murderous aura stood on the giant beast and stared coldly at the land in front of them.

Compared to the previous arrival of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, this time, it was filled with fury and killing intent.

“People in the city below, listen up. Soon, the owner of this land will belong to our dragon and Phoenix Empire. Just wait to submit!”

The giant beast came to the top of the city and a domineering voice sounded out.

Wanton, arrogant, and confident!

When everyone heard this, they opened their mouths slightly.

“I... The experts of our vast region didn’t return in triumph. They were beaten back!”

“Also, the dragon-phoenix Empire of the flowing sea region is attacking. Oh My God!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Everyone looked at this scene in disbelief.

From the beginning to the end, they had never thought that the experts from the vast region would fail.

Even if the 120,000 strong army only returned 60,000, or even if they returned early, they had never thought of this.

This was because in their eyes, the vast region was invincible. Going to the flowing sea region was a piece of cake.

No one had expected this outcome.

Now, not only had their vast region suffered a great defeat, but the experts from the dragon and Phoenix Empire had actually counterattacked.

When they thought of this result, everyone was in an uproar.

“It’s very difficult to destroy the three major factions. However, this time, we have to completely establish ourselves in the vast region. We have to occupy at least half of the Territory!”

“Let’s head to the He clan first and get the information department of the He clan to move. After that, we will wreak havoc in the vast region for a few days!”

Wang Xian stood at the front. He had a clear understanding of what had happened during the eight months he was resurrected.

Although it was out of Wang Xian’s expectations for the Wuji Empire to be enemies with them, he was very gratified by the help and support from the He clan and he Sui clan.

His relationship with he yuan was pretty good. He didn’t want to turn against each other.

“Alright, let’s head to the He clan first!”

Feng Luan nodded her head with a divine glow on her face.

This time, their counterattack was a huge leap for the dragon and Phoenix Empire.

Lan qingyue made Xiao Lan fly towards the He clan’s territory.

He clan, holy tree.

From the He clan and he Sui clan joining the Dragon and Phoenix Empire’s camp to the Wuji Empire’s attack, the entire he clan and he Sui clan had fallen into a huge crisis.

Especially in the past few days, when they heard that all the experts in the vast region, except for them, had left for the flowing sea region, some people became even more anxious.

At this moment, the two large clans and millions of people had gathered around the holy tree.

This made the He clan extremely crowded.

All the He clan and he sui clan members were also frowning.

“Sigh, we don’t know how the dragon-phoenix Empire’s current situation is. Once they are destroyed, then we...”

In a wooden house on the holy tree, the higher-ups of the He clan and the experts of the He Sui clan sat in a room. They frowned and sighed.

The atmosphere in the room was very solemn.

“Let’s leave it to fate. Everything is our own choice. It’s just that we didn’t consider the life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop, so the Wuji Empire took Action!”

The clan leader of the He clan shook his head helplessly.

“Wu Wu!”

“Huh? What’s That Sound?”

“What a familiar sound!”

At this moment, an earth-shaking sound came from outside.

The higher-ups of the two clans in the room were slightly shocked and immediately flew out.

He Yuan, who was in the Holy Tree, also flew out of the room.

“He Yuan, everyone in the He clan, long time no see!”

Just as he yuan flew out, the higher-ups of the He clan and he Sui clan also heard an extremely familiar voice.

Around them, the entire he clan and he Sui clan, as well as millions of people, raised their heads to look at the sky.

Due to Xiao Lan’s speed, the He clan could not react in time.

Everyone was slightly stunned when they saw the young figure on the gigantic beast.

“This... this... brother Wang Xian, you’re still alive? You’re still alive?”

He Yuan looked at the familiar voice and his face was filled with disbelief.

The entire vast region knew about the death of the Sky Demon. Now, he was actually still alive.

This, who would dare to believe it?

“Of course. I haven’t conquered the entire transcendence continent yet. How could I possibly die?”

Wang Xian smiled faintly. His figure moved and he flew downwards.

Feng Luan, Lan Qingyue, and the rest immediately followed behind and flew down.

“The Sky Demon is still alive. Empress Dragon and Phoenix and the goddess of the wilderness are both here!”

When the He clan and he Sui clan’s higher-ups saw them flying over, they revealed a hint of excitement on their faces.

As long as they were still here, they still had their backers.
