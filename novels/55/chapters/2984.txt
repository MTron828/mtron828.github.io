Chapter 2985: 2,985, the advance army of the two races

“How can this be? How can this be! I’m not willing, I’m not willing!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Screams and desperate voices sounded.

The emperor Lord and the desolate god Emperor watched this scene in misery.

They thought that they could find an expert from the center of the universe to easily destroy the Dragon Palace and take revenge.

However, they didn’t expect that the expert from the center of the universe couldn’t even withstand a single blow from the Dragon Palace.

They had sacrificed a large number of their subordinates in the past few years, and now they had to face such a result.

They were filled with grief, despair, and unwillingness!

“No!”

“No!”

Two angry voices filled with unwillingness sounded from the side.

They looked over and saw the expert from the three-eyed race and the creator. They were captured by the Dragon Palace and were roaring in despair.

This was especially so for Yang Xiaohun.

Didn’t they say that there were very few experts in this remote place?

Didn’t they say that the Dragon Palace was in their hands?

Didn’t they say that they could easily tame the divine dragon and become Dragon Knights?

“Shut up!”

Mo Sha and the others said impatiently. With a slap, all their teeth were knocked out.

“Let’s go, let’s go. I thought the experts at the center of the universe were so powerful. How disappointing!”

“Keke, you want to destroy our Dragon Palace with this strength?”

With a mocking voice, Ba Qi and the others put away all the corpses. Then, they slowly disappeared with the four-armed experts, Yang Xiaohun, and the other creators.

With a wave of the Heaven Array’s arm, the surrounding arrays disappeared and so did their figures.

“It’s over just like that?”

Around the teleportation array, everyone said in a daze when they saw the experts of the Dragon Palace disappear.

The experts from the center of the universe came to their starry sky to destroy the Dragon Palace and obtain the Divine Dragon.

In the end, the Dragon Palace casually sent tens of thousands of members to destroy them.

Excuse me, are they really experts from the center of the Universe?

Excuse me, aren’t they here to court death? ?

The experts from the center of the universe arrived with an invincible opening and ended up being instantly killed.

This was simply too dramatic.

It made everyone dumbstruck.

“It’s not that the experts from the center of the universe are too weak, but the dragon palace is too strong. I can feel that some of the experts from the four-armed race and the three-eyed race can easily kill me. However, they have no power to resist in front of the members of the Dragon Palace.”

The ruler of this planet, an expert at the first level of the divine emperor, slowly opened his mouth and sighed.

The strength of the Dragon Palace was too heaven-defying.

“Dragon King, the bunch of fellows who came to our side to die have been killed!”

At the same time, in the Dragon King Hall of the Dragon Palace, Tian Cheng Ba Qi and the rest were carrying a few bodies and throwing them to the side. They reported to Wang Xian with a smile.

“Check their memories first and take a look at the strength of the four-armed race and the three-eyed race.”

Prime Minister Gui said to them with a smile.

“No Problem!”

The eight-limbed demon nodded and waved at his subordinates.

Their bodies moved and flowed into the bodies of Yang Xiaohun and the four-armed race’s experts like liquid.

Wang Xian sat on the Dragon Chair and watched quietly.

“Dragon King, I have some news about the three-eyed race.”

Ten minutes later, the eight-headed Hydra who was hosting Yang Xiaohun reported to Wang Xian.

“The three-eyed race is a weak race in the center of the universe. There are not many members in the race. There are only a few hundred billion of them. However, they are all relatively strong. The entire three-eyed race has over 10,000 god-emperor powerhouses.”

“Among them, the three-eyed race’s leader has the strength of a level seven void god-emperor. The two great protectors in the race are also at level seven god-emperor. Furthermore, according to what this body knows, they have a few level seven god-emperor ancestors. As for the exact number, he doesn’t know.”

“Not long ago, he passed the news of our Dragon Palace to the race. Now, the three-eyed race will organize the members around the Mo Han clan’s racial ruins to enter the starry sky quickly and take control of our Dragon Palace.”

“The Mo Han clan’s racial ruins is what we call the eight desolates and six harmonies!”

Ba Qi absorbed Yang Xiaohun’s memories and reported to Wang Xian with a slight frown.

“Oh?”

Wang Xian frowned when he heard what Ba Qi said.

“Dragon King, the strength of the four-armed race is similar to the three-eyed race. According to this body, the strongest person known to be in this body is also at the seventh level void God realm. They have already informed the clan elders and clan leaders.”

“In order to take control of our Dragon Palace before the three-eyed race and snatch the opportunity, they have also issued the same order as the three-eyed race. Gather all the members around the Mo Han clan and form an advance army to enter our place!”

Mo Sha, who was by the side, immediately said after hearing eight points.

His words caused all the leaders of the Dragon Palace to frown.

There were many void God Emperor level seven existences. If all of them entered the resplendent starry sky, the Dragon Palace would not be able to resist them.

“Dragon King, I dismantled the creator’s parts and obtained an exit to the center of the Cosmos from his information. The four-armed race entered from there.”

Tian Chen, who was holding some parts, said from the side.

“Dragon King, I also have an exit that Ba Huang and the others found.”

Ba Qi echoed.

“With our strength, we are not strong enough to fight against the two great races!”

Wang Xian mumbled and looked lost in thought.

“Dragon King, I have another piece of news. It is very troublesome to enter our resplendent starry sky from the center of the universe. If no one gives us a detailed map, the experts from the center of the universe might not be able to enter!”

Tian Chen’s eyes flickered as he spoke.

“Let’s capture the two level five divine emperors from the nine obliteration planet first before we make a long-term plan.”

Wang Xian said to them.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Tian Chen and the rest nodded.

“Let’s do it together!”

Wang Xian stood up as well and was prepared to take action personally.

“Let’s go. There are still a few planets in the eight desolations and six harmonies that have our dragon palace. Let’s teleport there directly.”

As he spoke, he moved to the front of the teleportation formation.

The leaders of the Heaven Formation Bhang Ji and the rest immediately followed behind.

The 14 divine emperors of the Dragon Palace with level-five combat strength were all mobilized.

Wang Xian moved and appeared in front of the teleportation formation.

The group of members of the Dragon Palace stepped into the teleportation formation directly.

Just as Wang Xian and the rest were hurrying toward bhang liu he, a piece of news stirred up the entire resplendent starry sky.

The news came from the Heaven’s punishment ancient heaven region, and it came from a god Emperor.

The news from the eight desolation and six harmonies was because the creator had used his powerful computing power to hinder the spread of the news. However, after the death of the creator, the Celestial Wizard Domain of the Imperial Star region, as well as the glazed domain.., they also received the news of an expert from the center of the universe descending into the resplendent starry sky.

However, before this news could completely explode in the resplendent starry sky, a piece of news had already exploded.

A God Emperor from the heaven punishment ancient sky region and many experts had sent out a piece of news.

The experts from the four-armed race and the three-eyed race in the center of the universe had already been exterminated by the Dragon Palace.

Instant Kill!
