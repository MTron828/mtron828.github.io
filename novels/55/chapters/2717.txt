2718 2,718, Tianya’s bad news

“Let’s go. Next, your sect leader will organize people to enter the abyss to hunt the abyssal seeds.”

In the Abyss, after saying this, Tianya elder directly left with his people.

They, Tianya, had gained a lot from this battle. For the next battle, they would need the disciples of Tianya to organize themselves to hunt.

After all, the reason why they were able to gain so much this time was because a protector of the imperial court had given them a piece of news.

It could also be considered as a reward for the worldly horizon great sect’s work for the imperial court.

The group left to prepare for what was to come.

At the same time, in Wang Xian’s position, the improvement of the poison-making department this time was huge.

Ba Qi did not enter the Abyss again. Instead, he brought five level 8 immortal King members and Ten Level 7 immortal King members to stay behind.

“Dragon King, my two subordinates have followed the experts from the world’s end back. I’ll leave first to start the preparations.”

Ba Qi looked at the information on the AI and said to Wang Xian with a smile.

“Alright.”

Wang Xian nodded and led ao Qitian and the rest to find a temporary residence nearby to wait quietly. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

...

“Third brother, you’re too disgusting. You actually parasitized on a woman. What the F * ck.”

“What do you know, latching onto a woman will not be suspected. Look, it’s so easy to deal with one person now, this is an undying level 7 warrior, a descendant of elder Tian Ya.”

“Damn, this guy is your corpse’s husband right? Tell me, have you been raped in the past few days?”

“Get lost, quickly latch onto him, the world margin sect has warriors organizing for the past two days.”

On a planet in the central region, this planet was a planet specially given to the world’s end sect by the imperial court’s experts.

A voice came from a courtyard on the planet.

Soon, the middle-aged man who was lying on the side stood up. The middle-aged man and the woman looked at each other and revealed a strange smile.

“Where’s seventh? How is he?”

The middle-aged man asked the woman.

“Old Seven is seducing a deacon. He should have succeeded by now.”

The woman said.

“Yuan Feng and his wife, sorry to bother you.”

At this moment, a voice came from outside, followed by two old men walking over.

The middle-aged woman looked over, and the corners of the four people’s mouths curled up slightly.

“I have some news here. Two days later, a few deacons will lead over a thousand disciples into the Abyss.”

An old man walked over and said.

“I’m following a team. I don’t want this identity anymore. I want to change to another one.”

The woman said directly.

“The boss said that if we parasitize another ten people, we’ll find an opportunity to complete the parasitism in the next two days. With a dozen of us here to take care of them, it’ll be easier to do things.”

“Okay.”

The four of them chatted. The four of them were the true core of the world’s end sect.

There were the descendants of elders and deacons.

There were even the descendants of families who had fought for the world’s End for generations.

No one would have thought that they would “Betray”them.

“Dragon King, three days later, there will be some strong leaders from the world’s end who will enter the abyss to hunt for abyssal seeds. They will send old demon and the others here to assassinate them.”

A day later, Wang Xian received a message from Ba Qi.

“Ao Yao, contact Ba Qi and send some thorny dragons over from the Dragon Palace.”

After Wang Xian received the message, he immediately gave an order to Ao Yao.

“It’s the Dragon King.”

Ao Yao nodded and immediately took action.

“This time, we must be careful when we enter the abyss. Everyone, listen to my orders.”

Three days later, in the Central Region, a group of 200 people flew to the left.

The leader of the group, a deacon from the world margin sect said.

“Yes!”

The group of warriors from the world margin sect nodded and immediately followed behind.

The group of 200 people, the strongest undying emperor level 8, the rest were all undying emperors, this power wasn’t weak.

Their speed was very fast, they immediately became alert after entering the abyss.

“Deacon, let’s go over there, there are people nearby, even if there are abyss seeds, the seeds will still notice the situation here, and if there are people, we have to give some to the other party.”

An hour after entering the abyss, a woman suddenly spoke.

“Alright, let’s go over here. Why didn’t dimensional wind come over this time?”

...

The head deacon nodded and casually asked.

“He had some matters to take care of, so I came over myself.”

The woman smiled faintly.

Deacon horizon nodded and did not ask further in the abyss. After all, this was not a suitable place to chat.

“Stop!”

Just as they were about to arrive in front of a meteorite, the woman suddenly spoke.

“Eh? What’s wrong, Madam Yuan Feng?”

The deacon was slightly startled and immediately asked her who was behind him.

“Deacon, look at that place?”

The woman flew to his side and pointed forward.

“What?”

...

The deacon looked over with a face full of surprise.

“PFFT!”

However at the next moment, a sharp claw pierced through his body, causing his body to freeze.

He stared wide eyed, turning his head in disbelief, staring at the woman.

However when he saw her body slowly split apart, his eyes were filled with shock.

“Madam Yuan Feng, you...”

At this time, the 200 undying emperors behind were shocked.

“Pu Pu Pu!”

However, at the next moment, beams of light and darkness crossed over everyone’s bodies.

“Hehe, Kid, well done.”

Following which, Ba Qi’s voice resounded, his silhouette appeared in front.

“Hehe, thank you boss for your praise.”

A ferocious venomous dragon crawled out of the woman’s body and smiled at Ba Qi.

“Continue working hard.”

Eight Qi smiled and said, waving his arm to clean up all the corpses.

“Yes Boss, 7th Brother is already organizing his men, preparing to lead a few thousand World End Undying Emperors on a hunt, the rewards will be even greater.”

Eight Qi’s underling smiled and said.

“Jie Jie, Alright, remember, don’t get discovered.”

Ba Qi nodded and said with a smile.

“Yes, yes!”

The subordinate immediately nodded respectfully and transformed into an ordinary middle-aged man, flying outside.

“I have to say, Ba Qi, you guys are really sinister and cunning, especially after you evolved into the poisonous horned dragon species.”

Ao Yao, who saw this scene, said indifferently.

“Hehe, it’s not that I’m bragging, as long as I have enough time, the entire imperial court will become the back garden of our poison making department.”

Ba Qi smiled smugly, he was in a good mood.

Before long, he would be able to reach the pinnacle of undying emperor, when that time came, he would be the strongest amongst the leaders of the Dragon Palace.

“Let’s go to the next place.”

Ao Yao smiled and vanished into space.

Offending the eight point poison department was even more terrifying than offending the piercing dragon.
