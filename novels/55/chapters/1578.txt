Chapter 1579: Dragon 1579 has a reverse scale 2

“Jian ‘er, young master ao Tian is here. You should have a good chat with him later!”

On the stage at the front, King Bingxin saw Ling Jian ‘er greeting Wang Xian. He frowned slightly and spoke to her.

“Young Master Ao Tian?”

Ling Jian ‘er was stunned for a moment before nodding her head. “Yes, your majesty. I understand!”

The son of the supreme sect leader of the only sect could possibly inherit the position of sect leader in the future, so she naturally knew that she could not provoke him.

She looked behind her and saw the long-haired young master of Ao Tian, who was wearing the four golden crowns of the only sect leader, flying over.

An arrogant aura blew over.

“Young Master of Ao Tian!”

“Young Master of Ao Tian!”

Ling Jian ‘er, Bing Jing Huan, and the others stood up and greeted ao Tian.

“You are welcome. Looking at sister Jian ‘er up close, she is really beautiful!”

Ao tian sized up Ling Jian ‘ER from top to bottom and did not conceal his words at all.

“Young Master Ao Tian is too modest!”

Ling Jian ‘er felt his gaze and frowned imperceptibly as she said indifferently.

“Sister Jian ‘er, you don’t have to be modest. In the entire vast region, among the women of this generation, who can compare to sister Jian ‘er? Haha!”

Ao Tian smiled and walked to the seat beside Ling Jian ‘ER and sat down.

“Sister Jian ‘er, in the competition later, you might be able to defeat all the disciples of our lone sect!”

He smiled and said to Ling Jian ‘ER.

Ling Jian ‘er nodded her head indifferently and didn’t reply. She looked towards Wang Xian’s seat.

This caused ao Tian, who was at the side, to show a hint of displeasure in his eyes. His gaze turned cold.

Soon, the competition began, and one by one, the young prodigies stepped onto the stage.

Since the start of the competition until today, all of the participants were at the profound void tier.

This caused the blood of many of the surrounding youths to boil, and they cheered loudly.

Ao Tian would occasionally say a few words to Ling Jian ‘ER, but in the end, all he received were indifferent and absent-minded replies.

This caused ao Tian’s expression to become colder and colder.

When the king of Bingxin saw this, his expression turned ugly as well.

“Jian ‘er, it’s your turn!”

More than an hour later, the king of Bingxin said to Ling Jian ‘ER with a smile on his face.

“Yes, your majesty. I will get the first place!”

Ling Jian ‘er nodded her head with a determined expression. Her body moved and she flew towards the arena.

In mid-air, she looked towards Wang Xian and gave him a sweet smile.

“Bing Jian ‘ER has entered the arena. I wonder who will win in a battle with Young Master Tian!”

“With the strength that Bing Jian ‘ER has displayed, it’s obvious that she will be able to win. I really didn’t expect that a woman of her generation would be able to reach the top of the young generation in the vast region!”

“Now, I’m a little envious of Reverend Wang. If such a woman can be obtained, it would be a great fortune!”

“Then you have to have Reverend Wang’s strength as well. Wake Up, Stop Dreaming!”

Ling Jian ‘ER’s appearance caused a heated discussion among the surrounding people.

A woman had the chance to obtain first place in the competition of the lone sect. In the entire vast region, she was also the first person in thousands of years.

Now, there were already people who called her the daughter of Heaven’s pride, the peerless daughter.

“With Jian ‘er’s current strength, she can already kill a powerhouse at level four of the Seethrough Void. That young master Tian is completely no match for Jian ‘er!”

Wang Xian looked at Ling Jian ‘ER’s figure and said to sect leader Ling.

“Hehe, good, good, good!”

Sect leader Ling’s eyes were glued to her as she watched happily.

“Young Master Ao Tian, after the martial arts competition ends, our Bingxin Empire will announce that Jian ‘er will be betrothed to you!”

“Jian ‘er has a cold personality and does not like to talk to strangers. However, as long as you communicate with him frequently, with your outstanding qualities, Jian ‘er will definitely fall in love with you in the future!”

At the front seat, the king of Bingxin looked at Ao Tian, who had an ugly expression, and said with a smile.

“Of course. In the entire vast region, there are not many people who can compare to me!”

Ao Tian felt much better after hearing the king of Bingxin’s words. He raised his head proudly.

“Of course, of course!”

The king of Bingxin nodded with a smile.

“My father also wants to see what kind of woman can make his son admire her!”

Ao Tian took out a mirror and threw it into the sky with a smile.

At the same time, on a mountain tens of thousands of kilometers away.

There was a mountain peak that reached into the clouds.

Each mountain peak was extremely steep and gave off a green light.

In a cave on the mountain peak, an old man was sitting cross-legged in a luxurious room.

The old man was wearing a green robe and there was a vertical scar between his eyebrows. He gave off an aura that transcended all living things. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Haha, I Want To See What Kind of outstanding woman can actually make our Tian ‘er’s heart move!”

The old man looked forward. There was a one-meter-wide mirror there.

In the mirror, the scene of the supreme stage tens of thousands of miles away was completely displayed.

“Husband, I have already checked. She is an extremely outstanding woman. I can’t find another one in the entire vast region!”

A graceful and elegant lady was leaning on the old man’s side and she said with a smile, “Our Tian ‘er is already over a hundred years old. It is time for her to find a wife!”

“There are very few ladies in the world who are worthy of our Tian ‘er. This is not bad!”

The old man smiled and looked at the stage in the mirror, “Let’s take a look first!”

On the stage, the match began.

However, what shocked everyone was that at the start of the match, Ling Jian ‘ER had defeated the two heaven’s favorites in one move.

The Most Outstanding Heaven’s favorite disciple of our sect.

One move, just one move!

Looking at the battle in the mirror, the old man was stunned.

“Haha, good, Good, good. What a rare lady, what a rare lady!”

Following that, the old man stood up with a face full of joy and shouted loudly.

If others saw this, they would definitely be shocked.

Because, this person was the three most powerful peerless experts in the vast region.

The Supreme Headmaster, a rank nine insightful void martial artist.

“As expected of the woman that Tian ‘er took a fancy to. At such a young age, she already has battle strength comparable to a rank four insightful void martial artist. She is even more outstanding than our Tian ‘er, good, good!”

The supreme headmaster laughed heartily, his face full of smiles.

“Only a woman like this has the qualifications to be our daughter-in-law. Husband, we must definitely capture such an outstanding daughter-in-law in our hands!”

The woman at the side also spoke with a face full of joy.

“This is natural. As long as Tian ‘er has taken a fancy to her, there is nothing that can not be obtained in the vast region!”

“I will ask them to immediately bring this woman over!”

The supreme headmaster said straightforwardly.

At the same time, he waved his arm and an object that looked like an imperial edict flew out.

During the flight, lines of words appeared on it.

The imperial edict landed on the peak of a mountain outside and disappeared!

At the same time, in the Supreme Headmaster’s venue, everyone was shocked!
