Translator: 5496903

There were a group of eight people, no more or less. They were dressed exactly the same as when they were in the dragon and Phoenix Royal City. The words ‘six elements sect’were written on their chests.

“Eh? There are more than eight people!”

Wang Xian looked at the seat in front of him and saw two young men. One of them had a head of silver-white long hair. He looked elegant and exuded an otherworldly aura.

The other one had a head of short hair. He sat there emotionlessly.

Wang Xian saw that Xing Tianyi was staring at him coldly. He ignored him and sat on the seat in front of him. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

When Xing Tianyi saw that Wang Xian ignored him, a cold glint flashed in his eyes. He smiled slowly.

His smile was filled with ferocious excitement.

“Kid, I didn’t expect to meet you here!”

As Xing Tianyi spoke, he stood up slowly. He held a wine glass in his hand and stared at Wang Xian coldly.

“Huh?”

A few of Xing Tianyi’s fellow disciples were slightly stunned when they saw him standing up. When they saw Wang Xian, their pupils constricted slightly before their faces turned cold.

“Bang!”

“Enemies have a narrow road!”

A young man placed the wine cup in his hand on the table with a loud and clear sound.

The other seven people stared at Wang Xian coldly. Even the silver-haired young man and the short-haired young man in the innermost corner turned their heads to look at him.

“Tianyi, what’s going on with the few of you? Don’t cause trouble at the second Prince’s banquet. If there’s a problem, we can settle it after the event!”

The silver-haired young man saw that some people were looking in his direction and said to Xing Tianyi indifferently.

“Senior brother, this guy is from the dragon-phoenix dynasty. A few days ago, we went to the dragon-phoenix dynasty with great difficulty, but we were chased out by him in the end. He also said that in their territory, no matter what identity we have, we have to get lost!”

The moment the silver-haired young man finished his words, the only girl among the eight of them immediately pouted and looked at him with an aggrieved expression.

“Is that so?”

The silver-haired young man narrowed his eyes slightly and swept his gaze across Wang Xian. He didn’t say anything.

Seeing that their senior brother didn’t say anything, the corners of Xing Tianyi and the others’lips curled up slightly.

“How did a little brat from the dragon and Phoenix Empire get into this place? Is this a place where you can come?”

The young man sitting in the middle stood up from his seat and walked slowly to Wang Xian’s side. He looked down at him and asked coldly.

Wang Xian saw the two of them standing in front of him. Their eyes were filled with killing intent as they stared at him. He frowned slightly.

“What does it have to do with you guys that I can come here?”

He looked at the people from the six elements sect and said faintly.

“What does it have to do with us? But I want to tell you that this manor is the property of our six elements sect. Hehe, Kid, this is our territory. This is not your dragon and Phoenix Dynasty!”

Xing Tianyi stared at him with a cold face and said slowly.

“Your territory? But I was invited here. Could it be that you can chase me away?”

Wang Xian smiled faintly.

The six element sect was a powerful sect in the Liuhai region. However, their strength was still one level away from the Light Dragon Empire.

He didn’t believe that a six element sect would dare to chase him away when the second prince invited him over.

He sat there calmly without a hint of panic in his eyes.

When Xing Tianyi and the rest heard Wang Xian’s words, they frowned slightly. Clearly, they had some misgivings in their hearts.

“A disciple of our six elements sect went to a small country and was chased out by someone. This is a joke!”

Suddenly, the silver-haired young man who was sitting inside looked at Wang Xian and smiled. “However, if someone really dared to do this, our six elements sect will naturally not let this go!”

“Our six elements sect is extremely hospitable. We will not chase them away. Instead, we will leave them here. This is a place with good feng shui!”

The silver-haired young man said while looking at Wang Xian with a smile on his face. He then looked at the few disciples beside him and said, “Leave the second Prince to me!”

“Oh? Thank you, senior brother. Thank you, senior brother!”

A hint of excitement flashed across the faces of the few young men.

Their senior brother was ranked 20th in the Liuhai region. The second Prince had invited them here mainly for their senior brother.

Not only the second prince, but the other princes of the Light Dragon Dynasty had also invited their senior brother to join them a few days ago.

As the six elements sect, which did not belong to any dynasty, they were the targets of many dynasties.

If their senior brother spoke to the second prince, the second Prince would definitely not say anything.

When they heard their senior brother’s words, all of them stared at Wang Xian with ferocious expressions. “Kid, do you know what the price is for coming to our territory?”

“When you were in the Dragon and Phoenix Royal City, you dared to injure junior brother Xing Tianyi. Have you thought about the consequences?”

The young man standing beside Wang Xian had a mocking expression on his face as he stared at Wang Xian and said slowly.

When Wang Xian saw the expressions on everyone’s faces, his expression turned cold as well. “I really haven’t thought about the consequences of dealing with a few good-for-nothings!”

“You’re courting death!”

Xing tianyi shouted softly as he stared at Wang Xian with a ferocious expression. “You’re about to die, yet you still dare to be so arrogant. This isn’t your tiny country. If you dare to offend us, you shall stay here today!”

“Hehe!”

After Xing Tianyi finished his sentence, the other young men stood up slowly as well. Their auras locked onto him.

“Huh? What’s going on?”

“It’s someone from the six element sect!”

“Who is the young man they are targeting? Why haven’t I seen him before?”

“I haven’t seen him before. However, he must have been invited by the second prince. If the people from the six element sect are targeting him like this, wouldn’t that be a slap to the second Prince’s face?”

“That won’t happen. Yin Xianfeng of the six element sect is currently being courted by several princes. The second prince should give the six element sect some face!”

Xing Tianyi’s shout caused the surrounding people to reveal curious expressions as they discussed in a low voice.

“It’s him...”

At this moment, two men and women in green robes were sitting across from him. That young man raised his brows slightly as an expression of surprise appeared on his face.

“Oh? It really is?”

The girl next to him looked over and nodded slightly.

They had an impression of this young man. Not long after, they had attended the auction of the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty together with their teacher, and happened to see him making a move in the restaurant.

At that time, his strength had slightly surprised even their teacher.

However, he was a bloodline cultivator, so they didn’t take him seriously.

“Big Brother Xu Wenling, do you and miss sa sa know this young man?”

A young man heard their conversation and curiously looked ahead.

“Yes, he’s a disciple who just established a small country. His strength is not bad, but unfortunately, he’s a bloodline cultivator!”

Xu Wenling lightly nodded and said indifferently.

“There is a limit to the cultivation path of bloodline cultivators, and there are very few high-level bloodlines. Their future is limited!”

The young man next to him heard his words and lightly shook his head.
