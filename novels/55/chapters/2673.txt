2674 The abyss of 2674 was expanding

“No, no, no. Run. Run quickly.”

“We’re only at the god-level. How are we supposed to run?”

“I don’t want to die.”

When everyone on the planet that was attacked saw the huge spike heading toward them, the eternal God Lord instantly fled back to his divine kingdom.

However, there were still countless god-level experts on the planet.

They couldn’t instantly return to their God country, only death awaited them.

Rumble

There was no time for anyone to consider, in the next moment, the terrifying spike pierced through the entire planet.

The planet didn’t explode, but it was torn apart, the people on it were filled with panic.

“Howl Howl!”

The undying level 9 abyss species saw this scene, it roared excitedly, flapping its huge wings.

Sou

And that huge spike, after piercing through the planet, actually spun and flew back towards its tail.

At the same time, its tail was once again aimed at a planet, its eyes bloodthirsty.

“Not good, it wants to kill us!”

On the planet it was aiming at, all the warriors and disciples were shocked at the sight, their eyes filled with fear.

“This pinnacle undying emperor abyss seed wants to kill all of us?”

The expressions of everyone on the other planets changed, looking at the shattered planet, they felt like a fox mourning the death of a rabbit.

With their speed, there was no way they could shake off the pursuit of the Undying Godly monarch abyss seed.

Although the experts of the Eternal Godly monarch and undying godly monarch could directly return to their god country to avoid this crisis.

However, all the disciples under the other godly monarchs were about to fall.

These young people were their hope for the future of the northern front.

“Oh no!”

Wang Xian, who was fleeing at the forefront, saw this scene and his expression changed slightly.

If this continued, all the planets would be destroyed by the abyssal seed at the peak of the Godly King realm.

Countless people would die as well.

“Let’s try this weapon. If it really doesn’t work, the Dragon Palace will do their best.”

Wang Xian mumbled as a green gourd appeared in his palm.

“Immortal slaying gourd!”

Wang Xian shouted softly and removed the lid of the gourd. A stream of sword aura flew out instantly and surrounded the top of the gourd.

“Let’s see how powerful you are.”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and stared at the green sword aura in front of him.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

The green sword aura trembled and went straight into the void crack in the next moment.

Under Wang Xian’s senses, the green sword aura attacked the peak-stage king god Abyss species at a terrifying speed.

“Roar!”

The peak-stage king god Abyss species that was about to attack a planet with its sharp tail suddenly felt a strong sense of danger. Its expression changed slightly and it let out a roar.

Its tail quickly changed the direction of its attack and headed straight for the right side of the void.

Weng

The green flying sword also came out from the void crack and clashed with the huge thorn.

Rumble

A terrifying clash resounded and vast energy engulfed the surroundings.

“What’s the situation?”

Everyone on the hundreds of planets that were fleeing had shocked expressions on their faces when they saw the sudden clash.

“Roar!”

At this moment, the roar of the abyssal seed at the peak of the Immortal King realm was heard. The four winged abyssal seed rushed out from the chaotic aftermath. A large amount of blood was flowing from its tail.

It stared forward furiously. It was filled with anger and bloodlust. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Huh? The power is stronger than I imagined!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows.

“All of you, run!”

Wang Xian held the immortal-slaying gourd and shouted softly. A red sword aura appeared in front of him.

“Eh? was that attack from the Dragon King and the rest?”

“Quick, quick, increase the speed. The Dragon King is trying to buy us some time!”

...

“The Dragon King must have used his powerful trump card.”

Some of the powerhouses heard Wang Xian’s words and thought to themselves. All the planets were fleeing frantically.

Boom

At this moment, they saw a flaming long sword tearing through the void from the direction of the Dragon Palace. The terrifying flaming long sword was able to split the void with just a few wisps of flames. From Afar, it looked like a flaming meteor.

The Flaming Long Sword attacked the peak level undying godly monarch abyss species directly.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The peak level undying godly monarch abyss species saw the flaming long sword and raised its head to raise its wings and let out a roar.

“Rumble!”

His wings trembled, powerful darkness laws condensed into solid feathers that clashed against the flame blade.

“Rumble Rumble Rumble!”

A terrifying explosion resounded once again, the Pinnacle Undying Emperor saw the power of the explosion and his expression changed, immediately flying backwards.

...

He spat out another dark torrent.

10 seconds later, the terrifying explosion completely dissipated.

Howl

It let out another enraged howl.

Howl

However at this time, a howl came from behind, the human shaped abyss seed’s blood red eyes stared at it.

Howl Howl

Its gaze swept ahead, its face filled with rage. After letting out a howl, it turned and flew towards the abyss.

“That abyss seed has given up. It has given up on chasing after us. That’s great, that’s Great!”

“Phew, it’s all thanks to the Dragon King and the others acting as a deterrent. Otherwise, we would have been finished!”

“That’s great, that’s great. Thank you, Dragon King, for acting.”

When everyone saw that the Divine King Peak Abyss seed had left, they heaved a heavy sigh of relief and thanked the dragon peak in front of them.

“It’s fortunate that we didn’t chase after them. Otherwise, the hundreds of planets would have been destroyed.”

Wang Xian mumbled and kept the immortal slaying gourd.

“Thank you for your help, Dragon King!”

At this moment, dozens of experts from the great sect, the Dragon Python Group, the Beichuan sect, and the ancient God dynasty flew over and bowed to Wang Xian in gratitude.

“It’s Alright!”

Wang Xian shook his head and swept his gaze across the hundreds of planets. “Where are you guys planning to go?”

His words caused the experts from the various factions to be slightly silent and helpless.

“The starry sky on the northern front has a relatively high concentration of spiritual energy. It’s very suitable for human survival. We can’t afford to return to that place for the time being.”

“There’s a good place over a trillion kilometers ahead of us. Let’s go there first and make a long-term plan.”

“However... we don’t know if the Abyss will expand. If it continues to expand and if the two peak immortal king level abyss seeds don’t leave, we can only head to the center of the Demon Island!”

The chief of last month said with a sullen face.

“Okay.”

Wang Xian nodded and didn’t ask much about them. He looked at them and said, “Later, give me the ocean of a planet. I want to build a palace and a teleportation formation.”

“Of course, there’s no problem. We will immediately send people to make an ocean for you, Dragon King.”

Last month, the chief nodded immediately.

“Alright!”

A smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face.

Although the northern front had fallen, the resources that the Dragon Palace had obtained this time were terrifying.
