Chapter 34: The Ancient Martial Arts Family, Xue Family

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Blessing in disguise, blessing in disguise!

At this point, the old and middle-aged men were looking at the recovering teenager excitedly.

They would have never expected that this mysterious and strong young man would forgo the past and treat their injuries.

The old man couldn’t help but feel fortunate about his initial attitude and the wise decision to give him $10 million.

“It’s done,” Wang Xian stood up and said plainly to the old man.

He had a rather good impression of the old and middle-aged men. When the teenager attacked him, the two of them immediately shouted at the teenager for him to stop.

Subsequently, the old men even apologized sincerely. At that moment, Wang Xian had already forgiven them.

After which, the old man even gave him $10 million! This was the main reason for him to help to cure their injuries.

“Thank you, pal.” Old man, Xue Liangren, clasped his right fist with his left palm as he thanked Wang Xian.

“Thank you, benefactor.”

“Thank you, big brother.”

The middle-aged man and teenager also thank him in succession. Although that teenager was probably older than Wang Xian, he still addressed Wang Xian as big brother.

There’s no way he could not be convinced of Wang Xian’s capabilities.

“It’s alright, you have paid for your medical fees.” Wang Xian waved his hand and said to the old man.

“Pal, these medical fees are nothing compared with my injuries. If there’s anything my Xue Family could help you with, feel free to instruct us. We would not reject you.” Xue Liangren spoke sincerely.

Wang Xian looked at the old man and smiled. He changed his tone before continuing, “There’s something I’m curious about and would like to ask if you are willing to tell me?”

“If I know, I would not keep anything back.” The old man replied in a hurry.

“When it comes to cultivating, do you mind explaining it in detail to me?” Wang Xian asked curiously.

He had no knowledge about martial artists, cultivation and internal energy at all.

“Cultivate?” Xue Liangren was a little shocked. However, he organized his thoughts quickly and said, “The current cultivation ways are known as ancient martial arts. Those who have stepped into the world of ancient martial arts are known as martial artists and are hidden within cities. Although there aren’t a lot of them, the numbers are definitely not small. They exist in the forms of families or sects. Many large corporations are directly or indirectly controlled by martial artist families or sects.”

“Martial artists could be segregated into nine levels. Through absorbing spiritual energy, they are able to open their eight extraordinary meridians. One could advance a level by opening one extraordinary meridian. When all eight extraordinary meridians are opened, one would be at Level Nine. When one had sufficient and complete spiritual energy, they would be classified as “Inborn.” Inborn experts are the real experts in the world. I, Xue Liangren, am not too gifted. I was exposed to ancient martial arts by accident when I was young. Now that I’m 85 years old, I’m only at Level Six and am the number five in Rivertown. This allows me to support my small Xue family.”

“Oh?” Wang Xian nodded his head in deep thought upon hearing what the old man said. The world is mysterious and he wouldn’t find it strange that it had martial artists.

“My son, Xue Jiahua, is pretty capable and is currently at martial artist Level Five. My grandson, Xue Jing, is even more gifted and is at martial artist Level Four,” the old man added. He looked at Wang Xian and continued, “With your strength, you are probably at martial artist Level Seven. You are really insanely gifted and a once in a million years talent.”

Level Seven? Wang Xian was slightly shocked. His current level was only three.

However, his Level Three was based on the divine dragon’s classification. In other words, he could fight with human martial artists four levels above him.

“Level Four martial artists could dodge a bullet and Level Five martial artists could survive under gunfire. When one reaches Level 6, ordinary bullets would not be a threat anymore. At Level Seven, one could ignore bullets. Only concentrated cannon bombardment could kill you. As for Level Eight and Nine, one would be even stronger. When one reached the Inborn stage, one could be the ruler of a region.” Xue Liangren explained this slowly.

Wang Xian nodded his head and broke into laughter. “Thank you for the information. I have some things to attend to and I’ll be leaving now.”

“Eh? Hey, pal, I’ll get Jiahua to send you back.” The old man replied in a hurry.

“It’s alright, I’ll just call for a car.” Wang Xian shook his head and rejected the offer.

“Big brother, let me give you a ride. My car is just right there!”

Xue Jing spoke immediately and pointed to his sports car by the side.

“Yeah pal, let Xiao Jing give you a ride. It would be quicker.” The old man seconded.

“Hmm, alright.” Wang Xian saw the private-hire car left from the entrance of the resort and therefore didn’t reject this time.

“Come, big brother, let me help you carry this. You can just get into the car.”

Xue Jing acted sensibly as he took the large lobsters and swimming crabs at the side before running towards the sports car quickly to open the car door.

Wang Xian nodded at Xue Jing and sat in it directly.

Xue Jing smiled and closed the door carefully.

“Xiao Jing!” At this point, Xue Liangren and the middle-aged man walked over and shouted at Xue Jing.

“Grandfather, father.” Xue Jing walked up immediately and greeted.

“This is the Family membership card for our Summer Sun Holiday Resort. Please pass it to that pal. You must definitely treat him well. This might just be an opportunity for the Xue Family. Remember this! Our Xue Family is still very weak.” Xue Liangren instructed Xue Jing sternly.

“Rest assured, grandfather. I know what I have to do and I won’t be rash.” Xue Jing nodded his head solemnly.

“Hmm... Get this pal back quickly.” Xue Liangren patted him on the shoulders.

“Yes.” Xue Jing got into his car immediately.

“Big brother, where would you like to go?”

“University of Rivertown,” Wang Xian replied with a smile upon hearing how Xue Jing addressed him, seeing the blood stains on his clothes.

“Alright, big brother. Big brother, are you a student at the University of Rivertown? I graduated from that university in the past,” Xue Jing said with a smiling face. He started the car and saw Wang Xian nod his head. At this point, he took out the Family membership card for Summer Sun Resort that his grandfather had passed to him.

This was a “Family membership card.” Although it might sound cliché, it was much more valuable than the platinum or diamond cards that they gave to other customers.

“Family membership card” was representing the Xue Family.

Up till this point in time, the Xue Family had only issued two such cards. One who possessed this card could enjoy the best service in Summer Sun Resort without any cost forever.

Moreover, “family membership card” gave the impression of closeness and could help them shorten the distance between them.

“Big brother, this is a “Family membership card” for our Summer Sun Resort and is our highest grade card. With this card, you can enjoy the most premium service at no cost forever. If big brother has the time, you can drop by. Feel free to bring your friends along.”

Xue Jing held the card beside Wang Xian as he explained.

Summer Sun Resort?! When Wang Xian saw this card, he was a little surprised. “Summer Sun Resort is your family’s property?”

“Yes, big brother. We have another Summer Sun International Hotel in the city too. This card could also be used there. Big brother, please accept this,” replied Xue Jing.

“It’s alright, it’s alright. Wang Xian was slightly stunned. He had not expected the family of three generations would be the owner of Summer Sun Resort. This explained why they could take out $10 million as compensation directly.

“Big brother, you have to accept it. I’m under the orders of my grandfather and father. Otherwise, I will be beaten by them when I get back.” Xue Jing turned around and acted pitifully.

What the! Wang Xian was speechless when he saw how he acted.

Acting cute? You are a grown up now! Is it fine to act cute in front of me? Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

And keep calling me ‘big brother’...
