Chapter 1213: 1214 name of the Sword Demon

Translator: 5496903

The sword in the water pierced through the golden sword and attacked the two insightful void martial experts of the Meng clan.

The huge and strange clouds in the sky covered all the people of the Meng clan. The sword rain attacked downwards.

The group of people in front of the sword mansion hid in all directions in fear.

“Since you want to die with this kid, then die!”

When the two elders of the Meng clan saw that Wang Xian dared to attack them directly, a terrifying killing intent flashed in their eyes.

The longswords in their hands attacked the underwater sword and the gold-piercing sword.

“What?”

When they collided with the underwater sword and the gold-piercing sword, shock appeared on their faces.

“Wind Soul!”

“Blind Eye!”

The long swords in their hands shook, and they swung the water sword and the gold-piercing sword to attack again.

They thought that they could break these two attacks with one sword, but they didn’t expect that these two attacks were so powerful that they were shocked. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

They were almost as powerful as the divine abilities they used!

“The sword rain in the sky is also very powerful!”

When they defeated the sword in the water and the gold-piercing sword five or six times in a row, the densely packed sword rain in the sky had already fallen.

The power of the sword rain came to the sky, making them slightly surprised.

“Wind shield!”

“Tornado Sword!”

The two immediately met the sword rain in the sky.

“Ahhhh!”

Suddenly, at this moment, screams came from the surroundings.

“What?”

Their expressions changed and they quickly looked around.

At this moment, a rain of swords fell from the sky within a two-kilometer radius of them.

The rain of swords not only had the penetration of raindrops, it also had the sharpness of metal attributes.

A drop of water could penetrate a stone, but what could a drop of metal sword water penetrate?

When the two attributes were completely fused together, the power that erupted was absolutely beyond everyone’s imagination.

Dual-attribute cultivators were able to fight above their level because they relied on the strength of the combination of the two attributes.

“What? How is this possible?”

“Oh my God, what is this?”

Everyone who had retreated from the battle area looked forward with shock on their faces.

Countless sword rain fell from the sky and directly attacked the Meng clan’s 200 plus people.

Under the dense and terrifying sword rain, warriors below rank 8 of the exceptional realm were directly turned into dead souls under the sword rain.

80% of the Meng clan’s people, close to 200 people, directly fell under the sword rain’s attack.

They didn’t have the ability to resist at all. Only warriors who had reached rank 8 of the exceptional realm could use their divine abilities to defend and barely resist the sword rain that was attacking them.

“Sword in the water, piercing golden sword, True Sword Rain!”

“It’s a senior, definitely a senior!”

The young man in tattered clothes standing at the side looked at Wang Xian in a daze. His eyes were filled with endless gratitude.

The last time, when he was about to die in the sword tomb, that figure saved him and gave him a powerful inheritance, a level one void interpretation weapon.

Today, when he was about to be killed, this figure came to help him kill the enemy.

“If I, Ren Xingchen, don’t die, if one day I get my revenge, I, Ren Xingchen, will definitely do my best to repay your kindness!”

The tattered young man, Ren Xingchen, had a determined look in his eyes as he tightly gripped the sword in his hand.

“What a terrifying sword art, dual attributes, it’s definitely dual attributes!”

At this moment, Ling Jian ‘er flew over from the outside. When she saw the battle in front of the Sword Manor, she was slightly stunned.

When she saw the terrifying rain of swords, a look of shock appeared on her face.

“Dual attributes, 100% dual attributes. However, why is his attribute attack hidden? He actually can’t sense it?”

Ling Jian ‘er looked at the terrifying sword rain and revealed a look of astonishment.

The heaven-deceiving pearl could change the fluctuation of attributes, but the nature of the attack could not be changed.

Wang Xian was naturally clear about this situation. The heaven-deceiving Pearl’s purpose was to hide the attacks of his five attributes, not to hide his dual attributes.

Although dual attributes warriors were monstrous, it was still within the acceptable range of everyone.

Such a situation of five attributes had never happened in the entire transcendence continent.

Therefore, Wang Xian used the heaven-deceiving Pearl to change all his attacks into black.

To the people outside, all attacks were black.

It was also because of this that the black clouds in the sky made everyone feel strange.

“Bastard, you killed a member of the Meng clan. Don’t even think about escaping today!”

“Kill him!”

The two insightful emptiness realm experts of the Meng clan had extremely gloomy expressions. Their eyes were twitching violently and their bodies were filled with killing intent.

Their bodies moved and they attacked Wang Xian directly.

“How... how did it turn out like this...”

Meng Shaoqin looked at the 200 dead members of the Meng clan and his expression was a little stunned.

These 200 over people were all elite disciples of the Meng clan. The Meng clan had sent out so many people because a large-scale mansion was discovered in the tomb of the demi-human.

However, now, he was killed by a powerhouse who appeared out of nowhere just because he wanted to kill a kid from the mountains.

This made his head a little muddled!

“When you kill others, you must be prepared to be killed. Haha!”

Wang Xian laughed maniacally. He didn’t show any signs of fear as he looked at the two insightful emptiness realm experts who were attacking him.

He brandished the demon-free sword in his hand and unleashed an extreme explosion of ice and fire. The extremely hot sea of water and the golden wood explosion met the two of them directly.

“Damn it, this guy is so strong!”

The two elders of the Meng clan felt the terror of the three attacks and their faces turned gloomy.

The opponent was actually able to gain the upper hand in a one-on-two battle. This made their eyes filled with solemnity.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The sound of explosions rang out. The battle between the three insightful emptiness realm experts had affected a radius of five to six kilometers.

Everyone hurriedly retreated backward once again.

Wang Xian’s eyes were as sharp as a torch. He combined skills one by one and attacked the two of them without any hesitation.

He now had seven to eight skills, and he had almost ten combined skills.

With each attack, he would directly release the skills and combined skills.

With each attack, he had to make the two insightful emptiness realm experts resist it completely.

For a moment, the wind and clouds in front of the entire sword mansion surged. Terrifying attacks surged and spread over a dozen kilometers.

Everyone within a dozen kilometers could sense the attacks from the insightful emptiness realm experts.

“Kill that Kid First!”

Meng Shaoqin saw that the mysterious person who had suddenly appeared in the sky was engaged in a fierce battle with the two elders of the Meng clan. His face was extremely anxious.

He stared ahead and saw Ren Xingchen standing there. He gritted his teeth and roared ferociously.

Around him, there were about thirty disciples of the Meng Clan. However, the weakest of these thirty disciples was at the 8th rank of the extraordinary realm.

When they heard Meng Shaoqin’s words, they looked at each other. Their eyes were ice-cold as they stared at Ren Xingchen. They were filled with killing intent.

This brat who was the main culprit must die!
