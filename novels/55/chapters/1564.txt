Chapter 1565: 1565 saint of Light 4

“Priest Wang!”

When the owner of the Holy Medicine Shop said these three words, the people around were stunned.

The name of priest Wang was like thunder to all the priests of light and even some of the youths in the vast area.

He publicly insulted the son of light as trash and threw him down from the fourth floor.

Furthermore, he even said that the daughter of light was trash.

Other than that, what shocked everyone the most was that priest Wang had humiliated two heaven’s favorites from the solipsistic sect.

He injured them on the spot.

Everyone knew the arrogance and strength that he displayed.

“What level of Darkness Soul had invaded the youth that priest Wang was healing?”

The bald black-eyed elder heard the shock and discussion of the people around him and slightly raised his eyebrows.

“Reporting to my lord, it should be around rank one or rank two of the void interpretation!”

Old Hu did not dare to hide anything and hurriedly replied.

When the bald black-eyed elder heard his reply, he slowly frowned. Clearly, he was somewhat disappointed.

“Invaded by a rank one or rank two darkness soul, we also have the strength to heal it!”

“That’s right, it’s not too difficult to get rid of the soul of darkness that has entered us!”

Some of the priests who had entered the sixth rank of the profound void sect heard this and said calmly.

“That guy has offended two heaven’s favorites from the only sect in the sky and earth. He might have already been killed in the Dark!”

When Tian Qing Guang heard this name, he said with a malevolent expression.

Towards that fellow who dared to insult him, he wanted nothing more than to tear him into pieces.

“A youth who can only heal a rank one or rank two darkness soul is completely useless. Let’s wait for our dawn light ancestor to arrive First!”

A Divine Light Dynasty rank seven darkness soul priest said.

All the surrounding light priests nodded in agreement.

The morning light ancestor could be called the ancestor of the entire world of light priests.

The profession of light priest wasn’t born for a long time. The one who developed it and continued to develop it was the divine light dynasty’s morning light ancestor.

No one could object to him saying that he was the number one person in the world of light wood.

“Ancestor, grandfather, we can find that priest Wang to give it a try!”

At this moment, Wu Qingyan and Wu Qingyan looked at each other. After hesitating for a moment, they said to the bald elder with black eyes and the elder holding the dark scepter.

“Huh?”

The elder holding the dark scepter looked at the two of them with a trace of curiosity.

When Tian Qingguang heard this, his expression changed slightly.

“Princess Qingyan, that priest Wang has already disappeared. I guess he has already been destroyed. Where can we find a dead person!”

He said with an ugly expression.

“Impossible. With the strength of the two heaven’s favorites of our sect in heaven and earth, it’s impossible to kill him!”

Wu Qingyan shook her head with certainty.

“Oh? Qingyan? That priest Wang is very powerful?”

An elder of Wuji Empire looked at Wu Qingyan and asked.

“Very powerful. My brother and I have investigated his information. His level is the same as my uncle’s. He’s not even thirty years old. Under his push, the Liuhai region was unified. As soon as he arrived in the vast region, he directly destroyed the second-rate force, Atlas Sword Sect!”

“This person is very mysterious. His control over the light is very abnormal. As long as our sect doesn’t send a level 8 profound void martial expert, it will be very difficult to kill him!”

Wu Qingyan said to the elders and experts of the Wuji Empire with a grave expression.

“What?” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

However, Wu Qingyan’s two words caused the middle-aged man who asked earlier to reveal a shocked expression.

The surrounding experts from the Wuji Empire were all shocked.

Even the eyes of the bald-headed black-eyed elder narrowed slightly. His eyes were filled with shock.

A rank 7 profound void martial expert who was not even 30 years old?

This was simply shocking news.

Wu Qingcheng, an outstanding disciple of the Wuji Imperial family that they had met 5,000 years ago, was currently in his 50s and was only at the peak of rank 3 profound void martial.

Now, such a monstrous existence had appeared!

“How... How is this possible?”

The surrounding radiant priests revealed expressions of disbelief.

“Seventh level of the profound void martial stage, he’s actually at the seventh level of the profound void martial stage?”

Tian Qing Guang’s gaze was dazed, his gaze somewhat absent-minded.

Seventh level of the profound void martial stage, this was the seventh level of the profound void martial stage. His father, the current emperor of the Divine Light Empire, was only at the seventh level of the profound void martial stage.

However, that young man had actually reached the seventh level of the insightful void realm.

No wonder he dared to say that Wu Qingyan was trash. He dared not give face to the two heaven’s favorites of the only sect.

“This guy...”

Tian Qingguang’s face was a little twisted. He clenched his fists tightly, full of unwillingness.

“Qingyan, are you serious?”

The elder holding the dark staff looked over with a serious face and asked.

“Grandfather, this is the news that our dynasty’s dark mansion received!”

Wu Qingyan nodded.

The eyes of the elder holding the dark staff flickered, filled with astonishment.

“Qingyan, do you know where that young man is? call him over!”

The bald elder with black pupils looked at Wu Qingyan and said directly.

“I don’t know!”

Wu Qingyan shook her head and frowned.

“Sister, is he in the He clan? He Yuan of the He clan has a very good relationship with him!”

Wu Qingyan frowned and asked.

“I don’t know if he is in the He clan, but Ling Jian ‘er of the Bingxin dynasty will definitely be able to find him!”

Wu Qingyan’s eyes flickered as she said.

That priest Wang came to their vast area for Ling Jian ‘er, so Ling Jian ‘er should know where he is.

“Send someone to the He clan and invite the He clan’s people over. Also, go to the Bingxin dynasty and invite that Ling Jian ‘er over!”

The bald black-eyed elder directly ordered.

“Yes, Patriarch!”

Several experts from the Wuji dynasty immediately nodded and quickly flew towards the He clan and Bingxin dynasty.

“Ahhhh!”

Right at this moment, Wu Qing city’s miserable cries continued to ring out. His face was as malevolent as a devil, and he looked abnormally terrifying.

Everyone from Wuji Empire hurriedly looked over, their faces filled with sighs and helplessness.

“When our morning light ancestor arrives, he will definitely expel the darkness soul from the body of Wu Qing city’s crown prince!”

“That’s right, our morning light ancestor is the number one radiant priest. Although that radiant priest Wang’s talent is monstrous, his true strength is still far from our ancestor’s!”

The people of Bingxin dynasty glanced at the radiant priests who were still in shock and said with a slightly embarrassed expression.

“That’s right. Although that priest Wang is extraordinary, his strength is still far from our forefather’s!”

Tian qingguang gritted his teeth and said with a firm gaze.

“Buzz!”

“Lord Dark Pupil, Dawn Light has come to pay his respects!”

At this moment, an elder who was surrounded by milky white light flew over from the horizon. It was as if he had descended from the sky.

A gentle voice spread across the entire front of the palace.

The elder had a head full of white hair, beard, and brows. He was shrouded in light and looked divine and dignified!

He held a white horsetail whisk in his hand and flew in front of the black-eyed bald elder from the Wuji Empire. He called out respectfully.
