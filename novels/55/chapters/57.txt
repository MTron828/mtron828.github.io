Everyone in the banquet hall was attracted by the commotion and gathered over inquisitively.

Wang Xian looked at Master Bi San, Director Wu, Director Gong and Director Song with indifference and said plainly, “I have already beaten them. What do you guys want?”

“How arrogant of you to admit to beating them. Hehe, what do you think your outcome will be after beating Master Bi San’s son?”

A young man stood out and ridiculed Wang Xian upon hearing Wang Xian’s reply.

“How? That’s a good question. That’s a good question.” Master Bi San looked at the arrogant Wang Xian and sneered. “We are at Qin Family’s banquet so I wouldn’t do anything yet. Once the banquet ends, I’ll let you experience desolation. I’ll let you know the outcome of crippling my son!”

“Young lad, I don’t care what kind of backing you have. I’ll let you experience what is worse than death today!” Director Wu stared fiercely at Wang Xian.

“I wonder who brought this under-dressed lad in today. However, I wouldn’t care who he is. You will pay the price for what you have done today!” Director Song roared at Wang Xian.

“Who would have expected this lad to be so crazy to cripple the sons of Master Bi San, Director Gong, Director Song, and Director Wu. He must be really eager to die.”

“Yeah, yeah. To wear casual attire to attend a banquet, his upbringing must be really bad!”

“He truly deserves death. Even if the people of the four families were to cripple him, it wouldn’t be considered overboard. If this lad were to even touch my son, I’d kill him no matter what!”

The crowd started dissing and criticizing Wang Xian

“How could he wear such attire to attend this banquet. In my opinion, we should throw him out,” the young man who spoke previously said towards Wang Xian once again.

“Shut up!”

Wang Xian sneered upon hearing the criticism of the crowd and the group of arrogant people from the four families.

“Who the f*ck do you think you are? Asking me to shut up?” the young man shouted at Wang Xian the moment Wang Xian completed his sentence. He walked to the side of Master Bi San and said, “Master Bi San, this kid is really arrogant to beat Xiuming. Let him know the consequences today.”

“He’s really arrogant. It’s been a long time since I’ve seen such an arrogant young man.” Master Bi San looked coldly at Wang Xian.

“Excuse me.”

Suddenly, a cold voice propagated from the entrance. Following which, a beautiful lady walked over.

She was in a red dress and had light makeup on her. Overall, she gave off a distant feel to others.

Her entrance attracted the attention of many people instantly. Many young men looked towards this figure fervently.

The eyes of the young man standing beside Master Bi San lit up as he clenched his fist tightly.

“The eldest daughter of the Lan Family, Lan Qingyue.”

“She’s the future successor of the Lan Family, Lan Qingyue. The one beside her is the General Manager of the Lan Family, Lan Gongwen. He is also Lan Qingyue’s uncle.”

“The future successor of Deep-sea Jewelry, Lan Qingyue. They are the strongest listed company in Rivertown and could be considered as the leaders in the jewelry industry in the country.”

Some people saw Lan Qingyue and exclaimed softly.

“Hi, uncles, my friend is at fault for this incident. I would like to ask for forgiveness on his behalf.” Lan Qingyue looked at Wang Xian and the cold look in her eyes flickered for a moment. She walked to the side of him and looked towards Master Bi San and the group.

“What? Why would Lan Qingyue try to protect this kid?”

“What’s the matter? Could it be that this lad has a good relationship with the Lan Family?”

The surrounding crowd was surprised. Some people were even looking at Lan Qingyue with shock.

Wang Xian was also looking at Lan Qingyue with bewilderment. He had not expected to see her at this place and had not expected her to help him.

Lan Qingyue turned her head over, smiled at Wang Xian and commented, “What a coincidence!”

This smile was just as beautiful as a hundred flowers blooming at the same time. The cold-looking Lan Qingyue had an indescribable charm.

“Thank you!” Wang Xian expressed his gratitude to Lan Qingyue. Recalling that he had rejected her invitation for a meal twice, he suddenly felt a little embarrassed.

Lan Qingyue smiled and nodded her head. She turned her attention towards Director Wu, Director Gong, Director Song, and Master Bi San. “Dear uncles, please look past this incident for my sake.”

Miss Lan. When Director Wu, Director Gong and the group saw Lan Qingyue, their expressions changed.

Deep-sea Jewelry was a large corporation with a market capitalization of close to $10 billion. This was more than ten times greater than theirs.

Even if the four families added their assets together, they still wouldn’t be a match for Deep-sea Jewelry.

The only one who wasn’t wary was Master Bi San. This was because Bi Family was an Ancient Martial Artist Family and couldn’t be measured directly using typical cash value and background.

However, Master Bi San still wasn’t very pleased. After all, a family that was worth $10 billion would have a complicated and widely connected background. When one’s money reached an outrageous amount, it could also be seen as one’s strength.

“Miss Lan, this friend of yours crippled the arms and legs of my son. Aren’t you being unreasonable to ask me to let this go!” Master Bi San stared at Lan Qingyue but his eyes were flickering.

“That’s right, Miss Lan. My son was crippled because of him. If I just let this go, how would anyone show us respect in the future?” Director Wu added with a solemn face.

“Uncles, I, Lan Qingyue, am willing to compensate for the injuries of your beloved sons. Please don’t pursue this matter anymore for my sake,” Lan Qingyue said with a determined look.

Lan Qingyue’s words caused the atmosphere of the surroundings to solidify.

No one would have expected that the eldest daughter of Lan Family would try to protect this wild lad and disregard the fact that she would be going up against four families.

This caused a lot of young men in the crowd to be filled with jealousy. This lad doesn’t deserve this at all!

Guan Shicheng’s expression also changed as he looked on with disbelief.

Director Wu, Director Gong, Director Song and Master Bi San had a ghastly look. They had not expected that the eldest daughter of the Lan Family would be so insistent on this matter, disregarding the chances of offending them in order to protect this young man. This caused them to be very embarrassed by the situation.

“What? What’s the matter?”

However at this moment, a frivolous voice sounded. A middle-aged man walked over from the inner area of the banquet hall and looked inquisitively towards the center.

Everyone was surprised and turned their attention to their back. All of them saw a middle-aged man carrying an apple in hand, eating it while walking.

“Second Master Qin!”

“Second Master Qin!”

Some people in the crowd immediately gave their greetings to this middle-aged man.

Second Master Qin was looking a little pale and had serious eye bags. He also looked like a frivolous guy who liked to fool around.

When the crowd saw his behavior, they didn’t look down on him. Instead, they were addressing him as “Second Master Qin” with the utmost respect.

This was because he was the second son of Old Qin, or an adopted son.

Old Qin had a total of two sons. The second son was adopted and was the son of a war comrade of Old Qin. After his war comrade had passed away, he asked Old Qin to take care of his son. Old Qin took him in and adopted him as his son immediately. However, this adopted son was arrogant and cocky from a young age and got into a lot of trouble in Rivertown. He even caused the death of some people. Despite nearing his forties, he still wasn’t married and didn’t have a child. Rumors had it that he had a strange fetish and Old Qin wasn’t too fond of him.

Despite all that, Old Qin valued relationships and had been turning a blind eye to the actions of this adopted son.

Although he was an adopted son, he was still the second master in the Qin Family. No matter how useless he might be, he was still high above the rest as his identity was known to everyone.

“Second Master.” Master Bi San immediately called out Second Master Qin when he saw him. Bi Family was inferior to Xue Family and was even further behind Qin Family. When Master Bi San saw Second Master Qin, he still had to greet him politely.

Moreover, Master Bi San had always had a good relationship with Second Master Qin.

“What’s the matter Master Bi San?” Second Master Qin asked Master Bi San before biting his apple.

“Second Master, please be the judge for us in this matter.” Master Bi San explained the whole situation to Second Master Qin. In the end, he whispered something to Second Master Qin.

“What! Such a thing has happened?” Second Master Qin looked ahead and his vision fell onto Wang Xian and Lan Qingyue. “Oh niece Qingyue, it’s better if you stay out of this. This lad deserved the punishment for breaking the arms and legs of others.” [1]

Waa!

Upon hearing Second Master Qin’s words, the crowd erupted.

“Since Second Master Qin has spoken, it would be pointless even if Lan Qingyue put in a good word for him. This lad is as good as dead.”
