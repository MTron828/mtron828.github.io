“Why don’t you try killing one of them?”

On the city wall, Wang Xian looked at tsunami sky and the group of ocean cultivators in amusement.

They might not have understood what kind of existence they were threatening.

“HMM?”

Tsunami Sky looked at Wang Xian’s teasing gaze and frowned slightly. He stared at Feng Luan and the rest who were surrounded.

There were more than a thousand people. Under their encirclement, they did not panic at all. They stood there very calmly.

They did not even look at the soldiers around them.

This made him suspicious. His eyes were flickering.

Could it be that there were experts among this group of people?

The situation at the city wall had attracted the attention of the people of Shenghai town.

Because the city gate had been broken through by the ferocious beasts, they could see the outside of the town from the inside.

Some of the citizens flew up to the city wall curiously when they saw Wang Xian.

“What are these despicable people from the ocean cultivators army doing?”

“I don’t know. The people who are surrounded outside seem to be friends of Lord Wang!”

“F * ck, what are these despicable people trying to do now?”

The citizens who rushed over looked outside angrily.

Now, as long as it was related to Wang Xian, the people of Shenghai town were extremely irritable.

“Fine, fine, make your move. As long as you don’t withdraw the formation, I will kill all of your friends right in front of you!”

Upon hearing the curses from the crowd on the city wall, tsunami Sky’s eyes were filled with fury as he spoke furiously.

Over the past few days, he had been scolded by the people of Shenghai town from time to time. This had already made him extremely furious.

“All of you bastards, Stop!”

“Stop immediately. Otherwise, don’t blame us for being impolite in the future!”

Some of the citizens of Shenghai Town who were unaware of the situation were standing on top of the wall and shouting anxiously.

Their shouts caused more people to come over.

Wang Xian smiled slightly when he saw the situation on the city wall. However, he didn’t say anything.

This was good as well. He wanted to let the people of Shenghai town see the strength of Feng Luan and the rest so that they could prepare for her to take charge of this place.

Feng Luan looked at Wang Xian before looking at the sea cultivators around her.

“I’ll leave these troubles to you guys!”

Wang Xian smiled and said to Feng Luan.

“Alright!”

Feng Luan nodded her head faintly and gestured to the middle-aged man with a feather fan beside her.

“Kill a few hundred of them first!”

However, at this moment, tsunami Sky’s cold roar sounded.

At this time, he couldn’t care less whether these people were experts or not. He also didn’t believe that these people who were surrounded by them could be comparable to them.

“Attack!”

The burly middle-aged man with the huge axe raised the axe in his hand and shouted.

“Ha!”

A shout was heard in unison!

“Bastard!”

“Damn it! Damn it!”

The people of Holy Sea Town who didn’t know the situation were furious when they saw them attacking their lord Wang’s friend.

“Attack!”

The middle-aged man holding the feather fan opened the feather fan in his hand and ordered.

“Boom!” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

At this moment, thousands of middle-aged men in red shirts moved behind them.

A terrifying aura burst out from their bodies.

“Buzz, Buzz, Buzz, Buzz!”

The aura of level seven, level eight, level nine, and even half-step void interpretation was released in an orderly manner.

The Aura that burst out in that instant caused the entire world to change color.

There were around 500 level seven transcendents, 300 to 400 level eight transcendents, and more than 100 level nine transcendents.

As for those who were half-step void interpretation, there were no less than twenty.

“Leave this guy to me!”

The two-meter-tall man standing behind Feng Luan, who was holding a large saber, stared at the tsunami. He roared and instantly disappeared.

“King, should we get rid of that demonic beast in the Sky?”

The middle-aged man holding the red staff looked up at the sky and asked respectfully.

“Get rid of it!”

Feng Luan nodded and said directly.

“Yes!”

They moved!

The people behind Feng Luan all moved.

However, the moment they moved, the bodies of the tens of thousands of ocean cultivators and the soldiers who were about to make a move froze.

Their eyes slowly revealed fear.

“Boom!”

“Ah!”

At this moment, screams of terror rang out. Everyone in the ocean cultivator corps looked over with endless fear on their faces.

In their eyes, their general, the invincible commander in their hearts, an expert at the profound void realm, was actually sent flying.

In fact, they didn’t even see how their general was sent flying.

At this moment, tsunami sky, who was spitting out blood, stared at the big man in front of him with a face full of despair.

In that instant just now, he didn’t even have time to react before he was struck in the chest by a punch.

He felt as if his internal organs had been shattered.

He looked at the big man in his line of sight, his gaze somewhat absent-minded.

How was this possible?

He was a powerhouse at the insightful void Tier, and he was the strongest powerhouse in star-moon kingdom.

How could any burly man injure him so severely? What frightened him the most was that his opponent had clearly not used his full strength just now.

That was because his blade had yet to strike!

“Beast, come out and surrender!”

At this moment, he heard a voice that was filled with authority. Immediately after, he saw a fiery-red chain directly pierce into the clouds.

It was heading towards the sky a few thousand meters high.

The chain was fiery-red, and it contained a terrifying temperature.

“Not good, not good. A powerhouse, a top-tier powerhouse, a top-tier powerhouse of the human race!”

The leader of the blood barbaric demon beasts, who had been hiding in the sky, saw the middle-aged man suddenly attacking him, and his heart pounded violently.

He had been hiding in the sky a few thousand meters high, and even the profound void tier general had not noticed him in the past few days.

However, that middle-aged man had directly and accurately attacked him.

The terrifying majesty contained within that chain made it tremble.

“Flee, flee, Flee!”

The Blood Savage Beast Leader’s expression was extremely unsightly. Without the slightest hesitation, it wanted to flee into the distance in fear.

However, that fiery red chain was like a soul chasing chain, and its speed suddenly increased, reaching a terrifying level.

“Pa Pa Pa!”

The sound of collision was heard. The leader of the Blood Barbarian Demon Beast was full of fear. Its sharp arm directly chopped at the chain.

“Ah!”

At the moment of collision, the face of the Blood Barbarian Demon Beast changed, and it let out a blood-curdling scream.

The chain coiled, directly wrapping around the leader of the Blood Barbarian Demon Beast!

“Don’t kill me, don’t kill me!”

The leader of the Blood Barbaric Demon Beast begged for mercy in fear.

It realized in despair that it could not break the chains by itself. The opponent’s strength was at least at the second level of the profound void tier.

A human expert at the second level of the profound void tier was not something it, a demon beast that had just advanced to the profound void tier, could deal with.

The leader of the Blood Barbaric Demon Beast was extremely miserable. It organized fierce beasts to attack the city, but the city was not taken down. All of its subordinates were killed.

Now that he had swallowed his subordinates and was preparing to take revenge and massacre the city, a group of terrifying human experts had suddenly appeared.

How could there be so many experts in this tiny star-moon kingdom!
