Chapter 825: 0826 gods

Translator: 549690339

In the Western European continent, there were a total of seven major divine domains: the Garden of Eden Divine Domain, the ancient Greek divine domain, the Golden Pagoda Divine Domain, the Northern European divine domain, the Roman divine domain, the dark divine domain, and the Holy Blood Divine Domain.

There were quite a few gods in each divine domain.

They were different from the immortal sects. These gods were high and mighty, and they had their own disciples. Their levels were almost the same: Lower Gods, middle gods, and upper gods.

The power of the divine realm was much stronger than that of the immortal sects. Each divine realm had more than ten or even twenty immortal gods.

It was even said that the strongest divine realm in northern Europe had more than thirty gods. Overall, if Wang Xian had not destroyed the cauldron of Yu and the Holy Doctor and Holy Medicine Immortal sect, the difference between the powers of the immortal sects and the divine realm was not that great.

However, Wang Xian had destroyed two cauldrons at once, causing the power of the divine territory to be slightly stronger than that of the celestial sect.

The Garden of Eden Divine Territory could be considered a relatively strong divine territory. Moreover, their divine territory was suitable for the growth of plants and had many spiritual herbs.

When he was collaborating with the celestial sect in the western divine territory, Wang Xian had considered collaborating with the Garden of Eden.

Once the collaboration was successful, the Dragon Palace would be able to increase the number of celestials by at least ten.

However, he did not have much hope for the collaboration to be successful.

“Dragon King, we have contacted the people from the Garden of Eden. They said that if they want to talk, they would like you to head to the island country. Their God will be there to take care of things!”

On the second day, Mo Qinglong said to Wang Xian.

“Island country, is it? Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian thought for a moment before nodding. “Activate the floating island and head to the island country. Get Ready, we will head there now.”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Mo Qinglong nodded.

Wang Xian moved his body and flew towards the sea above the Dragon Palace. He landed on the floating island beside him.

The floating island was moving at a very fast speed. It was not too far from here to the island country.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Wang Xian stood on the island. Suddenly, he saw a group of people flying past in the sky not far away. Among them, there were four to five immortals leading the group.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian had a surprised look on his face.

“Dragon King, they are people from the celestial sect of jianghu. Recently, the celestial sect of Jianghu has joined forces to wipe out the forces in the sub-continent!”

Mo Qinglong explained to him.

Wang Xian nodded slowly. He had heard from a Jiaya a few days ago.

After the celestial sect of Huaxia forbade them from attacking, they were short of resources. Subsequently, some celestial sects joined forces and decided to attack other forces.

Destroying these forces would allow them to obtain huge amounts of resources.

In just a month’s time, the celestial sect of the pugilistic world had conquered more than half of the sub-continent. Many forces with celestial beings had been wiped out.

The might of the Huaxia Immortal sect had once again spread across the entire world. The mysterious eastern country, which had been sleeping, had awakened once again.

All the forces that had immortals in the sub-continent had been wiped out. Those who had surrendered had surrendered.

The floating island was close to the imperial capital of the island nation. A huge snowy mountain in the distance could be seen clearly.

“Contact them!”

Wang Xian said to Mo Qinglong.

“Dragon King, we have already contacted them. Their people will be here to fetch us soon!”

Mo Qinglong replied.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded. After waiting for about ten minutes, the two of them flew over on their Pegasus.

The two of them were dressed in golden continental European knight attire and they were equipped with Knight Swords. They exuded a pure continental aura.

The Pegasus was extremely white and was at least three meters tall. It exuded an innate aura.

“This must be the Dragon King. Please follow us!”

The two knights gave a standard knight’s bow and said to Wang Xian.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded. The two of them mounted their horses and flew directly towards the snow mountain.

Wang Xian followed behind them. Ao Jian and the gold race were followed by the two immortals. Mo Qinglong was at the back.

They came to a small mountain peak beside the snow mountain. Cherry trees covered the entire mountain peak, making it very beautiful.

There were houses halfway up the mountain.

Two Knights landed on a platform on a mountain peak and jumped down directly. “Dragon King, Please!”

Wang Xian nodded. His gaze swept across the surroundings. There were many wooden houses that were unique to the island nation. He walked straight to the front.

“Haha, Dragon King, Please Come In!” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

When he came to a room in the middle, a hearty laughter could be heard. Wang Xian entered the room and saw more than a dozen people sitting inside.

Eleven men and two women were among them.

Six men wore divine crowns on their heads and divine staffs on their sides. They were extremely luxurious.

Two women had flower baskets and holy bottles beside them.

“Hello, Dragon King. I am known as the god of light, the right hand of God. This is the god of flowers, the god of wood, the God of heaven, the god of trees, the Angel...”

One of the white-bearded old men was emitting a faint glow. He introduced to Wang Xian with a smile on his face.

“Hello, everyone!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly and sat down at the seat that they had indicated.

His gaze landed on five middle-aged and old men.

These five men were dressed in black. In the middle of their attire, there were ferocious poisonous snakes. They were the local deities of the island nation.

“Dragon King, have a taste. Our Garden of Eden has used a special method to store the divine wine for 500 years. The effect of this wine is not weaker than a grade-6 Elixir!”

In the middle of the table sat a burly old man. The old man was called an angel, and he was also of the light attribute.

The God of Light, who was known as the right hand of God, was obviously respected by the old man.

The gods in the West inherited their position of God.

The position of God was fixed. For example, in the Nordic divine territory, there were the god of Thunder, God of Fire, God of War, god of reproduction, God of protection, God of Light, God of Darkness, God of forest, and so on.

It was the same as the gods in the legends. However, they were not those people in the legends. Instead, they were cultivated.

“Oh, is that so?”

Wang Xian picked up the red wine beside him with a smile and took a sip. “It does have medicinal effects.”

“Haha, Dragon King, we didn’t brew this wine for its medicinal effects. It seems that you don’t know how to taste wine, Dragon King!”

The angel smiled and shook her head gently. She drank the red wine slowly.

It was a standard red wine etiquette. However, Wang Xian was not interested in it.

Compared to wine, he preferred to drink tea.

“I heard that you have a lot of spiritual herbs in the Garden of Eden. I’m sure you have heard of our Dragon Gate Forge. I wonder if you have any intention of cooperating!”

Wang Xian went straight to the point.

The actions of the Celestials from the celestial domain were filled with the etiquette of the European continent. They were like gentlemen. Wang Xian was not used to this feeling.

“Dragon King, what do you think of our divine wine?”

The angel did not answer him directly. Instead, he pointed at the red wine beside him and asked.

“One bottle is equivalent to a grade-6 Elixir!”

Wang Xian replied directly.

“That’s right. This is brewed using the brewing method of grade-6 spiritual herbs!”

The angel said with a smile.

“This requires 500 years of precipitation to reach such a stage!”

Wang Xian picked it up and shook it gently.
