“Dragon Gate, in three days, I, Bian Jiang Tu, will lead the experts of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect to destroy you and await your death!”

A voice filled with boundless anger came from the burly elder’s mouth and instantly spread throughout the entire jianghu.

It was the voice of an immortal God, and it was the voice of a superior immortal.

According to the division of strength between Immortal Gods, a middle-level immortal was able to fight against four lower-level immortals.

And a higher-level immortal could fight against four middle-level immortals.

If a lower-level immortal wanted to fight against a higher-level immortal, they would need at least fifteen to twenty.

In the entire jianghu, only the Xuanyuan clan, the Yuwen clan, and the Beast clan were known to have a higher-level immortal. It was unknown whether the other immortal sects had a higher-level immortal.

And today, when the hearts of the people of the Holy Medicine and Holy Medicine Immortal sect wavered, their supreme elder had no choice but to come out.

Moreover, today was not only a declaration, but also a declaration.

He would flatten the territory and lead the Holy Medicine and Holy Medicine Immortal sect to destroy the Dragon Gate!

“The Supreme Elder is actually still alive. Moreover, our two immortal sects have a total of twelve immortal gods, a total of twelve!”

“Haha, Superior Immortal, Our Supreme Elder has the strength of a superior immortal. According to the Supreme Elder’s words, the Supreme Elder is going to lead the experts of the immortal sect to destroy the Dragon Gate!”

“The Dragon Gate is going to be finished, they are going to be finished. Haha, this is great, this is simply great!”

“Kill the experts of our two immortal sects and besiege our immortal gods. Three days later, our grand supreme will exterminate you!”

“This is too satisfying, too domineering. This is our grand supreme elder. Who cares about the agreement between the immortal gods? Kill them!”

In an instant, the two disciples of the immortal sect below revealed excited expressions. Their eyes lit up as they shouted loudly.

After being sullen for more than half a month, the news of the immortal God being killed had finally been released today.

If the supreme elder of the immortal sect made a move, the Dragon Gate would definitely be destroyed!

A dignified voice spread throughout the entire jianghu.

While all the martial artists in the Jianghu were discussing the Dragon Gate in shock, discussing the unlucky Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect, the voice of an immortal God reached everyone’s ears.

It was extremely clear. This voice was definitely not something that an ordinary immortal God could transmit.

In an instant, everyone was stunned. A look of astonishment appeared on their faces. Soon after, they opened their mouths slightly, and their faces were filled with shock.

“What is the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect trying to do? Are they going to start a war and disregard the agreement between the Immortals and gods? Are the immortals and gods directly participating in the battle?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“This voice is definitely not coming from a mid-level immortal. A high-level immortal! The Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect has a high-level immortal!”

“Bian Jiang Tu? Bian Jiang Tu seems to be the former supreme elder of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect. Didn’t they say that the immortal had passed away more than ten years ago? He didn’t die!”

“This time, the Dragon Gate has really broken the sky. The Dragon Gate experts can kill the Immortal God, and the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect doesn’t care about the agreement between the immortal God and the Immortal God. They are going to fight to the death!”

“The Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect has made it clear that if they don’t care about the agreement between the immortal God and the immortal God, how will the other immortal sects react? What about the Yuwen clan of the Xuanyuan Clan?”

The entire jianghu was in an uproar again.

Just as all the disciples of the immortal sects thought that the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect would be beaten up by the Dragon Gate from now on, the two immortal sects suddenly turned the tables.

The superior immortal directly declared that he would destroy the Dragon Gate.

The words of a superior immortal were not a joke. Moreover, at this time, they clearly disregarded the agreement between the Immortals and gods.

“According to the news from the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect, the two immortal sects currently have a total of twelve immortals, one superior immortal, three Middle Immortals, and eight inferior immortals. Heavens, this is simply too terrifying!”

“Now that the two immortal sects have been forced to violate the immortal god agreement, if the Xuan Yuan clan doesn’t intervene and stop them, the Dragon Gate will probably be destroyed!”

“That’s right. At this time, unless the Xuan Yuan clan and the Yuwen clan use the immortal god agreement to suppress this matter, the Dragon Gate’s strength will definitely be destroyed!”

The strength displayed by the two immortal sects once again shocked everyone.

If they really started fighting, the Dragon Gate would probably be destroyed.

At this moment, Bian Jiang Tu’s announcement not only shocked the disciples of the immortal sects, but even the immortal gods had solemn expressions on their faces.

At the first moment, the grand elder of the Xuan Yuan clan and the grand elder of the Yuwen clan led a group of immortal gods to gather together.

More than a dozen immortal gods from the two immortal sects arrived and sat on both sides, frowning.

“As expected, the Holy Doctor Holy Medicine Immortal sect has a superior immortal. Now, Bian Jiang Tu has announced that he will mobilize the immortal God power to destroy the Dragon Gate. Once they make a move, the immortal god agreement will become a piece of scrap paper!”

The Immortal God Agreement was an agreement between the Xuan Yuan clan and the Yuwen clan.

Now that someone was violating it, they had to take the lead. Otherwise, the other immortal gods wouldn’t find trouble for themselves.

A middle-aged immortal god from the Xuan Yuan clan said in a deep voice.

“It’s the Dragon Gate that has forced the Holy Doctor Holy Medicine Immortal sect into a corner. If they don’t take action, their two immortal sects will be completely defeated by the Dragon Gate in the future. They will naturally be unwilling to be defeated by an immortal sect weaker than them!”

A middle-aged immortal god from the Yuwen clan raised his eyebrows and said.

“The two immortal sects have a superior immortal, and they’re already cornered. It’s not easy to solve this!”

Another immortal god from the Yuwen clan echoed.

The Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect had a superior immortal, and their strength was on the surface. They were no longer afraid of xuanyuan and Yuwen. Now, one immortal God from the immortal sect had been killed.

If they didn’t respond, the two immortal sects would be completely finished in the future.

It was reasonable for a superior immortal to personally declare that they wanted to destroy the Dragon Gate.

“Is the immortal God agreement going to be scrapped just like that?”

An old man from the Xuanyuan clan frowned and said with an unpleasant expression.

“The Immortal God agreement is to protect ordinary people. Now, because of the immortal God agreement, if the Immortal God’s life is threatened...”

An old man from the Yuwen clan continued, but he didn’t finish his words.

But everyone knew what he meant.

“Let’s Make a trip to the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect first and see if there’s any leeway. If there’s no leeway, then so be it!”

The Yuwen clan’s supreme elder stood up and said to the Xuanyuan clan’s supreme elder in front of him.

“Alright!”

The Xuanyuan clan’s supreme elder slowly nodded.

If it could be resolved peacefully, then it would be resolved peacefully. If it couldn’t, then it would be very difficult for them to do so.

They couldn’t possibly punish the entire Holy Doctor Holy Medicine Immortal Sect, could they?

This was obviously impossible. The other party’s strength was very strong.

Moreover, the Yuwen clan’s people clearly didn’t want to interfere in this matter. The Xuan Yuan clan was also very hesitant.

After all, the Dragon Gate’s experts were able to ambush and kill immortal gods. This was too terrifying.

The Immortal Gods from the two great immortal sects immediately headed to the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect.

The matter of the Xuan Yuan clan and the Yuwen clan heading to the two great immortal sects was not concealed.

At that moment, everyone understood that whether or not this great battle would happen would depend on the conversations of the few great immortal sects!
