Chapter 1518: 1518’s mind was clear

Holy light shone, exorcism, light shield!

His calm voice resounded within the array. Soon after, the entire space was enveloped by light.

Above their heads, a halo that was like the sun shone on them.

Strips of light that were like talisman paper floated around them.

There were also light shields that revolved around everyone.

The powerful light energy stunned all of them.

“What? What a powerful light energy!”

Old Hu, who was closest to them, could not help but exclaim in shock.

Around them, the members of the judgement mercenary group had shocked expressions. They looked at the holy light shining above their heads and the light shields in front of them. They were extremely shocked.

The solid light shield floating around them felt that it could at least withstand the attack of a half-step void interpretation stage powerhouse.

“Such terrifying light power is probably not lower than...”

“Open the formation. Let the members of the judgement mercenary group kill the demonic beasts around us!”

The old woman gulped as she felt the power of light in front of her. Before she could finish her sentence, she was interrupted by Wang Xian.

“Yes, yes!”

At this moment, the old woman looked at Wang Xian with a hint of respect in her eyes. She quickly removed the formation.

“Kill! Kill these demons first!”

The leader of the judgement mercenary group looked at Wang Xian with a change in expression. When he saw the formation being removed, he ordered his members loudly.

“Leader, we... I’m afraid...”

“The light energy around you can protect you!”

The leader of the judgement mercenary group immediately shouted loudly.

“Roar! Roar! Kill them!”

Before the judgement mercenary group could make a move, a group of heavenly moat demons charged over.

“Kill!”

Everyone from the judgement mercenary group gritted their teeth and attacked the heavenly moat demons.

“The rest of you, assist them from the back!”

The old woman immediately shouted when she saw this.

A few women and girls immediately used the light support divine ability.

As a radiant priest, although his combat strength was weak, his support was very strong!

“Roar, Roar, eat them!”

When the formation was broken, 25 Heaven’s moat demons charged over. Each of them had at least the strength of a rank 9 transcendent.

They charged towards the members of the judgement mercenary group.

“I, I...”

The members of the judgement mercenary group, who were only at the level of a rank 6 or rank 7 transcendent, felt the dark energy charging towards them. They gulped in fear.

They looked at the light shields, holy light illumination, and exorcism surrounding their bodies. They gritted their teeth and charged towards the demons.

“Ah!”

A rank 7 transcendent met a half-step void interpretation demon with his sword. At the moment of collision, he closed his eyes in fear.

“Keke, go to hell!”

When the demon saw that this weak human dared to attack him, his eyes revealed a look of disdain.

His sharp claws slashed at the sword in his hand.

“Ah!”

However, when the heavenly moat demon’s claws landed on the longsword, the longsword that was illuminated by the holy light easily broke through his sharp claws.

A painful and unbelievable voice rang out.

“What?”

The transcendent level 7 middle-aged man opened his eyes. When he saw this scene, a look of shock appeared on his face.

“Go to hell!”

He immediately reacted, and the long sword in his hand that was covered in light slashed towards the heavenly moat demon.

The powerful power of light directly broke through the heavenly moat demon’s body.

“Ah!”

A blood-curdling scream sounded, and the heavenly moat demon died.

“Haha, I actually killed him, Haha!”

His face revealed an excited expression as he shouted loudly.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

At this moment, miserable screams came from the surroundings, causing him to be slightly stunned.

He hurriedly looked over and discovered that every member of his team was brandishing the sharp swords in their hands, easily killing one heavenly moat demon after another.

This was especially so for the group leader and the others, who had even killed two to three heavenly moat demons.

These were heavenly moat demons that were on the same level as the group leader!

Shocking!

Incomparable shocking!

Bathed in the power of light, they were actually able to easily kill demon beasts that were two or three levels higher than them.

Moreover, even if they were hit, the light shield in front of them could easily block the moat demons’attacks.

Wasn’t this light support too terrifying?

Was the support effect of a radiant priest so strong? Yes, but only an extremely powerful radiant priest could do it.

“Run, there’s a powerful radiant priest among them, run immediately!”

At this moment, a moat demon let out a terrified cry. Its entire body turned into a black shadow as it fled into the depths of the forest.

The remaining few moat demons didn’t hesitate at all as they fled into the distance in fear.

Darkness restrained light, and light similarly restrained darkness.

A powerful radiant priest could easily restrain them.

“This, this...”

At the back, the old woman and the rest looked on in shock.

Old Hu’s hands trembled as he looked at Wang Xian and gulped.

“Haha, they died just like that. Twenty natural moat demons were killed by US just like that. We’re rich, we’re Rich!”

“Too strong, we’re simply too strong. The heavenly moat demons actually escaped!”

Li Si and the other members of the judgement mercenary group shouted with excitement on their faces. They looked at the corpses on the ground with burning eyes.

The corpses of the heavenly moat demons were very valuable.

The leader of the judgement mercenary group looked at the corpses one by one, but he was shocked in his heart. He knew that they were able to kill the heavenly moat demons so easily because of that young man.

His strength?

Looking at the power of light that was dissipating slowly, a look of respect appeared in his eyes.

“Come over here and thank that powerhouse!”

The leader of the judgement mercenary group shouted softly. He looked at Wang Xian and walked over slowly.

The people from the judgement mercenary group were slightly stunned. Following that, they looked at Wang Xian in awe.

They immediately walked over.

“Li Si, you just...”

“Wasn’t I very powerful just now?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

A girl ran over. She wanted to ask why he left her there and escaped alone.

However, Li Si raised his head slightly and said to the girl. His eyes were filled with the joy of surviving a calamity and the excitement of killing a powerful demonic beast.

This made the girl unhappy.

“All of you are very powerful, but I hate all of you!”

Wang Xian looked at the people from the judgement mercenary group. When he heard Li Siwei’s voice to the girl, a faint mocking expression appeared on his face as he said coldly.

“Huh?”

His words caused the faces of the people from the judgement mercenary group to stiffen slightly. Slowly, they became embarrassed.

Old Hu and the rest also looked at Wang Xian in astonishment and at this mysterious young man.

“Young master, our judicial mercenary group was in the wrong just now. We were in the wrong. Please give us a chance!”

The leader of the judicial mercenary group hurriedly took two steps forward and said in a low voice.

“Give You a chance? Am I not thinking clearly?”
