Chapter 90: Starting School

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

The time to report to the university had arrived, and the students turned up at the school one after another.

Today was the first official day to report for the freshmen. Nonetheless, the year two and year three students were also rushing back to school.

Just like the freshmen, the year two and year three students also had three days to report to school. However, there were some students who were responsible to receive the freshmen and had to arrive before their reporting dates.

By around 10 in the morning, the entrance of the school had gradually seen students gathering.

Moreover, there were cars parked everywhere in the vicinity of the entrance of the school. Scenes of parents bringing their children and walking into the university were common.

Several young faces were carrying their luggage while looking around constantly at the campus where they would be spending the next few years of their lives.

A pink Bentley drove over and stopped beside the school, drawing the attention of a substantial number of students.

“Let’s find a place to park the car first. The school forbids us to drive the car into the school today.”

Wang Xian looked at the surrounding cars and spoke to Xiao Yu who was driving.

For the first three days of school, many parents would drive their children to school. In order to prevent congestion, the school forbid cars from entering the school.

“Alright, brother!”

Xiao Yu nodded her head, found a spot and parked the car.

“Let’s go. I’ll carry the things and lead you all to the reporting area. After which, we will head to the dormitory to unpack your luggage!” Wang Xian said to Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi as he dragged along their luggage.

Other than some clothes and their laptops, they didn’t have many other things in their luggage.

Blankets were all issued by the school.

After locking the car, Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi followed behind Wang Xian eagerly as they looked at the school in front of them with anticipation.

Xiao Yu had changed into the new clothes she’d bought the previous day.

It was a beautiful long dress from Prada that revealed her fair arms. On her wrist was a watch from Patek Philippe which cost over $880,000.

She didn’t put on any makeup and had a natural, confident and beautiful smile.

If Xiao Yu was a swan the previous day, she was a beautiful phoenix today!

An action or a single smile was enough to attract other’s attention.

“It seems like our University of Rivertown will have another beautiful girl!” Wang Xian looked at Xiao Yu and joked.

“Hehe. Brother, I have always been an adorable and beautiful girl!” chuckled Xiao Yu.

“Let’s go and report. After which, we are going to the dormitory to put down your things!” Wang Xian said as he led them to the reporting area.

Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi had the same specialization and therefore Wang Xian brought them to the same reporting area directly.

There were teachers and students sitting at the reporting area. Seeing Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi walking over, one of them spoke to Xiao Yu.

“Junior, take out your enrollment notice and show it to us. I’ll get some students to bring you to your dormitory and inform you of the location of your classes.”

“Alright.” Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi took out the notice letter while the student at the side checked for the information of their allocated dormitory room.

“Wang Yu, room 303. Zhang Xiao Mi, room 305. I’ll get some students to bring you there.”

“Let me go, let me go...”

When one of the boys saw Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi, his eyes lit up as he volunteered enthusiastically.

“It’s alright. I’m Wang Yu’s brother and I’m also from this school. I know the location. I’ll bring them over.”

Wang Xian stood behind and smiled upon seeing the enthusiastic senior.

In university, seniors were like wolves and juniors were little lambs. Many seniors would wait for the arrival of the juniors, ready to pounce when the opportunity arose.

Wang Xian dispelled the ideas of that senior immediately.

“Uhm, this...” That guy looked at Wang Xian and was speechless.

“Let’s go, I’ll bring you guys over.”

Wang Xian smiled and led Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi towards the dormitory.

“So beautiful. That junior is really beautiful.”

Behind them, the enthusiastic guy looked at the back view of Xiao Yu and remarked sadly.

“Hehe, Liuwen, I think you should just give up on that idea!” the girl sitting in front of the table said to the guy with contempt.

“Wangmei, what do you mean by that? Why did you ask me to give up on the idea? I’m known to be attractive!”

“Hehe, you should take a closer look at that girl. The Prada dress is at least $30,000- $40,000. Her shoes are at least $4000-$5000. More importantly, if I didn’t make a mistake, the watch on her wrist was the latest female model from Patek Philippe and costs more than $800,000. How would such a fair, rich and beautiful girl be fond of you,” the girl replied with contempt.

“This...” That guy was dumbfounded and swallowed his saliva. “She’s so rich!”

Xiao Yu didn’t pick up the comments from the girl behind her. She was full of smiles while observing the surroundings of the school.

Wang Xian stood by her side and was explaining to the girls about the school.

“This is the female dormitory. Let’s go to the third floor!”

The first few days of school were the only days when a guy could enter the female dormitory legally. Wang Xian brought them to the third floor.

“This is 303. Xiao Mi, 305 is right there!” Wang Xian pointed to another room and said to Xiao Mi.

“We aren’t in the same room.” Xiao Yu commented grumpily.

“It’s fine. We are still staying really close to each other.” Xiao Mi smiled before continuing, “I’ll go unpack my luggage. You should hurry too.”

Xiao Yu nodded her head and entered her own room.

Each school dormitory room was for four people. The beds were at the top while the study desks were below the beds.

When they got in, they noticed that the other 3 girls had arrived.

“Oh, the last lady is here too. Everyone is here now! All four of them!”

When they just stepped in, a rough manly voice chuckled.

“Hi, uncle!” Xiao Yu looked over and smiled radiantly at the ordinarily-dressed middle-aged man.

“Hi, uncle!” Wang Xian also greeted and looked to the middle-aged man. The middle-aged man had an honest smile on him and was probably from the rural areas.

However, people like this were also the easiest to get along with. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Hello.” The girl beside the middle-aged man greeted Xiao Yu and Wang Xian shyly.

The girl looked young and was very shy. Her eyes were bright and had an exquisite look. Her dressing was a little old-fashioned, a classic example of a village girl. Nonetheless, she looked natural.

“Hello, I’m Wang Yu. This is my brother, Wang Xian. My brother is also from our school and is in year two.” Xiao Yu smiled..

“I’m Yuan Yuanyuan.” Yuan Yuanyuan smiled nervously.

“Come, let’s chat after unpacking,” the middle-aged man smiled and said as he extended his hand over to help.

“It’s alright, uncle. We don’t have a lot of things to unpack. We can handle it ourselves,” Wang Xian smiled and replied.

“Alright, there’s still some space here.” The middle-aged man laughed.

Wang Xian nodded his head. There was a blanket on the bed that wasn’t spread open. Wang Xian crawled up the ladder to prepare the bed.

As for Xiao Yu, she remained at the bottom to sort out her clothes and computer.

They didn’t have a lot to unpack and therefore finished quickly.

When they were done, the other 3 girls had also finished tidying up with the help of their parents.

“Come, try some sweet candies from our hometown. We made them ourselves and they taste really good.”

The middle-aged man took out a bag of snacks from his bag. After opening it, he passed it to the people around him. “Come, have a try. It’s delicious.”
