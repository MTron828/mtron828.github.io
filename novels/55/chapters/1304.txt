Chapter 1305: No. 1306 killed him forcefully

“Manager Qian, please calm down. Please calm down. If there’s anything that we need to settle in the future, please give our heavenly sword sect some face!”

The old man from the Heavenly Sword sect had a slight change of expression when he saw this scene. He quickly walked up to manager Qian, cupped his fists, and said respectfully.

“This...”

When the surrounding people saw that Wang Xian and the people beside him actually dared to confront manager Qian, their expressions changed drastically.

They hurriedly took a few steps back.

They were really afraid of a direct fight.

“Manager Qian, please calm down. Let’s have a good talk!”

Long Xiaotian, who was standing behind Wang Xian, took a few steps forward with a bitter look on his face. He bowed and lowered his posture.

“Eh? What’s going on?”

At this moment, at the entrance of the back mountain, he yuan, who was a little late, looked at the gathered people with a curious expression on his face.

“I don’t know. There should be some kind of activity, right? Young master he, let’s Go and take a look!”

A few experts from the Yan clan said with smiles on their faces.

“En, let’s go and take a look. I heard that Ling Jian ‘er from the heavenly sword sect is quite beautiful. She is a heroine among women. Let’s go and get to know her!”

He Yuan nodded his head indifferently and walked forward.

“Haha, it’s Not That I don’t want to give you guys face. It’s that someone doesn’t want to give me face!”

Before he yuan walked in, a voice was heard, causing him to be slightly stunned.

In the middle of the room, manager Qian didn’t even glance at the old man from the Heavenly Sword sect or Long Xiaotian. He stared coldly at Wang Xian and the rest.

“Let me tell you guys. Now, I will definitely kill this kid. Anyone who dares to help him will be considered an enemy of the third trading company in the world. When the time comes, Don’t blame me for being ruthless!”

As he spoke, his gaze swept across Ling Jian ‘er, Ren Xingchen, and Zhang Fengying. Finally, his gaze landed on Wang Xian.

“I just want you to apologize. You Don’t know what’s good for you and dare to call me a nobody. Interesting, interesting. I hope you can still be arrogant in a while!”

Manager Qian narrowed his eyes slightly. His face was still full of smiles as he said faintly.

“Make your move. Anyone who dares to stop me, kill them all!”

Finally, he gave a loud shout and gave an order.

“How overbearing, how domineering!”

“It’s him who’s courting death. He’s trying to act cool in front of shopkeeper Qian. Damn it!”

“This fellow is going to be finished. I hope that Beauty Ling Jian ‘er and that beauty Zhang Fengying won’t be irrational!”

“Shopkeeper Qian isn’t someone that blood flow empire can compare to. To actually dare to scold him, he’s simply courting death!”

The expressions of the surrounding people changed slightly when they saw this scene. The people who were surrounding them retreated once again.

“Don’t make a move!”

Wang Xian swept a glance at Zhang Fengying, Ling Jian ‘er, Ren Xingchen, and the rest. His gaze was cold.

Did he really think that he was easy to bully?

Did he really think that his background was invincible and that others wouldn’t dare to make a move?

A terrifying aura emanated from his body as he slowly took a few steps forward.

“Miss!”

The old man from the Heavenly Sword sect was also afraid that Ling Jian ‘ER would make a move, so he instantly moved to her side.

“You Reckless B * stard, go...”

“B * stard, how dare you attack brother Wang Xian? I think you are the one who is courting death. Go!”

Under the command of manager Qian, the two second-level insightful void martial artists shouted coldly and charged at Wang Xian with their weapons in hand.

However, before they could say anything, a furious look came from behind them.

Boom! Boom! Boom

After they finished their words, three figures dashed out.

Two middle-aged men and an old man were the three strongest people of the Yan clan, the second-level insightful void martial artists.

They dashed over without any hesitation and attacked the two men with their weapons.

The powerful energy hacked forward directly.

“What?”

The expressions of the two second-level Seethrough void martial artists who had already rushed out changed drastically. When they saw the energy that was attacking them, their bodies trembled and they immediately deployed their defenses.

“This... is the clan leader and elders of the Yan clan. The Yan clan has gone crazy. They actually dared to attack manager Qian’s men!”

“This is crazy. What is the relationship between the Yan clan and Wang Xian? They actually attacked him directly!”

When the surrounding people saw the Yan clan’s powerhouse who had suddenly charged out, their expressions changed drastically.

Could it be that the Yan clan had gone crazy? They actually dared to attack manager Qian’s subordinate?

“Huh?”

Wang Xian, who was about to attack, was slightly stunned. He looked behind him. When he saw he yuan, who had a cold expression, his eyes flickered and revealed a hint of a smile.

At this moment, the surrounding people also realized the voice from earlier.

Some of them noticed the young man behind them and quickly turned their heads to look.

Arrogant and noble!

The first time they saw the young man, these two words appeared in everyone’s mind.

He was dressed in a purple gown and had his head slightly raised, making him look extremely arrogant.

He strolled over and swept a cold glance at manager Qian. Then, he looked at the two second-stage profound void martial stage powerhouses who were surrounded by the three powerhouses of the Yan clan.

“Who is he?”

“Is he from the Yan Clan? I don’t think so!”

“What is his identity? What is his relationship with Wang Xian?”

Everyone looked at this fair-skinned, handsome, and noble young man with astonishment.

At this moment, manager Qian was staring fixedly at he yuan. Gradually, a look of fear appeared in his eyes.

“Brother Wang Xian, is this dog trying to kill you?”

He Yuan walked towards Wang Xian and came to his side. He turned around and asked manager Qian directly.

“How about the people from the third trading company in the world? Can you handle them?”

Wang Xian looked at him and asked with a smile on his face.

“Are they from the Qian Family? If they are the core disciples of the few factions behind him, I might have to be wary of them. If they dare to provoke brother Wang Xian, then kill them!”

He Yuan said to Wang Xian indifferently.

“Alright, I’ll make my move then!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Wang Xian didn’t hesitate at all. After confirming that he yuan could handle it, he didn’t hesitate at all.

With a move of his palm, the lightning strike wood appeared in his hand. Under everyone’s shocked gazes, he placed the lightning strike wood on the ground.

Terrifying Thorns emerged from under manager Qian’s body in an instant.

“What, you...”

Manager Qian’s expression changed drastically when he saw Wang Xian’s sudden attack. He hurriedly wanted to flee into the distance.

“HMPH!”

He Yuan looked at manager Qian who was dodging with disdain.

In the next moment, the terrifying thorns covered his entire body.

Waves of golden light lit up from his body. The defense of his armor was activated.

“Extremely hot water sea!”

Without any hesitation, Wang Xian unleashed his dual-attribute combined attack.

“Don’t... Don’t kill me... No, no... young master he... No!”

Feeling another attack from Wang Xian, manager Qian’s face was filled with shock. He stared at he yuan and shouted loudly.

Boom

Just as he finished his sentence, the sound of an explosion was heard. Under the tearing of the thorns, his body sank into the ground.

Stunned, everyone was stunned!
