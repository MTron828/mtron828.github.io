Chapter 869: 0870 suppressed the entire world

Translator: 549690339

“This, this...”

Everyone looked at this scene in shock. The Dragon Palace had completely suppressed the twelve sacred kings and twelve ancient gods in just a short moment of battle.

They sat proudly on their divine thrones and came here accompanied by a group of western gods.

They even clamored for the dragon king to be their mounts!

However, at this moment, the twelve people were completely suppressed.

Whether it was the middle-aged man who was fighting with the Dragon King, or the youth and middle-aged man who were fighting with the terrifying beast of the Dragon Palace, they were completely suppressed.

The group of immortal gods and disciples knelt on the ground, watching the battle that broke out in an instant, their faces changing violently.

They knelt here, waiting for their king to arrive.

In the end, their king had arrived. Now, he was fighting with the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace and was clearly at a disadvantage.

Just a moment ago, they had thought that the Dragon King would become a mount and be very miserable. Now... The F * ck, the one who was miserable was themselves.

“PFFT!”

“How, how can he be so strong? How is this possible?”

The young man who was sent flying by the terrifying force when he collided with the Kun widened his eyes and revealed an incredulous expression.

The middle-aged man beside him also felt his blood boiling and his face turned red.

The young man was at transcendent-level Rank-2 while the middle-aged man was at transcendent-level rank-3. Yet, he was sent flying by a huge monster.

How terrifying was this power.

The middle-aged man’s attack landed on the monster’s body and left a ten-meter-deep wound.

However, this one-meter-deep and ten-meter-long wound appeared without any blood. At this moment, the wound was slowly healing.

The young man’s attack was even weaker, leaving only a five to six-meter-long and half-meter-deep mark. At this moment, the mark had basically healed, and it was exactly the same as before.

Terrifying recovery ability, terrifying strength.

“What kind of monster is this?”

The two of them could not help but swallow a mouthful of saliva, their expressions extremely ugly.

They had entered this world and easily defeated the so-called gods of this world, establishing the Holy Glory Empire, preparing to live like an emperor in the future.

However, they did not expect to encounter such a terrifying group of people.

“Eat my stick!”

At the side, a 10-meter-long demonic monkey held a 10-meter-long rod in its hand, emitting a monstrous demonic flame as it surrounded a type 2 transcendent companion.

There were also a few beautiful girls.

The terrifying flames seemed to be endless, as they continued to be released.

One after another, a level 2 transcendent companion could only passively defend. Otherwise, they would be drowned in the Sea of flames.

There was also the terrifying light. The female student was like a goddess of light, emitting endless light. The light covered a radius of a few kilometers, and anyone who entered would be suppressed by the light.

These two perverse female students, their strength seemed to be at most at level 1, but their attacks were too perverse.

This was the first time they saw a person being able to continuously unleash all sorts of attacks.

Other than the girl of Fire and light, the gray woman was even more abnormal.

They had no idea what attribute the strange gray energy was. Once their bodies were touched by the gray energy, their bodies would stiffen, as if they were corpses.

The rank 3 transcendent team leader, who was fighting against the gray energy, faced the unknown energy with a serious expression.

Each of these ten people were extraordinary.

Not to mention, there was also an assassin who had assassinated one of their comrades from the start.

This was the most terrifying assassin they had ever seen. With just a flash of light, one of their rank 3 transcendent comrades was instantly killed.

Everyone was on guard against the white shadow that flashed past.

“Water crisis exploding city!”

At this moment, a cold shout rang out once again. It was terrifying again.

Wang Xian’s body spiraled as he swung his golden sharp claws at the middle-aged man.

Every time he swung his claws, there was a terrifying golden glow.

However, the middle-aged man was at transcendent-level Rank-4 after all. Every attack of his was extremely terrifying.

The blade in his hand was also extraordinary as it clashed violently with the dragon claws.

Every time they collided, sparks and golden light spread around. The entire sky was filled with flames and golden rays.

The stalemate lasted for a full two minutes. Wang Xian did not gain the upper hand at all. His entire body trembled as he activated his fourth supernatural ability.

Water Hazard explosion city.

Water Hazard explosion city was a water attribute supernatural ability. This water hazard explosion city was boiling water that emitted a terrifyingly high temperature.

The moment Wang Xian released the water hazard explosion city, the seawater below seethed and a million tons of seawater rose directly into the sky.

The Burning Burning River boiling sea instantly turned the entire seawater extremely red.

The temperature of the water became even more terrifying under the water hazard explosion city.

Between the divine abilities, they could be stacked and amplified.

The water hazard explosion city’s offensive power could be amplified by the water hazard explosion city’s divine ability.

The sea water that was emitting flames moved Wang Xian’s tail and flung it directly at the middle-aged man.

“The fourth divine ability? Water attribute?”

The middle-aged man’s expression was extremely ugly. Divine abilities were originally considered as a trump card. Now, the opponent had released four of them not long after the battle started.

Furthermore, each attribute was different.

Divine abilities could not be released casually. If one wanted to release a second divine ability, one had to at least recuperate.

For the same divine ability, it would take at least half an hour before it could be released again.

“This divine ability is much stronger than the previous three!”

Because of the burning river boiling sea divine ability, this divine ability made the middle-aged man’s expression slightly awkward.

“Roar, you forced me!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The middle-aged man roared, “Heavenly Blade!”

Heavenly Blade!

“Clang!”

With a roar, it was as if the sky had made a huge response. A blade directly fell from the sky.

Sky Blade was only 20 meters in size, but it was emitting an extremely bright light.

Sky Blade was above the middle-aged man’s head, and a golden light connected with Sky Blade.

The middle-aged man waved his arm, and sky blade directly slashed towards the water crisis exploding city in front of him.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

The middle-aged man stood where he was and controlled the sky blade to attack one after another. The Sky Blade followed the movements of his hands and unleashed terrifying attacks.

Cold Sweat appeared on the middle-aged man’s forehead. It was obvious that controlling the sky blade was very taxing on him.

This was a divine ability that he had comprehended after advancing to the fourth level of transcendence. Its power was incomparably powerful.

Divine abilities were also divided into strong and weak ones. The Sky Blade belonged to the highest level.

With a single slash, the water crisis city was directly split into two.

With the second slash, the water flow was once again split apart.

When the strength of the sword was strong enough, a single slash could cut through a waterfall.

“What a powerful saber art!”

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly. With a loud roar, his Dragon Claw charged straight at the Heaven’s saber.

The Dragon Claw that was emitting a bright light expanded to more than ten meters in size and collided heavily with the Heaven’s saber!
