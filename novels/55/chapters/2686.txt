2687 2687 Dragon Palace vs Tianya

They had such a good relationship with the Dragon Palace last month, so they naturally didn’t want to see the Dragon Palace and the Tianya sect clash.

This would make it difficult for them to back down last month.

After all, the Dragon Palace had helped them before.

However, the Tianya sect was so powerful that the Dragon Palace couldn’t compete with them.

Even if they had helped last month, they were still no match for the Tianya sect.

“Shut up, five of our sect’s elders have been killed, this enmity is irreconcilable. Of all the powers, only the Dragon Palace has the power to kill them!”

Sky Horizon Elder heard the sect leader’s words and scolded coldly.

This caused the sect leader’s expression to change, revealing an ugly expression.

At the same time, he was shocked.

The five elders had been killed, this was an existence on the same level as him, they only had four undying level 9 emperors last month.

“What? The five world margin elders were killed?”

“Hiss, these are five undying king level 9 beings, they were killed, how is this possible!”

“It was the Dragon Palace who killed them? Are they courting death? They actually killed the elders of the world margin great sect?”

The nine clouds great sect’s heaven severing great sect, along with the other powers that were rushing over, when they heard the words of the world margin elder, their faces were filled with shock.

The death of five elders of the sect was a huge matter!

“The Dragon Palace isn’t the only one that can destroy five undying god King Level 9 existences, and they might have entered the abyss.”

A forefather from last month said with an ugly expression.

“Last month, you have no right to speak here. Do you believe that if you say one more word, I’ll destroy your entire sect!”

Another patriarch of the World Margin Great sect roared with a cold face.

His words made the hearts of the people from the last month’s great sect tremble slightly.

“Dragon King, speak. Give me a reason that is not for you to make a move. Otherwise, our world margin great sect will definitely exterminate all of you. Not a single one of you will be spared.”

Sect master world margin stared at Wang Xian and roared with murderous intent.

Right now, the Dragon Palace was the most suspicious. Even if they did not have sufficient evidence, if the Dragon Palace did not have evidence that they did not make a move, their world margin would exterminate them as well.

They would rather kill the wrong person than let it go!

This was the might of the world’s end!

Around them, the experts and disciples from the four major sects on the Demon Island looked at Wang Xian. They were shocked by the might of the world’s end and were waiting for his answer.

“World’s end sect, why did your elders come to our Dragon Palace for no reason?”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and said faintly.

“So, the elders of Horizon sect were killed by Your Dragon Palace?”

Just as Wang Xian finished his sentence, a mysterious divine axe appeared in the hands of one of the patriarchs of Horizon sect. The energy in his body roared.

“Haha, when we were hunting the abyssal seeds, Your Horizon sect dared to barge into our place to hunt the abyssal seeds and even killed the disciples of our Dragon Palace. Tell me, do you think I will let off the trash of Your Horizon Sect?”

Wang Xian saw the murderous look on their faces. He laughed out loud and said coldly.

Boom

As soon as he said that, an incomparably violent murderous aura surged up in the surroundings.

“It’s really the Dragon Palace. They actually dared to kill the elders of our world margin sect, a small dragon palace. They are courting death!”

“Kill them. They dare to kill our elders. Destroy the Dragon Palace.”

“Kill our elders and take revenge. Make them pay ten times or a hundred times the price.”

“How dare the Small Dragon Palace kill our elder Tian Ya!”

When the experts and disciples surrounding the Dragon Palace heard Wang Xian’s words, their faces were filled with rage. They raised their weapons and roared with murderous intent.

“Hiss, this... The Dragon Palace actually killed the elder of the world margin sect.”

“Are they courting death? Even if they are strong, the Dragon Palace is not qualified to be enemies with the Heaven’s end sect.”

“Elder Heaven’s end killed a disciple of the Dragon Palace and the Dragon Palace destroyed him. This is too ferocious.”

The surrounding major sects and forces were also in shock.

They were more familiar with the strength of the Dragon Palace. To offend the Heaven’s end sect so ferociously was no different from courting death?

When the sect master and the rest heard this, their expressions changed. They gulped and looked at Wang Xian in a daze.

“Good, very good. Dragon King, since you dare to kill an elder of our heaven’s end sect, very good. This day next year will be the day of your death!”

A violent killing intent surged from the body of Patriarch Heaven’s end. All the experts and disciples of the Heaven’s end sect around him emitted a fierce aura.

“That’s great. If you, the Heaven’s end sect, dare to kill the people of our Dragon Palace, I will dare to kill them!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly.

He said that the elders of the Heaven’s end sect killed the people of the Dragon Palace because they had a good reason for doing so.

“This dragon king is so arrogant, so arrogant!”

“He doesn’t put the Heaven’s end sect in his eyes at all.”

All the experts were shocked when they heard Wang Xian’s words.

...

The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace had never put the world’s end sect in his eyes.

“Kill all the disciples of the world’s end sect. I want to destroy everyone in the Dragon Palace. Not a single one of them is left alive!”

“Anyone who dares to help the Dragon Palace is our sworn enemy. We will not rest until one of them dies!”

Standing on the world’s end ruler, sect master Tian Ya commanded loudly.

“Kill!”

Tens of millions of disciples raised their weapons in the surroundings. Their killing intent shook the world.

“I want to destroy your Dragon Peak.”

Sect Master Tianya murmured. He moved his arm, and a wave of energy poured into the Tianya ruler.

Behind him, two elders came to his left and right, and also poured energy into the Tianya ruler.

Buzz

The entire Tianya ruler slightly trembled, and it emitted a sharp metal light. A vast nomological power spread out in all directions.

...

“The battle is about to erupt!”

“The Dragon Palace is courting death. They actually started a battle at this time. This is the time of the Abyss invasion.”

“An internal battle at this time. This... The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace and the others are simply too stupid.”

The expressions of some of the surrounding experts changed slightly when they saw this scene. Some of them retreated.

An internal battle during the Abyss invasion was something that everyone was unwilling to see.

Even the two patriarchs of Jiuxiao frowned, but they could not say anything. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The Dragon Palace had killed the five elders of Tianya. They were irreconcilable enemies. It was impossible for Tianya not to make a move.

Behind them, the great sect from last month looked extremely embarrassed. They glanced at the experts of the great sect from Tianya who were full of killing intent. They gritted their teeth and hesitated.

“Kill!”

At this moment, an ice-cold roar reverberated throughout the world.

“World End ruler, one foot of the world end annihilates the gods and demons!”

The Voice of the sect leader of the world end continued to resonate. An energy condensed from the ruler-like laws erupted from the world end ruler.

The ruler instantly grew to the size of tens of thousands of kilometers and charged towards the center of Dragon Peak.

Around them, tens of millions of experts and disciples from the World End great sect also launched their attacks instantly.

“Hehe, Disciples of the Dragon Palace, Kill!”

When Wang Xian saw the group of people from the world margin sect attacking him, he licked his lips and commanded with a grim expression.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

As soon as the order was given, countless arrows flew out from the Dragon Peak and attacked the tens of millions of disciples from the world margin sect.

Crash

At the same time, in front of the Dragon Peak, three monsters formed from thorns were formed.

“Whoosh!”

One of the thorny monsters saw the Tianya ruler coming towards Dragon Peak and swept it away.
