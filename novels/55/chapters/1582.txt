Chapter 1583: One thousand five hundred and eighty-three corpses, two thousand miles of blood

“This is... darkness... darkness... this...”

The hunchbacked old man sensed the dark energy in Wang Xian’s body. His turbid eyes were wide open, filled with shock and disbelief.

He swallowed a mouthful of saliva and stared blankly at Wang Xian’s left hand.

The dense light energy was resisting the attacks of the two seventh-level Seethrough void martial artists.

On his right hand, rolling dark energy entered his body.

“Agree, live, disagree, die!”

Wang Xian looked at the hunchbacked old man who was trembling at the corner of his mouth. His eyes were completely pitch-black.

“Keke, I like killing people. I will kill whoever you want!”

The hunchbacked old man felt the energy in his body recover. His face revealed an excited and twisted maniacal laughter as he roared loudly.

“To be honest, pastor Wang, I like your personality. Keke!”

The hunchbacked old man laughed loudly and his figure instantly disappeared from Wang Xian’s body.

A black shadow attacked the two insightful void Tier 7 powerhouses of the Bingxin Empire at a terrifying speed.

The insightful void Tier 7 powerhouse, who was surprised that Wang Xian had blocked the two of them in an instant, suddenly felt a sharp pain in his body.

“Keke, priest Wang said that he wants to destroy your Bingxin Empire. Then, he will destroy you. There will be millions of corpses and blood will flow for thousands of miles. Keke!”

A horrifying voice suddenly resounded in the sky above the venue.

“Hiss!”

At the same time, the sound of tearing was heard.

Under everyone’s shocked gaze, the bodies of the two level 7 insightful void martial artists were directly torn apart by force. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Blood, flesh, and internal organs flew everywhere.

The blood fog slowly revealed the face of an extremely savage, Skinny Elder.

The dark energy around the elder surged and condensed, as if it was about to explode at any moment.

“The smell of blood!”

The elder excitedly licked the blood at the corner of his mouth and shouted in a low voice.

“What?”

“A rank 8 void interpretation expert!”

“That hunchbacked elder is actually a rank 8 void interpretation expert. He instantly killed two rank 7 void interpretation experts from the Bingxin Empire!”

“Heavens, what... What’s going on? That hunchbacked old man is here to seek treatment from priest Wang, and his condition is to annihilate the Bingxin dynasty?”

The surrounding people looked at the savage-looking old man with shock on their faces.

“Rank 8 void interpretation expert?”

When the Bingxin dynasty saw the two rank 7 experts instantly killed, their expressions instantly became extremely unsightly.

“Damn it, You Old Thing, you want to make an enemy out of our Bingxin Dynasty!”

Seeing the sudden change, the elder with long hair and Ice Fa Wu roared with an ugly expression.

“Keke, who asked you to offend priest Wang, and only he can expel the dark soul in my body!”

“I heard that you were also cured by priest Wang. TSK TSK, don’t you know that in my life, the people I want the most are those who are ungrateful?”

The stooped old man lifted his head slightly as if he was enjoying himself. Streams of demonic aura surged violently in his body.

This feeling made him feel extremely good!

“Priest Wang, it seems like we have really underestimated you. However, do you really think that you can destroy our bingxin empire just by relying on a person at level eight of the Void Interpretation Stage?”

“Today, even if there is a powerhouse at level eight of the Void interpretation stage helping you, you will still die!”

The long-haired elder stared at Wang Xian and growled in a low voice with an embarrassed expression.

A huge lotus staff appeared in his hand. Water was flowing on the lotus.

Bing FA Wu, who was at the side, had a solemn expression on his face. He was holding a long sword in his hand.

Around him, the supreme elder of the Solitaire sect looked at the hunchbacked elder and frowned slightly.

“Go to the sky and fight. Don’t destroy the Solitaire sect’s territory!”

He warned the Bingxin Empire and the hunchbacked old man arrogantly.

“TSK TSK!”

The hunchbacked old man smiled sinisterly and looked at the supreme elder of the sect.

“From now on, Don’t call me pastor Wang!”

Wang Xian glanced at the supreme elder of the sect and stared at everyone in the Bingxin Empire with his pitch-black pupils.

“Now, without pastor Wang, I prefer others to call me...”

As he spoke, he slowly opened his arms and wisps of black gas seeped out from his body.

“HMM?”

The change in Wang Xian’s body immediately attracted everyone’s attention.

Everyone was astonished when they saw wisps of black gas seeping out from a powerful pastor of light.

“God! Demon!”

A roar came out from Wang Xian’s mouth and the light aura on his body was swept away.

What replaced it was endless darkness.

The thick darkness directly shot up from Wang Xian’s body.

A violent, violent, and terrifying aura swarmed around Wang Xian.

“Today, I, Wang Xian, will not destroy the Iceheart Empire and the Sky Demon!”

A Wild Roar came out from his mouth. The voice spread across thousands of miles.

Everyone in the ruins of the divine kingdom could hear it clearly.

In an instant, the entire ruins of the divine kingdom was silent for two seconds. Everyone looked towards the direction of the lone sect.

Their eyes were wide open and filled with shock.

This roar was simply too terrifying!

Wasn’t Wang Xian the name of priest Wang?

Eternal Bingxin Empire, no Sky Demon.

This meant that eternal iceheart empire could not fully embody the name of Sky Demon.

Priest Wang? Sky Demon?

These two names were now like thunder in the ruins of the divine kingdom.

One was the saint of Light, and the other was the number one devil in the world, Sky Demon.

What was the relationship between the saint of Light and Sky Demon?

In the He clan, everyone in the He clan had a huge change in expression when they heard this howl. All the experts of the He clan looked at each other before flying towards the direction of the Howl.

In Wuji Empire, Wu Qing city and the other experts were slightly shocked when they heard the roar. They immediately flew towards the direction of Solitaire sect.

“Boom!”

“What’s going on? Oh My God, priest Wang... How can priest Wang Be a Sky Demon!”

“This... I can’t believe it. The Saint of Light is actually a sky demon. F * ck, tell me this isn’t real!”

“The pinnacle of a radiant priest, the number one devil in the vast region. How could they be the same person!”

All of these, the people around the hall of Supreme Self were all in shock.

They couldn’t believe it as they looked at Wang Xian, who had a demonic aura that shook the sky. Their eyes were wide open.

Who could believe that the saint of Light, the priest who saved the world with the hanging urn and had a benevolent heart, was actually able to wipe out a million people in the ancient demon city.

The moment he appeared, he wiped out twenty-five skyfiends who were at the seventh level of the Seethrough void tier.

This was simply too crazy.

Two extremely differentiated identities, one good and one evil!

It shocked the world!

“Cough cough, how... how is this possible?”

At this moment, when everyone in the Bingxin Empire saw Wang Xian’s violent roar and felt that terrifying aura, their pupils constricted slightly.

A hint of fear appeared on their faces.

They were not afraid of pastor Wang because no matter how strong a pastor was, he was not a match for the Bingxin Empire.

However, they were afraid of the Sky Demon.

A sky demon that made all the forces fear him.

However, the words “Eternal bingxin empire”and “Eternal Sky Demon”resounded throughout the world!
