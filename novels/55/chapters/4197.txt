Chapter 4198: 4197’s strength had greatly increased. It was a peeping tom!

The improvement of the ancestral tree was a big deal for Wang Xian.

Especially with the four mature mother-embryo fruits.

The value and importance of the mother-embryo fruits were too high!

Wang Xian gave one of the four fruits to the unicorn ox.

The Unicorn Ox was one of his own.

“Next, it’s time to wait for the improvement of the Void Dragon God! ” Wang Xian mumbled.

Once the Void Divine Dragon made a breakthrough, Wang Xian’s strength would reach a whole new level.

The space attribute was a powerful attribute to begin with.

A newly-advanced space-based heaven-origin creator was comparable to the two weakest heaven-origin creator powerhouses with other attributes.

They were at the same level and could fight against opponents of a slightly higher level.

Once the Void Divine Dragon’s body made a breakthrough, Wang Xian’s own strength and the Five Elements Tai Chi Dragon Disc’s strength would be comparable to an existence at the level of Great Dao.

Against an existence at the level of the Great Dao, such strength was considered to be the strongest existence in all the major universes.

“There’s still time!”

A smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face. He waited quietly and cultivated quietly.

The following years were peaceful!

Even the Heaven’s origin creation powerhouses from the nine-origin universe returned one by one. They began to use the last bit of time to nurture their disciples.

The various races were also improving at a terrifying speed.

Time passed quickly.

With the appearance of the tree of chaos, the strength of the nine-origin universe was much stronger than before. Especially the number of ruler-level experts.

They had improved greatly.

After all, the surroundings of the tree of chaos were comparable to the top-tier Grotto-heavens!

In the past, there was only one top-tier grotto-heaven blessed land of the various peak races, at most two.

These two grotto-heaven blessed lands could only allow some core elite disciples to cultivate for a maximum of a hundred million years.

Unlike now, the entire nine-origin universe’s elite disciples could cultivate here for more than two billion years.

These two billion years could make the nine-origin universe much stronger.

When the body of the Void Dragon had finished absorbing the corpses of the three heaven origin creation powerhouses, he had yet to make a breakthrough.

Wang Xian brought the body of the Void Dragon to the tree of chaos.

He absorbed energy here and began his cultivation.

The tree of chaos contained all kinds of energy. It was much faster for the body of the Void Dragon to cultivate here than in the sword and Magic Universe.

Time passed by little by little.

Hundreds of millions of years passed by quickly as well!

On this day, Wang Xian opened his eyes. A terrifying spatial energy surged out from his body.

Ripples appeared in the surrounding space.

The entire world was like a mirror.

“I can feel it. This shackle can be easily opened. Pm about to break through! ” A Ray of light shot out from Wang Xian’s eyes.

Wherever this ray of light passed, a thin and long spatial crack appeared!

Wang Xian could feel that his void dragon body had touched another realm!

Another realm was behind a mirror.

He could break this mirror easily.

However, he could feel that he was still some distance away from that mirror!ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

This mirror seemed to be in another void.

This was because of the quota.

It was impossible to make a breakthrough in the Chaos!

To enter the universe, this universe had to have this quota!

Wang Xian’s figure moved and he immediately returned to the Dragon Palace.

He followed closely behind him and flew into the sword and Magic Universe.

Buzz

When he arrived at the sword and Magic Universe, the Void Dragon body immediately flew over!

“Liu Lan, Brother Wangtian, I’m about to break through!”

When Wang Xian arrived at the sword and Magic Universe, he immediately sent a message to Liu Lan Wangtian!

Following that, the body of the Void Dragon flew to the sky.

“Roar! Roar!”

The body of the Void Dragon let out a roar and transformed into a divine dragon that looked like nothing.

As if there were no clouds in the sky, the body of the Void Dragon could not be seen.

The surroundings were pitch-black. Instead, one would be able to see a void dragon that looked like an illusion.

The gigantic divine dragon let out a roar that reverberated throughout the world.

Waves of spatial attributes surged into the body of the Void Dragon!

Wang Xian’s actual body was watching quietly from the side.

For this breakthrough, Wang Xian only informed Liu Lan and the hopeless sky.

He did not make a breakthrough at the center of the Sword and Magic Universe!

He was not prepared to cause too much of a stir.

After all, Wang Xian did not belong to the sword and Magic Universe.

Buzz Buzz

When the Void Dragon Body began to make a breakthrough, Liu Lan and Wang Xian rushed over through the teleportation formation at the side.

This place was at the edge of the sword and Magic Universe. However, as this place was connected to the nine-origin universe, Liu Lan and Wang Xian had set up a teleportation formation here.

It was also convenient for Wang Xian to teleport over quickly.

“Dragon King, is this avatar of yours about to make a breakthrough?”

Liu Lan, hopelessly sky, flew over and looked at the location of the Void Divine Dragon Avatar. He asked with a burning gaze!

Wang Xian smiled and nodded. He watched quietly.

“Congratulations, Dragon King! Congratulations, Dragon King! ”

Liu Lan, hopelessly sky, and the rest congratulated him immediately with faces full of envy!

Wang Xian nodded with a smile and quietly felt the process of his breakthrough.

He entered the universe of Swords and magic. Wang Xian could sense that the mirror was right in front of him.

He only used a little energy to break the mirror.

In the next moment, he was in a brand new realm.

The surrounding majestic energy surged towards him.

The power of space gathered in his body.

All sorts of deeper insights regarding the power of space surged into his mind.

“Ding! Congratulations to host for breaking through to the Heavenly Yuan blessed realm with the body of the Void Divine Dragon!” The system’s voice rang out, but Wang Xian ignored it.

All sorts of spatial attribute attacks appeared in his mind.

This made his eyes sparkle.

When one reached the Heavenly Yuan blessed realm, what they competed in was the control of space, the control of space.

They would also be competing in the control of the surrounding space!

With a casual wave of his hand, he would be able to unleash a powerful attack.

Buzz

Just as Wang Xian was quietly sensing, he suddenly felt as if he was being spied on!

Wang Xian felt something in his heart. From his senses, in the distant chaos, there was a huge pupil looking in his direction!

This made him frown slightly. With a thought, his main body immediately concealed his aura, completely concealing it.

The Tai Chi Dragon Disc and five elements great mill simultaneously concealed Wang Xian’s body.

His strength was not as strong as Wang Xian ‘s. With such a long distance between them, there was no difference between them!

At the side, Liu Lan and Wang Wangtian sensed this gaze. Their expressions changed and immediately turned gloomy.

He looked towards the location of the pupil. His gaze was filled with a sharp killing intent!

Wang Xian stood there quietly and didn’t look at the location of the pupil.

The body of the Void Divine Dragon in front of him was breaking through. His aura couldn’t be concealed at all!

A thought suddenly appeared in his mind!
