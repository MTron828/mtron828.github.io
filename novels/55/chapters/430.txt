Chapter 431: Outstanding Young Heroes Competition

Xiao Ran pulled his eyebrows together when he saw that old man. He could tell that this bald old man was not someone simple.

But he did not seem to have feigned kindness on his face, and the way he looked at him was a little queer.

Suddenly, he recalled someone.

“Haha, I heard that your master loves tea. This is the Dahongpao grown on the mother trees. One catty costs a few million. No average people can get this!”

The bald old man raised the gift in his hands and grinned at Xiao Ran.

“Come in!”

Xiao Ran looked deeply at him before he walked into the villa. “Master, there’s an old man here who admires you. I don’t know what his agenda is!”

“Oh? Let the old man in!”

Wang Xian nodded.

As his voice trailed off, a bald old man stalked in as he grinned. His eyes narrowed when he saw Wang Xian.

When Wang Xian looked at that bald old man, he squinted his eyes too as he sensed the daunting energy in his body. He then recalled someone who Sui Huang had mentioned before.

“Are you here to question our sins?” asked Wang Xian to the old man with a grin.

“No such thing. I’m here to express my gratitude to Miracle Doctor Wang. This is the Dahongpao grown from the mother trees. How is it? Does it please you?”

The old man walked over with a broad smile. Without any formality, he sat beside Wang Xian.

“Your business is none of my business.” Wang Xian fixed his eyes on the old man with a beam. He turned to Xiao Ran. “Open this and make me a cup of tea!”

The old man twitched his mouth. Since Wang Xian had seen through his intention, his tongue was tied.

If he were to ask Xiao Ran straightaway, he did not think he had a chance. So he wanted to befriend Miracle Doctor Wang, so that he could put in some good word for him.

“Old Xiao, do you want some?” Xiao Ran asked plainly as he looked at Xiao Quanshan when he poured a cup for Wang Xian.

“Okay.” Xiao Quanshan was smiling, but his face suddenly stiffened up. His eyes were fixed on Xiao Ran. “You recognized me?”

“I stayed in the Xiao Clan for about a year. I may not have seen you, but I have heard about you!”

Xiao Ran answered Xiao Quanshan without any emotion.

“You’re indeed one of us. What a smart boy!”

Xiao Quanshan looked at the nonchalant Xiao Ran and chuckled with embarrassment. He was a little awkward as a bad feeling arose.

This Xiao Ran was simply too calm and too mature. His EQ was far better than those members in the Xiao Family.

The more Xiao Ran behaved in this way, the lower the possibility that he had to bring him back to Xiao Clan.

Xiao Ran gave a faint smile. He placed the teacup before him and signaled for him to drink it.

Xiao Quanshan grinned. Being someone with a fiery temper, this was far trickier than he thought.

Wang Xian giggled by the side. He took out his phone to play, ignoring both of them.

He would not interfere in Xiao Ran’s matters. Even if Xiao Ran decided to return to Xiao Clan, Wang Xian had no opinion about it.

“Eh, Xiao Ran. After I found out about you yesterday, I was in grief and melancholy. I rushed back to the clan at night and taught that bunch of people a lesson. Xiao Ran, my poor child. It has been hard for you.” Xiao Quanshan gritted his teeth and spoke with a gentle voice.

“I can return to the Xiao Clan.”

Suddenly Xiao Ran spoke to Xiao Quanshan.

“What? You agree?”

Xiao Quanshan was stunned as he looked at Xiao Ran with disbelief. Things were going way too easy. This was totally unexpected for him!

“But, I have a few conditions!” Xiao Ran looked at him and added.

“What conditions? Tell me, and I’ll fulfill all of them!” Xiao Quanshan stared at him with excitement. He had a vibrant facial expression.

“First, I want to be the Clan Leader of Xiao Clan!”

“Sure, the former one has been kicked out by me!”

“Second, I want to have the right to mobilize Xiao Clan’s Enforcer Team!”

“No problem, the Clan Leader has the right!”

“Third, I must have absolute freedom!”

“Haha, this is not a problem!”

“That’s all.”

“That’s all? Only three? I, Laozu, have already prepared eight palanquins to take you back. Haha!” [1]

Xiao Quanshan was so thrilled that he almost jumped. Things were much easier than he thought.

Gosh, no doubt the Xiaos share the same genes as me. Cool.

“Master, I’m returning to the Xiao Clan. Now, I have some power on my own. Tell me if you need any help. I’ll definitely assist you in the future.” Xiao Ran grinned at Wang Xian as he spoke.

Xiao Quanshan’s laughter froze on his face as his lips could not stop twitching.

“Sure. It’s good that you’re going back to the Xiao Clan, and can become a Clan Leader of a Sacred Clan. I’ll wait for you to make a name in the Underworld!”

Wang Xian smiled as he stood up and gave a pat on Xiao Ran’s shoulder.

“Yes, master. I’ll achieve it!” said Xiao Ran firmly.

“Return with him. You can visit us when you’re free. Oh, and bringing some good tea will do. Look for me if you meet any difficulties!” said Wang Xian with a broad smile.

Bam!

Xiao Ran knelt on the floor with red eyes. “Once a teacher, always a teacher. Master!”

“It’s not life and death now. Enough, just go.” Wang Xian smiled and waved a dismissive hand.

“Miracle Doctor Wang is indeed a loyal friend. We’re friends now!”

Xiao Quanshan chuckled as he swung his arm. A folding fan and a Flame Bead were placed on the table.

“This is a small token. Thank you for saving the outstanding disciple of Xiao Clan!”

“You’re welcome!” Upon seeing the Flame Bead, Wang Xian put on a broad smile.

“Xiao Ran, let’s go. Return to the Xiao Clan with glory. I’ll announce to the Underworld the return of my super-genius disciple of Xiao Clan. Haha!” Xiao Quanshan chortled as he spoke to Xiao Ran with thrills.

Xiao Ran nodded and again bowed to Wang Xian before he left with Xiao Quanshan.

“Good tea!”

Wang Xian smiled. The Flame Bead caught his eyes, and he picked it up from the table.

[Purple Inferno: Level 10]

The Flame Bead was not red. Instead, it was giving off a Level 10 purple flame.

Wang Xian was satisfied with the corrosive flame.

“Hey, this fan is not ordinary!”

[Golden Ivory Fan: Level 10]

“Tsk, this Xiao Quanshan is interesting. I gave a Heavenly Flame and Inborn Spiritual Weapon to Xiao Ran. He returned me a Flame Bead and an Inborn Spiritual Weapon!”

Wang Xian chuckled as he flicked his palm. The Golden Ivory Fan unfolded, revealing a sharp metal radiance.

An impressive sharp weapon!

After Xiao Ran’s matter was settled, Wang Xian had his free time again.

Together with Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue, Wang Xian spent shameless time with them, enjoying himself, feeling refreshed every day.

Rapid progression in the establishment of the floating island was ongoing while the Dragonians continued to roam around in the Underworld for Spiritual Grasses and Spiritual Stones.

Yet, the Underworld broke out more shocking news during those five days.

[Incredible talent found in Sacred Clan of Shang Jing. Fifteen-year-old Inborn Expert became the youngest Clan Leader of Xiao Clan.]

[Demon-like talents frequently making an appearance. Five thirty-year-old Inborn Experts suppressed three first-class forces and obtained Level 5 Spiritual Grass.]

[Another appearance of the demon-like talents. Seven Inborn Experts who were below thirty killed a sea monster at Sky Mountain. They completed the fourth mission of the Underworld and gained a thousand Spiritual Stones.]

[The son of Hai Jiao, Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island had shown up in the Underworld, aiming for the Outstanding Young Heroes Competition.]

With the sprouting of young talents in the Underworld, everyone was looking to make a name on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart!
