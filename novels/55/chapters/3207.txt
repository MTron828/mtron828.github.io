Chapter 3208: 3207 acquired treasure

The succubus dragon could fight three levels above it.

And the Succubus Dragon’s attack methods were very strange.

Different from normal attacks, the Succubus Dragon’s attack was a sound wave attack, a type of spiritual attack.

Secondly, when fighting with the Succubus Dragon, don’t look at it. Once you look at it, you will suffer an even more terrifying attack.

It could be said that every move of the charm dragon could carry out strange attacks on you.

“It’s really powerful and strange. The ancestral witches in the universe are all incredible existences.”

Tian Chen, who was watching from the side, was full of admiration as he watched the charm dragon hide its attack methods.

He was only a small array master back then, and his ultimate target was also the ancestral witch.

However, when he saw the charm dragon, a dragon that had inherited some of the abilities of the ancestral wizard, his heart was filled with envy.

However, his path of witchcraft and the charm dragon were two different paths.

He focused on formations.

His path was even further than the charm dragon.

However, if he wanted to go further, he would have to pay a lot more than the charm dragon.

“Very good, very good. Even if there are only a thousand charm dragons, when all of them have reached the level of the ancestral wizard, it would be terrifying to imagine them standing together.”

Wang Xian’s face was full of smiles.

Once the charm dragons reached their peak, they would definitely be extremely terrifying.

As for the Dolphins, they could also evolve into the charm dragons. Although there were a few of them, they were more powerful than before.

Especially during this period of time, the black spider lilies grew again. When they grew to more than 1,000.

The Charm Dragon and the spider Lily would have an even more terrifying attack.

“Dragon King, Can I. . . Can I evolve into such a charm dragon? Can I?”

At the side, the female snake was swaying her body as she asked with excitement and anticipation.

“If you are willing to join the Dragon Palace, you can evolve into a Charm Dragon!”

Wang Xian looked at her and nodded.

If not for her inspiration, Wang Xian might not have thought of such a method.

Furthermore, the female snake’s bloodline was not bad to begin with. Naturally, she would be welcomed to join the Dragon Palace.

“Sure! Sure!”

The goddess did not hesitate and nodded her head immediately.

“Once you enter the Dragon Transformation Pool, you can undergo the transformation directly.”

Wang Xian said to her.

The female snake did not hesitate and jumped into the pool directly.

“Dragon King, I will choose a group of dolphins to enter the Dragon Transformation Pool.”

The leader of the Dolphins spoke from the side.

Wang Xian nodded immediately. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Roar!”

At this moment, a low roar came from the depths of the dragon transformation pool.

The current dragon transformation pool was filled with dragon blood.

With dragon blood that was hundreds of kilometers deep, it was impossible to see the deepest part of the pool.

However, at this moment, rays of golden light were emitted from the deepest part of the pool.

Wang Xian immediately looked over and narrowed his eyes slightly.

With a thought, he waved his arm and threw two golden dragon pearls directly toward the center.

The Golden Dragon Pearls entered the pool and immediately fell toward the lower part of the pool.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Deep in the dragon transformation pool, the roars of the divine dragon could be heard.

“There are more than ten dragon bones, two Golden Dragon Balls, and the Dragon Soul of the Tianhai Dragon King. Hopefully, a golden dragon will be born and this golden dragon will be more powerful.”

He mumbled.

The improvement of the Golden Dragon continued.

Wang Xian waited for a while before returning.

Time passed day by day. The other members of the Dragon Palace also began to improve.

The Heaven Formation also entered the dragon transformation pool.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

On the fifth day, an awe-inspiring roar came from the dragon transformation pool.

A golden light flashed across the entire Dragon Palace.

Wang Xian, who was in the Dragon King’s bedroom, sensed the situation in the dragon transformation pool. His eyes were filled with excitement.

His body moved and he immediately appeared in front of the dragon transformation pool.

In the sky above the dragon transformation pool, a golden dragon that was about 40,000 meters long was circling in the sky. A powerful pressure came from his dragon body.

“The power of a universe knight at level four.”

Wang Xian sensed his power and a glint flashed across his eyes.

“Roar!”

The Golden Dragon swayed. He looked at Wang Xian and flew straight over.

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

The Golden Dragon turned into a middle-aged man and half-knelt in front of Wang Xian.

“Very good. I’ll call you ao Jin from now on!”

Wang Xian looked at him and said with a smile.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Jin replied immediately.

“Do you have any memories?”

Wang Xian looked at him and asked.

Ao Jin was mainly born with the Dragon Soul of the Tianhai Dragon King. However, he did not know if he had any memories that belonged to him.

“Dragon King, I was separated from the body of the Tianhai Dragon King. I have inherited all the memories of the Tianhai Dragon King.”

Ao Jin immediately reported.

“That’s good.”

Wang Xian nodded and asked, “Do you have any control over the Dragon Palace of the Sky Sea Dragon King?”

“Yes. The Sky Sea Dragon King only has the other half of his dragon soul left. If he doesn’t have a body, I can easily take over the Dragon Palace.”

Ao Jin nodded.

“Oh? Then I can make a trip there after a period of time and occupy the Sky Sea Dragon Palace.”

Wang Xian said.

The Sky Sea Dragon Palace could be said to be a huge resource. Not to mention the treasures in the Dragon King Palace, just the Sky Sea Dragon Palace alone could be upgraded to a level six or seven universe knight if it was devoured by Ao crab and the others.

“What was the realm of the Sky Sea Dragon King when he was at his peak?”

Wang Xian asked.

“His combat strength was at level nine universe knight, and his realm was at level six universe Knight!”

Ao Jin immediately said.

“Universe Knight Level Nine Combat Strength?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. Such strength was not weak.

Of course, for the Divine Dragon Clan at their peak, it could only be said to be passable.

The powerful divine dragons of the peak clan were all terrifying existences at the level of universe masters.

They occupied more than half of the ocean of the heaven opening primal continent.

“Dragon King, I think it’s best for us to make a trip to the Sky Sea Dragon Palace as soon as possible. There’s an acquired Supreme Treasure in the Sky Sea Dragon Palace. It’s very powerful.”

Ao Jin suddenly suggested.

“Acquired Supreme Treasure?”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned when he heard his words.

Powerful treasures in the universe were divided into acquired Supreme Treasures, acquired Supreme Treasures, and then innate treasures.

Acquired Supreme Treasures were definitely the most powerful treasures among the universe knights.

With an acquired Supreme Treasure, it was easy to kill existences of the same level.

“We’ll head over immediately.”

Wang Xian did not hesitate and immediately instructed Ao Jin.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Jin nodded.

“Willow deity, follow me to the Sky Sea Dragon Palace.”

Just in case, Wang Xian called the willow deity.

“Oh? Dragon King, to the skysea Dragon Palace? I saw it on my brain. Someone said that the skysea Dragon Palace has disappeared.”

The willow deity flew over and said to Wang Xian in astonishment.

“Disappeared?”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned when he heard her words. He looked at Ao Jin who was beside him.

“Disappeared? There’s only one possibility. He has possessed a physical body. Otherwise, the Dragon Palace wouldn’t have been able to move or disappear.”

Ao Jin frowned slightly.
