Chapter 557: My Name Will Start To Spread (6)

“Next!”

Ten seconds later, four disciples of Mt. Wuyin fell on the ground while Wang Xian’s voice was heard once again.

“Big brother, Mt. Jiuhua is the next one in the ranking. Follow me, big brother!”

The two lips of Hua Yu knocked together as he was elated when he spoke. Hua Yu was already used to pulling the Spiritual Stone, and now it was the one on the training cliff of Mt. Wuyin.

“Let’s go!”

“Let’s go!”

Hua Yu hopped on his sword while Wang Xian followed behind. Both of them hovered in the direction of Mt. Jiuhua.

“Damn, he’s fu*king impressive to defeat four mountain sects alone!”

“And he’s not stopping. Does he want to do it in one shot? Given his strength, they could at least improve another two to three rankings!”

“Too strong, he’s simply too strong!”

Woosh!

Without the slightest hesitation, the disciples from those defeated mountain sects were already on their heels.

“I did not expect Mt. Fengyu to have such an outstanding disciple!”

Mentor Du gazed at Wang Xian in awe. He hesitated slightly before he stood on his sword and flew in the direction of Mt. Jiuhua.

Like all others, he wanted to see how far this disciple could go.

“Next!”

Mt. Jiuhua, fourteen in the rankings, defeated!

“Next!”

Mt. Qing, thirteen in the rankings, defeated!

“Next!”

“Senior Brother, we have come to your Mt. Wuyu,” said the petite girl to the young man beside her. She looked at the young man, who was hovering to Mt. Wuyu in stupefaction.

“Heh heh!”

The young man chuckled, but his eyes were half-dazed.

Mt. Qing, who had four Half-Step to Dan Realm Experts, was easily defeated. Even though it did not take a second to fall, it did not take more than ten seconds, either.

Mt. Wuyu had five Half-Step to Dan Realm Experts, including him.

After seeing the sickening combat power of that young man, the corner of his lips twitched involuntarily.

Damn. Given his understanding of Mt. Wuyu disciples, there was no way that they could be a match for this Mt. Fengyu disciple.

“Where did this devil thing come from?”

The young man gritted his teeth as he asked this with an awful look.

“How dare an insignificant Mt. Fengyu challenge us, Mt. Wuyu! You guys are really seeking your own death. Let me deal with all of you alone!”

Just then, the young man heard a familiar and insolent voice.

The eyelid of the young man twitched violently as he propelled his sword hurriedly. He bellowed, “Damn you, Lu Hezheng. Stop your brazen attitude! Who do you think you are? We’re admitting our defeat!”

The young man who was pointing his sword at Wang Xian revealed a lost expression when he heard his Senior Big Brother bawling at him. He was stunned as he looked over his shoulder.

“Brother Ming, they’re from Mt. Fengyu. It’s the trashy Mt. Fengyu! I can single the entire mountain sect out!”

The young man answered his Senior Big Brother in stupefaction.

“The four outstanding fellows from Mt. Qing were walked over easily. You?”

The Senior Big Brother of Mt. Wuyu glowered at him.

“What? How is this possible?”

“I have been watching them all along. We’re no match for him. Just throw in the towel!” the Senior Big Brother said with a gloomy look.

He thought of the time when he had said Mt. Fengyu and Mt. Tianshui were two chickens pecking at each other in the beginning.

Now? An outright smack in the face.

If Mt. Fengyu was some chicken, then they were just worms.

“Admitting defeat is the right choice. Mt. Wuyu is clearly no match for this Senior Brother from Mt. Fengyu!”

“That’s right. Even though Mt. Wuyu has one Half-Step to Dan Realm expert more than Mt. Qing, it is futile. He’s too much for you to handle!”

“Let’s go. Next!”

The number of disciples commenting around had hit more than two hundred people.

Everyone was clamoring while various comments went into the ears of Mt. Wuyu disciples.

That young man of Mt. Wuyu twitched the corner of his lips while the rest of the disciples lowered their heads in silence.

“Next, Mt. Luan, ranked eleventh!”

“Mt. Luan has ten Half-Step to Dan Realm experts. If they send their best five, I wonder if they could go against this Senior Brother!”

“He looks so young, and I have never heard of him before. How can he be so powerful?”

“He’s simply too strong, and look at his aloof and dashing profile. I want to marry Senior Brother!”

As they continued their journey, the number of people on their heels had reached nearly three hundred. The more sects they surpassed, the more disciples tagged along.

It was already in the afternoon when Wang Xian was busy with his challenges.

Many of the disciples were following behind with excitement as they skipped their lunch.

After all, they were powerful Martial Artists who could go on empty stomachs for a few days without any issues.

At this time, Mt. Fengyu’s ranking had been rising at a frenzied rate. Word of a disciple slamming a bunch of mountain sects’ disciples traveled fast.

Scriptures Depository, Sword Cleansing Peak, Assessment Peak, Equipment Peak, Exlir Mountain were five mountains located just next to the main peak.

Before the main peak was one huge cliff that measured a thousand meters tall and ten meters wide.

There was a line on either side of the cliff.

One was the mountain sects’ leaderboard while the other one was the young disciples’ one.

Twenty mountain sects were ranked according to their strength.

That went the same for the individual disciples. The leaderboard would show the top twenty young disciples of the Da Hong Immortal Sect.

In Da Hong Immortal Sect, where most of the Martial Artists had a longer lifespan, young men referred to those aged 45 and below.

In other words, it was a leaderboard for disciples aged 45 and below.

The ranking could change at any time.

So long as the one who issued challenges defeated the opponents and pulled down the spiritual stone at their training field, the ranking would dip by one position.

At the same time, the mountain sect who won would increase by one position.

Yet, the leaderboard had undergone rapid and bizarre changes today. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

In the beginning, not many disciples paid attention to Mt. Fengyu when they advanced from nineteenth to eighteenth.

Those mountain sects at the bottom of the rankings were usually considered as non-existences. Nobody really cared about what was happening.

However, Mt. Fengyu gradually rose in their rankings.

When they hit the fifteenth, they attracted the attention of many people.

The fifteenth was a mark that represented a Half-Step to Dan Realm expert’s presence in the mountain sect.

Yet, everyone was surprised to see Mt. Fengyu hitting the twelfth position in less than an hour.

The sect that was ranked at the twelfth position had five Half-Step to Dan Realm experts. Overtaking them would mean that Mt. Fengyu possessed the strength of defeating five Half-Step to Dan Realm experts.

Just when the crowd was discussing the speedy rise of Mt. Fengyu to the twelfth position, their position was promoted again.

It was already 4 PM.

Wang Xian stood at the training field of Mt. Luan as he spun around slowly.

“Just as we expected. He won; an easy feat once again.”

“Fast and furious! Within a short span of a few hours, he raised the ranking of Mt. Fengyu to eleventh place!”

“Is he going to continue? Is he? The tenth in ranking possesses a Dan Realm disciple! ”

“Have you noticed? Did you all notice? He hasn’t been drawing his sword! Gosh!”

Everyone gasped and looked at Wang Xian in awe. He had battled through eight mountain sects by himself within a few hours.

He had promoted Mt. Fengyu’s ranking from nineteenth to eleventh place by force!

Just him alone!

“Next!”

Wang Xian turned a deaf ear to all the discussions around him. He would have wanted to challenge the top three ancestral sects if the rules allowed him to skip levels.

“Next!”

Hua Yu’s eyes were already full of admiration. He was thrilled when he said, “Next... No, Big Brother, it’s getting late now. When we reach the next mountain sect, the disciples will have stopped their training!”

“Is that so?”

Wang Xian looked at the sky and nodded. “Fine, let’s go back now!”

“Yes, we’ll head back!” Hua Yu hurriedly said.

Wang Xian made a move and rode off on his sword.
