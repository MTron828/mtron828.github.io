“Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!”

Within the entire room, terrifying arms began to wrap around the gods of the Garden of Eden. The arms were like snakes, easily wrapping around the eight gods of the Garden of Eden.

The eight gods seemed powerful, but to the eight gods, they were nothing.

A highgod, especially a powerful highgod like the eight gods, could easily destroy two gods and six demigods.

“Milord, you...”

The Skinny Old Man’s face changed dramatically, especially after what Lord Ba Qi had just said.

The Dragon King said that he wanted to kill all of you, so he would kill all of you!

This...

“You said that the Dragon King wants to kill you?”

Ba Qi didn’t move at all. A tongue came to the skinny old man’s side, wrapping around his body.

“Milord, no, no... great god Ba Qi!”

The thin and weak elder’s face was filled with terror, but he did not dare to resist.

“Trash!”

Ba Qi’s eyes were devoid of any emotion. Snakes were cold-blooded animals.

His tongue coiled up, and the mouth of one of the heads actually expanded to two to three meters in size, directly swallowing the elder’s body.

“Ahhhhhhh!”

A terrified scream rang out. The thin and weak elder was swallowed into his stomach without any resistance.

A cold and gloomy feeling spread throughout the entire house.

No matter what, the old man was a lower-level immortal. He was actually swallowed directly.

In an instant, the gods in the Garden of Eden revealed a horrified expression.

These nine-headed monsters actually swallowed even their own subordinates.

Was it just because of that sentence about the Dragon King wanting to kill you?

This... What the hell was this situation.

“Dragon King, I’ve eaten all of these useless things!”

Ba Qi licked his tongue and looked extremely terrifying. His nine heads turned towards Wang Xian and said respectfully.

“What... What...”

When the gods in the Garden of Eden heard Ba Qi’s words, they felt a chill down their spines again. They looked at Wang Xian in a daze.

What was the relationship between Ba Qi and the Dragon King? Why was it like this?

“Don’t waste it. Just kill them and bring them back to the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian felt that it was a waste when he saw Ba Qi devouring an immortal God directly. He told Ba Qi directly.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ba Qi nodded his head and looked at the other four elders who were lying on the ground. “Dragon King, how should we deal with these four people who offended you?”

“You can deal with your subordinates yourself!”

Wang Xian took a glance at the five subordinates of Ba Qi. There was a thick stench of blood on their bodies.

Although they were still a lot weaker than Ba Qi, they had definitely killed many people and committed many bad deeds.

Wang Xian did not have a good impression of such sinister and evil people. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Keke, I don’t need these useless people in the future!”

Ba Qi smiled and stuck out his tongue. His long tongue rolled up the four old men. “Come, come, enter my stomach and sacrifice your lives for your God!”

“Yes, yes!”

The four elders trembled, but they did not resist at all. They lay on the ground and were rolled up by the tongue and entered Ba Qi’s mouth.

“Hiss!”Everyone around felt their scalps go numb.

This was simply too abnormal and terrifying.

“No, no, Ba Qi Dragon King, if you dare to kill us, Our Garden of Eden will definitely not let you off!”

“Don’t Kill Us, don’t Kill Us!”

When the gods of the Garden of Eden saw eight points devouring their subordinates in a crazed manner, their bodies trembled and their faces were filled with fear as they spoke.

“Keke, Garden of Eden’s divine realm, am I, eight points, afraid of You?”

Eight points extended his tongue and flicked it gently. An illusion flashed and directly pierced through his body.

“No, no...”

Seeing that Ba Qi dared to kill him directly, OCRA’s Angel widened his eyes in fear.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

With a loud sound, Ba Qi’s tongue pierced through the remaining seven gods in an instant. There was no emotion in his eyes.

“Has everything been settled?”

Wang Xian asked Ba Qi.

“Dragon King, everything has been settled!”

Ba Qi lowered his nine heads and said respectfully to Wang Xian.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and looked at the people from the four great immortal sects. “I’ll leave this place to you guys. Oh right, let’s announce to the public that the Garden of Eden is cooperating with our Dragon Palace. Because they went back on their word, they demanded too much and were annihilated by our Dragon Palace!”

After he finished speaking, he looked at Xiao Yu. “Are we going back?”

“We’ll play for a few more days!”

Xiao Yu stuck out her tongue and said with a smile.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile. Following that, he flew out.

Ba Qi placed the corpses in his interspatial ring and followed behind him respectfully as he flew towards the floating island.

“Hiss, this... this is too terrifying!”

One of the disciples from the four great immortal sects widened his eyes as he looked at the fresh blood around him. He was tongue-tied.

“What a terrifying octahedron. If you want to subdue or destroy the nine snakes association, at least let one of the Xuan Yuan clan and the Yuwen clan take action. Otherwise... that terrifying existence has actually been taken in as a subordinate by the Dragon Palace!”

“The Dragon King’s strength is really unfathomable. He actually dared to directly destroy the gods of the Garden of Eden!”

“Haha, this is so satisfying. The Ancient Greek divine realm killed two immortal gods with just a sentence like the puppet immortal sect’s lion opening its mouth. Now, the Dragon King directly killed eight immortal gods and returned them to the western divine realm. Although they are not from the ancient Greek divine realm, their relationship with the Ancient Greek divine realm is better!”

“This is so satisfying. If the gods in the Garden of Eden didn’t say that their relationship with the ancient Greek divine realm is better, the Dragon King might not have killed them!”

The Immortals and disciples of the immortal sect said happily.

The reason why the puppet immortal sect was killed by the gods of the divine realm was obviously unreasonable.

This time, the Dragon King used the same reason to kill the people of the divine realm, which made them very happy.

Although the relationship between the immortal sects was not very good, they were at least on the same side. When they faced the western divine realm, they also shared a common enemy.

The Dragon King’s behavior undoubtedly boosted the momentum of the Eastern Immortal sect.

“This... Miss Yu, has this place been occupied by your brother?”

At this time, an elder of the Wild Beast Immortal sect asked Xiao Yu politely.

“No, the territory of the Dragon Palace is not on the surface. My brother will not occupy this place either. You guys can occupy this place!”

Xiao Yu smiled and shook her head. The territory of the Dragon Palace was in the ocean. This was something that Wang Xian had already decided on.

He would only occupy the ocean and ignore the matters on the land!

“Alright, Alright. Then, thank the Dragon King on our behalf!”

The elder from the Wild Beast Immortal sect nodded his head happily.

The surrounding immortals and gods also thanked Little Yu. Even Feng Lingtian’s father had many thoughts in his mind.

Now that the Dragon King’s power was becoming more and more terrifying, no one dared to provoke the Dragon King’s sister in the entire jianghu.

Even the Yuwen clan and Xuanyuan clan had to greet little Yu respectfully.

No one responded to the title of the Dragon Palace’s eldest princess.

It wasn’t an exaggeration to call her the princess of the entire jianghu.
