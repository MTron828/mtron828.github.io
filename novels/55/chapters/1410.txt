Chapter 1411: Year 1411, Breakthrough! Down

Boom

In the vast Dragon Palace, Wang Xian, who had transformed into a divine dragon, was lying on the huge dragon throne.

His entire aura shook, and the majesty of a king spread throughout the entire Dragon Palace.

His figure grew rapidly, from 50 meters to about 70 meters.

The scales on his body were even more resplendent, and the huge dragon horns were even more mystical.

“Ding! Congratulations on your breakthrough in your speed level. As you have comprehended the strongest aspect of the five elements, the great grinding of the five elements has further strengthened and strengthened your dragon claws!”

Crack

“I’ve finally made a breakthrough!”

In the Dragon King’s Hall, Wang Xian let out a sigh of relief. A faint smile appeared on his face.

He stared at his dragon claws.

Wang Xian did not obtain any special aspect for this breakthrough. Controlling the dragon kingdom was only a matter of how strong he was.

When he strengthened his physical body and unleashed his dragon kingdom, his dragon claws could turn into a radius of two to three kilometers. The claws contained terrifying five elements energy.

The effect was the same as the five elements millstone. However, the five elements millstone leaned towards long-range combat while controlling the dragon country was considered close combat!

Looking at his dragon claws, Wang Xian could feel that his dragon claws had undergone a powerful upgrade after this breakthrough.

Each of his nine claws contained terrifying power!

Since ancient times, nine claws were the pinnacle. Be it the nine claws or the nine transformations of the Divine Dragon, they represented the peak!

“The current me should be able to kill a level six Seethrough expert easily. As for a level seven Seethrough expert, I’m not his match!”

Wang Xian moved and swayed his body. His huge body was filled with strength.

His body moved and transformed into a human form.

“Congratulations to the Dragon King for his breakthrough in strength. The members of the Dragon Palace have absorbed the resources this time and obtained a huge increase in strength!”

“This time, the number of the members of our Dragon Palace who are experts in the void interpretation realm has also reached 1,500. The leaders have achieved another breakthrough in strength!”

Prime Minister Gui walked over and reported to Wang Xian with a smile on his face.

“To be able to receive such a huge improvement in just over a year, it’s really not bad!”

Wang Xian revealed a satisfied look on his face.

It had been a year since Wang Xian returned from Xiaoyao City.

During this one year, he had never left the palace.

He had been cultivating in the Dragon King Palace and dealing with some matters in the Dragon Palace.

Today, his strength had finally achieved a breakthrough!

Compared to the Dragon Palace, the Dragon and Phoenix Empire had developed the fastest in this one year.

A year ago, Feng Luan had swept through more than 20 dynasties.

Now, the dragon-phoenix Dynasty had become a colossus.

There were more than 200 cities under the dragon-phoenix dynasty.

There were more than 300 void interpretation experts in the dragon-phoenix dynasty.

The number of void interpretation experts was not weaker than the old dynasty, the Light Dragon Dynasty.

If the current dragon-phoenix Dynasty wanted to expand further, it would be difficult for it to expand unless it competed with the dynasties around the human-demon graveyard.

“Let’s Make a trip to the Dragon Palace of the dragon-phoenix dynasty. Shu Qing, Xiao Yu and the other girls really think that they are the elders of the dragon-phoenix dynasty. They stay in the dragon-phoenix dynasty every day!”

A smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face. His body moved and he flew out directly.

“Dragon King, are you going to the Dragon and Phoenix Royal City as well?”

As soon as he flew out of the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian saw Duan Jinming returning from the outside. He asked respectfully with a simple and honest face.

“Yes, I haven’t been out for a long time. I’ll make a trip there. How’s the situation with the forging of the Dragon and Phoenix Now?”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile and asked.

“Dragon King, everything is normal. We are earning more than 20 billion middle-grade spirit stones every day!”

Duan Jinming smiled and said.

“Yes, thank you for your hard work!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“No hard work, no hard work!”

Duan Jinming smiled and shook his head.

In the current Dragon Palace, the weakest group of people were the members of the Fire Hammer clan.

Even so, half of the members had already reached the half-step void interpretation stage. The rest were all at transcendent level nine!

There were more than twenty people who had reached the void interpretation realm.

After monopolizing the weapon industry of the dragon-phoenix dynasty, the fire hammer clan could bring 20 billion middle-grade spirit stones to the Dragon Palace every day.

They continued to fly toward the dragon-phoenix Imperial City. Compared to the previous cities, the dragon-phoenix Imperial City had expanded a lot in more than a year.

Now, it could be said to be the most prosperous and majestic city within a radius of hundreds of thousands of kilometers!

“It’s Lord Wang!”

“Hello, Lord Wang!”

“Greetings, Lord Wang!”

On the city wall, the city guards who were guarding the city saw Wang Xian’s figure and immediately greeted him respectfully.

Although Wang Xian had not been here for a year, his image was deeply etched in the hearts of everyone in the Dragon and Phoenix Royal City.

Everyone knew that the Dragon and Phoenix Empire was able to develop to this day because of this Lord Wang.

Wang Xian nodded his head lightly at them and flew directly towards the palace.

“Master Wang, are you going to look for the Queen? Please follow me!”

A palace guard walked over respectfully and led Wang Xian towards the imperial study room of the palace.

“Master Wang, the Queen is in the Imperial Study Room!”

The guard walked Wang Xian to the door and said respectfully.

“Alright, I’ll go in by myself!”

Wang Xian nodded and walked straight in.

“Your Majesty, this is the final ultimatum from our life and Death Elixir workshop and the forging formula for the holy relic. If you don’t allow us to enter the dragon and Phoenix Empire, don’t blame us for being impolite!”

“Our Life and Death Elixir workshop and the forging formula for the holy relic have stood for seven to eight thousand years in the transcendence continent. There isn’t a single empire that dares to shut us out. You have to consider it carefully!”

“Of course, I have already considered it carefully. I know what I want to do with the empire that I have conquered!”

“Since our dragon and Phoenix Empire has the ability to monopolize the elixirs and weapons, why should we hand it over to others?”

Wang Xian had just stepped into the imperial study when he heard a voice coming from inside.

“HMPH, since the dragon and Phoenix Queen is so stubborn, don’t blame us for being impolite. I hope your empire can survive for a little longer. Haha!”

A maniacal laughter came from inside. Following that, Wang Xian saw five middle-aged elders walking out from inside.

A few of them had angry looks on their faces as they walked out in a huff.

Wang Xian looked at them and raised his eyebrows slightly!
