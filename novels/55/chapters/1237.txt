Chapter 1238: 1,239 versus Heaven’s Pride

Translator: 5496903

Nameless Rat!

These four words were very loud.

The name that Wang Xian had set was nameless. His entire body was covered by a black robe and a mask, and his face couldn’t be seen clearly.

“Haha, a guy who doesn’t dare to reveal his name and face still dares to step onto the stage. What qualifications does he have to step onto the Heaven’s pride stage? !”

“That’s right. which person on the Heaven’s Pride Roll Isn’t honorable and has an invincible stance? A nameless rat who doesn’t dare to reveal his real name and face still dares to challenge our senior brother Huang Tian!”

“Get lost. You’re still a prodigy? You must be a rat crossing the street, Haha!”

Around them, the people from the Divine Wind Academy mocked Wang Xian when they saw him completely covering his figure.

Even the rest of the people looked at Wang Xian and shook their heads slightly. There was a hint of disdain in their eyes.

“Every prodigy who dares to step onto the stage, which one of them doesn’t have an invincible aura and is open and aboveboard? It’s the first time someone like this is cowardly.”

“His name is nameless and he doesn’t show his face. The description of this nameless scoundrel is really fitting. Haha, for such a person to want to enter the Heaven’s favorite ranking, he must be Dreaming!”

The rest of the people also spoke with slight disdain.

“Mind your words!”

When Wang Xian heard Huang Tian’s words, his eyes flashed as he warned him.

“Haha, Mind My Words? You are really a piece of trash!”

Huang Tian laughed coldly when he heard Wang Xian’s words. “If you want me to shut up, bring out your strength. You are such a nameless rat. You are really wasting my time!”

“Haha, senior is so domineering. A nameless rat. What a waste of time!”

“I wonder where this nameless rat came from. Hurry up and SCRAM BACK!”

“The Heaven’s pride stage is the stage for the strong ones. Everything is based on strength. You even asked people to pay attention to their words. What a joke!”

More than 10,000 young people who were watching from the side showed disdain in their eyes.

They were cowardly and didn’t have the bearing of a heaven’s pride.

Their words were a joke and didn’t have the aura of a strong person.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian stared at Huang Tian and revealed a cold smile.

He waved his arm and a two-meter-wide golden light directly attacked Huang Tian.

“Trash, you’re wasting my time. I’ll kill you with one move!”

When Huang Tian saw Wang Xian attacking, he moved and went up to meet him.

Clang

He pulled out the longsword in his hand and slashed at Jin Liu.

Bang

When Huang Tian’s longsword, which was emitting a dazzling golden glow, slashed at Jin Liu, his expression changed instantly.

“How could this be...”

He widened his eyes. The golden glow around the sword was instantly melted. The golden glow passed through his longsword and went straight to his neck.

His body that was rushing towards him stopped in an instant. His eyes were filled with disbelief.

“Let me tell you to shut up. Then shut up forever!”

Wang Xian looked at his stiff body. There was no change in his expression. His body moved and came to his side. He took the interspatial ring from his body.

Bang Bang Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The moment Wang Xian took away his interspatial ring and weapon, Huang Tian’s entire body fell downwards.

One of his heads was in the sky. It slowly detached from his body and rolled to the side.

At this moment, the faces of everyone who was still looking down on Wang Xian turned stiff.

Even the voice that was speaking stopped abruptly. Everyone widened their eyes and were filled with shock.

One move, just one move.

In less than a second, Huang Tian fell!

A Heaven’s pride expert that was strong enough to kill Chen Lin in ten moves was instantly killed just like that.

“Cough cough, this... how is this possible... how is this possible!”

Everyone was somewhat in disbelief. A moment ago, they were still mocking the nameless rat, but in the next moment, he instantly killed a powerful heaven’s pride expert.

Everyone could tell Huang Tian’s strength. He could at least increase his ranking by five to six places. This was at least.

However, just like that, a dark horse who was about to step onto the top step by step as a heaven’s favorite was killed in an instant.

Thinking about the mocking earlier, everyone’s facial expression changed drastically.

Too Strong. This was simply too strong.

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings coldly. His facial expression did not change at all. Killing a half-step void interpretation expert in an instant was simply too easy for him with his current strength.

His body moved and he flew out of the arena. He saw an open house at the side and flew straight in.

In the house, there was a porcelain bottle filled with spiritual liquid.

The spiritual energy in the entire room was twice that of the outside world. Furthermore, there was a refreshing fragrance.

Wang Xian did not stay any longer. He kept the spiritual liquid into his interspatial ring and flew straight to the higher arena.

When he arrived at the arena and issued the challenge, he realized that the 19th-ranked heaven’s favorite was not there.

“Wait!”

Wang Xian pressed the button on the challenge button. The Challenge had already been issued. Within two days, the opponent had to come and accept the challenge. Otherwise, it would be considered as admitting defeat and disqualification of the Heaven’s favorite.

Since he was not there, Wang Xian directly withdrew from the Heaven’s favorite arena!

When Wang Xian withdrew from the Heaven’s pride stage, everyone was expelled from the surroundings of the Heaven’s pride stage, which was ranked 20th among the heaven’s pride experts.

The moment they came out, they saw Wang Xian walking towards the Heaven’s Pride Pavilion.

The Heaven’s pride pavilion was a resting place. It was a resting place that was later established by the bloodshed empire.

“A nameless rat? Just now, he said that he was a nameless rat. Hehe, how ironic!”

“With such strength, why would he still hide his name and appearance? The Prodigy roll is the pinnacle in everyone’s hearts!”

“Haha, people from the Divine Wind Academy, aren’t you all mocking now? This is simply a slap in the face. It wasn’t easy for a powerful prodigy to appear, but in the end, he provoked others and was directly killed!”

Over ten thousand people came out from the arena. Some had dazed expressions, some had mocking expressions, and some had shocked expressions.

“Oh my God, Look, look at the last place on the prodigy roll, I... F * ck!”

At this moment, a young man suddenly pointed at the prodigy roll with a shocked expression and exclaimed.

“Oh?”

Everyone looked over with a shocked expression.

“How is this possible, how is this possible? 26 years old, just 26 years old, oh my God!”

A young man exclaimed in disbelief.

At this moment, The Prodigy roll had been updated in real time.

The last person was ranked 20th, nameless, 26 years old.

A number that made everyone tremble.

26, just 26 years old.

Wasn’t this F * cking too freakish?

“Crazy, crazy, where did this freakish person come from? 26, just 26 years old!”

“With his strength, he should be able to rank in the top ten or even higher. He’s already so powerful at twenty-six years old. He’ll definitely reach the top of the Prodigy roll before he turns fifty!”

“I guess he’s at least in the top five or even the top three. He didn’t draw his sword just now and killed him in one move!”

“This world is simply too crazy. is that young man hiding his identity a heaven-defying monster secretly nurtured by the Blood Flow Empire?”
