“It’s right here, a girl and a young man. They actually used a special method to catch the ground star fish!”

“There are their people blocking us at the bottom of the sea. Those people are all strong, much stronger than us!”

Just as Cheng Qingcheng was staring at Tang Yinxuan, sounds of discussion came from the surroundings. More than a dozen people from the south were flying over here.

There were also people from the east and north who were flying towards this direction.

Some of the Warriors were exuding a powerful aura as they stared at this direction with sharp gazes.

“Miss, tell us that our wind smoke immortal sect can stop the others. Otherwise, you guys will be in big trouble!”

Cheng Qingcheng smiled as she glanced at the group of people who were rushing towards this direction. She was still smiling as she looked at Tang Yinxuan.

“Haha, Cheng Qingcheng, Miss Tang Yinxuan is a member of our Thunder clan, so... don’t even think about it!”

The young man who was riding on the Thunder Beast revealed a bright smile as he said loudly to Cheng Qingcheng.

“Is that so?”

Cheng Qingcheng frowned slightly.

“It’s them...”

“It’s that beauty. The special sound she plays can attract the earth star fish!”

“If we get the method, as long as we get the method to attract the earth star fish, we’ll Be Rich!”

The dozens of people around stared at Tang Yinxuan, who was in the center, and said loudly.

“Eh? That’s the disciple of the Thunder clan and the Wind Smoke Immortal sect. Hiss, that’s the young clan leader of the Thunder clan and Cheng Qingcheng!”

“Cheng Qingcheng, she’s Cheng Qingcheng, so beautiful!”

“No wonder she’s the number one beauty on the Peerless Beauty chart. She’s like a princess of the immortal world!”

The group of people who came were slightly shocked when they saw the people from the Thunder clan and the Wind Smoke Immortal sect. Their eyes landed on the young clan leader of the Thunder clan and Cheng Qingcheng as they exclaimed in amazement.

“Haha, of course. Miss Tang’s father is a member of our Thunder clan, and she’s also someone I’ve taken a fancy to!”

The young man on the Thunder Beast laughed loudly as he spoke, his face filled with intense confidence.

“Young clan leader Lei, I’m not a member of Your Thunder clan. Be careful with your words!”

Tang Yinxuan’s expression was a little cold when she heard the young man’s words.

“Hehe, it seems that this beauty completely ignores young clan leader lei. What a heartless woman!”

When Cheng Qingcheng heard Tang Yinxuan’s words, she looked at the young man with a smile on her face.

“In my opinion, Miss Tang’s beauty is not inferior to the beauties on the ultimate beauty chart. The only ones who can match her are naturally us heaven’s favorites!”

When the young man heard Tang Yinxuan warning him in front of so many people, his expression turned slightly ugly. He looked at Wang Xian who was beside Tang Yinxuan and said, “This kid is not worthy of her and is not qualified to compete with me!”

When Wang Xian saw the young man looking at him and heard his words, he smiled faintly and looked at him with a smile on his face.

“This lady’s beauty is enough to be on the ultimate beauty chart. Furthermore, her strength is not weak. My two junior sisters were easily repelled. Furthermore, she possesses the skills to attract the earth star fish. It is true that an unknown person is not worthy of her and can not be compared to the young chief of the Lei family. However, although the young chief of the Lei family is outstanding, others may not like him!”

Cheng Qingcheng’s eyes contained a trace of mockery as she looked at the young man and said.

The surrounding martial artists who came forward didn’t dare to interfere when they saw them conversing. They silently stood to the side, not daring to make any moves.

Regardless of whether it was the Thunder clan’s young clan leader or the Wind Smoke Immortal Sect’s Cheng Qingcheng and the others, there was a huge gap between them.

Looking at the girl in front of them, everyone revealed a look of surprise.

She was indeed very beautiful, not inferior to the beauties on the unrivaled beauty chart at all. No wonder young clan leader Lei pursued her so much.

Perhaps only such an outstanding heaven’s chosen could be matched with such a beauty.

“WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH!”

“Someone’s coming again!”

At this moment, the sound of flying could be heard again from behind. Everyone turned their heads to look.

“This is? It’s that person from the innate immortal sect. Look, that’s flower fairy!”

“Flower Fairy, I didn’t expect flower fairy to come as well. The number one beauty, city-toppling beauty, and the number three beauty, flower fairy. We’re quite lucky today!”

“Eh? That’s the elite disciples of Eternal Glory Cauldron. They’re here too!”

“Core disciples. The ones who came this time aren’t elite disciples like us, but the core disciples of other immortal sects. They’re not afraid of the Thunder clan or the wind smoke immortal sect at all!”

“There are many people participating now. Let’s see if we can fish in troubled waters. Otherwise, it has nothing to do with us!”

The crowd looked at the seventy to eighty people who had rushed over with a surprised expression. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Oh?”

The young man on the Thunder Beast and Cheng Qingcheng also looked around. When he saw the crowd who had rushed over this time, a trace of solemnity appeared on his face.

Every core disciple of an immortal sect was an existence that could not be underestimated, especially those famous heaven chosen.

“Flower Fairy!”

“Wood Spirit River!”

“Wandering snow!”

“Hong Tianda!”

“Yin Fengwen!”

When the disciples of the Thunder clan and the Wind Smoke Immortal sect saw the powerful auras of the immortal sect’s disciples rushing over, they cried out one name after another.

“There are actually three core disciples of the immortal sect here. Each one of them is a heaven’s chosen, and there are also beauties on the Peerless Beauty Chart!”

Everyone in the surroundings looked on in surprise.

Cheng Qingcheng’s eyes flickered as she looked at flower fairy and wandering snow.

Flower Fairy was ranked third, and wandering snow was ranked fifth!

The Top Five Beauties on the Peerless Beauty chart of the pugilistic world all had the strength of the infant realm, and each of the five had their own merits.

It would be impossible for the first place to surpass the second and third place!

Facing two powerful opponents at once, Cheng Qingcheng put away her casual attitude.

The young man on the Thunder Beast also put away his arrogance and looked at the other three heaven’s favorites.

The three core disciples of the immortal sect flew toward them.

The group of Immortal sect disciples occupied a spot and looked at the young clan leader of the Thunder clan and city-toppling beauty of the Fengyan Immortal sect!

“Eh, it’s the Dragon King?”

Fairy flower looked at Wang Xian, who was standing next to an unfamiliar girl in the middle. A hint of surprise appeared on her face.

She looked at the girl and could not help but be slightly stunned. She felt a little jealous.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Beside flower fairy, Mu Lingchuan, the eldest senior brother of the natural born celestial sect, was also slightly stunned.

Flower fairy nodded and walked straight towards Wang Xian. She smiled and said, “Dragon King!”

The Voice of flower fairy rang out from the surroundings, causing everyone to be stunned. They quickly looked at Wang Xian who was beside Tang Yinxuan.

“It’s him. I didn’t expect it to be him!”

When Piao linxue and Hong Tianda saw Wang Xian, they were stunned as well. They looked at each other in shock.

Piao linxue looked at Wang Xian with a complicated expression. She felt that it was unbelievable.

The Pill Weapon Grandmaster with terrifying talent whom she met more than a year ago was actually from the real world.

Furthermore, he had single-handedly killed a group of infant stage powerhouses during the competition. He was a celestial being who stood proudly in front of Yongchang.
