Chapter 489: Four Desperate Men

When they thought of the headlines, that bunch of young men revealed faint smiles.

The brat who embarrassed them would be doomed for messing with them.

They stared at Wang Xian with disdain in their eyes.

With a similar smile, Wang Xian swept his gaze across those young men as he wondered if they could still smile later on.

“This is it...”

When the Dubai crowd escorted Adallen and Adjaya over, an old man pointed to Wang Xian and was ready to introduce him.

Before he could finish his sentence, Prince Adallen and Princess Adjaya stalked toward him.

I always heard that Prince Adallen hates injustice to the core. Will he strike?

I guess not. The prince knows his limits!

The old man had two thoughts to himself as he followed them closely.

As soon as the spectators spotted Prince and Princess, they immediately gave way and looked at Wang Xian.

This fellow is finished!

Everyone shared the same thought.

Mu Xiaowan grabbed Wang Xian by his arm with tension.

“This...”

Adallen came to Wang Xian, unsure of how to address him. Suddenly he thought of the things his sister told him. With a broad smile, he said, “Brother-in-law, what a coincidence!”

Wang Xian was stunned, and his face stiffened.

He was not expecting Adallen to call him Brother-in-law right when he saw him.

“Damm!”

“Who’s your brother-in-law?”

Wang Xian could not help but swear at Adallen as he turned to Adjaya with a frown.

DAMN!

Upon hearing the crude conversation between Prince Adallen and Wang Xian, everyone was stunned with confusing looks.

The capitalized word ‘damn’ seemed to have collapsed upon them as they felt lost and unreal. Were they hallucinating?

What’s the situation now?

“Interesting. Did you just molest someone?”

Adjaya looked at Wang Xian before turning to the girl beside him with a faint smile.

Accompanied by the crown on her head, she looked extremely noble.

Wearing a crown that symbolized royalty in public was an obvious indicator of the domineering status of Princess Adjaya in the royal family.

“Stop being sarcastic!”

Wang Xian was uncomfortable, seeing her taunting look. “You knew I was here?”

“Everything you do is under my surveillance,” Adjaya chuckled as she said frankly. “So, you can forget about running away!”

Wang Xian stared at her with a frown as he was not in the mood for answering her. He spun around and looked at the Dubai lady. Coldly, he said, “Did you see? This is the Princess of Dubai. She’s begging me to marry her, and I didn’t even agree to it. Look at yourself. With your looks, do you think I would molest you? Who do you think you are?”

Wang Xian stupefied that girl and all the surrounding people with his words.

What the fu*k is this going on?

In particular, the conversation Wang Xian had with Princess Adjaya, and the last thing he said, struck everyone with dizziness.

Their princess had pleaded for him to marry her, yet, he had refused.

All of them found it unbelievable. They immediately turned to Princess Adjaya only to realize that she was glowering at Wang Xian.

The way she looked... like a little woman?

Fu*k!

At this time, they recalled the first sentence that Prince Adallen had said to that young guy.

Brother-in-law?

A middle-aged man could not help but hold onto the leaves in the pot of a decoration plant.

The shock could not be subsided even by holding onto a pot of plants.

That Dubai girl did not know what to do as she looked at Wang Xian. She looked up and saw Princess Adjaya staring back at her.

Gao Yang, Qing Wen, Yang Ze, and Tang Lingling’s boyfriend parted their big mouths as they were appalled by what they saw.

“Why? Keeping quiet? Speak up now! With your looks, who do you think you are for me to molest you?”

Seeing the girl keeping mum, Wang Xian glared at her coldly. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“I... I...”

The girl got freaked out by what was happening to her. She panicked, not knowing what to do.

“I knew everything without you telling me.” Wang Xian let out cold laughter as he swept his gaze across Gao Yang, Qing Wen, and the rest of the young men. “All of you are setting me up here. What a pity. I wanted to slaughter you guys right away!”

“That, Prince Adallen... Someone is trying to frame me, and they are your citizens. How are you settling this?”

Sensing that Wang Xian was staring at him, Adallen gave a bitter smile. He knew Wang Xian’s ability, and his sister’s life was in the control of his hands.

They might be a family in the future.

With a darkened expression, Adallen looked to that girl. “Speak now. If I find out the truth myself, you’ll pay a heavier price!”

“Prince, not me. It was him. He made me do it!”

She pointed at a young Dubai man.

“No, Prince. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. They were the ones who asked me to find someone to frame that young man to disgrace him. I’m in the wrong, Prince. I confess!”

When the girl pointed to him, that young man quickly replied in trepidation.

A friend had asked him for a favor, so he agreed without any hesitation. However, he had never expected that the man he was dealing with was...

The one the Princess was marrying, the brother-in-law of the Prince.

He had landed himself in deep shit.

He confessed as he trembled, pointing to Gao Yang and Qing Wen.

The confession of the young Dubai guy washed away the glow on the faces of Qing Wen, Gao Yang, and the rest instantly.

Several middle-aged men and elders beside Mu Xiaowan’s mother were stunned.

The middle-aged man, who had accused Wang Xian of being a disgrace, paled.

Qing Wen was his son.

Gao Yang’s father was among the four people too.

“Bring down their families and companies in Dubai!” Wang Xian said directly as he looked at the four young men, and eventually stopped at Adallen.

Hearing his straightforward words, Adallen twitched his mouth but still nodded. “Sure, don’t worry, brother-in-law. I won’t let them off. They’ll be banned from Dubai in the future!”

Wang Xian and Prince Adallen’s words had sent chills to Qing Wen, Gao Yang, and Yang Ze.

Their fathers were breaking out in cold sweat on their foreheads.

“Prince Adallen, we...”

Qing Wen’s father was about to beg for his mercy when he looked at Prince Adallen with consternation.

Their family had already moved and settled down in this Empire!

“Shut up. Your son set someone up. As a parent, your sin is unforgivable!”

Before Prince Adallen could say anything, the old man beside him immediately bawled at him.

He knew very well of Princess Adjaya’s current status.

How dare someone set the future husband of Princess Adjaya up! Even if you were a family of royalty, you would have to count yourself unlucky, let alone some outsiders.

That middle-aged man paled, with cold perspiration rolling down.

“Wang Xian, can you give my boyfriend another chance?”

Sensing her boyfriend trembling, Tang Lingling pleaded with her eyes red.

Wang Xian lifted his chin to look at her. “Not only will they not be able to stay behind here, but they will also not survive back in their country! He’s not getting away!”
