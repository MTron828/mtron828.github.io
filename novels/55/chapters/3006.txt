Chapter 3007: , the trapped old man

“Dragon King, this chessboard is a treasure. It contains a powerful force!”

While Wang Xian was reading the book, Tian Chen picked up Tian Yan chessboard and sized it up. His face was filled with astonishment.

On the other hand, Ba Qi and an lie were curiously sizing up the old man who was sitting cross-legged.

They caressed the old man’s body.

“This book is to introduce the treasures of the Universe!”

Wang Xian handed this book to Tian Chen and took the heaven’s manifestation chessboard.

The Heaven’s manifestation chessboard was something that only wizards could use. It was a relatively powerful existence among acquired Numinous Treasures.

Furthermore, according to the records in the book, there was a crucial reason why the heaven’s manifestation chessboard was comparable to acquired Numinous Treasures.

The Heaven’s performance chessboard wasn’t a postnatal supreme treasure that an individual could use. Instead, it required at least nine people!

These nine people each released nine attribute arrays to attack. The nine attributes complemented each other to increase the attack power.

It wasn’t difficult for nine people to stand on the heaven’s performance chessboard and release nine attributes.

However, if it was just nine people, they could only use the heaven’s performance chessboard to increase the attack power by one point. It wasn’t even comparable to a low-grade numinous treasure.

If the number of people doubled, the heaven acting chessboard would increase by 1%

If the number of people increased by ten times, it would be 10% . If it was a hundred times, it would be 100% . If it was a thousand times, it would be the limit. It would increase by 1,000% .

A Thousand Times was also the limit of the entire heaven acting chessboard.

What kind of concept was this? For example, 9,999 void God Emperor rank seven battle-power heaven arrays standing on the heaven acting chessboard could make all of them have an attack power comparable to a rank eight god Emperor!

To directly cross a level, wasn’t it terrifying?

Of course, all the treasures of the Mo Han ghost technique were given to the clansmen and disciples. There was a reason why only this one treasure was left behind.

Firstly, the Magi on the sky chessboard had to have the same strength. Secondly, every attribute of the array had to be identical. Thirdly, the coordination had to be flawless.

Otherwise, even the slightest mistake could cause the power to be greatly reduced.

It was very harsh.

The entire Mohan clan could find 99 people to control the heaven acting chessboard, but 99 people could only increase it by 10% . It was not even comparable to the Wizard artifact in his hand!

“Keke Keke, this old fellow is able to enter here. His strength is extraordinary. He definitely has many treasures in his interspatial ring!”

At this moment, Ba Qi suddenly pulled out an interspatial ring from the old man’s arm and sized it up with shining eyes. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Sky Formation, come, come, break it!”

Ba Qi shouted at the sky formation.

“Although this old man is close to extinction, he isn’t dead yet. There is his imprint on it. With his strength, I can’t break it unless I kill him completely. This way, the restriction on the interspatial ring will automatically be removed.”

The sky array said to him.

“Oh? Then let’s send him to his death!”

Ba Qi opened his mouth and said, “Dragon King, his strength should be extraordinary. If he is treated as a resource?”

“How much energy do you think his body still has?”

Wang Xian said to Ba Qi speechlessly as he sized up the old man.

His dragon eyes flickered with black and white light as the power of the heart of yin and Yang was activated.

The heart of yin and Yang could determine a person’s level of good or bad!

In the universe, there wasn’t a powerhouse who wasn’t stained with blood. However, the heart of yin and Yang could still determine whether a person was good or evil.

If the heart of Yin and Yang was a treasure, then Wang Xian guessed that it was at least at the peak of the innate supreme treasure level.

“A person’s heart isn’t Evil!”

Through his senses, he could sense that there was still positive energy in the old man’s body.

He hesitated for a moment.

With a wave of his arm, a jade bottle of life force fluid appeared in his hand.

“Dragon King, you want to save him?”

Ba Qi asked curiously.

“A righteous person is also a grateful person. To be able to obtain the favor of a powerhouse is also beneficial to us!”

Wang Xian opened his mouth and said. A jade bottle of life force fluid landed directly in the old man’s body.

“That’s true. This old man’s body has no energy left!”

Ba Qi muttered.

The vitality fluid landed on the old man’s head and was absorbed by him rapidly.

His body was like a sponge as he absorbed it crazily.

Wang Xian watched quietly from the side.

The old man was not dead to begin with. Instead, he was starving. As long as he had energy, he could recover quickly.

“Dragon King, this heaven acting chessboard is very useful to US Dragon Wizards!”

Heaven’s formation, who was at the side, said to Wang Xian. After reading the book, his eyes revealed an excited look.

“My over 10,000 underlings of dragon wizards can use this chessboard. They can increase its power to the maximum!”

Heaven’s formation continued.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded. He could tell that this heaven acting chessboard was very suitable for Dragon Wizards.

Dragon Wizards were able to learn all kinds of sorcery and formations in a unified manner. They had almost insane coordination.

The heaven acting chessboard was perfect for them!

“Continue to check the surroundings. There should be many useful books here. Put them away!”

Wang Xian said to the heaven acting chessboard.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The few of them nodded their heads and immediately flew toward the secret compartments.

“Cough… cough…”

The old man in front of him let out a weak voice.

Wang Xian looked down and saw that his head, which was almost skin and bones, was gradually becoming plump.

Traces of flesh and blood were born, and his face turned round and red.

The Vitality Elixir was a powerful treasure at the level of a venerable. It could heal irreversible injuries.

Even if a bottle of vitality elixir could not completely heal the old man, it could at least restore 1% of his body. It would not be a problem for him to fly normally!

Flesh and blood were born on the old man’s body. Traces of vitality were emitted from his body.

Wang Xian watched quietly.

Ten minutes later, the flesh and blood on the old man’s body had completely recovered. Furthermore, he had turned into a slightly chubby old man.

Judging from his body size, he should weigh at least 300 kilograms according to Earth.

He was very chubby.

“Was it this benefactor who saved my life?”

The old man opened his eyes and stood up slowly. He bowed to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“I, Ming Xuanzhi, thank you for saving my life!”

Ming xuanzhi bowed again in gratitude. His fingers moved as he calculated, “This time, it will be more than 80 million years!”

“You’ve been here for more than 80 million years?”

Wang Xian looked at him in astonishment.

“Yes, benefactor. I entered this place more than 80 million years ago. The owner of this place is obviously a sly old man. The moment I picked up the chessboard that day, the formation here was activated and locked me in Here!”

“With my strength, I can’t break the formation at all. Furthermore, after I absorbed the spiritual energy here, I still have no way to break all my treasures. I have no choice but to restrain all my life force and leave everything to Fate!”

“It’s also fortunate that benefactor you came, or else I would really have passed away!”

Ming Xuanzhi said bitterly.

“What? Old Man, you said that all the treasures on you are gone?”

At this time, Ba Qi flew over and stared at him as he asked.
