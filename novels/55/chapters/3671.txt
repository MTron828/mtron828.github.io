3672 3671 Golden Roc and water demon!

The powerful effect of taking the ordinary fruit was somewhat beyond the expectations of the golden ROC expert!

This fruit was only for him to let the other experts in the demon breaker circle give it a try!

In the end, what he didn’t expect was that after absorbing eighty ordinary fruit, he was actually able to suppress the Inner Demon in his heart!

He returned to his normal rationality!

At the moment, he felt that his condition was abnormally good!

If he didn’t fight with his full strength, he could hold on for tens of millions of years!

Moreover, he felt that once he solved the problem of his mind, he would be able to achieve a breakthrough!

Consuming ordinary fruit was possible!

But he knew that he might need a little more than 100 ordinary fruit!

According to his calculation of the value of ordinary fruits, he needed to sell the only innate supreme treasure in his hand to get more than 100 ordinary fruits!

However, he didn’t expect that the other experts in the Demon Breaker Circle would send him this news!

“My current strength is at an unprecedented peak. If I maintain my rationality, my combat strength will increase a little, and I will be able to cooperate with other experts!”

“That Dragon King broke a plan of our Demon Breaker Circle, the heart of the lava space behemoth. Originally, I was prepared to use it to suppress my water attribute energy and suppress my mind, but now I have a better choice!”

“The connate cardinal treasure in my hands can not be used to trade for the eternal fetus fruits. Then if I want to obtain a large number of eternal fetus fruits…”

The golden-blue wings of Jin Fu suddenly stopped flying. His face revealed a thoughtful expression!

Opening the universe AI, he looked at the information about the Dragon King. Looking at the information one by one, he frowned slightly!

“I plus more than 150 experts from the demon breaker, it will be difficult to kill the Dragon King. That Dragon King has a large number of fruits of the womb. His strength is even more terrifying. The Mad Devil Prohibition and the old witch died at his hands. The Mad Devil Prohibition is dead, but the old witch’s strength is very terrifying!”

Jin Fu muttered. His mind was clear as he thought about what was going to happen next!

He looked at the river and flew downstream!

After flying for dozens of minutes, he floated in the sky above the river. With a move of his palm, he blasted downwards!

“Boom!”

The energy landed in the river, stirring up a large area of space in the river!

His attack was not an attack, but a gentle power!

“Weng Weng Weng Weng!”

In the long river below, the entire river suddenly began to churn!

On the surface of the river, an incomparably huge human face slowly condensed! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Water demon, there’s a good thing. It’s a huge opportunity for both of us. Are you interested?”

Jin Fu was floating on the river. He looked at the huge face and said!

“Jin Fu, your aura is very stable. It seems that you’ve temporarily suppressed your Inner Demon. If you have anything to say, say it now.”

The huge face on the river replied!

“You should be able to see my current situation. My current situation is very good. It’s all because I’ve obtained a large number of god fruits that can stabilize my mind. Dragon Palace Dragon King has many of these god fruits. I can predict that if I can consume a large number of these god fruits, I’ll be able to break through my shackles and reach the universe ruler realm!”

Jin Fu looked at him and said!

“Hualala!”

As soon as he finished speaking, that huge face condensed into a figure.

The figure was completely condensed from water. He raised his head and stared at Jin Fu.

“Dragon Palace? Who’s the Dragon King?”

Water Demon asked.

“You’ll know when you’re on the Universe AI. You want to merge your body into the river and drain your violent mind. This method is very difficult. As long as you have enough fruits, you don’t have to take the risk.”

Water Demon said to him!

Water Demon moved his palm, and a universe ai appeared in his palm. He looked at the information, and the water flowed on his body!

“I can use my connate true treasure to exchange for a large number of normal birth fruits!”

After more than ten seconds, water demon suddenly said.

“Water demon, one connate true treasure may not be enough. We don’t know how many normal birth fruits we need to completely stabilize our minds. I came to you for the second plan!”

Jin Hu continued speaking to him!

“Speak!”

Water demon stared at him, his eyes flickering!

“The Dragon King is now in the depths. Kill him, and everything he has will belong to us.”

Jin Hu’s eyes flickered.

“According to the information in the universe’s AI, we are not his match.”

Water Demon opened his mouth to speak!

“There are more than 150 strong warriors in our Demon Breaker Circle. He took away one of the space beasts in our Demon Breaker Circle.”

Jin Yu said bluntly, “In my current situation, I can fight with all my strength if I maintain my mind. Water Demon, you only need to form a powerful water clone. You can take 40% of the normal birth fruits. The 40% of the normal birth fruits in his hands should not be less than 200 to 300!”

“Okay!”

Water Demon hesitated for a moment and immediately nodded in agreement!

Fighting once might allow him to achieve a breakthrough, and it might completely solve the problem of the inner demon. Naturally, he would make a prompt decision!

“Let’s go. Let’s prevent him from escaping. We’ll rush over immediately!”

Jin Fu’s eyes shone brightly.

Water demon could not rush over with his real body, because once the battle erupted, water demon would lose his mind.

In a situation where he lost his mind, he could not differentiate between friend and foe. Thus, water demon could only use his clone to rush over, although he could not unleash his full strength.

However, it was not a problem for him to be on par with two top level old monsters from the invincible region!

Jin Jin himself, along with water demon and over 150 experts from the Demon Breaker Circle, had an 80% chance of defeating the Dragon King!

After all, with all these powers added together, even a level 2 universe overlord expert could fight or even defeat the other party!

In his opinion, an 80% chance was already worth it!

All of their strength was equivalent to four mad demons!

According to the information he got from the universe ai, that Dragon King’s strength should be comparable to three mad demons!

But one must know, this was the depths of the invincible region, one could not escape back to their god country in an instant!

Even if one was stronger than the other, one could defeat or even kill the other!

“Your speed is too slow. Add your water energy to my body, Void Water Escape!”

The water energy law of water demon’s body condensed. His whole body emitted a luster, turning into a thin river!

“Good. Water Demon, your water escape technique is the strongest in the invincible zone. With the enhancement of my energy, you can burst out with incredible speed!”

Jin Jin looked over and his eyes lit up as he said with a loud laugh!

“Boom!”

Jin Jin entered the small river and the water energy circulated!

The entire small river rushed forward at an unimaginable speed!
