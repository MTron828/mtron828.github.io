Chapter 913: 0914 diamond-level monsters were attacking the city

Translator: 549690339

“Ding! Congratulations to host for obtaining the light and Shadow Barrier!”

Light and shadow barrier: Transcendent Level 8 formation

Function: set up a barrier to trap the enemy and protect yourself.

“Ding! The second phase mission of the mercenary group has been activated. You have been promoted to a gold-level mercenary group. You will be rewarded with a random transcendent item!”

When Wang Xian was walking on the road, the system’s voice suddenly rang out, causing Wang Xian to be slightly stunned.

“An extraordinary level 8 formation. Not Bad, not bad. It can withstand an attack from an extraordinary level 8!”

“Furthermore, after upgrading to a gold-tier mercenary group, you will be able to obtain an extraordinary item at random!”

Wang Xian was full of smiles. If this light and shadow barrier was used properly, it would have a great effect.

When he returned to his residence, Wang Xian took out an elixir and swallowed it directly, obtaining more than 800 dragon crystals.

More than 800 dragon crystals were not enough to increase the strength of the members of the Dragon Palace. They could only continue to accumulate.

Following that, Wang Xian took out the mission stone plate and prepared to search for another place to complete the mission to increase his strength.

This time, he was prepared to choose a place where the level of the ferocious beasts was higher.

For low-level aquatic creatures, the amount of dragon crystals they obtained after swallowing them was too little. It was too slow to increase their level.

However, just as Wang Xian was looking for a mission...

In the most luxurious restaurant in Shenghai Town, a young man was sitting next to a woman with a fawning expression.

The woman was wearing the tight-fitting uniform of a city guard. However, it was this uniform that made the young man’s eyes burn with passion.

Beside the young man, there were more than a dozen young men sitting next to him. A few of them were the few people who were mocking Wang Xian in the hiring association.

“Liuyan, when are you going back to school? I’ll go with you. I’ll be able to take care of you on the way back!”

The young man poured a cup of tea for the girl with a flattering look and said with a smile.

“Let’s set off five days before school starts. There’s still half a month’s time!”

Jin Liuyan said to the young man calmly.

“Oh, is that so? It just so happens that we’ll be staying here for a period of time as well. It’s our first time coming to Shenghai town. We’ll go to Donghai City together!”

The young man said with a smile.

Jin Liuyan hesitated for a moment and nodded. “There are still some classmates in holy sea town. Let’s Go Together!”

“Okay!”

The young man nodded.

“Okay?”

At this moment, Jin Liuyan was suddenly shocked and hurriedly took out the communication stone plate from her pocket.

Her communication stone plate was different from the ordinary one. Obviously, it was much more advanced. At this moment, the communication stone plate was emitting light.

“Not good!”

When Jin Liuyan opened the communication stone plate and saw the words on it, her expression changed drastically and she suddenly stood up.

“What happened?”

The young man at the side saw Jin Liuyan suddenly stand up and asked with a stunned expression.

“Don’t leave the city. I’ll go to the Watchtower!”

Jin Liuyan immediately walked towards the window of the restaurant.

“Liuyan, what happened? Can I help?”

Seeing that Jin Liuyan was about to fly out, the young man frowned and hurriedly asked.

“Monster Siege!”

Without turning back, Jin Liuyan flew toward a watchtower in holy sea town. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Monster Siege?”

Hearing these words, the young man’s face changed dramatically. The dozen or so young men beside him were also stunned.

“A monster siege?”

They cried out in surprise, and a hint of fear appeared in their eyes.

“Dong Dong Dong!”

At this moment, the bell suddenly rang throughout the entire holy sea town, and the rapid bell chimes echoed in everyone’s hearts.

“What happened?”

“What’s going on? Why did the bell of the faraway watchtower suddenly ring?”

“Not good, something bad has happened!”

When everyone in holy sea town heard the bell, their expressions changed drastically, and their eyes revealed shock.

“Holy sea town, all mercenary groups, all cultivators above transcendent-level one, be on alert!”

“The monsters are about to attack the city!”

At this moment, a majestic voice covered the entire holy sea town and entered everyone’s ears.

When everyone heard this voice, their expressions changed drastically.

“It’s the mayor’s voice. Monsters are attacking the city!”

“Oh my God, monsters are attacking the city! Monsters are attacking the city! What level of monsters are attacking the city?”

“They actually made the mayor take precautions personally. The monster attack this time isn’t simple. I hope it’s not a powerful monster!”

In an instant, the entire holy sea town was in chaos.

The weak citizens prayed with pale faces.

A monster siege, a terrifying monster siege!

For everyone, the biggest disaster was a monster siege.

In the transcendence continent, many cities were destroyed by the monster siege and turned into ruins.

Countless experts died under the monster siege.

Once the city was breached, at least a million people would die.

The sudden siege of the city caused everyone to look terrified.

“Diamond-level monsters are attacking the city. Everyone, don’t Panic!”

“The mercenary will start the mission to defend the city!”

At this moment, the voice from earlier sounded again, comforting the panicked people.

“Diamond-level monsters are attacking the city. Fortunately, with the mayor’s presence, we should be able to resist them!”

“Phew, a diamond-level monster attacking the city shouldn’t be too much of a problem!”

“A diamond-level monster is still a little dangerous. Come, let’s go to the position of the city wall.”

“The mission to defend the city has begun. Haha, as long as we defend Holy Sea Town and kill the murderer Demon Beasts, we will be able to obtain a huge amount of resources to increase the level of the mercenary group!”

Some of them heaved a sigh of relief and followed closely behind the mercenary group and the city wall.

At this moment, Wang Xian, who was in his room, was slightly taken aback when he heard this majestic voice.

“A monster siege? A diamond-level monster siege?”

He was slightly taken aback and immediately stood up. His eyes were sparkling.

A monster siege was not very rare on the transcendence continent, especially for the town of Shenghai, which was located by the sea. It happened once every few years.

Compared to the safer town, the mayor’s strength was around transcendent-level rank-8. Only a special city like holy sea town was at transcendent-level rank-9.

Every time a monster attacked a city, a lot of employees would die.

However, every time a monster attacked a city, it was an opportunity for any mercenary group.

As long as it was not a destructive monster siege, they could kill a large number of fierce beasts and Demon Beasts with the advantage of the city wall.

The corpses of these demonic beasts and murderers were treasures!

“Let’s go. It will be difficult for diamond-level monsters to destroy the holy sea town. This monster feast is our chance to improve our strength quickly!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled as he immediately ordered the members of the Dragon Palace.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

A group of members of the Dragon Palace followed behind Wang Xian and headed towards the city walls.

There were four city gates in Shenghai Town. Only the south gate of the East Gate was closer to the seaside. Wang Xian headed straight for the East Gate.

On the way, Wang Xian opened the mission stone tablet.

At this moment, there was no mission on the mission stone tablet.

There was a line of words in the middle.

The mission to defend the city was about to begin!
