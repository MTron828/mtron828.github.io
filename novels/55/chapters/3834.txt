Chapter 3835 In 30,34,20 million years, she had become a god of War!

Lan Qingyue stepped into the battlefield.

A group of peak races gave her information, and he destroyed them.

However, this time, only the shamans and the skeleton race gave her two pieces of information.

One was about the eight space beasts, and the other was about a powerful army that believed in the universe.

Lan Qing Yue brought little blue over and easily destroyed them, obtaining the Faith Hearts of over 3,000 gods.

Among them, the number of level seven gods also reached 18!

The Faith Hearts of ordinary believers of the universe, however, obtained a total of over 20,000!

This battle was quite rewarding.

However, after Lan Qing Yue finished off these two faith universe combat powers, the other pinnacle races didn’t send her any more messages.

The gods who believed in the universe were a double-edged sword to the peak races!

They wanted to destroy them and obtain the heart of faith.

But they hoped that their peak races would destroy them.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

And not the other peak races.

The Dragon Palace had destroyed so many gods who believed in the universe this time, so obtaining the heart of faith was very terrifying.

Naturally, there would be many more experts born than them.

These hearts of faith were something they coveted!

Hence, the other peak races did not report any news.

Wang Xian, Lan Qingyue, and the rest did not care.

Compared to the number of gods and believers in the universe on the battlefield, Wang Xian’s side had more!

It was much more convenient to hunt here than on the battlefield!

If Wang Xian was not afraid of killing the gods who believed in the universe out of the starry universe, he would have acted wantonly long ago!

He would not have hidden his identity at all!

…

“Damn it, we suffered such heavy losses this time. Eight level five sovereign Kun were killed, and more than a dozen level seven gods were killed.”

At the passageway between the starry universe and the universe of belief, an old man from a palace had a gloomy and unsightly expression.

“In the Dragon Palace of the nine-origin universe, there is a powerful ancient god who feeds the Kun Lord Dragon. His Kun is not suppressed in the starry universe, and the Kun that attacked should have reached level six sovereign!”

Not far away, another expert from another palace said with a slight frown.

“This is indeed a huge problem. I really didn’t expect that there would be such a mysterious existence in the nine-origin universe.”

The old man frowned and scanned his surroundings.

Clearly, the other forces of the palace had also received this news.

They could take in some experts of the nine-origin universe as disciples, so they naturally had a very good understanding of the news of the nine-origin Universe!

They were clear about all the forces and Great Beings in the nine-origin universe.

Although a powerful Kun was very troublesome for them, it was not to the extent that they could not do anything about it!

Just like the Decree Palace, they had built a faith-based war god. It would take some time before it could be completed.

The other palaces were also carrying out some preparations!

The surrounding great beings of the various gods didn’t speak, and soon, they became completely silent.

They weren’t too surprised that such a powerful being could erupt from the nine-origin universe.

After all, the nine-origin universe was considered a relatively powerful existence among all the other universes!

Time continued to pass.

The war between the nine-origin universe and the Faith Universe was completely eased because of Lan Qing Yue’s sudden attack.

Many disciples of great beings once again stepped into the path of searching for treasures.

Occasionally, there would be some small-scale battles.

A few million years passed once again!

“Weng Weng Weng!”

At the same time, at the location of the Void Spirit treasured land, waves of powerful energy surged toward the surroundings!

At the center of the Void Spirit treasured land, around the black hole, the belief wargod that had been forged with soul energy had also reached the final stage.

“It has already been 20 million years. With the help of the power of the virtual spirit land, they managed to build an existence that is comparable to a level nine pantheon in more than 20 million years. This is considered to be very fast!”

Wang Xian looked ahead with a twinkle in his eyes.

20 million years seemed to be a long time. However, compared to hundreds of millions of years or one billion years, it was nothing.

If one was created in twenty million years, ten could be created in two hundred million years.

This was a great deal!

“Hahaha, is it going to succeed?”

At this moment, an excited voice was heard.

Wang Xian looked at the voice and immediately saw more than ten figures flying over. Each of them was an existence at the level of a seventh-level pantheon.

When he saw them, a smile appeared on his face.

“The creation of the belief god of war has been completed. The next step is to insert some memories into it!”

At the center, an elder from the law enforcement palace spoke without even turning his head back!

“Good, good, good. With this belief god of war, we can step into more places. Haha!”

More than a dozen level seven pantheon flew over from behind and spoke with smiles on their faces!

They floated in front and raised their heads to look at this god of faith.

“Come, let’s start injecting the memories!”

The elder from the decree palace smiled and flipped through the book in his hand!

When the book was flipped open, Faith Runes appeared one after another and surged towards the god of faith!

“It’s time to make a move. We can’t let them bestow the god of faith with memories and Wisdom!”

Wang Xian muttered to himself when he saw this scene!

He had waited for 20 million years for this scene. It was a full 20 million years before they were able to complete the creation of this god of war.

Once Wang Xian was able to obtain this god of war, his combat strength would be comparable to that of a level nine pantheon, not to mention other things.

This harvest could be said to be incomparably huge!

Of course, there was also the faith heart of these 10,000 or so gods.

It was worth it to wait for 20 million years!

Buzz

Buzz! Buzz

Just as they were imparting memories to the god of war, Wang Xian started to move.

Waves of light and darkness energy suddenly enveloped the entire space.

In addition, what they could not see was that outside of the light and darkness, there was a force of five elements!

To be on the safe side, Wang Xian instantly used all the power of the Five Elements Millstone and the Tai Chi Dragon Disc.

This was a strength that was comparable to six level nine pantheon gods!

When the terrifying and vast energy enveloped them, the faces of all the gods of faith suddenly changed.

“What’s going on? What Happened?”

“Oh no, what a terrifying energy! What a terrifying pressure!”

“What’s going on? What kind of existence is attacking us?”

At this moment, all the gods of faith scanned their surroundings with a look of horror. Their eyes were filled with vigilance.

Boom

However, in the next second, a wave of energy engulfed them!

This wave of energy was mixed with light and darkness as well as the five elements. The seven types of energy had almost merged together to form a strange energy!

Of course, this strange energy was also deliberately created by Wang Xian!

He didn’t want these people who believed in the universe to escape from the universe because they knew he was too strong.

To him, these people who believed in the gods were mature leeks!
