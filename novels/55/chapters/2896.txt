Chapter 2897: might of the Dragon Palace 4

This time, the Dragon Palace’s harvest was much more than the last war of the imperial court.

The last time they attacked the imperial court, the imperial court directly escaped and all the treasures that could be taken away were taken away.

And this time, the formation wizard association was completely wiped out. All the god emperors and more than a million god King experts were killed.

This month, the Dragon Palace found all the god King Experts’void God realms and obtained a large number of treasures.

All sorts of pills, all sorts of divine herbs and trees, it could be said that there were countless of them.

After all, this was the accumulation of over a million warriors.

These god countries were all given to the swallowing dragon and the others.

With so many undying God countries, ao Xie was prepared to give birth to more swallowing dragons, raising the number to 1 million.

These undying God countries were enough for all the swallowing dragons to reach the undying emperor level.

Furthermore, it allowed the combat strength of all the members of the devouring dragons to reach the immortal King Level 4 and above.

“Hu, upgrade!”

He exhaled and immediately transformed into a divine dragon. Large amounts of elixirs and herbs were poured into his mouth.

All sorts of resources transformed into Dragon Energy. Two days later, Wang Xian’s body trembled slightly.

Crack Crack Crack

His body size, which was already more than 20,000 meters in size, rose once again and slowly increased to 30,000 meters.

Eight rays of light flickered on his dragon scales. It was a little dazzling from afar.

Wang Xian, who had evolved once again, was something that could not be looked at directly.

An existence that could not be looked at directly!

“Ding, congratulations to host for increasing your level. You have reached Immortal King Level 7!”

The system’s voice sounded. Looking at the attributes in his mind, Wang Xian revealed a smile.

Undying god King Level 7 strength, God Emperor Level 3 combat strength.

With the ability of the incipient sacred wings, he could instantly kill a god Emperor Level 3 void God realm expert.

“I wonder if I am an invincible existence in this resplendent starry sky.”

Wang Xian sensed the power coming from his body and revealed a smile.

His body moved and transformed into a human form. The eight rays of light on his body were still glaring.

His body retracted and all the rays of light disappeared.

He used his mind to sense the location of the dragon transformation pool. All the members of the Dragon Palace were still increasing their strength.

“Next, I need to upgrade the level of the Five Elements Millstone!”

Wang Xian moved his palm and the Five Elements Millstone appeared.

The Five Elements Millstone was still a treasure equivalent to a peak-stage godly monarch. However, a peak-stage godly monarch was no longer sufficient for Wang Xian to use.

As his first divine weapon and the most convenient divine weapon, Wang Xian was prepared to continue upgrading it.

The five elements millstone could absorb materials of the five attributes of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth to upgrade its level.

This time, he obtained a large number of materials from the Wizard Association.

Among them, there were quite a number of materials for the level-two divine emperor of the Void.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

He took out the five elements Millstone and the five divine dragons on it let out a soft roar.

Within the five elements millstone, there were five avatars of Wang Xian. Unfortunately, due to the absence of the Earth Dragon Avatars, Wang Xian replaced them with avatars of the light attribute.

This greatly reduced the strength of the Five Elements Millstone.

However, there was nothing he could do about it.

He took out the materials one by one and placed them on the five elements millstone.

The five elements millstone began to operate, grinding the materials one by one into fragments for absorption.

Wang Xian infused his dragon energy and continued to nurture them.

Time passed day by day, and the five elements millstone was also improving rapidly.

Two months later, the Heaven Wizard region had settled down completely, and some people from the Emperor Star Field were still visiting.

The two regions were connected, and the Dragon Palace controlled important resources.

The resources they obtained every day could increase the number of god King Level Warriors in the Dragon Palace by a few thousand.

If all of them were used on a member of the Dragon Palace, it could raise a God level member to undying god King Level 5.

Of course, the Dragon Palace no longer had any god level members, the weakest had already reached undying level 5.

Over a million members, the weakest undying level 5, what did that mean?

Also, in these two months, the number of devouring dragons had increased to 1 million, the weakest undying level 4.

In other words, the Dragon Palace now had two million combat members. The lowest combat strength was immortal King Level 4.

It was simply terrifying.

Wang Xian was confident that the army of the Dragon Palace, even if it was the glazed area, would be able to sweep it away.

“Hahaha, one more step, one more step. I have finally become a little witch!”

An excited voice came from the location of the dragon transformation pool.

“Oh?”

When Wang Xian heard this voice, he moved and arrived in front of the dragon transformation pool.

In front of him, the heaven array was standing in the middle with an excited expression on his face.

At this moment, there were not one heaven array but nine. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

There were nine heaven arrays, and each of them exuded the power of a level two celestial thearch.

Each heaven array represented an attribute.

“Dragon King!”

Upon seeing Wang Xian’s arrival, a smile appeared on his face. With a move of his body, the nine heaven arrays transformed into one.

It was a nine-colored dragon head. Its body was very similar to that of a human.

Although it still looked a little strange, it was much better than the previous strange feeling.

“How is your strength now?”

Wang Xian looked at him and asked with a smile.

“Dragon King, you are much stronger than when you were at your peak. You have obtained a lot of knowledge about witchcraft. Now, I am able to fight against a third-level divine Lord!”

The sky array opened its mouth and said happily.

“Very good!”

Wang Xian also revealed a smile on his face.

The sky array had made a breakthrough. Now, there were two third-level divine lords in the Dragon Palace!

“The rest of you have all made the breakthrough, right?”

Wang Xian asked the Heaven Formation.

“The rest of the members of the Dragon Palace have already made the breakthrough. Now, there are 51 celestial thearchs in the Dragon Palace. Haha, Dragon King, 51 celestial thearchs. Who else could it be but the Dragon Palace?”

The Heaven Formation laughed out loud. His face was filled with pride.

“51!”

Wang Xian muttered as he flew towards the Dragon King Hall.

51. This included himself.

Even so, this was a huge number in the entire starry sky.

Two void God emperors were at the third rank, four were at the second rank, and 45 were at the first rank.

If other factions knew about this, they would definitely be shocked.

“I will head to the desolate land tomorrow. I wonder if the desolate land is still there. If it is, I will be able to obtain a lot of resources.”

Wang Xian made a decision indifferently and was full of smiles!
