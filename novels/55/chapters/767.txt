Chapter 768: 0769 was shocked (4/5)

Translator: 549690339

The day of the grand competition of the Yongchang Disciples was a gloomy day for the many heaven’s chosen disciples in the Yongchang World.

When the Dragon King made his move, the heaven’s chosen were gloomy.

Even his subordinate had the terrifying strength to crush all the Heaven’s chosen.

Especially the power of the immortals and gods that they unleashed in the end, which shook the entire Yongchang world.

When the Dragon King and his men left the Yongchang World and the Yongchang World appeared, the immortal sect had investigated the news of the Dragon King of the martial arts world.

The results of the investigation shocked them.

However, as there was no news of the Dragon King in the past year, the Yongchang World gradually forgot about the Dragon King.

They did not expect to meet the Dragon King who was casting clouds and rain in their world.

“Dragon King!”

Piao Lingxue hesitated for a moment before calling out to Wang Xian and walking over.

Speaking of which, her relationship with this Dragon King was pretty good.

The Immortal sect also knew the reason for the Dragon King’s Massacre before he left. Speaking of which, regardless of whether it was the Great Hong Immortal Sect, the Yongchang Immortal sect or the immortal slaying sect, they did not have much enmity with the Dragon King.

Flower Fairy addressed him as the Dragon King!

Piao linxue addressed him as the Dragon King!

The two of them walked towards the young man.

Everyone was stunned when they saw two of the top five beauties walking towards the young man.

Even the young man on top of the city-toppling beauty and the Thunder Beast had a look of astonishment on his face.

“Dragon King!”

“Dragon King!”

Mu Lingchuan immediately shouted and walked towards Wang Xian.

When Hong Tianda saw wandering snow walking over, he also called out respectfully and walked towards Wang Xian.

“Dragon King!”

Yin Fengwen also called out respectfully and walked over.

He was not from the Yongchang world, nor was he from the innate immortal sect. Instead, he was from the puppet immortal sect.

There was no need to mention the disciples of the Puppet Immortal sect and the Ming Wang Immortal sect.

Many of the disciples of the Ming Wang Immortal sect were killed, and the immortal gods of the immortal sect went to take revenge. In the end, all the disciples of the immortal sect received the news that it was forbidden to offend the Dragon King.

When he thought of this, Yin Fengwen felt his heart palpitate.

The Dragon King was definitely not someone that a disciple like him could offend, even if he was the most outstanding disciple of the Puppet Immortal sect and one of the heaven’s favorites in the jianghu.

When he met the Dragon King, he still had to greet him properly!

“Hiss!”

Seeing this scene, everyone around sucked in a breath of cold air.

What was going on? Why were the top beauties on the beauty chart greeting the seemingly ordinary young man one by one?

Especially the group of people who had just arrived, they looked at him in shock.

“Just now, the young clan leader of the Thunder Clan said that the young man wasn’t qualified to be compared to him!”

“Cheng Qingcheng also said that the young man was an unknown person and was inferior to the young clan leader of the Thunder Clan!”

“This, this, this, what’s going on now? Two Peerless Beauties went to greet him, and the three heaven’s chosen walked over. From the looks of it, they were all very respectful!”

A few disciples from the immortal sects looked at this scene in astonishment and started to discuss.

“Dragon King?”

The young clan leader of the Thunder clan and Cheng Qingcheng’s expression darkened when they heard the discussion around them. Their eyes were sparkling as they stared at the young man whom they had overlooked.

“Dragon King!”

Wang Xian nodded at Fairy Centaurea and Mu Lingchuan who were walking over. He looked at Piao Lingxue and Hong Tianda.

“Long time no see!”

Wang Xian said to them indifferently.

“Long time no see!”

Piao lingxue sized up Wang Xian and nodded with a smile.

“No Way. According to the description on the ultimate beauty chart, the reason why Cheng Qingcheng was ranked first was because she loved to smile. Her smile could topple cities and she was ranked first on the ultimate beauty chart!”

“As for flower fairy, she has the scent of a hundred flowers blooming. She’s so quiet that she’s like the most beautiful flower in the world. As for wandering snow, she’s as white as snow and as cold as snow. The two of them should be relatively high and mighty beauties. But now, they actually look so...”. “This is so wrong. It’s completely different from the description!”

“Why do I have the illusion that flower fairy seems to like that young man?”

When the crowd saw the two goddesses looking at the young man with smiles on their faces, they could not help but swallow their saliva in disbelief.

The young clan leader of the Thunder clan and Cheng Qingcheng also looked on in shock.

Who was that young man? He actually caused flower fairy and wandering snow to treat him in such a manner!

When Tang Yinxuan saw the two beauties who suddenly appeared, she raised her eyebrows and pursed her lips slightly.

“Dragon King, did you guys find a way to attract the terrestrial star fish?”

Flower Fairy asked Wang Xian with a twinkle in her eyes.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. “A friend of mine found a way to attract the terrestrial star fish. It’s just that it’s a little loud and will attract the attention of others!”

“No matter how loud it is, unless someone is looking for trouble, some of the commotion is not a problem. To be able to find a way to attract the terrestrial star fish, it’s really amazing!”

Wang Xian smiled and looked around. He said in a deep voice, “We are using a special method to attract the earth star fish. Everyone, don’t disturb us. Otherwise, you will have to bear the consequences!”

Cheng Qingcheng’s expression changed when she heard Wang Xian’s words. A method to attract the earth star fish was very important to the Fengyan Celestial sect.

Otherwise, she wouldn’t have come here personally. Now, she was actually warning them not to disturb her. This made her face turn slightly ugly.

However, when she saw the few heaven’s favorites and beauties around him, her face turned even uglier.

This young man whom she didn’t even look at earlier, who even said bluntly that the young man was inferior to the young clan leader of the Thunder clan, was actually surrounded by beautiful heaven’s favorites.

This was simply a slap in the face to what she had just said!

“And you, don’t come and disturb yinxuan in the future. Don’t be so arrogant in front of me. I’ll give you a warning!”

Wang Xian’s gaze landed on the Thunder Beast Young Man and warned him lightly.

This caused the Thunder beast young man’s expression to change. He looked extremely gloomy and dark.

“Young master, we want to obtain the method to attract the earth star fish. We are willing to pay some price in exchange!”

Cheng Qingcheng looked at Wang Xian and said with a twinkle in her eyes.

“I’m not interested!”

Wang Xian looked at her and shook his head coldly. This made Cheng Qingcheng’s expression turn ugly.

No matter what, she was the number one beauty in the Peerless Beauty chart. To think that she would be rejected so coldly by a young man.

This made her look ugly!

“No one else has the right to tell me what I, Lei Mingyuan, do!”

The young man on the Thunder Beast said as he stared at Wang Xian with a dark expression and a twinkle in his eyes.

He did not have much scruples about this mysterious Dragon King. This place was very close to their celestial sect.

The mysterious sea also belonged to their territory. Therefore, even though this young man was very mysterious, he was not afraid at all!

Just as the young man finished his sentence, a terrifying power that caused one’s heart to palpitate suddenly came from the bottom of the sea.

Bang

Suddenly, a ten-meter-large creature was thrown up!
