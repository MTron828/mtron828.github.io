Chapter 1144: 1145 dragon thorns came at her

Translator: 5496903

A slap to the face. Feng Luan felt that Wang Xian was intentionally slapping her in the face. This made her a little angry. She glared at Wang Xian.

“You can go to Hell!”

She snorted coldly and said directly.

“UH... HEHE!”

Wang Xian smiled awkwardly. “It’s you who don’t want these treasures. All the Demon Beast bloodlines are hidden in the sculptures of the ferocious beasts. However, if you want to obtain them, you need to enter the sculptures without damaging them. Once damaged, the bloodlines in the sculptures will immediately die and dry up!”

“You bunch of insightful emptiness realm experts are simply squandering. You have to know that there is one more insightful emptiness realm bloodline in the sculptures. According to the records of the Hundred Patrol Elders, there are five half-step insightful emptiness realm bloodlines. All of them have been destroyed by you guys!”

“Now, just thinking about it makes my heart ache!”

As he spoke, he sighed slightly.

The corner of Feng Luan’s mouth twitched. She had indeed seen the dried up blood previously. Moreover, there was more than one. She had seen three to four of them.

When she thought of the possibility of having a bloodline at the insightful void Tier, her heart ached a little.

Then, she recalled how the other insightful void tier experts had said that Wang Xian was a fool and a good-for-nothing. Now, who was the Fool and who was the good-for-nothing?

It was obvious at a glance!

“You’re still trying to be a good-for-nothing after getting a bargain. I’ll help you sell your pet eggs and bloodline. I have a lot of uses for them!”

Feng Luan said directly with a dissatisfied look.

“Alright, Alright. I want elixirs. A large number of elixirs!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile. If he sold these items, his level would increase again.

At that time, he would be able to contend against even a powerhouse at the insightful void tier.

Furthermore, the remaining dragon energy would be able to give the dragon palace a huge upgrade.

“Alright. I will exchange them for elixirs then!”

Feng Luan nodded and said directly.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded.

“Dragon King, the group of DRAKONIDS have arrived!”

At this moment, a strange voice sounded beside him.

“Are they here? Tell them to come and look for me tomorrow morning!”

Wang Xian was slightly taken aback as a smile appeared on his face.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao nodded and disappeared immediately.

“I need to settle some matters here for a few days!”

Wang Xian looked at Feng Luan and said directly.

“There’s no rush!”

Feng Luan shook her head.

“That’s Good!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and turned his head to look at the room beside him.

His eyes flashed with a demonic luster as a scene appeared in his vision.

A young man was sitting there. Beside him were a few middle-aged men. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Young Master Ying, Duskdune is missing. When we went to check just now, we found that there was no one next door. They went to the Hundred Beast City, and just returned!”

A middle-aged man stood beside the young man and reported respectfully.

“Missing? What is that fellow from Duskdune doing?”

Young Master Ying’s expression was a little awkward. Duskdune was a top-notch assassin within the undercurrent assassin organization, but now he had disappeared!

As for saying that he had been killed by the fellow next door, he would not believe it.

Because there had been no sounds of fighting, and there had been no terrifying sounds of fighting. Moreover, the fellow next door had not been in his room just now.

This made him absolutely not think that the assassin he had sent over had already died!

“Young Master Ying, don’t be anxious. Lord duskdune should have gone into the Hundred Beast City. Lord Darkness had also gone into the Hundred Beast City just now and had just returned. Lord duskdune should have been delayed!”

The middle-aged man said hurriedly.

“Alright, Alright. Then let that Brat live another night!”

Young Master Ying’s expression was slightly malevolent. He snorted coldly and waved his hand. “Get Out!”

“Yes, Young Master Ying!”

The middle-aged man nodded his head hurriedly.

Wang Xian sat in the room. From the way they mouthed, he could tell what they were saying.

The corner of his mouth curled up slightly. “Young Master Ying, it seems like you are another second generation. I wonder what kind of existence you belong to in the undercurrent assassin organization. However...”

His eyes flickered. Since this fellow wanted to kill him, he wouldn’t be polite.

“When the group of Drakonids are ready tomorrow, I will make an example of you. In Bright Moon City, I will use your reputation as the commander of the dragon spikes to awe the bright moon city!”

Wang Xian revealed a faint smile.

Feng Luan, who was at the side, saw Wang Xian’s smile and knew that this fellow was definitely up to no good.

Bright Moon City was bustling with activity tonight. The incident in the Hundred Beasts City, the siege of the city by a group of powerful ferocious beasts, and the death of tens of thousands of people.

Even though it was night time, Bright Moon City was bustling with activity.

Wang Xian laid on the chair leisurely and began to cultivate. The biggest reward tonight was him.

Bright Moon City became even more lively in the early morning.

“Do you want to eat something?”

Wang Xian looked at Feng Luan who was cultivating and asked.

“Alright!”

Feng Luan opened her eyes and nodded.

“Damn slave, how dare you bump into our young master Ying!”

“Bang!”

At this moment, a cold voice came from outside. Following that, a strong force crashed into their room door.

The room was knocked open and two figures fell to the ground.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and looked at the two people on the ground. His eyes revealed a cold expression.

“I...”

Long Yi looked extremely embarrassed. A hint of fear appeared in his eyes as he stared at the group of people outside.

“What do you mean by ‘I’? You are courting death!”

A middle-aged man stared coldly at Long Yi and the other two people who were lying on the ground. He was filled with killing intent.

The other eight DRAKONIDS who were standing outside looked extremely embarrassed.

However, they were too weak and were no match for them.

“You dare to hit my men? Are you courting death?”

Wang Xian looked over coldly and stared at young master Ying who was standing in the middle as he said coldly.

“Hehe, I knew that it was your men who did it. So What?”

Young Master Ying raised his head slightly and stared at Wang Xian with his dark eyes. He said with disdain, “Don’t think that you are arrogant just because you are an extraordinary level nine powerhouse!”

“Very good!”

Wang Xian stood up slowly and stared at him. “Very soon, you will be filled with regret!”

“Haha!”

Young Master Ying laughed out loud when he heard his words. “Let me tell you then. Very soon, you will be filled with regret too. Kid, just you wait and See!”

“HMPH!”

After he finished his sentence, he snorted coldly and walked down arrogantly. His eyes were filled with disdain.

He didn’t think much of an extraordinary level nine fellow. If there were no problems with duskdune sand, this fellow would already be a dead man!

“Dragon King!”

Seeing them leave, Long Yi and the rest stood up with pale faces. Their faces were filled with bitterness. “We didn’t...”

“There’s no need to explain. It’s just a dead man. Don’t mind him!”

Wang Xian waved his hand.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Long Yi and the rest nodded respectfully. A few other drakonids walked in as well.

“All of you, go to Bright Moon City immediately to look for a spy and prepare to set up a trap. Today, we will tell everyone that our dragon thorns are here!”

Wang Xian looked at the group of drakonids and spoke to them in a deep voice.

“It’s the Dragon King. We promise to complete it today!”

The group of DRAKONIDS nodded their heads immediately.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head slowly. His eyes flickered as he looked at the footprints on Long Yi and the rest.

Let’s start with them!
