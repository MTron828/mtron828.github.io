Chapter 1022: 1023 was in a bad mood

Translator: 5496903

“Alright!”

When Wang Xian heard what he said, he was in a bad mood.

Even if this was Fengxian, even if he knew this was Fengluan’s shop.

However, how could I, Wang Xian, be in a good mood when someone in your shop treated me like this.

He turned around and led Ao Jian and the rest away from Fengxian.

“Hey, young master... Young Master...”

The staff member shouted at Wang Xian anxiously.

However, Wang Xian ignored him. The young man in the room was obviously the higher-ups of Fengxian.

He could not understand why Fengluan would let a foolish guy become the higher-ups of Fengxian?

“I wanted to help you initially. Since your subordinates are so foolish, I won’t help you anymore. Develop well and see you in the future!”

Wang Xian mumbled. If he didn’t help Feng Xian, he would be able to gain even more benefits.

“Brother Huoyuan, if our master finds out that you have driven a customer away like this, he will definitely punish you!”

At this moment, in the living room of Feng Xian’s shop, a girl said to the young man.

“HMPH, this bunch of fellows. Wherever there is a discount, they will go to the shop where there are things they need. As long as we have their needs, they will obediently roll over!”

The young man said with disdain.

A few days ago, there was not much business in Donghai City’s Phoenix Elixir and weapons workshop.

However, when they arrived, their business had already surpassed the other two shops.

He did not have a good impression of this group of customers who took advantage of the situation.

He was even a little angry.

“That’s true!”

A few girls nodded their heads.

“Manager, manager Yi!”

At this moment, six people walked into the Fengxian Pill and weapons workshop.

The staff member who received Wang Xian earlier immediately greeted them.

“Alright, take care of the customers!”

Among the six people, besides manager Yi and the manager of the shop, there were four other people, three women and a middle-aged man.

They had a special temperament and their eyes were slightly red. It was very peculiar.

Experienced people could realize that they were not actually human.

The shopkeeper said to the staff member, then respectfully gestured to the four people and let them in.

The staff member hesitated for a moment, then shouted again, “Shopkeeper, supervisor Yi, I have something to tell you!”

“Huh? What is it?”

Manager Yi saw that the staff member was still reporting to him and asked doubtfully.

“Just now, young master Wang came to our shop!”

The staff member said with a bad expression.

“Oh? He came? Is He still there?”

Manager Yi quickly asked.

“He has already left. I. . . I brought young master Wang and the others to the reception hall and was chased away by the Lords inside!”

The staff member said with a bitter face.

“What?”

The expressions of supervisor Yi and the shopkeeper changed drastically, and they looked at the staff member with an embarrassed expression.

“What did young master Wang Say at that time?”

Supervisor Yi hurriedly asked with an embarrassed expression.

“Young master Wang only said that you treated the customers like this, and then he left in anger!”

The staff member replied.

“This...”

Manager Yi and the shopkeeper’s faces instantly turned ugly.

“What’s the matter, manager Yi?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The four people at the side heard their conversation and slightly frowned as they asked.

“A distinguished guest was chased away by Young Master Huoyuan!”

Manager Yi took a deep breath, his brows tightly knitted together, and his expression was extremely ugly.

“Oh? Distinguished Guest?”

The middle-aged man frowned, and then he lightly shook his head. “Forget it, as long as we have something that our customers need, we won’t be short of customers!”

“The young master who bought 1.5 billion middle-grade spirit stones from our Phoenix Immortal, and also helped us solve the problem of the Holy Sea Town!”

Chief Yi continued to say with an embarrassed expression.

“What? It’s him?”

The four people were slightly shocked, and their expressions gradually became serious. The middle-aged man’s expression changed somewhat awkwardly.

They naturally knew of a young man who bought four to five hundred million middle-grade spirit stones from their Phoenix Immortal in the Eastern Sea City.

Back then, when all the cities were attacked by the holy item forging workshop and the life and Death Pill Workshop, only the Eastern Sea city had to buy a large number of elixirs.

Naturally, they were very concerned about this matter.

“Contact that young master immediately and see if he can make it up to us!”

The middle-aged man said hurriedly.

“Okay!”

Supervisor Yi nodded his head. He immediately took out his communication stone plate and sent a message to Wang Xian.

“Let’s go in. That kid from the source of fire is really lacking!”

Everyone entered the living room.

“Master!”

“Mom!”

Four young men and women immediately walked over and shouted.

Everyone took a look at the source of fire. Their eyes were filled with displeasure.

“What’s wrong, master? Martial uncles, I. . .”

“You are more than capable of failing. Did you chase away an important guest just now?”

The middle-aged man interrupted him and asked coldly.

“Master, how... How did I. . .”

Huo Yuan was slightly stunned and asked with some fear.

“I got a reply. He said that he doesn’t need any compensation, as long as Huo Yuan kneels and apologizes!”

At this time, chief Yi took a deep breath and said with an embarrassed expression.

“What? You want me to kneel and apologize? How is that possible? Does he want to die?”

Huo Yuan shouted angrily in a low voice.

“Shut up!”

The middle-aged man shouted angrily at him, “Do you know what kind of guest you chased away?”

As the middle-aged man spoke, his expression was a little awkward. asking his disciple to kneel down and apologize was a little too much.

“If something like this happens again in the future, don’t ever come out again!”

In the end, the middle-aged man glared at him coldly.

“Sigh!”

Manager Yi sighed softly. He knew that this matter might be settled just like that.

Thinking about how the auction was being attacked by the holy item forging workshop and the life and death forging workshop, as well as how a distinguished guest was offended, it was simply adding insult to injury.

Wang Xian was in a very bad mood. Could it be that Feng Luan didn’t know that the customer was a god.

Therefore, he gave a reply after seeing the reply from director Yi.

If they were sincere, they would still talk to him. If not, then forget it.

“Dragon King, someone is walking towards us!”

At this moment, ao Jian reminded him.

He looked over and saw a group of more than 20 people walking towards him.

The middle-aged man in the lead had a murderous look in his eyes as he locked onto them.

Around him, there were two experts at level eight of transcendence, one at level seven of transcendence, and the rest were all at level six of transcendence!

The people on the road looked fearful when they saw them.

“Who is it?”

Wang Xian frowned slightly as he saw them walking towards him.

“My son was killed by you, and so were the experts sent by you. I really didn’t expect that. However, very soon, I will make your life a living hell!”

The group of people walked over. The middle-aged man in the middle spoke in a cold voice.
