“He’s too powerful. Our Army, our general, is simply too powerful!”

“Haha, that’s right. However, the most powerful one is still lord Wang Xian. Lord Wang Xian actually called for a powerful demonic beast race. His archery skills are simply too domineering!”

“General Mang Hong is also very impressive. That gigantic saber radiance seems to be able to split the heaven and earth apart. Xing Guang is a legendary figure in star-moon kingdom, yet he was still chased and beaten by Lord Mang Hong!”

“The most domineering ones are the experts of the Wind Eye clan. They are simply too cool. They killed their enemies from thousands of miles away. That Powerful Heavenly Moon Sect’s Heavenly Moon Soul Chaser was directly killed by more than half of the experts of the Wind Eye clan!”

“Lord Mu Zesen is also very cool. He directly shot and killed an expert of the first and second rank of the profound void realm. With Lord Wang in our dragon-phoenix dynasty, there is no enemy that we can’t defeat!”

“I just feel that Lord Queen is the strongest. She killed an expert of the Seethrough realm in a single move. TSK TSK, I almost knelt down at that time!”

When Feng Luan, Wang Xian, and the rest flew towards the city lord’s residence, the citizens of dragon-phoenix City were talking excitedly.

They looked at everyone in the dragon-phoenix Army with admiration and yearning on their faces.

The fact that dragon-phoenix city withstood the attack of star-moon kingdom was undoubtedly a reassurance for everyone in dragon-phoenix city. Following that, the thoughts of all the citizens became active.

The current dragon-phoenix Empire was just as the queen had said. Everyone had the chance to become a powerhouse, and everyone had the chance to become a founding general.

The dragon-phoenix Empire possessed the power of the star-moon kingdom, and it would definitely develop in the future. Those who advanced together with the Empire would definitely receive top-notch treatment.

The dragon-phoenix Empire had just been established, and many positions were vacant. If they could join, they would be able to rise above others and live a better life.

If the dynasty was strong, they would be strong as well.

Moreover, now that the dragon-phoenix Dynasty had established the dragon-phoenix Academy, the experts of the second level of the insightful emptiness realm would personally guide them. Their children would enter the academy and become the first batch of students.

In the future, they would definitely be able to have an official position and enjoy extremely high treatment.

“Liu Qianjun, Liu Hanhai, and Liu Qianhai, in today’s battle with the star-moon kingdom, did not fear death. They fought to the death and died in the battle. As the hero of the dragon-phoenix dynasty, the queen will reward the only descendant of the Liu family, Liu Qing, with the bloodline of a group of demon beasts of the second level of the insightful emptiness realm, and the Liu family, with their sacrifice for the dragon-phoenix Dynasty

“In addition, in this battle, all the sacrificed citizens will be rewarded by Her Majesty the Queen!”

At this moment, Yu Chengzi’s voice suddenly rang out in dragon-phoenix city, causing all the citizens who were discussing to reveal shocked expressions on their faces.

“What? Reward the Demon Beast bloodline of the profound void second rank wind eye clan? Oh My God, if this is the Liu family ascending to the heavens in one step!”

“I... I... I Can’t believe it. Is this true? They actually offered such a generous reward. The bloodline of the Profound Void Second Rank Demon Beast is able to make the Liu family a top-notch family!”

“Oh my God, the Liu family is a family that escaped from Xilai town. It’s an aristocratic family of mercenaries. When Xilai town was destroyed, more than half of the family members died. After Lord Wang saved Dragon-phoenix city, they were very grateful to Lord Wang. This time, when star-moon kingdom invaded, the furious Liu family trio were the first to rush out. I didn’t expect that the Queen...”. “The queen actually rewarded such a terrifying thing!”

Everyone in dragon-phoenix city froze. Many of them were trembling, and their eyes were burning.

The sacrifice of three members of the family had exchanged for a Demon Beast bloodline at the second level of the profound void tier, and for the chance for their descendants to become top-tier experts.

This was simply a great thing.

“As long as one pays for the dragon-phoenix dynasty, one will receive a huge reward!”

These words appeared in the minds of all the citizens of dragon-phoenix City, and their faces were filled with determination.

Gathering the hearts of the people. At this moment, the hearts of the people of the dragon-phoenix Empire were 100% gathered.

Under the protection of the powerful array formation, the queen wasn’t stingy with her rewards, and the entire dragon-phoenix Empire was united.

This time, if someone came to attack Dragon-phoenix city, millions of people would rush out to fight.

The one who won the hearts of the people would rule the world. Even if this was a matter where the strong were respected, this sentence still worked.

“Thank you, Queen. In the future, I, Liu Qing, am willing to bleed all the blood for the Dragon Phoenix Dynasty!”

At this time, in the city Lord’s mansion, a young man knelt there with a respectful face and vowed with a resolute gaze.

“I believe that, Go and fuse your bloodline into your body. The Dragon Phoenix Dynasty will nurture you into a top-notch expert!”

Feng Luan said faintly to the young man who was kneeling in front of her.

“It’s the Queen!”

The young man left respectfully. His body was trembling slightly.

“Thank you, Wang Xian. I don’t know how to repay such a valuable item!”

In the Hall, Jin Ganyuan, Mang Hong, and the rest were sitting on both sides.

Wang Xian was sitting below Feng Luan. Beside him was Mou Zesen.

“Who are we? Don’t be so calculative. I don’t want to watch. When I’m already at the top of the supernatural continent, you’re still working on a kingdom. Haha!”

Wang Xian laughed and said nonchalantly.

Feng Luan looked at him and smiled. She rolled her eyes at him and said, “Alright, then I won’t stand on ceremony!”

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly.

“I’m really envious of you. I can help you take care of the matters of the Dragon Palace!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Feng Luan looked at him with slight envy. She looked at Jin Qianyuan and the rest and said, “After this, the dragon-phoenix city will be expanded rapidly. We will use the power that the entire dragon-phoenix city can use. In addition, we will recruit City Guards!”

“It’s the Queen!”

The group of people nodded respectfully and walked out.

“I don’t know who young master Wang is to be able to make the queen so close to him. Moreover, that wind eye illusion arrow is actually one of young master Wang’s subordinates!”

“The Wind Howl Kingdom wanted to obtain the wind eye illusion Arrow’s bloodline, which was why it broke apart. I didn’t expect that Lord Wang would directly give it to the Queen!”

The four people walked out of the hall and said with a slight sigh.

Jin Qianyuan, in particular, had a shocked expression on his face.

He had given away the bloodline of a void interpretation level demon beast just like that, and the queen had even directly rewarded the Liu family. Such a large sum of money made even his eyes burn with passion.

This made him even more determined to follow the Queen!

After the Star Moon Kingdom’s invasion ended, the entire dragon and Phoenix dynasty emitted a sense of vitality.

Hundreds of thousands of people from the dragon-phoenix dynasty began to expand the imperial city. According to the plan, the dragon-phoenix city would be expanded at least tenfold.

Moreover, this was only the first expansion.

The dragon-phoenix dynasty had completely stabilized, and the Dragon Palace was also developing rapidly.

Ao qitian, Ao Qi, and the others led their subordinates to hunt fierce beasts in the surrounding waters. The corpses of fierce beasts turned into dragon blood.

The strength of the members of the Dragon Palace was increasing every day.

At this speed, it wouldn’t be long before the entire Dragon Palace would be turned upside down!
