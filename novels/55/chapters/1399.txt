Chapter 1400: The 1,400 members of the Dragon Palace came to pick up the brothers and bring them home

“Begin, the trial!”

When these four words rang out in the sky, everyone’s hearts shook.

After the carefree order was issued, all the people, including the city lord, had to be led by the token holder.

All the experts and families of the carefree city looked at the young city Lord who was standing at the front.

“Young City Lord, who do you want to kill? Just say the word and we will kill them!”

An insightful void martial artist shouted in a fawning manner.

“Cut them into eight pieces or be executed by cutting them into pieces. Young City Lord, just a word from you can provoke the people of our Xiaoyao City and make them beg for Death!”

“That’s right. No one in this 100,000 kilometers radius has the ability to be so arrogant in our Xiaoyao City!”

The voices of the experts rang out one after another. Their eyes swept across Wang Xian and the rest who were surrounded. A hint of coldness appeared on their faces.

“59 insightful void realm experts. Is this the entire strength of Xiaoyao City?”

“It’s really terrifying. This strength is not weaker than the dragon and Phoenix Empire, right? Moreover, this is not even including the mayor of Xiaoyao City!”

The experts from the various dynasties and sects looked around in shock, their hearts filled with astonishment.

Whoosh

At this moment, the young city Lord slowly raised the arm in his hand. After hearing his father’s words, he started to curry favor with the families of the nearby carefree city.

He slowly raised his hand.

When he raised his arm, everyone shut their mouths and fell silent. Everyone looked at the young city lord.

“That fellow from the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, who did you say I am? Have you thought about what’s happening now?”

“Do you think that your dragon and Phoenix Empire can look down on everything just because you destroyed four empires?”

The young castellan had a sinister smile on his face as he stared coldly at Wang Xian.

“Your Dragon and Phoenix Empire is extremely carefree in our Xiaoyao city. You think that you are powerful and want to threaten the Liu residence to destroy them. This is the first offense!”

“You ordered your subordinates to forcefully take away the third young lady of the Gilded Gold family in our Xiaoyao City. This is the second crime!”

“Provoking me is the third crime!”

“You will die for betraying me!”

An extremely powerful voice came out of the young city Lord’s mouth once again. He stared coldly at Wang Xian and judged him.

The three crimes were to sentence you to death!

“How dare you! If you dare to kill our King, we will fight you to the death!”

Duan Jinming’s expression changed drastically. His body shook and he took two steps forward. A terrifying aura spread out in all directions.

“We will not accept this punishment!”

The Fire Hammer clan leader also stood beside Duan Jinming with a furious expression. Similarly, he unleashed all of his strength at the profound void tier.

Their strength was at the first level of the profound void tier and the second level of the profound void tier. However, because they cultivated the divine dragon transformation and activated the Divine Dragon bloodline, they could fight against opponents of a higher level.

The aura that erupted from them caused everyone to be slightly shocked.

“Eh? What great strength. That fire hammer young man has the strength of the third level of the void interpretation realm, but why does that fire hammer clan leader also have the strength of the void interpretation realm! ?”

“This... didn’t it say a few days ago that the fire hammer clan only has one at the first level of the Void Interpretation Realm? Why is it now a third level of the void interpretation realm and a second level of the Void Interpretation Realm?”

“Oh my God, this previously lowly fire hammer clan actually has such terrifying strength!”

When the two people’s strength completely erupted, the surrounding people revealed shocked expressions.

They stared at Duan Jinming and the Fire Hammer clan leader with their mouths agape, and their eyes slightly widened.

How could this lowly clan be so strong?

“HM?”

The young city Lord saw the aura that Duan Jinming and the Fire Hammer clan leader had released. He slightly raised his eyebrows and a trace of surprise flashed in his eyes.

“Hehe, do you think that your fire hammer clan can escape today?”

The young city lord coldly swept his gaze over the fire hammer clan.

The members of the Fire Hammer clan stared at the young city Lord with furious faces.

“Now, I will give your fire hammer clan a chance to live. Either you become the lowly slave race of Xiaoyao City, or you will die together with that fellow from the dragon-phoenix Dynasty!”

“You have two choices. You can choose, Hehe!”

The young city Lord declared to the fire hammer clan with a cold smile on his face.

You can either become a slave or Die!

As soon as he finished speaking, all the members of the Fire Hammer clan revealed furious expressions on their faces.

“Haha, don’t even think about making us slaves. Even if we die, our fire hammer clan will fight you to the death!”

“That’s right, if you want us to be slaves, scram! What the F * ck is so great about the young city Lord! ?”

The members of the Fire Hammer clan shouted out sternly.

“A bunch of lowly races, shut up!”

In the surroundings, many insightful void realm experts heard the cursing of the members of the Fire Hammer clan. With a loud shout, the auras of insightful void realm experts directly covered them.

“Despicable clan. Since you have chosen to die, I shall grant you your death!”

The young city lord stared at everyone around Wang Xian with a cold expression. “Whoever stands with the dragon and Phoenix Empire will die today!”

As he spoke, his gaze landed on the people from the Bamboo Mountain sect. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The people from the Bamboo Mountain sect stood unmoving. They stood behind Wang Xian with a cold smile on their faces!

“Get Ready!”

The young castellan’s body slowly revealed a murderous aura as he growled.

“Obey the orders of the young castellan!”

The families and experts from Xiaoyao City responded loudly.

“Wait!”

At this moment, a faint voice came from the sky.

“Huh?”

“The Voice of the castellan? What’s Going On?”

The sudden stop of the castellan caused everyone to be slightly stunned. They looked at the sky in astonishment.

“Father!”

The young city Lord also looked at his father in astonishment. He didn’t understand why his father suddenly spoke.

“Since I issued the carefree token, I’ve only issued a total of four pieces. The value of each piece is enough for me to make a move once!”

The city Lord looked at the carefree token above his son’s head and smiled. “The use of the carefree token to kill some people is simply too wasteful!”

“Father, what do you mean?”

The young city Lord was stunned as he stared at his father in confusion.

“The people of the dragon-phoenix dynasty are running rampant in our Xiaoyao City. If they don’t put us in their eyes, then they will destroy the entire dragon-phoenix Dynasty!”

The city Lord spoke in a shocking tone.

The moment he finished speaking, everyone’s faces were filled with shock.

This was especially so for the surrounding dynasties and sects. Their eyes were wide open and filled with shock.

They looked at the expressionless city lord in the sky and could not help but swallow a mouthful of saliva.

This was a powerhouse!

Since the carefree order had been issued, it would be a waste to just kill a few people from the dragon-phoenix dynasty.

Since it was a waste, then they would destroy the entire dragon-phoenix dynasty!

Domineering. This was the domineering aura of the city lord of Carefree City.

The domineering aura of a clan powerhouse within a radius of 100,000 kilometers.

Destroying a dynasty was so effortless.

It was so high and mighty.

Judgement, dragon-phoenix Dynasty!

Death sentence!
