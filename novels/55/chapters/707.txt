“Senior brother, my boss is a martial artist, and he is very powerful!”

Wang Dahai quickly said to the young man.

“A martial artist?”

The girl in the middle raised her eyebrows slightly when she heard Wang Dahai’s words. Her arrogant eyes swept across Wang Xian.

To be able to make Wang Dahai call him boss and say that he was very powerful, he must be at least a level eight martial artist.

“I’ll take advantage of some time to come over and teach you two moves. Don’t waste my time!”

At this moment, a young man’s voice sounded.

Everyone’s gaze focused on the young man, their faces filled with respect.

This young man was an elite disciple of the Ming Wang Immortal sect. His strength had already reached the half-step Dan stage

He had specially come to the university to learn modern knowledge. He was not in charge of the martial arts club’s teaching methods. This time, he was invited over by a few disciples of the martial arts club to give him some pointers.

The young man had shaved off his long hair and was dressed in a white robe. He was handsome and dashing, and he had the demeanor of a proud son of heaven.

“Yes, it’s senior brother!”

The young man who had spoken just now also nodded respectfully.

“Today, I will teach you the Ming King body sealing technique. It is an offensive technique that all disciples of our immortal sect below the connate realm must master. It is not bad. Junior brother Liu, find someone to demonstrate it. I will guide them!”

The young man in white put his hands behind his back and said slowly in a heroic manner.

“It’s senior brother Liang!”

Junior brother Liu nodded immediately. He scanned his surroundings and suddenly raised his eyebrows, he pointed at Wang Xian and said, “Wang Dahai said that you are strong. Come Over and accompany me to practice. Let me see your strength too. If you are stronger than Wang Dahai, we can apply for you to join the Ming Wang Immortal Sect!”

Wang Dahai was slightly stunned. When he saw the young man pointing at Wang Xian, he quickly said, “Senior brother Liu, forget about my friend. I’ll do it. I’ll do it!”

“I said let him do it!”

Junior brother Liu ignored Wang Dahai. He pointed at Wang Xian and said again.

Wang Dahai’s expression changed slightly.

“Forget about me. This fellow student, let someone else practice with you!”

Wang Xian shook his head and said with a smile.

“It’s your honor for senior brother Liu to let you practice. Do you really think you’re a big shot?”

At this moment, a burly young man shouted at Wang Xian.

“That’s right. It’s Your Honor for our senior brother Liu to let you practice. I would have been more than happy to choose me, but you actually refused!”

“That’s right, that’s right. Don’t waste our senior brother Liang’s time. I’ll let you practice!”

Some of the new students around shouted at Wang Xian hurriedly.

A famous figure in the school? Wang Xian? Sorry, I don’t know him. What kind of figure is he?

Their senior brother Liu is a xiantian-level powerhouse. It’s your honor to let you practice!

Those students who knew Wang Xian immediately frowned and looked at Wang Xian with a complicated expression.

After all, he was a famous figure from a year ago. The Times had changed.

They didn’t think that a rich senior could be compared to an immortal sect powerhouse with terrifying strength.

“All of you, shut up!”

When Wang Dahai heard the words of the students around him, he shouted with an embarrassed expression.

“Actual combat practice is even better!”

At this moment, senior brother Liang glanced at Wang Xian with a smile on his face and said with a smile.

He wasn’t targeting Wang Xian. Instead, he had the indifference of a powerhouse. He was smiling to see what kind of ability this influential figure from a university in the real world had.

In front of him, who was the Prince Charming among the many girls in Jiang City University, he was nothing!

“That’s right, senior brother Liang Is Right!”

Junior brother Liu revealed a big smile when he heard the young man in white. He turned his head and stared at Wang Xian. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

“I’ll let you have one hand. Watch carefully. Next, I’ll show you the powerful attack technique of our Ming Wang Immortal sect, the Ming Wang Seal!”

Junior brother Liu placed one hand behind his back and stared at Wang Xian with a cold and arrogant expression. Then, he moved.

All the students in the surroundings immediately focused their attention on him.

Junior brother Liu moved.

“Boom!”

However, at this moment, junior brother Liu’s expression changed drastically. His entire body was drenched in sweat. He laid on the ground and panted heavily with a terrified expression.

His entire body went soft and his body trembled slightly. He couldn’t even speak.

Wang Xian shook his head lightly. He really didn’t know what kind of courage he had to dare to challenge an immortal God.

He only revealed a trace of his imposing manner!

“Junior brother Liu, you...”

Senior Brother Liang was stunned when he saw junior brother Liu suddenly falling to the ground. He immediately walked over.

However, at this moment, an imposing manner that made him shudder overcame him.

He felt as though the sky was collapsing.

“Bang!”

Senior Brother Liang was sweating profusely as well. He laid on the ground and looked up at Wang Xian with his eyes wide open. He was filled with fear and disbelief.

“You don’t know what’s good for you!”

Wang Xian said calmly, “Dahai, I’m going to take a look around. Come and find me when you’re Done!”

“Alright!”

Wang Dahai swallowed a mouthful of saliva. When he saw senior brother Liu and senior brother Liang lying on the ground, a teasing look flashed across his eyes. “I’ve already said that my boss is very powerful!”

“Wait!”

At this moment, the cold and arrogant woman standing at the side revealed a look of shock. Her arrogance did not disappear completely. There was only a look of shock. “Which Immortal sect are you from?”.

“I am the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate!”

Wang Xian paused for a moment and said with a smile.

“Dragon King of the Dragon Gate?”

The woman revealed a look of confusion.

When Wang Xian heard the woman mumbling to herself, he felt a little self-deprecating. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Things have changed, but people have changed. He was once the king of the entire jianghu. Now that a year had passed, no one knew about his dragon gate. No one knew about his dragon king.

“Interesting, Hehe!”

Wang Xian couldn’t help but laugh out loud. He walked out with a smile on his face.

“Bastard, Dragon King of the Dragon Gate, what is that?”

After Wang Xian left, the terrifying pressure on senior brother Liang and junior brother Liu disappeared. The two of them looked extremely embarrassed as they growled at Wang Dahai in a low voice.

Wang Dahai pursed his lips. The Dragon King of the Dragon Gate was once a taboo existence. He was the king of the jianghu. Even when he was facing an expert from the nine cauldrons world, he was still able to kill and suppress him!

“The Dragon Gate is a jianghu faction established by my boss. It was very famous when the nine cauldrons world was not around!”

“A faction from the past and a trashy sect actually dared to embarrass us!”

Junior brother Liu clenched his fists with an embarrassed expression.

Senior Brother Liang’s eyes were also flickering and his gaze was cold.

“Senior Brother Liang, his strength is at least at the Dan stage, or even higher!”

The lady at the side reminded him with a sullen face.

“I know!”

Senior Brother Liang’s expression was extremely embarrassed as he walked out directly.

The group of martial arts club students were dumbstruck as their faces revealed a look of shock.

Wang Xian, who was once a popular figure in the school, didn’t even move. He even made senior brother Liu and senior brother Liang lie on the ground and sweat profusely. This was... He was too strong!

How strong was that Wang Xian exactly.

A hint of fear flashed across the eyes of the few new students who spoke just now.
