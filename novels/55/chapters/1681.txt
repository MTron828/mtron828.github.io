Chapter 1682: 1682 life-and-death pill workshop and Holy Item Forging Workshop 2

“Dragon Kingdom in the Palm!”

Wang Xian looked at the twelve half-step wanshou experts in front of him and a cold expression appeared on his face.

He waved his arm and a terrifying Dragon Claw appeared in the sky. It directly attacked the half-step wanshou experts in front of him.

“Fire Feather Phoenix Sun!”

“Fire Feather Phoenix Sun!”

The voices of the Fire Cloud Sparrow elders could be heard from the side.

King versus King, general versus General, Army versus Army!

Fourteen half-step Wanshou Fire Cloud Sparrow Masters immediately released their dharma images and attacked the half-step Wanshou Masters from the two major forces together with Wang Xian’s attack.

“We only have twelve half-step Wanshou Masters!”

“I’ll do it, I’ll block two of them!”

The 12 half-step Wanshou Masters roared with an embarrassed expression. A few of them immediately went up to the Queen of Fire Cloud and a few powerful half-step Wanshou Masters.

One of the half-step Wanshou Masters attacked Wang Xian directly.

“One?”

Wang Xian revealed a mocking expression on his face.

“Roar!”

He raised his head and roared wildly. The terrifying pressure caused the mounts of the experts to tremble slightly.

A divine dragon that was 300 meters long appeared on the battlefield.

At the same time, Wang Xian raised the Dragon Claw that was five to six kilometers in radius and attacked the half-step longevity man.

“What Dharma Idol is this?”

When he saw Wang Xian transform into a terrifying creature, the expression of the elder from the life and Death Elixir Workshop changed drastically.

“Five elements millstone, bind!”

He waved his dragon claws. Following that, the Five Elements Millstone in the sky released streams of grey energy onto the body of the elder from the life and Death Elixir Workshop.

“Not good!”

The expression of the elder changed drastically. The water energy on his body was violent. A water ball with a radius of five kilometers wrapped around him completely.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

However, Wang Xian’s two dragon claws combined to form a radius of about ten kilometers. He grabbed at it forcefully.

“Boom!”

A terrifying force collided and the gigantic water ball collapsed immediately.

The clan elder at the center of the life and Death Elixir Workshop widened his eyes. His eyes were filled with astonishment.

“A half-step to longevity wants to fight with me?”

A hint of disdain flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes. The terrifying dragon claws landed directly on his body.

A figure that was like a fly instantly fell to the ground.

The terrifying force caused the ground to sink into a depth of more than ten meters.

With Wang Xian’s current strength, he would be able to finish off a half-step wanshou within a few moves.

Unless the four of them worked together, they would be able to pin him down.

However, it was impossible to kill him.

Every time he leveled up, he would have the yin-yang Taiji diagram. Among those of the same level, his defense would be invincible.

At the same time, his attacks were also invincible.

“What?”

Seeing how Wang Xian instantly killed an elder who was half a step away from longevity, the expressions of the experts at the peak of the life and Death Elixir Workshop and the holy item forging workshop changed drastically.

They had already lost half of their half-step longevity experts in one move from Mo Sha. Now, another one was killed in an instant.

This was simply a disaster for them.

“Let’s clean up the level 8 and level 9 insightful void martial artists First!”

Wang Xian looked down at the battlefield below.

There were more level 8 and level 9 insightful void martial artists in the two major factions than the fire Lark clan.

“Five elements Millstone, suppress!”

Wang Xian looked at the dozens of level 9 insightful void martial artists gathered together and waved his dragon claws.

The Five Elements Millstone in the sky was emitting a heavy aura. The Five Divine Dragons on it roared and charged down directly.

“Not good!”

“Clan elder, save us!”

Seeing the five elements millstone emitting a destructive aura, the expressions of the dozens of experts at level nine of the Seethrough realm changed drastically. They quickly pleaded for help.

“Stop!”

The clan elders of the two major factions shouted hurriedly.

However, their words sounded like they were joking.

How could Wang Xian stop!

“Let’s join hands to resist!”

30 to 40 experts at level nine of the Void interpretation stage roared loudly. They activated their dharma images and attacked the five elements millstone directly.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

However, the five elements millstone was like a millstone of death. It directly crushed the 30 to 40 experts at level nine of the void interpretation stage.

The powerful destructive attacks caused them to die immediately.

It was not a fight of the same level at all.

“Ahhhh!”

In the middle of the battlefield, continuous screams could be heard.

Ao Yao led the strange demon clan and made their move.

There were 500 strange demons at the level of level six of the void interpretation stage. The fire Lark clan undoubtedly had a huge advantage.

This was especially so for the strange demons who were assassinated on the battlefield. In less than a minute, they had assassinated more than 1,000 experts of the void interpretation stage.

In this battlefield, they were extremely terrifying.

“Stop him!”

Just as Wang Xian was about to make a move, two figures flew toward him.

“Two half-step longevity realm experts?”

The corners of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly as a smile appeared on his face.

He swayed his huge body and waved his dragon claws as he attacked directly.

“Dragon head under the Heavens!”

At the same time, the second Dharma Idol was cast.

The enormous dragon head appeared in the sky.

It was like a mythical creature, imposing and overbearing.

Below, the mounts and demonic beasts of the two forces below the fifth rank of the profound void martial stage lay on the ground, trembling. The suppression of their bloodlines made them unable to use 50% of their strength!

“How is this possible! How strong is this young man?”

A shocked voice came from the mouths of the two half-step Wanshou cultivators. Their eyes were wide open and filled with fear.

“Run! Disciples of the life and Death Pill Workshop, run back to the life and Death Herb Garden!”

“Run! Disciples of the Holy Item Forging workshop, run back to the Weapon Peak!”

At this moment, the sound of nuclear bombs being continuously bombarded came from tens of thousands of meters above the ground.

The voices of the Pill Master and the weapon master suddenly came.

Their voices were filled with panic.

With two against three, they felt a great pressure in less than two minutes.

Reaching the Longevity Realm and comprehending domains.

The longevity realm was a battle of domains.

The medicine master and the weapon master’s domains were about the same size, about eighty kilometers in area.

The Devil Scale’s domain was close to theirs, but Patriarch Feng Yun’s domain was over a hundred kilometers, much more than theirs.

As for Mo Sha’s domain, it was even more terrifying, reaching a radius of about a hundred and fifty kilometers.

It was almost twice as large as theirs.

After a short confrontation, the two men’s faces turned somewhat pale. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

They were certain that in five minutes at most, the two of them would die in the siege of the three men.

This made them have no choice but to give the order to flee for their lives!

“What?”

“Flee, we aren’t their match!”

“Flee immediately!”

The orders of the weapon master and the medicine master completely caused all the disciples of the two large factions to lose their fighting spirit.

They all turned around, wanting to flee back on the path they had taken.

At this moment, only those who could escape would be able to survive.

Their fighting spirit had completely disappeared.

“The two of you still want to flee, stay here for me!”

Feng Yun’s dignified voice sounded from the sky as she raised the Phoenix staff in her hand.

An enormous fire Phoenix appeared in the sky and attacked the weapon master.
