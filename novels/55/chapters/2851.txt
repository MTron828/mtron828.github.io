2852 All 2852 were in his hands

“The second one. According to the information from the incipient holy wings, there are a total of 49 holy feathers!”

Wang Xian mumbled.

There were still 47 more to go. He moved his body and continued flying forward.

“The third one!”

“The fourth one!”

!!

“The fifth one!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up as he walked deeper in. Other than these holy feathers, there were also a large number of wind jades.

Wang Xian had already discovered more than 20 wind jades in the form of birds.

These wind jades in the form of birds were treasures that were comparable to a first level celestial thearch.

To wind attribute cultivators, they were a huge treasure trove!

“These wind jades can be directly absorbed by the Wind God Dragons.”

Wang Xian mumbled as his eyes sparkled.

With all these wind jades in hand, the nine wind god Dragons of the Dragon Palace could break through to the celestial thearch level.

The Wind Divine Dragons were the nine flood dragons.

These nine flood dragons had been cultivating in seclusion in the Dragon Palace and hadn’t participated in the War of the Dragon Palace for a very, very long time.

In the past, the nine flood dragons were used to pull the dragon chairs, but now they were rarely allowed to appear.

The main reason was that they had evolved from flood dragons to true divine dragons, the wind divine dragons.

In this resplendent starry sky, there was detailed information about the divine dragons.

Once the Wind Divine Dragon appeared, he would definitely be recognized.

What would happen if a weak divine dragon appeared in the Resplendent Starry Sky?

He would be captured by the divine emperor powerhouses. Some of them might even want to obtain the bloodline of the Divine Dragon.

Therefore, Wang Xian had never allowed the nine wind divine dragons to participate in the Dragon Palace battlefield.

By then, the nine divine wind dragons would be able to appear directly.

“If I can get a few dozens of wind jade, the divine wind dragons will definitely be able to raise their combat strength to the level of a divine emperor.”

Wang Xian smiled and continued flying forward.

He found the holy feathers one by one. In just half an hour, Wang Xian had already found 23 of them.

“I can’t continue searching anymore!”

At this moment, Wang Xian paused and looked behind him.

He narrowed his eyes slightly and felt waves of terrifying power.

There were already divine emperors descending.

Furthermore, the attack power of the trees at the entrance had been reduced!

He moved and returned quickly.

Wang Xian’s greatest advantage here was that the surrounding trees would not attack him.

As for the others, even if they were god-emperor powerhouses, they would be attacked by the trees.

Even if the attack power of the windless sun trees was greatly reduced, the densely packed trees could still cause them great trouble.

Otherwise, the wind jade here would have been obtained by the powerhouses long ago.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

“WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH!”

“HMPH, these trees are really annoying. Even the windless sun has the attack power of a level nine immortal god King!”

When Wang Xian was flying outside, the sounds of battle and cold snorts could be heard.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly.

The offensive power of the trees at the entrance had already been reduced to level nine immortal king. However, under the dense attack of the trees, the immortal king powerhouses had to take it seriously.

After all, this was equivalent to thousands of level nine immortal king powerhouses attacking at the same time!

Wang Xian increased his speed and arrived in front of him quickly.

“It’s time to harvest!”

His eyes were filled with excitement as he flew towards a tree.

There was a wind jade on it.

With a wave of his arm, he took the wind jade away.

“Sou Sou Sou!”

At the next moment, this tree unleashed an attack. Countless leaves flew towards Wang Xian.

However, Wang Xian only touched this tree. The surrounding trees did not attack him.

This was equivalent to an expert at level nine of the godly monarch realm attacking Wang Xian.

It was just a tickle!

His body moved and he immediately flew forward. His gaze locked onto the wind jade on the trees and he quickly took it away.

“The second Holy Feather!”

Very soon, Wang Xian arrived at the position of the second holy feather. He waved his arm and easily took it away.

The attack from the tree was transmitted instantly. A terrifying force swept over.

Wang Xian’s eyes narrowed slightly. This attack power had already reached the first level of celestial thearch.

However, it was considered relatively weak among the first level of celestial thearch.

“Boom!”

Wang Xian took the attack head-on. His body flew backward for a few thousand meters. After stabilizing his body, he continued flying forward with a calm expression.

Each of the Wind Jade, peak level immortal king, and first level celestial thearch were easily taken by him.

And one by one, the holy feathers were quickly taken by him.

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with excitement.

He had gained a lot this time.

With so many treasures, the Dragon Palace would be able to improve greatly.

At least nine wind divine dragons would be able to improve their combat strength to emperor God Level 1, or perhaps even more.

His eyes were sparkling as he harvested crazily.

“What’s going on? Why is there not a single wind jade in the Windless Forest Valley?”

At the same time, at the entrance of the windless forest valley, many experts who were emitting a terrifying aura were looking around with embarrassed expressions.

There were a total of more than ten vast figures. Their bodies were shrouded in light, and many branches and leaves fell around them. They were blocked by a powerful defense.

More than ten figures frowned slightly as they looked around with unsightly expressions.

In the Windless Forest Valley, at other times, tier one or even tier two divine emperors did not dare to rashly enter this place.

Only within the windless day would they step into this place.

To them, the windless day was the best time for them to obtain a powerful wind jade. If they were lucky, they would be able to obtain a considerable income for the divine emperors.

However, they did not find a single wind jade when they entered this place.

This made them extremely bewildered.

Logically speaking, since no one had entered the windless forest valley for 10,000 years, there would definitely be many wind jade.

“The attack power of the trees here has just decreased. We are the first batch of people to enter. Could it be that there were experts who came here before the windless day?”

Some experts revealed a surprised expression and felt slightly ugly.

The windless day was a day of harvest for them. Now that there was no wind jade, it made them feel unhappy.

“Let’s continue to go in and take a look!”

The eyes of the god Emperors flickered as they continued to go deeper.

However, the closer they were to the inner part of the windless forest valley, the denser the trees were and the stronger their attack power was.

The faster they advanced, the slower they were.

However, after advancing for dozens of minutes, they still did not find any wind jade. This made their expressions become more and more awkward.

What was the situation with the windless days this time?

What had happened in the windless forest?

The God emperors were slightly unwilling and could only brace themselves to continue advancing.

Each time there was no wind, although they could not reach the deepest part, they could still move forward by billions of kilometers.

However, what the celestial thearchs did not know was that billions of kilometers ahead of them, a person was crazily harvesting wind jade and sacred feathers!
