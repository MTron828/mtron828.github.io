Chapter 651: The Anomaly of Mt. Taibai

Translator: Larbrestudio

“I heard something strange has happened to Mt. Taibai in China. The entire mountain range is just like an immortal region. White-colored spiritual energy shrouded the entire mountain range and the place is cordoned off right now!”

“Really? So magical?”

“I heard it from a friend of mine from China. He said something huge has happened there!”

“Although the entire region of China is behind the times, it had its glory days in the past and has many ancient ruins. Perhaps someone has discovered one of them. Should we head over to take a look?”

“I think we can forget about it. I heard that this incident has drawn the attention of various international forces in Asia. The Creepy Snake of Japan has already headed there.”

Glacier Coral Island. Xiao Yu, Lan Qingyue and the other three girls sat in a restaurant by the sea. Several young men walked past them and were discussing softly.

“Ruins?”

Xiao Yu and the girls exchanged glances before turning to the group of young men with curiosity.

The four young men sat beside them with a tinge of arrogance and pride. They leaned back against their chairs and continued discussing casually.

“Hi, handsome! I overheard you saying that something strange has happened to Mt. Taibai of China. Could you elaborate in detail?”

Xiao Yu looked to one of the young men and asked this with a smile.

Huh?

When the four young men heard Xiao Yu, they were taken aback slightly. His eyes beamed with excitement the moment he turned around as he answered, “Oh? Hey, pretty, are you from China?” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Yeah. Can you elaborate on the matter in detail?” Xiao Yu asked with a smile.

“You girls haven’t heard about it? Dense spiritual energy has descended on Mt. Taibai of China. Do you girls know about spiritual energy? Are you girls martial artists?”

A handsome young man smiled and observed the girls as he replied with a smile.

“I don’t know. What happened after that?” Xiao Yu asked curiously.

“Spiritual energy flowed down like water and into the mountain range. Several tens of kilometers around the mountain range now resemble an immortal region. If an ordinary person were to live in that area, that insane level of spiritual energy would allow one to become a martial artist easily!”

As the young man spoke, he gestured to the waitress by the side and said, “Please get these beautiful girls a glass of red wine each!”

“That’s not necessary!”

Xiao Yu shook her head and thanked him.

“Sisters-in-law, do you all think that’s because the Nine Cauldron Worlds are starting to descend into the real world?” Xiao Yu asked curiously.

“That’s a possibility. When Xiao Xian gets back, let’s tell him about it!”

The expressions on Lan Qingyue and the girls instantly turned serious.

They had heard from Wang Xian how exceptionally powerful the Nine Cauldron Worlds were. There were several Immortal Realm experts and over a hundred Budding Realm experts.

If the Nine Cauldron Worlds were to descend into the real world, the rules of the Underworld would undergo huge changes.

“Yeah! We’ve got to increase our strength as soon as possible. Otherwise, we might be in real danger in the future. We can’t be dragging Xiao Xian down again!” Sun Lingxiu chuckled.

“Sister-in-law Ling Xiu, the cultivation speed of you three is much faster than me and my master. Moreover, you look so much better than us. Our forms are simply too ugly!” Xiao Yu pouted.

Recalling her image as the Skeletal Dragon, she couldn’t cheer herself up.

“Haha! Xiao Yu, are you thinking of getting a boyfriend now? Why are you so concerned about your appearance suddenly?”

“Sister-in-law, what are you saying!”

The girls joked around. Every action of theirs released a charm that made the four young men sitting beside them swallow their saliva.

“Hey, pretties, do you mind if we sit by you?”

A young man couldn’t hold back and stood up. He held a glass of red wine in his hand and asked them softly.

“We mind. Sorry!”

Adjaya looked across them and answered plainly.

“Huh? Hey, pretties, aren’t you going to show us some face?”

That young man’s expression stiffened and he didn’t stop walking over. With a gentle smile, he sat on a seat beside the girls.

Bam!

The moment he sat down, the chair fell back onto the ground. The young man was shocked. Just as he wanted to stand up, he suddenly felt a force weighing down on him.

His body was pressed into the ground directly. The huge commotion drew the attention from the surrounding crowd.

“Hehe! We have already told you that we mind and yet you choose to walk over!”

Xiao Yu looked at him with mocking eyes while wearing a radiant smile.

“Xiao Xian is here. Let’s go!”

At this moment, Lan Qingyue saw a message on her phone and said this to Xiao Yu and the girls.

“Let’s go!”

Xiao Yu and the girls smiled and stood up.

“You girls must be too eager to die!”

Fires of fury were smoldering in the eyes of that young man as he stood up immediately.

Boom!

However, a terrifying aura swept across his body at this instant.

That young man was astonished as he slumped onto the floor in fear.

The other three young men were equally shocked by what they witnessed.

“Wow, what a huge luxury yacht!”

Xiao Yu and the girls walked towards the giant yacht, which stopped by the beach, with excitement. They exclaimed with ecstasy!

“It’s just a yacht! Look at how happy you are!”

Xiao Xian smiled at Xiao Yu and continued, “How was it? Have you girls enjoyed yourselves over the last few days?”

“Pretty good!”

The five girls continued observing the huge luxurious yacht inquisitively.

The luxurious yacht was initially built for leisure. There were various kinds of entertainment on it and it had several luxurious rooms on the second level.

It was several dozen times better than the one that they had taken to this place.

“Let’s head back and see if Shuqing has gotten better!” Wang Xian said to them.

“Oh yeah, Xiao Xian. We heard something a while ago. You can check it out on the Underworld website!”

Lan Qingyue told Wang Xian what they had heard about the incident.

Wang Xian’s expression turned a little serious as he retrieved his phone and entered the Underworld website.

The current Underworld website was a lot quieter than in the past as the entire Underworld had become more peaceful.

At this moment, there was almost no longer any killings in the Underworld. Everyone was just growing silently.

However, Mt. Taibai had experienced some anomaly just a few days ago. Dense spiritual energy flowed down the sky and into the mountain range as though it was water.

This matter had instantly stirred up the entire Underworld. All the martial artists swarmed towards Mt. Taibai frantically.

“This is crazy! Too crazy! I have advanced two levels in a single day!”

“The spiritual energy around here is just like flowing water. Staying within it can cleanse one’s meridians and channels. A while ago, a monkey even grew into a huge five-meter ape. This is too shocking!”

“Let me tell everyone a piece of bad news. There are martial artists from overseas who have headed there. These forces are likely beyond what we can handle!”

Wang Xian was astonished as he went through these threads.

“The Nine Cauldron Worlds have descended into the real world? However, this shouldn’t be happening. The spiritual energy within the Nine Cauldron Worlds isn’t even this horrifying. What’s happening?”

Wang Xian immediately made a call to the dragonians responsible for the Omniscient Group and requested that they send him all the information on that place!

This is likely to be still related to the Nine Cauldron Worlds!
