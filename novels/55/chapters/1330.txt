Chapter 1331: 1332, above the fifth level of the void severing stage

“Weng Weng Weng Weng!”

In the sky above the island, within a radius of 10 kilometers, a grey energy that covered an area of 2 kilometers pushed forward horizontally.

This grey energy was like the long river of history, destroying everything in front of it.

The first to bear the brunt was sect master Han Zong. In this long river of history, his body quickly lost its vitality.

His corpse floated unconsciously in the long river.

The power of the Gray River rushed towards Bing Hanzi.

At this moment, Bing Hanzi’s body was covered in ten-meter-tall ice armor.

Seeing the sect master of Frost sect’s vitality instantly disappear in the long river, his eyes were filled with a solemn expression.

“Crack Crack Crack!”

“Ice Armor God!”

With a light shout, the ice armor on Bing Hanzi’s body enlarged once more, and his dharma idol was unleashed.

Layers of dazzling blue ice armor covered the ice armor God, and it was thirty meters long.

Standing in the center, Bing Hanzi waved his skinny arm, and the ice armor God outside did the same thing, facing the Gray River of annihilation.

Crack! Crack! Crack

A trembling sound was heard continuously. The grayish energy quickly washed away the god of ice armor on his body.

“My... My... My God, that is...”

“What kind of creature is that? This... Nameless Sword Demon? Wang Xian? A terrifying creature?”

“Isn’t... isn’t that the terrifying creature in the main hall? At that time, this terrifying creature swallowed the demon-tailed Viper at the fourth level of the void interpretation stage. My God, this creature is actually Wang Xian!”

“The sect leader of the Frost sect was killed in an instant. He fought against the founder of the Frost sect, Bing Hanzi, who was at level 5 of the Void interpretation stage. What is his identity?”

A proud son of heaven!

A supreme son of heaven!

The nameless sword demon!

The terrifying creature in the main hall!

One by one, the names that everyone looked forward to and even feared were all gathered on one person.

Looking at the 50-meter-tall creature, everyone was shocked.

The appearance of frigidsect, the terrifying strength of the eighth prince, and the appearance of Bing Han Zi had already shocked everyone.

Although in the end, he was suppressed by one person with multiple identities.

Looking at the 50-meter-tall creature and the 20-meter-tall Bing Han Zi floating in the sky, everyone’s emotions couldn’t be any higher!

They were shocked to the extreme. Now, everyone was staring at the sky silently.

Long Xiaotian, Long Xiaotian’s mother, and even his mother’s clansmen looked at Wang Xian who was dominating the world with excitement on their faces.

This time, even if long Xiaotian could not obtain the position of crown prince, no one would dare to provoke him in the Radiant Dragon Empire in the future. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

After all, he had such a terrifying brother.

If not for the appearance of Wang Xian, with the eighth Prince’s hatred towards him, Long Xiaotian would definitely not be having an easy time.

The entire Hua clan would also suffer a huge blow.

“What? Sect Master Han Quan, sect master Han Quan actually...”

At this moment, the eighth Prince looked up at Wang Xian in the sky in a daze. Looking at the corpse of Sect Master Han, his eyes widened and were filled with shock.

A fourth level void interpretation expert was killed in an instant just like that?

His body was trembling and his eyes were slightly red.

“Old Thing, I hope you won’t run away from me!”

Wang Xian swayed his body and looked at Bing Hanzi, who was resisting the destructive energy of the five elements millstone. His dragon eyes stared at him coldly.

Earlier, Bing Hanzi had arrogantly said that Wang Xian couldn’t escape.

Now, he would return the words.

With his current strength, the five elements millstone, coupled with his divine dragon body, it would be easy for him to fight someone five levels above him.

After he finished speaking, he moved his body and attacked Bing Hanzi directly.

“No matter what kind of creature you are, I will definitely kill you today!”

Bing Hanzi stood in the middle of the ice armor God. He stared at Wang Xian with an extremely cold gaze.

“Dharma Idol, God of Ice Wings!”

“Dharma Idol, God of Ice Sword!”

He roared twice consecutively and two wings that were 50 to 60 meters long appeared behind him.

In addition, an ice sword that was 60 to 70 meters long appeared in his hand.

Both the wings and the huge sword emitted a terrifying blue luster. It looked extremely terrifying.

“Slash!”

He flapped his wings slightly and his body drew a ray of blue light. In an instant, he appeared in front of Wang Xian.

The huge sword that was 60 to 70 meters long slashed directly at Wang Xian’s body.

“Dragon’s Tail!”

Wang Xian’s expression didn’t change. The huge dragon’s tail flickered with blazing flames as it swept directly at the huge sword.

“Bang!”

The sound of metal colliding could be heard. Wang Xian’s body flew backward for more than 1,000 meters.

“Die!”

The figure of Bing Hanzi, who had used three divine abilities consecutively, did not change at all. He flapped his wings again and appeared beside Wang Xian in a flash.

He held his huge sword with both hands and slashed at Wang Xian directly.

“Five Elements Millstone, the ultimate of Earth!”

Wang Xian looked at Bing Hanzi, who appeared beside him in an instant. His gaze focused. The Five Elements Millstone in the sky spun and collided directly with Bing Hanzi.

The Five Elements Millstone could destroy, heal, trap, and defend.

Similarly, the five elements could combine to bring one attribute to the extreme.

The five elements revolved, the extreme of earth!

“Boom!”

The Five Elements Millstone, which was emitting dust aura, was like a planet as it charged straight at the ice sword God!

A terrifying loud sound rang out and shook the entire space.

This was completely a contest of strength.

“Boom, Boom, Boom!”

Bing Hanzi held the ice sword God in his hand as he attacked the five elements millstone.

One attack after another landed on the millstone, and the five elements millstone was as stable as Mount Tai.

Streams of air currents rushed out in all directions.

Those who were weaker had already started to defend, and their faces were filled with fear as they looked up at the battle in the sky.

“Hiss, what a terrifying collision!”

Everyone stared at them vigilantly, afraid that an aftershock would land on them.

With the aftershock from the battle between Wang Xian and Bing Hanzi, even an expert at the first level of the Seethrough realm would be able to kill him directly.

“Ice Wings, Pierce!”

After slashing the five elements grindstone a few hundred times in a row, not only did his terrifying defense fail to send him flying, but his body was also forced to retreat under the extreme pressure of the Earth.

Bing Hanzi let out a loud roar. The gigantic ice winged god aimed at the five elements millstone. Numerous sharp ice spikes that were ten meters long pierced straight at it.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The continuous sounds of explosions rang out. The entire five elements millstone was trembling slowly.

“It’s about time!”

“Roar!”

Sensing Bing Hanzi’s terrifying attacks, Wang Xian let out a loud roar.

With a dragon’s roar, the five elements millstone spun slowly. It became smaller and smaller until it became two meters in size. It entered Wang Xian’s stomach directly.

“Kill!”

He let out a low roar that was filled with endless killing intent. It could be seen with the naked eye that the dragon scales on his body and the five divine dragon silhouettes of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth were swimming back and forth.

After the five elements millstone fused into his body, Wang Xian moved his dragon tail which contained violent energy. He charged directly at Bing Hanzi.
