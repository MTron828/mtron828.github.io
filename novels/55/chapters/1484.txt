Chapter 1485: No one dared to reject me here

“No one dares to reject me here!”

A cold voice sounded. He Feng stood there and stared at Wang Xian with a cold gaze.

“Hiss, Young Master He Feng? What’s going on?”

“What are young master he Feng and Princess Yaoyao doing here?”

“It seems like Princess Yaoyao wants something, but the others don’t agree!”

“There are still people who dare to disagree in the He clan’s forest. This... he still wants to hang around here?”

Some people in the surrounding area heard he Feng’s words and sucked in a cold breath. They looked over in shock.

Everyone clearly knew what he feng represented in the He clan’s forest.

This was the core disciple of the He clan’s current generation. Although he wasn’t as famous as young master he yuan, he couldn’t be underestimated. He was definitely the leader of this generation’s he clan.

In this place, no one dared to reject he feng.

Unless, they did not want to stay here anymore.

Some people in the surroundings looked over. Lin Yaoyao frowned slightly when she saw how domineering he feng was.

However, she did not stop him. She was also a little displeased with Wang Xian’s cold rejection.

“This... this...”

When Dumu Dazhuang heard he Feng’s words, he wiped the cold sweat off his forehead and ran to Wang Xian’s side hurriedly.

“Big Brother, big master, he Feng, the young master of the He clan. This is their territory!”

Dui Dazhuang reminded Wang Xian anxiously.

“Young Master of the He clan, are you preparing to forcefully buy and sell?”

Wang Xian looked at the anxious Dui Dazhuang, shook his head, and said faintly.

“HMM?”

When he feng heard what Wang Xian said, his face darkened and a hint of killing intent flashed in his eyes.

“It seems that you are not giving me face, he feng?”

He Feng’s face was gloomy. His gaze was filled with coldness as he stared at Wang Xian.

Wang Xian ignored him. He brewed a cup of tea unhurriedly and started to taste it. He looked at the few sculptures in his hands.

The atmosphere instantly froze.

Cold Sweat started to form on Dui Mu Dazhuang’s forehead. He wiped his face anxiously.

He Feng’s expression slowly turned ugly.

He was the dignified young master of the He clan, and when he questioned him, this fellow actually leisurely poured a cup of tea and drank it.

What the F * ck...

It was simply a silent humiliation!

This made he Feng’s expression change in embarrassment.

It was impossible to make a move. As a famous top-tier force in the vast region, the He clan had its own rules.

If the young master of the He clan were to use his strength to bully ordinary people, what would outsiders think?

In this place, even if he was the young master of the He clan, he could not bully the weak in public, let alone kill people!

Lin Yaoyao and the girls behind her were also stunned when they saw this scene.

This fellow did not even give the young master of the He clan any face.

This...

“Good, very good. I will remember this matter!”

He Feng smiled sinisterly. He took a deep look at Wang Xian and said, “I hope you don’t regret it!”

As he spoke, he turned around and left with an embarrassed expression.

When the crowd heard he Feng’s threat, their pupils constricted slightly. They looked at Wang Xian sympathetically.

“This kid really has a backbone. However, offending young master he Feng is simply courting death!”

Some people thought to themselves as they silently watched he feng leave in anger. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“HMPH!”

Lin Yaoyao saw that Wang Xian didn’t even care about he feng. She snorted in surprise and left as well.

Yuan Xun er and the rest followed behind with a face full of confusion.

“It’s over, it’s over. Brother Wang Xian, you’re done for. It’s possible that even I’m done for!”

Seeing he feng leave with a face full of anger, Dui Dazhuang said anxiously as he paced around the shop.

“Brother Wang Xian, I think you’d better run away quickly. Otherwise, you’re really done for!”

“He Feng Won’t deal with you in public, but it’s too easy to deal with you in secret. You’d better run away quickly!”

As he spoke, he sat opposite Wang Xian and said.

“It’s alright, there’s no need to be anxious!”

Wang Xian saw him pacing around anxiously and shook his head.

“How can I not be in a rush...”

“It’s getting late. Let’s go back and rest!”

Wang Xian stood up and walked out without a care in the world.

“Brother Wang Xian, you...”

Dumu Dazhuang looked at Wang Xian with a face full of astonishment and helplessness.

He had finally witnessed Wang Xian’s true personality.

Dumu Dazhuang hurriedly packed his things and followed behind Wang Xian.

He kept on nagging along the way.

“Help me check the residence of that fellow!”

At a spot not far away from the holy tree, he feng walked in with a gloomy face.

He spoke to the two young men behind him coldly.

“Young master he, do you want us to get rid of him directly?”

The two young men behind him said with murderous intent in their eyes.

“What do you think?”

He Feng glanced at the two of them indifferently. “I’ve said it before. No one dares to refuse me here. The result of refusing is death!”

The cold voice startled the two young men.

They immediately nodded. “Young master he, don’t worry. We know what to do. But guard there...”

“It’s fine. Just say what I want you to do!”

He Feng didn’t seem to mind at all and directly said, “I’ll leave this matter to you. I want to enter the holy tree. When my seventh brother’s birthday comes, report back to me!”

As he spoke, he directly walked into a door that seemed to be wrapped with life and entered.

The two young men stopped there. When they saw he Feng’s back disappear, they looked at each other.

“Ask the two experts who have pledged allegiance to young master he to make a move!”

“This is the first time I’ve seen such a suicidal fellow. If he were to anger young master he, he would be courting death. If young master he wanted to kill him, it would be as easy as squashing an ant to death!”

“There will always be ants courting death. What can we do? After today, he feng won’t be able to remember this ant at all!”

As the two spoke, they walked out.

The He clan had absolute control over the entire he clan’s forest.

If the He clan wanted to find a person here, they would be able to do so in less than an hour.

When the sky darkened, countless fireflies lit up the entire world in the He clan’s forest.

The night in the He clan’s forest was like a dream-like fairytale world.

The place where Wang Xian lived was a very high-end place in the He clan’s forest.

The daily rent was 100,000 middle-grade spirit stones.

The house was situated 300 meters in the air. The house was built in the middle of two trees. It was extremely beautiful.

Dui Dazhuang was also living alone in his house. He could be considered to be living in this luxurious room under the influence of Wang Xian.

“Young master he Feng is magnanimous. He won’t take revenge!”

“He will take revenge!”

“He won’t take revenge!”

...

In the room of one-tree Dazhuang, he was holding a flower in his hand. He plucked the petals one by one while muttering to himself.

Growing up in a decent family, he knew the breadth of mind of some young masters. If someone offended him, he would secretly deal with him even if he couldn’t make a move on the spot.

He plucked the petals one by one.

“He will take revenge!”

“HMM, that’s it? No, no, I must have said something wrong. I Won’t take revenge, I Won’t take revenge!”

In the house, his mouth was trembling.

It was late at night. Not far away, four figures were looking in his direction.
