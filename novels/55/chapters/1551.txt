Chapter 1552: 1552 below the soul of darkness

The Black Screen Garden was a corner of the medicinal garden, but even if it was just a corner, its area was still extremely terrifying.

At least a hundred thousand people had entered, and they had only flown for half an hour. There were no longer any human figures around them, so one could imagine how vast the entire space was!

Along the way, they encountered spiritual herbs below the profound void tier, but the people of the Iceheart dynasty did not pluck them.

Their target was obviously the insightful void tier spiritual herbs.

“Let’s fly for another half an hour. There are more insightful void tier spiritual herbs there!”

An elder next to Ling Jian ‘er shouted loudly.

Obviously, the Bingxin dynasty had made a lot of preparations for this black screen garden.

They flew at a high speed again.

“There’s a powerful fluctuation of the power of darkness ahead. It’s a insightful void tier spiritual herb. Quick! Quick!”

The people of the ice heart empire suddenly sensed the huge fluctuation coming from ahead, and they looked excited.

“It’s a dark lychee. There are more than ten dark lychees on it. Haha!”

They flew over. Bing Jing Huan stared at the area ahead and laughed crazily.

At this moment, they were surrounded by endless black trees. In front of them, a ten-meter-tall tree was rooted there.

The tree was very small and was very eye-catching in this space. However, it was emitting a strong dark energy.

On the black trees here, there were more than ten dark lychee hanging on them. They were emitting a life force and a pure dark energy.

“A spiritual fruit of the second level of the void interpretation realm. There are more than ten of them on one tree. This... isn’t this black curtain garden too crazy?”

Wang Xian stared at the dark lychee spirit fruit in shock.

No wonder so many people risked their lives to enter the black curtain garden after it was opened.

All the factions had even gathered here.

“Be careful. The spirit tree at the second level of the Void interpretation realm is definitely protected by the soul of Darkness!”

At this moment, an elder from the Iceheart Empire reminded him. He looked around carefully and was filled with vigilance.

“Over there!”

“This is different from the soul of darkness that invaded Yin Haoyan’s body!”

Wang Xian, who was hiding at the back, fixed his gaze on a tree 100 meters away from the dark lychee. His eyes were sparkling.

It was a dark creature that was like a venomous snake. It didn’t have a body of flesh and blood. It was completely formed from pure dark energy.

“Kill it over there. Be careful. Don’t let it enter your body. Otherwise, you will die!”

An elder also noticed the soul of darkness hidden in the tree and shouted immediately.

“Leave it to the two of us!”

The two middle-aged men moved and attacked the soul of darkness directly.

The two of them were at level three of the void interpretation stage. It was easy for them to fight against a level two void interpretation stage soul of darkness.

Under their attacks, the Soul of darkness was instantly divided into more than ten sections.

Wang Xian realized that the soul of darkness was weakened after being divided into sections. After being divided into more than ten sections, it completely turned into clusters of dark energy.

This dark energy slowly dissipated in the surrounding air.

“Haha, Good Harvest. Let’s go. Although it’s just the beginning, we still have to hurry!”

Bing Jinghuan laughed out loud and kept all the dark lychees. The group continued to fly into the distance.

“To be able to obtain more than a dozen spiritual fruits of the second level of the void interpretation so easily, no wonder so many experts are attracted to this vast area!”

Wang Xian followed behind them. He stared at the dark lychee spiritual tree and moved his arm.

“Huh?”

However, just as he was about to put it into his storage spiritual bag, he realized that this dark lychee spiritual tree was trapped here by a special force.

Even he couldn’t take it away.

No wonder they didn’t take this spiritual tree away

Wang Xian thought to himself.

Suddenly, his mind stirred as he looked at the soul of darkness that had been chopped into more than ten pieces and was slowly dissipating.

The Soul of Darkness is similar to the dragon bead. Could I allow the dragon bead of darkness to devour and upgrade it

Wang Xian had a thought. He opened his mouth and a dragon bead of darkness flew out from his mouth.

The dragon bead turned into a one-meter-sized dark demon dragon and started to devour the dark energy that had not completely dissipated.

“It’s really possible! The dark dragon bead can increase the level of the dragon bead by devouring the Soul of Darkness!”

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up.

He was currently lacking items that could increase the level of the dragon bead. Now that the soul of darkness could increase the level of the dark dragon bead, he could not give up on this opportunity.

The only drawback was that the Dark Dragon Pearl would be upgraded. If the Light Dragon Pearl was not upgraded, the balance between light and darkness would be broken again.

However, there was nothing he could do about it!

Now that he could hold on to his heart, it would not be a big problem even if the light and darkness were out of balance.

He would just need to spend some time to adjust himself.

Wang Xian’s figure moved and flew into the sky. Looking at Ling Jian ‘er in front of him, he frowned slightly.

“This is simply a land of treasures. Spiritual herbs and the soul of darkness. I Can’t stay by Ling Jian ‘ER’s side all the time!”

Wang Xian frowned slightly. With a move of his arm, a statue appeared in his hand.

The statue was Wang Xian himself. He opened his mouth and the Bright Dragon Pearl flew out from within and attached itself to the statue.

Buzz

A body that was emitting a faint light appeared in front of Wang Xian.

The light body was exactly the same as him. It was as if it had a life of its own.

“Let the Light Dragon Pearl Protect Ling Jian ‘ER. I will be able to sense danger if I encounter it. Even if I don’t have to control it by myself, the Light Dragon Pearl will be able to unleash the strength of a sixth-level void interpretation. It is enough to protect Ling Jian ‘er!”

Wang Xian transmitted a message to the light dragon pearl, instructing it to protect Ling Jian ‘ER in the dark.

Following that, Wang Xian flew towards the front left.

“Next, I have to devour the soul of darkness crazily to obtain the spiritual herb!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flashed with excitement. He opened his fiery dragon eyes and scanned his surroundings.

“Eh? My vision is greatly restricted. However, it’s still easy for me to scan a radius of five kilometers!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and dashed forward.

With his current strength, his speed was about ten times faster than Ling Jian ‘er and the rest. In a flash, he was already four to five thousand meters away.

“There are spiritual herbs over there. It seems to be an earth attribute spiritual herb!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he stared in a certain direction and flew straight ahead.

“The return map flower of the first level of the void interpretation stage. A protection of the Soul of darkness of the first level of the Void Interpretation Stage!”

Wang Xian’s figure flickered as the Dark Dragon Pearl devoured the soul of darkness and took the spiritual herbs away.

“Let’s keep going deeper!”

Wang Xian did not hesitate and flew forward quickly.

“A spiritual tree of the second level of the void interpretation stage. A Soul of darkness of the second level of the Void Interpretation Stage!”

Not long after, another spiritual tree appeared in Wang Xian’s line of sight. His figure flickered and in less than ten seconds, the soul of darkness devoured and the spiritual fruit was taken away!

“Haha, this is practically my own backyard!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled with excitement as he continued flying forward.

Along the way, he kept the spirit herbs and spirit trees in his bag. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The Dark Dragon Bead was also improving rapidly.
