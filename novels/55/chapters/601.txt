Chapter 602: Shocking Yong Chang City (1)

Boom!

The energy of the water shockwave reached the old man in an instant and the terrified expert from Immortal Slaying Sect emitted a golden glow.

However, the glow was just like candlelight. In the face of the deluge, it was extinguished directly.

The corpse of the old man sank gradually towards the ground.

When the water shockwave fell on the old man, he instantly lost all signs of life.

“This... Be careful. Leave this region of water now! Quick!”

When an expert from Da Hong Immortal Sect saw the expert from Immortal Slaying Sect being killed instantly, he was terrified.

He shouted and retreated back immediately.

“Retreat!”

Without needing his reminder, the rest retreated back solemnly upon witnessing how terrifying the water region was.

“Can you escape?”

A cold and ruthless light flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes as he waved his palm.

Boom!

The deluge behind him flooded towards the group with devastating might.

The fourteen people were terrified to realize they couldn’t escape from the water region.

“Unity of Sword and Human!”

A golden ray of light shot out from the eyes of an expert from Immortal Slaying Sect. The next instant, it was as though he had turned into a sword as he charged forward.

Boom!

Wang Xian stood within the water region and waved his arm sharply.

Boom!

Once again, the unstoppable water shockwave crashed towards the expert from the Immortal Slaying Sect.

“No!”

That expert growled loudly and the longsword in his hand glowed with blinding golden rays.

However, the golden rays shattered like glass as they were crushed instantly.

Ka ka!

Terrifying water shockwaves fell on him and sounds of bones cracking reverberated instantly. Soon after, his body fell towards the ground.

“Grand Waterfall Water Shockwave! This is Great Waterfall Water Shockwave!”

An expert from Da Hong Immortal Sect screamed in horror.

“What’s the Great Waterfall Water Shockwave?”

Beside him, an old man raging in scorching flames could feel cold perspiration breaking out on his forehead. Within the water region, his strength was restricted by at least twenty to thirty percent.

“Immortal-class battle technique, Great Waterfall Water Shockwave!” the old man replied with disbelief.

“What? This cannot be possible!”

“No... NO! He can’t be an Immortal Realm existence. I don’t believe this!”

The words of the old man incited frenzy among the group. They stared in disbelief at Wang Xian who stood in the water region.

How can a young man like him be an Immortal?

We are assassinating an Immortal? F*ck...

“Since you guys dare to try to assassinate me, all of you can die now!”

“Great Waterfall Water Shockwave!”

Wang Xian shouted and the water dragon energy within him was depleted at a frightening pace.

The surrounding water region was completely within his control. He maneuvered both of his arms.

Terrifying water shockwaves charged towards the group as though it was a devastating water dragon.

At almost the speed of Instant Shift, the devastating water shockwave penetrated through the bodies of various Budding Realm experts.

“NO! Get away from me!”

“Flames of Yong Chang!” an old man shouted, and horrifying energy burst out from his body towards the Great Waterfall Water Shockwave.

However, the attempt was futile.

The entire water region seemed to be a world of its own. If the world was attacking you and wanted you dead, there would only be a single outcome.

They had no ability to withstand at all.

As the water shockwave swept across, corpse after corpse fell to the ground.

Wang Xian heaved a sigh and the surrounding water dissipated.

He wiped away the perspiration on his forehead and felt entirely depleted.

“In just a little more than two minutes, I have almost exhausted all the energy in my body! However, this water shockwave is truly frightening. Fifteen Budding Realm experts couldn’t put up any resistance at all!”

Wang Xian moved his hands and weapons flew towards him. Among which, there were three pieces of Level 12 spiritual equipment.

He looked around him and a blue and red light flashed in his eyes.

“Spirit Array! They have sealed this region with spirit arrays. However...”

Ruthlessness flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes. This spirit array was a far cry from the spirit array around Yong Chang world.

He could move out of the spirit array and see what was happening outside.

“It seems like I have encroached on the interests of various elixir pill shops and weapons shops. These must be the people they have sent to assassinate me!”

“Although I have affected your business, you sent assassins after me without even discussing the matter. How domineering!”

Wang Xian looked across the corpses. He had long expected his actions to offend the other elixir pill shops and weapons shops in Yong Chang City.

However, he had made another consideration. That was if they approached him after he offended them, he would raise a collaboration proposal.

He believed the other party would definitely be satisfied with the collaboration proposal.

However, the other parties had sent fifteen Budding Realm experts to assassinate him directly.

“All the forces behind the elixir pill shops and weapons shops in Yong Chang City are likely to be part of this. Since you guys wanted to take the tough road, I’ll play along with you to the very end!”

A cold light flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes. He looked at the group of people waiting outside before moving.

“It’s about time. Our Elders should have killed that damn master by now!”

“He wouldn’t have to die if he knew what was best for him. After offending all the families behind the elixir pill shops and weapons shops in Yong Chang City, his death was certain!”

Just as Wang Xian flew out of the spirit array, he could hear two people ridiculing him.

“Hehe! You guys are the ones who don’t know what’s best for you!”

Just as the two men were conversing casually, a cold voice resounded from above their heads.

“Who?”

The two of them were shocked and lifted their heads immediately.

Cough cough!

At that instant, their eyes widened and fear overwhelmed them.

Bam! Bam! Bam!

Sounds of bodies falling to the ground were incessant.

“Over fifty people!”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes and looked towards the yard. At that place, there were even wooden materials prepared to restore the structure.

Other than that, he also found four jadestone plates that were each the size of a human head around.

[Concealment Array: Level 1]

Spirit Array? Is this a spirit array? One that is prepared and made?

Wang Xian was shocked. Recalling that the Dragon Palace would require spirit arrays, he smiled and put them within his space ring!

The small shop was completely destroyed and has to be rebuilt!

Wang Xian frowned. He waved his arm, carried the materials and came back to the small shop.

Perhaps the assassins had taken special precautions. Only his small shop was destroyed.

Wang Xian waved his arm and streams of water supported the wooden materials. After half an hour, he had finally rebuilt the small shop. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

As he retracted the water flow, everything was largely the same as before.

The rain was still falling. However, it was a lot lighter as compared to before.

There was only dim lighting around the area.

Wang Xian looked at those corpses and a cold smirk appeared on his face. He turned his attention towards a tall tower in the middle.

Yong Chang Tower was the tallest tower in Yong Chang City. It was also a tower for spectating the city view.

He waved his arm and the corpses were hung on the tower.

“I hope your assassination attempts don’t stop. I’d still like to have some fun with you guys!”
