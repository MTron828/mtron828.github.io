Chapter 3017: The 3016 intruders from the Dragon Palace were killed

“I already know some of the situation!”

Wang Xian told Shu Qing, Feng Luan, and the rest when he heard the situation.

Sitting on the Dragon Chair, his eyes revealed a cold expression.

“Xiao Xian, then we…”

Guan Shuqing and the rest frowned and said.

“Let me handle it. Our dazzling starry sky might be in chaos soon. You guys don’t have to care about the dragon and Phoenix dynasty anymore!”

Wang Xian said to the group of girls. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Alright then!”

Guan Shuqing and the rest nodded their heads sensibly.

The powerful races in the universe were not something the Dragon and Phoenix Divine Empire could handle.

“Tian Cheng, an lie, follow me to investigate. The eight-limbed Demon Fiend, you guys go too. Bring some of your subordinates with you!”

Wang Xian ordered.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Tian Cheng and the rest nodded with cold eyes.

They moved and immediately arrived in front of the teleportation formation of the Dragon Palace. They arrived directly at Planet Nine Destruction.

The Dragon Palace on Planet Nine Destruction had been destroyed last time. Wang Xian had built another one.

This time, the group of powerhouses from various forces arrived at Planet Nine destruction and did not enter the Dragon Palace.

Through the teleportation, they arrived at the Dragon Palace on Planet Nine Destruction. Wang Xian and the rest concealed themselves and flew towards the direction of the mainland.

Their speed was very fast. When they arrived at the mainland, the Heaven Formation took out a compass.

This magic tool was obtained from the Mo Han clan’s mainland.

It was able to detect if there were any deaths in a particular place.

Looking at the place shown on the map, Wang Xian and the rest immediately flew over.

When they entered a manor, they immediately saw dozens of corpses on the ground.

Upon seeing this scene, Wang Xian and the rest had a cold expression on their faces.

Such wanton killing in the territory of the Dragon Palace showed that they did not put them in their eyes at all!

“Search!”

Wang Xian immediately ordered the heaven formation.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The Heaven Formation nodded and immediately activated the formation.

Currently, the Heaven Formation had the strength of a level seven celestial thearch. It was comparable to a peak powerhouse of an ordinary race.

Very soon, the scene of more than a dozen corpses being killed appeared on the ground.

“There are two horns on their heads. This should be the ancient rare race, a domain-level race. The strongest person in the race has the strength of a ninth level celestial thearch!”

Wang Xian looked at the scene in front of him with a cold look in his eyes.

“Lock onto them!”

He said immediately.

“Yes!”

The Heaven Formation nodded and immediately began to lock onto them with the formation.

“Found it!”

“It’s still on this planet!”

Soon, the heaven’s formation said coldly.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian and the rest immediately flew over.

In a mansion, five figures were sitting inside. They were resting leisurely and could smell a faint scent of blood in the air.

Clearly, the owner of this place had been killed!

“You’re courting death!”

Just as the five of them were lying there leisurely, a voice sounded beside their ears.

The five of them changed their expressions and fear appeared in their eyes.

“Jie Jie Jie, how dare you cause trouble in Our Dragon Palace’s territory? Go To Hell!”

The eight-headed demon said coldly and the poisonous horned dragons behind him flew towards them.

“How dare you? We’re from the ancient rare race!”

The five of them were horrified and wanted to resist, but at this moment, a terrifying dragon’s might rushed into their minds.

Their bodies stiffened slightly, and the five poisonous horned dragons entered their bodies and took possession of them.

The five of them struggled for a while, and their eyes were wide with shock.

Slowly, the five of them stood up, and a black light flashed in their eyes.

“Dragon King!”

They cupped their hands and shouted respectfully.

“What News did you get?”

Wang Xian asked immediately.

“Dragon King, the five of them have already passed the information of our Dragon Palace over. The Guxi tribe will send a level eight celestial thearch, five level seven celestial thearch, and twenty level six celestial thearch powerhouses over!”

A poisonous horned dragon in the middle said.

“Is that so?”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly. His eyes were flashing with a cold luster.

“When will they arrive?”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and asked.

“They are expected to arrive at our place in ten days!”

The poisonous horned dragon reported.

“Very good. Then we will wait for them for ten days.”

Wang Xian said coldly.

“Let’s go to a place!”

He said to the sky array.

The sky array nodded and continued to search!

“Here!”

Soon, they came to another place, a remote street.

There were no corpses around. They should have been disposed of!

Buzz

The sky array waved its arm and streams of energy enveloped the surroundings.

Soon, an image appeared in front of them. A race with thin limbs and a relatively large head appeared in their line of sight.

“This is a race of brain spirits, a domain-level race. Their strongest person is also at level nine of the Celestial Thearch!”

As Heaven Array spoke, he immediately set up a formation to lock onto it.

“In the void far away, there are only two people!”

Heaven Array said very quickly.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian and the rest moved their bodies and immediately flew towards the sky.

After locking onto a star in the void, Wang Xian’s eyes were shining.

“There are two people inside the meteorite. They have the strength of a celestial emperor at level seven!”

Wang Xian’s dragon eyes penetrated through the meteorite and said.

“Let me intimidate them and parasitize them!”

He immediately said.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Beside Ba Qi, the two poisonous horned dragons immediately nodded.

The three-eyed race and the four-armed race had a total of 12 celestial emperor level seven powerhouses killed by Wang Xian.

The elevation of these powerhouses this time had all been used on the poisonous horned dragon species and the thorned dragon species.

This was because Prime Minister Gui and the rest knew that these two dragon species were very useful for the following matters.

With the poisonous horned dragon species and the eight-limbed demonic fiend, there were 10 celestial thearch level-seven powerhouses.

There were four thorned dragon species.

“Boom!”

Wang Xian and the rest flew over. Before the other party could react, a strong suppressive force rushed over.

The pupils of the two celestial thearch level-seven powerhouses in the meteorite shrunk as they revealed a look of fear.

“Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Two black shadows rushed straight into the meteorite!

Under Wang Xian’s strong draconic aura, the two celestial thearch level-seven powerhouses of the brain spirit race were unable to resist and were directly parasitized.

Boom

Soon, two figures rushed out.

“Dragon King!”

The two experts of the brain spirit race who were infected greeted Wang Xian respectfully.

“Dragon King, the brain spirit race will send two level-eight divine emperors. As for the rest of the experts, we don’t have any information!”

“It’s estimated that they will arrive in about 13 days!”

They reported immediately.

“Two?”

Wang Xian frowned slightly and nodded his head.

Two level eight celestial thearchs. If one of them was killed by his surprise, the other would be able to kill him very quickly. It wouldn’t be a big problem.

“Continue. I want to see who is the hunter and who is the prey in this upcoming war!”

Wang Xian said to the sky array and the rest. His eyes were filled with violent killing intent.

Those who covet the Dragon Palace, those who violate the Dragon Palace, die!
