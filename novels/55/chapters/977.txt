Chapter 978: 0979 Thunder Island

Translator: 549690339

After walking out of the arena, Wang Xian returned to his residence.

Wang Xian didn’t care about crippling Liu Minghai and Qin Shan.

The two of them were courting death.

Wang Xian had a limit to his patience. After being provoked one after another, he naturally wanted to make an example out of others.

He warned the others that if they provoked him again, they should think about the consequences first.

As for the young master’s mercenary group’s Revenge, if they still dared to take revenge, they would do it.

Wang Xian would not show any mercy.

The next morning, Wang Xian did not go to class. Instead, he walked straight to the Demon Hunters Academy’s Mission Office.

The Demon Hunters Academy’s Mission Office was where the students of the Demon Hunters Academy received their missions.

This mission office was connected to the missions of the mercenary association outside the Academy.

However, there was a difference. There were special missions that could not be obtained from the hiring association within the mission office of the Demon Hunters Academy.

Sometimes, the academy would issue large-scale missions as well as assessment missions.

After completing the mission, not only would one be rewarded, one would also be able to obtain points.

Points could be exchanged for information and treasures.

The students of the Demon Hunters Academy would all receive missions from the mission office.

“That’s Wang Xian!”

“It’s him. The young man who chopped off Liu Minghai’s arm is very strong!”

“What is a freshman doing here? Is He doing a mission?”

“There’s no movement from the young master’s mercenary group and the amethyst mercenary group. Could they be secretly preparing to deal with him?”

The place where the Demon Hunters Academy received their missions was similar to the construction and Employment Association.

There were many students around him. When he entered the hall, many of them recognized him immediately.

However, it was different from two days ago. Today, these students were only discussing and no one came up to provoke him.

His vicious methods had indeed made many people fearful.

Wang Xian walked straight ahead. On the screen in front, there were all kinds of missions scrolling.

Ao Yao and the rest would be back in two days. Therefore, he had to look for some missions in the next two days. He had to look for good missions and search for information. When the time came, he would start doing missions to increase his strength.

With a glance, he saw all kinds of missions. After the mission reward, there were also points reward.

For a silver-level mission, the points would be at least 1000.

For a gold-level mission, the points could reach up to 10,000.

And if one wanted to exchange for a transcendent level 5 weapon, they would need a million points.

Of course, if the points were insufficient, they could use spirit stones to make up for it.

“Thunderstorm region, dragon wind region, Wind Arrow Mountain region, forest region, water region!”

Wang Xian looked at the mission screen. It was completely different from the mercenary association. The missions of the Demon Hunter College were actually divided into regions.

These five regions were the places near Donghai city where missions were conducted. They were also the regions where wild beasts were more concentrated.

Other than the lush forest region, the rest were in the ocean.

Whichever region one was more familiar with would be chosen. This would greatly increase the success rate of the mission.

In addition, when searching for information, one would also be able to choose the corresponding region better.

Wang Xian looked at the missions in each region with a face full of curiosity.

The lowest mission was silver-grade and the highest was diamond-grade.

The highest mission was five-star Diamond-grade.

Hunting the dragon-phoenix Demonic Beast King in the Dragon Wind region.

The Dragon-phoenix Demonic Beast King was a terrifying demon at the first level of the void interpretation realm. He would extract its essence and blood.

“Let’s go, let’s go, the special mission is about to start!”

“According to the investigation of the experts in the academy, the Thunder Island in the thunderstorm region has been lacking in lightning recently. We can enter it successfully and obtain the Thunder Fruit!”

“The Thunder Island is a land of treasures. It is covered by lightning all year round. There are many thunder-type creatures and many treasures inside.”

“However, according to the records, the danger of the Thunder Island is a little high. Those who are below transcendent level four will be courting death if they enter!”

“The Academy has already issued the mission. Go, go, go and accept the mission!”

Just as Wang Xian was investigating the mission, a series of boisterous voices suddenly came from behind.

Wang Xian turned his head around in puzzlement and saw students walking towards the mission announcement.

He looked over in puzzlement and indeed, there was a special mission at the side.

The special mission represented the unique mission of the Demon Hunter College.

Head to the Thunder Island to obtain the Thunder Fruit: 1-star gold mission.

One extraordinary fifth-grade Thunder Fruit: reward 50,000 middle-grade spirit stones and 1,000 points.

Rank Six Extraordinary Thunder Fruit: reward 400,000 middle-grade spirit stones, 10,000 points.

Rank Seven Extraordinary Thunder Fruit: 3,000,000 Middle-grade Spirit Stones, 100,000 points.

Note: the lowest rank of the creatures on the Thunder Island is rank three extraordinary. Those below rank four extraordinary are best not to enter.

“HMM? The reward for this mission is so high. On the market, a rank five extraordinary spiritual herb spiritual fruit is worth between 40,000 and 50,000 points. And this is without any points!”

Wang Xian was intrigued. The Thunder Island was located in the middle of the ocean and was filled with aquatic creatures.

The lowest level of the beasts was level three transcendence. By devouring them, one could increase their dragon energy.

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. He took out the badge of the mercenary group and immediately walked towards the place where he received the mission.

“Qin Qing, you must go too. You should know that although your strength is not bad, it is still a little dangerous to go to the Thunder Island!”

“Deputy leader, I have to go this time. Don’t worry, I won’t become a burden to you guys. You guys don’t have to help me either!”

“Sigh, you don’t have to rush to repay the Spirit Stones you owe the team. You’re only in the third grade and your talent is very good. Now, you should focus on your training and accumulate experience. There’s no need to take the risk!”

“Deputy leader, just let me go. Such opportunities are rare for me!”

At this moment, the voices of two girls came from behind.

Wang Xian was slightly taken aback and turned around.

There were seven to eight girls. Each of them looked valiant and valiant with weapons in their hands.

The one who was in the middle of the conversation was a girl with short hair.

This girl was slightly burly. Wang Xian knew the one who was talking to her, Qin Qing.

The sister of Qin Shan whose limbs were crippled by him.

“Alright!”

The slightly burly amethyst mercenary group looked at Qin Qing’s pleas and nodded helplessly. “I promise you, but you have to be careful!”

“Thank you, deputy leader. Don’t Worry!”

Qin Qing revealed a smile on her face. When she turned her head around, she immediately saw Wang Xian and her expression instantly darkened.

“It’s you...”

Before Qin Qing could speak, a girl at the side recognized Wang Xian and sized him up coldly. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“So you’re the one who crippled Qin Qing’s younger brother’s limbs. HMPH, your methods are so cruel!”

The other girls looked over and stared at Wang Xian coldly.

The deputy leader of the amethyst mercenary group also raised his eyebrows.

“Shut up!”

Wang Xian glanced at them and said coldly before turning around.

“You... Kid, who are you talking about?”

A girl glared at Wang Xian and questioned him loudly.

“Don’t bother me!”

Wang Xian was a little impatient. After saying that, he passed the badge to the staff in front of him.

“Take the mission from the Thunder Island!”

“Alright!”

The female staff who was sitting inside looked at the badge in surprise. Then, she looked outside and nodded.
