Chapter 363: Horrifying Creatures Besieging The Dragon Palace (3)

“What’s the King Cuttlefish race doing here?” Wang Xian frowned in suspicion. He was surprised at the sight of close to thirty King Cuttlefishes at about a thousand meters away.

At the center of the school was the Level 12 King Cuttlefish, accompanied by five Level 11 at its sides, while the remaining were all Level 10 creatures.

“How timely. I couldn’t obtain any Dragon Energy from the Aurora Jellyfish earlier, given that it disappeared from its body as soon as it died. With these tens of King Cuttlefishes, they’ll bring me much Dragon Energy.” Wang Xian smirked with temptation.

This was the Dragon Palace, the territory of the Dragon King. By battling within an area of twenty kilometers in radius around the Dragon Palace, all Dragon Palace members engaged would have their combat abilities raised by fifty percent.

Moreover, there was another advantage by battling within the grounds of the Dragon Palace, which was the speed of recovery.

Be it the recovery of energy or wounds, they would do so at a much faster rate as compared to other places.

An increase of fifty percent was already considered very high to Wang Xian.

“Go out, and kill all of them!” Wang Xian ordered with a smile. With a change of stance, he prepared himself to exit through the West Gate.

Roar, roar!

However, just as Wang Xian had begun to shift himself, a series of growls could be heard from up front at the North Gate.

The growls came consistently and frequently, sending tremors to the nearby area of tens of kilometers in radius.

This was followed by a series of massive water surges which was coming straight at the Dragon Palace.

Wang Xian frowned with a burdened look as he turned immediately to look in the direction of the North Gate.

And there they were: sharks. Schools of menacing giant sharks.

“It’s the Mega-Teeth Shark race!” Wang Xian shrieked with narrowed eyes at the sight of them.

Several days ago, Wang Xian and Prime Minister Turtle had also bumped into this horrifying race of Mega-Teeth Sharks, while they were out selecting the location to construct the Dragon Palace.

Within the entire Mega-Teeth Shark race, there were two Level 12 members along with a crowd of Level 11, making them a much tougher force.

Howl, how, howl!

More groans could be heard, along with a force of terror.

To which, Wang Xian flinched as he looked hastily in the Northeast direction, where he sighted a group of close to fifty terrifying creatures.

They looked horrendous, especially with the megalodon teeth in its mouth. Its all-black body was wrapped in what seemed like body armor.

“It’s...the Dunkleosteus! All of which are of the Inborn level or even higher!” Wang Xian gasped with a heavy look. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Yet, this was far from the end, as they were followed by a troupe of over a hundred Anomalocaris, each measuring two meters.

Along with twenty or more horrendous Deep-sea Pythons, as well as a school of Swordfish, each shining with a metallic sheen.

To top it off, there were even more than a thousand Level 8 to 9 Pterygotus, along with another thousand or so bizarre-looking fish.

Gradually, within ten minutes, the area was flooded by close to five thousand frightening creatures.

Each and every one emitted a horror-striking aura.

Howl, howl!

The school of brutal sharks roared as they swayed their large bodies, staring intently in the direction of the Dragon Palace.

The leading Mega-Teeth Shark and Cyclop Shark looked on with glowing eyes as though they were on fire.

They could sense that the energy which gathered here was much stronger than their territory’s, which made them very pleased. Hence, they would like to make this space their own.

With a growl, the duo led the rest of their race and dived straight ahead for the Dragon Palace.

Boom!

Suddenly, as the school of sharks arrived above the Dragon Palace, they were resisted with a sheer force of defense.

Bobbing their heads, the leading Mega-Teeth Shark and Cyclop Shark glanced ahead with a confused look.

Howl, howl!

The two sharks growled again. This time, all accompanying sharks crashed ahead with the duo.

Bang, bang, bang!

That said, the defense of the Dragon Array sent them spinning in circles once more. In response, the sharks bared their jaws and stared darkly.

Besides the Mega-Teeth Shark race, the school of Dunkleosteus also came crashing using their bodies, which were as powerful as war machinery.

Tens of Dunkleosteus dived ahead, charging straight at the Dragon Palace, which resulted in successive loud crashes as they collided with the Dragon Array.

Pat, pat, pat, pat!

Loud and crisp smashes could be heard, as the giant King Cuttlefishes lashed their extended tentacles against the Dragon Array.

However, the Dragon Array merely gave off several ripples under the constant bombardment by the respective forces.

“Why have so many powerful underwater races gathered here at the Dragon Palace?” Wang Xian asked. He was puzzled by the tens of thousands of terrifying creatures which had gathered around, amongst which were about eight Level 12 combatants.

In addition, there were even more Level 11 creatures, hovering at about forty.

There were also more than a hundred Inborn level creatures.

The creatures, each with a threatening stance, were dying to enter the Dragon Palace.

Wang Xian looked on with a burdened look while the past flickered in his head.

“There was probably too much commotion during the construction of the Dragon Palace. They were likely attracted over by the two energy swirls!” Wang Xian speculated to himself, as he inhaled deeply.

“Thank goodness for the Dragon Array’s protection!” he exclaimed.

The Dragon Array was able to defend against the attacks by creatures of Level 12 and below.

Hence these surrounding creatures would not be able to overcome the defense of the Dragon Array.

Unless they were able to enter through the Dragon’s Gate.

That said, the Dragon’s Gate was erected to help sieve out outstanding members for the sake of the Dragon Palace. One who wishes to go past the Dragon’s Gate must possess extraordinary wisdom, talent and bloodline.

As for these groups of creatures, any attempts to enter through the Dragon’s Gate would be immensely tough.

Howl, howl!

Another growl could be heard, just as Wang Xian heaved a small sigh of relief after checking out the surroundings.

This growl was brimming with the utmost austerity and immense compulsion.

And as the growl surged past, all surrounding creatures, including the races gathered here, trembled briefly.

A tinge of fear flashed across their eyes.

The respective races and formidable organisms turned their heads towards the east.

Earlier, there hadn’t been anyone at the eastern entrance of the Dragon’s Gate.

But now, a ginormous creature gradually swam its way over.

It was a truly magnificent mammoth, as it was over ten meters bigger than the largest creature which had gathered here.

Its physical size was beyond shocking along with its four giant wings. As it inched its way over briefly, it sent the surrounding waters on a violent tumble.

Like a victor which had transcended from the past, its body boasted a rustic and dull aura.

“This...,” Wang Xian muttered in astonishment at the sight of the creature.

“Pliosaurus. It’s a Level 13 Pliosaurus!” Wang Xian let out a low growl while his face grew heavy at the sight of the Level 13 creature.

After all, this was a Level 13 Pliosaurus.

Wang Xian was currently a Level 7 Divine Dragon. In addition, he possessed the pure bloodline of the Divine Dragon, which was touted as the apex of all bloodlines. Hence, he was able to supersede five levels during combat, in the face of ordinary creatures.

That said, a five-level transcendance would mean that Wang Xian was only able to handle a Level 12 creature. To think that a Level 13 creature had now appeared...

“How... How did it attract such a threatening presence!” Wang Xian choked in trepidation, as his gaze remained fixed on the Pliosaurus.

As the Pliosaurus flapped its wings gently, it ascended above the Dragon Palace.

It then narrowed its eyes and peered at the surrounding creatures with contempt.

Formidable as they were, even the Mega-Teeth Shark, Cyclop Shark and Dunkleosteus had a tinge of fear in their eyes.
