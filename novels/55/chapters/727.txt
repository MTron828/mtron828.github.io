Translator: 549690339

“Oh no, something big has happened!”

“Go to the location of the accident immediately!”

The appearance of the five-star distress signal bullet caused the entire Ming Wang Immortal sect to shake.

Five-star, this was an accident that happened to a half-step immortal God level powerhouse. There were less than four half-step immortal God level powerhouses in their immortal sect.

The expressions of some elders of the immortal sect changed drastically. In less than a minute, a group of Bright King Immortal sect flew toward Jiang City.

There were a total of twenty-five people, all of whom were infant realm experts.

Almost half of Bright King Immortal sect’s infant realm experts were mobilized. The leader was a bald old man.

His head was emitting a faint light in the dark night. He wore a robe and held a magic staff in his hand.

The group of people flew toward the direction of the distress signal at a terrifying speed.

When the group of Ming Wang Immortal sect powerhouses rushed over, a post that made all the disciples of the two great immortal sects furious exploded on the Jianghu website in the Shun Ding area.

“Dragon King of the Dragon Gate killed the core disciples, deacons and elders of the puppet immortal sect of the Ming Wang Immortal sect. We want to avenge them!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

There were pictures attached to a post.

The pictures were the corpses of the disciples of the immortal sect, close to twenty corpses.

There were also some introductions about the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate at the bottom of the pictures.

There were many words in the introductions, about two or three hundred words, mainly describing the Dragon King’s brutality, arrogance, and contempt for the immortal sect. He even said that he would destroy the Mingwang Immortal sect and the puppet immortal sect.

Nowadays, everyone in the immortal sect had a mobile phone, especially when they had just come into contact with the internet. Many people in the immortal sect were paying attention to the things on the Internet.

When they saw this post, everyone was furious.

Especially when they saw the top ten disciples of the immortal sect, including the second-ranked Heaven’s pride disciple, Ming Quan’s corpse, and the corpse of elder Ming. Everyone was furious.

That was the most elite disciple of their immortal sect, an elder of their immortal sect, and now he was killed.

This was simply an insult and provocation to their immortal sect.

The disciples of the puppet immortal sect were the same. The deacons were killed, and the disciples were killed.

The entire post instantly ignited the anger of the two immortal sects. In just half an hour, the number of replies reached hundreds of thousands.

Countless disciples expressed that they would definitely kill the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate.

The two immortal sect disciples were in an uproar. Many even wanted to kill the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate Tonight.

The crowd was furious.

“Flying kite!”

In the Xianyang Hotel, the experts of the Mingwang Immortal sect sensed the aura of the girl and immediately flew over.

When they saw the corpse in the banquet hall, their expressions changed drastically.

“Old Bai!”

When the bald old man saw the white-haired middle-aged man’s corpse, his expression changed drastically, and he immediately walked over.

“Who did it? !”

The bald old man’s gaze swept over the surrounding corpses, and his expression was extremely gloomy.

“Dragon Gate Dragon King!”

Fei Yuan’s eyes were slightly red. “It was the youth who humiliated Mu Zidao and Ming Feng Yesterday. We thought that the other party wanted to attract the attention of our immortal sect and wanted to join us. We came over with Uncle Ming!”

“In the end, there was a conflict. The other party had around 30 infant realm experts and a terrifying assassin hidden in the void. Uncle Ming was killed in an instant by a sneak attack!”

“What?”

The surrounding Ming Wang Immortal sect experts revealed shocked expressions when they heard the girl’s words.

“30 infant realm experts? Assassins hidden in the Void?”

The Bald Old Man’s eyes revealed a grave expression. Soon after, his expression became slightly malevolent. “Not to mention 30 infant realm experts, even if there were 40 of them, they dared to kill so many of us. We must take revenge!”

“First Elder, that Dragon King told me to tell our immortal God not to provoke him, or else... or else we will bear the consequences!”

Fei Yuan continued to say with a serious expression.

“Bear the consequences?”

The Bald Old Man’s face instantly darkened, and all the surrounding experts of the Ming King Immortal sect also realized the seriousness of the problem.

Since the other party dared to directly ask them to tell them about the immortal god, then it was inevitable that the other party also had terrifying experts at the immortal God level.

“Report to the immortal God immediately!”

The Bald Old Man took a deep breath and said with a solemn face.

The group of Ming Wang Immortal sect powerhouses carried the corpses around them and flew toward the immortal sect with extremely ugly expressions.

Five core disciples ranked in the top fifteen were killed, and an elder who was half a step away from the immortal God level was killed.

This was the most serious loss Ming Wang Immortal sect had suffered since its appearance.

The main peak of Ming Wang Immortal sect was a mountain that was emitting white light. The entire mountain peak was like a holy mountain.

“Dong Dong Dong!”

At nine o’clock in the evening, the bell on the main peak rang and spread throughout the entire immortal sect.

All the elders and deacons of the immortal sect had gathered.

A figure slowly appeared in front of a chair in the middle of the front.

There were only four chairs in front.

At this moment, all the experts of the immortal sect were gathered in the hall. On the ground in front of them, there were many corpses.

“Sect leader, the entire immortal sect is filled with righteous indignation. We must avenge elder Ming and the others!”

An old man looked at the corpses on the ground with a face full of grief and indignation and shouted angrily.

“Sect leader, elder Ming and five elite disciples were killed. We must avenge them!”

Another old man said.

“You don’t need to care about this matter. We will handle it!”

The figure covered by the white light said to the group of immortal sect powerhouses below.

“Sect leader, all the disciples of the immortal sect hope that we can take revenge for them. There are more than 10,000 disciples waiting outside the immortal sect!”

The bald old man sighed and said to the white figure.

“We will handle this matter. The other party has an immortal-level powerhouse. Let all the disciples wait for the result!”

The white figure said in a deep voice.

“Yes, sect leader!”

The powerhouses of the Ming Wang Immortal sect nodded slightly and didn’t say anything.

The battle involving the immortal-level powerhouses wasn’t something they could participate in.

“Bury them properly and leave!”

The figure said directly, and the group of immortal-level powerhouses immediately walked out.

At this time, tens of thousands of immortal-level disciples had gathered outside the main peak.

“Elder, how should we deal with this matter? Should the disciples go and kill the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate?”

The disciples of the Ming Wang Immortal sect were completely incited by the posts on the Jianghu Internet.

Their fellow disciples had been killed, and the posts were full of sensational exaggerations, which made them want to kill the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate immediately.

“The sect master will handle this matter personally. Everyone, don’t worry. The disciples of the Ming King Immortal sect can’t die in vain!”

The bald old man said to the disciples in front of him with a gloomy face.

“It’s good that the sect master will handle it personally!”

“Destroy them. Destroy their entire sect. Leave No one alive!”

“They dare to kill the people of our Ming King Immortal sect. They dare to provoke our immortal sect. Make them pay a heavy price!”

“Hang the Dragon King’s corpse in our immortal sect and use his corpse to repent!”

When the disciples of the Ming Wang Immortal sect heard that the sect master was going to deal with this matter, they were all excited.

If the immortal God made a move, the guy who dared to kill their disciples would be dead for sure!
