“The Outstanding Young Heroes Chart this year is sick!”

“They aren’t just sick. All of them are demons!”

“I thought Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown was incomparably strong. However, that mysterious young man turned out to be even more frightening!”

“Sss. The corpse of the Roaring Lion was taken by that ominous-looking young man. That’s the biggest insult to the Imperial Beast Sect!”

“Looking at the circumstances, if it wasn’t for that mystical golden spiritual bird that flew over, Shi Ming would likely have been killed!”

Below the arena, the crowd was still discussing. Shi Ming was shivering as he witnessed the corpse of his companion being lifted away. His eyes were bloodshot.

However, the loser had to pay a price in this arena. He couldn’t say anything against the ominous-looking young man for taking away the corpse of the Roaring Lion.

These were the rules and no one could break them. Otherwise, he would be looked down upon by everyone.

The remaining supreme talents were also looking at that ominous-looking young man with fear and shock.

“It’s no surprise considering that he’s from the Devil Corpse Palace. With his creepy attacking methods, powerful physical body and Inborn level strength, there would be few who could be a match for him here!” the young lord of Sea Serpent Island squinted his eyes and commented. “However, I’ll definitely be able to defeat him within a hundred moves!”

“It’s our turn. Which two brothers would like to spar with us?”

At this juncture, Saint Qi and Saint Wen from the Dark Sect jumped into the air before landing in two different arenas. Both of them smiled radiantly as they issued an open challenge to the supreme talents below the stage.

“Let me give it a try!”

“Let me give it a try!”

Soon, two young men jumped up. Their eyes were fixed on Saint Qi and Saint Wen as they clasped their left fists in their right palms and said, “Please enlighten me!”

“Let’s start with something cool. Level 9 Shadow Blades!”

Saint Qi and Saint Wen from the Dark Sect each drew a dagger as they spoke to their opponents.

“Great. It’s only interesting this way!”

The other two supreme talents also drew their weapons which had identical value.

“Please enlighten me!”

The contest started once again. However, it wasn’t as brutal as before and resembled ordinary sparring.

The contest ended with the Dark Sect losing in one and winning in the other.

Following next, one after another outstanding young Inborn expert went up to the arena.

If they did not have a prior feud, they typically wouldn’t risk their lives in battles.

Below the stage, all the proud and talented young men were watching each battle attentively.

From the battles, they were able to analyze and tell who was stronger or weaker than them. At the same time, it gave them a rough idea of the eventual ranking on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart.

As for the remaining crowd, they were shocked by the intense and competitive battles.

Wang Xian was smirking confidently while watching the battles develop.

Up to this point, that ominous-looking young man was the strongest. It would be a little troublesome for the dragonians to defeat him. However, he relied on his bloodline just like the dragonians. The dragonians still have over a seventy percent chance of winning!

As for the rest, they are relatively weaker!

Wang Xian squinted his eyes and his attention fell on the young lord of Sea Serpent Island and the Flower Monk.

Both of them were slightly stronger.

Soon after, the Flower Monk fought with another young man. In less than ten moves, he defeated the young man easily. No one was able to tell his actual strength yet!

The Flower Monk had shocked the crowd with his strength.

To this point, the surrounding crowd had a rough understanding. Based on those who had fought, the young lord of Sea Serpent Island was undoubtedly relatively stronger.

After him, it would be the Flower Monk and that ominous-looking young man.

Also, there was still Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown who had not participated. In their views, Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown should at least be as strong as the three of them.

As for Xiao Yu, not many held high hopes for her.

When fighting with Hua Mingshan, her moves were too simple. As such, no one really found her to be strong. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Suddenly, all the disciples of Sacred Clans, Sacred Sects and powerful forces received a message from their clans and sects.

When they saw the message, they were taken aback and shocked.

The battles of the Outstanding Young Heroes Competition were streamed on the website of the Underworld. Those who weren’t at the competition ground had their attention fixed on the Underworld website.

The total bets that had been placed for the current Outstanding Young Heroes Competition had also reached an astronomical figure of over $50 billion.

The entire Underworld was talking about the happenings of the Outstanding Young Heroes Competition. On the forum, there was various analysis on who would become the champion for the year.

However, another thread had attracted more views than the thread on the competition.

The thread was about Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown killing three men from the Medical Saint Sect.

Moreover, this incident had happened before the Outstanding Young Heroes Competition.

At that point, someone had posted about the incident on the Underworld website and shocked the entire Underworld.

When they saw the photos of the bodies, they were terrified.

In the thread, there was a detailed explanation of the flow of events.

[What? Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown killed the disciple of the Bian branch of Medical Saint Sect? And he just killed Hua Mingshan and his close confidants from the Hua branch of Medical Saint Sect?]

[Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown must be really eager to die. Just some time ago, he killed the Elders from the Sacred Followers Guild. Now, he’s killed so many people from the Medical Saint Sect!]

[The disciple of the Bian branch and Hua Mingshan were both rumored to be the most outstanding disciples of the current generation in Medical Saint Sect. Who would have thought that they would be killed? This... Miracle Doctor Wang’s actions are clearly an open provocation to the Medical Saint Sect.]

[They wouldn’t rest till one party perishes! Definitely! The Medical Saint Sect would want to kill Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown even if it meant deploying all the influence and strength of the entire sect.]

[Who would have expected Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown to be so brazen. Not only did he admit to killing the disciple from the Bian branch, he even killed the disciple from the Hua branch on the spot. What an insane person!]

All the martial artists around were initially interested in the battles of the Outstanding Young Heroes competition. However, they started discussing the message after seeing it.

In the short frame of ten minutes, the number of replies had reached a hundred thousand.

The current incident was even more shocking than Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown killing the Elders from the Sacred Followers Guild.

Killing the most outstanding disciples of the Medical Saint Sect had breached the bottom line of the Medical Saint Sect.

At this juncture, it was just like what everyone in the Underworld had expected. When the Medical Saint Sect received the news, the entire Medical Saint Sect was shocked!

“Kill him! Annihilate him and all his family, friends and kin. Leave not a single person behind!”

Within a quiet mountain valley, an angry roar resounded.

In a majestic structure, two middle-aged men sat on two chairs in the middle of the structure. Below them, there was another old man.

Everyone here was gloomy and filled with killing intent.

“How dare he kill the disciple of the Medical Saint Sect. It would seem we have stayed low for too long. I want to shred him into thousands and thousands of pieces right now!”

Besides the screaming middle-aged man, another middle-aged man closed his eyes slightly while leaning back in his chair. Brimming with killing intent, he remarked coldly, “We wouldn’t let him live for even a second more!”

The middle-aged man by the side nodded his head. He clenched his fist tightly and instructed, “Take out two Level 6 elixir pills and pay all the price required! Send out our disciples and shred him to pieces!”

“After that, we will go for anyone who is connected to him!”
