Chapter 1542: 1542 suppressing all heaven’s favorites 5

“How is this possible?”

In the banquet venue of the Wuqing City Mansion, Tian Qingguang, another young man, and Bing Jinghuan let out a cry of surprise.

Their pupils contracted slightly as they stared at Wang Xian with flickering eyes.

The young men and women from the Divine Light Empire were not strong, but they were definitely not weak either. It was absolutely easy for them to deal with a young priest of light.

However, they were instantly killed by this radiant priest Wang.

This made the three of them look slightly embarrassed. The people around them were also surprised.

“This fellow’s strength!”

As the son of Light, Tian Qingguang clenched his fists and stared at Wang Xian. His expression was uncertain.

As a radiant priest, he had a very good understanding of the radiant priest’s strength.

Last time, he had been easily thrown out from the fourth floor. He had thought that the other party’s strength was at most at the third level of the insight void tier.

A radiant priest at the third level of the insight void tier could not be found with the strength of other cultivators at the second level of the insight void tier.

However, there was a second level of the insight void tier who had surrounded priest Wang just now, and there were more than ten first level of the insight void tier. How could he have been thrown out in an instant?

This...

How Strong was he?

A fourth-level insightful void martial artist Radiant Priest?

He couldn’t believe it!

However, his strength...

Tian qingguang stared at Wang Xian with an uncertain expression.

“Isn’t this priest Wang a radiant priest? How could he defeat the people from the Divine Light Empire in an instant?”

The elite disciples from the surrounding factions were also staring at Wang Xian in shock as they sized him up carefully.

No wonder he dared to be so arrogant!

So he had such strength!

“To think that he could easily defeat a bunch of powerhouses at level one and level two of the Seethrough realm. He really has the right to be arrogant!”

“Interesting, this is more interesting!”

Bing jinghuan stared at Wang Xian coldly as he slowly took two steps forward.

“It is very interesting!”

The young prince from the Divine Light Empire also slowly walked forward with a long sword of light in his hand.

“Ninth prince, do you want us to teach this guy a lesson for you?”

“Eighth prince, do you need us to make a move?”

Seeing that Bing Jinghuan and the young prince from the Divine Light Empire were about to make a move, the surrounding youths from the second-rate forces took a few steps forward and asked for instructions.

If they made a move now, they would be able to make the two princes from the first-rate forces show their favor.

“There’s no need. I want to see how strong a radiant priest can be.”

Bing Jing Huan’s lips curled up slightly with a hint of interest on his face.

“HMM? What’s going on? The Prince of Wu Qing Cheng’s banquet has been changed to a sparring venue?”

“There might be people sparring here. Hehe, interesting, interesting. We’re a little late!”

At this moment, a surprised voice came from behind.

Everyone was slightly stunned when they heard this voice. They quickly looked back.

“He Sui family!”

“He family... is he yuan, the young master of the He family’s Forest Beast Taming clan. The woman beside him seems to be he suiqing, he Yuan’s fiancée. The He family and he sui family are going to have a marriage alliance!”

“He Suiwen is here too. His talent is only slightly inferior to he yuan and the Crown Prince of Wuqing City in the vast region. However, he’s still very powerful!”

Everyone looked behind them and hurriedly shouted at he yuan, he suiwen, and the others in front of them. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

In terms of the top heaven’s favorites in the vast region, the ones standing at the top were Wuqing City of Wuji Imperial City, the two heaven’s favorites in Heaven and earth, the invincible Southern Emperor, and the He clan’s Forest Beast Master, he yuan.

Each of them had their own name, which was recognized by the entire vast region.

Even he suiwen of the He clan and the other outstanding disciples of the Solitaire sect of the southern Imperial City of Wuji Imperial City couldn’t compare to the five of them.

The talent of the five of them was unparalleled in their generation.

He Yuan’s arrival and he suiwen’s arrival made everyone look over.

“Young Master Wen, you’re here. Hehe, it’s not too late, it’s not too late. I was just preparing to teach a radiant priest a lesson. It just so happens that you can watch the Show!”

When Bing Jinghuan of the Bingxin Empire saw the arrival of the He clan and he suiwen clan, he looked at he suiwen and said with a faint smile.

“Teach a radiant priest a lesson? Haha, What? Ninth Prince, are you guys fighting with the Divine Light Empire?”

He suiwen looked at the people of the Divine Light Empire lying on the ground and said with a laugh.

“Young Master Wen, don’t sow discord between me and brother Bingjing Huan!”

The eighth Prince of the Divine Light Empire looked at he suiwen and said indifferently.

“Oh? Aren’t you two fighting?”

He suiwen revealed a curious expression.

As they spoke, they walked over and glanced around.

He Yuan also swept his gaze across the crowd with a smile on his face.

“A guy who dares to insult Princess Qingyan and provoke us. You guys are just in time to watch us do it for free!”

Bing Jinghuan said to he suiwen indifferently.

“Haha, interesting. I would like to see who dares to provoke you, Bing Jinghuan and Tian Qingyuan! Heroes are useless!”

He suiwen laughed out loud and looked at Wang Xian with a smile. His eyes were filled with curiosity.

He suiwen, who was dressed loosely, exuded a free and easy aura. He stood there with his arms crossed.

He Yuan was also looking around curiously. His gaze landed on Wang Xian’s back.

“Eh?”

He looked at this figure and felt that it was somewhat familiar. However, he shook his head immediately.

He had a bright aura and held a bright staff in his hand. How could it be...

“Young master Wang Xian, it’s young master Wang Xian!”

At this moment, Lin Yaoyao, who was at the side, suddenly widened her eyes and exclaimed when she saw Wang Xian’s figure.

As a member of the Forest Yaoyao race, she had a unique talent.

When she first saw Wang Xian’s figure, she felt that it was somewhat familiar.

However, she didn’t think of this figure as that person. However, when she sensed it carefully, she was stunned.

She sensed it a few more times before she could confirm it completely.

Young master Wang Xian was definitely that young master Wang Xian.

“Young master Wang Xian? Yaoyao, did you see wrongly?”

He suiqing, who was holding he Yuan’s arm, heard her exclamation and looked over in puzzlement.

Although she also felt that this back view was very familiar, how was this possible.

“Long time no see, he yuan!”

However, at this moment, Wang Xian heard a voice coming from behind. He turned his head and looked at he yuan with a smile.

“Brother... brother Wang Xian... this... this...”

When he yuan saw Wang Xian, his eyes widened in shock. His eyes were filled with disbelief.

He even stuttered when he spoke!

Is he really the Wang Xian brothers? is he really the Wang Xian brothers?

He was dressed in white and held a staff of light in his hand. His body was exuding a holy radiance.

Damn it, how could he be the Sky Demon who had the demonic aura churning in his mind and killed millions of living beings and seven demon lords in one night?
