Chapter 104: Military Training

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Wang Dahai had just gotten dumped. Using his own words, it was being dumped before getting into a relationship.

Rongrong was the girl he’d liked the most since he was born. However, the shame was that... her character was poor.

Nonetheless, this didn’t stop Wang Dahai from feeling like he got dumped. He dragged Wang Xian along to drink for the entire night in memory of his failed relationship.

They drank from the wee hours of the day until dawn broke, and Wang Xian accompanied him for the entire night.

When he woke up, it was already 4 in the afternoon.

“Dahai, Dahai.”

Wang Xian tried to wake Wang Dahai.

“No... Shit, it’s already 4 pm! I still have to report to class at night!” Wang Dahai exclaimed and quickly sat up. “My head is aching from the drinking!”

“Let’s get up and go get dinner. Let’s go, I’ll treat you to something good!”

“First-grade Restaurant?” Wang Dahai’s eyes lit up.

They’d had a long conversation the previous night and Wang Xian told him about the fact that he was the boss of First-grade Restaurant.

“Brother Xian, Brother Xian! Let’s go and have something good to relieve my sorrows of being dumped!”

Wang Dahai jumped up immediately. From his excited looks, he didn’t look like he just got dumped.

Wang Xian smiled and nodded his head. He changed into another set of clothes before giving Xiao Yu a call.

“I’ve also called my sister and her roommates. Oh right, where’s Zhang Wen and Zhang Feng?”

Zhang Wen and Zhang Feng were the other two people in the same dormitory. In his dormitory, Wang Dahai and Wang Xian were closer to each other.

Zhang Wen and Zhang Feng were closer to each other. Nonetheless, the four of them had a cordial relationship.

“I don’t know. They must be with their girlfriends.”

Hmm.

Wang Xian nodded his head but still called them to verify. However, they were accompanying their girlfriends and couldn’t come.

Wang Xian didn’t press further and headed towards the girl’s dormitory with Wang Dahai.

“Brother!”

Xiao Yu, Yuan Yuanyuan and Su Qian walked over. Xiao Yu walked to his side joyously and held on to his arm.

“Before we go get dinner, let me introduce him. He is my brother, Wang Dahai!”

Wang Xian explained to the group of girls. After which, he introduced the girls to Wang Dahai.

“Hello, pretty!” Wang Dahai chuckled. However, his attention fell on Su Qian and remained there for some time.

“Let’s go for dinner.” Wang Xian laughed. “Xiao Yu, are you guys starting on military training tomorrow?” [1]

“Yeah, 20 days of military training. That’s horrible.” Xiao Yu pouted and said grumpily. “After the military training, we probably will tanned too.”

The group chuckled and arrived at First-grade Restaurant.

First-grade Restaurant had returned to normal operations by today. However, it was still filled with customers and the popularity of First-grade Restaurant hadn’t subsided on the Internet.

Currently, the net profit of First-grade Restaurant could reach approximately $1 million a day.

It could be considered very high.

However, when he recalled the materials he needed to build the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian could feel his head starting to ache.

During Dinner, Wang Xian called Guan Shuqing over too. This made Wang Dahai a little dumbfounded as he gave a “thumbs up” to Wang Xian.

After the group finished their dinner, they headed back towards the school.

The school was starting officially today. Wang Xian and Guan Shuqing were chatting happily. After not seeing each other for two days, they had a lot to talk about.

As for Wang Dahai, he got closer to Su Qian and was trying to impart onto her his experiences at the University of Rivertown.

After parting with the girls, Wang Dahai looked at the back view of Su Qian and suddenly blurted out, “Haiz...Old Wang, I feel that I’m in love again!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Pfft!

Wang Xian was drinking from a bottle. When he heard what Wang Dahai said, he almost spit it out.

“Brother, you are in love again?” Wang Xian looked at him in astonishment.

“I’m serious about it this time. Did you notice how cute Su Qian is? It’s especially so for her plump face. Old Wang, my spring is coming again! I’ve made up my mind! I’m going to woo her!”

Wang Dahai spoke passionately. However, when he saw Wang Xian simply walking towards the classroom, he quickly asked, “Hey, hey. Old Wang, do you think I stand a chance?”

“Yes, you do!” Wang Xian replied helplessly.

“That will do. I’ve decided to bring water to Su Qian during her military training period and show her warmth!”

...

Wang Xian was speechless. When the two of them arrived in the class, most of the students were already there.

Wang Xian specialized in International Economics and Trade. Therefore, the guys far exceeded the number of girls. Moreover, beautiful girls were few and far between.

The prettiest of them all was Su Mei’er. However, she was very flirtatious and many did not have a good impression of her.

When he stepped into the room, Wang Xian immediately felt gazes upon him. Turning around, he saw Su Mei’er shifting away her gaze in a hurry. In her eyes, there was fear.

Wang Xian smiled and found two seats for him and Wang Dahai.

Soon, the school counselor walked in. The school counselor was a young man. After taking attendance, going through the questions they did for examination last year, and reminding the students to study diligently, he left.

The second year was much easier than the first year. There weren’t many miscellaneous matters to attend to and they had more free time.

After two lessons in the morning the second day, Wang Dahai rushed to Wang Xian. “Let’s go, Old Wang. Have you found out what I’ve asked you about?”

“Didn’t you add her on WeChat*? Can’t you ask her yourself?” Wang Xian looked at him, feeling speechless.

“You don’t understand! I couldn’t make it so obvious. It would be horrible if she thinks that I am the same as those casual guys! Quick, quick!”

Wang Dahai was pressing him and Wang Xian had no choice but to walk ahead helplessly. “Let’s go. I’ll bring you over!”

Seeing Wang Dahai regaining the vitality of spring, Wang Xian was still very happy about it. At the very least, Wang Dahai wasn’t severely affected by being dumped.

The sun was vicious today and this was something that the year one students wouldn’t like to see.

As the intense sunlight shone down, this group of spoiled students all felt miserable.

Wang Xian brought Wang Dahai to a spot in the field, found a place and sat down. “This is where my sister and her classmates are having their military training. Su Qian is also here.”

“Let us wait a while. When it’s their break time, we will go bring them some water!”

Wang Dahai chuckled as he looked around fervently, trying to spot Su Qian.

Wang Xian looked across and noticed that, after the girls put on the military cap, it wasn’t easy for him to see the girls’ looks. Therefore, he took out his mobile phone to play.

Perhaps the students just had their break. Therefore, the tutors didn’t give them a break despite Wang Xian and Wang Dahai waiting for half an hour.

Under the intense sun, one could see that every student’s face was turning a little red.

Wang Dahai was a little plump and didn’t take the heat well. He wiped off the perspiration on his forehead. “It’s so hot today. Luckily, there was rain for a few days during our military training last year!”

“Only by going through trials and tribulations can you get your girl!” Wang Xian looked at him and chuckled.

“Oh no! Someone has fainted!”

At this moment, a scream sounded from the side.

Wang Xian and Wang Dahai immediately looked over and saw a student lying on the ground. The military officer immediately carried her up and ran towards Wang Xian and Wang Dahai’s location where there was more shade.
