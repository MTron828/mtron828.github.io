Chapter 3145: On the 3144 Thunder Dragon

“After the destruction of the universe’s Divine Dragon clan, the other dragon species didn’t fare well.”

Wang Xian looked at the dragon species that only had a sliver of life force in front of him and sighed in his heart.

He walked over and placed his palm on the chain.

“HMM?”

When he used all his strength to break the chain, he realized that the strength of the chain was beyond his imagination.

“Acquired Numinous Treasure Level? To be able to withstand my strength, this is definitely not the doing of the Dragon tribe leader. It seems like this ya long has been imprisoned for a long time.”

Wang Xian mumbled to himself. His body moved and he immediately arrived at the end of the chains.

This was an acquired Numinous Treasure of the Earth attribute. It contained a powerful force.

Wang Xian waved his arm and the five elements Millstone appeared. Waves of energy landed on the chains.

“Hualala!”

The chain instinctively resisted. However, without anyone controlling the chain, even a powerful acquired Numinous Treasure would not be able to withstand the attack of the five elements millstone.

The chain contracted little by Little and let out a terrifying sound.

“This time, I have obtained a few acquired Numinous Treasures. After the five elements millstone devours them, I should be able to undergo an upgrade.”

Wang Xian looked at the chain and smiled.

After the Five Elements Millstone was upgraded again, it would have the power to kill a level two universe knight.

He looked at the Asian Dragon. The chain moved away from his body, but the marks left on his body did not recover.

The entire Asian Dragon’s body trembled. There was no movement at all.

“What a pity.”

Wang Xian shook his head. With a move of his palm, waves of dragon energy were transmitted into his body. At the same time, some dragon blood entered his body directly.

Thump! Thump! Thump

As the Dragon Energy and dragon blood were injected into his body, the heartbeat of the Asian Dragon became more and more intense.

As a large amount of dragon blood entered his body, the injuries on his body began to recover.

Traces of lightning appeared on his body.

The head buried in his body slowly raised its head. At this moment, Wang Xian finally saw his true face clearly. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

It was a dragon head that looked a little frail and aged. It had a pair of dragon horns.

Purple Lightning sparkled on the dragon horns.

“Dragon Blood… Thank you…”

He seemed to have not spoken for a very long time. He opened his dragon mouth and spoke four words at a loss.

“I am a member of the Divine Dragon lineage. You can call me the Dragon King.”

Wang Xian looked at him as he spoke. He poured a large amount of dragon blood onto his body once again.

The vitality in his body grew stronger.

His turbid gaze slowly became clear.

“Roar!”

He let out a low groan. Five minutes later, he transformed into the appearance of an old man.

“Thank you… Benefactor!”

He opened his mouth and knelt on the ground as though he was still not used to speaking.

“Get up. We are both from the divine dragon lineage. We should help each other. You should join our Dragon Palace in the future.”

Wang Xian looked at him and said faintly.

“Yes, benefactor!”

The elder nodded and stood up slowly.

“How long have you been imprisoned here?”

Wang Xian asked him curiously.

“I don’t know. 300 million years? 400 million years? I can’t remember clearly.”

The old man shook his head. A look of reminiscence appeared in his eyes. “Back then, I obtained some Thunder Treasures and was pursued by an expert. After i escaped, I was suppressed by a human and was imprisoned in this dark place.”

“He took my dragon scales and Dragon Blood. Later on, he seemed to have established a race called the dragon descendant race. Hehe, they were all experts nurtured by my blood.”

The old man said bitterly and shook his head.

“What?”

Upon hearing his words, Wang Xian was slightly shocked. Didn’t that mean that he had been imprisoned for more than two billion years?

“Thunder Treasure? Is this what you mean by Thunder Treasure?”

At this moment, Wang Xian took out a thunder attribute holy feather and said to the old man.

“Yes, this is it.”

The old man nodded his head. “This is a small portion of a powerful holy item. Back then, I obtained 22 of them.”

“Only 22?”

Wang Xian frowned slightly. After eliminating the Dragon tribe leader, the number of thunder-attributed holy feathers in his hands had indeed reached 22.

However, there were still 27 more to go before he could gather all of them.

“The remaining thunder feathers are on a powerhouse in the heaven-splitting chaotic land.”

The old man nodded his head.

“Heaven splitting chaotic land!”

Wang Xian’s pupils constricted slightly when he heard the name.

Legend had it that the heaven splitting chaotic land was the first continent in the universe. It was also the place where the first living beings were born.

That piece of land was incomparably vast. If one wanted to establish a foothold on that piece of land, one had to possess the strength of an intermediate race in the universe.

Many intermediate races in the universe were not even qualified to establish a race there.

“What realm were you at back then?”

Wang Xian continued to ask him.

“Benefactor, I was at the third level of a universe knight back then. I was able to fight two levels higher and fight against a level five universe Knight.”

The old man said.

“Oh? With such strength, I would be considered one of the top even among the dragon species.”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows.

“Benefactor, you know about the dragon species? Yes, my bloodline has unexpectedly reverted back to its original form.”

The old man nodded.

“Perhaps, you can evolve into a lightning dragon.”

Wang Xian glanced at the old man and said faintly.

“It’s good that I can live freely. I don’t need anything else. My lifespan is not long.”

The old man’s eyes dimmed. Even though he was powerful and possessed a powerful bloodline, he had lived for too long.

He had been alive for far too long.

So long that he was about to rot.

“Dragon King, it’s almost time to deal with the outside world.”

At this moment, Prime Minister Gui and the rest walked over and reported to Wang Xian.

“Eh?”

Prime Minister Gui and the rest looked at the old man with a look of surprise.

The old man looked at Prime Minister Gui and the rest with a hint of surprise.

What a pure divine dragon bloodline.

“This is an inferior dragon who was imprisoned here by the first generation leader of the Dragon Race.”

Wang Xian introduced him to Prime Minister Gui.

“Lei Ming!”

The old man introduced himself.

“Hello, I am Prime Minister Gui of the Dragon Palace. These are the leaders of the Dragon Palace.”

Prime Minister Gui nodded his head.

“Lei Ming will be a member of the Dragon Palace from now on. Let’s go back after settling this matter.”

Wang Xian said to them.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui and the rest nodded.

Wang Xian and the rest flew out of the treasury. They swept their gaze across the surroundings before they retrieved the five elements millstone and returned with Lei Ming.

“Huh?”

After returning to the Dragon Palace, Lei Ming looked around in astonishment. From his senses, all the members in the Dragon Palace possessed a powerful divine dragon bloodline.

Many of the bloodlines were even purer than when he was at his peak.

What kind of concept was this?

Those whose bloodline was purer than his were comparable to a genuine purebred divine dragon.

“Prime Minister Gui, Tally up all the gains and bring all the treasures over.”

When he arrived at the Dragon King’s Hall, Wang Xian sat on the dragon throne and ordered immediately.

This time, he had obtained a large amount of resources from the treasure vault of the dragon race.

The dragon race leaders also had a large amount of treasures in their divine realms.
