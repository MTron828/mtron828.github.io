Chapter 2919: asked for help from the Dragon Palace

“Huh?”

When Wang Xian heard the words ‘Invincible in battle technique’, he raised his eyebrows slightly.

He knocked on the table lightly and continued to watch ‘Invincible in battle technique’.

“Boss Wang, the glazed domain is not able to hold on any longer. The Machine Emperor Domain has held back a large number of their experts. Something almost happened to the chimei domain not long ago.”

“If it wasn’t for my invincible battle technique coming out at the critical moment and using the immortal slaying gourd and Venerable’s Scar Earth to control a group of treasures to kill two evil God emperors, I’m afraid the third Legion would have suffered heavy losses.”

“Cough, cough, I’ve said too much. The veluriyam domain requested the Dragon Palace’s support to help them resolve this crisis and offered a lot of rewards. Boss Wang, take a look. This is the list of rewards that the VELURIYAM domain gave me.”

Invincible in battle techniques said as he took out the list of resources and showed it to the camera. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up as he scanned the list.

The resources were mainly glazed double-colored stones. There were also five-colored stones and other treasures.

The rewards were indeed very generous.

If the Dragon Palace absorbed this amount of resources, it would be able to produce at least a dozen divine emperor-level powerhouses.

“It seems that the glazed domain has really encountered a crisis. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have taken out so many treasures.”

“Moreover, these treasures are only to help them tide over the crisis. I reckon that a dozen divine emperors would be able to settle it.”

Wang Xian thought to himself.

This deal could be done.

If the Dragon Palace wanted to produce a divine emperor-level powerhouse, it would probably take one to two years to produce one with the resources they had now.

This speed might be extremely fast for other domains.

However, it was very slow for the Dragon Palace.

As long as they helped the glazed area to tide over this crisis, they would be able to produce more than ten god-emperors. It was pretty good.

“Boss Wang, the powerhouse from the glazed area also said that if the dragon palace has any requests, they can ask for it directly!”

Seeing Wang Xian hesitating and not saying anything, invincible added.

“You can make requests?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and narrowed his eyes slightly.

“Alright, Invincible. Tell them that the amount of resources they provide can be reduced. However, the Dragon Palace wants all the corpses of Yaoxie that we have killed.”

“If they agree, I will bring the experts from the Dragon Palace over!”

Wang Xian said.

“Huala!”

When the grand supreme elders who were sitting around invincible in battle heard Wang Xian’s words, a hint of excitement flashed across their eyes. They stood up immediately.

“Dragon King, come over personally!”

A celestial thearch also let out a low roar in excitement. A hint of excitement flashed across his eyes.

The Dragon King was able to kill a wizard in an instant. In their opinion, the Dragon King’s strength should be close to their domain Lord’s.

If the Dragon King personally brought people over, then the rewards wouldn’t be much.

Moreover, it didn’t matter if the evil demons were to be given to the Dragon Palace. What they wanted was to get through this crisis. As for the evil demons’corpses, although they were worth a lot, they were already dead. What was the use of having these corpses.

“Invincible, immediately agree to the Dragon King. If the Dragon King is willing to personally bring people over, then we will definitely not give the dragon palace any less rewards!”

The Grand Supreme Elder and the rest looked at each other and immediately spoke to Wudi.

Wang Xian, who was in the video, heard his words very clearly.

“Alright, I’ll rush over now. Send me the coordinates of the planet closest to the Holy Region.”

“If the Dragon Palace is willing to help, I reckon that they will be willing to help as well if you invite the holy region.”

Wang Xian replied directly.

“Thank you for your help, Dragon King. We will be extremely grateful to you!”

The first Supreme Elder and the rest said immediately.

“Alright, I’ll hang up now!”

Wang Xian heard the gratitude from the other side and spoke to invincible battle technique before hanging up the call.

“Hehe, boss Wang is still very easy to talk to. With boss Wang’s help, let’s not talk about anything else. We can easily destroy the little demons and monsters!”

“Nine divine dragons coming over, even that demon will tremble!”

Seeing the video end, invincible battle technique raised his head slightly and said proudly.

“Hehe!”

The first Supreme Elder and the others smiled, feeling better.

“Invincible, I’ll give you an address later. You send it to the Dragon King. We’ll go over and personally welcome the Dragon King and the others.”

The first Supreme Elder and the others said.

“Okay, okay!”

Wudi Zhan nodded and suddenly narrowed his eyes.

“First Supreme Elder, senior celestial emperors, I’ve long admired you, Wudi Zhan. Can you take a photo with me?”

As Wudi Zhan spoke, he took out his AI and said with a smile.

“Uh, okay, okay!”

The godly monarchs of glazed domain were slightly stunned and immediately nodded.

It was just a photo. They would naturally cooperate with a child.

“What the hell are you doing?”

The godly monarchs of Shangshui saw his strange behavior and felt that this guy didn’t seem to be doing a good deed, so he asked him.

“What can it be, master? It’s just a photo!”

Invincible battle technique hurriedly explained.

After the photo was taken, he couldn’t help but laugh.

The Divine Emperors didn’t pay much attention to it and immediately reported the news to the domain Lord, preparing for the next thing.

Meanwhile, invincible battle technique opened his AI and looked at the photo of himself and the other divine emperors with the corners of his mouth slightly curled up.

“A bunch of little brothers, pay attention when you talk to me. Look at the photo of me and Your Divine Emperors just now, HMPH HMPH.”

“You scum, don’t be arrogant in my place in the future. I just contacted my boss Wang, Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. Do you know why you contacted the Dragon Palace?”

“Your glazed domain is in a crisis now. Ask the Dragon King for help and invite the Dragon Palace under my presence. The Dragon King is prepared to come over personally to help you. When the time comes, I will let you see the strength of the Dragon Palace and see the gap between you and the Dragon Palace!”

“Hehe, my boss Wang has arrived and easily settled the crisis in your Veluriyam Domain. In the future, be more obedient to me. I Am Your Savior!”

“Hehe!”

Looking at the words he edited, he could not help but laugh. Along with the group photo he just took, he sent it over.

In the VELURIYAM domain, countless people were mocking him under the first message of invincible in battle techniques. Seeing this message, everyone could not help but be slightly stunned.

…

“Prime Minister Gui, inform the disciples of the Divine Emperor of the Dragon Palace to prepare.”

At the position of the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian called Prime Minister Gui over and told him about the matter in the VELURIYAM domain.

“It’s the Dragon King. This time, the VELURIYAM domain is indeed a great opportunity for our Dragon Palace. If we can obtain a large amount of resources, it will be a great improvement for our Dragon Palace.”

Prime Minister Gui nodded his head.

“Yes. This time around, we can also learn more about the chimei territory and the machine royal territory.”

Wang Xian nodded his head. He already knew a little about the chimei territory. It was the demonic energy that had awakened on earth.
