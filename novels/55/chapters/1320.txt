Chapter 1321: 1322 crown prince

“It’s been a long time since a fifth level profound void martial artist appeared in the main hall. I wonder what that super powerful creature is?”

“Do you think that creature looks like a dragon? It’s too violent. It swallowed a 20-meter-long snake with its mouth!”

“A dragon? How is that possible? The dragon race has two wings. Do you think it’s a super bloodline expert from other seas who came to our place?”

“There is a very high possibility. When the bloodline is cultivated to the extreme, it can become a spirit and undergo the atavism. However, the possibility is very small. It should be a creature that lives on top of the main hall!”

“We should come back in a few months. If this creature comes out again, it will be dangerous. Oh right, I heard that the nameless sword demon killed more than twenty demonic beasts on the first floor. It is very powerful!”

“Yeah, a single person killed more than twenty demonic beasts in an instant. He even killed a second-level profound void martial artist in an instant. Moreover, he even killed some of cold sect’s people. I feel that the nameless sword demon’s strength is at least third-level profound void martial artist. He’s truly a monster, a Supreme Genius!”

At the exit of the main hall, some profound void martial artists walked out. The battle between the two terrifying creatures in front of the main hall had shocked many people.

This caused many people to escape from the main hall, afraid that they would encounter some danger.

“Haha, my level has increased. Finally!”

At the exit of the main hall, Wang Xian rode on his demon soul and flew towards the outer area of the human-demon graveyard.

Looking at his attributes and feeling the explosive power of his body, Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled with a five-colored radiance.

After devouring the demonic might venomous snake demonic beast, he had achieved a transformation with just a little bit of dragon energy.

He did not reach the half-step void interpretation stage and directly advanced to the first level of the void interpretation stage.

At the same time, it was also the third transformation of the Divine Dragon Transformation.

The breakthrough in his cultivation had allowed him to dominate the entire Liuhai region with his current strength.

With his current strength, he could easily kill a top-notch powerhouse at the fifth level of the void interpretation stage in his divine dragon state.

Even if he could not defeat a powerhouse at the sixth level of the void interpretation stage, he could still escape.

It has been more than a year since I came out. It’s time for me to return

Wang Xian thought to himself.

“Speed Up!”

He shouted softly. The demon soul beneath him immediately increased its speed and galloped rapidly.

Sitting on the demon soul and overlooking the entire human-demon graveyard, Wang Xian revealed a faint smile.

When he came here, he was just an insignificant weakling. He didn’t even dare to fly in the sky.

But now, a dragon was roaming the world.

“I have been in the main hall for more than half a year. I wonder if Zhang Fengying is worried!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. Soon, the place where he was staying appeared in his sight.

Wang Xian’s figure moved. He jumped down from his demon soul and took off his mask before flying into the courtyard.

“You are finally back!”

Zhang Fengying heaved a sigh of relief when she saw Wang Xian flying straight into the courtyard. She looked at him with a smile on her face.

“HMM, I have been gone for a long time this time. I have made you worried. Rest for a day. I will bid farewell to Long Xiaotian and we will return to the Dragon and Phoenix Empire!”

Wang Xian said to Zhang Fengying with a smile.

“Long Xiaotian?”

Zhang Fengying looked at him and took out an invitation card from her interspatial ring. “If you’re two days late, you might not be able to make it in time. This is long Xiaotian’s invitation card!”

“Two days later, the Light Dragon Empire will establish the crown prince. On that day, the Light Dragon Empire will hold a sacrificial ceremony in the tomb of the demi-human and confirm the future heir of the Kingdom!”

“Long Xiaotian said that the position of the crown prince this time will definitely be his. He wants you to come and watch the ceremony!”

“Oh?”

Wang Xian took the invitation card that Zhang Fengying gave him and revealed a smile on his face. “Have you started to confirm the position of the Crown Prince? Alright, let’s wait until he becomes the crown prince before we return.”

In more than half a year’s time, after Wang Xian helped him to eliminate the subordinates of a few of his brothers, Long Xiaotian’s position was unshakable.

At that time, the position of crown prince had basically been decided.

During this period of time, many experts came to seek refuge with him. There were even three insightful emptiness realm experts who came to seek refuge with him. Among the group of crown princes, they were absolutely invincible.

“It’s up to you. I can go back anytime!”

Zhang Fengying smiled at him.

“Alright, I’m going to rest. I haven’t rested for half a year. This time, I’m going to sleep for more than ten hours!”

Wang Xian waved his hand at Zhang Fengying and walked into the room.

Zhang Fengying nodded at him.

...

“Wow, there are so many people today!”

“Of course! Look at what day it is today. It’s the day that the Radiant Dragon Dynasty establishes the crown prince. This is the future king of the Radiant Dragon Dynasty. How can there be fewer people?”

“As long as the entire Radiant Dragon Dynasty has some powerful families, the rest of the major forces in the Liuhai region will come to watch the ceremony!”

“Every time the Light Dragon dynasty selects a crown prince, it is extremely grand, especially this year!”

“This time is special. This year, the one in charge of the ceremony is not the royal family of the Light Dragon Dynasty, but the second Prince!”

“It is obvious that they have already expressed their opinions. Although it is not the time for the real announcement, the position of the crown prince is 100% that of the second Prince!”

“Now, the second Prince’s forces are also very powerful. He has five insightful void martial artists under him, and one of them is at level two of the insightful void martial artist. With his strength, he can crush everyone else!”

Two days later, in the morning, Wang Xian rested for more than ten hours before heading to the island of the Radiant Dragon Dynasty with Zhang Fengying.

When he arrived at the outer perimeter, he realized that there were tens of thousands of people in the surrounding sky.

They came from the various influential families of the Radiant Dragon Dynasty. They were powerful mercenary groups.

As long as they were qualified, they would all rush over.

On the day of the crown prince, it meant that the future king would be confirmed. The family mercenary groups of the Light Dragon Dynasty would naturally come to pay their respects.

They even had to send a congratulatory gift.

Apart from the Light Dragon dynasty, as one of the top forces in the Liuhai region, the other countries, sects, and mercenary groups would also come to watch the ceremony.

As one of the top figures in the Liuhai region, they also had to come and get to know each other.

Today, it was a very big event for the entire Liuhai region.

“TSK TSK, it really feels like thousands of people are coming to pay their respects!”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the surroundings. There were Seethrough experts everywhere as he spoke with a smile on his face.

“Let’s Go!”

He moved his body and flew inside.

The place where the heaven worshiping ceremony was held was located above the island of the Guanglong dynasty. A huge place was built with a formation.

A huge cauldron was erected in the middle.

Tables and benches were set up in the surrounding void. It looked extremely majestic!

In the middle, there was a huge entrance. Every participating force had to take out an invitation card to attend the ceremony.

Wang Xian’s figure moved and flew towards the entrance.

The line that entered was very long. It was a few hundred meters in front of them.

Other than the members of the royal family of the Guanglong dynasty who entered directly from the island, everyone else had to enter through the main entrance.

“Haha, Cousin is really amazing. The position of crown prince. In the future, we can be considered as real royal relatives!”

“Of course. Seven months ago, Cousin’s position as the crown prince was basically confirmed!”

“In the Guanglong dynasty, our Hua family’s position will be greatly elevated in the future!”

While Wang Xian was slowly queuing up to enter, a few excited voices suddenly came from behind.
