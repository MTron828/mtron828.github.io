Translator: 549690339

“Thank you for your understanding, Lord Dragon God!”

The two old men cupped their hands at Wang Xian and walked out.

“Blood Arrow Snow Demon, ten years ago, you raised Gu with tens of millions of people. Now, you want to raise Gu with two million people. Cruel people like you deserve to die!”

The two old men walked out of Wang Xian’s encirclement. They turned their heads with cold eyes and flew into the distance without any reluctance.

“We will not continue to accompany you in your madness!”

“You two traitors!”

The snow demon and blood arrow looked at the two figures who flew away without any hesitation and roared with a ferocious expression.

The two immortals on their side actually ran away.

They fled right before the battle.

Moreover, before they left, they even said that they deserved to die.

This caused the snow demon and blood arrow to almost vomit blood. They stared at the rapidly disappearing figure with a ferocious and violent expression.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian let out a chuckle. “It’s just the two of you now. I’d like to see how the two of you are going to escape!”

The blood-red eyes of the snow demon and blood arrow stared at Wang Xian as their bodies trembled violently.

The two of them were fighting against six immortal gods. Although their strength had already reached the level of a god.

However, the experts of the Dragon Palace immortal gods could not be described with common sense.

Under normal circumstances, a God could suppress four inferior gods.

However, it was already considered good that they could suppress two Dragon Palace Immortals. Three immortals could suppress or even kill them.

Furthermore, Wang Xian’s strength was comparable to a god.

“Now, I’m going to take your lives. This is the consequence of your sneak attack on us!”

“Kill!”

Wang Xian roared. His divine dragon body moved and attacked the snow demon directly.

Ao Qitian followed closely behind Wang Xian and attacked the snow demon.

Prime Minister Gui, Ao Jian, and Ao Qi moved and instantly rushed towards the blood arrow.

As for Ao Demon, he had already disappeared into the air. No one knew where he was. He would launch a fatal attack at the most suitable moment.

“Run!”

“Run! We have to run! Lord Wind Demon and the others have escaped as well. Lord Snow Demon and Lord Blood Arrow are finished!”

“We have to run away from here. We have to run away from the cauldron of Yu. We have to go somewhere else. We have to go to the Jianghu!”

Below, when the disciples of the Jade Hand Immortal sect and corpse Chief Dao saw the two old men leave, they were completely devastated.

Six Immortals came to kill their sect leader of the Snow Demon Blood Arrow sect while the other two immortals ran away.

The consequences of their sect leader’s actions could be imagined.

All the immortals of the immortal sect were either dead or running away. All the experts of the immortal sect were also killed.

Why were they still here if they were not going to run away.

In an instant, more than two million disciples of the Jade Hand Immortal sect and the Snow Demon Immortal sect were running away frantically like ants.

“Ahhh, even if I have to die, I will not let you have it easy!”

The Snow Demon’s face revealed a violent expression. Her snow-white arms turned pitch-black instantly. She waved her arms, and terrifying demonic qi arms attacked Wang Xian like ghostly hands.

“HMPH!”

Wang Xian waved his dragon claws. Water Energy condensed into dragon claws, and thousands of dragon claws attacked instantly.

“Roar, Take This!”

Ao Qitian’s ten-meter-long ocean-pacifying divine needle smashed heavily at the snow demon.

The Snow Demon’s expression changed drastically, and he immediately felt a strong pressure.

What made him even more terrified was that the snow-white demon had disappeared into the air, and he did not know where it was.

He had to guard against the sudden attack of the white demon.

This made him afraid to release all of his power, and he vigilantly sensed his surroundings.

Meanwhile, Blood Arrow, who was at the side, was even more terrified. He specialized in demonic arrows, and the demonic arrow in his hand had once pierced through an immortal god. It was incomparably terrifying.

What made him terrified was whether it was the old man holding the turtle shell that easily blocked his demonic arrow.

Or that terrifying golden color that was sharp and golden, or that lightning creature that caused one’s scalp to go numb.

“Piercing the heart, devouring the God, killing the Immortal!”

Blood Arrow roared and pulled his arm. The blood-colored longbow in his hand instantly shot out three arrow feathers that emitted a terrifying demonic aura.

“Lightning Spear!”

Ao Qi waved his left hand. His entire arm was instantly covered in lightning, emitting a terrifying explosion sound.

The three lightning spears directly met the three black arrow feathers.

“Crack Crack Crack Crack!”

The Lightning Spears directly pierced through the three arrow feathers. The pitch-black arrow feathers actually dimmed at a terrifying speed.

In the end, although it didn’t melt, the attack power on it couldn’t even kill an infant stage cultivator.

“Lightning Hammer!”

Ao Qi’s lightning hammer pointed in the air, and bolts of lightning struck out. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“What powerful Lightning Control!”

Prime Minister Gui and Ao Jian revealed a trace of shock on their faces, and they didn’t stop what they were doing.

Under his control, the 100-meter-tall mountain directly flew into the air and smashed towards the blood arrow.

Ao Jian’s body moved for a moment. In an instant, numerous metal swords appeared around him.

The metal swords were silent and extremely terrifying.

In an instant, the blood arrow was suppressed everywhere.

“Water ripple of the Great Waterfall!”

“Sea Chaos!”

At this moment, Wang Xian and ao Qitian’s roars came from the side.

The water of the great waterfall rippled and enveloped the area within a radius of ten kilometers. The Snow Demon was instantly covered.

However, the terrifying demonic aura supported the space of a thousand meters.

However, AO qitian was holding the ocean-pacifying needle in his hand, which was used to stabilize the sea.

Similarly, there was another terrifying effect, which was the cholera of the sea water.

With a wave of the ocean-pacifying needle, the water of the great waterfall rippled violently in one direction.

In an instant, Wang Xian’s great waterfall was actually able to work together with AO qitian.

The ocean-pacifying needle attacked the snow demon. With the terrifying power of the seawater, it was as if the entire ocean was being brought down with it.

“PFFT!”

In an instant, the terrifying power caused the snow demon to retreat a few thousand meters. It could not help but spit out blood.

“Whoosh!”

However, at this moment, the snow demon felt a great sense of terror.

He dodged to the side in fear.

“Puchi!”

“Huh? He actually managed to dodge his vital parts!”

Wang Xian looked over and was slightly stunned. However, he smiled immediately after.

One of the Snow Demon’s arms was severed.

“Scram! Die!”

The snow demon used all of his strength in grief and indignation and attacked the AO demon.

The white light pointed at the void and the Ao Yao disappeared into thin air.

The Snow Demon was stunned for a moment. It felt a sense of collapse and despair.

“Take This!”

Ao Qitian roared again. Wang Xian waved his dragon claw and the water energy was attached to the ocean-pacifying divine needle.

The energy of the entire waterfall was attached to it. A force that could make immortals tremble smashed towards the snow demon.

The only remaining arm of the Snow Demon was placed in front of him, emitting a black light. Its eyes were filled with despair and fear.

“Boom!”

The terrifying power smashed down, and his body was smashed into the island at a terrifying speed, sinking into a depth of a hundred meters.

He widened his eyes, which were filled with regret.
