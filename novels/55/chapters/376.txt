Chapter 377: Bloodbath (3)

As part of the sightseeing area of Sky City, the architecture around the Sky Mountain was mesmerizing.

At a staggering 142 meters above the sea level and stretching three kilometers in length, there were nine meandering passes along Sky Mountain laid with treacherous paths. At the foot of the mountain lay the famous Great Stone Buddha Statue, Cliff Inscriptions, Crane-flying Pavilion, Crane-coming Pavilion, Crane-drinking Fountain, Xinghua Zen Temple of the Ming Dynasty, Great Scholar Rock of the Qing Dynasty, Shanxi Assembly Hall, Water Pavilion and Yubei Pavilion, among others.

The place seemed particularly quiet, given that there was no one at the Sky Mountain, which otherwise was usually bustling with life.

“It’s up ahead, behind this mountain crest,” a voice could be heard saying. Meanwhile, a young man was pushing a wheelchair with a young maiden in it while they were accompanied by four others and a dog.

It was Wang Xian’s group of six.

“It’s been three days since the excavation of the Ancient Tomb. To think that the objects inside have yet to be retrieved. Seems like what’s stored within could be very valuable items,” Xiao Yu exclaimed with a smile as she looked ahead.

“Hmm. Let’s go take a look. Perhaps we might even obtain a few treasures!” Wang Xian replied with a grin. As he did, he pushed the wheelchair along, which seemed rather effortless, much thanks to the tiled floor laid neatly in brick patterns within the Sky Mountain regions.

They passed by one of the pavilions while on their way up the mountain crest.

“Members from three Ancestral Sects and two Clans have entered. I wonder who the treasures inside will belong to?” a voice asked.

“The Nine Lotus Sect is the most formidable amongst them. Plus they have two Miracle Doctors from the Sacred Followers Guild. So that makes them the most likely!” one guessed.

“But the Liuyun Family is no weaker in abilities. With two Inborn experts, they are also very likely to obtain the treasures once they’re inside!” another speculated.

“Tens of people have died, one after another, in the past few days. Including five Half-step Inborns. Those must be some really precious items inside!” the third exclaimed.

“The treasures inside belong to us, Nine Lotus Sect!” the last boasted.

As Wang Xian and the group arrived behind the mountain crest, they heard the commotion from the crowd. Wang Xian looked to the front.

A group of close to eighty people had gathered around. From time to time, they would peer into the underground cave which was situated right in the middle where they hovered.

The underground cave measured more than a dozen meters wide as it extended all the way down, making it hard to see how deep the cave actually stretched.

Along the opening of the underground cave stood about twenty people, who wore synchronized outfits from the same Ancestral Sect. As they stood watch, they fixed their gaze on the nearby crowd to prevent anyone from entering.

The arrival of Wang Xian and the gang had not drawn any attention. As he looked across, his focus eventually landed in the direction of the group which donned the Nine Lotus Sect attire.

In comparison to the rest who had gathered around, the location occupied by the Nine Lotus Sect was obviously much more comfortable.

More than a dozen chairs and tables were lined out beneath numerous parasols which stood by the sides of the members.

Meanwhile, several people were seated while having tea by the tables as they waited in silence.

“Huh?” Wang Xian uttered as he glanced over in a particular direction, with eyes narrowed.

It was a familiar figure, an enemy of the past.

Miracle Doctor Fang Huazi.

Upon the sight of this figure, a look of confusion and suspicion swept across Wang Xian’s face.

Fang Huazi was currently seated beside a young man, while his arms, which had been previously maimed by Wang Xian, were now dangling aimlessly.

Yet, the Fang Huazi of now was all smiles while he sat, as though having lost mobility in both arms was something to rejoice about.

“Elder bro, that’s the young man!” Xiao Yu pointed out. She glared at the young man who was seated beside Miracle Doctor Fang Huazi with eyes of fury. He was the young master of the Nine Lotus Sect.

“Let’s head over!” Wang Xian gestured while looking at the young man. He seemed to be in his thirties, as he exuded an aura of the experts while projecting an image of confidence and arrogance.

Well-loved and highly respected, he was the renowned young master of the Nine Lotus Sect.

The term “Young Master” was rarely coined within Ancestral Sects, while it was more common in clans.

And this position was much more esteemed than that of Saint and Saintess.

“Young master of the Nine Lotus Sect, born with gifted talents. Having achieved the Inborn status at the mere age of thirty-four. It is acclaimed that he will be able to surpass that in his surviving years. Ranked the fifth on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart, his prowess is reputed as a notch above that of the Saint and Saintess from the Sacred Sects!” Wang Xian explained. As he spoke, he wheeled Xiao Yu along towards the location of the Nine Lotus Sect members.

“Huh? Who’s that?” a voice asked.

“Is that...?” another trailed off.

In that instant, Wang Xian’s voice drew the attention of everyone nearby. They looked the group up and down, after turning over in surprise.

“That’s the young maiden from several days ago!” someone pointed out.

“It’s her indeed. I heard that she’s a Saintess from a Second-class Force, although her gift in cultivation is very astonishing. She’s already a Half-step Inborn at such a tender age!” another gasped.

“Pity though. No matter how gifted, she exchanged hands with the young master of the Nine Lotus Sect. The prowess of a Half-step Inborn is still very far off from an Inborn. She’s since been completely maimed by him,” another sighed.

At the sight of Xiao Yu, who was now in a wheelchair, along with Wang Xian and the rest who stood behind them, the crowd looked on in a state of bewilderment.

“What are they doing here?” the crowd of experts whispered amongst themselves.

The attention of the young master from Nine Lotus Sect and Fang Huazi, both of whom were currently seated beneath the parasols, was drawn over. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“They’re really here. Haha. Haha!” Fang Huazi laughed upon seeing Xiao Yu in a wheelchair. This was followed by his intense gaze of animosity when he spotted Wang Xian pushing the wheelchair.

“Miracle Doctor Fang Huazi, so that’s Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown?” the young master of Nine Lotus Sect asked. He had not been too surprised by the appearance of Wang Xian and the group, but returned them a condescending look.

“That’s right, he’s the one!” Fang Huazi replied with hatred in his eyes. His face darkened when he saw Xiao Yu in the wheelchair. “To think he’s really got some skills, being able to mitigate the effects of such lethal poison!” he snorted.

“Haha! Miracle Doctor Fang, although she’s regained consciousness, it appears she’s now incapacitated!” the young master of the Nine Lotus Sect mocked, as he laughed at Xiao Yu.

“I see,” Wang Xian uttered in realization, looking at them. They were laughing away in a discussion of Wang Xian and the group without the slightest regard.

It was because of Fang Huazi that this Nine Lotus’ young master had resorted to attacking Xiao Yu with such lethal poison.

Fang Huazi was exacting revenge for those maimed arms of his.

“The antidote!” Wang Xian uttered the words coldly, as he demanded it of Fang Huazi with an indifferent look.

“Antidote? Haha!” Fang Huazi laughed before he stood up. “You want the antidote? It was a fair exchange, and the loser should bear the consequences. What about it? And yet you’re here for the antidote?” He gloated with a grimace.

“When you maimed my arms and when my master spoke to you back then, why didn’t you mention antidotes?” Fang Huazi fired back. “And now, you’re here for the antidote? Young lad, this is what you call ‘treating others the way they have treated you,’ don’t you know?” he added.

“Let me be clear. Even if there’s an antidote, you’re not getting it. Moreover, this poison does not come with one haha!” he continued thereafter.

“Do you know that we, the Sacred Followers Guild, obtained this poison by chance? It’s a poison that no one in this world can neutralize. Not even our Sect Leader of the Sacred Followers Guild, nor the world’s most formidable Miracle Doctor. This poison comes with no antidote!” Fang Huazi concluded. And then he sneered, “Haha! Haha!”
