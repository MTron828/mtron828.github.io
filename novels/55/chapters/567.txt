Chapter 568: The Two Shocked Girls (2)

“Scammer up there, you better get down here right away!”

The young girl with ponytails held her belt sword and resembled a furious kitten. While walking up furiously, she shouted.

Huh?

Wang Xian retrieved the last Bo Yu sword from it and revealed a satisfied expression.

In the end, he heard the shouts of the young girl with ponytails right away.

Wang Xian raised an eyebrow.

“There’s nothing up here in this wretched place. Where’s the blacksmith master?”

At this moment, the young girl with ponytails appeared on the second floor. She walked into the room where Wang Xian was while observing the surroundings.

Other than two tables and two benches, there was nothing else on the second floor.

“Hey, scammer! What tricks are you up to?”

The young girl with ponytails held her sword at Wang Xian as she demanded, “Where’s Sister Xue’s Bo Yu sword?”

Behind the young girl with ponytails, the other girl was clearly unhappy when she saw the short sword in Wang Xian’s hands was still kept within the scabbard.

“You are here at the right time! It’s done!”

Wang Xian wasn’t bothered by the young girl’s fury as he threw the Bo Yu sword to the other girl.

“It’s done?”

The other girl was doubtful as she caught her short sword.

Swish!

A crisp sound reverberated as the short sword was drawn from the scabbard!

Huh?

Huh?

Two exclamations broke out as the girls looked at the Bo Yu sword.

Swish!

As she swung her arms around lightly, snowflake-like miniature Bo Yu swords appeared on the main Bo Yu sword.

“It’s restored. Oh my god! It’s really restored!”

The other girl beamed with excitement as she moved her hands over the previously broken spot with disbelief.

“Sister Xue, this... Is it really fixed?”

The young girl with ponytails by the side was astonished as she stared blankly at the Bo Yu sword in the other girl’s hands.

“It’s indeed Bo Yu sword. Moreover, there’s no difference from the one I’d been using previously.

The other girl was agitated. She moved her palm slightly and controlled Bo Yu sword to rotate it above her palm.

Snowflake-like miniature Bo Yu swords appeared, making it extremely captivating.

“Eh! Something isn’t right with the sword hilt?”

At this moment, the other girl felt something amiss with her Bo Yu sword. She grabbed onto the hilt of the sword right away as she examined the hilt immediately.

Doubt flashed in her eyes.

“Did he do something to it!? As I said, he’s definitely up to something. This is a scam! A scam!” The young girl with ponytails rumbled on instantly and stared harshly at Wang Xian.

“Bo Yu sword has indeed been restored!”

Wang Xian faced the young girl with ponytails and continued, “As for the sword hilt, there are six layers in it which I can restore anytime you wish. I was wondering if this lady here is interested in purchasing some weapons!”

As he spoke, his gaze shifted to the other girl.

“Bo Yu sword has indeed been restored. As for the sword hilt, it’s not a huge matter. It’s just...”

The other girl lifted her head and looked at Wang Xian with shock and doubt. “What are you trying to sell me?”

“Give me the sword!”

Wang Xian extended his hands towards the girl as he spoke.

The girl didn’t hesitate at all and handed Bo Yu sword to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian shifted his palm and the six miniature Bo Yu swords, roughly the size of two fingers, shot into the sword’s hilt.

He held Bo Yu sword in his hand before swinging it.

Weng!

The Bo Yu sword was triggered and six miniature Bo Yu swords shot ahead.

The next moment, they rotated and returned to the Bo Yu sword.

The entire process lasted for only seconds.

Wang Xian held the Bo Yu sword upright and manipulated the six miniature Bo Yu swords to circle around the main sword.

“I have used the remaining materials to forge six Level 11 miniature Bo Yu swords!

“These miniature Bo Yu swords can form a set with the main sword. In battle, you could have more variations in attacks!” Wang Xian explained. The next moment, he flicked the six miniature Bo Yu swords away.

Weng!

Just as the miniature Bo Yu swords fell on the ground, the main Bo Yu sword dazzled in blue light. The next moment, the six miniature swords returned to the main sword.

“I wonder if this lady is interested in purchasing these six miniature swords?”

Wang Xian looked at the girl and spoke with a smile.

“This... This...”

At this moment, the girl was dumbfounded. Her eyes were fixed on the miniature swords circling around the main Bo Yu sword. Astonishment was written all over her face.

“This... You...”

She was incoherent. She knew clearly after using the Bo Yu sword for over twenty years.

Now that there were six additional miniature Bo Yu swords, just the attacking aspect would be several times stronger.

Moreover, these six miniature swords were all Level 11 spiritual equipment!

Level 11 spiritual equipment!

Although weapons used for sneak attacks were relatively cheaper, that was only a relative concept. Level 11 spiritual equipment was still Level 11 spiritual equipment!

The most crucial point was Wang Xian had made the six miniature Bo Yu swords to be a set with the main Bo Yu sword!

Naturally, she knew how incredibly strong set weapons were!

An entire set of weapons could greatly enhance one’s strength.

Although the six miniature swords were different from the typical armor-type equipment, they could still greatly enhance her attacking potency.

“These were all created by you...?”

When the girl spoke, she immediately realized how dumb her question was.

There was no one else other than him in the entire shop. Just a while ago, they were still doubting if this was all just a scam.

“This young man is a blacksmith master! Moreover, he’s a great blacksmith master!”

Astonishment flashed across the eyes of the girl.

She had seen many geniuses and supreme talents in Yong Chang world. In fact, she was widely regarded as one of them.

Yet, she was still deeply shocked to see such a young blacksmith master.

How long had it been? Just over ten minutes?

In this period, he had restored her spiritual sword. This was something that the famous Master Xuanhuo couldn’t even restore! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

What was the most insane was that he had even forged six other miniature swords to make them into a set.

This incredible refining technique was comparable to the work of God.

“What do you think?”

Upon hearing that girl, Wang Xian smiled and responded.

“What? You... You... You really are a blacksmith master?”

The young girl with ponytails widened her eyes as she stared with disbelief at Wang Xian.

A young man like him is a blacksmith master?

This isn’t a scam?

Instead, this was a shop opened by an insanely incredible blacksmith master?

“Would this lady like to purchase these six miniature swords?”

Sensing the fervent looks on the girl, Wang Xian asked once again with a smile.

“Yes. Quote me a price!”

Just as he finished his question, the girl answered resolutely.

“The value of a set of weapons isn’t comparable to ordinary spiritual equipment after all. However, you are my first customer. I’ll charge you the market rate for each miniature sword!” Wang Xian replied to the girl directly.

“Market price? Alright!”

The girl nodded her head without a moment of hesitation. Purchasing these swords at the market price was definitely a great deal!

“Level 11 equipment used for ambushing is roughly five thousand spiritual stones each. Since there are six, it will be thirty thousand spiritual stones!”

As Wang Xian spoke, excitement beamed in his eyes!
