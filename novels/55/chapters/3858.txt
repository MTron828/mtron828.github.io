The eight level seven gods were not as lucky as Wang Xian.

They were attacked by a crystal creature.

The strength of this crystal creature was about the same as the crystal creature that Wang Xian had dealt with back then!

With the strength of the eight level seven gods and the starfield fragment in their hands, they were able to kill it in an extremely short period of time.

“What kind of creature is this? Isn’t there only a Space Beast in the Universe?

How can there be such a creature? And it’s so powerful?”

After the eight level 7 gods killed it, they looked at the corpses that were suppressed by the Starfield fragment and let out a sigh of relief.

The battle just now had shocked them a little about the crystal creature’s speed. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Its strange speed was like teleportation.

It could even enter the crystals and disappear.

If they did not have the starfield fragment, it would be very difficult to kill it.

“If this crystal creature was stronger, the starfield fragment would not be able to kill it. ”

One of the tier 7 gods said with a serious expression.

Even if they had dealt with this trouble,.

This was still the first creature they had encountered, and it was already so powerful.

Was there an even stronger existence inside?

The other seven gods also nodded with grave expressions.

“Let’s go. Be careful from now on.”

One of the tier 7 gods said.

The eight of them continued to walk forward.

However, this time, they became even more vigilant.

Their speed had also been reduced by several levels.

“This won’t do. The faith tracking is about to disappear! ”

Half a month later, one of the Tier 7 gods raised his head to look at the tracking energy in the sky and spoke.

The other seven gods also revealed helpless expressions.

The faith tracking energy had already been used up.

If they wanted to continue tracking, they had to use it again.

However, this tracking ability wasn ‘t something they could succeed with just a few of them.

This chasing ability required a huge amount of faith power.

It required at least a few million legions to successfully use it.

But now, the legions that they believed in the universe couldn’t step into this ocean.

Because of the star chain, they couldn’t leave this place.

“Let’s stick to our original plan. Even if we don’t move, we’ll still have to waste time here. ”

One of the gods said.

This was also the order of the elders of the 24 palaces in the universe.

(‘We can’t waste time either. Let’s slowly search here.”

One of the gods looked at them.

The other seven nodded and continued to fly in the direction of the faith tracking.

However, without the guidance of the faith tracking, it would be thousands of times more difficult to find the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.

The celestial chain, the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin destiny, was too terrifying!

Even if it was a fragment of the Heaven’s origin destiny.

Time passed little by little.

Wang Xian told Lan Qingyue about the situation here.

He asked Lan Qingyue not to come here for the time being. Instead, she would bring Xiao Lan and the rest to continue their advancement.

When Xiao Lan and the rest had broken through, she would come here to save him.

Then, she would destroy the eight level seven pantheon gods.

After Lan Qingyue received the news, she nodded her head heavily and immediately led Xiao Lan and the rest to search for resources and treasures to advance.

Ten million years passed in the blink of an eye.

During these ten million years, Wang Xian successfully nurtured another soul item.

The soul spear that was destroyed by the fragments of the Starfield was also replaced.

During these ten million years, the eight gods did not pursue him.

Halfway through, Wang Xian tried to get an lie to bring him back, but he still failed.

This meant that he was still in this blockade.

Wang Xian guessed that this blockade was not unsolvable.

A powerful force could break this blockade directly.

However, he did not have the power at the moment, so he could only wait.

During these tens of millions of years, the Dragon Palace was developing at a terrifying speed.

After obtaining the million-strong army that Wang Xian brought back for an lie and the heart of faith, the improvement of the disciples of the Dragon Palace was almost without any shackles.

There were over 80,000 gods in the million-strong army.

There were over 100 rank seven gods.

This made the improvement of the Dragon Palace extremely terrifying. In tens of millions of years, there were 200 Dragon Palace powerhouses who were at the level seven realm.

However, all of them were charming dragon species.

There were also over 50,000 powerhouses at the level of the ruler. This was even before the heart of faith was exhausted.

The improvement of the Dragon Palace was absolutely terrifying.

In the past 10 million years, the war between the belief universe and the nine-origin universe was getting more and more intense.

Especially a few million years ago, the army of belief from the belief universe arrived. For a time, the nine-origin universe was in a great crisis.

At this time, the peak races also unleashed their powerful trump cards and strength.

Because of Wang Xian, only the 13 palaces of the 24 palaces had the power to clash with the peak races of the nine-origin universe.

This also prevented the experts of the nine-origin universe from being defeated.

However, the battle was not too intense.

All the plans of the 24 palaces were disrupted by Wang Xian.

If not for Wang Xian, the 24 palaces would have destroyed the nine-origin universe long ago!

This also gave the nine-origin universe a chance to catch its breath.

The Dragon Palace did not participate in this battle.

Wang Xian ordered all the disciples of the Dragon Palace to focus on improving their strength.

This was also because the Dragon Palace did not have top-notch combat strength at the moment.

Lan Qingyue and Xiao Lan were working hard to improve.

He was trapped here.

This also meant that the Dragon Palace did not have the combat strength of a ruler at level eight.

Neither did they have the combat strength of a ruler at level nine.

Secondly, the Dragon Palace did not lack the heart of faith at the moment.

If they had the time to fight, they might as well go to the depths of the starry universe and search for some treasures.

Furthermore, Wang Xian had destroyed the million-strong army of the Heaven Origin Palace in the universe of faith.

In terms of combat results, the Dragon Palace had killed the most gods of faith in the entire nine-origin universe.

Moreover, if he had not delayed the power of the belief universe, the nine-origin universe would have been defeated!

Time continued to pass.

In the blink of an eye, another ten million years had passed. Wang Xian tried again to leave this place, but he still did not succeed.

Thirty million years passed very quickly.

Wang Xian wandered around the area in boredom.

During these thirty million years, he accumulated the energy in his body and tempered the energy in his body.

In the middle, Guan Shuqing and the rest of the girls had accompanied him here for a million years. They weren’t too bored.

Compared to the past, his control over his own energy and combat experience had improved by a lot.

“Let’s go to the right. I’ve already checked the left side. The right side belongs to the depths of this crystal region. ”

In the past 30 million years, Wang Xian would occasionally explore the surroundings.

He had already explored the left side. That was the location of the exit. Compared to that, it was safer.

However, he was prepared to explore the depths to see if he could find any treasures..
