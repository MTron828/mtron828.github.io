2703 At the 2703 Heroes’meeting

“With your status and strength, who would dare to Pester You?”

Wang Xian came to a room in the courtyard and sat there with a smile on his face.

“Of course, no one else would dare to. However, this fellow’s identity is not simple.”

The empress shook her head and said.

“Oh? What identity? You are the Empress of the current generation of the imperial court.”

Wang Xian asked curiously.

“That guy’s identity is simple too. He is a member of the night clan on the Night Cold Island. His father has risen to power in his old age and is also the son of an old man. He is the leader of the night clan and a peak-stage immortal king. His grandfather is also a peak-stage immortal king. In addition, there is an elder at the peak-stage immortal king stage above him.”

“Right now, the night clan is the dominant force on the Night Cold Island. It can be said that they are the strongest force other than the imperial court.”

“As for young emperor Ye, no one dares to offend him on the Night Cold Island. He’s used to being arrogant. Even I can’t go too far with someone like him.”

The Imperial Star Lady said.

What she didn’t say was that her father had a good relationship with the night clan.

Although she didn’t recognize her father, in the eyes of the other experts of the imperial court, she was still her father’s daughter.

“Oh? Ye clan of the Cold Night Island, are you looking for trouble for me?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly and said.

“Hehe, no matter how powerful the Ye clan is, we still have to see who this handsome man in front of us is. He’s the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. He’s the leader of the Dragon Palace who defeated the world margin sect. How can a disciple of the younger generation be on par with our Dragon King?”

“It’s our Dragon King who killed Young Emperor Ye. How dare the Night Clan Wage War against the Dragon Palace? HMPH, they don’t even dare to do so.”

The Celestial Emperor Lady poured a cup of tea for him and said with a smile.

“Hehe, more tea!”

Wang Xian leaned back on the chair and took a sip. Then, he said faintly to her.

“Alright!”

The Celestial Emperor Lady immediately added with a smile on her face.

Just like what the Empress Star Lady said, no matter how awesome young Emperor Ye was, he was still an eternal god Lord level existence.

He was on a completely different level from Wang Xian.

The night race was very strong. There were even five or six peak immortal king level powerhouses. However, they still had to be more cautious when facing the Dragon Palace.

If Wang Xian really killed young Emperor Ye, the night race might not dare to start a war with the Dragon Palace.

After all, once the war started, there would be more than one or two people who would die. Even immortal king level powerhouses would have to die in the tens of thousands.

Tian Ya was a lesson learned from the past.

“Alright, I’m here mainly to check on the situation here. If it’s not too dangerous, I’m prepared to kill some powerful abyssal seeds in exchange for some medicinal pills.”

Wang Xian said to Di Xing nu who was beside him.

“I’ve told you all the information I’ve received. You can send someone over to check it out.”

Di Xingnu sat at the side and took out some food as she spoke to Wang Xian.

“Okay.”

Wang Xian nodded.

“Xingnu.”

At this moment, a voice came from outside.

“Huh?”

Di Xingnu was slightly stunned when she heard this voice.

“Senior sister, please come in.”

She immediately opened her mouth and said.

“Xingnu, there will be a hero gathering in the next few days. We will go over there when the time comes. Eh, this is?”

Five to six middle-aged women walked in from outside.

They were talking to the celestial maiden when they suddenly saw Wang Xian beside them. They were slightly stunned.

“Greetings, Dragon King.”

The few of them obviously knew Wang Xian. They immediately cupped their hands and greeted him respectfully.

“Who are they?”

Wang Xian looked at the celestial maiden beside him and asked in puzzlement.

“Wang Xian, these are the senior sisters of the imperial court. They are also the former celestial maidens.”

“In fact, there is a huge difference in our seniority. However, we address each other as senior sisters.”

“I am fighting with a group of senior sisters now. They are also taking care of me.”

The imperial star ladies whispered to Wang Xian.

“Hello!”

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly.

The six ladies in front of him were the strongest immortal king level seven. Each of them looked graceful and luxurious, as if they were the empress of the world.

...

The former empress was once a dazzling existence.

The current Emperor Star Lady had completely left her generation’s circle, forming a circle with the previous ones.

With the support of the Dragon Palace and the Space Beast, the Emperor Star Lady with unlimited potential was naturally very popular, and the previous ones took good care of her.

“Seniors, please take a seat, what will happen to the heroes?”

The Emperor Star-lady looked at the six of them and said.

“Star-lady, the hero will be held in three days by some powerhouses of our imperial court.”

“Many powerhouses will come in the next few days. Some powerhouses of our imperial court want to recruit some powerhouses through this opportunity.”

“Of course, even if it’s cooperation, it’s also a good opportunity for some powerhouses of our imperial court...”

One of the middle-aged women introduced to the Imperial Star Lady.

The Hero Guild was a platform for the powerhouses of the imperial court to communicate with the powerhouses outside. If they were lucky, the powerhouses of the imperial court could recruit some powerhouses to be their subordinates.

Even if they were unlucky, they could find some powerhouses to work together as partners.

...

It was better to work together to hunt abyssal seeds than to work together with themselves.

And those foreign powerhouses also hoped to establish some relations with the powerhouses of the imperial court, and also hoped to obtain more information from the powerhouses of the imperial court. Therefore, most of the foreign powerhouses would come over.

“Our team will see if we can recruit some subordinates or partners.”

The middle-aged woman said in the end.

“Well, then we will go and take a look.”

Emperor Star Lady’s eyes sparkled as she nodded her head.

“Mm, with your current limelight, I reckon there will be many people willing to seek refuge with you.”

“However, since the Dragon King is here, it doesn’t matter if there are people willing to seek refuge with you.”

The middle-aged women said as they looked at Wang Xian and said with a smile.

“No, I have to rely on myself too.”

Emperor Star Lady shook her head with a smile.

“Then we won’t bother you and the Dragon King!”

The six of them smiled and walked out.

“How’s the harvest during this period?”

Wang Xian watched them leave and asked Emperor Star Lady. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Hehe, not bad. I killed two level 7 immortal king Abyss species and five level 6 immortal king Abyss species. Unfortunately, my battlefield snake is too big and basically relies on the four big brothers of the Dragon Palace.”

Emperor Star Lady said with slight embarrassment.

Although her gains were huge, she had basically been watching the four members of the Dragon Palace from afar in these few battles. She had no way to intervene.

On the contrary, the members of the Dragon Palace had to take care of her to prevent her from being attacked.

“Who asked you to be so weak? Just kill some immortal King Abyss seeds. Don’t take any risks.”

Wang Xian reminded her.

“I know. Don’t worry. I know my limits. Are you going to the hero’s meeting in three days? It’s fine if you want to watch the show.”

The Empress asked him.

“We’ll see when the time comes.”

Wang Xian said. He wasn’t too interested in the hero’s meeting. His main purpose these few days was to investigate the situation in the abyss.
