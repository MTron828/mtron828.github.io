Chapter 582: Saint Forge Workshop Is Indeed Trash (2)

Swish!

Ka ka ka!

As the bad-tempered middle-aged man spoke, he stood on the horse carriage and waved his arm at it.

A gust of strong wind opened the boxes on the horse carriage. With an extremely brazen and unruly expression, he shouted loudly, “Do I need Saint Forge Workshop, the place for scams, to refine my spiritual equipment and elixir pills? In my eyes, you guys are trash!”

You guys are trash!

The middle-aged man from Tianwen Sect was brazen and arrogant.

Standing on the horse carriage while he was on the most prosperous street in Yong Chang City, he shouted loudly to everyone that Saint Forge Workshop was trash!

Few people in the entire Yong Chang City would have the guts to say such words.

This was because with the strength and capabilities of Saint Forge Workshop, people might die laughing because of what you said.

Yet, this middle-aged man stood on his horse carriage and opened up the six to seven boxes directly.

In these boxes were various pieces of spiritual equipment and elixir pills packed tightly together.

This scene truly shocked everyone around.

It was especially so for the group at the entrance of Saint Forge Workshop.

The employees of Saint Forge Workshop.

The few middle-aged men from Mt. Zhenliu.

And the people in charge of several other forces.

They were astonished to see the various pieces of spiritual equipment and elixir pills on the horse carriage of Tianwen Sect. Their eyes widened and they clearly couldn’t believe what they were seeing.

“This...!” That employee from Saint Forge Workshop was dumbfounded. His expression changed rapidly and he shouted coldly, “Tsk! You guys are deceiving yourselves, or trying to deceive us, after finding a batch of spiritual equipment and elixir pills and passing them off as those refined by an alchemist master and a blacksmith master! How interesting!”

“Tianwen Sect is really laughable. Did you guys find a batch of elixir pills and spiritual equipment to prove to us how dumb you guys are?”

The middle-aged men from Mt. Zhenliu remarked sarcastically.

“Hehe! You guys can choose not to believe us. That’s is expected as you guys are too arrogant!”

The middle-aged man with long hair looked across the crowd coldly. In the end, his eyes fell on the few forces standing by the side. “Our Tianwen Sect isn’t free and silly to that extent. These were refined by an alchemist master and blacksmith master we found yesterday. They can be found in a shop a short distance away. The prices they are charging are also a lot lower than the Saint Forge Workshop!”

Huh?

The leaders of several forces frowned instantly and were clearly hesitating.

“Do you really mean it?” an old man asked the middle-aged man with long hair.

“If we are lying to you guys, may our Tianwen Sect be annihilated!” the middle-aged man with long hair replied.

Huh?

Huh?

Huh?

The reply from the middle-aged man with long hair shocked the entire crowd.

A deadly vow like this wasn’t to be joked about.

“Is there really a shop with an alchemist master and blacksmith master?” Surprise beamed in the eyes of that old man as he pursued it further.

“Are you guys still thinking that I’m joking? Let me bring you guys there. Once you are there, you guys will know Saint Forge Workshop is a pile of trash!” the middle-aged man commented solemnly.

“That... In that case, I’ll be troubling you!”

The in-charges of several forces were excited and greeted the middle-aged man with long hair!

“Haha! Let’s go!”

The five men from Tianwen Sect laughed proudly, turned their horse carriage around and headed towards Wang Xian’s shop.

The leaders of several forces followed behind without any hesitation.

“Other than our Saint Forge Workshop, which others shop in Yong Chang City would have an alchemist master and blacksmith master? This couldn’t be possible. Those people from Tianwen Sect must be up to something!”

The employees of Saint Forge Workshop were extremely gloomy. After seeing the crowd that left, they reported to the shop immediately.

“Let’s go take a look!”

The group of middle-aged men from Mt. Zhenliu exchanged glances and were clearly suspicious of the whole incident. “Let’s follow them and see what tricks they are up to!”

“Let’s go!”

A group followed behind the five men from Tianwen Sect.

“Hehe! We have brought huge businesses for that master this time!”

“If news of master’s shop was to get out, would there still be a Saint Forge Workshop? As compared to the master’s shop, it’s clear that they are overcharging the customers!”

“That’s right, that’s right!”

The five men from Tianwen Sect grinned.

Wang Xian’s shop was less than a thousand meters away from Saint Forge Workshop. In less than three minutes, the crowd had arrived at the entrance of the shop.

“Come, follow us!”

The five men from Tianwen Sect jumped off the horse carriage and spoke to the people in charge of several forces behind them.

Huh?

The group of seven to eight people looked across and was stunned. They looked blankly at the shop the five men had entered.

“This..”

“Would this be the shop of a master?” That old man opened his mouth in shock.

“Let’s go in now!”

A middle-aged man hesitated for a moment before following the five men from Tianwen Sect.

“Master, master!”

When the five men from Tianwen Sect entered the shop, they didn’t see Wang Xian. They immediately shouted for him.

“What’s the matter?”

At this moment, Wang Xian was refining elixir pills.

“Master, we have brought you some customers. Would you like to meet them?”

The five men from Tianwen Sect greeted him respectfully.

“Oh? Bring them to the second floor!”

He wasn’t done with the elixir pills before him and thus couldn’t leave the second floor.

“Yes, yes!”

The five men from Tianwen Sect nodded their heads. They turned to the in-charge of the several forces, smiled and said, “Follow us to the second floor!”

Huh?

The people in charge of the several forces looked around the shop and frowned deeply. They looked at the people from Tianwen Sect and were a little curious. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Among the people from Tianwen Sect, there was a Budding Realm expert. Yet, he was still being so respectful a while ago.

In the entire Yong Chang world, other than the Immortals, only a master was deserving of such respect.

The seven to eight of them had no hesitation as they followed the five men from Tianwen Sect to the second floor.

“Isn’t this a little too run-down. Why would a master be...?”

With questions in their mind, the group headed to the second floor.

However, they were instantly shocked by what they saw on the second floor.

It was still roughly the same thirty square meters of space. What could they have seen?

There were various boxes filled with various materials.

A box full of Level 11 metals, boxes of Level 6 spiritual medicines...

This deeply shocked them.

Each of them was the in-charge of one of several forces in Yong Chang world. Although they might not be among the elite forces, they were definitely not weak.

However, if one was to ask them to take out such an amount of materials, they wouldn’t be able to do so.

Yet, they were placed casually in boxes on the second floor.

“These materials were from the Mu Family. Don’t speak and wait for the master to complete his refining!”

The five men from Tianwen Sect were pleasantly pleased when they saw the group behind them dumbfounded by what they were seeing.

The crowd looked towards the master in the middle with shock and awe.

However, their eyes widened once again as disbelief overwhelmed them!
