Chapter 1325: 1326, I will kill you today

“My Cold Sect’s subordinates, help me ascend to the position of Crown Prince!”

A Roar and a response shook the entire sky above the ceremony.

Tens of thousands of people stared dumbfoundedly as more than a thousand cold sect’s experts stood behind Long Xiaotian, sweeping their imposing auras over everyone.

On the stage, all the princes’hearts trembled, including Long Xiaotian’s.

He looked at the experts of the Frost sect, tightly clenching his fists.

This was simply not on the same level.

The Frost sect had existed for thousands of years, possessing a historical foundation that was not inferior to the Light Dragon Dynasty. who could resist such a powerful sect submitting to the eighth Prince?

He, Long Xiaotian, was very strong, and his subordinates were also very powerful. However, compared to the Frost sect, there was a huge difference.

In fact, the two parties were not even on the same level.

The other party was more than thirty insightful emptiness realm experts!

On the stage, a group of important ministers and generals of the Light Dragon Dynasty, as well as a few elders of the jury, were also shocked when they saw this scene.

If Long Xiaoyun inherited the position of crown prince, Han Zong would be the power of the Light Dragon Dynasty. This was a huge benefit to the light dragon dynasty.

“The position of crown prince tests one’s strength, influence, and results. Long Xiaotian, just now, you were the heir of the crown prince. Now, I want to challenge you!”

“Come, let’s compare our strength, influence, and results. Do You Dare?”

Long Xiaoyun stared at Long Xiaotian, the corners of his mouth curling up slightly. He stared at long Xiaotian with an ice-cold gaze. He raised his head slightly and looked at long Xiaotian as if he was looking down on him.

Long Xiaotian looked at long Xiaotian looking down at him so arrogantly. He clenched his fists tightly and his expression was extremely ugly.

On the stage, the eyes of the king of the light dragon dynasty flashed when he saw this scene. He did not say anything.

Below, regardless of whether it was long Xiaoyun or long Xiaotian, they were both his sons. Regardless of which son was outstanding, he was very happy.

The position of crown prince was held by those who had the strength. The eighth Prince had a great opportunity, so this position was the eighth Prince’s.

“Come, come, let’s have a competition of strength first. I can let you bring your level 1 profound void tier pet!”

Long Xiaoyun raised his head and pointed at long Xiaotian as he said proudly.

“Eighth brother, you are too arrogant!”

Long Xiaotian’s expression was ugly as he stared at Long Xiaoyun with sparkling eyes.

“Haha, arrogant. Of course you can be arrogant if you have the strength. Second Brother, you were also very arrogant back then. I support eighth brother. As for the position of prince, those who have the strength will occupy it. Then, let’s compete in strength, influence, and results!”

“I also support eighth brother. Back then, how arrogant were you and that Wang Xian brat? He actually attacked us directly. HMPH!”

“That’s right. Back then, you killed eighth brother and all of our subordinates. Today, it’s Your Turn!”

Before long Xiaoyun could reply, the first prince, the sixteenth prince, and the twenty-second prince, who were standing at the side, approached him with sparkling eyes. They stared at long Xiaotian and said coldly.

Seven months ago, Wang Xian had slapped them in the face in public. However, Long Xiaochen and the rest had always held a grudge against him.

However, Wang Xian was powerful. Furthermore, the second prince wanted to inherit the position of the Crown Prince. There was no hope for him to take revenge.

However, they never expected that the eighth Prince would lead a terrifying force to descend directly and Crush Long Xiaotian.

This made them extremely happy.

Furthermore, this was the best time to build a good relationship with the eighth prince.

From the perspective of his terrifying force, the future throne would belong to the eighth Prince!

“Alright, Alright. Let’s fight then. I want to see what kind of opportunity you have obtained by entering the origin light dragon pool. HMPH!”

“Do you really think that I, Long Xiaotian, am afraid of You? !”

With a gloomy face, he jumped onto the dodo bird and stared coldly at Long Xiaoyun.

“Haha, fine, fine!”

Long Xiaoyun waved his hand, and the experts of the Frost sect behind him immediately retreated dozens of meters.

Long Xiaochen and the other princes also hurriedly retreated to their surroundings.

“Second brother, eighth brother, stop right there!”

On the stage, the king of the Light Dragon Dynasty said in a deep voice with an expressionless face.

“It’s father. I definitely won’t hurt Second Brother!”

Long Xiaoyun respectfully cupped his hands and said with a face full of confidence.

“This eighth prince is so confident. You should know that Long Xiaotian has a level 1 insightful void realm mount, the Dodo bird!”

“Yeah, could it be that his strength is even stronger than the dodo bird? What kind of powerful opportunity did this eighth prince obtain in the Origin Light Dragon Pond?”

Everyone looked at the eighth Prince and the second prince on the stage in shock.

After the eighth Prince’s subordinates were all killed by Wang Xian, they entered the origin of Light Dragon Pool in anger.

There was a slim chance of survival in the origin of Light Dragon Pool. However, the ancestors of the Light Dragon Empire did rise up because of the origin of Light Dragon Pool.

Everyone focused their attention on the area below. They wanted to see how much the eighth Prince’s strength had increased.

What kind of opportunity had he obtained.

“Second brother, I’ll call you second brother in the end. Keke, I’m going to make my move!”

Long Xiaoyun raised his head slightly and looked at long Xiaotian as he spoke arrogantly and contemptuously.

Even though Long Xiaotian was riding on the insightful void Mount, he still did not put it in his eyes.

“Long Xiaoyun, don’t be arrogant!”

Long Xiaotian looked at his contemptuous expression and a trace of anger appeared on his face. His body moved, and the Dodo bird he was riding directly emitted a dazzling white light.

Numerous sharp white wings attacked him directly.

“Keke, you’re too weak. Don’t think that you can become a prince just because of that Wang Xian. In my opinion, all of you are useless!”

Long Xiaoyun’s eyes were extremely cold when he saw the wings of light attacking him.

“Die!”

He stood there and didn’t move at all. He waved his arm.

A light claw, a pale light claw, directly attacked the Dodo bird under Long Xiaotian.

The wings of the Dodo bird immediately collapsed when they collided with the claw. The pale light claw instantly entered the body of the Dodo bird.

“Chirp, chirp, Chirp!”

A shrill cry instantly resounded through the entire sky.

The Dodo bird, which was flying in the air, instantly died!

“What? How is this possible! ?”

Long Xiaoyun, who was standing on the Dodo bird, did not even have time to react. He stared blankly at the Dodo bird that had lost its vitality in an instant.

“No, this is a level 1 insightful void realm Dodo bird, this...”

He widened his eyes and his body fell downwards. In the midst of losing his soul, his body staggered slightly.

“Oh my God, how is this possible? A Level 1 insightful void realm Dodo bird was killed in an instant. Eighth prince... What kind of strength is this! ?”

“He killed the insightful void Beast in an instant. The eighth Prince’s strength is at least at the second rank of the insightful void realm, or even higher...”

“How is this possible, how is this possible!”

“What kind of opportunity did the eighth prince obtain to possess such powerful strength? This strength is simply heaven-defying in the younger generation!”

When everyone in the surroundings saw the battle that ended in an instant, their eyes widened in disbelief.

Instant Kill!

Instant End!

On the stage, some of the important ministers and generals of the Guanglong Dynasty even stood up in shock!

“You’re just a piece of trash, even if you have a pet of the first level of the Seethrough Void Tier!”

Long Xiaoyun looked down at the dazed Long Xiaotian in front of him coldly.

His gaze suddenly turned towards the position on the stage. His gaze was filled with killing intent as he stared at Wang Xian.

“Next, it’s a competition of forces. Without the help of the people from the Frost sect, I alone can destroy all of your forces!”

“You, Wang Xian, get down from there. Long Xiaotian is able to reach this stage because of you. The reason why I am able to reach this stage is all because of you!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Haha, didn’t you say that you wanted to help him become the Crown Prince?”

“Today, I will kill you!”
