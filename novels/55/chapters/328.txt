Chapter 329: Indomitably Haughty

“No! Ah! Save me, Grandpa!” a scream shrieked from the training field of Heavenly Sound Sect.

Along with the blood-curling scream came an explosive blast.

The zither of the Vice Sect Leader had been destroyed with a single palm-strike. When the crowd saw what had happened, they gasped and cringed in fear.

The faces of the six Inborn experts fumed with rage when they saw the Abyss assassins approaching.

“Courting doom!” one of them hollered.

Zing, zing, zing!

As melodies began to play, countless wind blades, water droplets, demonic snakes and golden needles were fired out from the musical instrument.

Howl!

Right then, a growl from the Divine Dragon came blasting through the air. Following which, an Inferno Divine Dragon situated itself in front of the six Inborn experts, blocking them.

Flames torching like molten lava came spewing out of the Inferno Divine Dragon, which put a direct stop to all the attacks.

In the same moment, Hu Qingqing gazed ahead at Mo Yuan in utter despair. “Ah!” she cried while taking steps back.

While the two Half-step Inborns beside Hu Qingqing broke out in a cold sweat, neither of the young men dared to take a step forward.

“Die!” Mo Yuan roared. Without the slightest hesitation, his fingers transformed into Claws of the Devil Dragon, as he struck at Hu Qingqing in a bid to attack.

Ack, ack, ack!

As Hu Qingqing landed on the ground, she coughed with a weak voice void of hope while she stared, eyes wide in terror.

Even on the brink of death, she didn’t have the slightest clue as to who from the Abyss she had killed, and why they got rid of her so menacingly.

She had been radiating with glamour on the stage of the training field just a while ago, with high hopes of vying for the position of Saintess. And yet, the same Hu Qingqing now lay motionless and lifeless on cold ground.

“Abyss, you’re goners. I’ll get rid of you all!” the Vice Sect Leader of the Heavenly Sound Sect roared. As he burst with fury, bouts of demonic aura gushed from the training field and shot skyward.

Clang, clang, clang!

Just then, a frantic melody started to play and it boomed throughout the Nine Peaks Mountain. It had come from the musical instrument held by the Leader of Heavenly Sound Sect.

Tweet, Tweet! Tweet, Tweet!

Upon two chirps, two birds swooped over from individual mountain peaks, surging as quick as fighter planes as they flapped their gigantic wings.

“Trespassers in the Heavenly Sound Sect shall die!” a voice hollered, as numerous shadows came darting out of the Nine Peaks Mountain. Upon emerging, they flew over short distances.

It was seven Elders who had flown out, each gripping onto a musical instrument and exuding a terrifying aura as they did.

Especially so for the elderly lady who emerged atop the most central peak, who displayed an air of dignity with a sparkling zither in her arms.

Leaving their mountain peaks, the experts landed on the training field. They were joined by the two giant birds, which measured up to five meters with wings spread open, as they gazed down upon Wang Xian and gang. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

With icy stares and gnawing claws, the birds were ready to attack any time.

“Abyss assassins, you guys are indeed savage. With guts to barge into the sacred grounds of our Heavenly Sound Sect, you can forget about leaving here today. For you shall be buried within our grounds for eternity!” said the elderly lady flatly. With her zither in hands, she swept her gaze across Wang Xian and gang.

“Haha! Seems like the Heavenly Sound Sect’s bent on keeping us here till our deaths, with no means to compromise huh?” Wang Xian asked. In a cold demeanor, he surveyed the fourteen Inborn experts.

“Did you think you could leave, after killing our Sect members?” the elderly lady asked without the slightest cringe on her face. She remained expressionless despite being face to face with the renowned Abyss.

So what if they are the Abyss? The Heavenly Sound Sect hath no fear!

“Haha! With just the few of you?” Wang Xian let out a laugh. With a deathly stare, he continued, “Those with the guts to kill members of the Abyss must be prepared for death. Should the Heavenly Sound Sect dare to intervene, then let’s have a fight. We’ll see who’s to be wiped out first!”

As Wang Xian’s obnoxious statement trumpeted throughout the entire Heavenly Sound Sect, the entire senior management could not help but narrow their eyes in fear.

They took a look at the formidable seven-metered Inferno Divine Dragon, which currently stood in front of the Abyss assassins. Thereafter, they eyed the particular Abyss member, recalling how he had just destroyed the Vice Sect Leader’s zither with a single palm-strike. To which, their faces stiffened in vigilance.

They were obnoxious beyond tolerance for challenging the Sect to see which party would first perish. This made them either lunatics or powerful opponents.

All around, the Heavenly Sound Sect disciples watched on in silence, as cold sweat trickled down their foreheads.

“Huh?” the elderly lady expressed out of perplexity. She frowned upon hearing Wang Xian’s words.

“Supreme Elder!” the Leader of Heavenly Sound Sect greeted as he walked over to the elderly lady, placing a booklet in her hands.

Her face twitched as she scanned through the records in the booklet. Her slight surprise was now replaced with anger in her eyes. “Is this information reliable?” she asked.

“It was the Abyss who tossed them over!” the Sect Leader replied.

“Check! Deploy all manpower from our Heavenly Sound Sect, and check thoroughly on this matter! Check, even if it should cost any lives!” the elderly lady snapped in a rage.

To think that a candidate had resorted to employing assassins to get rid of competitors, in order to vie for the position of Saintess... This was a taboo to the Heavenly Sound Sect.

Utterly shocked, the rest of the sect disciples stared at the Supreme Elder. They were clueless about what had caused such anger from the Supreme Elder.

“Even should our disciples from the Heavenly Sound Sect have erred, it’ll be up to us to handle it. By stepping onto the Sacred grounds of our sect to commit murder, you Abyss really have no regard for us, have you!?” the elderly lady rebuked blatantly, tossing the booklet at the Sect Leader.

“Haha! Let me tell you, old fogey. We’ve already killed your men. Should you dare stop us, we’ll let the Heavenly Sound Sect run in a bloodbath!” Wang Xian fired back at the elderly lady. Slightly agitated, he glared at the rest of the Sect.

On the other hand, Mo Qinglong, Mo Yuan and the rest of Wang Xian’s gang were oozing with bloodthirst. Having massacred over a thousand Dark Conjurers previously, each of them had come with blood-stained hands.

When their thirst for blood was unleashed, it was more than enough to spark terror.

As for Wang Xian, he too was exuding a strong aura of the Divine Dragon, which shot straight ahead for the senior management of the Heavenly Sound Sect.

With his prowess on full display this time, even the air had intensified as it began to sizzle.

The ground below Wang Xian’s feet began to crack apart, and as it did, the crack widened and extended northwards.

Roar!

The Inferno Divine Dragon let out a growl before it descended in front of Wang Xian and transformed into a smaller, one-meter dragon.

The dragon rested its head on Wang Xian’s shoulder while staring right ahead at the crowd with its cold and emotionless eyes.

The air of invincibility was enough to spook the senior management from the Heavenly Sound Sect.

“Such stance!” the elderly lady panicked in a brief moment of fear. She could feel an element of fire sizzling up all around her. She even had the hunch that the surrounding air would begin to burn, should that particular one from the Abyss will it to.

“Dan Realm, he must be an expert from the Dan Realm!” an elder standing not too far away mumbled with a burdened look.

“They’re unrivalled, given that Laozu’s currently away!” the Leader of Heavenly Sound Sect squeaked softly. Having figured out Wang Xian’s abilities, a tinge of fear flashed across his eyes.

“What is it? I’ve already killed your men. Aren’t you going to strike?” Wang Xian asked as he gazed past all the Inborn experts from the Heavenly Sound Sect.
