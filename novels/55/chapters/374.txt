Chapter 375: Bloodbath (1)

Zing!

Wang Xian ejected the Wood Dragon Ball of the Wood element from his mouth and into his hand after looking at Xiao Yu and Elder Fang, who were lying in bed.

As he bent forward, Wang Xian placed the Wood Dragon Ball into Xiao Yu’s mouth, which proceeded to enter her body.

Instantaneously, the Energy of the Azure Dragon transferred itself from the Wood Dragon Ball into Xiao Yu’s body. This returned some blush to her otherwise pale face.

“Xiao Yu, I’m your elder bro!” Wang Xian called out to Xiao Yu softly.

“Huh?” Xiao Yu uttered before she opened her heavy eyelids to look at Wang Xian.

“Elder bro, you’re here. That’s wonderful. I thought...I’d ever see you again!” Xiao Yu struggled while managing a smile.

“That won’t happen, Xiao Yu. If you want to see me, you can do so anytime!” Wang Xian coaxed as he rubbed Xiao Yu’s head gently.

“Elder Bro, I won’t die, will I?” Xiao Yu asked Wang Xian weakly.

“You won’t. With elder bro around, you’ll always be safe and sound, Xiao Yu!” Wang Xian assured Xiao Yu with a determined look. “Rest assured, I’ll help you recover!” he affirmed.

“Hmm! You’re the best elder bro!” Xiao Yu smiled before she turned over to look at Elder Fang who was beside her.

“Elder Bro, please treat my master as well. She was injured because she tried to save me. So you have to treat her!” Xiao Yu pleaded with Wang Xian as she looked back.

“Don’t worry, both of you will be fine!” Wang Xian promised confidently.

After a brief moment of hesitation as she stood by the side, Sun Lingxiu ejected the Illuminating Pearl, which she’d obtained prior, from her mouth, and placed it into Elder Fang’s mouth.

As both the Wood Dragon Ball and Illuminating Pearl possessed formidable healing powers, they could help the duo in regaining consciousness.

“Huh?” Elder Fang awoke gradually. As she did, she looked on at Wang Xian and the rest in confusion, while her delicate face beamed with a smile.

“Miracle Doctor Wang, Sect Leader, Xiao Yu!” Elder Fang called out.

“Prepare some food!” Sect Leader Tang instructed immediately as he spoke to a female disciple of the Thistles and Thorns Sect.

“Don’t worry, I’ll make sure you recover!” Wang Xian promised Elder Fang while facing her.

“I believe in your medical skills, Miracle Doctor Wang!” Elder Fang accepted with a beam.

“Hmm!” Wang Xian nodded with ease.

As the exchanges between Wang Xian, Xiao Yu and Elder Fang ended, the female disciple of the Thistles and Thorns Sect came back with two bowls of porridge.

Wang Xian watched as the duo finished their food before he stepped out with a burdened look.

With Sect Leader Tang following behind, the two came to the living room situated at the level below.

“Sect Leader Tang, could you elaborate on the details?” Wang Xian asked with a dull expression as he sat on the sofa alongside Sect Leader Tang.

“Four days ago, Xiao Yu and Xian Fang were back at the Sect Ground to discuss some matters. They happened to receive news about the discovery of an ancient tomb. Interested, they went over to see if they could recover any treasures. In the end, they were attacked by the young master of the Nine Lotus Sect, and struck by lethal poison!” Sect Leader Tang explained.

“According to the information I’ve obtained, it was the young master of the Nine Lotus Sect who made lewd remarks towards the duo, which led to Xiao Yu exchanging counters with him. In the end...”

“Nine Lotus Sect?” Wang Xian uttered with a cold stare, as savage intention flashed across his eyes.

“They’re a First-class Force, with five Inborn experts within their Ancestral Sect, renowned throughout the Liuyun Province. I am to blame for my inability...I couldn’t exact revenge for them. So I could only wait for your return, Miracle Doctor Wang!” he explained in humiliation.

This was the sorrow of small Sects, where they could only bow down in silence after having suffered at the hands of the big Sects. They could only swallow the humble pie, even if their disciples were being murdered by the latter. Otherwise, the entire Thistles and Thorns Sect would be wiped out, should they offend the big Sects.

This was also the reason why Sect Leader Tang had hoped for the Thistles and Thorns Sect to ascend and become a First-class Force. Should there be an Inborn expert within the Ancestral Sect, the situation would no doubt improve by leaps and bounds.

“Where’s the Sect Ground of the Nine Lotus located?” Wang Xian asked Sect Leader Tang with a heavy look.

“It’s within the First-level divisional area of the Liuyun province. But right now, members of the Nine Lotus Sect are all gathered at the ancient tomb of Sky City. It’s the burial ground of an expert, where highly treacherous traps have been laid. They’re still there!” Sect Leader Tang explained. “There are currently numerous experts from several Ancestral Sects and Clans who’ve gathered there!”

“Hmm!” Wang Xian nodded in acknowledgment before turning to look at Mo Yuan, who stood at the side. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Young Master, this is the information I’ve gathered over the past two days!” Mo Yuan said as he proceeded forward. At which point, Sect Leader Tang made his exit mindfully.

“Here’s the information on the Nine Lotus Sect, Young Master! As you were not around, I did not proceed with anything on my own!” Mo Yuan continued.

Wang Xian took a look at the information on the Nine Lotus Sect before asking, “As of now, how many amongst the Dragonians have attained Inborn status?”

“There are four, excluding my master and myself. Four Dragonians have ascended to reach the Inborn status. Within another month, all members of the Dragon Sect will be able to attain Inborn status!” Mo Yuan answered. “Should I get them over, Young Master?” he asked.

“No need, I’ll see to this personally!” Wang Xian declined flatly. He wanted those with the guts to hurt Xiao Yu this badly to know the meaning of trepidation and despair.

Mo Yuan’s heart skipped a beat upon hearing Wang Xian’s words.

Young Master rarely acts personally. He would never trouble himself if matters could be delegated to us. Seems like someone is going to be down with very bad luck.

When nightfall came, Wang Xian returned to Xiao Yu’s room to check on the duo.

They may have regained consciousness under the sustenance of the two Dragon Balls. But while they were awake, sitting up was the most they could manage, as their limbs remained entirely immobile.

Wang Xian’s heart ached at the sight of Xiao Yu’s plight, which added to his fury.

At dawn the next morning, when the sun had just risen, Wang Xian came into Xiao Yu’s room. His heart ached again as he brushed her head gently while looking at her as she woke with a dazed look.

“Xiao Yu, would you like to come along with me? I’ll exact revenge for you!” Wang Xian asked.

“Elder bro, he tricked me. He said he’d only use one hand, given his prowess as an Inborn. But, after he started fighting with me, not only did he use both hands, but he attacked me with poison!” Xiao Yu said with a face of spite.

“Silly lass!” Wang Xian exclaimed as he caressed Xiao Yu’s head. “Elder bro will exact revenge for you. Come, follow me!” he continued. Thereafter, he bent over to scoop Xiao Yu up before turning to face Elder Fang and asked, “Elder Fang, will you be joining?”

“No, I’ll pass. Bring Xiao Yu along!” Elder Fang declined with a smile.

“Sure!” Wang Xian nodded before he proceeded downstairs with Xiao Yu in his arms.

Mo Qinglong had a wheelchair placed at the foot of the stairs.

“You’ll have to move around in a wheelchair for the next couple of days. It’ll be fine once Elder Bro has neutralized the poison in your body!” Wang Xian consoled Xiao Yu with a smile as he sat her in the chair.

“Hmm, no issue Elder Bro. Other than being unable to move my body, I don’t feel hurt anywhere!” Xiao Yu assured Wang Xian with glee. She was obviously in much better spirits now.

“Great. Let’s go!” Wang Xian signaled as he pushed the wheelchair from behind, accompanied by Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue on either side.

Sun Lingxiu did not follow along, but instead remained behind to take care of Elder Fang. Whereas Mo Qinglong and Mo Yuan followed behind the quartet.

At the same time, the Heavenly Hound tagged alongside Lan Qingyue.

After carrying Xiao Yu into the caravan, the group set off with Mo Yuan driving in the direction of Sky City.
