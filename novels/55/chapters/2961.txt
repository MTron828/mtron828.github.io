Chapter 2962: Dragon Palace upgrade

After Wang Xian’s upgrade not long ago, the five elements millstone already possessed the combat strength of a level two void God Emperor.

However, this was still of little value to Wang Xian.

Let alone upgrading the five elements millstone to a level three void God Emperor, he could even upgrade it to a level four or five void God Emperor.

Of course, with his current strength, it was still insufficient for him to upgrade the five elements millstone to a level higher than him.

!!

In half a month’s time, he made the five elements millstone devour some double-colored glazed stone and raise it to the level of level-three void celestial thearch.

With the help of the five elements millstone, Wang Xian could unleash an even stronger offensive power.

Furthermore, even without Wang Xian’s control, the five elements Millstone was able to fight against a level-three celestial thearch alone.

Following that, Wang Xian began to create the Tai Chi Dragon Disc!

It was a little troublesome to create the Tai Chi Dragon Disc. Wang Xian wanted to use the rainbow colored glazed stone as the foundation.

However, the rainbow colored glazed stone had seven attributes. Firstly, he had to separate the other five attributes.

If it was anyone else, it would be impossible to do so.

However, Wang Xian, who possessed seven attributes and the heart of light and darkness, could do it.

Although it might take a long time.

In the following period of time, Wang Xian concentrated on building his second divine weapon, the Tai Chi Dragon Disc.

Time passed day by day. A year was just a snap of the fingers for a divine emperor who had a lifespan of over a hundred million years.

During this one year, the glazed domain, the holy domain, the Imperial Star Domain, the Heaven Wizard Domain, and the eight desolations six directions were completely connected.

Now, everyone in the Emperor Star region knew about the azure glass region.

The Heaven Punishment Ancient Sky region was only popularized. Only by purchasing this type of artificial intelligence could it be connected. It wasn’t completely connected.

But even so, it was still able to close the distance between the various regions in the entire resplendent starry sky.

Some sensational news could quickly spread throughout the entire resplendent starry sky.

What was worth mentioning was that invincible in battle techniques became a famous person in the entire starry sky.

It couldn’t be helped. This guy’s background was too deep, and he liked to meddle in other people’s business. He also had very terrifying fans.

He was also known as the most powerful second generation in the starry sky.

He was jokingly called the dragon father behind him!

And during this one year, the Dragon Palace truly became the overlord of the entire starry sky. The Dragon King was also the true king of the starry sky.

There were even many experts who claimed that the Dragon King was the ruler of the starry sky.

Even the various celestial thearchs smiled when they saw this statement. They all admitted that the Dragon King was the ruler of the starry sky.

“Phew, I’ve finally succeeded!”

At this moment, Wang Xian, who had not appeared for a year, was in a demon cave. He looked at the Tai Chi Dragon disk in front of him with excitement in his eyes.

The Tai Chi Dragon Disk was a stage three tai chi dragon disk of the void God realm.

It was about the size of a mirror and could change freely. On the left and right sides were the shadows of a divine dragon.

One side was a dark divine dragon while the other side was a light divine dragon.

However, the eyes of the dark divine dragon were bright while the eyes of the light divine dragon were dark.

The two divine dragons interweaved and formed a tai chi shape!

Buzz

Wang Xian moved his arm and the entire tai chi dragon disc changed. The two ink-like divine dragons separated and rotated around Wang Xian.

However, once Wang Xian was in danger, the two ink-like divine dragons would immediately merge together to form a tai chi divine dragon to block the attack.

The Tai Chi Dragon Disc could hover around him at all times. It didn’t require Wang Xian to control it and would automatically defend itself.

The two ink-like divine dragons were hovering around him. It was simply a cool special effect that kept circling around him. It was so cool that he had no friends.

“It’s a little too cool. Hehe!”

Wang Xian looked at the ink-like divine dragons hovering around him. His face was full of smiles.

Not only was the Tai Chi Dragon Disc Cool, its defense was also very terrifying.

At the very least, Wang Xian could guarantee that if he stood there and didn’t move, a level three divine emperor powerhouse wouldn’t be able to break through their defense.

The large amount of dual-colored stones had elevated the tai chi dragon disc to the limit of this realm.

“TSK TSK, it’s good to have a large amount of resources!”

Wang Xian mumbled.

“Dragon King, good news. We have found a light-attributed lair in the sixth demon lair!”

At this moment, a piece of good news came. An Lie’s figure appeared beside Wang Xian and reported to him.

“Oh? You found it?”

Wang Xian was pleasantly surprised as well.

There were very few demon emperors with the light attribute in the demon lair. They had hunted more than a thousand demon emperors and only managed to encounter one.

“Yes, Dragon King. We are lucky. Now, only the 15 black spots of the demon lair have not been taken care of. The rest have been taken care of!”

An lie said with a smile.

“Bring Me There!”

Wang Xian said immediately.

“Yes!”

As soon as an lie finished his sentence, they came to a demon lair.

In front of them, there was a light-attributed demon lair.

“Dragon King!”

Ao crab ao Yaotian Formation and the rest shouted immediately when they saw Wang Xian coming over.

“Very good. After absorbing this lair, the Dragon Palace will be able to upgrade!”

As Wang Xian said that, he looked at an lie.

“Dragon King, let’s Go!”

An Lie’s mind stirred. The power of the altar enveloped the light nest and Wang Xian.

Buzz

The next moment, they returned to the main Dragon Palace of the Imperial Star Field!

In the main Dragon Palace, there was an altar that was specially used for an lie to teleport.

“Absorb!”

Wang Xian looked at the light nest at the side and his mind stirred.

Buzz

The nest trembled and slowly disappeared.

Ding! After absorbing nine attributes, the Divine Kingdom of the Void, Dragon Palace has been upgraded to level 9

The system’s voice sounded. Following that, waves of vast energy filled the entire dragon palace.

Roar! Roar! Roar

The entire Dragon Palace suddenly let out a dragon’s roar. All kinds of buildings were expanding at a terrifying speed.

The size of the Dragon Palace slowly increased to one million kilometers.

All kinds of buildings emitted dragon power and divine light.

The images of divine dragons circled around the entire dragon palace. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The spiritual energy in the Dragon Palace increased at a crazy speed.

“The level of the Dragon Palace has increased!”

At this moment, everyone in the dragon palace was pleasantly surprised.

The Dragon Palace in the past had become smaller with the rapid discovery of the members of the Dragon Palace, but now it had increased by one hundred times.

The size of a million kilometers was sufficient for the powerhouses of the Dragon Palace to survive and cultivate even though they could fly over it in an instant.

There was even a dragon farm. Everyone in the Dragon Palace was very spacious inside.

After all, a million kilometers was not a hundred kilometers.

Hualala

At this moment, Wang Xian suddenly heard the sound of leaves swaying. He was slightly shocked.

At the location of the Dragon King’s palace, the ancestral tree had undergone a huge change.

A tremendous amount of energy gushed out from it. Waves of surging vitality filled the entire dragon palace and nourished everything in it.

Wang Xian sensed this energy and was pleasantly surprised.

With this vitality and the energy of the Dragon Palace, even if an ordinary person was placed in the Dragon Palace, he could live for a million years without cultivating.
