Chapter 1319: Young Master 1320?

When he arrived at the second floor, the dragon’s eyes of light and dark fire scanned through the rooms on the second floor.

There were only two human powerhouses cultivating in the two rooms.

The thick and heavy metal door was tightly shut. Even a powerhouse at the third level of the void interpretation stage would find it difficult to break through it.

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment and continued to walk towards the third floor.

“Roar!”

Suddenly, when Wang Xian had just arrived at the third level, he heard the roar of a beast.

He looked over and saw a demonic beast fighting with a ferocious beast.

Both the demonic beast and the ferocious beast were at the third level of the Seethrough realm.

When the demonic beast saw Wang Xian suddenly coming up from below, its cold eyes swept across him.

“Damn it, you ruined my plan!”

The demonic beast let out a cry with a sullen face. With a leap, it flew out from a window on the third floor.

“Eh? I can’t believe I can get out from the third floor. On the contrary, I can’t fly up from the outside!”

Wang Xian revealed a look of astonishment.

There weren’t many complicated terrains in the main hall. Each floor was where the elders of the blood stream sect cultivated.

As it was the starting point of the spirit vein, each level contained a huge amount of spiritual energy. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

This place was the most powerful blessed land in the entire Liuhai region.

This was also the reason why many insightful emptiness realm experts gathered here.

They continued to walk up to the fourth, fifth, and sixth level.

There were humans or demonic beasts in each of the sealed rooms. The rooms were not a formation. Even Wang Xian would find it extremely difficult to enter.

After all, the people who used to live here had the strength of at least level five of the Seethrough realm.

With his strength, he could not break through the houses they built.

When he reached the tenth floor in a row, Wang Xian suddenly realized that there were five to six old men sitting cross-legged and cultivating.

“Han Zong, these are the people from Han Zong!”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the six of them as his eyes sparkled.

However, very soon, the killing intent in his heart disappeared.

Among the six old men, the lowest was at level three of the Seethrough realm. One of them was at level four of the Seethrough realm and was extremely powerful.

With his current strength, he could only kill all of them after he transformed into a divine dragon.

However, there was a figure in a cultivation room behind them. If that person was stronger, he would have no choice but to flee!

“This floor is reserved by our frost sect. Immediately...”

When the six people from the Frost sect on the tenth floor sensed that Wang Xian had stepped onto the floor, the bald old man who was sitting in the middle spoke coldly.

However, before he could finish his words, he suddenly narrowed his eyes.

“Kid, which sect are you from?”

The Bald Old Man asked with a twinkle in his eyes.

“No sect, no sect. He’s just an unaffiliated person!”

Wang Xian said faintly.

“He seems to be that nameless sword demon. He’s this year’s Supreme Heaven’s pride expert. A few months ago, Han Shan and the rest ambushed him. One of our deacons was killed!”

An old woman in aquamarine clothes, who was sitting cross-legged not far from the bald old man, suddenly spoke in a hoarse voice.

“Oh, is that so?”

“Those little guys from Han Shan, get them to get some strong corpses for young master to devour. These little guys only got two of them!”

“Supreme Heaven’s pride, not bad. Let’s use you as young master’s nourishment!”

The bald old man had just finished his words when his body disappeared instantly.

A stream of water that was like a demonic creature attacked Wang Xian directly.

“What?”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly when he saw the old man suddenly attacking him.

Young Master?

He was called Young Master by an old man at the fourth level of the Void Interpretation Stage?

When he was on the first level, Wang Xian heard the young man from the Frost sect mention the term young master?

Since this old man was addressed as young master, could it be that the Frost sect had an expert at level five of the Void Interpretation Stage?

How come he had never heard of this faction before?

Wang Xian had some doubts in his heart. The crown on his head turned into a five elements millstone and headed toward the expert at level four of the void interpretation stage.

Boom

A terrifying explosion sound exploded in front of the five elements millstone.

The five elements millstone trembled for a moment.

“As expected, it’s a little difficult to fight against an expert at the fourth level of the void interpretation stage. However, I’m not necessarily afraid of him!”

Wang Xian looked at the bald elder who was sent flying backward. He narrowed his eyes slightly.

“Annihilate!”

The five elements millstone turned into a radius of 1,000 meters. The five elements counteracted each other and created a terrifying annihilating space.

“What? What a strong Kid!”

“Impossible. His strength is at the fourth level of the Void Interpretation Stage!”

The bald elder sensed the terrifying attack from the five elements millstone and his expression changed slightly.

“You people from the Frost sect are really courting death!”

A hint of anger flashed in Wang Xian’s eyes. He was suddenly attacked six months ago.

Now, he actually wanted to kill him and turn him into energy to be devoured.

It seemed that if he didn’t destroy Han Zong, he would really think that Wang Xian was easy to bully.

“What’s going on?”

At this moment, a mechanical sound came from a room at the back of the tenth floor.

The stone door at the back opened slowly.

When Wang Xian saw an extremely old arm stretching out, his pupils constricted slightly.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian didn’t hesitate at all. He moved his body and flew directly toward the eleventh floor.

“Grand Elder!”

The Bald Elder and a few other elders saw the stone door approaching. Their expressions changed slightly as they bowed and shouted.

“Haha, Let’s Go Out. It’s almost time!”

At this moment, a young voice that was laughing heartily came from inside.

A thin and weak young man with long hair and disheveled hair walked out slowly.

His incomparably sharp gaze swept the surroundings, and his eyes were filled with excitement.

“Young Master!”

The bald old man sensed the young man’s aura, and his pupils constricted slightly as he called out respectfully in shock.

“Let’s go. There are still two days before the day of the Crown Prince’s establishment. Second Brother, oh second brother, I want to give you a big surprise!”

“Haha, perhaps you would never have thought that not only did I not die when I entered the origin light dragon pool, I even obtained a great opportunity. Keke!”

“And that fellow, I hope that you will appear. When the time comes, I will personally kill you!”

The thin and frail long-haired young man raised his head slightly and laughed arrogantly. His body was filled with a terrifying baleful aura.

Even though his body was of the light attribute, it still gave off a sinister feeling.

“With your talent, the flowing sea region will be under your feet in the future!”

A stiff voice came from behind again. An old man with an extremely shriveled body and skin and bones walked out mechanically.

The old man didn’t seem to have any signs of life. However, his emerald-green body possessed a terrifying energy.

“That voice? And that bald old man’s respectful expression. He should be at the fifth level of the Void Interpretation Stage!”

Wang Xian rushed straight to the eleventh floor. When he sensed that there was no pursuit from below, he frowned slightly.

Fifth level of the Void Interpretation Stage!

Young Master!

“I encountered a powerhouse at the fifth level of the void interpretation stage on the tenth floor. Wouldn’t it be more dangerous up there?”

Wang Xian looked at the hall on the eleventh floor and realized that there was a demonic beast cultivating inside a room.
