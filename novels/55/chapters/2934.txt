Chapter 2935: 2,935 treasure of the Machine Imperial Region 2

“Beep Beep Beep Beep, flowing through Min Tianhe. After being washed by the river water, the chances of the array master locking onto it are 6.372% .”

“Beep Beep Beep, passing through the chaotic energy tide, the chances of the array master locking onto it are 4.67% .”

“Beep Beep Beep Beep Beep, fusing with the ozone metal, the chances of the array master locking onto it are 1.5% .”

In the void of the machine royal territory, the Creator had gone through various special places through precise calculations.

He had gone through all sorts of methods to lower his own aura and interfere with the array master’s locking onto the target.

After going through these special places, he flew in the void for a full two months.

At the back, even Wang Xian was shocked by the creator’s patience.

He had been going to the special places for two months just to get rid of the array master’s lock-on.

This perseverance and patience was really strong.

“Dragon King, this creator is really a talent. After experiencing so many baptisms in the special places, I can no longer find any information about him after searching with the parts of the creator’s giant body.”

Beside him, Tian Chen pursed his lips and said in surprise.

The creator was different from ordinary creatures. He was a mechanical creature, and the things he got from his mechanical giant’s body were essentially contaminated with his aura, not a part of his body.

Therefore, the creator used this method to change his aura a little after being baptized by various strange places.

This change made the heaven array no longer able to lock onto the creator.

“As expected of an existence that has lived for billions of years. Even if there is a slight chance of being found, this tiny chance will be erased. However, he might not have expected that I would be chasing after him from behind!”

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly. His gaze was locked onto the bright mechanical heart in front of him.

“Beep Beep Beep. The chances of the array master locking onto me is already zero.”

At this moment, after the creator passed through a special place, he calculated that the chances of him being locked onto by the array master was already zero.

This made him slightly relieved.

“However, I still can’t be careless. Logically speaking, the Dragon King’s speed should be very fast. The array master is very powerful. There’s a possibility that I have been caught up. There’s a possibility that the Dragon King is following me.”

“Probability calculation!”

“The probability is 51.3% !”

The creator operated rapidly. With a thought, he gave an order.

“Scout aircraft, fly over from all directions with me as the center. Scan any place in the starry sky.”

After the creator gave the order, he flew towards a certain direction.

“This fellow won’t be patiently flying in the machine royal territory for a few years, right?”

Wang Xian followed closely behind the creator. His face turned dark.

“This creator is too smart and vigilant. Dragon King, we have to be careful. It’s best if we can completely conceal ourselves.”

The Heaven Array said to him.

“Yes, I also have the AO Yao’s concealment ability. This kind of light and dark concealment ability can avoid the scanning of array formations and technology. Heaven Array, you go into the Mother Nest First!”

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly. With a thought, his body slowly turned illusory.

In the next few days, Wang Xian became more cautious. He exerted his concealing ability to the limit and followed behind the creator.

Other than occasionally communicating with Prime Minister Gui, there was nothing else.

Later on, Wang Xian even cut off contact with Prime Minister Gui and the rest. He kept all the communication stone disks to prevent accidents from happening.

“Ho ho ho!”

“Hahaha, this is awesome! There are too many resources!”

While Wang Xian’s heaven formation and the rest were chasing after the Creator’s mechanical heart, ao crab and the other devouring dragons were roaring excitedly and crazily on the battlefield.

For the devouring dragons, the robots, battleships, warframes, warplanes, and mechanical planets were the resources to upgrade themselves.

An hour after Wang Xian and the rest left, all the robots were killed.

Next, it was time for AO he and the rest to celebrate.

The mechanical imperial region was different from the other regions. The resources in the other regions were very scattered.

However, all the resources in the mechanical imperial region were concentrated in the hands of the robots and the creator.

How many treasures would there be in the entire galaxy that were billions of years old?

And how terrifying would it be if all these treasures were used to create the robots?

One could imagine just by looking at those mechanical planets.

Using powerful metals to create a war planet, what kind of enormous resources would that be?

There were also hundreds of billions of robots. One had to know that among those hundreds of billions of robots, the weakest had the strength of a god Lord.

There were also more than a million God kings.

In addition to that large battleship, it could be comparable to a god Emperor’s battleship, Mech, Mech, and so on.

Most importantly, there was the creator’s giant body.

The entire giant body had been transformed into biological metal, possessing the destructive power of a void God Emperor.

With such a large body, how many treasures had been consumed?

There was also a very important point, which was how many resources would be consumed to create a robot that had the combat strength of a god King?

For a human godly king expert to reach such a realm, they might have to go through hundreds of thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of years, or even millions of years of cultivation, consume various treasures, and absorb the heaven and earth spiritual Qi to reach such a stage.

And the robots could not cultivate or absorb the heaven and Earth Spiritual Qi. If they wanted to improve, they could only rely on various resources.

This also meant that the resources contained in the robots’bodies were ten times or even more than the resources that ordinary godly monarch experts and their divine kingdoms could convert.

To put it in layman terms, the energy contained in a robot with a first rank godly monarch combat strength was ten times or more than that of a first rank godly monarch expert.

A robot corpse could withstand ten human corpses of the same level.

That was how terrifying it was! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

This was the reason why ao crab and the devouring dragons were so excited and crazy.

This upgrade was not double or double for the devouring dragons, but ten times, or even more.

“TSK, TSK, tsk. Ao crab has really made a big profit this time. He’s crazy. Even if we destroy the chimei territory in the future, it will be very difficult for us to be as powerful as the Devouring Dragons!”

The eight-limbed demon Fiend and the others said with some envy.

Even Mu Zesen, Ao Qi, and AO qitian were filled with envy.

This time, the devouring dragon was going crazy.

Very soon, the devouring dragon’s strength alone was enough to crush all the other dragon species in the Dragon Palace.

“Roar, Roar, Roar!”

Two months after the Wang Xian Heaven Array chased after the creator, the excited roars of breakthroughs could be heard from time to time on the battlefield.

And at the creator Giant’s body, ao crab was still devouring energy at a rapid rate.

As the creator’s body, was it possible for him to have a huge amount of resources?

Currently, ao crab brought along nine devouring dragons as he digested the creator’s body.

It might not be long before they had the strength of a third level void God Emperor.
