Chapter 1534: 1534 the world of radiant priests was shaken

“That voice just now was the voice of Reverend Wang. He... he actually... actually threw the son of light down from the fourth floor!”

“What on Earth is going on? My God, the son of light was actually thrown out from the fourth floor. Furthermore, Reverend Wang’s words were simply too domineering!”

“The son of light and the daughter of light are all trash in my eyes. This... This is simply the greatest humiliation to the son of light and the daughter of light!”

“The child of light is a prince of the Divine Light Empire. The identity of the daughter of light is even more noble. She is the princess of the Wuji Empire. Priest Wang’s words will definitely offend the two of them!”

In front of the door of the sacred medical clinic, everyone in the vicinity watched in shock.

This famous Lord Wang had actually thrown the child of light out and even said such contemptuous words!

Was he looking down on the daughter of Light?

“That Lord son of light must have angered Reverend Wang when he entered the fourth floor and was thrown out!”

“Doesn’t that mean that Reverend Wang is stronger than the son of Light? Otherwise, he wouldn’t have thrown him out!”

“Reverend Wang is also very young. Since he dares to say such words, he must be stronger than the son of light!”

The group of patients who were waiting in line for treatment in the holy medicine clinic stared at the son of light who was lying on the ground and whispered to each other.

Looking at this son of light, their eyes were filled with schadenfreude.

He deserved it for provoking priest Wang!

Nowadays, Wang Xian was practically the reincarnation of the god of light in front of those who didn’t have a good family background.

In the span of more than ten days, he had already cured more than 10,000 people for free.

More than 10,000 people had been treated by the daughter of light.

“Damn it, damn it, you dare to insult me, you dare to Insult Me!”

The son of light, Tian Qingguang, who was lying on the ground, had an extremely embarrassed look in his eyes.

He had actually been humiliated in public!

He had actually been thrown down from the fourth floor!

This was simply a great humiliation.

However, when he thought of how he had been thrown down without being able to resist at all, his expression became awkward again.

He never would have thought that a young man would actually possess a power that he was unable to resist!

This was simply impossible. He himself was placed in the vast region and could be considered one of the top heaven’s favorites!

“Prince, we... We...”

A few young men and women at the side wiped the blood from the corner of their mouths. They stood up with an embarrassed expression. When they heard the discussions around them, they walked to Tian Qingguang’s side with faces full of anger.

“Let’s go, we’re going back!”

Tian qingguang glanced at the fourth floor coldly. He clenched his fists and his heart was filled with a violent killing intent!

Gulp

At this moment, at the fourth floor, twenty people who were preparing to see a doctor swallowed a mouthful of saliva. They stared at Wang Xian in disbelief and swallowed a mouthful of saliva.

Reverend Wang had actually thrown the son of light out.

In front of Reverend Wang, the son of Light, who represented the highest honor among the priests of light, was like A. . . A piece of trash!

He was thrown out casually!

This...

Old Hu was also stunned. He shook his head slowly.

“Are You Alright?”

Wang Xian sat on the chair indifferently. He looked at the receptionist girl who had fallen on the stairs and asked.

“It’s alright, it’s Alright, Reverend Wang!”

Upon hearing Wang Xian’s concerned words, the girl’s face turned red instantly. She lowered her head and said hurriedly. Her heart was beating rapidly!

Reverend Wang is actually concerned about me!

Did Reverend Wang throw the son of light out just now for me?

Ah, ah, this is simply too blissful!

The female receptionist stood there with an excited look on her face. From time to time, she would raise her head to look at Wang Xian!

“Let’s continue!”

Wang Xian did not mind throwing the children of light and the rest out. Instead, he spoke directly to the 20 patients in front of him. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Yes, it’s Reverend Wang!”

Seeing Wang Xian killing all the children of light in an instant with their own eyes, they became even more respectful.

Wang Xian smiled and continued to treat them.

However, Reverend Wang threw the children of light down from the fourth floor of the Holy Pharmacy. He even said that the matter of the children of light and the daughter of light being trash was instantly spread throughout the ruins of the divine kingdom.

The position of the priest of light was very high in the ruins of God country. Everyone knew about the child of light, the daughter of light.

As for that priest Wang, everyone knew about him recently.

Today, the child of light had been thrown out by priest Wang. It could be said that it had caused a huge sensation in the world of priests of light!

This meant that priest Wang was much stronger than the child of light.

However, even so, the fact that he called the son of Light’s daughter of light trash made the other priests of light extremely angry.

The current priest of light originated from the divine light dynasty, and the son of light was the Prince of the Divine Light Dynasty.

The priest Wang calling the son of light was to humiliate their divine light dynasty and the elder ancestor of the Divine Light Dynasty.

After all, the title of the son of Light’s daughter of light was conferred by the elder ancestor.

As for the identity of the daughter of light, there was no need to mention it.

Some people even guessed that priest Wang was going to be done for.

Not only did he offend the Divine Light Empire, but he also offended the daughter of light, Wu Qingyan. This person had an extremely terrifying background.

“Bastard Bastard, that bastard Tian Qingguang, why did he provoke that evildoer for no reason? He actually made him call me trash!”

Inside the Guangming Villa, Wu Qingyan’s face was filled with anger as she slammed her hands on the stone bench in front of her and shouted angrily.

Wu Qingyan, who was at the side, shrunk her head. Seeing her sister’s angry look, she secretly smiled.

“You’re still smiling, you’re still smiling!”

Wu Qingyan glared at her sister.

“Sister, let me guess, that Tian Qingguang definitely saw that priest Wang didn’t come yesterday and helped you teach him a lesson and curry favor with you. It’s just that he didn’t expect to meet a tough guy!”

Wu Qingyan smiled and stuck out her tongue. “Such an evildoer. I’ll get someone to check it out!”

“Did you find anything?”

Wu Qingyan asked her sister.

“Not yet, but don’t worry, sister. Our Wuji dynasty is not even as good as the He clan in terms of information in the vast region. It’s easy to find that guy!”

Wu Qingyan said confidently.

“I’m very curious, where did that guy come from? HMPH, he actually dares to call me trash!”

Wu Qingyan gritted her teeth. She was a little angry and curious about that mysterious and powerful priest Wang.

“Find out that guy’s identity!”

Wu Qingyan clenched her fists at the side, full of fighting spirit.

She was also full of curiosity about a terrifying monster who was not even thirty years old.

“Oh right, the black screen garden is about to open, right? I heard that Big Brother is coming!”

Wu Qingyan suddenly asked.

“Yes, Big Brother is coming. I heard that many peerless talents in the vast area will come. There are only two talents in the world of our sect, he yuan of the He clan, he suiwen of the He clan, Big Brother and the others, the Bingxin dynasty, and so on!”

Wu Qingyan nodded her head!
