“Once Upon a time, when the immortal sects appeared, their awe-inspiring voice spread throughout the entire jianghu. Now that the Dragon Palace has appeared, the seven immortal gods have shaken the world!”

“Dragon Palace? With the appearance of the world at this time and the mention of any enemies who have offended you, killing them should be the power of the Dragon King!”

“Among the seven immortal gods, there isn’t the voice of the Dragon King or the female immortal god beside him. If this Dragon Palace is also the power of the Dragon King, then this dragon palace is simply too terrifying!”

The Immortal God’s voice spread throughout the entire jianghu, and all the jianghu warriors listened to the voices with faces full of shock.

Very soon, the entire jianghu online was in an uproar.

Just a moment ago, everyone was still discussing the Dragon Gate and the Holy Doctor, Holy Medicine, and Immortal sect. Now, in the blink of an eye, the Dragon Palace had appeared.

A force that was very likely to be the Dragon Palace had arrived, and this caused an uproar in the entire jianghu.

“The Dragon King now has at least nine immortal gods. Even if it’s to fight against the Holy Doctor, Holy Medicine, and Immortal Sect, the immortal gods have the strength to do so!”

“It’s really unbelievable. This is too crazy. It seems that this war is not as bad as we expected. There might be a change!”

“If the Dragon Palace is really the Dragon King’s force, then it seems that the Dragon King is really angry!”

All the martial artists in the jianghu were talking about the appearance of the Dragon Palace.

Meanwhile, in the Yao Ding Holy Doctor Medicine Immortal Sect, the immortal gods of the two immortal sects gathered together with solemn faces.

“There are at least nine immortal gods. This dragon gate is really beyond our expectations!”

“No matter what, since we have made a move, we will fight to the end. So what if there are nine immortal gods? Now we are competing with the strength of the disciples of the Dragon Palace. I don’t believe that the disciples of the Dragon Palace will be more powerful than us!”

“So what if we contact the Thorn clan and drag the Thorn clan to our side? The Dragon Palace? Hehe?”

In the main hall, the immortals said with cold faces.

The appearance of the Dragon Palace had indeed made them a lot more solemn, but since they were enemies, they were not afraid at all.

Moreover, the nine immortals were far inferior to them.

Especially since they were supreme-beings with superior-level immortals, they weren’t afraid even if a battle between immortal gods broke out.

Moreover, with the agreement between immortal gods, they could only fight among disciples.

With a thousand-year foundation, the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect had enough confidence and strength. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Since we’ve made a move, we can’t take it back. Let’s Fight!”

In the treacherous Spike clan, four to five immortals gathered in a shadowy palace. They spoke with slight regret.

This time, the treacherous Spike clan had interfered. Eight of the infant realm experts had been killed. Now that the Dragon Palace had suddenly appeared, they would have to suffer revenge. It was not worth it.

However, as an assassin clan that had been established for thousands of years, they had their own professional rules.

Just as the entire jianghu was in an uproar, in a villa along the coast of River City, Wang Xian stood at the top and looked in the direction of the Dragon Palace with a faint smile on his face.

There were two more immortals in the Dragon Palace, ao Nu and Ao Xia. Under the energy of the immortal-level aquatic creature, they had finally stepped into the realm of immortals.

On the horizon, a group of figures flew over at a terrifying speed.

Ao Jian had brought the remaining 50 infant realm experts of the Golden Swordfish clan here. Including those who had just arrived, there were a total of 70 infant realm experts.

What could not be seen by the naked eye was that beside the Golden Swordfish, more than 150 strange demons were hiding in the void.

Wang Xian did not ask the other immortal-level members of the Dragon Palace to come over because it was not the time yet!

“Dragon King!”

“Dragon King!”

The group of Dragon Palace members arrived and their hidden figures appeared immediately. A terrifying and majestic energy filled the area within a thousand meters.

There were more than 220 infant stage powerhouses in total. Among them, there were 20 half-step immortal-level existences.

“Dragon King, the soul-returning wood has absorbed the souls of the dead drakonids. All information has been collected!”

Mo Qinglong led the rest of the DRAKONIDS and rushed over. There were more than 30 of them.

At this point, more than 250 of the strongest experts in the immortal sect had gathered.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled. “The treacherous Spike clan is located in the Xia Ding region and belongs to the assassin clan. There aren’t many disciples under them. Ao Yao, lead 70 of them to assassinate the treacherous Spike clan. As long as they are from the treacherous Spike clan, kill them all!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao nodded his head heavily.

“All the other members of the Dragon Palace, follow me and head to the Yao Ding region. From today onwards, the entire Yao Ding will be in Chaos!”

More than 200 infant stage powerhouses could follow the example of the Hunyuan Celestial sect and block the city gates of the Holy Medicine and holy medicine celestial sects.

However, Wang Xian would not do that.

Blocking the city gates would instead make them wary and put up a defense. This time, Wang Xian wanted to make the other party tremble in fear.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian shouted softly. He did not stay any longer and flew directly toward the area of the celestial sect of Holy Medicine and holy medicine.

“Let’s Go!”

Ao Yao led his men and flew toward the location of the Strange Thorn tribe.

“Hehe, it’s about to start!”

Half an hour later, Wang Xian looked into the distance with a cold smile on his face.

This Morning, the Holy Medicine sect had destroyed his dragon gate forging workshop. Tonight, it was time for all of you to pay the price!

Revenge never lasts forever!

“Dragon King, the Holy City below the Holy Medicine sect is right in front of us. There are over ten million people in the city. All the disciples of the Holy Medicine sect live in it!”

The Green Dragon pointed to the distance and looked at the huge city, frowning, he said, “The Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal Sect’s foundation is not something the Hunyuan immortal sect can compare to. They have an array formation in their city. Once their strength surpasses that of the infant realm, the array formation will react!”

“No wonder the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect dares to be our enemy. Once we enter, once the battle breaks out, we will be discovered instantly, and the immortals will be able to act immediately!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with astonishment. “In other words, we can only kill the disciples who leave the city!”

“Yes, Dragon King. Among the twenty sects, the top few sects have powerful formations. Some of them can even defend against the attacks of lower-level Immortals!”

Mo Qinglong replied with an unpleasant expression.

“It’s fine. We will just fight them. As long as they come out, we will kill them all!”

The corners of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly. It wouldn’t take too long.

“The city gates haven’t closed yet. There are still many disciples of the Holy Medicine sect coming and going. Hehe, they sure are confident!”

A cold smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face.

When the Holy Medicine sect made their move, they directly annihilated all the ordinary workers in the Longmen forging workshop. The lives of more than a hundred workers should be repaid a hundredfold!

This was the way of war. There was no mercy!

“Begin the cleanup!”

Wang Xian and Ao Jian stood in the air. One golden swordfish after another flew rapidly toward the city gate.
