Chapter 1083: 1084 was touched

“Wang Xian, come over quickly. Hide Here!”

When everyone around was staring at the mayor’s residence with furious faces.

After Wang Xian released his attack, he left gracefully.

He wasn’t flustered at all when he faced deputy captain Meng. He could even play with them for a while.

He was the only one who made a move earlier. The strange demon hiding in the surroundings had yet to make a move. Once the strange demon made a move, there was a high possibility that he could destroy the entire team of the hurricane team.

Just as Wang Xian was about to leave, the voice of a girl came from below.

He was slightly stunned and looked down.

“Hurry up, it’s Too Late!”

Jin Liuyan waved her hand at Wang Xian anxiously and urged him.

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment. He smiled and landed directly in the courtyard below. Ao Jian and the rest immediately hid in the surroundings.

Dong Dong Dong Dong Dong

When he landed in the courtyard, an urgent sound suddenly rang out.

Wang Xian raised his head and looked at the tower. At this moment, the clock on the tower was ringing non-stop.

Jin Liuyan’s expression changed drastically when she heard the sound. Her face was filled with worry.

“The bell is ringing. The crisis of Shenghai town has arrived!”

“You must hold on. Don’t be like Xilai town. Otherwise, we will be finished!”

Sounds of crying could be vaguely heard from outside.

“Hurry up, Wang Xian. Hide quickly!”

Jin Liuyan walked to Wang Xian’s side and pulled him as she said.

“Don’t worry. They can’t do anything to me!”

Wang Xian smiled and followed him into the room.

“Phew, that guy, Hai Wen, is really a bad guy. However, he is the son of the general. You have to be careful in the future!”

Jin Liuyan quickly closed the door and reminded Wang Xian with an unpleasant expression.

She had a good impression of Wang Xian. However, she could tell that Wang Xian didn’t have any feelings for her.

However, this wasn’t to stop them from becoming friends.

“Don’t worry. With the sound now, could it be that the ferocious beasts have arrived?”

Wang Xian said to Jin Liuyan. The sound of the horn bell was still ringing. It sounded urgent and urgent. Clearly, the situation outside could be very dangerous.

“Yes. The sound of the horn bell ringing five times represents the highest level of warning. Now that the horn bell is still ringing, Shenghai town might be in a life-and-death situation!”

Jin Liuyan said with a pale face.

“Liuyan, Liuyan!”

At this moment, an urgent voice came from outside.

Jin Liuyan’s expression changed slightly. She looked at Wang Xian and whispered, “It’s my father!”

“It’s alright. Open the door!”

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment and shook his head. Jin Qianyuan had no ill intentions towards him. Furthermore, he was not in the same group as the ocean cultivators. If he found out that he was here, he would pretend that he didn’t see him.

“Alright!”

Jin Liuyan nodded and opened the door.

“Liuyan, you will be following me from now on...”

Jin Qianyuan’s anxious voice was heard when the door was opened. However, he stopped mid-sentence when he saw Wang Xian inside.

He frowned slightly and shook his head helplessly. “You should escape quickly. If the ocean cultivator army’s commander arrives, you won’t be able to escape even if you want to!”

“Father, vice commander Meng didn’t chase after us, right?”

Jin Liuyan asked hurriedly.

“No!”

Jin Qianyuan’s face turned cold when he mentioned vice commander Meng.

If vice commander Meng didn’t insist on avenging Hai Wen, they would have greater confidence if the holy sea town, the riding wind battle team, Wang Xian, and his subordinates were here to defend the city.

Now that Wang Xian had been chased away, they had lost one level 9 and eleven level 8 extraordinaires.

Although there were only twelve of them, their strength was equivalent to most of the strength of the Holy Sea Town!

Now that they had been forcefully chased away, if the holy sea town couldn’t defend it this time, he would take a huge risk and report him to the King!

“Now that the fierce beasts have appeared at the East Gate, West Gate, South Gate, and north gate, they have completely surrounded holy sea town. In this battle, we can only win, not lose!”

“The East Gate and north gate have the most fierce beasts. The east gate will be guarded by the wind riding squad, while the other three gates will be guarded by the experts of holy sea town. Liuyan, you follow me. If anything happens, father will take good care of you!”

Jin Qianyuan said with a sullen face. It was obvious that the current situation had exceeded his expectations.

“The ferocious beasts are attacking us now?”

When Wang Xian heard Jin Qianyuan’s words, a hint of surprise and joy appeared on his face. He stood up immediately.

“They are attacking us. Moreover, the number of ferocious beasts has exceeded our expectations. We have already requested for reinforcements from Donghai City, but we have yet to receive a reply!”

Jin Qianyuan looked at Wang Xian and did not hide anything.

“Is that so?”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. “I will help you defend the city!”

“What?”

Jin Qianyuan was slightly stunned. A hint of excitement flashed across his eyes as he looked at Wang Xian in disbelief.

“I will defend one of the city gates while the riding wind battle team will defend the East Gate. Leave the North Gate to me!”

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up. Before the general of the ocean cultivators army arrived, the ferocious beasts had already arrived. He could definitely use this period of time to harvest the corpses of a large group of ferocious beasts.

In this way, he could make up for some of his losses.

“It’s true!”

Jin Qianyuan’s face was filled with excitement. He couldn’t believe it. Now that the ocean cultivators army was trying to kill him, he even helped the holy sea to guard the city. This move touched Jin Qianyuan deeply.

“Of course it’s true!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile.

“Thank you, thank you!”

Jin Qianyuan couldn’t help but grab Wang Xian’s arm and said emotionally, “I thank you on behalf of all the people of the Holy Sea Town!”

“Phew!”

As he said that, Jin Qianyuan took a deep breath, with slightly red eyes, he said, “If the leader of the ocean cultivators is really here, I will inform you immediately. When the time comes, you can escape immediately and help us defend the holy sea town. Even if I, Jin Qianyuan, Offend General Tahai, I will not let anything happen to you!”

It was true love in the face of life and death. Look at this young man. Even when the ocean cultivators were chasing after them, he still helped them to defend the city. This action was worthy of the gratitude of the people of the entire holy sea town.

This reminded him of the last time when the monsters attacked the city. He still rushed to the outermost part of the city and killed countless ferocious beasts.

He was touched!

Wang Xian looked at Jin Qianyuan, who was so touched that his eyes were slightly red. He was slightly stunned as he knew that he had misunderstood.

However, it was fine if it was a misunderstanding. In order to kill the ferocious beasts, he was helping the holy sea town in disguise.

Furthermore, with the mayor of the holy sea town providing him with information, he would be able to avoid the intruders if they came.

“There’s no need. The holy sea town is half my home!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian smiled faintly.

“Thank you!”

Jin Qianyuan bowed deeply and looked at him. “Commander Wang, let’s go out. Everyone from the riding wind battle team is already at the east gate. Let’s go to the North Gate!”

“Okay!”
