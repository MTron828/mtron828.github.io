Chapter 1026: 1027. The entire city was on alert

Translator: 5496903

In less than five hours, news of the dragon Spike had spread throughout the entire eastern sea city.

Even an ordinary mercenary group had some understanding of the dragon spike.

This made everyone surprised by the rules of the Dragon Spike Assassin Group. They were also shocked by the strength of the dragon spike.

They had wiped out the snake family as soon as they made a move. No one doubted whether they could do anything in eastern sea city.

In just half a day, the atmosphere in East Sea city was like a storm was about to come.

Everyone knew that at this moment, someone had definitely started to issue a mission.

In the most central area of East Sea City, next to a tall tower, the center of power in the entire East Sea city.

The position of the strongest expert of East Sea city, the seat of the Governor’s mansion of East Sea city.

In the office seat, an old man sat majestically on the Chair in the center of the front.

There were more than ten middle-aged men sitting in the two rows below. Each of them had an imposing aura.

They were all experts of the city Lord’s Mansion and the regional chiefs of the five regions.

“You should know about the dragon spike. He appeared in a few towns under East Sea city a few months ago. Now, all the underground assassinations in the towns have been ruled by the dragon spike. Now, he has come to our East Sea city. How should we solve this problem?”

An old man on the lower left side of the city lord scanned the surroundings and asked in a deep voice.

“What do you mean, City Lord? Are we going to let it go or deal with the dragon Spike?”

An old man arched an arch and asked the city lord sitting in the center.

Without the city Lord’s words, they did not dare to make a decision on their own.

“The mayor of bridge forest town is a subject of star-moon kingdom. The dragon Spike openly assassinated the mayor of Bridge Forest Town on the street. This is the biggest provocation to us!”

The city lord sitting in the middle.., he spoke in a solemn voice that exuded authority without anger, “Last time, His Highness the king personally asked about this matter, but when the new mayor went over, there was already no news of the dragon spike. This time, they actually dared to enter East Sea city so arrogantly. We can’t just leave them be!”

“I agree with the city lord. According to all the information, this dragon assassin organization should be able to assassinate at most a rank 8 transcendent expert. It shouldn’t be possible for a rank 9 transcendent. However, even if they have a rank 9 transcendent, with the city Lord’s presence and the East Sea city’s array formation, all the small fries are under our control!”

An old man said loudly.

“Agreed. Assassinating the mayor of Bridgewood town is already disregarding our star-moon kingdom. Even the undercurrents aren’t so arrogant. We definitely can’t let a dragon assassin organization Go!”

“That’s right. If we ignore them, they’ll think that our star-moon kingdom won’t dare to touch them in the future!”

The middle-aged elders agreed.

They all knew about Bridgewood town. An assassin organization dared to assassinate star-moon kingdom’s officials. This was a provocation to the entire kingdom.

They might be a little afraid of the strength of this dragon assassin organization, but since the city Lord had spoken, it was different.

“First, find their spies. Then, we’ll take the opportunity to find their nest!”

“Send five times more men to keep an eye on all the places in the East Sea City!”

“It’s the city Lord!”

The city Lord’s order was given, and everyone immediately carried it out. The operation against the dragon Spike had already begun.

Wang Xian didn’t know that this operation would attract the city Lord’s attention. It would also attract the attention of powerhouses at the insightful void tier.

“Dragon King, up till now, we have received fifteen missions. The biggest one is to destroy the DU family. The Du family’s commission has reached 700 million middle-grade spirit stones!”

In the afternoon, when Wang Xian had just returned to his residence, a group of DRAKONIDS came over to report.

“700 million?”

Wang Xian’s eyes flashed with a hint of excitement. “Du Family? Is it the du family that is spying on us?”

“It’s the Dragon King. There is only one du family in Donghai City!”

The DRAKONIDS replied.

“Alright, perfect timing. I’ve accepted the mission. Bring Me the Commission!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. There was a hint of excitement in his eyes.

He didn’t expect that someone would offer 700 million middle-grade spiritual stones to wipe out all the powerhouses in a family when he just arrived at Donghai City.

This was akin to robbing money.

After robbing the snake family, he only received 800 million middle-grade spiritual stones. Of course, the other materials, weapons, and spiritual herbs were not included.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The group of DRAKONIDS nodded.

All the missions were selected by the DRAKONIDS. They did not kill good people or children.

Fifteen missions were directly accepted.

The DRAKONIDS received commissions through spies. However, they secretly passed the commissions to the DRAKONIDS.

In East Sea city, which had a population of ten million, this method was very secretive and difficult to find.

Unless... there was something wrong with the person who issued the mission. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

After accepting the fifteen missions, he didn’t accept any other missions.

One of the more than ten missions was a big shot of the du family. It would take a longer time.

Furthermore, Wang Xian was prepared to go with the du family for this mission. Of course, it was the same as last night.

Night arrived quietly. The Donghai City today was different from the past.

To be exact, it was similar to the old shenghai town.

The lights were bright. Today was the second night of the dragon Spike’s arrival. There were already people looking for the dragon spike to issue missions.

They had to guard against the dragon Spike’s assassination.

Wang Xian walked on the road and looked at the bright courtyards around him. A smile appeared on his face.

The arrival of the dragon spike had made the entire Donghai city on alert.

Hehe, the entire city was on alert.

“It’s useless. After tonight, it will be even more useless!”

A smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face as he walked in the direction of the Du family with a smile.

He realized that there were chairs on the roads surrounding the luxurious manors and courtyards.

Furthermore, they were chairs under the shade of the trees. Even the formation couldn’t be seen.

Wang Xian sat on the chair with a relaxed expression as he waited for the news quietly.

In less than ten minutes, ao Yao appeared beside him. Just like last night, Wang Xian absorbed the soul and passed the du family’s treasure trove to Ao Yao.

In less than twenty minutes, Wang Xian took out one interspatial ring after another and walked towards his residence.

The night passed quietly.

“Ah!”

An exclamation was heard.

The voice did not come from inside the du family but from outside.

A passerby looked at the red piece of congratulatory death paper at the entrance of the Du family with a face full of shock. He could not help but exclaim in surprise.

The Du family, this was the du family after all. The Du family had an extraordinary level 8 powerhouse, yet they were actually killed by a dragon sting in front of their door.

The outcome was expected. The expert of the Du family had been assassinated by the Dragon’s Thorn!

A Cry of surprise caught the attention of many people.

Some of the people who looked over widened their eyes and looked over.

“Amazing, as expected of the dragon’s Thorn. It didn’t even take a day to kill the du family. It’s really powerful. Luckily, we made the first move!”

Around them, a middle-aged man looked at the red piece of paper on the door of the Du family, full of surprise.

Even though this task was given by him, he still felt a palpitation when he saw this piece of paper!

This represented death!
