Chapter 1261: 1262 unrivalled Heaven’s Pride King Beast

Translator: 5496903

A domineering aura emanated from Tang Lingwen’s body, and his voice resounded throughout the sky above the trial ground.

“Weng!”

After he finished speaking, the level 2 void interpretation formation behind him instantly covered an area of ten kilometers.

The blood-colored killing formation space emitted a heart-palpitating ripple.

Killing, all the humans were also enveloped.

“What a powerful killing array, as expected of a rank 2 void interpretation array. It’s too powerful, a Rank 1 void interpretation expert must die!”

“Haha, this Demonic Lin King Beast is doomed. Arrogant, let you be arrogant!”

“Peel off its skin, let it know the consequences of killing us humans!”

The ten thousand people behind saw the powerful array and revealed excited expressions.

“This beast is doomed!”

Tang Feng, Tang Yuan, and the others who were holding the array looked excited when they saw more than a dozen demonic beasts being enveloped.

However, at this moment, the Demonic Lin King Beast also smiled, and its smile was full of cunning.

“Hehehe, I’ve revealed all my trump cards. Haha, I Can Have a good meal now!”

The Demonic Lin King Beast’s sinister voice suddenly rang out, causing all the humans to be slightly stunned.

“Eh? Beast, Die!”

Tang Lingwen saw the demonic Lin King Beast’s sinister appearance and was slightly astonished. He suddenly had a bad premonition in his heart.

However, he quickly threw this premonition aside and brandished the blood-colored broadsword in his hand in front of him.

Streams of thousand-meter-long black saber rays covered the demonic Lin King Beast.

“Attack!”

Tang Feng, Tang Yuan, and the others also shouted. They controlled the formation and attacked at the same time.

Within a ten-kilometer radius, sharp black longswords appeared out of thin air.

The longswords were densely packed. There were at least a million of them in the entire space!

“Kill!”

“Kill!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The sounds of killing rang out. A thousand-meter-long sword light and densely packed black longswords covered the area in front of them.

More than ten demonic beasts were completely covered by the terrifying attack, and even their figures couldn’t be seen.

“Die!”

“Facing such an attack, no matter how strong you are, you must die!”

“Haha, Beast, Die!”

All the humans revealed excited expressions!

“Roar!”

Suddenly, a terrifying howl shook everyone’s eardrums, and everyone’s faces trembled.

“Boom!”

A terrifying flame suddenly rose up from where the attack had covered. In the sky, there were many black longswords and streaks of blade light.

Under the terrifying flames, they actually quickly melted.

The smiles on everyone’s faces froze, their pupils slowly dilated, filled with disbelief.

“Haha, Foolish Humans, wanting to kill my demonic soul is simply wishful thinking!”

“Today, I’ll let you all know that My Demon Soul is your nightmare. Die, you bunch of Fools!”

The voice of the Demon Soul King Beast sounded, and the monstrous flames covered an area of 2,000 meters.

The small black sword within the array quickly disappeared.

Within the dark blood-colored array, this demon Lin King Beast was like a flame monarch from hell.

“What? How is this possible?”

Tang Lingwen felt the terrifying power of the demonic soul and the flames that caused the array to tremble, and his face was filled with shock.

“Haha, a bunch of stupid things. Do you think I’m at the first level of the profound void tier? Keke!”

A terrifying voice sounded again, and the demonic soul returned to its horse form. Its four hooves stepped in the air, carrying terrifying flames as it directly attacked Tang Lingwen.

“What? It’s not at the first level of the void interpretation stage, could it be?”

Tang Lingwen’s expression suddenly turned deathly pale, and a look of disbelief appeared on his face.

“No, no... This is impossible?”

Tang Feng and Tang Yuan, who held the array formation in their hands, also had a great change in expression.

The humans behind them were even more shocked.

Not at the first level of the Void interpretation stage?

Could it be?

The second level of the Void Interpretation Stage?

“Beast, don’t even think about lying to me, Dharma Idol: Dark Demon Blade!”

Tang Lingwen clenched his teeth and roared. His body was like an abyss, and terrifying darkness surged out.

The Darkness condensed into a thousand-meter-wide demon blade.

“Attack, Attack!”

Tang Feng and Tang Yuan also hurriedly shouted. They controlled the power of the array and attacked the demon soul.

“Keke, a group of ants, a group of ants!”

The Demon Soul that was rushing over swung its tail, and the flames on its body turned into an even larger demon soul itself.

“Roar!”

It roared loudly, and its front hooves leapt up, directly biting towards the thousand meter large dark demon blade.

“Bang Bang Bang!”

The incomparably powerful Dark Demon Beast, Tang Lingwen’s strongest attack, actually collapsed at a terrifying speed under the attack of the Demon Soul.

“No!”

Tang Lingwen was shocked. His face was filled with disbelief as he shouted loudly.

“Peng Peng Peng!”

Tang Feng, Tang Yuan, and the others’foreheads were instantly filled with cold sweat. The black longswords hadn’t even landed on his body when they were directly melted by the flames.

It was very difficult to kill a level 2 profound void martial expert with a level 2 profound void martial formation. At most, it could only deal with a level 1 profound void martial expert.

Facing such a terrifying demon soul, it was completely unable to cause any harm to it.

Especially when it released its dharma idol.

“Go and die, a reckless human, hehehe!”

The Demon Soul’s gaze locked onto Tang Lingwen and directly charged towards him. It opened its largest mouth and bit towards him.

“Not good!”

Feeling the destructive attack from the demon soul, Tang Lingwen’s eyes revealed a panicked expression.

At this moment, he didn’t have the confidence and domineering aura from before.

There was only fear!

The current King Beast of the Demon Beast clan was actually a cave level 2. This was simply shocking.

“Peng, Peng, Peng!”

He hurriedly raised the long saber in his hand to block the demon soul’s attack.

However, the terrifying flames caused the surrounding dark energy to be burned, and his arms trembled.

A level one void interpretation expert was completely unable to resist against a level two void interpretation expert.

“Ah!”

Tang Lingwen’s eyes widened, and despair appeared in his eyes.

A bloody mouth directly bit onto his body.

“Peng!”

The terrifying power directly swallowed it into its mouth.

“Roar, Delicious Fresh Blood!”

The Demon Soul excitedly roared, and an excited expression appeared in its eyes.

It slowly looked towards the humans in front of it and licked its tongue.

“What? How is this possible? How is this possible?”

“Senior Tang Lingwen... No, no...”

“Quickly run, quickly run!”

All the humans who were watching this scene revealed a terrified expression as they cried out in terror.

“Run, run!”

Tang Feng and Tang Yuan, the two princes, saw that Tang Lingwen was easily killed and their hair blew up. Without the slightest hesitation, they immediately fled towards the exit.

“Keke, with just you ants, you still want to escape?”

The Demon Soul’s cold voice resounded in everyone’s ears. The figure that was emitting a terrifying might directly charged over.

“Explode!”

When Tang Feng and Tang Yuan saw the demon soul charging over, they immediately threw away the array compass in their hands, causing it to erupt with an instant power as it attacked the Demon Soul!
