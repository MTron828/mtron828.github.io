Chapter 587: Great Waterfall Water Shockwave

Let’s see if I can enter into Level 3 and 4 of the Scriptures Depository this time round.

I am a lot stronger now than I was a few days ago!

Wang Xian moved swiftly on his sword towards Mt. Fengyu.

Compared to a few days ago, the dragon energy in Wang Xian had increased to over eighty million points.

This was three to four-fold more energy than he had days before.

Wang Xian was unsure of how strong his actual strength was right now. But he was confident that he would have easily killed Emperor Qi if he were to fight him again right now.

Upon reaching Mt. Fengyu, Wang Xian saw a group of Mt. Fengyu disciples working on their cultivation.

As opposed to five days ago, he noticed that several new disciples were among the group.

Mentor Yu was in the midst of guiding the disciples when Wang Xian arrived. Everyone’s attention quickly turned to him!

There was a look of bewilderment on the faces of the new disciples as they were wondering who this man was.

“Wang Xian, you are here!”

Mentor Yu was delighted to see him and approached him after speaking to the disciples.

“Mentor Yu!”

Wang Xian smiled and acknowledged her.

“Come, take your cultivating resources!”

Mentor Yu led him towards one of the mountains.

“Here are a hundred spiritual stones from Mt. Fengyu. For being in the top twenty disciples in the ranking, you get five hundred spiritual stones every month. In addition, there are some elixir pills for you as well!”

Mentor Yu retrieved a blue bag from one of the rooms and tossed it at Wang Xian.

“Mentor Yu, I would like to go to Level 3 and 4 of the Scriptures Depository!” said Wang Xian to her.

“Level 3 and 4? Level 3 would be good enough for those from the Dan Realm or Budding Realm. But the arts and battle techniques in Level 4 are not something you can manage. Are the spiritual stones sufficient for you?” Mentor Yu said to Wang Xian.

“Yes!” Wang Xian said and nodded.

“Okay, here you go. Train hard!”

Mentor Yu tossed another token at Wang Xian. “There will be a spiritual tea session tomorrow afternoon. Mt. Fengyu is given ten invitations. Do make yourself available!”

“Spiritual tea session? What is that?” Wang Xian asked with slight amazement.

“At Mt. Lingcha we have over ten Level 7 spiritual tea trees. Anyone who drinks the tea made by its leaves will greatly benefit his cultivating skills. Don’t miss this golden opportunity!” Mentor Yu explained to Wang Xian.

“Over ten Level 7 spiritual tea trees?”

Wang Xian clicked his tongue slightly and hesitated for a while. “Alright, Mentor Yu. I will be there promptly tomorrow.” He nodded.

“Okay!” Mentor Yu smiled and left.

Wang Xian flew to the Scriptures Depository without any hesitation.

Soon he reached the mountain peak of the depository and darted through the familiar paths inside.

Om!

After entering Level 2, Wang Xian followed the path to Level 3.

To enter Level 3, it would require a large number of spiritual stones – two thousand to be exact for a stay of twelve hours.

Wang Xian looked at the slot at the side. He reached out for the space ring, retrieved the spiritual stones from it one by one and placed them into the slot.

Om!

As he entered into Level 3, Wang Xian swept his gaze across the area and noted that the size was much smaller than Level 2.

Battle Techniques Imaging Jade Stones were placed neatly on the shelves.

Compared to Level 2, there were only five such stones in Level 3.

Wang Xian headed straight ahead.

Sword Edge Storm, a middle-class battle technique upgraded from Sword Edge. To master this battle technique, one must first master the Sword Edge battle technique.

Sword Jail, a middle-class battle technique upgraded from Sword Imprisonment. To cultivate this battle technique, one must first master the Sword Edge battle technique.

Sword Cloud Sea, a middle-class battle technique upgraded from Sword Cloud. To cultivate this battle technique, one must first master the Sword Cloud battle technique.

Sword Alps, a middle-class battle technique upgraded from Sword Shield. To cultivate this battle technique, one must first master the Sword Shield battle technique.

Hidden Water, a middle-class battle technique upgraded from Water Clone and Hidden Mist. To cultivate this battle technique, one must first master the Water Clone and Hidden Mist battle techniques.

Wang Xian studied the Battle Techniques Imaging Jade Stones enthusiastically and tried to master them one by one.

Compared to the primary level battle technique, the middle-class battle technique was obviously far superior in power and tactics.

If any expert from the Dan Realm can master any middle-class battle technique, they are practically invincible within their ranks. This upgrade in power is even more superior to that which one can get from any spiritual equipment.

If any Budding Realm expert is capable of mastering two of these battle techniques, he will be regarded as a fearsome expert.

In less than half an hour, Wang Xian had cultivated five battle techniques as his own. He was now able to unleash these battle techniques at will.

Wang Xian’s face beamed with excitement as he looked at the entrance to Level 4.

Level 4 battle techniques are the high-class battle techniques that can only be used by the Immortals. Mastering these techniques will enable the Immortals to come up with their own unique superpowers!

Wang Xian recalled reading a record about such techniques from a book. He stared at the entrance to Level 4 and thought about whether he should proceed further.

Ten thousand spiritual stones for twelve hours. Okay, let’s go and take a look at what’s in there!

Wang Xian made up his mind and headed towards the entrance to Level 4. He could easily afford the ten thousand spiritual stones right now.

During the past few days, some of the forces brought him tens of thousands of spiritual stones along with the refining materials just to get into his good books.

Wang Xian had kept all of these stones.

Upon entering Level 4 and slotting the ten thousand spiritual stones, Wang Xian followed the path upwards.

This... This Level 4 merely has three rooms!

Wang Xian peered into the area of Level 4 with astonishment.

Unlike the other levels, there were no shelves in Level 4, only three individual rooms with words engraved on the doors to the rooms!

Great Waterfall Water Shockwave!

Dangerous Steam Explosive Power!

Sword Field!

Wang Xian marveled at the three rooms before deciding to enter the room of Great Waterfall Water Shockwave.

Inside the room, there was only one Battle Technique Imaging Jade Stone in the center of the room with no reference books.

The Jade Stone was about the size of a human head, which was about seven or eight times larger than the size of the Jade Stones in Level 2 and 3.

Wang Xian noticed there was a cushion facing the front of the room. He immediately walked towards it and sat down.

Om!

Just as he was sitting down, a shocking scene unfolded before his eyes.

The entire area before him, spanning a radius of ten kilometers and five kilometers in height, was quickly filled up by an oval-shaped seawater field.

In the middle of the seawater field was a blurry image of a man standing in it.

He moved his arm, and the seawater started to gush out from the inside as though a waterfall of tens of thousands of meters high. The force of the water swiftly swept forward.

In an instant, the seawater field looked like what one would witness on doomsday.

However, the scene dissipated slowly, replaced by the blurry image of the man who had started to create the horrid seawater field.

[Ding! Master the high-class battle technique! Great Waterfall Water Shockwave!]

Wang Xian felt like he’d been submerged under the water for a very long time before passing out. He regained consciousness after hearing a sound echoing from the system.

I did it! I have learned a high-level battle technique that can only be mastered by immortals!

Wang Xian’s eyes burned with passion, and he recalled how the Great Waterfall Water Shockwave was unleashed before him. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Even with my strong ability, I can only withstand the strength of the Great Waterfall Water Shockwave for three minutes. The consumption of my energy is too high!

Wang Xian clicked his tongue slightly.

Om!

In this instance, he felt a repulsive force being emitted inside the room.

What!? Twelve hours flew past just like that!
