Chapter 463: Pilgrimage (1)

Splatters!

The drizzle had since turned into a downpour and was kept out of the imposing island.

At this moment, however, heavy rain began to pour on the island.

The island was dead silent. All of the experts from Medical Saint Sect, Qiao Clan, and the seven forces halted their actions.

They were horrified as they gazed ahead.

Nobody had expected such a situation in just a brief moment of the frightening collision at that location.

The pouring rain showered them with chills.

“No, no. How is this possible? How can it be?”

Disbelief and fearful voices resounded in the air, cutting the moment of silence.

The Sect Master of Medical Saint Sect widened his eyes as he could not trust his eyes when he spotted the corpse on the floor. That was the Laozu of Bian Family!

He was also an unparalleled expert, one of the pillars of Medical Saint Sect.

However, he was instantly killed in that moment of collision!

A Dan Realm expert and an unparalleled expert were lying motionless on the floor. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The blow seemed to have brought them into hell.

“An unparalleled expert was struck down with one stroke. He’s the unparalleled expert. How can this be happening? Even the Supreme Elder of Medical Saint Sect was killed, we...”

The people from seven forces revealed desperate looks in their eyes.

They spun and looked around when they saw their clan disciples and comrades were already down by half.

Yet, there was not even a single death for the Dragon Sect, only five wounded ones who had been taken out of the battlefield for treatment.

Thrashing. An utter thrashing.

In particular in the battle of unparalleled experts. The three girls from the Dragon Sect were able to withstand the attacks of the two Supreme Elders of Medical Saint Sect and the Laozu of Qiao Clan.

Now, the Dragon King of the Dragon Sect killed another unparalleled expert with one blow again.

A strike, a kill.

And an unparalleled expert had fallen.

“Kill!”

Wang Xian let out a soft bellow with a frozen face when he looked at the Supreme Elder of Medical Saint Sect, who was being torn apart.

“Kill!”

Mo Qinglong let out a yell and rushed to Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan for a kill.

The demonic aura mixing with the fresh blood of enemies had turned the island into a living hell.

“No!”

“We surrender. No, no!”

As soon as the people from the seven forces witnessed the death of the unparalleled experts, they began to break down.

Even the unparalleled expert of Medical Saint Sect was killed, how far could they run? It was absolutely wishful thinking!

Given the current strength of the Dragon Sect, Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan were utterly finished.

Even they brought unparalleled experts here, they were fated to stay on that island.

“Why is the Dragon Sect so formidable?”

Yet, surrendering and despairing only sped up their deaths. Within seconds, another Inborn Expert was struck down.

After losing the Half-Step to Dan Realm Expert, there were no experts from Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan who could fight with Mo Qinglong and the rest.

The one-sided massacre had begun!

“No! Old Bian!”

Another Supreme Elder of Medical Saint Sect’s shrill roar cut through the air.

Wang Xian craned his neck with a cold expression as he looked at the Supreme Elder of Medical Saint Sect and Laozu of Qiao Clan.

“I told you this place would be the burial ground of Medical Saint Sect. From today onwards, there will be no more Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan!”

Wang Xian made a move and appeared in the air.

Xiao Yu, Elder Fang, Lan Qingyue, and finally, Wang Xian surrounded Laozu of Qiao Clan and Supreme Elder of Medical Saint Sect in the center.

“When you decided to turn up, didn’t you think of such consequences?” asked Wang Xian with a beaming smile as he stared at him coldly.

“Our Medical Saint Sect has been established for more than three hundred years. Little did we expect it would be destroyed in our hands!”

The Supreme Elder of Medical Saint Sect trembled as malevolence surfaced on his face. “But, Dragon King, don’t be insolent. Someone will avenge us. Someone! Haha, the time will come soon for the Dragon Sect to be wiped out!”

Hysterics filled his voice as he chortled.

A tinge of fear surged within the eyes of Laozu of Qiao Clan as he scanned for his chance to flee.

“Wipe the the Dragon Sect out? I’ll wipe the Medical Saint Sect out first!”

Coldness flashed in Wang Xian’s eyes as he made a move instantaneously.

Xiao Yu, Elder Fang, and Lan Qingyue followed suit.

There was no chance to flee even for the unparalleled experts in the face of the absolute thrashing strength.

Death shrouded them in a brief moment.

Be it air or land, the Battle of Sacred Sects had arrived at the final stage.

Endless screams resounded.

The desperate cries left the island reeking of blood.

Disciples of Medical Saint Sect perished one by one, and so it was with the disciples of Qiao Clan.

The experts of seven forces had already collapsed onto the floor a long time ago.

Slowly, the screams on the island could not be heard.

Bam!

When the two figures in the air plunged onto the island, it marked the end of the battle of the Sacred Sects.

Medical Saint Sect annihilated!

Qiao Clan annihilated!

The two Saint-class forces were gone from the underworld!

The crowd from Sui Clan and Xiao Clan were dumbfounded by what they had seen. Then they swept their gazes across all the people from the Dragon Sect.

The almost-invincible Dragon King, an insane group of girls, and the terrifying disciples of the Dragon Sect.

Gulp!

They swallowed their saliva with cold sweat breaking out on their foreheads.

Given their current dominating power, the Dragon Sect could annihilate them like a piece of cake, let alone Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan.

“Damm, only when Old Sui and I combine forces could we fight him manage to fight him with his current strength!”

Xiao Quanshan stared at Wang Xian with a somber expression.

By bringing down the Supreme Elder of Medical Saint Sect in a move, Wang Xian had struck a massive impact on him.

“That was the unparalleled expert who he killed in a single blow!”

He knew that only one person could achieve that in the past – the invincible fellow, Nie Wushuang of Donghua Sacred Sect.

Now, a young, twenty-year-old fellow did the same thing too. He was extremely envious and shocked.

“Announce to the Underworld to come for Pilgrimage tomorrow!” said Wang Xian to Mo Qinglong as he scanned the bodies on the floor.

“Yes!”

Mo Qinglong looked at the bodies and revealed a smile.

“Old Xiao and the rest from Sui Clan, thank you for coming over here. Now that we have resolved our matters, we need to settle some of our issues. If all of you aren’t leaving yet, you can stay at our place to enjoy yourself for a few days!”

Wang Xian looked at Xiao Quanshan and the rest of the people from Sui Clan with a beaming face.

“Haha, it’s impossible to leave at this time. Tomorrow will be the day of the Pilgrimage. We will be here to support you. I don’t think you’d mind, would you?”

Xiao Quanshan grinned as he spoke to Wang Xian.

“Sure, you’re most welcome!”

Wang Xian smiled and nodded his head.

“Great, see you tomorrow. Let’s go!”

Xiao Quanshan waved his dismissal as he made a swift move as he left the island.

The people from Sui Clan cupped their fists at Wang Xian and left subsequently.

On the Underworld forum, the Dragon Sect had released a message.

[Medical Saint Sect annihilated!]

[Qiao Clan annihilated!]
