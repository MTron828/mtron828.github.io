Chapter 993: 0994 was terrified

Translator: 5496903

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

An intense sound rang out as the terrifying thorns landed on Yun Hanhai’s body, producing an ear-piercing sound.

However, compared to the attacks on his body, the surrounding sounds were even more terrifying.

The miserable cries caused Yun Hanhai’s entire body to go numb.

The Zhan Hai mercenary group at the side looked at this scene in a daze.

Slaughter, it was a simple slaughter.

Many thorns crawled out from the ground, attacking the young master’s group.

Other than Yun Han Hai, who had a Type 7 transcendent armor to defend against the thorns, the rest of the 19 were not so lucky.

Even the 2 type 6 experts were pierced through by the thorns.

They couldn’t put up any resistance at all.

This made them feel exceptionally terrifying.

They looked at the miserable-looking young man and couldn’t help but swallow a mouthful of saliva. Their hearts were filled with fear.

He was able to unleash terrifying attacks with such serious injuries. If he was at his peak, wouldn’t he be able to insta-kill them even more easily?

If Wang Xian’s attack made the members of the Zhan Hai mercenary group feel fearful.

At this moment, Yun Hanhai’s body began to tremble violently.

He was wearing the life-saving armor given to him by his father.

It was a level seven extraordinary flame armor!

However, Yun Hanhai’s body was trembling slightly as he felt the strength of the thorns landing on his body.

His body was emitting a scorching heat as though his entire body was wrapped in lava.

His eyes were trembling non-stop.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

Five seconds later, the screams came to an abrupt end. One by one, the corpses fell to the ground.

“This... how is this possible... how can he be so strong? This is impossible!”

Yun Hanhai mumbled as he looked at Wang Xian who was standing more than ten meters away in disbelief.

Wang Xian looked at him as well. There was no emotion on his face. “An armor of transcendent level seven. He is really rich!”

He smiled and slowly raised the lightning strike wood in his hand.

Seeing that he was about to attack again, Yun Hanhai widened his eyes and was filled with panic.

“No... Don’t kill me. I’m in the wrong. Don’t kill me!”

Yun Hanhai pleaded with Wang Xian.

“Kneel down!”

Wang Xian said to him indifferently.

Yun Hanhai’s expression changed drastically. Following that, he knelt on the ground with a thud.

“I beg you, please don’t kill me. Our young master’s mercenary group will never dare to provoke you again. Give me a chance. I’ll Give You Spirit Stones. I’ll give you as many as you want!”

Yun Hanhai’s eyes were slightly red as he cried at Wang Xian. He no longer had the arrogance from before.

The amethyst mercenary group at the side looked at Yun Hanhai kneeling and begging for mercy with a complicated expression.

This was the deputy leader of the young master’s mercenary group, the famous young master Yun in the Demon Hunters Academy. However, he was now kneeling down and begging for mercy in front of a new student.

If the students in the Demon Hunters Academy were to know about this, it would definitely cause a huge commotion.

“The flaw is out!”

Wang Xian looked at Yun Hanhai kneeling on the ground. A smile appeared on his face as he moved the lightning strike wood in his hand.

A thorn came out from the ground and pierced through Yun Hanhai’s body in an instant.

As for where it came from, it was hard to describe.

A broken chrysanthemum.

“You...”

Yun Hanhai widened his eyes. His eyes were filled with despair and unwillingness.

The girls from the amethyst mercenary group and the young men from the Zhan Hai mercenary group revealed a hint of fear in their eyes.

He had actually killed Yun Hanhai.

This was the most outstanding disciple of the Yun family in Donghai City, the deputy leader of the young master’s mercenary group!

If the Yun family found out about this, how could they let him off?

“Phew!”

Wang Xian exhaled heavily and turned his head to look at the people of the Zhan Hai mercenary group.

The leader of the Zhan Hai mercenary group and the young men trembled when they saw him looking over.

“Student... Student Wang, young master Wang, we... We were forced just now. Please...”

“Leader!”

Before he could finish his sentence, Ao Jian and the rest suddenly appeared. When they saw Wang Xian, they immediately flew over.

The arrival of Ao Jian and the rest interrupted the conversation of the members of the Zhan Hai mercenary group. With outsiders around, they all addressed Wang Xian as their leader.

Wang Xian looked at Ao Jian and sensed the group of strange monsters around them. A smile appeared on his face.

“Kill them!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He pointed at the members of the Zhan Hai mercenary group and said calmly.

“It’s the leader!”

Ao Jian and the rest nodded. Without any pause, they charged towards the members of the Zhan Hai mercenary group.

“Leader Wang...”

The faces of the members of the Zhan Hai mercenary group changed drastically. They shouted at Wang Xian with an embarrassed look on their faces as they hurriedly blocked the attacks of Ao Jian and the rest.

However, their strength was at least at level five of the supernatural realm. Some of them were even at level four of the supernatural realm. They were no match for Ao Jian and the rest.

Very soon, the screams of the members of the Zhan Hai mercenary group could be heard.

Wang Xian ignored them. If he wanted to kill them, he had to be prepared to be killed.

Even if they were students of the Demon Hunters Academy.

Wang Xian took a look at the members of the amethyst mercenary group and sat cross-legged on the ground to continue recovering from his injuries.

The group of girls from the amethyst mercenary group felt a chill down their spines when they saw the corpses on the ground.

The young master’s mercenary group consisted of twenty people while the Zhan Hai mercenary group consisted of more than ten people.

All of them were elite students of the Demon Hunters Academy. However, they were killed by that freshman.

The group of girls looked at each other, their eyes filled with complicated emotions.

If they had targeted him back then, would they have ended up like young master’s mercenary group and Zhan Hai’s mercenary group?

But now, no matter what, he was their savior.

“Gentlemen, please tell Commander Wang after he wakes up. We will definitely repay his kindness today!”

“The Yun family is a famous family in Donghai city. Everyone in the Demon Hunters Academy knows that Yun Hanhai has come to Thunder Island to kill Commander Wang. Therefore, tell him to be careful. We will take our leave First!”

The group of girls stood there and hesitated for a while. Then, deputy commander Xiao said to Ao Jian and the rest who were standing around Wang Xian.

“Alright!”

Ao jian nodded at her.

Deputy Chief Xiao waved his hand at the group of girls beside him. He came to a spot not far away and sat down to recuperate as well.

“The injuries this time are really serious!”

After more than ten hours, Wang Xian woke up. Looking at the wounds on his body that had already recovered, a smile appeared on his face.

Lightning Wood: first level void interpretation

A wood-attributed void interpretation item with the Lightning attribute. It contained a strong vitality.

“A treasure of the void-seeing level with wood attribute can continue to grow and evolve on the ancestral tree. However, it is a good choice to use it as my weapon now!”

Wang Xian looked at the thunderstruck wood and stood up slowly.

After more than ten hours, Wang Xian’s injuries had mostly recovered due to his strong recovery ability and the vitality in the thunderstruck wood.

“Ao Yao, have you killed all the thunderfish on the mountain peak?”
