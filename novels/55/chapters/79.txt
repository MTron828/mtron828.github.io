Chapter 80: Luxurious Shopping (1)

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“Su Nan Shopping Mall is the largest mall in Rivertown and carries many world-wide brands. Let’s go to this mall.”

Wang Xian led them into the mall. He had been to this mall once and spent over $50,000 on three sets of clothes.

“Alright, let’s go then.”

Jia Wenrui smiled and walked in.

“The guys’ section is on the second floor and the girls’ section is at level three. Let’s head to the second floor first. I’d like to get two sets of clothes.” Jia Wenrui’s lips curved into a smile as he spoke to the group behind him.

“Alright, alright. Let’s follow and take a look.” The other guys smiled and followed Jia Wenrui.

It was clear that Jia Wenrui was rich and had treated them to meals. Therefore, they were seeing him as the leader of the group.

“Let’s go.” Jia Wenrui waved his hand and walked at the front of the group.

Xiao Yu held on to Wang Xian’s arm and followed behind while looking at the surroundings.

When the group arrived at the second floor, Jia Wenrui headed to the Armani Specialty Store and walked in confidently.

The group followed. When they saw the price tags on the clothes, the group of guys couldn’t help but shake their heads.

“It’s so expensive! Just a casual shirt costs $700-800. There are even some that cost a few thousand,” Xiao Yu said to Wang Xian.

“Yeah. It’s a world-wide brand and it’s natural that the price isn’t cheap!” Wang Xian nodded his head.

“Yeah, it’s really expensive. Even I can’t afford such luxurious clothes,” Xiao Mi stuck out her tongue and said.

“Is it expensive?” At this moment, Jiang Shuang’s voice sounded from the side. She gave an indifferent look at Xiao Yu and commented, “A $700-$800 shirt is common. Armani is world-wide. Wearing it naturally allows one to have a different disposition. One’s disposition has a lot to do with the clothes they are wearing. You wouldn’t understand even if I explain to you.”

Jiang Shuang had a slightly arrogant look on her and was clearly looking down on Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi.

It was especially so for Xiao Yu. All her clothes together wouldn’t cost more than $200 and yet she was able to attract the attention of Jia Wenrui. This made her really jealous of Xiao Yu.

When Xiao Yu heard her comments, she pouted slightly. However, she didn’t say anything. She knew that she couldn’t compete with others when it came to money and she didn’t want to make such comparisons.

Wang Xian looked plainly at Jiang Shuang.

“Xiao Yu, what do you think about these clothes on me?”

At this moment, Jia Wenrui had just changed into a new set of clothes. He walked in front of Xiao Yu.

“It’s pretty good.” Xiao Yu answered perfunctorily and nodded her head.

“Wenrui, I feel that a blue shirt would look better on you. Although white matches well with black, blue would be more suitable.”

Jiang Shuang immediately walked over to Jia Wenrui from the side and suggested to him.

“It’s alright, I’ll just take these.” Jia Wenrui smiled and shook his head at Jiang Shuang. After which, he turned to Wang Xian and said, “Senior, let me pick a set of clothes and gift them to you.”

When Wang Xian heard the sudden words from Jia Wenrui, he shook his head and replied, “Thank you. That’s not necessary.”

“It’s fine, it’s fine.” Jia Wenrui smiled and looked to Xiao Yu. “You are Xiao Yu’s brother and I’ll need to get on your good books! Moreover, a set of clothes only costs a few thousands and that’s nothing to me. I hope that our relationship could be better. Hehe.”

As Jia Wenrui spoke, he had a confident smile on. He knew the family conditions of Xiao Yu and Wang Xian. Therefore, he was very confident.

He believed that he was really outstanding to the point that Xiao Yu, and even her brother, wouldn’t possibly reject him.

Therefore, Jia Wenrui didn’t say it in a more subtle way. Upon hearing his words, Xiao Yu frowned slightly.

Wang Xian also raised his eyebrows. He noticed Xiao Yu’s response and said directly, “It’s alright. You are not the type my sister is fond of so you wouldn’t have to do so.”

He knew that Xiao Yu wasn’t fond of Jia Wenrui but was too shy to reject him. Therefore, he said it for her and rejected him directly.

Jia Wenrui’s face stiffened upon hearing Wang Xian words and was speechless.

A face to face rejection! Moreover, it’s a direct and clear rejection. This made him feel shameful.

The surrounding people were also slightly shocked. They had not expected Wang Xian to be so direct in his rejection of Jia Wenrui.

When Jiang Shuang heard Wang Xian’s reply, a tinge of joy flashed in her eyes. However, when she saw the embarrassment on Jia Wenrui’s face, she quickly walked in front of him and said, “Wenrui, you are really outstanding. It’s her who is not deserving of you. Your family conditions are great and you are good looking. There would be many girls who would be fond of you.”

“Senior, aren’t you going a little overboard by being so direct. You should at least give him some face,” a guy by the side said to Wang Xian after noticing the displeasure on Jia Wenrui’s face. [1]

“I was just speaking the truth.” Wang Xian said with indifference. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Tsk. Alright, I thought too much into this.” Jia Wenrui looked a little embarrassed. He stared at Wang Xian and sneered, “Since senior couldn’t tell who’s sincere, forget it then.”

Wang Xian smiled and didn’t say another word. In his eyes, these guys in front of him were still too young and childish.

Arrogant, show off, childish, materialistic.

“Wenrui, why go and try to get on the good books of an inferior person? Do you still want to get some clothes, I’ll help you pick some.” Jiang Shuang looked at him and tried to console him.

“It’s fine.” Jia Wenrui shook his head while looking at Jiang Shuang. “Let’s go get your clothes. I’ll buy a set for you.”

“Really? You are the best, Wenrui!” Jiang Shuang was taken aback and spoke in ecstasy.

“Let’s go.” Jia Wenrui took a glance at Wang Xian and Xiao Yu with a heavy expression before heading to the third floor. Jiang Shuang was full of smiles as she followed behind and the group of guys quickly followed too.

Wang Xian saw that the group had left before looking to Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi by her side. He shrugged his shoulders and asked, “Do you all still want to follow them?”

Xiao Mi had a bitter look and looked to Xiao Yu. “We don’t belong to the same circle as them. Why don’t we go on our own?”

“Yeah.” Xiao Yu nodded her head. She hesitated before adding, “We are really not the same kind. Let’s not follow them. After all, we will not be in the same class in the future.”

“Alright, alright. Let’s go. Didn’t I say I’d get you a big gift before school starts? Let’s go up too.” Wang Xian looked at her and smiled.

“Hmm? Brother, why don’t we head back? Bring us to somewhere more interesting!” Xiao Yu lifted her head and looked at him.

“We can leave that for tomorrow. Let’s get you some stuff today.”

Wang Xian’s lips curved into a smile as he said to Xiao Yu. “It will be fine. Just follow me.”

“Brother, what are we doing upstairs?” Xiao Yu asked in doubt.

“Of course, to buy things!” Wang Xian smiled and pulled her to the lift.

“Huh? It’s alright brother. The clothes here are too expensive.” Xiao Yu shook her head immediately.

“Don’t argue. Just follow!” Wang Xian turned his head around and spoke with a strong tone.

“Oh!” Seeing her brother acting this way, Xiao Yu pouted and simply followed.

The third floor was entirely for the ladies. Various worldwide brands were all gathered on this floor.

When they arrived at the third floor, Wang Xian looked straight to a shop. Prada!

There’s a rather famous movie called The Queen Who Wears Prada.

Prada was a luxury brand among luxury brands. It was an existence of the highest tier.

It shall be this shop then!
