2565 2565 clashing head-on

“Reporting to sect master, other than the Warriors in the Abyss, all the grade nine sky sect warriors have arrived!”

“Reporting to sect master, all the demon slaying sect warriors have arrived!”

On the grade nine sky sect planet, in the valley of the grade nine sky sect’s main hall, the sound of notification resounded!

There were already more than a thousand people standing around the entire hall. Soon, more than a hundred undying godly monarch warriors walked over from the entrance!

In the hall, everyone’s faces were filled with a cold glint as murderous auras burst out from their bodies!

When the experts from the demon slaying sect saw the three elders and a middle-aged man sitting in front of them, their hearts trembled slightly!

This time, it was because of them that it erupted!

This made the experts from the demon slaying sect slightly apprehensive!

“All the disciples are here!”

The sect master of the ninth-grade sky sect looked around and said in a deep voice!

“Sect master, this matter started because of our demon Slayer sect. This matter, our demon Slayer sect...”

“Alright!”

The sect master of the demon Slayer sect stepped forward and cupped his hands as he said nervously. However, before he could finish his words, he was interrupted!

“This is no longer a matter of your demon Slayer sect!”

The sect master of the Ninth Grade Heaven Sect said coldly!

“Sect master, two newly rising forces dare to provoke us. Today, we will directly charge forward and destroy them!”

A burly old man directly stepped forward and said with killing intent!

“Hehe, what do you all think?”

The sect master of the Ninth Grade Heaven sect slightly raised his head and asked coldly!

“Kill! Destroy the Dragon Palace and the Tiger Demon Country! Let them know how powerful we are!”

“No one has dared to provoke us for more than 100,000 years. Today, we will let the people of the southern star system know how powerful our ninth grade Sky sect is!”

A cold voice sounded!

“Let’s Go!”

The next moment, the sect master of the ninth grade sky sect suddenly stood up and roared with killing intent!

“Disciples of the ninth grade Sky sect, first, second, third, fourth, and fifth grade army, get ready!”

“Guard the sect with 300 undying godly monarchs. The rest of the experts will follow the sect leader and patriarch into battle!”

“The Undying Dragon Palace, Tiger Chaos Demon Country, will not return. All disciples, prepare!”

“Open the war teleportation array and head to Dragon Star immediately!”

Very quickly, orders rang out within the ninth-grade sky sect’s domain. The entire ninth-grade sky sect immediately moved!

What kind of scene was it when a huge faction that had stood tall in the southern star system for 50 to 60 million years moved?

In the sky, terrifying battleships rose one after another. Each battleship could easily destroy a star!

Even an undying god King Level 6 expert would have to flee in panic in front of them!

There were more than a dozen battleships of this level!

They were all born for War!

The ninth grade sky sect had a total of nine legions, ranging from first to ninth grade!

And this time, the five legions came out in unison!

Within the ninth grade sky sect’s domain, large-scale teleportation formations were activated one after another. Such teleportation formations would only be activated during a war!

Over a dozen battleships that were over a thousand kilometers in size entered the teleportation formation, crossing the void in a terrifying manner, teleporting through the Void of the southern star system!

When the entire ninth grade celestial sect was in motion, everyone could sense a terrifying energy sweeping across the void!

Half an hour later, the news of the ninth grade celestial sect’s expedition to the dragon star immediately spread throughout the entire southern star system!

“This... It’s only been a few hours, but the entire ninth grade celestial sect is actually in motion. They are actually charging straight for the Dragon Star!”

“It seems that the ninth-grade heaven sect is completely enraged. It is said that all the experts have gone on an expedition. They are going to destroy the Dragon Palace and the Tiger Riot Demon Kingdom!”

“They have gone too far this time. The Dragon Palace and the Tiger Riot Demon Kingdom have gone too far this time. The ninth-grade heaven sect is one of the oldest forces standing in our void. They are completely enraged!”

“Hiss, is the war about to break out? It has only been three hours, and the ninth-grade heaven sect is going to go on an expedition to destroy the Dragon Palace and the Tiger Riot Demon Kingdom. I’m afraid that they didn’t expect it either!”

“Hahaha, you dare to provoke our ninth-grade heaven sect? Just wait to be exterminated, you two idiots!”

When some of the people on the AI received the news, their faces were filled with shock! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

All the factions were somewhat shocked by the ninth-grade heaven sect’s swift and decisive expedition!

The Dragon Palace, Tiger, and troubled demon nation’s provocation had only been a few hours, and the entire ninth-grade heaven sect was already on the move. It seemed that they were completely enraged!

“The Dragon Palace and tiger chaotic demon country have gone too far this time. I’m afraid they will have to pay a heavy price!”

“It’s not just a heavy price. I reckon that the dragon star is about to be destroyed. Even if the Dragon King and the tiger chaotic demon country’s National Advisor have undying King level seven combat strength, they won’t be a match for the ninth grade Sky sect!”

“Haha, they dare to provoke our ninth grade sky sect. That Dragon Palace and tiger chaotic demon country will definitely be destroyed!”

Some people in the AI were discussing animatedly. They did not think highly of the Dragon Palace and Chaotic Tiger Demon Country!

Even now, they had an undying godly monarch level seven expert overseeing them!

...

However, the ninth-grade Sky sect’s foundation was definitely not something they could shake!

The people and disciples in the ninth-grade sky sect’s domain were even mocking wantonly on the AI!

At this moment, everyone was paying attention to the ninth-grade sky sect’s expedition!

“Not good, Dragon King. The ninth-grade heaven sect is rushing towards us. They want to destroy us!”

At the location of the Dragon Star, the experts from the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation came to the Dragon Palace and spoke anxiously!

They were also panicking in the face of such a huge overlord!

“I have received the news. Don’t panic. Get ready to welcome them!”

The corners of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly as he spoke to the king of Chaotic Tiger Nation and the rest calmly!

Since they had issued a challenge, Wang Xian and the rest had already prepared for the worst!

However, the speed of the ninth-grade Heaven Sect’s expedition had already exceeded his expectations!

“Dragon King, are you confident?”

...

The old imperial preceptor frowned slightly!

“How many level seven immortal king powerhouses will they send?”

Wang Xian looked at him and asked with a smile!

“At most five, maybe less than five. However, the level 6 immortal king powerhouses from the ninth-grade heaven sect might be much more than us!”

The old National Advisor said with some concern!

“Don’t worry. Get ready and calm the guests on Dragon Star. Let’s go out!”

As Wang Xian spoke, his body moved and flew out directly!

Boom! Boom! Boom

Soon, the members of the Dragon Palace followed him and landed on a planet around Dragon Star!

“Send someone to appease the guests of Dragon Star and follow closely behind the Dragon Palace!”

When the old National Master saw Wang Xian’s confident look, he gritted his teeth and said directly!

Since he was prepared to follow the Dragon Palace, he should prepare for the worst!

“Dragon King!”

On a planet in the sky above Dragon Star, Heaven Array looked at Wang Xian and shouted with a smile!

“Have you received the news? Get Ready!”

Wang Xian asked Heaven Array!

“Dragon King, wait and see the attack methods of my formation!”

Heaven Array’s lips curled up slightly as he looked into the void!

He was once the God of Heaven Array!
