Chapter 1470: The destruction of 1470 second-rate forces 4

“You’re the ones who will die!”

In front of Ren Xingchen, the Li clan leader and the other four experts at the profound void tier attacked at an extreme speed.

The four of them were like a cat catching a mouse, wanting to be the first to behead Ren Xingchen.

However, just as they rushed into the air, a cold voice sounded.

The voice was emotionless, like the sound of a sharp sword colliding.

“Who is it? !”

The Li clan leader who was rushing forward instantly felt a terrifying sharp light rushing towards his heart, causing the expression of the body that was rushing forward to change slightly, and he hurriedly swept his surroundings.

The expressions of the other three fourth level profound void martial experts also changed slightly, revealing a vigilant expression.

“Be careful!”

At this moment, the three elders of the towering sky sword sect, who were standing at the back and watching everything proudly, saw the four golden figures, and their expressions changed slightly.

“Eh?”

Around them, the 5,000 to 6,000 people gathered nearby, as well as the people from the 20 to 30 aristocratic families, were slightly shocked, their gazes fixed on them.

“There are four figures rushing over!”

An expert at the fifth rank of the profound void martial stage had a solemn expression as he spoke in a low voice.

“Who? This fellow’s accomplice?”

The Li Clan’s clan leader and the other three clan leaders’expressions also changed slightly as they hurriedly raised their heads to look.

“Pu Pu Pu!”

However, before the four of them could react, four golden longswords that were exactly the same arrived at their necks.

The sound of sharp swords entering their heads could be heard, and in an instant, four heads flew up.

“What?”

When they saw the Li clan leader and the other four rank 4 profound void martial artists being killed in an instant, everyone had shocked expressions on their faces.

Four middle-aged men holding long swords appeared in front of everyone.

They held golden long swords, and there wasn’t a single trace of blood on their swords.

One kill!

The four of them stood in front of Ren Xingchen, without any expression on their faces, as if they were killing machines.

The golden swordfish that had already cultivated the heartless sword principle had no feelings at this stage.

Only when they had cultivated the heartless sword principle to the great success stage would they be able to restrain their feelings.

“Such powerful strength!”

“They killed the Li family’s patriarch and the other two in one move. They... They must be fifth level void interpretation experts!”

“Who... who are these four young men?”

The surrounding experts and disciples of the aristocratic families were shocked when they saw the Li family leader and the rest being killed instantly. They stared at them in astonishment.

The Li family and the three people who attacked earlier had a drastic change in expression when they saw this scene. They were extremely embarrassed.

Song Wan and the song family were even more stunned!

“Senior!”

Ren Xingchen saw the four of them standing in front of him. Naturally, he knew that it was Wang Xian who asked them to attack.

He bowed respectfully to the four Golden Swordfish of the fourth level of the Seethrough realm and thanked them.

“Who are you?”

When the three elders of the towering sky sword sect saw the four golden swordfish that suddenly appeared, their expressions changed slightly and revealed a serious expression.

The four of them before them had the strength of the fifth level of the Seethrough realm and were on the same level as them!

“I just arrived at the vast region and already saw such an overbearing sect. Hehe!”

Wang Xian walked over slowly in the air with a group of golden swordfish following behind him.

“HMM?”

The three elders of the Atlas Sword sect immediately looked at Wang Xian and glanced at the group of golden swordfish beside him. They frowned slightly and their eyes flashed with coldness.

The rest of the people around also shifted their gaze to Wang Xian. They were filled with astonishment.

“What faction are you guys from?”

Elder Qi looked at Wang Xian and all the golden swordfish behind him and asked with a solemn face.

“A small faction from a small place!”

Wang Xian raised his head and looked at elder Qi. He said with a smile on his face.

“Sir, you saved my life again!”

Ren Xingchen looked at Wang Xian and bowed to express his gratitude.

Wang Xian shook his head lightly.

“A faction in the Liuhai Region?”

The three elders of the towering sky sword sect raised their eyebrows and looked at each other before asking coldly.

“There’s no need to wait any longer for revenge. If anyone dares to stop you, I will kill him!”

Wang Xian ignored the three elders and spoke to Ren Xingchen calmly.

“Thank you, Sir!”

Ren Xingchen nodded his head gratefully. He held the longsword in his hand tightly again and stared at the song clan.

“Huh?”

When the three elders of the Atlas Sword sect saw that Wang Xian was ignoring them, they looked a little embarrassed.

When they heard his words, their faces turned cold as well.

The faces of everyone from the song clan changed slightly as well.

“What... What does that young man mean? Why is he going against the Atlas Sword Sect?”

“A force from the Liuhai region? He dares to challenge the Atlas Sword Sect? Does he not know the strength of the Atlas Sword Sect?”

When the surrounding aristocratic families heard Wang Xian’s words, they were slightly stunned as they spoke in astonishment.

However, while everyone was in a daze, Ren Xingchen, who was standing in the middle, started to move.

He held the longsword in his hand tightly and attacked the people of the song clan directly.

“Elder Qi, save us!”

Song Wan’s expression changed drastically when she saw Ren Xingchen attacking them directly. She quickly exclaimed.

“Frog at the bottom of a well, are you trying to make an enemy out of our Atlas Sword Sect?”

When elder Qi saw Ren Xingchen attacking him directly, a murderous look appeared on his face. He questioned Wang Xian coldly.

A terrifying murderous aura came charging at him directly.

Wang Xian didn’t even look at him. He just looked at Ren Xingchen quietly.

“You’re courting death!”

An angry look appeared on the Elder’s face. With a wave of his hand, he slashed his hand sword at Ren Xingchen.

“Bang!”

“Kill!”

However, the moment the sky high sword sect elder made his move, a golden swordfish also made its move.

With a wave of the long sword in his hand, the golden swordfish shattered his attack and charged towards him without any hesitation.

“You’re courting death. A small force dares to provoke us!”

When the elder saw the Golden Swordfish charging towards him, he roared furiously.

A golden longsword appeared in his hand and slashed towards the golden swordfish.

“Attack!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Elder Qi’s expression changed slightly. His face was cold and his killing intent seemed to be corporeal. A longsword appeared in his hand.

Together with the elder, they attacked the Golden Swordfish.

“Whoever tries to stop us will be killed!”

At the back, a Golden Swordfish’s cold voice rang out as it faced elder Qi.

“Haha, you actually dare to look down on our towering sky sword sect. Good, good!”

The last elder at the fifth level of the Seethrough realm sneered with a gloomy face. He unsheathed his sword and rushed out as well.

“Die!”

The three elders of the towering sky sword sect took action. The third Golden Swordfish also took action.

Whoever took action would be killed!

Wang Xian stood there and watched quietly.

“This... They are really daring. This is the territory of the Atlas Sword sect. Behind them is the land of the Atlas Sword sect. There are more than 10,000 disciples and all the strong ones are within the sect!”

When everyone around saw that the three golden swordfish really dared to face the three elders of the Atlas Sword sect, they were all dumbfounded.
