Chapter 962: The young man 0963 was not bad

Translator: 549690339

The atmosphere was a little quiet.

Even the people from the Chamber of Commerce and the mercenary group behind were dumbfounded.

What the hell was going on?

That young man was a new student of the Demon Hunter College, and this group of people were the higher-ups of the Demon Hunter College!

They were in a standoff now?

What the hell?

Wang Xian did not expect this group of people to be the higher-ups of the Demon Hunter College.

He thought that they were the mercenary group hired by the Ivy and Zhou Chamber of Commerce.

Therefore, he didn’t have a good impression of them.

However, he didn’t expect them to be the higher-ups of the Demon Hunter College.

They hadn’t even entered the college yet and were already fighting with the higher-ups of the college. How were they supposed to continue their studies?

Wang Xian was a little embarrassed.

He had sensed the strength of this group of people just now. The green-armored elder was at level eight, while the rest were at level seven and level six. The lowest level was level six!

However, with his strength and the strength of the strange demon, he wasn’t afraid of them at all. That was why he didn’t hold back at all.

However, he didn’t expect that...

“This... teacher, I’m Sorry!”

Wang Xian moved his palm slightly and placed the middle-aged man down.

It was really a sin to accidentally torture a teacher.

The expression on the middle-aged man’s face was also very interesting. His body moved and he immediately came to the side of the green-armored old man.

“Are you really a new student of the Demon Hunter College?”

The green-armored old man asked in astonishment when he saw Wang Xian let go of the middle-aged man.

“UH... Yes!”

Wang Xian moved his palm and a notice of admission for the Demon Hunter College appeared in his hand.

“Are you a new student?”

The white-haired old man beside him still found it unbelievable and couldn’t help but ask.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

This time, the expressions of the group of people became even more interesting.

A new student was able to pinch an elite instructor of the academy with one hand. His strength was at least at level seven of the supernatural realm!

Just now, they were still bewildered. Where did this monstrous young man come from? He actually possessed such terrifying strength.

But never did they expect that in the blink of an eye, he would become a new student of their academy!

This...

“I never thought that our academy would actually have such a terrifying new student, it’s really...”

The azure armored old man didn’t know what to say. To the Demon Hunter Academy, having a monstrous new student within the academy was definitely a joyous occasion.

But the situation before their eyes...

“The young man’s strength is very strong, but... En, being young and frivolous is also a good thing, but you can’t go too far, or else you might suffer a loss!”

The green-armored old man really wanted to say that young people shouldn’t be too arrogant, but after thinking about it, he changed his words.

Such a monstrous young man, wasn’t it normal for him to be arrogant? Especially since he was a student of their demon Hunter Academy, he should be confident and arrogant!

“Dean, there might be a misunderstanding between us. We were originally in the same caravan as them, but they threatened us, asking us to take out more resources. We had no choice but to leave their caravan!”

Jin Liuyan said immediately.

“That’s right, director. Commander Wang and the rest were hired by us. We thought that you were in cahoots with them. That’s why we were so rude to you when we met just now!”

Zhou Hanhan also walked out and said to the green-armored elder.

“Oh? I See!”

The green-armored elder pondered for a moment and nodded slowly. “Since it’s a misunderstanding, let’s not be so hostile!”

“I’m sorry, Director. It might really be a misunderstanding!”

Wang Xian nodded as well. With a move of his arm, a corpse was thrown from his interspatial ring to supervisor du and elder Xiao.

“Peng!”

“The Deputy Leader of the Spirit Beast mercenary group was sent by you guys to kill us, right?”

Wang Xian swept his cold gaze across the two of them.

“Hiss, it’s deputy leader Ling’s corpse. How could it be? Why would deputy leader Ling’s corpse be with them?”

“This... could it be... could it be that the green vine chamber of Commerce and the Xiao Chamber of Commerce sent vice-leader Ling to assassinate the Zhou Chamber of Commerce? !”

“It must be. For the fierce beast corpse on the body of the Zhou Chamber of Commerce. I didn’t expect it. I really didn’t expect it!”

Elder Xiao and supervisor Du’s pupils couldn’t help but shrink when they saw the corpse.

The people of the Chamber of Commerce and the mercenary group behind all widened their eyes and discussed with gloomy faces.

They finally understood that the reason why the Ivy and Xiao Chamber of Commerce didn’t allow them to hijack the Zhou Chamber of Commerce was because they wanted to do it themselves and obtain the money.

It wasn’t a righteous act at all!

Crafty, really crafty!

“What? The people from the Spirit Beast mercenary group came to assassinate us?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Father Zhou and the rest were also slightly stunned. Their faces revealed an embarrassed expression.

They were trying to exterminate all of them. If it wasn’t for Wang Xian, they would definitely be dead by now!

The green-armored elder finally understood from the discussion of the people behind him. His face immediately darkened.

They were being used. He didn’t expect them to be used.

They saved a bunch of people who shouldn’t be saved.

Wang Xian took a deep look at supervisor du and elder Xiao. Then, he swept his gaze across all the people from the Chamber of Commerce and the mercenary group.

“Vice-principal, dear teachers, we can be considered to have gotten to know each other without fighting. It was my student who was reckless just now. I can only take out some food to apologize!”

Following that, Wang Xian took out three ghost-faced crabs with a smile and said to them.

“Haha, Good, good. I really didn’t expect that our East Sea Demon Hunters Academy would produce such a monstrous new student!”

The green-armored elder laughed and waved his hand. Everyone walked over and said, “This is a slap in the face. However, we are very happy to see such a prodigy enter our demon Hunters Academy!”

“Are the students nowadays so terrifying?”

The middle-aged man who was held by Wang Xian shook his head bitterly.

“That’s right. He’s already qualified to be a teacher in our Academy!”

A few middle-aged elders beside him nodded their heads in agreement.

A new student who possessed the strength of a violent teacher was so freakish that he was the only one in the demon Hunters Academy.

However, the appearance of such a student was also of great benefit to the entire academy.

“Come, come, teachers and principals. Let Us Cook for you. Hehe, Hehe!”

Father Zhou was excited when he saw this scene. He quickly prepared himself.

Wang Xian invited them to sit down and started a conversation with them.

The teachers and vice principals of the Demon Hunters Academy were extremely curious about Wang Xian. They kept asking him all sorts of questions.

The vice principals even invited Wang Xian to join the East Ocean Demon Hunters Academy after he graduated.

Not only that, they even offered him a lot of benefits when the school was about to start.

The deputy dean even waved his hand and gave Wang Xian a house that was close to the demon Hunters Academy.

They wanted to recruit Wang Xian.

Such a young and terrifying student, they naturally wanted to recruit him.

After witnessing his strength, it could no longer be described as a genius.

Now, with Wang Xian’s strength, he could be considered as a powerhouse.

A powerhouse that could intimidate an entire region.

It was definitely worth it to befriend such a powerhouse with unlimited potential!
