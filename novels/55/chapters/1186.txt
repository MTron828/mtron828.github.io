Chapter 1187: 1,188 alchemy masters? below

Translator: 5496903

The alchemy clan was the one with the greatest expenditure among all professions, and it was also the most difficult one.

If one wanted to nurture an alchemy master, they needed a large amount of spirit herbs for him to practice.

Alchemy wasn’t refining weapons. Materials that failed in refining weapons could still be used a second time, but if one failed in refining pills, all the spirit herbs would be wasted.

To nurture an alchemy master, one needed a large amount of spirit herbs for him to practice.

Take Long Luo as an example. In order to successfully refine an extraordinary level four medicinal pill, she had wasted a lot of spiritual herbs.

It was fortunate that she was the princess of the Radiant Empire and didn’t care about these spiritual herbs. If it were any other ordinary person, their face would have turned black if they had wasted so much spiritual herbs.

This was also the reason why medicinal pills were more precious and alchemists were rarer and more expensive.

“Why don’t you give it a try?”

Wang Xian looked at the two of them who didn’t believe him. He smiled faintly and looked into the room in front of him.

Long Luo’s room was open. The alchemy furnace and the spiritual herbs beside her were placed aside.

He moved his arm and a stream of water swept the spiritual herbs inside.

“Grade-4 spiritual herb? Long Luo, show me the formula of the elixir that you need to refine!”

Wang Xian said directly to long luo.

“You... you really want to refine it?”

Long Luo looked at him in surprise. “Big Brother, don’t joke around. Do you really know how to refine pills?”

“Give me the formula?”

Wang Xian stretched out his hand towards her.

“You don’t even know the formula for an extraordinary grade-4 pill. How can you say that you know how to refine pills?”

Long Luo pouted. Her face was filled with disbelief, but she still handed him a pill formula.

Wang Xian smiled faintly. He looked at the formula on the pill formula and moved his arm.

He pulled gently with both of his hands and pulled a water curtain in front of him. With a wave of his arm, he threw the spiritual herbs beside him onto the water curtain.

The pills were placed on the water curtain and melted at a terrifying speed.

Wang Xian focused his mind. With a thought, he started to melt the pills according to the formula.

When the ratio was completed, Wang Xian grabbed with his arm and a pill was formed.

He did not stop and continued to condense the remaining pills.

Soon, eight pills appeared in Wang Xian’s hand. He looked at the perfect pills in his hand and a satisfied expression appeared on his face.

“Not bad!”

He had not refined pills for a long time, but his skills had not fallen behind. Under the water of origin, the water refinement technique was very perfect.

“This... this...”

At the side, Long Luo was completely stunned.

What did she see?

She waved her arms and pulled with both hands.

Five seconds later, an elixir was formed?

“Let me see, let me see!”

Long Luo was in disbelief. She quickly took the elixir from Wang Xian’s hands.

She widened her eyes and sized it up. Her small mouth opened slightly.

“How is this possible? How is it possible for you to refine pills so quickly? This... this... you really know how to refine pills!”

Long Luo could not believe it. She had been carefully refining pills for half an hour but still could not complete it. In the end, it was completed by him in a few seconds.

Even her master, an alchemist who could refine transcendent grade-8 pills, did not have such a fast speed.

Even if her master was at full speed, he would still need five to six minutes.

Moreover, her master did not dare to guarantee that he would be 100% successful in refining an extraordinary grade-4 elixir!

This was simply too fast, and there were no flaws at all.

Could it be that he was even more powerful than her master?

Long Luo widened her eyes and stared at Wang Xian.

“This... brother Wang Xian, do you really know how to refine elixirs?”

“Are you a Master Alchemist?”

Long Xiaotian, who was standing at the side, was also looking at Wang Xian in shock.

He had seen his younger sister refine pills. She was very careful and was afraid of exploding pills. Even if she were to refine pills of extraordinary first level, it would take her more than ten minutes.

Unlike Wang Xian, who was so relaxed, he completed two sets of pills in just a few seconds.

While Long Xiaotian was talking, the white-robed middle-aged man, Bai Qingshan, walked over. When he heard his words, he was also slightly stunned.

“Master Alchemist? I should have no problem refining a half-step void interpretation elixir now. I can give it a try for those at the first level of void interpretation!”

Wang Xian thought for a moment and said.

“Hiss, you can refine a half-step void interpretation elixir?”

Long Xiaotian’s eyes flickered as he stared at Wang Xian and asked hurriedly.

Wang Xian nodded. “I haven’t refined elixirs for a long time. However, there shouldn’t be too much of a problem!”

“This...”

Long Xiaotian took a deep breath and a look of joy appeared on his face. “I didn’t expect brother Wang Xian to be an alchemy master. I can hand over my spiritual herbs to you to refine them!”

“Alright, let’s charge the fees as I said. How about it?”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“Of course. If I were to look for other alchemy masters to refine pills, the fees would be much higher than brother Wang Xian’s. Haha, Brother Wang Xian is really my lucky star. I didn’t expect you to even know how to refine pills. You’re really a peerless genius!”

Long Xiaotian sighed.

Wang Xian smiled and shook his head.

“Prince, there are some matters in wind salt town that I need to settle!”

Bai Qingshan looked at Wang Xian in surprise and whispered to Long Xiaotian.

“Alright, let’s go over first. Brother Wang Xian, wait here for a moment!”

Long Xiaotian said politely to Wang Xian and followed Bai Qingshan out.

“Prince, is that young master Wang Xian really an alchemy master?”

As soon as he walked out of the room, Bai Qingshan asked Long Xiaotian solemnly.

“It shouldn’t be wrong. Just now, he used two sets of ingredients for two extraordinary tier-4 pills and refined eight extraordinary tier-4 pills in just a few seconds. The speed was so fast that it was terrifying.”

Long Xiaotian nodded his head seriously.

“He is both a Beast Tamer and a powerful alchemy master. Even if this Wang Xian doesn’t come from a powerful family, he is still an exceptional genius. Prince, you must befriend him well!”

Bai Qingshan reminded him seriously.

“I naturally know about this. To have such strength and talent at such a young age, there are not many people in the entire Liuhai region who can match up to him!”

Long Xiaotian nodded his head. When he thought of Wang Xian’s talent, even he felt inferior to him.

He knew that his strength was already very outstanding in the Liuhai region. However, compared to Wang Xian, he was still lacking by a lot.

“Brother Wang, is the water-refining technique better than the fire-refining technique? How can you refine pills so quickly? If you can refine pills that are half a step into the void interpretation realm, doesn’t that mean that you are a master-level alchemist?”

In the room, Long Luo raised her head and looked at Wang Xian with admiration in her eyes. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Refining pills is very simple. The Art of fire refining is the same as the art of water refining!”

Wang Xian looked at him and said plainly.

“Simple? It’s not simple at all. I’ve been learning alchemy for five to six years. My Brother said that I’m a prodigal. Not only did I not earn any money, but I also lost a lot of money!”

Long Luo pouted and said unhappily when she heard his words.

“Then it’s probably because your talent is too poor!”

Wang Xian smiled and said.

“You...”

Long Luo glared at him. Poor Talent? Her master had praised her as a rare alchemy genius who had the chance to become an alchemy master!
