Chapter 1586: One thousand five hundred and eighty-six corpses and five thousand miles of blood

“Damn cowards. If I was at my peak, I could crush you all with one hand!”

The stooped old man looked furious when he saw the two ancestors of the Bingxin Empire escaping.

The Soul of darkness in his body had not been cleared by Wang Xian. He was only suppressed. His strength had not reached its peak yet.

With the strength that he had just recovered a little, he could easily pin down two experts at the eighth level of the Seethrough realm. However, it was still a little difficult to keep them alive.

“Bingxin Empire, I will destroy your country and your people. I will make your blood flow for tens of thousands of miles. I will destroy all your cities and destroy all the members of the Royal Ice Clan!”

“Destroy your country and your clan. I will come and look for you very soon. Wait for my arrival. Roar Roar!”

Wang Xian’s tyrannical dragon eyes stared at the long-haired elder and Bing Fa Wu who were fleeing. A ghastly voice was transmitted over.

The two figures, who had already fled ten kilometers away, trembled in the air.

Their expressions were extremely ugly. There was a hint of fear in their eyes.

They had never expected that they would be faced with the calamity of having their country annihilated just because they had taken the initiative to marry Ling Jian ‘er to the young master ao Tian in order to curry favor with the solipsistic sect.

They even wanted to exterminate all the members of the Imperial Ice clan.

As the ice empire that had stood tall in the vast region for tens of thousands of years, the members of the ice clan alone numbered in the tens of millions. Most of them were gathered in the ice heart imperial city.

With the ferocity and tyranny of the Sky Demon, he would definitely do as he said.

“Why is pastor Wang The Sky Demon? Why!”

They could not help but roar in their hearts. Their faces were filled with bitter smiles, and thick regret surged into their hearts.

Because of a woman, because of them, they had directly plunged the Bingxin dynasty into danger.

“Let’s go back immediately. Master eight is in the imperial city. I refuse to believe that with the strength of the three of us, and with the foundation of our Bingxin dynasty, we can’t resist a Sky Devil!”

Both of them revealed an extremely embarrassed expression. With a gloomy expression, they fled quickly towards the imperial city of the Bingxin Empire.

Wang Xian didn’t chase after them because they couldn’t escape.

If they dared to run, he would dare to exterminate everyone in the Bingxin Empire.

Boom

He swayed his huge body and looked towards the direction in front of him.

The Abyss Demon Dragon was wreaking havoc on everything in the area of the lone sect.

Everything within a radius of dozens of kilometers had turned into ruins.

On the ground, there were tens of thousands of corpses. The most eye-catching thing was that in the center, there was a formation that was emitting green light.

The formation was like a green castle. There was no light circulating, as if it was material.

Even though the Abyss Demon Dragon had struck it more than ten times, it did not break.

Inside the formation, more than thirty middle-aged young men and old men were looking outside with pale faces.

When they saw Wang Xian’s dragon eyes looking over, their hearts trembled.

Wang Xian’s body swayed and he came to the top of the formation. His pair of emotionless dragon eyes were staring inside.

“Sky Demon, if you dare to kill us, my lone sect will kill you even if we have to chase you to the ends of the Earth!”

In the middle of the formation, an old man shouted loudly.

“Bang!”

Wang Xian’s dragon claws landed heavily on the formation, enveloping the entire formation.

Waves of dense dark energy corroded the formation.

The continuous darkness caused the green formation to turn black slowly.

“Let us go, let us go!”

Upon seeing this scene, the people from the lone sect in the formation were completely flustered as they shouted in horror.

Crack! Crack

The formation cracked slowly, causing the people inside to feel even more despair.

“I, Wang Xian, am here today to warn all of you from the lone sect!”

Wang Xian opened his dragon mouth and his voice spread across a radius of more than 10,000 kilometers.

“If Jian ‘er is missing a single hair, I will fight to the death with all of you, the only sect. Everything here is a warning to all of you!”

“If you don’t send Jian ‘er over, I will kill every single disciple of the only sect I see until I die or all of You Die!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Wang Xian’s tone was filled with endless killing intent as he roared. His gaze slowly landed on the area below the Dragon Claw.

It was an elder of the seventh level of the Seethrough Void sect of the solicitous sect, as well as a group of elite disciples.

Even the two heaven’s favorites from Heaven and earth were also located within the formation.

They looked at Wang Xian with trembling eyes.

Their arrogant and confident expressions that were above everything vanished completely.

In front of Wang Xian, they were like ants.

Wang Xian’s gigantic dragon claw pointed straight ahead.

A stream of resplendent black light descended from the Dragon Claw.

“No, no, I don’t want to die yet. I don’t want to Die!”

“Don’t kill me, don’t kill me!”

In front of Wang Xian, the two Peerless Heaven’s favorites in Heaven and earth had completely lost their hatred for Wang Xian.

They only hoped that Wang Xian would spare their lives.

As the dragon claws descended, corpses were instantly left on the ground.

The Heaven’s favorites from the heavens and the Earth of the Solitaire sect died immediately.

They were unexcelled in their glory. The two heaven’s favorites who had declared their dominance over the entire vast region were crushed to death like ants.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

At this moment, waves of terrifying demonic flames came from the sky.

In the sky, the Abyss Demonic Dragon opened its huge mouth. Rolling Dark Flames fell towards the ground.

Everything was burned and corroded by the darkness.

There was nothing in the entire solipsistic sect’s base in the ruins of the divine kingdom.

“Go and destroy the territory of the Bingxin Empire in the ruins of the Divine Kingdom!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the surroundings. Finally, he looked at the hunchbacked old man and said to him.

“It’s boss demon. I’m the best at killing and setting fires. Keke!”

The hunchbacked old man moved and flew directly towards the direction of the Bingxin Empire.

“This... This Sky Devil actually threatened our sect and killed everyone here!”

“As expected of the Sky Devil. He isn’t afraid of our sect at all and isn’t afraid of their revenge. This kind of devil, whoever dares to provoke him will be courting death!”

“The Bingxin Empire was originally on good terms with priest Wang. Why did he suddenly become so angry and vow to exterminate him or even his entire clan?”

Shocked voices sounded out from the surroundings. Everyone looked at the ruined solipsism and gulped.

This was one of the three superpowers, the solipsism!

Many people were curious about the reason why priest Wang was so angry.

He didn’t care about the solipsism and swore to destroy the Iceheart dynasty.

Soon, everything that happened here and the cause of it were spread to the various superpowers.

When they received this news, everyone was stunned.

This caused them to mock the Bingxin dynasty.

Priest Wang has been kind to you, yet you are ungrateful!

In the end, they never expected that priest Wang was the legendary Sky Demon.

This time, the Bingxin dynasty was completely destroyed!

Looking at the figure in the ruins ahead, the eyes of the experts from the various factions flashed.
