Chapter 2941: demons and monsters

“It’s over, it’s over, it’s all over. Our home is gone, our starry skies are gone, our VELURIYAM domain is gone!”

Countless people from the VELURIYAM domain gathered at the border.

The entire VELURIYAM domain was homeless, what kind of concept was that?

A sorrowful atmosphere filled the entire starry skies.

!!

“How did the demonic beasts of the chimei domain suddenly become so strong, how could there be so many experts? Back then, we went to the chimei domain to train, but now…”

“What should we do now? If Yaoxie continues to attack, we can only flee to the saint-level!”

“Not to mention where we live, if the chimei domain can invade us, is the saint-level 100% safe?”

“How could this be? How Could Yaoxie and the others be so powerful? Could it be that our veluriyam domain is going to be destroyed?”

On the planet and in the god country, everyone was discussing in panic. The citizens of the veluriyam domain were filled with panic.

Disaster, a huge disaster!

If it wasn’t for the domain Lord and the others finding out about the disaster beforehand, they wouldn’t be able to imagine what the consequences would be.

Perhaps, the number of people fleeing here would be reduced by half. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Because that half had already been swallowed by Yao Xie.

Even so, many people’s hearts were filled with despair.

The four leaders of demons and demons, close to a hundred evil god emperors, and countless other levels of Yao Xie were simply not something their glazed domain could resist.

Panic, unease, and fear!

Everyone could only wait anxiously.

“Domain Lord, you’re back!”

“Domain Lord, you’ve actually suffered such serious injuries!”

At the same time, an old man flew over from a tower on a planet in the middle of the border.

On the tower, more than 30 God emperors hurriedly went up to welcome him. When they sensed the domain Lord’s aura, everyone’s expressions changed slightly.

“Pu!”

The domain Lord landed on the tower. When he saw them walking over, he could not help but spit out a mouthful of blood.

“Domain Lord!”

At this moment, the expressions of the god Emperors changed drastically. Grand Supreme First Elder and the others hurriedly walked over to support the domain Lord.

“Domain Lord, you should go and investigate the news. What… What Happened? What exactly happened?”

A God emperor saw that the domain lord was so weak. His expression changed drastically as he asked with concern.

“I really did not expect that demonic charm to be so cunning. I did not expect it to actually leave a trace of energy in my body during the previous battle.”

“When I went to investigate, I was ambushed by it!”

The domain Lord was helped to a chair, and he lay down on it with his eyes closed.

In the past few months, the domain Lord had single-handedly defended against the four great leaders of demons and monsters, and he had experienced three battles.

He had relied on his true treasures to delay the time for the glazed domain soldiers to escape.

However, in the three great battles, he had been injured.

However, relying on the foundation of the glazed area, treasures, injuries recover very quickly, and no threat.

But this time, he fell in the hands of one of the four evil leaders.

Strange powers of concealment, powerful assassination techniques.

He took a beating.

“I’m afraid I won’t be able to get back to the top!”

Domain Lord suddenly spat out a few words!

“What! ?”

Hearing the governor’s words, everyone in the VELURIYAM domain had a drastic change in expression. Their hearts trembled violently.

“Grandfather, your injuries are so… So Serious!”

A god Emperor grabbed the governor’s arm and asked with a trembling body.

“Sigh, I was careless. The four leaders of the demons and monsters are existences that have returned from other star domains. They must have experienced countless battles, big and small, and are skilled in all kinds of tricks. I’ve underestimated them.”

“Even if I recover now, I can at most recover to the battle strength of a first level divine emperor. It’s difficult to return to the peak!”

The domain Lord Sighed and sat up with a helpless expression. He looked around.

“First level divine emperor!”

When everyone heard the domain Lord’s words, their expressions changed again.

“It’s alright, Domain Lord. I’ll do the investigation next. I’ll be more careful. There shouldn’t be any problems!”

The first Supreme Elder’s expression changed slightly as he immediately said.

“No. The four great demonic leaders all have special abilities. Among them, the demonic beasts are the hardest to deal with. If he hides, you won’t be able to sense him at all. He can instantly kill you!”

The domain Lord immediately shook his head and said.

“Then… If the four great demonic leaders charge over and we don’t receive any warning, wouldn’t we…”

A God emperor’s expression changed drastically when he heard the domain Lord’s expression. His face was filled with worry as he spoke.

Now, all of their god Emperors had summoned their divine kingdoms over. Once the four great leaders charged over and they were not alerted, they would be finished.

With the four great leaders’strength, none of them could escape.

Thinking of this, the few divine emperors trembled slightly. Their eyes were filled with panic.

“Everyone from the glazed domain, why don’t all of you evacuate to our sacred domain first? We can leave some people here to be on guard.”

“We’ll set up more teleportation arrays along the border.”

“If that group of demonic beasts continues to invade, this will be a disaster for our resplendent starry sky. When the time comes, we’ll summon all our strength and launch a counterattack.”

A divine emperor from the sacred region said with a frown.

“Give up on the glazed domain?”

The expressions of the surrounding divine emperors from the glazed domain changed slightly when they heard his words. They were filled with unwillingness.

However, the domain Lord was severely injured at this moment. No one could contend against the Demonic Beast Army. What could they do if they did not give up?

“Can we contact the Dragon Palace Dragon King?”

The domain Lord’s expression changed slightly as he asked.

“Domain Lord, we still can’t contact anyone from the Dragon Palace.”

“Domain lord, it’s been half a year. could something have happened to the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace? After such a long time, we should be able to determine the victor!”

A god Emperor said.

“It’s really possible. After all, the machine emperor domain is the territory of the automaton race. They’ve built their territory for more than a billion years. With the wisdom of the creator, they’ll definitely build their headquarters into an impregnable fortress.”

“Moreover, the automaton race has collected the resources of the machine imperial territory for more than a billion years. If the Dragon Palace were to invade rashly, they might really encounter a crisis.”

“How can a force that has been around for more than a billion years be so easily destroyed?”

A God emperor beside him said.

His words caused the expressions of the god Emperors to change.

Could the Dragon Palace really be destroyed by the machine imperial territory?

The more they thought about it, the more likely it was that they wouldn’t be able to contact the Dragon Palace for half a month.

After all, the Dragon Palace was their territory, and the robots had the geographical advantage.

In addition, the creator had been managing his nest for more than a billion years…

With the Creator’s wisdom…

“The Dragon King and the others should be fine!”

Hong Fengyan pursed her lips and said in disbelief.

“Red Wind Divine Emperor, can you contact the Dragon King and the others?”

Hearing her words, Shangshui divine emperor couldn’t help but ask.

Red Wind Divine Emperor shook his head.

Everyone’s heart sank slightly when they saw this.
