Chapter 1481: 1481 stunned

“He won’t?”

Yuan Xun er was stunned. Her expression slowly turned ugly.

He won’t?

She had witnessed with her own eyes how this young man used his hand as a knife to quickly carve an exquisite sculpture. Now, he actually said he wouldn’t.

What did this mean?

“Young master, if you don’t want to carve, then so be it. Do you have to say you won’t?”

Yuan Xun er said to Wang Xian with a sullen face and some anger.

“I don’t want to!”

Wang Xian heard her words and said faintly.

“You...”

When Yuan Xun er heard these three words from him, her face instantly darkened.

“HMPH!”

She snorted softly and turned around to leave with a flushed face.

This was the most unreasonable young man she had ever seen. She even wondered if the other party was blind.

“HMPH, birds of a feather flock together!”

Lu Lianjin’s face was filled with disdain when he saw Wang Xian angering Yuan Xun Er. He looked at Dumu Dazhuang who was at the side and said disdainfully. He immediately followed him inside.

“Hehe, this brother really has a personality!”

When Dumu saw Yuan Xun er leave in anger, a hint of a smile appeared in his eyes. He waved the feather fan in his hand and stared at Wang Xian with a twinkle in his eyes. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The five young men standing beside him also raised their eyebrows and stood behind Dumu.

When Dumu Dazhuang saw his big brother’s expression, his expression changed slightly.

“Big Brother, I saw that Miss Xun er wanted to talk to this brother of mine, so I deliberately let him talk like this. Isn’t this to not disturb you, Big Brother?”

He spoke to Dumu Dazhuang embarrassedly.

“Scram, disgusting thing, did I talk to you? !”

Dumu Dazhuang heard his words and spoke without any mercy.

This made Dumu Dazhuang Smile embarrassedly and didn’t continue to speak.

Obviously, this wasn’t the first time he had seen such an attitude.

“Brother, let’s discuss something!”

Dumu Dazhuang looked at Wang Xian and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

“Speak!”

Wang Xian looked at him indifferently and said expressionlessly.

“You, carve a statue for me immediately. It’s the statue of the beauty from earlier. Also, apologize to her!”

Young Master Dumu stared at Wang Xian with a smile and said faintly.

“Is there something wrong with your Big Brother’s brain?”

Wang Xian heard his words and looked at Dumu Dazhuang who was at the side.

Dumu Dazhuang’s expression changed slightly when he heard what Wang Xian said.

“Hahaha, brother Wang Xian said that there’s something wrong with my brain. Indeed...”

“Tell me again!”

Dumu Dazhuang laughed and said loudly. However, when Dumu Dazhuang heard what Wang Xian said, his expression immediately turned dark and cold.

They stared at Wang Xian coldly.

Behind him, the faces of the five young men also turned cold. Long swords appeared in their hands one after another.

“Get lost! Don’t challenge my patience!”

Wang Xian swept his cold gaze across the six of them. There was no emotion on his face.

“F * ck! Who Do you think you are? Let me tell you. Do as our young master says. Otherwise, you will be in big trouble today!”

A young man standing behind Young Master Dumu pointed his long sword at Wang Xian and shouted sternly.

Crack! Crack! Crack

However, just as the longsword in his hand was raised and aimed at Wang Xian, the longsword in his hand started to crack slowly and fell to the ground piece by piece!

“Huh?”

The young man was slightly stunned and his face was filled with astonishment.

“Who is making a move here!”

At this moment, a cold voice was suddenly heard. An old man dressed in green clothes appeared beside them.

The old man stared at the long sword in the young man’s hand. He raised his eyebrows slightly and scanned the surroundings.

“Sir!”

When Young Master Dumu and the rest of the young men saw the old man’s figure, their expressions changed drastically. They hurriedly shouted in fear.

The old man ignored them and looked at Wang Xian.

“No one is allowed to make a move inside the airship!”

“I know!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

He knew that the entire airship was enveloped by a formation. When he mobilized any energy here, it would be under the surveillance of the formation.

This formation was controlled by humans. Wang Xian’s non-formation ability could not evade it.

Therefore, the moment he mobilized the energy, he was discovered by the old man in front of him.

The old man’s strength was at level four void interpretation. He was not weak, but he was still far from Wang Xian.

“Not bad, Young Man!”

The old man nodded at him and praised him.

Judging from the energy he mobilized just now, he was at least at the peak of level one of the Seethrough realm. He was very impressed by Wang Xian’s cultivation at such a young age.

“If you guys want to die, I will throw you all down and return to your positions. Don’t move!”

Following that, the old man looked at young master Dui Mu and the others and said coldly.

“Da...”

Young Master Dui Mu was slightly stunned and said with an embarrassed expression.

However, when he saw the old man’s cold expression, he hurriedly swallowed his words. He nodded his head in fear and walked into the airship.

At the same time, his eyes flickered and he swallowed a mouthful of saliva in fear. He thought of the old man’s attitude towards him and the young man just now.

When he thought of the sharp sword just now, cold sweat appeared on his forehead.

“That young man’s strength is definitely very strong. It’s possible...”

His heart sank as he guessed with an embarrassed expression.

“My treasured sword, this is a transcendent level nine sharp sword. Just now, it actually directly...”

At this moment, the young man’s distressed voice came from behind, causing Young Master Dumu to take a deep breath.

“Damn it!”

He clenched his fists and cursed under his breath. With a dark expression, he returned to his seat and didn’t dare to leave.

“F * CK, F * ck, brother Wang Xian, brother Wang Xian, the Lord just now actually said that you’re not bad!”

“He directly berated Dumu Tianyuan that B * Stard. And that sword... brother, are you a heaven’s pride expert? Are You a heaven’s pride expert at the Profound Void Realm?”

Dui Dazhuang, who was at the side, saw his brother leaving with an extremely embarrassed expression. After seeing the old man leave, he let out a series of exclamations.

“Is that your real big brother?”

Wang Xian didn’t answer him. Instead, he asked him.

“HMM? Yes, we have the same father. Hehe, Big Brother Wang Xian, are you curious about our relationship?”

“My mother is a maid. It’s a very cliché story. She had sex with my father and gave birth to me!”

“Although I’m from the Dugu family, I’m not well-liked. I barely have a name. Brother, you’ve seen it too. Those guys don’t even give me face!”

Dumu Dazhuang chuckled.

“Then you’re not angry?”

Wang Xian looked at him curiously.

“I’m angry. I was angry at first too. But after hearing what my mother said, I’m not angry at all!”

“My mother was from an ordinary family. Because of her good carving skills, she worked in the Dugu family. If not for that melodramatic story, my mother would have married a very ordinary man!”

“If my mother had married an ordinary man, then I would have been a kid from an ordinary family. There was even a possibility that I wouldn’t have existed!”

“So, this is a good thing for me. Although that Bullsh * t Big Brother of mine and some young disciples look down on me, I am still a famous person with a background in Nanling City!”

“There’s no need to run around because of some other things. I’m already very satisfied with putting my life on the line!”

Dui Dazhuang said very optimistically.
