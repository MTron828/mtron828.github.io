Chapter 1597: 1597 dominance and Madness 1

Fresh blood, red, festive.

In the festive room, young master ao Tian said to Ling Jian ‘ER with a smile on his face.

When he heard that priest Wang was a sky demon, he was shocked for a very long time.

He never expected that after he left, all the people of their sect in the divine kingdom ruins would be killed.

Even the Grand Elder was killed by the Sky Demon.

A terrifying powerhouse who was not even thirty years old, a powerhouse who could destroy the entire dynasty by himself, even he felt his scalp go numb.

Fortunately, he had the lone sect as his backer, and he had his father.

“Young lord ao Tian, I hope that the lone sect can hand over the sky demon’s corpse to us. We want to use his corpse to pay tribute to the millions of spirits of our ice race in the sky!”

Beside him, Bing Fa Wu clenched his fists tightly as he growled in a low voice. His eyes were filled with deep hatred.

In fact, his eyes were filled with endless hatred when he looked at Bing Jian ‘er.

However, now that Bing Jian ‘er was going to marry young master ao Tian, he hid this hatred very well.

“No problem.”

Young Master Ao Tian smiled at Bing Fa Wu and Bing Jing Huan. “Not only Sky Demon, all his friends and even the entire Liuhai region will be buried with him. Hehe.”

Bing FA Wu was stunned for a moment before a cruel smile appeared on her face.

Ling Jian ‘er, who was sitting in front of the dressing table, was filled with anger.

However, her body was being controlled and she could not speak.

“Time is about to start. Senior Bing Fa Wu, Little Brother Bing Jing Huan, let’s go out and welcome the guests!”

Ao Tian said to them as he walked out with a smile.

Bing FA Wu and Bing Jing Huan nodded and followed behind him.

One of them was the groom while the other was the relative of the bride. Naturally, they had to greet the guests.

“Congratulations, Young Master Ao Tian!”

“Congratulations, Young Master Ao Tian! Congratulations!”

Ao Tian and the other two arrived in front of Ying Tian Peak. At this moment, there were more than 100,000 people gathered in the huge square.

All the powerful forces in the entire vast region had arrived.

The southern royal family, the Wuji Empire, and the eight first-rate forces were all present. All of them were rushing over.

Seeing Young Master Ao Tian walking out, all the experts from the forces immediately greeted him with smiles on their faces.

“Hehe!”

Young Master Ao Tian smiled and nodded to each of the forces.

“Young Master Ao Tian, our nine Lotus sect has received news that the sky demon seems to be rushing over!”

An expert from a first-rate force walked over and said in a soft voice.

“Hehe, thank you for your reminder, nine Lotus sect!”

Young Master Ao Tian smiled faintly.

“No need, no need!”

The people from the nine Lotus sect immediately smiled and shook their heads.

“Congratulations to the two from the Bingxin Empire!”

At this moment, a mocking voice suddenly sounded.

Bing FA Wu and Bing Jing Huan, who were greeting the various forces behind Young Master Ao Tian, instantly became embarrassed.

They looked forward and saw Wu Qing Cheng looking at them with a mocking expression.

“Wu Qing Cheng, just congratulate me!”

Ao Tian looked forward and said with a smile. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Hehe, marrying a daughter-in-law is such a huge loss. There is nothing to congratulate!”

Wu Qing Cheng did not give ao Tian much face and said lightly.

“Wu Qing Cheng, I know that the Sky Demon has done you a favor, but so what? I will let you see his body soon and mourn for him!”

Ao Tian’s face turned cold when he heard Wu Qing Cheng’s words.

“Humph!”

Wu Qing Cheng’s face also turned ugly as he watched ao Tian walk forward.

“Qing Cheng, only our sect and priest Wang are fighting to the death. We Can’t help you with this matter, or it will cause a war between the two forces!”

An elder at the side said slowly to Wu Qing Cheng.

“I know!”

Wu Qing Cheng nodded with a gloomy face. “Now, I hope priest Wang doesn’t act rashly, or else...”

He scanned his surroundings with an embarrassed expression.

In the incomparably huge Yingtian Peak, all the forces in the vast region had arrived.

All the disciples and experts of the Solitaire sect were scattered around the surrounding areas.

The experts were spying on them. Even the Patriarch of the Solitaire sect and the Patriarch of the Solitaire sect were also watching them.

In such a situation, once Wang Xian arrived, there was a slim chance of survival. It could even be said that there was no way for him to survive.

Even if it was the Wuji Empire, unless they used all their strength, they would not be able to gain any benefits here.

“Let’s Hope so!”

The elder from the Wuji Empire nodded slowly.

The matter of the Saint Prince of light being a sky demon had also shocked the entire Wuji Empire.

If it wasn’t for the fact that he and the solipsistic sect had caused such a huge ruckus, they would have wanted to befriend him. However, there was nothing they could do about it!

“Little Yuan, do you think young master Wang will come today?”

At the He clan’s seat, he suiqing frowned as he looked around and asked he yuan.

“I think so!”

He Yuan smiled bitterly.

Based on his understanding of Wang Xian, this brother of his would definitely come today.

“This... if he comes here, then...”

He suiqing pursed his lips and scanned his surroundings.

He Yuan didn’t say anything. He sighed silently. He hoped that Wang Xian wouldn’t come.

It wasn’t just the Wuji Empire and the He clan. Everything that happened today wasn’t about the wedding between the young master of Ao Tian and Ling Jian ‘er.

Instead, it was about the announcement of the sect and whether or not the sky demon would come!

“With the Sky Demon’s strength, if he came today, he would be instantly killed!”

“If he came, he would never come back. The sect did not take the Sky Demon’s threat seriously at all. Instead, they held the wedding here and insulted the Sky Demon. It was as if they were saying, ‘look, we want your woman!’”

“She’s a peerless beauty with monstrous demonic qi. How could we offend our sect? Unless the sky demon doesn’t come out this time and hides for hundreds or even thousands of years, waiting for an opportunity to take revenge!”

The surrounding forces were discussing in low voices.

“The two from the Bingxin dynasty, come here. We have something to ask you!”

At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded in the huge square.

The voice did not have the slightest scruple and carried a trace of dominance.

All the factions of Ying Tian Peak were slightly stunned. They hurriedly looked towards the source of the voice.

Even all the experts from the unique sect narrowed their eyes slightly and looked over coldly.

However, when they saw the person who spoke, everyone was slightly startled.

“Hiss, why is this person here?”

“Why is this person from the southern Royal Family Here?”

The eyes of all the factions narrowed slightly, and a trace of solemnity appeared on their faces.

Bing FA Wu and Bing Jing Huan, who were following beside young master ao Tian, were slightly shocked and quickly walked over.

Even Young Master Ao Tian followed by the side in surprise and immediately walked over.

There was an old man with long black hair that reached his waist. His hair was neat, and there was a trace of brutality in his frown.

The top powerhouse of the southern royal family, Nangong Jianghe!
