Chapter 2968: In the Battle of 2968, Chimei territory vs the Dragon Palace

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

In the void of Chimei territory, a soaring battle intent suddenly rose, and the roars of the members of the Dragon Palace shook the heaven and earth.

All the members stared at the five demon caves in front of them, full of killing intent.

The demon caves quickly flew over and were located at the entrance of the demon caves. The six leaders of the demonic beasts immediately noticed the members of the Dragon Palace.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Ga Ga Ga!”

Hearing the roars of the members of the Dragon Palace, the six demonic leaders immediately raised their heads. Their eyes were filled with brutal killing intent as they replied angrily.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Ga Ga Ga Ga!”

In the next moment, all the demonic leaders around them let out violent roars. Their bodies tensed up and their blood-red eyes stared at all the members of the Dragon Palace.

Their blood-red eyes that were shining in the demon cave looked abnormally terrifying.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

At this moment, six level five god-emperor evil demon leaders flew out of the demon cave and looked at each other.

Sensing the power of the entire Dragon Palace, the leaders drooled.

Excitement slowly appeared in their eyes.

Yao Xie could also evolve quickly after devouring a large number of flesh and blood experts.

The members of the Dragon Palace in front of them didn’t sense any existence that could threaten them.

Without any threat, they could slaughter and devour wantonly.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

A Yao Xie in the middle couldn’t help but let out a wild roar.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

Countless Yao Xie flew out from the demon cave behind him and rushed toward the Dragon Palace.

“Ga Ga Ga!”

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The leaders of the other four demon caves roared and gave the order to attack.

All the remaining demons started to move.

Countless demons rushed toward the 1.8 million members of the Dragon Palace.

“Guys, get ready to fight!”

At the front, the leaders of the Dragon Palace saw demons rushing toward them, and their eyes were full of excitement as they roared.

“Shoot!”

Mou Zesen, the Arrow Dragon in the last demon cave, ordered loudly when he saw Yaoxie enter the shooting range.

“Release sound waves to assist!”

The current leader of the Dolphin clan shouted and said to the ten thousand girls and men of the Dolphin clan.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

Waves of special sound waves rushed forward.

The power of the sound waves made the blood of all the warriors of the Dragon Palace Boil, and their eyes were full of fighting spirit and calmness.

Splash

At this moment, the leader of the Dolphin clan waved his arm, and drops of crystal-clear liquid that contained rich vitality floated in the air in front of him.

This was not an ordinary liquid, but the vitality liquid in the Moon Bay of the ancient lake.

After the ancestral tree leveled up, the vitality liquid was born very quickly, and there were still thousands of liters of vitality liquid in the dragon palace.

As a precious treasure to recover from injuries, a drop of vitality liquid could directly heal minor injuries. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The dolphin clan controlled the vitality liquid and was at the back, so they could provide support at any time.

“Hehehe, the war has begun. Let’s show them the abilities of our poisonous horned dragon species!”

The members of the Dragon Palace saw hundreds of billions of demonic beasts rushing toward them. The eight-limbed demon fiend duo looked excited and roared loudly.

They took the lead and flew toward the countless demonic beasts, locking onto their targets.

In the sky, the arrows of the arrow dragon species whistled over.

“Devouring Dragon, Kill!”

“Kill!”

The other leaders immediately gave the order to attack and shouted loudly.

Boom! Boom! Boom

All the members of the Dragon Palace started to move and charged toward the demonic beasts with a violent aura.

The terrifying dragon aura caused the entire army of Yao Xie to pause.

“Hahaha, let’s start the Show!”

The first poisonous horned dragon that charged out was only tens of millions of kilometers away from Yao Xie.

“Roar!”Ba Qi shouted as his body turned into a black line and charged towards Yao Xie.

“Roar!”

Countless Yao Xie looked at the members of the Dragon Palace in front of them. They opened their mouths and unleashed terrifying attacks. Countless energies mixed together and formed terrifying energy tides.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

The tens of thousands of poisonous horned dragons evaded the attacks one by one. In the next moment, they entered the bodies of the demonic beasts.

Puff! Puff! Puff

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Soon, when the poisonous horned dragons entered the bodies of the demonic beasts, their bodies paused for a few seconds before they immediately attacked the demonic beasts around them.

In an instant, a huge mess was created in a few places.

“Roar!”

“Ga Ga Ga!”

In the void behind them, the six demonic leaders glanced at the poisonous horned dragons, and their eyes were cold.

They moved and rushed toward the army of the Dragon Palace.

“Lock onto the six demonic leaders and block them!”

Prime Minister Gui immediately ordered from the back.

Mou Zesen turned his arrow and attacked one of the demonic leaders.

The eyes of the leaders of the Dragon Palace focused. Ten of them came together and welcomed the six leaders of the evil demons.

Wang Xian flapped his wings slightly, and a powerful light shot out from his eyes.

“Kill one in an instant.”

Wang Xian waved his arm and held the five elements millstone in his hand. Waves of rich five elements power were injected into the five elements millstone.

The entire millstone contained destructive energy.

He locked onto a demonic beast that was relatively far away from the other leaders of the demonic beasts. Then, he moved his body.

“Extreme Speed!”

He let out a low growl and pushed his speed to the limit.

The two divine dragons that were surrounded by the Tai Chi Dragon Disc slowly merged together and spun around him rapidly.

“Whoosh!”

This was the first time Wang Xian displayed his fastest speed since his breakthrough.

It was comparable to the speed of a level six celestial thearch.

Boom

The next moment, Wang Xian’s figure appeared beside the leader of the demonic beasts on the left.

Roar

The leader of the demonic beasts was shocked when it saw Wang Xian flying in front of it. It immediately let out a low roar and raised its head to spray a stream of flames at Wang Xian.

Buzz

Wang Xian flapped his uninitiated holy wings and easily dodged the leader’s attack. He appeared 10,000 meters in front of him.

Buzz

Within 10,000 meters, Wang Xian brandished the five elements millstone. The destructive force was directed towards the godzilla-like leader of the demonic beasts.

Puff

The Five Elements Millstone instantly entered the body of the leader of the demonic beasts. The destructive aura of the five elements spread throughout its entire body.

Buzz

Wang Xian waved his arm and the five elements Millstone flew out of the body of the leader of the demonic beasts.

The five-meter-long body of the celestial thearch level five demonic beasts lost its vitality rapidly and fell to the side.

Instant Kill!

When Wang Xian saw this scene, a smile appeared on his face.

Although it was expected, it still made him very happy.

“Next, let’s Fight!”

“Roar, Roar, Roar!”

Wang Xian let out a wild roar and transformed into an eight-colored divine dragon. He directly attacked the other celestial thearch level five demonic beasts.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

When the other five demonic leaders saw an existence on the same level as them being killed, they were shocked. Then, they stared at Wang Xian and let out a roar.
