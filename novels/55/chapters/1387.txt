Chapter 1388: 1388

“Dragon and Phoenix Dynasty!”

“Damn it, that damn guy, how dare he be so arrogant!”

In the huge king’s auction house, Young Master Liu and Yao Dingfeng walked forward with embarrassed expressions.

Young Master Liu’s face was especially gloomy.

A lowly demonic beast dared to be arrogant in front of him, and he even had the support of that guy from the Dragon and Phoenix Dynasty.

He even wanted to exterminate their Liu clan!

This made him extremely furious!

“Young master Liu, young master Liu, don’t be angry. This matter is all the fault of my insensible sister!”

At this moment, elder sister and second brother, who were chasing after them, said in a fawning manner.

“Scram!”

Young master Liu heard their figures and roared in a low voice without turning his head.

This caused the expression of elder sister and second brother to stiffen, and they were filled with embarrassment.

“Young Master Liu, we apologize to you. When that girl Xiaoyan comes later, I’ll let her apologize to you!”

The two of them squeezed out a smile and followed behind.

“Hehe, your gilded gold clan’s taste is really...”

As Young Master Liu spoke, he suddenly stopped. He slightly narrowed his eyes, and a trace of coldness appeared in his eyes.

“Your third sister, Miss Gilded Gold Yan is quite good!”

He lowered his voice and said slowly with a profound meaning.

“Huh?”

The two of them were slightly stunned when they heard young master Liu’s words. Their faces revealed a stunned expression.

“Miss Gilded Yan is here!”

Young Master Liu Saw Gilded Yan who followed behind him and smiled faintly. He turned around and continued to walk towards his seat.

“Huh? Shaohua, what are you doing?”

Yao Dingfeng, who was at the side, also came over in slight surprise and asked in a low voice.

“It’s nothing. I just suddenly feel that I’m not young anymore. Just take a concubine!”

Young Master Liu said with a smile.

“Eh? You, Haha, Tall! Tall!”

Yao Dingfeng laughed and walked forward with his arm around young master Liu’s shoulder.

The group of people came to a pavilion where the young city lord of Xiaoyao city and some noble disciples were all present.

“Everyone from the Dragon and Phoenix Dynasty, your seats are over here!”

The entire King’s auction house was huge, and its interior was completely different from ordinary auction houses.

Inside, there were fake mountains and fake water, and small pavilions.

Many people could sit under the pavilions, and exquisite food was placed on top.

In the center, there was a high platform, and above the high platform was the auction seat.

The surrounding guests were seated around the platform.

The entire auction hall could seat around 10,000 people.

10,000 people was not a huge number. However, the level of extravagance was definitely the best in the Liuhai region.

“Everyone, this is your seat. There are staff beside you. If you need anything, feel free to ask!”

The staff brought Wang Xian and the rest to a spot that was closer to the center.

As the current rising overlord Dynasty, the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty was qualified to be in a position that was closer to the front desk.

Moreover, the value of the items auctioned by Wang Xian this time was also very terrifying.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded and sat in the main seat. He gestured for Ao Jian, Duan Jinming, and the rest to sit at the side.

Duan Jinming looked left and right. His gaze shifted to a spot not far away. His gaze landed on the golden words again and a smile appeared on his face.

It was his first time coming to such a luxurious place. It was his first time being served with respect.

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings. Each pavilion represented a powerful force.

“That’s right!”

Wang Xian looked at the seat in front of him and saw a group of dozens of young men and women sitting together. They were chatting with smiles on their faces.

These were the second generation of the richest people in the vicinity.

The princes and princesses of the dynasty, the heirs of the top forces, and so on.

“The 20th King’s auction will be held soon. This is also the 100th year that our king’s auction will be held!”

“For the items to be auctioned today, all the powerhouses and lords must be prepared!”

Not long after, a woman who still had her charm came to the central auction area. She spoke to everyone around her with a smile on her face.

“The first item to be auctioned is a third-level insightful emptiness realm magic staff with a fire attribute. The starting price is 10 billion middle-grade spirit stones!”

The auction did not take long to start.

The first item to be auctioned was a third-level insightful emptiness realm magic staff with a high price.

“This seems to be the magic staff that I sent to auction!”

Wang Xian smiled when he saw the weapon that was brought up.

The starting price for a third-level insightful void stage staff was 10 billion middle-grade spirit stones. The starting price was not high, but the increase in the competition was relatively high.

“15 billion!”

“16 billion!”

...

One by one, the forces began to bid. Soon, the price reached 21 billion.

The final price also dropped to 21 billion.

The second item was a piece of armor!

There were more than 30 larger forces, dozens of second-level forces, and itinerant cultivators present.

Wang Xian glanced around and saw that there were about 300 insightful emptiness realm experts.

Basically, most of the insightful emptiness realm experts who came to Xiao Yao City were gathered here.

With so many experts, the total amount of spirit stones in their hands amounted to at least tens of trillion middle-grade spirit stones.

After all, the value of the items in each auction was no less than ten trillion.

“The next item to be auctioned is a set of elixirs that can help improve one’s comprehension and clear one’s mind. The elixirs are of extraordinary ninth grade and each of them is worth 50 million middle-grade spirit stones. There are a total of 3,000 of them. The starting bid will be 1,000 to 1,000 of them!”

“The first set will be 1,000 of them. The starting bid will be 50 billion middle-grade spirit stones!”

After auctioning more than a dozen items consecutively, one item caught Wang Xian’s attention.

It was a medicinal pill. Furthermore, it was an extraordinary ninth-grade medicinal pill. Naturally, he would swallow it directly and turn it into Dragon Qi.

After Wang Xian’s calculations, buying a high-grade medicinal pill at the same price would be more than buying many low-grade medicinal pills that would turn into dragon qi. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

For this auction, Wang Xian was prepared to buy all the medicinal pills in the auction.

“51 billion!”

Wang Xian raised the bid directly.

“Qingming Elixir, this is a good elixir to nurture strong people. 1000 pieces of 50 billion are not expensive!”

Some of the dynasties and sects around looked at the elixirs on the stage and followed suit.

“51.5 billion!”

“52 billion!”

“52.5 billion!”

...

Three factions called out their bids consecutively and raised the sign next to them. “55 billion!”

“Directly increasing the bid by 2.5 billion middle-grade spirit stones. Which faction is this?”

“Those who can sit at the front are all top-notch factions. However, I have never seen that young man before!”

When the surrounding factions saw Wang Xian increasing the bid by 55 billion, they were astonished.

Some of them looked over and discussed among themselves with a hint of curiosity on their faces.

“That is...”

However, at a spot not far from the center, a middle-aged man stood up abruptly when he saw Wang Xian.

He widened his eyes and stared at Wang Xian in disbelief.

“This... He is... He is the nameless sword demon, the Supreme Heaven’s pride expert, and a peerless powerhouse at the fifth level of the Seethrough Realm!”
