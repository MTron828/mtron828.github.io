Chapter 751: 752 chasing after a fairy? (4/5)

Translator: 549690339

“Wait a minute, I want the remaining seven drops of hundred flower liquid. What do you need?”

When Wang Xian finished his sentence!

When he thought of this sentence, everyone around was stunned!

Including the Hundred Flower Fairy!

Even Glacier Cloud, who was standing there, froze instantly.

Seven drops of hundred flower liquid? What do you need?

What did this mean?

“What do you need? This... This young man is obviously chasing after the hundred flower fairy!”

“No Way, is he really here to chase after the Hundred Flower Fairy? Otherwise, why would the hundred flower fairy say what she needs?”

“Just how Rich is he to be able to say something so confident? What do you need? It Can’t be the descendants of other immortal gods, right?”

“It’s really possible. F * ck, you actually came to flirt with our flower fairy!”

Everyone around was stunned. Following that, they whispered softly and stared at Wang Xian in astonishment.

Bingchuan Yun’s face turned gloomy.

Flower fairy stared at Wang Xian in astonishment and frowned slowly.

“Young master, the hundred flower liquid is a barter. If you can take out something more valuable than what we have here or something that we like, we can trade it directly!”

“Three grade-12 spiritual weapons and three grade-11 spiritual weapons!”

Wang Xian looked at the hundred flower fairy and said directly.

“Holy Sh * t, so powerful!”

“To casually bring out four grade-12 spiritual weapons, how... how is he so rich!”

Grade-12 spiritual weapons were not like cabbages. Many experts in the infant realm might not even have grade-12 spiritual weapons.

Some immortals only used grade-12 spiritual weapons.

Each grade-12 spiritual weapon was enough to cause two infant realm experts to fight and even risk their lives!

Now that Wang Xian had taken out four of them at once, they wouldn’t believe it even if they were beaten to death if he wasn’t chasing after flower fairy.

Even flower fairy felt that this young man must be chasing after her. Otherwise, why would he take out such a precious item to exchange for ten drops of hundred flower liquid!

For a moment, flower fairy fell silent!

Among the many suitors, there was not a single one who could take out four grade-12 spirit tools at once!

Even Glacier Cloud only took out a grade-12 spirit tool this time.

She did not immediately agree because she would not accept even the most precious item given to her by someone she did not like.

She didn’t dare to accept such a precious item from a young man whom she had met for the first time!

“If you aren’t satisfied with these items, tell me what you need. I will try my best to satisfy you!”

Wang Xian frowned slightly when he saw that flower fairy didn’t say anything. He told her directly.

“F * ck, so... so domineering!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“F * ck, you are so domineering even when chasing flower fairy. You are indeed a nouveau riche!”

“Awesome!”

Everyone was stunned once again!

Trying to satisfy you? How confident was he!

Flower fairy pursed her lips and looked at Wang Xian.

He was indeed domineering!

None of her suitors dared to speak to her like that. This gave her a strange feeling.

“Wow, he’s So Cool!”

“Oh my God, senior sister flower, he’s so cool. Nouveau riche, quick, quick, what does senior sister need? Tell me!”

The girls beside flower fairy were completely shocked. The way he pursued her was simply too domineering.

What do you need? !

I will try my best to satisfy you!

The group of girls said excitedly to flower fairy.

Flower fairy pursed her lips, but she still gritted her teeth. “Let’s exchange items one drop at a time!”

Bingchuan Yun heaved a sigh of relief when he saw flower fairy’s attitude.

Wang Xian was a little impatient when he saw her dilly-dallying.

As for the words of the people around him, he heard them clearly. However, pursuing her?

Bullsh * T!

Everything was for the pleasure of love. Although this flower fairy was pretty, she was only comparable to Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue, and the rest.

“Regardless of the transaction, I want everything!”

Wang Xian was a little impatient. “Tell me what you want, or three grade-12 spiritual artifacts and three grade-11 spiritual artifacts. I don’t think anyone can offer a higher price than me!”

F * ck!

The corners of the mouths of the crowd couldn’t help but Twitch when they saw how domineering Wang Xian was.

Even those infant stage powerhouses were speechless as they watched.

One could really do whatever they wanted with money, even if it was to chase after a beauty!

At this moment, the skinny young man sitting next to Wang Xian opened his mouth in a daze. His eyes were filled with shock.

Perhaps among everyone present, he was the only one who knew that this young man was not chasing after the flower fairy.

He was doing it for the person he loved!

“Alright!”

When the flower fairy saw how domineering Wang Xian was, she stared at him and gritted her teeth. “Level 12 wood spirit pearl, one level 12 wood spirit pearl. I’ll give you all the Hundred Flower Liquid!”

Seeing flower fairy state her conditions, everyone around could not help but sigh. Having money could really increase the chances of chasing after the goddess.

Even Bingchuan Yun’s expression was extremely ugly.

“Wood Spirit Pearl?”

Wang Xian frowned. Back when he killed the members of the Holy Medicine Immortal sect and the Holy Doctor Immortal sect, he did have a wood spirit pearl. There was even a level-13 wood spirit pearl.

However, all those wood spirit pearls allowed Wang Xian to nurture the dragon pearl.

Currently, he had a level-13 green dragon pearl in its complete form!

He really didn’t have a wood spirit pearl!

“I don’t have a wood spirit Pearl!”

Wang Xian frowned and shook his head slowly.

Upon hearing Wang Xian’s words, the surrounding people heaved a sigh of relief.

“However!”

Wang Xian moved his arm and a staff that was emitting a bright green light appeared in his hand.

The staff was about a meter in size and contained a terrifying amount of wood energy. The only flaw was that there were no spirit pearls embedded in the head of the staff.

Even so, the energy contained in the staff shocked everyone around!

“A level-13 spirit weapon, the weapon of the Immortals!”

“The energy of the immortals. Oh My God, it’s... It’s...”

In an instant, everyone around stood up and stared at the staff in Wang Xian’s hand with a face full of shock. Their bodies trembled slightly!

“A level-13 spiritual weapon, a wood attribute staff. However, the level-13 spirit pearl on it has been removed. However, this material alone is not inferior to a level-12 wood spirit Pearl!”

Wang Xian said to fairy flower calmly.

“Phew!”

Fairy flower took a deep breath. Her eyes were filled with excitement.

A grade-13 spirit weapon. Even if the wood spirit pearl on it had been taken away, its value far exceeded that of a grade-12 wood spirit pearl. In fact, the two could not even be compared!

This made fairy flower’s breathing quicken slightly. Even though her master was an immortal, it was not easy for him to take out such a precious item.

It was not just the flower fairy. All the disciples of the natural born celestial sect had burning eyes!

She raised her head and looked at Wang Xian. Her eyes were sparkling. “Are you sure you want to exchange such a precious item for seven drops of hundred flower liquid?”

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

Although this staff was precious, it was of no use to him.

Furthermore, after losing the Wood Spirit Pearl, this staff was only a pseudo-grade-13 spirit weapon that was inscribed with a formation. In the future, when he mastered the inscription formation of the spirit weapon, this staff would be easily refined.

Compared to Shu Qing, it was not even worth a single hair on her head!
