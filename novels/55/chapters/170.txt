Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

When Elder Fang saw another Level 4 Spiritual Bead, she suddenly felt like she was a beggar who had met a filthy rich person.

Her lips were parted slightly as she stared at the Spiritual Bead that every Martial Artist wanted to lay their hands on.

Such a Spiritual Bead was held casually by Wang Xian, who wanted to sell it for money. He dismissed this as something simple.

Xiao Yu was also stunned when her brother held out the Spiritual Bead. She hugged her brother’s arm immediately and exclaimed, “My tycoon brother!”

“Enough, let’s go!” Wang Xian smiled at Xiao Yu, “Get yourself washed up. You stink!”

“Okay! “Xiao Yu nodded to Wang Xian and ran back to the villa joyously.

Elder Fang stared hard at Wang Xian before she walked back to the villa.

Wang Xian went back and checked out the kitchen. He realized Xiao Yu and Elder Fang had bought a lot of food when he opened the refrigerator.

He made a simple breakfast and waited for Xiao Yu while eating it.

“Wow, brother. You made breakfast. But we can only have it on our way. The auction is about to begin!” Xiao Yu was thrilled as she took some food from the table and handed her Master some.

“Are we in such a hurry? Then let’s go now.” Wang Xian stood up and nodded.

“The auction starts at 10.30 am and ends at 3 pm. It will be almost 10.30 when we arrived at Flow City,” said Elder Fang to Wang Xian.

“Okay, let’s set off now!” Wang Xian nodded. He took out the Blood Corals and headed outside.

Flow City was the capital of the Southern Province. The prosperity of the city was similar to that of Rivertown. It was also a second-tier city.

However, Flow City was nearer to the first-tier city, Summer City. As such, the riches and the Ancient Martial Artists from the two provinces would be going to the auction held at Flow City.

“Here’s a list of the auction items. Miracle Doctor Wang, you can take a look to see if anything catches your eye.” Elder Fang handed an exquisite auction booklet to Wang Xian.

“Thank you!” Wang Xian nodded and took over the booklet with curiosity.

The first page was an introduction to Nine Stars Auction House.

Nine Stars Auction House was considered the First-class Force, mainly for auctioning some items that were from the ancient martial art world and the present society. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Apart from the Starry Auction House managed by the Starry Sacred Sect, Nine Stars Auction House was the top-notch auction house in the domestic country.

Each auction they held could attract many wealthy people and experts.

This auction was the same as well.

Wang Xian flipped to the second page, which showed the first item for auction.

The authentic calligraphy of Li Bai.

Li Bai, known as the Sword Celestial, was also a legendary Ancient Martial Artist and a powerful Inborn Expert.

The name, Sword Celestial, was crowned for his mighty swordsmanship.

At the same time, he had integrated his swordsmanship into his calligraphy. According to rumors, if anyone could decipher his swordsmanship from his calligraphy, he would definitely be able to obtain the inheritance of the Sword Celestial.

The first item, Li Bai’s authentic calligraphy, held high value in collection and cultivation.

The bid started from $20 million.

The second item was an antique which was not as expensive as the first one, with a starting bid of several million.

Subsequently, there were other antiques, accessories, and all kinds of jewelry.

Apart from those, there were things like renowned swords and herbs ranging from millions to billions. Many things inside the booklet stunned Wang Xian a little.

Besides that, there were a few secretive items which were unrevealed. However, the booklet claimed that these items would spur fierce competition among the experts.

Wang Xian flipped through the booklet and had some understanding of the auction.

The car drove them fast to the border between Flow City and Summer City at 10.10 am.

This area was a suburb with a pleasant environment and a beautiful lake next to it.

It was surrounded by villas too.

The car finally came to a halt in front of the auction house where various branded vehicles were parked around it.

[Nine Stars Auction House]

Wang Xian stepped out of the car and walked forward. He saw a huge stone monument standing beside the auction house as it gave off a majestic vibe.

“Let’s go. It’s almost time,” said Elder Fang to Wang Xian and Xiao Yu.

The two of them nodded and walked toward the entrance.

“Please show your pass!” Two young men stood at each side of the entrance spoke.

Elder Fang took out a pass and handed it to one of them.

“You may enter,” he said respectfully after examining it.

“Young Master Liu, you may enter.” At this time, the two young men spoke to the person behind them with respect.

“Mm.”

“Qingyue, Nine Stars Auction House shares a close relationship with the Liu Family. I’ll get them to keep a lookout for nice jewelry from now on.”

A young guy’s voice was heard from the back.

“Thanks, Young Master Liu!” A girl thanked him in a monotone voice.

“You’re welcome. I ought to do this,” said the young guy.

Wang Xian, who was about to enter, paused when he heard the conversation between the young guy and the girl. His expression changed.

“Hey, why did you stop suddenly? Move!”

The young guy’s impatient voice was heard from behind.

Wang Xian hesitated before he spun around. Xiao Yu and Elder Fang turned back with questions too.

Xiao Yu looked at the pretty girl in red and parted her lips. She quickly turned to her brother.

At this time, Wang Xian knit his eyebrow slightly when he saw that girl.

She was still the same one who liked to dress in red.

Looking ravishing as before.

The only difference was she seemed to be more aloof and tired.

The girl was Lan Qingyue.

When Lan Qingyue saw Wang Xian, she was shocked, surprised, and more... she felt a great sense of loss.

“How...” Wang Xian opened his mouth, “How have you been lately?”

He was mostly responsible for Lan Qingyue’s withdrawal from school. Wang Xian had always felt guilty to her.

“I’m good. How about you?” Radiance flickered in Lan Qingyue’s eyes, but her face remained expressionless.

“I’m good too.” Wang Xian smiled.

Young Master Liu, who was beside Lan Qingyue, was shocked as he looked at Wang Xian and Lan Qingyue again. His expression slowly turned awful.

Everyone could tell that Lan Qingyue had some relationship with this lad.

“Qingyue, who is he?” Young Master Liu asked with a darkened expression.

“Just a classmate. Let’s go,” Lan Qingyue replied in a down-spirited tone and walked forward slowly.

Young Master Liu looked at the back view of Lan Qingyue with a mixed expression. He then glared at Wang Xian with a pair of ruthless eyes.

He walked over to Wang Xian and whispered a warning, “Brat, I don’t care who you are. Just stay away from Qingyue. Otherwise, I’ll make sure you live in a living hell.”

Wang Xian was already in a bad mood when Lan Qingyue left immediately. Hence, he was impatient when he heard the young guy threatening him. “Scram!”
