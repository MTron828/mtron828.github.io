“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

On the battlefield ten thousand meters high in the sky, the terrifying invincible divine dragon used its dragon claws, Dragon Tail, and dragon flames to attack the burly old man.

Behind the Divine Dragon, the Vermilion Bird that was emitting terrifying flames blocked every attack that the burly old man released.

The flames that were filled with spirituality easily neutralized every attack of the old man.

The old man’s arms had completely disappeared, and terrifying cracks appeared on his body.

In order to prevent the powerful attacks of the Divine Dragon, he could only turn his body as hard as volcanic rocks to block the terrifying dragon claws.

Transforming into a body of lava was the most powerful defensive technique of their immortal sect, and also a life-saving battle technique.

However, it was easily defeated.

The tall and sturdy old man’s heart was filled with despair.

In the surroundings, a world-destroying battle erupted. The entire battlefield affected an area of 20 to 30 kilometers in the sky that was 10,000 meters high.

However, at this moment, the area of the battlefield was rapidly shrinking. Immortal gods fell from the sky one after another.

Every immortal god that fell to the ground erupted with a terrifying energy storm.

The ground below had been covered by a sea of fire, forming a fire domain.

“It’s over, the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect is completely finished!”

“The immortal gods of the two immortal sects are going to be completely destroyed. In addition to the experts being killed, the strongest experts of the two immortal sects aren’t even at the infant realm. The Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect is completely finished!”

“The Dragon Palace will become the strongest immortal sect in the jianghu.”

The surrounding immortal gods and experts were numb with shock as they spoke slowly.

In the sacred city below, many disciples of the two immortal sects couldn’t see the battle in the sky clearly.

But after hearing the screams of the immortal gods and the corpses that fell from time to time, they already knew the result.

The immortal gods that they were so proud of were being killed and slaughtered.

“I can’t accept this! I can’t accept this! All of You, die!”

At this moment, the red light in the air intensified. A wave of heat directly rushed downwards.

The terrifying temperature even caused some trees to wither rapidly.

“Be careful! He’s going to use up all of his blood essence and transform it into the most powerful attack!”

Feng Luan, who was standing at a thousand meters away, saw a terrifying red gas coming out from the top of Bian Jiang Tu’s head. A vigilant look appeared on her face as she warned Wang Xian loudly.

“I will transform into a volcano and erupt with the strongest fury!”

Bian Jiang tu shouted loudly. His voice was filled with determination.

“Supreme, no... No!”

The few remaining celestials around were horrified as they shouted loudly.

Boom! Boom! Boom

However, just as their voices rang out, waves of terrifying flames spewed out from the top of Bian Jiang Tu’s head.

It was as though the flames of life had covered an area of 30 to 40 kilometers.

At a height of 10,000 meters, it was as though a space had split open and a flaming domain had appeared.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

Wang Xian’s body shook as he transformed into a flaming divine dragon and activated the Dragon Pearl.

“Come over here!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Wang Xian hovered in the air. The members of the Dragon Palace immediately came to the space where he was hovering.

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

Feng Luan also let out a cry. She flapped her huge wings and controlled the terrifying flame and lava that erupted from the flat land.

He was like a huge volcano that had been dormant for thousands of years. Once it erupted, it would unleash an earth-shattering attack.

“Dodge, Dodge!”

Around him, the immortals and powerhouses who were relatively close to him quickly fled into the distance.

The terrifying attack of a superior immortal would be affected even if it was in the surroundings.

This was a suicidal attack and an ultimate attack to attack the immortals and gods of the Dragon Palace.

Unfortunately, the flames that the Dragon King and the Vermillion Bird released were not inferior to the flat territory. The two of them worked together and completely blocked the terrifying flames.

“Reborn from the Flames!”

At this moment, Feng Luan’s body suddenly moved and flew toward the location of the flame lava. She flapped her wings and began to quickly absorb the flame lava.

The Flames contained the Bian Jiang Tu’s essence blood, which was a huge tonic for Feng Luan.

“There are three more, kill them all!”

Prime Minister Gui’s voice sounded, and then the immortals of the Dragon Palace moved.

The three immortal gods were easily killed by them.

When the last three screams rang out, the entire world finally quieted down.

At this point, the twelve immortal gods from the Saint Medicine sect had all died.

None of the members of the Dragon Palace were severely injured.

It was a huge crushing victory.

“Roar!”

Wang Xian roared, “This is the fate of the Saint Medicine sect.”

He moved and flew towards the holy city.

The members of the Dragon Palace immediately followed behind him.

Wang Xian reverted to his human form and hovered above the holy city. He looked down at the disciples of the two sects.

When they saw the Dragon King and the group of Immortals standing in the air above them, everyone in the holy city was terrified.

“What is the Dragon King trying to do?”

“Don’t tell me he is really going to destroy everyone from the two immortal sects?”

The surrounding immortals were slightly shocked and looked over in astonishment.

“Dragon King, you guys killed our two immortal sects. What else do you want to do now?”

An old man raised his head in anger and stared at Wang Xian and the rest in the sky.

“They deserve to die. Kneel down!”

Kneel down!

Wang Xian roared with a face full of coldness. His aura instantly spread to the area below.

In the holy city, the expressions of the two disciples and their families changed drastically.

“It’s impossible to make us kneel down!”

A young man raised his head and roared at the sky with a face full of anger.

“Bang!”

However, just as he finished his sentence, he spat out a huge mouthful of blood and died on the spot.

“Kneel down. Don’t make me repeat myself for the third time!”

Wang Xian’s expression didn’t change as he stared at everyone below and shouted with a dignified expression.

They were disciples of the two great immortal sects. Now that they were defeated, it was already merciful of them not to kill them directly.

However, they had to pay a little price for their past mistakes.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

In an instant, the expressions of everyone in the holy city changed drastically. Some of them were kneeling on the ground, followed by many others.

“Even if I die, I will not kneel to the enemy!”

A young man’s face was filled with grief and indignation. Then, in an instant, he was killed by the terrifying pressure.

Everyone’s expressions changed drastically. They hurriedly knelt on the ground. They lowered their heads, and their faces were extremely embarrassed.

A thick wave of powerlessness surged into their hearts.

They originally thought that today, the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect would exterminate the Dragon Gate and shock the entire jianghu.

But they did not expect that all the immortal sects and gods would be killed and they would have to kneel in front of their enemies.

A deep sense of powerlessness surged into their hearts.

From now on, the world would have no Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect!
