Chapter 1276: 1277 was running away with its tail between its legs

Translator: 5496903

“Roar, Roar, Alright, my demonic soul, if I don’t kill all of you today, I will be a king Beast of heaven!”

With a roar, the demonic soul that was standing on the heaven’s Pride Bridge leaped and landed heavily on the stage.

“Boom!”

A powerful aura was instantly released. Demonic Flames covered its entire body and the flames on its body were at least 100 meters tall.

It was like a flame demon king had descended. Its enormous body made it look disdainfully at Ling Jian ‘Er and Ren Xingchen, who were two thousand meters away.

Sensing the aura of the demonic soul, Ling Jian ‘Er and Ren Xingchen’s expressions changed slightly, and their faces were filled with a solemn expression.

“This... Jian ‘er is a little impulsive. A demonic beast at the second level of the profound void tier is completely not something she can deal with!”

Around the arena, the elder from the heavenly sword sect frowned slightly when he saw Ling Jian ‘er actually accepting the challenge.

“A person who doesn’t fight and doesn’t become a sword, very good!”

The white-haired middle-aged man’s eyes were filled with admiration, but very quickly, he sighed again. “My daughter doesn’t need to be so outstanding. Having a father is enough!”

“Sect master, if Jian ‘er fights with this demonic beast, she might be in danger!”

The old man said worriedly.

“Don’t worry, I’ve placed a sword of protection on her body. It’s a second-level void interpretation, so it can’t hurt her. That young man isn’t bad. He has two elements of metal and water. He’s an outstanding swordsman!”

The white-haired middle-aged man said as he looked at Ren Xingchen and praised him.

“That Ren Xingchen is indeed a monster. He has two elements of metal and water. Now, he’s half-step into the void interpretation realm and has the ability to fight above his level. However...”

As he spoke, he looked at the figure on the Prodigy Bridge. “That nameless sword demon is truly powerful. He should also have both metal and water attributes. However, he used a method to conceal his dual attributes. He should have already stepped into the first level of the Void Interpretation!”

“This nameless sword demon once saved Ren Xingchen’s life. He also saved Jian ‘er. Jian ‘er and Ren Xingchen are very respectful towards that nameless sword demon!”

“However, that nameless sword demon is extremely mysterious. He completely ignores Jian ‘er and Ren Xingchen!”

The white-haired middle-aged man’s eyes flickered as he looked at the Prodigy Bridge.

“Just the two of you? Get all the prodigies of the human race over here. I will kill all of you!”

The Demon Soul’s body slowly rose up and hovered above the arena. His eyes were filled with killing intent and disdain as he stared at Ling Jian ‘Er and Ren Xingchen. He roared.

“And me. I hope that you won’t run away after a while!”

Wang Xian looked at the extremely arrogant demon soul with a mocking look in his eyes.

He stood on the Heaven’s pride stage and moved towards the center of the arena.

He landed in the middle of Ren Xingchen and Ling Jian ‘er with a smile in his eyes.

When Ren Xingchen and Ling Jian ‘er saw Wang Xian flying over, they turned around and looked at him with a smile on their faces.

“Roar Roar! Escape? Haha, whoever escapes from the arena will be a coward and an ant!”

When the demon soul heard Wang Xian’s voice, it replied without hesitation. It blew on its nose and flames shot out from its nostrils.

“HMM?”

However, when it finished its sentence and looked at Wang Xian, its pupils contracted slightly and its eyes sparkled.

This figure was so familiar!

Impossible, this was impossible!

Following that, it shook its head!

“Alright, whoever runs away is an animal!”

Wang Xian revealed a faint smile and said directly.

However, Wang Xian’s words gave it a bad premonition. It fixed its gaze on Wang Xian.

“This nameless sword demon is really arrogant. He actually wants to fight to the end? Hehe, he really doesn’t recognize himself. Even if the three of them are at the peak of the Seethrough void stage, they are still no match for the Demon Soul!”

When manager Qian heard Wang Xian’s voice, he shook his head with slight disdain.

The humans around the arena were also slightly stunned.

This nameless sword demon was really arrogant and confident!

Could they really deal with a demon beast at the second level of the Seethrough Void Stage?

“Is this nameless sword demon looking for humiliation? If the three of them join forces, would they be a match for a heaven’s Pride Beast King?”

“The nameless sword demon might really have some powerful trump card. Who knows, he might really be able to defeat him. Pray!”

Some people felt that the nameless sword demon was a little arrogant, but some people guessed that he might have his own trump card.

If the three of them worked together, they might really have a chance to defeat the overwhelming prodigy King Beast, that arrogant beast.

“Roar Roar, Demon Soul King, kill that arrogant human guy and eat them!”

“Courting death, how dare you say such words. Eat them and let them know how powerful our Demon Beast Race Is!”

“Our Demon Beast Race is invincible, Demon Soul King is invincible. A mere human genius, just wait for your death!”

At the back of the Demon Beast Race, all the Demon Beasts roared loudly.

The entire arena was in an uproar. The Demon Beast Race’s genius King Beast was fighting against the top three human geniuses.

Both the demonic beast clan and humans were in an uproar.

“Let’s Fight!”

Ren Xingchen held the Golden Water Greatsword in his hand. His eyes were filled with fighting spirit.

Beside him, Ling Jian ‘er was also holding the golden longsword in her hand tightly. She was pointing it at the demonic soul. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Today would definitely be a satisfying battle.

“Come on!”

Wang Xian moved his palm and the demon-free sword appeared in his hand.

When the demon-free sword appeared in his hand, his entire body dashed towards the demon soul instantly.

“Eh? Senior, be careful!”

“Be careful!”

Ren Xingchen and Ling Jian ‘ER’s expressions changed slightly when they saw Wang Xian dash out directly.

They were not very clear about how strong Wang Xian was. However, they knew that his strength must not have reached the second level of the half-step void interpretation stage.

From the previous battles, he could kill two experts at the first level of the void interpretation stage.

However, his combat strength was still lacking compared to the second level of the void interpretation stage.

It was a piece of cake for a second level void interpretation stage expert to kill a first level void interpretation stage expert.

Even if it was three experts at the peak of the first level of the void interpretation stage, they would still be killed within a dozen moves if they did not have any trump cards.

The two of them hurriedly followed closely behind Wang Xian.

“Roar Roar, you are courting death. You actually dare to attack US Demon Soul King First and kill these three arrogant humans. Haha!”

At the back, a group of demonic beasts saw Wang Xian and the rest taking the lead to attack. Their faces revealed a brutal expression as they roared loudly.

Demon Soul King was invincible!

“It’s... It’s you, it’s You!”

At this moment, the flames on his body exploded when he saw Wang Xian attacking him.

His face was filled with fear as his eyes widened.

“Hehe, that’s right. It’s me. I let you escape last time. This time, it won’t be so easy!”

Wang Xian smiled warmly when he saw that the demon soul had recognized him.

He swung the demon-free sword forward.

Water tomb and Earth burial entwined. Two binding attacks were launched at the Demon Soul King.

“Damn it, damn it, it’s actually you. How is this possible, how is this possible!”

Seeing the familiar attacks, the Demon Soul King’s face was filled with fear as he roared loudly.
