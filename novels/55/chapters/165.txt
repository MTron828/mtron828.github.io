Chapter 166: Getting A Beachfront House

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Sister Li’s wedding had ended and Uncle Zhang and his wife were delighted,

After getting to know about Wang Xian’s background from Miao Zhiyong and the group, Wei Qingguo and the middle-aged lady had given up on some thoughts that they were harboring.

They knew about the reputation of Miracle Doctor Wang from the Old Street. It was just that they hadn’t seen him previously.

At this moment, they had truly witnessed his capabilities.

To make up for their actions for the last two days, they even wanted to head to Pengzhou to host a make-up banquet.

However, this idea was rejected by Uncle Zhang.

Now that his nephew and niece had made him really proud in Feng Lake County, he wasn’t really bothered by this.

What made Uncle Zhang and his wife really contented was that they wouldn’t have to worry about Xiao Li being put into a tough spot in the Wei Family in the future.

With all their assets transferred to Sister Li, the Wei Family would have to treat their daughter-in-law really well. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Otherwise, if they bullied Sister Li and she left, the Wei Family would be finished.

When the cowardly Wei Zhiwen saw how this had developed, he was thrilled instead. This made Wang Xian and Xiao Yu a little speechless.

This brother-in-law of ours... really has no desire to be in conflict with others.

“Xiao Xian, uncle really has to thank you for what you’ve done for this incident!”

After the wedding banquet, Uncle Zhang patted on Wang Xian’s shoulders and spoke with a radiant smile.

“Uncle Zhang, these are just some small matters. Ask Sister Li to bring you guys to First-grade Restaurant to have a meal over the next two days. Sister Li should know about it. This is the restaurant that I own. As for accommodation, you guys could stay with Sister Li over the next few days.

Wang Xian smiled at Uncle Zhang and his wife.

Sigh!

Uncle Zhang patted Wang Xian’s shoulders once again and heaved a sigh. With a flicker of gratitude in his eyes, he remarked, “Work hard!”

Wang Xian smiled and nodded his head.

“Uncle Zhang, Aunt Zhang, we are leaving!”

Xiao Yu waved at them before driving off.

“The returns of today are from small assistance rendered a few years ago. We are really lucky!”

Seeing the car disappearing from his vision, Uncle Zhang sighed emotionally.

Aunt Zhang who was standing by the side smiled and wrapped her arms around Uncle Zhang’s arm.

“Brother, where are we heading? Back to school?” Xiao Yu asked curiously as she drove.

“Let’s not return to school. It’s not convenient to always stay at school. I’m thinking of getting a house outside school,” Wang Xian said to Xiao Yu.

Wang Xian had made up his mind to get a house several days earlier. The dormitory room was small, squeezy and inconvenient. He definitely would like to have a house outside the school.

Moreover, it had to be a beachfront house. One where you could see the seas once you opened the windows!

“Brother, we are getting a house?” Xiao Yu turned her head towards Wang Xian and asked excitedly.

Wang Xian nodded his head. “Let’s get a beachfront house.”

“Wow! Brother, let’s go get a house!” Xiao Yu remarked agitatedly.

Wang Xian smiled. “Let’s go to the Supreme Seas Development Zone.”

Supreme Seas Development Zone was the name of a luxury development area. It was located by the Golden Supreme Coast.

Golden Supreme Coast was an extremely beautiful beach in Rivertown.

Currently, this piece of land was owned by a well-known developer. The developer had built a luxury living area on it and named it as the Supreme Seas Development Zone.

Houses within the Supreme Seas Development Zone were all beachfront houses. They were beside the seas and were sufficiently warm, so that flowers could bloom during the spring season.

The Supreme Seas Development Zone was a little far from the city area and would take forty minutes by car. It was also a half-hour ride away from school.

The car arrived at the entrance of the Supreme Seas Development Zone and they could see the golden beach illuminated by the sun from afar.

The entire beach was extremely breath-taking.

Within the zone, there were wooden huts and beautiful pools.

The villas weren’t beside each other and were widely apart from one another, just like a standalone villa.

Over this piece of land, there were only thirty to forty villas.

“Let’s go take a look at the sales office.”

Wang Xian looked to the sales building by the side.

“Alright, brother!”

Xiao Yu nodded her head and drove the car to the front of the sales building.

The Supreme Seas Development Zone was relatively pricier than the surrounding cities. The price of the villa started at thirty million each.

From what he understood from his research online, the houses in this area weren’t sold out yet.

Xiao Yu stopped her car at the entrance of the sales building. After alighting, she skipped joyously to Wang Xian and held onto his arm.

“Excuse me, is there anything I can help you with?”

There weren’t many people in the sales building. Only four to five salespersons were in it and they were just sitting by the side and playing on their phones.

A beautiful saleslady asked after seeing Wang Xian and Xiao Yu walk in.

Both of them were a little too young and no one had expected them to be buying a house.

“We would like to view the houses. How many houses are left in this zone?” Wang Xian asked directly.

“We are only left with the two most expensive villas. Their prices are both above sixty million. As for the rest, they are sold out.”

The saleslady smiled and replied.

“Hmm. Can you bring us to view the houses?” Wang Xian asked directly.

“Are you sure you guys are buying?” That sales lady looked at them in shock.

“Can’t we view the houses?” Wang Xian frowned and repeated his query.

“Yes, you can. Of course, you can.”

After taking a further look at their dressing, the saleslady nodded her head.

“In that case, bring us there!”

“Alright! Please wait a moment while I go get the keys!”

The sales lady nodded her head, took out two rings of keys before saying to them, “Please follow me.”

Hmm.

When she walked out of the sales building and saw the pink Bentley parked at the entrance, she was shocked. Soon, the smile on her face got deeper.

“Sir and Miss, let’s get there by cable car!”

The development area of the Supreme Seas Development Zone was huge and the separations between villas were huge.

Sitting in the cable car, the sales lady introduced the area to them enthusiastically.

“As of this moment, we still have two villas that aren’t sold. These villas are also the best. The villas have three floors with an area of 1,500 square meters. There’s also a carpark slot beside the houses.

The sales lady brought them to the first villa. Looking from outside the villa, the villa was exquisite.

The villa had a large yard in the middle of it with different kinds of flowers grown.

The villa had three floors with each floor spanning approximately 500 square meters.

The house was already renovated and fitted with the necessary furniture. There was a study room, individual bathroom and even a gym!

On the third floor, there was even an indoor pool.

The entire villa was extremely luxurious.

“The price for this villa is $73 million. There’s another villa a short distance away. That villa would be over $80 million,” the sales lady said to them.

“Let’s go take a look at the other one.” Wang Xian looked around the villa before saying this to the saleslady.

The sales lady smiled and said, “Alright, sir. The other villa has a completely different style from this. When you open the window of the other villa, the seas are just right below. The interiors are fitted with the best sound isolation materials. Therefore, you won’t find it noisy at night. Let me bring you guys there to take a look!”

“Sure!”

When Wang Xian heard her words, his eyes lit up and he nodded his head immediately.
