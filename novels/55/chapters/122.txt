Chapter 123: Let’s Be Friends, Tycoon

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

A pink Bentley slowly stopped at the roadside next to the girls’ dormitory.

Rivertown was considered to be the best second-tier city, but top branded cars were uncommon.

Especially a pink Bentley.

This was the luxury car that all girls dreamt of.

But 99.9 percent of the girls would not pin their hopes on it.

Not many people could afford a car that was worth four to five million.

At the very least, no one was driving such a luxury car at the University of Rivertown.

Let alone the ladies.

Hence, when the luxury car stopped by the roadside, it drew all the attention of the surrounding people instantly.

“What a beautiful car! It’s simply gorgeous!”

“Pink Bentley. Which girl is driving it? I’m dying of envy!”

“A Bentley. A girl driving such a car is simply too striking. I’m envious. How nice would it be if I had one too?”

“Must be an 80-year-old boyfriend gave it to her. Otherwise, how could she afford a Bentley?”

Envy and jealousy echoed in the surroundings.

“Brother, Xiao Mi, Yuanyuan, Su Qian, get in the car!”

Xiao Yu stretched her cute little head and shouted to Wang Xian and the rest.

Xiao Mi, Yuanyuan, and Su Qian were not surprised. After all, they already knew her brother’s capability.

But the guys and the other girl were totally clueless.

Xiao Yu was also a low-profile girl during military training. From her behavior, she did not portray herself to be a princess.

Hence, everyone was dumbfounded when they saw her driving a car that was worth 5 million.

Gulp!

Liu Hui swallowed his saliva in his Mercedes as he gazed at the pink Bentley with his eyes wide open.

“Out of expectation. I never thought that Wang Yu came from such a wealthy family. This...”

He recalled how he’d flaunted his Mercedes’ car key just now.

His lips twitched as he squeezed a smile on his face. “Wang Yu, I didn’t know that you’re actually a princess!”

“Hehe!”

Xiao Yu giggled to him. She noticed that the people around her were pointing and taking photos of her car, so she quickly said, “Let’s go. We better hurry up!”

“Okay, let’s go now!”

Liu Hui answered quickly. Now, he did not dare to pretend he was rich anymore. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Let’s go!”

Wang Xian sat in the passenger seat inside the car. He did not ride the motorcycle away, as Wang Dahai would be riding it over.

The three girls sat in the back.

The other girl and a guy took Liu Ranran’s car.

“Brother, this is too high-profile!”

When the engine started, Xiao Yu spotted that some of the students stopped walking just to view her car. They even took photos of it. For a moment, her cheeks blushed.

She had never been in the limelight since young.

“It’s okay, girls should be pampered!” Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Xiao Yu, you are so blessed to have such a brother. Others would be too envious of you!”

“Yes, Xiao Yu. You’re too low-profile. Just look at Liu Ranran. She can’t wait to let the entire school know that she’s an internet celebrity, earning $80,000 monthly, and owning a BMW!” Su Qian said from the back.

Xiao Yu smiled and said no more. She just wanted to be herself.

The car drove out of the school and headed to the old street.

After Xiao Yu parked the car, some of the guys crowded around her car with astonished looks on their faces.

“Wang Yu, this is awesome. Too impressive. It’s a Bentley. A pink Bentley. Gosh! I learned something today!” A guy said in exaggeration.

“Come on, it’s just a car.” Wang Yu smiled and shook her head.

“Just a car? We could worship the car!” A guy twitched the corner of his lips.

“We thought Liu Hui and Liu Ranran were already impressive. But Wang Yu, you concealed yourself well!”

Several of them rattled on.

Liu Hui and Liu Ranran at the side were looking embarrassed, but they did not say anything.

When the gap between both parties was too huge, they lost the motivation to make a comparison.

All they could do was worship.

No way could they make a comparison!

“Let’s go. I’ll take all of you to dinner. Later, you guys will sit at a table while my roommates sit at a table with me.”

Wang Xian explains this to them as he led them to the First-grade Restaurant.

“Senior, anything will do. Anything,” the guys quickly replied.

“The First-grade Restaurant!”

When they reached the door, the guys took a glance and looked at Liu Hui.

“Senior is awesome. Treating so many of us to dinner here could easily cost over ten thousand!” Liu Hui drew his lips as he spoke.

Liu Ranran nodded her head silently and followed them in.

“Director Wang!”

They heard the greeters at the side as soon as they entered through the door.

“Okay.”

Wang Xian nodded and continued his way inside.

The group of people behind froze as they were all stunned.

“The First-grade Restaurant is owned by Xiao Yu’s brother,” said Su Qian, looking at them.

“Senior owns the First-grade Restaurant?” All of them stared with astounded eyes as they were overwhelmed by the shock.

First-grade Restaurant! Looking at the fish that were worth millions on display, the amount of shock they received was hard to put into words.

“Xiao Mei, get the kitchen to prepare some dishes. Get us a big table for 12 people and a small table for 4 people. Prepare Two-headed Abalones for each table,” Wang Xian looked at Xiao Mei and said.

“Yes, I got it, Director Wang!” The server, Xiao Mei, nodded her head immediately.

“Okay, let’s go to the private room!” Wang Xian told them as he led them to a private room.

“Two-headed Abalone! Senior just took two Two-headed Abalones out. Gosh! They’re worth $600,000!”

“Gosh, we’re going to have a meal that is worth a few hundred thousands?”

“Hard to believe. It’s hard to believe!”

All of them were stunned. Even Liu Hui and Liu Ranran were dumbfounded.

The cost of this meal could easily pay for their cars.

“Xiao Yu’s brother is a tycoon. Did you all see the watch she’s wearing now? She just put it on today. Can you guys guess how much it is?” Xiao Mi lowered her voice and asked her with smiles all over her face.

All of them looked over.

Liu Hui was pondering, “That brand should be Patek Philippe!”

“Patek Philippe’s watches should be more than a few hundred thousand!” Liu Ranran continued.

“$880,000!” Xiao Mi gestured with her fingers.

All of them went into silence as they slowly shook their heads.

“Impressive!”

“I’m willing to shorten my life by 20 years to have such a great brother!”

This bunch of students finally understood who were the rich people and who were the tycoons.

They stared at Xiao Yu as they could not imagine such an approachable and cute girl to be so filthy rich.

First-class branded car, and a watch that cost nearly a million.

Let’s be friends, tycoon...!
