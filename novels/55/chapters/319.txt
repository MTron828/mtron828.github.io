Chapter 320: A Zither As A Gift (1)

Wang Xian didn’t like things to drag on in whatever he did. Since he had verified where the culprit had appeared, he would want to resolve this matter quickly.

“Heavenly Sound Sect?”

Wang Xian pondered for a while before asking, “Among the Sacred Sects, what’s the strength level of the Heavenly Sound Sect?”

“Among the eight Sacred Sects, the strength of the Heavenly Sound Sect is ranked fifth in the Underworld. It isn’t particularly strong but definitely not weak,” replied Mo Qinglong.

The eight Sacred Sects and five Sacred Clans were the thirteen strongest forces in China. Every force had a peerless expert that could send tremors to the entire underworld with a stomp of their foot.

Heavenly Sound Sect was located in Ning City. Wang Xian and the group had been there once.

There wasn’t any direct flight from Rivertown to Ning City. If they were to travel by car, it would take at least eight to nine hours.

“It’s already past 2 in the morning. When we get to Ning City, it will be close to noon!”

Wang Xian looked at the time on his watch and had no intention of wasting any time. “We will head there right away. Both of you, come with me. Let Mo Shiwu attend to the matters of the Spiritual Island. Besides that, get the Abyss along!”

This time, he was prepared to do this under the identity of the Abyss.

Wang Xian still did not wish to enter into direct confrontation with a Sacred Sect. Moreover, with his current strength, he wouldn’t be a match for a Sacred Clan unless they were in the seas.

On land, his battle prowess was similar to a Dan Realm expert.

After witnessing the strength of Sui Huang from the Sui Family, Wang Xian conjectured that there would also be Dan Realm experts within these Sacred Sects and clans.

Moreover, a Sacred Sect had a lot more Inborn Realm experts than Wang Xian.

Since the Abyss was already known throughout the Underworld, it didn’t matter if their name got a little more publicity.

Wang Xian revealed a faint smile.

Since eliminating the Dark Conjurers, the Abyss was widely recognized as the strongest assassin group in the Underworld.

There were even some members of the Underworld who believed that they possessed the strength of a Sacred Sect and was the most horrifying uprising force at this moment.

“Let’s return immediately!” Wang Xian said to Mo Qinglong and Mo Yuan.

“Yes, young master!” The two of them nodded their heads.

Wang Xian hesitated for a while, returned to the treasure room and took Zhan Lu and Hao Zhong with him.

“Her zither was destroyed because of me previously. I shall compensate her with this!”

At the thought of the cold expression of Tang Yinxuan with her broken zither, he shook his head slightly.

Holding Zhan Lu and Hao Zhong, Wang Xian headed towards the shore.

A short distance away, a yacht awaited him in the middle of the sea. Other than his yacht, there were over twenty ships in the surroundings.

Wang Xian jumped into the air and landed on one of the ships. He collected it as resources for his Dragon Palace before doing the same for the rest of the ships.

Wang Xian felt it was a little wasteful to convert these ships directly into resources.

When he returned to his yacht, Wang Xian placed the zither in his room. Lying on the bed, he soon fell asleep.

The yacht moved rapidly. When he arrived at Rivertown, dawn had broken.

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment. In the end, he did not make a trip back home first. Instead, he got Mo Qinglong to drive the caravan towards Ning City directly.

When they arrived at Ning City, it was already noon. The seven dragonians from the Abyss had arrived before them.

Wang Xian took out his phone, hesitating for a moment before dialling a number.

“Hello! You...”

From the other end of the phone call, a pleasing voice sounded. It was clear that she was shocked too.

At this moment, Tang Yinxuan was in a five-star hotel in Ning City.

Around the hotel, the disciples of the Heavenly Sound Sect were hosting a banquet. A 1.8-meter tall young man stood in the middle of the field. He was wearing a set of exquisite and traditional clothing, just like a prince in ancient times.

He stood proudly with his chest up and a cup of red wine in his hand.

A group of good-looking men and ladies surrounded him and were constantly showering him with compliments and pleasantries.

The young man was the Saint of the Heavenly Sound Sect. He had just emerged victorious from the selection today and would likely become the future Elder or even Sect Leader of the Heavenly Sound Sect.

Tang Yinxuan took a glance at the Saint in the banquet before walking to a corner of the banquet.

That young man had actually called her! She could still feel the palpitations and shock at the thought of the news she came across two days after she returned to the sect.

At that time, the strength that the young man had demonstrated greatly shocked her. However, all her attention was on her broken zither.

When she heard that the Abyss had annihilated the Dark Conjurers, she stared blankly into space for over ten minutes.

She knew that the young man was taking revenge for his subordinates. After luring out the assassins of the Dark Conjurers and getting some clues, he went to annihilate the entire Dark Conjurer organization.

In that case, the assassin group, the Abyss, was most likely his.

Even a Sacred Sect had to be careful when dealing with the Dark Conjurers. However, the Dark Conjurers were easily annihilated by the Abyss.

And now, the Abyss was classified as one of the existences that one shouldn’t mess with.

Recalling that young man and the Abyss, which was in the limelight recently, she felt conflicted.

“Erm... Tang Yinxuan, I’m in Ning City. Are you free now? I’m sorry about your zither previously. Therefore, I brought you something this time!”

The voice of that young man sounded from the other end of the phone. This shocked Tang Yinxuan.

She frowned, hesitated for a while and nodded her head before answering, “Yeah, where are you now?”

“LZZ International Hotel!”

“LZZ?”

Tang Yinxuan was taken aback. That’s the hotel she was in currently! “Tell me about your exact location. I’ll look for you immediately.”

“I’m in a corner of the restaurant lobby!”

“Alight, wait there for me. I’ll be right there!”

Tang Yinxuan didn’t reject Wang Xian. She was still curious about that mysterious and insanely powerful young man.

Now that he said he had something for her, she would like to take a look.

Tang Yinxuan hung up the phone. She hesitated for a moment before heading for the exit.

“Junior Sister Yinxuan, where are you going?”

At this moment, a voice sounded behind her. Tang Yinxuan frowned slightly but forced a faint smile out.

“Saint!”

She bowed respectfully and continued, “I have some urgent matters and have to go out for a while!”

“Oh? What urgent matters does Junior Sister have to leave in such a hurry? Are you worried about the selection tomorrow?”

The young man had a cup of wine in his hand and exhibited strong confidence. The vibes around him were something that even famous male stars couldn’t match.

“Yeah!” Tang Yinxuan nodded her head customarily. “There are some things I have to get prepared.”

“Junior Sister, if you agree to what I’ve suggested, I’ll lend you the Sky Devil Zither!” The young man stared at Tang Yinxuan intensely.

“Thank you, Saint, for your kind intentions. I have some urgent matters to attend to and shall leave now. Once again, let me congratulate you on becoming the Saint!”

Tang Yinxuan frowned slightly, gestured and left.

“Saint, hasn’t Tang Yinxuan agreed to be your girl? What an arrogant girl! With her current standing, she’s not qualified to be with you!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“That’s right. Our Saint is exceptional and will definitely become the management of the Heavenly Sound Sect in the future. For that Tang Yinxuan, her chances of becoming the Saintess tomorrow couldn’t exceed ten percent.”

“Senior Sister Hu has over an eighty percent chance of becoming the Saintess. Moreover, Senior Sister Hu is the daughter of our Vice Sect Leader and is interested only in you. I feel that Senior Sister Hu is a better match for our Saint!”

Behind them, a group walked forward and spoke to the Saint after hearing his conversation with Tang Yinxuan.

“Enough!”

The Saint’s eyebrows knitted together and he was clearly displeased.

Senior Sister Hu? That woman comes from a great background. Her looks and talents are also exceptional. However, she has already lost her chastity and couldn’t be compared with the demure and pure Tang Yinxuan.
