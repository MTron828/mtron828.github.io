Chapter 337: Horrifying Creatures (1)

Bian Yaoquan’s soft growl resounded in the tent, stunning everyone as they looked amazed.

An alchemist was a valuable occupation by itself. On top of that, he was a Level 3 Alchemist.

Today, most Martial Artists consumed Spiritual Grass directly.

There was a saying in the Ancient Martial Art World: it’s easy to obtain Spiritual Grass, but not Elixir Pills.

Spiritual Grass could be found in most of the deep mountain areas or along the riverbanks. They could also be grown through various unique techniques.

However, Elixir Pills were uncommon. Firstly, not many people could master the Art of Refining Elixir Pills. Even Sui Huang viewed the art as an heirloom. Hence, its value was evident.

Secondly, the consumption of the Spiritual Grass was way too overwhelming to cultivate an alchemist within average Forces that possessed the Art of Refining Elixir Pills.

The consumption could reach at least a hundred to thousands of tufts.

An average Force would not be able to afford to consume thousands of tufts of Spiritual Grass, even if the grasses were Level 1.

Hence, an alchemist was a rare occupation with high status.

“I did not expect Young Master Bian to turn out to be a powerful alchemist. What a great talent at such a young age. You’re truly someone from Medical Saint Sect.”

“You’re a Level 3 alchemist at such a young age. You must be gifted. That’s a rare talent!”

After Bian Yaoquan finished his sentence, the two Inborn Experts praised him from their chairs.

“Thank you!”

Upon hearing two Inborn Experts expressing their admiration for him, Bian Yaoquan felt he had regained some of his pride. He slightly lifted his chin and snorted to Wang Xian.

“Perhaps some people have forgotten about the saying that all medical skills in the world originated from Medical Saint Sect. Heh, heh!”

The Poison Duo at the side swept their cold gazes across Wang Xian, Sun Lingxiu and Miracle Doctor Blood Man.

“Enough, people. Everyone’s here!”

At this time, the middle-aged man in military uniform at the side called out. Bian Yaoquan brushed his gaze coldly at Wang Xian and the rest before he sat down at the side.

“I believe everyone has read the file that I have sent over,” said the middle-aged man as he looked at all the people around him.

Everyone sat there quietly as they did not dare to interrupt him. This middle-aged man before them was also an Inborn Expert, backed by the state.

“You should have some understanding about the creatures stated in the file. We invited all the Miracle Doctors here to find out how these creatures turned out to be such terrifying beings!”

As the middle-aged man spoke, he beckoned to the door where several soldiers brought out transparent boxes immediately.

In the boxes were several palm-sized creatures.

They were all the common insects like ants, leeches, and mosquitoes.

Just like the photos in the file, each of them looked terrifying and hideous.

Bam, Bam!

The leeches in the transparent box were leaping violently, causing banging sounds.

The power they exhibited was so huge that it was simply unbelievable.

“Miracle Doctors, come over and take a look!”

The soldiers placed the boxes on the floor while the middle-aged man spoke to the Miracle Doctors.

Without hesitation, Wang Xian stood up, followed by Sun Lingxiu and Miracle Doctor Blood Man. They all came to the boxes.

The rest of the Miracle Doctors also crowded together.

This time, there were less than a score of Miracle Doctors. Amongst which, those ranked fifth to thirteenth on the Miracle Doctors Chart were present. The remaining ones were elders of Sacred Followers Guild, and the Poison Duo from Medical Saint Sect.

The two elders from Sacred Followers Guild were about a hundred years old. They were no longer practicing medicine in public. Hence, they were not ranked on the chart.

However, their strength was not to be underestimated. No one knew how formidable they were.

Thirteen Miracle Doctors stood in front of four glass boxes, as they fixed their eyes on four horrifying mutated creatures.

“Hur?”

Wang Xian stared at the creatures and revealed a baffled expression on his face.

“Cadaveric? Why is this word showing up in the names of all the creatures?”

Wang Xian observed the creatures with uncertainty, looking surprised.

“These creatures had been sucking fresh blood to maintain their life. They were also evolved with an ability to survive in the water.”

The middle-aged man said with a solemn look, “Their combat ability is equivalent to a Level 7 or 8 Martial Artist which is very powerful!”

“What could it be that turned the ants into such horrifying monsters?”

The Miracle Doctors were puzzled by the ants which possessed the prowess of Level 7 or 8 Martial Artists. Ants can indeed kill an elephant now!

“Let me take a look!”

The Buddhist Physician, ranked fifth on the Miracle Doctors Chart, walked to the glass box with the ants and turned on the switch on the box.

Hiss!

As soon as the switch was turned on, a Cadaveric Ant revealed its gigantic teeth as it let out a shriek while biting down on the arm of Buddhist Physician.

Buddhist Physician remained unwavering. He reached out and grabbed the ant with ease.

“A rancid smell. No signs of vitality and pain. They are similar to the legendary zombies!”

Buddhist Physician examined the Cadaveric Ant in his hand and commented indifferently.

“Zombie?”

The surrounding Miracle Doctors were slightly stunned. Zombies did exist, just like the vampires in the western countries.

However, there was a huge difference between zombies and vampires. Zombies were dead before they were resurrected. They had no intelligence, with a natural instinct to suck blood.

But vampires were considered to be humans who had a unique way in Cultivation Arts. They were drastically different.

Zombies had been prone to show up in ancient times. But most of the people tend to incinerate bodies in the modern days. Thus, no such creatures appeared anymore.

Even if there were any, they were easy to deal with too.

“They are really almost like zombies. They are blood-suckers that can’t feel any pain. But humans will die after zombies suck their blood. If they suck the blood of humans, they will eventually turn into one of them!”

The middle-aged man added on, “Anyway, we took them to the lab for some tests. These creatures aren’t really dead. Some form of energy keeps them alive so that they can continue growing, which marks a big difference from zombies!”

The surrounding Miracle Doctors knit their brows slightly.

“Ack ack, let me see!”

At this time, Miracle Doctor Blood Man was curious since he was a vampire himself. Hence, it was natural for him to feel intimate with such creatures.

The rest of the Miracle Doctors looked at him as they shared the same thought too.

Miracle Doctor Blood Man stared at the box with the leeches. He reached out to the box and opened it, putting his palm inside.

Pa!

Instantly, a leech attached itself onto the palm and crawled up to his arm rapidly.

Miracle Doctor Blood Man did not hinder it as he watched the leech without a word.

The palm-sized leech raised its head, revealing a set of horrible teeth as it threaded its way into the Miracle Doctor Blood Man’s arm.

The younger ones who followed the Elders out for experience could not help but shiver when they saw the palm-sized leech squeezing itself into the arm of Miracle Doctor Blood Man.
