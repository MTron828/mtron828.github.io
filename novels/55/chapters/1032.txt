Wang Xian took out a number of weapons, armor, and spiritual herbs from his residence.

There were also some materials for weapon refinement.

Regardless of whether he obtained the equipment from the du family or the she family, he could not take them out for auction directly to avoid being discovered by others.

Therefore, Wang Xian modified all the weapons and armor.

With his craftsmanship level, he could completely refine a weapon of extraordinary level eight. It was an easy task to modify it.

There was only one level nine weapon that he did not have the ability to modify.

However, it was not a big deal.

In addition, he could refine the bluestone from the territory of the wind-winged fish into weapons and equipment.

Wang Xian was prepared to not sleep for the next few days. He would use all of it to refine weapons and elixirs.

Tonight was a very special night for everyone in Donghai City.

Curfew!

Donghai city, which had not imposed a curfew for a very long time, had implemented a curfew today.

Everyone had to return to their homes after ten o’clock. They were prohibited from wandering outside. Otherwise, they would be deemed to have violated the order of Donghai City and would be punished severely.

No one dared to touch the city Lord’s eyebrows here, not even those big families.

Everyone knew that the city Lord was furious this afternoon and vowed to destroy the dragon assassin organization.

The entire Eastern Sea city was silent. However, the forums in eastern sea city became very lively.

Everyone was discussing what had happened today.

Millions of people were discussing whether the dragon spike would be destroyed or the city Lord’s mansion would submit.

However, many people still hoped that the dragon spike assassin organization would be destroyed.

Because the existence of the dragon Spike would break some of the balance in East Sea city.

It was fine if I couldn’t beat you, but I could hire the dragon Spike to kill you.

Many people hoped that the dragon spike would be surrounded by the city Lord’s mansion. Of course, there were also many people who admired the dragon Spike’s behavior.

At the very least, it was very awesome.

Awesome was right!

In a luxurious manor, the entire manor occupied at least 6,000 to 7,000 square meters.

This was extremely rare in the entire eastern sea city.

The manor had a small mountain that was 100 meters tall, and the entire manor was incomparably luxurious.

Large amounts of spirit herbs were planted around it.

Large arrays covered the entire area, and there were even two eighth-grade arrays.

There were no more than five such luxurious manors in East Sea city that could be compared to them.

This was the Yun family, one of the top ten families in East Sea city. It was definitely one of the top families in East Sea city.

The Yun family started off as a mercenary group. Now, there were five mercenary groups under the Yun family, all of which were at least three gold stars.

The atmosphere in the Yun family these few days was a little heavy.

The most outstanding son of the Yun family head was killed, and four transcendent level seven members were killed, which made the Yun family head furious.

However, because of the incident with the dragon spike these two days, they didn’t take any action.

“How is the situation of the kid that you asked to monitor?”

In the main hall of the Yun family, the Yun family head sat in the middle and said to the few elders in front of him.

“Family head, ever since the people we sent last time disappeared, we haven’t sent anyone over!”

An elder said in a deep voice.

“En? Didn’t I tell you to monitor that Kid’s every move? If he escapes, won’t Hai’er’s revenge never be avenged?”

The face of the head of the Yun family darkened as he asked coldly.

“Don’t worry, family head. We have already informed the captains at the city gate. As long as that kid goes out, he will definitely be discovered!”

The old man who spoke did not show the slightest bit of panic. He slowly said, “Moreover, after today’s incident, all the city guards of the entire eastern sea city will be mobilized. Anyone who sneaks around will be investigated!”

“En, just don’t let that Kid Escape!”

The face of the family head of the Yun family softened. “A dragon assassin organization actually dares to provoke city lord lei. They are really courting death!”

“This dragon assassin is extremely arrogant. I wonder if he has any trump cards!”

The old man said in a deep voice.

“HMPH, what trump cards can he have? Not to mention the city lord’s residence, if that dragon assassin appeared in front of us, I would be able to exterminate them!”

The Yun family head’s face was filled with confidence as he spoke. He directly stood up and waved at the surrounding people.

“Go back and rest!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“It’s the head of the family!”

After everyone left, the head of the Yun family also walked into his own house.

He called for his two little wives and started exercising.

Today, Donghai city was very quiet. Many people slept very early and only the city guards were patrolling around.

At dawn, the entire Donghai City didn’t show any signs of abnormality.

However, after dawn, a black shadow suddenly appeared from the Yun family’s place. Following that, the black shadow slowly became blurry.

However, everything returned to normal as if nothing had happened.

“I’m Rich, I’m Rich, I’m rich this time!”

In the second half of the night, Wang Xian was at his residence. He looked at the items in his interspatial ring and his eyes lit up.

Just the middle-grade spirit stones alone were worth 1.5 billion.

All kinds of weapons, equipment, spiritual herbs, elixirs, and various materials were worth at least a billion.

There were also some weird items.

It was not an exaggeration to say that the items here were worth at least three billion middle-grade spirit stones.

These were all the treasures that he obtained from the Yun family.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes. With these resources, the auction could be held in a few days.

At that time, the life and Death Elixir Workshop and the holy item forging workshop as well as Feng Xian would be out of luck.

“Hehe, the auction is over. After this, I will find a place to transfer the Dragon Palace to the transcendence continent!”

Wang Xian laughed. This time, he was really excited.

“Next, I will prepare for the auction!”

Wang Xian immediately started to forge equipment and refine pills.

The curfew was maintained until five in the morning.

For those who went to bed early the day before, it was not too early to wake up at five in the morning.

“I’m suffocating. Let’s hurry up and take a walk!”

Beside the Yun family was another famous family in Donghai city.

The family had an extraordinary level nine powerhouse. Although their overall strength was slightly weaker than the Yun family, it was not much weaker.

At five in the morning, two young masters with folding fans walked out of the mansion and headed towards the central area.

“Sigh, why is the Yun family painted red...”

The two young masters played with their fans while one of them looked around with a frivolous gaze.

When he saw the big red piece of paper on the door of the Yun family, he said curiously.

However, before he could finish his words, he completely froze and a shocked expression appeared on his face.

“Congratulations on the death of the dragon spike. The Yun family, the door of the Yun family, how is this possible!”

A shocked voice came from his mouth.

“Something big has happened!”

Another young man looked over and shouted with a face full of shock.

“Ah!”

At this moment, the main gate of the Yun clan opened with a loud bang. Several members of the Yun clan cried out in fear.

“The old master and the others were actually killed!”
