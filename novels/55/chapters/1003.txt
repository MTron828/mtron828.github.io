Chapter 1004: 1005, listen to my command

Translator: 5496903

Beside the amethyst mercenary group, there was an old man standing next to Xiahou Ming.

“Elder Zeng, this is our savior. If it wasn’t for him last time, we would have died long ago!”

Xiahou Ming introduced to the old man beside him.

“Oh? I’ve never heard of such a monstrous student in the demon Hunters Academy!”

The old man looked curiously at the group of people flying towards them.

“New student, his strength is really abnormal. Back then, he killed more than a dozen cloud clams that were at transcendent level six in one move!”

Xia houming said with a face full of admiration.

“He’s so strong and so young. I wonder which bloodline family’s disciple he is from!”

The old man said slowly.

Regardless of whether it was the woman with an explosive figure or the old man, they all believed that Wang Xian had a powerful bloodline.

Otherwise, it was impossible for an ordinary person to reach transcendent level seven at this age when they were cultivating. There was no such monster in the entire continent.

It was highly possible for him to have a powerful bloodline.

The Prince of the royal family of the Drakonid Empire on the continent had the strength of a transcendent level seven or eight at such a young age.

From their point of view, Wang Xian must have a powerful bloodline.

“I hope he has a powerful background. Otherwise, the Yun family will take revenge...”

Xia houming sighed slightly.

“I’m sorry everyone, I’m Late!”

Wang Xian looked at the group of people and said apologetically as he landed on the ground.

He swept his gaze across the group of people and was slightly surprised.

There were two extraordinary level-seven powerhouses, a lady with a terrifying figure and an old man.

His eyes subconsciously paused on the lady with a better figure.

The figure of this lady reminded him of the exaggerated figures of the girls in the anime.

This... was too explosive!

“I didn’t see any embarrassment on your face!”

The lady saw Wang Xian’s expression and said coldly.

“Shall we set off now?”

Wang Xian smiled and said to Zhang Yitian, Xia, and Hou Ming.

“Let’s go, Captain Wang. This is my aunt, Zhang Fengying. This is elder Zeng. For this mission, let’s Go Together!”

Zhang Yitian tugged at his aunt’s clothes and introduced her to Wang Xian.

“Hello, my name is Wang Xian!”

Wang Xian nodded.

Zhang fengying sized up Wang Xian as a green light flashed in her eyes.

“Transcendent level five. There’s also a group of transcendent level five people behind him?”

Zhang Fengying narrowed her eyes slightly and said to Zhang Yitian.

“HMM? No... That’s impossible. Leader Wang’s strength!”

Zhang Yitian was a little stunned. However, when he saw the green light in his aunt’s eyes, he was stunned again.

“Aunt, how can leader Wang’s strength be at transcendent level five? When he was seriously injured, he could kill four to five experts at transcendent level six with a single move!”

Deputy Commander Xiao was slightly taken aback and said in disbelief.

“Call me sister Ying, don’t Call Me Old!”

Zhang Fengying heard her words and waved her hand.

This made deputy commander Xiao slightly embarrassed.

“Hehe, this... Sister Ying, Commander Wang killed more than a dozen ferocious beasts at transcendent level six with a single move back then. How can he be at transcendent level five?”

Xia houming shook his head in disbelief.

“Looks like your bloodline is better at concealing your strength!”

Zhang Fengying glanced at Wang Xian with interest.

This made him slightly stunned. He felt that this woman with an extremely good figure was a little narcissistic.

The amethyst mercenary group had 20 members this time. The weakest among them was at level 5 and there were also five at level 6.

The strength of the Void Beast mercenary group was similar to that of the amethyst mercenary group. The same strength should be used to distribute treasures.

The mission of the Wind Wing Savage Fish Demon Beast was an official mission of East Sea city. It was not a special mission of the Demon Hunter Academy.

This mission allowed ten mercenary groups to complete it together.

“Let’s go. When the time comes, everyone listen to my orders!”

Zhang Fengying looked around like a big sister and said to everyone.

“With Miss Zhang’s eye technique, we will naturally listen to your orders!”

Elder Zeng, who was at transcendent level seven, cupped his hands at Zhang Fengying and agreed.

This made Wang Xian slightly surprised. It seemed that Zhang Fengying, who had a hot figure, had some ability.

“How is it, little guy?”

Zhang Fengying looked at Wang Xian and said condescendingly.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian realized that he was much shorter than Zhang Fengying. His figure was less than 1.8 meters.

However, Zhang Fengying was close to 1.9 meters, which was about the same height as Zhang Yitian.

This made him feel a little awkward and he said it directly.

As for Wang Xian saying that he would listen to his commands, Wang Xian didn’t agree to it immediately.

With Wang Xian’s light and dark fire dragon eyes, it was more appropriate for him to command.

“HMPH, let’s Go!”

Seeing that he didn’t reply, Zhang Fengying snorted softly and flew straight into the sky. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The rest of them quickly followed behind.

“Captain Wang, my aunt is very perceptive. You can listen to her first!”

Zhang Yitian whispered to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian nodded his head. The rest of them immediately flew towards the region of the Dragon Wind.

The region of the Dragon Wind was 100 kilometers away from Donghai City. The reason why it was called the region of the dragon wind was because the wind and waves here were very strong.

Under normal circumstances, the waves could reach a height of 100 meters.

In this region, there were actually tornadoes. Sometimes, there were even blade-splitting storms that could kill a type 5 or 6 transcendent.

At the bottom of the sea, there was an undersea forest.

At the bottom of the sea, there was a type of wind chime tree. This type of tree could make a sound at the bottom of the sea. It was extremely mystical.

Along the way, they encountered more than a dozen supernatural level three or four flying ferocious beasts. They were easily dealt with by them.

Two to three hours later, Wang Xian saw the waves in front of him becoming more turbulent. Huge waves came one after another.

The wind was also more than ten times the size of the area around Donghai City.

Wang Xian even saw a huge phenomenon of a dragon sucking water.

“Let’s go down from here!”

After Zhang Fengying entered this place, her speed became even faster. A green light flashed in his eyes as he spoke to the people around him before entering the sea.

Wang Xian and the rest immediately followed behind him.

“The wind-winged Savage Fish Demon Beasts live in the wind-bell forest at the bottom of the sea. They are digging a cave underground and the cave is in all directions. The wind-winged Savage Fish Demon Beasts are controlling a group of ferocious beasts. Among them, the main one is the jinlin boa. Everyone must be careful. If you are suddenly attacked by the Jinlin Boa or the wind-winged savage fish, no one will be able to save you!”

After entering the ocean, Zhang Fengying’s expression turned serious. He was holding a long whip in his hand and looked like a queen!

Wang Xian looked down. The depth of the area was more than 20,000 meters. At a glance, it looked like a huge forest.

The wind chime tree was about 30 meters tall. It was located at the bottom of the ocean. A slight touch would cause a sound.

Once a fight broke out here, it would definitely attract the attention of the surrounding people.

It was also because of the wind chime tree that a few years ago, many powerful mercenary groups were unable to do anything to the wind wing rampant fish race.

“We must land at the bottom of the sea, or else we will be more easily discovered!”

Zhang Fengying’s eyes flickered with a green light as she spoke to them.

Everyone understood this place and nodded as they followed behind her!
