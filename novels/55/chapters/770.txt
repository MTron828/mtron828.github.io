Chapter 771: 0772 grand competition of the disciples of the immortal sects

Translator: 549690339

“Dragon King, the grand competition of the disciples of the immortal sects is the recognition of each immortal sect and their disciples. Each of the twenty immortal sects will take out a treasure as a reward for the winning disciples!”

“According to the rules of our grand competition, those who are in the top twenty and have joined the Dragon sect will be ranked twenty-one. Those who enter the ranking will be rewarded.”

“The Dragon Gate can join the competition directly. What do you think, Dragon King?”

The two middle-aged men from the Xuan Yuan clan smiled at Wang Xian.

“Reward?”

Wang Xian looked thoughtful. “Then let’s make a grade-13 spiritual weapon. It’s a celestial weapon. It can be customized!”

After obtaining the art of engraving formations from Feng Luan, Wang Xian could already forge grade-13 spiritual weapons.

With the materials he had now, he could forge many grade-13 spirit weapons.

It was very suitable for him to take out the celestial weapon as a reward. After the grade-13 spirit weapon, he could add more and custom-make it.

This was to promote his forging workshop in the future. In addition, he could also showcase the heroic spirit of the Dragon Gate.

“Grade-13 spirit weapon?”

The two middle-aged men were slightly stunned. A hint of shock flashed in their eyes.

“Dragon King, are you sure that it’s a grade-13 spiritual weapon?”

They pursed their lips and asked again in surprise.

“Of course. I’m a weaponsmith. I can tailor-make a spiritual weapon for the winner!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile.

“Dragon King, you’re really generous. This reward of yours can be used as the reward for the first winner!”

The two of them smiled and said, “Oh right, Dragon King, each immortal sect has a spot for a guaranteed disciple. The guaranteed disciple can enter the competition for the twenty-one spots directly. There is no need for the previous competition!”

“If it’s a disciple, there might not be a disciple from the Dragon sect participating in this competition!”

Wang Xian smiled and shook his head. “Oh right, if the two of you need to refine a grade-13 spiritual weapon in the future, I can do it as long as you bring out three sets of materials. Hehe, in the future, our dragon sect will open a forging workshop and advertise it now!”

“Three sets of materials can be used to refine a grade-13 spiritual weapon!”

The two middle-aged men looked at each other in astonishment.

“Looks like I’ll have to trouble you, Dragon King, to help me refine weapons in the future!”

The two middle-aged men were even more enthusiastic as they smiled at Wang Xian.

Among all the immortal sects, the Yongchang Immortal sect was the strongest in refining weapons. There were two immortals in the Yongchang immortal sect who could refine a grade-13 spiritual weapon. Furthermore, the success rate was only one-third to one-fourth.

Furthermore, the two immortal gods basically would not craft a spiritual weapon.

Other than the immortal gods from the Yongchang Immortal sect, there were no more than three who could craft a level-thirteen spiritual weapon. To get them to craft a spiritual weapon of the immortal God, they would have to pay a terrifying price.

Now that three sets of materials could be used to craft a spiritual weapon of the immortal God, it was believed that many immortal gods would come!

The spiritual weapon of the immortal God was different from a level-twelve spiritual weapon. The spiritual weapon of the immortal God already possessed the way of transformation and was very difficult to craft.

Wang Xian smiled when he saw their expressions. Although inscribing an array formation was more complicated and difficult with a high failure rate, it was not a big problem for him.

A 100% success rate might not be possible, but there was a 90% success rate.

Moreover, if he were to let Feng Luan refine it, it would be a 100% success rate.

Now that he could get two out of three sets of materials, the benefits were already astonishing.

“Of course, no problem. At most, the Dragon Gate Workshop will officially open in all the major cities in a month!”

Wang Xian smiled.

“Alright, we will be there on time. We Shall Disturb You Then. We will meet again at the disciple competition in two days!”

The two middle-aged men cupped their hands at Wang Xian.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded. “Thank you for your hard work. These are the earth star fish that we caught in the mysterious sea today. Consider them as gifts!”

As he spoke, he smiled and handed over more than 70 earth star fish.

“More than 70 earth star fish. Dragon King, you are really generous!”

The two middle-aged men looked at the net of Earth star fish with a slightly bitter expression. Their eyes lit up as well.

The preciousness of more than 70 earth star fish was enough to move the hearts of Immortals and deities!

“Haha, we have caught more than 1,000 of them over the past few days. It’s not a big deal to give you more than 70 of them. Take care, both of you!”

Wang Xian cupped his hands and smiled at him.

“Alright, then we won’t be stingy in accepting them. When we arrive at the Xuanyuan clan, we will take good care of you, Dragon King!”

The two middle-aged men cupped their hands happily and accepted the earth star fish. Then, they flew into the distance.

“This dragon king is very different from the one in the information. He looks good and has a very good character!”

“Maybe it’s because of the powers of our Xuanyuan clan. However, looking at how generous he is, he is indeed not as difficult to get along with as described in the information!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The two of them who came to the sky on their Flying Swords conversed in a low voice. Their figures turned into an aurora and disappeared.

“Xiao Xian, are we going to participate in the Celestial Sect’s disciple competition?”

Guan Shuqing asked Wang Xian curiously from the side.

“Of course, we have to participate. The so-called celestial sect’s competition is a competition between the forces of the Jianghu and also a demonstration of the powers of the celestial sect. Now that the name of the Dragon Gate has spread throughout the jianghu, this competition is also the first time the Dragon Gate will make an appearance!”

“When the time comes, you, me, and Ao Jian will go together. It will also be a demonstration of the powers of the Dragon Gate!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“If it’s the day after tomorrow, we will have to make some preparations!”

Guan Shuqing nodded.

“Okay, call all the disciples of the Dragon Gate. We will head over immediately!”

Wang Xian nodded.

The group of them came to a restaurant in a small town beside the mysterious sea. Wang Xian immediately contacted Xiao Yu and Qing Yue.

A few girls were very interested in the competition this time around and expressed that they would go together.

Naturally, Wang Xian agreed gladly.

The next day, Wang Xian called Prime Minister Gui over and asked him to bring back the corpse of the immortal-level water-striped unicorn.

With the corpse of the water-striped unicorn, with the effect of cultivating the star guiding disc for more than a year, it was entirely possible to create one or even two immortal-level members.

The Dragon Palace currently had 33 half-step immortal-level immortals. These 33 half-step immortal-level immortals had a high possibility of stepping into the immortal-level at any time.

Apart from that, the nine Hui’s were currently in the process of breaking through. It would only take them a few months to reach the immortal God realm.

At that time, the nine Hui’s would have the combat strength of nine immortal gods.

When they came out, the Dragon Palace’s strength would receive a terrifying increase.

These few days, Wang Xian was prepared to go to the mysterious sea to devour some aquatic creatures. However, after searching for half a day, he only found a few dozen elixir realm and an infant realm creature. He had only increased his dragon qi by about ten million.

“Brother, sister-in-law Shu Qing!”

At noon the next day, Xiao Yu, Qing Yue, Ao Jian, and the group of Drakonids rushed to the small town beside the mysterious sea.

Other than them, there were also ten strange demons hiding in the void. Ao Yao was among them.

“Let’s go. Let’s head to the immortal gate of the Xuan Yuan clan!”
