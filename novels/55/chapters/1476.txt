Chapter 1477: 1477 headed toward the He clan

“I heard that the heartless sword path sect only has around two hundred experts. The weakest one is a rank three void interpretation expert, and their sword techniques are extremely terrifying. They can easily kill experts of the same level as the towering sky sword sect!”

“Such a mysterious force suddenly rose. I wonder if this matter is good or bad for us!”

In front of the heartless sword path sect, experts from five forces stood in the center.

There were two dynasties, one clan, and two sects. Behind them, there were more than twenty insightful emptiness realm experts.

Around them were many small-scale clans and factions. Each clan had around ten insightful emptiness realm experts.

There were more than a thousand people in total. They were discussing in low voices.

“Ka Ka Ka!”

At this moment, the Heartless Sword Dao sect’s sect opened. Ren Xingchen’s gaze swept across all the factions.

“Everyone, please come in!”

Ren Xingchen said indifferently and made an inviting gesture.

“This young man has the combat strength of a third-level profound void martial artist. I heard that he used to be the young master of the Ren clan in ancient magic city. The Ren clan was exterminated, and he came here to take revenge. The destruction of the towering sky sword sect is also related to this young man!”

“Right now, Ren Xingchen’s talent and strength are at the peak even in our vast region. Even the young masters of those super factions can’t compare to him!”

Seeing Ren Xingchen, some people from the five third-rate forces whispered.

The leaders of the forces nodded silently and looked at Ren Xingchen with some amazement.

“This must be little brother Ren Xingchen. I’m the monarch of the Celestial Soldier Empire. I really didn’t expect little brother Ren Xingchen to be a heaven’s favorite from ancient Magic City!”

A group of forces walked inside. An old man dressed in a dragon robe greeted Ren Xingchen with a smile on his face.

“Celestial soldier monarch, I’ve heard a Lot About You!”

Ren Xingchen cupped his hands.

He naturally knew about the celestial soldier monarch. The ancient magic city belonged to the Celestial Soldier Empire. Speaking of which, the Ren clan was their people in the past.

“No need, no need. What happened two years ago was really regrettable. Little Brother Ren Xingchen, do you need to erect a monument in the ancient magic city to pay tribute to the deceased?”

The celestial soldier Monarch said with a smile.

Ren Xingchen was a little moved when he heard the celestial soldier monarch’s words.

“Haha, Little Brother, leave this matter to us. When the time comes, I’ll send someone to call for you!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The celestial soldier Monarch said with a face full of smiles. It was obvious that he wanted to befriend Ren Xingchen.

“Thank you, Celestial Soldier Monarch!”

Ren Xingchen nodded his head in gratitude.

“Haha, no need, no need!”

The celestial weapon monarch waved his hand with a face full of laughter. He was in a great mood.

The surrounding forces looked at the celestial weapon monarch with slight envy.

Obviously, being able to befriend the people of the Heartless Sword Dao sect at this time was very beneficial to them.

“Little brother Ren Xingchen is really talented...”

The sect masters, Kings, and clan leaders of the other forces also smiled and tried to get on their good side.

Ren Xingchen smiled at them.

These people used to be him. They were even existences that the Ren clan had to look up to. Now, all of them were greeting him warmly.

“We’re Here!”

After walking for more than ten minutes, they arrived at the banquet hall.

At this moment, there were only Wang Xian, Ao Jian, and two civil officials of the Dragon Palace in the hall.

“Everyone, Welcome!”

When Wang Xian saw the arrival of the forces, a faint smile appeared on his face as he spoke to them.

“I dare not, I dare not. Greetings, Sir!”

“It is our honor that sir can invite us!”

“We have brought some small gifts. I hope that Sir can accept them with a smile!”

The forces quickly bowed to Wang Xian and placed the gifts they brought aside.

“Everyone, there’s no need to be so polite. Please take a seat. I’ve called all of you here today and I have something that I need your help with!”

Wang Xian said politely to them.

“I don’t dare to. If you have anything, you can tell us directly. We will definitely do what we can do!”

When the group of forces saw how courteous Wang Xian was, they felt a little overwhelmed and quickly said.

“Everyone, please take a seat!”

Wang Xian gestured for everyone to take a seat.

All the powerhouses immediately took a seat. They looked at the sumptuous dinner on the table and looked at each other with a little doubt.

“Let me introduce myself first. My name is Wang Xian. I came from the Liuhai region from afar. I’m new here. Let Me Toast to everyone!”

Wang Xian picked up the wine glasses on the table and said to everyone.

“No, no, no. You are too polite, master Wang!”

The leaders and experts of the various forces stood up in surprise and said in fear and trepidation.

This... They knew that this very young-looking expert in front of them was a terrifying existence at level seven of the Seethrough realm.

This was the first time they had seen such a polite level seven of the Seethrough realm. It was simply illogical.

However, what surprised them was that the heartless sword path sect actually came from the Liuhai region, that small place!

“Everyone here is from a powerful faction within a radius of 1,000 kilometers. I would like everyone to help me find a person!”

Wang Xian toasted and waved his hand. A portrait flew towards the location of each faction.

“Everyone, please help me find a person. If I find the person on the portrait, I will definitely repay you handsomely!”

Thinking of Ling Jian ‘er, he silently sighed and said once more.

“Oh? Find Someone?”

All the surrounding factions were slightly stunned. They had gathered all these factions just to find a person?

And it was even a beauty?

This... this seventh level insightful void tier Lord...

“Lord Wang, may I take the liberty to ask if we should inform you or directly...”

The monarch of the Celestial Weapon Empire didn’t say anything, but his meaning was clear. Inform or directly capture her.

“Inform me. Everyone, please do a detailed search in your respective domains!”

Wang Xian said to them.

“Sir, don’t worry. When we return, we will immediately mobilize all our forces. As long as this lady is in our domain, we will definitely find her for you!”

The leaders of the various forces immediately said respectfully.

“Yes, thank you very much. Next, let the future sect leader of the Heartless Sword Path Sect, Ao Jian, and Ren Xingchen, entertain all of you. I will take my leave First!”

Wang Xian thanked them and gestured to everyone. Then, he turned around and went to the peak.

“No need to thank me, no need to thank me!”

Everyone said hurriedly. When they saw Wang Xian’s figure disappear, they were a little moved.

This was the first time they had seen such a level seven insightful void martial artist who was so polite and easy to talk to.

Moreover, during the simple conversation just now, they felt that this expert seemed to be very young.

“Everyone, I am Ao Jian, the sect leader of the heartless sword path sect. I have troubled everyone with the matter of searching for Wang Xian!”

When Ao Jian saw Wang Xian leave, he stood up and said to all the forces.

“Sect leader Ao, you are too polite. Lord Wang is really too polite. Just inform us about such a small matter directly!”

All the forces spoke to Ao Jian respectfully.

When they saw this situation, they heaved a sigh of relief in their hearts and began to talk enthusiastically.

“I hope we can find it. If we can’t find it, we can only look for he yuan to help!”

Wang Xian stood on the peak and overlooked this unfamiliar sea area!
