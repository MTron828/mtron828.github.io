“After paying such a high price, if we still don’t succeed, our Chaos Origin Immortal sect will lose a lot of face!”

“Moreover, Grand Elder told him to die, so he must die!”

The middle-aged man’s face was full of frost. The coldness on his face slowly disappeared, and he became extremely indifferent.

“Yes, vice sect leader!”

The experts next to him trembled, and a hint of fear flashed through their eyes as they nodded.

“Hurry up. We must kill him before the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect discovers him. Otherwise, all our efforts WILL BE FOR NAUGHT!”

“Vice sect leader, are you going to bring all the immortal-destroying demolition stones?”

The old man asked in a deep voice.

Immortal-destroying demolition stones were an extremely precious one-time use item.

This item was specially used to counter the Immortal Gate’s protective array. If there were too many immortal-destroying demolition stones, they could even cause damage to immortal gods. It was extremely terrifying.

“Bring them all!”

The middle-aged man said with a dark expression.

“Yes!”

A few elders quickly flew towards the chaos origin immortal gate.

“Are those four terrifying creatures human or not? How can they have such a powerful concealment effect!”

“And the strength of that girl is definitely not something an ordinary half-step immortal god can compare to!”

“The former Jianghu Dragon Gate, a faction in the real world, how could they have such terrifying experts? Could there be even more powerful immortal gods! ?”

The middle-aged man’s eyes flickered as he looked down.

However, at this point, there was no room for retreat!

“Ah Ah!”

At this moment, within the chaos origin array, the group of experts from the Chaos Origin Immortal sect were in a complete mess.

There were only seven experts left. Not only did they have to face this powerful girl, they also had to be careful of the sudden attack in the air.

This caused their hearts to be filled with despair.

The two infant stage experts were unable to dodge in time and were directly entangled by the two bone whips. The bone whips were filled with terrifying sharp blades, directly causing their bodies to be covered in bloody scars. Following that, they were flung heavily.

The two infant realm experts were killed.

Feng Lingtian glanced at Xiao Yu’s terrifying attack and couldn’t help but swallow a mouthful of saliva.

However, following that, his eyes were filled with fighting spirit.

If he couldn’t even compare to a girl, then what kind of man was he.

In an instant, the spirit sword in his hand stirred up a violent gale, bringing along a terrifying wind howl as he attacked the two infant realm experts in front of him.

The two of them were already filled with fear, only displaying seventy to eighty percent of their strength as they passively dodged Feng Lingtian’s Attack!

“Pu Pu!”

Suddenly, they felt the pain coming from their chests, and their hearts instantly fell into despair.

At the same time, there was also a kind of relief!

“I’m destined to not be able to kill a single person. F * * k, I’m the Crown Prince, when did I become a gigolo? I need to hide behind a woman!”

The corner of Feng Lingtian’s mouth twitched as he looked to the side.

On Xiao Yu’s side, there was a completely dominating attitude. This made him sigh at the gap between him and her. It was simply too big!

“No!”

The last scream came from the white-bearded elder. In a short five minutes, two half-step immortal gods and thirteen infant realm experts were all killed!

“Young miss, you are simply too powerful!”

Feng Lingtian looked at the corpses around him and came to Xiao Yu’s side with excitement. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Of course, why would I be as useless as you?”

Xiao Yu mocked him without giving him any face.

The corner of Feng Lingtian’s mouth twitched and he muttered softly, “Actually, my strength is also very powerful among those of the same level!”

“TSK, you even said that you, the demonic crown prince, who no one dares to provoke in the entire yellow cauldron region, have to give you face. Why? Are you using swords and sabers to give you face?”

Xiao Yu glared at him and looked around.

“Wait for me to leave, I’ll teach them a lesson!”

Feng Lingtian said with a slightly red face.

“The formation hasn’t been withdrawn yet, how are we going to leave?”

Xiao Yu looked around and frowned as she asked Feng Lingtian.

“Don’t worry. There are quite a number of people who have come to Mount Jin Ming. Very soon, someone will notice something strange here!”

Feng Lingtian said with a smile.

“Tell me, if we can see the situation outside, will the people outside also be able to see us?”

Xiao Yu suddenly said with a frown.

“Of course!”

Feng Lingtian nodded his head as though it was a matter of course.

“How did the array activate just now? Also, if the chaotic immortal sect wanted to kill us, why didn’t they remove the array after they failed? Why are they still here? If they were discovered, wouldn’t the array be occupied?”

Xiao Yu asked a series of questions.

Feng Lingtian frowned. He had never encountered such a thing since he was born with a golden key in his hand.

In the past, no one in the entire yellow cauldron world dared to provoke him. As a result, his analytical ability was even inferior to Xiao Yu’s.

“You’re really an idiot!”

Xiao Yu could not help but criticize him when she saw his appearance.

“I... I...”

Feng Lingtian was completely defeated. He opened his mouth and his face fell.

“Not good!”

At this moment, Xiao Yu’s face revealed an embarrassed expression. In his line of sight, more than 20 experts flew over. All of them were at the infant realm.

Feng Lingtian turned his head and looked over. His expression was also slightly embarrassed.

“The fifteen experts from before, together with the twenty experts now, all the infant realm experts from the chaos origin immortal sect are here!”

“Be careful!”

Xiao Yu’s face revealed a vigilant expression.

After fifteen experts died, more than twenty experts came. Clearly, they weren’t seeking death!

“Jin Beihong, are you guys going to completely shed all pretense of cordiality with the Yellow Heaven Immortal Sect?”

Right at this moment, an old man glowing with blue light suddenly appeared beside the vice sect Master of the Chaos Origin Immortal sect.

“HMM?”

Seeing this old man arrive, the middle-aged man’s expression turned slightly awkward. He asked coldly, “What? You want to save him?”

“Aren’t you all afraid that Ling Xiao will disregard the agreement between the Immortals and gods and fight to the death with Your Immortal Sect?”

The old man with the blue light did not answer his question. His gaze flickered as he asked.

“Ling Xiao? Hehe, since we dare to make a move, then we can deal with Ling Xiao. Our Grand Elder has already broken through!”

The corners of the middle-aged man’s mouth curled up slightly as he stared at the old man with the blue light.

“I see. Our Upper Nine Immortals sect will not interfere in your grudges!”

The old man with the blue light on his body nodded slowly and looked down.

Below, more than 20 infant realm experts came to the edge of the formation. Each of them was holding a golden stone.

“Immortal-destroying exploding stone!”

The old man who was emitting a blue light had a trace of surprise in his eyes as he watched silently.

“Not good, immortal-destroying exploding stone!”

Inside the formation, when Feng Lingtian saw more than 20 infant realm experts taking out the golden stone, his face revealed a look of fear.

“Run! The power of the immortal blasting stones can threaten immortal realm experts. Let’s Run!”

Feng Lingtian was shocked and shouted loudly.

At this moment, the formation disappeared and the immortal blasting stones were thrown at them.
