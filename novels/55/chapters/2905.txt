Chapter 2906: had the support of the Dragon Palace’s boundless Mana 4

The glazed domain was the number one region in the starry sky.

Countless experts were born in the glazed domain. The number one faction, glazed domain, had more than twenty divine emperors.

And these were just the divine emperors of the glazed domain. In the glazed domain, there were many other factions besides the powerful factions like glazed domain.

These factions were not as powerful as glazed domain, but they could still be comparable to a powerful faction in the heaven punishment ancient Sky Domain.

In the entire glazed tile region, there were more than 30 known divine emperors.

However, the current glazed tile region was filled with an austere aura.

The air was filled with the smell of the flames of war.

On the planet closest to the holy region in the glazed tile region, five figures flew over from the void and landed on the planet.

“Is this the glazed tile region? It looks so prosperous!”

Invincible battle technique scanned the surroundings of the planet and sized it up with a face full of curiosity.

“The reason why the glazed domain is known as the number one great domain is firstly because of the size of the glazed domain and secondly because of the glazed domain’s system. Compared to the glazed domain, it is relatively fair. As long as one is a genius, there will always be a day to shine.”

“The glazed domain has a lot of resources. In addition, with the threat of the monsters in the chimei domain and the threat of the mechs in the mechanical imperial region, there is no lack of experience. Therefore, there are many experts.”

The god Emperor of Shangshui looked around with a slight sigh, looking at the starry sky in front of him.

“Let’s Go!”

After he finished speaking, he put a long-sealed AI on his hand, looked at the information on it, and walked towards the teleportation array.

Invincible battle technique and the others immediately followed behind, looking at their surroundings curiously.

The teleportation array in the VELURIYAM domain was obviously much more numerous and more convenient than the other domains.

Shangshui divine emperor and the others quickly rushed toward the center of the glazed domain.

The planets in the glazed domain were all technologically-advanced, fantasy-advanced, and technologically-advanced.

The closer they were to the center, the more they could feel the heavy atmosphere.

Some places even had white cloth hanging on them to pay tribute to the fallen divine emperor.

Shangshui divine emperor looked at the portrait and photos of the fallen divine emperor, his face always solemn.

Invincible battle technique and the others looked over and discovered that one of the five fallen divine emperors looked somewhat similar to their master.

The five divine emperors were not all glazed divine emperors. Three of them came from glazed, while the other two were the patriarchs and sect masters of other factions.

After three days of teleportation, they arrived at a floating city in the sky.

The moment they came out of the teleportation array, they could see the words “Glazed world”in front of them.

This was an incomparably huge city. It could also be called an incomparably huge island in the universe.

The entire glazed world was abnormally prosperous.

The god Emperor of Shangshui looked at the world in front of him and stopped for a full ten seconds.

“Master, if you’re here, then let’s go. Let us take a look at our sect too.”

Beside him, the second senior sister, who was invincible in battle techniques, said.

“We’re all here!”

The god Emperor of Shangshui muttered. With a wave of his arm, he sent the four of them flying forward.

“Master came from Liuli, a large family clan of Liuli, the Shangshui family. Our Shangshui family has been Liuli for generations, and we are loyal to Liuli. A million years ago, master left this place for some reason and went to the eight desolates and six harmonies.”

Shangshui divine emperor said to them, his eyes shining.

“Your master-in-law died in the battle not long ago.”

After pondering for dozens of seconds, he added.

“Master, was he killed by the robots or by Yaoxie from chimei territory?”

Beside him, the burly eldest senior brother growled with killing intent.

“He died on the battlefield of Chimei territory.”

The God Emperor of Shangshui let out a sigh, tears glistening in his eyes.

The atmosphere fell silent. The god Emperor of Shangshui looked ahead and brought them flying at high speed.

Experts below the god Emperor level were prohibited from flying in the glazed world.

The god Emperor of Shangshui’s imposing manner was unobstructed, and no one came up to stop him.

After flying for a few hours, a huge building emitting five-colored light appeared in front of them.

The building was like a mountain peak and was exceptionally eye-catching in the entire world.

“Is that the origin of glazed tile? Glazed Jade Tower.”

Third senior brother looked at the five-colored building in front of him and muttered.

“That’s right, that’s glazed jade tower. The entire glazed jade tower is made of glazed divine stones and its value is sky-high!”

Shangshui Divine Emperor said in reminiscence.

“Senior, What’s the matter? Why are you here?”

When the god Emperor of Shangshui and the others arrived in front of the glazed jade tower, more than twenty middle-aged men immediately flew over and stared at the god Emperor of Shangshui.

Sensing the god Emperor’s power, they asked with vigilance and respect.

“Qingtian of Shangshui!”

The god Emperor of Shangshui said lightly.

“Qingtian of Shangshui?”

Everyone was slightly stunned and looked at him in astonishment.

“Qingtian, I didn’t expect you to break through to the Divine Emperor Realm!”

At this moment, an old man below stared at the Divine Emperor Shangshui and looked at him in astonishment.

“Hehe, I was just lucky. Twelve Protectors, you’re still the same.”

The Divine Emperor Shangshui smiled faintly and said to the old man.

“Come back. The past is the past. And your father…”

The old man looked at him and said slowly.

“I know, I have returned.”

Shangshui divine emperor nodded lightly.

“Welcome home, Divine Emperor.”

The old man bowed to him and said seriously.

“Let’s Go!”

Shangshui divine emperor’s body moved, and he brought invincible battle technique and the others to fly inside.

“He is Shangshui Qingtian, the one who heavily injured his brother?”

“Sigh, who can explain what happened in the past clearly? You must know that all of Shangshui Qingtian’s children died in that incident!”

In the sky, more than twenty middle-aged elders recalled some things and whispered.

The glazed jade pavilion was very large, covering an area of more than 10,000 kilometers.

Here, there were divine emperor powerhouses and core disciples who lived in glazed jade.

At this moment, several thousand people were gathered in glazed clan land.

The entire clan land was filled with solemnity.

In the center, there were three portraits, and a group of family and disciples stood in the front.

“Oh?”

The divine emperor of Shangshui and the others flew over directly, attracting the attention of some people.

Many of them saw the divine emperor of Shangshui, who was in the lead, and their expressions changed slightly. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Why is he here? Why is this guy here? !”

“HMPH, who asked him to come? If it weren’t for him, Qing he wouldn’t have died!”

Some of the people said this with anger on their faces.

“I asked second brother to come!”

A woman in the center said.

“Qing Shan has become a divine emperor!”

The five elders in front of the woman looked over and said with sparkling eyes.

“Oh?”

The words of the five old men caused everyone to be slightly startled. Even the woman was extremely astonished.

The divine emperor of Shangshui looked down without any expression on his face. He landed on the ground and walked straight forward.

Everyone’s gazes were focused on him.

Invincible battle technique looked around curiously and raised his brows slightly.
