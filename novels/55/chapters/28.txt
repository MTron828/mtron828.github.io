Chapter 29: A Massacre Triggered by a Bun (2)

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

At the bun stall, Wang Xian looked impassively at Director Li and the middle-aged man.

He was slightly embarrassed by the way they got their things done.

“I’ll let you have a taste of regret when the time comes.” Cold radiance flashed in Wang Xian’s eyes. He was a tit-for-tat person.

The middle-aged man scorned at Wang Xian. Subsequently, he bowed and scraped as he passed the pair of chopsticks to Director Li. “Director Li, please have it. I had my breakfast. You reaped quite an amount of fish in your farm. I’m sure you’ll sign the contract with the two countries in East Asia today.”

“Heh, it’s way within my expectation. Otherwise, I would not have loaned $20 million just to set up the fishery,” said Director Li with an indifferent tonality. But his expression was full of complacency.

“This time, your profits will double. You’re my boss from now on,” the middle-aged man quickly added on.

“Sure, Xiao Zhao, I guarantee you that you will not lose out if you follow me. This year, the fishery will produce at least 300,000 kilograms of goods. The export price is $60 per 500 grams. That would be $36 million. After deducting costs and manpower, the profits can hit around $20 million. Your small little fish pond can expand after today.” Director Li nodded with pride.

“Yes, Director Li. I’ll follow you after this year. You got your investment capital back just within a year. That’s awesome!”

“Heh, oh, right. Have you found a channel for my seafood? I am short on premium seafood supply in the First-grade Restaurant. The last supply channel was gone, and the school will reopen soon. The current situation doesn’t look optimistic. This will tarnish my brand name. Besides, there is another high-class seafood restaurant opened beside me. Obviously, they want to steal my business.”

“Director Li, leave this to me. I’ll help you find one since I know the people from the fish market. Just leave it to me. The newly opened seafood restaurant will never surpass your First-grade Restaurant.”

Fishery? Fish farms? Wang Xian was slightly stunned when he eavesdropped on their conversation about the fishery. He pondered to himself.

He put down the rice bowl, took out his phone and began to search for Rivertown Fish Farms.

“Oh, there are fish farms over here, and they are nearby.” Wang Xian studied the information on his phone with a ray of sharp radiance flashing in his eyes.

He spun and looked at Director Li and that middle-aged man with his lips slightly drawn.

They quickly finished their meals and headed out.

Wang Xian stood up and followed them.

“Young man, I’m sorry.” When Wang Xian was at the door paying two bucks, the boss of the stall apologized to him.

“It’s okay.” Wang Xian gestured. When he saw Director Li and the middle-aged man get in the Audi Q7, he quickly asked, “Boss, do you know where the nearest fishery is?”

“Fishery?” The boss was slightly stunned as he pointed in a direction in front of them, “The fishery zones in the Rivertown can be found 700 to 800 meters ahead.”

“Oh, thank you!”

Wang Xian nodded as he beamed. The Audi was already gone in the direction that the boss had pointed out.

Wang Xian immediately followed in the same direction.

These two days, Wang Xian had never been there before as he always went out to the sea for hunting. Hence, he did not notice the fish farm.

Wang Xian sped up. True enough, he spotted Director Li’s car parked along the roadside at the turning point 1,000 meters away.

He walked over and spotted the fish farms with nets all over the sea.

However, there was a protruding spot not far from there.

That region extended out to the land with a surface area of 40 hectares which was equivalent to a mini inland sea.

However, the region was surrounded by purse seine and other materials so as to form the best geographical location for the fishery.

At this time, Director Li and the middle-aged man were standing at the shore, surrounded by a group of workers.

A few fishing boats were parked within the fishery. From a distance, he could vaguely see various types of fish.

“There are so many fish here.”

Wang Xian fixed his astonished eyes on the fishery.

“This is the fishery that belongs to that Director Li. According to what he said, there are 300,000 kilograms of fish over here.” 300,000 kilograms. That is enough for him to advance to the next level.

Wang Xian was thrilled, but a cold-looking expression surfaced on his face. With a swift movement, he headed to the sea at the back.

He found a remote spot to take off his clothes and entered the sea.

Transform into a dragon.

As he moved, the golden Divine Dragon of one meter long swished his dragon tail and headed swiftly to the location where the fisheries were.

“There are many fish varieties in each fishery.”

Wang Xian swam around and passed by many fisheries. But he did not enter to devour the fish.

The owners of these fisheries did not offend him. Wang Xian would not harm anyone else just to advance his levels.

He still had basic moral principles.

However, he would not spare that fishery of Director Li.

Soon, Wang Xian swam to the side of that fishery. Through the water, he could see Director Li and the middle-aged man on the shore.

“Eh? They actually used steel wire mesh.”

Wang Xian saw the row of steel wire mesh at the opening that prevented the fish from escaping.

Wang Xian chuckled softly. He stretched out his claws and slammed it hard on the mesh.

Kakaka!

Soon, the steel wire mesh was broken, and Wang Xian entered.

“Voila!”

Large Yellow Croaker: Level 0

Extractable Dragon Energy: 0.08

When he just entered the farm, he saw a Yellow Croaker of about 1 kilogram.

A smile surfaced on his face. As Wang Xian emanated his Dragon Power, the large Yellow Croaker shuddered and stayed still immediately.

At Level Two, his Dragon Power not only covered an area of 10 meters, but the marine animals within 10 meters, which were lower levels than him, would be oppressed and controlled by him.

At a size of one meter, Wang Xian opened his mouth and gulped down the fish.

The sea was about five to six meters deep. No one would discover Wang Xian at the bottom of the sea.

“Come, get some workers along with me to the sea and bring some fish up. When the partners from the two countries are here, we can also introduce the fish to them.”

Just then, Wang Xian seemed to hear Director Li’s voice. The sea water could not blur his vision as he looked up.

Director Li and the middle-aged man boarded a fishing boat, and one of the workers drove the boat to the center of the sea.

“Bring a few fish of different varieties up.” Director Li ordered the worker at the side.

“Yes, boss.” The worker nodded. He brought out a net and threw it into the fish farm casually.

Soon, dozens of bred fish like sea bass, Yellow Croaker, groupers and puffer fish were caught in the net. They were some of the goods from the fishery.

“Boss, the fish are good. I’m sure they can fetch a good price this year,” said the worker holding the fish.

“Good. Not bad. Haha,” Director Li laughed out. “When the people from the two countries are here, I’m sure our cooperation will be a breeze.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“I’m sure there will be no problem. After signing this contract, we can have our own supply channel. For the next few years, we will only earn big money.” The middle-aged man fawned over Director Li.

“Yes.” Director Li stood on the fishing boat and looked out at his fishery with excitement.

From now on, this place would be his Aladdin’s cave.
