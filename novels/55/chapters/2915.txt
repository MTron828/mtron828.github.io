Chapter 2916: asked for help from the Dragon Palace

“The Dragon Palace!”

Hearing the words of the fourth Supreme Elder, the others were also surprised.

“It’s good that you and Qingshan are fine. Let’s go to the meeting room to discuss the following matters.”

The leading elder said to them after glancing at the invincible battle technique.

“It’s the first Supreme Elder!”

The godly monarchs nodded.

“You and your senior sister stay here. These are the corpses of two godly monarchs. When you return to the Dragon Palace and give them to the Dragon King, it can be considered as a return for lending you so many treasures!”

Godly monarch Shangshui threw invincible battle technique an interspatial ring and then flew toward the center with the first Supreme Elder and the others.

“The corpses of godly monarch Yao Xie should be very useful to the Dragon Palace.”

Invincible battle technique took the interspatial ring and muttered as he put it away.

“Senior sister, senior sister, let me take a look at the scene you captured. I want to see how Brave I am!”

He said to second senior sister.

“Here, Here!”

Second senior sister speechlessly opened her AI and handed it to him.

“Hehe, wow, this is so cool. It’s so cool. He killed a rank one demonic god Emperor with a wave of his hand!”

Very soon, an exclamation from invincible battle technique came from the side.

At the side, the faces of a group of glazed soldiers turned black when they heard this.

This fellow’s brain was indeed abnormal.

“Everyone, which one of you doesn’t use an AI? Connect it to your glazed domain’s AI.”

Not long after, invincible battle technique suddenly asked the soldiers at the side.

“HMM? I have one here, I’ll give it to you!”

The expert in front hesitated for a moment, then took out a new AI from his interspatial ring and threw it to him.

Although they hated this guy at first, after he helped them solve the huge crisis, they were still very grateful.

Although this guy’s brain didn’t seem to be good.

“Thank you, thank you!”

Unparalleled combat technique took out the brain of the glazed domain and the corner of his mouth curled up.

“Wherever my unparalleled combat technique goes, I will definitely leave behind my legend!”

He muttered.

…

“This time, we have lost again. The number of casualties has exceeded 100 million.”

At the same time, in the meeting room at the center of the battle platform, 13 god Emperors were sitting inside.

At the center were three old men.

They were all at the second rank void God Emperor realm.

However, at this moment, their expressions were extremely ugly.

The retreat this time represented the territory of the glazed domain, which was occupied by Yao Xie.

Moreover, how long would they retreat until?

Where would they retreat to?

Currently, with their strength, they could not contend against the chimei territory’s monsters.

“What’s the situation over at the Machine Emperor Domain? If we gather all the god Emperors of our glazed domain, it shouldn’t be difficult to resist the chimei domain!”

God Emperor Shangshui said with a frown.

Not long after he returned, he encountered a crisis.

If he still relied on them, he might even die if he wasn’t careful.

It was too dangerous.

“The automaton race from the Machine Imperial region has accumulated a large number of space battleships and experts from the machine imperial region. Even the creator of the Machine Imperial region has appeared there before. The god Emperor from our glazed domain must act as a deterrent at the border!”

“Even our domain Lord does not dare to leave directly. Once the domain Lord leaves, if the creator leads the machine imperial region’s army to attack, the losses he will cause will be ten times greater than those from the Chimei region.”

The central grand supreme elder said with an awkward expression.

“If it wasn’t for those bastards from the mechanical imperial region, our glazed region wouldn’t be so passive!”

A God emperor slapped the table with anger.

“Then what do we do now? If we don’t send experts over, we won’t be able to hold them off!”

God Emperor Shangshui asked again with a grave expression.

“Our domain Lord wants to negotiate with the creator, I don’t know…”

A God emperor at the center said. At this moment, the AI on his body trembled.

“Oh?”

When he opened the AI and saw the information inside, his face sank.

“What’s Wrong?”

The Grand Supreme Elder and the others felt their hearts tighten and immediately asked.

“The Creator has appeared at the border. He wants us to take out 10,000 cubic meters of glazed double-colored stones and five pieces of glazed five-colored stones!”

“In addition, he wants another 100 billion tons of god Stones!”

The God Emperor in the center said with an abnormally ugly expression.

“What!”

“How is this possible!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“If we give so many glazed double-colored stones to their machine emperor domain, their machine emperor domain’s strength will be greatly increased. At that time, we will be completely supporting the enemy!”

The God emperors roared with an ugly expression.

“Our domain Lord did not agree. We can not agree to such conditions. Once they absorb these resources, they will be able to create an even more terrifying army. At that time, our VELURIYAM domain will not be their match.”

“And with the creator’s ambition and aggressiveness, not only will our veluriyam domain suffer, the entire resplendent starry sky will suffer!”

The God Emperor said with an embarrassed expression.

The mechs of the mechanical imperial region were the enemies of the humans. They used the human experts as research objects to create the bio-human army.

They used the resources in the human domain as motivation to create the space battleship.

If their glazed domain agreed this time, it wouldn’t be long before the mechanical imperial region could use these resources to invade their glazed domain.

Then, it would be a true disaster.

“According to our investigation, the center of the mechanical imperial region is mobilizing an even larger fleet and robot army to prepare an army to press the border!”

The god Emperor continued, his expression changing.

“Does the domain Lord have any instructions?”

The Grand Supreme Elder leaned on his chair and asked in a deep voice.

“There is one. Request for help from the other domains!”

The divine emperor said, “The domain Lord has already contacted the Holy Region. I wonder if the Holy Region has agreed.”

“Now, the seven regions of the starry sky and the eight desolates and six harmonies have been destroyed by the Dragon Palace. We don’t know where the people from the eight desolates have fled to. The Heaven’s punishment ancient Sky Region is in chaos. It’s impossible for them to come and help us. The holy region isn’t weak, but they don’t have many divine emperors. If the Holy Region agrees, we should be able to hold them off!”

“However, it will be different if the Dragon Palace is willing to help us.”

The first Supreme Elder said.

“Some people in the other domains have said that the dragon palace is more powerful than our Liuli. I don’t know if it’s true or not!”

A divine emperor said in puzzlement.

“Whether it’s true or not, the Dragon Palace has nine divine dragons and they can sweep through a domain. Their strength is definitely not weak. Moreover, the supreme treasure displayed by Qingshan’s disciple just now is enough to prove the strength of the Dragon Palace!”

The fourth supreme elder said.

“Qingshan, you’ve been to the Dragon Palace and have some understanding of the Dragon Palace. What’s their strength like?”

The first Supreme Elder asked the divine emperor of Shangshui.
