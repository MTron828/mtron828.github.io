“Second uncle!”

Di Xing nu looked at the middle-aged man in front of her in astonishment and shouted hurriedly!

The middle-aged man who suddenly appeared in front of Wang Xian and the rest had a head of silver hair. He looked a little cold and had a hint of a smile on the corner of his mouth!

The Way di Xing nu addressed him made Wang Xian look at the young man in front of him!

“Level five immortal king level strength!”

He thought to himself. With this strength and seniority, he could be considered one of the best in the imperial court!

“Di Xing Nu, right? Did you guys buy the immortal slaying gourd just now?”

The middle-aged man looked at di Xing nu and revealed a smile! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Second uncle, my friend bought it!”

Di Xing nu looked at her second uncle in surprise and said!

She only knew about this second uncle. He had only said three sentences, including the one just now!

“Oh? Ask your friend if you can part with him. I’ll buy him at the auction price!”

The middle-aged man said to Di Xingnu as he looked at Wang Xian who was at the side!

From his senses, Wang Xian’s aura was very young. As for his strength, he couldn’t sense it at the moment, which made him a little curious!

“Huh?”

Di Xingnu was stunned for a moment, and a troubled expression appeared on her face!

“Hao Fang, Haha, are you still unwilling to accept this?”

At this moment, a few middle-aged men flew over from behind and said to the middle-aged man with smiles on their faces!

“The war is about to start. We should at least get some people to protect our lives!”

The middle-aged man smiled faintly at the few people who flew over!

“How about this little brother? You are so young, and you don’t need the immortal slaying gourd. If you agree, I can give you some pointers. Of course, I can also find a stronger person to give you some pointers!”

The middle-aged man landed on Wang Xian and asked indifferently!

“I’m Sorry!”

Wang Xian shook his head lightly!

“Huh?”

The middle-aged man frowned slightly and looked at di Xing who was beside him!

“With your strength, you won’t be able to use it. This little brother should have some background. Let’s form a good relationship!”

He pondered for a moment and continued to speak!

He had been longing for the immortal-slaying calabash for a long time after learning about it!

He had obtained a great opportunity and possessed a huge amount of divine stones. Such a powerful trump card would definitely increase his strength by a lot!

Wang Xian looked at him and shook his head lightly!

“Hehe, you’re still a little young. Little Brother, you shouldn’t be a disciple of the imperial court. Hao Fang, I think you should look for the elders in his family to make a deal!”

The middle-aged man beside him smiled when he saw this scene and patted the middle-aged man’s shoulder!

The silver-haired middle-aged man looked at Wang Xian coldly and nodded his head!

As for threatening him here, he didn’t dare to do so. The imperial court had its own rules!

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian looked at his cold expression and smiled mockingly!

“Let’s Go!”

The silver-haired middle-aged man took a deep look at Wang Xian and said to his companion beside him!

“Di Haofang!”

However, at this moment, an extremely cold voice rang out!

“Who is it?”

When di Haofang heard this voice, he immediately frowned and looked over!

When Wang Xian heard this voice, he suddenly felt that it was extremely familiar!

He raised his head and saw an extremely familiar figure!

Bei Shuang!

“Eh? Sister bei Shuang knows my second uncle?”

Di Xingnu looked over and revealed an astonished expression!

Wang Xian stood there and looked over with a twinkle in his eyes!

Around him, some people were also attracted by this cold voice. They looked over in puzzlement!

“Bei Shuang, you...”

When di Haofang saw bei Shuang’s cold gaze, his expression instantly turned ugly!

“It’s time to pay back the humiliation from 30,000 years ago!”

...

“These few days, you’re really good at hiding!”

Bei Shuang’s sinister gaze locked onto him as she spoke with a face full of killing intent!

“Bei Shuang, 30,000 years ago, I merely let someone teach you a lesson. To think that such a stingy person would actually remember you for 30,000 years!”

“Hehe, not long ago, I also heard that you obtained a cultivation method. Congratulations!”

Di Hao Fang’s expression was somewhat unsightly as he spoke in a deep voice!

“Hehe, then you can treat me as that stingy person!”

Bei Shuang sneered. In the next moment, she moved!

A sparring formation instantly enveloped di Haofang!

Following that, before di Haofang could even react, bei Shuang instantly rushed in front of him!

“Don’t worry, I understand the rules of your imperial court. 30,000 years ago, you, the dignified imperial prince, was suppressed by me. At that time, you even wanted to propose marriage to my bei Chuan sect. Hehe, after I didn’t agree, later on, when I was lonely, you found someone to humiliate me. The dignified imperial prince’s magnanimity isn’t even comparable to a woman like me!”

Bei Shuang grabbed his neck with a frost claw, causing him to be unable to move at all!

...

“Pu!”

As soon as she finished speaking, the sharp claw instantly pierced through his shoulder!

“AH, bei Shuang, you... You Better Stop!”

An intense pain appeared on di Hao Fang’s face as he couldn’t help but growl in a low voice!

“Hehe? Stop?”

Bei Shuang’s gaze was cold as her frost claw directly grabbed towards one of his arms!

“Pu!”

In the next moment, she used her powerful strength to tear it apart!

“Ah!”

A painful scream sounded!

“Ah, Elder, save me!”

Di Hao Fang’s eyes revealed a look of terror as he shouted with a panicked expression!

There was no trace of the cool and cool demeanor from before!

“It’s just a spar. We are from the same era, I Won’t harm your life. Why, do I have to rely on your background again?”

Bei Shuang stared at him with disdain and waved her frost claw once again!

“Pu!”

“Ah!”

Another scream sounded and a large amount of blood flowed out from his body!

Di Hao Fang’s expression was extremely ugly!

“I was able to suppress him 30,000 years ago, but I can easily suppress him now!”

Bei Shuang stared at him coldly!

“Alright, that’s Enough!”

The sudden eruption of the sparring caused everyone to be slightly stunned. Everyone turned to look in their direction, filled with astonishment!

When they saw di Hao Fang being abused, many of them were even more shocked!

Their mouths were slightly agape!

Di Hao Fang was also a celebrity in the imperial court. He was the emperor’s son from more than 30,000 years ago, and his strength now far surpassed that of his generation!

And now, he was actually being abused by a woman!

An elder swept a glance, and his eyes flickered slightly as he spoke softly!

“Trash!”

Bei Shuang heard the voice of an elder from the imperial court below, and coldly spat out two words at Di Haofang!

“Ka Ka Ka!”

In the next moment, the frost claw that was grabbing onto di Haofang extended towards his chest!

It formed two large words!

Trash!

Especially when those two words were emitting a frosty light, it was exceptionally eye-catching!

Seeing this scene, everyone was slightly stunned, and some of them could not help but laugh out loud!

“Weng!”

Bei Shuang waved his arm and withdrew the sparring formation!

“AH, bei Shuang, you’re courting death!”

When di Hao Fang saw the two large words on his chest, he felt his mind go blank as he roared out in a stern voice!

“Useless trash who only knows how to bark!”

Bei Shuang waved her arm and a force landed on his chest!

Di Haofang’s expression changed drastically. His figure immediately retreated!

“Haofang!”

Beside him, Di Haofang and a few others frowned slightly. They instantly appeared behind him and caught him!

“HMPH!”

Bei Shuang snorted softly and turned around, wanting to leave!

However, at this moment, her body paused as she noticed Wang Xian!

“Master!”
