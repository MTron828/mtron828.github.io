Translator: 5496903

“Bang!”

A loud sound was heard.

How did it feel to fall from a height of five to six thousand meters?

Perhaps some people didn’t know, but Wang Xian could fully experience it now.

At this moment, Wang Xian felt as though his entire body was crippled. His body was in extreme pain.

The attacks from the few thunderfish nearly killed him.

Fortunately, he had the body of a divine dragon. Furthermore, the lightning wood in his hand had managed to heal Wang Xian’s body with its immense vitality. That was why he didn’t die.

However, even so, after he reverted to his human form, the Azure Dragon’s energy had become stronger and covered the important parts of his body.

The other parts of his body were filled with wounds.

All of them were torn apart by the lightning. They were densely packed and looked extremely terrifying.

Compared to these external injuries, the internal injuries were also very serious. After being thrown, they were even more serious.

However, fortunately, he felt as if he had landed on a soft spot.

At this moment, the lightning fish was directly smashed on its head. It was a little stunned.

Qin Qing, who was only two to three meters away from the Lightning Fish’s huge mouth, was even more stunned.

She thought that she was going to be swallowed by the lightning fish in one gulp. However, she did not expect that a person would descend from the sky and directly smash onto the Lightning Fish’s head. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Xiao Qing, run!”

The few companions around were also a little stunned. However, they immediately reacted and shouted at Qin Qing.

Qin Qing reacted and hurriedly retreated.

“COO COO!”

The thunderfish gradually regained consciousness and let out a low roar.

Wang Xian also regained consciousness. When he heard this voice, a hint of killing intent flashed in his eyes.

It was all because of this D * mn thunderfish that nearly killed him.

In the end, at this moment, the thunderfish beneath him moved.

Wang Xian immediately realized that he seemed to have landed on a thunderfish.

Gritting his teeth, he moved the Thunderstrike Wood in his hand. The thunderstrike wood immediately lengthened and pierced into the head of the thunderfish in an instant.

The Thunderstrike Wood, which was accompanied by lightning, caused the thunderfish’s body to tremble. Then, it laid on the ground without moving.

“He... He died from the impact?”

Qin Qing and the other girls were completely stunned when they saw this scene.

F * ck, the thunderfish that they were attacking was actually killed by a person who fell from the sky.

This... this...

“Who... who is this? Is He still alive?”

One of the girls widened her eyes and couldn’t help but ask.

Wang Xian heaved a sigh of relief. He laid on the corpse of the thunderfish and looked to the side.

He heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that he was in the middle of a group of people fighting against the thunderfish.

His body trembled slightly as he used the thunderstruck wood to support his body. He struggled to stand up.

“Cough Cough!”

He couldn’t help but cough. Drops of blood flowed out from his mouth!

“He... he...”

However, Qin Qing and the other three girls, who had been paying attention to Wang Xian, were stunned when they saw him standing up.

“This... that new student... It’s actually him!”

They looked at Wang Xian who was in an extremely miserable state and were filled with astonishment.

That arrogant fellow actually descended from the sky and even smashed the thunderfish to death, saving Qin Qing’s life.

This...

“Quick, return to the formation. We are not a match for this group of ferocious beasts. Quickly hide in the formation to block them!”

At this moment, deputy commander Xiao’s voice suddenly came from the side.

At this moment, her face was in an extremely sorry state. There was a black scar on her arm. It was left behind by a thunderfish during the battle just now.

The three of them were transcendent-level rank six experts, along with five transcendent-level rank five experts. They were able to pin down five transcendent-level rank six thunderfish.

However, they only managed to hold on for two minutes.

If the battle continued, they would definitely be annihilated!

“Quick, get into the formation!”

The anxious voices of the members of the amethyst mercenary group could be heard from the side.

Qin Qing and the other girls took a glance at Wang Xian before they hurriedly fled towards the formation.

“Get into the formation!”

Perhaps it was Wang Xian who saved her life, Qin Qing turned around and shouted at Wang Xian while she was fleeing.

However, a transcendent level five girl who was flying over immediately brought her into the formation.

“Activate!”

Deputy Chief Xiao saw the group of members entering the formation and shouted hurriedly.

Buzz

A water-blue formation rose up and formed a protective barrier with a radius of 100 meters. It protected all of them inside.

Bang

A rank 6 transcendent lightning fish that was chasing after them crashed heavily into the array formation.

“Boom!”

The array formation trembled violently. Clearly, the highest level of the array formation was rank 6 transcendent!

“Crackle crackle!”

A lightning fish released powerful lightning strikes that landed on the array formation, causing it to tremble once again.

“Peng Peng Peng!”

The group of lightning fish saw that all of them were hiding within the array formation, so they flew over and gathered in front of them.

A few thunderfish collided violently.

“Injured members, take your pills immediately. The transcendent level 6 array formation won’t be able to hold on for long. If the other students from the academy come over, we’ll be in trouble!”

When deputy commander Xiao saw that some of the thunderfish were gathering in front of them and attacking nonstop, his expression was extremely solemn as he said in a low voice.

“Sister Yuan and sister Liang are injured!”

“What should we do? Why aren’t they here yet? If they don’t come...”

“We’re completely no match for these ferocious beasts. I hope the array can hold on a little longer!”

The girls from the amethyst mercenary group said in a flustered manner.

Their faces were filled with worry.

“Deputy commander, that new student is that new student!”

At this moment, Qin Qing and the two girls called out to deputy leader Xiao. They widened their eyes and pointed outside the array formation.

“Huh? What’s going on?”

Deputy leader Xiao frowned and looked at them.

“It’s that new student. He suddenly fell from the sky. If he didn’t hit the thunderfish, Xiao Qing might be in danger!”

One of the girls pointed outside and said with a strange and anxious expression.

“Eh?”

Deputy Captain Xiao was slightly taken aback. A look of astonishment appeared on her face as she looked in the direction they were pointing at.

The members of the amethyst mercenary group around also turned their heads.

In an instant, when they saw that extremely miserable figure, a look of astonishment appeared on their faces.

“It’s him, the new Wang Xian. That arrogant fellow!”

“Why is he here? What’s Going On?”

“The wounds on his body are so serious. It feels like half of him is about to die. It’s over. Lei Yu found him. He’s going to die soon!”

The female students of the amethyst mercenary group, Wang Xian, widened their eyes and exclaimed in astonishment.

At this moment, the arrogant fellow in their hearts had wounds all over his body. He was holding a wooden stick in his hand. He was as miserable as he could be!

“He fell from the sky. He must have received some kind of attack and landed beside us!”

A girl quickly said to deputy chief Xiao.

“This...”

Deputy Chief Xiao frowned. He looked at Wang Xian who was standing there supporting his body as though he could fall at any moment. He shook his head slowly.

She looked at the group of thunderfish in front of her and said, “He has been seen by the thunderfish. He is doomed!”

The group of girls from the amethyst mercenary group looked over. As expected, two thunderfish saw him and were crawling towards him slowly.

Wang Xian also saw two extraordinary level five thunderfish walking towards him. It was obvious that they wanted to eat him up.

“You are courting death!”

He raised his head and his eyes were filled with calmness!
