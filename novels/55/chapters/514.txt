Chapter 515: Lord Ossein

Caw, caw, caw!

Up in the sky, thousands of Cadaveric Crows descended on the area below in one clean sweep when they saw Wang Xian and the Dragonians lunging at the Remains disciples.

Their screeching caws pierced through the skies while they emitted bloodthirst as they swarmed like thousands of fowls out to kill.

Wang Xian swung his arm, and a gigantic skull appeared as it stared down at the crows.

Ack, ack!

As if cackling in a grimace, the Nether Skull gave off a chuckle and shook lightly.

Boom!

Following the blast, a terrifying surge of Nether Flames soared past, concealing the area within more than a thousand meter radius.

Settling like dust, the surrounding trees fell to the ground.

The Cadaveric Crows in the air, which measured two meters in length, had been bursting out in laughter earlier on. Yet, they looked on and stared at the Nether Skull in trepidation.

“Kill!” the Nether Skull commanded as if speaking in a human tone, opening its mouth before gnawing straight at the giant Cadaveric Crows.

Caw, caw, caw!

The broken voice of the Nether Skull continued to ring through the air as the giant Cadaveric Crow stood defenseless with no chance to retaliate. With every Cadaveric Crow it devoured, the Nether Flame on the Nether Skull glowed a little brighter.

“Running away, but can you?” Wang Xian asked as he extended his arm, at the sight of the hunchback Elder trying to escape.

An Inferno Wall appeared instantly in front of the Elder causing him to lose color in the face.

“Be gone, die!” Mo Yuan snarled from the back as his threatening Dragon Claws lashed at the head of the hunchbacked Elder.

“Trying to kill me huh. I’ll slaughter you first!”

The hunchback Elder grimaced before turning his body around. With his Bone Dagger in hand, he aimed the scarlet weapon straight at Mo Yuan’s chest while paying no heed to Mo Yuan’s Dragon Claws.

“Hmph!”

Mo Yuan remained unfazed while numerous streaks of black Dragon Scales began to form on his chest area.

“Be gone, die!”

“Off you go to hell!”

The duo hollered at the same time. Thereafter, the maiden skin plastered on the hunchback Elder began to split, revealing the hideous figure beneath.

“How dare you ruin my skin. Off to hell you go!” the hunchback Elder snapped with a grimace.

With a grisly snarl, the hunchback Elder took aim with the Bone Dagger in his hand and stabbed forcefully into Mo Yuan’s chest.

Tsk!

The Bone Dagger plunged into Mo Yuan’s body, to which he reacted with a small facial twitch.

Yet, disbelief soon settled across the face of the hunchbacked Elder.

Creak, creak!

With a slight maneuver of his arm, Mo Yuan grabbed onto the arms of the Elder, before tearing away at the latter’s head using his Dragon Claws.

“Ah! How’s this possible? How can your body be tougher than Bone puppets!?” the hunchback Elder roared at Mo Yuan while looking on in disbelief. Following which, a gigantic Dragon Claw clasped tightly onto his head.

This blew the head of the Elder right off, like an exploded watermelon.

“There’s been an intruder. There’s been an intruder!”

Ring, ring, ring! Ring, ring, ring! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

At that instant, shrieking cries could be heard from the Remains Village located just up ahead.

This was immediately followed by a series of piercing rings of bells.

Caw, caw, caw!

Every ring of the bells resonated like a Soul-stabilizing Voice. Even the surrounding trees began to follow its lead, creaking gently as they swayed along.

Up above in the skies, the cawing of the Cadaveric Crows could be heard. Under the pristine moonlight, countless Cadaveric Crows could be seen flying over.

The lights shone brightly from the small village up ahead. One by one, numerous members from the Remains began to make their way out. With bells in their hands, they looked coldly in the direction of Wang Xian.

“There are so many of them!” Wang Xian exclaimed as he looked ahead with narrowed eyes. The entire village contained close to ten thousand villagers.

This included the young and elderly, and each and every one looked on with a grim and ghastly expression.

Many of the little children were each hugging onto a skull.

Some were human skulls while others belonged to beasts.

“They’re trespassers from the Dragon Sect. Kill them!” an Inborn expert of the Remains shouted after being struck heavily by the Dragonians. In reaction to the harsh attack, he resorted to the stance of “Golden Cicada sheds its shell” in order to make his escape, leaving behind a sheet of human skin.

At the sight of this gory Remains’ base, Wang Xian’s body began to light up in flames.

“Those from the Remains shouldn’t be left to exist!”

With a change of stance, Wang Xian soared and ascended into the skies as he ejected a Dragon Ball from his mouth.

Roar!

With his Dragon Roar, the Inferno Divine Dragon was summoned from the Dragon Ball and was at Wang Xian’s disposal before it dived into the skies and lashed the Cadaveric Crows.

The Level 11 Dragon Ball was already capable of unleashing powers equivalent to those of a Dan Realm expert. With one sweep of the Dragon Tail, the Inferno Divine Dragon wiped out hundreds of Cadaveric Crows using its flames and terrifying prowess.

Ring, ring, ring!

“Kill that fellow in the sky!”

A screeching voice could be heard. It came from a chubby old lady who shouted while holding a human bone staff in her hand.

At the same time, with a ring of bells on her other hand, she summoned four other members from the Remains who proceeded to charge at Wang Xian.

Amongst the quartet were two beasts, one of which was a giant bear and the other a goshawk, while the remaining two were Elders.

Together, these four Inborn experts from the Remains emerged with an overwhelming bloodthirst and savageness.

Wang Xian looked across and saw close to ten thousand disciples of the Remains standing in front of the village.

A little more than fifty from the Remains dashed ahead for Wang Xian and gang.

They included more than a dozen who were charging straight for Wang Xian. Their bodies were seven to eight times stronger than their counterparts of equivalent grades. Their highly resistant bodies alone were enough to instill fear in an Inborn Expert, even if they should possess no other unique combat techniques.

Similar to zombies, they feared neither pain nor death.

“No doubt the four main Devil Sects. Within the Remains alone are more than thirty Inborn experts. Along with the Bone Puppets that they produce, that’ll peak at close to eighty!”

Wang Xian extended his arms at the sight of the Remains members who were charging in his direction.

Crack, crack, crack!

Suddenly, the fire surrounding Wang Xian began to burst into wider flames, as little specks of fire appeared in void air.

“Dan Realm experts!” hollered a chubby elderly lady who stood amidst the Remains disciples. “One Dan Realm expert, and twenty-seven Inborn experts!” She continued in grimace.

“The Dragon Sect, huh. Good. Today, you all shall remain here!” said the chubby granny.

Thereafter, she threw the human bone staff in her hand over to the middle of the village, aiming straight into the building which resembled a ritual hall.

“May I call upon Lord Ossein to slay these tough opponents!”

“The battle between Good and Evil has yet to begin. To think...someone has already barged into the grounds of ours? The grounds of the Remains?” a calm and leveled voice questioned.

“Lord Ossein,” all disciples of the Remains greeted immediately, as they knelt in the direction of the ritual hall.

“Lord Ossein?” Wang Xian asked with a raised brow. Following the greeting, the surrounding mid-air flames grew stronger before the specks coagulated into a collective Flaming Rope. With much ease, the Flaming Rope tied the respective Inborn Experts from the Remains together.

Bam!

With a swing of his arm, Wang Xian dumped the Remains over to the center of the village.

“Dragon King of the Dragon Sect. I know you!”

A bone tentacle shot out from within the ritual hall before it swung at the various Remains.

“A freak who’s neither human nor spirit!”

Wang Xian gasped with a squinted look as he stared ahead. With an indifferent expression, he could see a tentacle which stretched more than a dozen meters in length, and a skeleton which reached up to ten meters. It resembled a snake’s body and had a head attached to its rear.

It was the head of an Elder.

Gradually, another snake-like tentacle extended itself slowly into the open.

As with the previous, this skeletal tentacle also had a head at its tail.

Yet, this was not the end, as more and more skeletal tentacles began to emerge.

Finally, a youth appeared. He had exceptional visuals, although he was without legs.

On his lower body, ten snake-like tentacles supported his weight, where each of the ten measured more than a dozen meters long!
