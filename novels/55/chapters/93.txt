“Uncle, please let Manager Huang keep your stuff in the office while we have our meal.”

On the other side, Wang Xian smiled and spoke to the middle-aged man who was still in shock.

“Hey, son...thank you. You are a really nice person,” the middle-aged man recovered and replied. His eyes were a little red from the incident.

“It’s just a small matter. It’s fate that brought us together.” Wang Xian smiled at the middle-aged man. “Let’s go and find a seat.”

With regard to this simple middle-aged man, Wang Xian was fond of him.

He still remembered vividly that while living with his sister and grandmother, there was a middle-aged man called “Uncle Zhang” who took great care of them.

Uncle Zhang was a very nice guy and had been very caring towards him. He also had an honest smile at all times and was passionate about everyone around him.

During the harvesting season, Uncle Zhang would always help them, as he knew that Wang Xian’s grandmother couldn’t take the toll.

After their grandmother passed away, it was also Uncle Zhang who helped them with the funeral matters. He had even spent a lot of money because of that.

I wonder how Uncle Zhang is right now? I should return and repay him for what he has done for me, Wang Xian thought to himself.

The middle-aged man in front of him right now was polite, followed the rules and was similar to Uncle Zhang. A look at him and one could tell that he was a great person.

“I really hadn’t expected you to be the boss of this restaurant. Incredible! Really incredible! To be so outstanding at such a young age!”

Su Qian’s parents were shocked and their eyes lit up while complimenting Wang Xian.

“I’m just lucky.”

Wang Xian smiled. “Come, let us all take a seat. Let’s forget about the unhappy events. As for the girl with a poor upbringing, just ignore her in the future. It will be fine as long as the three of you get along well.”

“Yeah, yeah.” Su Qian and Yuan Yuanyuan nodded their heads while looking at him with eyes of worship.

Handsome and righteous! This is the type of guy that every young girl would fall in love with.

“Yuanyuan, remember to get along with them. These two girls are great friends to have.” the middle-aged man said emotionally while caressing his daughter’s head.

“I know it, dad. Rest assured and don’t worry about me!” Yuan Yuanyuan was sensible and cared a lot about her father.

Wang Xian smiled and said, “If you encounter any issues in school or Rivertown in the future, feel free to look for me.”

“Thank you, son.”

“Thank you, brother. Thank you very much.”

The middle-aged man and Su Qian’s parents immediately thanked him.

“It’s a small matter. We are all from the same school after all!” Wang Xian waved his hand and the seven of them walked to a table.

“Young Master Wang!”

At this moment, a young man walked over suddenly and greeted Wang Xian.

“Hmm? You are?” Wang Xian looked at the young man who had appeared suddenly.

“Young Master Wang, we met once at the banquet of Old Qin. Perhaps Young Master Wang doesn’t remember me.”

This person was none other than Director Sun, as he said respectfully.

“Oh, I’m sorry about it.” Wang Xian smiled apologetically but still had doubts about his intentions.

“Young Master Wang, this is what happened,” Director Sun said immediately. “I bumped into Zhao Jingshan and he told me something.”

Director Sun saw the doubtful eyes of Wang Xian and quickly clarified, “Zhao Jingshan is the slightly plump middle-aged man. I just bumped into him and his family at the entrance.”

“Hmm? You know them?” Wang Xian frowned.

“I’m not close to him, not even close!” Director Sun explained immediately. “Zhao Jingshan is a construction material supplier under Qin Family’s Property Company. I’m a manager of the company and am capable of some things. He wanted me to cause you some trouble when I bumped into him at the entrance a while ago. Such a despicable person has to be punished!”

“Young Master Wang, I suggest that I let the company stop working with him. Moreover, I’ll ask all the developers in Rivertown to not work with him. What do you think of this?” Director Sun asked.

“Mm, I leave this to you,” Wang Xian nodded and said to Director Sun. “Thank you.”

“Young Master Wang, you are too courteous. It’s just a small matter. In that case, I shall not take up any more of your time,” Director Sun replied immediately with a smile.

“Wait a minute. That... How do I address you?” An idea struck Wang Xian as he stopped Director Sun.

“Young Master Wang, you can just call me Xiao Sun!” When Director Sun heard Wang Xian stop him, he was thrilled.

“I’ll just call you Director Sun. Director Sun, I have something to trouble you with.” Wang Xian looked at him and smiled. “This is the father of my sister’s classmate. He is currently working at a construction site. Help me keep a lookout if there are any suitable jobs for him.”

“Work?” Director Sun was taken aback. Following which, excitement flashed in his eyes. “Yes, there is, Young Master Wang. We are looking for a Security Department head and there are also many vacant slots in the Quality Inspection Department, which is recruiting. The salary isn’t particularly high but is still around several tens of thousands a month,” Director Sun remarked. He turned to the middle-aged man and said enthusiastically, “Brother, come look for me! This is my name card, and can I get your number? I’ll give you a call after lunch. At that time, I’ll bring you over.”

The middle-aged man was stunned. Looking at this well-dressed young man, he was at a loss as to what to do.

Although the middle-aged man was from the village, he wasn’t silly.

He could roughly deduce the ability of this young man in front of him.

The parents of the girl a while ago were just a small partner of his and they were already doing so well. Currently, this even more incredible person was being so enthusiastic to him. This had completely thrown him off.

“This... Director Sun...” The middle-aged man stood up immediately. He looked at Wang Xian and waved his hand constantly. “Hey son, this wouldn’t do. I know what I’m capable of. It’s alright if you want me to do some menial work. As for others, I wouldn’t be able to do it!”

“It’s alright, uncle. You can learn while doing. If you really can’t, you are free to switch to a more ordinary job.” Wang Xian stood up and patted the shoulder of the middle-aged man. He looked to Director Sun and said, “Director Sun, take down my number. If there’s anything, you can call me directly. I’ll contact you directly with regard to this uncle in the future.”

“Sure, sure.” Director Sun nodded his head gladly and took out his phone.

“Alright, let’s talk again after lunch.” Wang Xian nodded at Director Sun.

“Sure, sure. In that case, Young Master Wang, have your lunch first. We are going for lunch too.” Director Sun nodded his head and smiled.

Looking at the shocked look on the middle-aged man, he added, “Uncle, take a seat. It’s just a small matter.”

“Sigh. Son, you are truly a great guy. Really! Thank you! I have to thank you!” The middle-aged man was so moved that he became incoherent.

“It’s really a small matter. Uncle, you are a great guy and I was just helping you within my means.”

Wang Xian shook his head and continued, “Let’s eat, let’s eat. If you all are free in the future, ask Xiao Yu to bring you over. Don’t stand on ceremony.”

“Thank you, senior,” Yuan Yuanyuan replied gratefully.

“You’re welcome. We are roommates and will be living together for four years. This is just a small matter!”

Xiao Yu held on to Yuan Yuanyuan’s arm and chuckled.

Su Qian’s parents, who were sitting at the other end, looked at the young man in shock.

Without having to do anything, there were people coming over to help eradicate that cocky family.

With just a request, he could give the middle-aged man a job that many others desired.

They were convinced that they should ask their daughter to be good friends with his sister.
