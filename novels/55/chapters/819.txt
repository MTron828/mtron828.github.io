Chapter 820: 0821 Battle of dragons and snakes 2

Translator: 549690339

“No wonder ao crab said that the Hydra is cunning, wise, and cunning. Just the layers of defense in this sea of snakes can tell the wisdom of the Hydra!”

“The Hydra must have discovered our arrival by now!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. He looked inside with his penetrating eye.

The thick poison blocked his vision. He could only vaguely see the mountains inside.

Inside the mountain peak, there were poisonous snakes living inside. Wang Xian even saw more than ten Titan Pythons that were more than 20 meters long.

Prehistoric creatures, Titan Pythons.

“Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!”

At this moment, Wang Xian vaguely heard the sound of the tongues of snakes from inside. An incomparably huge snake swam out from a mountain peak.

“One head, two heads... five heads, a total of five heads!”

A hint of surprise flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes. In his blurry vision, numerous huge snakes were gathered around the five-headed snake.

“This should be the five-headed snake that Ao Yao and the rest have detected. It has the strength of a middle-level immortal!”

“Are there some lower-level immortals other than the nine-headed snake and the five-headed snake?”

Wang Xian was a little uncertain. This sea of snakes was not simple. If there were only two immortal-level creatures, he would not dare to believe it.

“They are ambushing us!”

Wang Xian could not help but sigh at their wisdom when he saw the huge poisonous snakes entering the soil.

“However, these toxins and ambushes are useless to us!”

Wang Xian revealed a cold smile and stood up. “Enter the area. Prime Minister Gui, seal the ground directly. Ao Qi, attack the ground with lightning!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui, Ao Qi, and the rest nodded their heads.

After entering the poison zone, the poison in the area wasn’t too harmful to them.

“Attack!”

Wang Xian shouted coldly. Prime Minister Gui’s turtle shell was covered in a burst of earthy yellow light. The light spread to the front at a speed visible to the naked eye. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The entire ground was as solid as steel.

Crack! Crack

In an instant, three thunder hammers landed heavily on the ground. The terrifying thunder and lightning penetrated the ground.

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the area. Seventy to eighty infant stage creatures were killed by the Thunder and lightning.

“Damn it! who dares to trespass into our Lord Ba Qi’s territory? !”

The sudden attack caused the five-headed snake that was entrenched on the mountain peak not far away to reveal a look of shock. It roared loudly.

“Eh? The human language, the Japanese language? The eight-headed snake?”

Wang Xian revealed a look of surprise as he stared at the five-headed snake. “I am the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. I want the eight-headed snake to come out and submit to me!”

“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace? You are the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace in China?”

The five heads of the five-headed snake were exactly the same. A human-like shock could be seen in their blood-red, cold eyes.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian was even more surprised. This undersea creature actually knew his name.

“The eight-headed snake is the mythical beast of the island nation. Not only does this five-headed snake know the human language, but it also knows its own name. In other words, it interacts with humans!”

“A creature from the sea interacts with humans. This is really unexpected!”

Wang Xian was thinking about the myths and legends about the island nation.

The eight-limbed snake was rumored to have eight heads and eight tails. However, there were clearly nine heads here.

It should be the evolution of the eight-limbed snake and the addition of an extra head.

The eight-limbed snake in the myths could change the color of the world. Presumably, the current eight-limbed snake would be even more terrifying. It should not be something an ordinary superior immortal could deal with!

“Call your master eight-limbed snake over!”

Wang Xian looked at the five-headed snake and said coldly to it.

This five-headed snake only had a huge tail. Its entire body was about 50 meters long, and each of its head was 20 meters long.

“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, what are you doing trespassing my eight-limbed snake territory?”

When Wang Xian had just finished speaking, a head with two to three meters long blood-red pupils extended out from a huge mountain peak five kilometers in front of him. It stared at Wang Xian coldly.

The head that was revealed was about seven to eight meters in size. One could imagine that this eight-limbed snake was about a hundred meters in size.

“The language of China?”

Upon hearing his words, Wang Xian was shocked again. “You actually know the language of China and even know that I am the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!”

“Haha, I Am the God of the eight-limbed snake, the supreme God. I naturally know about the Dragon King!”

The terrifying head scanned the surroundings of Wang Xian. He closed his eyes and heaved a sigh of relief.

“The eight-limbed great god, the supreme God!”

When Wang Xian heard the words of the eight-limbed great snake, he thought of the gods in the west.

Different from the gods of the immortal sects in Huaxia, the powerhouses in the west liked to deify themselves. They claimed that they were omnipotent and established a divine sect to develop believers.

Other than the descendants of the gods, the rest were all disciples and servants of the gods. They served the gods for generations.

The hierarchy was strict!

This eight-limbed snake was obviously imitating the western powerhouses. It proclaimed itself as a god, established a divine sect, and had divine servants.

There should be some believers in the island nation.

Wang Xian stared at the eight-limbed snake with a solemn expression.

This was an extremely intelligent and powerful undersea creature. Furthermore, it had its own power.

This was the first non-human creature that Wang Xian had encountered that was filled with intelligence.

“Since you know about me, you should submit obediently!”

Wang Xian flew up from the Dragon Throne and transformed into the body of a divine dragon. He stared at the eight-headed Hydra coldly.

“Dragon King, I am the Supreme God. Is it possible for me to submit to you? “I, Ba Qi, have lived for more than two thousand years. I have witnessed the vicissitudes of history and the rise and fall of our country. It is impossible for me to submit to you. Furthermore, you do not have the qualifications to make me submit to you. Dragon King, I advise you to leave this place!”

A hint of viciousness flashed across the eyes of the Ba Qi Serpent as it roared in a deep voice.

“Since I am here, how can I leave this place so easily? All the water tribes in the world are my subjects. All the water domains in the world are the domain of the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian revealed a dignified and domineering expression as he stared at the eight-headed Hydra coldly.

How could he leave? Even if this eight-headed Hydra was as intelligent as a demon, even if its strength had reached the level of a superior immortal.

Wang Xian was still unafraid. With the strength of the Dragon Palace, it was more than enough to subdue and even destroy the eight-headed hydra.

Wang Xian was not sure if his current force was invincible in the entire earth. However, he was still confident that he could be one of the best.

“Dragon King, I, the eight-limbed snake, am not someone to be trifled with!”

Boom! Boom! Boom

The eight-limbed snake let out an angry roar when it heard Wang Xian’s words. In an instant, heads shot into the Sky One by one.

The nine heads were 50 meters long from the top of the thousand-meter-tall mountain.

Flames. Black Flames emerged from its mouth. Black Flames were dancing in its blood-red eyes.

This is demonic flame, magic attribute!
