Translator: 549690339

Boom! Boom

The 10,000-meter-long spatial sword brought with it a terrifying might as it attacked Yi Ya.

Yi Ya felt the might of the huge sword, and her calm expression finally began to change drastically.

From the 10,000-meter-long sword, she felt a threat of death!

This caused her expression to freeze, and her charging figure immediately stopped. Numerous sharp swords met the 10,000-meter-long sword.

At the same time, her figure flashed, and she directly teleported backwards.

The power of the 10,000-meter-long swords losing control decreased by a lot!

The 10,000-meter-long sword slashed down, directly causing the 10,000-meter-long swords to collapse!

The 10,000-meter-long sword broke through Yi Ya’s attack, and it still attacked her at a terrifying speed.

Yi Ya’s expression was incomparably cold when she saw this. She waved her arm, and numerous sword shadows smashed onto it.

The sharp sword that was 10,000 meters long started to crumble slowly.

“That’s it?”

“Kill me in one move?”

Wang Xian looked at Yi Ya who was in front of him and asked indifferently. A hint of mockery appeared on his face.

This lady wasn’t very capable but she was rather arrogant and arrogant.

Kill me in one move?

When Yi Ya heard Wang Xian’s words and saw his mocking expression, she looked extremely embarrassed.

What she said just now was a blatant slap in the face.

“What? Goddess Yi Ya was actually suppressed? How is this possible?”

“No Way. That Wang Xian, who is only at level nine of the eternal swordsman realm, actually made Yi Ya Retreat?”

“Hiss, what’s going on? What kind of sword technique did that young man use? It seems to be very powerful! ”

At the same time, all the students from the Songyi Saint Academy who were watching the battle were shocked by this scene.

Everyone thought that this was an easy battle between goddess Yi Ya.

However, they didn’t expect that not only did they not suppress the other party, they were even pushed back by the other party. This was simply unbelievable!

The teachers from the Songyi Saint Academy looked at Wang Xian’s sword technique with astonishment on their faces.

It was very, very difficult for a person of the same attribute to fight against someone of a higher level.

Especially against someone of the same level like Yi Ya.

“This sword technique?”

The space saint, Wu Qitian, stared at him and adjusted his brows slightly.

“You have completely infuriated me. I want to show you my sword technique, Void Annihilation Sword! ”

Yi Ya stared at Wang Xian with a cold expression. Her eyes revealed a stern look.

He moved his palm and waved the sharp sword in his hand forward. A wave of spatial power rippled.

His figure disappeared instantly!

Wang Xian saw that he was attacking again and a serious look appeared in his eyes.

He stabbed towards one spot and his figure disappeared instantly.

Buzz

Yi Ya teleported to one spot. The moment she appeared, she sensed an attack heading towards her. This caused her expression to freeze.

“You can actually sense the location of my teleportation?”

She was astonished as she blocked the attack with the sharp sword in her hand.

After blocking the attack, his gaze locked onto Wang Xian.

“Void, spare!”

She let out a soft cry. The surroundings trembled as numerous sharp swords surrounded her, forming a terrifying sword storm!

She gripped the sharp sword in her hand tightly as the number of spatial swords around her increased!

Soon, a terrifying spatial sword storm that was tens of thousands of meters in size was formed!

The surrounding void produced strange sounds as the sword of the storm tore through it!

As the storm grew larger, Yi ya circled around the center of the storm. She stared at Wang Xian and flew straight towards him.

Her speed was extremely fast!

“Not bad swordsmanship!”

While Yi Ya was accumulating her strength, Wang Xian was brandishing the sharp sword in his hand continuously!

A large number of sword catacombs had gathered in the surroundings!

The sword catacombs were like seeds that were growing rapidly. They formed many sharp swords that pierced straight into the clouds!

Every sword catacomb that rose up was a terrifying sharp sword!

Slowly, more than ten sharp swords that pierced straight into the clouds appeared in front of Wang Xian and shielded his body.

“Break! ”

When Yi Ya saw these terrifying giant swords piercing through the clouds, her face was filled with a solemn expression.

She didn’t expect that this student who was only at level nine of the eternal swordsman would be able to unleash such a powerful attack.

The attack formed by these terrifying giant swords was already able to threaten her!

However, his void sword storm was also not afraid of his opponent.

She carried the terrifying power of the sword storm and attacked the sharp swords that pierced through the clouds.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom

Bang! Bang! Bang

A loud collision sound was heard.

The terrifying sword storm continued to kill the giant swords one after another.

These giant swords were collapsing rapidly and turned into the power of space!

“Hehe! ”

Wang Xian saw the speed at which the sharp swords were collapsing and a hint of a smile appeared in his eyes.

He waved the sharp sword in his hand rapidly and formed sword mounds.

Sword mounds were formed in front of him quickly.

This time, there were a total of 18 sword mounds formed!

When the 18 sword mounds were formed, the dozens of huge swords in front of him had already been broken!

The sword storm formed by Yi Ya was still there.

He floated in the middle and stared at Wang Xian from above.

“You have exceeded my expectations, but this is the end! ”

Yi Ya’s eyes revealed a cold expression. She controlled the sword storm and continued to attack Wang Xian.

“Yes, it’s time to end this! ”

Wang Xian watched and waved his arm. The sword catacombs in front of him disappeared quickly.

“Green Peak Sword Formation, Rise! ” Wang Xian shouted in a low voice.

Boom Boom Boom

In an instant, the eighteen sword mounds turned into terrifying sword blades!

Each of the sword blades exuded a terrifying aura!

Most importantly, these eighteen sword blades seemed to form a powerful sword formation!

Clang

Clang

The eighteen sword blades surrounded Yi Ya in the middle, accompanied by the cold sound of Sharp Swords.

A terrifying sharp sword condensed in the air above the eighteen sword edges!

The sharp sword directly attacked Yi Ya!

“What is this? How is this possible?”

The sudden sword edge and the sudden sharp sword in the air made Yi Ya reveal a trace of fear on her face!

He felt the power of this sharp sword, and his body trembled violently.

Sword Storm! ”

She raised the sword in her hand, and the storm spun toward the sword above her.

“Boom!”

Everyone heard a violent explosion.

All the students’faces were filled with shock.

The sword fell from the sky, and the storm surged up into the sky.

However, the eighteen sword edges around them slowly emitted a luster, and waves of energy were injected into them.

The entire sword storm was slowly suppressed.

“Bang Bang Bang! ”

The sound of a sharp sword breaking was heard continuously, and the sharp sword that fell from the sky did not weaken at all. Instead, it became stronger and stronger!

When Yi Ya, who was inside, saw this scene, her expression changed drastically!

Her face was filled with unwillingness and fear.

Faced with this move, she actually had no way of dealing with it.. She might even be killed!Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m
