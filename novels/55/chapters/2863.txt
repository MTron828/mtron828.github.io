Chapter 2864: bright starry sky, Dragon King 5

“Buzz!”

“What’s Going On?”

“Why has the sky changed? Hiss, what is this, a nine-colored world?”

As soon as the god-destroying wind emperor finished speaking, the entire area underwent a huge change.

Nine-colored light enveloped this space, and the surrounding trees in the windless forest completely quieted down.

Even if one made a move, the trees would not attack anymore.

A single world seemed to have formed.

The nine rays of light enveloped this world, making it look very gentle and not giving off a terrifying feeling.

“Dragon King!”

At this time, another figure flew over.

Sky Array!

The changes in this space were also set up by the sky array.

He had come with the eight-limbed demon fiend, but he did not appear directly. Instead, he set up this array.

This array had only one use, sealing.

The black hole disturbing space evolved version.

Entering this space, unless one reached undying level 2, one wouldn’t be able to leave here, and one wouldn’t be able to instantly return to their God country.

“Another god Emperor from the Dragon Palace!”

The change in the surrounding space and the appearance of the sky array shocked everyone once again, immediately looking at him.

Just from the hint of power that was emitted from his body, they knew that he was another celestial thearch.

Seeing the arrival of the heaven array and sensing the changes in the surroundings, the pupils of celestial thearch of wind destruction contracted slightly. He had a bad premonition in his heart.

“Dragon King, Are You Alright?”

The Heaven Array flew over and asked Wang Xian with concern.

“I’m fine. I was injured in the windless forest valley.”

Wang Xian shook his head.

“Injured in the Windless Forest Valley?” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“No wonder this Dragon King didn’t make a move!”

When everyone around heard Wang Xian’s words, they understood a little.

“It’s good that you’re fine. It’s good that you’re fine!”

As Heaven’s formation spoke, his gaze turned to the front and landed on God Emperor Wind Destruction.

“Wind destruction, who gave you the courage to kill our Dragon King? That Old Man Huang?”

Tiancheng stared at God Emperor Fengmie and said coldly.

“You…”

God Emperor Fengmie’s expression changed slightly when he heard Tiancheng call him by his name. His eyes flickered as he stared at Tiancheng. Slowly, his expression became more and more embarrassed.

“You are the god Emperor Tiancheng. As expected, you didn’t die!”

He said in a deep voice with fear in his eyes.

“Heaven Array Divine Emperor!”

Behind him, the expressions of the three protectors, two elders, and disciples changed drastically when they heard this name.

The Heaven Array Divine Emperor was a name that everyone in the eight barrens knew.

This was a humiliation that had lasted for tens of millions of years. Back then, the Heaven Array Divine Emperor alone was not at a disadvantage when fighting against more than ten of their eight barrens divine emperors.

During that battle, the Heaven Array Divine Emperor became famous and was known as the one who swept through the eight barrens and six directions.

And the eight desolates was naturally the stepping stone for his fame.

When everyone around heard the name Tianchen divine emperor, their expressions changed.

It was like thunder striking their ears.

He had once fought against the entire eight desolates alone.

He was extremely powerful.

“Hasn’t the enmity between you and our eight desolates been resolved?”

The divine emperor of wind destruction looked at the eight desolates and said with an embarrassed expression.

“The enmity from thousands of years ago has long been resolved.”

“But is it so easy to resolve the matter that offended our Dragon King?”

The God Emperor of sky array said. His first sentence was a little calm, but when he said the second sentence, a strong killing intent surged from his body.

“This matter is indeed our fault. We are willing to pay the price.”

The god Emperor of wind destruction sensed the killing intent of the sky array and his expression changed slightly. He immediately said.

“Keke Keke, the price? The price is death!”

Eight-pointed fiend stared at God Emperor Wind destruction and his eyes were filled with a dense roar.

The moment he finished speaking, he directly attacked God Emperor Wind destruction.

Mosha, who was by the side, did not hesitate and directly charged over.

“What! ?”

Eight-pointed mosha’s sudden attack caused God emperor wind destruction’s expression to change drastically.

“This…”

The sudden outbreak of the battle between the god Emperor and the others shocked everyone. They hurriedly retreated into the distance.

The eyes of a few cowardly people and those who mocked Wang Xian earlier flashed. Their bodies trembled slightly and began to turn illusory.

However, when they wanted to teleport away, beams of nine-colored light suddenly landed on their bodies, causing them to solidify.

“Oh no, we’re trapped in this space. We Can’t return to our own divine kingdom!”

A panicked voice came from a middle-aged man.

His words shocked everyone around.

“Sky Array, you haven’t recovered to your peak. Dragon Palace Dragon King, do you really think that we, the eight desolates, are afraid of You? !”

God Emperor Wind Destruction’s expression turned extremely ugly when he saw the eight-limbed fiend that was attacking him. He roared angrily.

Even if the dragon palace was stronger than them, how could they be so easily bullied?

The god-emperor of wind destruction waved his arm, and a huge fan appeared in his hand. He waved both hands, and a terrifying storm headed toward the eight-limbed demonic fiend.

“Pu!”

However, just as he waved his attack, a black and white figure appeared behind him.

The black-and-white figure’s scythe-like claw had already landed on his neck.

Another sharp claw had directly pierced through his body.

“What! ?”

God emperor wind destruction widened his eyes and revealed a terrified expression. His forehead was instantly filled with cold sweat.

He felt that his life force was rapidly disappearing.

“What! There’s another god Emperor in the Dragon Palace!”

“Godly monarch wind destruction has been assassinated!”

In the surrounding area, everyone quickly recovered from the panic-stricken middle-aged man’s shout and looked up into the sky.

Another godly monarch appeared behind godly monarch wind destruction and his sharp attack severely injured him!

“Buzz!”

The figure who appeared behind godly monarch wind destruction was naturally ao Yao.

Ao Yao succeeded in one move and disappeared the moment the god of wind destruction reacted.

In the next moment, his figure appeared in front of Wang Xian.

“Dragon King!”

Ao Yao called out respectfully.

“Cough Cough!”

“Cough Cough!”

In the void in front of him, the god of wind destruction clutched his neck and chest. He let out a cough and blood gushed out from his mouth.

His face was extremely pale. His eyes were filled with horror as he stared at Ao Yao who was beside Wang Xian.

Seeing that Ao Yao had succeeded, Ba Qi and Mo Sha did not continue to attack.

Ao Yao’s attack had severely injured the god of wind destruction. The power of darkness and light stirred in his body.

If he wanted to kill him, he only needed to casually attack.

“Lord Feng!”

“Oh no, Lord Feng!”

The hearts of the three guardians, two elders, and the other disciples jumped violently when they saw this scene. Their faces were pale and devoid of any color as they shouted.

The three guardians flew over hurriedly with trembling bodies.

“You Want to kill me? This is the price you have to pay, the price of your life!”

Wang Xian looked at the god of wind destruction and said calmly.

“You You…”

The god of wind destruction swallowed the pills in large mouthfuls. His body trembled as he pointed at Wang Xian.

“If you guys want to start a war, my dragon palace will accept it!”

At this moment, Wang Xian interrupted him and continued to speak calmly.
