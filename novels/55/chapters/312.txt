Chapter 313: Yaksha Subdued, Off to the Spiritual Island!

As Wang Xian’s voice blasted through the sea, an overwhelming aura of Dragon Power buried the crowd of Yakshas beneath.

Powerful forces from Roving Heavens, Prime Minister Turtle, Roving Girl, and Roving Lobster aided in the overwhelming aura.

“Scram, or perish!” the centermost Yaksha warned. Waving its weapon-like arm, the Yaksha carried forth a powerful surge of water and aimed it straight at Wang Xian and gang.

The Yaksha showed not the slightest fear towards them!

“Scram, or perish!” the Yaksha warned again. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

In synchronized movements, the remaining Yakshas and their leader aimed the weapons in their arms directly towards Wang Xian and gang.

With actions so uniform, they could pass off as an army.

“Good. Splendid!” Wang Xian complimented. Admiring their discipline, he looked on at the Yakshas with increasing satisfaction. As he did, he swung an arm and ordered, “Get a hold on them, before subduing them all!”

“At your command, Dragon King!” replied Roving Heavens along with the rest of the Dragon Palace members. With an electrifying aura, they lunged directly at the Yakshas.

Wang Xian had no regard for the Yakshas, even with the presence of a Level 11 expert amongst their group of a hundred.

Based on the current abilities of the Dragon Palace members, the Devil Division led by Roving Heavens along with the Nine Venomous sea snakes would suffice in wiping the Yakshas out.

“Intruders shall die!” the Yakshas roared once again in unison. With knifelike coordination, they attacked Roving Heavens and the gang head on.

“Hah!” the group of Yakshas jeered as they swung their arm weapons at the same moment. A water swirl formed atop the forks on their arms and spiraled at frightening speeds.

Vroom!

Roving Heavens let out a roar. With a baton in hand, he charged at the Level 11 Yaksha standing at the center in a bid to attack.

Bam!

Unfazed, the Yaksha struck back at Roving Heavens head on with his weapon-like arms.

Ack, ack, ack, ack! screeched the crowd of Devil Monkeys. As they maneuvered underwater, darting like bouts of Devil Shadows, they seized at the hundred or so Yakshas.

But the Yakshas responded with neither panic nor confusion. Instead, they stood single file like experienced warriors and extended their arm-like weapons.

Boom!

A terrifying force from their weapons surged like massive currents and headed straight for the Devil Monkeys.

They condensed the flows into a mass, and as the sea waters tumbled, a Sea Spear was formed. As it emerged, it struck at the Devil Monkeys like an impending crisis.

“Water Veil! Restore peace to the seas!” a spirited voice commanded. It was Queen Clam. As she flapped the shells on her sides and swung her arms, streaks of blue water flow gathered in front of the Devil Monkeys.

Her shell was slowly turning sapphire, and it appeared more translucent than before.

“Let there be calm seas and fair winds!” the Nine Venomous sea snakes ordered. Rattling their tails, they opened their nine mouths wide. Suddenly, a gust of wind blew amidst the ocean and surged towards the waves which were crashing toward the Devil Monkeys.

Swoosh!

Together, the Water Veil and powerful gale managed to combat the attacks by the Yakshas.

But even so, the facial expressions on the hundred-odd Yakshas remained constant.

Under the leader’s command, the Yakshas initiated another attack, with the group changing stance in one swift movement.

Brandishing their weapons, and aided by a strong force from the waters, the Yakshas charged forth at Roving Heavens and the Devil Monkeys.

In one sweep, the force glided through the seas. Like a giant halberd, it scoured through everything in its path.

“Such a powerful attack. To think that a hundred Yakshas can make defense this hard for the Devil Division,” Wang Xian uttered in shock as he continued watching the hundred-odd Yakshas.

The Yakshas had attacked in a very synchronized manner. As they did, they induced the surrounding waters along to aid in attack. This heightened their terrifying prowess.

With only a couple more Level 10 experts than the Devil Division, the group of hundred-odd Yakshas had curbed the attack of the Division which had a strength of eight hundred.

Had it not been for the help from Queen Clam and Nine Venomous sea snakes, many Devil Monkeys would have been seriously injured from the attack earlier.

“You have a death wish!” Roving Heavens snarled. As he watched his suppressed juniors, he snapped in a grimace. Baring his fangs, his body lit up in appalling Devil Flames as he flung himself towards the Yakshas.

Roar! Roar! Roar!

The Devil Monkeys howled as the ferocity in them was ignited. Hair standing on end, they flashed their sharp claws and pounced along.

Tsk, tsk, tsk! hissed the Nine Venomous sea snakes nearby, slithering with increasing speed as they did. Staring coldly at nine Level 10 Yakshas with their eyes, they charged forth at them in a flash.

With one leap, Roving Lobster joined in on the attack. Using both of its giant pincers, it snipped away at the Yakshas.

All manpower from the Dragon Palace was out in full force. In an instant, the surrounding seas cowered under the majestic awe of the Divine Dragon.

Schools of fish nearby swam far away, scrambling for safety.

As they cleared the area, the sea appeared all the more vast and deep, which added on to the spookiness.

“What’s happening? Why are there bouts of terrifying forces surging from the sea? It’s giving me the shudders!” one shrieked.

“Such threatening force. What exactly is happening up front?” another quivered.

“Didn’t they say that this is the historical site of a Level-one ancient sect? Why would there be waves of such terrifying forces otherwise?” a third gulped.

On the boats in surrounding waters, all people onboard cast their glance towards the waters.

With the horrendous force surging and the irregular waves, it set everyone out in fear and trepidation.

On the deck of a large fishing vessel stood several elders. As they looked down at the seas, their eyes began to fill with dread.

“To think that a tidal wave had reversed in direction. This tremendous force is no doubt terrifying. As for the creature beneath, it must be from the Dan Realm at the very least! The ocean, how appalling!” An elder shook with a heavy look.

“What should we do, then...are we still vying for this Spiritual Island? Don’t forget that this is an ancient First-class island we’re looking at. Who knows, the Spiritual Medicine from its garden could even be on par with those from Spiritual Medicine Gardens of the Saint Class!” another elder reminded.

With burning desire in his eyes, he continued, “What’s more, given that this is a First-class force, they’re bound to possess treasures.”

“In ancient times, all the sects and clans were either located within famous mountains and rivers, or on peninsula islands. Idolized by all as the Land of the Sacred. An ancient First-class force is now on par with a current Sacred Sect. Hence we cannot give this Spiritual Island up. Just wait awhile longer!” another elder concluded.

Despite the apprehension owing to the force surging from the deep waters, no one was willing to give up in the face of such an alluring Spiritual Island.

Waiting in silence, they were all bidding for their opportunity.

“Young Master has given his orders. Charge!” a voice shouted. Meanwhile, Mo Qinglong, Mo Yuan and Mo Shiwu were on a yacht when they heard the command.

Hearts raced, and the trio locked eyes for a split moment before glancing ahead. With one leap, they dashed for the Spiritual Island.

“Someone made their move!” one shouted.

“Having a death wish. It’s akin to courting doom. Such terrifying forces are coming from the seas. Yet they still dare to charge over. We’ll see. They’ll be killed by the marine creatures soon enough!” a second mocked.

“It’s Mo Shiwu and the gang he has called. Hmm, this fellow fights pretty well, but it appears he’s not very good with his intellect!” the third commented.

“Just as well, someone to help us lead the way!” another bystander cheered.

As the trio charged forward, the crowd looked on with astonishment, but continued nonetheless in anticipation.

In moments, however, they were met with surprise and bewilderment as their faces dimmed. “Huh?” they managed faintly.

With racing speed, the trio flew inside the island parameters, eventually landing on the island without the slightest impediment.
