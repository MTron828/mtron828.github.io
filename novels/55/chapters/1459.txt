Chapter 1460: 1460 fire Phoenix Dragon Seed

“Now, in the entire Liuhai region, everyone knows that the dragon-phoenix dynasty is extremely powerful. However, they don’t know that the Dragon Palace is the one who is truly powerful!”

Wang Xian scanned all the members in the Dragon Palace and revealed a smile.

Currently, there were three people in the Dragon Palace who possessed the combat strength of level seven of the Seethrough realm.

Ao Xingmu and two demon qilin.

The combat division leaders of the Dragon Palace had already reached level five of the Seethrough realm and possessed the combat strength of level six of the Seethrough realm.

His current strength was not very outstanding in the Dragon Palace.

“It’s time for me to raise my strength!”

Wang Xian moved his body and flew directly toward the Dragon King Hall.

A group of girls followed behind him and looked at Wang Xian on the Dragon Throne happily.

“All of you, step back a little. I Can’t control the aura that I release when I make a breakthrough!”

Wang Xian reminded the girls. His body moved and transformed into a dragon.

Then, he threw the pills in his interspatial ring into his mouth.

In the past half a year, he had already obtained a terrifying amount of resources after subduing the blood flow empire and its affiliated forces.

After the dragon-phoenix Empire was established, it ruled over a thousand cities, and the fire hammer clan earned hundreds of billions of middle-grade spirit stones from selling weapons every day.

The profit was about 60 to 70 billion middle-grade spirit stones.

60 to 70 billion middle-grade spirit stones was a huge amount of money for a dynasty.

Just the pills bought with these spirit stones could increase a lot of dragon qi.

With the continuous income of spiritual stones, the strength of the members of the Dragon Palace had also increased tremendously.

“Ding! Congratulations to host for breaking through in your level. As you have comprehended the strongest aspect of the five elements, the five elements grinding has further strengthened and strengthened the Dragon Head!”

“Ding! Congratulations to host for comprehending the aspect, the dragon has the head of the world!”

Boom

When the system’s voice rang in Wang Xian’s mind, his body began to improve crazily.

His 70-meter-long body expanded rapidly, especially the position of the dragon head. The energy of the five elements swept across it.

Every dragon whisker and two huge dragon horns emitted a divine glow.

The energy of the five elements grinding strengthened the position of the dragon head.

The third aspect, the dragon head of the world!

His body finally stopped at the 80-meter-long position. The energy contained in his huge dragon body was even more terrifying!

“It seems that every time I upgrade and comprehend the aspect, I will be able to strengthen a part of my body!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. When he thought of each aspect, he found it a little funny.

When he used the dragon kingdom in his palm, the entire Dragon Claw had expanded by three kilometers, which was three thousand meters.

However, his body was still tens of meters long. It looked very comical.

The dragon head and the world aspect were the same. The Dragon Head had expanded by a few thousand meters while the body was still eighty meters long. wasn’t that like a tadpole?

“It seems like I can only look normal after I transform my entire body aspect!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. His body moved and returned to his human form.

“Xiao Xian, Congratulations on your improvement!”

“Husband, now you have the strength of a seventh-level void interpretation!”

A group of girls ran over with faces full of joy and asked happily.

“HMM, his strength should be about the same as AO Xingmu’s!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile.

Ao Xingmu’s strength was definitely the most terrifying existence among the seventh-level void interpretation. Now, Wang Xian was on par with him. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Next, all of you need to improve your cultivation. Also, the Dragon Palace needs to consolidate their strength!”

Wang Xian said to them.

The Dragon Palace had added about 10,000 new members. Next, they needed to get used to each other and undergo training.

Moreover, they were already invincible in the Liuhai region. Next, they would enter the stage of normal development.

“Alright, but we need to call sister Feng Luan to celebrate!”

Guan Shuqing and the rest of them said happily.

“Don’t invite Feng Luan. She has a lot of things to do. Let’s go celebrate. Hehe!”

As Wang Xian spoke, his gaze swept across the six girls and his eyes lit up.

This was especially so for Zhang Fengying. Although the girls had accepted her, they had never slept together before.

Now that everything had been settled, it was time to start clapping for love.

When he thought of Zhang Fengying’s figure that was even hotter than that of a jiaya, he felt extremely excited.

Charge!

For two days in a row, Wang Xian once again lived a life that was as happy as the heavens.

Boom

Two days later, a muffled sound suddenly rang in the Dragon Palace. A thick flame filled the entire dragon palace.

Ding! “Dragon seed harvested, fire phoenix dragon seed!”

At this moment, the voice of the system suddenly rang out in Wang Xian’s mind.

“Eh? What’s going on?”

Wang Xian was slightly shocked. He immediately flew out of the bedroom and headed towards the dragon pool.

Chirp! Chirp

When he looked into the dragon pool, he revealed a surprised expression.

A huge fire phoenix was slowly circling above the dragon pool.

The fire Phoenix’s gaze was fixed on one of the divine dragons on the nine dragon pillars.

Wang Xian looked over and revealed a surprised expression. Initially, there were nine divine dragons that looked exactly the same.

Now, the Divine Dragon that the fire Phoenix was staring at was burning with flames all over its body.

It had completely turned into a fire divine dragon.

“It’s because of the indestructible wood. The Indestructible Wood is the wood of origin fire. The Dragon Palace extracted the blood of the Phoenix and gave birth to a new dragon seed, the Fire Phoenix Dragon Seed!”

Wang Xian had some understanding in his heart and a hint of excitement appeared in his eyes.

The Fire Phoenix Dragon Seed was definitely not weaker than the fire gold dragon seed, the thorny dragon seed, and the Starwood Dragon Seed.

“This is a big win. Moreover, the Phoenix can really increase her strength in the dragon pool. Her level has already reached the fifth level of the Seethrough Void!”

Wang Xian stared at the gigantic fire Phoenix and revealed a faint smile.

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

At this moment, the Fire Phoenix turned its head and shouted at Wang Xian. Its body moved and transformed into a human form.

Feng Luan’s eyes were filled with excitement and shock.

“I actually turned my bloodline back into a fire Phoenix. Back then, when I was in the realm of longevity, I could only transform into the form of a fire Phoenix. Furthermore, I could only maintain it for ten minutes!”

“Now, I can change my form freely. After I transform into a fire Phoenix, I can fight two levels higher and fight against a powerhouse at the seventh level of the profound Void Stage!”

She walked towards Wang Xian excitedly.

“Oh? Isn’t that great?”

Wang Xian smiled at her.

“I still have some resources here. I’ll go and upgrade one more level. Unfortunately, before my strength reaches the realm of longevity, I can’t reveal my Phoenix form as I Please!”
