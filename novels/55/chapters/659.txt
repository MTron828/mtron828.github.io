Chapter 660: If You Aren’t Leaving, I’ll Bury You Here (3)

Translator: Larbrestudio

Wang Xian was neither interested in replying nor listening to their rattles.

Since they were not leaving, then they could stay here for good.

With Level 9 dragonians, their strength, coupled with the Spiritual Equipment, was just barely enough to fight against fifteen enemies of equivalent levels.

However, with him around, he could instantly end all the fights.

Wang Xian decided to support them by making a strike. He wanted to observe the strength of the dragonians and give them some training.

When five Level 12 spiritual swords appeared in his hand, he hurled them into the air at a daunting speed.

However, the five spiritual swords stayed put and suspended themselves quietly in the air as they exuded domineering energy, striking fear into everyone.

“Is the Dragon King going to strike?”

“Gosh, nine Budding Realm experts can actually go against fifteen Budding Realm experts. Five spiritual swords from the Dragon King are also ready to strike!”

“This group of overseas forces is doomed. The Dragon King is still, indeed, the Dragon King!”

Those Martial Artists of the Underworld behind Wang Xian were elated to see this.

At first, they thought the Dragon King could at most occupy one or two mountains. Little did they expect Dragon Sect’s strength to have grown to such a domineering level.

The Dragon King was going to chase away all the overseas forces!

Even better, kill them all!

“Since the Dragon King did not ask us to leave, does that mean that he is allowing us to practice under that spiritual energy waterfall?” one of the Inborn Experts asked with a slight thrill.

Several people beside him nodded slowly. “I wonder what conditions the Dragon King has!”

“So what? It’s fine to even become a subsidiary sect of Dragon Sect since the entire Underworld belongs to him now!”

“That’s right. Given their current strength, unifying the entire Underworld is a piece of cake!”

Some Martial Artists commented softly. Several Inborn Experts even nodded their heads in agreement.

Even if Wang Xian requested all the Martial Artists in the Underworld to join Dragon Sect, none of them would have any objections.

The three Dan Realm experts of Reeds Spirits nodded in silence after exchanging looks.

Whoosh!

At this time, five spiritual swords in the air were stabbing one of the Nether Flame Budding Realm Experts.

Boom!

The Budding Realm expert from Nether Flame was horrified. “Dragon King, are you bent on making enemies with the Nether Flame? When Nether Flame God arrives here, you’ll die a horrible death!”

“Hehe, this is your burial place. If you want to leave, you can only do so by killing the Dragon Sect’s men. Otherwise, stay in China!”

Wang Xian cast an indifferent gaze at the overseas forces with a taunting look on his face.

“Brother, use your spiritual swords to stab that old man in mustard clothing. Just now, he killed one of the Thistles and Thorns Sect’s disciples!” said Xiao Yu, tugging on Wang Xian’s arm

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile. He cast his gaze at the old man in mustard clothing who was besieging a dragonian with another Budding Realm expert.

That dragonian kept staggering back, as he was completely under suppression.

Wang Xian waved his arm, and five spiritual swords darted out instantly.

“Damn it!”

The elder who was attacking the dragonian was horrified as he staggered back hastily. He swung his palm, and a mustard palm of a dozen meters slammed onto the five spiritual swords.

Swish!

However, the five spiritual swords pierced through the palm right away. Under the horrifying gaze of that old man, the swords penetrated his limbs, crushing his entire body with domineering energy!

Ah!

A shriek was heard as fear flashed in the eyes of that old man, looking at the five scary spiritual swords in horror.

“So strong!”

“Attack that fellow and stop him from controlling the spiritual swords!” one of the Budding Realm experts from Creepy Snake Group exclaimed while a black figure charged at Wang Xian immediately.

Whoosh!

However, the five spiritual swords split into millions of swords instantly, looming over the incoming figure.

“Baka!” [1]

That black figure grimaced and let out a raging roar.

Ah!

When millions of swords penetrated him, the black figure let out a terrifying cry. His four limbs were, too, pierced through by the spiritual swords, and exploded!

“This is...? This is toying around?”

“Playing with them?”

The group of Martial Artists of the Underworld widened their eyes as they saw the Dragon King grinning from ear to ear. They quivered as stunning looks welled up in their eyes.

“This is the consequence for playing punk in China?” a Martial Artist of the Underworld asked blankly.

The four Budding Realm experts from Gautama Denomination could not help but narrow their eyes upon seeing the annihilation of one Budding Realm expert.

Not that Wang Xian could not kill that expert, but he crippled him just like he was a toy. This struck fear into them.

Four experts exchanged glances with dreadful expressions.

“The Gautama Denomination does not want to fight with the Dragon King. We’ll leave China now!”

One of the experts from Gautama Denomination darkened his expression and bellowed in a low voice.

“Too late. The Chinese are hospitable people. You can be buried here!”

Wang Xian chuckled as his eyes became filled with disdain.

“Thinking of leaving? How could it be that easy? How dare you say we’re the Sick man of East Asia? Trashy Underworld?”

Xiao Yu snorted coldly as she stared with a beaming face.

Upon hearing what they said, the experts from the overseas forces felt their hearts sink.

In this instance, the spiritual sword in Wang Xian’s hand whipped up another attack.

The water swords that were shrouding five thousand meters of the area penetrated the four Budding Realm experts, and they were crippled right away.

“Okay, now we’re one-on-one. This is much fairer. Those who defeated my subordinates can leave. Other than that, don’t ever think of escaping!”

Wang Xian’s indifferent voice reverberated across more than ten kilometers, causing embarrassment for all the supreme-class experts from the overseas forces.

From the combat just now, they were shocked to realize that this expert who exuded murderous aura was far stronger and more fearsome than they had thought!

They would never be a match for him one-on-one. At the same time, they could not escape. In other words, they would be killed by their opponent!

He’s toying with us!

Such a thought suddenly popped into their heads. They had arrived here with pride and self-esteem, and they stuck their heads in the clouds, thinking that they were here to teach the uncivilized people some lessons. Now, they had fallen down from their clouds!

Embarrassment, rage, fear, and a tinge of despair were all they felt!

“They...They are the overseas forces that we surrendered ourselves to!”

Back at the bottom of the mountain, those Martial Artists of the Underworld who had surrendered themselves were completely frozen.

Their masters were being toyed with by the most powerful expert from their Underworld.

“Dragon King of Dragon Sect!”

They trembled, unsure of whether it was out of fear or hatred!

All the six ultimate overseas forces and over ten Budding Realm experts had met their doom on this land that, in their opinions, bred the Sick men of East Asia.

They had met their doom in the Underworld which they regarded as a piece of trash!

“Keep one alive from each of the forces. Let them go back and spread the word. They need to consider the consequences before they enter China in the future!”Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com
