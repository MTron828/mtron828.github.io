Chapter 306: Cai Lu Fa Di

Triangular alchemy furnace.

Below the alchemy furnace was tumbling lava. The entire alchemy furnace was green and looked like it was from a long time ago.

Despite being within a cave of a scorching hot volcano, Wang Xian didn’t feel the heat at all.

“This is my Triangular Green Alchemy Furnace. I found it from an ancient ruin. As for the Arts of Refining Elixir Pills, I got it from the same place. This is also the root of my ascension!”

Sui Huang smiled and looked at Wang Xian. “I don’t know how a demon like you can reach this horrifying realm at such a young age. You probably have your own chance encounter!”

Hehe.

Wang Xian smiled and nodded his head. Subsequently, he turned and looked at the alchemy furnace inquisitively. “I had not expected the alchemy recorded in history to really exist. I wonder if I could concoct elixir pills that grant a person eternal life!”

“Elixir pills that grant eternal life? Haha! That might be possible. Records of emperors in history searching for all kinds of elixir pills to extend their lives weren’t just myths. They truly existed,” Sui Huang said in a definitive tone. When it came to refining elixir pills, he maintained a confident and reverent attitude.

“Is it really that incredible? Could it be that there were real immortals on Earth in the past?” Wang Xian was surprised and asked as his eyes beamed.

“Perhaps. However, there might not have been!” Sui Huang sank into deep thought and couldn’t give a definitive answer this time. “Based on some records, there were definitely more experts in the past than current times. As for the existence of immortals recorded in mythology, I can’t be sure.”

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly. The world is too mysterious. Based on mythology, there were ghosts and demons that roamed the world and immortals that flew in the air. However, these claims couldn’t be verified.

As to whether there were real immortals, no one could be sure. It was especially so for Ancient Martial Artists.

After all, their arts of cultivations had all originated from the past.

“The path of refining elixir pills is vast and deep. If you can become a powerful alchemist, you will gain huge benefits too. As for the value of elixir pills, they are typically valued ten times more than spiritual medicine of the same level,” explained Sui Huang.

“Really?” Wang Xian was taken aback as he asked in shock.

“Definitely. The effects of Level 1 elixir pills could match the effects of a Level 2 spiritual medicine,” Sui Huang explained as if he was explaining a known fact. “Spiritual medicine in the world is just simple elemental energies and effects. If you could mix them with other spiritual medicine to form elixir pills, the effects of the elixir pills would be several times better!”

“Naturally, refining elixir pills is an extremely difficult thing. It requires great talents and control over fire. At my current realm, I am only able to refine up to Level 5 elixir pills!”

“A Level 5 elixir pills made by me can allow a Half-step to Inborn Realm expert reach the Inborn Realm directly without obstructions!”

“Level 6 elixir pills can allow an Inborn expert to reach the Half-Step to Dan Realm. Level 7 elixir pills can allow a Half-Step to Dan Realm expert to reach the Dan Realm!”

“Wow, that’s incredible!” Wang Xian was shocked.

“The path of cultivation requires ‘Cai,”Lu,”Fa,”Di.’ Based on this sequence, ‘Cai’ is the first requirement. It represents resources. What’s the most important resource for cultivation? That is spiritual medicine!”

“‘Lu’ represents cultivators who cultivate together. It is about interaction, cross verification and helping each other understand. ‘Lu’ could also refer to one’s master and receiving guidance from one’s master. Naturally, it could also refer to couples.”

“‘Fa’ refers to the cultivation method. In other words, it’s the secret art of cultivation!”

“As for ‘Di,’ it’s about the location of cultivation.”

“‘Cai,”Lu,”Fa,”Di’ together are a train of thoughts that any cultivators, past or present, can agree to. Resource is the first requirement and therefore you should be able to see the importance of spiritual medicine and spiritual grass!” Sui Huang explained to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian pondered.

As a divine dragon and having the Divine Dragon system, the system could substitute for “Lu.” For “Fa,” he had the Divine Dragon Transformation. For “Di” he had his Dragon Palace.

He was only lacking in “Cai!”

If the system was similar to the Divine Dragon Cultivation System, would “Cai” appear in the system in the future?

Only by having all four requirements could he become a powerful divine dragon.

As for the notification from the system, he had only learned about the Dragon Palace after subduing three marine animals.

Could it be that I need to reach a certain condition to have the “Cai”?

If that’s the case, what should I do?

Can it be that I need...?

Wang Xian’s eyes beamed as he looked to the Triangular Green Alchemy Furnace.

Since he had obtained the system, there were few notifications. Moreover, this system was different from common novels he had read.

The system did not issue him a mission or a main path to follow. He had to do the discovery of most things by himself.

“Old Sui... That...” Wang Xian’s eyes shimmered and smiled. “Old Sui, can you let me take a look at your Arts of Refining Elixir Pills?”

When Sui Huang heard him, he was taken aback. His expression turned gloomy and looked at Wang Xian with ridicule. “Rascal, you have pretty thick skin!”

“Passable, passable.” Wang Xian pressed on and continued, “I’d just like to take a look as I’m interested in it. If I can become an alchemist, I’ll send some Level 6, 7 and 8 pills to you after I refine them in the future.”

Pfft!

Sui Huang was a little annoyed upon hearing Wang Xian. “Level 7, 8? Do you think the Arts of Refining Elixir Pills is that simple? Disregarding refining elixir pills, can you find Level 7 and 8 spiritual medicine and grass? You sure know how to brag!”

“Hmm! In that case, tell me what I have to do for you to show me your Arts of Refining Elixir Pills?” Wang Xian asked directly.

“You, little rascal!” Sui Huang wasn’t pleased when he heard that Wang Xian wanted to learn about alchemy. This was his trump card and the reason for his ascension. However, he recalled that his wife would be his disciple.

He couldn’t guarantee that his disciple wouldn’t let this rascal know.

“I’m fine with you taking a look at the Arts of Refining Elixir Pills. However, in the future and as long as you are alive, if my Sui Family is in trouble, you have to help them. Besides that, give me some treasures that interest me. Otherwise, don’t even think about it!” Sui Huang said with a little disdain.

“I’m fine with helping out but I can’t be forever guarding your Sui Family, right? Three times. Three times at the maximum. As for treasures...?”

Wang Xian frowned. He didn’t seem to have any treasures at all. Even his spiritual medicine was used up by this old man.

“I’ll give you the treasures when I find them.”

“In that case, let’s continue this conversation when you have something that interests me!” After finishing these words, Sui Huang continued impatiently, “Go, go. I’m not bringing you around anymore. If something interests you, you might just take it away from me considering how thick skinned you are!”

“Damn! Old man! Am I a person like that?” Wang Xian was speechless and asked him this directly.

“You aren’t? You just asked me for my trump card. You are not a person like that?” sneered Sui Huang.

“You didn’t even give me anything, right?” Wang Xian choked and his voice softened.

“I’m not silly! Who would give you this the moment you demand it!” Sui Huang shot him a deathly glare.

“Alright, I shall not argue with a petty guy like you. When I find the treasures that can interest you, I’ll exchange them for your Arts of Refining Elixir Pills,” answered Wang Xian shamelessly.

After which, he changed the subject rapidly. “Hehe. Let’s go. Old Sui, show me around the place!”

“Tsk. Not calling me an old man anymore?” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Old Sui, please!”
