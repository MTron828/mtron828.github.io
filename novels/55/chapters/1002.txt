Chapter 1003: 1004 sensational demon Hunters Academy

Translator: 5496903

The Void Beast mercenary group and amethyst mercenary group, the two second and third ranked mercenary groups of the Demon Hunters Academy, came out to protect him. They could make sure that the young master mercenary group wouldn’t dare to offend him in the future.

However, Wang Xian still said that Yun Hanhai was killed by him in the end. This was the reason.

This time, it wasn’t because he was arrogant or arrogant. It was because he had thought it through carefully.

“Commander Wang, we will set off directly at noon tomorrow. When the time comes, we will contact each other through the communication stone plate. Please be careful!”

When they walked out of the Demon Hunter Manor, Zhang Yitian and Xia houming reminded Wang Xian.

“Don’t Worry!”

Wang Xian smiled and nodded. Then, he walked towards their residence.

Zhang Yitian, Xia houming, and the rest of the two mercenary groups looked at Wang Xian’s back with sparkling eyes.

“Leader Zhu Hou, how did you know leader Wang?”

Seeing the figure disappear, Zhang Yitian looked at Xia houming and asked curiously.

“He saved the life of our void Beast mercenary group. If it wasn’t for him, I would have died!”

Xia houming smiled and looked at the girls beside him. “What about you guys?”

“He saved more than ten of us!”

Deputy Commander Xiao chimed in from the side.

“His strength is really abnormal. He might be able to succeed in this mission. However...”

As Xia houming spoke, he recalled that he had personally said that he had killed Yun Hanhai and the rest. A hesitant look appeared on his face.

“He shouldn’t...”

Zhang Yitian and the rest of the girls frowned slightly. A contemplative look appeared on their faces.

They were very surprised when Wang Xian said that he had killed Yun Hanhai and the rest!

Could it be that this Wang Xian was really courting death?

“I hope he has his own thoughts. Otherwise, it will be very difficult for us to help him!”

Xia houming said helplessly. He shook his head and bade farewell to Zhang Yitian before leaving.

“Let’s Go Too!”

Zhang Yitian said to the group of girls behind him. His tall and swaying body walked towards the academy.

...

“Is it really that Wang Xian who killed Hai’er?”

At this moment, in a manor in the central area of Donghai City, a middle-aged man shouted with a face full of killing intent.

Beside him, a table was completely shattered. His eyes were blood-red, causing everyone in the hall to lower their heads and not dare to look into his eyes.

Snake Scar, who was standing in front of the middle-aged man, faced the middle-aged man. His face was slightly pale as he said, “It’s uncle. He admitted it himself today. Many people present heard it!”

“A new student of the Demon Hunters Academy has the ability to kill me, Hai’er?”

The middle-aged man’s face was a little ferocious. He clenched his fists tightly, and his whole body was exuding a cold murderous aura. “Whether it’s him or not, he must die. All his relatives must die!”

“Uncle, I, Snake Mark, will avenge brother Yun. No matter how big the price is, I will kill that Kid!”

Snake mark lowered his head and said with a gloomy face.

“Get Out!”

The middle-aged man ignored snake mark and said coldly.

“Yes, Uncle!”

Snake mark was slightly stunned and walked out with a gloomy face.

“Wang Xian, you are dead meat!”

Snake mark squinted his eyes and a sinister light flashed.

“Leader!”

Just as snake mark walked out of the Yun family, a group of young master’s mercenary group members walked over.

“Leader, according to the information we received, the Sky Beast and amethyst will head to the windwing rampant fish’s territory in the Dragon Wind Region Tomorrow to prepare for the diamond-level mission!”

A young man carefully looked at the gloomy snake mark and said.

“Yes!”

Snake mark coldly nodded.

“We suspect that... that kid might go!”

The youth continued.

“He still dares to leave the city?”

Snake Mark’s eyes revealed a vicious light, causing the youth to be startled.

“Send someone to personally watch that guy!”

Snake Mark’s expression darkened as he hesitated.

“Commander, the Amethyst and void Beast mercenary group is protecting him now...”

A youth said hesitantly.

“If anyone dares to protect him, the Yun family will exterminate them without US taking Action!”

Snake Mark thought of the amethyst and the Void Beast. He snorted coldly and walked straight to the front.

The young men from the young master’s mercenary group beside him were slightly stunned and immediately followed behind.

At this moment, on the Demon Hunters Academy’s Forum, the news of Wang Xian killing Yun Hanhai and the rest had spread like wildfire.

The incident at the banquet today had also been exposed.

When the group of young men from the Demon Hunters Academy found out about this news, they were all shocked.

“Why would the amethyst mercenary group and the Void Beast mercenary group protect that Wang Xian? Especially the amethyst mercenary group. Don’t they have a grudge against Wang Xian?”

“Oh my God, is this Wang Xian Reckless? He actually said that he killed Yun Hanhai and the rest. Now, even the amethyst and void beasts can’t save him!”

“The Yun family will definitely make a move. Even if this kid has ten lives, it’s still not enough for him to die!”

“This is really unexpected. If he didn’t say that he killed Yun Hanhai and the rest, no one would dare to provoke him in the demon hunters academy in the future. Now, he actually said it out stupidly!”

“With his strength, how could he kill Yun Hanhai and the rest of the powerhouses?”

“Now that he has said that, regardless of whether he killed them or not, the Yun family will get rid of him!”

Everyone in the Academy was dumbfounded. This was the first time they had seen such a suicidal person.

Even the instructors of the academy knew about this matter. All of them frowned and shook their heads slowly.

Anyone would have to pay a heavy price for killing the future heir of the Yun family in Donghai City.

Wang Xian did not pay attention to the matter in the Academy’s Forum. Instead, he looked at the information that Zhang Yitian had given him.

I hope I can get a good harvest this time

Wang Xian held the lightning strike wood in his hand as he thought to himself. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The next morning, Wang Xian brought Ao Jian and the rest out of the city. Sensing the gazes behind him, he smiled.

After leaving the city, Wang Xian easily shook them off.

“Where are they?”

Five minutes later, a middle-aged man scanned the surroundings with a sullen face. He took out his communication stone plate and sent a message with an embarrassed expression.

“They’re here!”

At the edge of the ocean, which was 30 kilometers away from the East Gate, a group of people stood by the seaside. Their eyes were fixed on Wang Xian and the rest who were flying towards them.

“They’re half an hour late!”

In the middle of the amethyst mercenary group, a woman beside the tall Zhang Yuntian said with slight dissatisfaction.

The woman’s height was comparable to Zhang Ytian’s.

However, her figure was even more fiery than Zhang Ytian’s. Her curvy figure could almost make people explode on the spot.

If it wasn’t for the fact that there was no plastic surgery on the transcendence continent, almost everyone would think that she had such a fiery figure after plastic surgery.

The woman’s appearance was somewhat similar to Zhang Ytian’s, but it was much more familiar.

“Aunt, he is the benefactor of our mercenary group. He is very strong. Don’t say anything later!”

Zhang Ytian looked at the woman and reminded her.

“A kid actually has such strength. I want to see what kind of bloodline he has!”

The woman crossed her arms and felt like she was holding a huge ball. She looked over curiously.
