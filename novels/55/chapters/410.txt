Chapter 411: To Establish Grounds and Found Ancestral Sects

“Many thanks to the two Big Bros, Saint Qi and Saint Wen, for coming to grace the occasion. Please guide us along, for future matters pertaining to our Mechanic Sect!”

“Haha, it’s no issue. Brother Sun sure is ambitious. To think you’ve established grounds and founded an Ancestral Sect at such a tender age! I’m truly in awe!”

“Haha, I had considered joining the Dark Sect initially. But on second thought, I decided to forgo that idea and set up my own Ancestral Sect instead. Who knows, perhaps it’ll become strong enough to be deemed a First-class force in a few decades. Should luck be on my side, it might just end up as a Sacred Sect!”

With strong confidence, the son of Mogul Sun was conversing with two young men. As he spoke, he exuded an aura which made him seem gutsy enough to challenge all heroes of the world to a duel.

The two young men smiled politely but kept mum otherwise.

It seemed rather inferior, for a Half-step Inborn to be establishing grounds and founding Ancestral Sects. But, some things cannot be helped, given the party’s affluence.

There were times when one was considered powerful within the underworld for being very rich. With hundreds of billion worth of assets, it was an easy feat for one to set up an Ancestral Clan.

“Brother Sun, if you wish to establish grounds and found Ancestral Sects, the least you should do is to start taking in disciples, not even one less. In addition, it’s best to take in those who are greatly gifted, along with an Elder to help you with the overseeing of matters. For there are many things to take care of,” the two young men reminded the son of Mogul Sun.

“I’m well aware of this. Which is why I’m here today at my father’s banquet, to take in some disciples. I’ll have to trouble you Big Bros to assist me later!” the son of Mogul Sun replied with a grin.

“Within the entire Southern Province, there’s only Maniac Ji who’s an Inborn expert. Given my powers, I would come in among the top three within the Southern Province. So establishing ground and founding Ancestral Sect is going to be a breeze for me, along with the taking in of several outstanding disciples!”

“Moreover, given my father’s influence and our Sun Family’s assets, I believe many would join our Mechanic Sect!”

The Son of Mogul Sun assured them confidently. As he looked around at everyone in the ballroom, he made his way towards the center with a prideful beam.

The crowd returned a curious look as they saw the son of Mogul Sun walking towards the center of the ballroom.

“Everyone, may I have your attention!” the son of Mogul Sun said with his head lifted. He cast his gaze at the hundreds around him and continued explaining with a faint smile, “This is Sun Longxuan. And I’m honored to be meeting everyone here!”

As Sun Long spoke, he took several steps to the side.

With the first stride he made, he exuded an air, while his second stride was bolstered by an overpowering stance that shot across the entire ballroom.

“As I’ve just stepped foot into the underworld, I seek your guidance!” Sun Longxuan introduced.

Boom!

Right as Sun Longxuan ended his words, his attire shuffled, even in the absence of wind. The powerful stance took everyone in the ballroom by storm.

“This stance. Such a powerful stance!” one commented.

“To think that the son of Mogul Sun is a Martial Artist, and one who is this powerful. I’m afraid his prowess has reached a Half-step Inborn!”

“The son of Mogul Sun is currently at most twenty-three to twenty-four years of age. Yet, in spite of that, he’s already attained Half-step Inborn status. It seems like he would make the top three within the entire Southern Province!”

“Too powerful. Plus, Longxuan is really handsome! Goodness, if only I could marry him. How great would that be!?”

Everyone in the ballroom reacted with shock upon sensing the stance which Sun Longxuan possessed.

With a father who was the richest man in the Southern Province, he was no doubt a son blessed by the deities since he boasted powerful abilities in his early twenties, which would easily be crowned within the province.

As Sun Longxuan noticed the surprised look on everyone’s faces, he smiled in satisfaction and seemed very pleased, with his brows raised.

“I have an announcement to make today!” Sun Longxuan explained with his arms folded behind his back like a Grandmaster. “Given my status as a Half-Step Inborn, I, Sun Longxuan, am here to establish grounds and found sects. Hence, I hereby announce the founding of Mechanic Sect with effect from today onward!”

“Whereas the two beside me are the duo, Saint Qi and Saint Wen, from the Dark Sect. In times to come, they will also assume the role of the honorary Elders of the Mechanic Sect,” he continued by introducing his two Big Bros.

“So, what’s the Mechanic Sect about?” Sun Longxuan began to talk about his establishment. As he spoke, he spread his palm open where a Metallic Lotus appeared. With a swing of his arm, the lotus took off into the surrounding air behind him.

Zing, zing, zing!

The lotus petals detached themselves before shooting forward.

Bam, bam, bam!

One by one, the petals landed on a table by the side.

Zip, zip, zip!

Under the astonished stares of the crowd, the same table was split neatly into more than a dozen pieces.

The metallic petals returned to the Lotus, where it swirled in mid-air atop the flora as it shimmered in dazzling rays.

“This is the Technique of the Mechanic Sect which is somewhat similar to that of the Dark Sect’s, yet entirely different on its own. It’s imparted with the Lu Ban Technique and integrates it as one along with the use of mechanics!”

As he spoke, Sun Longxuan stretched his arms out. Pieces began to build upon his body before assembling themselves to form metallic armor.

It resembled a scene from the Sci-fi movie, Ironman.

Creak, creak, creak!

A pair of black wings emerged from Sun Longxuan’s back, while his chest area was shielded by a black cuirass.

As he flapped his wings gently, he soared into the air.

The wings folded themselves leisurely in front of Sun Longxuan before lashing open again in an instant. This empowered Sun Longxuan with a dominating aura.

“Such is the trait of the Mechanic Sect where one’s internal energy merges with the use of mechanics to become a whole, emitting formidable powers. I dare say, I’m unrivaled within the Half-step Inborn realm, given my current powers as one. Once my choice weapon’s been upgraded into an Inborn Spiritual Weapon, I too, can step foot into the Inborn realm by feeding on the weapon’s energy through the Reciprocation method!”

“Today marks the start of my Mechanic Sect where I’ll need to take in disciples, so that we can work together and build one powerful Ancestral Sect, and gain a strong foothold within the underworld, haha!”

Sun Longxuan burst out in laughter as he spoke before he turned to face the crowd. “I wonder if anyone here wishes to join my Mechanic Sect. Our sect has no lack of resources and funds while our Ancestral Sect grounds have also been built!”

“I’ll go. To think, the son of Mogul Sun wants to establish grounds and found sects!” one volunteered.

“How awe-inspiring, establishing grounds and founding sects. While the powers of a Half-step Inborn would suffice for such, to establish grounds and found sects in one’s early twenties? This son of Mogul Sun sure has lofty aspirations!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Those two young men...to think they’re the duo, Saint Qi and Saint Wen, from the Dark Sect! Not only are they Inborns, but they’re also Saints of a Sacred Sect!”

“The Dark Sect is renowned for its use of Hidden Weapons. To think the son of Mogul Sun has invited the two Saints over to be his Honorary Elders. The duo, Saint Qi and Saint Wen, are candidates deemed to become the future Sacred Sect Leaders. Now, given the backing from the duo, the Mechanic Sect has immediately ascended to become a First-class force, and one with substantial backing, to add to it!”

“This is truly something. To think Sun Longxuan has managed to invite the Saints of a Sacred Sect to be his Honorary Elders. It’s obvious that he has friendly ties with the Dark Sect. Who knows, perhaps the Mechanic Sect might just become a powerful Ancestral Sect within the underworld in times to come!”

The ballroom crowd gasped, surprised by the news of Mogul Sun’s son wanting to establish grounds and found sects. Furthermore, he revealed his intention through an elaborate display of prowess. This was no doubt breaking news, taking the entire Southern Province by storm.

At the sight of everyone’s astonished faces, Sun Longxuan smiled with overwhelming confidence. “I guarantee those who join the Mechanic Sect a life of endless ascensions and successes. This will be the best choice you’ve made!”
