“Vacate the entire third floor? Where are we staying then?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows when he heard the waiter’s words and asked directly.

“We will give you double the compensation. Young Master, please find another room to stay in!”

The waiter replied with a smile.

“I don’t need double the compensation. Why? I have already stayed here for a night and now you want us to leave?”

At this moment, a furious voice came from the side.

Wang Xian looked over and saw a burly middle-aged man staring at the waiter in front of him with bell-like eyes. The aura of an extraordinary level six was pressing down on him directly.

“If I tell you to SCRAM, scram immediately. Don’t bring trouble on yourself!”

Before the waiter could speak, two young men and a group of middle-aged men who were standing in the middle of the corridor looked over. A thin middle-aged man stared at him coldly. He looked extremely cold-blooded.

The burly middle-aged man’s face turned pale, as he stared at them in fear.

“This... This is bright moon city, if you dare to make a move here...”

“Scram!”

The burly middle-aged man’s face turned ugly as he spoke. However, before he could finish, the skinny middle-aged man interrupted him, looking at him coldly.

The skinny middle-aged man’s eyes didn’t have any emotion. The aura of a rank 7 transcendent enveloped the burly middle-aged man.

A killing intent that could penetrate one’s heart caused the burly middle-aged man’s expression to change drastically. He staggered slightly.

“Alright, we’ll Leave Now!”

The burly middle-aged man’s eyes were filled with fear. Such a bone-piercing killing intent was definitely not an ordinary martial artist.

An ordinary martial artist’s body had more killing intent, which was obviously different from killing intent.

However, the thin middle-aged man in front of him had a dense killing intent, which was obviously condensed from killing many people.

“Hurry up and get out of the way!”

The three young men standing at the front revealed a faint mocking expression, and one of the young men directly shouted.

When the young man finished speaking, the middle-aged men around him revealed a terrifying killing intent in their eyes. For a moment, the entire corridor of the third floor was extremely cold.

“Hurry up and SCRAM!”

When the three young men saw this scene, a faint smile appeared on their faces as they spoke arrogantly.

When Wang Xian saw this scene, he raised his eyebrows.

“Young master...”

When the waiter saw Wang Xian’s indifferent look, he frowned slightly and shouted.

“Eh?”

The rest of the people on the third floor left. Only Wang Xian remained standing there without moving an inch. Everyone’s gaze was directed at him.

“What’s Wrong?”

Feng Luan’s puzzled voice came from inside.

“It’s nothing. A bunch of self-righteous fellows!”

Wang Xian said indifferently and closed the door.

“Kid, are you courting death?”

Everyone’s expression changed slightly when they heard Wang Xian’s words. The skinny middle-aged man looked at him.

“Scram!”

Wang Xian’s expression turned cold instantly. The aura on his body trembled and a terrifying pressure was directed towards the group.

A group of middle-aged men and three young men. The strongest one among them was only at level eight of the extraordinary realm. How could they chase him and Feng Luan Away?

The three young men and the group of young men felt the terrifying aura and their expressions changed slightly.

“Young... Young Master...”

The waiter standing in front of Wang Xian trembled and fell backward. His face was filled with fear.

“Don’t disturb us!”

Wang Xian glanced at them with disdain and closed the door with a bang.

This was the world of the strong. Even the owner of this restaurant could not chase people out casually. This was because offending a strong person would result in the retaliation of the strong person.

This was especially so for a top-notch strong person like a transcendent level nine.

Wang Xian’s aura just now was that of a transcendent level nine.

The three young men looked at the tightly shut door and their expressions changed drastically.

“Young Masters, we...”

The waiter’s face was extremely pale as he looked at the three young men.

“Young Master Ying, I can’t let the city guards make a move in bright moon city. Furthermore, the other party...”

The young man standing on the left had a change in expression as he spoke to the young man in the middle with a dark expression.

“I know!”

Young Master Ying nodded with a dark expression as he looked at the tightly shut door. “What an arrogant fellow!”

“I’m warning you. Don’t think that you can be arrogant just because you have the strength of a transcendent ninth rank. Don’t think that you’ll be safer in Bright Moon City either. Be careful!”

He said coldly to the door with a dark expression as he threatened.

“Haha, You’re Courting Death. Don’t come and disturb me. Otherwise, you have to be careful too!”

Hearing the threatening voice from outside, the corners of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly as he replied sarcastically.

“Alright, Alright. Just you wait!”

When young master Ying heard Wang Xian’s words from inside the room, his eyes were filled with killing intent. Following that, the corners of his mouth curled up slightly as he muttered sinisterly, “You dare to say such words to me? Interesting!”

When the two young men beside him saw his expression, their hearts trembled slightly.

The group of middle-aged men behind them looked at Wang Xian’s room in unison.

“Go and investigate them. I want to see who gave him the right to be arrogant!”

Young Master Ying said to the skinny middle-aged man behind him in a deep voice.

The skinny middle-aged man immediately nodded his head.

“This time, my father spent a huge amount of money to obtain a few lingwu fruits and nurtured two subordinates who are at the half-step void interpretation level. It’s just right for them to give it a try!”

Young Master Ying walked towards a room as he muttered to himself. A faint smile appeared on his face.

“That dragon Spike has brought us great pressure. However, fortunately, we have sir here. This time, we have added two half-step profound void martial stage powerhouses. In the future, the world will still be ours!”

The young man on his right said with some flattery.

“Humph, Dragon Spike? If he dares to enter another city, then we will play with them!”

Young master Ying’s eyes were sparkling. “But this time, my father has paid a huge price to obtain the Lingwu Fruit!”

“It’s definitely worth it for the reward!”

The young man on the right said hurriedly.

Young Master Ying smiled and looked at the room at the side again. “I don’t need to use my strongest strength to kill you. Many people have already forgotten that undercurrent is the king of assassins in star-moon Kingdom!”

...

“Who are those people?”

In the room, Feng Luan asked Wang Xian calmly. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“I don’t know. No matter who he is, it’s best that he doesn’t provoke me in the next few days. Otherwise...”

Wang Xian smiled. Otherwise, he would dare to kill him even if he was the prince of star-moon kingdom.

Then, he announced the arrival of the Dragon Assassin organization.

Time passed slowly and the Moon gradually rose. Bright Moon City was still bustling with activity at night.

The appearance of floating sea city caused many mercenary groups and powerful families to rush over.

At the seashore outside the city, star-moon kingdom sent a team of over a thousand experts to stand guard there, waiting for the formation to be activated.

“Clap Clap”

Around midnight, Feng Luan sat cross-legged on the bed to cultivate while Wang Xian sat cross-legged below. The faint sound of water could be heard suddenly.
