“Huh?”

Upon hearing the report from a civil official of the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly!

“Let’s go over and take a look first!”

As Wang Xian spoke, his body moved and he immediately flew out!

The Planet of the Main Dragon Palace was the planet of the three seas gate in the past. In order to prevent the destruction of this planet, Prime Minister Gui had shifted it to the side of the Dragon Planet not long ago. It was located within the coverage of the formation!

When Wang Xian flew into the sky, he swept his gaze across and noticed that numerous legions were slowly gathering in the void!

At the very front, an incomparably huge star-piercing sword was pointing at the Dragon Planet. It was emitting a cold metallic aura!

Around them, there were numerous gigantic war pets that were flapping their wings slightly and circling around the planet!

Above the war pets, there were many cold archers standing!

At the back, there were many experts standing on sharp swords. There were hundreds of thousands of them. Looking at them, it was awe-inspiring!

From all directions, there were many powerful legions gathered here!

There were millions of people in all directions, and each of them was not weaker than an eternal god Lord!

These were the core disciples of the six major forces!

“Dragon King, you’re finally back. The experts from the six major forces are attacking us. They deliberately hid the news and wanted to catch us off guard!”

The experts from the tiger turmoil demon nation noticed Wang Xian and flew towards him anxiously!

“Yes, don’t worry. They can’t break the formation of Dragon Star!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly!

“How should we deal with them now? Should we just watch them attack us?”

The old national advisor of the Chaotic Tiger Demon Nation asked with an embarrassed expression!

The planet had been destroyed, so they could only hide here. They were no different from stray dogs!

“Let Them Attack!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he looked at the people from the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation. “Everyone, don’t worry. They will pay a heavy price very soon. Don’t be anxious. Wait slowly. It will be quick!”

“With your words, Dragon King, we are much more assured!”

The leader of the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation smiled!

“Dragon King, we won’t make a move today, right? With our strength, we can totally...”

Ao Qitian and the rest hesitated for a moment before asking!

“If we don’t make a move, the enemy has at least eight level seven immortal king powerhouses. They won’t be able to stay!”

He shook his head slightly!

“Dragon King, the leaders have arrived!”

At this moment, Prime Minister Gui flew over, followed by the leaders of the Dragon Palace!

“Go to the dragon transformation pool. A few more thorny dragon species, starwood dragon species, Heavenly Thunder Earth fire dragon and Phoenix species will be coming over!”!

Wang Xian looked at the leaders and continued to instruct Prime Minister Gui!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded. Wang Xian moved his body and arrived in front of the dragon transformation pool of the Dragon Palace!

With a wave of his arm, he placed all the abyssal seed corpses to the side!

15 level 7 undying god King abyssal seed corpses, 40 level 6 undying god King abyssal seed corpses, and the remaining 1,000 or so abyssal seed corpses with different levels of strength!

With so many resources, it was enough for the Dragon Palace to increase the combat strength of at least 20 Level 7 undying God kings!

Once they increased their strength, the Dragon Palace would have the power to sweep across the entire star South Galaxy!

“Enter and increase your strength!”

Wang Xian said to the leaders of the Dragon Palace!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The leaders revealed extremely excited expressions as they entered the Dragon Transformation Pool!

“Dragon King, with so many resources, once we increase our strength, our dragon palace can completely destroy the six superpowers!”

Prime Minister Gui’s eyes sparkled as he said excitedly!

“Okay, let’s upgrade first!”

Wang Xian nodded his head!

“Hahaha, all the beasts from the Dragon Palace and the Tiger Demon Kingdom, come out and face your death!”

At this moment, an extremely violent voice spread across the entire starry sky. Everyone on the surrounding planets could hear it clearly!

When Wang Xian heard this voice, he raised his eyebrows slightly!

Seeing that the group of Dragon Palace members had started to improve, he moved his body and arrived at one of the nine planets in the sky above Dragon Planet!

As soon as he arrived, he could feel an extremely cold and violent aura!

He looked ahead and saw that star-piercing sword was located in the middle. There were more than a thousand immortal king level powerhouses standing on it!

There were ten star vultures around him, and there were archers standing on them!

...

Behind them were legions led by undying godly monarchs!

Looking over, there were around 2,000 undying godly monarchs!

The most eye catching ones were the 9 middle aged men at the forefront of piercing star sword. Their eyes were as bright as the stars, the thick killing intent causing the surrounding air to freeze!

The 9 middle aged men stared coldly at the planet in front of them!

“A bunch of trash, you want us to leave? If you have the guts, why don’t you attack us?”

“The six forces are attacking us. Don’t you feel ashamed of yourselves? HMPH, you are worse than animals!”

Not far away from them, an expert from the chaotic tiger demon nation pointed at them and cursed angrily!

Wang Xian smiled faintly and watched quietly!

“Hahaha, do you really think that we can’t break this formation? Dragon King, you dared to kill the experts and disciples of our Tianshan Sword sect. Today, it’s time for you to pay the price!”

On the star-piercing sword, an expert of the Tianshan Sword sect roared with a murderous look on his face!

“You two clamoring beasts, we will skin you later, Rip Off Your Bones, and put you in My Divine Kingdom!”

...

A ninth-grade heaven sect expert roared coldly!

“Humph, don’t talk so much nonsense with him. Just break the formation and charge in!”

The Sword King slowly pulled out his blood-colored sharp sword and said coldly!

“Alright, let’s break the formation. I want to see how many times this formation can withstand our attacks!”

Beside him, a Sky Mountain Sword sect patriarch said in a sinister tone!

“Last time, we were stopped by the formation. This time, with everyone here, it won’t be a problem to break the formation!”

A ninth grade sky sect patriarch said indifferently!

“In that case, get ready to attack!”

A patriarch of the Sky Mountain Sword sect took two steps forward, a huge sword appeared in his hand!

“Get ready to attack, break their array formation with one strike!”

The ninth grade sky sect leader raised the Thunder Hammer in his hand and roared!

“Yes!”

The millions of disciples shouted loudly and replied heavily!

“Rumble Rumble Rumble!”

In the next moment, a terrifying aura came from the front!

A few million warriors unleashed all of their auras, 2,000 undyings didn’t even bother to hide their auras, a terrifying aura rushed towards the planet ahead!

“Damn it, let’s hurry and escape, Hurry and teleport away!”

“Why are the nine grade Sky sect and Sky Mountain Sword sect’s six powers suddenly here, hiss, what a terrifying aura!”

“It’s too powerful. Almost all the experts of the six major forces are here. There must be at least two thousand of them. Let’s hurry and teleport to other planets. The Dragon Star is doomed, and so is the Dragon Palace!”

At the same time, hundreds of people in the dragon star who hadn’t left in time saw this scene and felt the terrifying aura coming from the sky. Their faces were filled with horror!

They all flew crazily toward the teleportation array and left as soon as possible!
