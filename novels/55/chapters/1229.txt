Are you satisfied now!

He stared at Wang Xian and his eyes were filled with a sinister look. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Everyone could feel the ice-cold chill that the eighth prince had towards Wang Xian.

The grin on his face was as though he wanted to devour Wang Xian.

“The eighth Prince is now a sworn enemy of that young man!”

“That’s right. The moment there’s a chance, the eighth prince will definitely kill that young man!”

The surrounding people whispered as they looked at the eighth Prince’s expression.

Even Long Xiaotian’s expression was slightly solemn.

In the Radiant Dragon Empire, the few princes who were comparable to him all had powerful backgrounds. A prince who was enraged was extremely terrifying.

Today, he was forced by Wang Xian to kill his subordinates in public. It was impossible for him not to take revenge.

As a prince, he couldn’t afford to lose face.

When Wang Xian saw the murderous look in his eyes and the determination on his face, a cold smile slowly appeared on his face.

“Not satisfied!”

Three words came out of his mouth. Beside Wang Xian, waves of Aura Rose.

“What?”

When Wang Xian said these three words, everyone was slightly stunned.

Even the eighth Prince’s face, which was filled with killing intent, was a little stiff.

“Haha, Eighth Prince, since you want to avenge your dead brother, you might as well take more revenge!”

Wang Xian stared at the eighth prince coldly and laughed out loud. “Idiot, since you want me to pay you back tenfold, I will make you suffer ten times more!”

“Kill, Kill For me!”

Wang Xian waved his hand and ordered.

“Roar!”

“Roar! Roar!”

With that order, the two beasts didn’t hesitate at all and attacked the eighth prince and his men.

At this moment, the eighth prince was completely stunned.

Everyone around was stunned. Even Long Xiaotian opened his mouth slightly.

“Since we have offended him, we should offend him more thoroughly. It’s best to beat him to death. This young man is not simple-minded!”

Around them, an insightful emptiness realm expert who was watching the show from a building had a glint in his eyes as he commented indifferently.

“Qingshan, go and fetch my good brother over. Don’t let him get hurt!”

Long Xiaotian’s eyes flickered as he said to Bai Qingshan who was standing at the side with a smile on his face.

“It’s the second Prince!”

Bai Qingshan took a deep look at Wang Xian and flew toward the eighth prince.

“Your Royal Highness the eighth Prince, come over here. Don’t get hurt!”

As he spoke, he waved his arm. A surge of energy wrapped around the eighth prince and pulled him over.

“You... How dare you? Stop! If you dare to kill my men, I, Long Xiaoyun, swear that I will not let you off. Stop!”

The eighth Prince regained his senses and roared at Wang Xian with bloodshot eyes. He was filled with killing intent.

Wang Xian stared at him. A hint of killing intent flashed in his eyes. “You Better Shut Up, Your Highness the eighth Prince!”

“You...”

Sensing Wang Xian’s killing intent, the eighth prince clenched his teeth tightly. His teeth were almost crushed.

“Ahhhh!”

A scream came from the side, causing the eighth prince to turn his head with bloodshot eyes. His heart was bleeding.

On the battlefield, the blood evil turtle was locked onto the insightful emptiness realm expert. It did not make a move.

Ling Zilin was crazily slaughtering the eighth Prince’s subordinates at the side.

How could that group of warriors who had not reached the insightful emptiness realm be a match for a insightful emptiness realm vicious beast.

Every strike killed more than ten people.

The insightful emptiness realm expert who was standing there was filled with helplessness.

He knew that the eighth Prince had provoked a ruthless person this time.

The other party wanted to completely kill all his subordinates.

He had painstakingly built up over a hundred subordinates and used an entire year’s time.

He had used almost half of his assets.

However, he had been annihilated in one move.

The death of these subordinates represented that the eighth Prince’s influence had been reduced to the extreme.

It was possible that any of the weaker princes would be stronger than his influence.

In this assessment, it would be ten times more difficult for the eighth prince to stand out.

The insightful void martial artist did not move, and neither did the blood evil turtle.

He knew that the opponent’s goal was to kill all of the eighth Prince’s subordinates.

He was doomed, completely doomed!

“Eighth brother, go back to the palace. Go back to the palace and have a good time!”

Long Xiaotian looked at the eighth prince’s number of subordinates decreasing rapidly. His face was full of smiles as he spoke to him indifferently.

The eighth Prince didn’t say anything with his blood-red eyes. Instead, he stared at Wang Xian with hatred.

In less than two minutes, the miserable shrieks had completely ended.

Ling Zilin swept his gaze across the surroundings and walked towards Wang Xian with his head slightly raised.

The blood evil turtle also slowly crawled over.

“The Dragon and Phoenix grocery store is opening today. Thank you for the Congratulatory Gift from His Highness the eighth Prince!”

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and looked at the tens of thousands of people gathered around him. He let out a light shout with a smile on his face.

“PFFT!”

When the eighth Prince heard Wang Xian’s words, he couldn’t help but spit out a mouthful of fresh blood. He almost fainted.

When he came, he was aggressive. He led more than a hundred subordinates and looked as though he was confident of killing Wang Xian.

However, all of his subordinates were killed. There was only one insightful void martial artist and himself.

There was a hint of despair in his dispirited expression.

How could he still be as high-spirited as before?

It could be said that today, the eighth Prince of the Light Dragon Empire was humiliated by that young man.

Everyone around looked at the eighth prince, then at Wang Xian, and finally at the Dragon and Phoenix grocery store. All of this was because of this small store.

When the crowd saw that the matter was over, they dispersed immediately.

They were all discussing this matter excitedly.

At the same time, a young man with two ferocious beasts and a dragon and Phoenix grocery store entered the sight of many people.

And today’s matter would definitely become a joke for the next period of time.

The crowd dispersed. Wang Xian gestured to Long Xiaotian and walked into the shop.

“AWOOO, awooo!”

At this moment, a cry was heard. Following that, Wang Xian sensed a figure flying towards him.

Wang Xian looked over and Xiao Ha flew onto his shoulder excitedly.

“Three-eyed spiritual dog Pup!”

Long Xiaotian looked at the pet that flew onto Wang Xian and revealed a hint of shock on his face. He sized up Xiao Ha carefully.

“A beauty is here!”

Wang Xian raised his head and looked ahead.

“Yes!”

Ling Jian ‘er saw Xiao ha flying directly onto Wang Xian’s shoulder. Her expression was a little ugly as she replied indifferently.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian didn’t mind such a cold face. In his opinion, this was a rich lady.

As he spoke, he grabbed Xiao Ha in his hand and walked straight into the dragon and Phoenix grocery store.

However, Long Xiaotian, who was standing beside Wang Xian, was stunned when he saw Ling Jian ‘ER’s figure.

He widened his eyes and was filled with shock.

When the eighth Prince saw Ling Jian ‘er, he was also slightly stunned. He looked at her and then at Wang Xian.

His expression was even uglier!
