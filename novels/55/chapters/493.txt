Chapter 494: The Goddess And The Divine Dragon

The sword and shield covered Adjaya’s back and top.

In two other directions, the old man stood silently in the middle with his Flaming Spear. Based on the speed he displayed previously and the horrifying destructive force he possessed, Adjaya had no chance of escaping.

Ahead of her, the old man carried a sword and shield and stared right at her.

Adjaya felt a little sorrow and desolation. Her eyes flickered. She couldn’t understand why she had not agreed to their conditions previously.

After all, all these things wouldn’t belong to her in the end.

Facing attacks from all directions, Adjaya held the truncheon tightly with both hands.

The strongest final strike!

Grrr!

A dragon roar reverberated across the sky.

The surrounding crowd was stunned. The roar that was filled with endless pressure sent chills down the Budding Realm experts’ spines.

Adjaya was astonished as she looked below her.

A horrifying existence was flying towards her while emitting scorching flames.

Adjaya was taken aback. Feeling the horrifying aura that even triumphed over the fire demon, her face turned serious.

The old man with a sword and shield and the old man with a long spear were surprised. Their pupils constricted and they stared fervently at this divine dragon from the East.

Grrr!

Another roar erupted across.

“Adjaya, I’m here! Come! Let’s finish them off!”

A voice entered the mind of Adjaya. In the instant she was distracted, she found herself surrounded by a seven to eight-meter-long Inferno Divine Dragon.

The Inferno Divine Dragon was none other than Wang Xian.

He circled around Adjaya and his noble dragon head remained above her.

Ka ka ka!

Above Adjaya, the shield fell on Wang Xian’s body and cracked like glass. A densely packed longsword with sapphire flames fell on him, causing crisp clashing sounds.

Wang Xian lowered his head slightly. His entire head alone was already larger than Adjaya’s body.

“Come up!”

Wang Xian wiggled his dragon whiskers and placed Adjaya on his back.

She looked blankly at Wang Xian with the truncheon still in her hands.

“It’s time for battle!”

The dragon whisker brushed past her face while Wang Xian spoke to her and stared right at the two old men.

When Adjaya regained her senses and saw Wang Xian below her, she was elated.

Holding the truncheon in her hands, she was standing on a divine dragon.

That’s a goddess! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian didn’t mind Adjaya standing behind her. He was accepting of the idea of a female dragon rider.

“Oh gosh. What... What’s that? A divine dragon from the East?”

On the beach, the crowd of martial artists was shocked to see the sudden appearance of the divine dragon and Adjaya standing on its back in her fiery-red dress.

The Goddess and the Divine Dragon!

The visual impact instantly made everyone dumbfounded.

“Divine dragon! Why would the invincible divine dragon of the East appear here? Could it be that a divine dragon was living within the Fire God’s Graveyard?”

The crowd made their guesses. Their eyes widened and were fixed on it.

“Divine dragon of the East...”

In a building a short distance away, the royalty of Dubai was exhilarated to see the appearance of the divine dragon.

“Why would a divine dragon of the East appear here suddenly? An existence like this is legendary even in China. Why would it appear to protect Adjaya?”

They had doubts in their minds. In the day, they had entered the Fire God Palace. There wasn’t any divine dragon in it.

Adallen had an idea and thought. However, he soon shook his head.

Grrr!

“Kill!”

In the sky above Fire Spirit Island, Wang Xian opened his dragon jaws and spewed dense flames on the old man with the sword and shield.

Lava-like flames reached him instantly.

The old man with the sword and shield was shocked and raised the shield in his hand immediately to block the flames.

However, Wang Xian had charged ahead at this moment. The dragon claw fell heavily onto the old man.

“Tsk! So what if there’s a divine dragon. Today, I’m going to slay a dragon!”

The old man with the sword and shield was emotionless. As he swung down the longsword in his hand, the Zero-degree Sapphire Heavenly Flame that spanned over dozens of meters was whipped towards Wang Xian.

Bam!

However, as the dragon claws clashed across, the longsword made from flames was shattered instantly. Without a loss in momentum, Wang Xian’s dragon claws slashed down on the old man.

“What!”

The old man was astonished. The dragon claw was exceptionally terrifying and reached his eyes instantly. He immediately raised his shield.

On the shield, a blue network of light glowed.

Bam!

However, the indestructible shield started cracking upon impact with the terrifying dragon claws.

The old man shot down towards Fire Spirit Island as though he was a falling meteorite.

Boom!

From thousands of meters above ground, the old man smashed into the Fire Spirit Island, causing a huge explosion.

“Flames. Thousand Severance!”

At this moment, a terrifying Flaming Spear lunged towards Wang Xian.

Adjaya, who was on his back, frowned and moved the truncheon in her hands immediately.

Bam!

Before Adjaya’s attack and defense were released, a dragon tail swept towards the spear.

The terrifying force made the old man throw up huge mouthfuls of blood. His Hukou pressure point was ripped apart directly. [1]

Adjaya was taken aback and looked in shock at Wang Xian who was below her. Her attention fell on his dragon scales that were glowing in a beautiful shade of red.

Seeing the majestic body, she couldn’t help but grab the horns on his head.

“Hey!” Wang Xian’s whisker brushed across Adjaya and he grumbled unhappily, “Watch your hands!”

“Alright, alright!”

Adjaya’s lips curved up slightly while her hair danced in the air as the wind ran through it.

Rumble!

Below them, the old man with the sword and shield flew up from the Fire Spirit Island and looked in shock at Wang Xian.

There was a dense network of cracks on the shield he was carrying.

The old man held his spear with shaking arms. He looked to Wang Xian before turning to the old man with the sword and shield.

They exchanged glances and looked to the other three people from Nether Flame that were keeping the fire demon occupied. Instantly, they made their decision!

“Everyone from Fire God Denomination, leave!”

“Everyone from Heavenly Flame Denomination, leave!”

The two of them didn’t hesitate a moment as they fled.

When their voices dissipated, they had disappeared from sight.

“What?”

In the sky near them, the three people from Nether Flame that were stuck in a battle with the fire demon saw them leaving. Instantly, their faces turned bitter.

When their eyes fell on the majestic divine dragon of the East and Adjaya who was on it, their faces were exceptionally solemn.

“Kill those scum from the Nether Flame!”

When Wang Xian saw the old man with a sword and shield and the old man with the long spear escaping, he didn’t give chase.

With the speed of the two of them, it would be hard for Wang Xian to catch and kill them.

At this stage, if an expert were to flee with all his might, it would be hard to kill him unless there was an overwhelming difference in strength.

However, Wang Xian was burning with killing intent towards the Nether Flame.

It was especially so towards the old hag or their Deity Lady.

Grrrr, grrr!

When the fire demon saw his master and Wang Xian approaching, he was ecstatic. He roared enthusiastically and smashed the Flaming Sledge Hammer towards the void space.

Weng!

The hollow flames appeared and swarmed towards the charcoal-black old man.

“Kill!” Adjaya cried out furiously. Lifting the truncheon in her hands, the volcano below her erupted.

Endless lava swept towards the group from the Nether Flame.

Wang Xian tumbled, made an arc across the night sky and grabbed towards the old hag with his dragon claws.
