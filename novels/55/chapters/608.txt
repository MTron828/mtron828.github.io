Chapter 609: Dragon King?

Boom!

After a day of sitting beside Wang Xian with his legs crossed, Roving Sword opened his eyes as he sensed a daunting aura emanating out from his body.

With a swing, Wang Xian surrounded him with water energy as he fixed his eyes on Roving Sword.

Five illusory longswords were spinning around him at a domineering speed. Wang Xian looked to the side and was surprised to see the longswords at the side were shaking violently.

“Hur? He can even vibrate Level 12 spiritual swords? It looks like something is odd about Roving Sword’s strength!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes in astonishment.

“Dragon King!”

At this time, Roving Sword greeted Wang Xian respectfully while he stood up and looked at Wang Xian.

“Mm, what kind of art are you practicing? The strength seemed odd when you attained your breakthrough!” Wang Xian said to Roving Sword, as he was taken aback.

“Merciless Swordsmanship. Dragon King, my Merciless Swordsmanship has advanced to Level 13, the lower-class Immortal realm.”

“Lower-class Immortal? Are there different classes for Immortal Level too?”

An unexpected radiance flashed in his eyes.

“Yes. The beginning of the Immortal Realm after advancement is known as lower-class Immortal. After a full-mastery of high-class battle techniques, it is known as middle-class Immortal. After converting battle techniques to a Superpower, it would be known as upper-class Immortal. Anything beyond this is not within my knowledge!” Roving Sword explained to Wang Xian.

“I didn’t know that Immortal Realm was divided into three levels!” Wang Xian nodded his head slowly. “You may go back now. I’ll also enter the Yong Chang cauldron a few days from now!”

“Yes, Dragon King. I’ll come in as a champion in this grand contest!” said Roving Sword plainly to Wang Xian.

“Mm!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile. Given Roving Sword’s current strength, getting the champion in this grand contest was a piece of cake.

No one, except for the Immortals of Yong Chang, could be a match for him!

After Roving Sword left, Wang Xian continued to refine his Spiritual Equipment.

“Elder Wang!”

Five disciples called out to Wang Xian, who was refining equipment in the mountain three days later.

“What is it?” asked Wang Xian expressionlessly. He was ready to continue with his refinery.

“Elder Wang, today’s the last day of the grand contest of the three Immortal Sects. It’s also the day when the announcement will be made for the top thirty. At that time, they will be revealing the names of disciples who will be able to enter Yong Chang cauldron. The Great Elder wants us to inform you to make a trip over!” a disciple said respectfully to Wang Xian.

“Hur? Last day?”

Wang Xian nodded and stored his materials. “Fine, let’s go then. Where is it? Lead the way, will you?”

“Yes, Elder Wang. I heard that Elder Wang will be able to enter Yong Chang cauldron. Congratulations!”

That disciple spoke with envy.

Wang Xian nodded his head impassively as he followed behind and headed to Yong Chang Immortal Sect.

“Senior brother Ge Wen, go for it!”

“Senior brother Hong, go for it!”

“Senior brother Jin Jian, go for it!”

Wang Xian could hear cheering voices even when he was a thousand meters away from the grand contest arena.

Wang Xian swept his gaze across and spotted where Da Hong Immortal Sect was. He immediately hovered to the elders’ side.

“Elder Wang is here!”

The elders of Da Hong Immortal Sect were sitting on a small hill beside the grand contest arena. Upon seeing Wang Xian’s arrival, they immediately greeted him with broad smiles.

Today is the day where the top five would become known. This was the grand contest that involved all the disciples of Yong Chang Immortal Sect. At this time, none of the elders of Da Hong Immortal Sect would miss it.

“Greetings to Great Elder, Second Great Elder, and the elders!”

Wang Xian cupped his fists to each of the elders.

“Elder Wang, the grand contest of three major Immortal Sects will be over once the top five is out. At that time, you’ll also need to go to the stage as one of the candidates who will be entering the Yong Chang cauldron. Let all the disciples of Yong Chang world know about you!” said the Great Elder to Wang Xian.

“Sure!”

Entering the Yong Chang cauldron was a great opportunity for everyone. Only thirteen people in fifty years could do so.

After today’s grand contest was over, they could enter the cauldron tomorrow.

Three default disciples would also enjoy the same glory as the top ten disciples.

“Who are the top five currently?”

Wang Xian looked at the arena with curiosity as he asked the Great Elder beside him.

“Hehe, the results will only be determined after the battle of Roving Sword and Jin Jian of Immortal Slaying Sect!”

The Great Elder chuckled as he pointed to the two people in the field.

“Hur?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian looked over. Sure enough, Roving Sword and another man who had a sharp profile were battling.

“Haha!”

Wang Xian chuckled as he looked to the fiery column at one side. On it was a ranking.

The first to sixth positions were not finalized yet, while the rest of the disciples had already become fixed.

“Hur?”

At this time, Wang Xian sensed a gaze looking at him, scrutinizing him from head to toe.

He raised his eyebrows and spun around, looking at one elder on the mountain.

When that elder looked over at Wang Xian, there was no concealment to his cold-looking eyes.

“I remember there was an elder from Da Hong Immortal Sect among those families who tried to assassinate me the other night. It looks like he’s the one!”

A tinge of coldness flashed in Wang Xian’s eyes.

“Roving Sword is going to win. This is totally unexpected. Jin Jian has always been the top disciple of Immortal Slaying Sect. No one expected that the disciple who just joined Immortal Slaying Sect could defeat him. The top five will be confirmed!”

At this time, an elder exclaimed from the side.

Wang Xian followed his gaze. True enough, the longsword of Roving Sword had slashed that young man, leaving a long wound on his body. After which he pointed the cold-looking sword at him.

Jin Jian was looking dreadful while the arm that was grabbing the longsword was trembling. “Where did you get your Level 12 Spiritual Equipment?” he bellowed in a low voice with a twisted expression.

Roving Sword ignored him entirely as he moved back to his position.

If he displayed his full strength, Jin Jian would have been defeated in one stroke!

“Fine!”

Seeing that Roving Sword was unconcerned with his questions, Jin Jian’s face was as black as coal. He made a move and hovered to a small mountain.

“This is totally unexpected. Jin Jian, you actually lost to a disciple who just joined Immortal Slaying Sect. You’re losing your title as the number one disciple in the sect!”

Just as Jin Jian arrived at that mountain, a young man’s taunting voice rang in his ears.

“If not for the fact that he possesses a Level 12 spiritual sword, he would definitely not be my match!” said Jin Jian coldly with a gloomy look.

“Hehe, don’t you have a Level 12 spiritual sword too?”

That young man chuckled, revealing a tinge of curiosity on his face. “Did you guys from Immortal Slaying Sect say you would stop him from entering the Yong Chang cauldron? Besides, he doesn’t have any friends. Where did he get his Level 12 spiritual sword from?”

“How would I know?”

Jin Jian’s expression sank as he tightened his grip on his spiritual sword.

“I know it was the Dragon King. He was the one who refined it!”

At this time, Ao Shuwen’s voice cut through the air.

He looked at the spiritual swords in Hong Tianda and Piao Lingxue’s hands. “The swords in Senior brother Hong and Junior Sister Piao’s hands were refined by Dragon King!”

“Dragon King?”

Yet, what Ao Shuwen said stunned the two people beside him.

Xiao Xiao and the Guild Leader of Sacred Followers Guild.

When they heard the name, there was a trace of doubt flashing across their eyes.
