Chapter 542: Void Space Shattered? (1)

Pa pa pa!

“What? This...”

“What a horrifying sword! I could barely control the longsword in my hand!”

In an instant, all the surrounding swordsman felt their treasured swords shaking violently. They held onto their longswords in horror while looking ahead of them.

Two sword strikes. Charge and return!

They were from two different people.

Argh!

When the sword was released, the group of subordinates behind the Lord of Sea Serpent Island were instantly killed by the Returning Sword.

They couldn’t put up any resistance at all. That terrifying edge easily penetrated their bodies.

“What?”

The Lord of Sea Serpent Island was flabbergasted. The moment the two swords appeared, a deathly threat had him surrounded and sent chills down his spine.

“No... Father, save me!”

At this moment, the Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island cried for help in horror.

“No! Dragon Sect, I won’t let you off even if I die!”

The Lord of Sea Serpent Island held onto the two horns and roared loudly with a contorted expression resembling a wretched demon.

Terrifying water energy was contained within the two horns. He spread both of his arms towards the approaching swords from the front and back.

The Charging Sword and the Returning Sword were simply too fast.

There was no time for the Lord of Sea Serpent Island to escape.

Moreover, he had his son with him. He couldn’t just leave him behind.

Hai Long stood before the Lord of Sea Serpent Island, shivering in fear.

Rumble!

Two extreme swords emitted dazzling golden light that shrouded the Lord of Sea Serpent Island and his son.

“Argh! I’m not convinced!”

A blinding light exploded from where Hai Jiao was. The surrounding crowd couldn’t help but shut their eyes and turn their heads around.

“Nothing! Nothing is left!”

At this moment, a surprised scream broke the silence. Everyone turned towards the location where the Lord of Sea Serpent Island was previously.

All of them were dumbfounded.

Nothing. There was indeed nothing left.

There were no signs of humans at all.

“The Lord of Sea Serpent Island was completely crushed by the sword swords! Not even his ashes remain.”

A Dan Realm expert from a Sacred Clan was filled with horror as he looked blankly at where Hai Jiao was standing previously.

“What a terrifying sword glow. They... They are all terrifying Dan Realm experts. Why would there be so many terrifying experts appearing from the Dragon Sect?”

A sect leader of a Sacred Sect looked in the direction of the Dragon Sect while shivering in fear.

The two middle-aged men that had struck previously put away their swords.

With a sword from each of them, they had killed the previous number two expert of the Underworld.

Gulp!

Everyone couldn’t help but swallow back a mouthful of saliva.

“Is this the full strength of the Dragon Sect. How many Dan Realm experts do they have?”

Cold sweat broke out on the foreheads of some people.

Nie Wuya and the experts from Dong Hua Sacred Sect could feel their hearts palpitating violently as their vision dulled.

They were afraid that the Dragon Sect would target them now and annihilate the entire Dong Hua Sacred Sect.

They were even more afraid after seeing how terrifying the Dan Realm swordsmen from the Dragon Sect were. That would only mean that the supreme swordsman fighting with their sect leader was even more insane.

Would their sect leader win against that swordsman in battle?

“Amitabha. It’s better for the Underworld to have fewer killings! Amitabha!”

At the location of Diabolism, all the devil sects could feel their hearts skip a beat when they witnessed the two experts from the Dragon Sect killing a powerful Dan Realm expert with a sword each.

Even the powerful Dan Realm experts from the Devil Corpse Palace were deeply fearful.

As for the devil monks from the Devil Spirits Temple, they could only recite “Amitabha” and pray.

At this moment, everyone in the crowd was looking towards Dragon Sect in fear.

“Too strong. Too strong. Even without the Dragon King, the disciples of the Dragon Sect could still crush the entire Underworld. No one would be a match for them!”

In a deserted area at the bottom of the tallest peak of Huashan, Xun’er had become the most frenzied fan of the Dragon Sect.

She exclaimed loudly with excitement.

The lady beside her pursed her lips and was filled with astonishment.

Despite the Dragon King being engaged in battle, the remaining Dragon Sect could still suppress the entire Underworld.

This was the most fearsome thing about the Dragon Sect.

“Oh gosh! Look! What’s that? What’s that? The void space is shattering! Their battles are shattering the void space?”

At this moment, an exclamation broke the silence and caught everyone’s attention.

The crowd immediately looked over.

At this moment, Nie Wushuang and Roving Sword had entered into close-range battle mode in the air.

Within a radius of a thousand meters of their battle, dense sword glows filled the air.

Both their bodies were emitting golden rays like a blinding sun.

Each clash would crush the surrounding sword glows. The terrifying battle closely resembled the coming of Ragnarök.

Bam!

Once again, Nie Wushuang clashed together with Roving Sword.

Terrifying metal attribute energy tore an opening in the void space.

This tear was roughly a meter long. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

When the tear appeared, even Nie Wushuang was filled with horror.

He looked in horror at the world within the tear in the void space. Subconsciously, he recalled a record he had read in a secret book previously.

“Could it be?”

Nie Wushuang’s eyes constricted as he shouted, “Argh!”

Bam!

It was another violent clash followed by Nie Wushuang and Roving Sword separating rapidly.

Huh?

Roving Sword had also noticed that terrifying tear in the void space. Doubt filled his eyes.

“Oh gosh! That’s really a tear in the void space. It is said that when one reaches the Immortal Realm, he can rip a tear in the void space. Could their battle be the reason why the void space was ripped apart?”

Below the battle, the crowd couldn’t help but exclaim after witnessing the tear.

This was a tear in the void space!

“A tear in the void space? No. Budding Realm experts would never be able to rip a tear in void space. Even Immortal Realm experts would find it to be extremely difficult to do so!”

The Dan Realm experts stared vigilantly at the one-meter-long tear. All of them were shocked.

Undoubtedly, there was indeed a tear in the void space.

Boom!

At this moment, Wang Xian controlled the Nether Skull.

From the eyes of the Nether Skull, extreme flames from the Inferno Divine Dragon and the will-o-wisps had coalesced. The combined flames were extremely viscous and thick as they swept towards Emperor Qi, who had used the Binary Corpses Co-genesis.

Rumble!

Emperor Qi’s terrifying claws fell on the surface of the Nether Skull. The terrifying impact sent earth-shattering shockwaves across.

After each collision, a crack would appear before them.

A tinge of surprise and shock flashed in Emperor Qi’s blood-red eyes. He pivoted and appeared a thousand meters away within seconds while staring at that tear.

Wang Xian also frowned as he observed the tear in the void space.

Their battle had torn the fabric of space?

Wang Xian was doubtful. The tear appeared for one second and disappeared in the next.

“Could their terrifying battle reach the level where they could rip apart the fabric of space?”

Seeing the cracks of space between the battle of Emperor Qi and the Dragon King, the crowd from the Underworld was dumbfounded.
