2844 2844, invincible in combat

After chatting with Ye lui Ying and the rest for a while, Wang Xian returned to the pavilion.

The three of them didn’t dare to follow him to the pavilion. They could see that they were still in awe of their master.

Wang Xian returned to the pavilion and took out the communication stone plate. He opened it and started to check it.

The function of this communication stone plate was no different from the artificial intelligence of the Imperial Star Field.

Entertainment, current events, and various other things were all the same.

There were not many humans in the eight desolates and six harmonies. It was not even 1% , 1/1000, or even 1/10,000 of the humans in other star fields.

There were only over 10,000 planets on the continent where humans lived.

The communication stone plate was made by the largest force here, the eight desolates.

Wang Xian looked at the information on it. There were all kinds of information about the various secret realms in the eight desolates. There was also information about a certain expert who had broken into the eight desolates and six harmonies.

There was also information about the battles in certain places.

The eight barrens and six directions was very small, but there were a large number of experts gathered here.

Therefore, the interesting things here were not small either.

“The disciple of the god Emperor of Shangshui is unrivalled in his battle techniques. Once he was born, he defeated a few core disciples of the eight barrens. He is unrivalled in the younger generation.”

“The Peerless Beauty is unrivalled in her battle techniques. She is incomparably handsome and earth-shaking. She is the last disciple of the god Emperor of Shangshui. She will be the brightest star of the eight barrens and six directions in the future.”

When Wang Xian browsed through the messages, he suddenly saw two posts.

When he saw the names on the posts, he was slightly stunned. His entire being revealed an extremely astonished expression.

Invincible in battle techniques?

What a familiar name. Especially the title of these two posts. No matter how he looked at it, it seemed to be someone’s own operation back then.

Invincible in battle techniques. That narcissistic and Coquettish Fellow from the Tian Ze continent’s battle techniques aristocratic clan back then.

He was also the guy who had the best relationship with Wang Xian when he entered this dazzling world.

Invincible in battle techniques had a powerful bloodline. He was taken away by a powerful force back then.

At that time, Wang Xian thought that he was taken away by an expert from the imperial court.

However, he used the power of the Dragon Palace to inquire about it later. There was no such person in the imperial court.

This made him slightly curious. After a long time, Wang Xian had almost forgotten about this guy.

Opening the two posts, Wang Xian took a look and could tell at a glance that this was a post by the invincible God of war.

In the past, this fellow had done the same thing when he was in the Tianze continent.

The post was nothing more than bragging that he was a peerless spoiled child, the brightest star in the future of the land of desolation, and the invincible god-emperor in the future.

He looked, could not help but smile, and then a search, found the invincible personal home page.

“If Heaven does not give birth to me, I will be invincible in battle, and I will be like the Eternal Night!”

Looking at the introduction on the personal homepage, Wang Xian can already be 100% sure that it is this narcissistic sultry guy.

“But how did this guy get from the imperial star field to the eight desolates and six harmonies here? Could it be that the one who took him in as a disciple was this god Emperor of Shangshui?”

Wang Xian revealed a curious expression as he thought to himself. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Becoming the disciple of a god Emperor, this invincible battle technique was doing very well.

Furthermore, he got a piece of news from the two posts. Invincible battle technique now had the strength of a level seven immortal king.

At this age, this kind of strength could be said to be very strong.

With a powerful master and a powerful strength, invincible battle technique had become unrestrained.

However, the information on the homepage had only been updated half a year ago. It should have only become active in this half a year.

“Hehe, it’s really fate!”

Speaking of which, when he saw the information on invincible in battle techniques, he somewhat missed this guy.

He would find a time to catch up with this guy.

“Ah Qiu!”

At the same time, in an incomparably luxurious palace, a handsome and dignified young man with a slightly raised head sneezed.

“Which Pretty Lady is thinking of me?”

He mumbled and flicked his long hair. He walked towards the group of people with a warm smile on his face. His gaze landed on an extremely beautiful lady.

…

Inside the Blue Moon planet, Wang Xian held the holy feather and walked into the room.

The Blue Moon planet was what Wang Xian learned from the communication stone plate. It was the name of the planet he was currently on.

After entering the room and nurturing the holy feather, Wang Xian was fine. He continued to look at the various messages on the communication stone plate.

“Is little brother Wang Xian around?”

Not long after, a voice was heard.

Wang Xian’s mind stirred. Sensing that it was ye Lui Ying and the other two, he opened the door and walked out.

“Hello, May I know what’s the matter?”

Looking at the three of them, Wang Xian asked.

“It’s nothing. Handsome Wang Xian, you’re really a sly one. Let’s go, we’ll bring you out for supper and show you around!”

“The night on the Blue Moon is the most beautiful!”

Ye Lui Ying waved at her and said with a smile.

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment and nodded. “Alright, thank you very much.”

“You don’t have to be so polite, little brother Wang Xian.”

The composed fifth brother said with a smile.

“Let’s go, Let’s Go!”

Ye lui Ying urged Wang Xian and walked out excitedly.

In the night sky outside, there was a blue moon hanging on it. This couldn’t be called a moon.

The so-called blue moon in the sky was the Yingtian Sea, a sea of emptiness.

Under the illumination of the Yingtian Sea, the night was indeed very beautiful.

“Let’s go, let’s go. We’ll bring you to eat something very delicious.”

Ye lui Ying said happily and brought him out for a stroll.

Wang Xian also had nothing to do and followed them to eat delicious food.

In the following period of time, Ye Lui Ying, who was familiar with him, would occasionally pull him out to play.

From time to time, she would persuade Wang Xian to acknowledge her as his master. This way, she would not be a junior sister anymore.

The three of them had good temperaments. Wang Xian gradually became familiar with them.

During the day, Ye Lui Ying’s Master spent two hours comprehending the holy feather every day. Wang Xian could sense some changes in her body.

Perhaps, this woman could really break through to the Celestial Emperor Realm.

“Are you going to enter the windless forest on the windless day in five days?”

Nearly three months passed very quickly. On this day, the woman with the surname Hong Feng under the pavilion suddenly spoke to Wang Xian.

Hong Feng was the surname of the woman. Wang Xian had heard it from ye Lui Ying. He didn’t know the exact name.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded. He had stayed here for so long just to wait for the arrival of the windless day and enter the windless forest again.

“This time, you will go with my disciples. I will ask them to take care of you.”

The woman continued.

“There’s no need for that.”

Wang Xian shook his head.

The woman frowned slightly when she heard his refusal. She felt that the young man in front of her was a little stubborn.

“How about this? You control the wind. I will take a look at your strength and your understanding of the wind.”

After a few seconds of silence, the woman spoke.

“HMM?”

Wang Xian looked at her in astonishment.

“It’s alright. Show me what you’ve got. Let me take a look!”

The woman stared at him and spoke again.
