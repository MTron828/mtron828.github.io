Chapter 1585: One thousand five hundred and eighty-five hundred and eighty-five hundred thousand dead bodies, and ten thousand miles of blood

“Bastard, die! My sect will definitely behead you!”

Screams of pain rang out from the surroundings. Even the elders of the sect, who were at level six of the Seethrough void stage, could not withstand a single strike from the Abyss Demonic Dragon.

The Violent Demonic Dragon, the terrifying demonic flames, and even the violent power of darkness swept past, causing the deaths of many disciples of the sect.

When the supreme elder of the sect saw Wang Xian’s murderous look, he was furious.

A green wind radiance enveloped his entire body.

“Dharma Idol, Storm Blade!”

At this moment, the supreme elder of the sect did not dare to restrain himself. He unleashed all the power in his body.

A terrifying storm formed around him. At the center of the storm, the wind blade was spinning.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The sound of mountains being torn apart rang out in the surroundings. The two mountains that were thousands of meters tall on both sides were directly turned into sharp rocks by the wind blades.

Some of the disciples of the Soleheart sect and the people from the Ice Heart Empire were even directly crushed by the wind blades when they weren’t able to dodge in time.

The area affected by a battle between experts was simply too large.

When it came to a real battle, there was no time to care about the weak.

Screams of pain rang out instantly. In an instant, thousands of people died in the aftermath of his dharma idol.

Everyone fled into the distance in panic. They wished they could grow a pair of wings.

“Explode!”

Wang Xian’s pitch-black pupils were like an abyss. At the location of his heart, the heart of Light and darkness, the glow of darkness flourished and almost completely covered the traces of light.

An unceasing stream of dark energy surged into his entire body, causing each of Wang Xian’s attacks to be unusually violent.

The incomparably huge dark dragon claw clawed directly at the Supreme Elder of the solipsistic sect.

The violent darkness contained within collided heavily with the storm blades, resulting in a terrifying explosion.

A Shockwave was sent out in all directions.

Buzz

At this moment, the people nearby seemed to have lost their voices.

The two mountains that were thousands of meters tall collapsed immediately, and the ground collapsed more than ten meters deep.

The collision of the terrifying energy caused the entire space to tremble.

“Break!”

When the supreme elder of the solipsistic sect saw this scene, his expression was extremely unsightly.

The storm blades were neutralized, and the terrifying dragon claws were still present. He waved his hands with an extremely unsightly expression.

A terrifying hurricane force wanted to lift Wang Xian into the sky to fight.

In less than five minutes, the foundation of the entire sect would be reduced to ruins.

“Is that all you have? Then go to Hell!”

Wang Xian stared coldly at the supreme elder of the sect. His huge dragon mouth opened slowly.

“Dragon head to the world!”

“Roar!”

A dragon head that was three to four kilometers in size appeared in the sky. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The eyes that were the size of a house and four long dark dragon whiskers were like monsters from another world.

A dragon roar shook the entire ruins of the divine kingdom.

Wang Xian opened his huge dragon mouth and swallowed the supreme elder of the sect who was like an ant.

“Damn it!”

The supreme elder of the Solitaire sect looked at the dragon mouth that was a few kilometers in size. He felt as though a huge abyss was swallowing him.

It was the first time he had encountered such a terrifying creature.

With a body size of a few kilometers, a small-scale attack could not cause any damage to his body.

However, a large-scale attack would consume too much energy. If it landed on his body, he would only be able to withstand the attack of the opponent.

This made him feel a trace of fear in his heart.

He was the supreme elder of the Solitaire sect. His strength was among the best among those of the same level.

“A heavenly wind has descended from the sky. The earth has risen and the terrain has risen. Break for me!”

The supreme elder of the solitaire sect gritted his teeth. Ten giant cyan swords shot into the sky. Ten giant cyan swords plunged into the earth.

The wind rose and the earth shook. A terrifying cyan light condensed in the middle.

The cyan glow floated in the air for a total of two to three thousand meters.

The wind currents in the cyan glow surged at a speed that could tear through everything. It met the attack of the dragon’s mouth directly.

“Roar! Roar!”

“10,000-mile Dragon Body!”

Wang Xian did not dodge at all. He went straight for the terrifying cyan glow to devour it.

“Hiss, this... This is F * cking unbelievable. It directly devoured the Dharma Idol of the solicitous sect’s level eight Seethrough Expert!”

“Oh my God, look at the body of that Sky Demon. What kind of dharma idol does the sky demon cultivate? How can it be so terrifying!”

At this moment, the experts of the Wuji Empire, the He clan, and the other forces arrived at a place more than 10 kilometers away from the battlefield.

Seeing that the sky demon directly swallowed the green light, all of them had shocked expressions on their faces.

Especially when they saw the dragon body behind the heavenly devil expanding at a terrifying speed.

It expanded to an area of seven to eight kilometers.

Three to four kilometers of Dragon Balls, three to four kilometers of dragon heads, and seven to eight kilometers of dragon bodies.

Such a terrifying Colossus, even with a light sweep, possessed terrifying destructive power!

“Hiss, this...”

When the supreme elder of the solipsistic sect saw the dharma idol being devoured, his expression was extremely ugly.

When the entire Dharma Idol was devoured, his expression changed drastically when he saw the dragon mouth that covered an area of a few kilometers heading towards him.

“Too strong!”

He quickly dodged to the side with an ugly expression. His body shook and a pair of green wings appeared on his back.

“Crash!”

However, at this moment, pitch-black chains in the sky swept towards him.

“Not good!”

The supreme elder of the lone sect revealed a trace of fear in his eyes as he slashed out with his swords towards the black chains.

“Roar!”

However, in just an instant, he felt his surroundings turn dark as a violent energy charged towards him.

His expression was filled with shock, as though he had entered a black hole and wanted to rush out.

However, the violent dark energy was like an ocean, directly annihilating him.

“A Level 8 profound void martial artist has fallen, hiss ~”

“A Level 8 profound void martial artist, other than those who died of natural causes, it has been over a thousand years since such an ancestor level expert died!”

“This Skyfiend’s strength is really terrifying. Even a level 8 profound void martial artist can be killed so quickly!”

When the surrounding people saw the supreme elder of the lone sect being devoured, their expressions instantly changed.

They were discussing in shock.

The eighth level of the Seethrough realm could be considered to be an expert that could suppress an area of 100,000 kilometers in the transcendence continent. Now, he was actually killed.

This allowed everyone to have a deeper understanding of the strength of the Sky Demon.

“Roar!”

“Boom! Boom!”

With a roar, Wang Xian’s body, which was more than 10 kilometers long, landed on the ground. The entire area of the soleheart sect was in a mess.

His gigantic dragon eyes stared at the two patriarchs of the Iceheart Empire in the sky.

“Run, Run Now!”

Being stared at by the gigantic dragon eyes, the hearts of the two patriarchs of the Iceheart Empire, who were facing the hunchbacked old man, pounded violently.

Without any hesitation, they fled into the distance frantically.
