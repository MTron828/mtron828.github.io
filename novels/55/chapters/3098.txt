Chapter 3099: Under the 3098 Battle Angel

In just an instant, the surrounding people did not sense that a battle angel at the peak of the Celestial Emperor Realm had fallen into Wang Xian’s hands.

“There shouldn’t be any battle angel at the third level. I can sweep across a large area.”

After Wang Xian suppressed it, he kept it into his interspatial ring and narrowed his eyes slightly. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

With the might of the five elements millstone, it would not be a problem for him to instantly suppress seven to eight battle angels at the peak of the Divine Emperor Realm.

There should not be many battle angels at the peak of the third level of the divine emperor realm.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

Crack! Crack! Crack

At the thought of this, he looked at the Five Elements Millstone. The five elements millstone changed slowly and enveloped the sky above the thousands of battle angels.

Crisp cracking sounds rang out as the 1,000 boxes cracked open. The battle angels in the boxes slowly opened their icy-cold eyes.

Buzz

A palm emitted from the five elements millstone. It grabbed all the battle angels in its gray palm.

The powerful force confined the battle angels one by one, making them unable to move.

Wang Xian waved his arm again and the core cores of the battle angels flew towards his hand.

“Three ninth-level celestial thearch level battle angels.”

Sensing the information in the cores, he narrowed his eyes slightly and stored the over 1,000 battle angels into the mother nest.

“What?”

At the side, senior brother Lu and the rest were shocked when they saw Wang Xian suppressing over 1,000 battle angels. At the same time, they looked a little embarrassed.

The more Wang Xian obtained, the less they could obtain.

“Hiss, junior brother Wang Xian is so powerful. He managed to suppress more than a thousand of them at once. Among those thousand of them, there is definitely a ninth level divine emperor battle Angel.”

“Junior brother Wang Xian’s strength is too strong!”

Senior Sister Lingxin and the rest looked over. Their eyes were filled with shock.

The rest of the disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect were also stunned.

“Junior brother Wang Xian is really strong!”

Senior Brother Junzi sighed slightly and continued to suppress the battle angels one by one.

“Should we…”

Senior brother Lu exchanged a glance with the two peak divine emperor powerhouses from the same race. Their eyes were burning as they looked at the battle angels in front of them.

“Speed Up!”

They made up their minds and took out one divine weapon after another. They attacked the Battle Angel Box in front of them directly.

This time, they attacked twenty of them at once.

When they felt the power of twenty battle angels, their eyes revealed an excited look, and they immediately moved to suppress them.

“Let’s continue!”

Seeing that Wang Xian continued to attack, senior sister Lingxin and the rest of the female disciples also shifted their gaze and said.

“Senior sister, should we destroy a few more battle angels?”

A female disciple could not help but ask.

“Sure!”

Senior Sister Lingxin glanced at Wang Xian, senior brother Kong, and the rest. She pondered for a moment and nodded.

“Then let’s take these five!”

The long whip in the hands of a female disciple directly attacked the boxes of the five battle angels.

Crack! Crack! Crack

The boxes were broken and the five battle angels slowly opened their eyes.

Senior Sister Lingxin and the others immediately took out their divine weapons, preparing to launch a joint attack.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The five battle angels opened their eyes, and waves of powerful might radiated from their bodies.

“Oh?”

“This might?”

Suddenly, the few female disciples in front couldn’t help but retreat backward, their faces pale.

Their eyes revealed a look of fear.

Senior Martial Sister Lingxin’s expression also changed drastically as she shouted, “Oh no, there are still two ninth level divine emperor battle angels. Retreat!”

“Senior Martial brothers, request for reinforcements!”

A female disciple’s expression changed drastically as she pleaded for help.

“Wait!”

At the side, senior martial brother Lu, senior martial brother Kong, Senior Martial Brother Junzi, and the others saw the situation and their expressions changed slightly.

However, because they had increased their speed to suppress the battle angels, they were unable to take action for a short period of time.

“Holy Light!”

A voice without the slightest bit of emotion came out from the mouths of the five battle angels.

Especially the two ninth level divine emperor battle angels. When they took action, they instantly enveloped the group of more than ten female students.

The terrifying attack caused senior martial sister Lingxin and the others to turn pale.

“It’s over!”

A few female disciples revealed horrified expressions. Their faces were extremely pale.

The attacks of the two rank nine divine emperor battle angels were something that they could not withstand with their strength.

Among the over a dozen of them, the strongest senior martial sister Lingxin was only at the rank nine divine emperor realm. Moreover, she could only display one-tenth of her strength in the mystic realm.

When Mi Xinlu saw this terrifying attack, her face turned pale as well. She hurriedly looked to the side.

“Boom!”

Before the holy light descended, soil appeared out of thin air beneath the five battle angels. The soil directly covered them, leaving only a small point of their core.

Soon after, an earthy yellow shield appeared in front of the Holy Light and easily blocked it.

“Do what you can.”

The one who attacked was Ao tu. He swept his gaze across the group of girls and said indifferently.

“Thank you, Uncle Ao Tu.”

Mo Xinlu looked over and a smile appeared on his face. He immediately expressed his gratitude.

“Eh?”

Senior Sister Lingxin and the others recovered from their shock and immediately looked over at Ao Tu.

Ao Tu lay there quietly with a battle-like appearance. His body emitted a thick and heavy aura.

Ao Fenghuang, who was at the side, swept his gaze around indifferently.

“Thank you, Senior!”

“Thank you, senior, for saving us!”

Senior Sister Lingxin looked at Ao tu with flickering eyes. She bowed respectfully and thanked him.

The rest of the girls also thanked him immediately.

Ao Tu lay there quietly and did not say a word.

“That demonic beast senior is an existence at the peak of the Celestial Thearch!”

“This… they came with junior sister Mi Xinlu and Wang Xian. They are actually existences at the peak of the Celestial Thearch.”

“That demonic beast senior is at the peak of the celestial thearch. What about the other one?”

Around them, some disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect looked at Ao tu and the rest with respect in their eyes.

“Thank you, junior brother Wang Xian.”

Senior Brother Junzi looked over and his pupils contracted slightly. He glanced at Ao Tu and AO qitian. He knew that they were brought over by Wang Xian.

Wang Xian did not order him to take action to obtain the Battle Angel. Instead, he was helping them at this critical moment. Clearly, he was protecting them.

This made senior brother Junzi feel touched and thanked him.

“Thank you, junior brother Wang Xian!”

Senior Sister Lingxin and the rest had obviously figured this out as well. They looked at Wang Xian with gratitude.

“Disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect, please do not take action. After this is over, I will give all of you a battle angel of the same level.”

“Of course, except for senior brother Junzi. In addition, all of you should act according to your abilities. If you are in danger, I will not make a move.”

Wang Xian said with a smile on his face. He took one last glance at senior brother Lu, senior brother Kong, senior brother Xu, and the rest.
