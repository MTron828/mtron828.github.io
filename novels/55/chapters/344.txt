Chapter 345: Corpse (3)

Wang Xian was slightly taken aback as he saw something in the middle of the Yellow River. He pondered hard.

Those terrifying creatures were far more domineering than those mutated beings they had met just now.

The one-meter Cadaveric Toad just now possessed a strength of Half-Step to Dan Realm.

Yet, the two-meter Cadaveric Toad before him now had already hit Dan Realm.

Two meters in size with faint greyish aura circling around its mustard body, exhibiting domineering demeanor.

The rest of the Cadaveric Ants around were also giving off the same domineering vibe. They quietly lay in a circle.

“More than a score of Level 11 appalling creatures are keeping guard over something in the middle. What’s that?”

Wang Xian was stunned as he looked around. Some of the low-level Cadaveric Ants and Cadaveric Toads were loitering around without a mind of their own.

Just then, he saw Cadaveric Leeches and Cadaveric Mosquitoes rapidly swimming towards the opening of the Yellow River.

There were approximately 20 to 30 of them, all looking bloated as they swam towards the Cadaveric Ants and Cadaveric Mosquitoes.

Croak!

They spat out traces of thick and crimson blood that flowed towards the center location.

“This is...?”

Wang Xian stared with his eyes wide open, looking shocked.

They were feeding. Those creatures were feeding on the blood they sucked up from the thing in the center.

“Is that the terrifying existence? Is it nursing itself? With the fresh blood from other living beings?”

Wang Xian was amazed.

If he guessed correctly, this creature was simply too scary as it could produce numbers of Level 11 creatures even when it was injured.

“Miracle Doctor Wang, did you make any discoveries?”

At the same time, there were dozens of people approaching from behind, asking him with smiling faces.

Yan She was right in the middle, accompanied by some Miracle Doctors and Inborn Experts.

“No!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Wang Xian shook his head. He did not reveal to them what he saw as he knew this bunch of people was not good enough to deal with these appalling creatures.

“The water in the Yellow River is not contaminated at all. According to what we found out, these creatures should be coming from within the river.”

As Yan She spoke, he cast a glance towards the Yellow River by the side. “But the water is too murky. My green snake got devoured after entering it. It’s too quiet over here without any life forms.”

“Yes, there are no life forms here. Not a single fish in such a huge river bank,” another Miracle Doctor exclaimed.

“What is the military army going to do with this place?” asked Wang Xian to Yan She with some curiosity.

“They’ll kill all the mutated creatures on the grassland before cordoning off the entire riverbank.”

As Yan She answered, he looked over in another direction where armed soldiers were rushing in.

The group of Inborn Experts followed the soldiers around, helping them to eliminate those mutated creatures.

Wang Xian looked over as they combed the area inch by inch, wiping out all the mutated creatures. Then they proceeded to search the Yellow River.

However, it was not easy due to the murkiness of the water.

Most importantly, they would sound off those group of terrifying creatures if they ventured into the river. It would be a severe loss until then.

Wang Xian frowned slightly as the group of people began searching along the riverbank.

Just before the sun was setting, the group finished walking around the tributary. Wang Xian had a better idea about the creatures within the river.

“I wonder if you have any findings?” the middle-aged man in military uniform asked all the Miracle Doctors at night.

“According to our understanding, the mutated ants have evolved with special organs that allow them to swim freely in the water. The source of the problem is almost certainly coming from the Yellow River!”

The group of Miracle Doctors shook their heads as not much information had been obtained.

The middle-aged man in military uniform knit his eyebrows slightly and made a decision. “Tomorrow, we’ll check the Yellow River. After which, everyone will receive a handsome reward for it.”

Miracle Doctors and Inborn Experts nodded their heads.

Everyone witnessed how dangerous it was at the tributary of the Yellow River, especially when the Half-Step to Dan Realm creature slew an Inborn Expert.

Without remuneration, many Inborn Experts would not want to risk their lives.

After dinner, everyone went back to their tents for a rest. Wang Xian stood outside of his own tent and gazed in the direction of the Yellow River. Thoughts were flying around in his head.

There were no stars nor moon in the sky. The weather was somber, and rain was expected tomorrow.

At 12 midnight, a figure disappeared from the temporary base. It flitted like a phantom towards the tributary of the Yellow River.

No one noticed that figure even though experts were all around.

“Let’s check it out!”

Wang Xian decided to explore the Yellow River. He’d had his apprehensions in the day, and therefore did not rise above the Yellow River in the air.

With a swift move, he flew a thousand meters high and looked down at the river.

“This is...?” His vision from Piercing Eyes was blocked by a layer of dark energy.

In the air, Wang Xian had a slightly different expression from before as he fixed his eyes on something below.

The grayish energy was similar to the water in the Yellow River, blocking his Piercing Eye’s vision in the air.

However, those Level 11 mutated creatures were seen clearly in the surroundings.

“There are more than a score of Level 11 creatures. Unless I turn into a dragon, I won’t be a match to them!”

With some hesitation, Wang Xian made a quick move and dived into the Yellow River.

Splash!

When Wang Xian entered the water, there were no water ripples at all. With a thought, he allowed the murky water stream to encompass him completely.

With a swift movement, Wang Xian approached that location.

1,000 meters, 500 meters, 100 meters...

Soon, Wang Xian was 50 meters away from the mutated creatures.

Looking ahead, Wang Xian stared with eyes agape.

A three-meter human-like being was quietly lying in the middle among the mutated creatures.

His body was giving off a disorderly vibe, but the energy it possessed trembled Wang Xian.

“Blood, Suppression from the blood!”

Wang Xian was staring with his eyes wide. The being that was lying without a sound in the water seemed to be suppressing Wang Xian.

Wang Xian may have been weak now, but it was horrifying to find something that could suppress his Divine Dragon’s bloodline.

The bloodline of this being is not any inferior to mine. Perhaps it’s also a supreme bloodline.

It was an eye-opener to Wang Xian as there were less than five bloodlines that could be on par with that of the Divine Dragon.

Before his eyes now, he had met one on Earth.

“He has no breadth, but his blood is still alive. He has a chance of resurrecting!”

Wang Xian recalled that if he mastered the seventh Divine Dragon Transformation, he could be revived with a drop of blood.

Terrifying!
