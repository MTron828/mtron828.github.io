Chapter 571: Demon-like Master (3)

One could only be called a master if they topped the world in any domain. The female disciples of Mt. Xue would not believe that someone in his twenties had become a blacksmith master, let alone those few Yong Chang youths.

“I’m saying the truth. Sister Xue’s Bo Yu was fixed there. If you don’t believe me, you can ask her when she gets here!” Mu Wanbai argued in fury as some did not believe her.

“It’s not that we don’t believe you, but who would ever believe a blacksmith master of such a young age?” Bei Ling and Bei Bei said as they quickly tugged Mu Wanbai’s arm.

“Hmph! You will know it when you’re there. I didn’t believe that lad is a blacksmith master either but it is true.” Feeling bitter, Mu Wanbai did not bother to explain any more.

“All right.” Bei Bei soon gave a smile. She nodded and said, “We’ll get our sisters to prepare the materials for equipment refining. But why do we have to bring along the spiritual grass for refining elixir pills?”

“The shop is called Master of Alchemy and Blacksmith. He said that the more customers he has to refine elixir pills, the more the spiritual stones will be discounted,” Mu Wanbai replied.

“Master of Alchemy and Blacksmith? That shop has a master who can refine elixir pills too?” Ye Feng said with a look of irony in his eyes.

“Great Senior Sister is here!”

At this time, a female disciple called out. Instantly, everyone looked ahead after being stunned briefly.

“You can ask Sister Xue anything you want to know!” said Mu Wanbai as she pouted her lips with her gaze brushing over Ye Feng. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Piao Lingxue!”

Ye Feng and several Yong Cang youths looked in the direction where the lady was coming from with solemn expressions. She was wearing clothes that were as white as snow. Her long hair spread behind her and she had a cold expression on her face. She truly looked like a fairy.

In fact, to be called a fairy was still an understatement.

Being an expert of the Budding Realm in her thirties, almost no other femme was comparable to her in the entire Yong Chang world.

Even Ye Feng had to put his arrogance away upon seeing Piao Lingxue.

She was a true-blue expert after all, an expert who had the potential to become an immortal.

“Great Senior Sister!”

“Senior Piao Lingxue!”

All Mt. Xue disciples immediately greeted Piao Lingxue with cupped fists.

The youths of the Yong Chang Immortal Sect cupped their fists as well.

“Mm.” Piao Lingxue responded with a nod. “Wanbai, I suppose you have told everyone about it?”

“Great Senior Sister, is that blacksmith master really in his twenties?” Bei Ling could not hold herself back from asking Piao Lingxue.

“Indeed, it is quite unimaginable!”

Piao Lingxue nodded with her arms slightly shaken. Her Bo Yu sword unsheathed itself and was suspended before her eyes. “He fixed my spiritual sword and used the Bing Yi metal to construct six subsidiary swords. I must get my hands on those swords!”

“So it’s true!”

Astonishment could be seen on the faces of every disciple, including Bei Ling and Bei Bei. If this came from the Great Senior Sister herself, it should be true then!

“Sister Bei Ling, Sister Bei Bei, why would I lie to you?” Mu Wanbei said in a snorting manner.

“There’s really a master in his twenties?” Ye Feng frowned and asked with doubts.

“You’ll see for yourself when you get there!”

Piao Lingxue did not explain further and said, “It is a fortune for all disciples of Mt. Xue to have a blacksmith master to refine our weapons. Please check and see if any other disciple would like to go.”

“One more thing!” Piao Lingxue said with a frown. “Please ask around if there is any disciple who needs to refine their elixir pills, and get them to prepare all necessary materials!”

“Yes, Great Senior Sister, we shall go and ask around now!”

Bei Ling, Bei Bei, and the other female disciples nodded and headed off.

At Mt. Xue, the position of a Great Senior Sister was comparable to a mentor. The abilities of the two were almost on par with each other. While some female disciples went around alerting the others, the Yong Chang youths were slightly embarrassed.. In particular, Ye Feng, who held a gloomy look on his face.

Their aim was to befriend Mt. Xue. It took them great effort to persuade Senior Ou Ziming and on top of that, Ye Feng had a crush on Bei Ling. However, little did they expect that a so-called master would be revealed!

“Senior Ye Feng, what should we do?”

“We shall tag along and meet this master!”

Ye Feng answered with no hesitation after one of the youths of the Yong Chang Immortal Sect posed a question.

“Even if such a blacksmith master does exist, I am not convinced that he’s an alchemist!”

He raised his head slightly, showing intense self-confidence on his face. “I, Ye Feng, fear no one. Not a single alchemy master in the entire Yong Chang is unknown to me.”

“That’s right. There’s no one in the entire Yong Chang world able to compare themselves to our senior when it comes to alchemy,” said several Youth Chang youths with smiles on their faces.

“Great Senior Sister, all sisters are ready. They became excited upon hearing about the existence of a master of alchemy and blacksmithing!”

Bei Ling and Bei Bei spoke with smiles on their faces. Within twenty minutes, they had reported back to Piao Lingxue.

Initially, the disciples of Mt. Xue were already delighted to spend time with those youths from Yong Chang. But it did not cross their minds that the Great Senior Sister would be taking them on a trip to meet a master.

An ordinary disciple would have to pay a huge price to refine Spiritual Equipment from a master. These female disciples were not qualified to do such a thing.

“All right, let’s go!”

Upon seeing a group of fifty to sixty female disciples with materials in their hands, Piao Lingxue smiled and rode on her sword. She flew towards the direction of the Yong Chang City. The other disciples followed behind her.

However, it was not just those sixty people who followed behind, but rather around eighty people. Amongst them were other Mt. Xue disciples who were just curious and youths of other sects who just wished to tag along.

It was already nightfall when Piao Lingxue left Wang Xian’s shop. Adding up all the traveling time and delays, it was already approximately 7 PM. With the sky turned dark, it did not attract much attention as the disciples flew towards Yong Chang City. It took them just twenty minutes to reach the vicinity of the city.

“Senior Piao Lingxue, where’s that master’s shop? I really want to see what a master in his twenties looks like!” Ye Feng asked Piao Lingxue, his eyes shining as everyone landed in the city.

“That’s right, where is the master? We heard that he’s a super young master!” The group of disciples chatted with fervor which added glow to the streets.

“Let’s move!”

Piao Lingxue led them to Wang Xian’s shop. When they reached the shop, they saw Wang Xian sitting inside. Piao Lingxue responded impassively, “This is the one!”

“What? Great Senior Sister, you mean...this small shop is the one?”

Everyone was dumbfounded by what they saw!
