Chapter 1452: 1452 paid his respects to the Dragon King

“That’s right, it’s the peace agreement!”

When the blood emperor heard ao Xingmu’s words, he heaved a sigh of relief and nodded respectfully.

“You are the true king of the wildlands, and your strength is probably unrivalled in the Liuhai region. Our bloodflow empire is willing to coexist peacefully with your wildlands empire!”

“At this moment, I have a wood-elemental scepter that I have treasured for a long time, and I am gifting it to the true king of the Wildlands!”

As he spoke, he took out a fifth-level void interpretation wooden staff from his interspatial ring. With a wave of his arm, he flew towards AO Xingmu.

Compared to the leader of the blood barbaric demon beasts, this time, there was more respect and fawning.

He had no choice. After witnessing his terrifying strength, even if he was the emperor of the blood flow empire, he still had to be respectful.

After all, the other party was an invincible existence at the seventh-level void interpretation.

“Naturally, the peace agreement has to be signed!”

Ao Xingmu didn’t accept the scepter. He looked at the blood emperor with a hint of mockery in his eyes.

“However, it’s not with you guys!”

As Ao Xingmu spoke, he looked at the position of the Liuhuang Alliance.

Everyone in the Liuhuang Alliance was stunned when they saw the terrifying emperor of the wildlands and the invincible expert at the seventh level of the Seethrough realm looking over.

Wang Xian gently nudged Feng Luan.

Feng Luan was stunned and her eyes revealed a look of surprise. She moved her body and flew directly into the sky.

“King of the wildlands, our Liuhuang Alliance hopes to sign a peace agreement with your Wildlands Empire. In the future, we will never fight and kill each other!”

As she spoke, she bowed to AO xingmu.

“I don’t dare, I don’t dare. You Don’t have to be polite, Queen Dragon and Phoenix!”

However, what happened next shocked everyone.

When Feng Luan said this, the invincible emperor of the wildlands actually bowed respectfully to the Dragon Phoenix Queen.

It was somewhat respectful!

What... What the F * ck?

Even Feng Luan was stunned when she saw Ao Xingmu bow to her!

“What... What’s going on? How could the invincible Emperor of the wildlands be so respectful to the Dragon Phoenix Queen!”

“Am I seeing things? The current emperor of the wildlands is a terrifying existence at the seventh level of the insightful void tier. He was so indifferent to the blood emperor just now. How could he be so respectful to the dragon-phoenix Queen, who is at the fifth level of the insightful void tier?”

The surrounding humans widened their eyes and discussed in disbelief.

What was going on?

The expressions of the blood emperor, the blood flow empire, and even the life and death pill workshop changed slightly when they saw this scene. They had a bad premonition.

Everyone from the Blood Flow Empire Alliance also widened their eyes in disbelief.

“We are willing to sign an agreement with the Blood Flow Empire Alliance!”

Ao Xingmu continued to speak to Feng Luan.

“Good, that’s great!”

A trace of excitement flashed through Feng Luan’s eyes.

“Emperor of the wildlands, what about our blood flow empire?”

The blood emperor’s pupils constricted slightly when he saw this scene, and he hurriedly spoke.

“All of you are not worthy!”

Ao Xingmu glanced at the blood emperor and said disdainfully.

“What!”

“What... What the hell is going on?”

“How could it be like this? We have just joined the blood flow empire, and now the Barbarian Empire is not signing an agreement with the blood flow empire!”

At this moment, all the humans standing behind the blood flow empire were dumbfounded.

Just now, in order to survive better, they had announced that they would join the blood flow empire.

Now, it was a complete reversal!

Especially those few factions that had betrayed the blood flow empire and joined the blood flow empire. They staggered and stared at the position of the blood flow empire in a daze.

This... this...

When the blood emperor heard their words, his expression changed drastically. His gaze was fixed on AO xingmu.

He turned his head stiffly and looked at the three forces sitting below him.

“Emperor of the wildlands, didn’t we make an agreement with the Demon Beast Clan?”

At this moment, the three forces of the life and death pill workshop below could no longer sit still.

They stood up and stared at AO xingmu with unsightly expressions as they asked loudly.

“Did we make an agreement with the Blood Savage Demon Beast Clan?”

Ao Xingmu stared at them and asked somewhat mockingly.

“This...”

The expressions of the people from the three factions changed slightly.

“Then what does the emperor of the wildlands mean by this?” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The old man at the center of the world’s third trading company stared at AO Xingmu as he asked in a deep voice.

“This is a matter of our flowing sea region and our Demon Beast Empire. I can do whatever I Want!”

Ao Xingmu also stared at the old man.

His words caused the faces of all the people from the three forces to turn extremely gloomy.

“Demon Lin, according to what you have discussed with the Blood Barbarian Demon Beast clan, how should the following ceremony be held?”

Ao Xingmu’s gaze moved away from the old man and asked the leader of the demon Lin clan on the statue indifferently.

“Reporting to my emperor. According to the agreement, we will slaughter the human side that has not signed an agreement with us. We will drink the blood of the human experts to celebrate the establishment of our Demon Beast Empire!”

The leader of the demon Qilin said without any hesitation.

With the current strength of the Emperor of the wilderness, he could suppress all the demon beast races by himself. He would not tolerate any disloyalty from them.

“Alright!”

Ao Xingmu shouted loudly. His body moved and he flew down from the dragon throne.

He flew directly towards Wang Xian.

At the same time, more than a thousand members of his clan, the Starwood Dragon Clan of the Dragon Palace, flew directly towards Wang Xian.

Under everyone’s gaze, Ao Xingmu landed in front of Wang Xian and knelt down.

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

“I have lived up to your expectations. I have become the king of Demonic Beasts. Do you wish to continue with the ceremony?”

Ao Xingmu knelt in front respectfully and reported to Wang Xian.

As he spoke, all the Starwood Dragons knelt in front of Wang Xian.

“Hiss!”

“Oh my God, what... What is going on?”

“Ah Ah Ah, D * mn, I have already guessed that the flowing Emperor Alliance is related to this new king of the wildlands. However... I never expected that they were actually the subordinates of the Nameless Sword Demon!”

“How is this possible? Wang Xian is only at level six of the Seethrough realm. How did the king of the wildlands become his king?”

When everyone saw the invincible king of the wildlands kneeling in front of Wang Xian, every single human was in a daze.

They rubbed their eyes in disbelief.

Most of them were trembling as they felt that the scene before them was a little crazy!

However, most of them were terrified!

That’s right, they were terrified!

That was because they had chosen the bloodflow empire’s side just now!

Their expressions changed drastically as they stared at Wang Xian. They couldn’t help but swallow a mouthful of saliva.

“Let’s continue!”

Wang Xian looked at Ao Xingmu and the rest in front of him. A faint smile appeared on his face.

He looked in the direction of the Bloodflow Empire and swept his gaze across everyone. A faint killing intent flashed in his eyes. “All Bloodflow Empire members, kill them all!”

“Yes!”

Ao Xingmu replied loudly.

“All Savage Dynasty Demon Beasts, listen to my orders!”

A roar sounded out!
