Chapter 894: 0895, Congratulations on your death

Translator: 549690339

“Murder... Murder!”

On the narrow path, a middle-aged man was conversing with an old man.

Suddenly, the middle-aged man fell to the ground. There was a long wound on his neck. The old man was slightly stunned, and then he shouted with a shocked face.

He was dead!

The middle-aged man who was conversing with him died immediately. There was a bloody mark on his neck.

He was killed without any warning or even a trace.

“This...”

The people of the transcendent continent had all seen death before. Although the old man was shocked, he still hurriedly shouted.

In the city, any death would be under the responsibility of the city guards.

Every area was under the responsibility of the city guards.

When the old man’s voice rang out, a young man hurriedly ran out of the room.

When he saw the middle-aged man lying in front of his house, he immediately shouted, “City guard, someone died here!”

“What?”

“Whoosh!”

The young man’s voice traveled far, and there was a response immediately.

In the sky, a middle-aged man quickly flew over.

Flying in the city was the privilege of city guards.

When the middle-aged man arrived, he immediately saw a middle-aged man’s corpse lying on the ground.

His face was cold. He immediately walked over to touch the corpse and looked at the wound on his neck.

“A fatal blow!”

The middle-aged city guard’s expression did not change. He looked at the old man and the young man and asked, “Did you see the murderer?”

“No, no. Just now, when the middle-aged man was talking to him, he suddenly fell to the ground. I saw blood flowing out of his neck and was shocked. I quickly called you, Sir!”

The old man quickly said.

“You didn’t see him?”

The middle-aged city guard frowned and asked the old man.

“No, no. I haven’t reached the transcendence realm. I didn’t even see him!”

The old man quickly said.

“Humph, you dare to commit murder in broad daylight. You’re really courting death!”

The middle-aged city guard snorted and a trace of disdain flashed in his eyes. “We’ll capture him today!”

As he spoke, he immediately took out a stone plate and began to contact his superior.

At this moment, some residents in the surrounding rooms walked out and looked over curiously.

Wang Xian also walked out of the house and glanced at the corpses on the ground with a smile on his face.

“He dares to commit a murder in broad daylight and on the streets. He’s really courting death!”

“That’s right. The entire city is covered by a formation. It can monitor all the places!”

“Unless the murderer interferes with the formation when he makes his move, he will definitely be discovered by the formation!”

Some of the elders from the surrounding residents were discussing in a low voice.

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly. Formation? Surveillance?

“Is the usage of formations in the transcendence continent so powerful?”

Wang Xian’s expression sank. However, when he thought of things like the communication stone plate and the mission stone plate, a hint of embarrassment flashed across his eyes.

If that was really the case, it would be troublesome.

“Miss Jin!”

At this moment, a shout was heard.

Wang Xian quickly turned his head and looked at the sky.

A woman was dressed in a cautious city guard uniform. She looked valiant and valiant with a long sword in her hand. Her figure was extremely hot.

“It’s the Captain!”

When she heard the middle-aged city guard address her, the woman was slightly displeased.

“Yes, it’s the captain. There’s a murder case here. Please open the array formation and take a picture!”

The middle-aged man realized that he had said the wrong thing and quickly said.

The woman walked to the side of the corpse and looked at the corpse on the ground. “A sharp dagger, a fatal blow!”

“Yes, Captain. The deceased was suddenly killed while chatting with this old man. The old man didn’t see anyone!”

The middle-aged city guard said.

“When did he die?”

The woman took out a blue jade plate the size of two palms and asked.

“About five minutes ago!”

The old man immediately replied.

“Yes!”

The woman nodded and nodded on the jade plate.

“Yes?”

Soon, the woman frowned and a serious expression appeared on her face. “Only a white shadow flashed by. The enemy should have used the array formation to block the surveillance of the city protection array!”

“Not good. Not only one person died, another person died. There, a White Shadow!”

The woman revealed a shocked expression, and her eyes flickered as she looked to the left.

Then, she lowered her head and repeatedly looked at the picture on the Jade Plate.

“This is?”

She walked to the side of the corpse and picked up a red piece of paper from the ground. The texture of the paper was very special, and the shape of the paper was very strange!

“This thing, was it not there just now?”

The woman picked up the red piece of paper and asked the old man.

The old man looked over, and a trace of thought appeared on his face. “I don’t think there was this red piece of paper just now. Could it be from this middle-aged man?”

The woman didn’t answer. She walked to the other side, saw a red piece of paper on the ground, and picked it up.

“There is only a white shadow on the city protection array. This red piece of paper was left by the murderer. It should be an assassin organization!”

“It’s not an undercurrent assassin organization. Could it be another organization?”

The woman frowned and put away the piece of paper in her hand. “Confirm the identity of the deceased. Get Someone to come and collect the body!”

The woman said, “Let’s go. We can’t find the murderer!”

The city guards took the body away and nodded.

It was not uncommon for people to die in holy sea town, and it was not uncommon for killers to kill people in the city.

What was rare was to kill people in broad daylight, and it was on an exposed street.

Every city had a formation that could monitor every corner of the city.

But there was a problem. The room could not be seen, and it was blocked by something in the sky, so it could not be found.

Therefore, when an assassin organization took action, they would usually do it at night in the room.

This was the first time a woman had seen someone kill someone in broad daylight.

However, they would only see the two red pieces of paper. Other than the two pieces of paper, there were no other clues. Hence, they would not continue to investigate further.

After seeing the group of city guards leave, Wang Xian returned to the room with a faint smile on his face.

“Ao Yao, is it because the formation can’t see you guys?”

Wang Xian said to the side with a smile.

“It’s the Dragon King. After advancing to light thorn, we will obtain a supernatural ability for every level up. After advancing to extraordinary level two, we will obtain light shadow supernatural ability.”

“Light shadow supernatural ability. It can ignore any formation other than the demonic attribute!”

Ao Yao replied.

Wang Xian nodded with a smile on his face. “I’m relieved now. Next, it’s time for you guys to perform!”

Wang Xian smiled happily.

One ignored the formation and the other possessed a terrifying and hidden race. When they wanted to assassinate someone.

Unless the other party was strong enough, they had to die! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Next, when Ao Yao and the rest performed, they would soon shake the entire Shenghai town.

This was also the first stronghold of the dragon assassin organization.

“Cultivate well. For a long period of time, we will need your strange demon clan!”

Wang Xian said to Ao Yao.

“It’s the Dragon King. Our Strange Demon clan will definitely become the strongest killer that will shake the supernatural continent in the future!”
