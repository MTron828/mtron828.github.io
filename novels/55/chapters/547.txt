: Genius? Demon? (2)

“Dripping Water Space!”

“Dripping Water Earth!”

“Dripping Water Stone!”

“Raining Swords!”

“Stone Splitting Rain!”

Evening. The sun lay diagonally across the horizon. A beautiful rainbow hung over the surrounding waterfall.

Halfway up Mt. Fengyu, a girl stood on a piece of empty land while waving the longsword in her hand constantly.

Another lady stood by the side and watched the girl practicing her swordsmanship silently.

“Liquid state and gaseous state. Incredible! This level of control and sword technique...!”

A short distance away, Wang Xian sat behind a table. With a book in his hand, he was shocked to see the girl waving her sword.

The swordsmanship of the girl had truly opened a new door for Wang Xian.

In the Underworld, he had not encountered such incredible swordsmanship.

Water can exist in liquid, gaseous and solid states. Solid states include ice, snow, frost and hail. Liquid states would include clouds, rain, mist and dew while the gaseous state would include water vapour. In different forms and states, they will have different effects, attacks and damage. Yu Ling’er’s incorporated sword into rain and sword into the mist. Each transformation has different effects. For example, the penetrative force of rain and the illusory effects of mist!

Looking at Yu Ling’er, Wang Xian had lots of thoughts. In his hand, a ball of liquid appeared. Under his control, the liquid separated into droplets of water.

Following which, it vaporised, condensed into water, turned into snow, turned into frost, turned into ice and eventually hail. All these were transformations of ice.

“In the past, I have rarely used water attribute because the offensive potency is a little weak. It might be better as a supporting attribute. However, it would seem that this was only because I do not know how to use them!”

Wang Xian sank into deep thought. After the ball of liquid transformed, how could he maximize the offensive potency?

“Spiritual Water Lance!”

At this moment, Wang Xian saw Yu Ling’er lunging ahead with the longsword in her hand. A stream of water flowed rapidly in her hands.

Before the longsword contacted her target, the water flow on it attacked the target over a dozen times.

When the longsword arrived, it easily penetrated the mountain rocks.

I can’t understand by watching alone. It would be best if I could join the Da Hong Immortal Sect. In this way, I could obtain more battle techniques and more application techniques!

“Incredible swordsmanship. You are really great!”

After seeing Yu Ling’er practicing for a while, Wang Xian walked over while piling compliments on her.

“Tsk! What do you know about this?”

Seeing Wang Xian walking over with pleasantries, Yu Ling’er lifted her head proudly and remarked.

“Although I can’t really understand, I can tell that Miss Yu’er is really great with swords!”

Wang Xian smiled and didn’t take offence. He turned to the lady and asked, “Aunt Yu, can you teach me this swordsmanship too? Can I join the Da Hong Immortal Sect?”

Huh?

The lady frowned upon hearing Wang Xian. Over the last two days, she was also pondering over how was she going to handle this unfamiliar young man.

After two days of observation, she noticed that this young man didn’t know about a lot of things. He had likely lost part of his memory.

“It isn’t that easy to join Da Hong Immortal Sect. You need to have the talents and strength. Before your strength reached the Inborn Realm, you would have to start with being an ordinary disciple. Why don’t you go for the assessment of ordinary disciples? They are located at the entrance of Da Hong Immortal Sect. After you pass the assessment to become an ordinary disciple, the sect will allocate you accommodation!” Yu Ling’er interrupted upon hearing Wang Xian.

Clearly, she wanted Wang Xian to leave this place as soon as possible.

“Just as Yu’er has said, you need to start with being an ordinary disciple to join Da Hong Immortal Sect. After you reach the Inborn Realm, you will then be considered as truly part of the sect. You can choose a mountain sect of your choice. Each mountain sect will have a mentor. If you wish to join Da Hong Immortal Sect, you can consider taking part in the assessment.” The lady looked at Wang Xian as she explained.

“Inborn Realm?”

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly.

“Yeah, Inborn Realm! I started cultivating when I was eight and used ten years to reach the Inborn Realm. If you work hard now, you should be able to reach the Inborn Realm by the time you are forty years old.”

Yu Ling’er smirked and commented with a little contempt.

The lady by her side patted her head.

“It’s fate that brought us together. After you recover from your injuries, I can look for a job in Da Hong Immortal Sect for you. If you reach the Inborn Realm one day, you can join Mt. Fengyu.”

The lady smiled and spoke to Wang Xian.

“We’ll probably have to wait ten years then!” the girl by the side mumbled softly.

Wang Xian smiled in response. He moved his arm and a water sword appeared in his hand instantly. He threw it out and the water sword landed accurately on the wall Yu Ling’er was practicing with previously.

“You don’t have to wait ten years. I’ve realized I still have some strength!”

Yu Ling’er was stunned and so was the lady.

They would have never have expected Wang Xian to be an Inborn expert.

When he was injured, the lady had examined Wang Xian’s body. However, she didn’t sense any water energy.

“You are a cultivator? And a water attribute cultivator?”Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Yu Ling’er couldn’t help but exclaim. Her eyes widened and were filled with disbelief.

“Yep!”

Wang Xian opened up his palm and water energy coalesced into a water sword. As he waved the sword, dense water energy scattered to the surroundings.

“Inborn Realm! Considering you can coalesce water energy into a water sword so easily, you are at least at the Inborn level!”

The lady was pleasantly surprised.

Yu Ling’er was surprised too but snorted coldly. “Tsk! So what if he’s at the Inborn level! I am too!”

“Aunt Yu, can I join the Da Hong Immortal Sect?”

Wang Xian took a glance at the girl and revealed a faint smile.

“Yeah, of course you can!”

The lady nodded her head. Still feeling a little surprised, she said, “I’ll bring you to the sect to register tomorrow. Yu’er, bring a copy of Da Hong Immortal Sect’s swordsmanship to your future junior brother!”

“Alright.”

Yu Ling’er pouted as she answered.

The lady was smiling radiantly as she added, “I had not expected you to be a water attribute Inborn expert. You can just address me as Mentor Yu in the future!”

“Yes, Mentor Yu!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and turned his gaze to Yu Ling’er.

“Call me senior sister in the future. Here’s the swordsmanship chapter!”

Seeing Wang Xian looking at her, Yu Ling’er pouted and handed a secret manual to him.

“Thank you!”

Wang Xian smiled and took the secret manual. After which, he walked to the table by the side and started reading.

The lady smiled while watching. She was rather appreciative of Wang Xian’s indifferent personality.

Water could encompass all things. The cultivation path of water and the cultivation path of water swordsmanship required a calm and composed personality. Otherwise, one would find it hard to achieve great mastery.

She knew her daughter had a bad temper.

Who would have expected it would be so easy to join Da Hong Immortal Sect and obtain their cultivation arts? My incredible life in Yong Chang world is about to begin.

Looking through the secret manual in his hands, Wang Xian revealed a faint smile.

With his current Budding Realm strength and his control over the water attribute as a five elements divine dragon, practicing any battle techniques would be a walk in the park!
