Chapter 479: All Of These Are Mine? (1)

Wang Xian was not sure how strong the God was.

But his Inborn Spiritual Weapons already possessed spirits in them.

The spirituality was interlinked, which made sets of Spiritual Weapons possible.

Just as the water seed was about to be extinguished, it made the final struggle. The struggle drew the spirituality from the Holy Water Vial.

Both of them belonged to the Water God. With similar spirituality, the Holy Water Vial reacted to the Holy Water by instinct.

When Wang Xian spun around, the bouts of Holy Water had already entered the girl’s body.

The Holy Water that entered her body was an azure blue color.

This was not like adding oil to the fuel, but rather, the water and fire were completely unmatched.

Argh!

The girl let out a devastating scream when the Holy Water entered her body.

The water seed awakened and began to combat the fire seed again.

The difference from just now was that both fire seed and water seed seemed to possess some spirituality as they began to occupy the body.

For a moment, her body turned red, exuding a burning glow. Subsequently, she turned blue again.

“Oh gosh, this girl is quite miserable!”

Wang Xian had a slight change in expression as though he could feel two energies exploding at any time in the body.

Once they exploded, the girl would, no doubt, be reduced to ashes.

In the past, she had endured the torture of the fire seed and water seed. Now, she had finally obtained the legacy of the Fire God. Such an excellent opportunity, but no one expected this.

One can imagine how domineering the strength of the Holy Water was, since it was contained in a Level 12 Spiritual Weapon.

That was the reason, too, that the water seed was revived, spurring another conflict between water and fire.

The Fire Demon was standing at the side, looking at the girl blankly.

As a combat Fire Demon, he did not know what was going on and did not understand what changes she was undergoing.

The Fire Demon could only stare at her with doubts.

Wang Xian made a swift move and came to the girl. He placed his palms on her body.

One of his arms was red while the other one was blue. He placed both arms on the back of that girl.

“Such tenderness!”

“Hur? She’s alternating between hot and cold!”

“Sss, fu*k!”

“It’s the Grade 2 of Fire and Ice!”

Wang Xian had a dramatic mix of expressions.

While he had turned into a Divine Dragon during the fight just now, his clothes were turned to ashes.

Subsequently, he had been using his energy to wrap himself just like if had his clothes on. Essentially, he was naked.

Now, this girl was undressed too.

This was secondary. He would not lose control given his character.

However, the girl was experiencing a Grade 2 of Fire and Ice, alternating between hot and cold!

This was not any ordinary fire and ice. It was the hotness and coldness coming from her body.

As a result, it was Wang Xian’s natural reaction to get hardened in between his legs as a form of respect.

With both his palms at the back of the girl, it was not hard to imagine when a part of him became hard.

“Mmm-hmm?”

Apparently, the girl sensed something odd from behind her, but the burning heat and the coolness distracted her from her thoughts.

“Damm, the energy in her body is beyond my control!”

Wang Xian took a deep breath as the look on his face changed slightly after sensing the energy in the girl’s body.

After receiving the legacy of the Fire God, the energy that was cleansed by the Holy Water was no longer weak like before. It was not something he could easily control anymore.

“Gone, this girl is finished. What a waste!”

Wang Xian felt the massive energy in her and sighed.

At this time, the girl collapsed and fell on Wang Xian.

She leaned on Wang Xian, just like someone without a spine.

Wang Xian slightly frowned and held her with two arms and one leg while he continued to think of solutions.

“What should I do? It’d be a pity if she died just like that. Besides, if she explodes in this place, the entire Fire God’s Graveyard will be ruined. There go my treasures too!”

Wang Xian continued to look around his surroundings to see if there were any other spiritual items around.

The Fire Demon beside him was useless, as he could only watch blankly, wondering what was happening.

“Legacy, a medium, Hexa-star!”

An idea suddenly struck Wang Xian when he spotted the fiery-red Hexa-star pattern on the girl’s stomach.

The fiery-red Hexa-star seemed to have merged with her body. Wang Xian looked over to another Hexa-star at the coffin.

With an arm swing, the other Hexa-star was sucked into his hand. Followed by a swift movement, he enveloped both of their bodies with flames.

“Throw your Aqua Stars in!” Wang Xian yelled at the top of his lungs toward the side hall where he came from.

While the other four young men were standing outside, waiting in fear, they were shocked when they heard Wang Xian’s voice.

Without any hesitation, they quickly took six Hexa-stars and headed for the main hall.

“No entry!”

Knowing that they were a team with the descendant of the Fire God, the Fire Demon let out a yell.

The young man was shocked as he hurriedly threw the Hexa-stars that he was holding.

The domineering stance of the Fire Demon was suffocating them as they receded as soon as possible.

Since the Hexa-stars can convert energy, and the Fire God thought of using Hexa-stars to carry on with his legacy, then this method should work. But... Forget it. Let’s get her back on her feet first. Otherwise, I will also be implicated if she suddenly explodes. The entire Fire Spirit Island will be blasted off when these two domineering energies explode. Even I will sustain severe injuries. Till then, I can’t even get any treasures!

Wang Xian pondered to himself as he took another fiery-red Hexa-star in his hand. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

[Blazing Star: Level 11]

“Be it Blazing Star or Aqua Star, they were made by either the inferno energy or water energy. These energy crystals can enter into bodies!”

Wang Xian swung his arm and inserted the Blazing Star crystal into his belly, forming a pattern on it.

Immediately, Wang Xian realized he could use the inferno energy in the girl’s body.

“These two Blazing Stars are a pair. So are these six!”

Wang Xian swung his arm once again and inserted another three Aqua Stars into the girl’s body.

When the three Aqua Stars stacked together, Wang Xian also took another Aqua Star and inserted it into his body.

The Aqua Stars, at their own specific positions, could significantly enhance their strength by multiple times.

If they were not placed in specific positions, they could only mobilize the energy between the two pointers.

Such a unique formation acted like an array.

Buzz!

When the Aqua Stars entered into both bodies, Wang Xian had a thought.

Activate the medium!

Energy Exchange!

Wang Xian tried to mobilize her water energy into his own body.

As the energy surged, the water energy entered. Wang Xian suddenly thought of something.

In the five elements, water feeds wood; wood fuels fire.

When the fire circulated into the girl’s body, the fire in her was transferred out subsequently.

Fire forms earth; earth forms metal; metal carries water.

The water went back to the girl’s body.

A perfect circulation.

Given the fact that Wang Xian was a Five Elements Divine Dragon, he could create a circulation of energy within the girl’s body.

As long as the Aqua Stars and Blazing Stars remained in their bodies, the girl would not explode.

“Cold, hot, cold, hot!”

Wang Xian realized that he could control the girl’s temperature as he wished. The feeling...

Besides, he realized something frightening.

With this method, he was indirectly taking control of the girl’s life.
