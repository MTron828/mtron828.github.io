3444 3443. Under the cave master of Killing Water Mage

The ninth-grade water lotus was floating around.

What was the concept of four ninth-grade water lotus?

Even Wang Xian found it difficult to control them.

This required the five elements grinding at the side to strengthen them. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

It was not good for a person to have as many treasures as possible, especially for a treasure of a very high level like the water lotus.

Some weapons such as ordinary innate spiritual treasures required a person to control them.

An expert was not able to control countless treasures without limits.

He had to control them with energy.

This was different from the Five Elements Millstone. The Five Elements Millstone was formed by Wang Xian’s dragon blood by chance. The Dragon Soul was equivalent to a clone, and the clone controlled the Five Elements Millstone.

Treasures like this were extremely rare.

A ninth-grade lotus flower was very powerful, but it was extremely difficult to control four ninth-grade lotus flowers.

However, Wang Xian could do it!

“Lotus flowers, Bloom. Petals, kill!”

The four ninth-grade lotus flowers spun and bloomed one by one, heading straight for the cave master.

“No, how did you get so many water lotuses?”

The cave master trembled violently when he saw the beautiful water lotuses that were filled with killing intent.

He had been here for so long and had only obtained one ninth-grade water lotus.

This fellow actually had a total of four!

Four ninth grade water lotus was equivalent to more than ten connate numinous treasures!

These dozen or so connate numinous treasures were smashed over under the control of great power, and one could imagine their power.

Not to mention, there was an even more terrifying five elements millstone in the surroundings.

The Flames of the five elements millstone covered the surroundings, melting the water energy in the entire space.

Cave master water mage suffered a terrifying attack.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

One flower petal after another landed on his body, causing the body of the water energy to begin to collapse.

His body was in an unusual condition. It was as if he had cultivated a pool of water to such an extent. It was very mystical.

However, when the Water Lotus’attack landed on his body, he could sense that the life force of cave master water mage was quickly disappearing.

“Eh, that’s not right. Although the attack of the ninth-grade water lotus can dissolve his life force, it doesn’t seem to be able to do so. Is it because of his peculiar body?”

Wang Xian mumbled. His body trembled and his entire body seemed to be covered by soil.

The five elements millstone started to reverse and transferred the fire energy to the earth energy.

It was really a counteraction of the attributes. It was still the earth that counteracted the water!

“Time sand, cover!”

Wang Xian growled in a low voice. Countless Earth attribute energies transformed into sand and flooded forward.

“How did you get so many attributes?”

The water cave master widened his eyes and was filled with disbelief. The body of the water current was trembling violently.

“Die!”

Wang Xian’s face turned cold as the sand current completely covered it.

“Retrieve!”

The five elements millstone was suspended in the air above the cave master of the Water Mage Cave. The bodies that were wrapped in mud entered the five elements millstone.

“It’s indeed a very special creature!”

A smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face. With a wave of his arm, he kept the body of the cave master of the water mage cave into his bag.

The body of the cave master of the Water Mage Cave was a silver-white stream of water. Even after his death, it still contained a huge amount of energy.

“This body is really special. It can be refined into a weapon and can also be absorbed. It can also allow the water lotus to absorb and improve.”

Wang Xian mumbled as his eyes sparkled.

He put it away and looked towards the sky.

Four powerhouses at the first level of the universe dominator were surrounding and killing Azure Dragon Moon. They were engaged in a fierce battle.

The sudden end of the battle on Wang Xian’s side seemed to have attracted their attention.

“Eh? How is this possible? The life force of aquamancer has disappeared!”

The four of them looked in their direction. Their eyes were sparkling.

“Attack!”

At this moment, Wang Xian dashed out directly.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

He shouted loudly. At the same time, a roar and a terrifying energy ravaged the surroundings.

A water god Dragon rushed out from below. It swayed its huge body and came to their side.

Soon after, the entire sky seemed to be covered by a cloth and was separated into a special dark space.

The array completely covered this space.

“What? There’s an ambush!”

“Oh no, there are experts from the ancestral dragon bloodline here!”

When the four experts saw this scene, their expressions changed slightly.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Wang Xian flew over and instantly arrived at the right side of them.

Below them, an lie also flew over slowly and arrived at the other side.

“Three. There are still three experts from your ancestral dragon lineage here. It seems like we have really underestimated you!”

The figure holding a staff in the middle swept his gaze across the surrounding Wang Xian Heaven Formation’s water dragon leaders. His eyes were filled with coldness.

“Hehe, we are not from the ancestral dragon lineage. We just don’t like you guys!”

Wang Xian said plainly and looked at Green Dragon Moon. “Brother Green Dragon Moon, Are You Alright?”

“Thank you for your help, Brother.”

Green Dragon Moon looked at the leaders of the Heaven Formation and water dragons with a hint of shock.

He did not expect Wang Xian to have two such experts on his side.

Together with Wang Xian, they weren’t afraid at all in a four-on-four situation. In fact, they were even able to gain the upper hand.

“Someone who isn’t from the ancestral dragon lineage dares to get involved in this mess. You really don’t know what’s good for you!”

A figure wearing a white mask glared at Wang Xian and the rest.

“Hehe, you guys aren’t from the Holy Dragon lineage either. Since all of you dare to get involved, why wouldn’t I?”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly. “Furthermore, all of you will die today.”

“Arrogant. If I can’t destroy all of you this time, I will be able to destroy all of you the next time!”

The old voice spoke again as they scanned their surroundings.

“HMPH, let’s Go!”

After he finished speaking, he held his staff and flew straight to the back.

Crash

When Wang Xian saw that they were about to leave, he flapped his incipient saint wings and revealed a faint smile on his face.

“How can we leave so easily?”

As he spoke, his figure had already arrived behind them.

“HMM?”

The four powerhouses who were wearing light masks were stunned for a moment. Their eyes revealed a sinister look.

“You are really arrogant. Do you think you can keep us here?”

A figure said coldly.

“Then, you can give it a try?”

Wang Xian smiled and slowly raised his palm. He held the five elemental grindstone in one hand and the ninth-grade water attribute Lotus in the other!

“Brother Qing longyue, let’s destroy them today. Don’t let them escape!”

He shouted softly and threw out the water lotus and the five elemental grindstone. His arm turned into a dragon claw and grabbed at the four powerhouses.

“Hahaha, good!”

Green Dragon Moon’s eyes sparkled when he saw that Wang Xian wanted to keep them here.

He laughed out loud and swung his huge body, sweeping out his dragon tail.

“Are you courting death? Do you really think that we are easy to deal with? So what if you are Divine Dragons!”

The four powerhouses were furious as they roared.
