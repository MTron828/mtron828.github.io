“Rumble Rumble Rumble!”

On the planet where the 6 alliances were located, a strange space enveloped, over 500 warriors were fleeing in despair!

Against 3 undying level 7 warriors, they only had one!

What made them feel the most fear and wanted to curse was that one of the Undying Level 7 warriors didn’t attack them, instead attacking them like a cat playing with a mouse!

From time to time, they let out ear piercing laughter!

This made them fall into despair, many level 6 undyings were killed!

They weren’t as strong as the other side, and now that so many had been killed, everyone fell into despair!

Many of the 6 powers’undyings were killed!

“Despicable, your dragon palace is too despicable, purposely showing weakness and looking for an opportunity to kill us, you despicable fellows!”

At this moment, the three seas sect’s sect master was on the verge of collapse!

Half of the sect’s experts had died at the hands of the Dragon Palace. He had always thought that there was hope for revenge. However, his repeated failures filled his heart with despair!

Looking at the Dragon Palace’s experts who were taunting him from above, his body trembled as he roared with an ice-cold face!

“Hehe!”

Ba Qi looked at him with ridicule and attacked him one after another!

“Dragon Palace, you will die a horrible death, a horrible death!”

The three seas sect leader screamed!

“Kill, Kill!”

“Howl Howl Howl!”

Undying Level 6 warriors were killed one after another, the rest of the Warriors from the 6 powers were even more devastated, their eyes bloodshot, gritting their teeth as they roared!

Right now, they no longer wanted to escape, they only wanted to kill as many as they could! Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

However, with such a huge gap, they did not have much power to resist. Undying Godly monarchs quickly fell one after another!

“No!”

In the sky, the ninth-grade sky ancestor glared at the ground with Bloodshot Eyes as he roared with killing intent!

“Die!”

He roared!

“Jie Jie Jie, don’t be anxious. It’s Your Turn Now!”

Ba Qi looked at him, his face filled with rage as he roared!

Just as the battle was about to begin, within the Tian Shan Business Planet!

Over 100 Dragon Palace undyings and over 100 Tian Shan sword sect undyings were fighting!

The terrifying aftershock and powerful law energy caused the entire planet to tremble!

All around, the tourists and shop owners all looked gloomily at the Energy Covered Planet!

“Haven’t the experts of the Tianshan Sword Sect Come Yet? If they don’t come soon, the entire commercial planet of Tianshan will be ruined!”

“Damn it! My shop was destroyed just like that!”

Some experts looked ahead and said angrily!

“People of the Dragon Palace, you are courting death!”

At this moment, a roar filled with anger came from the void. Then, everyone felt a tremendous pressure!

Everyone’s expression changed. Even those who were watching from afar felt as if there was a mountain on their bodies!

“It’s the forefather of the Sky Mountain Sword sect. The sect leader of the Sky Mountain Sword sect is finally here!”

“Kill those people from the Dragon Palace. It’s them who destroyed our territory. Kill them!”

Some people looked excited when they saw the sect leader of the Sky Mountain Sword sect coming!

Many of them had settled down on the commercial planet of Sky Mountain and set up shops and companies here. They could be said to be part of the Sky Mountain Sword sect!

Now that their home planet had been attacked by the Dragon Palace, they naturally didn’t have a good impression of the Dragon Palace!

“A bunch of scoundrels. They were like cowards when we attacked them. Now, they dare to come out and cause trouble. They’re courting death!”

Another cold voice resounded!

2 ancient God Like warriors covered in lightning walked over, their faces filled with rage!

“Everyone from the Dragon Palace, die!”

Their gazes swept over, many shackles appeared in their hands, locking onto the undyings of the Dragon Palace as they charged!

“Sou Sou Sou!”

The moment an undying level 7 warrior attacked, the moment he didn’t immediately flee back to his god country, he would be locked onto by the shackles!

Many shackles floated above the heads of the Dragon Palace Warriors!

“Hahaha, good good good, the beasts of the Dragon Palace, let’s see where you can escape to today!”

The Sky Mountain Sword sect warriors that were fighting with the warriors of the Dragon Palace all had expressions of excitement and malevolence!

The moment they were locked in, they wouldn’t be able to escape!

...

These undying emperors all had to stay here!

“There are two undying level 7 warriors, according to the information from other places, all the Undying Level 7 warriors are here!”

On a part of the Sky Mountain Business Planet, Ao Qi Tian looked at the two undying level 7 warriors from the Sky Mountain Sword sect flying over and smiled!

The last two were here!

“Let’s do it!”

Ao xing mu looked, taking out an array compass!

“Howl Howl!”

At the same time, Ao Qi let out a howl, rushing out from his hiding spot!

“I’ve been waiting for you for a long time, you’ve finally come!”

He howled madly, Blood Red Law Energies shot towards the two undying level 7 warriors!

Weng

...

At this time, the surrounding space underwent a terrifying change!

The world changed!

Sou Sou Sou

Below, law covered thorns shot towards the two Sky Mountain Sword sect ancestors!

“HM? What!”

“Undying level 7 strength, there’s an ambush!”

“Dragon Palace’s God Emperor?”

The two elders’faces turned cold when they saw Ao qi and ao Xingmu’s attacks!

“Ao Qitian of the Dragon Palace is here to take your dog lives!”

Ao Qitian’s body moved and he charged forward, waving the ocean-pacifying needle in his hand!

“Three!”

The two Sky Mountain Sword sect patriarchs’expressions changed when they saw Ao Qitian!

“I’ve disappointed you, there are more than three!”

Behind them, the Fire Hammer clan patriarch and a dragon palace mad dragon seed flew out and locked onto the two Sky Mountain Sword sect patriarchs!

“Roar, today is the Day Your Sky Mountain Sword sect dies!”

Behind them, a group of Dragon Palace members below Undying Level 7 flew over, their eyes staring at the 100 over Sky Mountain Sword sect emperors, filled with killing intent!

“What? There are warriors from the Dragon Palace hiding around!”

“Look, are those 5 undying level 7 warriors?”

“Shit, this strange space seems to be able to stop us from returning to the god country instantly!”

When Ao Qitian and the rest flew out from their hiding spots, everyone from Sky Mountain Sword sect looked over, their faces filled with shock!

Even the two Sky Mountain Sword sect patriarchs, who were full of arrogance, narrowed their eyes and stared at AO Qitian and the others with fear!

How could so many experts suddenly appear in the Dragon Palace?
