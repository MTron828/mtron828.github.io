Chapter 33: Respect

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“Father.”

The middle-aged man kneeling on the floor had cold sweat breaking on his forehead. He endured the pain and stood up as he saw his father spit out a mouthful of fresh blood. Then, he walked to the side of the old man.

“I’m fine.” The old man waved his hand with an ashen face. “Take a look at Xiao Jing and call the ambulance.”

The middle-aged man nodded. He swept a wary gaze at Wang Xian and walked quickly to his son.

“Xiao Jing, are you alright?”

The expression of the middle-aged man was awful as he placed his hand on the chest of the juvenile. Immediately, he fished for his phone and called an ambulance.

How could this young man be so formidable? I don’t think I was his match, even during my peak.

Xue Liangren coughed again as he observed Wang Xian with terror.

It never rains, but it pours. Not only did he sustain serious injuries, but his grandson also encountered a formidable expert.

He did not expect that the arrogant behavior of his grandson would bring such a disastrous consequence.

If the other party insisted on going after them, that would be simply an undeserved catastrophe for the Xue Family.

The moment he thought of this, Xue Liangren felt his injuries worsen. He staggered to a seat that had a briefcase on it. Without hesitation, he took out a checkbook and wrote $10 million on it.

This was a gift of apology. Even if they could not befriend him, they could never allow themselves to provoke such a young and formidable expert at this time.

Wang Xian did not bother about them as he peered at the three generations.

If someone provokes me, I’ll definitely pay them back. Otherwise, I would not provoke anyone without reason.

This was Wang Xian’s principle even though he possessed a powerful strength now.

Of course, he knew he needed to remove all source of trouble if they were his foes. After all, he had seen and read so many dramas and novels.

A good man died for his kindness while a scoundrel died for speaking too much.

“Young chap.”

When Wang Xian was about to hop in a cab and leave, the old man came to him slowly.

“Hur?” Wang Xian raised his eyebrow when he spun and looked at the old man.

“My grandson was reckless and offended you just now. I’m here to apologize on his behalf.”

The old man took the check in both hands and handed to Wang Xian.

“$10 million?” Wang Xian was shocked to see the figures on the cheque.

$10 million. This is $10 million. The old man is offering this amount of money as an apology.

He looked at the old man, stunned.

“Please accept it.” Seeing no response from Wang Xian, he thought Wang Xian was not going to forgive them. Hence, he pleaded again with trepidation.

Cough, cough. After he finished his sentence, he began to cough non-stop again. He quickly covered his mouth with his hand, but blood was dripping off from it.

Upon seeing this, Wang Xian took the check.

“Thank you for forgiving us.” The pale-looking old man had a faint smile on his face.

“Father.” When the middle-aged man at the side heard the coughing, he was so worried that he looked over and called to him.

“I will not take this money for nothing.” Wang Xian looked at the old man and said. He placed his palm on the chest area of that old man.

“Young chap.” The old man stiffened up when Wang Xian suddenly struck, as he was not able to resist him at all.

Without saying a word, an amount of Dragon Energy entered the old man’s body. Almost immediately, the condition of the old man appeared in Wang Xian’s mind.

“Hmm?” There was a black spot at the heart. Besides that, he found unique energy in eight extraordinary meridians which protected his heart. Otherwise, he would have been dead. Could this energy be so-called Internal Energy?

Wang Xian was doubtful when he was examining the injuries in the old man’s body.

He pressed his palm against the old man’s chest. As he gently pressed down his palm twice, the Dragon Energy traveled to the location where the black spot was. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The Dragon Energy was the most formidable energy of all. It could strengthen the physical body and upgrade marine animals. As such, it had a tremendous effect in healing too.

After consuming about 100 points of Dragon Energy, Wang Xian cleared up the black spot around his heart.

He pressed his palm again when he saw the clotted blood in the old man’s body.

“This...!” Just when the old man was freaked out, he suddenly felt a stream of warm energy envelope his heart.

Soon after, he felt something gush out of his throat, and he spat out a mouthful of black-colored blood!

“What are you doing? Don’t hurt my father. Otherwise, I’ll fight you out with my life...”

“Shut up!”

The middle-aged man had bloodshot eyes as he raged when his father spat out blood after Wang Xian placed his palm on his chest.

However, the old man stopped him before he could finish his sentence. Different from his previous breathless voice, he sounded full of energy.

“Young chap, you’re my benefactor. Thank you. Thank you for treating my injury. Thank you.”

The old man bent his body with his fists cupped as he bowed to Wang Xian.

His cheeks were blushed, and his eyes were filled with excitement.

The moment he spat the blood, he knew he was fully recovered from his injury.

The old man knew that this injury of his almost had his life. It was difficult to treat and recover from it.

Yet, what the young man before him did was place his palm at his chest, and it was healed after some presses. What kind of ability was this?

Even the disciples of the Medical Saint or one of the highly-skilled doctors from the Sacred Followers Guild would not be able to get this cured at this speed.

Is he the disciple of the Medical Saint? Or one of the disciples from the Sacred Followers Guild? This is freaking scary!

“You’re welcome, this will pay for your medical bills.” Wang Xian waved the check in his hand. He looked and walked over to the juvenile who was in a coma. “Might as well do it together.”

In a nutshell, the juvenile could only blame his condition on his luck as he offended Wang Xian, while he had no idea of the strength he possessed. In the end, he spat blood after his kick, and it almost cost him a life.

Since the old man gave $10 million, Wang Xian regarded it as their medical bills.

Wang Xian did not want to take advantage of others. Spending more than 100 points of Dragon Energy in exchange for $10 million was quite a good deal for him.

Wang Xian came to the juvenile and placed his hand on his chest.

Under the scan of the Dragon Energy, he realized that a few of his rib-bones were broken and one of them even pierced through his lungs. His injuries were rather severe. If not for his strong physique, he could have died by now.

Wang Xian shook his head and healed the juvenile with his Dragon Energy.

“Hur?” The juvenile opened his eyes as his injuries were slowly recovering. When he saw Wang Xian, he could not help but shudder.

“You should thank him for treating you. He forgave you and healed your injuries. You better apologize and thank him now!”

“Xiao Jing, apologize and thank him now. Our benefactor cured your grandfather and you. You should thank him.”

The juvenile was shocked when he heard what his grandfather and father said.

He stared, terrified, at the smiling Wang Xian, who possessed formidable strength that could kill him in one second.

“Big Brother, I’m sorry. I was acting impetuously just now. It’s all my fault. Thank you. Thank you for your magnanimous actions.”

The juvenile quickly answered without the previous self-conceited attitude.
