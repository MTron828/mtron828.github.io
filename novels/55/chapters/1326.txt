Chapter 1327: 1328 nameless sword demon’s true identity

Black Light, dark black light!

This was not the darkness attribute black light.

This was the heaven deceiver Pearl’s Black Light.

The Black Light went straight for long Xiaoyun’s long sword of light.

The long sword formed by the light attribute instantly collapsed, and the black light continued to attack forward.

“What?”

The power that was as hot as a hot knife through butter, that strange black light, and the long sword of light that was instantly destroyed, caused Long Xiaoyun to be stunned, and a stunned expression appeared on his face.

Looking at the black light that contained a terrifying amount of energy attacking towards him, his expression changed slightly.

“King of Light Sword!”

His expression became ugly, and he held the attack with both hands, and a thousand meter long sword of light attacked the black light.

Boom

A terrifying explosion was heard. The thousand-meter-long sword of light collided with the Black Ray and collapsed instantly.

The black ray seemed to have consumed all its energy and dissipated slowly.

Silence, a deathly silence!

Long Xiaoyun widened his eyes and stared at Wang Xian in disbelief.

His move actually required him to block it with all his strength!

Moreover, he had blocked it twice.

When everyone around saw this scene, they were also stunned!

Long Xiaoyun was at level three of the Seethrough realm. To think that..

To think that he only managed to break Wang Xian’s one move after two moves.

“Black Longsword, black sword ray. He is... He is the nameless sword demon!”

Suddenly, at a corner of the viewing platform, an expert at level two of the Seethrough realm stood up with a face full of shock and shouted loudly. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

His gaze was fixed on Wang Xian and his form was a little crazy!

He was the nameless sword demon!

He was the nameless sword demon!

The last six words echoed in everyone’s ears. Everyone stared blankly at Wang Xian, who was standing there calmly.

Slowly, they began to overlap with a figure in their minds.

It was a black sword with a special black light attack.

The terrifying strength of the nameless sword demon. He was the nameless sword demon.

He was the one who easily killed Qian Ye, the top ranker of the Heaven’s Pride Roll, on the Heaven’s Pride Stage!

He was the supreme prodigy who caused the king beasts of the demonic beasts clan to tremble.

“Wang Xian is the nameless sword demon. He is the supreme prodigy. Is... is this his real identity?”

“So, he is the nameless sword demon, the supreme prodigy!”

All the young and middle-aged men looked at Wang Xian with admiration and respect.

The two titles, the Nameless Sword Demon and the supreme prodigy, were earned by him with his powerful strength.

He was a true prodigy. Everyone in the Liuhai region had no choice but to submit to him.

No one expected that they would find out his real identity today.

“A few days ago, the nameless sword demon single-handedly killed a group of Frost sect experts in one move in the main hall of the main hall!”

“He even killed more than 20 demon beasts of the insightful void tier in one move, including seven to eight demon beasts of the second level of the insightful void tier. Some people said that the nameless sword demon’s strength was at least at the third level of the insightful void tier!”

The insightful void tier expert who had just cried out in surprise stared at Wang Xian’s figure while mumbling.

That day, he witnessed with his own eyes how the nameless sword demon killed more than 20 demonic beasts in an instant in the main hall.

That invincible look was deeply etched in his mind.

“Nameless Sword Demon, you are actually the Nameless Sword Demon!”

Long Xiaoyun’s arm that was holding the long sword of light trembled slightly as he stared at Wang Xian with an unsightly expression.

He had naturally heard of the name of the nameless sword demon.

The number one person since ancient times!

“Brother Wang Xian is actually the nameless sword demon. This...”

A glimmer of hope appeared in Long Xiaotian’s eyes.

However, very soon, when he saw the group of people from the Frost sect behind him, his expression turned gloomy again.

“The Nameless Sword Demon Huh? The supreme prodigy? Then I, Long Xiaoyun, will really challenge him today. Let me see how powerful the so-called supreme prodigy is!”

Slowly, a strong fighting spirit appeared on Long Xiaoyun’s face. He was Wang Xian, who had a cold gaze.

“You are not qualified!”

Wang Xian stared at Long Xiaoyun and smiled. His face was filled with disdain. He waved his arm and an attack that was filled with destruction instantly charged at him.

“You are too arrogant!”

Long Xiaoyun held the long sword of light tightly. A dazzling white light shot out from his body. “Dharma Idol, deathly light!”

The milky white light changed into a pale white color. A deathly aura condensed into long swords.

These long swords seemed to be made of bones and were extremely cold.

Deathly radiance was the powerful aspect that Long Xiaotian had mastered.

Faced with such a terrifying opponent like the nameless sword demon, he became completely serious.

“Trash!”

Wang Xian stood there after he swung his sword. Looking at the aspect that he had executed, there wasn’t the slightest fluctuation.

The deathly silent sword of light was like a lethal weapon that came from a corpse. It attacked the thousand-meter-long black ray that Wang Xian had swung.

The Dharma Idol was corporeal. Pale white swords of light tore towards the black ray.

Bang! Bang! Bang

Annihilation!

Annihilation!

“What?”

When Long Xiaoyun saw that his dharma idol was rapidly collapsing, an ugly expression appeared on his face.

“Buzz!”

In the next moment, the black light that covered an area of a thousand meters and was filled with a destructive aura suddenly sped up.

The Dharma Idol’s deathly silent light was instantly crushed.

“How is this possible? How is this possible!”

Seeing that his dharma idol was about to collapse, Long Xiaoyun widened his eyes. His eyes were filled with disbelief.

“Young master, be careful!”

The black light smashed towards the Dazed Long Xiaoyun.

A bald old man standing at the back had a cold glint in his eyes.

He moved his body and appeared in front of Long Xiaoyun in an instant.

“Roar!”

A roar was heard. The Bald Old Man let out a loud roar and an ice lion about 100 meters in size charged at the black ray of light.

“Bang Bang!”

The ice lion shattered the black ray of light. It floated in the sky like a living creature and stared at Wang Xian coldly.

“This... This long Xiaotian couldn’t withstand two moves from Wang Xian. Oh My God!”

“The sect master of the Frost sect has made his move. Long Xiaotian couldn’t withstand two moves from the nameless sword demon. Oh My God, the nameless sword demon is getting more and more terrifying!”

“The nameless sword demon is a supreme genius who can kill more than 20 demonic beasts with a wave of his hand. Even though Long Xiaoyun has obtained a great opportunity, the gap between him and the nameless sword demon is still huge!”

“But now, the sect master of the Frost sect has intervened. This is a top-notch expert who has lived for more than 2,000 years. If no one helps Wang Xian, he might be in danger. The eighth Prince will definitely not let him off!”

When everyone around saw Wang Xian defeating the eighth prince in two moves, their faces were filled with shock.

However, when they saw the sect master of the Frost sect suddenly charging over, all of them frowned.

If the Frost sect wanted to deal with the nameless sword demon Wang Xian, then Wang Xian would be in danger.

“People from the Frost sect!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly. His eyes were filled with killing intent.

“Nameless Sword Demon, we meet again!”

The bald old man stared at Wang Xian in astonishment. His eyes were sparkling.

“I didn’t kill all of you last time. This time, I can exterminate all of you from the Frost sect!”

Wang Xian raised his head slightly and his tone was filled with killing intent.

The moment he said that, the entire place was in an uproar!
