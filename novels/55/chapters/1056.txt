Translator: 5496903

“What’s going on? The holy sea town was attacked by ferocious beasts not long ago. How could it be attacked by ferocious beasts so quickly?”

“The Xilai town was actually breached. Hundreds of thousands of people died. This...”

Wang Xian, who was walking on the street, paused for a moment. A look of astonishment appeared on his face. Soon after, he frowned slightly.

“It seems that the demonic beast siege this time is a relatively big disaster!”

When Zhang Fengying heard the discussions around her, she also frowned slightly.

In the transcendence continent, most of the demonic beasts and humans were enemies.

When humans hunted and killed them, they would also attack humans.

Wang Xian had encountered a siege by the demonic beasts once in Shenghai town. That scene was indeed rather shocking.

However, the previous siege by ferocious beasts was only a small-scale siege. It did not pose any threat to Shenghai town.

However, this time around, Xilai town was destroyed. One could imagine how ferocious the demonic beasts and ferocious beasts would be this time around.

“I heard that the demonic beasts and ferocious beasts that attacked Xilai town are heading towards Shenghai town. If that’s the case, Shenghai Town will be in deep trouble!”

Buzz! Buzz

When the conversation came from the side again, Wang Xian’s communication stone tablet trembled.

He revealed a look of surprise. This communication stone tablet was sent by the Demon Hunters Academy. If it was trembling, it was usually a message sent by the Demon Hunters Academy.

Taking out the communication stone tablet, Wang Xian looked at the message on it and revealed a look of surprise.

“Let’s head to the Demon Hunters Academy!”

Apart from this message, there was also a message from teacher Ma. It was for him to make a trip to the academy. He had a special mission.

“There’s a message from the demon Hunters Academy. I have to rush over!”

Wang Xian said to Zhang Fengying.

“Okay, you can go!”

Zhang Fengying nodded thoughtfully and headed home.

Wang Xian walked towards the demon Hunters Academy. It had been a long time since he last went to the academy.

When he arrived at the classroom, teacher Ma was giving a speech in the class training ground.

“Student Wang Xian, please come in!”

Teacher Ma immediately walked to his side and said with a smile.

“Teacher Ma, is there something urgent?”

Wang Xian looked at him curiously and asked. He didn’t know why the Demon Hunters Academy had summoned him here.

“Something has happened to Xilai town under Donghai City. The entire town has been destroyed. Currently, the group of demonic beasts and ferocious beasts are heading towards Shenghai Town!”

Teacher Ma said, he handed Wang Xian a document and said, “The city Lord and the Dean have given the order. The Demon Hunters Academy has sent elite students to Shenghai town to provide support. Vice Dean Zhao wants Wang Xian to lead the team over!”

“I’ll lead the team?”

Wang Xian was astonished.

“That’s right. Wang Xian, you are from Shenghai Town and have a good understanding of Shenghai town. Furthermore, with your abilities, you are strong enough to lead the team of our Demon Hunters College!”

“For this mission, not only our demon hunters college, the ocean cultivator college and the East Ocean College will also send their elite students there to provide support!”

“Apart from you guys, there will be many instructors who will be there as well. There will also be people from the ocean cultivator army!”

Teacher Ma explained to Wang Xian.

“Is the situation at Shenghai town so serious? Do you need the experts from the East Ocean City to come and rescue you?”

Wang Xian revealed a look of surprise.

“It’s very serious. This time, the ocean cultivator army has deployed a quarter of their forces!”

Teacher Ma said with a serious expression, “Xilai town has been breached. All the refugees have poured into Shenghai town. If shenghai town is breached again, it will be troublesome. When all the refugees pour into Donghai City, Donghai City will not be able to withstand it!”

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment and nodded. “Alright, I’ll make a trip to Shenghai Town!”

“Alright, don’t worry, Wang Xian. The instructors of the academy will be following US this time. I’ll bring you there. The other students should have arrived by now!”

Teacher Ma said to Wang Xian.

“Okay!”

He nodded and followed behind teacher Ma as they walked towards the back of the academy.

In the class, the students looked at Wang Xian’s figure with an interesting expression on their faces. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The captain of the Academy’s mission this time?

Let him lead the team?

One had to know that Wang Xian was only a new student. Furthermore, he was a new student who had not attended the academy for a few days!

What the F * ck...

“There are five instructors following you guys on this mission. Apart from training, your main mission is to help protect Shenghai Town!”

“This mission is also one of the graduation assessment missions for the grade 10 students of the Demon Hunter College. There will be more than 500 grade 10 students participating!”

Along the way, teacher Ma explained to Wang Xian.

He nodded silently at the side.

As for being the team leader of the Demon Hunter College this time around, he didn’t have much of an opinion.

No matter what, the Demon Hunter College treated him very well. It wasn’t right for him to reject it.

“This mission is a collective mission. This is also one of your graduation missions. In addition, during the process of the mission, there will be points. The points will be determined by killing all the ferocious beasts and demonic beasts. In addition, there will be a team leader leading the team this time around. Everyone must obey the orders of the team leader!”

Wang Xian came to a square in the senior students’area. As soon as he walked in, he heard vice-principal Zhao’s voice.

“Vice-principal, I will be the team leader. I will definitely be able to command all the students well. I guarantee that ocean and east ocean academy will be obedient underlings in front of us!”

A young man’s voice rang out. Wang Xian saw a young man dressed in black walking out proudly with a longsword in his hands. He spoke with confidence.

“We support this. Leader Qian Hu is the number one mercenary leader in our demon Hunter College. His strength and commanding ability are questionable. We agree!”

A student immediately said loudly.

Deputy Leader Zhao stood at the front. Qian Hu, who took a step forward, waved his hand and said, “The college has already arranged a leader for this mission. This leader comes from Shenghai town. He will be of great help to this mission!”

“Huh?”

Qian Hu was slightly taken aback. The smile on his face slowly disappeared.

“The team leader has already been appointed? Who Is It? It Can’t be the mentor, right? Didn’t the deputy director say that the mentor would only be assisting from the side?”

“Is there anyone in Shenghai Town who is more qualified than leader Qian Hu?”

The students who were about to graduate had a look of surprise on their faces.

“Wang Xian, you’re here. Let’s get to know each other!”

Vice President Zhao sensed Wang Xian’s arrival and waved at him with a smile on his face.

Wang Xian’s strength was at least at level seven of the supernatural realm. Moreover, he was the captain of a golden mercenary group. His strength and commanding ability were unquestionable.

The main reason why Wang Xian came over this time was because of his strength.

Level seven of the extraordinary realm was unrivaled among the three great students of East Ocean City. He could easily suppress the east ocean academy and the ocean cultivator academy.

He also wanted to show off the strength and prestige of their demon Hunter Academy.

Thinking of this, Deputy Dean Zhao couldn’t help but smile.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and walked toward the front desk.

The students were stunned!

What’s going on?

Who is he?
