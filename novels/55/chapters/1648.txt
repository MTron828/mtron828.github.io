Chapter 1649: 1649 what Heaven’s Pride? A dragon among men? down

“Time’s up. You Can Die Now!”

“Pa!”

Under the astonished gazes of everyone on the top floor of the restaurant, the wine in the unfamiliar young man’s hand fell to the ground. Following that, the porcelain cup in his hand also fell to the ground.

A crisp sound and cold words rang out, causing everyone in the restaurant to be slightly stunned.

Buzz

Wang Xian waved his arm and a wave of destructive energy directly attacked everyone in the restaurant.

“What?”

“Who are you?”

In the restaurant, Jiang Xinghuo and the rest felt Wang Xian’s terrifying attack. Their faces were filled with horror and terror.

However, Wang Xian did not pay any attention to them.

He stood there without saying a word and looked at everyone with an expressionless face.

“Run!”

Jiang Xinghuo stood up hurriedly with a face full of horror.

However, at this moment, a terrifying attack covered the entire top floor of the restaurant. His face was filled with horror as he froze.

Wang Xian waved his arm and the corpses of more than 30 people on the top floor were directly stored into his interspatial ring.

What Heaven’s Pride?

What Dragon among men?

In front of him, he was just a weakling.

As the saying goes, before everyone’s Peerless Heaven’s pride, Peerless Heaven’s pride, and Dragon among men had matured, they were all trash!

In the world of the strong, there were only the strong!

“Murder!”

At this moment, sounds of exclamations could be heard from outside.

Wang Xian stood there and looked down with a smile on his face.

In his line of sight, numerous strange demons were flying towards him at a terrifying speed.

They entered Wang Xian’s acceptance spirit pouch directly.

“Dragon King, it’s a success. Everyone Is Here!”

Ao Yao’s voice rang in Wang Xian’s ears.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian swept a glance at the terrifying aura that surged from the center and revealed a cold smile on his face. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

His figure flashed and appeared 20 kilometers away in an instant.

After completely fusing with the heart of darkness, he would also possess all of Ao Yao’s abilities.

As long as it was not an attack formation that was controlled by humans, the other defensive formations would have no effect on him.

After two flashes, his figure appeared 40 kilometers away.

Wang Xian flew further away based on the memories in his mind.

“Who did it? Who Did It?”

“Reporting to Grand Elder, all the members in the 50 shops of our life and Death Elixir Workshop have disappeared. All the elixirs have also disappeared!”

Less than three seconds after Wang Xian left, figures with a terrifying aura flew over.

An old man with the words “Life and death”embroidered on his clothes roared angrily. His body trembled when he heard the report from his subordinates.

“What did you say? All the members have disappeared and all the elixirs have disappeared?”

The old man scanned his surroundings furiously. With a wave of his hand, he attacked the tallest tower in the city.

“Weng!”

A terrifying energy directly surrounded the entire city, and the city was directly sealed.

“What’s going on?”

“What happened? Why is the city closed? That seems to be the grand elder of the life and Death Pill Workshop!”

“It seems like the life and Death Pill Workshop has been ransacked. All the people have disappeared!”

“How is this possible? Every pill workshop has a fifth level profound void martial artist guarding it. There are a total of fifty fifth level profound void martial artists!”

When everyone in the entire city saw the formation seal, their faces revealed a shocked expression as they discussed in succession.

“How is it possible to raid fifty of your shops in an instant? This is absolutely not something that one person can accomplish!”

“Each shop has an expert guarding it. This requires at least a hundred sixth rank void interpretation experts to be able to do it!”

“However, even if there are a hundred experts at the sixth level of the void interpretation realm, they wouldn’t be able to move so fast. Where Are They Now?”

The expert from the holy item forging workshop scanned his surroundings. With a wave of his arm, one one-eyed crow after another flew over from the center of the city.

There were over a dozen cyan crows that were more than ten meters in size. They had a single eye between their brows, and they looked somewhat terrifying.

“Eye crows, check if there are any suspicious people.”

The expert from the holy item forging workshop said directly.

“It’s the Grand Elder!”

The dozen cyan crows spoke in human language and hovered in the sky above the city. Their huge eyes coldly swept over everyone!

Under the eye crows’eyes, no one who was suspicious could hide.

“Even half a step to longevity can’t do it in just a few seconds!”

A supreme elder of the holy item forging workshop frowned. Fortunately, it wasn’t their holy item forging workshop that was robbed this time.

But even so, at this moment, it made them a little nervous.

“Our Life and Death Pill Workshop put tens of thousands of insightful void tier pills here. There are also hundreds of thousands of pills below insightful void tier!”

“There are also 50 experts above the fifth rank of the profound void tier. It must be the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan. It must be their doing!”

An angry voice was spat out from the mouths of the two grand elders of the life and Death Pill Workshop. They directly floated in the sky as they swept their surroundings with dense expressions.

So many medicinal pills. This was an incomparably huge blow to their life and Death Pill Workshop.

It was no exaggeration to say that one-tenth of the medicinal pills in their entire life and death pill workshop were here!

It was even more than the losses from the previous war with the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan!

“The Fire Cloud Sparrow clan shouldn’t have this ability. Could it be that they found some helpers?”

The Supreme Elder of the holy item forging workshop frowned.

Facing such a terrifying clan like the fire cloud sparrow, they were filled with fear everywhere.

After all, that was once the personal guard race of the number one empress of the continent.

“Damn it, damn it!”

“Search, search for me, search the entire area!”

The two half-step longevity experts from the life and Death Elixir Workshop roared furiously.

Everyone in the city was filled with shock.

“It seems that half-step longevity is not as powerful as I thought!”

Wang Xian flew in the sky with a smile on his face.

In fact, the gap between Wang Xian and half-step longevity was not huge.

Half-step longevity meant that they could teleport after comprehending the ninth level of the domain.

They could use their domain to suppress their enemies.

However, the distance of their teleportation was about the same as the distance of Wang Xian’s current teleportation. The only difference was that they had one more domain to attack.

Although there was a gap between Wang Xian and them, the gap was not too big.

“There are so many elixirs here. Taking out a quarter of them is enough to raise ao Yao’s level!”

Wang Xian looked at the elixirs in his interspatial ring and smiled.

He came to a safe place in the sky and swallowed all the elixirs.

One by one, the pills were converted into dragon energy. Tens of thousands of insightful void-level pills were swallowed.

Under hundreds of thousands of insightful void-level pills, the top-tier pills among transcendents were swallowed.

Following that, Wang Xian transferred the Dragon Energy to Ao Yao’s body.

A seventh-level insightful void-level dragon species, fighting two levels above it!
