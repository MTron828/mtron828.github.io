Translator: 549690339

Time passed slowly.

Ever since the Dragon Gate’s Powerhouse killed the immortal God, the Grand Elder of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect suddenly appeared and decided to destroy the Dragon Gate, the entire jianghu was in an uproar.

A Day had passed. All the immortal sects in Jianghu were waiting for news from the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect.

The immortal god of the Xuanyuan and Yuwen clan had already passed. Everyone was waiting for the outcome!

At this moment, Wang Xian and the group of girls were at the leisure area on the floating island.

Wang Xian was lying on the sofa in satisfaction. Guan Shuqing was playing with the heavenly dog while Xiao Yu and the rest were playing with their phones and paying attention to the happenings on the Jianghu Internet.

When he was about to kill the immortals and the grand elder of the Holy Medicine Sect, Wang Xian had brought all the members of the Dragon Palace back.

It was time to end this. There was no point in blocking the city gates anymore.

However, the fact that the two immortal sects had a superior immortal was a little out of Wang Xian’s expectations.

Even so, Wang Xian was not afraid at all. He had already reached the level of a superior immortal. Even if they were to fight now, the Dragon Palace was more than enough to accept the challenge.

“Ah, the Holy Doctor and Holy Medicine Immortal sect has made a statement. They asked brother to apologize personally and sent an immortal God for them to kill. After that, they took out a large amount of resources to compensate us and let us off. HMPH, the people of the two immortal sects are really arrogant. They actually threatened to destroy us as long as we didn’t take them out!”

At this moment, an angry voice came from Xiao Yu’s side.

“Come, let me take a look!”

Wang Xian reached out his hand and took Xiao Yu’s phone. He looked at the statement issued by the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine sect with a smile.

“Hehe!”

He took a look and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

This result was obviously the result of the discussion between the two sects and Xuanyuan Yuwen.

Only when he admitted defeat and offered compensation would the two immortal sects let him go. Otherwise, they would still exterminate their Dragon Gate three days later!

This made Wang Xian smile coldly.

Exterminating his dragon gate, they were really arrogant.

It was not certain who would exterminate who.

However, the news from the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect shocked all the disciples of the immortal sects.

It seemed that the result of their negotiation with the Xuanyuan Yuwen clan had come out, and the two immortal sects had raised this condition.

“How should the Dragon sect choose?”

“This condition is very harsh. The Dragon King may not agree, but if he doesn’t agree, he may be directly destroyed!”

“The Holy Medicine sect has a superior immortal, and the overall situation has changed in an instant!”

On the jianghu, all the disciples of the immortal sects looked at the news silently. Three days had passed, and the next two days would soon come.

Another Day had passed, but the Dragon Gate did not reply. The entire jianghu was paying attention to this matter.

Once the Dragon King did not admit defeat, it would be a war between immortals and gods. At that time, more immortals would die, and even the entire Dragon Gate would be destroyed.

However, in the past two days, the disciples of the two immortal sects had been completely elated. They had been shouting proudly on the Jianghu website that the Dragon Gate would definitely be destroyed and the Dragon Gate would definitely die!

All the disciples of the immortal sects also agreed very much. Now that even the Xuan Yuan clan and the Yuwen clan had compromised on the agreement between the Immortals and gods, the strength of the two immortal sects was truly unstoppable.

If the Dragon Gate didn’t know what was good for them, the consequences would be disastrous.

Other than them escaping, they must never be discovered by the two immortal sects and become a stray dog.

The storm was coming, the tranquility before the storm!

The closer the time was, the entire jianghu could feel a depressing atmosphere.

Everyone’s gaze was fixed on the Jiang City and the area of Yao Ding.

Wang Xian stood at the highest point of the floating island and looked at the ocean in front of him.

He was considering whether he should fight or wait.

If he waited for some time, he would wait until the nine-headed Hui broke through.

If he were to fight, it would be a draw at most.

“Dragon King!”

At this moment, Prime Minister Gui’s figure suddenly appeared at the bottom of the ocean in front of him.

Wang Xian was slightly surprised. “Prime Minister Gui, why are you here?”

“Dragon King, you once told me that if the nine-headed Hui...”

“You mean!”

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up and a smile appeared on his face.

“Yes!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded his head.

“Hehe, even the heavens want you to be exterminated as soon as possible!”

A faint smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face. “Tomorrow Night, call all the immortals and deities of the Dragon Palace over!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded his head heavily.

“Three days later, give them a surprise!”

Wang Xian looked at the Holy Medicine sect and revealed a cold smile on his face.

The third day had arrived. All the disciples of the Holy Medicine sect in the martial arts world were paying attention to the information on the martial arts world’s internet and the situation of the Dragon sect.

Just as many people expected, the Dragon King of the Dragon sect did not respond at all.

The next big battle was inevitable!

“Dragon Gate, today, even if you run to the ends of the Earth, we, the Holy Doctor, Holy Medicine Immortal Sect, Will Destroy You!”

On the morning of the third day, a roar reverberated through the entire world!

“Destroy the Dragon Gate!”

“Kill the Dragon Gate!”

“Kill all of them!”

At the Holy Doctor, Holy Medicine Immortal sect, located in yaoding, twelve immortal gods were floating above the east gate.

Behind them, more than 1,000 experts from the two immortal sects were fully armed and following behind them. Each of them was full of fighting spirit and killing intent.

In the holy city, all the disciples and family members of the two immortal sects were shouting with excitement on their faces. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Today’s expedition will definitely eliminate every disciple of the Dragon Gate and hang the head of the Dragon King on the holy city to warn everyone of the consequences if they dare to oppose our Holy Medicine Immortal Sect!”

The burly grand elder who was clad in fiery red armor shouted with a cold face.

“Yes, kill the Dragon King, kill the Dragon King!”

The group of experts from the Holy Doctor Holy Medicine Immortal sect roared loudly. Their voices shook the sky and filled the entire area with a murderous aura.

“Hiss, this is simply too terrifying!”

At this moment, within a range of ten to twenty kilometers, a dense group of experts from the immortal sects floated in the sky and looked in the direction of the two great immortal sects.

Seeing the terrifying aura coming from there, all of them sucked in a breath of cold air.

This battle had attracted the attention of countless experts from the immortal sects. This was a battle that attracted the attention of tens of thousands of people.

“This time, the Dragon Gate is doomed!”

An immortal God hidden in the void slowly sighed.

A high-level immortal, three middle-level immortals, and eight lower-level immortals. This power could disregard the agreement between the Immortals and gods. It was too shocking!

“Holy Medicine, Holy Medicine, son, follow me into battle!”

“Holy Medicine, Holy Medicine, son, follow me into battle!”

The two immortal gods roared loudly, and their earth-shaking voices rang out once more.

“Fight, fight, Fight!”

The Disciples of the Holy Medicine Immortal sect roared loudly, their faces slightly red.

Fight with the immortal gods and destroy the Dragon Gate!

All of the Immortal Gods of the Holy Medicine Immortal sect brought with them the top-tier fighting power of the immortal sect. They looked forward with a mighty momentum.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

At this moment, an earth-shaking roar was heard.

Nine roars and the space trembled!
