Chapter 1458: The 1458 flowing sea region was shaken

“The Blood Emperor and the three emperors were directly killed by the experts led by Lord Wang in the Imperial City of blood flow!”

“The third trading company in the world, a rank 7 insightful void realm expert, was killed by the emperor of the Wildlands!”

“The emperor of the wildlands, an invincible emperor of rank 7 insightful void realm, was actually Lord Wang’s subordinate!”

“The Demon Beast clan submitted, and the blood flow empire was destroyed. The entire world would belong to the Flowing Emperor Alliance, as well as that Lord Wang’s world!”

“All the factions will submit to the Flowing Emperor Alliance, and the Flowing Sea region will be unified!”

All the humans in the flowing sea region were shocked!

After Wang Xian and the rest killed the blood emperor and the three emperors, the powerhouse from the third trading company in the world let out an indignant roar.

In just two short days, this matter swept through every corner and city in the flowing sea region like a hurricane.

And even every town.

When everyone heard this news, their eyes widened, and their faces were filled with shock.

Each piece of news was more shocking than the last.

The entire Liuhai region had 1600 to 700 cities, and there were 3000 to 4000 cities and towns, with a population of 10 to 20 billion people.

Everyone’s eyes widened, and they communicated with each other in shock.

Five days later, five shocking news spread throughout the entire Liuhai region

First, the dragon-phoenix Dynasty announced that it would change its name to the dragon-phoenix dynasty.

The dragon-phoenix Dynasty would take over all the cities and territories of the blood flow dynasty. Anyone who resisted would die.

Second, the newly established Barbarian Dynasty announced that it would join the dragon-phoenix dynasty. Other than the demon Lin Demon Beast clan, the sickle-tailed Snake Demon Beast Clan, and the Ghost Monkey Clan, which were three demon beast clans, as well as more than ten small demon beast clans, the rest were all citizens of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire.

They lived in the human-demon graveyard.

Third, the Flowing Emperor Alliance still existed, with the Dragon and Phoenix Empress, Sect Master Ling of the Sky Sword sect, the Light Dragon King, and sect master Yi of the blood stream sect as the main force, with the rest of the forces supporting them.

Fourth, the Divine Wind Academy, the Hanhai dynasty, and the other neutral dynasty forces joined the Flowing Emperor Alliance.

Fifthly, Empress Dragon and Phoenix had decided to move the imperial city to the tomb of the demi-humans to rebuild the glory of the ancient blood stream sect.

News came one after another. All the humans in the flowing sea region knew that the flowing sea region might be unified!

This unification would probably happen within the next few years.

However, even now, everyone knew that there was an additional person in control of the flowing sea region. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

That was Wang Xian!

The Liuhai region also had a real emperor, the Empress of dragons and phoenixes.

Although the current Empress of dragons and Phoenixes did not live up to her name, as long as Wang Xian was still alive, the Empress would be the empress.

After half a year, the entire Liuhai region changed drastically.

Half a year later, another piece of news that shocked the Liuhai region came. The main hall of the demi-human cemetery had been breached by the Empress of dragons and phoenixes.

The Dragon and Phoenix Empress had completely taken control of everything in the demi-human cemetery.

The main hall, the Heaven’s pride stage, the training grounds, and the blood refinement grounds!

Furthermore, the Dragon and Phoenix Empress had issued one decree after another. Human and Demon Beasts coexisted peacefully, and human and Demon Beasts traded.

The Dragon and Phoenix Imperial City began to build on the foundation of the demi-human Cemetery!

“Phew, after taking control of the main hall, the rest of the demi-human cemetery can also be controlled. The next development will be much smoother!”

However, at this moment, at the top floor of the main hall of the human-demon graveyard, Feng Luan heaved a heavy sigh of relief.

“Empress, your development is simply too fast now. Your Foundation is a little lacking. You will have to settle down for a period of time!”

“Even I didn’t expect that in the past two years, you had conquered the entire Liuhai region!”

The top floor of the main hall was about two kilometers in size. The rich spiritual energy was only slightly weaker than the Dragon Palace.

In the splendid room, an old woman and two old men stood in front of Feng Luan. Each of them was like an unfathomable starry sky that made one’s heart palpitate.

“I have to thank Wang Xian for this. If it wasn’t for him, I would still be governing a small country in a city!”

Feng Luan smiled and looked at Wang Xian who was sitting at the side. Her eyes were filled with smiles.

The old lady looked over and her eyes were filled with shock.

Wang Xian naturally knew that when they met two years ago, the other party’s strength was not even at the insightful void stage.

However, in such a short period of time, the other party’s strength was even stronger than their empress.

Their empress was equivalent to being reborn and cultivating again. Her cultivation speed was more than ten times faster than those Peerless Heaven’s favorites.

The old lady never expected that he could help the empress dominate the flowing sea region in such a short period of time.

Wang Xian smiled at the side and didn’t say anything. He was in a good mood as he checked the information in his interspatial ring.

“But now, my strength is still too weak. It will take some time for me to completely unify the flowing sea region. Moreover, just as you said, I need to settle down for a while!”

Feng Luan frowned slowly and said in deep thought.

Her strength could not keep up with Wang Xian’s development speed.

This time, it was Wang Xian who forcefully helped the dragon-phoenix Empire to advance to the dragon-phoenix Empire.

His strength was still at level four of the Seethrough realm. He could fight against level five of the Seethrough realm. However, just like the blood flow empire, the blood emperor’s strength had to reach level six of the Seethrough realm.

It was also because of her weak strength that the flowing Emperor Alliance did not disband.

Only when she reached level five of the profound void tier, or even level six of the profound void tier, would she be able to directly take over the flowing Emperor Alliance.

Only then would the Light Dragon King and Sect Master Ling be completely convinced.

Back then, when the Phoenix Empire was upgraded to the empire by her, it took a whole thousand years.

Even so, such a rapid upgrade to the Empire still shocked the entire continent.

Feng Luan was also known as the number one empress throughout the ages.

However, when she upgraded the Empire to the Empire, it took her two hundred years.

Now, it was only two years. Many things could not keep up.

This time, she was able to control the main hall because she called the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan over. Otherwise, with her strength, she would not be able to control it at all.

“Feng Luan, go to the Dragon Pool and try!”

At this moment, Wang Xian, who was sitting at the side, suddenly spoke to her.

“Enter the Dragon Pool?”

Feng Luan was slightly stunned before a contemplative look appeared on her face.

Speaking of which, she had absorbed energy from the Dragon Pool and was reborn. She could be considered a member of the Dragon Palace.

As long as the members of the Dragon Palace had sufficient dragon blood, they would be able to directly increase their levels in the dragon pool.

She only found out about this not too long ago. However, she didn’t think about it at that time.

“I’ll give it a try!”

Feng Luan’s eyes flickered. Once her strength was able to increase tremendously, it would be easier for her to completely control the flowing sea region.

“How’s the situation at the third trading company in the world, the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop?”

Wang Xian asked Feng Luan again.

“It has been settled. Through the fire Lark clan, we used some methods to make them give up on the flowing sea region completely!”

Feng Luan said to Wang Xian.

“That’s good. I’m going back to the Dragon Palace to rest!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he stood up and walked out.
