Chapter 178: Maniac Ji

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

The offer from Maniac Ji made the four main bidders hesitate.

It wasn’t because they were afraid of the Maniac Ji’s strength.

For a Level 4 Spiritual fruit, they would dare to continue bidding even if they were going against Maniac Ji.

However, Maniac Ji’s offer was too high.

A Level 4 Spiritual fruit was worth around eighty spiritual stones. It would not be a good deal for them if the price went any higher.

“85 Spiritual Stone! Maniac Ji’s offer is too high!”

“In order to cure his son, Maniac Ji is searching all over the world for all kinds of spiritual medicine. He won’t be concerned about the price.”

“Sigh, it seems like Maniac Ji is going to win the bid for this Spiritual fruit.”

“Putting Maniac Ji aside, who is this young man? He can’t be simple especially since he has a Leve 4 Spiritual Fruit.”

“I agree, he can’t be simple. Since he dares to mock the Little Sword Celestial, he definitely has someone’s backing.”

Those who were around started to whisper as they witnessed the events unfolded.

Wang Xian looks satisfied especially when he saw the four main powers stopped increasing their bid. He was contented with 85 Spiritual Stones. These added up to 8,500 grams. Although it was still far from the target of one ton, at least there was progress.

Wang Xian said, “Congratulations, Senior Ji, for securing this Spiritual Fruit!”

He smiled as he looked at Maniac Ji and walked towards him with the fruit.

Maniac Ji nodded and looked at Wang Xian.

“Take this!” Wang Xian said as he put the Spiritual fruit beside him.

Maniac Ji picked up the fruit and retrieved 85 Spiritual Stones from the bag beside him. “For you, Miracle Doctor Wang!” he said.

“Oh?”

“You know me?” Wang Xian replied with surprise.

“I am familiar with all the Miracle Doctors that are ranked in the top-50s. Since Miracle Doctor Wang had defeated Fang Huazi who was ranked Eighteen, I would have definitely heard about you,” Maniac Ji said with a blank face.

“I see.” Wang Xian laughed. He looked at Maniac Ji and continued, “Senior Ji, do you want me to take a look at your son?”

“Your medical skills are still insufficient!” Maniac Ji commented calmly.

“Don’t you want me to give it a try? After all, your son’s conditions are already as such. What if I can cure him?” Wang Xian insisted with a smile on his face. There was also a tinge of excitement in his tone.

“Get out of my sight! Or die!”

At this moment, Maniac Ji lifted his head slightly with killing intent clearly directed towards Wang Xian.

Those who said such things about his son were courting death.

“What’s going on? That young man offended Maniac Ji?”

“F*ck, he must be courting death. How dare he offend Maniac Ji! That’s equivalent to seeking his demise!”

At this moment, those in front of them visibly felt the intense killing intent. Everyone’s heart skipped a beat and turned their attention over.

“This guy is courting death. I hope Maniac Ji kills that young man!”

A flicker of surprise flashed across Liu Feiyun’s eyes as he spoke and gloated.

Elder Fang and Xiao Yu looked over hysterically.

Maniac Ji was seated in the last row and the seats in the middle were empty. As a result, many did not overhear their conversation.

However, they knew that the young man had offended Maniac Ji.

“This is Maniac Ji’s style! Killing a person once he gets into an argument!”

As Wang Xian felt Maniac Ji’s aura, he did not care much. He stretched his hand over to tap on Maniac Ji’s shoulder.

When Maniac Ji saw the composed looks on Wang Xian, bloodthirst welled up in him as he grabbed towards Wang Xian’s arm.

Pak-Pak!

Wang Xian’s arm was stopped by Maniac Ji. However, he still managed to tap on Maniac Ji’s shoulder twice.

“If you believe in my medical skills, you can look for me at Old street. You know it!”

Wang Xian smiled while he turned and left.

“Hmm? What’s going on? Why didn’t Maniac Ji strike?”

“The young man must have said something that offended Maniac Ji. However, Maniac Ji probably did not want to kill him!”

“Although Maniac Ji is eccentric, he doesn’t kill the innocent. He probably has clear rules on who he should or should not kill!”

At this moment, no one saw the astonished looks on Maniac Ji hidden behind his long and messy hair.

He looked blankly at his palm which was blood-flushed, and he was in awe.

“He... How could he be so strong!” Maniac Ji mumbled to himself.

Just a few moments ago, he had felt fear trickling down his soul when his palm touched the young man’s arm. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

He was certain that the young man was stronger than him, and the difference was huge.

Wang Xian smiled as he walked to Xiao Yu and Elder Fang’s side.

It was all his intentions to speak so much to Maniac Ji and even taunt him with words.

He had his own thoughts for providing treatment to Maniac Ji’s son.

He felt that it was time that he paid more attention to the construction of the Dragon Palace. In the near future, he should try to look for the resources required.

The trading session continued to about 3 pm in the afternoon.

When the trading session ended, Wang Xian, Elder Fang and Xiao Yu smiled and exited the venue.

It had been a fruitful trip for Wang Xian today.

Suzaku’s essence blood, 85 Spiritual Stones, $500 million in cash and relevant information about Spiritual Stones!

He was thrilled.

The Ancient Martial Arts Families and Sects from the Southern Province, Hailing Province and Dongqing Province were left in bewilderment as they looked at them leaving.

Lan Qingyue looked at Wang Xian and hesitated. After a while, she quickened her pace and walked towards him. She called out, “Wang Xian!”

The voice shocked Wang Xian. He turned around and smiled.

Lan Qingyue said gratefully, “Thank you for the day!”

Wang Xian smiled and replied, “That’s not necessary. We are classmates after all!”

Lan Qingyue smiled and replied, “Still, I should thank you!”

At a few meters away, Liu Feiyun was beaming with killing intent as he thought to himself. Damn you brat! And you, Lan Qingyue! You will be marrying me in the near future and yet you are acting so flirtatiously!

He clenched his fist tightly.

Liu Feiyun was deeply embarrassed today.

Liu Feiyun looked at his butler and said with rage, “Butler Zhao! Check it out, I want to know the background of this brat and where he obtained the Spiritual Fruit from. I want him dead and I want you to bring his head to me!”

“Yes, Young Master!” Butler Zhao replied and nodded.

Liu Feiyun had a savage expression on his face and mumbled, “It will be our engagement ceremony in five days you dare to mix with an external guy right here? Lan Qingyue, I will definitely give you a surprise once we are engaged! I will make you submit to me under my crouch!”

...

After a brief chat with Lan Qingyue, the two went their own ways.

Wang Xian wasn’t clear about his feelings for Lan Qingyue. Nonetheless, he knew that there was a sense of guilt.

After driving into the villa, Elder Fang brought Xiao Yu to train.

As for Wang Xian, he went to the courtyard, got a big vase, and filled it with soil before bringing the vase with soil to the top of the villa. After which, he planted various spiritual grasses in it.

He nodded with satisfaction and lay down under the sunshade umbrella by the side. He then took out his phone and called Guan Shuqing.

Wang Xian pondered about getting her to the villa and then...

Hehehe!
