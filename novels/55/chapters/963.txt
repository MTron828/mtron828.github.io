“Get lost. Get out of our sight immediately and don’t appear in our sight. Otherwise, don’t blame us for being rude!”

Wang Xian and the people from the Zhou Chamber of Commerce were walking at the front while everyone from the caravan followed behind.

A few people from the mercenary group spoke to supervisor Du and elder Xiao who had ashen faces.

The people from the Green Vine Chamber of Commerce and the Xiao Chamber of Commerce had despair written all over their faces.

All their resources had been taken away, and now they were chased out of the caravan. How were they supposed to go back?

This was no different from sending themselves to their deaths.

“Get lost!”

A member of the mercenary group pushed elder Xiao Hard and pushed him to the ground.

Their mercenary group had suffered heavy losses on this trip.

However, all of the reasons were because of the green vine chamber of Commerce and the Xiao Chamber of Commerce.

If it weren’t for them, this mission would have been smooth. There wouldn’t have been so many deaths, and they wouldn’t have to be on tenterhooks every day.

They would have been able to smoothly obtain a decent reward!

Then, they would have to take out a sum of spirit stones when they arrived at the Eastern Sea with the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group.

Therefore, when they learned of what the Green Vine Chamber of Commerce and the Xiao Chamber of Commerce had done, everyone’s faces were filled with anger.

“You will die a horrible death!”

Elder Xiao fell on the rock, his eyes bloodshot as he growled.

However, what responded to them was a cold gaze.

Seeing the caravan quickly disappear from their sight, supervisor du and elder Xiao sat on the rock with despair on their faces, their eyes lifeless.

Without protection, with their extraordinary second or third rank strength, their chances of survival were less than 10% .

“Commander Wang, all the goods in the caravan are worth about 13 million middle-grade spirit stones. This is their receipt. Take a look!”

“When we arrive at Donghai City, I will sell all the goods to you, Commander Wang!”

Father Zhou counted all the goods and came to Wang Xian with a smile. He said respectfully.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and smiled.

Although the commission for this mission was only 50,000 spirit stones, the reward was not low.

Excluding the one-time extraordinary eighth-level formation, the reward was 17 to 8 million middle-grade spirit stones. It was not bad.

The caravan traveled at a fast speed. With Ao Yao and the rest on guard, as long as they did not encounter any powerful demonic beasts of the insightful void tier, there was not much danger.

After two days of turbulence, Wang Xian and the rest finally arrived in front of a huge city.

The city wall was a hundred meters tall and the huge black city gate was seventy to eighty meters tall.

Rows of elite soldiers stood neatly on the city wall.

The huge city was incomparably majestic and exuded an ancient aura.

Compared to it, the holy sea town was on a completely different level.

East Sea city had a population of over ten million, and it was close to the ocean. The entire city had existed for over three thousand years.

East Sea city was one of star-moon kingdom’s ten great cities.

Star-moon kingdom had ten great cities and eighty towns.

East Sea city was one of them. It had the army of ocean cultivators of the East Sea, which guarded a region.

The city Lord and the commander of the Army of ocean cultivators were both terrifying experts at the profound void realm.

In Eastern Sea city, there were three major academies: Eastern Sea Academy, Ocean Academy, and Demon Hunter Academy.

Compared to the first two academies, Demon Hunter Academy could be considered a civilian academy.

This was because as long as one had the strength and ability, they wouldn’t allow their sons and daughters to join the Demon Hunter Academy.

The greatest future for the students of the Demon Hunter Academy was to stay in the Demon Hunter Academy and become instructors. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The rest would usually join a mercenary group. If it was better, they would form a mercenary group.

However, the members of the mercenary group lived on the edge of a knife and could die in the wild at any time.

As the saying went, “If you often walk by the river, you will get your shoes wet. If you often do missions in the wild, who can guarantee that you will not encounter difficulties?”?

Therefore, no parents were willing to let their children go to the Demon Hunter College.

Moreover, the students of the Demon Hunters Academy had to go out on missions during their time in the academy.

Every assessment required them to go out into the wild to complete the corresponding missions.

The probability of death in the academy was very high. It could be seen from the assessment.

This was also the origin of the name of the academy for Commoners.

To enter Donghai City, everyone had to pay a middle-grade spirit stone. This was a hard and fast rule.

Wang Xian and the rest entered the city from the entrance that was at least 200 meters wide. They passed through the tunnel that was 20 to 30 meters thick.

A huge and prosperous city appeared in Wang Xian’s line of sight.

The wide street was about 30 to 40 meters wide. The street was divided into human-shaped and horse-drawn carriages.

“Move, move, move!”

At this moment, a roar came from behind.

Wang Xian turned around and saw more than a dozen members of the mercenary group riding on giant rhinoceroses. They were walking on the road of the carriage.

The three-meter rhinoceroses were emitting a powerful aura.

These rhinoceroses had at least the strength of an extraordinary level three.

This made Wang Xian’s eyes sparkle.

“It’s up to brother Bei Bing to hunt the red-tailed fish this time!”

“Don’t worry, leave it to me. As long as you do as I say, I guarantee that we will return with a full load!”

More than 20 people walked out of the city excitedly. Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with astonishment.

The one who was called the bei Bing Brothers was not a human. Instead, it was a demonic beast that carried a shell on its back and had two antennae.

That’s right, it was a demonic beast. It cooperated with humans to hunt and kill the ferocious beasts!

Along the way, Wang Xian also learned a little about Donghai town from Jin Liuyan and Zhou Han.

This was a huge city. There were not only fierce beasts but also demonic beasts living in it.

Demonic Beasts possessed intelligence. Not all demonic beasts were enemies with humans.

Many demonic beasts joined forces with humans.

After demonic beasts registered in a human city, they enjoyed the same treatment as humans.

They also had to abide by the rules of humans.

And because demonic beasts had their own talents and were generally stronger than humans, many mercenary groups also hoped to recruit a demonic beast member.

This resulted in a situation where the demonic beasts and humans coexisted.

In fact, there was even a small demonic beast race living in Donghai City.

The humans provided them with safe accommodation and resources while they guarded Donghai city for the humans to solve some special problems.

“Commander Wang, I’ll sell all the resources first. I’ll let Han Han and Miss Jin bring you around Donghai City!”

Father Zhou said to Wang Xian with a smile.

As for everyone in the caravan, they left as soon as they entered the city.

“It’s alright. I’ll look around by myself!”

Wang Xian shook his head.

“It’s Alright, Commander Wang. We don’t have much to do. Donghai city is very big. Do you know where the Demon Hunter Academy is? Where is the demon hunter recruitment? “Let us accompany you to get to know each other. Thank you for bringing us here safely!”

Jin Liuyan said to Wang Xian with a smile on her face.

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment and nodded. “Alright then, thank you!”

“You’re welcome. We still want to get to know a powerhouse with unlimited potential like you so that we can protect our little girl in the future!”

Jin Liuyan’s face was full of smiles.
