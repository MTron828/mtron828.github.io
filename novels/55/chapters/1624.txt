Chapter 1625: 1625, on the expedition to the flowing sea region

“All Disciples of our sect, listen up. Follow me to the expedition to the flowing sea region and destroy the Dragon and Phoenix Empire. Leave No one alive!”

In the ruins of the divine kingdom, a voice filled with killing intent suddenly resounded throughout the entire sky. The entire divine kingdom ruins, which spanned thousands of kilometers, could be heard clearly.

“This is the voice of the supreme sect leader. What is our sect trying to do?”

In an instant, everyone in the ruins of the divine kingdom was slightly stunned. Their faces were filled with astonishment.

Everyone looked towards the direction of the Wuji Empire in unison.

“Disciples’orders!”

At this moment, in the east, the disciples of the only sect flew directly into the sky.

Everyone in the ruins of the divine kingdom hurriedly turned around, their faces filled with shock.

All the disciples of the Solitaire sect had come. There were more than 20,000 elite disciples, each of them exuding a terrifying murderous aura.

Especially at the front, there were more than 2,000 insightful void realm experts.

After eight months of battle, these experts represented the entire strength of the Solitaire sect.

“All the disciples of the southern royal family are psychic. Follow me to the flowing sea region and destroy the Dragon and Phoenix Empire. Let them know that if these small flowing sea regions dare to provoke us, the result will be their own destruction!”

Just as everyone in the god country ruins was shocked by the solipsistic sect, the southern royal family’s Nangong Jianghe’s voice sounded.

His voice was also filled with rage and fury.

“We will obey the Patriarch’s orders!”

Experts from the southern royal family in the god country ruins flew into the sky.

More than 20,000 experts and disciples responded loudly.

“The only sect, the southern royal family, do they still have...”

In the ruins of the divine kingdom, looking at the two terrifying armies from the east and west, shock appeared on their faces.

They muttered and suddenly had a guess in their hearts.

“Eight months ago, the leader of the Flowing Sea region, the dragon and Phoenix Empire, came to our vast region and started a war. In eight months, the entire vast region was plunged into misery and blood flowed like a river.”

“Today, our Wuji Empire has decided to make the blood-stained dragon and Phoenix Empire pay with blood

“Not long ago, the dragon and Phoenix Empire fled to the flowing sea region after hearing that our Wuji Empire had interfered in the chaos in the vast area

“They committed crimes in our vast area and plundered countless resources. Now, they want to run away. Do they really think that our vast area is easy to bully

“Today, our Wuji Empire, together with the solipsistic sect and the southern royal family, has decided to send troops to the sea of flowing waters region to destroy the dragon-phoenix Empire in order to prevent them from making a comeback!”

Very quickly, the doubts and guesses in everyone’s hearts were solved.

The Wuji Empire’s king directly floated in the sky, and his voice of justice and vastness spread throughout the entire divine kingdom ruins.

Everyone was shocked!

A few days ago, ever since the Wuji Empire’s imperial court had announced that the Wuji Empire’s King was dissatisfied with the war in the vast region and condemned the dragon-phoenix Empire, everyone had a premonition.

Now, it had finally come true.

“Boom Boom!”

“Boom Boom!”

At this moment, from the east and west, everyone from the Solitaire sect and the southern royal family flew towards the sky above the Wuji Empire.

“Oh my God! Look! That is the Supreme Guardian group of the Solitaire sect. There are seven experts at the eighth level of the profound void tier, and all the experts behind them are riding on the Skylark!”

“That is the battle group of the howling sky-patterned wolves of the southern royal family. All of the one hundred howling sky-patterned wolves are at the fifth level of the profound void tier, and all of them are riding on experts above the fifth level of the profound void tier!”

“At the back, even if they are not experts at the profound void tier, they are still the best battle group in our vast area. The unrivaled battle group!”

“The Wuji Empire’s strength is the strongest. The Shadow Lion, the Wuji Empire’s strongest subsidiary race, the Shadow Lion Demon Beast Race, over a Thousand Shadow Lions. It’s simply too domineering!”

Everyone in the Divine Kingdom’s ruins had their eyes on the three large factions in the vast region.

They raised their heads and looked up, their hearts filled with shock.

This could be said to be the strongest power in their vast region. Even the weakest was at transcendent level 9.

Just by floating in the sky, they gave off an immense pressure.

Normally, any faction would be able to cause the vast region to tremble three times. Now that the three major factions had joined forces, one could only imagine how terrifying it was!

It was so terrifying!

“We will march into the vast region. Ten days later, we will return triumphantly!”

A strong confidence and righteous voice rang out as figures flew towards the front of the Wuji Empire’s army.

Out of the three teams, the most powerful was the Wuji Empire’s army.

There were close to fifty thousand experts, which was about twice as many as the soliloquy sect and the southern royal family.

During these eight months, the neutral Wuji Empire did not suffer any losses. On the contrary, their strength had increased by a lot.

Right now, the strength of the Wuji Empire was only a little weaker than the combined strength of the unitary sect and the southern royal family.

The Wuji Empire had truly become the strongest super force.

“All the forces that are following us in the battle, follow US immediately!”

The supreme sect master’s figure instantly appeared in front of the unitary sect as he coldly shouted.

“In the vast region, all the forces that are second rate and above, follow us in the battle!”

The Patriarch of the southern royal family also shouted.

“Haha, the School of Life and death elixirs and the school of holy item forging will go to war together. Let’s watch some reckless people die!”

“The Green Wolf sect is ready to go to war!”

“The Green Mountain sect is willing to go to war for the vast area of 100,000 kilometers!”

...

The sects, sects, and dynasties that had long learned about the battle immediately flew over with all the swordsmen.

They arrived behind the three superpowers, and there wasn’t the slightest bit of surprise in their eyes.

They had already received news of the three superpowers joining forces to destroy the dragon-phoenix Empire in the past two days, and they had long since made preparations.

The only surprise was that they had originally planned to head to the dragon-phoenix Empire and directly destroy it, changing it to the area of the flowing sea.

However, this didn’t have much of an impact on them.

With the Alliance of the three superpowers and the strength of almost all the experts in the vast region, wouldn’t it be an easy task to destroy the flowing sea region?

If they couldn’t even defeat the flowing sea region, then it would be a waste for them to be one of the ten great regions of the vast region.

One had to know that the area of their vast region and the number of experts were more than ten times that of the vast region.

“All forces, follow us!”

The Wuji Nation Master’s gaze swept across everyone behind him, and a trace of strong confidence appeared on his face.

There were about 120,000 people, with the lowest being at the rank 9 transcendence realm, the void interpretation realm, and the demonic beasts. There were more than 10,000 of them.

In the entire vast region, 90% of the void interpretation realm experts had gathered.

“Let’s Go!”

The Supreme Headmaster’s face revealed a trace of savage excitement as he roared.

“Yes!”

“Roar Roar!”

Everyone immediately responded.

The demonic beasts, feeling the intense battle intent, let out roars. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The 120,000 strong army quickly flew towards the flowing sea region.

With their speed, they would be able to arrive in five days.

According to the Wuji dynasty, they would return triumphantly in ten days. This was because they didn’t put the flowing sea region in their eyes at all.
