Translator: 549690339

“Aren’t you being a little too arrogant?”

Wang Xian’s statement that he wanted to take Wu Qitian’s life caused the faces of the experts from Mingyi Saint Academy to Darken.

The mage who was the leader of the group, who was at the peak of the Universe Knight Realm, stared at Wang Xian and said coldly!

“I’ll give you three seconds to consider. ”

Wang Xian’s gaze landed on the mage as he continued to speak calmly!

“Hmph, I want to see who is so arrogant to dare to cause trouble and kill people in our Ming Yi Saint Academy. I want to see who dares to come to our Ming Yi Saint Academy and kill my son, Wu Zhihong. ”

As soon as Wang Xian finished his sentence, an extremely cold voice came from the sky before the spellcaster could reply.

Following that, a figure appeared and stared at Wang Xian with killing intent.

It was a middle-aged man. His body was filled with surging space energy.

Wang Xian looked at him with his eyes gleaming.

The middle-aged man stared at Wang Xian with a strong killing intent.

Wu Zhihong was the strongest spatial swordsman in the Ming Yi Saint Academy and an expert at the peak of the Universe Knight Realm.

As he was a spatial cultivator, he was almost invincible in terms of his combat strength and ability to escape.

Even an existence at the master level one or two would find it difficult to kill him.

“Then I’ll Kill You First! ”

Wang Xian’s face turned cold when he saw that Wu Qitian’s father had arrived.

He waved his arm and a nine-colored sharp sword condensed and locked onto Wu Zhihong.

After the nine-colored sharp sword was condensed, it arrived in front of Wu Zhihong in an instant.

From the moment Wang Xian made his move to the moment when the sharp sword arrived in front of him, it was only an instant.

Wu Zhihong didn’t even have the time to react.

In the surrounding area, the experts from the Ming Yi Saint Academy didn’t even have the time to react.

The sharp sword pierced through Wu Zhihong’s body in an instant. The terrifying destructive power caused him to widen his eyes and was filled with astonishment. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“What?”

When the sharp sword pierced through Wu Zhi Hong, the surrounding great beings from Ming Yi Sacred Academy finally reacted.

They looked over, their pupils slightly constricted, and their faces revealed a look of shock.

Wu Zhi Hong didn’t even have time to react before he was killed?

How was this possible?

One had to know that Wu Zhi Hong was an invincible existence below the ruler realm in their Ming Yi Sacred Academy.

A Pinnacle Universe Knight with space attributes was instantly killed, and he didn’t even have time to react.

Then, what realm was this mysterious young man at?

However, at this moment, Wu Zhi Hong’s body suddenly shattered like glass.

His figure appeared beside him.

At this moment, his face was extremely pale. His face was filled with horror.

He stared at Wang Xian in horror. His forehead was filled with cold sweat!

Wang Xian was still staring at him quietly. His face was filled with indifference.

At this moment, the nine-colored sharp sword did not disappear. It was still floating there.

The moment Wu Zhihong’s body reappeared, the sharp sword continued to attack.

“Damn it, how is this possible?”

“What level are you at exactly?”

Wu Zhihong saw the sharp sword attacking him again and shouted in horror.

Buzz

This time, he reacted and disappeared in an instant!

However, the sharp sword was still chasing after him.

Whoosh

Two seconds later, the sharp sword flew over with a corpse.

The corpse was none other than Wu Zhihong.

Wang Xian’s sharp sword carried the power of wind and thunder to lock down enemies.

This came from the incipient saint wings.

When Wang Xian’s incipient saint wings were completely fused, an image of an inheritance appeared.

In the image, an extremely powerful bird-like creature expert was killing a spatial expert from the royal family of the Void Universe.

The powerful power of wind and thunder to lock down enemies was able to track down and kill many spatial-attributed experts.

Now, Wang Xian also possessed this ability.

He could also easily hunt down and kill space-attributed powerhouses.

“Hiss, this… this…”

However, when all the surrounding experts from the Songyi Sacred Academy saw this scene, they revealed shocked expressions.

Wu Zhihong was the strongest space-attributed cultivator in the songyi sacred academy.

He was an existence at the peak of the Universe Knight Realm.

His strength was not the strongest in their Songyi Sacred Academy, and he had yet to reach the ruler realm.

However, due to his spatial attribute, even the ruler of their Songyi Sacred Academy would find it difficult to kill him.

However, Wu Zhihong was actually killed so easily.

The other party had only used one move and used his energy to form a sharp sword to kill him.

How terrifying was his strength?

Everyone took a deep breath and looked at Wang Xian with respect.

“Senior, Wu Qitian has offended you. We will give you an explanation.”

The leader of the group, an expert at the peak of the Universe Knight Realm, quickly spoke to Wang Xian.

At the same time, they also urgently transmitted some information about Wang Xian to the dean.

Now, they were 100% sure that Wang Xian was an existence at the level of a universe overlord.

Furthermore, he wasn’t an ordinary universe overlord.

This strength was enough to clash with the Ming Yi Saint Academy. In fact, they might not even be a match for him.

Against such an expert, it wasn’t something that they could decide.

This still needed the dean and the rest to handle personally.

Buzz Buzz

As soon as the leader of the Top-notch Universe Knights finished his sentence, he sensed Wu Zhihong’s death. The three masters of the universe of the Ming Yi Sacred Academy who had received the message flew over.

Their figures appeared in the sky. They looked at Wang Xian from afar and frowned as they sensed him.

“The dean and the rest are here! ”

“Greetings, Dean!”

The surrounding experts sensed something and immediately bowed respectfully to the three elders.

“My Friend, can’t this matter be settled peacefully?”

One of the dean of the Ming Yi Saint Academy looked at Wang Xian and spoke with a frown.

Wu Hongtian’s death and Wang Xian’s aura made the three deans immediately conclude that Wang Xian was not simple.

Therefore, they didn’t dare to offend him rashly.

“You guys can try to stop him. However, this price will cost you your lives. ”

Wang Xian looked at them and spoke calmly.

His words made the three principals’faces turn ugly.

Wang Xian was too strong.

However, Wang Xian’s strength made them fearful.

To be able to kill Wu Zhihong in an instant, his strength was definitely not weaker than theirs.

Such an enemy would either be able to leave him here completely or not offend him.

Otherwise, the outcome of the Ming Yi Saint Academy would be very miserable.

“Phew, alright. Wu Qitian has been unfaithful to this friend. The strong should not be humiliated. He is up to you to deal with! ”

The three principals looked at each other with sullen faces and said helplessly..
