Chapter 836: Empress 0837 had returned

Translator: 549690339

“Then what should we do? If sister Feng Luan’s blood essence and energy are insufficient, she can’t reconstruct her body at all. Why don’t we let her enter my body again?”

Guan Shuqing asked anxiously.

In the past few months, Feng Luan and she had shared the same body. The two of them were able to communicate with each other. At the beginning, Feng Luan was extremely cold and arrogant.

But as time passed, the two of them gradually began to talk.

Feng Luan taught Guan Shuqing many things. She even imprinted her own cultivation method, artifact refinement, and pill refinement techniques into her mind.

The Empress didn’t know how long she had been asleep. Although the two of them occupied the same body, it didn’t prevent them from talking and communicating.

In the past month, they could even share the same perspective.

It was also because of Feng Luan that Guan Shuqing was able to reach the realm of a superior immortal.

The relationship between the two of them had far surpassed that of friends.

“Phoenix Nirvana requires blood essence. What else do you need?”

Wang Xian frowned as he stared at Feng Luan in the Dragon Pool and asked.

Buzz

Lan Qingyue waved her arm and a faint gray energy entered Feng Luan’s body. Suddenly, the area of her head burst into flames.

“Other than the blood essence, she also needs flames. As long as she has enough flames, she will be able to achieve Nirvana successfully!”

Lan Qingyue said immediately.

“Flames?”

Wang Xian opened his mouth and the Dragon Pearl came directly to the top of Feng Luan’s head. Streams of flame liquid flowed directly into her head.

As expected, under the enhancement of the Dragon Pearl’s flames, Feng Luan’s body was rapidly condensing.

Guan Shuqing saw that it was effective. She waved her arm, and similarly dense and terrifying flames turned into flame water, slowly landing above her head.

Terrifying Flames poured out, and Feng Luan began to condense below her head.

Her neck, arm, and chest.

She floated above the dragon pool. Above her head was powerful flames, and below her was dragon blood, slowly gathering.

“The position of the heart is not weaker than the human head. If I want to reconstruct it, the energy required may be extremely terrifying!”

When she was condensing her chest, her speed slowed down again. Even with the help of Wang Xian and the rest’s powerful flames, it was still very slow.

The drop of Vermilion Bird Essence Blood even started to flicker.

“What should we do?”

Guan Shuqing looked worried. The success rate of 50% was not high to begin with, and the probability of failure was already 50% .

If they failed, they would really be annihilated this time!

“Don’t worry, I have another idea!”

Wang Xian stroked Guan Shuqing’s head and moved to the Dragon Throne of the Dragon King Palace. He looked at the endless wood on the ancestral tree.

When he obtained the endless wood, it was only the size of a chopstick.

Now, it was two meters long and as thick as a child’s arm.

Wang Xian broke half of it and flew to the sky above Feng Luan again.

He threw the endless wood at Feng Luan’s chest.

Buzz

The Endless Wood entered her chest directly. Following that, half of the endless wood lit up on her chest like a blood vessel.

Her heart began to beat slowly.

“We did it!”

The girls were pleasantly surprised.

The Endless Wood belonged to the divine wood, even if it was several levels higher than a transcendent item.

This kind of wood was originally a dead wood. It could only be revived because of the ancestral tree and regain its previous terrifying power.

Even though it was only a twig, it was still extremely powerful.

The Endless Wood entered her body as though it had turned into blood vessels. It slowly connected her head and limbs.

The speed of her lower body was increasing. It was condensing at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Wang Xian revealed a smile as he sized up the empress who had reconstructed her body.

There were no clothes on her body at all.

Perfect, it was simply too perfect! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Boom

At this moment, a powerful pressure was emitted from Feng Luan’s body. A Vermillion Bird Phantom appeared around her and flew around her body.

A pair of bright eyes opened, and there was a vermillion bird jumping in them.

A majestic aura spread out in all directions.

“What a powerful aura!”

Even though Feng Luan only had the strength of a high-level immortal, she still had the urge to make people kneel down and worship her.

She was like an ancient emperor, patrolling the world.

People could not help but laugh as they knelt on the ground.

The Flames in Feng Luan’s eyes gradually receded and the aura on her body disappeared. However, her outstanding temperament was still incomparably noble.

Her fiery red long hair fluttered behind her and her entire body was as white as snow.

“Thank you!”

She looked at Wang Xian and thanked him.

“No Need!”

Wang Xian felt that he couldn’t take his eyes off her. He nodded his head in a daze.

“Pervert!”

Guan Shuqing, who was at the side, twisted Wang Xian and shouted loudly.

All the girls looked over and realized that Wang Xian was staring at Feng Luan’s body with glowing eyes.

Feng Luan was stunned for a moment. She couldn’t react at all. When she lowered her head to look at her body, her face was flushed red.

Even her entire neck had turned pink.

She looked extremely attractive.

Her body moved and flames covered her body. A vermillion bird-shaped armor covered her entire body.

The fiery red armor and fiery red hair made her look like a female god of war in an instant.

This made Wang Xian’s eyes light up again.

“HMPH!”

Lan Qingyue and the rest snorted in dissatisfaction as they stared at Wang Xian coldly.

“Ahem, as long as it works!”

Feng Luan took a glance at Wang Xian as her eyelashes fluttered non-stop.

This reminded her of what had happened during this period of time. Although it was not her body, there was no difference between it and her own body.

“HMM!”

She took a deep breath and shielded herself from those thoughts.

When she thought of the Empress of the extraordinary mainland, who commanded billions of lives, men were no different from women in her eyes.

No man dared to pursue her.

Those who could stand with her were old men who had lived for five or six thousand years, seven or eight thousand years.

Other than these old monsters, the other men could only kneel in front of her and worship her.

“Sister Feng Luan!”

Guan Shuqing ran over happily.

Feng Luan smiled and stroked Guan Shuqing’s hair happily.

“Alright, everything has been completed. I’ll get someone to prepare some delicious food. Let’s Celebrate!”

Wang Xian said happily.

The upgrade of the Dragon Palace and the return of the Empress!

“Alright, let’s go. Let’s Celebrate!”

Guan Shuqing and the other girls said happily as they flew towards the Dragon King Palace.

Feng Luan didn’t fly in front. Instead, she came to Wang Xian’s side. After glancing at him, she immediately looked ahead. “I feel that my body has the brand of Your Dragon Palace!”

“It’s because your body is formed from the items in my Dragon Palace!”

Using dragon blood to form a body and endless wood to form a heart, Feng Luan’s body could be considered a member of the Dragon Palace. If she died, Wang Xian could revive her through the soul-returning wood!

Feng Luan looked around and said softly, “I’ll be leaving in a few days!”

“Leaving? Where to?”

Wang Xian asked in surprise.

“Back to the transcendence continent!”

Feng Luan replied.

“What? You found the way back?”

Wang Xian asked in surprise.

“In the past few days, I have investigated and found a way back. After opening it, I can return!”
