Translator: 549690339

Boom! Boom! Boom

Eight stars flew toward the Prince of the Fire Phoenix, Feng Yuntian.

These eight terrifying stars were enough to kill him!

Feng Yuntian also knew that he couldn’t escape today!

His face was full of anger and a trace of fear.

The strength of the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace had completely exceeded their expectations.

“Not good, our prince is going to be killed too!”

“How can the Dragon King be so strong? How can he be so strong?”

“Once our prince is killed, will it be our turn next? I don’t have any treasures that can revive me. I don’t want to die.”

“It’s over, everything is over! ”

At the same time, all the powerful disciples of the Phoenix and Angel clans in the starry city were shocked when they saw this scene.

Their prince was no match for the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.

Even the great guardian of the Angel clan had been killed!

“A peak-level ruler has been killed by the Dragon King. The one from the Phoenix clan will be killed soon. The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is really powerful. ”

The other powerful disciples of the nine-origin universe were also shocked when they saw this scene. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Who would have thought that today’s battle would end like this.

The two peak masters of the Phoenix clan and the Angel clan had come, but the Dragon King had left them here.

The Dragon King’s strength had exceeded everyone’s expectations.

“Chirp, chirp, Chirp! ”

In front of them, the Prince of the Fire Phoenix, Feng Yuntian, let out a ferocious roar.

Facing the eight stars, he resisted desperately.

However, the eight stars soon covered them.

They didn’t know the exact situation.

However, everyone could sense that the prince of the Fire Phoenix’s aura was getting weaker and weaker until it completely disappeared in the end.

“They’re dead, they’re all dead!”

Seeing this scene, the experts of the peak-level races murmured.

Two peak-level rulers had fallen!

This could be said to be the first and second peak ruler realm experts to die in the past 20 billion years after the last calamity.

This kind of expert could already be said to be one of the most supreme experts in the nine origin universe!

But today, they all died at the hands of the Dragon King.

The strength of the Dragon King and the strength of the Dragon Palace made all the peak races realize that they couldn’t afford to offend them!

The Dragon Palace was not weak.

If the other peak races wanted to provoke the Dragon Palace, they would have to consider it carefully.

Whoosh! Whoosh

Wang Xian killed the two masters at the peak of the ruler realm. A faint smile appeared on his face.

He waved his arm and kept the two corpses. Then, his gaze flew toward the starry city.

“Do you want to come here and die, or do you want us to come and kill you?”

Wang Xian spoke to all the strong disciples of the Phoenix and Angel races in the starry city.

In the starry city, the number of strong disciples of the two peak races had reached 500,000 to 600,000.

Among them, there were about 60,000 masters.

This was the core strength of the two peak races. It was the strong foundation of the two races.

Once they were eliminated, the two peak races would be severely injured in terms of their masters and disciples.

“Our Angel Race has the Heaven’s destiny. If you dare to kill us, the Emperor of Our Angel race will not let you off, Dragon King.”

An Archangel who was in the seventh level of the angel race roared with a ferocious face!

“Oh? Hehe!”

Wang Xian laughed coldly when he heard that. With a wave of his arm, the five elements Millstone flew out of his body.

“I have said that I will make your Phoenix race and Angel race bleed like a

river. I will not spare a single one. I will do as I said. Disciples of the Dragon Palace, attack and kill! Leave No one alive! ”

He stared at the strong disciples of the Phoenix race and Angel race with a cold and murderous look!

The five elements millstone flew directly into the giant starry city.

The array formation and other defensive systems weren’t activated in the Giant Starry City!

The powerful disciples around the Angel clan and the Phoenix clan immediately moved away from them!

“Kill! Kill all the powerful disciples of the Phoenix clan and the Angel Clan!”

The group of experts from the Dragon Palace let out a low roar and flew directly towards the starry city!

With more than 170 succubus dragon species who were at the level seven of the ruler realm as the leader.

This force was enough to completely destroy them.

Furthermore, Wang Xian had also used the five elements millstone to kill the existences who were at the level seven of the ruler realm.

The five elements millstone was very fast and flew into the starry city in an instant.

One by one, terrifying weapons were launched at the level seven masters of the Phoenix and the Angels.

“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, our two races will definitely not let you off. Definitely! ”

At this moment, when the powerful disciples of the Phoenix clan and the Angel clan saw the attack of the Five Elements Millstone, they roared with despair on their faces!

They had completely given up the will to fight back.

In front of the terrifying Dragon King, even their two peak races ‘peak overlords couldn’t escape, let alone them!

How could they escape?

How could they escape?

They weren’t on the same level.

“Boom Boom Boom! ”

The Five Elements Millstone took the lead to destroy a group of seventh level overlords.

The screams of peak overlords kept ringing out.

There were 50-60 peak-stage sovereign realm experts of the two races!

One by one, the peak-stage sovereign realm experts died.

The experts of the Dragon Palace also flew over.

Their eyes locked onto the other angels and Phoenixes.

The slaughter began!

“Let’s fight them to the death!”

“Ahhhh, I don’t want to die. I don’t have any treasures to resurrect. I don’t want to Die! ”

Some people desperately wanted to fight for their lives.

Some people started to collapse in despair.

In the surrounding area, tens of billions of strong disciples of the 9-origin universe were watching.

The experts of the peak races and the disciples of the high-level races were watching in shock.

No one dared to help, even if some experts were on good terms with the strong disciples of the Phoenix Angel Race.

But at this time, no powerhouse disciple dared to stand out.

Because this was a race war.

Moreover, this war was initiated by the Phoenix clan, and the Angel clan took the initiative to participate in it!

But they underestimated the Dragon Palace.

Underestimated the Dragon King!

The powerhouses disciples of the Angel clan and the Phoenix clan fell quickly one by one.

Blood flowed on the ground.

The Phoenix’s corpse lay in the giant city.

The angels corpse lay on the cold ground.

The Phoenix fell, the angel fell!

The charming dragon seed of the Dragon Palace also made all the powerful disciples of the 9-origin universe witness their terrifying strength!

A massacre, a one-sided massacre!

The Dragon Palace didn’t let go of any of the disciples of the Phoenix race and the angel race.

No matter if they were at the ruler level or below.

Not a single one was spared!

Provoking the dragon palace and killing the disciples of the Dragon Palace would have a price to pay!
