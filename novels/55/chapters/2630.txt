2631 2631 legend of the Dragon Palace

The Northern line of the Demon Island welcomed a rare half-month of peace!

However, the half-month of peace didn’t make the experts relax!

Many treasures appeared at last month’s Conference!

At the conference, the experts from other forces recognized the master of the Frost Goddess!

Everyone was surprised that the frost goddess was so protective!

After all, the frost goddess didn’t care about the face of the last moon sect and questioned the elders!

However, it was a good thing that the last moon sect was in the wrong and lowered their heads! Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The Master of the Frost Goddess, the Southern Star Dragon Palace Dragon King had also entered the sights of some powers!

When all the powers learned that the Dragon Palace Dragon King had led a group of warriors and used a powerful war machine to kill an undying level 8 abyssal seed, they were all shocked!

The strength of the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace and the rest was not as weak as they had imagined!

Half a month had passed, and Wang Xian had been staying in the Dragon Peak!

The powerhouses of the Dragon Palace were also in the Dragon Peak, waiting for the next war to break out!

“I guess the war is going to break out soon!”

On the Dragon Peak, Wang Xian stood on the command platform and looked at the situation in the Abyss as he muttered to himself!

“It’s going to happen soon. In the past few days, many abyss seeds have gathered here again. Furthermore, these abyss seeds are getting stronger and stronger!”

From the side, Tian Cheng stared into the Abyss and said!

“I feel that there’s a powerful existence behind these abyss seeds who is commanding them!”

Wang Xian frowned slightly!

Why didn’t all the abyss seeds rush over in one go when they were coming in batches?

If that was the case, the forces on the northern front might not be able to withstand it!

“It’s a little strange. These abyssal seeds seem to be doing this on purpose, cultivating powerful abyssal seeds!”

Tian Chen nodded slightly!

“The abyssal seeds here are getting stronger and stronger. Last time, the weakest was an eternal lord rank 1, and now, the weakest is no lower than an eternal lord rank 3!”

He continued!

The speed of the abyss seeds breaking through was extremely fast, devouring humans and their own kind, they could quickly evolve!

The battle between humans and the abyss seeds, all in all, the abyss seeds were getting stronger. Even though the humans were getting stronger too, their speed was many times slower!

If they really maintained the battle for over a decade, if there was an endless stream of abyss seeds, the weakest of the abyss seeds would probably be at the undying emperor level by then!

“I heard that on the central island of the Imperial Star Field, there are also strange movements in the Abyss over at the imperial court. I wonder if it’s true or not!”

Wang Xian muttered to himself as he recalled the information he had read on the AI over the past few days!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

At this moment, roars came from the abyss in front of him!

“Another group of Abyss seeds are coming. The war is about to break out!”

Wang Xian looked over and saw countless abyss seeds flying over from the depths of the Abyss!

The leader of the group could vaguely feel their majestic might!

“All the members of the Dragon Palace, Get Ready!”

He shouted softly!

“All the disciples of the Bei Chuan Sect, get ready to fight!”

Just as Wang Xian finished his sentence, a voice came from the Bei Chuan sect beside him!

The battle had erupted once again!

“This time, let’s try to kill more powerful abyssal seeds!”

Wang Xian stood on the command platform and exuded a cold aura!

If he wanted to improve himself, he would need about ten level eight immortal King Abyss seeds!

If he could kill Ten Level Eight Immortal King Abyss seeds, the strength of the Dragon Palace would increase by another level!

“Let’s Go!”

With a light shout from the sky array, the entire Dragon Peak started to move!

The current Dragon Peak had a qualitative change compared to the previous war!

Last time, there were only 1,000 immortal king level powerhouses in the Dragon Peak, but this time, there were 5,000 of them!

Including him and the sky array, there were 4 immortal king level level 8 powerhouses!

Buzz

The dragon peak trembled slightly and arrived in front of Bei Chuan sect in an instant!

“Bei Shuang, come over here!”

Wang Xian looked to the side and shouted at bei Shuang!

This area was one of the two places where the Beichuan sect had suffered the most severe attacks from the abyssal seeds. The previous time, a Patriarch of the Beichuan sect was guarding the area!

...

This time, bei Shuang had swapped places with that patriarch and she was here to guard the area!

“It’s Master!”

Bei Shuang nodded and immediately flew towards the command platform!

An elder beside him looked but didn’t say anything!

With the help of Dragon Palace’s Dragon Mountain, it would be much easier!

“There are 2 undying level 8 abyss species in this area, 1,500 undying emperors!”

“Dragon Mountain, charge straight, all members, prepare to kill!”

Sky Array looked at the scan on the array and shouted!

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

Dragon Peak let out a roar and charged forward!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

...

Seven to eight million abyss species were also charging forward!

However, the abyss species were also a little confused. This was the first guy who dared to charge at them so arrogantly!

“The Dragon Palace is a bit fierce. With the help of the Dragon Peak War Machine, they charged directly into the abyss species!”

Behind them, the people of the Beichuan sect were slightly shocked!

“We will guard this side. Don’t charge forward!”

The Elders of the Beichuan sect had seen the strength of the Dragon Palace, so they reminded all the disciples!

“Roar!”

The huge dragon peak in front of them attracted the attention of a large number of abyss species. Instantly, a million abyss species pounced on the Dragon Peak!

“Attack!”

At this time, on the arrow platform, Mou Ze Sen ordered!

“Sou Sou Sou!”

In the next moment, countless densely packed arrows shot forward!

Mou Ze Sen drew his bow fully, his gaze locked onto an undying level 8 abyss species that was charging towards them!

“Ao Yao, Get Ready!”

He shouted softly, the arrow in his hand shot out!

“Howl Howl Howl!”

The arrow flew out, instantly turning into a 10m long golden dragon in mid air, green whirlpools formed around it!

The arrow left the arrow, instantly arriving in front of the Undying Level 8 abyss seed!

In the middle, it pierced through hundreds of abyss seeds without slowing down!

“Howl Howl!”

The Undying Level 8 abyss seed felt the threat from the arrow, roaring madly, its huge hammer like tail behind it shot towards the Arrow!

“Peng!”

A terrifying collision resounded, the aftershock of the energy caused many within a 100km radius to die and be heavily injured!

“Pu!”

At the instant of the collision, a black and White Shadow appeared behind the Undying Level 8 abyss seed, piercing through its body!

“Sou!”

On the arrow platform, Mu Ze Sen instantly shot another arrow, turning into a smooth arrow, landing on the Undying Level 8 abyss seed’s body!

“Howl Howl!”

A voice filled with endless fear came out of its mouth, its body heavily floating downwards!

An undying level 8 abyss seed, killed instantly!
