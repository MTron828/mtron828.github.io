Chapter 1575: Under the betrayal of the 1575 Iceheart dynasty

“Haha, we will naturally treat our friends well. However, if they are not friends...”

Ao Tian squinted his eyes and looked at Wang Xian when he heard Wu Qing Cheng’s words. He laughed and did not finish his sentence.

As the most outstanding son of the Supreme Leader of the only sect and the future supreme leader of the only sect.

Only a few people from the Wuji dynasty and the southern royal family could really catch his attention in the entire vast region.

He didn’t care about anyone else, even priest Wang, who was currently in the limelight in the vast region.

In the vast region, no matter how monstrous he was, he couldn’t defeat the solipsistic sect!

“Is it priest Wang?”

Ao Tian looked at Wang Xian and asked faintly in the end.

“I agree with what you said. Friends have wine and meat, enemies have swords!”

Wang Xian looked at ao Tian with a smile on his face.

“Ao Tian, the match is about to start. Don’t disturb us from watching the match!”

Wu Qing Cheng, who was at the side, sensed a hint of anger from Wang Xian and said to Ao Tian immediately.

“Good, good, good!”

Ao Tian stared at Wang Xian with a wicked smile on his lips. He looked at Wu Qing Cheng and flew straight ahead.

“Ao Tian is as arrogant as his name suggests. He doesn’t put anyone in his eyes!”

“In fact, everyone in our sect is unlikable. They act like I’m the best in the world!”

“Priest Wang, it’s best if you don’t get into a big conflict with them. As long as you don’t offend them completely, ao Tian won’t be able to do anything to you!”

Seeing ao Tian leave, Wu Qing Cheng reminded Wang Xian softly.

“Don’t worry, I won’t offend anyone if they don’t offend me!”

Wang Xian smiled at Wu Qing Cheng.

Ao Tian didn’t put him in his eyes. Naturally, he didn’t put ao Tian in his eyes either.

Unless someone was stronger than him, no one had the right to be arrogant with him. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“That priest Wang is indeed as arrogant as the rumors say!”

Ao Tian returned to his seat in the void. His gaze swept across Wang Xian as he spoke with a cold expression.

“He doesn’t even put senior brother in his eyes. This fellow...”

The two heaven’s pride experts in the sky and on the ground looked at him with murderous intent as they growled in a low voice.

“Alright, this fellow is very strong and has been conferred the title of the Saint of light by the Wuji Empire. We can’t do anything to him for the time being!”

Ao Tian glanced at the two of them with a cold expression as he looked towards the direction of the arena with an expressionless face.

Even if he was the most outstanding son of the Supreme Leader of the only sect, it was impossible for him to mobilize a level eight Seethrough void martial artist to kill a level seven Seethrough void martial artist.

Unless the other party harmed the only sect or killed the disciples of the only sect.

When the two heaven’s favorites saw ao Tian’s cold expression, they quickly shut up and sat there with a gloomy face.

When ao Tian came to talk to Wang Xian and the rest, the competition on the arena had already begun.

Twenty Arenas and forty people were fighting at the same time.

Wang Xian didn’t have much interest in watching the battles on the arena. A battle between cultivators below the void interpretation stage was no different from a battle between children.

However, what surprised Wang Xian was that the arena where the lone tyrant was fighting was much more bloody than some ordinary battles.

In the first round of the 40-man competition, five people were killed on the spot.

“If you find it boring, let’s go out for a walk. You can come back when I’m in the Arena!”

After watching for the entire morning, Ling Jian ‘er noticed that Wang Xian was not in the mood. She said to him with a smile on her face.

“Alright. By the way, we haven’t walked around the ruins of the Kingdom of God yet!”

Wang Xian nodded immediately and said with a smile.

“Oh? Priest Wang, do you guys want to go for a stroll? I’ll treat you guys to a meal then. You guys can have fun in the afternoon. I Won’t be a third wheel anymore!”

Wu Qing Cheng heard their conversation and said with a smile.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian looked at Ling Jian ‘er and nodded.

“Let’s Go!”

The three of them left the competition venue and flew towards the outside.

At the back, Bing Jinghuan clenched his fists tightly when he saw Ling Jian ‘er and Wang Xian leaving.

After Wang Xian and the rest left, Wu Qingcheng brought the two of them to the most famous restaurant in the ruins of the divine kingdom. The three of them had lunch together.

More than an hour later, Wang Xian and Ling Jian ‘er left alone.

Wu Qingcheng frowned and knocked on the table as he watched Wang Xian and Ling Jian ‘er leave.

“Uncle Jing, what do you think of this priest Wang?”

He asked curiously.

“Crown prince, it’s hard to say how many, but this young man is not afraid of anyone.”

Beside Wu Qing Cheng, a voice rang out.

“That’s right. This priest Wang is good in every way, but he doesn’t know how to fear. Forget it, as long as he doesn’t provoke the lone sect and the southern royal family, I will lend a hand when he is in danger in the future. It can be considered as repaying him for saving his life!”

Wu Qing Cheng shook his head and got up to leave.

After spending the afternoon with Ling Jian ‘er in some famous places in the ruins of the divine kingdom and sending him back to his residence, Wang Xian turned around and left.

“Priest Wang, right?”

At this moment, a figure suddenly appeared in front of Wang Xian, causing his pupils to constrict slightly.

It was an old man, a stooped old man. He was holding a black magic staff in his hand. He looked no different from an ordinary old man.

However, his sudden appearance in front of Wang Xian before Wang Xian could even sense him proved that this stooped old man was not simple.

“This old man, what’s the matter?”

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a hint of seriousness as he sized him up and asked.

“I heard that priest Wang is able to expel the soul of darkness, so I would like to ask for his help!”

The stooped old man stared at Wang Xian and said faintly.

“Expel the Soul of darkness? As long as there is sufficient reward, I will naturally do my best!”

Wang Xian looked at the old man and said with a smile.

“The reward is a little hard to come by now. After you are cured, I will compensate you!”

The old man said calmly.

“Compensate? Old Man, how can such a good thing happen!”

Wang Xian shook his head in amusement and walked straight ahead.

“Then I have no choice but to offend you!”

The hunchbacked old man shook his head and appeared beside Wang Xian in a flash.

His pair of skeletal claws clawed at Wang Xian’s shoulder.

“Pa!”

“Old Man, this is not how you seek medical treatment. Do you believe that I can immediately detonate the darkness soul in your body?”

A ferocious dragon claw grabbed onto the old man’s arm. The powerful force caused the old man’s arm to tremble slightly.

Wang Xian looked at the incredulous look on the old man’s face and said mockingly.

“You... you are not at level seven of the Void Interpretation Stage!”

The old man stared at Wang Xian with his turbid eyes.

“Get lost!”

Wang Xian shouted coldly. A white light flashed sharply on his pair of dragon claws.

In an instant, the old man’s expression changed drastically. His pupils revealed a look of horror.

“PFFT!”

The next moment, he couldn’t help but spit out a large mouthful of blood. His body started to tremble violently.
