Chapter 556: My Name Will Start To Spread (5)

“Great, great. Now that Qin Hai has reached the Half-Step to Dan Realm, our Mt. Wuyin can now compete with Mt. Jiuhua!”

At this moment, a middle-aged man within Mt. Wuyin faced the crowd of youths before him as he exclaimed.

“Master, rest assured. Give me ten days. In ten days, Brother Qin Shan and I will definitely challenge Mt. Jiuhua and raise our ranking to fourteenth.”

On the training field of Mt. Wuyin, a young man stood before thirty other disciples with his head lifted up proudly as he remarked confidently.

“Alright, Mt. Jiuhua has two Half-Step to Dan Realm disciples currently. Therefore, all our remaining disciples have to practice diligently and aim to achieve the breakthrough by the end of the year!” the middle-aged mentor said to his disciples with a smile.

“Yes, master!”

All thirty disciples were brimming with ambition. “We definitely should try to get into the top ten!”

“Disciples of Mt. Fengyu are here to challenge!”

At this moment, a shout could be heard.

Everyone in Mt. Wuyin was taken aback, including the middle-aged mentor.

He turned his head around, looked to his left and was shocked by what he saw.

Over a hundred. Over a hundred people were flying towards the training field of Mt. Wuyin on their swords.

“Mt. Fengyu? The eighteenth ranked Mt. Fengyu?” the middle-aged mentor frowned slightly and was clearly feeling something was dubious.

“Where are you guys from?” the middle-aged mentor looked across the crowd while shouting solemnly.

“Get down. Mentor Du of Mt. Wuyin is around!”

The disciples who were flying in the air landed on the ground immediately.

“Mentor Du, we are disciples from Mt. Fengyu!”

When Hua Yu landed on the ground, he lifted his head slightly and was brimming with confidence.

Under normal circumstances, a Mt. Fengyu disciple wouldn’t be as flamboyant as Hua Yu was when he was facing the disciples from Mt. Wuyin.

“We are here to challenge Mt. Wuyin!”

Huh?

Mentor Du raised an eyebrow.

“The eighteenth ranked Mt. Fengyu is challenging us, Mt. Wuyin? Are you guys crazy?”

Before Mentor Du could say a word, a disciple shouted at Hua Yu directly.

Mentor Du didn’t say a word as he looked suspiciously at the hundred-odd disciples.

Mt. Fengyu only had twenty-odd disciples.

“Senior brothers, we have just challenged Mt. Xuanshui, therefore...”

“Please guide us along!” said Hua Yu. Wang Xian stood by the side with his sword while staring at the disciples of Mt. Wuyin.

“This disciple of Mt. Fengyu is too strong. Relying on his personal strength alone, he has brought Mt. Fengyu from the eighteenth rank to challenging the fifteenth rank mountain sect!”

“He’s definitely at the Half-Step to Dan Realm. Moreover, he could be considered to be among the elites of the Half-Step to Dan Realm. His use of Illusory Swords and water clones is indeed terrifying!”

“I wonder if Qin Shan would be a match for him. If Qin Shan loses, Mt. Fengyu’s ranking will rise to fifteen!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Behind them, the disciples of Mt. Tianshui, Mt. Xuanshui and Mt. Sanshang were discussing softly.

“Half-Step to Dan Realm?”

The disciples of Mt. Wuyin were slightly surprised. They finally understood a little and their attention landed on Wang Xian.

“No wonder Mt. Fengyu is acting so arrogant. So they have a Half-Step to Dan Realm disciple!”

Qin Hai squinted his eyes slightly, stared at Wang Xian and gave an eerie smirk.

“Half-Step to Dan Realm?”

Mentor Du looked at Wang Xian and his lips curved up slightly. He didn’t say a word. He crossed his arms and simply stood by the side while watching the developments with a smile.

A Half-Step to Dan Realm disciple was dreaming of defeating his Mt. Wuyin! What a far-fetched dream!

“Are you the only one representing Mt. Fengyu?”

Qin Hai lifted his head slightly, stared at Wang Xian and asked this plainly.

“Send out five disciples from Mt. Wuyin and stop wasting my time!”

Wang Xian looked across the disciples of Mt. Wuyin and commented without emotions.

“Stop wasting your time? How arrogant. Today, no one else from Mt. Wuyin has to make a move. I can finish you off by myself!”

A flash of ruthlessness gleamed in Qin Hai’s eyes. He waved his longsword and ripples formed in the air.

“That’s Qin Hai from Mt. Wuyin, and in Mt. Wuyin, he’s only weaker than Qin Shan!”

“What does he mean? He knows clearly that this disciple from Mt. Fengyu is at the Half-Step to Dan Realm and yet he’s going to challenge him alone!”

“Could it be... Could it be... Qin Hai has completed the breakthrough?”

Seeing Qin Hai charging ahead alone, the surrounding disciples were astonished.

“Haha, how dare you challenge us, Mt. Wuyin, with just a single Half-Step to Dan Realm disciple. You guys are really courting your own demise. Initially, I was still thinking of only revealing my strength when we challenge Mt. Jiuhua. For today, you can be my testing stone!”

Qin Hai laughed confidently, shocking the surrounding disciples of Mt. Tianshui and Mt. Xuanshui.

“Qin Hai has made the breakthrough to Half-Step to Dan Realm!”

“Mt. Wuyin has two Half-Step to Dan Realm disciples now!”

“It’s over. The disciples of Mt. Fengyu will be beaten to their knees on Mt. Wuyin!”

When the surrounding disciples heard Qin Hai, they were astonished.

As for the crowd from Mt. Wuyin, they looked at the surrounding crowd with contempt and ridicule.

Before this group of disciples, there was still a young man standing by the side with his hands crossed while watching with a confident smile.

“Who would have thought that Mt. Wuyin would have two Half-Step to Dan Realm disciples now! It would seem that Mt. Fengyu’s progress will end here. That’s about the same as I expected.”

The young man carrying the petite girl chuckled and commented.

“That’s not a given yet. The disciple from Mt. Fengyu knocked out the disciples of Mt. Sanfeng instantly. Perhaps he could still win this!” the petite girl retorted the young man.

“Pfft! Xiao Yueyue, you don’t understand. A Half-Step to Dan Realm expert could easily win against seven to eight Inborn experts. Therefore, the instant knockout was still as expected. However, for those at the same level...” the young man spoke in an educating tone. Suddenly, his eyes widened...

“One down, four to go!”

Wang Xian’s emotionless voice stunned the surrounding crowd. Their jaws dropped and their eyes were filled with disbelief.

Wang Xian didn’t stop moving as he charged towards the group of disciples from Mt. Wuyin.

His eyes were fixed on Qin Shan who still had his arms crossed.

“His strength... Fight!”

Qin Shan’s eyelids twitched violently as he shouted bitterly and drew his longsword.

The other three disciples behind him drew their swords too immediately and charged towards Wang Xian.

Bam!

However, the group saw Qin Hai knocked to the ground heavily at this moment.

Qin Hai, instantly knocked out!

A Half-step to Dan Realm disciple couldn’t put up the slightest of resistance at the moment against Wang Xian.

The disciples of Mt. Tianshui, Mt. Xuanshui and others stared in disbelief.

“Could it be he has reached the Dan Realm?”

“It cannot be... Shit! A Dan Realm expert?”

Instantly knocking out a Half-step to Dan Realm expert... This insane level of strength...

“His attack hasn’t reached the level of a Dan Realm expert. He dominated completely with just swordsmanship. His control of water energy and general control are off the charts!”

On one end, Mentor Du’s eyes widened in disbelief. He let down his crossed arms gradually, eyes still remaining on Wang Xian.

“How can he be so insanely strong before reaching the Dan Realm?”

When the surrounding disciples heard Mentor Du, they couldn’t help but be impressed and shocked.
