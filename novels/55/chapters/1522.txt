Chapter 1523: 1,523 voices spread across thousands of miles 2

Wang Xian came to be a priest of light mainly to seek the balance between light and darkness.

To improve the tempering and control of the power of light, he needed to constantly use the power of light.

Treating patients could greatly improve his control of the power of light. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Especially when the patients were all invaded by darkness.

Speaking of which, he was considered a patient.

“From 8 am to 5 pm during the day, I will accept any patients. I will not accept any clients during the rest of the time!”

Wang Xian thought for a moment and spoke to Old Hu.

“Alright, I will inform the staff below who will receive the patients of the rules!”

Old Hu nodded.

“HMM, have a seat, Old Hu. Do you want some tea?”

Wang Xian sat on the balcony and took out a pot of tea. He warmed it up and made himself a cup.

“I’m not used to it. I’m not used to it. I’d better drink!”

Lao Hu took out the wine pot and shook his head. He smiled as he looked at the stream of people on the road.

There were humans and demonic beasts.

Wang Xian looked at them and took out the sculptures one by one.

“Wow, are these sculptures made by you, young man? They’re really beautiful. Are these beauties your lovers?”

Old Hu asked with a smile as he watched Wang Xian take out the sculptures and place them around him.

Wang Xian also smiled as he looked at the sculptures of Guan Shuqing and the other girls. None of them were made by Ling Jian ‘ER.

He didn’t touch anything related to Ling Jian ‘er until he had completely blended the light and darkness together.

The fourth floor was quickly tidied up. Wang Xian looked at the room he was staying in and was very satisfied.

When he closed the door, it was extremely quiet.

In the Holy Medicine Clinic, the news of a young priest at the insightful void level in their clinic was quickly transmitted to every staff member.

This made many priests in the clinic very excited.

In the clinic, 90% of them were female priests. Some of them were not too old!

When they learned that there was a young radiant priest at the insightful void level, all the girls were extremely tempted.

A person at the insightful void level could live a life of supremacy wherever he was placed.

To be able to marry an insightful void level powerhouse, he was basically marrying into a wealthy family.

It was very dark in the ruins of the Kingdom of God. It was so dark that there was no moonlight in the sky. Looking into the distance, it looked like an abyss.

The clinic was open 24 hours a day. However, Wang Xian would directly rest at night.

“I heard that when we were resting yesterday, a priest of light at the insightful emptiness realm came to the fourth floor. He was very young and a handsome man!”

“Wow, really? A young priest of insightful emptiness realm? How handsome is he?”

“I don’t know. I hope that when we are receiving patients today, we will have the chance to visit the fourth floor!”

Two girls who were receiving patients at the door were chatting in a low voice.

“Hurry up, hurry up. Let’s go to the clinic. The priest can definitely cure your arms. Absolutely!”

While the two girls were talking, three figures walked over in a hurry.

One was a woman, one was a girl, and the other was a middle-aged man. At this moment, the middle-aged man’s hands were hanging down. A faint black aura pervaded the air, and there was also a rotten smell.

The woman and the girl’s faces were filled with anxiety as they supported the bitter middle-aged man.

“The three of you, do you want to see a Doctor?”

A female receptionist asked them.

“Yes, yes, we want to see the radiant priest. We want to get rid of the black water poison!”

The woman’s face was filled with anxiety as she asked.

“Is it serious? Follow me, I’ll bring you to see the priest!”

The girl immediately said.

“Hiss, F * ck, this time it’s really bad luck. My arm was directly crippled. At least I need to find the priest of light at the void interpretation level to heal it!”

At this moment, four or five big men walked over. One of them directly said to a girl who was receiving them.

“The priest of the Void interpretation level?”

The girl who was receiving them looked at the four or five big men. Her eyes flickered slightly, and she immediately said, “Okay, okay, I’ll bring you there.”

“Oh? The smell of decay, it stinks!”

At this moment, a burly man suddenly sniffed the surroundings and looked at the middle-aged man and the two women.

“Black Water Poison? The entire arm was actually corroded. This is considered crippled. It can either be directly cut off and used as a medicinal pill to nourish and grow, or it can cause a powerful radiant priest to regrow the severed arm!”

A burly man said indifferently, following closely behind him.

“Regrow the severed arm?”

When the woman and girl heard these words, their faces slightly paled.

The radiant priest’s treatment was not cheap. In order to regrow the severed arm quickly, based on the injured person’s strength, they needed to buy at least half-step void interpretation level medicinal pills. This was not something that one or two medicinal pills could solve.

The stronger one was, the higher the level of the pills needed to regenerate the severed arm.

The cost was very high. As for the radiant priest’s severed arm, the price was about the same as this.

This was something that needed at least a void interpretation level 2 priest to perform.

Another type was using ordinary pills and cultivation to slowly recover. It could also regenerate the severed arm.

However, this required at least a few years of time.

From the looks of the three of them, they weren’t rich.

The middle-aged man’s strength was only at transcendent level 7.

“I’ll bring you guys to take a look first!”

The female receptionist said to them.

“Alright, Alright!”

The few of them nodded with sweat all over their faces.

“I’ll bring them to the fourth floor!”

The other female receptionist winked at the receptionist and led the few burly men to the fourth floor.

“Let’s Go!”

The receptionist behind puffed her lips and said to the three people beside her. Then, she led them inside as well.

“Pastor Wang, a patient is here!”

On the fourth floor, Wang Xian was sitting on the balcony drinking tea while looking at the bright sunlight. Lao Hu’s voice came from outside.

“He’s Here!”

With a patient here, Lao Hu couldn’t call Wang Xian a young man.

“HMM? A man? And such a young priest?”

Four to five burly men were astonished when they saw Wang Xian walking over from the balcony.

“The bones in his arm were crushed, right? Uncle Hu, how much is the fee according to the Holy Medicine Clinic?”

Wang Xian glanced at the burly man in the middle, looked at Old Hu, and asked.

“I showed him for a while just now. He recovered completely. If he doesn’t need to take any elixirs, 800,000 upper-grade spirit stones!”

Old Hu said directly.

800,000 high-grade spirit stones was not a small amount.

In the kingdom ruins, most people used high-grade spirit stones. One high-grade spirit stone was equivalent to 100 middle-grade spirit stones.

“800,000 high-grade spirit stones!”

Before the burly men could speak, a surprised voice came from behind them.

“Oh? Why are you all shouting?”

The few burly men looked behind them and realized that they were the three people they met at the door. They frowned and shouted.

“Be quiet. If you want to treat them, treat them. If not, leave!”

Wang Xian said to them calmly.

“Treat them. We have 800,000 upper-grade spirit stones!”

One of the burly men said directly.

“Okay.”

Wang Xian nodded his head and waved his arm. Rays of light landed on the arms of the burly man.
