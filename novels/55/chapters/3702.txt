3703 3702 angels and Phoenixes died

“Invincible City is rumored to be the final location of the war in the invincible region. There are a total of five to six Space Beasts’corpses there, and there are also seven to eight Cosmos God nation ruins. The energy there is chaotic, but to experts, it is a treasure ground for cultivation. Many experts from the invincible region gather there!”

Invincible city was a place where treasures were gathered in the invincible region!

There were seven to eight ruins of the divine kingdom and five to six corpses of space behemoths. The energy was extremely majestic!

There were quite a number of experts gathered there, but some of them came from various races!

Wu Sha wasn’t sure how many angels and Phoenix race experts there were!

However, there were definitely some there!

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly. With a move of his body, he flew rapidly towards invincible city!

His speed was very fast. In the land of the nine Netherworld fire, no powerhouse knew that more than 40 dark angels were killed!

A day later, Wang Xian arrived in front of invincible city.

It was more like a place where corpses and broken divine kingdoms gathered. The good thing was that it wasn’t too messy!

Wang Xian was at the front and could sense that there were quite a number of experts gathered in Invincible City!

There were at least seven to eight hundred of them!

There were even two experts engaged in a life-and-death battle at one of them!

“Surround the entire invincible city. I’ll enter!”

Wang Xian looked at Wu Sha and the rest and gave an order!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Wu Sha and the rest nodded their heads. The seven mad demons exchanged a glance and flew straight into the surroundings!

They wanted to surround the entire invincible city!

Meanwhile, Wang Xian flew straight into the city and scanned the surroundings!

The peak races all had the unique aura of the peak races, the light and darkness powers of the Angel Race!

The Phoenix powers of the Phoenix race!

With just a little sensing, he could lock onto the angels and the Phoenixes!

“This is? The Dragon King!”

“Yes, he is the Dragon King. What is the Dragon King doing here?”

Wang Xian entered and swept his gaze across the surroundings unscrupulously. When some of the experts saw him, their faces were filled with reverence as they asked in astonishment!

A few days ago, Wang Xian was truly invincible in the invincible zone. Now that all the old freaks had met the Dragon King, none of them were disrespectful!

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

When some of the old monsters saw Wang Xian, they even bowed respectfully!

Wang Xian took a glance and continued to observe his surroundings!

“Eh, Brother Black open-air, look over there. is that? The Dragon King?”

On a high platform located in invincible city, waves of energy surged from below!

Above them, more than ten old monsters were sitting cross-legged. In front of them, there was a chessboard!

Suddenly, an old monster noticed Wang Xian in the distance and exclaimed in surprise!

More than ten old monsters looked over, and their eyes were sparkling!

Among them, there was an angel of Darkness, an angel of light, and the rest were old monsters from other races!

They looked at Wang Xian, and Wang Xian had already sensed them!

When Wang Xian saw that there were two powerhouses from the angel race among them, a faint smile appeared on his face!

He flew over immediately!

“HMM? Then the Dragon King Is Here!”

“The Dragon King’s strength is unrivaled. We have to be more respectful!”

More than ten powerhouses sent a voice transmission when they saw Wang Xian flying over!

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

They immediately bowed respectfully when they saw Wang Xian flying over!

The current Wang Xian was more than capable of receiving their great greetings!

Wang Xian nodded his head lightly. With a wave of his arm, two chains instantly shot towards the angel of light and the Angel of darkness.

“What!”

When the two angels saw Wang Xian suddenly attacking them, their expressions changed drastically!

“Dragon King, why are you attacking us?”

They wanted to dodge, but Wang Xian was too fast. They couldn’t react in time!

“You two!”The Angel of darkness shouted with an extremely embarrassed and furious expression!

“It’s because you are disciples of the Angel clan. You deserve to die!”

Wang Xian heard his words and said calmly. A surge of energy from the chains surged into their bodies!

“Ah!”

The two angels let out miserable screams. Their bodies trembled violently. In the next moment, Wang Xian pulled them into the dragon palace and suppressed them!

It was only because they were disciples of the Angel Race!

This was a race war!

After suppressing the two angels, Wang Xian swept his gaze across the surroundings and continued flying forward!

“Hiss!”

At the side, more than ten other experts were trembling. The moment Wang Xian made his move, they felt death!

When they saw Wang Xian leaving, they took a deep breath!

“This… is this the Dragon King’s strength? Black Open Sky and the rest don’t even have the strength to resist!”

“The Dragon King is actually killing the powerhouses of the angel race. is he here to clean up the powerhouses of the Angel Race?”

“This… killing the powerhouses of the angel race without any restraint, only the Dragon King can do that, right?”

The dozen or so powerhouses looked at this scene in shock. There was a hint of cold sweat on their foreheads as they spoke!

“Over there, I can sense the aura of the Phoenix Tribe’s powerhouses!”

Wang Xian looked to the right and immediately flew over!

His gaze was fixed on a building. His eyes flickered slightly as he swung his arm!

A grayish dragon claw clawed directly at that building!

“Who is it?”

A voice rang out from within the building. Following that, a Golden Phoenix flew out from within. It was emitting a golden glow!

“I, the Dragon King, am here to kill you!”

Wang Xian looked at the Golden Phoenix and spoke indifferently!

The Dragon Claw clawed at him once again!

“Dragon King? I didn’t offend you. Why did you attack me? Why did you kill me?”

The Golden Phoenix clearly didn’t know what was happening in the trading ground. He roared with a face full of shock and anger!

He flapped his golden wings and streams of terrifying golden light shot towards the Dragon Claw!

However, his attacks didn’t affect the dragon claw at all. It continued to claw towards him at a terrifying speed!

“It’s because of you phoenixes. You deserve to die!”

Wang Xian heard his words and spoke calmly! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The Dragon Claw grabbed his body directly!

A surge of energy surged into his body and obliterated his life force!

“What?”

“A battle has broken out over there. It’s the Dragon King. The Dragon King is killing the powerhouses of the Phoenix Tribe!”

The commotion over here had attracted the attention of many old freaks in the surroundings!

They looked over and saw a golden phoenix being suppressed by Wang Xian. Upon hearing his words, a look of shock appeared on their faces!

Because of You Phoenixes, you deserve to die?

The Dragon King is killing the experts of the Phoenix clan!

“The Dragon King is taking revenge. He is taking revenge for the Phoenix clan and the Angel clan who besieged him!”

“This is too unbridled, too powerful, directly killing the Phoenix clan and the Angel clan’s experts!”

They looked over, their faces filled with shock!

One had to know that behind the other party was a peak race!
