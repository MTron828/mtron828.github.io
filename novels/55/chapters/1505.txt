Chapter 1506: 1506. If I become a demon, there will be no demon in the world. 1

Seek the demon!

Two words came out of his mouth. It was ordinary, not loud, and not violent.

There were only two ordinary words.

However, when he finished saying these two words, his entire body was completely enveloped in darkness.

A physical darkness.

However, no matter how dark it was, a pair of eyes that were as deep as the abyss was still exceptionally eye-catching.

“Hiss”

Around them, the He clan leader and the rest looked at the extremely strange Wang Xian in front of them and inhaled a breath of cold air.

The scene in front of them had completely overturned their understanding.

“Invite the patriarch over!”

When the He clan leader saw this strange scene, he felt his scalp go numb.

This was especially so when he said, “Bloom in the darkness and be eternal in the midst of slaughter.”.

His two sentences with Qiu Mo made him feel a little fearful.

“Yes!”

An expert at level six of the Seethrough realm hurriedly flew towards the height of the holy tree.

At this moment, Wang Xian continued to walk forward. With one step, he walked for a thousand meters.

“Eh?”

When everyone in the He clan saw Wang Xian continuing to walk forward, their expressions changed drastically as they hurriedly looked over.

However, Wang Xian continued to walk forward. Every step he took was one thousand meters.

This time, the dark energy in his body did not cause the surrounding flowers and plants to wither.

He had completely mastered the power of darkness.

“Follow him!”

“Activate the formation. Don’t disturb the others!”

The He clan leader hurriedly gave the order.

Wang Xian continued to move forward. A group of more than a hundred people from the He clan and the forest fairy clan followed behind him. They used the formation to conceal a space.

Whoosh

When Wang Xian took the tenth step, an old figure appeared in the sky above them.

“Eh? What’s going on?”

The old man with white hair asked with a face full of astonishment.

“Ancestor, we don’t know either. This young man is a peerless genius at the seventh level of the Seethrough void tier. Please come to us...”

The He clan leader immediately told all the information to the old man.

“What pure power of darkness. It really makes people Panic!”

“He dug out his own heart and came to seek the devil. This...”

Hearing the He clan leader’s words, the old man took a slight breath. He didn’t understand. He also didn’t understand.

“That direction should be the location of the ancient Devil City!”

The white-haired old man said slowly.

“The ancient Devil City. Could it be that he wants to take revenge? The ancient devil city is not simple. Every single one of them is a ruthless person with monstrous ferocity!”

“Moreover, there are as many as seven profound void tier experts there. With his strength, he will be killed if he goes there!”

A clan elder said with a surprised expression.

If there was no need for ancient devil city, they were not willing to provoke them.

It was not because they could match first-rate strength, but because they were too ruthless and cruel.

“We can’t stop him directly. Let’s follow him to take a look!”

The white-haired elder said solemnly.

“Yes, let’s follow behind him. Don’t provoke him!”

The He clansmen immediately followed behind.

The ancient demon city was more than 500,000 kilometers away from this place. Even with Wang Xian’s one-kilometer-per-step, it would take him at least 500,000 steps.

It would also take six to seven days.

However, as an expert above the Seethrough void tier, he would not be affected even if he did not sleep for six to seven days.

Wang Xian’s dark energy was completely under control and didn’t leak out at all. The people around him couldn’t sense his demonic aura either.

Furthermore, there were a group of top-notch experts from the He clan following him. No one could sense him along the way.

Six and a half days later, when it was close to dusk, a city that was emitting blood and dark energy appeared in their sight.

This bloody and brutal energy made everyone from the He clan feel a little uncomfortable.

“Stop. Don’t let the ancient demon city think that we are the ones controlling him!”

The white-haired old man saw the city five kilometers ahead and ordered everyone.

“Yes!”

Everyone from the He clan nodded immediately. They stood in the void and hid in the formation as they watched from afar.

They stared at Wang Xian’s figure and were filled with astonishment.

They were puzzled. They didn’t know why he was here!

When Wang Xian arrived at a thousand meters away from the ancient demon city, he stopped as well.

He raised his head slightly and looked at this huge city.

As the gathering force of the sinners in the vast region, this city was extremely bloody and vast.

The city gate was always wide open. On the city wall, there was a corpse that was more than 20 meters long.

It was the corpse of a seventh level void interpretation beast.

The demonic aura was overwhelming.

“He has stopped. What is he trying to do?”

Everyone from the He clan looked on in astonishment.

Wang Xian stood straight in the middle. Without the concealment of the formation, he appeared in front of everyone.

Even though there were only a million people in the ancient demon city, there were still many people coming in and out at sunset.

“Eh? Where did that guy come from? His style is quite unique!”

“Hoho, he’s really scaring people. His outfit is not bad, TSK TSK!”

“With such a pretentious outfit, he won’t be able to live for long. Hehe!”

At this moment, a few middle-aged men around noticed Wang Xian. They looked at him standing straight in the middle and commented unscrupulously.

Some of these people were wearing masks while some had ferocious looks on their faces.

Wang Xian’s power of darkness was perfectly concealed. They could not sense his strength.

Moreover, everyone in the ancient demon city would hide their cultivation!

Wang Xian’s attire was not weird at all!

“People in front, get out of the way for me!”

At this moment, a group of young men riding a group of ferocious beasts shouted at them.

“Get out of the way! He’s the grandson of a devil master in Ancient Demon City!”

“Get out of the way!”

Everyone around quickly moved to the side. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian was still standing there!

“Eh? There’s a guy who wants to die. He’s new, right? Then he shall become the food for my Mount!”

More than a dozen young men riding on ferocious beasts looked ferocious when they saw him standing there motionlessly.

One of the young men in the middle let out a strange cry. The speed of his mount did not slow down.

“Is that guy courting death?”

“Where did he come from? Haha, it seems like our ancient demon city has another corpse and soul remnant!”

The surrounding people were discussing excitedly when they saw Wang Xian standing there motionlessly.

Bang

Suddenly, under everyone’s shocked gaze, the figure who looked like he was courting death kneeled on the ground and kowtowed towards the ancient demon city.

At the same time, the group of young men on their mounts were slightly stunned.

“Haha, kneeling and kowtowing. What is this fellow doing? Why? Does he want to join me? Haha!”

The young man in the middle shouted with a face full of laughter when he saw Wang Xian suddenly kneeling and kowtowing towards his direction.

The group of young men around also looked at Wang Xian with a mocking expression!

They immediately stopped their mounts and came to a spot ten meters away from Wang Xian. They looked down at Wang Xian from above with a mocking smile on their faces.

“The first three kowtows to the devil, to pay tribute to the millions of souls that are about to die!”

“I want to be a devil, there is no devil in the world!”

“In the midst of slaughter, Eternity!”

A calm voice was heard slowly!
