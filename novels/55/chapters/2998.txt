Chapter 2999: as a huge reward

“Dragon King, there are so many experts around us!”

Around the heaven-connecting tower, the heaven array scanned his surroundings and looked at the detection compass in his hand.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded and scanned his surroundings with his yin-yang and five elements dragon eyes.

There were hundreds of experts above level five divine emperor within a few hundred light years.

“Good heavens, this is the edge of the center of the universe. If it’s the heaven-splitting primordial land, wouldn’t the celestial thearch be worse than a dog?”

Ba Qi said in shock.

“That’s not necessary!”

Wang Xian smiled and stared at the Tower of Babel in front of him.

More and more powerhouses gathered around them. They were all staring and probing in shock.

However, no matter what method they used, they could not enter the Tower of Babel.

“Weng!”

“Rumble Rumble!”

At this moment, another rumbling sound rang out. This rumbling sound was even more powerful.

In the next moment, the entire tower emitted a resplendent divine light. It was as if they were celebrating the coronation!

“This…”

“99th level! We’ve reached the peak, we’ve reached the peak!”

“What exactly is going on? Is there a problem with the tower, or is there really someone who has reached the peak!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Impossible, it’s absolutely impossible for anyone to reach the top. Even the heaven’s favorites from the powerful universe would find it hard to reach the top!”

An unbelievable voice came from the surroundings. Everyone stared blankly at the Tower of Babel that was emitting boundless divine light. They were shocked beyond words.

Buzz

“Hehehe, Dragon King!”

At a location that no one noticed, an lie appeared beside Wang Xian and shouted excitedly.

“How’s the harvest? An Lie!”

Upon hearing an Lie’s voice, Wang Xian and the rest asked excitedly.

“Dragon King, let’s talk inside the heaven-connecting pagoda!”

As an lie spoke, he enveloped Wang Xian and the rest.

At the next moment, they appeared in a huge cultivation room.

From the cultivation room, they could see the surrounding starry sky. They could clearly see the surrounding celestial thearch powerhouses looking in their direction with shocked expressions.

This was the 99th level of the Tower of Babel!

“The 99th level of the Tower of Babel!”

Wang Xian and the rest scanned their surroundings with excitement in their eyes.

“Hehehe, Dragon King, this is all the rewards I received from the Tower of Babel!”

“This tower of Babel places all the rewards in the center.”

An lie pointed at the center and said.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian and the rest looked over and walked over immediately.

“Dragon King, there aren’t many resources, but there are dozens of pills of very high level. The rest are all of these!”

An lie walked over and pointed at the table carved with divine stones in the center.

There were more than twenty jade bottles on the table. The jade bottles contained pills.

At the side, there was a human-shaped sculpture that was emitting a mysterious luster.

Other than these, there were more than a dozen divine artifacts and compasses used by Wizards.

There were not many items.

However, the pills in a few of the jade bottles were of a very high grade.

“This is the portrait of the family of heritage. It’s the portrait of the family of Heritage!”

When the sky array saw the human-shaped sculptures, he revealed an extremely excited expression.

“Oh? The portrait of the family of Heritage?”

Wang Xian looked at the human-shaped sculptures with a glow in his eyes.

The portrait of the heritage race was not an ordinary thing.

The reason why every powerful race could continue to exist was because of three things. The first was their bloodline, the second was their cultivation, and the third was their secret techniques!

As long as these were present, this race would not decline.

Just like the Divine Dragon Race, the powerful bloodline, the cultivation method of the Divine Dragon Transformation, and the offensive secret techniques of the Divine Dragon Transformation!

This was the core of the Divine Dragon Race. As long as these were present, the divine dragon race would not decline.

In fact, the moment the purebred divine dragon was born, the cultivation method of the divine dragon transformation had already been imprinted in his mind.

The soul passed down from generation to generation, never perishing.

However, this kind of soul passed down from generation to generation, only the pinnacle races in the universe could do it.

Ordinary low-level races in the universe would engrave their secret techniques in the inheritance race portraits.

Only universe knights could engrave this kind of inheritance race portraits.

And it would consume a lot of energy.

However, this kind of inheritance race portraits had a very powerful ability, allowing their clansmen to quickly comprehend the secret techniques engraved in them.

Every inheritance race portrait was extremely precious.

This was because it stored the foundation of a race, the foundation of battle.

The stronger the race, the more inherited race portraits.

Of course, this was an exception for the races at the peak of the universe. For example, Wang Xian, after obtaining the Divine Dragon’s inheritance, would have some of the divine dragon’s battle instincts in his soul. He would be able to comprehend some of the Divine Dragon’s battle secret techniques.

This was also the terrifying aspect of the races at the peak of the universe.

“The Mohan clan is a primary race in the universe. They don’t have any imprints on their inheritance statues. You can directly comprehend them!”

Wang Xian said to the sky array.

The inheritance statues also had levels. The inheritance statues of powerful races would have soul imprints. Only the members of their own race would be able to comprehend them. It was useless for the members of other races.

“These inheritance statues will be of great benefit to me!”

Sky Array said with some enthusiasm.

Sky Array evolved into a dragon wizard because of special circumstances. Dragon Wizards could fight above their level, but the conditions for fighting above their level were related to the witchcraft they mastered.

If it weren’t for the fact that the Dragon Palace had a dragon field and sky array evolved into a divine dragon, which greatly increased his comprehension ability, and that he had consumed the common embryo fruit which allowed him to create his own witchcraft formations, it would have been difficult for him to surpass two levels.

Even so, the rate of improvement had increased recently, causing the witchcraft formations that he had created to be unable to keep up.

The legacy race statues of the Mohan clan were of great use to him.

“TSK TSK, be it the legacy race statues or these witchcraft artifacts, they are of great use to you!”

Ba Qi said with slight envy.

“Hehe, keep these legacy race statues and witchcraft artifacts for yourself.”

Wang Xian smiled at the sky array and opened the jade bottles one by one.

The bottles of elixirs were the rewards given by the Mohan clan to the people who ascended the Tower of Babel. According to the number of levels they ascended, they would be given elixirs corresponding to their cultivation level to help them increase their strength.

The elixirs in the 99th jade bottle were divine elixirs of the eighth level of the celestial thearch.

The rest ranged from the second level of the celestial thearch to the seventh level of the celestial thearch.

“Dragon King, these pills should be able to help you achieve a breakthrough, right?”

An lie asked Wang Xian.

“It’s enough!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled with excitement.

It was the right decision for him to come here this time.

He was now at the ninth level of the celestial thearch, and he still needed half of his dragon qi before he could achieve a breakthrough.

This breakthrough was a major breakthrough.

He had broken through from level nine of the godly monarch realm to level one of the godly monarch realm.

If he fought six levels higher, he would have the combat strength of a level seven godly monarch.

With the help of the primaless sacred wings, he could instantly kill a level seven godly monarch.

He could not say that he could destroy the four-armed race and the three-eyed race, but it was enough to fight them.

Most importantly, they had only explored a corner of the Mohan clan’s ruins.

If they had explored all of them, how far would they have advanced?

How far would the Dragon Palace have advanced?
