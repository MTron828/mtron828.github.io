Wang Xian finally understood how terrifying the driftwood winged birds were!

The entire race of the driftwood winged birds were too good at fighting together!

They could completely combine their strength and unleash terrifying attacks!

Ear-piercing sharp attacks!

Long whips that were gathered together and a huge net that blotted out the sky!

All kinds of powerful aoe attacks were aimed at Wang Xian!

If Wang Xian was weaker and his speed was weaker, he might really be killed by the floating wood-winged birds!

“I need to attract them to Wu Sha. I might need a lot of time to destroy them here!”

Wang Xian looked at the huge net and the long whips that were attacking him!

Wang Xian could still destroy this dire beast tribe by himself.

However, this might take a lot of time!

“Whoosh!”

“Whoosh!”

Wang Xian swayed his huge body as streams of flames attacked the floating woodwing birds!

At the same time, he quickly flew towards Wu Sha to avoid the attacks of the floating woodwing birds.

“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”

“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”

The entire floating woodwing birds let out furious roars due to Wang Xian’s attacks and the fact that they had killed their comrades.

They resisted the flames and chased after Wang Xian with fury.

The place where Wu Sha set up the formation was very close to the driftwood winged bird’s Nest!

When Wang Xian arrived at the area covered by the formation, he stopped and turned around. He waved his dragon claws and the five elements millstone attacked the driftwood winged bird directly.

“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”

The floating woodwing birds let out a sharp cry. A green meatball above their heads emitted a green light!

The light condensed into an extremely sharp green floating woodwing bird phantom and met the Five Elements Millstone!

The floating woodwing birds were a desolate beast with wood and wind attributes. They had all sorts of attacking methods!

In addition to the fact that this was their territory, they had the geographical advantage.

“Hehe!”

“Roar!”

When Wang Xian saw them, he let out a chuckle. Following that, he let out a provocative roar and the dragon horns emitted a luster!

Towering Dragon Horns!

A pair of terrifying divine dragon horns emitted a radiance. It was like a terrifying special mountain as it charged towards them.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

The driftwood-winged birds flapped their wings and numerous green seeds covered the dragon horns.

When they arrived in front of the towering dragon horn, they instantly turned into monsters that looked like man-eating flowers and devoured the towering dragon horn!

At the same time, they continued to attack Wang Xian!

“They have entered the formation!”

When Wang Xian saw that the group of floating-wood-winged birds did not sense the formation around them and stepped into it directly, he smiled!

“Dragon King, the floating-wood-winged birds have entered the area. You are blocking their escape route!”

Wu Sha’s voice was instantly transmitted into Wang Xian’s mind!

Wang Xian nodded his head. He flapped his incorporeal holy wings and exerted his maximum speed. He circled around them and flew behind them!

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

The group of floating wood-winged birds locked onto Wang Xian. Their bodies were emitting a green glow as if they could sense Wang Xian’s route.

However, just as they were about to take action, the surrounding scenery changed drastically! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Array Formation: Golden Sand Burial!”

“Array Formation: Fiery Purgatory!”

“Array Formation: black eye imprisonment!”

A slightly hoarse voice sounded, and Wu Sha’s figure appeared in front of them!

She held a powerful connate true treasure staff in her hand, and there were nine snake heads on it!

Each snake head emitted a powerful radiance!

One array formation after another instantly attacked the floating wood-winged birds.

Each of Wu Sha’s formations could kill an existence at the first level of the universe dominator.

Her three formations were activated at the same time. Even the entire flock of floating wood-winged birds had to go all out to deal with it.

However, a second ago, they were still dealing with Wang Xian’s attack.

The Five Elements Millstone was still in front of them.

At this moment, three terrifying formations came down.

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

At this moment, the group of floating woodwings cried out in panic. Their eyes were filled with Panic!

“Innate technique!”

Wang Xian was already behind the group of floating woodwings. When he saw this scene, he stared at the five elemental millstone and let out a low roar!

Innate technique!

The powerful attack of the five elemental millstone!

Buzz

In an instant, the entire five elements millstone started to spin rapidly. The Shadows of the innate spiritual treasures attacked the surrounding floating wood-winged birds one after another!

The shadows of thousands of innate spiritual treasures were emitting a powerful aura!

“Dragon Breath of Life!”

Wang Xian let out a low roar and opened his dragon mouth. A torrent of energy surged forward directly!

Five terrifying attacks landed on the entire group of floating wood-winged birds in an instant!

Each of these attacks was comparable to the strongest attack of a mad demon expert from the Invincible Zone!

An attack launched at the same time was equivalent to the combined attack of five mad demons!

Five Mad Demons working together?

This was simply impossible in the invincible zone.

Not to mention five mad demons, even two mad demons working together had never happened before.

Once Mad Demons and the others went all out in battle, they would definitely lose all rationality. They could only kill. It was impossible for them to work together.

Even if they could temporarily suppress their emotions, they would not be able to hold on for too long.

The floating wooden-winged birds were very strong, but they were only comparable to one or two crazy demon level existences.

If Wang Xian was not afraid of wasting time, he would be able to kill them all by himself.

Now, five attacks were aimed at the entire floating wooden-winged birds.

“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”

All the driftwood winged birds let out extremely sharp and shrill cries.

The waves formed by their cries did not attack their surroundings. Instead, they formed a powerful defense around them.

“Chirp, chirp, Chirp!”

Following that, branches and leaves enveloped all of them in the middle.

In fact, there were nearly five thousand driftwood winged birds. They were stacked together and the driftwood winged birds above them were the first to block the attacks.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly when he saw their defenses.

Boom! Boom! Boom

At this moment, terrifying attacks landed on the floating wood-winged birds.

The wind wave defense and the defense of the branches and leaves quickly collapsed.

However, these layers of defense were able to defend against the innate techniques and the two formations.

However, after the two formations, more than 2,000 floating wood-winged birds could only defend with their lives!

“Boom!”

“Boom!”

“Chirp, chirp, Chirp!”

Two violent sounds were heard, followed by miserable shrieks!

“Chirp, chirp, Chirp!”

The more than 2,000 wooden-winged birds below let out miserable shrieks. Waves of strong murderous aura were emitted from their bodies!

“HMPH, kill them!”

Wang Xian snorted softly. He swayed his huge dragon body and charged forward!

Wu Sha waved her staff, and formations formed one after another. She continued to attack the floating wooden-winged birds.
