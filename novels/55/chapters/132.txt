Chapter 133: Craziness Before Destruction (1)

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Craziness before destruction!

Whenever Wang Xian fought with someone in the past, he did not prefer talks. Instead, he struck immediately.

But this time, he wanted to have some fun.

The Yan Family had been threatening him time and time again. If he did not let them have a taste of despair, he would be letting himself down.

Wang Xian wanted them to fall, as heavy as they could when they were at the top!

“Dragon King!”

Harmonious voices sounded off in front of him. Wang Xian opened his eyes and saw 52 Dragonians gathered before him.

Mo Qinglong, his disciple Mo Yuan, and fifty Dragonians.

Mo Qinglong had already hit the Inborn Realm while his disciple, Mo Yuan, was a Level-nine Martial Artist.

The rest of the remaining Dragonians remained at Level Seven.

Level Seven was considered high in Rivertown. The current Old Xue was only a Martial Artist at Level Seven, but the Xue Family was ranked fourth in Rivertown.

Old Duan was only a Level-eight Martial Artist.

Level-seven Dragonians may not fight two levels above them, but they could easily deal with Level-eight Martial Artists. As for Level-nine Mo Yuan, he could defeat Half-step to Inborn, but he’s still not a match for Inborn Expert. As for Mo Qinglong, he’s invincible to the Inborn Experts.

Wang Xian looked at the Dragonians and pondered.

The strength and defense capability of the Dragonians was not any average Martial Artist could compare with. In the future, they could even fight two or three levels above them once they activated the Divine Dragon bloodline within them.

“With such a strength, it is good enough to deal with the Yan Family!”

Wang Xian looked at the Dragonians and burst out softly, “Follow my orders today. Our target is the Yan Family. Today it’s your first appearance. I hope all of you will not disappoint me!”

“Yes, Dragon King!”

All the Dragonians answered with bountiful fighting spirit.

“Follow me and wait for my orders!”

...

The Yan Family was the number one Ancient Martial Artist Family in Rivertown. They were known as the domineering giant in this place.

Twenty years ago, the Yan Family announced that they would go into seclusion to avoid chaos. They stayed low profile and ignored all underworld and society affairs.

A few days ago, the Yan Family announced their comeback.

Their comeback stirred a great commotion in the entire Rivertown.

In particular, in the Ancient Martial Art circle. Their comeback marked a huge shuffle in the rankings.

Twenty years ago, the Yan Family had three Level-nine, six Level-eight and dozens of Level-seven Martial Artists.

With such strength, the family was an invincible existence in Rivertown at that time.

And they remained invincible at present even with their strength from twenty years ago.

Now, twenty years had passed, and the Yan Family could only be more powerful.

The comeback of the Yan Family struck fear into all the Martial Artists and the Martial Art families in Rivertown.

Today, it was the ninth day since the Yan Family made their comeback. At the same time, it was the day they declared their return formally.

The Yan Family invited all the Martial Artists in Rivertown to the Yan Family’s Mountain Villa.

Everyone knew their intention.

The declaration of the King’s return.

Yan Family’s Mountain Villa was situated before a summit near the sea known as Mount Qingfeng.

The entire Mount Qingfeng belonged to the Yan Family. Hence, the Yan Family’s Mountain Villa was worthy of its name.

The villa was extremely lively in the evening. The Martial Artists and the Martial Art families in Rivertown were not a lot, but were made up of three to four hundred people.

All the Martial Artists were moving to the Yan Family in groups. Some of them had grave expressions, some were feeling uneasy.

Some were looking thrilled.

“When will Wang Xian be here?” asked Old Duan to Old Xue in a group of more than twenty people.

“I called him just now. He should be here soon. Let’s go in!” Old Xue replied slowly with a solemn face.

“Wang Xian did not give any face to the Yan Family. I’m afraid today...” Old Duan was a little worried.

“He should have his own plans!” Old Xue was contemplating too. He could not tell Wang Xian’s thoughts.

Given his understanding of Wang Xian and the imposing vibe that he released occasionally, he could sense the domineering strength in Wang Xian.

Wang Xian was full of mystery. Since he dared to show up for this event, he should have some backings.

But, all these were just his conjectures.

“All the families and Martial Artists in Rivertown are here. No one dares to turn the Yan Family down. I wonder what they will be doing or what announcement they will be making at this event,” Old Duan said as he tensed up.

“We’ll take one step at a time. There are so many Martial Artists in Rivertown. I doubt the Yan Family can take things too far!” Old Xue pondered and answered him as he walked.

“Hur? Isn’t that...?”

Suddenly, an exclamation was heard.

Old Xue and Old Duan peered over their shoulders immediately. They raised their eyebrows. “Hu Family? The one beside the Master of Hu Family is... Whirling Blade Hu Fei? Is Hu Fei part of the Hu Family?”

“This...This is possible. Hu Fei is ranked seventh in Rivertown. Hu Fei did not rise in Rivertown, but in the far North. No one has linked Whirling Blade Hu Fei with the Hu Family. From the looks of it now... Unexpected. Totally unexpected. Hu Fei is a Level-nine Martial Artist!”

“What did the Hu Family bring Hu Fei here for? To strengthen the Hu Family, or are they together with the Yan Family?”

Old Xue and Old Duan were looking even more solemn than ever when they saw the sudden appearance of the Level-nine Martial Artist.

The water in Rivertown got murkier. No one could predict what would happen at tonight’s dinner.

All the Martial Artists entered the ancient-looking villa.

The villa looked retro as if it was one of those secluded villas in the martial arts movies.

Two burly, middle-aged men were standing on the left and right of the entrance.

From the vibes they gave off, all the Martial Artists that streamed in had grave expressions on their faces.

“Even the gatekeepers are Level-five Martial Artists. The Yan Family is too domineering.”

“All the power of all Martial Artists in Rivertown combined may not be comparable to the Yan Family!”

People around exchanged whispers.

Stepping on the red carpet, everyone strolled into the villa.

The villa was huge, with little bridges and streams, looking picturesque.

There was an open space all the way to the back.

It was filled with tables and chairs as though it was a sect gathering from the ancient underworld.

On the tables were fruits and food.

Two striking flags were placed at the sides with words that said:

Return of the hidden dragon!

Roaming the nine skies!

The words were magnificent.

“Guests can sit according to their strengths and rankings!”

A steward-look-alike middle-aged man stood in front and gave everyone the instructions.

His hands were behind his back, with the imposing manner of a Level-eight Martial Artist.

Everyone took a look and headed to their seats after a slight hesitation.

Starting from the second family in Rivertown, Ren Family, Hu Family, Duan Family, Xue Family etc., they sat in their own seats.

Half an hour before the start of the Yan’s dinner event, everyone was here early.

The steward observed the situation with a glimmer of satisfaction on his face. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

This is right. When the Yan Family returns, all of them must submit to them!
