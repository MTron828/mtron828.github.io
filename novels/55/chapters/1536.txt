Chapter 1537: The pursuit of 1537

Wang Xian had a deep understanding of the power of the heartless sword principle.

First, he would dig out his own heart, condense his sword heart, and forget about love.

Forget about the most important person in his heart, and cut off all friendships, love, and family ties.

Even ao Jian and the Golden Swordfish clan, who were bound by their bloodline, would pass their hearts to Wang Xian before practicing the heartless sword principle. They were afraid that they would disobey the Dragon King’s orders.

Ling Jian ‘ER had clearly learned the basics. She had already forgotten her feelings. According to the subsequent practice of the heartless sword principle, she needed to be affectionate.

She needed to reunite her love, kinship, and friendship!

However, this process was also very complicated. It might take decades, or even hundreds of years, or even more, to go from being emotionless to affectionate.

“When I first met Ling Jian ‘er, she was also a troubled girl with a twisted heart. She was still bewitched by her powerful charm. This time, it will be the same!”

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly as a smile appeared on his face.

Compared to the news of Ling Jian ‘Er’s death, she was still alive. This was already the best thing that Wang Xian could think of.

Lying quietly on the ship, Wang Xian looked at Ling Jian ‘ER’s position with his Dragon Eyes of light and dark fire. A smile appeared on his face.

Time passed slowly. Not long after, Ling Jian ‘er and the rest returned. The group walked towards a luxurious mansion.

Wang Xian had been following behind them the entire time. With his current understanding of light and darkness, he hid himself. Even a powerhouse at level eight of the Seethrough void tier would not be able to sense his existence.

Following behind Ling Jian ‘er, she came to a separate courtyard. A servant brought her dinner.

After eating, Ling Jian ‘er took out her long sword and waved it around in the courtyard.

Wang Xian sat in the shadow of the roof and watched with a gratified expression.

Ling Jian ‘er practiced her swordsmanship until around nine o’clock. After that, she returned to her room and sat cross-legged on the bed to cultivate.

After looking at Ling Jian ‘ER who had entered the state of cultivation, Wang Xian stood up slowly.

After hesitating for a moment, he moved his arm and two sculptures appeared in his hands.

Two sculptures. One of them was Wang Xian himself and the other was Ling Jian ‘ER. This was what they looked like when they first met.

He waved his arm gently and the sculptures landed at the entrance.

Following that, his figure disappeared immediately. He blended into the darkness and flew towards the Holy Medicine Clinic.

He wanted to settle the matters at the Holy Medicine Shop and follow Ling Jian ‘ER in the future.

Whoosh

Not long after Wang Xian left, Ling Jian ‘ER’s door opened automatically.

She had already stood up and walked to the door while sitting cross-legged on the bed. She looked at the two sculptures on the ground.

She frowned slightly and picked them up. A cold look slowly appeared in her eyes.

Wang Xian’s sculpture was crushed immediately. She looked at her sculpture and was slightly stunned. Then, she placed it into her interspatial ring.

She came to the courtyard and scanned her surroundings. Her brows were tightly knitted.

Having severed her emotions and six desires, she was extremely perceptive. Just now, she had a vague feeling that someone was watching her.

However, she didn’t know where the person was. From the looks of it now, it was indeed the case!

“What does that young man want to Do?”

Ling Jian ‘er mumbled. She stood in front of the door for a while before entering the room to continue her cultivation. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Uncle Hu, I might be leaving for a period of time. Give this interspatial ring to the hall master as the fee for this period of time!”

“Also, take this interspatial ring for yourself, Uncle Hu!”

After returning to the holy medicine clinic, Wang Xian called Old Hu over and said to him.

“Oh? Reverend Wang, are you going to... ?”

Uncle Hu looked at him in surprise.

“I won’t be leaving for the time being, but I have some matters to take care of!”

Wang Xian said directly.

“Reverend Wang, I’ll inform the head of the clinic about this place. The head of the clinic will probably keep it for you. You can rest assured and take care of your own matters!”

Old Hu said with a smile.

“That’s good too. Thank you for this period of time!”

Wang Xian patted Lao Hu’s shoulder and left with a smile.

“Young master Wang, although you are extremely mysterious, you are a good person!”

Lao Hu looked at Wang Xian’s figure and smiled faintly.

He looked at the two interspatial rings in his hands. When he opened them, his eyes widened slightly and were filled with shock.

“Sect leader Ling!”

When he arrived at the inn where sect leader Ling was staying, Wang Xian’s voice could be heard from inside.

“Creak!”

“Little brother Wang Xian, come in!”

The window was opened and sect leader Ling’s voice could be heard from inside.

“Sect leader Ling, I saw Ling Jian ‘er!”

Wang Xian entered and spoke directly.

“Is Jian ‘er...”

Sect leader Ling looked at Wang Xian and spoke.

“She doesn’t recognize me either. Her emotionless swordsmanship has been cultivated to the point of forgetting emotions. However, I will make her remember everything from the past!”

Wang Xian spoke to him. After hesitating for a moment, he continued, “Sect leader Ling, I plan to hide by Ling Jian ‘ER’s side to protect her from now on. Please make a trip to the north stream sea area and head to the emotionless sword principle sect!”

“That sect was founded not long ago. Ren Xingchen is there too. Get them to come over!”

“Sure. With you by Jian ‘ER’s side, I will be more at ease!”

Sect leader Ling nodded.

After the two of them conversed for a while, Wang Xian left directly and flew towards Ling Jian ‘ER.

When he came to the roof of Ling Jian ‘ER’s house and realized that the statue had disappeared, he was also slightly stunned.

“Cultivating the heartless sword principle will cause one’s perception to be extremely terrifying. It seems like I have to hide even more!”

He mumbled as he lay on the roof and watched Ling Jian ‘er who was sitting cross-legged on the bed cultivating quietly.

Early in the morning, Ling Jian ‘ER woke up and began to practice her swordsmanship. Not long after, a servant brought her some food.

After eating, Ling Jian ‘er went to a library in the mansion and quietly flipped through all kinds of books.

In the afternoon, the young man from yesterday came to look for Ling Jian ‘er to play, but was rejected by Ling Jian ‘ER.

At night, she continued to practice her swordsmanship and sat cross-legged to cultivate.

Wang Xian had been guarding her in the dark for an entire day. At night, he waved his arm and the two sculptures were thrown to the door again.

He hoped that he could use this method to awaken some of her memories.

However, when he saw Ling Jian ‘er crushing his sculptures into dust, the corner of his mouth twitched slightly.

Fortunately, she kept her sculpture.

“Your Highness, the Emperor is here and he is calling for you!”

In the morning, a maid came to the library and said to Ling Jian ‘ER.

“Alright, I’ll be there right away!”

Ling Jian ‘er nodded and put down the book. She followed the maid out.

“The Emperor of the Bingxin Empire? He seems to be a powerhouse at level seven of the Seethrough Realm!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. He hid under the light and followed behind quietly.

After the day yesterday, he had also learned some news. For example, Ling Jian ‘er was now the princess of the Bingxin Empire.

By a Patriarch of the Bingxin dynasty as the last disciple.
