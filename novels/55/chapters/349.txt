Chapter 350: Level 11

Weng weng weng!

Wang Xian was shocked as he stared at the branch which had only been the size of an arm previously.

“This is...? In my body?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Wang Xian felt the desire within his body and an object flashed in his mind. This was something which he had nearly forgotten.

It was the Progenitor Tree, the object that was extracted from the stone-betting rock from Jade Nation.

The Ancestor of All Wood, the Progenitor Tree.

When the Progenitor Tree was first absorbed into his body, Wang Xian had tirelessly practiced for an entire month to provide the Azure dragon energy for it to absorb.

However, it didn’t show any signs of movements after taking root within his body.

It did not bring him any major benefits or any changes.

All it did was remained silently in his body.

But now, the Progenitor Tree was reacting rigorously and desired to absorb that Soul Returning Branch.

Wang Xian recalled seeing records of the Soul Returning Tree in an ancient book.

The Soul Returning Tree was a magical thing. If one was to latch a small part of his soul with the Soul Returning Tree, the person’s soul would be absorbed by it when he died.

After absorbing the soul, the tree would bear the soul fruit. Through a special method, one could be revived.

This was a divine tree with unimaginable powers that was recorded in the mythology.

He didn’t expect he would find a branch of the Soul Returning Tree.

However, this branch has almost lost all its vitality. Furthermore, this is just a Level 9 item and is a far cry from other Inborn Spiritual Weapons.

Wang Xian was having second thoughts.

He was not sure about the truthfulness of the records on the Soul Returning Tree. Furthermore, it wouldn’t be a wise choice to get a Level 9 item when there were so many Inborn Spiritual Objects around.

Just as Wang Xian was hesitating, the desire from the Progenitor Tree within his body grew even stronger.

Let’s hope that the Progenitor Tree would bring better changes after absorbing this branch. Otherwise, I would have made a dumb decision!

Wang Xian felt a little gloomy. He picked up the Soul Returning Branch and said, “I’ll be getting this!”

Eh?

The old man was a little surprised to see Wang Xian pick up a wretched branch.

Although that branch wasn’t ordinary, it was at most a Level 8 or 9 item based on his experience. It was still a far cry from an Inborn Spiritual Object.

Nonetheless, he wouldn’t mind Wang Xian choosing a wretched branch.

“You can’t reverse your decision once you have chosen!” said the old man plainly with a gentle smile.

“Naturally!” replied Wang Xian as he nodded his head.

Subsequently, he looked at the old man and asked, “I heard that Medical Saint Sect and Medical Tripod Mountain Sect could exchange items here with elixir pills. Is this still allowed now?”

“Exchange? That will depend on the elixir pills you are offering and the item you would like to get. If we have the need, we could do the exchange!” the old man smiled and replied.

“I’d like to get some Spiritual Stones!” Wang Xian replied instantly.

At this point, Wang Xian had five thousand spiritual stones. This included spiritual stones gathered by the dragonians and those from the floating island.

He was still short five thousand to have enough to build the Dragon Palace.

Besides that, he had gathered close to sixty percent of all other resources required. As long as he had enough spiritual stones, the construction of the Dragon Palace was in sight.

“If it is just spiritual stones, we can purchase your elixir pills based on the market rates,” the old man replied.

“Alright. For Level 1 elixir pills, I have 150 Qi Accumulation Pills and 30 Body Strengthening Pills. For Level 2 elixir pills, I have 20 Bone Grinding Pills and 15 Channel Nourishing Pills. For Level 3 elixir pills, I have 20 Soul Enhancement Pills.”

Wang Xian took out some pills of each type as he explained to the old man.

“Wow, so much?” The old man gasped in shock.

The old man beamed and started counting the value of these elixir pills silently. “Two thousand spiritual stones. We can offer you two thousand spiritual stones. If you want more, this deal is off.”

“Two thousand spiritual stones!” Wang Xian nodded his head slightly and continued, “These pills are in Rivertown currently? How shall we do the trade?”

“I will give you a number later. You can call this number when you are back in Rivertown. Someone will contact you about the details for the trade!” the elderly man said with a big smile.

“Alright!” Wang Xian replied with a nod.

After exiting the National Treasury, Wang Xian and Miracle Doctor Blood Man put on the eye masks again as they walked out.

Night had fallen and the moon hung high up in the skies when they left the palace.

Wang Xian looked at the time and realized it was already past 9 pm. However, as a city that never sleeps, Shangjing was still well lit.

The skyscrapers around and the shops were still operating. Wang Xian looked at Sun Lingxiu and asked, “What would you like to eat?”

“Hmm? I would like some authentic roasted duck of Shangjing. Speaking of which, this is my first time in Shangjing.” Sun Lingxiu looked around her before turning towards Wang Xian and replying with a beautiful smile.

“This is just my second time here. Let’s go have some roasted duck!” exclaimed Wang Xian.

Subsequently, they called for a hired car to bring them to the famous roasted duck restaurant.

Miracle Doctor Blood Man saw his master with Wang Xian. Therefore, he pretended to be invisible and followed behind them silently. At the same time, he was observing this prosperous city inquisitively.

After dinner, the trio found a hotel to rest at before heading back to Rivertown the next day.

In the hotel, Wang Xian took out the Barraging Blaze Ball and Soul Returning Branch.

“Devour!”

He spat out the Dragon Ball and watched it slowly devour the Barraging Blaze Ball. The Dragon Ball was the size of an egg but emitted a scorching high temperature.

Wang Xian hurriedly isolated the flames by sending in streams of dragon energy before continuing his observation solemnly.

The Dragon Ball had now devoured the Lava Ball, Body Refining Spiritual Flame Ball and the Barraging Blaze Ball.

The three different Spiritual Flame Balls each had their own unique effects. The Lava Ball was dense and highly penetrative, the Body Refining Spiritual Flame Ball was gentle, and the Barraging Blaze Ball was violent.

On the Dragon Ball, a faint but vivid image of an Inferno Divine Dragon materialized and appeared savage.

Roar!

When the dragon fully absorbed the Barraging Blaze Ball, faint cries of a dragon emanated from it.

The Dragon Ball started rotating slowly.

Dragon Ball: Level 11.

Witnessing the evolution of the Dragon Ball, Wang Xian was ecstatic.

A Level 11 inferno Dragon Ball could exhibit the power of a Dan Realm expert under his control.

With the support from the Inferno Divine Dragon and while he was in his human form, there would be few Dan Realm experts who could match him.

Wang Xian then turned his attention to the Soul Returning Branch. He picked it up and started to inspect it.

Besides the mysterious energy in it, the branch was no different from any other withered branches.

Wang Xian’s eyebrows knitted together. Dense streams of Azure Dragon energy started to flow into the branch.

Weng!

At this moment, the branch seemed to be activated and started to emit a greyish glow.

Weng!

Suddenly, Wang Xian felt as though the Progenitor Tree had extended out a needle-thin extension that penetrated through his body and into contact with the Soul Returning Branch.

To his astonishment, the Soul Returning Branch was pulled into his body.

A sapling the size of an index finger was wiggling in Wang Xian’s body. Subsequently, the first branch grew out of the sapling.

The branch was different from the jade green Progenitor Tree. This branch was greyish and it was emitting a greyish glow.

It looked incomparably mysterious.

Wang Xian was astonished as he stared at the Progenitor Tree in his body.

“What is this damn thing? Other than growing a branch, there are no other changes after absorbing the Soul Returning Branch!”
