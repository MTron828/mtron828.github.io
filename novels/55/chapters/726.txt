Chapter 727: 0728 Dragon King Banquet 6(5/20)

Translator: 549690339

It was unbelievable. No one could believe what was happening before their eyes.

Elder Ming’s body was actually penetrated by a white figure. It was very difficult for him to survive this attack.

Elder Ming was not an ordinary elder of the Ming Wang Immortal sect. He was at the half-step immortal God realm and was ranked in the top three below the immortal God realm.

Such a terrifying powerhouse was actually killed right away.

Most importantly, he actually dared to kill him!

Dragon King of the Dragon Gate!

“Cough cough, cough cough, you, you, you...”

The white-haired middle-aged man was no longer as cold and calm as before. He stared at Wang Xian with his eyes wide open. His body bent down slowly and hugged the spot where his wound was.

“Father... No... No.”

Obviously, Feng who was still alive saw that his father was being attacked as well. His eyes were filled with regret.

What kind of people did they offend? They didn’t care about their background at all.

Moreover, the strength that he displayed also made them feel terrified.

An expert who was half a step away from the immortal God was instantly killed!

“Gulp!”

Beside him, Deacon Zhang gulped, his eyes filled with fear.

He killed four core disciples of the Ming Wang Immortal sect and killed elder Ming.

Obviously, he completely disregarded their background. Looking at the indifferent youth, Deacon Zhang’s scalp went numb and his body trembled!

The thin and weak youth and the girl half-knelt on the ground and clutched their chest, their faces filled with cold sweat.

When they saw this scene, they looked a little dazed.

They didn’t expect this at all. They didn’t expect this kind of result at all.

Join our immortal sect?

Deliberately attract attention?

No wonder the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate said that they were narcissistic and arrogant.

He didn’t want to attract the attention of the immortal sect at all, but he didn’t take it seriously from the beginning to the end.

“Coming uninvited, one of your sins!”

“Trespassing is the second offense!”

“A disciple of the immortal sects is causing trouble, yet he still came to question us. The third offense!”

“Therefore, all of you should stay here!”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the people from the puppet immortal sect and the Ming Wang Immortal sect as he spoke slowly.

After he finished speaking, the group of drakonids behind him walked towards them.

“The immortal masters from our immortal sects will not let you off. We will not let you off!”

Deacon Zhang could not help but take two steps back as he spoke with a face full of fear.

There were a total of 30 members of the Dragon sect behind Wang Xian. The Aura that they emitted was at least at the infant stage.

Looking at so many infant stage powerhouses, deacon Zhang’s face was filled with despair.

He did not expect that the former faction of the Jianghu would have so many powerhouses.

They weren’t afraid of the celestial sect.

“Leave that girl behind to collect their corpses!”

Wang Xian pointed at the severely injured girl and said to the DRAKONID.

It wasn’t that he was soft on the fairer sex, but this girl was the only one among the six young men who walked over with curiosity.

The other five people were all mocking and looking down on him.

Wang Xian admitted that he wasn’t a good person. Too many martial artists had died because of him.

However, all of them were provoked by others.

This was especially so during the massacre of the martial arts world. They wanted to besiege the Dragon Gate and kill his sister, Lan Qingyue, and the rest.

They even implicated the Xue family.

Naturally, he would not hesitate at all. If you want to slaughter my entire family, I will exterminate your entire family!

He would not show any mercy!

The moment Wang Xian finished speaking, all the DRAKONIDS moved. At the scene, only Deacon Zhang, an infant stage powerhouse, was standing.

They had no ability to resist at all.

When the surrounding River City martial artists saw their own immortal sect’s powerhouse being killed, they were stunned.

Mo Qinglong looked at the river city martial artists who were approaching the immortal sect earlier and shouted for them to make the decision.

“No, no, spare us. We are forced to do so. Spare us!”

Everyone broke down when they saw Mo Qinglong’s gaze. They knelt on the ground and begged for mercy.

“All of them are crippled. Let’s be ordinary people from now on!”

Mo Qinglong said coldly. His body moved and destroyed the Dantian of dozens of people.

Everyone’s faces were filled with despair. It was not easy for them to join the celestial sect. Now, they had become ordinary people. That feeling filled their hearts with despair.

Wang Xian walked to the side of the only girl.

The girl was panting heavily. Her eyes were filled with fear. The innocent curiosity and liveliness from before had disappeared completely.

“Tell your celestial gods not to provoke me. Otherwise, they will bear the consequences themselves!”

“Yes, yes!”

The girl frowned and nodded her head with some fear in her eyes.

“Also, remember not to target any of my friends!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and swept his gaze across the martial artists around him.

All the martial artists in Jiang City could not help but take a step back. Their eyes were filled with fear.

Wang Xian ignored them and left directly from the spot where he had broken through. The group of Drakonids followed closely behind him and soon disappeared from everyone’s sight.

“Huff! Huff! Huff!”

Wang Xian left. The rapid breathing sounds in the banquet hall could be heard.

“The Real Dragon King is back!”

The entire banquet hall was silent for a long time. Finally, an old man slowly uttered a few words. His gaze swept across the surroundings as he staggered out of the hall.

“Miss Feiyuan, are you alright? Let’s... Let’s send their corpses back to the immortal sect!”

Some of the martial artists who had joined the puppet immortal sect and the Ming Wang Immortal sect looked at the girl who was slowly standing up and said hesitantly.

“I... I’ll inform the Immortal Sect!”

Looking at the corpses of the disciples and elders around her, Feiyuan was silent. She took out a signal flare from her interspatial ring.

The white signal flare flicked gently toward the outside.

“All of you, leave!”

Feiyuan said to the surrounding warriors of river city.

“Miss Feiyuan, then... we’ll leave First!”

The group of people felt a little heavy-hearted and slowly walked out.

They had joined an immortal sect and had an immortal sect as their backer. They thought that the Dragon King would be afraid of them, but in the end...

This result was hard for them to accept.

“Dragon King!”

A young man clenched his fist tightly and looked at the corpses of the experts of the immortal sect around him. His eyes flickered. He took out his cell phone and secretly took pictures one by one!

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

At this moment, an extreme white light lit up in the sky. At the same time, loud sounds spread far and wide.

The white light stopped in the sky, like white stars that flickered gently.

A total of five white dots appeared in the surroundings and stopped in the sky.

At this moment, in the Ming King City next to the Ming King Immortal sect.

The ancient city was bustling with activity. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Emergency signal, emergency signal from the north!”

“Five-star emergency signal, not good, a half-step immortal God is in trouble!”

“What happened? Why is there a five-star emergency signal!”

Suddenly, a disciple of mingwang immortal sect looked toward the northern sky in shock.

Five light dots stood in the sky. This was a kind of emergency signal from Mingwang Immortal sect.

Five stars, which meant that a half-step immortal God had met with misfortune.

This level of signal flares, the first time!
