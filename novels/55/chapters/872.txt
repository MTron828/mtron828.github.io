“Phoenix Immortal Pill and Weapon Workshop!”

Wang Xian muttered as he sat on the Dragon Chair. Following that, he frowned slightly.

He had seen Feng Luan’s alchemy skills before. With her Vermillion Bird bloodline and her rich experience, she could definitely build a powerful forging workshop.

“It’s possible that Feng Luan needed to accumulate resources when she returned to the transcendence continent. She also built a forging workshop. This is the fastest way to earn spirit stones. It’s the same as what I thought!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. When he entered the Yongchang world, he had accumulated a large amount of resources by refining pills and weapons.

He originally planned to accumulate a large amount of resources in the same way after he entered the transcendence continent.

Wang Xian was confident that if he opened an alchemy and weapon forging workshop, his leveling speed would definitely be terrifying.

However, since Feng Luan had already used this method, he could only think of another way.

He had been with Feng Luan for quite some time. Although he didn’t possess her physical body, it could be considered as possessing her soul.

Naturally, Wang Xian wouldn’t compete with Feng Luan in terms of elixirs and weapons.

In that case, he could only think of another way.

This caused him to frown slightly. This was a little troublesome.

“A holy land for cultivation? Is it easy to obtain?”

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment before asking them directly.

This caused the ten of them to be slightly stunned. A look of astonishment appeared on their faces, following that, they shook their heads bitterly. “Dragon King, anyone who can possess a holy land for cultivation is a powerful force. Even if it is a small-scale holy land for cultivation, it is not something that can be obtained by ordinary cultivators!”

“In fact, even an insightful void martial artist might not be qualified to occupy a holy land for cultivation. Only those forces that have at least a thousand years of heritage are qualified to occupy a holy land for cultivation!”

Upon hearing their words, Wang Xian frowned. “Other than cultivating a holy land and medicinal pills and weapons, is there any other way to increase one’s strength quickly and obtain a large amount of resources?”

“In order to increase one’s strength and obtain a large amount of resources, other than cultivating a holy land, medicinal pills and weapons, there are also mercenary groups. The income of a large-scale mercenary group is also very terrifying. If one can complete a mission above the level of a diamond, the reward is also very terrifying.”

The shady-looking young man immediately replied.

“Mercenary group?”

Wang Xian was hesitant. “Are there any divisions of the maritime forces on the transcendence continent? What about the marine races?”

“For the Marine Forces, the Dragon Race has occupied the Dragon God Sea area. The other parts of the sea area have also been occupied by the various marine races. Basically, the rich sea areas have all been occupied. The weaker marine races might not have a seethrough void stage expert, but there will definitely be a level seven or eight transcendence expert. Moreover, in the chaotic sea area, there are all kinds of ferocious underwater beasts that are even more terrifying in strength!”

The shady-looking young man continued to answer.

Wang Xian slowly closed his eyes. It was troublesome. It seemed that it was not so easy to establish a foothold in the supernatural continent.

The idea of occupying an area directly in the ocean should be eliminated.

Mercenaries?

Wang Xian knocked on the dragon chair gently and pondered quietly.

For the next period of time, Wang Xian did not cultivate. He was prepared to accompany Guan Shuqing and the rest of the girls to travel around the world.

He was prepared to bring them to every place in the world.

The group of girls also knew that Wang Xian would leave after Xiao Yu’s wedding. Therefore, they were especially cherishing this period of time.

What made Wang Xian even more surprised was that it might be because the group of girls had stayed for too long, or it might be because Wang Xian’s body was too strong.

Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue, Sun Lingxiu, and a Jiaya, the four girls suddenly told Wang Xian one day to take in concubines.

At that time, Wang Xian was completely stunned. Taking concubines? There was such a good thing.

However, when he saw the flushed faces of Tang Yinxuan and elder fan, Wang Xian came to a sudden realization. Soon after, an excited smile appeared on his face.

Needless to say, elder fan had a perfect figure. The ones who were the most perfect compared to the other girls were Xiong and Pigu.

That was awesome...

Tang Yinxuan, the voice that made Wang Xian’s heart skip a beat. Just thinking about that voice... Cough cough...

Elder fan and Tang Yinxuan would definitely belong to the Dragon Palace in the future.

Furthermore, the two of them were together with Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue, and the others all day long. They were like sisters. The four girls didn’t want the two of them to be lonely all the time.

No matter what, the current Wang Xian was like an emperor on Earth. Furthermore, he already had four wives. It wasn’t unacceptable for him to have two more.

Most importantly, the six of them had set down the family rules. When they arrived at the transcendence continent, they were not allowed to flirt with other women. Otherwise, they would bear the consequences.

Naturally, Wang Xian patted his chest and promised.

“It is understandable that the ancient kings did not attend court early!”

One morning a week later, Wang Xian was lying on the huge bed in his bedroom. He looked at the six beautiful girls beside him and felt great.

“Let’s take care of some things and then go on a vacation!”

Wang Xian slowly put on his clothes and went to the Dragon King’s Palace to explain some things to Prime Minister Gui.

As for the matters regarding the supernatural continent, he temporarily put it to the back of his mind.

“Xiao Xian, we are ready. Let’s go, our romantic Paris and Turkey!”

After Wang Xian had taken care of everything, Guan Shuqing and the other girls had already gotten up. Each of them was carrying a bag. There was no zone between them and modern women. They spoke to him.

“Haha, Alright, Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian laughed out loud and flew out of the Dragon Palace with the six girls.

“Let’s Go!”

The few girls were exceptionally excited. They came to the floating island. At the bottom of the island, a few yakshas who were patrolling the sea were driving rapidly towards the western continent.

This was Wang Xian’s first time coming to the western continent. It was also his first time coming to the European continent.

Among the other girls, only Ah Jiaya had come.

Before the huge floating island reached the European continent, there were already experts who discovered it.

“A floating island?”

“Floating island. That’s a floating island. There are only four floating islands in the entire Earth!”

“The Dragon King’s Floating Island. That’s the Dragon King’s Floating Island!”

Some western martial artists noticed the situation here and were discussing loudly with faces full of surprise.

When they found out that it was the Dragon King’s Floating Island, all of them were shocked.

“Hurry up and report to the gods!”

“Take a look at my travel plan. Stay in Paris for five days, then go here, and then go here!”

On the Floating Island, Guan Shuqing held her phone and said to a few girls.

“Alright, Alright. There’s a fashion show in Paris. I’ll buy some new clothes then!”

The group of girls were chattering excitedly.

Wang Xian was watching from the side with great satisfaction.

“Welcome, Dragon King!”

Before the floating island neared the shore, shouts could be heard.

The six girls looked over and immediately laughed.

In front of them, there were at least forty to fifty immortals. All of them were respectfully lined up in two rows.

In the middle, a huge red carpet extended from the shore to the floating island.

Ostentatious!

The western gods were very interesting. When the Dragon King arrived, they immediately rushed over and quickly put on an ostentatious display.

The gods were on both sides of the red carpet, standing in the Void!
