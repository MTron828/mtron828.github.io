Chapter 650: A Rewarding Trip

Translator: Larbrestudio

At present, Wang Xian was more optimistic about the development of Golden Swordfish and Mysterious Demon race, given their potential and combat capabilities.

Golden Swordfish practicing swordsmanship after they turned into humans were extremely daunting.

Especially when Wang Xian saw the attacking means of Roving Sword today. Hence, he valued the future Golden Swordfish more.

He recalled that Roving Sword had returned to his original Golden Swordfish form and transformed into the terrifying Merciless Sword, confronting the enemy.

I’m the sword, slaying the void.

If Roving Sword and the Golden Swordfish clan decided to become immersed in swordsmanship, they might become the peerless swordsmen of the universe.

At that time, they could slash the starry sky with a golden longsword.

As for the Mysterious Demon race, their talent in metamorphosis into any environment would make them the top grade killers.

Wang Xian was two levels higher than Level 11 Mysterious Demon. Yet, they could remain hidden within his water energy region.

Not to mention, one of them was in the Immortal-class realm.

“If the Golden Swordfish Race could become supreme-class swordsmen that could slash the starry sky, then the Mysterious Demon race could become unparalleled killers that eliminate thousands of enemies.”

Wang Xian stared at the Mysterious Demon with eyes full of surprise.

Wang Xian regarded these two races highly and was looking forward to their growth.

On the contrary, Wang Xian had not discovered the advantage of the Anomalocaris and Devil Monkeys.

The potential that both races displayed was worse than the Yaksha race.

The speed of the Yaksha race, combined with their attacking skills, and compelling defense, made them the best guards for the Dragon Palace.

I will subdue races in terms of their potential in the future!

Wang Xian pondered to himself as he looked to the leader of the Mysterious Demon race. “Today, I’ll bestow upon you the name ‘Roving Demon.’ You’ll be responsible for any assassinations arranged by the Dragon Palace, known as the Dragon Assassinating Division. In the future, you’ll be practicing Light Divine Dragon Transformation!”

“Thank you, Dragon King!” Roving Demon bowed down with respect.

Wang Xian nodded slowly. “Does your nest have any worldly treasures? Bring them up!”

“Dragon King, we have some pure Blood Corals!” Roving Demon answered.

“Okay, bring everything up!”

Mysterious Demon race’s constitution was in favor of light. They could make use of light to alter their body colors and aura so as to camouflage themselves in the environment. Hence, Wang Xian could only teach them the Light Divine Dragon Transformation.

Practicing light-attributed skills would allow them to walk under the sun as assassins.

“Hur? You actually have so many pure Blood Corals in your lair?”

When Wang Xian followed them to one of the mountains, he was shocked to see the number of pure Blood Corals.

There were about a thousand tufts of them. Each of them was on par with Level 6 elixir pills.

“More than a thousand tufts of pure Blood Corals are much more than what we had searched for in half of the disordered region. They are very valuable. It looks like the Mysterious Demons have collected quite a number of treasures with their daunting concealment skills. No wonder all of them are at least Level 11, and not a single Inborn could be found!”

Wang Xian was thrilled. The number of pure Blood Corals was equivalent to over a hundred million points of Dragon Energy, which could help a Dragon Palace member to advance to the Immortal Realm!

“Prime Minister Turtle must advance to Immortal first. Then, the remaining materials should be able to cultivate another one!”

“Let’s go!”

Wang Xian was elated as he raised his voice at the dragonians and members of the Dragon Palace. All of them continued to swim ahead.

Subsequently, Wang Xian and his gang killed all the Manta Ray they met along the way in the disordered region, reaping all the pure Blood Corals and Devil Cloud Beads.

Days passed, and the resources Wang Xian gained were increasing at a terrifying rate.

“Dragon King, the nest of the Manta Ray is straight ahead!”

When Wang Xian and the gang arrived at a massive mountain in the bottom of the sea four days later, Roving Demon appeared by his side to remind him.

“Is it here?”

Wang Xian looked at the mountain that was towering over the sea with radiance flickering in his eyes.

He looked ahead and spotted a pair of bloodshot pupils staring right in his direction.

“Let’s take a detour!”

Wang Xian did not want to provoke this fellow and decided to make a detour out of the Manta Ray King’s region.

Seeing them taking another route around it, the Manta Ray King went back to his nest.

He knew he was not a match for those two fellows. Since they did not provoke him, he would jolly well turn a blind eye.

He was not a fool.

Woosh!

Thirteen days later, Wang Xian surfaced out from the water and transformed back to his human form.

Behind him, dragonians followed and stood on the water.

“We’re at the end of it!”

Wang Xian had a faint smile on his face. They had reached the end after combing through the entire disordered region, and almost all the treasures were ransacked from it.

“Let’s go back. I wonder if Shuqing is awake. Xiao Yu, Qingyue, and the rest should be anxiously waiting for me!”

Wang Xian slowly walked ahead as he spoke with an indifferent tone.

Dragon Kid walked to Wang Xian and asked respectfully, “Dragon King, the Devil Kid has a luxurious yacht. Should I steer it over?”

“Go on!”

Wang Xian nodded.

In less than ten minutes, a yacht of a size more than a hundred meters long steered over. It was white in color, looking extravagant.

The yacht was divided into four stories.

“Dragon King, I got the shipping company to make this for me while I provided the materials. It can withstand up to a Level 8’s full-blown attack. The interior is also decorated in the most high-class style!”

Dragon Kid walked over and spoke to Wang Xian with high esteem.

“Mm, let’s go!”

Wang Xian looked at the yacht and laughed.

Even if this kind of yacht was made of average materials, it would be worth more than a billion dollars.

However, money was nothing but a worldly possession to Wang Xian.

He had seen at least a few hundred shipwrecks in the sea. There was gold, jewelry, porcelain, and other precious artifacts that could add up to hundreds of billions, if not trillions.

Wang Xian had been letting them lie around in the sea.

Now he needed Spiritual Stones the most. When the Nine Cauldron Worlds descended into the real world, Spiritual Stones would become the currency.

“Let’s head to Glacier Coral Island!”

Wang Xian flew to the highest story of the yacht with a beaming face. He stood on the deck in front of the most luxurious lounge, staring ahead!

The rest of the Dragon Palace members followed behind at a farther distance!

“The treasures within the space ring will suffice for cultivating another two Immortal-class experts. One of them will be Prime Minister Turtle, but who should I choose next?”

Wang Xian touched his own space ring with a hesitant look.

“Roving Heavens, Roving Yaksha, Nine Venomous Snakes, Roving Anomalocaris, Roving Lobster, Roving Girl...

“Perhaps, I can get them to spar. Whoever wins will be promoted to the Immortal Realm?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. This was a feasible method, as he could also witness their strength.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
