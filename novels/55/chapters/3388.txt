“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”

The group of Thundercloud Vultures seemed to be mocking Wang Xian when they saw him flying backward.

“I didn’t expect this tree to be a blessed land. It’s really strange!”

Wang Xian flew around the purple tree and muttered.

“Boom!”

He tried it out and a powerful force struck the purple tree again.

“Bang!”

The powerful attack was deflected, and he hurriedly dodged into the distance.

“The defense is very strong. I reckon that even a level one universe Overlord’s attack can’t break the defense of this paradise!”

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly.

“Chirp, chirp, Chirp!”

“Chirp, chirp, Chirp!”

On the purple tree, there were dozens of Thundercloud vultures flying inside. Their eyes were staring at him as they cried out.

Their voices were unusually messy and ear-piercing. It was obvious that they were mocking him.

“Hehe, you thundercloud vultures, don’t get too cocky!”

Wang Xian’s eyes turned cold. His universe ai immediately informed an lie!

Buzz

After receiving an Lie’s reply, Wang Xian set up a demonic altar.

“Dragon King!”

An Lie’s figure appeared and bowed to him!

“Bring me in Here!”

Wang Xian pointed to the spot in front of him and said.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

After placing it on a demonic spirit altar, he immediately returned to Wang Xian’s side.

“Five elements grinding, five elements world!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and the five elements grinding flew to the sky above the purple tree. A grayish energy enveloped the entire purple tree.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian shouted softly and entered the purple tree in the next moment.

“Chirp, chirp, Chirp!”

When the group of Thundercloud vultures saw that Wang Xian had disappeared, they were puzzled and cried out.

“Let’s see where you bunch of animals can run to!”

Wang Xian’s faint voice rang in the minds of every thundercloud vulture.

“Chirp, chirp, Chirp!”

Upon hearing this voice, the feathers of the two thundercloud vultures with the combat strength of A Level 9 universe knight exploded. Their eyes were filled with fear.

Boom

The next moment, Wang Xian’s figure appeared beside a thunder cloud vulture and smashed his fist down. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Bang

The tremendous force immediately caused the thunder cloud vulture to land heavily on the purple tree. A large amount of blood flowed out of its mouth.

“Wind and Thunder Chains!”

Wang Xian growled. Countless chains behind him attacked the Thunder Cloud Vultures one by one.

“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”

“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”

At this moment, all the Thundercloud vultures let out terrified cries and flapped their wings in an attempt to escape.

However, in this small space of the grotto-heaven blessed land, they could not avoid Wang Xian’s attack at all.

The chains restrained them and Wang Xian pulled with his arm.

“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”

Seven to eight hundred Thundercloud vultures were easily captured by Wang Xian.

Among them, there were twelve Thundercloud vultures with universe knight level seven combat strength and above.

“Not bad, not bad. The harvest this time is much more than the Thundercloud vultures in the entire thunderlight race!”

He smiled.

There were only a few dozen Thundercloud vultures in the thunderlight race. The harvest this time was dozens of times more than theirs.

After putting them away, Wang Xian inspected this blessed land.

The purple trees should be able to produce some fruits. However, there weren’t any fruits on the trees. It was possible that the Thundercloud vultures had devoured them.

“Continue!”

After he left, he continued flying forward.

Following that, he flew within the Thunderclouds and kept all the treasures in his bag.

Halfway through, he encountered another blessed land.

It was a blessed land with a strong offensive power.

There was a tribe of thunder male apes living in that blessed land. There were more than 10,000 of them. The strongest one was a level 9 universe knight.

Initially, Wang Xian thought it would be a huge harvest. He didn’t expect them to occupy such a powerful blessed land.

That terrifying offensive power had injured Wang Xian with just one strike.

He didn’t dare to stay any longer and ran away.

This also made him understand why the Thunder Ray race didn’t completely occupy the Thunder Cloud region.

It wasn’t just because they weren’t strong enough. There were also these powerful grotto-heavens and blessed lands.

Just like the grotto-heavens and blessed lands where the Thunder Cloud Vulture was located, the Thunder Ray race couldn’t do anything about it, let alone this grotto-heavens and blessed lands with terrifying attacks.

If it wasn’t for Wang Xian’s relatively fast speed, an ordinary expert at the peak of the Universe Knight Realm would have a 50% chance of being killed directly.

I’ll leave after two months of searching

It had been half a year since he entered this place. Wang Xian looked at the time and thought to himself.

Let’s see if I can get some treasures at the last minute

He moved his body and continued to fly forward.

Buzz Buzz

After flying for half an hour, the uninitiated holy wings on his back suddenly trembled.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian’s body moved as he looked to the right.

In that direction, he sensed a strong attraction force of lightning. This attraction force shocked him.

“What level is this treasure?”

He muttered and immediately flew to the right.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Before he could get close, roars were heard. The terrifying roars caused Wang Xian’s expression to change slightly.

“This is?”

He lowered his speed and tried his best to conceal his figure as he approached slowly.

Soon, a thunder male ape that was about 10,000 meters in size appeared in his line of sight.

On the left side of the Thunder Male Ape, there was a 100-meter-sized thunder cloud vulture. On the right side, there was a purple thunder snake that was a few thousand meters in size.

On the head of this thunder snake, there was a huge thunder horn with the lightning symbol floating on it.

The three desolate beasts looked at each other from afar. Their cold eyes stared at each other warily.

Around them, there were a large number of corpses. On the corpses of these desolate beasts, there was still a powerful aura.

“A desolate beast with the combat strength of a peak universe Knight.”

Wang Xian’s gaze focused as he exclaimed in his heart.

His gaze immediately looked towards the center of them.

At the center of them, there was a powerful Thunderbolt Force blooming on the ground.

This thunderbolt force made even Wang Xian feel an unusual fear. He was sure that if he were to approach this thunderbolt, he would probably be pierced through.

The three peak universe knight desolate beasts looked over there from time to time, their eyes revealing desire and fervor.

“Is this an innate spiritual treasure unearthed, or is it the birth of a divine herb divine tree at the universe dominator level?”

Wang Xian stared at it intently. His eyes were sparkling.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

At this moment, the Purple Thunder Snake suddenly let out a roar. Its body coiled slightly together.

“Roar Roar!”

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

The Thunder Male Ape and the Thunder Cloud Vulture stared at it in fear. They didn’t want to be outdone and let out a low roar.

“Eh? That purple lightning snake is very strong. No, the Lightning Horn on its head is not a growth. It is a terrifying treasure!”

Wang Xian’s gaze landed on the purple lightning snake as well. His eyes were filled with astonishment!
