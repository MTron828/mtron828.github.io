“There is a huge benefit to joining our demon Hunter College. In the library of our Demon Hunter College, there is a database. In the database, you can see all the information about the students and instructors of the college doing missions around East Sea city

“Some of the landforms and some things to take note of can be seen in the information. You should know that this is the accumulation of our demon Hunter College over a thousand years

“In addition, you can also record the information in the library. Once the feedback results are correct, you will be rewarded with points!”

Teacher Yuan brought everyone from class three to the Academy’s Library and introduced them.

Wang Xian looked at the huge library. There were at least a few million books in it.

This was the main reason why he came to the Demon Hunter College in the first place.

In the Demon Hunter College, one could obtain information that other mercenary groups could not. There were many valuable materials.

For the students of the Demon Hunter College, if one wanted to check the information here, they would need to exchange them with points.

Following that, teacher Yuan brought them to the treasure vault of the Demon Hunter College.

The Treasure Vault of the Demon Hunter College contained many treasures. These treasures could be exchanged with a large number of points. Secondly, they could be exchanged with treasures.

Wang Xian looked at a portion of the items closely and was extremely surprised.

There were even fire spirit pearls of extraordinary level five. The other types of armor and weapons were in a terrifying amount.

According to teacher Yuan’s introduction, the library of the Demon Hunters Academy’s Treasure Vault was extremely valuable in the entire eastern sea city.

Even the Eastern Sea Academy and the ocean academy could not compare to it.

Many large mercenary groups in eastern sea city used their money to buy information about the demon Hunters Academy.

Moreover, this information was sold at a very high price. There were also some information that wasn’t for sale and could only be exchanged by the students of the Demon Hunters Academy.

After touring around with teacher Yuan, Wang Xian felt that joining the demon Hunters Academy was a wise choice.

“Tomorrow, your teacher Ma will introduce some things to you and teach you practical combat. When the time comes, there will be a class-to-class competition. Come on time!”

Around five in the afternoon, teacher Yuan waved to everyone and said his final words.

Everyone nodded and left immediately.

The students of the Demon Hunters Academy had their own rooms. Each of them had a room. The room was not big, but it was pretty good.

“Actual combat?”

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly and walked straight to the back of the academy.

“That’s the guy who provoked the young master’s mercenary group Yesterday!”

“This guy is doomed!”

“Of course. I asked around today and found out that the young master’s mercenary group is very famous in the demon Hunters Academy. There was once an extraordinary level five senior who was punished by the young master’s mercenary group and apologized!”

As he walked towards the attribute training tower, he heard the discussions around him. There were even some people who were considering whether they should go over and spar with him.

Wang Xian was also aware of the rules of sparring among the students in the Demon Hunters Academy. When he heard their conversation, he frowned slightly and revealed an unhappy expression.

He frowned slightly and ignored them. He went into the attribute training tower, took out a token given to him by Dean Xia, and entered the training room directly.

The training room was not big. It was only three to four square meters in size. There was a seat in the middle.

Wang Xian sat cross-legged in the fire attribute training tower and immediately began to absorb the dense fire attribute around him.

The speed of my cultivation is slightly slower than the Dragon Palace’s, but it’s not bad

When waves of spiritual energy surged into his body, Wang Xian thought to himself. He immediately closed his eyes and focused on his cultivation.

The time for cultivation passed very quickly. When he opened his eyes, it was already the afternoon of the second day.

When he arrived at Class Three’s learning field, he realized that there was no one inside.

Wang Xian thought for a moment and returned to his residence.

“Dragon King!”

Upon seeing Wang Xian, ao Jian immediately walked over. “Dragon King, the group of Drakonids will be back tomorrow morning!”

“Oh? The dragon Spike has been taken care of?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and walked over with a smile on his face.

“Yes. According to Long Yi’s report, all three towns have been dealt with!”

Ao Jian replied.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded.

“Dragon King!”

The next morning, the group of DRAKONIDS rushed over.

“Has everything been arranged?”

Wang Xian asked them directly.

“Dragon King, everything has been arranged. Lord ao Yao and the rest are currently on an assassination mission. They should be back in three days!”

Long Yi nodded his head. “In addition, the spies in Qiao Lin Town, Shenghai Town, and the other three towns will send us a message through the mother-child communication stone plate once there is a mission!”

“We can receive it directly in Donghai City and have Lord Ao Yao and the rest carry out the mission in the five towns in front of them!”

“With Donghai City as the main base, we will radiate the five towns in the vicinity!”

Wang Xian nodded slightly. The communication stone tablet of his mother and son did not have a distance limit. It was a long-distance communication device.

“Alright. Currently, there are not many strange demons. When there are more in the future, it will be much more convenient!”

Wang Xian knocked on the table gently. “In the next few days, all of you will develop the spies in the East Sea city. Each district will develop ten spies!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The group of DRAKONIDS nodded respectfully.

Wang Xian stood up and said, “After Ao Yao and the rest arrive, we will start to complete the missions. We will work hard to raise the level of the mercenary group, earn Spirit Stones, and increase our strength!”

“Let’s go to the Demon Hunters Academy. It has been almost three days since the start of the semester, and we haven’t even stayed for a day!”

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment, smiled, and walked into the Demon Hunters Academy.

“Are you going to the arena to watch the competition of the new students? I heard that the strongest among the new students will be selected today!”

“This is boring. They are all a bunch of rookies. The strongest one is only at level three of the supernatural realm!”

“Aren’t you at level three of the supernatural realm as well? Let’s go and take a look. There might be some strong talents in this batch!”

Wang Xian entered the academy. Before he reached class three, he heard the conversation between two young men beside him.

“Freshmen competition?”

He was stunned. “No wonder there was no one in the learning field yesterday. It turns out that the freshmen competition.”

Wang Xian looked in the direction where the two young men went and followed behind them.

There was a huge competition venue in the Demon Hunters Academy. Even if all the students were present, it would be able to fit all of them.

When Wang Xian arrived at the entrance of the competition venue, he heard cheers coming from inside.

He walked in and what he saw was a slightly skinny young man standing on the stage. He raised both of his hands in excitement!

Wang Xian walked in and realized that the instructor inside was walking out instead.

“Is it over?”

Wang Xian was slightly surprised.

“Qin Shan’s strength is simply too strong. He defeated Gao Meng within ten moves. He is almost invincible among those at transcendent level three!”

“He is indeed very strong. He didn’t even use his supernatural ability. How Awesome!”
