Chapter 1403: The trial of 1403 was about to begin

“Gulp!”

In the weapons district of Xiaoyao City, everyone couldn’t help but swallow a mouthful of saliva.

All the aristocratic families and experts in Xiaoyao city stared at these 300 insightful emptiness realm experts with wide eyes.

Especially the members of the gilded gold family. The eldest sister and second brother of the gilded gold family stared blankly at the powerful experts, their bodies trembling.

These people were actually the brothers of the Fire Hammer clan..

The future of the Fire Hammer clan was simply unimaginable!

“You... What faction are you from?”

At this moment, the young city Lord had the ugliest expression!

He had just finished his trial and decided to execute everyone from the dragon-phoenix dynasty and the Fire Hammer clan.

In the end, such a terrifying group of insightful emptiness realm experts came.

Three hundred, a total of three hundred.

Facing such a terrifying force, the entire Xiaoyao City was nothing.

“The force that killed you!”

Ao qitian stared at the young city Lord with a face full of rage and said coldly.

His gaze swept over everyone in Xiaoyao City, and his expression revealed a ghastly expression.

“You...”

The young city Lord’s expression changed slightly, and everyone around him also revealed ugly expressions.

“If I’m not wrong, everyone here should be the force that destroyed the one leaf continent Empire and the Sky Island Empire. Is it the Dragon Palace?”

At this moment, the city lord of Xiaoyao City, who was floating in the sky, swept his gaze across all the members of the Dragon Palace.

After sensing their strength, his gaze finally landed on Wang Xian. His expression became calm.

“Oh? You are quite well-informed, mayor Xiao Yao!”

Wang Xian looked at the mayor of Xiao Yao who was in the sky and revealed a smile.

“What? It’s the one leaf continent Empire and the sky island empire that they destroyed!”

“No wonder. No wonder two such powerful empires were destroyed in such a short period of time. Is this the true strength of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire? It’s too terrifying!”

“Even the top dynasties around the human-demon graveyard are only so-so. However, we still have the mayor of Xiaoyao City. We are not afraid of them, not afraid of them!”

Some people were shocked when they heard the mayor of Xiaoyao City’s words. Then, they comforted themselves in a low voice.

“I’ve heard so much about you. I didn’t expect to see such a powerful force in our area!”

The mayor of Xiaoyao City glanced at all the members of the dragon palace and said, “In that case, let’s call it a day!”

Call it a day?

When the mayor of Xiaoyao City said this, everyone held their breaths and stared at Wang Xian.

If they were to really fight, even if the mayor of Xiaoyao city was here, it would definitely be a huge battle.

The opponent had too many insightful void martial artists. They were so many that they were ganging up on the mayor of Xiaoyao City. Even the mayor of Xiaoyao city had to be careful in dealing with them.

“Haha, That’s it? Mayor of Xiaoyao City, where did all your arrogance go? Didn’t you want to destroy the Dragon and Phoenix Empire?”

Wang Xian stared at the mayor of Xiaoyao City with a cold smile.

“Oh? What do you want?” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The mayor of Xiaoyao City looked at Wang Xian without any fluctuation on his face.

“I want to be like all of you!”

Wang Xian smiled. “A trial? Interesting!”

Wang Xian glanced at the young castellan and everyone around him.

“Young castellan, if you want to kill me and extinguish the fire hammer clan, you will be sentenced to death!”

“In the surrounding Xiaoyao City, all the clans and powerhouses who came to besiege us will die!”

“Those seven or eight dynasty forces who wanted to destroy the dragon and Phoenix Empire will be annihilated!”

“This is also my final judgment on all of you!”

A cold voice resounded throughout the entire Xiaoyao city. His voice was filled with dominance!

Since all of you want to judge us, fine, I will judge all of You Now!

“What?”

Wang Xian’s judgment made everyone around him look extremely embarrassed.

Especially those seven or eight dynasties who had just said that they wanted to destroy the dragon and Phoenix Empire. Each and every one of them had a look of fear on their faces.

Their foreheads were filled with cold sweat and fear.

The families and experts in Xiaoyao City were also looking at the mayor of Xiaoyao City in the sky with fear on their faces.

The young mayor’s face was even paler. He looked at his father with an extremely embarrassed expression.

He would never have thought that things would turn out like this!

“Do you really think that our Xiaoyao City will be afraid of You? I will be afraid of You!”

At this moment, the mayor of Xiaoyao City, who was floating in the sky, still had a calm expression on his face. He stared at Wang Xian indifferently.

“Then, do you really think that I will be afraid of Your Xiaoyao City?”

Wang Xian stared at the mayor of Xiaoyao City and asked in return.

A terrifying atmosphere was gathering in their midst.

Everyone around them was staring at him intently.

At this moment, there was no room for others to speak.

At this moment, the two of them decided the fate of everyone.

“Haha, Our Xiaoyao Mountain covers an area of 100,000 kilometers. Xiaoyao city has stood tall for more than 100 years. Have we ever been afraid of anyone?”

“I gave you a chance, but you didn’t cherish it. Do you really think I’m afraid of You?”

“The moment the Xiaoyao order is given, the order is as big as a mountain. The trial continues!”

The mayor of Xiaoyao City suddenly laughed maniacally, and his body emitted an incomparably terrifying aura.

His entire body’s clothes fluttered without the wind, and the two large words carefree on it seemed to come to life.

The Wind Rose, and the clouds surged!

Incomparably tyrannical!

“Hiss, this... the city lord is so powerful and confident!”

“Is this the demeanor of an expert? Even when facing three hundred insightful emptiness realm experts, he still doesn’t put them in his eyes!”

Some people saw the carefree city lord’s confident expression, and their hearts were moved, and they had a trace of confidence.

“Haha, So What If we have 300 void interpretation? We have the city lord, the most powerful city lord. Are We Afraid of them?”

“Kill, Haha, the City Lord is invincible. Even if the opponent has 300 void interpretation, we can still fight!”

A few void interpretation experts in Xiao Yao City roared, and their faces were filled with fighting spirit.

“Fight, fight, Fight!”

The aristocratic families and experts in Xiao Yao city gritted their teeth and roared.

At this point, there was no way out!

“Our Jinliang dynasty is willing to fight for the mayor of Xiaoyao City!”

“We are also willing!”

“Including our nine Heavens Dynasty!”

“Fight!”

...

The few dynasties that said they wanted to destroy the dragon-phoenix dynasty also gritted their teeth and echoed loudly.

Now, they were on the same side as Xiaoyao city when they faced Wang Xian’s might and the 300 insightful void stage powerhouses.

Once Xiao Yao city was defeated, their dynasty would suffer revenge. With the terrifying strength of the 300 insightful emptiness realm experts, their dynasty would be easily destroyed.

Now, there was only one way to fight with the mayor of Xiao Yao City!

“Haha, Alright, Alright. Since your trial continues, my trial will continue as well. I want to see who will be the one to judge who!”

Wang Xian laughed out loud.

The aura of all the members of the Dragon Palace began to gather around them. A great battle was about to break out!

“Hehe, so what if there are 300 void interpretation experts? You guys are not qualified for me to make a move!”

“Today, Xiaoyao City will be your graveyard!”

“Those who offend our Xiaoyao city will be executed even if they are far away!”

The mayor of Xiaoyao City looked down and revealed an extremely arrogant expression.

His words stunned everyone in Xiaoyao City.

“Haha, City Lord, leave it to me. Ever since I broke through, I haven’t had a good fight!”

A loud laughter came from the sky, shaking everyone’s minds!

At the same time, the entire sky seemed to collapse.

The sound of waves roaring came from the sky, and the entire sky turned azure blue!

The terrifying aura was almost comparable to the forces of the Xiaoyao City Lord!

It descended like divine might! !
