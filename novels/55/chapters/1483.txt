Chapter 1484: 1484 was here, no one dared to reject me

“Aiya, beauty, don’t look at my sculptures as ordinary. You have to see their inner nature. Look at them, they are so lifelike and beautiful!”

“Look at how cute these sculptures are. Even though you are like a fairy from heaven, you are still a match for me.”

Seeing a group of women with extraordinary statuses walking over, Dui Dazhuang’s eyes lit up as he hurriedly introduced them.

“Oh, no. Although they are not bad, they are too ordinary!”

“Little Fatty Bro, do you have anything more exquisite here?”

The forest fairy princess shook her head and asked Dui Dazhuang.

Little Fatty Bro?

Dui Dazhuang’s face turned black when he heard Dui Dazhuang address him.

“This, all the sculptures are here. Mine is already very exquisite. Look at the color, the expression, the eyes...”

Dui Mu Dazhuang continued to introduce the sculptures.

“Although the sculptures are not bad, the materials are a little bad!”

“If you are an expert, you don’t need to learn how to sculpt to be able to create sculptures that are even more exquisite than this!”

“If you want to give it to young master he, the grade is definitely not high enough!”

The girls at the back looked at the sculpture and whispered.

The forest fairy princess shook her head slowly with disappointment in her eyes.

“Cousin Qinglian, I know that the young man in the Fatty’s room is a master sculptor. The objects he is sculpting are several grades higher than this fatty!”

At the back, Yuan Xun er hesitated for a moment. She looked at Wang Xian who was in the room and whispered to the woman beside her.

“Huh? Xun Er, how did you know?”

The woman was slightly stunned and looked at Yuan Xun Er in astonishment.

“That fatty is from the same city as me. I have seen that young man carving things with my own eyes!”

“But, but...”

“But what’s the matter?”

Yuan Xun er said with some hesitation. The woman at the side quickly asked.

“But that young man’s temper is a little strange. When I asked him to help me carve, he ignored me. His attitude was very bad!”

Yuan Xun er said with some dissatisfaction in her heart.

“Oh Really? This is not a matter. If Princess Lin Yaoyao asked that young man to carve, it would be his honor. Why would he refuse!”

The woman smiled and shook her head. She did not take these words to heart at all.

“That’s true!”

Yuan Xun er nodded.

That young man was obviously here to join young master he’s army.

Now that the Princess of the Forest Yaoyao clan asked him to carve, it was a blessing for him.

“Princess Yaoyao!”

At this time, Yuan Xun er’s cousin saw that Princess Lin Yaoyao was about to leave. She quickly walked over and greeted respectfully.

“Yes, Qinglian, what’s the matter?”

Lin Yaoyao looked at the woman and asked curiously.

“Princess Yaoyao, as far as I know, the young man in the fatty’s shop is very good at carving. He is much better than that fatty. Why don’t...”

The woman probed Princess Lin Yaoyao.

“Oh, really?”

Lin Yaoyao looked over and looked at Wang Xian who was in the shop. Then, she took two steps forward.

“Eh?”

At this moment, she saw a few sculptures placed on the table beside Wang Xian.

The sculptures were emitting a green glow. When the young man moved, the sculptures actually moved!

This made her face reveal surprise and love.

He Feng who was at the side also looked over curiously.

“Little Fatty, please call the young man in your shop over. I want to ask him to carve a sculpture!”

Lin Yaoyao smiled at DUI Dazhuang as she stared at Wang Xian.

“Oh? You want brother Wang Xian to carve a statue?”

Dui Dazhuang was stunned for a moment before a troubled expression appeared on his face. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“I’ll go and ask!”

Dui Dazhuang knew Wang Xian’s temper. He was a little cold and indifferent, as though he didn’t care about anything.

To be honest, even a man like him felt that he was a little handsome.

However, this group of people in front of him was from the forest goblins. The rest of them also seemed to have extraordinary statuses. It wouldn’t be good to offend them.

As he spoke, he immediately entered the room.

“Brother Wang Xian, there’s a big business deal. I’ll talk to you about it. It can definitely...”

“I heard what you said outside. I’m not doing it!”

Dui Dazhuang was interrupted by Wang Xian as he spoke. This caused his face to turn stiff!

He looked at the tea on Wang Xian’s table that was worth millions of middle-grade spirit stones and shook his head.

“Hehe, this beauty, I’m really sorry. This brother of mine doesn’t carve things for outsiders!”

Dui Dazhuang walked out and said to Lin Yaoyao with a smile on his face.

“HMM? You Don’t want to carve? Tell me, how many Spirit Stones do you want?”

Lin Yaoyao was slightly stunned and asked directly.

“This... This is not a problem of spirit stones!”

Dui Dazhuang shook his head in embarrassment.

“Ten million middle-grade spirit stones!”

Lin Yaoyao said directly.

Dui Dazhuang’s eyes lit up when he heard this number. He turned his head to look at Wang Xian in the room and shook his head bitterly.

“It’s really not a problem of spirit stones!”

“One hundred million middle-grade spirit stones!”

Lin Yaoyao continued.

Dui Dazhuang turned around and looked at Wang Xian in a daze.

“500 million middle-grade spirit stones!”

Lin Yaoyao also stared at Wang Xian. She raised her head slightly and said.

“No matter how much it is, I won’t sculpt it!”

Wang Xian immediately rejected her.

“Huh?”

Lin Yaoyao frowned when she heard his unwavering rejection.

“Young master, it’s your good fortune that our Princess Lin Yaoyao asked you to sculpt something!”

Yuan Xun er’s cousin walked over and said directly with a frown.

“Yes, Our Princess Lin Yaoyao asked you to sculpt and you refused?”

“Young master has a personality, but our Princess Yaoyao asked you to sculpt, so don’t be disrespectful!”

The group of girls behind Lin Yaoyao spoke, and they directly revealed Lin Yaoyao’s identity.

In the entire he clan’s forest, the position of the Princess of the Forest Yaoyao clan was only lower than two or three young masters of the He clan.

Lin Yaoyao did not speak. She stared at Wang Xian indifferently.

“You don’t know how to sculpt!”

However, what surprised everyone was that Wang Xian’s cold voice came directly without any hesitation.

This caused Lin Yaoyao’s expression to change slightly. Her face was filled with displeasure.

When Dui Dazhuang, who was standing at the side, heard the girls’words and Wang Xian’s rejection, his body trembled.

“What the F * ck!”

His fat body hurriedly ran to Wang Xian’s side.

“My big brother, that’s the princess of the forest goblins. Big Brother, do you know the status of the Forest Goblins’Princess? She’s an awesome person who’s only slightly inferior to young master he!”

“500 million middle-grade spirit stones. We agree, we agree!”

Dui Dazhuang lowered his voice and reminded Wang Xian in a low voice.

“No!”

Wang Xian shook his head. With his current strength, what he didn’t want wouldn’t be changed by some weaklings. It was obviously impossible.

Dui Dazhuang’s face turned black.

“Ahem, Your Highness, I’m sorry. My shop is closed today. It’s closed!”

He walked out with a smile on his face as he braced himself and said.

The last thing he wanted had happened.

“HMPH, do you really think you are so great? I’ll Smash Your Shop in the future!”

Lin Yaoyao’s temper flared up when she heard his words. She said angrily and turned around to leave.

“Wait!”

At this moment, he feng who was standing at the side extended his hand to block Lin Yaoyao who was about to leave angrily.

He looked ahead and stared at Wang Xian who was inside.

“I am He Feng. Please carve an item for Princess Yaoyao!”

He Feng said proudly.

“He... He Feng... cough, cough, cough!”

When Lone Wood Dazhuang heard this name, he was so excited that his face turned red. He coughed violently twice.

“Huh?”

However, Wang Xian did not respond at all.

This caused he Feng’s expression to turn cold.

“I repeat, I am He Feng. I order you to carve an item for Princess Yaoyao!”

“No one dares to reject me here!”

His voice turned colder and colder!
