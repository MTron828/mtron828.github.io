3781 3780 Dragon King Must Die!

“If there is no need in the future, do not provoke the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!”

After the group of peak races saw the message from Wang Xian, their experts gave an order.

Unless it was absolutely necessary, do not provoke the Dragon Palace.

Firstly, in their opinion, the potential of the Dragon King was too great, and the speed of his improvement was too monstrous.

According to their experts’guesses, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace should have obtained the top-tier inheritance of the Divine Dragon Clan.

It was even possible that he had obtained the inheritances of several former top-tier Dragon Kings.

One had to know that the peak Divine Dragon Clan had several top-tier existences back then.

Not to mention the Water Dragon King.

The Five Elements Dragon King and the light-dark Dragon King were the few experts among the peak races.

The Dragon Palace Dragon King must have obtained an incredible inheritance. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be so strong.

Under the current circumstances, if he could avoid provoking the dragon palace, he wouldn’t.

After all, the Angel clan and the Phoenix clan had learned a bloody lesson.

“I really didn’t expect the Dragon Palace Dragon King to have grown to such a level!”

The experts from the Elf clan were slightly shocked when they saw the news.

“When I first met the Dragon King, he was still far away from the universe ruler realm. I didn’t expect that he could easily kill a level 6 universe ruler now. I’ve only broken through to the level 2 universe ruler realm now.”

Life Sound Arrow said to the great elves with a slight sigh and slowly shook his head.

“The Dragon King has sent these battle results to the communication stone plate. I reckon that the two peak races are going to be completely enraged. They should be using their true strength now, or they might even join forces.”

A great elf said.

“Since the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace dares to send them out, he must have some trump cards. He’s not afraid of the angel and Phoenix clans. TSK TSK, I really don’t know how far the Dragon King can push the angel and Phoenix clans!”

Another great elf shook his head with a smile on his face.

“Hu hu Hu!”

“This Dragon King deserves to die!”

At the same time, the angels and phoenixes were filled with anger compared to the shock and excitement of the other peak races.

The third Prince looked at the information on the communication stone plate and his aura exploded. His expression was ferocious!

The losses of the Angel clan were too heavy!

Not only in their territory in the Aurora Domain, but also in other places.

These corpses seemed to be slapping him in the face!

Ever since he dealt with the Dragon King, nothing had gone smoothly!

In order to deal with the Dragon Palace, he had sacrificed all the subsidiary races of the Angel Clan.

In order to deal with the Dragon King, he had used up a lot of resources.

Now, the entire Angel race had suffered a lot of losses.

There were more than 300 experts of the angel race!

This responsibility lay with him.

“Third prince, the elders want you to go to the exit of the universe passage and talk… Talk about destroying the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.”

At this moment, an angel from the side said to the third prince.

“I know!”

The third Prince’s face darkened as he took a deep breath. He got up and headed directly to the location of the nine-origin universe and the universe passage.

He flew in the void and contacted the Green River Water Phoenix.

This time, the Green River Water Phoenix was also in a difficult situation.

The angel race didn’t only have the angels of light.

The Phoenix clan didn’t only have the Water Phoenix clan.

They had to bear the consequences of this incident!

The Green River Water Phoenix also received information from the clan.

The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace had sent such a message on the communication stone plate. This was a blatant provocation!

If they still couldn’t destroy the Dragon Palace.

Then their two peak races would be greatly humiliated!

Now, the Dragon Palace had to be destroyed, and they had to do it as quickly as possible.

The two peak races couldn’t afford to lose face.

Ten years later, the third prince and the Green River Water Phoenix appeared at the entrance of the world passageway.

A group of disciples from the Angel Race and Phoenix race gathered around them.

At a glance, there were at least dozens of universe overlords at level seven and above.

“Third Prince!”

The third Prince flew over. A dark angel of the Angel clan looked at him and shouted faintly!

“Elder!”

The third prince bowed and cupped his hands.

He didn’t dare to be disrespectful to the elder, and it was the elder of the Dark Angel clan.

His identity wasn’t of much use to the elder of the Dark Angel clan.

“Tell me, what’s going on with the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace? Don’t hide anything!”

The elder of the Dark Angel asked faintly.

When the third prince heard that, his expression instantly turned ugly.

The surrounding angels stared at him, and the atmosphere was somewhat solemn.

“Some of our clansmen can’t die without knowing why. If the third prince doesn’t say anything, then we’ll follow the rules of the Angel Clan!”

The elder of the Dark Angel looked at him and continued to speak calmly.

“Elder, the Green River Phoenix of the Phoenix clan and I have discovered that if we can find nine universe ruler-level divine dragons with nine attributes, we might be able to open the treasures of the Divine Dragon Island.”

The third prince immediately said.

His expression was extremely ugly.

At this time, he didn’t dare to hide anything.

If he still didn’t say something, he wouldn’t be able to bear the punishment of the Angel clan.

He would become a puppet-like battle angel.

“Oh?”

The elder of the Dark Angel raised his eyebrows, and a surprised expression appeared on his face, he looked at the third prince and said, “This matter was provoked by you, third prince, so you have to solve it yourself. You can use the seventh level ruler of the Angel clan, and take this.”

As he spoke, a strange bell flew to the third prince.

The outside of the clock was made of light dragon scales, while the inside of the clock had a black needle that looked like the bones of a divine dragon.

The entire clock emitted a strange and mysterious energy.

“Dragon-finger clock.”

When the third prince saw it, his eyebrows jumped and he immediately put it away.

This was a very powerful treasure that also had a mysterious effect.

“Within 100,000 years, you must destroy the Dragon King. Otherwise, third prince, you will still be punished!”

The elder of the Dark Angel continued.

“Yes, Elder. Within 100,000 years, I will definitely destroy the Dragon King. I only need five angels who are masters of the seventh level to follow me.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

As the third prince spoke, his gaze swept towards the Phoenix clan. “At that time, I will join forces with the Phoenix clan’s Green River Water Phoenix.”

“Alright.”

The elder of the Dark Angel nodded.

Soon, the Green River Water Phoenix from the Phoenix tribe looked at the third Prince with a frown.

Both of their expressions were unsightly, and they had also received orders.

The Dragon King Must Die!
