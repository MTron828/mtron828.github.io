3313 3312 Lich Kingdom’s revenge

“The five insects city is right ahead!”

Wang Xian flew for another two days in the heaven-splitting chaotic land. A city appeared in his line of sight, and his eyes were sparkling.

At this moment, his body had undergone a transformation. There were a pair of horns on his head, and his face was covered by red dragon scales.

His entire body was also covered by dragon scales, making him look like a drakonid.

This form did not seem out of the ordinary in the five bug city. In fact, it was somewhat similar to the liches in the five bug city.

In the five bug city, many liches had all sorts of scales, tentacles, and the like.

Furthermore, the grotto-heaven blessed land in the five bug city was able to give birth to a special type of beetle. This type of beetle had an extremely tough carapace.

When Wang Xian entered the city, he did not immediately fly towards the grotto-heaven blessed land in the five bug city. He did not make a move immediately either.

When he attacked the scorpion imperial city, he was completely caught off guard.

The Lich Kingdom never expected that Wang Xian would destroy their city.

Under such circumstances, he easily succeeded.

However, after he was on guard, the other cities were definitely on guard.

For example, he would set up more secret formations. Once something happened to the city, a large number of experts could be teleported over directly.

Therefore, it was best for Wang Xian to be fully prepared for this attack.

“Hurry up, hurry up. Once you enter the city, it will be forbidden to leave the city. The five insects city will enter a state of Alert!”

When Wang Xian arrived at the city gate, a voice came from the front.

“Eh? The city has been sealed?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly and continued walking inside.

With his current appearance, even if the Lich King was here, it would be difficult for him to recognize him without making a move.

“The scorpion imperial city was destroyed. It was the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace who did it.”

“Huh? Dragon King of the Dragon Palace? The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace who surrounded Lu Xingkong? Did he eat a bear’s heart or a leopard’s guts? How dare he provoke Our Lich Kingdom!”

“A force that surrounded Lu Xingkong actually dared to attack us. He’s courting death. Destroy their Dragon Palace!”

As they walked in, the discussion of the liches could be heard from the surroundings.

There were many people here and all kinds of information could be obtained from this place.

Furthermore, he sent a message to Ba Qi and the rest to ask about the situation.

Under such circumstances, the poisonous horned dragon species could do more things.

For example, the poisonous horned dragon species could obtain the plans of the Lich Kingdom by lodging some of the experts in the five insect city.

This way, it would be much easier to start a fight.

Wang Xian sat in the Beast Colosseum of the Lich Kingdom and watched the two void God emperor level desolate beasts fighting in front of him.

Some of the surrounding liches were cheering.

However, at this moment, at the edge of the heaven opening primal continent, more than a thousand figures were standing on a lich that had countless legs and was flying rapidly like a centipede.

Heaven-devouring centipede!

This was the famous heaven-devouring centipede of the Lich Kingdom, and it was also a powerful lich.

This heaven-devouring centipede was the Mount of the Lich King.

Only when war broke out would the lich king ride on the heaven-devouring centipede to battle.

The heaven-devouring centipede was very fast, traveling a light-year distance in a flash.

They flew out of the heaven-opening desolation continent, toward the interior of the surrounding starry sky, and toward the nest of the ancient sea race.

While the main cities of the Lich Kingdom were defending, the Lich King had already led over a thousand experts and flew towards the Dragon Palace.

Since the Dragon Palace dared to attack them, they had to destroy the Dragon Palace as well.

As the Dragon Palace was the one who made the first move, they didn’t violate the rules.

Time flew by quickly. Wang Xian was temporarily staying in a lair in the five insect city.

An lie, Mo Sha, and three poisonous horned dragons stood respectfully in front of him.

“Dragon King, it will take another seven days for eight Qi to make a breakthrough. However, in five bug city, I and my three subordinates are more than enough!”

Mo Sha said to Wang Xian confidently.

Mo Sha had the combat strength of a universe knight at level seven. Beside him were three poisonous horned dragons with the combat strength of a universe knight at level six.

Ba Qi was used to increase Wang Xian’s strength after he started to destroy the scorpion imperial city.

However, he still needed seven more days to break through.

“Alright, be careful. Currently, the entire Lich Kingdom is in a state of alert. There might be a level 8 universe knight guarding this place.”

Wang Xian reminded them.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Mo Sha and the rest nodded. Then, they moved and disappeared quickly.

An Lie, who was at the side, also moved and disappeared slowly.

Wang Xian sat in the room and made a cup of tea. He was waiting for the news with a smile on his face.

“HMM?”

At this moment, he received a message from Prime Minister Gui. When he saw this message, he narrowed his eyes slightly.

“Is he taking revenge now?”

He murmured.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

At this moment, in the territory of the ancient sea race, a huge sky-devouring centipede was flying forward rapidly.

“Lord Lich King, the power of the Dragon Palace is in front of us!”

A subordinate reported to the Lich King with the Demon Dragon’s head.

“All the experts of the Lich Kingdom, get ready. As long as you are a disciple of the Dragon Palace, kill anyone you see!”

The Lich King roared with a grim expression.

“Yes!”

The other experts of the Lich Kingdom roared with grim expressions.

They stared at the spot in front of them with cold eyes.

It had been a month since the Dragon Palace had destroyed the ancient sea race and the righteous God race.

Although the treasures of the righteous God race had been taken away by the experts of the Lich Kingdom, the prestige of the Dragon Palace had been damaged.

However, the position of the Dragon Palace in the surrounding Lu Xingkong was still at the Overlord level.

After the Dragon Palace came to the ancient sea race, a large number of forces in the surrounding Lu Xingkong came to visit every day.

Even those forces that were far away also came to send gifts.

After all, the strength that the Dragon Palace had displayed made all the forces in the surrounding Lu Xingkong extremely fearful.

They had sent the congratulatory gifts to give the Dragon Palace a good impression. If any reckless disciples offended the dragon palace, there was still room for maneuver.

Today, more than a dozen forces from the ocean, the main planet of the Ancient Sea Race, also came to visit the Dragon Palace.

“It’s a pity that we didn’t see the Dragon King. However, the Dragon Palace is indeed as the other forces said. They are quite kind and not too strong!”

“That’s right, be it the Dragon Queen or the powerful warriors of the Dragon Palace, they are all quite friendly. This is also good news for us!”

“The Dragon King’s strength should have reached universe Knight Level 8 right? I wonder when the Dragon Palace will start the landing battle!”

In the sky above the Dragon Palace, more than 10 powers and over 1,000 powerful warriors came out from the Dragon Palace.

They were all smiling. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Boom

All of a sudden, a terrifying power rushed over, making all of them feel breathless and pale.

“What’s going on?”
