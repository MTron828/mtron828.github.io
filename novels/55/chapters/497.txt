Chapter 498: All Of You Are Courting Death

“What is she talking about?” Adjaya frowned and asked Wang Xian upon seeing that flirtatious woman scrutinizing her from top to bottom.

“She’s saying she’s going to skin you, preserve you and use your bones to build her first bone puppet!” Wang Xian smiled and translated for Adjaya.

Adjaya had inherited the Fire God’s legacy and reached the Budding Realm. Yet, a brat that hadn’t even reached the Inborn Realm was talking about killing her, removing her skin and building a bone puppet with her bones.

That was truly courting her own demise!

“What?”

Adjaya raised an eyebrow and looked at the flirtatious woman before her in shock.

Argh!

At this moment, screams of desperation resounded from behind Wang Xian and Adjaya.

“Haha! Scumbags from the Remains! When you guys entered Shang Jing, we picked up your trails. Ambushing us? How ignorant and stupid are you guys?”

“Today, all ten of you aren’t getting away!”

“Inborn! You are an Inborn expert! Scheming Dongmen Clan!”

“Haha! Nothing is scheming when it comes to dealing with trash like you guys!”

The aura of an Inborn expert shrouded over and wretched cries from disciples of the Remains reverberated. That young man was killing without reservations with the red sword in his hand.

With his Inborn-level strength, it was easy for him to deal with this group of disciples from the Remains who had not reached the Inborn Realm.

“What?”

Hong Niang, who had been scrutinizing Adjaya, was astonished to see five of her companions being killed when she turned around. Fear crept up on her.

“Despicable Dongmen Clan. You guys are as despicable as your Laozu!”

Hong Niang’s expression was hideous at this juncture. As she waved her arms, bloody-red mist shrouded forward.

At the same time, she fled rapidly.

“Thinking of escaping under my eyes?”

The young man with the red sword looked at her in contempt. He lifted his head slightly, flew into the air and lunged with his sword towards Hong Niang.

“F*ck you, Dongmen Clan! All of you will be annihilated by us soon!”

Feeling the terrifying killing intent from behind her, Hong Niang was bitter.

“Die! Wretched beings like you guys that wear our human skin!”

The young man lunged forward with his sword towards the back of Hong Niang.

Argh!

Hong Niang cried pitifully and fell to the ground.

However, a naked figure fled at an even more incredible speed suddenly.

“A cicada casting off its skin? She has discarded her human skin!”

The young man was taken aback. In a cold and harsh tone, he continued, “Do you think you can escape like this?”

Holding the sword in his hand, he swung it rapidly.

The blood red sword drew a trail of blood in the air.

Argh!

A wretched scream resounded. The lips of the young man curved into a smile and showed a satisfied look.

He turned around and noticed that all the other nine corpses of the disciples of Remains were now on the ground.

“Brother Liang, you are too incredible! How did you manage to guess that the disciples of the Remains would ambush us? Haha! They would have never expected us to foresee their actions!”

A young man looked at the corpses on the ground and started flattering the young man with the sword.

“Haha! They are really courting their own deaths to enter our territory and go against us!”

Dongmen Liang lifted his head and smiled. As he waved his arm, the bloody-red sword that he had thrown ahead previously returned to his grip.

“Brother Liang, you have grown stronger once again. That’s the greatest escape technique of the Remains and yet she couldn’t escape from Brother Liang!”

A group of young men gathered over and flattered him.

Dongmen Liang kept his sword behind his back and smiled gently.

From him, one could pick up a superiority vibe.

He looked towards where Wang Xian and Adjaya were and his eyes beamed with excitement.

When Hong Niang from the Remains was approaching them, Dongmen Liang had noticed Adjaya.

Attractive height and figure together with her breathtaking beauty.

With the crown on her head, she resembled a noble goddess.

Moreover, she was a foreigner.

Even though Dongmen Liang had seen many breathtaking beauties, his heart was still set ablaze when he saw Adjaya.

A foreign beauty like her was among the best of the best in the world.

He lifted his head, wore a faint smile and walked directly towards Adjaya.

“Hey, pretty, I’m Dongmen Liang. I hope you aren’t shocked by what happened!” Dongmen Liang said to Adjaya with a face of smiles.

She looked at Wang Xian, baffled, as she couldn’t understand.

Dongmen Liang was also taken aback. Noticing her confused looks, Dongmen Liang repeated it again in English.

Adjaya understood but simply shook her head and looked at Wang Xian.

“Let’s go!”

Mmm!

Adjaya nodded her head with a smile.

Huh?

Dongmen Liang was taken aback and his face quickly flushed red with embarrassment.

The group of young men around him exchanged glances and immediately shouted to Wang Xian, “We saved you guys! Aren’t you two going to repay us before leaving?”

“Oh?”

Wang Xian stopped in his tracks and looked at them with ridicule. “How shall we repay you?”

“Since ancient times, beautiful women would repay heroes who saved them with their bodies. In that case, just let the beautiful woman with you marry our Brother Liang! Haha!” a young man shouted loudly.

The others around him nodded their heads in agreement.

Their words were arrogant and their actions were brazen. They were too full of themselves.

Dongmen Liang raised an eyebrow and didn’t say a word. However, he was scrutinizing Adjaya from top to bottom and revealed a vile smirk.

“He’s giving me dirty looks!” Adjaya turned to Wang Xian and said.

“Their words are dirty and crude too!” Ruthlessness gleamed in the eyes of Wang Xian as he spoke to Adjaya.

“Brat, what the hell are you saying there. Speak something that we can understand. And now... Leave the foreign girl with you behind...”

Looking at their arrogance, Wang Xian shook his head. As he waved his arm, a stream of flames shot towards them.

Huh?

The young man was shocked to see Wang Xian attacking him with flames while he was still speaking.

However, before he could react to it, the flames had fallen on him.

Without any cries, the young man was reduced to dust.

That ball of flames continued to attack the remaining group of young men around. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“What?”

Fear flashed in the eyes of the prideful Dongmen Liang who was standing beside Wang Xian.

“YOU...”

“Why are all of you so eager to die!?” Wang Xian looked at Dongmen Liang with contempt. He waved his arm again and flames flew towards him.

“How is this possible?”

The young man was terrified. He released his aura and blasted it towards the flames.

Bam!

However, the flames weren’t affected at all and fell on him.

Boom!

Argh!

Dongmen Liang’s eyes widened and were filled with desolation and disbelief.

“I’m from the Dongmen Clan. How dare you kill me...? Argh!”

“Let’s go!” Wang Xian looked away in contempt.

Regardless of whether it was the Remains or the Dongmen Sacred Clan, or regardless of whether it was diabolism or the orthodox sects, there would only be one outcome if they offended him.

Death!
