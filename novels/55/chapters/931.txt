Chapter 932: 0933’s strength had greatly increased

Translator: 549690339

“Could it be... could it be that the immortal Phoenix mercenary group had wiped out the experts of the blade scar mercenary group?”

A Cry of surprise sounded from the city wall of Saint Sea Town.

This voice spread throughout the surroundings, causing everyone to be stunned. Then, their eyes widened, and their eyes were filled with disbelief.

However, when they saw the immortal Phoenix mercenary group standing under the city wall, exuding a supreme aura, everyone’s eyes flickered.

Their gazes swept across the fresh blood on the ground, and they couldn’t help but suck in a breath of cold air.

“The blade mark mercenary group has really been destroyed. This... How can the immortal Phoenix mercenary group be so strong? How Strong is that young leader?”

A middle-aged man’s eyes were filled with shock, and he couldn’t help but sigh.

“How Strong is he?”

The surrounding people also muttered.

First, they destroyed the mirage sea mercenary group, and then they destroyed the knife scar mercenary group. In just one day.

If they could destroy the mirage sea mercenary group, it was already shocking to everyone. However, destroying the knife scar mercenary group was shocking to everyone.

The most powerful mercenary group in Holy Sea town was destroyed, which meant that the immortal Phoenix mercenary group would become the leader of the Holy Sea town mercenary group.

They were indeed the king of the mercenary group in Holy Sea Town.

“This mercenary group is not simple!”

Jin Qianyuan looked at Wang Xian and the rest in astonishment.

“Dao Hen’s strength is considered to be at the top among those at transcendent level seven. However, he was still killed. If that young man didn’t conceal his strength, then that young man must have a powerful weapon or array formation!”

The President of the Mercenary Association was also looking at Wang Xian in astonishment.

For a young man to be able to bring out an extraordinary level eight array formation, he might be able to bring out an even more powerful item.

“He’s really powerful!”

Jin Liuyan stood at the side and looked at Wang Xian with sparkling eyes.

At such a young age, he was already standing at the top of the Holy Sea town’s mercenary group. His strength and talent made all the girls tempted.

“He... is he sure that he is a new student who is about to enter the Demon Hunters Academy? With his strength... he can totally be a teacher!”

The long-haired young man beside her swallowed a mouthful of saliva. The expression on his face was very interesting.

He was a student who was about to graduate from the Demon Hunters Academy. He was a transcendent level 4 powerhouse. He was almost 50 years old. Even so, he was still an expert who could be ranked among the top in the Demon Hunters Academy!

However, compared to this new student who had not enrolled in the academy, he was simply trash.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian stood at the foot of the city wall and scanned his surroundings. His body moved and he flew directly towards the city wall.

“Captain Wang!”

Shopkeeper Liu and the woman saw Wang Xian flying over and they welcomed him excitedly.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded at them. His gaze swept across the shocked life and Death Elixir Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop.

“In the future, no mercenary group will dare to threaten others and prohibit the purchase of weapons and elixirs from the weapons workshop of the Immortal Phoenix Elixir Workshop. If they do, they will be going against us!”

Wang Xian said plainly. However, everyone around could hear him clearly.

“It seems like the relationship between the Immortal Phoenix Mercenary Group and Immortal Phoenix is not simple!”

“Even a fool can tell. One is immortal Phoenix, and the other is immortal Phoenix. It seems like it’s impossible for the life and Death Elixir Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop to suppress immortal Phoenix in the future!”

“If they could even destroy the knife scar mercenary group, which mercenary group in the Holy Sea Town would be their match? Who would dare to provoke the Phoenix immortal mercenary group in the future? No one would dare to do so!”

“In the future, the king of the Holy Sea town’s mercenary group would be the Phoenix Immortal mercenary group!”

The people on the city wall could hear Wang Xian’s words as they discussed in hushed voices.

The expressions of the shopkeepers and higher-ups of the life and Death Elixir Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop instantly turned ugly.

They had spent such a huge price to recruit the Mirage Sea mercenary group and the knife marks mercenary group. However, they did not expect that they would be wiped out within a day.

This caused them to suffer heavy losses.

“Tomorrow, all mercenary groups will head to the city guard office to collect the carcass of the ferocious beast. According to the certificate issued by the City Guard office, they will head to the demon hunters mercenary group to collect points and raise the level of the mercenary group!”

At this moment, Jin Qianyuan’s reminder sounded.

Wang Xian took a look outside the city and bade farewell to shopkeeper Liu and the rest before leaving immediately.

“How did the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group destroy the Sword Scar mercenary group? They seem so mysterious!”

“Could it be that leader Wang is a disciple of some big family who came out to train? Otherwise, how could he have such terrifying talent!”

“That’s really possible. He could even take out a transcendent level 8 array formation. Perhaps he has something even more powerful as his life-saving trump card!”

“Even if he doesn’t have any trump cards, this captain Wang is already very terrifying. I wonder if his mercenary group will recruit anyone!”

“This captain Wang is still young and has endless potential. If he can join his mercenary group, he might be able to live a carefree life in the future!”

At the back, the group of mercenary groups were discussing in hushed tones as they looked at Wang Xian and the rest. They were filled with respect as they looked at the figure.

“Today’s harvest is really huge!”

Upon returning to his residence, Wang Xian revealed an excited expression.

Putting aside the corpses of nearly 10,000 ferocious beasts that he would pick up the next day, just the harvest from killing the members of the knife scar mercenary group was already very bountiful.

As the number one mercenary group in Shenghai Town, the resources and spirit stones in the hands of the knife scar mercenary group were definitely not something that an ordinary person could imagine.

Just the middle-grade spirit stones alone were around 10 million. There were also quite a number of elixirs, weapons, and small-scale formations. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Adding all these resources together, they could at least add up to nearly 10,000 dragon crystals.

However, if Wang Xian wanted to level up now, he would need 100,000 dragon crystals, which was a huge expenditure.

At night, Wang Xian had a good night’s rest. The next morning, he walked towards the city guards’office.

When he arrived at the entrance of the city guards, he saw a few hundred people gathered in front of the door. They were waiting at the entrance noisily.

All of them were here to collect the corpses of the ferocious beasts.

“Eh? Leader Wang, Please, Please!”

“Leader Xian Feng is here. The ferocious beasts they killed yesterday were only slightly less than the knife marks mercenary group. They have the most of them among us!”

“Leader of the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group, please go ahead. I wonder if leader Wang is still recruiting members for your mercenary group?”

“After this, the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group should be able to advance to the gold mercenary group!”

As soon as Wang Xian arrived, everyone around him immediately recognized him and greeted him with smiles on their faces.

“Thank you!”

Wang Xian didn’t stand on ceremony. The Strong had the privilege of being strong.

In the current employment group of Shenghai Town, no one was stronger than him!

He walked in from the path that everyone around had cleared. There were dozens of city guards inside.

“Captain Wang, you really went on a killing spree yesterday and shocked the entire Shenghai town. Hehe, there are a total of 10,343 ferocious beasts for you!”

A middle-aged city guard walked over with a smile on his face and handed over more than a dozen interspatial rings to Wang Xian.

There were more than 10,000 ferocious beasts inside!

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile and walked out.
