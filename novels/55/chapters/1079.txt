“Cripple him!”

Everyone’s gaze was focused on Wang Xian. In the end, Wang Xian did not choose to kill him.

If he were to kill him, the consequences would be that the entire ocean cultivator army would come after him immediately. At that time, many of his plans would be disrupted.

Keeping him alive would allow him to completely offend a void interpretation stage powerhouse. However, the other party would not attack him directly.

Especially when they were so far away from each other, this would give him a lot of time.

As long as he settled the matter of the demonic beasts attacking the city and obtained the corpses of the demonic beasts, Wang Xian might not be afraid of an insightful emptiness realm expert.

Therefore, for the sake of his next move, he had to endure it.

If he wanted to kill a cripple in the future, with the strength of the dragon assassin organization, unless he stayed by his father’s side 24 hours a day, he would definitely die.

“Bang!”

After Wang Xian finished his sentence, the Golden Swordfish’s palm landed on Hai Wen’s body again.

“Ah!”

A scream sounded again. Hai Wen, who was grabbed by the golden swordfish, fainted like a puddle of mud.

“Continue with the mission and resolve the crisis in the sea mountain region as soon as possible.”

Wang Xian looked at Hai Wen, who had not fainted, and said to everyone.

The golden swordfish that was holding onto Hai Wen threw it in front of the old man from the Ocean Academy. He caught it quickly.

“Continue, continue!”

“Come, continue with the mission!”

Other than the few instructors from the ocean academy who looked extremely embarrassed, everyone else smiled and shouted loudly.

“Phew, send young master Hai Back!”

A few of the Oceanic Academy’s instructors looked at the unconscious Hai Wen. His entire body had been crippled. Although his father’s strength could cure him, his cultivation could be considered completely crippled.

It would take at least seven to eight years for him to completely recover.

“How satisfying. Damn it, this fellow is simply too arrogant. He’s crippled well. It would be even better if we could kill him!”

“It might be troublesome if we kill Commander Wang. However, it’s interesting to see that guy’s fear from the beginning to the end!”

“The son of the general is amazing. HMPH, he killed four of his teammates and the instructors of the Academy are still protecting him!”

“We can’t let our son go to the Ocean Institute in the future. It’s too trashy. A bunch of students from the Ocean Institute don’t even dare to Fart!”

“Haha, the bunch of cowards from the East Ocean Institute and the Ocean Institute. Our student Wang Xian from the Demon Hunters Institute is the best!”

“Hey, Hey, you guys can’t say that either. After all, this guy is the son of the general. We don’t dare to offend him. However, it’s all thanks to student Wang Xian this time. It’s so satisfying!”

The group proceeded forward. Some of the powerhouses from the Demon Hunters Institute and the Holy Sea Town were chatting excitedly.

When the students from Ocean College and East Ocean College heard this, they were a little unhappy. However, they were all supportive of Hai Wen’s abolition.

In an instant, Wang Xian’s prestige had reached its peak. Even the students from the other two colleges were filled with admiration.

The people from holy sea town were filled with admiration. One by one, they started to talk about Wang Xian.

From the leader of the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group to the domineering attack just now, all of them felt their blood boiling.

“However, I’m afraid that Guy will take revenge on Commander Wang!”

“He should take revenge, but Commander Wang isn’t easy to deal with either. He actually has so many extraordinary level eight experts under him. His strength is also very terrifying!”

Finally, everyone spoke slowly. When they arrived at a mountain peak, they ended their conversation and continued to deal with the hidden dangers of the eight-eyed eel.

“Commander Wang, you have to be more careful in the future!”

On the surface of the sea, the president of the hiring association looked at Wang Xian with admiration and reminded him.

“Don’t Worry!”

Wang Xian smiled. He was extremely vigilant in his heart. If that fellow’s father really came, he would have to hide for a while.

“However, Commander Wang, don’t worry. Currently, the Holy Sea town is in imminent danger. At this time, even the commander of the ocean cultivator corps wouldn’t dare to kill the meritorious officers guarding the city!”

The President of the hiring association said with a smile. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

This time, it was Hai Wen who was at fault first. Moreover, it was during a critical period. If a void interpretation stage powerhouse really dared to attack the meritorious person guarding the city at this time, not to mention his reputation as a Commander.., even the star Moon Kingdom wouldn’t agree.

Wang Xian smiled faintly. He didn’t believe what the President of the hiring association said.

As a void interpretation expert, a top-notch expert in the entire star-moon kingdom, the star-moon kingdom might not hold him accountable if he were to kill someone.

However, he wouldn’t be too worried. Since the person wasn’t dead yet, a void interpretation expert wouldn’t come over.

The operation continued. It was likely that the eight-eyed eel sensed the threat from Wang Xian and the rest. After searching all the mountains and killing 10,000 to 20,000 eight-clawed ferocious beasts, it thoroughly searched the entire sea mountain region.

“It’s about time. Although we didn’t encounter the eight-eyed eel race, they are no longer a threat. Let’s go back!”

The President of the Employment Association of Shenghai town scanned the surroundings and said to Wang Xian.

“Okay, let’s go back!”

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly and shouted softly, “Let’s return to the city!”

“Yes!”

The group of people flew out from the sea and followed behind Wang Xian. They flew directly towards Shenghai town.

“Phew, if we don’t count the four people who were killed, it can be said that none of us died this time!”

“This is all thanks to Commander Wang. On several occasions, he was able to discover stronger ferocious beasts and eight-eyed eels that were lying in ambush in advance!”

“The 11 subordinates under Commander Wang are so strong too. The five to six people who attacked were all at transcendent level eight. It Can’t be that all 11 of them are top-notch experts at transcendent level eight, right?”

On the way back, everyone looked at Wang Xian’s back with respect.

His strong insight and powerful subordinates were simply invincible.

Qian Hu pursed his lips as he listened to the conversations of the experts from the three major academies and the holy sea town.

He, who had always been unconvinced and wanted to win back a city, was utterly terrified.

While he was still thinking of fighting for the leadership position of the Demon Hunters Academy, Wang Xian had already become the leader of the three major academies and the holy sea town.

Furthermore, when he saw that Wang Xian had directly crippled Hai Wen, he immediately shrunk his head.

Damn it, there were so many subordinates of an extraordinary level eight powerhouse. If he was in Hai Wen’s shoes, he might have already died.

Even his father might have been raped.

He couldn’t afford to offend him. He couldn’t afford to offend him at all!

“Qian Hu, come over here and apologize to Wang Xian!”

At this moment, his father’s voice suddenly rang in his ears, causing him to be slightly stunned. Following that, a bitter smile appeared on his face.

He knew that his father had to admit defeat!

Regardless of whether he had offended the captain of the ocean cultivator corps or not, at the very least, Wang Xian wasn’t someone they could afford to offend.

It was better for him to admit defeat and apologize as soon as possible.

Qian Hu didn’t hesitate at all. With a move of his body, he flew directly toward Wang Xian.
