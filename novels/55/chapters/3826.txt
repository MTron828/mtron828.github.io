When the Five Elements Millstone appeared, the gods who believed in the universe did not sense it at all.

According to the compass given to them by the Voodoo clan to probe the gods in the universe, Wang Xian could sense it.

Among them, the strongest one was only at the strength of a level five pantheon.

That was the strength that they had when they were at the level five realm.

With such strength, they could not sense it at the moment of the five elements grinding.

After all, the current five elements grinding was comparable to a level nine pantheon.

Wang Xian stared at the Pantheon who was looking at them mockingly. His eyes were filled with disdain!

“Alright, become my follower. This is the greatest honor for the trash of the nine-origin Universe!”

In front of him, the expert of the gods was still shouting excitedly.

His body shook, and around him, the illusory images of followers appeared. Countless followers chanted around him.

He waved his arm, and faith runes appeared in front of him!

“Boom!”

However, before he could release his attack, the might of the five elements millstone was completely revealed.

When the gods who believed in the universe didn’t react in the slightest.

The Five Elements Millstone had already arrived below the 100 or so gods on the right.

A terrifying might was instantly unleashed!

“What?”

“Not good, what is this thing?”

At this instant, the 100 or so gods who were prepared to watch the show revealed shocked expressions when they saw the five elements millstone suddenly appear below them.

They were all filled with shock and fear!

“Weng!”

In the next moment, a stream of energy enveloped them comfortably.

“Peng, Peng, Peng!”

Their bodies instantly fell towards the five elements millstone and landed heavily on it.

“Ah, ah, ah!”

Following that, miserable cries rang out continuously. As they lay on the five elements millstone, their bodies trembled violently.

There was a sudden change and a sudden scream.

It caused the bodies of the gods who believed in the universe in front of them to completely freeze.

The faith runes in front of him trembled, and he turned his head to look at this scene with a face full of shock.

“Keke Keke, you’re not shouting anymore? You’re not arrogant anymore?”

Ba Qi’s gaze was fixed on the gods who believed in the universe, and his eyes were filled with ridicule.

“Sou!”

The gods who believed in the universe reacted. Their foreheads were instantly filled with cold sweat. They turned around in fear, wanting to flee into the distance.

“Sou!”

However, the moment he flew, he felt the terrifying millstone appear beneath him.

An extremely terrifying attractive force came from below.

He felt as if his internal organs were being crushed, and he fell straight down.

Boom

His body crashed heavily onto the ground as he spat out a large amount of blood.

“How dare you bunch of ants shout so arrogantly!”

Wang Xian looked at them with a cold expression in his eyes.

He stretched out his arm and the five elements Millstone flew towards him.

“No, no, no!”

“Who are you people? How can you be so despicable!”

The severely injured gods of the universe stared at Wang Xian and shouted in fear!

“Soul Catcher!”

Wang Xian ignored them. With a wave of his arm, the level five gods flew in front of him in an instant.

His expression slowly turned dull.

A surge of energy surged into his body and absorbed the information in his mind.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

At this moment, Wang Xian sensed a surge of energy coming from his body to resist it.

This surge of energy contained the will of countless living beings, the blessings, prayers, and sacrifices of countless living beings.

“HMPH!”

Wang Xian snorted softly and erased the power of these beliefs directly. Some information was transmitted into his mind.

After receiving the information, Wang Xian waved his arm and killed him directly.

Whoosh

In the next moment, he started to extract the information one by one again. He only stopped after he had investigated more than a dozen of the strongest pantheon gods!

He clenched his palm lightly and the energy from the five elements millstone came crushing over.

More than a hundred pantheon gods were killed in an instant!

Wang Xian revealed a smile on his face. These bunch of people were courting death.

“Let’s continue moving forward!”

Wang Xian said. Northern Frost swayed his huge body and continued flying forward rapidly.

He closed his eyes and started to check the memories he had just obtained.

A few days later, he opened his eyes and revealed a smile.

Wang Xian had a new understanding of the belief universe.

“From the looks of it, the strength of this belief universe is much, much stronger than the nine-origin Universe!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Wang Xian mumbled.

According to the information he obtained, the belief universe was very strong. The number of strong disciples was twice that of the nine-origin universe.

The main point was that the belief universe now had two universes.

During the last calamity, they conquered one universe and developed it into their belief universe.

With an additional universe, after the end of the calamity, there would naturally be an additional resource field.

How many more resources could a universe have?

This was simply unimaginable.

The number of experts in the belief universe was extremely terrifying now. The information that Wang Xian obtained from them was more than double that of the nine-origin universe!

Of course, he didn’t know how many masters of the ruler realm were currently in the nine-origin universe.

Thus, it was just a rough guess.

However, so many powerhouses was definitely not good news for the 9-origin universe.

Apart from a large number of powerhouses, the belief universe was also divided into many forces.

Currently, the two universes in the belief universe had 24 top-tier forces, and each force had a king of gods!

These 24 powers were known as the 24 palaces in the belief universe!

Each of the 24 palaces had a large number of experts.

“The number of gods in this belief universe is really large. However, the ordinary living beings in the belief universe are really miserable!”

In the belief universe, everyone cultivated the power of belief.

And in order to quickly obtain the power of belief, there was only one way, and that was to develop believers.

This also made the ordinary living beings, generation after generation, and their descendants, all become believers and provide their own power.

There was no chance for them to turn things around!

The gods enslaved a large number of believers, and the believers would never be able to turn things around!

As long as they had a good background, it was possible for them to reach the realm of the gods!

This was the cultivation method of the universe of faith!

This information was not of much use to the current Wang Xian. However, there were many pieces of information that were of great use to him!

Currently, one-third of the experts in the belief universe were participating in the war against the nine-origin universe.

There were five space behemoths that were at the level five.

The remaining two-thirds of the gods that believed in the universe were searching for treasures in the universe.

They were trying to recruit more space behemoths that were at the level five.

Now, in front of their channel, there were many gods.
