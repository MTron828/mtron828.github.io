Chapter 1596: 1596 could not survive without going crazy

“My Heart is with you now. Don’t have any thoughts. Even if I Die this time, you won’t be able to take over my heart!”

“Moreover, even if I die this time, it won’t be long before I come back to life!”

“Your heart is in my hands. I will give it to one of my subordinates. My subordinate will tell you what you will do after I Die!”

“This time, you must bring Jian ‘er back no matter what. After this is over, I will set you free!”

Wang Xian reminded the hunchbacked old man.

This was also a warning to him.

“Come back from the dead?”

The hunchbacked old man was slightly shocked when he heard Wang Xian’s words.

To come back from the dead and come back from the dead with a drop of blood was an ability that only gods could achieve.

He could do it?

However, when he thought of the strange heart of Light and darkness, he pursed his lips. “You won’t use this heart to possess me, right?”

The old man asked with some worry in his heart.

Now, he was really afraid of the strange Wang Xian.

From the bottom of his heart, he was afraid!

Wang Xian was a little speechless when he heard his words. With a dark face, he asked, “With your appearance, would I possess you?”

“That’s good, that’s Good!”

The hunchbacked old man smiled.

He was now a fish and had no strength to resist. No matter what happened, he could only accept it.

Furthermore, he knew a little about Wang Xian. It seemed that he was much kinder than he was in the past.

“You should get used to your own strength. Seven days later, we will make a big fuss and see who is the ruler of this world!”

A devilish smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face.

“Good, good, good. Don’t worry, boss Mo. I will let them know that I, Mo Sha, have returned!”

The stooped old man’s original name was Mo Sha.

He looked at Wang Xian with an arrogant expression. His eyes were filled with wildness.

He was like a demon that had just come out of its cage.

Wang Xian smiled and waved at him.

Mo Sha walked out obediently.

“My only sect hopes that Jian ‘er will not be harmed in any way!”

Wang Xian sat at the side and muttered to himself.

This time, Wang Xian had already made his final plan.

The worst outcome would be death.

However, if he really died, my only sect would not have an easy time either.

After his death, the heart of Light and darkness and the light and Darkness Dragon Pearl were placed in Mo Sha.

With Mo Sha’s talent and current strength, if he didn’t want to die, it would be very difficult for him to die in the vast area.

He had to sacrifice himself to save Ling Jian ‘ER.

Then, he would use the energy he obtained from the Bingxin Empire to resurrect her.

“Only my sect. I hope it doesn’t come to this. Otherwise, I will let your sect’s millions of people die without a burial ground!”

Wang Xian slowly closed his eyes.

With the removal of the heart of Light and darkness, he was no longer able to use the powers of darkness and light.

However, the five elements were not affected by light and darkness. He could use them without restraint.

Having mastered the five elements perfectly, he was more powerful in battle than light and darkness.

He sat there quietly and familiarized himself with the five elements and the ten thousand origin spirit at the location of the heart!

Time slowly passed by.

However, at this moment, the announcement made by lone faction caused a huge uproar in the entire vast region.

“I really didn’t expect lone faction to be so calm. They didn’t send anyone to kill the sky demon directly, nor did they say anything harsh. Instead, they are holding a wedding banquet seven days later!”

“This is lone faction’s contempt for the Sky Demon. They don’t put the sky demon in their eyes at all, but I keep feeling that this is the calm before the storm!”

“The absolute calm before the storm. Lone sect directly announced that Bing Jian ‘er and young master ao Tian are going to hold a wedding. This is humiliating Sky Demon. Not only that, after this wedding, lone sect should make a move!”

“The more this is the case, the more I feel that lone sect is terrifying. For this wedding, Lone Sect has invited all the second-rate and first-rate forces in the world. Something big will definitely happen!”

In the past few days, everyone was talking about the solipsistic sect and the Sky Demon.

Everyone was also guessing what the solipsistic sect would do next.

Seven days was not a long time. On the fourth day, all the first-rate and second-rate forces that came from a vast area of over a million kilometers rushed towards the solipsistic sect.

It would take at least a day and a half to fly from the ruins of the divine kingdom to the solipsistic sect.

On the fifth day, Wang Xian walked out of the manor. There was no one beside him. He wore a crown on his head and walked straight in the direction of the lone sect.

On the crown, there were five five elemental dragon beads inlaid.

At this moment, Wang Xian’s appearance was exactly the same as when he was in the flowing sea region.

There was no light or darkness.

“That’s...”

“Oh my God, that’s the Sky Demon!”

“It’s him. He actually walked out in such a grand manner. is he going there?”

“The direction he’s heading to is the only sect. Oh My God, why is he going there alone? is he sending himself to his death?”

When everyone in the ruins of the divine kingdom saw Wang Xian swaggering out, they were shocked.

At this moment, he still dared to swagger out?

Furthermore, looking at the direction he was heading towards, it was the lone sect. What was he trying to do?

Go to the lone sect?

Was he seeking his own death?

Everyone’s eyes flickered with extreme shock.

Very soon, the news of the Sky Demon flying alone towards the lone sect spread throughout the entire ruins of the divine kingdom.

Those forces that had been paying attention to the news of the sky demon revealed astonished expressions on their faces.

What was he trying to do?

To barge into the lone tyrant sect?

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian flew into the sky and smiled faintly as he felt the gazes from everyone.

Mo Sha did not follow beside him. Instead, he headed towards the lone tyrant sect in advance.

He rushed to the lone tyrant sect in advance to observe the terrain and make all the necessary preparations.

There were only two experts at level nine of the Seethrough realm in the entire sect. One of them was the supreme leader of the sect.

The other one was the one who had not appeared for a long time.

As he strolled in the void, he flew towards the sect unhurriedly.

On the way, when someone saw Wang Xian, they looked as if they had seen a ghost and fled in fear.

Wang Xian ignored them and flew alone.

On the morning of the seventh day, all the major forces in the vast region rushed over from the 10810,000-meter-tall Mount Solitaire. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

In front of Yingtian Peak, festive lanterns were hung high up and there were all kinds of flowers.

It made the entire mountain peak extremely beautiful.

In the cave at the corner of the mountain peak, festive red filled the room.

Ling Jian ‘er, who was dressed in festive attire, sat there stiffly.

At the side, Young Master Ao Tian and Bing FA Bing Jing Huan were standing behind.

“I heard that the sky demon is here. When we hold our wedding later, let’s use fresh blood to decorate it. Red, festive!”
