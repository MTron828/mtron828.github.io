Chapter 1639: The 1639 Heavenly Devil realm was still divided into half

“Kill!”

An earth-shaking voice filled with killing intent resounded above Tianyun City.

More than 10,000 experts from the dragon-phoenix Empire and the Dragon Palace flew down and dived down with killing intent.

“What’s That?”

“That giant beast is the giant beast of the Wilderness Goddess!”

“That’s the people from the dragon-phoenix Empire. Why are they here? Didn’t the experts from our vast area go to destroy them? Why are they here?”

When Xiao Lan landed in the sky above Tianyun City and over ten thousand profound void realm experts swooped down, the entire Tianyun city trembled.

Over ten thousand profound void realm experts? What kind of concept was that?

There were only twenty thousand profound void realm experts in the entire vast region.

Now, over ten thousand of them had come to attack their city. It was simply overkill.

Within Tianyun City, most people still did not know that the army from the vast region had returned in defeat.

“Damn it, the Sky Demon and dragon-phoenix Empire really dare to attack us!”

“It’s over, it’s over. They’re crazy, they’re Crazy!”

At this moment, all the masters and experts from the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop revealed embarrassed expressions.

They looked at the terrifying experts descending from the sky with shock and anger.

They had thought that the other party would be afraid of life and death and holy items, but they hadn’t expected that the other party would be so brazen and rampant!

“Everyone from the life and Death Pill workshop and the Sacred Item Forging Workshop, die!”

A voice filled with killing intent sounded once again, and despair appeared on the faces of the people from the two large factions.

The entire Tianyun city was filled with shock.

They actually dared to kill the people from the life and Death Pill workshop and the Sacred Item Forging Workshop.

This was a terrifying force on the continent!

However, the swords and blood made them understand that they were killing two forces on the continent today.

Screams of agony rang out instantly. They were the headquarters of the two major forces.

In the entire city, half of the people belonged to the two major forces.

Blood flowed like a river and screams of agony couldn’t be resolved.

Wang Xian, Feng Luan, and the rest stood on top of the city quietly, overlooking everything.

An hour later, the massacre ended. All the treasures of the two major forces were plundered clean.

“The target is the Wuji Empire. Destroy ten of their cities. In addition, send ten teams of 100 people to see through the void. Destroy all the life and death pill workshops and holy item forging workshops in all the cities in the vast region!”

Wang Xian continued to give orders.

“Let’s go to the Wuji Empire!”

“100-man teams, come down from the city that Xiao Lan is passing through!”

Feng Luan and Lan Qingyue passed down the orders one by one.

“Woo Woo!”

Xiao Lan continued to fly.

More than ten hours later, the news of the destruction of Tianyun City and the life and Death Pill Workshop and holy item forging workshop spread to the ruins of the divine kingdom.

It reached the ears of the three superpowers.

“Those two are continent-level factions. The dragon-phoenix Empire and sky demon have no scruples and directly destroyed them!”

“This is crazy. I heard that the giant beasts are flying in the vast region. Sky Demon is leading a group of experts to wreak havoc!”

“The three superpowers and experts in our vast region are all gathered here in the ruins of the divine kingdom. They aren’t taking any action at all.”

“The current Sky Demon is wreaking havoc in the vast region with an invincible aura. Who Dares to stop them?”

In the ruins of the divine kingdom, when they heard that Wang Xian and the rest had destroyed Tianyun city, all of them were filled with shock.

They even dared to destroy two mainland-level forces. What else would they not dare to do?

“Has the news of the peace request been sent over?”

At this moment, in the ruins of the divine kingdom, a Patriarch of the Wuji Empire heard the news of Tianyun City and asked with a gloomy face.

“Reporting to Patriarch, the news has already been sent over. It should be sent back very soon!”

A middle-aged man hurriedly replied as his forehead was covered in cold sweat.

The five patriarchs had been sitting there for more than ten hours without moving.

They were waiting for all the news from the dragon-phoenix Empire.

The patriarchs of the three major factions would not be able to have peace for a day without being able to seek peace.

“Report! News has come from the He clan. Skyfiend and Empress Dragon Phoenix said that if they want peace, they have to take out half of the territory in the vast area and add conditions for them to see!”

Not long after, news from the He clan came and reported to the five patriarchs.

“Half of the territory in the vast area!”

Upon hearing this, the two patriarchs of the Wuji Dynasty stood up with extremely ugly expressions.

The territory of the Wuji Empire only occupied one-tenth of the vast territory. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Now, the Dragon and Phoenix Empire had asked for half of the vast territory.

This made their faces extremely ugly.

“What a big appetite! Not only do they want half of the territory, but they also want other conditions!”

The two patriarchs of the southern royal family said with heavy breaths, full of coldness.

The entire room was silent as if it was a prehistoric beast.

The middle-aged man who was kneeling on the ground was trembling violently.

Time passed slowly.

“Reporting, reporting to patriarch, five cities of our Wuji Empire have been destroyed and all the treasures and resources have been plundered!”

More than ten hours later, another piece of news arrived.

“Peng!”

The table beside Patriarch Dark Eye and another patriarch dissipated into fragments.

“Give them half of the domain!”

Southern Emperor River said expressionlessly.

“His appetite is not limited to that!”

The Supreme Hierarch said with a sullen face.

“The three major factions will take out some resources and pass the news of the resources to them!”

“In addition, get the dragon-phoenix Empire and Skyfiend Empire to come to the divine kingdom ruins. We will have a good discussion!”

Patriarch Dark Eye leaned back on his chair and said weakly.

“Alright!”

“Alright!”

Only the sect and the southern royal family agreed.

There was nothing they could do if they did not agree.

Since they could not beat them in a fight, they could only risk their lives.

However, they cherished their lives and did not dare to risk their lives. They could only compromise.

If you want a domain, I’ll give you a domain. If you want something else, I’ll give you something else.

“Send the news over!”

Time slowly passed.

And at that moment, after two to three days, the divine kingdom ruins and the vast region had completely boiled over.

Tianyun city had been destroyed. The Life and Death Pill workshops and holy item forging workshops in all the cities in the vast region had been attacked by the Dragon and Phoenix Empire.

Ten cities in the Wuji Empire had already been plundered by the Dragon and Phoenix Empire and the Sky Demon Empire.

What shocked them the most was that the three major forces had completely given up on resisting.

Even when the cities of the Wuji Empire were plundered, no one resisted or took revenge.

The Sky Demon was wreaking havoc and all the forces in the vast region bowed their heads.

Everyone could foresee that in the future, the position of the leader of the vast region would already belong to someone.

“Oh? Did they agree? There are still some conditions!”

Wang Xian looked at the message sent by the He clan and the corner of his mouth curled up slightly.

“You want to get rid of us just by relying on these? It’s not enough, is it?”

Feng Luan looked at the conditions that they gave and a smile appeared on her face.

“Let’s go to the ruins of the divine kingdom and have a good talk with them!”

Wang Xian stood in the sky and looked ahead.

This piece of land was already under his feet.

It wouldn’t be long before the Dragon Palace officially stepped onto the stage of the history of the supernatural continent.

A new page of history had quietly begun!
