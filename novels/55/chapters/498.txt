“Don’t take my arm and stop asking me to marry you!”

“I hope you can write down the contents of the Fire God’s Secret Book in these next few days!”

Wang Xian was walking with Adjaya at night on the road of Shang Jing. He reminded her again when they were about to enter Sui Clan’s territory.

Adjaya threw him a cold look. “What? Is this a warning to me?”

Seeing how she acted, Wang Xian was helpless. “I don’t want my girlfriends to misunderstand!”

“Hmph, that’s your business!”

As she spoke, her eyes were suddenly red.

“Hey, can you stop acting like this? It feels like I’m bullying you,” Wang Xian hurriedly told her upon seeing her look.

“Are you trying to deny it? I followed you here and gave you all the treasures. You can kick me away anytime now. If I write out the contents in the Fire God’s Secret Book, will you ask me to scram?”

Adjaya stared at him with tears welling up in her eyes as she glowered at him coldly.

“No, no. Forget it. Do whatever you want, I won’t chase you away!”

Wang Xian went soft-hearted upon seeing her look.

A peerless Budding Realm Goddess who had obtained the legacy of the Fire God had followed him all the way to the foreign land. If he continued to bully her, Wang Xian was really not a man.

“That’s better. I don’t need you to mind my business. You can’t chase me away either!”

Adjaya lifted her chin slightly and walked off.

“You should make a turn over here. You don’t even know your way, why are you taking the lead?”

Wang Xian shook his head. He did not understand women.

“Dragon King!”

Upon seeing the arrival of Wang Xian, the people from Sui Clan greeted him respectfully.

“Mm, I’ll go over myself!”

Wang Xian waved at the disciples of Sui Clan on the way over and headed for the Sacred Mountain of Sui Clan.

Adjaya, on his heels as she regained her mood, looked around the Siheyuan with curiosity.

“Haha, Wang Xian is here?”

Sui Huang’s voice was heard even before Wang Xian stepped in.

“It looks like your injuries have almost recovered!”

Wang Xian walked in with a broad smile.

“Xiao Xian!”

Guan Shuqing trotted over with a beaming face as she tugged his arm.

However, her smile disappeared when she saw the girl tagging along behind him. She studied her curiously.

No, calling her a girl was inappropriate. She looked more like a Goddess.

Guan Shuqing had seen foreign babes before, but it was her first time seeing babes like Adjaya, who was such a ravishing beauty.

Tall and perfect figure, wearing a crown, and a truncheon in her hand. She had a special demeanor.

Guan Shuqing had only observed a similar demeanor on Sun Lingxiu before.

Unlike Sun Lingxiu who was pure light, Adjaya was more like a proud fire that one could not help but take a few more looks at.

“Who is she?”

Guan Shuqing was on her guard as she asked Wang Xian softly. Her eyes were locked on his.

“A friend from Dubai. Her name is Adjaya!”

Wang Xian’s lips were trembling as he replied solemnly to Guan Shuqing.

“Friend? What friend?”

“Just an ordinary friend. Don’t imagine things, Shuqing. Don’t you believe me?”

Wang Xian forced a smile on his face.

Adjaya, who could not understand what they were talking about, smiled at Guan Shuqing.

“Hello!”

Guan Shuqing nodded to Adjaya doubtfully.

Sui Huang walked out and asked Wang Xian with a beaming face, “Wang Xian, did you reap anything this time?”

“Not bad, you don’t have to worry about the Art of Cultivation!”

Wang Xian chuckled. With Guan Shuqing in his arms, they walked over. Seeing that his arm had already grown out, he said “I didn’t expect you to recover quite fast!”

“I consumed a lot of treasures!”

Sui Huang sat at one side and gestured to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian said something to Adjaya, and she sat on one side.

“Hur?”

Seeing the truncheon in Adjaya’s hand, Sui Huang slightly frowned.

“Sui Huang, what’s the situation now in the Underworld?” asked Wang Xian to Sui Huang while sipping his tea.

Sui Huang shifted his attention as he slightly pondered. With a sigh, he said, “It’s very complicated. Everyone is on their own now!”

Wang Xian slightly knit his eyebrows. “Is Diabolism very strong?”

“Yes, indeed!” Sui Huang nodded. “Diabolism, who kept a low profile for fifty years, erupted with daunting strength all of a sudden. Emperor Qi of Diabolism is going to challenge Nie Wushuang, the Sect Leader of Donghua Sacred Sect!”

Diabolism is frantically avenging the enemies of fifty years ago. Five first-class forces and one Sacred Sect are down. The unparalleled experts from Remains even warned me not to take part in the grudges between Dongmen Clan and them yesterday. Otherwise, they will bring a bloodbath to Sui Clan. They are as overbearing as they were fifty years ago. Donghua Sacred Sect will be joining hands with some Sacred Sects these next few days to either suppress, wipe them out, or make peace with Diabolism.”

Of course, that will depend on the war between Emperor Qi and Nie Wushuang!”

Wang Xian nodded slowly. “How many Sacred Sects are involved now?”

“Six Sacred Sects and one Sacred Clan. Eighty percent of the strength in the Underworld is involved, and this is not taking the annihilated Shengling Sect into account,” Sui Huang said with a sullen face.

“Seven Saint-class forces. Now, we only have eight Sacred Sects and four Sacred Clans in the Underworld. And yet, we have seven forces involved in it.” Wang Xian exhibited a grave expression. “Sui Huang, do you intend to stay out of this?”

“Now, it’s not up to me to decide. But if Sui Clan, Xiao Clan, and Dragon Sect can join hands together, it might be worth a try!” Sui Huang said slowly.

“No, I’m not going to get involved. They can kill whoever they like. It has got nothing to with Dragon Sect!”

Wang Xian chuckled. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“You only have fifty disciples in Dragon Sect. It’s easy for you to stay out of this, but not Sui Clan!”

Sui Huang sighed as he revealed a worried face.

There were two lineups at the moment, Diabolism and orthodox sects.

Joining Diabolism was out of the question. But he did not want to join the orthodox sects either.

In order to annihilate Diabolism fifty years ago, there were no more than a hundred Inborn Experts who remained in the entire Underworld.

If things turned out to be the same as before, it would be a bloodbath again.

“I wonder what Diabolism thinks...?”

Wang Xian shook his head slowly.

“What do you think? They are nourishing themselves through fights with fresh blood, corpses, and bloodlust. All these things empower the strong ones. They are just a bunch of devils who have no conscience and aren’t afraid of death!” Sui Huang said with a sullen face.

They did not want to participate in this war, nor did they want Diabolism to win. If they won, it would be darkness for them all in the future.

This was a difficult choice and also a helpless one.

“Come and look for me if you’re in trouble!”

Upon seeing Sui Huang’s troubled expression, Wang Xian spoke to him with a broad smile.

Regardless of whether it was God or Devil, they would only become corpses if they made enemies with him!
