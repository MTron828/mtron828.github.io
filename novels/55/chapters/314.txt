Chapter 315: Joining Forces

“The spiritual medicine garden is here!” a voice boomed. As it sounded across the entire Spiritual Island, all bickering and commotion elsewhere came to a standstill.

In an instant, figures could be seen darting over at electrifying speeds.

Across the sky, nine Inborn experts soared through the air. When they saw the various treasures in the Spiritual Medicine Garden, their eyes blazed with desire.

With a shrug, they hopped onto the fringes of the garden.

“A Level 6 Spiritual Medicine, goodness! To think it’s the Level 6 White Valley Lotus. Ah hah! A ripe White Valley Lotus!” one exclaimed in elation.

“A Green Fruit Tree! Such a Level 6 Tree can produce six Level 5 Spiritual Fruits in a year. While the over-ripened fruits have fallen and turned into compost!” another said excitedly.

“Dozens of Level 5 Spiritual Grasses, and plenty more of those of Level 3 to 4!” a third cheered.

A crazed look swept across the nine Inborn experts. As they scanned their surroundings, their cold stares were overcome by burning desire at the sight of the Spiritual Medicine aplenty.

Should they be able to obtain these Spiritual Medicine, it would no doubt double the prowess of their clans right away.

What’s more, they may even attain Sacred Sect status given long-term cultivation of this entire plot, but only if they could possess it.

This was especially so, as this Spiritual Island happened to be a rare floating island. This meant that the island was able to move along the ocean, making it an ideal Spiritual Land.

In addition, there were white flowers growing along the perimeters which emitted a misty fog. Aside from camouflaging effects, the flora could also help gather Spiritual Energy. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Amidst the oceans, this piece of land was surrounded by unpolluted air. Hence its concentration of Spiritual Energy definitely outweighed those from the cities.

The Inborn experts pondered as their eyes twinkled. Meanwhile, disciples of the various forces gathered behind their clan experts, keeping a vigilant watch over the surroundings.

In the brief fight earlier, some of these disciples had already sustained injuries.

“To compete based on merits?” a middle-aged elder asked blandly.

With a glum face, he cast his glance towards the six Inborn experts from the Lei Family and Water Separation Island.

To which, the Inborn experts kept mum, as they continued eyeing each other in order to assess one another’s abilities.

The strengths of the Lei Family, Water Separation Island, and Wind God Sect were neck and neck. This time around, each of them was represented by three Inborn experts.

Perhaps variations existed between individual Inborn experts. Yet, should they really start fighting, the outcome remained to be seen.

But one thing was certain: some of them would perish.

The nine Inborn experts continued to observe each other, and in an instant, tension filled the atmosphere.

Meanwhile, the disciples crowding behind gripped their weapons with a heavy look.

A fight could break out any moment now.

“I don’t think it would do any of us any good should we start battling it out now. Unless any of you are confident in annihilating the other party. Otherwise, it’s bad news to all even if only one should escape!” an elder from Water Separation Island chipped in as he surveyed the six Inborn experts.

When the three leveled forces really started fighting, it would not be surprising should they end up with a Pyrrhic Victory.

Whereas if only one party should win marginally, and should information about the Spiritual Island be divulged, then they would be bound to be attacked by other sects and clans. Who knows, they may even face being seized by Sacred Sects.

All this for one floating island, given its high value. In fact, it was so superior it could make a good Sect ground.

Giving thought to his analysis, the Inborn experts from the Lei Family and Wind God Sect agreed with the elder from Water Separation Island.

“An equal division then?” an elder from the Lei Family asked as he squinted, testing the reaction of others.

“How are we going to do that? This floating island is one huge gem!”

Smiling, the elder from Water Separation Island replied, “How about this? We from the Water Separation Island will take the floating island alone, while you can have everything else!”

“Wishful thinking!” an elder from the Lei Family snapped.

The worth of the entire floating island was no less than the Spiritual Medicine Garden, the secret manual it held, and the like combined.

Just then, the Elder from Water Separation Island who spoke earlier uttered, “Ever thought of establishing a Saint-class force?”

As he finished, the Inborn experts from Wind God Sect and Lei Family could not help but flinch.

They took one look at the crowd around them before turning towards the Spiritual Grass which was nestled in the garden, and breathed somewhat heavily.

Should the three parties join forces, and give it a little more than a decade, they could really end up setting a Saint-Class force for all we know.

A Sacred Sect! One immensely massive entity!

But, to have three forces coming together to set up one Sacred Sect is a huge matter, where interests are complicated and stakes are high. It would take days to sort everything out.

“What we’ll have to do now, is to hide this Spiritual Island. To keep it away from the other forces. As for its allocation, the three forces shall discuss it thereafter!” an elder from the Lei Family suggested steadily.

“Alright!” one nodded.

“Agreed!” another seconded the thought.

“Instead of fighting and vying ourselves to our deaths, we might as well join forces!” The nine Inborn experts laughed. To them, this was the best choice possible.

“Gentlemen, it appears that you’ve yet to ask for our take,” Mo Qinglong interrupted. He was with Mo Yuan and Mo Shiwu meanwhile. As he spoke, the trio frowned and scanned the crowd.

“Haha! Oops, we’ve forgotten about the few outsiders!” an elder joked as he surveyed the trio.

“Outsiders? We made a pact back then. To inform the forces that joined later, and split the share of this Spiritual Island!” Mo Shiwu rebuked while peering at a few young men from the three forces.

“True enough. We’ve indeed made a pact. To vie for the treasures based on our own merits!” a voice argued.

“That’s right. And the treasures are right here. Take them with you if you’ve got what it takes!” another challenged.

“Haha! Mo Shiwu, if you’ve got what it takes, you may take all the treasures here with you right away. But if you don’t, hah!” a third gloated.

Thereafter, several young men from each of the three forces stepped out and smirked as they eyed Mo Shiwu.

“Show us what you’ve got. Otherwise, you’re not fit to get an equal share of the treasures as us!” a young man provoked once again, this time annoying Mo Shiwu.

“You ingrates. Had I not rescued the few of you at the start, you fellows would have died at the hands of the Yakshas long ago!” Mo Shiwu snapped as he glared at them.

“Humph, weren’t you also protecting yourself by saving us? Don’t take the moral high ground!” a young man criticized as he stared right back.

“Folks, how would you suggest we handle these three?” an elder of the Lei Family asked the Inborn experts sarcastically.

“Vying for the treasures with us leaves us with no choice but to strike!” an elder announced as he stepped forward with a faint grin.

Gradually, three experts from the Lei Family and Water Separation Island began to follow suit. They had their eyes fixed on Mo Qinglong and gang with a deathly stare.

To which, Mo Qinglong and the gang responded with a burdened look.
