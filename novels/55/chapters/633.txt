Chapter 634: Fashion Show

“Xiao Yu, Qingyue, Lingxiu, you girls stay here while I settle some stuff in the disordered region!”

The yacht approached the island and parked under the guidance of the staff.

Wang Xian scanned the entire island, where it seemed to be overcrowded.

“You’re going over now? It’s almost evening!”

Lan Qingyue and the rest fixed their discontented eyes on Wang Xian. “I was hoping you could accompany us!”

Wang Xian shook his head and smiled. “After I settle the remaining stuff here, I can join all of you for a few days here!”

“Sir, aren’t you here for the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show? Why are you leaving again?” asked the staff from the Glacier Coral Island in bewilderment when he overheard their conversation.

“Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show?”

Xiao Yu, Lan Qingyue, and the rest froze for a moment with a surprised look surfacing on their faces.

“Didn’t you know about it? The reason for the crowd on this island these few days is because of Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show. So I thought you guys came to watch it too!”

The staff smiled and did not say anything further.

“Is it being held today?”

The five girls exchanged gazes as they asked with glistening eyes.

“Yes, it’s tonight. This time it’s a public show, but it will be crowded!”

The staff nodded. “Sir and Madam, do you want to book a hotel?”

“Yes, two presidential suites!”

Lan Qingyue nodded and stared at the rest of the girls fervently. “It’s the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show. We must have a look and buy some clothes!”

“That’s right. Hehe, but I wonder if there are any more front row seats!”

“All the angelic beauties from all over the world will be here. I feel like going too!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Not only Lan Qingyue, but even Sun Lingxiu, who would have always been indifferent, was also full of interest now.

No woman disliked beauty.

“Xiao Xian, are you going? If not, we’re going to have fun ourselves tonight!”

Lan Qingyue huddled over and smiled at him.

“Fine, I’ll go with you girls!”

Wang Xian shrugged and spoke with a smile.

“Hey, are you sure you’re not changing your mind because it’s the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show? What a pervert!”

“Heh...”

The girls stared at Wang Xian, making him speechless.

“Am I that kind of person? I feel content with you girls around!”

Wang Xian shook his head immediately as he responded with a serious face.

“Who will believe you!?” Lan Qingyue rolled eyes at him. “Let’s go. It’s 3 PM now. The show starts at six. Let’s go and get our tickets!”

“Hurry, there are probably no tickets by now!”

“Might have some scalper tickets? Let’s see if we can get some!”

Although this was a public show. It had a seating area, and therefore tickets were required.

In the country, there was once a fashion show where tickets were resold for more than three hundred thousand. Even so, there were buyers around.

One could imagine how crazy that fashion show was.

Those who could enter the show were people who had a net worth of more than ten million.

Moreover. It was a lingerie show that featured the top-notch beauties from all around the world.

Wang Xian had heard of the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show too. He ordered the members of Dragon Palace to enter the disordered region first while Mo Qinglong and his gang waited for him someplace on the island.

“Brother, go and ask where to buy the tickets!”

Arm in arm, the five girls instructed Wang Xian.

“Fine!”

Adding to his loss for words, Wang Xian found a passerby and asked him.

“Follow me, but I’m not sure if there are any more tickets!”

Wang Xian headed to a vintage building along with the girls.

Glacier Coral Island, as a world-renowned tourist island, had a superb environment.

Clean land, warm sunshine, clear skies with distinct colors from the sea. Cool hunks and hotties were all around the island.

“You better get us the tickets no matter what!” Xiao Yu grumbled while Wang Xian chuckled and patted her head.

They came to the official ticket office, and sure enough, the tickets had been sold out since it was near to the opening time.

“I’ll check if there are any scalper tickets!”

Wang Xian shrugged as he surveyed his surroundings.

“Hey buddy, want tickets?”

Just then, a young man approached Wang Xian with a hint of excitement in his eyes. He fished tickets out of his pockets.

“Hur? How many do you have?” asked Wang Xian immediately after pausing for a moment.

“How many do you want?” the young man asked instead.

“Six. Do you have them?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrow.

“Yes, one for four hundred thousand. It’s in the front row!”

The young man scrutinized him from head to toe before he said this right away.

“Give me six tickets!”

Four hundred thousand for a ticket was a sky-rocketed amount. Six would make 2.4 million.

“Are they authentic tickets?” Wang Xian asked impassively upon seeing the young man taking out his notebook, getting ready for the bank transfer.

“Don’t worry. Look for me if you got fake tickets. There are bank transfer records.”

The young man drew his lips and spoke with confidence.

“Great!”

Without any further words, Wang Xian transferred the money over.

“Done!”

Wang Xian waved the six tickets in his hands and looked toward the girls.

“Awesome. Let’s find a place and take a short break!”

The five girls pointed at a place and walked over while Wang Xian followed behind with a broad smile.

“Haha, rich people are dumb. Such an idiot!”

That young man who had sold the scalper tickets was looking all excited as he stared at the disappearing figures.

“He didn’t even bother to check. What a dumbass. Perhaps he’s too silly such that he has five babes surrounding him. Hmph!”

The young man could not help but kiss his notebook. “So what if you find out about my account? I have joined the Yaofeng Wandering Group as my backing if you dare to seek trouble. With this money, I can buy some pure Blood Coral to enhance my cultivation level!”

The young man murmured as he walked to a building in the middle with a beaming face.

Wang Xian accompanied the five girls for afternoon tea while they were taking pictures without stopping.

“Let’s go!”

Around five, Wang Xian brought the ladies to the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show.

The show was located in the middle of the island, and was set up outdoors with a luxurious catwalk stage and seating area.

Many people came to watch the show, including not only men but also babes.

Among these, there were renowned celebrities invited over from Asia.

Every year, the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show marked a grand feast that brought together the top brands from the world and the most trendy lingerie.

Not only did it attract the men, but it also attracted the ladies.

Wang Xian had to say he’d decided to postpone his trip to the disordered region to tomorrow because of this.

When Wang Xian and the ladies arrived, the entrance was crowded with over thousands of people.

All of them were lined up to verify their tickets.
