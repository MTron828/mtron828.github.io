Chapter 676: The Dolphin Princess (2)

“There are actually mountain ranges under the sea, and the spiritual energy waterfall is pouring into them!”

“Many underwater creatures are gathered around here too!”

Tang Yinxuan came to the bottom of the sea as she surveyed the surroundings with a face of surprise. There were all kinds of marine creatures rushing toward the spiritual energy waterfall.

The marine creatures, after Enlightenment, came close to the spiritual energy waterfall out of instinct.

Buzz!

More than four hundred dolphins swam around and gathered at a mountain in the sea.

These dolphins surrounded her in the center. To Tang Yinxuan’s surprise, these dolphins began to cultivate.

That’s right. Cultivate!

She could sense the dolphins guiding the Spiritual Energy into their bodies. Most surprising of all, all the dolphins gathered and released an ultrasonic wave that contained a unique kind of energy.

This energy guided Spiritual Energy into their bodies.

Instantly, a vast amount of energy entered their bodies.

Tang Yinxuan was dumbfounded as she quickly looked to another side.

She noticed many marine creatures were cultivating, absorbing the Spiritual Energy.

This was shocking to her. Did the living creatures in the sea know anything about the Art of Cultivation?

Sensing Spiritual Energy was circulating around her, Tang Yinxuan set aside her curiosity and sat beside the dolphins.

All the dolphins were packed together while she sat on top, just like a Dolphin Princess.

She sat cross-legged and began her cultivation.

The spiritual energy waterfall was an ultimate chance encounter.

Ding ding!

Suddenly, the zither beside her let out a crisp and clear sound. She opened her eyes, feeling stunned. She sensed ultrasonic waves rippling above her, forming a special kind of control power.

Sound had power too. Even though it was not part of the nine attributes, sound could kill.

Heavenly Sound Sect only knew a little about the use of sound. The rest was dependant on attributes.

Take Tang Yinxuan, for instance. She was water-attributed, combining water energy with sound as a means of combat. But the true combat capability still came from water energy.

The sound only played the role of interference.

However, the sound that the dolphins gave off could affect physical items, albeit small.

She seemed to have some understanding as she placed her hands on the zither, playing special music that merged with the sonic waves of the dolphins.

Instantly, Tang Yinxuan and the dolphins’ speed of absorbing Spiritual Energy sharply increased.

Bouts of Spiritual Energy swamped their bodies.

Their cultivation levels were boosted at a frenzied speed.

After some time, she sensed a fierce aura around her as ferocious sharks swam over to her.

The pod of dolphins panicked while Tang Yinxuan remained unwavering. She closed her eyes and placed both hands on the zither, striking the incoming sharks with water ripples.

Growl!

The pod of sharks scattered in horror.

The dolphins let out a thrilling sound as they looked up at Tang Yinxuan before they continued their cultivation.

Boom boom!

Not knowing how much time had passed, one could hear battling coming from above while a terrifying aura spread out, striking fear into some marine creatures.

Tang Yinxuan sensed the domineering aura and had a slight change in her expression. “Luckily I got them to leave first, or else...”

She let out a sigh of relief and continued her practice.

At this time, a few thousand people were gathering around the middle of the spiritual energy waterfall.

Fifty-odd middle-aged and old men in peculiar clothes stood at the center of an island while white-colored Spiritual Energy fell upon them.

Hiak hiak!

Right in the middle was an elder with a grey poisonous snake coiling around his neck.

The viper stuck out its bloody-red tongue that was half-meter long while the old man revealed a sinister smile as he stuck out his tongue too. His tongue was also of equal length as the viper and looked horrible.

The old man then licked the tongue of the viper with his tongue. The scene looked extremely creepy.

Beside him, more than hundreds of corpses were lying around on the floor. He craned up and stared at the spiritual energy waterfall, rolling his tongue. “This chance encounter belongs to the Creepy Snake Group. Don’t think you can occupy it!”

“Da She, you had your chance encounter in China earlier on. Now? Haha, you don’t even dare to set foot there!” An old man who was wearing a red metallic mask, with a red coat, spoke with a sarcastic voice. “This is not solely your chance encounter!”

“Hiak, Alieyan, you can go to China and have a taste yourself!”

“Both of you stop it! The three forces will divide this place equally. Any objections?”

At this time, a sharp woman’s voice came from opposite the old man with a metallic mask.

This woman was wearing extremely revealing clothes, exposing her baby skin. She looked extremely bewitching.

The frightening things were her heads. She had two, one of which was extremely ugly, and the other one was gorgeous!

“Dual-Head Yan Mei, you need to ask Da She if he has any objections!” said the old man with the red mask.

“I want the spot at the bottom of the sea. Who dares to fight with me for it shall die!”

Da She twisted his body like a snake as he rose into the air.

“My people, grab this opportunity and begin your cultivation!”

He let out a sharp voice.

Whoo!

As soon as he finished his sentence, the sea snakes suddenly sprang out of the sea.

Each of them was about three meters long, with shirtless people sitting on them.

There were mixed genders, and their bodies were wound by snakes.

Almost five hundred people filled the entire region!

“Five hundred Creepy Snake palace guards trying to take over the marine region? Wouldn’t that be a waste?”

A flame rose from the head of that red-masked elder. The flame formed a human figure, staring at Da She with a pair of blazing eyes.

“Not at all. Hiak. You can also get your guys to cultivate with my men in the water too. It doesn’t matter!”

Da She wetted his lips. With a swift movement, he came to the sea right beside the island. With his triangular eyes, he stared at the red-masked elder and dual-headed woman. “I welcome you to join me down here!”

“Hehe!”

A flick of flame flashed on Alieyan’s mask as he turned to the dual-headed woman. “Let’s take the center as the dividing line, and we’ll each occupy half!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Fine!”

Once the three domineering forces finished their negotiations, they sat cross-legged and began their cultivation immediately.

“They didn’t fight!”

“Not so fast. We just made a huge commotion. Someone will be here soon. Even if there’s no one, we can surely attract those Immortal-class beings in the sea!”

“Haha, I hope they fight. How wonderful to have Immortal-class corpses!”

The group of people did not realize two pairs of bloodshot eyes were staring at them from above.

Their eyes were filled with blood and appeared maniacal.

The spiritual energy waterfall was an ultimate chance encounter to the cultivators in the real world. Similarly, it was an excellent chance encounter for the Yu Cauldron world too.

However, it was a terrible catastrophe to Tang Yinxuan and the marine creatures in the ocean!
