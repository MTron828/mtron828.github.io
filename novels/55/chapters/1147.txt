Chapter 1148: 1149 the alliance between undercurrent and Star Moon

Translator: 5496903

“The son of the master of undercurrent is suspected to have been assassinated by the Dragon Assassin Organization!”

“The Ace Assassin of the undercurrent assassin organization is suspected to have been assassinated by the Dragon Assassin Organization!”

“Two corpses are hanging on the east gate city wall. is the dragon assassin organization declaring war on the undercurrent assassin organization?”

One by one, information spread throughout bright moon city at a terrifying speed.

In the morning, someone confirmed that the middle-aged corpse was a peak expert at half-step void interpretation.

When this news came out, everyone had shocked expressions on their faces.

That middle-aged man at half-step void interpretation was very likely to be the ace assassin of undercurrent.

And those families that received the dragon Spike’s contact information had stunned expressions on their faces.

In their eyes, the undercurrent assassin organization that possessed a powerful foundation was definitely the top existence in star-moon kingdom. However, now, the son of the master of Undercurrent, the Ace Assassin, had been assassinated by the dragon spike.., moreover, they were all hung at the position of the East Gate’s city wall. This was a blatant humiliation to them!

“This dragon Spike actually dared to assassinate the son of the Master of undercurrent. Moreover, he even possesses the ability to assassinate. This...”

The eyes of those young families who had obtained the dragon Spike’s contact information flickered, and they immediately took out the contact information that they had thrown away.

“The price of the dragon Spike’s assassination is actually more than twice as cheap as that of the undercurrent!”

“This... The rules of the dragon spike are actually so strange. Children are not killed, and there are many good people. Mass-funded assassinations, half-price assassinations, this...”

When the families and mercenary groups entered the dragon Spike’s contact page through the communication stone plate, they were stunned.

Compared to the undercurrent, the price of the dragon spike was more than twice as cheap.

Moreover, the rules were also very strange.

It was common knowledge that children were the easiest to assassinate, but in the end, they didn’t accept the task of assassinating children.

This mass-funded assassination, half-price assassination, was a complete oddity in their eyes.

There was such an assassin organization?

East Sea city was relatively far from Bright Moon City, so many families in bright moon city did not know about the dragon spike.

When they learned about it now, they were all dumbfounded.

“This is too big. They directly announced their arrival by assassinating the son of the master of Undercurrent, the Ace assassin of undercurrent. How... Arrogant!”

Some people thought to themselves.

Many people looked at the assassination price and fell into deep thought.

The price was only half of the price of undercurrent. This made many people extremely tempted, and they were considering whether or not to make a move.

...

“Peng, arrogant, truly arrogant to the extreme. They actually hung the corpses on the city wall. They are looking down on Our Bright Moon City!”

At the seat of the city Lord’s Mansion, an old man sat there with an angry expression on his face. He looked at the two corpses in front of him with a sullen face. His expression was uncertain.

“City Lord Liu, the person in charge of the undercurrent here is here!”

At this moment, a woman beside him said to the city lord in a low voice.

“Is he here? Let them come in and recognize him!”

City Lord Liu nodded slightly and waved at the person in front of him.

If an outsider were here to see this scene, they would definitely be extremely shocked!

An assassin from the undercurrent had directly entered the city Lord’s Manor? This was simply...

In truth, the fact that the undercurrent was able to gain a foothold in star-moon kingdom was due to the great relationship between the star-moon royal family and the city Lord’s Manor.

Or it could be said that the two parties were cooperating openly.

Otherwise, the undercurrent wouldn’t have been able to go so smoothly.

“City Lord Liu!”

A thin old man walked in. His face was filled with anxiety as he greeted him. Then, he hurriedly looked towards the ground.

“Young... Young Master Ying!”

Looking at the corpse on the ground, the body of the old man from the undercurrent started to tremble. His eyes slowly turned blood red.

He was really the son of their leader. He was really their young master.

If their leader knew about this, even if he did not die, he would still be skinned alive.

“Dragon Spike... Dragon Spike... you actually dare to kill our young master!”

The old man’s emotions were somewhat agitated, and he clenched his fists tightly.

“It’s really your young master?”

City Lord Liu’s expression sank. As the city lord of Bright Moon City, one of the kingdom’s top experts, he naturally knew of the relationship between undercurrent and star-moon kingdom.

An organization like an assassin was something that couldn’t be stopped, so star-moon kingdom might as well join forces with an assassin organization.

The result of the alliance was that undercurrent could not assassinate star-moon kingdom’s serving officials and soldiers, and they had to pay a certain fee.

Therefore, the amount of money undercurrent could assassinate had always been very high.

“Yes, Dragon Spike, that damned dragon spike. He wants to make an enemy out of our undercurrent assassin organization. We absolutely can not let him off, absolutely can not!”

The old man lost his composure and roared in a low voice.

City Lord Liu was slightly silent. He knew about the dragon spike assassin organization. It was an assassin organization that had rendered even Lei Feihu of East Sea city helpless.

Star-moon kingdom was unwilling to see an assassin organization that dared to assassinate officials of star-moon kingdom.

However, this dragon spike had been hidden very well, and its strength was not simple. The kingdom had no choice but to ignore it.

But now, it had appeared in Bright Moon City!

“Go and report this matter to your leader and see what he says!”

City Lord Liu hesitated for a moment and said to the old man.

“It’s city Lord Liu. I’ll report it now...”

The Old Man’s face was somewhat pale as he hurriedly nodded and immediately contacted their master of undercurrent.

City Lord Liu sat there and knocked on the table. After hesitating for a moment, he took out his communication stone plate and also began to contact the palace.

The entire city Lord’s mansion was extremely quiet. Outside, countless people in Bright Moon City were discussing what had happened this morning.

The confrontation between the two major killer organizations and the pk between the old and new killer organizations undoubtedly made many people extremely excited.

Time slowly passed. Inside the city Lord’s mansion, the old man from Undercurrent’s face was already extremely pale.

“City Lord Liu, undercurrent will send out all our forces to deal with the Dragon Assassin organization. I hope that Sir will provide us with some convenience!”

The old man took a deep breath and respectfully said to city Lord Liu, “Our leader will rush over tomorrow!”

“Alright, don’t worry about this. I’ve also received news that I’ll assist you in eradicating the Dragon Assassin Organization!”

City Lord Liu’s eyes flickered.

Star-moon kingdom would never allow an uncontrollable assassin organization, one that dared to assassinate the mayor of a town, go against the City Lord, and assassinate city guards to appear.

In the past, they had no choice. But now, if they were to let the undercurrent take action, their assistance would be the best choice.

Using the undercurrent to deal with this tumor dragon spike.

This was the intention of star-moon kingdom’s royal family.

“Thank you, City Lord Liu. We will definitely make them pay a heavy price for this damn dragon Spike!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The old man bowed and growled in a low voice with a savage expression.

“Take your young master’s corpse away. I can provide you with all the information you need. As long as you are in bright moon city, I can find even an ant!”

City Lord Liu looked ahead with a face full of confidence. His eyes were incomparably cold!
