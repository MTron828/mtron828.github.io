3681 2,680 demons were mobilized

In the invincible region, because of a piece of information from the Mad Demon, countless old monsters were excited!

As time passed, news quickly spread throughout the invincible region!

Some old monsters confirmed on the universe’s AI that as long as there was a large number of normal birth fruits, it could indeed make powerful old monsters break the shackles of their realms!

Some old monsters also said that the Dragon Palace had the god Tree of normal birth fruits, and the Dragon King had a large number of normal birth fruits in his hands!

In short, all sorts of news quickly spread, almost reaching the ears of every old monster in the Invincible Zone!

“Boom Boom Boom!”

In the dark void of the Invincible Zone, an incomparably huge void beast skeleton floated in the Void!

From the inside of the giant skeleton, the sound of battle could be heard!

The terrifying black energy kept attacking the surroundings!

Dozens of black shadows could be vaguely seen fighting inside!

All of a sudden, strangely, all the shadows stopped fighting!

They moved and came to the head of the Void Beast!

There was an expert of the Dark clan standing there.

Black Shadows entered his body one by one!

These shadows were the avatars of the Dark Ghost!

Fifty to sixty shadows entered his body, but these shadows were only one-fifth of his!

“Taking the eternal fetus fruit, the hope of a breakthrough!”

He murmured, his blood-red eyes jumping continuously!

“This is my only hope, Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. It’s really expensive to trade five innate spiritual treasures for one eternal fetus fruit!”

The expert of the Dark Clan roared in a low voice.

“However, I must seize this opportunity, even if it means death!”

He continued and took out the universal AI.

His name was Ming Shisheng, an old monster from the invincible zone, an extremely terrifying existence!

He had hundreds of dark ghost bodies, and when they were unleashed at the same time, it was extremely terrifying!

Facing him was equivalent to facing hundreds of great beings of the same level.

How was he going to fight?

“Taking the eternal embryo fruit, looks like I’ll have to replace it!”

In another part of the void space in invincible region, this part of the void space was filled with violent and terrifying energy!

The storm of the void fissure swept through the surroundings, and the terrifying void storm could even tear apart an ordinary Level 3 universe master!

“I’m Here!”A demon bird spread its wings and said in the storm!

It flapped its wings slightly and took out the universe ai!

It was called demon wings, an ordinary name, but it was a mad demon!

“Is there really hope for a breakthrough? Is there really hope?”

In the chaotic space of the invincible zone, a yellowish stone man lying in the center of the meteorite opened his eyes, his expression excited!

He slowly stood up, and the tombstone-like meteorites directly collapsed. He quietly floated in the chaotic flow.

The massive meteorites hit his body and directly collapsed!

His name was Shi Sen, the Mad Demon of the Invincible Zone.

Not only these three places, but the old monsters of other places also looked at the information in their hands, their expressions extremely excited!

Some of the Mad Demons of the Invincible Zone were in a state of madness, but there were also some who used special methods to suppress themselves in order to prevent themselves from being in a state of madness!

But after receiving this news, none of the mad demons could sit still!

Not only the mad demons, some of the top experts of the invincible zone also couldn’t sit still!

Even if there was a one percent chance of breaking through, they would still fight for it with all their might!

Hence, all the mad demons and top-notch experts in the invincible zone started to move!

“Hu!”

Within the ancient god country of horizontal void, Wang Xian opened his eyes and smiled as he looked at the depleted resources ahead!

A month had passed. He had absorbed all the resources from the demon Raider Circle and the Divine Kingdom of the 150-ODD experts!

These resources were about 30% away from increasing his strength!

If I can obtain a few more resources from the Mad Demons, I should be able to increase my strength

Wang Xian calculated in his heart!

The strength of the mad demons was much stronger than that of a real master of the universe!

If he could make a breakthrough, he would have the strength of a Master of the universe at level two.

At that time, he would be even more terrifying!

Even if the Mad Demons of the Invincible Zone joined forces, Wang Xian would be able to destroy them!

“Eh, there’s a lot of information on the universe’s AI.”

At this moment, Wang Xian noticed the information on his universe’s AI and immediately opened it to take a look!

When he saw the contents, his eyes lit up!

There were many old freaks who contacted him, wanting to trade for the changtai fruit!

Wang Xian even received a message saying that they wanted to trade with him for the fruit!

“This…”

His eyes lit up.

There were many people who contacted him, a total of fifty to sixty people!

Furthermore, there were more people who wanted to trade!

At the very least, there were a dozen of them, and at the very most, there were dozens of them!

Wang Xian did not reply immediately. He opened the universe’s AI to check the situation.

From the looks of it, everything was related to the ingesting of the eternal fetus fruit and him.

The information regarding the Mad Demon Golden Roc before his death caused a huge commotion in the invincible zone!

Things were even crazier than what Wang Xian had imagined!

The importance of ingesting the eternal fetus fruit was even greater than what he had imagined!

Whoosh

At this moment, Wu Sha’s figure entered the interior.

“Dragon King, I’ve found the location of the water demon!”

Wu Sha reported to Wang Xian immediately!

“Oh? Have you found it?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows.

“This water demon is in the long river not far away from us. It only takes about ten minutes!”

Wu Sha nodded her head.

“Let’s go. Let’s get rid of this water demon first before dealing with other matters.”

He moved his body and flew out immediately!

The water demon had participated in the operation to attack him. It was an enemy that Wang Xian wanted to destroy!

After destroying him, not only would he be able to obtain the corpses of experts, he would also be able to obtain a lot of resources!

At this moment, he was not far from making another breakthrough.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Wu Sha moved and followed closely behind.

“It’s in that direction. The distance is very close!”

The two of them flew out of the inner part of the transverse void ancient divine kingdom and Wu Sha pointed in a direction!

Wang Xian’s energy wrapped around him and he sped up. Soon, he arrived in the sky above the long river! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

In less than ten minutes, he stopped in the air while Wu Sha pointed ahead.

“Water demon, it’s right there. Dragon King, if we get any closer, we will be discovered!”

Wu Sha warned!

“Make your move directly. Set up a formation at the back to prevent him from escaping!”

Wang Xian said. With a move of his palm, the five elements millstone appeared in his hand!

He flapped his incipient saint wings and flew rapidly into the long river!

As he got closer, Wang Xian immediately sensed the terrifying energy contained in the long river!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Four netherspirit avatars flew out from Wang Xian’s body and sealed off four different directions!
