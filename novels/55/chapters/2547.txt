Crack! Crack! Crack

The transformation of the strange creature in the dragon transformation pool was not over yet. His nine-colored dragon body slowly extended out!

The dragon body was not long. It was only about 20 meters long while the dragon tail was only two meters long!

Under Wang Xian’s senses, this dragon body was extremely weak. He could easily destroy it!

Crash! Crash

At this moment, the dragon blood in the dragon transformation pool surged into his body at a terrifying speed!

The Dragon Blood, which was enough to produce 500 to 600 undyings in the Dragon Palace and increase the combat strength of two to three level 6 undyings in the Dragon Palace, surged into that strange body!

When the dragon blood entered the body, the strange creature did not become bigger or smaller!

Other than the glow, Wang Xian did not notice that it had gotten stronger!

“The strength of my body is equivalent to an ordinary immortal king level 5!”

Wang Xian sensed it and frowned slightly!

“Roar!”

At this moment, the water elemental dragon in the middle raised its head and let out a roar. Its eyes opened slowly!

“Ding! Dragon Palace has added a new dragon species, dragon wizard dragon species. Congratulations, host!”

At this moment, the system’s voice suddenly rang out, causing Wang Xian to be slightly stunned!

A new dragon seed, Dragon Wizard?

“Dragon Wizard, a weak physical body with the ability to utilize the low-grade nine attributes. You are not allowed to fight beyond your level!”

Wang Xian looked at the introduction of the Dragon Wizard and his face instantly turned black!

Dragon Wizard, a weak physical body with the ability to utilize the low-grade nine attributes. You are not allowed to fight beyond your level!

This was the most useless dragon seed in the Dragon Palace, right?

“Hahahaha, hahahaha!”!

“I, the God of Heaven’s formation, have finally revived. I have finally revived. Hahaha, it has been millions of years. I have been silent for millions of years!”

“Members of the Witch Formation Association, Please Wait for me. Please wait for me, the God of Heaven’s formation, hahahaha!”

At this moment, a maniacal laughter and even a deranged voice rang out. Wang Xian looked over!

The water elemental dragon head in the middle had turned into a human head. It had the appearance of an old man. He had a long white beard and a long white head!

He looked like a celestial being!

However, his body looked extremely ferocious!

He had two strange arms, and each of his arms had four dragon heads!

Together with the dragon body and tail, he looked extremely strange!

“Oh?”

“What? Tian Chen God Emperor!”

However, Tian Chen God emperor’s words caused di Xing nu and Aunt Ying by the side to reveal an incredulous expression!

Tian Chen God Emperor, they knew exactly what kind of existence he was!

Back then, the Battle of Fallen Emperor had erupted in the Emperor Star Field. void God Emperor Tian Chen God Emperor had single-handedly fought against the three God emperors and the entire Magus Union!

That spot where the sun and Moon had no light changed color!

According to what they knew, there were hundreds of thousands of undying godly monarchs who had died. Most of them were existences above level five undying godly monarchs!

That was because the weaker ones were equivalent to cannon fodder!

That spot caused the resplendent starry sky to tremble!

In the end, Heaven Array God Emperor had fallen and the Magus Union had suffered heavy injuries!

Up until now, the Magus Union had yet to recover to its peak!

During that battle, tens of thousands of stars were destroyed!

However, this weird old man in front of him actually claimed to be the celestial emperor of Heaven’s formation!

This...

“Heaven’s formation, how... How did you create such a body?”

Wang Xian couldn’t help but interrupt when he saw the Laughing Celestial Emperor of Heaven’s formation!

“Dragon King!”

When the Celestial Emperor of Heaven’s formation saw Wang Xian, his face was filled with respect!

His body moved and flew towards Wang Xian!

“Dragon King, this body is perfect for me. It has the ability to sense all kinds of attributes!”

“With thousands of years of wisdom, I have turned my body into a wizard artifact. Although I only have the strength of a level five immortal king, I can feel that I am extremely powerful!”

“As long as I have sufficient resources, I will be even stronger than my previous self!”

The god of formation reported to Wang Xian excitedly!

“Transforming my body into a magic weapon?”

Wang Xian frowned slightly. The resources that the god of formation consumed this time could be said to be extremely terrifying. There should be something special about it!

...

“Is there any use for it?”

Wang Xian sized him up and asked!

“Dragon King, the strongest effect can increase the power of my formation and increase the speed of my formation. Although I am only at level five immortal king, I can fight and even kill a level seven immortal King!”

“And that is not the most important thing. The most important thing is that I feel that I still have a huge upper limit. The more formations I control, the more levels I can surpass. In the future, I can even surpass three or even four levels to fight and become a real wizard!”

The Celestial Emperor of Heaven’s formation said with some excitement!

“Is that so?”

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up!

“You, you, you... you are really the Celestial Emperor of Heaven’s formation, the Celestial Emperor of Heaven’s formation who is so awe-inspiring!”

At this moment, Di Xingnu walked over and asked him with a face full of disbelief!

“It’s me. I have been dead for thousands of years. I didn’t expect that someone would still remember my name!”

The Celestial Emperor of Heaven’s formation smiled and said to the Imperial Star Lady!

...

“This... This is simply unbelievable!”

The imperial star Lady widened her eyes while Aunt Ying’s body trembled slightly!

This was a legendary figure!

Now, he was right in front of them!

“As expected of a celestial emperor of a region. He possesses great wisdom. He actually created such a body and gave birth to a dragon with such potential in the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian sighed slightly in his heart!

“Alright, sky array. Since you have reconstructed your body, it’s time to get down to business!”

Wang Xian said to the sky array emperor with a smile on his face!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Sky array nodded. He had been following Wang Xian all this while. Naturally, he knew the plan!

Buzz

His body moved and transformed into an immortal-like old man. He landed respectfully beside Wang Xian!

“Dragon King, are we going to build a commercial planet next?”

Tian Chen asked with a smile!

“Yes, the most important thing to build a commercial planet is the defense and safety aspects. Of course, it’s best to have the design of the entire planet as well. Can you handle this?”

Wang Xian asked him directly!

“Dragon King, this is a small matter. Leave everything to me, Hehe!”

The Tiancheng God-emperor said confidently!

A void god-emperor who had lived for tens of millions of years and fallen for tens of millions of years. The things that he controlled were definitely not something that Wang Xian could imagine!

“Alright, prepare a plan immediately. The faster the commercial planet is built, the better!”

Wang Xian immediately instructed him!

“Yes!”

The Tiancheng god-emperor bowed and immediately flew into the distance!

With his elevation, the Dragon Palace would automatically assign him a dragon cave!

“Wang Xian, is He... is he really the celestial emperor of Tian Cheng who died thousands of years ago?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Seeing the Celestial Emperor of Tian Cheng leaving, di Xing came to Wang Xian’s side and asked again!

“How many times have you asked?”

Wang Xian looked at her speechlessly and patted her shoulder. “Follow me, Dragon King, and you’ll have a good life in the future!”

With that, he couldn’t help but laugh out loud!
