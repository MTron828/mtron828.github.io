Chapter 75: Even a Celebrity Must Queue

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

The First-grade Restaurant at night was not only fully occupied. Many people were also queuing in the waiting area near the entrance.

Many customers were gazing at the expensive world-class seafood.

When Lin Qingying walked into the restaurant, her brows slightly knit together as she looked inside.

The people were overwhelming such that the restaurant seemed overcrowded.

However, it was normal since the First-grade Restaurant was too famous.

Lin Qingying raised an eyebrow as she looked at the front desk staff. She asked the staff over at the counter, “Are there any seats available?”

“Nope. You can take a queue number. But I don’t recommend you wait if there are too many people in front of you,” the front desk staff said with a smile.

Lin Qingying frowned and continued, “Please get your boss here.”

“Hur? What’s the matter, babe?”

Wang Xian had just walked out of his office when he heard Lin Qingying. Hence, he looked at her with a puzzled look.

“Are you the boss over here?” Lin Qingying stared at Wang Xian with surprise.

“Yes, what’s the matter?” Wang Xian asked with a smile.

“Can you give me a seat? I would like to taste the delicacy of the First-grade Restaurant and the fish gelatine of the Chinese Bahaba fish!” Lin Qingying removed her sunglasses, revealing her look as she smiled at Wang Xian.

“Lin Qingying!”

When Lin Qingying took off her sunglasses, the staff at the side exclaimed and took her phone out for pictures.

Lin Qingying revealed a confident look as soon as she saw the reaction of the staff.

“Lin Qingying!” Wang Xian recognized the beauty in front of him. She was the renowned food celebrity who had taken part in the opening ceremony of Longxuan Restaurant this morning.

“Can we?” Lin Qingying raised her eyebrows slightly as she continued asking Wang Xian. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“How many people are there in the queue?” Wang Xian did not answer her. Instead, he asked the staff at the side.

“Director Wang, there are 25 more people in the queue!” The staff replied.

“25?” Wang Xian nodded and turned to the sexy Lin Qingying. Regretfully, he said, “I’m sorry, Miss Lin Qingying. There are 25 tables in front of you. I’m afraid today is not possible. Please come early tomorrow!”

Wang Xian had stunned Lin Qingying with his statement as she looked at him with disbelief.

Lin Qingying was not expecting such an answer from the other party. She was a celebrity–a food celebrity. Her presence in any restaurant would be its best publicity.

Yet, this young man had turned her down flat.

This was embarrassing to her. She looked at Wang Xian with radiance flickering in her eyes, “Do you know who I am?”

The question posed by Lin Qingying stunned Wang Xian. He chuckled and replied immediately, “What has that got to do with it?”

“You...” Wang Xian’s reply infuriated her, “You actually reject me from dining in here?”

Lin Qingying looked at Wang Xian with a dirty look.

In the past, all the managers or bosses would deliver their dishes personally wherever she had her meals. All of them were hoping to receive good reviews from her. If she could post their restaurant on her Weibo, that would be even better.

Yet, the First-grade Restaurant had the cheek to ask her to return tomorrow. This boiled the blood of the prideful girl.

“This beautiful lady over here has a funny way of talking, I guess? The restaurant is full now. If you want to have your food here, you can wait. But we’ll stop receiving guests at 9 pm. Till then, if it’s not your turn, too bad. Celebrities are all the same. They don’t get to enjoy any privilege here!”

Wang Xian looked at the prideful Lin Qingying and spoke to her impassively. Subsequently, he walked to the front desk, ignoring her.

Lin Qingying was infuriated, as her anger was written all over her face after hearing what Wang Xian said.

Some of the customers who were waiting spotted the commotion. When they saw Lin Qingying, all of them had a surprised look on their faces.

When they overheard the conversations between Lin Qingying and the boss, they were stupefied.

“The boss is really superb. You need to wait if you want to eat. That goes for the celebrities. The First-grade Restaurant doesn’t even need celebrities to promote them.”

“Lin Qingying...who would have thought that the boss would keep her waiting when she wants to dine in this restaurant? But yes, so what if you’re a star? The First-grade Restaurant is capable on their own without the need for any celebrities’ promotions!”

“The First-grade Restaurant lives up to its name. They are domineering. With such capability, you need to queue for their food even if you’re a food celebrity!”

Some customers praised Wang Xian for the way he dealt with the situation while some looked at him with a sneer.

There were several media members, not far away from them, who recorded down the scene with excitement on their faces.

They were not expecting to meet Lin Qingying when they were only here for the coverage of the First-grade Restaurant.

The news was simply too juicy. They already thought of ways to publicize it.

Headlines:

“Breaking news! Lin Qingying was told to wait in the queue by the boss when she was here for the food. Even celebrities need to queue. No privilege!”

Or...

“Shocking! The First-grade Restaurant is so capable that they do not need the celebrities’ promotion. So what if you are Lin Qingying, queue up!”

Lin Qingying had a complicated facial expression when she heard the surrounding comments.

“Qingying, let’s leave this place. The media are here too,” the assistant next to her said to her anxiously when she noticed the media snapping photos of them.

Lin Qingying took a deep breath. She put on her sunglasses and walked out, embarrassed.

Wang Xian lifted his head. As Lin Qingying departed, he had a faint disdainful look on his face.

So what if you are a star? Longxuan Restaurant might need publicity, but not First-grade Restaurant.

...

One by one, Wang Xian’s friends turned up at about 7 o’clock in the evening.

Old Qin brought along his wife, Qin Lianhui, as well as Little Kite. Four members from Old Xue’s family, including Xue Jing’s mother, were here. Lan Qingyue showed up too.

When Wang Xian had invited them over for a meal, both Old Xue and Old Qin agreed without any hesitation.

Guan Shuqing came over happily too.

“Today, I would like to invite everyone to have a taste of the food in the First-grade Restaurant.”

Wang Xian beamed at everyone as the dishes were brought to the table.

Looking at the dishes that were worth over a million on the table, Old Xue exclaimed, “Tsk tsk, Buddy Wang Xian, you’re too generous. Two-headed Abalone, Atlantic Bluefin Marlin sashimi, Wild Giant Yellow Croakers, and Chinese Bahaba fish’s gelatine soup. This is too extravagant!”

“This is the first time in my life to have such extravagant dishes. All thanks to Buddy Wang Xian,” Old Qin laughed out loud as he said to Wang Xian.

“I have to bring out the best when I’m hosting my friends. If not, that would be too stingy of me,” Wang Xian chuckled. “The fish gelatine of the Chinese Bahaba fish is good for the ladies. It enhances the beauty and enriches the blood flow.”

“Xiao Xian, you’re sincere in buying us a meal!” Lan Qingyue, who was sitting on the left of Wang Xian, laughed as she said.

“Hehe, it’s half price today. I don’t feel bad with some orders!” Wang Xian joked while Guan Shuqing on his right smiled.

“Buddy Wang Xian and the two beauties over here, let’s have a toast. In the future, you can look for me if you need any help. The Qin Family will definitely help you out.”

“Thank you, Grandpa Qin!” Both Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue quickly raised their glasses.

Wang Xian and the rest of the people finished their drinks in a gulp. The Xue Family and the Qin Family were great friends.

It was only courteous to reciprocate their friendship. Wang Xian bought them a meal to strengthen their bond.

On the other hand, the two influential families, Qin and Xue Families, were very happy to befriend Wang Xian.
