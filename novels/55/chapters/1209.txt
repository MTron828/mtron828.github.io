Chapter 1210: The name of Sword Demon No. 1,2

Translator: 5496903

When the crowd around saw this scene, they were stunned.

They looked at the lonely young man with sympathy.

He had saved someone and ended up harming himself. This was simply...

Furthermore, everyone felt some contempt for Miss Zhou’s cold and heartless behavior.

However, some of them also understood why Miss Zhou would do such a thing. It was for the sake of their own future.

If a man doesn’t do it for himself, the heavens will destroy him!

“You are really ungrateful!”

When Wang Xian saw this scene, a look of disdain appeared in his eyes.

In the supernatural continent, where the strong were respected, all desires appeared to be naked.

“Kid, if you dare to steal a woman from me, Meng Shaoqin, you will only become a corpse!”

When Meng Shaoqin heard the discussions of the people around him, his expression did not change at all. He stared at the young man in tattered clothes and said coldly.

In this world, as long as one was strong enough, they could ignore everything.

The brutal and ferocious dragon race, which ruled over everything, had once massacred hundreds of millions of humans and dozens of demonic beast races.

But now, when it came to the dragon race, there was only respect and no condemnation.

This was the strong.

There was no need to pay attention to the eyes of the weak.

“I have no enmity with you. If you want to kill me, then come!”

The shabby-clothed young man’s gaze swept past Zhou Yanmei. His gaze was incomparably cold as he stared at Meng Shaoqin. With a wave of his hand, a two meter long greatsword appeared in his hand.

“Oh? A void interpretation level greatsword!”

“Haha!”

When the shabby-clothed young man took out the Greatsword in his hand, Meng Shaoqin was slightly taken aback. Soon after, an excited expression appeared on his face and he couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“I didn’t expect that a wild kid like you would actually have a void interpretation level greatsword. This is great, this is great!”

He laughed, and his eyes stared greedily at the greatsword.

“Hiss, I didn’t expect that such a ragged looking guy would actually have a void interpretation level weapon!”

“This... This Meng Shaoqin’s group’s luck is really good!”

The surrounding people were slightly stunned, and their gazes were also somewhat heated as they stared at the greatsword that contained a terrifying power.

Many people’s eyes also revealed an incomparably greedy expression. However, after looking at Meng Shaoqin and the others, many people dispelled this thought.

However, in the surroundings, two profound void tier first level experts looked over, their eyes flickering.

A profound void tier first level weapon was worth at least 20 to 30 billion mid-grade spirit stones. This was a huge sum of money to a profound void tier expert.

“Go! Kill him! Take the weapon from his hands!”

Meng shaoqin shouted excitedly to the surrounding people.

“Yes!”

Behind him, there were more than a dozen people. Among them, one was a half-step void interpretation expert, three were at the ninth rank of the extraordinary realm, and the rest were at the seventh or eighth rank of the extraordinary realm.

These were all the elites of the Meng family.

“Keke, Kid, put the weapon in your hands on the ground and commit suicide. We’ll leave your corpse intact!”

A middle-aged man stared coldly at the young man in tattered clothes and roared ferociously.

“Damn you, it’s all of you!”

The young man in tattered clothes shot out an intense killing intent from his eyes. He held his greatsword with both hands and charged forward.

“Kill him!”

The half-step void interpretation expert snorted coldly and threw his gloved arms forward.

“Die!”

The people behind him also launched their attacks.

“That young man is going to die in the hands of the Meng clan. How Pitiful!”

“It’s not just pitiful, he’s extremely unlucky!”

When the people around saw this scene, they discussed coldly.

“Hehe, this group of people wants to kill him. They are really courting death!”

Wang Xian, who was standing outside, watched this scene with interest.

The young man in tattered clothes was the fated person whom Wang Xian had met.

He was a dual-elemental cultivator of metal and water, a young man at level nine of the supernatural realm.

Now that he had obtained the inheritance of the metal and water sword principle, even though his strength was still at level nine of the supernatural realm, he was able to fight against a half-step void interpretation stage powerhouse.

If he were to combine this with the great sword of level one of the metal and water dual-elemental void interpretation stage in his hand, he would be able to kill the middle-aged man who had just stepped into the half-step void interpretation stage.

“Water Sword!”

At this moment, the young man in tattered clothes charged forward, the great sword in his hand emitting a blue light.

A blue great sword that was 10 meters in size condensed from water energy charged forward.

In the center of this blue great sword, there were dozens of small golden swords.

An attack looked extremely strange.

The water sword directly faced the Meng clan’s attack.

“Buzz!”

When the water sword collided with the attacks, ripples appeared.

The golden sword inside exploded, and the blue sword-shaped water energy on the outside also exploded.

Under the sunlight, it emitted a beautiful light.

The exploding water swords turned into small blue swords, and their speed suddenly increased several times as they charged forward.

“What?”

When they felt the blue water swords, the expressions of the members of the Meng clan changed drastically.

“Be careful!”

The half-step void interpretation expert of the Meng clan’s expression changed drastically, and he immediately warned loudly.

“Blue dazzling sword!”

The young man in tattered clothes didn’t change his expression. The large sword in his hand emitted a dazzling blue light. The blue light was even more dazzling than the sun, and it illuminated a radius of more than a thousand meters.

Divine ability, blue radiant sword! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Ahhhh!”

At this moment, a scream sounded.

The half-step void interpretation expert wanted to save his clansmen, but when he saw the second attack, his expression changed.

“How is this possible? He’s clearly at transcendent level 9. How can he release such a terrifying attack? !”

He was shocked and quickly blocked it. In the surroundings, other than him and the other three transcendent level 9 experts, they died under the water sword.

The other 3 Type 9 transcendents had also activated their defensive abilities to barely defend, their faces filled with fear

“Bastard, Kill!”

When the half-step void interpretation expert saw that half of his tribesmen had been killed, his face was filled with rage. His body moved, and he charged towards the young man in tattered clothes.

The other 3 Type 9 transcendents had solemn expressions as they charged forward.

They had never expected that a kid who looked like a wild mountain would actually possess such terrifying strength.

“What? Damn it, he clearly has the strength of a transcendent-level rank 9, how could he erupt with such terrifying strength? It must be because of the void interpretation weapon in his hands. Kill him, kill him!”

Meng Shaoqin’s expression changed drastically when he saw that more than ten of his subordinates had been killed in an instant. He roared loudly.

His eyes became even more fervent as he stared at the huge sword.

Zhou Yanmei’s gaze flickered when she saw his incomparably ferocious appearance. However, her gaze slowly turned cold.

“If you want to kill me, then I will kill you!”

“Jin Fa!”

The young man in tattered clothes was like a violent tsunami. With a loud roar, he cast another divine ability.

Jin Fa!

Metal attribute divine ability.

“What? He was clearly casting a water-type divine ability just now. Why did he suddenly cast a metal-type divine ability? !”

“A dual-element cultivator of metal and water. My God, this is a monster, a dual-element cultivator!”
