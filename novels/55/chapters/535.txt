Chapter 536: A Real Man Faces A Strong Opponent Directly (1)

“Why aren’t Sect Leader Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi here yet? The arranged timing for their battle is about to start!”

“The experts will always be the last to appear. Don’t be anxious. When the time is here, these two unprecedented experts will appear out of nowhere!”

“Those from Diabolism are really disgusting. Look at them. He has snakes as his hair! How disgusting is that?!”

“Those are people from Cursed Venom. Among the devil sects, Cursed Venom can kill without leaving any traces. You should be careful. Otherwise, you might be assassinated before you know about it!”

“Where is the Dragon King from the Dragon Sect? I heard that people from both the alliance of the orthodox sects and Diabolism want to kill the Dragon King. As such, there will be two battles of the ages today!”

“The Dragon King is too unruly and fearless. The moment they arrived, they annihilated the Crimson Bug. They have truly made enemies with the entire Underworld!”

Wang Xian had just arrived at the bottom of the tallest peak in Huashan. The moment he stepped in, he heard all kinds of discussions. His lips curved into a smile as he looked across.

At the bottom of the tallest peak of Huashan, there were clearly two separate camps.

The orthodox sects and Diabolism.

Wang Xian smiled and walked towards the middle of the two camps. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

There weren’t any people there and it could be considered as the separating line of the two camps. Now that Wang Xian had walked in this direction, the underlying meaning was clear to all.

“Dragon King of the Dragon Sect!”

“The Dragon King!”

When Wang Xian led over two hundred people over, the bottom of the tallest peak of Huashan instantly went silent.

Around him, there were at least a hundred thousand people distributed densely across the bottom of the peak. Those weaker or smaller sects and families could only stand and watch from a far distance.

The arrival of Wang Xian and the Dragon Sect instantly attracted the attention of the entire crowd.

The separation line wasn’t broad at all initially. However, the forces from Diabolism instantly retreated as Wang Xian and the Dragon Sect stepped ahead.

A first-class force from the alliance of orthodox sects also instinctively retreated a little.

No matter if they were from the alliance of orthodox sects or Diabolism, they were all fearful and wary of the Dragon King from the Dragon Sect.

“Is the Dragon Sect considered to be the third camp now?”

“Damn! The instant the Dragon Sect arrived, those at the edge from both Diabolism and the alliance of orthodox sects instinctively moved away to make space for them!”

“I finally get to see the Dragon King. He’s really young! Too young!”

The entire crowd had looked towards where Wang Xian was standing. There were roughly two hundred people behind him. At the same time, soft discussions were happening everywhere.

“Dragon King, you will die a horrible death soon!” Suddenly, an angry roar reverberated and shocked the crowd.

The crowd looked over. In the direction of the Devil Corpse Palace, two old men in blood-red outfits were glowering at Wang Xian.

One of the old men had a non-human eye. A terrifying feeler extended out and stared creepily ahead.

The other old man had a blood-red spider on him.

Both of them were glowering at Wang Xian with deep hatred.

“That’s the sect leader and vice sect leader of Crimson Bug!”

“The sect leader and vice sect leader of the Crimson Bug came with the Devil Corpse Palace. In the end...”

A few discussions broke out from the side from several disciples of devil sects.

Wang Xian looked to the two old men, revealed a smile and commented, “In that case, come and take my life!”

“Dragon King, don’t be so arrogant. I, Yan Chong, will definitely let my bloody bugs devour all the flesh on your body!”

The sect leader of Crimson Bug clenched his fist tightly as his eyes turned bloodshot.

Hehe!

Wang Xian smiled with ridicule. He crossed his arms and didn’t pay attention to the remaining members of the Crimson Bug.

“Abyss... Dragon Sect!”

At the location of Heavenly Sound Sect, several experts looked a little bitter.

The disciples of the Abyss being the disciples of the Dragon Sect had been deduced by others when they went to kill the experts from Dong Hua Sacred Sect.

Heavenly Sound Sect had obviously obtained this information. Recalling the time when the Abyss invaded Heavenly Sound Sect to kill their Saint and granddaughter of the vice sect leader, they gritted their teeth and their eyes were as cold as ice.

“Dragon King of the Dragon Sect! Just wait for me!”

Where Dong Hua Sacred Sect was standing, the Lord of Sea Serpent Island stood there with a gloomy expression. Beside him, there were fifteen other Inborn experts other than his son.

This was the full strength of Sea Serpent Island.

The experts from Dong Hua Sacred Sect standing nearby also stared coldly at Wang Xian.

Wang Xian could sense dense killing intent coming towards him. Ruthlessness gleamed in his eyes.

He wasn’t in a hurry. After the battle between Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi, it would be time for him to address these grievances.

The intense battle would definitely result in severe injuries or even death. Both parties might suffer severe injuries at the same time too.

When the time came, he would be able to deal with the entire Underworld and Diabolism with Roving Sword, the five Dan Realm experts, and over two hundred Inborn experts that had come with him.

He could just kill those who weren’t convinced of his strength at that point.

Wang Xian looked across the entire crowd of the Sacred Clan and Sects behind Dong Hua Sacred Sect, Devil Corpse Palace, Devil Spirits Temple, Reeds Spirits, Crimson Bug and many other forces.

“Nie Wushuang, I’m here!”

Suddenly, a thunderous roar erupted in the sky. An unruly voice came from a far distance away. The voice reverberated with tumbling tumultuous clouds and a man in a black outfit flew over from the North.

The man resembled a middle-aged man. His skin tone was a little black and his hair had reached his waist.

Behind him, he carried a black coffin. The person in the black coffin resembled a corpse that had been dead for ten thousand years and had no expression.

Streams of black aura circled around him gradually.

The man took step after step in the air as though he was taking a casual stroll. However, he covered several hundreds of meters with each step.

He was insanely fast.

The man stopped above the Devil Corpse Palace and waited silently.

“Emperor Qi!”

Everyone in Diabolism bowed down and greeted the man respectfully.

Some experts of Diabolism were beaming with fear and respect. He was the equivalent of a god in their eyes.

“I’m here too!”

When the middle-aged man stood before the devil sects, sounds of metal clashing resounded from afar.

Just like a comet leaving a trail as it cut across the sky, a man crossed the sky over Huashan.

It was an old man shrouded in faint golden light. His hair was a little unkempt and he had violent and unruly vibes around him.

His arms were of a dull-gold shade and were glowing faintly.

Behind him, he carried a long sword. The longsword spanned 1.6 meters and was exceptionally tough.

On it, there were two other palm-sized rings.

“Sect Leader Nie!”

Nie Wushuang arrived, stood above the Dong Hua Sacred Sect and stared at Emperor Qi.

Below him, all the martial artists in the Underworld, including Dan Realm experts from all other Sacred Clans and Sects, lowered their bodies and greeted Nie Wushuang with great respect.

Emperor Qi of Diabolism was the strongest expert in Diabolism. All of Diabolism was willing to pay respects to him.

Similarly, Nie Wushuang was the same for the orthodox sects.

This was respect for the two supreme experts in current times.

Over a hundred thousand people paid respect to these two experts.

The only exception was Wang Xian who crossed his arms and stood in the middle. With a face of smiles, he stood upright and looked towards Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi.

I’ve got to say that the appearances of the two of them would be even cooler with BGM!
