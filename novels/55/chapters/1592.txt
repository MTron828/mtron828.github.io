Chapter 1593: 1593. The destruction of the Iceheart dynasty

“There will be no more Iceheart dynasty in this world!”

In the Iceheart Imperial City, everyone looked at the two black shadows in the sky. Their hearts were filled with shock and fear.

The Iceheart dynasty, which had stood for ten thousand years, had fallen just like that.

It had fallen at the hands of a young man.

It was all because of a woman.

Everyone in the Bingxin Empire was in a daze. The smell of blood permeated the entire city and countless corpses lay on the ground.

The bingxin lake was like blood and the sky was like blood.

“Gather all the resources in the Bingxin Imperial City and leave!”

Wang Xian returned to his human form. In order to balance the light and darkness, his body emitted a faint aura of light.

His holy appearance made him look like a saint who was not from the mortal world. Even a glance at him would make one feel extremely comfortable.

However, it was this kind of person who had just destroyed an entire first-rate strength and a powerful empire.

“It’s boss Devil!”

The stooped old man looked at Wang Xian’s appearance and felt slightly uncomfortable. He nodded immediately and flew towards the Royal Palace of the Bingxin Empire.

Wang Xian waved his arm and all the corpses on the ground were stored into his interspatial ring.

It was impossible for him to not want the resources of a first-rate force after destroying it.

He could even increase the strength of the entire Dragon Palace by relying on this resource.

Half an hour later, Wang Xian and the hunchbacked old man left the royal palace of Bingxin.

At this moment, the rest of the people in the royal palace of Bingxin dared to stand up. They looked at the two disappearing figures with fear on their faces.

However, at that moment, the news of the Iceheart Empire’s destruction immediately spread throughout the vast region.

Especially in the divine kingdom ruins, everyone was in an uproar.

“This... A Skyfiend destroyed a first-rate faction. This is simply unbelievable!”

“Even if a skyfiend killed the supreme elder of the lone sect and destroyed the Iceheart Empire, it is still shocking!”

“As expected of the Sky Demon, the Eternal Bingxin Empire is not a Sky Demon!”

“The Bingxin Empire lost its 10,000-year foundation because of a woman. How Ironic!”

“They might have thought that priest Wang was easy to bully. In the end, they didn’t expect him to be a sky demon. TSK TSK, he brought this upon himself!”

In the entire ruins of the divine kingdom, everyone was discussing the matter of Wang Xian destroying the bingxin empire.

As for the powerful faction, they were thinking more.

The Bingxin Empire’s strength was not considered weak among first-rate factions. Even so, it was still destroyed.

Even the imperial city was destroyed.

One could imagine the strength of the Sky Demon.

It was not an exaggeration to say that the sky demon’s strength alone was comparable to a first-rate faction.

“If Skyfiend can survive, it will truly shock the entire vast region!”

Everyone thought to themselves.

Skyfiend had destroyed the Iceheart Empire, destroyed the soleway sect’s base in the divine kingdom ruins, and killed the Grand Elder and a group of core disciples and elders.

This was a huge provocation to the soleway sect.

This time, even the soleway sect’s supreme sect leader and the soleway sect’s ancestor would take action.

It was hard to say if the skyfiend would be able to survive this.

...

“It has been more than ten thousand years. No one has dared to provoke our solitaire sect, right?”

At that moment, in the solitaire peak of the vast Solitaire Mountains, an elder was sitting in the hall with an expressionless face.

The Solitaire Mountains were formed from a total of 108 green mountains that were ten thousand meters tall. Every mountain peak was majestic and magnificent.

In particular, the supreme mountain peak in the middle was like a giant between heaven and earth, looking down on the entire land.

In the Grand Hall of the Supreme Mountain Peak, more than 100 people stood in the hall.

At this moment, the atmosphere in the hall was somewhat solemn.

The voice of the old man sitting at the top, which didn’t have the slightest bit of emotion, caused everyone’s hearts to tremble.

“It has been 11,231 years since someone dared to provoke us like this!”

Below, an old man with a head full of white hair said faintly.

“11,231 years ago, what was the outcome of provoking us? At that time, we didn’t even exist. However, I really want to know the outcome of that faction!”

The old man at the very top slowly asked.

“If I remember correctly, they implicated the nine clans. Anything related to them should all be exterminated!”

The white-haired elder below said slowly.

“Then we will follow the actions of our ancestors. We can not lose the face of our ancestors!”

The elder at the top said slowly.

“Supreme sect master, we have already obtained all the information about the Heavenly Devil King’s priest. He comes from the flowing sea region, and the current largest faction in the flowing sea region has a great relationship with him!”

“The most outstanding young man in the He clan now has a very good relationship with him, and Bing Jian ‘er...”

A middle-aged man beside him stood out and said with a frown.

“Announce to the world that in seven days, ao Tian and Bing Jian ‘er will hold a wedding and invite all the forces to come!”

“If that Sky Demon appears, kill him on the spot. If he doesn’t appear, kill he yuan of the He clan. After that, I will personally head to the flowing sea region and pay tribute to the disciples of our supreme headmaster with billions of lives!”

The elder at the front was naturally the supreme sect leader of the sect.

He announced to everyone with an expressionless face.

Upon hearing the supreme sect leader’s announcement, the more than a hundred experts of the sect were not surprised.

“It’s the supreme sect leader!”

Everyone cupped their hands respectfully.

When the Sky Demon dared to destroy the base in the ruins of their divine kingdom, when the Sky Demon dared to kill the disciples of the sect.

His fate, as well as the fate of everyone around him, had already been decided.

This was the truth, this was order.

The order of the solipsistic sect.

No one was angry, no one was furious.

There was always someone who wanted to die.

Whether it was pastor Wang or the Sky Demon, in the eyes of the solipsistic sect, it was the same!

Dead people!

“Reporting to the supreme sect master, the Patriarch of the Bingxin dynasty is here!”

At this moment, a middle-aged man came in and reported loudly.

“Eh? There are still people alive in the Bingxin dynasty? Let him in!”

The Supreme Leader said lightly.

“Supreme Leader, you have to make a decision for the Bingxin Dynasty!”

A sorrowful voice was heard. Bing FA Wu brought Bing Jing Huan to the hall and said with a sorrowful face.

Bing Jing Huan escaped in advance and was met by Bing FA Wu along the way. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“We have already learned about what happened in your Bingxin dynasty. It’s just right. In seven days, you will attend as Bing Jian ‘ER’s family!”

“As for your Bingxin dynasty, in the future, our only sect will help you reclaim your city and ensure your safety for five thousand years!”

The supreme headmaster said indifferently.

Bing FA Wu and Bing Jing were slightly stunned. Then, their expressions became much better. They quickly bowed and said, “Thank you, Supreme Headmaster!”

“Alright, let’s Go!”

The supreme headmaster waved his hand at everyone.

“Yes!”

Everyone immediately left. The supreme headmaster sat at the top and looked at the information in front of him.

“If it wasn’t for the existence of the holy tree in the He clan, this matter would be enough to exterminate the entire he clan!”

His mumbling voice rang out, and his figure instantly disappeared from his seat.

The tyranny of the solipsistic sect was so terrifying!
