Chapter 1353: In the 1353 kingdom war

Before king one leaf could finish his sentence, a servant sent an urgent message from outside. His voice resounded throughout the entire hall.

The king of the one leaf continent dynasty was stunned. The officials and generals in the hall were also stunned.

“Boom!”

“An unknown force has invaded us. I want to see which force dares to invade my one leaf continent Dynasty!”

One leaf king’s expression was extremely cold, and a terrifying killing intent shot out from his body. “Follow me. Anyone who dares to disrespect us, kill them all!”

As one leaf king spoke, his body moved, and he disappeared from the throne.

“Go, anyone who dares to invade our one leaf continent dynasty, die!”

“I want to see what kind of force dares to invade us, and they don’t know whether they are dead or Alive!”

In the Great Hall, the generals flew out one by one, followed by the civil and military officials.

The one leaf kingdom was one of the top existences among the dozens of nearby countries.

All along, no one had dared to provoke them.

Now that a force had invaded them, they were simply courting death!

“Boom! Boom!”

Void interpretation experts flew toward the north gate city wall with terrifying auras.

The one-leaf King was at the front. When he arrived at the north gate city wall, the troops of the Dragon Palace had already arrived.

“Which force dares to intrude into the territory of our one-leaf dynasty without any respect? Do You Know Your Crime?”

The one-leaf King looked at the black clouds in front of him, and more than a thousand creatures were hovering in the sky aggressively.

They were not friendly.

The one-leaf King didn’t show any signs of weakness. He looked at everyone in front of him coldly.

There were nine terrifying creatures that were about 30 meters long. There was a young man sitting on a huge dragon chair.

A group of demonic beasts.

He narrowed his eyes slightly.

“Are all of you here?”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly.

“You are the king of the one-leaf mainland dynasty? Two days ago, the princess and elder Wang of Your dynasty offended my dragon palace. They were killed!”

“Today, My Dragon Palace is here to destroy you!”

Prime Minister Gui raised his head slightly and looked down at the king of the one-leaf kingdom, explaining coldly.

His tone was full of judgment!

“What? You Bastards Killed My Daughter?”

“Elder Wang? Elder Wang was killed by them!”

“One day ago, the sky island kingdom was attacked by a mysterious force. Could it be them?”

As soon as Prime Minister Gui finished speaking, the expressions of the one leaf king and all the generals and important officials behind him instantly darkened.

This was especially so for the one leaf king. His eyes were bloodshot as his killing intent soared into the sky.

“You want to destroy our one leaf continent dynasty? Haha, with Just You Guys? Good, good. You Dare to kill my daughter and an expert from our one leaf continent dynasty. Today, I want to see who will destroy who!”

The one leaf dynasty’s king waved his arm, and a scepter appeared in his hand.

“All the generals of the one leaf dynasty and all the experts in the Imperial City, Fight for me!”

He roared, and his voice resounded throughout the entire imperial city.

“It’s the King’s voice! is someone invading our country? You’re courting death. Let’s go and kill them!”

“The king has given the order. All the forces, go immediately. Damn it, who dares to invade us!”

“The roar of the ferocious beast just now was actually from a faction that has invaded us. Head over to meet the enemy and kill them!”

In the other three directions, some factions and families heard the king’s order. Their faces turned cold as they quickly flew towards the north gate.

The imperial city was their home. Once their home was forced, they would suffer huge losses.

Moreover, the dynasty had a rule that during a war, all families and powerhouses had to participate. Otherwise, they would be killed immediately after the war!

Under the circumstances where their own interests and safety were at stake, over a million people in the entire imperial city started to move.

In a vast and mighty manner, all the martial artists who were above the level of the void interpretation realm gathered in the direction of the north gate.

“Warriors of the Dragon Palace, prepare for battle!”

When Wang Xian saw King Yi Ye’s order, the entire imperial city started to move.

More than a million people flew over. The dark mass of warriors exuded an icy cold aura.

A cold look appeared in his eyes. The five elements grinding mill condensed into a kingdom and slowly floated above his head as he shouted loudly.

“Roar, Roar, Kill!”

An orderly roar and an earth-shattering killing cry resounded across the sky. His powerful aura rose to its peak.

“King, the other party’s strength isn’t weak. There are quite a few profound void tier experts, and there are at least two fourth level profound void tier experts. We have to be careful!”

What happened at the Sky Island Empire caused them to be slightly wary.

An old man walked to the side of one leaf king and said solemnly.

“Imperial uncle, with you and I here, and this is still our territory, no fear!”

The king of one leaf did not lose his mind because his daughter was killed. He stared ahead coldly.

“Prepare the city defense equipment!”

He shouted softly.

“Yes!”

“Crack Crack Crack!”

On the surrounding city walls, there were metal equipment that were more than ten meters in size. The equipment was emitting a huge shiny arrow.

“Get rid of these damn things for me. Fire!”

King Yi Ye roared loudly. The surrounding city defense weapons were emitting a dazzling golden glow as they attacked Wang Xian and the rest who were in the sky.

These city defense weapons were released together. They were able to threaten experts at the insightful void tier.

“Fight!”

Wang Xian saw the other party’s attack and shouted softly.

“Woo Woo Woo Woo!”

Just as Wang Xian finished his words, an excited sound wave came from the center of the Dragon Palace.

The sound wave entered the ears of every warrior of the Dragon Palace, causing his aura to rise once again.

In the sky, the black clouds that had gathered in a five-kilometer radius suddenly moved slowly towards the imperial city of the one leaf continent.

Splash

Raindrops fell downwards. Some of them were emitting blue raindrops while others were pitch-black raindrops. It looked extremely strange.

The sound waves and black clouds all came from the Dolphin clan.

This was the first time that the powerful support of the Dolphin clan had been used in a war.

“The battle has erupted!”

“The enemy only has more than a thousand creatures. More than a thousand of them want to attack our imperial city and court death!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Let’s go and see how those reckless creatures were killed by the King!”

Behind the Imperial City of the one leaf continent, some martial artists had just arrived at the north gate. When they saw the more than one thousand creatures in the sky, their eyes revealed a look of disdain.

“We have millions of people. Even if each of US launches an attack, the insightful void martial artists will have to resist all of us. More than one thousand creatures dare to attack our one leaf continent empire. They are courting death!”

In front of the north gate, millions of people were floating in the sky.

With so many people, they could not interfere at all.

At first, they thought that the intruders would be very powerful. However, there were only a thousand or so creatures, and they did not take them seriously at all.

One had to know that the demon beasts and ferocious beasts that had attacked cities in the past were millions or even tens of millions.

More than a thousand creatures still wanted to attack them?

You’re courting death!
