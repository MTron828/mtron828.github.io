Chapter 1377: 1377 fire-gold dragon seed

A grand ceremony had allowed more than 60 city lords, the Dongxu family’s forces in the dragon-phoenix dynasty, and the other powerful forces to truly witness the queen’s splendor.

As the former empress, she was in charge of more than a few hundred cities. Whether it was her broad vision or her aloof aura, it was not something that a dongxu expert could compare to.

In the eyes of all the city lords and powerhouses present, their former king was far inferior to the dragon and Phoenix Queen.

It was as if they were on a completely different level.

Under the respectful gazes of everyone, Feng Luan formulated one plan after another and implemented one policy after another.

Under the combination of grace and power, the hearts of the entire dynasty quickly gathered.

Wang Xian and the rest sat at the side and watched with smiles on their faces. To be able to become an eternal empress, Feng Luan’s talent was unparalleled throughout history.

The Golden Swordfish clan and the Heavenly Eye Arrow Division stood on both sides, intimidating everyone in terms of martial prowess.

It also let people know that there was a powerful force behind the dragon-phoenix dynasty.

“Feng Luan, are you going to the auction in Xiaoyao City?”

After the grand ceremony of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire ended, Wang Xian sat leisurely in Feng Luan’s imperial study and asked her.

“I can’t leave for the time being. There are many matters in the dragon and Phoenix Empire that need me to take care of. Furthermore, I have to inspect every city one by one!”

“In addition, the various competitions organized by the Dragon and Phoenix Empire have to be carried out as well!”

Feng Luan shook her head with a smile on her face.

The Dragon and Phoenix Empire was more than ten times stronger today. It could be said that she had taken a huge step on the path of revenge today.

“Shu Qing, what about the few of you? Are you going to Xiao Yao City with me or not?”

Wang Xian nodded and looked at the few girls.

“Of course, I’m going to follow sister Feng Luan to one city after another. Haha!”

“When the time comes, we can go to more than sixty cities as the Cabinet Ministers of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire!”

“We can eat all the delicious food and drinks in all the cities. Just thinking about it makes me very happy!”

The group of girls said with a fiery gaze.

Feng Luan was currently in charge of more than 60 cities. Every city in the transcendence continent was incomparably huge.

Every place had its own unique characteristics. Naturally, there was a variety of food and drinks.

Now, they were going to the cities with a distinguished status. They could enjoy delicious food and drinks and enjoy different sceneries.

Naturally, they were unwilling to accompany Wang Xian to the carefree imperial city!

“Alright, Alright. If you guys don’t want to go, I’ll Go By Myself!”

Wang Xian nodded his head speechlessly. “You guys will lead some dragon guards and strange demon and the rest!”

“It’s alright. No one in the dragon and Phoenix Empire dares to disrespect us. Furthermore, our strength isn’t weak either!”

The few girls said with a smile.

Wang Xian nodded his head. Now, all the powerful forces in the entire dragon and Phoenix Empire knew the identities of the few girls.

No one dared to provoke them.

The faction that Wang Xian displayed this time not only shocked the powerhouses in more than 60 cities.

Even Feng Luan was astonished.

There were more than 60 void interpretation realm powerhouses than there were during the Great War more than ten days ago!

“Alright, Xiaoyao City is not close to us. I will set off in a while!”

Wang Xian nodded and said to them.

Xiaoyao city was close to the Dragon and Phoenix Empire. Based on his speed, it would take at least three days.

Wang Xian was prepared to set off today.

“Here, these are things that are not needed in the empire. I will give them all to you!”

Feng Luan handed him an interspatial ring. There were many treasures inside.

Wang Xian took a look and saw that there were at least trillions of middle-grade spirit stones inside.

He didn’t stand on ceremony and kept it.

If all the items in his hand were converted into resources, it would add about 700 to 800 million dragon crystals to him.

It wasn’t a lot, but it was definitely not a small amount.

“Alright, I’ll head back to the Dragon Palace first before I set off. You guys have fun!”

Wang Xian said to the group of girls before flying straight to the Dragon Palace.

After returning to the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian brought all the treasures that he couldn’t use. He led the four Dragon Guards and the four strange demons and flew directly in the direction of Xiaoyao City.

From the name of Xiaoyao City, one could tell that it was a neutral city.

It was built by the top-notch Master of Xiaoyao City. The entire city was one of the top cities in the flowing sea region.

The mayor of Xiaoyao City would hold an auction every five years, inviting all the major forces around.

The weakest force that could participate in this auction had three to four profound void realm experts.

The value of the items in each auction was over ten trillion middle-grade spirit stones.

Moreover, the auction that was held once every five years attracted many small forces and individual experts to Xiaoyao city. As time passed, Xiaoyao City became a huge material exchange place.

Here, it was claimed that one could buy anything one wanted.

Flying in the sky in the wild, one would occasionally encounter some beasts of the insightful void tier.

Wang Xian did not hesitate at all and killed them directly.

After resting for four days, an incomparably huge city finally appeared in Wang Xian’s sight.

The city was slightly bigger than the dragon and Phoenix Empire. It looked much more majestic than the dragon and Phoenix Imperial City.

The entire Xiaoyao city was not located on flat ground. Instead, it was located on top of a mountain.

Behind it was a mountain peak that was 10,000 meters tall.

A waterfall that was 10,000 meters tall fell from the top of the mountain. It was a spectacular sight!

There was only one entrance to Xiaoyao city. The ground was paved with gold. From Afar, it looked magnificent!

“There are so many people!”

Before Wang Xian got close, he noticed that he could bump into groups of people from time to time in the surrounding sky.

When he arrived a few thousand meters in front of Xiaoyao city, he saw more than 10,000 people walking towards Xiaoyao city from afar.

Each of them looked extraordinary.

Apart from humans, he also saw many demonic beast races!

At a glance, Wang Xian even saw at least a dozen insightful emptiness realm experts.

“As expected of the top-notch city within a 100,000-kilometer radius. The king’s auction in Xiaoyao City, which is held once every five years, is equivalent to a grand event within a 100,000-kilometer radius!”

Wang Xian sighed in his heart. The auction was held once every five years. He estimated that there would be 500 to 600 insightful emptiness realm experts in the entire city, or even more.

“Let’s go into the city and take a look!”

Wang Xian said to Ao Jian and the rest before landing directly on the Golden Avenue below.

“Eh?”

When Wang Xian landed on the ground, he felt an inexplicable throbbing of his bloodline.

This caused him to be slightly stunned. Throbbing of his bloodline?

This was the first time he had encountered such a situation.

“What’s going on?”

Wang Xian was stunned for a moment. His heart skipped a beat as he looked to the left.

“This is?” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

He looked at a young man. This young man could not be considered as a human.

He had a steel-like body and was about two meters tall. He was extremely burly.

He held a fiery-red hammer in his hand and looked extremely simple and honest.

The throbbing of his bloodline came from this youth.

Fire Gold Dragon Seed: the strongest dragon seed in the forging technique of the Dragon Palace!

A message appeared in his mind!
