Chapter 347: Ancient God Kun Breeder (2)

Boom, boom, boom!

As the flames ascended, they lit up the areas above. The sky above the Yellow River was now covered in flames as though it was raging in a firestorm. It was clearly visible even to those situated more than a dozen kilometers away.

Within the temporary base, the crowd of experts looked on in shock at the burning flames. The monstrous fire resembled those started by fallen meteorites which crashed into Earth.

Despite being several kilometers away, they could still feel a surge of heatwaves coming at them.

Under the lights of the flames, they could somewhat make out a mammoth figure as it flashed past.

“That ... what was that?” a voice asked.

“These destructive flames are so terrifying. Should they land on us, they’re more than enough to melt our bodies directly!” another said, shivering.

“What exactly is that battling creature? How is it so powerful? Since when did such a menacing creature exist within the Yellow River?” the third questioned.

Dumbfounded, the crowd of Inborn experts looked on with heavy hearts.

Needless to say, the rest who had yet to attain the Inborn Realm status were overwhelmed by more shock, as their legs nearly turned to jelly. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Everyone, let’s take a look over there,” the middle-aged man in military uniform said in hesitation as he surveyed the crowd, while his face twitched with mixed emotions.

“This...,” the Inborn experts replied with flickering eyes.

“Given our combat abilities ... We would be lucky if that powerful creature ignores us as we approach. But what if it attacks us ...,” an Inborn expert trailed off in a low tone. Even though he had left his sentence hanging, his intentions were already clear.

“Everyone here knows the creature over there. It’s not a little tamed animal. Aren’t we courting doom by going over?” another Inborn expert asked blatantly.

To ask them over for viewing right now? How could that possibly be? They were never going over, even if one threatened to kill them.

For such risky behavior, no amount would convince them to go over.

Meanwhile, the young militant stood at a side, taking everything in silently, as his face turned glum.

He dared not to risk it.

“Each of their defensive powers is insane!” Wang Xian exclaimed in shock. He was in the Yellow River, facing more than a dozen creatures. In spite of their now charred bodies, they continued to eye Wang Xian emotionlessly.

Their defensive powers were exceptional, even in the face of Wang Xian whose combat abilities were a level higher. Slaying them would require use of the Dragon Claws, and even then this would remain a difficult task.

“You beasts. How dare you stop me!” Wang Xian snapped. In a split second, Wang Xian transformed into a dragon covered in a body of gold. A Golden Dragon of the metal element was most adept at killing.

“Kill!” Wang Xian shouted as he charged ahead, and lunged onto the creatures which feared no death.

Two enormous Dragon Claws swung forward and tore mercilessly.

Zap, zap, zap!

In the air were sounds of tearing made by metallic materials.

Within a radius of five hundred meters, bouts of metallic energy surged through the region and penetrated through all creatures standing in its path.

Having been seriously injured previously, the dozen or so mutated creatures eventually disintegrated into pieces, and fell into the river.

“Phew! That was troublesome!” Wang Xian panted. He looked at the dismembered body parts which drifted amidst the waters, before turning his Dragon Head towards the center of the river. He stared coolly at the corpse which measured up to three meters.

While it had a human form, its body was entirely mustard in color, coupled with a grisly facial appearance.

As opposed to humans, it had neither a nose nor a mouth, although it also possessed a pair of eyes and ears.

On the top of its head, there were two relatively short horns the color of mustard.

Wang Xian did not approach it, nor did he want to do it so flippantly. After all, it was a terrifying creature, hence caution must be exercised at all times.

The corpse lay silently in the water, as though it was in an individual space of its own. A spot on its thigh which was missing some flesh and blood revealed the ivory bones within.

“The Ancient God Kun Breeder?” Wang Xian said, stunned after reading the message. His face filled with shock.

“The Ancient God Kun Breeder. To think ... it’s the Ancient God Kun Breeder!” Wang Xian gasped with his mouth gaping open as his eyes flooded with bloodthirst. This was a murderous intent which stemmed from his bloodline.

“Hmph!” Wang Xian snorted with a heavy look. He calmed himself down the soonest he could, while information on the Ancient God Kun Breeder appeared in his head.

As the Divine Dragon Transformation read, it was the only Pinnacle existence to have ever been recorded, and also the only arch-nemesis of the Divine Dragon to have ever existed.

That said, based on the records in the Divine Dragon Transformation, the Ancient God Kun Breeders were already extinct. Little did he expect to meet one in person.

The Ancient God Kun Breeder, as the name suggests, was a breeder of Kuns.

Hence these so-called Kun Breeders were also the owners of Kuns, giant monsters of the galaxy.

Whereas the Kun, also known as Kun Garuda, were creatures whose existence was almost on par with that of a Divine Dragon.

It was a fish in the sea, but a bird on land and in the air.

The physical size of a Kun could stretch up to thousands of kilometers, making it one of the largest creatures to exist under the sky.

As a bird, the combat abilities of a Kun were more powerful than that of a Golden-winged Suparnin, making it a rare hegemon both on land and underwater.

A creature as domineering as the Kun, which managed to attain status as a Pinnacle, had achieved this due to neither its bloodline nor physical constitution. Its existence was, in fact, thanks to the breeding efforts of one particular clan.

That is, the Ancient God Clan, otherwise known as the Ancient God Kun Breeders.

These Ancient God Kun Breeders reared Kuns by capturing existences of the top bloodlines with the best physical constitutions within the galaxy, and feeding them to the Kuns thereafter.

Amongst the main targets of these Ancient God Kun Breeders were weaker and smaller Divine Dragons, which were hunted and killed.

Based on records in the Divine Dragon Transformation, these Ancient God Kun Breeders were annihilated after they offended many top-class clans and sects for having killed their descendants.

Their existence was a perverse one, one which was feared and scorned by all.

Wang Xian’s face contorted along with his swirling emotions as he looked at the corpse of the Ancient God Kun Breeder.

He reverted to his human form before walking slowly over to the corpse.

With a body size stretching up to three meters, this Ancient God Kun Breeder was not a huge one. Void of any signs of life, the corpse now crumbled in decay, as though it had been dead for thousands of years.

As Wang Xian looked at the corpse, he began to show signs of hesitation.

This corpse must not be left on its own. These Ancient God Kun Breeders are a top-class existence which even Wang Xian was unable to contain.

He did not know if it would bode well or if it would mean evil should this Ancient God Kun Breeder manage to regain consciousness.

It would be too late for regrets for him, should this fellow kill him and feed him to the Kuns, upon seeing that he was a pure-bred Divine Dragon.

“Destroy!” Wang Xian decided without the slightest hesitation. As he spoke, a Dragon Ball appeared in his hand, which he then placed gently on top of the corpse.

The corpse was soon engulfed in flames.

However, Wang Xian was startled with a burdened look; despite the flames raging from the Dragon Ball, the corpse of the Ancient God Kun Breeder did not seem the least bit affected.

Flames from a Level 10 Dragon Ball had not done the least bit of damage to this corpse.

“To think a corpse which has been long dead can still be this menacing!” Wang Xian shrieked in astonishment. With a sudden thought, he placed his arm on the area where the heart of the corpse lay beneath.

“It’s the bloodline; his body is still flowing with remnants of their clan’s bloodline. I need to obtain it so that this Ancient God Kun Breeder can never come back to life,” Wang Xian analyzed.

Zoom!

Through Wang Xian’s telepathic sensing, he detected the scarlet fluid the size of fingernails, which was located in the heart of the corpse.
