“Eh?”

When the people from the Sky Mountain Sword sect flew over, the people from the ninth-grade sky sect, demon-slaying sect, and three seas gate also looked over!

“What’s the matter?”

The ninth-grade sky sect’s patriarch glanced at them and asked indifferently!

The other party was an existence of the same level, so the ninth-grade sky sect’s patriarch was relatively polite to them!

“Everyone, I have something to tell the other party. Just now, we met the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace and the others in that direction!”

The elder of the Sky Mountain Sword sect pointed to the back and said directly!

“Eh? The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace and the others are in that direction? Are You Sure?”

The sect master of the three seas sect, who was in the back, asked immediately with killing intent in his eyes!

“Yes, we can be 100% sure. As for whether the other party has left or not, we are not sure!”

The Sky Mountain Sword sect elder nodded heavily!

“Why did you tell us about this? Furthermore, we are not here for the Dragon King!”

The three seas sect’s sect master wanted to speak but was stopped by the ninth-grade celestial sect’s patriarch with a wave of his hand as he stared at them and asked!

They didn’t have a good relationship with the Sky Mountain Sword sect. It was obvious that the other party was plotting something by telling them this news!

“Ninth-grade celestial sect master, we won’t hide anything. Just now, we were chasing after a group of abyssal seeds, but they were snatched by the people from the Dragon Palace. Our Sky Mountain Sword sect doesn’t have any top-tier experts, so we can only let the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace take them!”

The Sky Mountain Sword sect elder said directly!

“Oh? The dragon palace actually dares to snatch your prey?”

The ninth-grade celestial sect elder raised his eyebrows!

“They even dare to offend the ninth-grade celestial sect and everyone else, so what’s there to be afraid of!”

The Sky Mountain Sword sect elder said in a low voice with a sullen face!

“That’s true!”

The ninth-grade celestial sect elder nodded his head lightly!

“We’re just informing you, we don’t have any other intentions. Our ninth-grade celestial sect won’t harm you. Farewell!”

The elder of the Sky Mountain Sword sect cupped his hands and left without saying anything else!

“Patriarch, can we trust their words?”

Seeing the Sky Mountain Sword sect leave, an elder asked!

“There is no need for them to lie to us. Their expressions can’t be fake. However, they also want to kill us with a borrowed knife!”

The ninth-grade Heaven Sect’s patriarch said indifferently!

“Whether they want to kill us with a borrowed knife or not, our main purpose is to hunt down the experts of the Dragon Palace!”

The three seas sect’s patriarch said indifferently!

“Let’s Go!”

The ninth-grade sky sect’s patriarch also nodded coldly and flew toward the direction that the Sky Mountain Sword sect pointed out just now!

“Elder, Will the ninth-grade sky sect go there to hunt down the people of the Dragon Palace?”

After the Sky Mountain Sword sect left, a middle-aged man couldn’t help but ask!

“Hehe, what can the people from the fifth-grade sky sect, the three seas sect, and the Jianhua Group do when they are together? Can they be trusted if they say that they are not here to hunt down the Dragon Palace?”

The elder of the Sky Mountain Sword sect smiled and said confidently!

“Their group is much stronger than the Dragon Palace. If they really go there to hunt down the Dragon King and the others, the Dragon Palace will suffer heavy losses!”

A middle-aged man looked excited!

“Hehe, the Dragon King is too arrogant!”

Everyone’s eyes sparkled with mockery and schadenfreude!

“If the members of the Dragon Palace are really there, don’t let them escape. Kill as many as you can!”

“I’ll pin down the Dragon King!”

On the other side, the ninth-rank Celestial Master ordered the others with sparkling eyes!

“Yes, even if it’s a serious injury, I will make everyone from the Dragon Palace pay a heavy price!”

The three seas sect leader suppressed his berserk killing intent and roared softly!

The three seas sect hated the Dragon Palace the most!

“Hide and be careful, don’t be discovered immediately!”

A ninth grade Sky sect undying king level 6 warrior said softly!

The group flew forward and tried their best to hide their bodies!

Buzz

When they stepped into the area where AO qitian and the others were, the strange demon hiding in the void immediately turned around and looked forward!

“Leader AO, there is a group of experts over there. They are invincible!”

A strange demon immediately transmitted his voice to AO qitian!

...

“Someone is coming?”

Ao Qitian was slightly surprised. “Take the dragon blood and run to the Dragon King immediately!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Without any hesitation, he immediately ordered all the members of the Dragon Palace!

“Yes!”

The rest of them didn’t hesitate at all. They immediately came out from the concealment formation and flew towards the location where Wang Xian was!

“There are people ahead. They should be from the Dragon Palace. We have been discovered. Let’s catch up to them!”

At the back, the group of ninth-grade Heaven’s sect members, who were trying to conceal their auras, saw Ao Qitian and the rest fleeing immediately. Their expressions changed slightly!

“F * ck, how did we get discovered at such a long distance? Chase them!”

The sect master of the three seas sect looked a little embarrassed!

“If you want to escape, stay here!”

The face of the ninth-grade celestial sect master was filled with killing intent. With a wave of his arm, bolts of lightning headed straight for AO Qitian and the rest!

...

“Eh? A distress signal? The Tianshan Sword Sect?”

Wang Xian sensed the distress signal from Ao Qitian and the rest. When he saw the terrifying energy fluctuation coming from their side, his expression turned cold!

Buzz

Without any hesitation, he charged straight at them!

“Are they from the Heaven Mountain Sword sect? Are they courting death?”

Wang Xian’s face was filled with murderous intent as he flew straight over!

Around him, Ao Qi, ao crab, and the rest could sense the situation over here and immediately flew over as well!

“Dragon King!”

Ao Qitian and the rest could feel the lightning behind them. They looked extremely embarrassed. When they saw Wang Xian charging over, they immediately shouted loudly!

“You’re courting death!”

Wang Xian’s face was filled with rage. He waved his arm and the five elements grinding mill directly blocked ao Qitian and the rest!

Boom! Boom! Boom

Behind them, the attacking lightning was immediately blocked. Ao Yao and the rest hurriedly flew towards Wang Xian!

Ao he, Ao Qi, and the rest also flew over from both left and right to join Wang Xian!

Wang Xian stood in the void and stared at the group of people in front of him from afar!

“Ninth-grade Heaven sect, Demon Slayer sect, three seas sect, Jianhua Group, Black Forest Group!”

Looking at the clothes they were wearing, Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a cold killing intent!

“Huh?”

“Surround them immediately!”

When the ninth-grade Heaven Sect’s patriarch saw that Wang Xian had made his move and that they did not escape, his eyes were filled with excitement!

“Haha, good, Good, good!”

The eyes of the three seas sect’s sect master and the rest were filled with killing intent!

They were very clear about how many people from the Dragon Palace had entered this place. This time, they had also sent out almost double the strength of the Dragon Palace to hunt them down!

In this abyss that could not be returned to their divine kingdom, they could go on a wild hunt!

“Ninth-grade celestial sect and you bunch of trash are really courting death!”

Wang Xian saw them flying over in an encirclement manner. His eyes sparkled as he said coldly!
