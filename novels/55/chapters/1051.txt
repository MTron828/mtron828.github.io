Chapter 1052: 1053, you think you can still get in?

Translator: 5496903

“Wait for a while? Haha, interesting, really interesting!”

Hearing Zhang Yushu and the others’words, the young man in aqua blue suddenly burst into laughter.

He looked at Zhang Yushu and the others with a mocking expression on his face, “There are still more than ten minutes before the auction starts!”

“Do you know that the tickets have already been distributed in the afternoon? At this time, even if you offer tens of thousands of middle-grade spirit stones, there might not be anyone who will sell them to you. Why Wait a little longer? Do you think you guys can still enter?”

The young man in Aqua Blue said as he looked at the slender girl, “Xiaomei, do you want to go in? I just happen to have another ticket here!”

“This?”

The girl named Xiaomei was stunned. She looked at Zhang Yushu and frowned.

Zhang Yushu looked embarrassed. He stared at the young man and said, “Haowen, don’t look for trouble!”

“What am I looking for?”

The young man shrugged and smiled. He took out an admission ticket and looked at Xiaomei. “How about Xiaomei? Come in with us!”

“Forget it. I’ll go in with Zhang Yushu and Tingting!”

Xiaomei hesitated for a moment but refused.

“Xiaomei, if you don’t go in with us now, you won’t be able to go in. It’s impossible to go in at this time. Do you think that Zhang Yushu can bring you in with him?”

“Even if Zhang Yushu’s father came, he wouldn’t have the ability to get seven tickets. In fact, we’re just going to take a look!”

The youth in blue glanced at Zhang Fengying and said to Xiaomei with a smile.

Xiaomei looked hesitant. She looked at her companions and hesitated.

“Yushu, when can we enter? If we don’t, we won’t be able to enter. Look at Xiaomei, she’s hesitating!”

A young man walked to Zhang Yushu’s side and asked softly.

“This...”

Zhang Yushu looked at Zhang Fengying with a sullen face. He looked like he was asking for help.

Zhang Fengying looked at him and then at the girl called Xiaomei. She shrugged and said, “I don’t know. It proves that we can enter today!”

“This...”

The young man’s mouth twitched when he heard Zhang Fengying’s words. He felt that it was a little unreliable.

“Xiaomei, how is it? You might have to stand here for the whole night with an unreliable person!”

The young man in the water-blue clothes curled up the corners of his mouth, and a teasing look appeared on his face.

Xiaomei looked at Zhang Yushu.

“Xiaomei, this... Let’s Wait a little longer!”

Zhang Yushu looked at her with an embarrassed expression.

“Zhang Yushu, don’t tell me you want Xiaomei to stand with you until the auction starts and then go back obediently? If you can still enter the auction at this time, i, Hai Wen, will take a detour when I see you in the future, Hehe!”

The corner of the lips of the youth dressed in aqua blue slightly curled up as he spoke with confidence.

“Zhang Yushu, can you really bring us in?”

Xiaomei looked at him and asked.

Zhang Yushu looked at Zhang Fengying with an aggrieved expression.

“Wait!”

Zhang Fengying said expressionlessly.

Xiaomei looked at Zhang Fengying, then looked at Zhang Yushu. She hesitated for a moment before her gaze landed on the young man.

“Xiaomei, don’t wait with them. Let’s go. Not everyone can get the few tickets that I asked my father for!”

The young man in aqua-blue clothes glanced at Zhang Yushu and the rest with a look of disdain.

“Then... Alright!”

Xiaomei nodded and looked at Zhang Yushu. She said indifferently, “Thank you for inviting me, but I’m a little sorry!”

“Xiaomei...”

Zhang Yushu looked extremely embarrassed when he saw that she wanted to go in with a young man who had a conflict with him.

“Hi, Big Sister!”

At this moment, Wang Xian’s voice rang out.

As the restaurant was full, they waited for 20 minutes for their meal. After receiving Zhang Fengying’s message, they ate a little and packed a little for Feng Luan before rushing over.

When he saw Zhang Fengying whose face was a little frosty, he walked over with a smile.

“How long have I Been Waiting for you?”

Zhang Fengying glared at him and said in a displeased tone.

“Ahem, I just finished my meal!”

Wang Xian smiled.

Zhang Yushu and the rest looked at Wang Xian and sized him up. They were surprised.

With Wang Xian’s attire, he didn’t look like someone who could get seven admission tickets!

“Huh?”

Xiao Mei was curious when she saw Wang Xian walking over.

He had an admission ticket?

“Brother... brother, do you have an admission ticket? Let’s go in quickly!”

Zhang Yushu looked at Wang Xian and asked hurriedly.

Wang Xian looked at him and then looked at Zhang Fengying.

“Xiaotian’s younger brother.”

Zhang Fengying explained.

“OH.”Wang Xian nodded. Zhang Yitian’s younger brother. Isn’t he your nephew? Why are you sparing him so much.

“Let’s go in!”

Wang Xian said to Zhang Fengying directly.

“Okay!”

Zhang Fengying nodded. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Do you guys have so many tickets?”

A young man dressed in aqua blue looked at Wang Xian and asked with a frown.

Wang Xian’s attire didn’t look like he was the son of an aristocratic family. Furthermore, he knew all the influential aristocratic family disciples in the entire Donghai City.

There shouldn’t be someone like him in Donghai city.

It was impossible for the families from other cities to obtain so many tickets.

Even the big families in the capital city would at most get one ticket each!

The words of the aquamarine young man made Zhang Yushu and the other young men and women beside him look at Wang Xian immediately.

Zhang Yushu looked a little nervous.

“No!”

Wang Xian shook his head.

Zhang Yushu’s expression changed. The faces of his classmates changed as well. What the F * ck...

How are you going to enter without tickets?

This was Feng Xian’s auction and a super powerhouse was overseeing it. Without tickets, it wouldn’t be easy for a seethrough void stage powerhouse to enter.

“Haha, interesting. This is really interesting. Without tickets, are you going to wait at the entrance? However, the door will be closed when the time comes. You might be able to hear the sound if you stand at the entrance!”

The young man in aquamarine clothes laughed out loud. He couldn’t help but give Wang Xian a thumbs up. His face was filled with mockery.

Xiao Mei was also slightly stunned. She shook her head mockingly and looked at the young man in aquamarine clothes. “Young Master Hai, shall we go in?”

“There are still five minutes left. However, I would like to see how they were chased out. Haha!”

The young man in aqua blue looked at Wang Xian and the rest with a smile on his face. He was waiting for a good show!

Wang Xian was slightly taken aback when he heard his words. He shook his head in amusement.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian said to Zhang Fengying as he walked towards the auction house.

“Follow him!”

Zhang Fengying nodded and said to her nephew. She followed Wang Xian and walked straight towards the entrance of the auction house.

This made Zhang Yushu and the rest slightly stunned. They looked at each other and gritted their teeth as they followed behind.

They shouldn’t be thrown out, right? Maybe they could really enter!

They were trying to hypnotize themselves.

“They came with me!”

Wang Xian was walking in the front. When he reached the entrance, the three women and a middle-aged man were scanning the entrance tickets.

Wang Xian said to them directly.

“Yes, yes!”

The four of them nodded with smiles on their faces.

Zhang Fengying was not surprised at all. She followed behind and walked in.

Zhang Yushu and the rest followed behind with a look of astonishment on their faces.

Are you sure you don’t want admission tickets?
