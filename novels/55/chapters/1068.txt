“There’s nothing unusual in the sky!”

The middle-aged man who was called Hawk-eye had a glint in his eyes. He swept his gaze across the sky once again and shook his head coldly, he looked at Wang Xian indifferently and said, “My ocular skill is the supernatural ability of a level nine demonic beast, the ferocious-eyed demonic beast. It can see within a radius of 10 Kilometers!”

“Did you hear that? Hehe, no wonder you guys suffered such heavy losses. It would be strange if there wasn’t a problem with such an unreliable leader!”

When Hai Wen heard Hawkeye’s words, he spoke even more mockingly to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian frowned slightly. His eyes revealed a displeased expression.

“Alright, even if we are being monitored, we are almost at the area of the water wolves. There will be scouts going there to investigate!”

Deputy leader Meng waved his hand. He didn’t take what Wang Xian and the rest said to heart.

He knew how to settle the next matter. With scouts scouting the area, even if there were really direwolves in the sky, it wouldn’t affect their actions much.

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered, but he didn’t say anything.

Everyone went in and proceeded forward.

“Reporting, deputy leader. A group of direwolves gathered at the shore of the ocean 3,000 meters ahead!”

Not long after, two soldiers who had gone to scout the area returned and reported to deputy leader Meng.

“Everyone, get ready!”

Vice regiment commander Meng shouted loudly. His eyes revealed a strong battle intent. “Get ready for battle!”

“Hua!”

All the soldiers immediately placed their weapons in front of them and stared coldly ahead.

The students from the three academies also took out their weapons and stared forward with excitement in their eyes.

“Hide and advance!”

Vice regiment commander Meng patted the level 7 transcendent wind wildebeest beneath him.

The wind-horned horse emitted a green glow that enveloped him.

For a moment, the sound of the wind-horned horse moving forward was completely blocked.

The sound of the rest of the soldiers moving forward completely disappeared. They moved forward like ghosts.

The students also controlled the sound they made and moved forward quickly.

Wang Xian raised his head and looked at the gray-winged goshawk in the sky. He had a bad premonition in his heart.

They were getting closer and closer to the area where the water wolves were. Soon, groups of densely packed blue water wolves appeared in his sight.

They were lying on the ground as if they didn’t sense their arrival.

It was abnormal!

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings. On the left was the ocean.

“What’s That?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

When he looked into the ocean, he noticed that the water wolves were lurking in the ocean. The nearest one was only seven to eight hundred meters away.

Wang Xian quickly looked to his right. On the right, there was a type of sky-blue seaweed growing.

Within the seaweed, there were sky-blue water wolves that were as though they were invisible.

There were about forty to fifty thousand hidden water wolves on the left and right sides.

“As expected, they are ready!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. He swept his gaze across Eagle Eye and felt that this guy’s eye technique was a little unreliable.

“Charge!”

At this moment, they were already a thousand meters away from each other. Vice-captain Meng, who was riding on the wind-horned horse, gave a loud shout and issued the order to reunite.

The strongest force among the cavalrymen was to charge.

“Be careful of the sea on the left and the seaweed on the right. There are water wolves lying in ambush!”

However, the moment the vice-captain gave the order, Wang Xian’s voice suddenly rang out, causing everyone to be stunned.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

However, at this moment, everyone saw a bunch of thorns heading straight for the seaweed on the right.

“All soldiers, slow down your speed and form a square to defend against the attacks of the water wolves on the left and right!”

Before everyone could react, they saw a dense and terrifying number of water swords heading straight for the sea on the right.

Wang Xian’s two orders made deputy captain Meng’s face turn ugly instantly. He turned his head around with a fierce expression.

When he was giving out his orders, another person suddenly gave out orders that would interfere with the soldiers’execution. Although it wasn’t enough to disrupt the formation, such actions would cause some interference.

“Roar!”

“Crash!”

However, when the thorns and water swords landed on the left and right sides, the low growls and screams of the water wolves could be heard from both sides.

One after another, water blue figures suddenly appeared. They were densely packed together. There were at least 40,000 to 50,000 of them, and they were emitting an icy cold aura.

“What!”

“It’s the Water Wolves’heavenly water one-colored divine ability!”

Deputy Commander Meng’s expression changed slightly. There were actually water wolves lying in ambush on the left and right sides.

Moreover, what surprised him the most was that the water wolves were obviously prepared.

According to their information, the Water Wolf’s sky water color divine ability was a kind of concealment divine ability.

The concealment effect was very powerful when it was still, and once it moved, the effect would be greatly reduced.

Most importantly, the water wolf’s divine ability could only last for thirty seconds.

This divine ability was completely of little value to the water wolf beast.

However, this little value almost caused them to be surrounded.

Once they were surrounded, their losses would definitely increase by several times.

“The water wolves already know that within 30 seconds, their group will arrive!”

A trace of fear appeared in Vice Commander Meng’s eyes. He suddenly recalled the young man’s warning and was shocked.

“Listen to his orders!”

Vice Commander Meng hurriedly roared loudly.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The sound of the water wolves’roars could be heard. From both sides, 40,000 to 50,000 water wolves pounced towards them.

The water-blue water wolves that blotted out the sky and the earth stared at them with their cold blue eyes. They waved their wolf claws forward.

Three water lines were coming towards them.

“Everyone below level five of the supernatural realm should put all their effort into defense. Those above level five of the supernatural realm should attack directly!”

When Wang Xian saw the water wolves that were attacking him, his expression didn’t change. He shouted loudly again.

“Obey the Order!”

When deputy captain Meng heard Wang Xian’s words, he didn’t have the time to give any more orders. He immediately shouted loudly.

“Yes!”

The group of soldiers quickly engaged in defense and attack to meet the group of water wolves.

“Obey the order. All those below transcendent level 5 will defend with all their might. You guys can’t withstand the attacks of so many water wolves. Those above transcendent level 5 can use their attacks to block the attacks!”

However, the students from the three academies on the left didn’t manage to react to the orders given in such a short period of time.

The instructor at the side hurriedly shouted loudly.

At the same time, the instructors from the East Ocean Academy and the Ocean Academy looked at Wang Xian’s position in astonishment.

He actually noticed the ambush around him in advance.

Moreover, he even made the most accurate counterattack. How was this possible!

Just now, even the half-step void interpretation deputy commander hadn’t been able to react in time!

“Peng Peng Peng!”

“Ah Ah!”

However, the sudden resistance still caused many students who hadn’t been able to react to be attacked. More than a dozen of them had even died instantly.

They were on the left side. Originally, it was an extremely safe position. However, they hadn’t expected that they would actually be ambushed so suddenly. On the other hand, the attacks on the left and right sides were the fiercest!
