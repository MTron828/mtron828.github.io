“How did you get in? How did you get into our grotto-heaven blessed land?”

“Hiss, how? How did he get into our place? No, no, no, no!”

“Senior brother of the Thunder Ray race, how… How did he get in?”

In the grotto-heaven blessed land of the Great Thunderclap Academy, horror and panic filled everyone’s minds.

They all stared with wide eyes, their faces filled with disbelief as they stared at the figure next to their principal!

The eldest senior brother of the Lightning race, that opponent whom they thought was invincible!

They had been forced into the grotto-heaven blessed land and were already prepared to survive here.

But now, the eldest senior brother of the Lightning race had suddenly entered.

Then, the fate awaiting them was destruction!

This made all of them tremble uncontrollably.

Compared to being suppressed in the grotto-heaven blessed land, they had only lost some freedom. However, they could still survive and live here.

If they died, everything would be gone!

The arrival of the eldest senior brother of the Thunder Ray Race announced their death

“You can die in peace!”

Wang Xian looked at the four peak-stage universe knights beside him and said faintly.

The dean of the Great Thunderclap School, an ancestor of the great thunderclap school, the city lord of Liuyan City, and the city lord of Zi City.

The four of them were extremely pale and filled with despair and bitterness.

“Can you tell us how you entered our great Thunderclap School’s grotto-heaven blessed land?”

The dean of the Great Thunderclap School asked Wang Xian with a face full of unwillingness.

“No!”

Wang Xian smiled and waved his arm. A wave of energy completely covered them.

“Soul capture!”

He muttered softly and a wave of information entered his mind.

Some information about the great thunderclap academy, Liuyan City, and Zi City were presented one by one.

In addition, there was also the matter of the two ancestors of the Great Thunderclap Academy leading their elite disciples to hide outside.

He smiled slightly and waved his arm. A wave of death energy enveloped the four pinnacle universe knights.

“No, no, no!”

“Kill him, kill him, he wants to kill us!”

“What should we do if the dean and the rest are killed? I don’t want to die, I don’t want to Die!”

At the back, everyone saw their dean and City Lord Falling. Their faces were filled with panic and despair as they shouted.

Some of the disciples had completely collapsed.

“I’ll fight it out with you!”

A Level Nine Universe Knight roared and charged towards Wang Xian.

“Ha!”

Wang Xian chuckled. With a wave of his arm, the level nine universe Knight was instantly killed.

He smiled contemptuously and swept his gaze across everyone from the three forces.

An invisible pressure was pressing down on them, making it hard for them to breathe.

“Fog grass, look at the grotto-heaven blessed land of the Great Thunderclap Academy. Our eldest senior has entered it!”

“Our eldest senior brother has actually entered their grotto-heaven blessed land. hahaha!”

“When did our eldest senior brother enter? The principal of the Great Thunderclap Academy and the rest were killed by our eldest senior brother. Our eldest senior brother is invincible!”

“Were we going to say that he wanted to destroy us? Now that our eldest senior brother has entered, it’s their Doomsday!”

At the same time, outside, the experts of the Thunder Ray race were ready to suppress the three major forces.

At this moment, they suddenly saw Wang Xian appearing inside the grotto-heaven blessed land. Their eyes were wide open and their faces were filled with shock.

Eldest senior brother had actually entered the grotto-heaven blessed land!

The end of the three major forces was coming!

The leaders of the Thunder Ray tribe were also in disbelief and were filled with shock.

Eldest senior brother was simply omnipotent!

Boom

In the interior of the grotto-heaven blessed land of the great thunderclap courtyard, Wang Xian waved his arm. A wave of destructive power swept towards the experts from the three major forces.

That terrifying energy was not something they could withstand.

“Ahhhh!”

Screams of pain rang out. They cried out helplessly and hopelessly.

“Don’t Kill Us! Don’t Kill Us!”

The civilians and weak disciples behind them kneeled on the ground in despair and shouted loudly.

Wang Xian glanced at them but did not make a move. These weak disciples and civilians were left to the Thunder Ray Race to deal with.

He would not participate in the killing or anything else!

Buzz

His body moved and arrived directly in front of the defense formation switch of the grotto-heaven blessed land.

He closed the defense formation.

The formation disappeared. Wang Xian’s body trembled and numerous chains covered the entire void. Everyone was enveloped within them.

Under his coverage, no one could escape.

“Wang Xian, you are simply too strong!”

“Phew, eldest senior brother is an invincible existence!”

The leader of the Thunder Ray tribe and the rest flew over excitedly as they exclaimed in their hearts.

It was simply bad news to have such an enemy. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The defense of the grotto-heaven paradise of the Great Thunderclap Academy was much stronger than the Thunder Ray tribe. However, Wang Xian was able to enter it easily.

This unbelievable method was terrifying!

“Hehe, leader, I’ll leave them to you to deal with. Please give their corpses to me as well. Please give me some treasures of the wind and thunder attributes as well. I’m Useful!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Hahaha, all of this was obtained by you, Wang Xian. Without You, our thunder race would have been suppressed.”

The clan leader of the Thunder Race said with a laugh.

“No need. I only want these. I don’t need the other Thunder attribute treasures.”

Wang Xian shook his head. He helped the Thunder Race to destroy the three major forces and gave all these treasures to them.

He had repaid most of his favors.

In the future, their friendship would still be there. However, he didn’t need to give them all the treasures that he had obtained.

“This… Let’s take a look at the treasure vaults of the three major forces first. First Elder, take your men and imprison all the disciples of the three major forces.”

The leader of the Thunder Ray Tribe gave an order.

“Yes, leader!”

First Elder and the rest responded immediately. Their faces were also filled with excitement.

This time, they had destroyed the three major powers and obtained the other party’s grotto-heaven blessed land, which was of great benefit to the development of the Thunder Ray tribe.

Especially the grotto-heaven blessed land of the Great Thunderclap Academy, which was even more powerful than their thunder ray tribe!

Not to mention there were other treasures!

“Great Victory!”

The Great Elder and the others couldn’t help but shout.

“Great Victory!”

The group of strong disciples roared.

“Clan leader, let’s go. I know where their treasure vault is. Let’s go in and take a look!”

Wang Xian looked at the clan leader of the Lightning race and said.

“This… Wang Xian, you can take all the treasures in the treasure vault.”

The clan leader of the Lightning race and the rest said in embarrassment.

“If there’s anything that I can use, I will take it!”

Wang Xian smiled. With a wave of his arm, he brought them to the deepest part of the blessed land.

In the deepest part of the blessed land, there was a mountain peak that was more than 10,000 meters in size. There was a cave entrance in front of the mountain peak.

This was the treasure house of the Great Thunderclap Academy, a force that had accumulated for close to 10 billion years.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian’s gaze was a little heated. With a wave of his arm, he opened the door of the treasure house and entered!
