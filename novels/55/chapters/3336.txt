“AH, how is this possible? Why aren’t you under the attack of the curse?”

When the flames engulfed everyone in the cursed spirit village and when they felt the intense pain, the people from the cursed spirit village were completely flustered.

They stared at Wang Xian in horror and shouted in disbelief. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The other party was attacking them and the curse had already counterattacked. Why was nothing happening to the other party?

Their curses seemed to be useless against the other party.

“Curse? Do you really think that you are invincible just because of your curses? Hehe?”

Wang Xian stared at them and laughed mockingly.

“Next, enjoy the torture of the Sea of Fire!”

He laughed coldly and the flames engulfed them bit by bit.

“Ahhhh!”

Screams of agony were emitted from their mouths. Hundreds of people from the cursed village were shouting in horror.

At this moment, they were filled with despair.

Wang Xian stood there quietly, feeling the attack from the curse power.

To his satisfaction, the Tai Chi Dragon Coil had blocked all the curse power.

This made him smile.

“This… this… that Dragon King actually blocked the attack from the curse. How did he do it?”

“I don’t know. It should be the defensive treasure around his body. It’s really powerful!”

“Hahaha, good, good, good, good, good, kill them. Let them die in pain and despair.”

The experts of the light tribe and the nine-candle demon tribe were shocked and confused when they saw this scene.

However, they were all excited.

They were already filled with anger towards this group of damned cursed Spirit Village People.

Now that Wang Xian had killed them, they were able to vent their anger as well.

The miserable screams continued for a full half an hour.

This was the first time he had killed someone so slowly.

“Eh?”

Just as they were dying one by one, Wang Xian saw a white light flashing across a few corpses.

He looked at the white light, and his eyes were shining.

This white light was somewhat familiar. The last time he killed a universe knight level eight desolate beast, there was also a flash of white light on the body of that desolate beast.

Other than that, when he killed the middle-aged man from the deep pool race, after his death, there was a flash of earthy yellow light.

This meant that the other party might not have died completely. Moreover, he had used a bunch of treasures to make his soul escape.

“Could it be…”

He had some guesses in his heart as his eyes sparkled.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Not long after the white glow disappeared, the mechas in the depths of the grotto-heaven blessed land flew over rapidly.

In the middle, three mechas released terrifying attacks and attacked Wang Xian.

“HMPH!”

Wang Xian looked at the mech with a cold look in his eyes.

Last time, he was afraid of the power of the curse, so he didn’t attack. However, this time, he didn’t have any scruples.

Buzz

Wang Xian moved his body and the incipient Saint Wings appeared behind him. The Tai Chi Dragon spun around.

His palm turned into a dragon claw and attacked the hundred mechs directly.

“Kill, kill him!”

A cold and hateful voice came from the three level eight universe knights in the middle of the mechs. Rays of terrifying light shot towards Wang Xian.

Wang Xian did not dodge the terrifying attack. Instead, he went straight for it.

“Boom!”

When the three terrifying attacks landed on Wang Xian, the Tai Chi Dragon Plate instantly blocked the attacks from the mechs.

On the Tai Chi Dragon Plate, the black parts were emitting a strange luster. A black recoil force was directed at the three mecha.

“Dodge!”

The three mecha instantly calculated the strength and speed of the recoil force and immediately dodged to the side.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom

At this moment, around the three mecha, hundreds of other mecha were attacking Wang Xian.

“Not good. There’s only one dragon king, but there are three level 8 universe knights in that group of mechas!”

The experts of the light race’s nine-candle demon clan glanced at the group of mechas. Their expressions changed slightly as they spoke in a deep voice.

However, they did not dare to go over to help. If they rushed over, the ones who would die would be them.

“Hmph, I’ll kill all of you today.”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with coldness. With the Tai Chi Dragon Disc’s defense, he did not have any scruples.

Facing the coverage of all kinds of energy, he flapped his incipient saint wings and attacked a level eight mech of a universe knight.

Boom

When his speed was pushed to the extreme, the level eight mech of a universe knight could not dodge at all.

Wang Xian rushed over. The Dragon Claw in his hand landed directly on the mech. The huge force caused the mech to tremble.

“What a strong defense!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly. The Five Elements Millstone appeared in the sky above him in an instant.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

The five elements millstone collided directly with the mech. All kinds of energy crushed it.

“Crack, crack, crack!”

The Mech began to crack slowly and started to collapse.

Buzz

Wang Xian moved his body and instantly turned around to attack another mech.

“This is bad. We have calculated that the opponent’s defense is very strong. Our Mech can’t break through the opponent’s defense at all. Retreat, Retreat!”

One of the mechs calculated Wang Xian’s terrifying defense and shouted with a face full of shock and anger.

“Can we escape?”

Wang Xian’s eyes locked onto the mechas one by one. His eyes were filled with killing intent.

The Level 8 Mech of a universe knight was different from other creatures. If they wanted to escape, they could only rely on flying.

They could not return directly to their own divine kingdom.

Wang Xian relied on his own speed and rushed to the front of another level 8 Mech of a universe knight.

“Holy Dragon Shadow, break for me!”

A huge shadow of a divine dragon attacked the mech in front of him.

At the same time, Wang Xian grabbed the mech with his dragon claws, not allowing him to escape.

No matter how the mech attacked, he did not move at all.

On the contrary, the counterattack force on the Tai Chi Dragon disk caused the mech to collapse at an increasingly faster speed.

Crack Crack Crack

Boom

Very soon, the second level 8 Mech of a universe Knight was destroyed.

“Hiss, this… This Dragon King’s strength is terrifying, his speed is terrifying, and his defense is terrifying!”

“He’s too strong. His strength is close to a level 9 universe knight, right?”

At the back, the nine powerhouses of the light race and the nine-candle demon race were filled with shock when they saw the violent scene of Wang Xian.

Three mechs of the same level were attacking at the same time. If it were them, they would have no choice but to flee.

However, that Dragon King managed to destroy two of them in just a few dozen seconds.

Especially the speed and defensive power that he displayed, it shocked them.

They could not help but suspect that even if the nine of them joined forces, it would be very difficult to defeat this Dragon King!

“No wonder the Lich kingdom would lower their heads. This strength is too strong!”

They sighed in their hearts.

He was not afraid of the power of the curse, yet he was able to unleash such terrifying strength.

Such an enemy, too terrible!
