Chapter 612: He Is The Dragon King (3)

“You? You aren’t qualified to challenge the Dragon King!”

A cold and emotionless voice came from Roving Sword, shocking the crowd on the platform.

Ge Wen was stunned too. He squinted his eyes and turned to face Roving Sword emotionlessly.

“For a guy who didn’t even have the guts to face me in battle, what right do you have to speak before me!?” Ge Wen stared at Roving Sword and chided him harshly.

“Roving Sword, watch your words! Qualified? Tsk! What qualifications are needed? The predetermined slots will only be given to young disciples who showed promise, but not so for an expert. An expert wouldn’t require this predetermined slot!”

Just as Ge Wen completed his words, Jin Jian stared at Wang Xian and mocked harshly.

“Senior brother Jin is right. The predetermined slots wouldn’t be for experts but for promising disciples.”

Another supreme talent disciple seconded this. He looked at Roving Sword with contempt before continuing. “Moreover, a guy who didn’t even dare to face Senior brother Ge Wen isn’t qualified to say this! How ignorant!”

Seeing how the situation had developed, Piao Lingxue and Hong Tianda frowned slightly.

They had not expected Roving Sword to speak up for the Dragon King. Moreover, his words weren’t rational at all.

On the other end, Ao Shuwen was pleasantly surprised and watched how things had developed with a smirk.

“Scram!”

However, to the astonishment of everyone, Roving Sword’s cold and emotionless voice resounded once again.

His response of “scram” instantly dampened the atmosphere.

“Roving Sword, you better watch your words! For a guy who isn’t even qualified to enter the Yong Chang Cauldron, how could you even be so arrogant!” Jin Jian, who bore a grudge against Roving Sword, remarked harshly.

“Huh? He isn’t qualified?”

What Jin Jian had said aroused the suspicions of the supreme talents around.

“That’s right! You guys will know in a while. A person who doesn’t respect his mentors and doesn’t know how to interact with others won’t be qualified to enter Yong Chang Cauldron!”Jin Jian remarked with ridicule while smirking over the treatment of Roving Sword.

“The Immortal Slaying Sect is right with this decision!” Ge Wen stared plainly at Roving Sword while commenting.

“Not qualified?” Wang Xian frowned slightly.

Roving Sword isn’t qualified to enter the Yong Chang Cauldron?

He is the runner-up for the grand contest. Why wouldn’t he be qualified?

Admitting defeat on his behalf and barring him from entering Yong Chang Cauldron subsequently? It seems like the higher management of the Immortal Slaying Sect isn’t pleased with Roving Sword!

Wang Xian raised an eyebrow and looked at Ge Wen with a sense of superiority. With an emotionless tone, he said, “Just scram when we ask you to scram!”

“You guys must be courting your own deaths!”

When Wang Xian asked him to scram again, anger flashed in the eyes of Ge Wen.

As the strongest disciple of the three Immortal Sects and the number one disciple for the grand contest, he had already become unhappy when Hong Tianda questioned the legitimacy of his status.

Now, he was offended consecutively. Anger welled up within him and he grabbed the long spear behind his back.

Wang Xian didn’t say a word and only looked at Roving Sword simply.

“You are the one who’s courting your own death, trash!”

Dang!

Roving Sword naturally understood what Wang Xian intended. The next instant, he drew the spiritual sword from his scabbard.

“Great, great... A piece of trash who didn’t even have the guts to fight against me is challenging me now. In that case, I’ll show you my real strength and send you rolling off the platform!”

Seeing Roving Sword draw his sword, Ge Wen was as cold as ice. Killing intent flashed across his eyes.

“Dustless Sword!”

Without batting an eye, Roving Sword attacked with the longsword in his hand with unbelievable speed.

Ge Wen was astonished at the speed of Roving Sword. Flames over a hundred meters in size were emitted from his body like a godly fire spear.

“Shit! Move back!”

The sudden attack of Roving Sword and the release of aura by Ge Wen shocked the group of supreme talents as they retreated to the side instantly.

“F*ck! What’s happening!”

“What’s happening? Why are there sudden explosions of terrifying aura from the platform above the peak?”

“Shit! Roving Sword is fighting with Senior brother Ge Wen. Why did they start fighting so suddenly?”

“This... This... What’s happening. Roving Sword didn’t admit his defeat willingly? Why would he start a fight now if he felt that he isn’t a match for Senior brother Ge Wen previously?”

The hundreds of thousands of disciples around were shocked to see a battle erupting on the platform above.

Why would there be a fight suddenly?

Even the Elders from the three Immortal Sects were astonished by what they were seeing.

“You alone aren’t sufficient to be arrogant before the Dragon King!”

Roving Sword was unmoved in the face of Ge Wen, who was shrouded in flames that reached over a hundred meters.

He swung the long sword in his hand and terrifying metal attribute energy coalesced into a thousand-meter-long longsword which slashed ahead.

“What? How could he be capable of such a terrifying attack!?”

Ge Wen felt fear upon seeing the heart-wrenching energy within the strike which Roving Sword had launched casually.

“Flaming Cage Bell!” he shouted loudly. The next instant, the flames around him turned golden and formed a dazzling huge bell around him.

The huge bell around him looked extremely tough and thick.

Boom!

“What!”

However, the terrifying energy of the longsword instantly split the bell the moment it collided with it!

“What gives you the guts to even be arrogant!”

Roving Sword moved and appeared before Ge Wen the next instant. Without holding back at all, he lunged forward with the longsword in his hand.

Boom!

Terrifying sword glow fell on Ge Wen as fear beamed in his eyes.

Boom!

From a height of a thousand meters, Ge Wen fell towards the ground at an astonishing speed. The moment he crashed into the ground, a terrifying explosion reverberated across.

“Cough, cough! NO... This isn’t possible!”

Ge Wen spat out a huge mouthful of blood. Looking at the protecting spiritual gear on him, his eyes were filled with disbelief, fear and surprise!

“If the Elders had not admitted my defeat to the referee without informing me, do you think a piece of trash like you would be able to get the first ranking?”

At this moment, Roving Sword’s emotionless voice reverberated throughout the crowd.

The entire fight had lasted for at most five seconds from the start to the end.

Before all the disciples around could react to it, Ge Wen was defeated!

Moreover, his defeat was sealed in two moves. Just two moves! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This made many people unable to believe what they were seeing.

Moreover, Senior brother Ge Wen had still been the champion of the grand contest moments ago. He was the strongest disciple of the three Immortal Sects and the entire younger generation.

Yet, he was defeated in such a short time without being able to put up any resistance.

The contrast was simply too huge!

The group of supreme talents in the air stared at Senior brother Ge Wen with disbelief and shock.

“How can this be possible...? How could he be so strong?”

“Roving Sword said moments ago that it was the Elders from Immortal Slaying Sect that admitted his defeat. In other words, it wasn’t his own decision!”

“Defeating Senior brother Ge Wen in two strikes! Has he reached the Half-step to Immortal Realm?”

The group of supreme talents were shaken and couldn’t help but swallow their saliva in awe.

As for the hundreds of thousands of disciples from the three Immortal Sects, they felt as if their world was being thrown into disarray!
