Chapter 1658: Conspiracy 1658

A group of over 3,000 people flew towards the location of the battlefield.

At the back, some people who had received the news followed behind.

There were over 20,000 people, and there were also quite a number of experts at the seventh or eighth level of the Seethrough realm.

Huo Luo'er introduced the outstanding disciples of the Fire Lark to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly at the side. The entire fire Lark clan had suffered heavy losses in this war.

Many heaven’s favorites and experts had fallen. The number of deaths at the insightful emptiness realm had reached one to two thousand.

In the past, there were more than twenty cities attached to the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan. Now, there were only two remaining.

The number of deaths had reached more than a hundred million.

This was the terrifying aspect of a war between powerful factions.

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings. There were only two level 9 insightful emptiness realm experts from the fire cloud sparrow clan who had followed them.

This time, there was no need for the fire cloud sparrow clan to send any experts to follow them in the arena that was agreed upon between the Holy Fire clan and the two major factions.

It was entirely the Holy Fire clan that was in charge.

The two major factions were somewhat fearful of the Holy Fire clan. Hence, there was an 80% chance that nothing else would happen in this arena.

This was because the two major factions did not dare to completely infuriate the Holy Fire clan. They were afraid that they would really join forces. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

At that time, it wouldn’t be of much benefit to the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop.

Therefore, even if it was a life and death battle, it wouldn’t erupt into a large-scale battle.

Not many experts from the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan came.

“This time’s arena battle is a tacit understanding. It’s completely a competition between disciples. If we use this opportunity to make a move, isn’t it...”

However, at this moment, in Fengtian city, thousands of kilometers away, an old man from the holy item forging workshop frowned and said to the people in front of him.

“War is always cruel. If the people of the demon God tribe didn’t come, we naturally wouldn’t dare to do so. However, now that they have arrived, we will let the Demon God tribe pin down the sacred fire tribe!”

“We will use any means to deal with the people of the Fire Cloud Sparrow tribe. The winner is the king.”.

A supreme elder of the life and Death Pill Workshop said coldly.

“I agree too. Do the Fire Cloud Sparrow tribe really think that we will be afraid of them if we call on the sacred fire tribe? They can find people. We have stood for 70,000 to 80,000 years. Naturally, we can find help!”

A supreme elder of the holy item forging workshop nodded in a deep voice. His eyes were filled with killing intent.

“They have a detection array in their hands, so it’s not convenient for us to take action. We can’t send too many profound void tier 9 experts, so we can only let the masked assassin organization Take Action!”

An elder from the life and Death Pill Workshop said in a deep voice.

“Sure, but we have to inform the people of the demon God tribe in advance!”

The Supreme Elder from the holy item forging workshop said.

“Leave this matter to us. Let them wait for a while. Hehe!”

The two grand elders of the life and Death Pill Workshop revealed killing intent in their eyes.

In the past few days, their life and Death Pill Workshop had suffered heavy losses, and the enemy was the Fire Cloud Sparrow tribe.

They naturally had to return an eye for an eye, and blood for blood!

The so-called arena battle was built on the foundation that both sides were equal in strength.

The two major forces were wary of the sacred fire tribe. However, with the demon God tribe, they could definitely fight against them.

A cold expression appeared on the faces of the experts from the life and death pill workshop and the biological forging workshop. The corners of their lips curled up slightly.

Wang Xian, Huo Luo'er, and the rest flew towards the center of the battlefield. Soon, they arrived at the center.

When they arrived, there were already people from the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop.

There were around 30,000 to 40,000 people standing in the opposite position. When they saw them arriving, a ferocious smile appeared on their faces.

“There are five experts at level nine of the void interpretation stage and 13 experts at level eight of the Void Interpretation Stage!”

Huo Luo'er took out the detection compass in her hand and her voice entered Wang Xian’s ears.

“Haha, Jiang Xingkong, Shui Lianyi, Shui Lianhun, you guys are still keeping your promise!”

Lie Hanshan’s loud laughter rang out. His gaze swept towards the two young men at the forefront of the two major factions, and a proud expression appeared on their faces.

A confrontation between heaven’s favorites, no one would submit to anyone?

“Hehe, Lie Hanshan, your sacred flame clan getting involved in this muddy water is not a choice that you know very well!”

In the center, a handsome young man with a compass in his hand stared coldly at lie Hanshan as he spoke in a dense tone.

“Jiang Xingkong, don’t be so arrogant. I, Xu Xingcan, have already killed 29 profound void martial experts from your life and Death Pill Workshop and holy item forging workshop. Today, I will use you to gather 30!”

Xu Xingcan stared at lie Hanshan with a face full of hatred as he roared in a low voice.

“Life and Death Pill Workshop, Holy Item Forging Workshop, prepare to die!”

Furious voices came from the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan one after another.

“Hehe, you want us to die? The ones who deserve to die are all of you. In the life and death arena, i, Shui Lian Yi, will go up. who dares to come up!”

A beautiful woman with delicate features flew directly towards the center.

With a wave of his arm, an array formation instantly rose.

An array formation was a scouting array formation. Anyone under the age of 100 could enter the array formation.

In the Battle of the chosen, they had already made an agreement with the Sacred Fire clan to fight anyone under the age of 100.

“I’ll do it, Shui Lian Yi. Even if you’re a woman, I’ll still behead you today!”

Huo Ming Tu saw the most outstanding disciple of the life and Death Pill workshop appear. He didn’t show the slightest fear and directly rushed over.

“Kill him, kill this bitch of the life and Death Pill Workshop!”

“Goddess Shui Lian Yi, kill that damned fellow. Let the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan know the consequences of offending us!”

“Kill, kill him!”

Huo Mingtu entered the arena, and angry shouts rang out from the surroundings.

The distance between the two sides was three thousand meters, and waves of killing intent flooded towards the other side.

They looked at the peerless genius of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan and the genius of the life and Death Pill Workshop, and all of them shouted loudly.

Now, the two factions had entered a life and death situation.

“Kill!”

Both of them were at the fifth level of the profound void martial stage. Without the slightest hesitation, they charged forward.

Every move was fatal. It was a life and death battle!

“Brother Huo Mingtu, you can do it!”

Huo Luo'er, who was at the side, cheered with a nervous expression.

“Life and Death Pill Workshop, Holy Item Forging Workshop, come and accept your death!”

At this moment, a young man from the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan flew to the center, and the aura of a rank 3 profound void martial artist exploded out.

“It’s Huo Mingshan, the core disciple of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan!”

“I’ll kill you!”

With an angry shout, a rank 3 profound void martial artist disciple from the holy item forging workshop flew over and attacked Huo Mingshan.

“Holy Fire clan, rank 4 profound void martial artist, lie hanling, who will die!”

A disciple from the Holy Fire clan flew out and shouted arrogantly.

The disciples of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan and the Holy Fire clan rushed over one by one. Instantly, killing intent condensed.

The area within three kilometers of the center became the battlefield of the life and Death Arena.

“Hahahaha, Holy Fire clan, leave it to us!”

At this moment, a wild laughter came from the back.

This made the fire Lark clan and the sacred fire clan all slightly surprised.
