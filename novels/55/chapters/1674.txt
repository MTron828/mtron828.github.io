Chapter 1675: 1675, Keke, I’m Coming! Go

“TSK, the Empress has already fallen for almost two thousand years. Do you really think that you are still the fire cloud’s personal guards from back then?”

Hearing the fire cloud sparrow ancestor’s words that were filled with fighting spirit and looking at the fire cloud sparrow disciples who were filled with fighting spirit, the members of the Sacred Fire clan curled their lips.

A faint trace of disdain appeared on their faces.

When the Empress was still around, your fire cloud sparrow clan’s might shook the transcendent continent.

However, the Empress was already dead, the fire cloud personal guards were removed, and you all withdrew from the Phoenix dynasty. How could you still have the grace of the past?

“Perhaps after tomorrow morning, the entire fire cloud sparrow clan will become a thing of the past!”

The four sacred fire clan elders looked at each other and said in a low voice.

Although the information they received was very vague, they vaguely guessed that this time, the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan would be unable to escape.

“As expected of the personal guard of Feng Luan. Just this kind of spirit is rare and valuable!”

Wang Xian looked at the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan who was full of fighting spirit and felt a little touched.

He moved his body and flew directly toward the center.

All the experts of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan were standing there.

Nine thousand void interpretation experts were guarding the fire cloud patriarch and the elders.

“Huoyun is soaring into the sky. The Huoyun Sparrow clan is truly admirable!”

Wang Xian came in front of Feng Yun and said sincerely.

“Young master Wang!”

“Young Master Wang!”

“Brother Wang Xian!”

When Feng Yun and the rest saw Wang Xian flying over, they immediately shouted.

Huo Luo'er approached him and shouted softly as well.

More than ten million people on the surrounding mountains looked at Wang Xian.

Some people immediately recognized him.

He was a half-step Wanshou master who had instantly killed tens of thousands of people from the two major forces. He was the helper of the fire Lark clan.

“Young master Wang, there might be some danger tomorrow. You should leave immediately when the time comes!”

Feng Yun looked at Wang Xian and said directly.

“Senior Feng Yun, you don’t have to worry about my matters. Don’t Worry!”

Wang Xian smiled and said directly.

Around him, those fire sparrow clansmen who didn’t know Wang Xian’s identity were shocked when they heard his words.

There were almost no people who spoke to their patriarch in such a manner. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Young master Wang Xian must be fine. Otherwise, I won’t be able to rest in peace even if I Die!”

“If there’s any danger, young master Wang, please leave immediately!”

Feng Yun shook her head and bowed to Wang Xian.

“Haha, don’t Worry, senior Feng Yun. There’s no one on this continent that I, Wang Xian, am afraid of!”

Wang Xian laughed out loud.

“Show off. Let’s see if you can put on a show when the medicine master and the vessel master arrive!”

The young men from lie Hanshan said with an awkward expression.

However, very soon, everyone from the sacred flame clan raised their heads abruptly.

“Today, I, Wang Xian, will bring along the dragon spike to experience the life and death pill workshop and the forging workshop of the sacred items!”

Wang Xian’s voice continued to ring out. He waved his arm to the upper right.

Buzz Buzz Buzz

Numerous illusory white shadows appeared in the Void.

Five Hundred Shadows flickered in the sky for a moment before slowly disappearing into the sky.

After that, the experts standing within the fire cloud mountain range and the fire cloud sparrow disciples all saw the shadows that flashed past.

“This... This is that mysterious assassin organization?”

An exclamation sounded from the sacred fire clan’s elder.

The four elders stared fixedly at the sky. They could vaguely see four to five hundred figures disappearing into the surrounding space.

“Is this the assassin organization that assassinated over four thousand insightful void martial experts and millions of people from the two major powers in a single night?”

“Heavens, so the two major powers left because of Lord Wang. Just now, those Phantoms appeared directly, and now they’ve completely disappeared. This is too terrifying!”

“No wonder they were able to cause everyone in Fengtian city to leave in fear in a single day!”

“So, these are Lord Wang’s subordinates. Heavens, I can’t even discover them now. This is simply too terrifying!”

Shocked and excited voices came from the mouths of the fire cloud sparrow disciples.

Even the fire cloud sparrow clan elders, elders, deacons, and the other profound void martial experts looked at the white figure that had suddenly appeared with faces full of shock.

Just now, they hadn’t noticed that there was someone in the sky to their right.

Even Feng Yun’s eyes revealed a trace of shock.

She didn’t know how that group of white figures had appeared.

“With Lord Wang and that group of mysterious and powerful assassins, we’ll definitely be able to withstand the attacks of the two great forces!”

Some of the fire cloud sparrow disciples were filled with excitement.

A powerful and mysterious assassin organization had indeed boosted their confidence.

Everyone looked at Wang Xian with respect and gratitude.

This was their fire lark clan’s true friend.

A friend who could be friends with life and death!

“Young master Wang...”

“Alright, I have made up my mind. I know what I should do!”

Feng Yun’s eyes revealed a look of gratitude. He hesitated for a moment before speaking.

However, before he could finish his sentence, he was interrupted by Wang Xian.

A bitter smile appeared on Feng Yun’s face.

In this world, the Empress was the only one who dared to interrupt him in such a domineering manner.

Now, this young man in front of her had the qualifications to do so.

It was likely that even the empress would not be able to stop him from making his decision.

“In that case, I, Feng Yun, on behalf of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan, thank you, young master Wang!”

Feng Yun bowed respectfully to Wang Xian.

“Thank you, Young Master Wang!”

“Thank you, Young Master Wang!”

The elders and deacons of the clan immediately bowed.

The rest of the disciples also thanked him hurriedly.

Wang Xian did not speak. He looked at the spot in front of him quietly and waited for the enemy to arrive.

The rest of the people slowly turned their gazes over!

Face the enemy!

Fight!

Only the members of the Sacred Fire clan looked towards Wang Xian from time to time. Their eyes were filled with astonishment.

Time passed slowly.

It was already late at night. A few hours passed very quickly.

The Sun gradually broke.

Everyone was brewing in their hearts and waiting.

Boom! Boom! Boom

When the sun completely tore through the darkness, a terrifying aura with a strong killing intent charged straight at them.

“It’s coming!”

The hearts of all the fire cloud sparrow clan members trembled. They gripped their weapons tightly and stared ahead.

Before they arrived, a terrifying killing intent had already been transmitted over.

“I am the Medicine Master of the life and Death Pill Workshop. I have led all the disciples of the life and Death Pill Workshop from the life and Death Pill Garden to exterminate the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan!”

“I am the Weapon Master of the holy item forging workshop. I have led all the disciples of the holy item forging workshop to come from the weapon peak to exterminate the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan!”

At this moment, two extremely domineering voices came from the front.

A figure that looked like the sun and a figure that seemed to carry an ocean appeared in everyone’s line of sight.

Behind them were 200,000 experts.

The sunlight shone, and it was as if a god was leading the heavenly troops and generals to descend from the sky.

An invincible aura charged over!
