The wedding venue was in the air. That’s right, it was in the air.

Two hundred meters high in the air, it was level with the surrounding mountains.

A water-blue energy supported all the objects. This was the power of the formation.

The surrounding mountains had all kinds of trees and flowers, making the surroundings exceptionally beautiful.

In the center, there was a huge spring, spraying water, making the entire wedding venue seem like a dream.

On the array formation, there were tables placed, and the entire wedding scene could gather two to three thousand people.

On the surrounding mountain peaks, there were also many tables and chairs placed, causing those who didn’t have the qualifications to enter to have a viewing area.

“Wow, it’s so beautiful!”

Xiao Yu looked at his surroundings with a face full of shock. There were even some flower petals at his feet that were filled with romance.

“In the future, we will build a formation that is even higher than theirs. It will be at a height of 1,000 meters!”

Feng Lingtian whispered from the side.

“Are you going to fly into the Sky?”

Xiao Yu rolled her eyes at him and said with a smile.

“Hehe, Our Yellow Heaven Immortal sect also has a formation. We can totally support a place that is 1,000 meters high!”

“Hmph, I don’t want it. I will get my brother to set it up on the ocean. The ocean is so beautiful!”

Xiao Yu and Feng Lingtian were chatting while Wang Xian scanned his surroundings.

At this moment, more than a thousand people had arrived at the wedding venue. There were immortals from the various immortal sects as well as those from the western divine realm.

As he scanned his surroundings, he discovered at least 80 to 90 immortals.

80 to 90 immortals was not a small number. There would be at least a hundred or even 200 immortals present today.

This was almost equivalent to half of the power of the entire earth.

“The marriage between two powerful forces has attracted the attention of the entire world. All the immortals from the major immortal sects will be here!”

Ling Xiao’s gaze swept across the sect leaders of the immortal sects around him.

Especially those immortal sects that were not very strong. They had mobilized almost all the immortals to show their respect.

After this marriage, the Yuwen clan was definitely an existence that no force could afford to offend.

“Dragon King, we will send a gift. Are You Going?”

Ling Xiao said to Wang Xian.

“Since you are here, I will naturally send you a gift!”

Wang Xian nodded his head lightly.

The wedding ceremony this time was still a continuation of the ancient Chinese tradition. There was a separate place to collect gifts.

Wang Xian and Ling Xiao walked over. Many immortals from the immortal sects were sending gifts.

“Fengyan Immortal sect presents a grade-9 spiritual herb, concentric flower!”

“Immortal slaying sect presents a Whetstone!”

“The Ji clan presents a celestial artifact!”

Wang Xian and Ling Xiao came inside and heard voices.

“All of them are spiritual artifacts that are on par with immortals. This gift is really valuable!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and said plainly.

“The other immortal sects will naturally want to express their goodwill when these two major forces are in a marriage alliance. Therefore, the gifts can be comparable to a spirit weapon of the level of Immortals.”

Ling Xiao said softly at the side.

Wang Xian smiled faintly. He didn’t really care about the level of immortal weapons. A year ago, the members of the Dragon Palace discovered a metal mine.

Wang Xian used level-13 metal materials to forge a lot of immortal weapons.

However, Wang Xian didn’t think much of this celestial artifact now. This item was far inferior to transcendent-level weapons.

He casually took out a hairpin. The effect was useless. It was useless as a weapon and couldn’t be used as a defense. It was just that it looked better and the materials were more precious.

However, in terms of materials, it was indeed a celestial artifact.

Wang Xian was not here to show his goodwill. He simply gave her an item that was not valuable but could be used!

This hairpin was refined by Shu Qing. Feng Luan had imparted all her experience in refining artifacts and elixirs to her. Now, Shu Qing’s skills in refining artifacts and elixirs were also very strong.

“It’s You! Damn that guy!”

“He’s from the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect!”

At this moment, a voice was heard through gritted teeth.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian, Ling Xiao, and the rest raised their eyebrows slightly and turned their heads to look.

Enemies have a narrow road!

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the young man and woman, and a faint sneer appeared on his face.

“Mind your words. Last time, it was your arm. Next time, it will be your dog life!”

Ao Jian, who was standing behind Wang Xian, swept his gaze across the two of them coldly. A hint of killing intent flashed in his eyes.

“Your Puny Yellow Heaven Immortal sect actually dared to provoke our Roman celestial domain. I think you are courting death!”

The young divine son’s face was extremely gloomy. Three days ago, his arm had been chopped off. They could only go back the way they came. Although their arms had been healed, the rest of the disciples were still recuperating.

The reason why they came again this time was firstly to attend the wedding. Most importantly, it was to find the murderer!

Revenge!

However, what he didn’t expect was that the other party was actually a member of the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect. A small Yellow Heaven Immortal sect actually dared to provoke them?

Ling Xiao and a few immortals from the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect watched this scene in astonishment.

They looked at Wang Xian and then at the young man and woman.

This was probably a retard!

He actually didn’t know the Dragon King!

More than a year ago, the Dragon King directly killed Eight Immortals from the Garden of Eden. The other party didn’t even dare to Fart. Now, you actually dared to provoke him.

Was he too stubborn or was his brain damaged?

“Retard!”

Wang Xian shook his head in disdain and walked straight in.

“Stop right there!”

His arm had been chopped off and now he was being looked down upon. As the divine sons and goddesses of a region, when had he ever suffered such humiliation?

They shouted coldly out of embarrassment and anger.

“Huh?”

Some people around heard his cold shout and looked over curiously. In this situation, who was so rude?

“Speak!”

Wang Xian, the son of God, paused for a moment and turned around to look at them impatiently. Then, he spat out a word coldly.

“This is?”

The Immortals from the Fengyan Immortal sect, the Ji Clan, and the other immortal sects were stunned when they saw Wang Xian. Their eyes were filled with astonishment. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“It’s the Dragon King!”

“I didn’t expect the Dragon King to be here!”

“Today is Philomena’s wedding. We Won’t touch you. After the wedding is over, you can just wait for your death!”

At this moment, another shocking voice came from the surroundings.

All the immortals looked at the young man and woman, their faces filled with astonishment.

“Let the Dragon King wait for his death?”

“This, this... which divine realm are they from? How can they be so awesome? They actually let the Dragon King wait for his death!”

“A newborn calf is not afraid of a tiger. The person who said this to the Dragon King is already dead!”

“It seems to be someone from the Roman celestial domain. There are more than twenty immortals in the Roman celestial domain. This time, more than a dozen immortals have come!”

“He’s really retarded. A person from the Roman celestial domain actually dares to provoke the Dragon King!”

When the surrounding immortals heard their words, their faces revealed mocking expressions. There were really people who didn’t know death.

Although the Dragon King and the Dragon Palace hadn’t appeared for more than a year, no one doubted the strength of the Dragon Palace.

How could a small Roman divine realm contend with them?

The young divine son and Goddess suddenly heard the discussions around them, and her face stiffened.
