2624 2624 Dragon Peak Might

“Horizontal push begins!”

Heaven array stared ahead. With a glance, it was an endless abyss seed!

“As long as I kill more abyss seeds, the Dragon Palace’s strength will be able to increase rapidly. The void God Emperor realm is fast!”

Ever since Heaven Array joined the Dragon Palace, he no longer had any second thoughts!

However, what he wanted more was revenge!

Sky array was full of confidence in revenge!

“All members of the Sky Eye Arrow Division, Get Ready!”

Sky array shouted and glanced at the war god weapons in the Dragon Peak with a smile!

Boom! Boom! Boom

All the members of the Sky Eye Arrow Division stood on the Arrow Platform, and the Dragon Peak dashed forward at a terrifying speed!

The densely-packed abyssal seeds soon arrived at the range of the Attack!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

Dragon Peak was so huge that it quickly attracted the attention of the abyssal species!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The leader of a species of abyssal species stared into the bloodthirsty eyes of Giant Peak and let out a furious roar!

In the surroundings, over 10,000 abyssal species stared at Dragon Peak and directly attacked it!

“WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH!”

Arrows, arrows, one after another, attacked the abyssal species!

In an instant, a large number of abyssal seeds were killed!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

However, these abyssal seeds were fearless and continued to charge toward Dragon Peak!

The bows and arrows of the members of the heavenly eye archery division turned into Phantoms and continued to hunt!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Behind them, the powerful abyssal seeds roared furiously, and more and more abyssal seeds attacked Dragon Peak!

“Eh?”

“Is that the people from the Dragon Palace? They actually controlled war machines to enter the abyss. This war machine is so huge!”

“Yes, this war machine is too huge. It’s not smaller than a star at all!”

“There’s news from the side. The Dragon Palace has helped them clear most of the abyssal seeds. We know that there are four rank seven godly monarchs in the Dragon Palace!”

“It’s not wise for them to bring in such a huge war machine and become the targets of the abyssal seeds!”

At the front, some people from the Beichuan sect noticed the situation of the Dragon Peak and said in a low voice!

“Don’t worry about them. Don’t let them affect our situation here!”

An elder said!

“All Disciples of the Starwood Combat Division, Get Ready!”

Ao Xingmu saw a large number of abyss species attacking Dragon Peak. The members of the Heavenly Eye Arrow Division could not kill them at all!

He immediately ordered his subordinates!

“Yes, leader!”

One by one, the Starwood Dragon species immediately came to the front of the battle platform of Dragon Peak and stared at the abyss species in front of them!

More than 100,000 abyss species were attacking. A large portion of them passed through the arrows of the Heavenly Eye Arrow Division and attacked Dragon Peak!

“Sou Sou Sou!”

At this time, the star wood dragon species that covered the sky and earth attacked the Abyss species!

The star wood dragon species also had 3 undying level 7 warriors!

The attacks made it impossible for the abyss species to get within 1,000 km of Dragon Mountain!

All the abyss species were killed over 1,000 km away!

The corpses were collected by the strange beasts one by one!

“Continue moving!”

The sky array controlled Dragon Mountain and slowed down, slowly pushing forward!

“HM? That Dragon Palace is so powerful!”

“After all, there are 10 to 20 undying level 7 emperors in the entire Dragon Palace, it wouldn’t be surprising for them to be able to take care of our Abyss species!”

“If our North River Sect’s power were to gather together, it would be even more powerful!”

Some of the North River sect elders looked at the scene before them, their eyes flashing with shock as they said softly!

The arrival of Dragon Mountain had reduced their pressure greatly!

Every tens of millions of km that Dragon Mountain advanced, it killed over 10,000 abyss seeds. With this sweep, they had already harvested over 3 million abyss seeds corpses! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Amongst them, the Undying Emperor level had already reached 700 to 800!

...

Time passed little by little, and the Dragon Palace advanced little by little!

Three hours later, the Dragon Palace advanced a total of 12 planets!

They killed 15 immortal King Level 7 abyssal seeds!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

When Dragon Peak advanced to the front line of the 13 planets, the moment Dragon Peak stepped in, it caused the roars of the abyssal seeds!

“Eh? There are so many abyss seeds here?”

Wang Xian looked over and raised his eyebrows slightly!

“Dragon King, there’s an immortal king level eight abyss seed here!”

Heaven Array looked at a red dot under the detection of the formation and said with a smile!

“Is that so? Are you confident of killing it?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and asked with a glint in his eyes!

...

“Dragon King, the Dragon Peak that I created has many arrays set up. Let alone one, two or three of them can kill it!”

The Heaven Array said confidently!

Although the consumption of activating the arrays was huge, as long as one could kill an immortal king level eight abyssal seed, the consumption was less than 1% of the consumption of this abyssal seed!

“Alright, let’s kill it then. As long as we kill one, we will be able to add an immortal king level eight combat strength member to the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled. Adding an immortal king level eight combat strength member would greatly increase the strength of the Dragon Palace!

“Alright!”

Heaven array nodded his head!

Boom! Boom! Boom

In the next moment, Dragon Peak charged forward abruptly. The entire mountain peak was emitting a green glow!

“HMM? What are they doing? We have quite a number of abyss seeds here. There’s even an immortal king level eight abyss seed in there!”

The arrival of Long Feng immediately attracted the attention of an elder from the Bei Chuan sect!

Seeing Long Feng speed up and rush into the abyss seed, his expression changed!

The Abyss seed here was one of the two places with the most abyss seeds in front of the Bei Chuan sect planets!

The other place was near the center of the Northern line, followed by here!

One undying level 8 abyss seed, over 10 Level 7, over 1,000 undying and above!

He himself was guarding here, he could only pin down the undying level 8 abyssal seed!

At this moment, the abyssal seed didn’t attack, it was coldly watching the battle!

“Howl Howl Howl!”

In the front, when the undying level 8 abyssal seed saw the Dragon Mountain rushing towards them, its eyes revealed a berserk expression!

He roared coldly, sending out orders one by one!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

At this moment, at least 5 to 6 million of them responded, their gazes locked onto the Dragon Mountain!

“Roar!”

In the next moment, the level 8 undying fighter took the brunt of the attack, rushing towards the Dragon Mountain!

“Shit, is that Dragon Palace courting death?”

Bei Chuan Ancestor’s expression changed. An undying level 8 abyss seed charging over, to such a warrior, the stars were nothing more than a claw attack!

Even though Dragon Mountain was huge, it was only a single attack!

They had investigated the strength of the Dragon Palace, the strongest undying level 7 warrior, against an undying level 8 abyss seed, unless there were 30 to 40 of them working together to fight!

Otherwise, this Dragon Mountain and the Dragon Palace would definitely be killed!
