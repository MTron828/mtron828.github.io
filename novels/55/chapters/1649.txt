Chapter 1650: The 1,650 humans and Dragons merged into one

“It’s the right decision to come here. I can kill without any scruples and plunder without any scruples!”

Looking at Ao Yao’s improvement in strength, Wang Xian revealed a smile.

In the vast region, unless he destroyed the three superpowers, it was impossible for him to obtain so many resources.

However, he could obtain them easily here.

Killing people and plundering goods. War was the fastest way to make a fortune.

Wang Xian continued to fly into the distance. He took a look at his attributes and realized that he still needed half of the resources needed to level up.

I’ll be able to level up with a few tens of thousands of elixirs above the insightful void realm

Wang Xian thought to himself.

After all, his current strength was only at the fourth level of the insightful void realm. Even if he needed a huge amount of dragon qi to level up, a few tens of thousands of elixirs at the insightful void realm would still be able to increase his strength.

Profound Void tier medicinal pills were considered relatively precious items in the central continent region.

“My next target is one of the two great medicinal pill holy lands of the life and Death Pill Workshop, the Heavenly Medicine Valley!”

As the life and Death Pill workshop that had stood tall for seventy to eighty thousand years in the entire transcendence continent, their foundations were extremely terrifying.

They were able to open the medicinal pill workshop all over the transcendence continent. Most importantly, they possessed two paradises.

One was the life and Death Medicinal Garden! 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The other was the Heavenly Medicine Valley!

Among them, the life and death medicinal garden was the main headquarters of the life and death medicinal garden. At its core, there were longevity experts who guarded it all year round.

Once the longevity experts left, the array formation would be activated. It would be very difficult for the longevity experts to enter.

And the importance of the heavenly medicine valley was slightly lower than the life and death medicinal garden.

However, it also had the protection of a longevity level array formation. It was as difficult as ascending to the heavens to break in.

“According to the records of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan regarding the life and Death Elixir Workshop, the Divine Herb Valley is guarded by half-step longevity-level powerhouses all year round!”

“However, during this war, the strength of the guards over there should be reduced by more than half. Most of them rely on the formation to protect them!”

“The defensive formation is useless to me!”

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly. Knowing oneself, knowing one’s enemy, and winning every battle.

He had come here to help the fire lark tribe. What he valued the most was the corpses of the experts and the elixirs from the life and Death Elixir Workshop.

The corpses of the experts could be placed in the dragon pool to increase the strength of the Dragon Palace.

The elixirs were self-evident.

“As long as I can obtain the elixirs and spiritual herbs in the heaven herb valley, even if I get a portion of them, it will be enough for me to increase my strength by one level.”

“Once I increase my strength by one level, I will be equivalent to the strongest person under the longevity realm. Next, in this war, I will be able to go all out!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly as he flew rapidly towards the Heaven Herb Valley.

It would take a long time for Wang Xian to fly a distance of 50,000 kilometers.

Along the way, he passed by some cities. Some of them belonged to the life and Death Elixir Workshop. However, Wang Xian did not make a move. He was prepared to have a big fight.

After walking and stopping, Wang Xian spent a day to arrive at the Heaven Herb Valley of the life and Death Elixir Workshop.

“It is said that these mountains are the founders of the life and Death Elixir Workshop. With great power, they moved the mountains over and formed a valley!”

“Every mountain peak is filled with powerful formations. If one wishes to barge in under the age of 10,000 years, they can be destroyed immediately. Even if one is at level one or level two of the longevity elixir workshop, it would be very difficult to enter!”

Wang Xian looked at the valley surrounded by 40 to 50 mountains of six to seven thousand meters in front of him. His eyes were flashing with madness.

Opening his dragon eyes of yin and Yang and the five elements, Wang Xian scanned the surrounding area of 100 kilometers vigilantly.

Within the radius of 100 kilometers, every trace was within his sight.

Wang Xian concealed his figure. His ability to conceal himself was not any weaker than AO Yaoyao’s.

Flying up to a height of 10,000 meters, Wang Xian looked down.

“Eh? I can’t even penetrate the formation. As expected of a formation that can withstand a longevity expert!”

Wang Xian looked down and realized that the dragon eyes of the Yin-yang and five elements were unable to penetrate the formation. A hint of surprise appeared on his face.

He hesitated for a moment and slowly descended.

Buzz

Without the slightest fluctuation, Wang Xian easily penetrated the formation and floated in the sky above the entire Heaven Herb Valley.

“What a terrifying spiritual energy, what a terrifying medicinal fragrance!”

The moment he entered the formation, an extremely dense spiritual energy rushed over directly. At the same time, a powerful spiritual medicinal fragrance rushed over.

Just taking a deep breath made one feel refreshed.

“The spiritual energy and the fragrance of the herbs here are comparable to the Dragon Palace. As expected of a force on the mainland. They really have a deep foundation!”

Wang Xian floated in the sky in amazement.

Cultivating here was comparable to the Dragon Palace. One could imagine how terrifying it was.

Of course, it was impossible for the life and Death Elixir Workshop to let people cultivate here. This was because cultivating here would destroy the spiritual herbs here.

“The spiritual herbs here, hiss!”

When Wang Xian looked down, he revealed an extremely shocked expression.

The spiritual herbs were divided into nine domains based on the formation.

Each domain contained spiritual herbs and spiritual trees of various attributes.

Every domain had a radius of ten kilometers. The entire heaven’s Herb Valley covered an area of more than 50 kilometers!

However, within this fifty-kilometer area, there were hundreds of millions of spirit herbs and spirit trees planted!

At the very center, a twenty-meter tall spirit tree with luxuriant branches stood there quietly.

The entire spirit tree was emitting a fiery red light.

The light covered an area of two hundred meters, creating a space of its own!

On top of it, there were many fruits. One of the fruit trees was so red that it was purple. It was emitting a gentle flame, while the others were somewhat green.

“A longevity-level spirit tree and a longevity-level spirit fruit. As expected of a force on the mainland. There are even spirit trees of this level!”

Wang Xian was extremely shocked.

He gulped and looked around. Half-step longevity-level, ninth-level and eighth-level spirit herbs and spirit trees were everywhere.

However, many of the spirit herbs and spirit trees were not fully ripe yet.

Plucking the spirit herbs before they fully matured would cause great losses.

As the Heaven’s medicine valley of the life and Death Pill workshop, they would only pluck these spirit herbs and spirit trees when they matured.

They had been planting these spirit herbs and spirit trees for tens of thousands of years.

“This is their foundation. Even if the fire cloud sparrow can completely defeat the life and Death Pill workshop in this war, they won’t fall in an instant!”

“As long as the Heaven Herb Valley is around, there is still a high chance for them to rise up, not to mention their base camp, the life and Death Elixir Garden!”

The foundation of some factions was really terrifying.

“Three people who are half-step to longevity, fifteen people who are at the ninth level of the void interpretation stage, and thirty people who are at the eighth level of the void interpretation stage. This is the power of protection. This is also the hidden power of the life and Death Elixir Workshop!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he swept his gaze downwards.

With such a strong power, once he appeared, he would definitely be smashed into pieces.

“However, the entire valley is divided into nine places by the formation. Only three places are guarded by a half-step to longevity expert. The rest of the places are not guarded!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly.

If he could obtain all the spiritual herbs in the entire heaven Herb Valley, he would be able to advance by at least two or even three levels consecutively!
