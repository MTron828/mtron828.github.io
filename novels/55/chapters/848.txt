Chapter 849: 0850 funeral 1

Translator: 549690339

On the wedding day, he poured wine on the ground in front of the bride and groom.

If the bride and groom left without a toast, then the act of pouring wine on the ground was more than an insult.

It was a naked humiliation in front of the immortals and gods of all the major forces on Earth.

And there was a murderous intent in it.

One Toast to the Yellow Earth, one toast to death.

This was the wine of death.

Yu Wenhua and Philomena’s faces were extremely gloomy. The Dragon King had done such a humiliating thing during their joyous wedding. It was simply an insult to them.

“Dragon King, this is too much!”

When the supreme elder of the Yuwen clan saw this scene, his face was unusually embarrassed. He moved and instantly appeared beside Yu Wenhua and Philomena. His face was gloomy as he swept his gaze across the wine on the ground and stared at Wang Xian.

“Dragon King, are you looking for...”

Philomena’s expression was slightly malevolent. She was the daughter of the celestial king of the Northern European divine realm. Today was her wedding day and under the gaze of everyone, she was actually humiliated in such a manner.

This was not only an insult to her, but also to the entire Northern European divine realm.

In the future, when she recalled that such a thing had happened during her wedding, it would definitely be a very uncomfortable thing.

It was as if a fish bone was stuck in his throat.

The supreme elder of the Yuwen clan waved his hand and blocked what Philomena was about to say.

He stared at the Dragon King with a cold expression.

“Didn’t you invite me here because of your attitude? The son and daughter-in-law of the Yuwen clan are so uneducated. Did you go overboard with what happened just now?”

Wang Xian stared coldly at the supreme elder of the Yuwen clan. His eyes were filled with coldness as well. “Give me an explanation, or else...”

“Hiss!”

Everyone around inhaled a breath of cold air when they saw the dragon king speaking in such a domineering manner.

They stared at the Dragon King’s expression. They could see the thick murderous intent in his eyes. He did not conceal it at all.

Everyone knew that the Dragon King was furious.

The Dragon King did not care about the powers of the Nordic divine realm at all. He also did not care about the strength of the Yuwen clan.

Today, he was invited to participate in this wedding. Others had given him gifts, but he was humiliated in the end. Everyone would be angry.

However, they dared not say anything in the face of a powerful force.

However, the Dragon King did not tolerate it at all this time. Although the Nordic divine realm was very strong, the Dragon King still had the qualifications.

The expression of the Yuwen clan’s grand elder changed drastically.

Everyone had witnessed this matter. It was their fault.

He took a deep breath. “But Dragon King, you can’t go too far. This matter is the fault of their two children. However, today is their wedding after all. Let’s take a step back.”

“Give You an explanation? Dragon King, I’m warning you. If you don’t give our Scandinavian divine realm an explanation today, you won’t have the chance to explain in the future!”

Just as the supreme elder of the Yuwen clan finished his sentence, a cold and arrogant figure was heard.

More than 20 people, more than 20 of the gods of the Nordic celestial domain, came to Philomena’s side in an instant. They stared at Wang Xian coldly.

The other experts of the western celestial domain moved and followed closely behind.

In an instant, 40 to 50 western gods stared at Wang Xian coldly.

When the grand elder of the Yuwen clan saw them speaking, he frowned slightly.

“To do such a thing at my son’s wedding, the Dragon King really doesn’t put us in his eyes!”

The middle-aged immortal god from the Yuwen clan also stared at Wang Xian coldly.

“Haha, Are You Threatening Me?”

Wang Xian looked at them and laughed maniacally.

“So what if I’m threatening you? Dragon King, do you really think that I’m afraid of You? So what if I don’t Give You Face?”

Philomena stared at Wang Xian with a gloomy face. A cold expression appeared on her face.

“Since that’s the case, let’s turn the wedding into a funeral!”

Wang Xian slowly retracted his smile and stared at Philomena. A red glow flashed in his eyes.

Wang Xian’s words shocked everyone once again.

However, at this moment, everyone saw a flame shoot out from the Dragon King’s eyes.

Caught off guard, no one expected the Dragon King to dare to attack directly in front of forty to fifty immortals.

In an instant, everyone was shocked.

A wedding turned into a funeral?

“You’re courting death!”

Philomena and Yu Wenhua did not expect Wang Xian to attack so suddenly. Her expression changed drastically and she quickly stretched out her arm.

A bracelet on her arm emitted a blue shield of light.

However, the moment the flame landed on the shield of light, the shield of light dissipated and the flame landed on Philomena’s body.

A flame that was not very thick landed on her body.

At this moment, her expression changed drastically. A look of horror appeared on her face. The flame landed on her body and started burning rapidly.

The speed of the flame burning was very fast. Dense Wood attribute energy surged from her body in an attempt to extinguish it.

However, the flame was never-ending.

Never-ending sight.

This was one of the eight divine abilities that Wang Xian obtained after attaining the first transformation of the Divine Dragon. The divine ability originated from the never-ending wood on the ancestral tree.

Never-ending sight, pupil technique. When struck by the never-ending wood, the flame was never-ending and never-ending.

Until death.

“Dragon King, you...”

The supreme elder of the Yuwen clan revealed an embarrassed expression. He immediately waved his hand to extinguish the flames on Philomena’s body.

“You’re courting death. How dare you harm our Princess!”

The gods of the Nordic celestial domain were filled with killing intent when they saw Wang Xian attack directly. A sledgehammer and a Knight’s sword instantly appeared in the hands of the two old men standing in front of them.

“Hehe, after tomorrow, all of you will be toasting in my direction as well. Haha!”

Wang Xian laughed as he looked at the two superior immortals who were attacking him.

The red glow in his eyes flashed once again as two rays of light landed on their bodies.

“Ahhh!”

The two of them used the sledgehammer and Knight’s sword to block the attack. However, their weapons extended from their weapons to their bodies without end.

Two blood-curdling screams rang out.

“Not good, the flames can’t be extinguished?”

When the two high-level immortals attacked, a group of immortals hurriedly released all sorts of energy in an attempt to extinguish the flames on Philomena’s body.

However, when all sorts of water and earth elemental energy landed on her body, the flames were only slightly suppressed, but it was completely useless.

They couldn’t be extinguished, not even if a highgod attacked. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Ahhhh, extinguish them! Extinguish the Flames!”

Philomena’s face was filled with terror as she watched her body burn black. She let out a loud scream.

“Not good! The Thunder God and the Earth God are also being burned by the Flames!”

When the other gods of the Nordic deity domain and the Yuwen clan saw the thunder god and the Earth God being burned by the flames, their faces filled with pain as they slapped the flames, their expressions changing dramatically.

The two highgods were also burned by the flames?

Furthermore, they were indestructible!

In an instant, the group of gods stared at Wang Xian with fear and vigilance. The rest of them began to rescue him!
