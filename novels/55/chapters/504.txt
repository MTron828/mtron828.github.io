Chapter 505: Mobilize Everyone In Dragon Sect

A line of more than a hundred people slowly walked up the central elevated platform.

The old man who was holding the sword-shaped walking stick turned around, facing everyone below him.

He swept his glance across everyone and revealed a smile at the presence of all the Saint-class forces from the Underworld.

“I, Nie Wuya, will be hosting today’s alliance of the orthodox sects as Sect Leader Nie Wushuang is in his cultivation, preparing himself for the battle two days from now,” said the old man slowly. Behind him sat hundreds of experts on stone benches.

Among which, Hai Jiao took the middle seat, looking expressionless.

None of them spoke. Wang Xian sat in a chair, watching them quietly.

In addition to him having a seat, only the Dan Realm Experts of Sacred Sects could have a place.

The rest of the Inborn Experts from Sacred Sects could only stand behind.

“I’m sure everyone knows about the situation in the Underworld now. Diabolism is on the rise, and they have been going around, killing the innocent. They’re unorthodox, fearless, gruesome and bloodthirsty. We’ll not have peace for as long as Diabolism exists!” Nie Wuya looked at the people and said slowly.

“Today, the Donghua Sacred Sect invited all of you here to form an alliance between all the sects and clans in the Underworld. We will eliminate Diabolism and restore peace to the Underworld!

“Does anyone have any objection to this alliance of the orthodox sects? If no, the rules remained the same as they were fifty years ago!

“Fifty years ago, every ancestral sect would dispatch their experts, including seventy percent of the total Inborn Experts, fifty percent of their total number of disciples. Would anyone like to voice out anything about this arrangement?”

Nie Wuya swept his gaze across the ground.

“The Sacred Seas of Swords will not be participating in the alliance!”

An old man’s voice was heard.

The crowd froze briefly before looking over to the source of the voice.

An old man was standing straight before the Sacred Seas of Swords. There was a chair beside him, but he did not take it.

As he spoke, he was expressionless, with razor-sharp eyes. He had five sharpened swords at his back too.

“Hur?”

Nie Wuya’s brows furrowed as he looked at that old man.

The old man craned his neck upward and said, “The Sacred Seas of Swords have been living in the sea, and we have rarely stepped into the Underworld. As such, you can settle your own business. I’m here personally to make my stand clear just to give face to Donghua Sacred Sect!”

“Hur?”

Nie Wuya raised his eyebrow slightly. “Fifty years ago, Sacred Seas of Swords fought with us side by side. Are you going to back out now? Diabolism may not let you guys off!”

“Why should we be afraid of Diabolism when we’re in the sea?”

A faint smile surfaced on that old man’s face.

Gazing at the old man, Nie Wuya remained silent as he cast a look at Hai Jiao beside him.

“Old Cai, the Sacred Seas of Swords is, after all, a clan in the Underworld. This concerns the life and death of the Underworld. How can you guys turn your backs on us at this juncture?” Hai Jiao stood up slowly and remarked with a smile as he stared at the old man from the Sacred Seas of Swords.

“With you guys around, insignificant Diabolism will be easily annihilated. Sacred Seas of Swords is staying out of this!”

That old man looked towards Hai Jiao with a frown. His voice was somewhat cold as he spoke.

“You can’t put it that way. I’m also based in the sea, and Diabolism has got nothing to do with me. But since the Underworld is in trouble, I feel that all the clans and sects should shoulder the responsibilities together. Otherwise, the peaceful environment that we establish through our arduous effort will be enjoyed by someone else. This is simply unfair!”

Hai Jiao responded with a broad smile while watching that old man.

“That’s right. The battle between the orthodox sects and Diabolism involves everyone and every force. All of us should contribute to this. We used our blood to pathe a road, and it’s not for others to cross it as they wish!”

Nie Wuya stared at the old man and remarked plainly. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Old Cai, in view of the current situation, the entire Underworld is like a row of dominoes where one fall affects everyone. To put it bluntly, we’re all in the same boat. If someone wants to jump off now, don’t ever come back to this boat again. Otherwise...!” said an old man with a green coat from a Sacred Sect, Jiutian Sect. He turned to Old Cai of the Sacred Seas of Swords.

He did not finish his sentence, but the implied meaning was obvious.

“We don’t know how many losses will we suffer from this war. In the event that we suffer overwhelming losses, wouldn’t the Sacred Sect who did not participate in the battle reap the benefits without lifting a finger?”

An old man from Dongmen Clan threw a cold gaze in the Sacred Seas of Swords’ direction.

Old Cai darkened his expression when he saw seven Dan Realm Experts from seven Saint-class forces staring at him with an unpleasant look.

“Old Cai, this is the time for the orthodox sects to work together against the common enemy. I hope the Sacred Seas of Swords can join us!” said Nie Wuya with a beam as he provided an out for the Sacred Seas of Swords in a timely manner.

Radiance flickered in Old Cai’s eyes. “Fine, but we faced a crisis earlier on, and we’re only left with dozens of Inborn Experts. So, we can only send ten Inborn Experts!”

“Sure, as long as the number hits seventy percent of the total Inborn Experts, it will do!”

Nie Wuya nodded without expression. He knew very well that this was just an excuse for the Sacred Seas of Swords.

But he did not expose this since their sect was situated in the middle of the ocean. Donghua Sacred Sect would not know how many Inborn Experts they had in the first place.

Seventy percent of the strength was just a rough estimation.

“Sacred Seas of Swords will send ten Inborn Experts. The Donghua Sacred Sect will be sending seventy Inborn Experts, four Dan Realm experts, and four thousand disciples!” said Nie Wuya slowly, taking the lead.

“Four Dan Realm Experts!”

Everyone gasped at the number. Four Dan Realm Experts! It’s the Donghua Sacred Sect indeed.

“Dongmen Clan, twenty Inborn Experts!”

“Dark Sect, twenty Inborn Experts!”

“Sui Clan, twenty Inborn Experts!”

“Xiao Clan, twenty Inborn Experts!”

“Heavenly Sound Sect, twenty Inborn Experts!”

...

All the Sacred Sects were unaware of the numbers of Inborn Experts each sect had. Twenty Inborn Experts might have been less than seventy percent, but it was close enough.

With several Sacred Sects consecutively reporting twenty Inborn Experts, everyone followed suit with an unspoken understanding.

Nie Wuya nodded his head with satisfaction upon hearing the numbers reported by various Sacred Clans and sects.

Then he slowly fixed his gaze on Wang Xian, who had been keeping mum.

“This must be the recently emerging Dragon Sect. It’s considered to be unprecedented in history for a Dragon King to possessed such strength at a young age.

“Medical Saint Sect, whose elixir pills marked the foundation to our victory fifty years ago, has been annihilated by Dragon Sect. Luckily, we still have the disciples of Dragon Sect around.

“During the supreme talents’ contest, disciples of Dragon Sect triumphed over two outstanding disciples of Diabolism. Since Dragon Sect is filled with compelling experts, I think your sect can contribute more for the Underworld by sending the entire Dragon Sect, as there aren’t any average disciples in the sect either. What do you think?”

Nie Wuya looked at Wang Xian and asked him this with a broad smile.

“Oh?”

Upon hearing Nie Wuya, Wang Xian raised an eyebrow with coldness flashing in his eyes.
