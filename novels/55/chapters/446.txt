Chapter 447: Sacred Sect: Dragon Sect (7)

“We are not convinced!”

While all eighteen supreme talents were overlooking the crowd from the quiet arena, a sneer came and took everyone by surprise.

“Who? Who is not convinced?”

Everyone was stunned as they spun around.

All the eighteen people on the stage froze as they turned to the source of the voice.

Five young men were staring at the group of people on the stage with cold eyes.

“Hur? Who are they?”

“Who are these five people?”

All of the people were puzzled as they gave way to form a path for them.

“We’re not convinced either!”

Yet another voice came at this time.

“More people? Why are they here?”

“Gosh, those people on stage are the supreme talents of Inborn levels. Who else is not convinced?”

Once again, the crowd was stunned as they looked in the other direction.

Seven young men. They stared at the supreme talents on the stage with a domineering fighting spirit.

“Twelve of them?”

A supreme talent on stage squinted his eyes as he watched the twelve people stalking towards the stage. Radiance flicked in his eyes.

“Hehe, us too!”

Boom!

“Damm, there are more! If I guessed correctly, those five people are Outstanding Five Devil Dragons. The other seven are Dragon Seven Stars. They just made their names known to the Underworld a few days ago. Little did I expect they would turn up. Who are the other four who spoke?”

“Sixteen? Suddenly, sixteen people sprouted up? If they’re not convinced, could they be experts from the Inborn Realm?”

“Fu*k, I thought the ranking was almost over. Who knew there are another sixteen Inborn Experts. Scary!”

“Where did these people come from? There is no information about them. Which clan did they come from? Which sects?”

All of them watched the group of young men below the arena with stunned looks.

“Hur?”

When the group of supreme talents on the stage looked at sixteen young men who exploded immense fighting spirit, their expressions were stern.

“Hahaha, I’m not convinced. Hai Long, you? You are not fit to be the champion yet. Let me challenge you!”

Xiao Yu cast a glance at the group of Dragonians. She was eager to get on the stage when she fixed her eyes on the Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island. With her bone sword, she leaped onto the arena.

“Hur? Challenging the Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island? Miracle Doctor Wang’s sister is simply digging her own grave!”

“She’s challenging the Young Lord? That sister of Miracle Doctor Wang is too insolent!”

The crowd was stunned when they saw Xiao Yu jumping into the arena just to challenge the Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island. All of them looked at Xiao Yu as though she was some idiot.

That young lady was an Inborn Expert indeed. But she was still a far cry from the Young Lord!

“Haha, challenge me?”

The Young Lord was frowning when he saw the sudden appearance of sixteen young men up for the challenge. He darkened his expression instantly when he saw Xiao Yu charging at him.

“How dare a lass like you challenge my superiority?”

The Young Lord fixed his cold stare on Xiao Yu. The Inborn Spiritual Weapon, Frozen Sorrows, was held in his hand and was pointing at Xiao Yu. “Are you tired of living?”

“Heh heh.”

With her bone sword in her hand and a black armor-like outfit, she said, “You? You are not fit to be the champion of the supreme talents!”

“Well, well... Fine!”

The Young Lord revealed a ghastly look. “Since you dared to challenge me, prepare for your death.”

Xiao Yu raised her eyebrows as she drew her bone sword to the side. With a quick move, she went for her attack. “Take this!”

“Go on. Challenge him. The winner will be the champion of the rankings!”

“The people on the stage can get down!”

With Xiao Yu launching her attack, there was no hesitation from the Dragonians below the stage. With a swift movement, all of them charged to the supreme talents on the stage.

“Courting your own doom!”

A murderous intent flashed in his eyes when the ominous-looking young man spotted someone assaulting him.

On the side, Flower Monk held his bloody Buddha beads on his neck and exhibited coldness in his eyes.

Boom, boom!

Combat exploded instantly in the arena.

Everyone was dumbfounded by the scene as they parted their lips.

“Miracle Doctor Wang’s sister is actually attacking the Young Lord. This is madness!”

“Those sixteen people who sprouted out of nowhere are insane. They actually challenge those supreme talents on the stage!”

“Someone is fighting with the ominous-looking young man and Flower Monk. Where did they come from?”

“They are not wearing uniforms, so they should not be from the same force. I’ve heard of the Outstanding Five Devil Dragons and Dragon Seven Stars. But who are the other four young ones? Where did they come from?” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Crazy, crazy. The Outstanding Young Heroes Chart ranking this year is simply too insane!”

All the people surrounding the arena receded immediately.

The entire situation was insane with the sudden appearance of a dozen Inborn Experts challenging all the supreme talents.

This was combat that involved more than thirty Inborn Experts. All the remaining people could only retreat.

At the same time, all the people who were watching the match through the Underworld website were dumbfounded too.

The entire situation was too overwhelming. Those who were not here at the scene would regret it for life.

Many Martial Artists almost fell to their knees as they watched the broadcast.

There are just too many young experts!

Seeing all the Dragonians leaping onto the stage, Xiao Ran was the only one without a rival. Hence, he jumped down with a smile.

Bam!

“What?”

With the sound of the clattering weapons, the sword in Xiao Yu’s hand and the Frozen Sorrows of Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island finally clashed together.

Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island had a huge change in his expression as he sensed the immense energy coming from it.

The Frozen Sorrows was a special Inborn Spiritual Weapon given to him by his father. It was incredibly strong, but it was only on par with the opponent’s black bone sword.

“Hmph, how dare you call yourself the champion of the supreme talents. You’re not fit!”

The black bone-like armor on Xiao Yu exuded faint bouts of black aura. As a Skeletal Dragon, all her battles were close-range.

Her strength, the penetration, and the defense of the bones had reached a horrifying stage.

As a Half-Step to Dan Realm, Xiao Yu could easily defeat the Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island despite the fact that he had a powerful weapon.

But Xiao Yu’s entire body was a daunting weapon itself.

“Lass, go to hell!”

Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island had a change in his expression when he heard what she said. With a frosty pair of eyes, he looked at her while the Ice Core round disc began to spin at his chest. The ground around him began to freeze.

The surrounding temperature dropped to minus a hundred degree.

“Hur?”

All the Dragonians and supreme talents who were engaged in the duels had a change in their expressions as they hurriedly drew themselves away.

The duels quickly kicked off.

Bam!

Back to the ominous-looking young man, his greyish umbrella tip was pointing at one Dragonian with a disdainful look in his eyes.

“Hmph!”

That Dragonian snorted as he stretched out his palm. The human palm was immediately filled with dragon scales. He caught the tip of the umbrella and revealed a cold smile. “You’re not my match. Concede your defeat!”

“Courting your own doom!”

The ominous-looking young man turned cold with a ferocious expression surfacing on his face. A bout of greyish mist surged from his grey umbrella!
