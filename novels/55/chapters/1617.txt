Chapter 1618: 1618 super forces

“The strength of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire is unknown, but it is reported that the ancestor of the Bingxin dynasty, Bingfa Wu, was killed instantly in the sky above the palace when he tried to escape!”

“The old man named Mo Sha didn’t appear. According to my guess, the Dragon and Phoenix Empire has at least two experts at the ninth level of the profound void tier. It is very likely that there are three of them!”

In the Imperial Palace of the Wuji Empire, the civil and military officials had gathered together during the morning dynasty.

The King of the Wuji Empire was sitting on the dragon throne, and two old men were sitting on the seats that hadn’t been occupied for almost a hundred years.

These two old men were the ancestors of the Wuji Empire, and they were even more powerful than the king.

“Obviously, with the expansion of the dragon-phoenix Empire, the barbarian goddess has come again in a high-profile manner. Soon, they might declare war on the solipsistic sect!”

The emperor of Wuji Empire muttered.

“Your Majesty, our relationship with the sky demon is relatively close. As long as we stay out of this war, it shouldn’t affect us in any way!”

An elder standing at the front of the Hall said.

“No matter what, the Sky Demon once saved Qing city. Send someone to send gifts to express their sympathy and goodwill!”

At the back of the Wuji Empire’s throne, Patriarch Dark Eye said faintly.

“With the peak combat strength that the dragon and Phoenix Empire has displayed, it’s already comparable to the supreme sect and the southern royal family. We remain neutral!”

Another patriarch of the Wuji Empire said directly.

“Yes!”

The king of the Wuji Empire immediately nodded and sent someone to the Dragon and Phoenix Empire to express his condolence.

“Reporting to supreme sect master, this is the news from the Dragon and Phoenix Empire!”

At the Solitaire sect, similarly, all the experts of the entire sect gathered at a mountain peak.

The supreme sect master stared at the information in his hand with a gloomy face, his body filled with a terrifying killing intent.

“At least two ninth level profound void martial artists, or even three!”

He sat on the green stone chair, his palm grabbing hard, leaving deep marks.

“I’ll make a trip to the southern royal family. All the disciples of our sect will enter battle mode and be ready for battle at any time!”

The supreme headmaster said with a stern expression. His figure moved and disappeared.

Now that Patriarch Fengchi of our sect had fallen, they, one of the three major factions, were at a complete disadvantage.

Facing a powerful enemy, they had no means to resist.

The only way was to join forces with the southern royal family.

The southern royal family couldn’t stay out of the Sky Demon’s death either.

“I heard that the Wuji Dynasty sent people to the dragon and Phoenix dynasty. Are they going to join forces?”

“The supreme headmaster of the solipsistic sect is scared. He actually went to the southern royal family in person. He must have come to an agreement with the southern Royal Family!”

“In the past few days, I have a feeling that the atmosphere in the vast region has changed greatly. There won’t be a war, will there?”

As time passed, the arrival of the wilderness goddess and the dragon-phoenix empire shocked the vast region. The actions of the three superpowers had affected everyone.

In the past ten days, every piece of news had caused a huge commotion. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

In the ruins of the divine kingdom where all the factions had gathered, everyone could feel a heavy atmosphere.

Even a first-rate faction would shudder in the face of a superpower!

“Feng Huang, the wilderness goddess, Prime Minister Gui, after our patriarch’s decision, we are willing to use the information channels of the He clan to provide all the resources for the Dragon and Phoenix Empire!”

In the Imperial City of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, Feng Luan, Prime Minister Gui, Lan Qingyue, and the others gathered once again.

An old man sat at the side below and said respectfully.

“It’s enough. The following battle is not something you can participate in!”

Feng Luan nodded and looked at the old man with sparkling eyes. “In the next three days, can you find information about the disciples of our sect?”

The old man was shocked when he heard Feng Luan’s words and immediately nodded. “As long as the disciples of our sect appear, the He clan will be able to receive the information!”

“Okay, in that case, we will wait for your news!”

Feng Luan nodded.

“Yes, Emperor Feng!”

The old man nodded and left after talking for a while.

“Are we going to make a move?”

Lan Qingyue looked at Feng Luan and asked.

“Make a move, Prime Minister Gui. How are the preparations going in the Dragon Palace?”

Feng Luan nodded and looked at Prime Minister Gui.

“The Demon Combat Division won’t participate in the following battles. The small-scale battles will mainly rely on the dragon spur division of the Dragon Guard division and the Heavenly Eye Arrow Division!”

Prime Minister Gui’s eyes sparkled. “We are not in a hurry to nourish the battle with Battle!”

“Okay!”

Feng Luan nodded. “Our Dragon and Phoenix Empire is not as strong as you, but I will do well in the back!”

“The vast area is going to be in Chaos!”

Time passed slowly. It had been half a month since the dragon and Phoenix Empire had arrived in the vast area.

In half a month, there was no movement except for the more than 300 cities that they had conquered.

But everyone knew that this was the calm before the storm.

“Those are the disciples of the Solitaire sect. Are they heading into the Divine Kingdom Ruins?”

“The solitaire sect has suffered heavy losses. If they want to recover quickly, they have to enter the divine kingdom ruins to obtain resources!”

At the location of the Divine Kingdom ruins, the Solitaire sect group of 40 to 50 people flew towards the divine kingdom ruins.

Some people in the surroundings saw this and whispered amongst themselves.

“Damn it, they actually dare to talk about our only sect. At our peak, who would dare to Talk About Us?”

At this moment, among the forty to fifty people, a young man shouted in a low voice with an embarrassed expression. His gaze swept across the group of people and his eyes were filled with killing intent.

“The sect leader told us to keep a low profile and not cause any trouble!”

An old man warned with a gloomy face.

Hearing the discussions around him, his expression did not look good either.

If it was in the past, if anyone dared to talk about them like this, they would be killed immediately!

“Weng Weng Weng!”

“Sou Sou Sou!”

“Kill!”

As soon as the old man finished speaking, an incomparably cold killing intent suddenly charged towards them.

Numerous deadly arrows and incomparably resplendent golden longswords.

“Not good!”

“They’re definitely from the Dragon and Phoenix Empire. We’ve been ambushed!”

“Kill!”

The expressions of the forty to fifty disciples of the Solitaire sect changed drastically, and they hurriedly took out their weapons.

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

“Ahhhh!”

Screams of pain instantly rang out. The members of the Dragon Guard and the Heavenly Eye Arrow Division, who had been ambushed beforehand, immediately launched fatal attacks.

After less than two rounds of attacks, forty to fifty disciples of the Solitaire sect were directly killed.

“Take away the corpses, let’s Go!”

One of the Dragon Guards gave the order to take away all the corpses and leave.

When the surrounding people saw the disciples of the Solitaire sect suddenly being killed by the attacks, they were all shocked.

“Gulp!”

“Has it started? has the dragon-phoenix Empire started to make a move?”

“It’s chaotic! It’s about to get chaotic! Two superpowers fighting... No, there might even be three!”
