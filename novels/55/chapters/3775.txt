3776 On the good news of the Little Blue House

“Holy Sh * t, it can’t be? The Dragon King attacked the territory of the Angel clan in the Aurora Domain?”

“Hiss, this… The Dragon King is getting more and more fierce. The Aurora Domain has a large number of powerful disciples of the Angel clan there.”

“How many powerful disciples of the Angel Clan has the Dragon King killed? Now the Dragon King is getting more and more powerful. He is completely killing the Phoenix clan and the Angel Clan!”

“Did the Angel clan and the Phoenix clan give the order to kill the Dragon Palace, or did the Dragon King Kill the two peak races? The Dragon King is too fierce!”

“I’m kneeling. The Dragon King is too ruthless. How many disciples of the Dragon Palace have the two races killed? On the contrary, the experts of the Angel clan and the Phoenix clan have been killed by the Dragon King.”

When the news reached the communication stone plate, all the powerhouses and disciples who saw the message immediately became excited.

They were shocked by the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.

The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace was too fierce in their eyes!

Too Powerful!

Too ruthless!

Last time, he killed 200 masters of the sovereign realm of the Phoenix race. This time, he attacked the territory of the Angel Race?

He was invincible.

While the powerful disciples were discussing, a disciple suddenly revealed something.

“I’m a disciple of the Silverlight sect. Tens of thousands of powerful disciples of our sect have entered the territory of the Angel clan in the Aurora Domain. Now that we’ve lost contact with them, they should have been killed by the Dragon King. The Angel clan must have lost a lot this time.”

When this news spread out, it immediately caused quite a stir.

At present, all kinds of peak races were recruiting high-level races.

High-level races also wanted to find a backer.

But wasn’t the Silver Light sect too miserable?

But this question also raised another question.

That was, how many strong disciples of the Angel clan had been killed?

All the powerful disciples of the silver light sect had died, so it was imaginable that the angel clan had suffered a great loss.

Most importantly, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace had fled after attacking the territory of the Angel clan.

This was what surprised everyone.

The communication stone plate was abuzz with discussion, and a huge pressure came to the third prince.

When the third Prince received the news, he felt his vision go black.

More than two thousand angels were killed, and about three hundred of them were at least in the ruler realm.

He had to bear part of the responsibility for the loss.

This responsibility made him look extremely embarrassed.

Even the elders of the angel of Light Tribe gave an order to the third prince.

Destroy the Dragon King.

Destroy the Dragon King as soon as possible, otherwise, he would have to bear some responsibility.

And this responsibility was a huge punishment for him.

It had a great impact on him.

“According to the memories of the experts of the Phoenix clan, there are many experts of the Phoenix clan in that starry sky.”

At this moment, the matter with the communication stone plate didn’t affect him.

Wang Yun flew forward, preparing to look for the Phoenix Tribe’s experts.

Wang Xian, who possessed the soul capturing power, was not very difficult to hunt.

However, his speed might not be very fast.

However, he was not in a hurry either.

“We are almost there. According to the information of the Phoenix Tribe’s experts, there is an incomparably huge flaming star in front of us. There are more than ten fire phoenixes cultivating in that star.”

After flying for more than ten years, Wang Xian arrived at the memory in his mind.

After flying for another two hours, an extremely huge star appeared in his sight.

It was a flaming star. It was an extremely huge sun.

The size of this sun was hundreds of times larger than other planets.

Flames were emitting from it, and the substance of the flames was spewing out continuously.

Wang Xian sensed it quietly. His eyes sparkled as he immediately flew towards the huge sun!

As he got closer, he immediately sensed the aura of the Phoenix Tribe’s powerhouses.

He moved his body and flew over directly.

“Chirp, Chirp, who is it? This is the territory of our fire Phoenix. Get lost immediately!”

Within the Sun, a Phoenix sensed Wang Xian’s arrival.

An incomparably huge fire Phoenix flew out from the fiery liquid and looked at him. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Whoosh!”

“I’m going to kill you, Phoenix!”

Wang Xian’s figure moved and instantly appeared in front of the Phoenix who was at the level four overlord realm. He waved the five elements millstone and directly enveloped the Phoenix.

“Boom!”

The five elements Millstone smashed onto the Phoenix’s body, causing it to slowly collapse.

He killed him in one strike.

“There’s an intruder!”

“Oh no, it’s the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!”

At this moment, five phoenixes flew out from other parts of the Sun.

One of the phoenixes stared at Wang Xian and his expression changed drastically.

They were naturally aware of Wang Xian’s strength. He was able to kill an existence at the level six of the ruler realm.

An expert at the level six of the ruler realm of their Phoenix clan was killed by the Dragon King.

Among them, the strongest one was only a level four overlord of the universe.

“Run, Run Now!”

A Phoenix roared loudly. They flapped their Phoenix Wings and flew into the distance.

Wang Xian stared at them. His eyes were filled with coldness.

Whoosh

He flapped his incipient saint wings and appeared beside a phoenix in an instant.

His arm turned into a dragon claw and grabbed the Phoenix in his hand.

“Bang!”

One punch and he was crushed to death!

His body moved and Wang Xian appeared beside another fire Phoenix again. He killed the Phoenix casually.

These few fire phoenixes were no match for Wang Xian at all.

He absorbed the souls of the remaining few phoenixes and killed them immediately

He collected the corpses.

“Not bad.”

Wang Xian checked their storage space and smiled.

After checking the information he obtained from the few fire phoenixes, Wang Xian obtained a few more pieces of information.

One of them was that there were more than twenty phoenixes preparing to attack a space beast.

It was a space beast that was at the level three realm.

To attack and kill a space beast that was at the level three realm, there had to be at least three phoenixes that were at the level six realm.

According to the information of the Phoenix tribe, there were three level six phoenixes and 20 level four and level five phoenixes.

“This information is very important. If we can kill them, it would be more profitable than killing the experts of the Angel Tribe!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were sparkling. His body moved and he quickly flew towards the direction in his mind!

“I hope I don’t miss the time.”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled.

Buzz Buzz

Just as Wang Xian was flying, he suddenly received a message. It was from Lan Qingyue and Prime Minister Gui.

When he saw this message, he was slightly stunned. His eyes sparkled.

From the Little Blue House, he sent a message to LAN qingyue. It was an extremely important message.

Ever since the Little Blue House had returned to the starry universe with the beasts from the mountain and sea realm, they had entered the deepest part of the starry universe.

The first thing they did was to fuse with the starry universe!
