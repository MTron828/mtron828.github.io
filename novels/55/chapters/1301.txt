Chapter 1302: 1303, get lost

“You are much prettier and more cheerful. However, I don’t want you. It’s better if you don’t have any other thoughts. I’m a man that you can’t have!”

When these words were said, the lively surroundings became quiet.

Everyone looked at Wang Xian in astonishment. They looked at his serious face as if he wasn’t joking.

However, Ling Jian ‘er, who was standing beside Wang Xian, was a little disappointed.

“Didn’t you say that I’m not pretty enough and that you don’t like my cold appearance? Am I not pretty enough now? Furthermore, do I Still Look Cold Now?”

Ling Jian ‘er looked at Wang Xian and said in a low voice filled with disappointment.

When Wang Xian heard her words, his body stiffened slightly. He shook his head slightly and didn’t say anything else.

“Is she one of the six wives you mentioned? Do You Like This?”

When Ling Jian ‘er saw that Wang Xian didn’t reply, she frowned slightly and looked at Zhang Fengying who was beside her.

Her words were a little shocking!

“Hmph, I’m not. He’s not a good person. You better be careful!”

When Zhang Fengying saw Ling Jian ‘er who suddenly appeared, she frowned and glanced at Wang Xian with a frosty expression. Her eyes were filled with disdain and disdain.

“I didn’t expect you to have so many confidantes. It has only been a short while since we arrived at the tomb of the transvestite, and you have already let such a beautiful woman follow you!”

As she spoke, her words were filled with sarcasm. However, anyone could tell that this woman was jealous.

Everyone around was completely stunned. They looked at the conversation between the three of them in a daze.

This was F * * King Dog Food. Moreover, it was the dog food that countless men envied.

Everyone looked at Wang Xian. If eyes could kill, he would be dead already.

“Who is this guy? What did he do to make Ling Jian ‘er confess to him without caring about her status? Furthermore, that guy actually rejected him!”

“Oh my God, what is going on? That guy... F * ck... how could he... how could he do this? Oh My God!”

“How could such a scumbag be liked by two goddesses? What did he do? Isn’t He Long Xiaotian’s brother? How could he be so awesome?”

“Exactly, exactly. How could such a scumbag who abandoned his seductive charm be liked by Goddess Ling Jian ‘er? This...”

“No Wonder Ren Xingchen is so respectful to him. It’s because of Ling Jian ‘er!”

“I really hope Tang Yuan and Tang Feng can get rid of this fellow!”

The corners of the mouths of the surrounding youths twitched, and their eyes turned slightly red.

This was Ling Jian ‘ER’s pursuit. What right did he have?

However, what shocked them even more was that that fellow actually rejected, rejected Ling Jian ‘ER’s confession.

Moreover, listening to their conversation, this was not the first time he had rejected.

Oh My God!

Even such a goddess rejected him?

“Huh?”

Ling Jian ‘er was frowning when she heard the voices around her. Her eyes revealed a cold expression.

“What are you saying?”

Her cold gaze looked at the young man who said the last sentence. The young man who said that he hoped Tang Feng and Tang Yuan could kill Wang Xian.

“UH...”

The young man felt Ling Jian ‘ER’s cold gaze and his breathing stopped. He squeezed out a wailing smile on his face.

“Miss, just now...”

A disciple of the heavenly sword sect told her what had happened in a low voice.

This caused Ling Jian ‘ER’s face to slowly turn cold.

She looked ahead and swept her gaze across Tang Ling ‘er, Tang Feng and the rest. Finally, her gaze landed on the fox.

“With your looks, you are not qualified to tempt Wang Xian or even abandon you. I don’t know why you want to frame her. I will investigate this matter clearly. At that time, you will not be the only one who will be in trouble. Your family will also be in trouble!”

Ling Jian ‘er stared at the fox-like woman coldly and said directly.

“I... I...”

The fox-like woman looked at Ling Jian ‘ER’s tone that carried a hint of killing intent. She could not help but shed tears once again.

She, who had already broken down once, once again saw despair.

“Oh!”

Suddenly, the fox-like woman took two quick breaths. She rolled her eyes and fainted.

She was dealt a blow that was dozens of times stronger than her. She even threatened to exterminate her entire clan, causing her to faint.

“Forget it!”

Wang Xian shook his head at Ling Jian ‘er when he saw her frosty expression.

Hu Mei was merely a chess piece. The main culprits were the few princes of the Guang Long Empire.

Wang Xian and Long Xiaotian would soon let these few princes know what despair was.

“In the territory of the Heavenly Sword sect, no one can frame you or bully you. They don’t have the strength and qualifications to do so!”

Ling Jian ‘er looked at Wang Xian and returned to her usual cold expression.

After she finished speaking, she looked at Tang Ling ‘er and said, “Bring your men and get out of here immediately. If Wang Xian is injured in the future, I will definitely look for you!”

Ling Jian ‘ER’s unscrupulous words stunned everyone.

Even Tang Ling ‘er, Tang Feng, and Tang Yuan were stunned, not to mention the group of Heaven’s favorites behind her.

Unscrupulous, too unscrupulous!

She was the daughter of the sect leader of the Heaven’s sword sect. Now, she actually disregarded the big picture and directly provoked the Princess of the bloodshed empire for a man.

This..

An ordinary person would definitely not do such a reckless thing.

But Ling Jian ‘er did it. Not only did she do it, she even did it thoroughly. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

She directly told Tang Ling ‘er and the other elites behind her to scram.

If this were to spread, where would tang Ling ‘ER’s face be?

“You... Ling Jian ‘er, do you know what you’re saying?”

When Tang Ling’er heard Ling Jian’er’s words, she was so angry that her body was trembling.

She actually wanted her to get out?

She was the princess of the blood flow empire, and today, she was invited to the Heavenly Sword Sect’s Lingyun gathering.

This was giving face to the heavenly sword sect.

Now, she actually wanted her to get out?

If she was really kicked out, then where would her face go in the future? Even the face of the blood flow empire wouldn’t look good.

“Your subordinates are framing him, yet you still dare to threaten him here. Do you really think this place is your bloody dynasty? I want you all to get out. Didn’t you hear me?”

Ling Jian’er stared at Tang Ling’er and said coldly once again.

This caused Tang Ling’er’s face to turn from red to white, and then from white to green.

I want her to get out!

I actually want her to get out!

Looking at Ling Jian’er’s cold expression, she was almost driven mad with anger!

Everyone around stared blankly.

This ling Jian ‘er was actually so overbearing for a man, it was simply..

“Ling Jian ‘er, don’t go too far. Don’t think that just because you are sect leader Ling’s daughter, you dare to humiliate us. Don’t think that just because your father has broken through, our blood flow empire will be afraid of You!”

Tang Feng and Tang Yuan looked at Ling Jian ‘er with ashen faces.

Just now, Ling Jian ‘ER’s appearance, Tang Ling ‘er and the others had already let it go. They didn’t expect that as the host, Ling Jian ‘ER would actually be so overbearing as to ask Tang Ling ‘er to get lost.

Did she really think that blood flow empire was easy to bully?
