Chapter 923: 0924 crushed them like ants!

“The mercenary groups that accept the mission can fight within a kilometer of the city wall. If they encounter any life-threatening danger, they can fly into the city!”

“Of course, if there are mercenary groups that take advantage of the situation and escape after accepting the mission, it will be considered as a mission failure!”

“The Demon Hunters Association will ensure that the mission is fair and just. The mercenary groups that accept the mission, immediately go to battle!”

After the mission was displayed, the president of the association reminded everyone once again.

“There are at least transcendent-level rank 2 beasts, and there are many transcendent-level rank 3 beasts. This mission is not something we can accept anymore!”

“It’s too dangerous. Transcendent-level rank 2 cultivators, unless they have confidence in their own strength, are extremely dangerous.”

When the mission came out, everyone’s expressions changed when they saw the beasts crawling over from the surface of the sea.

Many mercenary groups looked outside with serious expressions and gave up on this mission.

However, many mercenary groups still accepted it.

A 5-star gold mission was enough to tempt many mercenary groups.

Especially when fighting outside the city, the ferocious beasts they hunted were definitely more than the long-range attacks on the city walls.

The corpses of the ferocious beasts were a huge income.

Wealth and honor came from taking risks. For many mercenary groups, it was a good opportunity to make a fortune.

“Let’s Go!”

“Charge!”

In an instant, the confident mercenary groups moved and flew out of the city.

Wang Xian moved and followed them out of the city. Ao Jian and the rest followed them.

One by one, the mercenary groups flew out and soon reached four to five thousand people.

“Leader, this kid is too arrogant. Do We want him later?”

On the city wall, a group of people from the sword scar mercenary group walked slowly towards Cheng Cheng. An old man glanced at Wang Xian and the rest with a cold expression and said.

“There’s no rush. There will be three waves of monsters attacking the city this time. Once the siege is over, we will take action. If we take action now, the mayor will be displeased!”

Dao Hen pulled out the long saber on his back without any expression. He didn’t even look at Wang Xian.

In his opinion, the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group was just an ant that could be easily squashed to death.

They could take action at any time.

“Alright, then let that kid live a little longer. Hehe, you don’t need to report to us if you want to do anything. However, if you dare to disobey us, you will die!”

The middle-aged man revealed a sinister smile!

“Everyone, get into formation and coordinate with each other. The second wave of attacks isn’t something the first wave can compare to!”

Dao Hen slowly walked to the center of the front from the void. He scanned the surroundings with one eye and said coldly.

“Yes, yes, it’s Commander Dao Hen. Everyone get into formation and coordinate with each other. Only then can we kill more fierce beasts!”

The rest of the mercenary groups quickly responded.

The members of the Dao Hen mercenary group stood at the center.

Around them, the mercenary groups were arranged in formation under the command of the Dao Hen mercenary group.

The prestige of Dao Hen was very ordinary when he ordered all the mercenary groups.

The two hundred mercenary groups, four to five thousand people, quickly got into formation.

However, only the immortal Phoenix mercenary group was ignored by the side.

The second wave of ferocious beasts was still four to five kilometers away. Everyone was holding their weapons.

“Leader Dao Hen’s prestige is really strong. Under his orders, everyone immediately formed a formation!”

“After all, that is the strongest mercenary group in the Holy Sea. However, the immortal Phoenix mercenary group seems to have been ostracized!”

“Because of the incident at the three pill and weapon workshops, the immortal Phoenix mercenary group seems to have angered the Dao Hen mercenary group!”

“I saw this just now. The leader of the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group, Wang Xian, is too arrogant. He didn’t give any face to the knife scar mercenary group. I think they will suffer in the future!”

“A kid dares to get involved in the incident at the three elixir and weapons workshops? Does he really think he is the leader of the Knife Scar Mercenary Group? I think that kid is going to be destroyed!”

“Yeah, so what if he has dual attributes? So what if he is a genius? He dares to provoke the knife scar mercenary group. He is simply courting death! In shenghai town, which one of them is a match for the leader of the Knife Scar Mercenary Group?”

On the city wall, everyone saw the neatly arranged mercenary group. Only a dozen or so members of the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group were in a different position. Some of them said mockingly.

The strength displayed by the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group today and the domineering aura it displayed could be said to have shocked many people.

For a young man to have such strength and power, it made many people feel jealous.

Upon seeing this scene, they mocked him.

Jin Qianyuan watched this scene indifferently and was very satisfied with Dao Hen’s behavior.

He was a team leader who knew how to adapt to the situation. He was also a capable team leader. It was not luck for him to be able to get to where he was today.

“He is indeed very strong, but he is too arrogant. However, it is a good thing for him to be young and arrogant!”

At a spot not far away from Jin Qian Yuan, Jin Liuyan looked at Wang Xian and the rest and whispered.

“Liuyan, a tree stands tall in the forest. Arrogant people will not have a good ending.”

The long-haired young man beside him whispered.

Now, he could only say it in a low voice. After witnessing the young man’s strength and violent personality, he no longer dared to provoke and taunt him in front of everyone. All he could do was to enjoy his words and curse him.

“He’s Here!”

At this moment, Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly at the bottom of the city wall. He wasn’t bothered by being isolated by a group of mercenaries.

Even if he was asked to line up with them, he wouldn’t agree to it.

The thousand-legged fish and the raging sea crab, which had the lowest level of extraordinary-2, posed no threat to him at all. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

When more than 100,000 ferocious beasts rushed over, Wang Xian dashed out directly.

The slaughter began in an instant.

Wang Xian displayed his wood and fire attributes and killed the ferocious beasts one by one quickly.

The group of mercenaries also collided with the ferocious beasts.

On the city wall, the group of city guards and mercenaries also launched long-range attacks.

Arrow Feathers, flames, water swords, wind blades, and all kinds of attacks were launched at the ferocious beasts.

“City Lord, let’s go and hunt down those transcendent level seven ferocious beasts behind us!”

On the city wall, the only rank 8 transcendent expert in Holy Sea Town requested Jin Qianyuan’s orders.

“Permission granted!”

Jin Qianyuan waved his hand.

There were a few rank 7 transcendent beasts behind them. These beasts were not something the mercenary group could deal with.

They needed to send out experts of the same level as the president of the demon-hunting mercenary group.

Two experts attacked. In an instant, the roars of the city guards’beasts and the sounds of humans fighting could be heard.

The thousand-legged fish looked like a lizard. Each of them was two to three meters in size and had more than ten sharp teeth.

The raging sea crab’s body was emitting flames and it was two to three meters in size. It had sharp spikes on its head and could spit flames. It was extremely terrifying.

In a one-on-one situation, even a level 2 transcendent human might not be a match for the beasts!
