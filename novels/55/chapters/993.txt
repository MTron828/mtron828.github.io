“Dragon King, we have killed all of them. We have obtained a total of eight extraordinary level eight thunderfish bodies and seven extraordinary level eight thunderfruits!”

“We came back directly because we were worried about your safety, Dragon King!”

Ao Yao said to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian nodded his head and looked at the main peak. “Let’s go up and hunt the remaining Thunderfish for the thunderfruits!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao, Ao Jian, and the rest nodded their heads and followed Wang Xian towards the main peak.

This time, Wang Xian did not have any scruples. He activated the light-dark fire dragon eye technique and flew towards the main peak.

All the creatures in the mountain peak were within his sight. Once he noticed them, he pointed with his arm and the group of strange demons attacked.

The Top-grade thunderfish on the main peak had been killed. It was no exaggeration to say that they were able to move unhindered across the entire Thunder Island.

The main peak had the most treasures on the Thunder Island. Although the Thunder Fruits were precious, Wang Xian managed to obtain seven to eight of them in just ten minutes.

The main peak occupied an area of about two thousand meters. Wang Xian and the rest used five hours to sweep through it.

All the thunderfish on it were killed by Wang Xian and the rest, and almost all the thunder fruits were obtained by them.

“Bang!”

Five hours later, Wang Xian landed below the main peak. He checked the rewards in his interspatial ring and was very satisfied.

There were eight thunderfish corpses of level 8 transcendence.

There were 23 thunderfish corpses of Level 7 transcendence.

There were 55 thunderfish corpses of Level 6 transcendence.

In addition, there were seven thunderfruits at transcendent level 8.

There were 19 thunderfruits at Transcendent Level 7.

There were 28 thunderfruits at transcendent level 6.

There were 45 thunderfish corpses at transcendent level 5.

Other than that, there were also the corpses of the young master’s mercenary group and the members of the Zhan Hai mercenary group.

In their interspatial rings, Wang Xian had obtained a total of more than 30 million spirit stones.

The flame armor at Transcendent Level 7 from Yun Hanhai was worth more than 20 million middle-grade spirit stones.

The harvest this time could increase Wang Xian by at least 300,000 dragon crystals. It was a huge harvest.

“300,000 dragon crystals can increase all my subordinates to transcendent level five!”

Wang Xian calculated in his heart.

Ao Jian and the rest could be comparable to a transcendent level six when they were promoted to transcendent level five.

When a group of strange demons were promoted to level five, they could be comparable to a transcendent level seven.

Twenty strange demons that were equivalent to level seven of the supernatural realm were considered the best in the East Sea City.

Not to mention, there was also Ao Yao.

“Let’s go back!”

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment before making a decision.

Since he had obtained all the main treasures on the Thunder Island, Wang Xian did not plan to continue searching around. He moved his body and immediately flew out.

Ao Yao and the rest followed behind him.

After flying out of the Thunder Island, the surrounding sky was extremely oppressive. Thick black clouds were in the sky.

They did not fly far before a rainstorm started to fall from the sky.

Raindrops the size of a fist fell into the sea. It looked like the end of the world.

“What a heavy rain!”

Wang Xian looked at the rainstorm that was falling from the sky and raised his head to take a look. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“According to the records, it is the most dangerous when there is a thunderstorm. It is best not to fly in the sky.”

Wang Xian thought to himself. He increased his speed and flew forward.

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

“HMM? Is there a battle over there?”

At this moment, Wang Xian looked to his right and narrowed his eyes slightly.

According to the records, ferocious beasts were the most active when there was a thunderstorm.

“It’s the cloud clams, a kind of ferocious beast that lives in the dark clouds. This group of people is in trouble!”

Wang Xian looked over and saw four to five figures falling into the sea. They were severely injured.

“Brother, Help! Help us!”

At this moment, a figure ran over in a panic and cried out for help in fear.

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

A sharp sound rang out. It was a three-meter-long creature with a very long neck. Its entire body was covered with black wings as it flew towards Wang Xian and the rest.

Their eyes were blood-red and they were extremely bloodthirsty.

“A bunch of cloud clams with level six transcendence. If you can’t handle them, you should run away quickly!”

The young man who was running towards them reminded them in horror.

“Level six transcendence!”

Wang Xian looked over. This young man was kind enough to inform them in advance.

“The feathers on the cloud clams occupy 80% of their body. Their feathers are very precious and of high value!”

Wang Xian had an idea. He gestured to Ao Jian and the rest and flew over immediately.

“Chirp! Chirp!”

The young man was dodging the attacks of the two cloud clams. He didn’t even have the strength to dodge the storm. He looked extremely pathetic.

When he saw Wang Xian and the rest flying towards him, he revealed an excited expression.

“Thank you for saving us, Brother!”

Wang Xian took a glance at the young man and waved the lightning wood in his hand.

A wooden spike instantly entered the body of the cloud toad.

However, this wooden spike actually penetrated through the thick feathers.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. His eyes flickered with a demonic glow as he waved his arm again.

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

Two miserable cries rang out. A golden swordfish flew over and kept it into his interspatial ring.

“Brother, thank you. Thank you, Brother!”

The young man was stunned when he saw Wang Xian’s attack. Then, he said with a face full of gratitude.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly and looked ahead.

There were more than ten young men who were entangled by the cloud clams.

Wang Xian moved his body and the lightning wood in his hand emitted a dazzling light.

The wooden thorns pierced through the clams one by one.

A group of supernatural level six ferocious beasts fell into the sea one by one in an instant.

The Golden Swordfish, who was prepared, kept the dead bodies into his interspatial ring.

“Spirit Enchantment!”

Wang Xian felt a burst of energy from his body. The special energy from Fu Changshu entered the lightning wood directly and he waved his arm.

This lightning strike wood seemed to have a life of its own as it attacked the last few cloud clams in the sky.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

The void interpretation level lightning strike wood instantly penetrated the vital parts of the cloud clams one by one.

The dozen young men who were attacked by the cloud clams were stunned. A hint of shock could be seen in their eyes.

“Thank you, senior, for saving us. Thank you, senior. Our void Beast Demon Hunting Group is grateful for your kindness in saving us!”

The group of young men came to their senses. They quickly bowed and said to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian glanced at them and ignored them. He looked at the black clouds in the sky with a smile in his eyes.

“Let’s Go!”

He shouted softly and dashed into the clouds.

“What? Senior, be careful. That’s the cloud Clam’s Lair!”

“This senior is so young and his strength is so terrifying!”

“He killed the cloud clam who was at transcendent level six in one move. It’s too terrifying. He must be at least at transcendent level eight!”

“Phew, our luck is really good. Let’s go to the sea and check on Hei Hu and the rest. I hope they are Alright!”

More than ten young men were still in shock as they watched Wang Xian and the rest dash into the dark clouds.
