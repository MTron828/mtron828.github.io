Chapter 405: Gathering Of The Super Rich (1)

Sitting in the luxurious car of the Qin Family, Old Qin and Wang Xian were exchanging conversations.

Xiao Yu and the rest did not attend the gathering this time, except for Lan Qingyue.

However, she was going with her family.

This was not the first time for a gathering of the super-rich in the Southern Province. Sun Kaian, the richest man, held it annually to recruit talents and investment enterprises.

That was the reason why he was in the top ten richest in the country with his assets. He was the true-blue tycoon and great entrepreneur.

No one was better than him in the entire Southern Province. Even Old Qin was a far cry from him.

However, Qin Family was still ranked in the top three in the entire Southern Province.

“Why would such gathering invite the Ancient Martial Art Families of the Southern Province?” Wang Xian asked puzzledly.

“There are some reasons for it. Mogul Sun was lucky enough to obtain an inheritance when he was young. It was part of Lu Ban’s inheritance. [1] So, he entered into the machinery industry and used thirty years to establish the largest machinery group within the country. Then, he took some prescriptions from the Underworld and set up his own pharmaceutical company. The rise of the richest man, Mogul Sun, has got something to do with Underworld. As a result, he invites Ancient Martial Arts Families to the annual gathering.”

Old Qin smiled and explained, “Now, his company is based in Modu. There’s only a factory in the Flow City, and he only comes here every Chinese New Year.”

Wang Xian nodded with surprise.

Using Lu Ban’s inheritance to set up a machinery factory and the prescriptions to set up a pharmaceutical group, Mogul Sun must be a genius.

The car was heading to the Southern Province First-level divisional area.

“Langhuan Manor. This is Mogul Sun’s manor in Flow City. It’s also the biggest manor in the entire Southern Province.”

When they reached a manor that was near a lake, Old Qin walked down and pointed somewhere to the front.

“Indeed, the richest man in Southern Province!”

Wang Xian looked ahead with a smile on his face.

The entire manor was near a lake. Although it was known to be a manor, it could also be called a castle.

The estate spanned over an area of at least five thousand square meters. As it was close to the lake, the scenery was beautiful.

Just like what its name, Langhuan, suggested, the place was like a utopia.

“Hur?”

When Wang Xian and Old Qin were heading to Old Xue’s car after getting out of the car, Wang Xian spotted a familiar vehicle.

There were hundreds of luxurious cars parked in the lot beside the lake, and four to five helicopters at the side.

Amid those luxurious cars, Wang Xian spotted a heavy-duty motorcycle, the Harley bike.

“Isn’t that the one I gave Wang Dahai? Is he here?”

When Wang Xian saw the car plate number, he was slightly stunned. Wang Dahai’s family background was not bad. His family owned approximately millions of assets.

But they were still not eligible to be here for this gathering.

“What’s wrong, Wang Xian?”

Old Xue walked over he saw Wang Xian’s doubtful look.

“I saw a familiar vehicle. Let me make a call!”

Wang Xian laughed. He took out his phone and called Wang Dahai.

“Yo, Old Wang!”

“Dahai, where are you?”

“I’m attending a gathering. Why?”

“Is it at Langhuan Manor? Where are you? I’m at the entrance!”

“Really? You’re here too? Great, wait for me there. I’m coming!”

Subsequently, he heard Wang Dahai talking to someone.

“Why is Wang Dahai here?”

After Wang Xian hung up the phone, he raised an eyebrow. “Old Qin, Old Xue, you can go ahead first. I’m waiting for a classmate!”

“Oh? Okay, we’ll wait for you inside.” Old Qin nodded.

“Sure, I’ll be there soon!” Wang Xian nodded as he walked to the entrance of the manor.

“This manor is quite impressive.”

As he stood at the doorway, Wang Xian was observing the manor.

“Old Wang!”

Within minutes, Wang Dahai showed up, running to him while calling out for him.

“Dahai, why are you here?”

Wang Xian walked towards him.

“I’m here to visit my Grandpa since it’s the vacation now. It’s great, my Grandpa brought me here to broaden my horizons!” Wang Dahai was elated as he spoke. “Let’s go. I’ll take you inside.”

“Your grandpa?”

Wang Xian was slightly taken aback.

“My grandpa used to be in the first batch of employees working for Mogul Sun. Now, he’s the vice president of the factory in Flow City.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Wang Dahai chuckled. “My dad was even more impressive. He came from the countryside and brought my mum down. But my grandpa looked down on my dad.”

Wang Dahai then asked, “Why are you here then?”

“I’m here with friends!” Wang Xian replied.

“Tsk tsk, look at this manor. It’s simply beautiful. Sigh, how I wish I could stay in such a manor!”

Wang Dahai looked around the manor with an envious face. “Old Wang, don’t forget to invite me when you own such a manor!”

Wang Xian chuckled. He observed the manor, and it could not be compared to any average mansions.

The entire manor was filled with elegant and pretty pavilions. Just the maintenance alone would take a dozen workers.

Wang Dahai brought him to a huge banquet hall. The entire hall was luxurious, with hundreds of guests sitting inside, exchanging conversations.

Wang Xian looked around and did not see Old Qin or Old Xue.

“Let’s find a place to sit down and talk. The banquet will start later in the afternoon.”

Wang Dahai led Wang Xian to a place and took two beverages from a waiter smilingly. Then they sat at a table.

There were other dashing young men and pretty babes at the table. The young men were in neat suits with stylish hairstyles.

The ladies were in evening dresses, exchanging conversations in an elegant posture.

“Cousin, is that your friend?”

A girl whose face was small looked over. As soon as she spotted Wang Xian, she asked this of him puzzledly.

“Yes, he’s my classmate. He’s awesome. Even though he is younger than me, he has made a fortune for himself!” Wang Dahai replied to that girl proudly.

“Oh?”

Wang Dahai’s cousin was sizing up Wang Xian with surprise. Dashing, with outstanding demeanor which was way better than her boyfriend. So she could not help but take a few more looks.

“Why did he dress so casually to attend such an event like this?”

At this time, a young man who was sitting by the side of Wang Dahai’s cousin was unhappy that his girlfriend was observing Wang Xian. He threw her a displeased look and fixed his eyes on Wang Xian.

Upon hearing what that young man said, the rest of them looked towards Wang Xian.

A sweater and ordinary slacks with a pair of sneakers. Such dressing was simply out of place in that environment.

Wang Dahai’s cousin noticed the displeasure of her boyfriend. She also spotted what Wang Xian was wearing.

“It’s a little inappropriate. Cousin, there’s still some time. Bring your classmate to change into formal attire. How can he be dressed so casually on such an important occasion? He would only make others feel that he isn’t showing them respect!”
