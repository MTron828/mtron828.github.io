Chapter 519: The World Is Shocked (1)

Wang Xian burned all their books away since the Remains’ Art of Cultivation was nothing useful.

He looked around, noticing only bones occupying most of the areas. Other than that, it was the raw material for refining the bone puppets.

The only relatively high-value stuff was probably a Devil Spiritual Bead, a Level 11 Devil Spiritual Bead.

However, the Devil Spiritual Bead was useless to him, except for making weapons or giving it to Mo Qinglong.

“Take all the material with us and go!” Wang Xian ordered the Dragonians.

“Yes, Dragon King!”

Mo Yuan beckoned to some Dragonians, wrapping all the Inborn materials up.

“Dragon King, we found some vital information!”

Just as they came to the ground, Wang Xian saw Long Qi, and the rest walked out from a room by the side with thrilled faces.

“What is it?”

Seeing their excited expressions, Wang Xian asked this with his curiosity piqued.

“It’s about Omniscient Group. Unexpectedly, Omniscient Group was actually established by the Remains. They infiltrated the Underworld with Painted Skins and human masks with fifty years of development. Shenling Information Technology was their basecamp. I even have a piece of information regarding the top management of Omniscient Group.

“The top management was all die-hard subordinates groomed by the Remains. They are not cultivators but completely ordinary people. If we could control the top management, we could control the entire Omniscient Group!”

Long Qi was elated as he continued to Wang Xian, “All the people in the Underworld would not have expected that Omniscient Group is controlled by a group of ordinary people. Hence, things turned out to be this way!

“Besides, they have access to a team of powerful computer masters who can do surveillance on any places. In addition, there are satellites. As long as the signal is clear, we can see anywhere we want!”

“Is that so?”

A trace of surprise flashed in Wang Xian’s eyes.

“So, if we control the top management, we can control Omniscient Group?”

“Yes, the internal department of Omniscient Group has very tight control. Not even the middle-level staff know the location of the base of Omniscient Group. They will deliver the message through internal channels, reporting up level by level. As such, once we have access to higher management, it will be as good as controlling the entire Omniscient Group!”

Long Qi nodded his head with force.

“Mo Yuan, you’ll try to gain control of Omniscient Group with Long Qi and the rest. I hope you guys succeed!” Wang Xian gave commands to Mo Yuan immediately.

“Yes, Dragon King. As long as we can find the people, we’ll be able to seize control!”

“Sure, I’ll wait for your good news!”

Wang Xian smiled as he walked outside.

When he stepped out of the Remains’ Land, he spun around and swept a look at the creepy and daunting forest.

Wang Xian made a swift move and hovered to the sky.

With a Dragon Ball in his mouth, Wang Xian opened his mouth and spat below.

Columns of flames fell, encompassing an area spanning a dozen meters in an instant.

Wang Xian, again, spewed flames in the other direction.

Within a minute, the entire Remains’ Land was shrouded in intense heat as the flames rose and spread out to the surroundings.

With swift action, Wang Xian came to the border of the land and set up a barrier.

That meant that the flame would automatically extinguish itself once the entire Remains’ Land was totally burned down to ashes.

The entire region spanned over a radius of about twenty kilometers.

The black woods in this forest carried traces of toxins, so he wanted to get rid of this entire place.

When the fire rose, Wang Xian headed towards Ling City with a beaming face. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The blazing fire behind him was burning even more fiercely than before as it lit up the entire sky.

Ling City was a city that never slept. The nightlife over there could be comparable to those first-tier cities.

As a city with a high crime rate, many people were wandering outside at night.

When Wang Xian arrived at Ling City half an hour later, those wandering night owls suddenly realized the sky was much brighter.

“What’s going on? Why is the sky lit up?”

A few young people outside looked up curiously as they noticed the sky was brighter than before.

“That is...? The direction of the Fateless Forest!”

“It’s the Fateless Forest. There is a fire over there now. Why is that forest on fire? The Fateless Forest is quite damp!”

“What a blazing flame. The brightness is taking over the sky. I guess the range of land on fire should spread over ten kilometers!”

Everyone was shocked, including one of the Martial Artists who was looking towards the direction of the Fateless Forest with questions on his face.

“What’s going on? Why is there such a huge fire?”

“The base camp of the Remains is in the Fateless Forest, but why would there be fire?”

Some Martial Artists cast their gazes over with suspicious looks.

The Fateless Forest covered hundreds of kilometers. Still, the region that was on fire was at least ten to twenty kilometers.

Such a large surface area of fire had erupted, and people of the Remains would not have missed out.

If they found out, why would they let the fire burn by itself?

Could something have happened to the Remains over there?

Some of the Martial Artists pondered.

“Master, the Fateless Forest is on huge fire. It’s odd!”

Back on a rooftop of one of the five-star hotels in Ling City, dozens of middle-aged and old men were standing around as they gazed in the direction of the Fateless Forest with quizzical expressions.

“It is indeed strange. Someone from the Underworld mentioned that the Dragon King, along with some of the disciples of Dragon Sect, entered the Fateless Forest. Now that the forest is on fire, could this have to do with the Dragon King and the rest?”

The old man in the center revealed a pondering look.

The Spiritual Wind Sect, a first-class force, was just passing by this area after the alliance of the orthodox sects had ended during the day.

Since it was too late to leave, they decided to stay put at Ling City for a night.

“There is absolutely no reason for such a great fire to break out in the Fateless Forest!”

A middle-aged man frowned.

“Could it be the Dragon Sect and the Remains developed some conflicts? Or it’s more than meets the eye?” an old man murmured.

“Why don’t we go and check it out? Given our speed, not even the Inborn Experts of the Remains could catch up to us!” said an old man from Spiritual Wind Sect suddenly.

Spiritual Wind Sect’s cultivation was wind-attributed. Hence, their forte was in their speed. Compared with the people in the Underworld, the speed of the experts in the ancestral sects of Spiritual Wind Sect could be ranked within the top three.

“Great, let’s go and check it out!”

Several elders hesitated before they nodded.

“You guys wait over here. We will be right back!”

Four Inborn Experts of Spiritual Wind Sect swept up swift movements just like a blast of wind as they flitted towards the Fateless Forest.

Their speed surpassed all their peer Inborn Experts.

To an Inborn Expert, one could take less than twenty minutes to travel dozens of kilometers. But the four Inborn Experts of Spiritual Wind Sect were much faster.

In less than ten minutes, the quartet came to the edge of the fire. They flapped their phoenix wings at their backs as they flew ahead.

“The soil over here is different from other places.”

“Even the trees too. This should be the territory of Remains!”

They noticed that the region where the fire was burning was different from its surroundings. After some exchanges of gazes, there were traces of horror hidden in their eyes.

With some hesitation, they continued to hover towards the center.

“That is...?”

“Gosh! This was supposed to be the site of the Remains. Why has it turned to some ruins now?

“Could it be?”

An unbelievable idea began to form in their heads as they stared blankly below at the ground covered with daunting bones.

Stone houses were radiating the fiery-red glow of flames, and charred bodies were lying on the floor.

“Could it be that the Remains have been annihilated?”
