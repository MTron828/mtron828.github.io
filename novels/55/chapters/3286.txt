3287 Did 3286 think that I’m easy to bully?

“Hehe!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

When Wang Xian heard the words of the white-robed elder from the ancient sea race, he also smiled.

“Your speed of setting the price is very fast. You have already set the price in just a few seconds.”

He asked faintly.

“This is the rule. If no one bids, you can set the price directly!”

The white-robed elder shrugged his shoulders. His eyes flickered slightly as he swept his gaze across all the customers present.

“Everyone, our ancient sea race has stood tall in the starry skies for billions of years. We uphold the principle of giving priority to our customers. We will never harm our customers’interests.”

His voice entered everyone’s ears.

Everyone present also knew that although the ancient sea race was somewhat shameless, they were all within the rules.

The main reason was still the righteous god race’s experts.

No one dared to compete with them.

No one dared to compete with them.

“It can also be said that that person is unlucky.”

Some experts thought in their hearts.

“F * ck, this daddy won’t be so unlucky, right? It’s already at the end, yet such a kid suddenly appeared. If he intentionally raises the price later, won’t this Daddy raise the price?”

At this moment, on a mountain peak in front of the auction stage, the old man holding the wine pot saw this scene and couldn’t sit still and directly stood up.

“Old Wine, the last acquired Numinous Treasure might not be auctioned by that youth. Don’t be anxious. When you place your bid, whoever dares to compete will be F * cked!”

An old man beside him said with a chuckle.

In any case, their main god race was about to land, so they could act without restraint.

“Next, we’ll begin the bidding for the last item. It’s a metal attribute acquired Numinous Treasure, a defensive type peak acquired Numinous Treasure. Similarly, we’ll start the bidding with five Calamity God Stones.”

The white-robed Elder’s voice continued to ring out from the auction stage in front of them.

The auction continued!

The white-robed elder from the ancient sea race had just finished speaking when the elder holding the wine flask stood up forcefully and shouted.

Compared to the few people just now, he was even more unrestrained.

He even directly stated that whoever fought with him would be going against him.

“Looks like the acquired spiritual treasure with the metal attribute is about to fall into the hands of the righteous God tribe!”

When everyone saw this expert from the righteous God tribe Roar so arrogantly, everyone thought to themselves.

“This acquired spiritual treasure was also auctioned off by that young man. Hehe, I wonder how he will react. If he were to raise the price himself, I think that expert from the righteous God tribe will directly attack him.”

“Let’s see if that young man is courting death. In any case, it doesn’t have much to do with us. We just earn a little less. It Won’t have much of an impact.”

“If there really is a conflict, are we going to interfere?”

“There’s no need. The others can understand. If the true God race makes a move, what can we do? Hehe!”

At the back, several ancient sea race elders were talking.

Although the Orthodox god race had somewhat disrupted their auction, everything was under their control.

The profits this time would not be too little.

“Hehe, these three acquired spiritual treasures with metal attributes were all auctioned by me. It seems that your orthodox God race thinks that I am easy to bully?”

Wang Xian watched the auction continue. He watched the last item being taken out and the strong bid from the elder of the Orthodox god race. He sneered and said.

“Huh? Three acquired Numinous Treasures with metal attributes are all his? It seems that he has obtained a great opportunity!”

“This is bad luck. Three acquired Numinous Treasures are not even sold at the price of two. This is a loss!”

“This is really bad luck. Hehe!”

Some people were stunned when they heard Wang Xian’s words. They then started discussing in a low voice

“If no one is competing, this treasure will belong to me.”

However, the old man who was holding the wine pot seemed to have not heard Wang Xian’s words. He took a sip of the wine and said directly.

“15 god-plundering stones. This is your last chance!”

Wang Xian heard his words and said calmly.

“Huh? He made a bid and raised it to 15 god-plundering stones on his own. This…”

Everyone was slightly stunned when they heard Wang Xian’s words. A look of surprise appeared on their faces.

On the auction stage, the old man in White also revealed a look of astonishment. His eyes flickered slightly.

“If you don’t Give Me Face, die!”

However, at the next moment, the face of the old man from the Righteous God race who was about to drink with a flask of wine darkened instantly when he heard Wang Xian’s words.

He waved his arm and the flask of wine in his hand emitted a golden glow. He attacked Wang Xian directly.

The sudden attack shocked everyone.

“Everyone, calm down!”

The old man in white said calmly on the auction stage. He did not stop him.

Of course, the ancient sea race did not have the ability to stop him.

“Haha!”

Wang Xian saw that the old man was actually attacking him. He laughed out loud and a terrifying murderous aura shot out from his body.

His body moved and disappeared instantly.

The next moment, his figure came to the side of the old man who was holding the wine flask!

“You are courting death. I have given you a chance. If you don’t cherish it, all of you shall die!”

Wang Xian’s sinister voice was heard by everyone from the Righteous God race.

The old man who had just thrown out the wine flask sensed a figure appearing beside him. His pupils constricted and his face was filled with horror.

“Bang!”

The next moment, a terrifying force enveloped him and instantly wiped out all his life force.

At the same time, Wang Xian waved his arm and the destructive force of the five elements covered the entire area.

“Oh No, run!”

“Oh no!”

At this moment, the expressions of the experts from the righteous god race around him changed drastically. Their eyes were filled with fear.

The strength that Wang Xian displayed made them feel terrified.

“What!”

At this moment, the expressions of everyone around them changed drastically.

That young man actually made a move.

Furthermore, how could his speed be so terrifying?

That level five universe Knight of the Righteous God race was instantly killed?

“Oh No, Stop! Don’t cause trouble in the territory of our ancient Sea Race!”

The expressions of the experts behind the ancient sea race changed drastically when they saw this scene. They shouted loudly.

“Causing trouble in your territory? hahaha!”

Wang Xian laughed maniacally.

Hualala

In the next moment, a terrifying energy swept across.

“No, no, no!”

“AH, ah, no!”

The expressions of everyone around him, as well as those from the righteous god race on the surrounding mountains, changed drastically. They were filled with shock.

The destructive power of the five elements swept across, and everyone died instantly.

Thousands of warriors and disciples from the Righteous God race, the strongest level 5 universe knights, were all killed instantly.

Even till death, they still couldn’t understand how such a terrifying existence suddenly appeared in the surrounding Lu Xing Kong.

How could someone dare to kill them!

They were the strongest force surrounding Lu Xing Kong!
