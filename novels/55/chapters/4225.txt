Chapter 4226: Catastrophe of the 4225 Behemoth

Translator: 549690339

Wang Xian was astonished when he heard Hun Dun’s words.

The Heaven origin creation-level space behemoth went on a long journey to look for food?

“The space behemoths don’t like the destructive power of the chaotic space.

However, when the calamity arrives, they will leave the space to look for food. ”

“They will devour all kinds of resources and also all kinds of living beings. ”

Hun Dun continued to speak!

“Will all the space beasts go out?”

Wang Xian asked curiously.

“Yes, including the space beasts below the Heaven’s origin realm. The resources in the universe are too little for the space beasts. Before the apocalypse, most of the space beasts at the Heaven’s origin realm are in a deep sleep. In their opinion, when the Apocalypse comes, it is the time for them to hunt and eat!”

Hun Dun opened his mouth and asked.

“A group of heaven origin cosmic behemoths. Are they acting together or alone? ”

When Wang Xian heard that, he was slightly surprised and asked.

“Most of them are acting alone. There are also four cosmic behemoths that belong to two different species. Those of the same species will act together. ” Hun Dun answered truthfully, “The strongest cosmic behemoth has already reached the level of the Great Dao and there are three of them. ”

“Three Great Dao level Space Beasts?”

When Wang Xian heard that, his pupils constricted slightly and a shocked expression appeared on his face.

“Yes. In the eyes of the Space Beasts, the Apocalypse is actually the time for them to hunt and eat. During this period, they will eat in large quantities and store food to tide over the long years after the Apocalypse. ”Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Hun Dun nodded his head.

When he understood the situation, he was also a little shocked.

To the space beasts in the starry universe, the Cataclysm was not a disaster. Instead, it was the time for them to hunt and eat.

This made him extremely shocked.

“For the Space Beasts to hunt, naturally, there would be experts hunting the space beasts. ”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he spoke.

“Yes, Dragon King. Space Beasts are full of treasures, especially those at the Heaven’s origin manifestation level. They don’t have any treasures that can revive them. All their essence is on their bodies, and their bodies contain a terrifying heaven and earth essence

“However, every powerful space beast possesses a powerful innate ability. A control-level Heaven’s origin manifestation expert would not be able to kill a space beast that has just entered the level. The life force of Space Beasts is the most terrifying existence in the various universes

“Compared to us, four or five of us at the same level would find it difficult to kill me completely. ”

Chaos replied.

Space Beasts were very powerful creatures.

From their extremely terrifying bodies, it could be seen.

Their energy was concentrated on their bodies and they had all sorts of powerful innate abilities.

They did not have intelligence and did not use other weapons or life-saving treasures.

However, each of them had all sorts of powerful talents.

Just like Little Blue House and the others, they were space beasts.

A long time ago, when Qing Yue was in danger, she was close to Little Blue House and the others, so she was able to avoid the pursuit of powerful enemies.

It was too difficult to kill a space beast!

In addition, the breakthrough of a space beast was easier than other cultivators.

If they could consume a large amount of food and energy, their strength would continue to increase.

“Not long ago, there was a group of space beasts that entered the nine-origin universe through a passageway. were they hunting for food?”

Wang Xian looked at the chaos and asked.

“It should be. However, the strength of those space beasts shouldn’t be too strong. There are many powerful space beasts. They can sense if there are any threats to them in a universe. ”

“The nine-origin universe isn’t weak. The powerful space beasts shouldn’t go to the nine-origin universe to search for food.”

Hun Dun nodded and explained.

“The space beasts eat. To the weak universe, it can be said to be a natural disaster for the space beasts. They Hunt and eat, and the strong ones in the Heaven’s origin creation realm can hunt them as well. ”

Wang Xian spoke with a thoughtful look on his face. “I believe that in every calamity, the space beasts that go out will die, right?”

“Yes, Dragon King. Every time the space beasts of the Heaven’s origin destiny realm went out to hunt and eat, there would be some who didn’t return. Those who didn’t return would die outside. However, if a space beast died, other space beasts would immediately break through and reach the Heaven’s origin destiny realm. ”

“According to what I know, there are many space beasts that can break through the shackles in the universe. The only thing that is missing is the quota. There are more than twenty of them! ”

As Hun Dun spoke, his face was filled with a solemn expression.

He was on the verge of breaking through, but there were no more quotas.

Not only did he have fifteen space beasts of the Heaven’s origin creation realm occupying his position.

He also had more than twenty competitors.

“If you kill a space beast of the Heaven’s origin creation realm, will you be able to break through?”

Wang Xian looked at Hun Dun and asked.

“There is a one in twenty chance. Unless I know that a heaven-grade cosmic beast will die immediately, I will have to depend on my luck. ”

Hun Dun replied.

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly. “Are you interested in cooperating with me? Help me investigate the traces of the heaven-grade cosmic beast. I will go and kill it. ”

“Oh? Dragon King, is your nine-origin universe going to make a move against the starry universe?”

Hun Dun was slightly taken aback and looked at Wang Xian with a stunned expression.

“I’m here to find someone to make a move. A beginner-level cosmic beast should be able to kill it. However, I don’t know much about the starry universe and I don’t know the traces of the Cosmic Beast. ”

“Provide me with information and I’ll go and kill it. If it succeeds, you can also use this opportunity to make a breakthrough. Of course, I have another condition!”

Wang Xian spoke to him.

“HMM? Dragon King, just tell me. As long as I can accept it, everything will be fine!

Hun Dun’s eyes glowed as he spoke.

“If you succeed in making a breakthrough, I will need your help to provide information on the other space beasts. During the billions of years of this calamity, you must listen to my orders! ”

Wang Xian stared at him and said.

He would help him break through the Heaven’s origin creation realm and make him listen to his orders.

As long as he listened to his orders, he would be able to ask him for information on the other space beasts in the Heaven’s origin creation realm.

At that time, he would be able to prepare for Xiao Lan and the rest’s breakthrough!

Currently, Xiao Lan and the rest had already reached the peak of the Universe Dominator realm.

However, they were still some distance away from breaking through.

However, if Wang Xian was really able to kill a cosmic beast at the Heaven’s origin creation level.

Then, after Xiao Lan and the rest devoured it, they should be able to touch the threshold of a breakthrough.

As long as they could kill another cosmic beast, Xiao Lan and the rest would be able to achieve a breakthrough!
