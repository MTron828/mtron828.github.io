3825 The Battle of 3824 had begun

“The ability of the black resurrection Lily is the reincarnation of the other shore. According to the rumors, the bright resurrection Lily is related to life and death. It seems to be related to resurrection. Both of them are extremely perverse abilities.”

Wang Xian mumbled as his eyes were filled with excitement.

In order to unleash the ability of the black resurrection Lily, he needed to fuse the black resurrection Lily into his body.

Currently, the Black Resurrection Lily of the leader of the Charm Dragon had already reached the level of a ruler at level four. It was on the same level as him.

As for the Black Resurrection Lily, Wang Xian had left one behind and allowed it to grow on the ancestral tree.

This also resulted in Wang Xian possessing the ability of the resurrection reincarnation.

This was a powerful means that could change the battle situation and save his life.

At present, Wang Xian still had many life-saving methods.

A spatial teleportation scroll could be used once more.

A Shadow Dragon Avatar’s law aspect skill could dodge a fatal blow.

In addition to the reincarnation of the black resurrection Lily, it could be retraced.

The black resurrection Lily on the ancestral tree was also at the level four overlord realm.

It could rewind for four seconds!

This was extremely powerful and terrifying!

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

At this moment, the sound of the Tai Chi Dragon Plate could be heard from the side.

Wang Xian looked over and a smile appeared on his face.

The Tai Chi Dragon Plate had finally completely recovered!

“The Tai Chi Dragon Plate has recovered. I can leave this place now!”

Wang Xian mumbled. He could leave the situation here to Lan Qingyue.

On the other hand, he was preparing to hunt down some gods who believed in the universe.

With the strength of the Tai Chi Dragon Plate and the five elements grinding mill, it should be very easy to hunt them down!

“Qingyue, the Tai Chi Dragon Plate has already recovered. I’m preparing to hunt down some experts who believe in the universe. You can watch over this place!”

Wang Xian came before Lan Qingyue and spoke to her.

“Alright. Xiao Xian, take care of your safety.”

Lan qingyue nodded and instructed Wang Xian.

“Don’t worry, I’ll Be Fine!”

Wang Xian smiled.

After chatting with Lan Qingyue for a while, Wang Xian moved his body and stepped on the five elements millstone. He quickly headed to the outer area.

He took out the communication stone plate and checked the current situation.

“Huh?”

At this moment, a look of astonishment appeared on his face.

In the communication stone plate, there was a piece of information that caused a huge commotion.

Over at the skeleton clan, they had encountered a terrifying attack from the universe of gods.

It was suspected that the experts who believed in the universe had subdued the space behemoth that was at the level of a ruler. They had set up an ambush for the skeleton clan. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Dozens of skeleton experts who were at the level of a ruler were sent into the belief rune.

The faith runes controlled the skeleton experts, causing them to appear on another battlefield. They surrounded and attacked the devil experts, causing the devil experts to suffer heavy losses.

“The Faith Gods of the universe, they actually subdued a ruler-level level 5 space beast. How did they do it? Did they rely on the faith runes?”

“The skeleton race actually had a large number of rulers controlled. This… This is something we can’t guard against!”

“It’s not just the skeleton race, there are many disciples of top-tier races being controlled. Some of our information can be found in the Faith Universe!”

“This faith universe method is quite powerful. They can actually make our great beings become their believers. This…”

Within the communication stone plate, countless great beings’disciples were discussing.

The gods who believed in the universe could forcibly convert the Great Beings’disciples of the 9-origin universe into their believers through the belief runes. This also resulted in them being able to obtain some information about the 9-origin universe.

As they obtained some information, the great beings of the skeleton race were ambushed.

After they forcefully converted the experts of the skeleton race into believers, they were able to control a skeleton army, which was abnormally terrifying.

This was completely using experts of the nine-origin universe to attack the nine-origin universe.

“The gods that believe in the universe rely on a level five space beast. This is a huge problem for us!”

“A level five space beast can only be dealt with by the ancient god of the Dragon Palace who feeds the Kun Master Dragon.”

In the communication stone plate, an expert’s disciple mentioned that the ancient god feeds the Kun master.

The belief of the gods controlled a level five space beast. This was a huge problem.

In the current nine-origin universe, the only one who could fight against such a space beast was the ancient god who feeds the Kun master!

Wang Xian looked at the messages one by one, and his eyes sparkled.

“It seems that the belief of the gods in this universe is indeed not simple. However, the more experts you have, the better!”

Wang Xian mumbled as his eyes sparkled.

He contacted bei Shuang.

Currently, bei Shuang and the rest were in charge of the hunting squad.

The entire hunting squad was led by bei Shuang. There were also the eight-limbed demonic fiend and the rest.

The eight-limbed demonic fiend was the poisonous horned dragon species of the Dragon Palace. They were also able to parasitize the bodies of the gods who believed in the universe.

However, this parasitism could no longer parasitize the gods of the same level.

The eight-limbed demon Fiend and the others, who were masters of the second level, could only parasitize peak-level venerables.

This was because the gods of the same level had the power of faith in their minds.

The omnipresent chanting and praying would make the eight-limbed demon fiend and the others unable to hold on.

After the message was sent, bei Shuang quickly sent a message.

He immediately flew over and met up with him!

Time passed day by day.

After he flew for a year, another huge piece of news was sent out!

The royal family’s hunting squad had been completely wiped out!

This was the news sent by the royal family themselves.

There were a total of four experts at the ruler Tier 7 realm. They had powerful trump cards, but they were actually ambushed by the gods of the belief universe and were all wiped out!

When this news came out, it caused a huge sensation.

“It can’t be. Although the strength of the royal race is the weakest among the peak races, this hunting party also has four tier 7 overlord realm experts. The four experts must have powerful trump cards in their hands. They were actually eliminated?”

“Hiss, a hunting party of a peak race was actually eliminated. This is troublesome!”

“The gods that believe in the cosmos are too terrifying. With the royal race annihilated, we are actually at a complete disadvantage!”

When countless expert disciples heard this news, their faces revealed expressions of shock.

Even the experts from the peak races were extremely solemn when they heard this news!

Four rulers at the Type 7 realm had been killed. The power that was used to hunt them was extremely terrifying.

All the hunting squads of the peak races began to be cautious!

At this time, the royal family also issued a warning.

“The gods of the cosmos can use their faith runes to forcefully convert our disciples of the 9-origin Cosmos into their own believers. These believers will report many things to them, and some of the converted disciples even managed to sneak into our midst. We must be careful!”
