Translator: 549690339

The God of cooking restaurant was the best and most famous restaurant in Xuanyuan City.

The restaurant used powerful beasts and all kinds of spiritual herbs as ingredients. Ever since it appeared in the world, its reputation had spread far and wide.

“Boss, do you still have any seats here?”

After entering the God of cooking restaurant, Feng Lingtian shouted at the waiter inside.

“What a coincidence, young master. There are still a few tables upstairs. Please come in!”

The waiter in grey warmly welcomed them and led them upstairs.

“Eh, the food here smells so good!”

Xiao Yu sniffed the fragrance around him and said in surprise.

The eyes of the other girls also lit up.

Beauties loved delicious food the most, especially since they would not gain weight no matter how much they ate.

“Go objectively. Please come in!”

The waiter in gray shouted and pointed at a square table inside. The table wasn’t small, enough for everyone to sit down!

“Sisters-in-law, this way please!”

Feng Lingtian extended his hand with a warm smile on his face.

To him, the girls in front of him were real masters.

One of them was the sister of the Dragon King, and she tortured him to death. The others were also the Dragon King’s women, so they had to be respectful.

“Good boy!”

Xiao Yu smiled and walked inside with a smile on his face.

“This Dragon King of the Dragon Gate is really insolent. He dares to challenge our Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect. He really brought this upon himself!”

“Hehe, Fairy Hua, an immortal can not lose face. Otherwise, the whole world will laugh at him. This Dragon Gate doesn’t have any disciples at all. I think it will only add to the laughter when I go on stage tomorrow. I alone can crush all the young disciples of the Dragon Gate!”

“Of course. With your strength, young master Yuwen Yue, I think you will be able to get into the top ten!”

“Haha, although I am not as strong as my brother and a little weaker than Hua Gujiang, I am still very confident in getting into the top ten!”

“Xian ‘er naturally believes in young master Yuwen Yue’s strength!”

Just as they walked over, they suddenly heard a voice from the side.

Instantly, everyone frowned and looked to the side.

A group of six people, three young men and three women.

Two of them, Xiao Yu and the others recognized them at a glance.

The second most outstanding disciple of the Yuwen clan, Yu Wenyue, and Fairy Hua of the Holy Medicine Immortal sect.

“HMPH, how arrogant. One person crushing a young disciple of the Dragon Gate? Those words are really exaggerated! The battle hasn’t even started yet and you guys are already bragging here. How arrogant!”

Before Xiao Yu and the rest could say anything, Feng Lingtian who was sitting at the side said in disdain!

“Huh?”

The six people who were chatting at the side immediately frowned and looked at Feng Lingtian and the rest.

As their gazes swept over, Yu Wenyue and Fairy Hua raised their brows.

“So it’s Feng Lingtian from the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect. Watch your words and don’t cause trouble for your father!”

The corners of Yuwen Yue’s mouth curled up slightly as she stared at Feng Lingtian and said disdainfully.

An immortal sect that only had one middle-level immortal was not in the Yuwen clan’s eyes. His father was also a middle-level immortal.

When Feng Lingtian heard his words, his face turned dark and gloomy.

“Be careful with your words? I think you should be careful with your words. Pleasing beautiful women isn’t like this!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Xiao Yu took a step forward and looked at Yu Wenyue coldly.

“Little girl, this is not trying to please, but telling a fact!”

Fairy Hua slowly stood up and stared at Xiao Yu coldly.

“We are just telling a fact. You guys who only know how to brag here, Your Holy Medicine Holy Doctor Immortal sect will know what embarrassment is Tomorrow!”

Xiao Yu snorted coldly and said with slight disdain.

“Embarrassment? Based on your Tiny Dragon Gate?”

Fairy Hua raised her head slightly and stared at Xiao Yu.

“Tiny Dragon Gate, then should we give it a try?”

Xiao Yu revealed a trace of a cold smile and stared at her without showing any weakness.

“Fight? Based on You?”

Fairy Hua’s gaze turned cold. “Little girl, you’d better scram home!”

“Haha, interesting. I heard that the top five on the Peerless Beauty list all have the strength of the infant realm. I’ll let you see the strength of our Dragon Gate with one hand!”

Xiao Yu’s arm moved, and a bone whip appeared in his hand. His eyes revealed a mocking expression. “Don’t let me think that you’re just a vixen who knows how to seduce men!”

“You’re sharp-tongued. I’ll teach you a lesson on behalf of Your Parents!”

Fairy Hua’s expression was a little awkward when she heard Xiao Yu’s words. The emerald-green bracelet on her wrist moved, and a vine also appeared in her hand.

“Haha, I’ll Let You Attack First. Otherwise, you won’t have a chance to attack!”

Xiao Yu laughed loudly and said mockingly.

“You’re looking for a beating. See if I won’t break your mouth!”

A trace of murderous intent appeared in Fairy Hua’s eyes. She waved her arm, and the vine in her hand directly attacked Xiao Yu.

“Eh? What’s going on? They’re actually fighting!”

“That’s Fairy Hua. Who’s the other girl?”

“She’s from the Dragon Gate. That’s one of the immortals from the Dragon Gate. Hiss, Yuwen Yue from the Yuwen clan is also here!”

On the second floor of the God of cooking restaurant, there were also some disciples from other immortal sects who came here to eat. When they saw the two girls who suddenly attacked, they were shocked.

When Feng Lingtian saw little feather attack, he took a step back.

When Yuwen Yue saw fairy hua attack, she also looked at her coldly.

Fairy Hua had the strength of the infant realm. How could an unknown little girl deal with her.

When the waiter in gray saw this scene, he wiped the cold sweat on his forehead and did not dare to persuade her.

This heaven’s favorite from the Yuwen clan did not stop her. Even his boss did not dare to stop her.

“Pa!”

Fairy Hua’s cane swung over. A trace of disdain appeared in Xiao Yu’s eyes. He waved the cane in his hand lightly and directly welcomed it.

“Pa!”

The two long whips collided. However, in an instant, the bone whip suddenly grew longer and directly hit Fairy Hua’s face.

A heavy sound rang out. In an instant, a long bloody scar appeared on her fair and delicate face.

Fairy Hua was instantly stunned. She felt the pain and blood on her face, and her expression changed drastically.

“Ah, you’re courting death!”

Her expression became a little twisted, and her aura shook violently. The dense wood attribute on her body caused thorns to appear on the wooden floor.

“Pa!”

However, at this moment, the bone whip in Little Feather’s hand swung out once again.

Fairy Hua’s expression changed drastically, and a wooden shield instantly appeared in front of her.

However, the wooden shield was directly broken, and the bone whip once again landed on her beautiful face.

This time, Xiao Yu did not stop. The bone whip in his hand grew longer and directly wrapped around her entire body.

“Bang!”

She pulled heavily, and Fairy Hua instantly fell in front of her.

“High and Mighty Fairy Hua? How about this little girl from a small dragon sect?”

Xiao Yu stared at the Fairy Hua lying in front of her mockingly and asked with a smile.

“I’ll kill you!”
