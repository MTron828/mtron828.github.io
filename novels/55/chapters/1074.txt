Chapter 1075: 1076 green vine fruit

Translator: 5496903

In the seamount region, there were many mountains that stood on the sea. Birds and beasts were flying on the mountains.

The deep ocean that was tens of thousands of meters deep and the towering mountains made the entire region extremely magnificent.

Wang Xian floated in the sky and looked down at the ocean below. His Dragon Eyes of light and dark fire swept across the mountains.

The eight-eyed eel and the eight-clawed ferocious beasts liked to attach themselves to the mountains.

According to the guards of Shenghai town, thousands of eight-clawed ferocious beasts had gathered together a few hours ago.

Eight-clawed ferocious beasts lived alone and usually would not gather together. Once a group gathered together, there would definitely be powerful demonic beasts controlling them from behind.

In order to prevent the danger from happening, they had to nip this danger in the bud during this critical period. Otherwise, when the other three groups of ferocious beasts arrived, along with the eight-eyed eel, the entire Shenghai town would be finished.

“Peng!”

“There’s only one eight-clawed ferocious beast here, and it’s at transcendent-level rank 3. We’ve already taken care of it. Come, let’s go to the next mountain!”

There were close to 2,000 people in the team. Most of them were experts at transcendent-level rank 4 and above. They were divided into a total of 100 teams.

Each team was led by a transcendent-level rank 5 expert, and a small squadron was led by a transcendent-level rank 6 expert.

In addition, there were also level seven supernatural realm experts patrolling the surroundings. Their speed of searching for a mountain peak was extremely fast.

Once they discovered an eight-clawed ferocious beast, they would kill it without any hesitation.

Searching for a mountain peak would take at most one minute. The efficiency was extremely high. There were over a thousand mountains. Based on their speed, they were also extremely fast.

“Eh? There are over a thousand eight-clawed ferocious beasts and a few eight-eyed eels gathered around the mountain peak in front of us!”

Wang Xian had been on high alert the entire time. After advancing for more than 2,000 meters, he realized that there were more than a thousand eight-clawed ferocious beasts gathered around a mountain peak in front of them.

“There are more than a thousand eight-clawed ferocious beasts around the green mountain peak in front of us. Everyone, gather first and destroy those eight-clawed ferocious beasts. Don’t let the other eight-eyed eels escape!”

He immediately gave an order.

“Yes!”

Below them, the instructors and the experts of Shenghai town responded. They looked ahead with astonishment in their eyes.

They were so far away that they didn’t even notice it. Wang Xian, who was standing above them, had already noticed it. This made them very surprised.

A group of more than a dozen level 7 supernatural realm experts looked at each other and ordered the small team below to surround them quietly.

“Fight, kill them!”

The visibility in the deep sea was much lower than on land. When they were 1,000 meters away from the mountain, the group of Type 7 transcendents noticed the beasts ahead and shouted out.

In an instant, the small teams charged forward, with nearly 2,000 elites killing a group of 8-clawed beasts with ease.

Even the 8-eyed eel beasts could not escape the pursuit of the Type 7 transcendents.

“Our commander’s insight is so strong!”

“No wonder he was the commander of this operation. He was able to discover the ferocious beasts from such a distance!”

“In an hour or two at most, we’ll be able to search the entire seamount region!”

Some of the experts from holy sea town discussed with admiration on their faces. They began to store the corpses of the ferocious beasts into their interspatial rings.

“Green vine fruit! It’s a green vine fruit!”

At this moment, a cry of surprise came from the crowd. Everyone quickly looked over.

“Green vine fruit! It’s actually a rare green vine fruit!”

At this moment, Hai Wen, who was standing beside the mountain peak, saw the fruit growing on the mountain peak. His eyes lit up with excitement.

Green vine fruit was a water-type spirit fruit. It was one of the rarest types of spirit herbs, and it had a spirit-type effect.

There were two types of spirit herbs and spirit fruits. One was a normal spirit fruit that only increased one’s strength, and the other was a spirit fruit that could help one comprehend a divine ability.

Some spirit fruits had a special energy that could make one hallucinate. For example, after consuming the fruit, one would feel like they were in an unfamiliar place.

This kind of strange effect could make one comprehend a special divine ability.

The most precious thing about the green vine fruit was that it could allow a water element cultivator to comprehend a divine ability that could fill the sky with clear water. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

A fruit that could both increase water element spiritual energy and help people comprehend a divine ability, its value could be imagined.

This kind of green vine fruit was very precious, ten times more than a medicinal pill of the same level.

Hai Wen looked at the fruit and his body moved, directly arriving in front of the green fruit.

The fist-sized fruit was red and there was a layer of green water flowing on it. It looked very magical.

He reached out his hand to grab the green vine fruit excitedly.

This kind of fruit was not something that could be bought with spirit stones. Even with his background, it was still a great opportunity for him.

“Whoosh!”

However, just as he reached out his hand to grab it, a figure grabbed the fruit and held it in his hand.

“It has been rumored that there is a green vine fruit in the sea mountain region. As expected, this green vine fruit will be handed over to the commander-in-chief!”

An extraordinary level 7 powerhouse from Shenghai town grabbed the fruit in his hand and said before flying towards Wang Xian.

“You... This is what I discovered...”

Hai Wen’s expression changed slightly. Looking at the middle-aged man who ignored him, his face turned gloomy.

“Logically speaking, all the treasures obtained should be distributed by the commander. If the treasures don’t say much, then they should be distributed by the Commander!”

“Fruits like the green vine fruit should naturally be distributed by the commander. After all, Commander Wang is so awesome. Without them, we would be in a lot of trouble!”

“That’s right. Those who are capable will get them. We don’t have any objections about the treasures being distributed by the Commander!”

Some of the people around saw the situation. Although they were envious, they still said with a smile.

The treasure was given to those who were capable. Although Wang Xian didn’t make a move, he could be said to be the core of the entire team. Naturally, the treasure that he obtained would have to be given to him first.

No one had any objection, and no one felt that it was unreasonable.

Even if everyone wanted the treasure.

Hai Wen listened to the conversations around him, clenching his fists tightly. He gritted his teeth and looked up coldly.

“Continue!”

An order came from above, and the group continued to search.

“Damn it, damn it, I was the one who got it first!”

Hai Wen roared out in anger. This green vine fruit was extremely important to him.

His strength had only broken through two days ago, and with this green vine fruit, not only would he be able to build a solid foundation, but he would also be able to comprehend the clear water sky covering divine ability.

Even if he could not comprehend it, it would be extremely beneficial to his future cultivation.

“If it wasn’t for the command of the king, how could you have discovered it!”

Zhang Yushu, who was at the side, saw Hai Wen’s angry appearance and curled his lips as he said softly.

“Zhang Yushu, shut up!”

When Hai Wen heard his words, he raised his head and stared at him coldly.

When Zhang Yushu saw his angry gaze, he quickly shut his mouth. Hai Wen had suddenly broken through to transcendence level 6, which was already much stronger than him.

In addition to his background, he didn’t dare to offend him.
