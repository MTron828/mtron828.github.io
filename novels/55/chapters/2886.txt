Chapter 2887: 2,887 dragon punishment 3

“Five years ago, you attacked our Dragon Palace. Five years later, our Dragon Palace came over. Don’t you feel that time has passed very quickly?”

In the void in front of Mount Wu, the Dragon Palace and the Imperial Court of the Cheng Witch Association were facing each other from afar.

Wang Xian looked at the Wizard Overlord and the rest in front of him. He stood up from the Dragon Throne and revealed a faint smile.

If not for this situation, his words would be like greeting an old friend that he had not seen for a long time.

“Dragon King, don’t be so arrogant. It Won’t be long before the end of Your Dragon Palace!”

When the overlord of the imperial court heard Wang Xian’s words, he could not maintain his calm at all. He growled in a low voice with a face full of fury.

“Hahaha, a stray dog. How dare you bark like that!”

Wang Xian laughed loudly and shouted with a face full of mockery.

His words made everyone in the imperial court look extremely embarrassed.

“Dragon King, I don’t know who gave you the confidence to attack the Heaven Wizard Region and Our Wizard Association!”

“Is it that Old Thing, Sky Formation?”

The wizard stared at Wang Xian coldly and questioned him in a stern manner.

“Haha, Wizard, as long as I’m alive, Your Wizard Association will be on tenterhooks for a day. Now That I’m here, you should give me a warm welcome. After all, it’s about to end. You Can’t keep worrying about me coming here!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Sky Formation laughed loudly on Little Blue’s body, and he stared at the Wizard with a murderous gaze.

“Worry? Our Wizard Association was able to kill you once before, and we can still kill you now. Dragon King, Our Wizard Association has been standing in the Sky Wizard region for a billion years. Do you think that you can destroy us with just your strength?”

“Today, I’ll make you pay a terrible price!”

“Today, I will let you, an arrogant fellow, witness the strength of the Witch Formation Association!”

The aura of the Wizard charged forward with a furious look on his face.

“Alright, Alright. Today, I want to witness the strength of the Witch Formation Association. I want to witness the strength of the Witch Formation Association that has been standing for a billion years!”

“I hope that you will not disappoint the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian’s gaze was sharp as he raised his head slightly and spoke loudly.

“Every single battle will be recorded in the history books. There will be a battle’s name. Why don’t I name it first?”

“Let’s call it the Battle of Dragon Punishment!”

He continued to speak indifferently.

The Battle of Dragon Punishment!

This was also the first battle where the purebred divine dragon stepped into the resplendent starry sky and made his real appearance!

“The Battle of Dragon Punishment?”

Upon hearing Wang Xian’s words, the overlord and the rest had an embarrassed look on their faces.

“Arrogant!”

“Arrogant!”

The two of them roared furiously and stared at Wang Xian coldly.

“Hahaha, members of the Dragon Palace, Get Ready!”

Wang Xian laughed out loud and waved his arm.

Boom! Boom! Boom

All the members of the Dragon Palace immediately flew down from Xiao Lan’s small house.

A group of emperor-level experts of the dragon palace floated around the nine wind divine dragons.

A vast and terrifying aura rushed forward.

“Are these all the emperor-level experts of the Dragon Palace?”

“Hiss, including those nine creatures, there are more than twenty emperor-level experts of the Dragon Palace!”

“This…”

After all the emperor-level experts of the Dragon Palace appeared, all the experts and disciples of the Wizard Association and the Imperial Court on Wu Mountain in front of them were shocked.

There were more than twenty godly monarchs. Even if they did not erupt with all their might, this terrifying aura still made them feel extremely stifled.

Even the expressions of the wizard Emperor Lord and the others changed drastically.

There were more than twenty godly monarchs in the Dragon Palace and more than twenty godly monarchs in the Dragon Palace.

In just five years, the number of godly monarchs in the dragon palace had almost doubled.

“Hiss, look, those are all godly monarchs of the Dragon Palace. Why are there so many of them!”

“There are more than twenty divine emperors. Can the Magus Union hold them off?”

“There are more than twenty of them. The Dragon Palace is actually so powerful. No wonder they dared to charge over. This force is too terrifying!”

At that moment, in the distance, experts from some factions of the Heaven Magus realm were hiding in the surrounding void.

This vast battle had a great impact on the Heaven Magus realm. The experts from the other factions of the Heaven Magus realm naturally came over to investigate.

When they saw the Divine Emperors from the Dragon Palace, they were filled with fear.

“Wu Mountain’s fog rain array, Rise!”

“Heaven’s legacy killing array, Rise!”

“Wu Ying Array, Rise!”

“Connecting Mountain’s vast Earth Array, Rise!”

“Magus World Array, Rise!”

The Magus’gaze swept past the Divine Emperors from the Dragon Palace. A cold expression appeared on his face as he roared loudly.

* Buzz Buzz Buzz! *

“Buzz Buzz Buzz!”

“Buzz Buzz Buzz!”

When the Magus called out the name of a large array, the entire Wu mountain trembled.

The vast array instantly covered an area of 100 billion kilometers, enveloping the entire Wu mountain.

A vast wave of energy shot straight into the void.

Seven large arrays slowly rose, and the extremely terrifying energy crazily charged towards the surroundings.

Clouds and mist enveloped Mount Wu.

A vast shadow with a bamboo hat on his head floated in the middle of Mount Wu!

Mount Wu was connected, and killing intent rose up everywhere!

The entire Witchcraft Association’s Witchcraft Mountain had become a world of witchcraft.

The seven formations formed an incomparably powerful defense!

Wang Xian stood on the dragon throne and watched the terrifying formations rise up one after another. His eyes flashed with astonishment.

“Our formation hasn’t risen for hundreds of millions of years. Dragon King, I would like to see what you can use to break through our defenses!”

“If you can’t destroy us today, the next thing we will do is to destroy you!”

The Wizard glared at Wang Xian and shouted sternly.

“All the disciples of the Wizard Association, prepare to attack!”

The Wizard raised his hands and the Purgatory World Formation diagram appeared in the sky above him. Then, he continued to give orders.

“Roar!”

“Kill!”

A voice filled with killing intent reverberated in the center of the Heaven Wizard territory.

Waves of energy gathered from the Wizard Mountains.

“Come on!”

The Overlord held the scepter of light in his hand and his body slowly floated up. Two groups of Holy Wings of light appeared behind his back.

“The Battle of Dragon Punishment, begin!”

“Kill!”

Wang Xian’s face turned cold as he ordered loudly.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

“Woo Woo Woo!”

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

When Wang Xian gave the order, the Celestial Emperors of the Dragon Palace who were at the forefront let out a roar.

They immediately turned into battle mode as violent energy soared into the sky.

In the middle, the nine wind divine dragons raised their heads and flapped their huge wings. They were the first to bear the brunt of the attack. Their eyes were filled with fighting spirit as they charged forward.

In front of the Wu Mountain, there were seven terrifying arrays.

When the Nine Wind Divine Dragons attacked, the humongous Wu shadow above the Wu Mountain carried a powerful aura as it attacked the nine divine dragons.

In the center of the Humongous Wu Shadow, there was a terrifying killing intent.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

“We are the Wind Divine Dragons!”

The three wind divine dragons with stage two divine emperors in the center swayed their bodies and flapped their wings.

The next moment, heaven and earth changed, and a violent wind descended on the void!
