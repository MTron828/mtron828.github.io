Chapter 1507: 1507 if I become a demon, there will be no demon 2 in the world

“Kowtow three times before the demon, to the millions of souls that are about to die!”

“I want to be a demon, there will be no demon in the world!”

“In the midst of killing, Eternity!”

An extremely calm voice came out from Wang Xian’s mouth. He kowtowed towards the front with an expressionless face.

He was not kowtowing to the group of young men in front of him, nor was he kowtowing to the huge ancient demon city.

Furthermore, he was bowing to the millions of people who were about to die!

Because he was going to kill today!

“What? What are you talking about?”

“Say it again for me!”

Ten meters ahead, the young man on his mount was slightly stunned when he heard Wang Xian’s words. He raised his head slightly and stared at Wang Xian as he commanded.

However, Wang Xian ignored him. With his pitch-black eyes, he bowed three times towards the front.

“B * Stard, our young master Mo is asking you a question. Do You Want to Die?”

A young man saw that Wang Xian did not reply. He waved his arm and a whip appeared in his hand. Then, he swung it at Wang Xian.

Crack

The whip landed on Wang Xian’s body and was blocked by the dark energy.

At this moment, Wang Xian stood up slowly. A terrifying aura was emitted slowly!

“Huh?”

The group of young men in front stared at Wang Xian in astonishment.

“I’m asking you a question! Open your mouth!”

The young man who was holding the long whip let out a low growl. A ferocious look appeared on his face as he swung the long whip in his hand again.

“What happened to the guy who was shrouded in darkness? Is there something wrong with his mind?”

“Maybe he has a death wish!”

Around them, some people looked over with a face full of mockery.

The ancient demon city was filled with sin. When they saw a person being killed, they would not sympathize with him. Instead, they were extremely excited because of the bloody scene.

Crack

The whip landed heavily on Wang Xian’s body once again. A mocking sound was heard as well.

Wang Xian raised his head slowly. His pair of abyss-like eyes were staring straight ahead.

“F * CK, tear him apart for me!”

The young man standing at the front was slightly shocked when he saw Wang Xian’s emotionless pitch-black pupils. He roared furiously.

“Roar!”

His body moved and his mount attacked Wang Xian directly!

“I have already offered sacrifices to your souls. So, die!”

“Boom!”

Wang Xian looked at the ferocious beast attacking him and let out a low growl. The seemingly solid dark energy on his body began to churn!

“The one who dies is you, you damn thing!”

When the young man heard Wang Xian’s words, a ferocious look appeared on his face as he roared loudly.

Crash

However, the moment the gigantic mouth of the ferocious beast reached Wang Xian’s head, a pitch-black claw grabbed the mouth of the ferocious beast.

The Claw was covered with scales. The pitch-black dragon claw emitted a terrifying aura.

The Dragon Claw tore the ferocious beast into two halves.

The young man who was sitting on the ferocious beast was completely stunned.

“Roar!”

At this moment, a terrifying roar suddenly came from in front of him.

The roar was filled with a brutal and bloody aura. It was as though a demon had returned from the abyss.

The terrifying dark energy rushed towards the surroundings.

The young man widened his eyes and stared in front of him in disbelief.

“Ah!”

Following that, a terrifying scream sounded.

The young man widened his eyes and stared at his body, his expression filled with fear.

The terrifying dark energy rushed towards him. His body, his flesh, and blood actually slowly melted, as if they were slowly being devoured by the darkness.

He screamed in horror.

“Roar!”

Another roar was heard. A gigantic creature appeared in front of the ancient demon city.

A black dragon-scaled demonic dragon that was nearly a hundred meters in size appeared. Its entire body was filled with terror. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Waves of dark energy surrounded the body of the demonic dragon.

Its pitch-black dragon head, claws, body, and tail were not ferocious, but they gave off a brutal aura.

Boom

Wang Xian, who had completely transformed into the Dark Demon Dragon, swept his dragon claws at everyone around him who was filled with shock.

“What kind of monster is this? Run!”

“Run! Run!”

The person who was taunting them earlier was filled with shock and panic.

From the first whistle, they had a bad premonition.

However, everything happened too quickly.

The dozen or so young men who bore the brunt of the attack turned into dry bones with their mouths wide open.

“Ahhhh!”

However, the miserable shrieks rang out in an instant. The hundreds of people around them were corroded by the dark energy and died.

The descent of the demonic dragon brought about destruction.

If Wang Xian became a demon, the demons in the world would not be qualified to become a demon.

Just like how, if I became a demon, there would be no demons in the world.

“Roar!”

The 100-meter long body of the demon dragon stared at the city in front of him emotionlessly with its dragon eyes. It charged forward with a violent aura.

“What’s the situation? What is that thing?”

“Early warning, early warning. There are powerful creatures attacking our ancient demon city!”

“You are courting death. How dare you come to our ancient demon city to cause trouble!”

On the city wall, the city guards looked at the commotion outside. They stared at Wang Xian, who was a hundred meters tall, with a face full of shock as they shouted loudly.

Boom

Before they could finish their words, Wang Xian’s terrifying figure rammed toward the city wall with brute force.

It was the strength of his physical body. He rammed toward the city wall that was a few hundred meters tall and a few tens of meters thick.

Under the horrified gazes of the ancient demon city, the entire city wall was smashed open. The city guards on top of it died instantly.

“A month ago, someone from your ancient demon city surrounded and attacked a woman. Today, all of you will die!”

Wang Xian rushed over and spat out cruel words.

His voice covered the entire ancient demon city.

This caused everyone in the ancient demon city who didn’t know what was happening to be stunned.

“F * ck, who is so arrogant in our ancient Devil City?”

“Those who are courting death dare to provoke our ancient Devil City. Even first-rate forces don’t dare to provoke us!”

“Who is so arrogant? Ancient Devil City has another corpse!”

When some people heard this voice, a sinister expression appeared on their faces.

In the city, some experts also coldly looked over.

Boom! Boom! Boom

However, very soon, a deafening sound was heard.

At the north gate of the ancient demon city, Wang Xian used his huge body to attack all the living beings and buildings.

Without any hesitation, he swept his dragon tail and turned all the buildings into ruins.

Everyone died immediately under his dragon tail.

“This is bad. This creature is very strong. Let’s Dodge it quickly!”

“Seventh level of the Seethrough realm. It’s at least seventh level of the Seethrough realm. Let’s run! Let’s Run!”

At the north gate, everyone in the ancient Demon City saw the demonic dragon with monstrous demonic flames. Its tail swept across an area of a thousand meters, and their faces were filled with fear.

They all roared loudly and ran back in fear.

Wang Xian did not chase after them. He destroyed everything in the ancient demon city wantonly.

All the buildings, all the people.

He wanted to turn this place into a ruin, a land of death!

Leave No one alive!
