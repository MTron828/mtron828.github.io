“Attack!”

Wang Xian shouted in a low voice. Ling Ling took the book of Water Forbidden Spell and began to release the forbidden spell on it!

Wang Xian’s five elements millstone and the Unicorn Bull attacked the chaos helminth once again!

The powerful attack once again easily suppressed the chaos helminth.

Even if the helminth attacked with all its might, it still couldn’t suppress the energy and attacks of Wang Xian and the rest!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The screams of the Chaos Helminth rang out continuously.

The injuries on its body were getting heavier and heavier!

It was unable to resist. This chaos helminth was completely unable to resist!

(‘I will be able to kill it very soon! ”

Wang Xian looked at this scene with a hint of excitement on his face.

Every part of the Chaos Helminth’s body was an intense treasure trove.

Its teeth could create weapons that were even more powerful than connate true treasures.

Its flesh and blood were the greatest resources for Earth elemental cultivators.

It was no exaggeration to say that this chaos worm beast could make the dragon palace produce at least 20 disciples at the peak of the universe ruler realm!

This was the strength of a heavenly yuan creation realm expert’s corpse!

Furthermore, if one had the opportunity and quota, one could produce a heaven origin creator!

Of course, in the nine-origin universe, one could forget about producing an earth element heaven origin creator!

The Earth Element Heaven origin creator was the powerhouse from the

Xuanwu clan.

Wang Xian and the rest were besieging the chaos helminth. The life force of this chaos helminth was getting lesser and lesser!

At the same time, at the location outside, the other two chaos helminth were also suffering from terrifying attacks!

The Elven empress and the 12 ancestral warlocks, their attacks were not something the chaos helminth beasts could withstand!

The two chaos helminth beasts were also covered in blood!

The attacks of the 12 ancestral warlocks looked extremely strange.

Curse, darkness, chaos.

All sorts of energies were directed at the Chaos Helminth Beast!

The two Chaos Helminth Beasts’vitality was also decreasing!

“The three chaos beasts have been completely suppressed. These three chaos beasts are about to be killed.”

“Lord Twelve Ancestral Warlocks and the others are so powerful. That Chaos Beast is completely defenseless in their hands. Their attacks are also very strange and terrifying. ”

(‘I wonder which Lord is able to kill the Chaos Beast first. The Dragon King is completely covered by nine types of energies. The battle inside can not be seen clearly. It is the same with the elven Empress! ”

Outside, all the powerful disciples of the 9 -origin universe were discussing non-stop.

The battle this time could be said to have shaken them greatly!

The battle between the Heaven origin creation realm experts was so terrifying!

“Roar Roar Roar! ”

Right at this moment, the miserable cries of the Chaos Beast sounded out!

The body of the chaos worm beast located at the 12 ancestral warlocks was trembling violently, and its life force was rapidly disappearing. This was the power of a curse, an extremely terrifying power.

That Chaos Helminth Beast was about to be destroyed!

Very soon, that Chaos Helminth Beast was completely destroyed!

This caused the disciples who were watching the battle to reveal shocked expressions.

“The 12th Ancestral Magus was the first to destroy the Chaos Helminth Beast! ”

“The 12th Ancestral Magus of the Magus race is so powerful. They aren’t truly a heavenly fate, yet they were able to erupt with such terrifying power. They’re truly formidable! ”

A large number of powerful disciples exclaimed!

After the 12 ancestral wizards killed the Chaos Worm Beast, they immediately put away the corpse and looked to the side.

“The Elven Empress Can Kill the chaos worm beast very soon. The life force of the chaos worm beast over at the Dragon King’s place is also rapidly weakening. ”

The ancestral wizard with ten arms glanced over and said!

“It’s not surprising that the elven empress is able to destroy this chaos helminth beast. How can the Dragon King be so fast? The Chaos Helminth Beast’s resistance and energy are completely suppressed. His strength isn’t as simple as what we saw! ”

The ancestral wizard in the center looked in the direction of the nine origin dragon region and said.

His eyes were filled with shock and amazement!

With the Dragon King’s strength and the strength of his mount, how could he suppress a Chaos Helminth beast perfectly?

And now, the life force of the Chaos Helminth Beast was disappearing rapidly and it was about to die. That also meant that the Dragon King and the rest had the strength to fight against a controlling level heaven origin creation stage powerhouse!

Buzz

Just as they were guessing, they were at the place where the nine-colored energy covered.

The nine-colored light slowly disappeared.

Wang Xian and the Linniu flew out.

As for the position inside, the Chaos Helminth had already disappeared!

It had already been stored away by Wang Xian!

Three against one, he killed it easily!

Wang Xian killed the chaos helminth so quickly. Not far away, the elven empress looked over with a stunned expression!

“It seems that you have hidden your strength, Dragon King! ”

The Elven empress could not help but say something. She then looked at the chaos helminth in front of her and said, “It seems that I have to kill it as soon as possible! ”RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Hehe, that Chaos Helminth of mine is too weak! ”

Upon hearing that, Wang Xian smiled faintly and looked at the twelve ancestral witches who had already killed the helminth! “The twelve seniors are really amazing. Pm impressed! ”

He spoke politely to the twelve ancestral witches!

They had worked together once before and could be considered good partners!

“Hehe, the twelve of us have to work together to achieve this step. We can’t be compared to you, Dragon King! ”

The ancestral witches in the middle shook their heads with a smile.

At this moment, they were indeed a little amazed in their hearts.

The strength that Wang Xian had displayed was already able to fight against them!

“The Dragon King and the rest have also killed the Beast of chaos. The Dragon King and the rest are so strong! ”

“After all, the Dragon King has a subordinate at the Heaven’s origin level. It’s normal for him to be fast! ”

“It’s not normal at all. How long has the Dragon King been cultivating to his current level? It’s already very heaven-defying for him to be able to match up to a veteran Heaven’s origin level powerhouse like the Elven empress in such a short period of time. ”

“That’s right. How long has the Dragon King been cultivating? How long has the elven empress and the 12 ancestral warlocks been cultivating?”? It was simply unbelievable that the Dragon King could achieve this step. This also meant that the Dragon Palace’s strength could be ranked at the top among all the peak races!”

When all the disciples of the nine-origin universe masters who were watching the battle saw that Wang Xian was the second one to kill the Beast of chaos, their faces were filled with shock.

All of them were discussing about Wang Xian’s deeds.

However, the three Phoenix Kings of the Phoenix clan had very serious expressions on their faces at this moment. They even looked a little ugly!

With their abilities, they had some understanding of the Heavenly Yuan blessed realm.

They also understood the division of beginner, control, Great Dao, and Chaos!

They knew that if they, the emperor of the Phoenix, were to attack this beast of chaos, it would be impossible to kill it!

And the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace could do it!
