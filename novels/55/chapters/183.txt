Chapter 184: The Conversation Between Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

In one of the rooms on the third floor of the villa, Guan Shuqing’s eyelashes twitched a little. She reached around her and frowned.

Her body was trembling when she recalled the craziness of last night. She started blushing as she lay on the bed, feeling weakness throughout her body.

That was too tiring. She felt that she would need two to three days of rest to recuperate.

Buzz. Buzz!

A mobile phone vibrated beside her just as she started imagining things.

She stumped for a while before reaching for the mobile phone. It was Wang Xian’s phone.

When she saw the message, she was taken aback.

The message was from Lan Qingyue. There wasn’t much in the message and just a sentence: [Thank you for your help at the auction the other day. If you have any jewelry in the future, could you sell it to our Deep-sea Jewelry?]

Guan Shuqing frowned slightly. She did not reply but instead quietly placed the mobile phone back.

A few moments later, Wang Xian walked into the room and saw that Guan Shuqing had woken up. He immediately said, “Shuqing, you are awake! Are you hungry? I have made some chicken soup for you. Hehe. Let me get it for you.”

“Sure.”

Guan Shuqing looked at her man and her eyes were filled with tenderness.

Soon, Wang Xian walked into the room again with a bowl of chicken soup in his hands. “Come have some! It helps in your recovery.”

“Thank you, Xiao Xian!” Guan Shuqing replied.

She drank a mouthful before leaning against Wang Xian’s legs.

“Let me feed you!”

Wang Xian expressions were full of tenderness too as he fed her slowly.

“Alright, I am full now. Let me rest a little more. It’s all your fault from yesterday,” Guan Shuqing said.

Guan Shuqing lay down as she rolled her eyes at Wang Xian.

“Together! Let’s lie down together!”

Wang Xian tried to snuggle into the bed ecstatically after hearing what Guan Shuqing said.

“You... Stay away!” Guan Shuqing exclaimed.

She was scared of him.

Errr.

Wang Xian was slightly disappointed with Guan Shuqing’s reactions. “Haven’t your injuries recovered yet?”

Guan Shuqing nearly cried out after hearing him. Her external injuries had recovered, but she had not recovered from exhaustion.

“No! Get out! You are not allowed on the bed. Get out!” Guan Shuqing remarked.

Wang Xian was speechless and walked out feeling disappointed.

This...How should I deal with this!

Guan Shuqing started pondering as she looked at the back view of the leaving Wang Xian.

I cannot satisfy Wang Xian, if this continues on, he will...

Guan Shuqing was lost. She lay on the bed and fell into a daze.

After pondering for some time, Guan Shuqing made up her mind. She picked up Wang Xian’s mobile phone.

On second thought, she decided to use her own phone and look for Lan Qingyue’s on WeChat instead.

[Are you there!] she typed.

Guan Shuqing bit her lips as she looked at her mobile phone.

[Yes? Is there anything?] Lan Qingyue replied.

In the Deep-Sea building in the city center of Rivertown, Lan Qingyue was busily handling the paperwork. She looked drained. She was surprised when she saw Guan Shuqing’s message and frowned.

[Do you like Xiao Xian?] Guan Shuqing asked after pondering for a while.

[Is there any purpose to your question at this juncture?] Lan Qingyue replied calmly while taking a deep breath.

[I believe Xiao Xian is in love with you too] Guan Shuqing continued.

[And then?]

Lan Qingyue smiled bitterly after looking at this message. She supported her forehead with her hand.

[If...What if I’m agreeable to letting you stay beside Xiao Xian... Are you willing?] Guan Shuqing replied immediately.

Lan Qingyue was stunned when she saw the message. She bit her lips and replied, [I’m already out of the picture. Besides that, aren’t you there for Xiao Xian already?]

[Are you willing if the three of us stay together? The truth is that I also don’t want to share him with you. However, I’m out of other options!]

Guan Shuqing sent out this message bitterly.

She didn’t want to share her husband with anyone else. However, when she thought of the craziness of Wang Xian from the previous night, she was aghast.

Furthermore, as one who was born in a well-to-do family, she knew clearly. Even her own father was having an affair outside.

There were few men who were rich but loyal.

Moreover, Wang Xian was too outstanding. Even if Wang Xian didn’t think about it, there would be lots of women trying to approach him.

She should be active instead of passive.

Although Lan Qingyue was once her competitor, she admired Lan Qingyue.

In the office, when Lan Qingyue saw Guan Shuqing’s message, she was shocked and stared at it blankly.

“All I want now is to stay beside him...” Lan Qingyue murmured. She looked down and continued, “However, everything is too late now!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

She wiped her tears and replied, [I... I am getting engaged soon.]

“What?” Guan Shuqing sprang up upon seeing the message.

She hurriedly continued, [You are getting engaged? Do you mean it?]

[Yes, it’s true. Xiao Xian and you will have my blessing. I’m really envious of you! Goodbye!]

Guan Shuqing was shocked by the last message from Lan Qingyue. She doubted, “How could Lan Qingyue be engaged? How can this be possible?”

Her expression changed and she hesitated. She then looked at the clothes that were ripped into pieces.

“Xiao Xian, Xiao Xian!” Guan Shuqing shouted weakly.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian, who was surfing the Underworld website, immediately rushed over.

“What’s the matter, Shuqing? What happened?” Wang Xian walked over and asked caringly.

“Do you know that Lan Qingyue is getting engaged?” Guan Shuqing asked Wang Xian.

“What?”

Wang Xian was shocked by what he heard and his expression changed drastically.

Guan Shuqing saw the changes in his expression and asked, “Xiao Xian, do you like Lan Qingyue too?”

Wang Xian smiled bitterly while looking at Guan Shuqing. He replied, “I do feel a little sorry towards her...”

“Fine, fine! You don’t have to explain it to me.” Guan Shuqing rolled her eyes before continuing, “I wanted to ask her if she would like to be with you too initially. However, I had not expected her to be getting engaged. This isn’t right. Based on my understanding of Lan Qingyue, she wouldn’t abandon herself to despair just because Xiao Xian hasn’t chosen her. Why would she suddenly be getting engaged? Furthermore, from my conversation with her a while ago, she must still be in love with you. However, she seemed to have something she couldn’t tell me.”

Guan Shuqing analyzed seriously. A woman understood another woman best. Furthermore, the sixth sense of woman was usually very strong.

Wang Xian was startled after hearing Guan Shuqing, and he opened her mouth briefly.

What? What does she mean?

“Ok, Xiao Xian, I am tired and I want to rest. If you can convince Lan Qingyue, I won’t object.”

Guan Shuqing lay on the bed, closing her eyes as she spoke.

Wang Xian’s expression changed again. He looked at Guan Shuqing, walked over and gave her a kiss. He took back his phone and left the room with questions.

After looking at Wang Xian closing the door lightly, Guan Shuqing opened her eyes.

“Pff, you are a teddy, a big teddy!” [1]

After walking out of the room, Wang Xian started to frown. He recalled the day when he met Lan Qingyue at the auction house and the conversation of those around.
