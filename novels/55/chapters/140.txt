“Wang Xian is different from other people!” Old Xue exclaimed as he looked at Wang Xian. He listened to what everyone was saying around him and felt lucky that he managed to befriend someone who valued friendship.

Old Xue knew that he was crippled by the Yan Family because of Wang Xian. Wang Xian would surely keep this in mind. From now on, the Xue Family would have a more comfortable life in Rivertown.

No one dared to mess around with them.

“Indeed. If it were the Yan Family or other families, they would get us to cough out enough interest even if they didn’t rule over us.”

The family head of the Ren Family looked at Old Xue and joked, “If Old Xue needs any help, you can look for me, Ren Tianhong. Since the Xue Family has such a connection with strong backing, we must have more bonding.”

“Haha, the Xue Family is lucky only.”

When Old Xue heard him, he chuckled and made some polite remarks. He knew that the Ren Family Head might sound like he was joking, but it was from the bottom of his heart too.

“Old Xue, you’re fortunate!”

“Yes, Old Xue. Let’s find a time for a martial arts sharing session.”

All the Martial Artists and the families spoke to Old Xue fervently.

Given the Xue Family and that Dragon King’s status now, it was worth associating with them.

Even though that young Dragon King did not rule the Martial Art circle in Rivertown, the Dragon Sect had shown their capabilities and that none of them could be matched.

Besides, they admired the Dragon King from their hearts.

At least Rivertown would stay peaceful with him around. A situation like what happened in the Yan Family would not happen again.

It’s all because of the Dragon King!

They had the most heartfelt respect for him.

“The Dragon King said he opened a medical hall at the old street. Shall we pay him a visit?”

“Yes, we should. We can go over with some gifts. But there can’t be too many of us. The Dragon King might find us irritating.”

“Why don’t we gather the gifts and get Old Xue or Old Duan or Ren Family Head to send them over?”

“This is feasible. We can prepare a huge gift as a token of appreciation under the name of all Martial Artists and families for the Dragon King. Today, the Dragon King did us a huge favor!”

“That’s right!”

All the Martial Artists of Rivertown agreed.

Sometimes, that was the case. If they were being oppressed, they would put up resistance and even retaliate.

But when help was rendered to them, they would be genuinely grateful and respectful.

Wang Xian may not have gotten them to submit to him, but they would obey any orders from Wang Xian immediately!

This was the impact of a powerful and generous man.

Wang Xian, walking on the road, did not know his unintentional act had impacted the Martial Artists and the families in Rivertown.

Wang Xian had never thought of asking them to submit to him. Not that he never thought of it, but rather, he was not interested in them.

The highest level they had was Level-nine Martial Artists. With only one or two such people, what could they do?

Too weak. They were so weak that Wang Xian had no intention to keep them for his use.

At the same time, it was not necessary to get them to surrender some of their interests like how the Yan Family had. Wang Xian disdained such intimidating practices.

As a Divine Dragon that would roam the nine skies in the future, he must have class.

He could earn money by himself, or even fish from the sea. But obtaining them through such methods? He would not stoop to it.

Wang Xian was only concerned about his future businesses of the medical hall. After tonight, he believed any Martial Artist who was injured would look for him in the future.

This could help to drive more business and make more money.

Wang Xian loved the feeling of making money by himself.

When he was back in school, it was already 9.30 pm. Wang Xian quickly headed to the Eastern Hill.

It still was not too late. He ran over with a smiling face as soon as he spotted a spark of fire lit on the Eastern Hill.

“Xiao Xian, you reached it. Have you settled all your things?”

Guan Shuqing asked smilingly, as though she was waiting for her husband to return.

“Yes, I’m here. Is the food ready?”

After he settled the Yan Family, Wang Xian was in a chirpy mood. He squatted down and rubbed his palms while looking at the food in the cooking pot.

“It’s almost done. Hehe. It still feels more comfortable to be able to cook our own food here. The atmosphere is better here compared to eating in the First-grade Restaurant.”

Guan Shuqing removed the lid as she smiled, blowing the steam away.

“Really? Then we shall have all our meals here!” Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Sure!” Guan Shuqing happily nodded her head and sat closer to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian gently placed his arm over her as he smiled.

Guan Shuqing was stunned for a moment with her cheeks flushed with redness. But darkness helped to conceal her blushing face.

“It’s done. Here, Xiao Xian. Let’s dig in!” Guan Shuqing took the lid away happily.

“Great, I will help you with the shells!” Wang Xian smiled and nodded his head.

Eastern Hill, outdoor picnic... It was cozy and relaxed.

No one would have thought that the dominating King from just now would be having an outdoor picnic, eating seafood with a girl.

The relationship between Guan Shuqing and Wang Xian had finally been confirmed, except for not having their nuptial chamber. Wang Xian was pondering when he could proceed to the next step.

Heh heh!

The next morning, Wang Xian went to the medical hall as soon as he woke up.

He opened the door and placed the signage with the rules at the entrance.

Wang Xian made himself tea and took out the gifts sent from Old Xue and Old Qin the other time.

Old Qin gave him a box of hundred-years-old ginseng. A very precious one.

On the other hand, Old Xue gave him a secret medical manual. Wang Xian was feeling bored, so he began to read the manual.

This manual was obviously written by a doctor who practiced Ancient Martial Arts. The book recorded many case studies and treatment methods.

Wang Xian did not know the treatment methods. He treated people using his mighty Dragon Energy and the vitality of the Wood attribute.

Of course, there were pros and cons to this.

Reading some of these medical books would benefit him when he treated others in the future.

The September sun continued to shine. Wang Xian lay on the deck chair in the room with a smiling face. He sipped his tea and read his books, enjoying a relaxing afternoon. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Whoo-hoo-hoo!

Just then, the ambulance siren echoed through the road on the old street.

Wang Xian paused and put down his teacup slowly before he went outside to have a look.

“Doctor! Where’s the doctor?!”

At the same time, two men barged in and raised their voices inside.

Wang Xian knit his eyebrow slightly. “There’s no doctor here. If you have a patient, you can carry him to one of the chairs in the room.”

“Fuc*! What kind of fuc*ing medical hall is this? The doctor recommended we go here. If they delayed my dad’s treatment, I’ll fuc*ing kill them all!”

The middle-aged was very nasty with his words. He shouted outside, “Doctor, are you sure this is the place for treatment?”

“Yes, this is the place. Hurry! Bring the patient in!” Doctor Sun was not surprised by the poor attitude of the patient’s family member.

With a large number of patients in the hospital, they’d met all kinds of weirdo family members before!
