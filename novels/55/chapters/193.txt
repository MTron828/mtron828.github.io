Chapter 194: Fish Tornado and the Ichthyosaur

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Wang Xian accompanied Lan Qingyue til nine-plus at night. He had initially intended to sleep with the lady but was ruthlessly pushed out with the doors locked.

Wang Xian smiled bitterly as he walked to the first floor. Walking to the deck, he looked to the faraway seas.

He could sense that Lan Qingyue had fallen asleep on the second floor.

She had barely slept over the last two days and was finally able to get a good rest today.

It will be at least be ten hours before Lan Qingyue wakes up!

Wang Xian thought to himself. He hesitated for a moment before removing his clothes and throwing them onto the sofa.

Bam!

Wang Xian leaped into the skies and dived into the seas. Moving his body, he transformed into a six-meter-long divine dragon in an instant.

“Prime Minister Turtle and Roving Girl are just around the corner. Let’s summon them over!”

Wang Xian looked around and let out a dragon roar to the surroundings.

Growl!

Growl!

Soon, replies were heard. Wang Xian could see Prime Minister Turtle, Roving Girl, Roving Lobster and Roving Heavens with his group of Devil Monkeys swimming towards him.

At the forefront, the Nine Venomous Sea Snakes were the fastest as they approached Wang Xian at an astonishing speed.

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Turtle, Roving Heavens, Roving Girl, Roving Lobster and the rest bowed respectfully in front of Wang Xian.

Mm!

Wang Xian looked at the eight hundred Devil Monkeys and could sense their improvements in strength. He couldn’t help but reveal a satisfied look.

Behind Prime Minister Turtle and Roving Lobster, there was a group of sea turtles and large lobsters following them.

These sea turtles and lobsters looked extremely lively. The sizes of these lobsters were all around a meter and their two huge claws looked extremely destructive.

These were all subordinates of the Prime Minister Turtle and Roving Lobster.

Let’s make use of the night to go deeper into further sea regions to look for resources required for leveling up! Wang Xian thought to himself.

Wang Xian looked at the yacht a short distance away. He hesitated for a moment before ordering the Prime Minister Turtle, “Drag the yacht along!”

“Yes, Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Turtle nodded his head and swam below the yacht.

Although the thirty-meters long yacht was heavy, Prime Minister Turtle was able to easily drag it along on the water surface.

Wang Xian was a little worried about Lan Qingyue. He went to the second floor quietly and used dragon energy to calm her body and make her enter deep sleep.

If there weren’t huge disturbances, she would only wake up after ten hours.

“Let’s head towards the deeper sea region!”

Wang Xian dived into the seas once again and gave his orders.

Wang Xian had searched the entire Bohai Sea. Up to this point, other than the huge Level 12 Devil Flowers that weren’t finished off, the other areas had been combed.

The Bohai Sea wasn’t big. With their speed, they only used three hours to reach the Yellow Sea.

Wang Xian noticed a sudden and drastic change in the underwater world ahead of him.

The depth of the Yellow Sea was approximately forty meters deep on average. The deeper region could reach a depth of over eighty meters.

The entire Yellow Sea was very broad and was several times the size of the Bohai Sea. At this moment, the region where Wang Xian was at was approximately fifty meters deep.

This was the first time he came to such a deep-sea region.

Under the waters, it was pitch black at night. Seagrass was common and the variety of fish was much higher than the Bohai Sea.

“This place is much more comfortable. I always feel that I could barely move in the Bohai Sea!”

Wang Xian swayed his body within the fifty meters deep sea as he swam around freely.

“Eh, there’s a school of sharks ahead!”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes and focused on the twenty-odd sharks a thousand meters away.

These sharks were all four to five meters long and gave off a violent aura as they swam domineeringly in the sea.

Wang Xian revealed a faint smile. He got moving and swam towards the school of sharks directly. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Big White Sharks: Level 5

Extractable Dragon Energy: 534

That’s over 10,000 points of dragon energy from twenty sharks! Haha. This is something the Bohai Sea couldn’t match up to!

Wang Xian was thrilled. Sea monsters in deep waters weren’t simply a myth!

The resources in the entire Yellow Sea were at least a dozen or even a few dozen times more than the Bohai Sea.

When my subordinates and I get stronger, I’ll head to the real seas for an adventure. I wonder if there will be terrifying creatures at a depth of 10,000 feet underwater? Are there other races living in the pitch-black darkness within the seas? Are ancient marine animals still surviving at the bottom of the seas?

Wang Xian was getting excited from these thoughts. The sea regions were largely unexplored by humans. In the near future, he would be exploring the entire seas and become the ruler of the seas!

Wang Xian was filled with ambition. He let out a soft roar and his subordinates swam over quickly.

“Let’s explore the Yellow Sea!” Wang Xian ordered. His gaze was fixed in front of him as he led his subordinates to conquer the unknown sea region!

The seabed of the Yellow Sea wasn’t too different from the Bohai Sea. Both had flat grounds and areas where it was a little more mountainous. However, the scenery of the Yellow Sea was grander and more beautiful than the Bohai Sea.

Devour, devour, devour!

There were many species of fish around him. There were little yellow croaker, hairtail fish, pacific mackerel, Spanish mackerel, yellow drum fish, slender shad fish, pacific herrings, pomfrets, codfish and many others.

Moving around, Wang Xian devoured all the fish he came across. In just two hours, he had gained more than 17,000 points of dragon energy.

Just 42,000 points of dragon energy more and I’ll level up. Let’s try to increase my level by the end of the night.

Wang Xian thought to himself and turned his attention ahead. The area in front of him was different from the darkness of the surrounding seas. It was full of marine animals that were glowing.

The glowing marine animals illuminated the bottom of the seas. Moving his body, Wang Xian headed towards it.

“This...”

When he approached the illuminated region, he was shocked by what he saw.

“Fish tornado! It’s a humongous fish tornado!”

There were at least a few hundred thousand to a few million fish gathered here and swimming in circles like a tornado under the water.

Wang Xian squinted his eyes and stared fervently at this fish tornado.

If I devour all the fish here, I’ll gain at least a few hundred thousand points of dragon energy!

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up and he immediately ordered, “Surround the entire school of fish!”

The entire fish tornado spanned over a thousand meters. Wang Xian wasn’t able to dominate the entire school with his dragon power.

Moreover, he noticed that there were several unique fish species in the middle of the fish tornado.

They had a terrifying size and every one of them was at least seven to eight meters. They also had flat heads with sharp mouths.

Their mouths were approximately two meters long with rows of sharp teeth exposed that gave off an eerie glow.

“What’s that fish?”

Wang Xian was filled with doubt. These four to five unique fish swam in the middle of the fish tornado like the Kings of the school.

Around them, densely-packed herrings, pacific mackerel and Spanish mackerel seemed to be honoring them as their Kings.

Wang Xian swayed his tail and started his hunt.

This would be his first battle towards conquering the Yellow Sea.
