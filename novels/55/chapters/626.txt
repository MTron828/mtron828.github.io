Chapter 627: Massacre Of The Underworld (3)

“NO! We can’t defend it. We have no resistance against it!”

Fear and despair!

“Argh, it’s the boiling water. How can it hit such a daunting temperature?”

The world seemed to have come to an end when the surrounding crowd heard the shrieks from the four elders.

Their end had arrived.

Sensing their bodies being boiled over by the seething water, they knew that the Dragon King was turning this place into a living hell.

They would be tortured to death. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“No, I don’t want to die. Dragon King, it’s my fault. But it’s all because of Donghua Sacred Sect and Devil Corpse Palace! They were the ones!”

Fear crawled upon the faces of several Martial Artists as they tried to struggle out but their efforts were in vain.

Argh!

Nie Wushuang let out a bellow as he exuded domineering golden radiance.

Yet, the golden radiance was unable to get him out of the water region.

The same went for Emperor Qi.

All of them, including the four elders, were in the same situation!

“Immortal Realm. You have advanced to the Immortal Realm! Ah, how is that possible!”

Sensing the pain coming from their bodies, the four elders shouted at Wang Xian in consternation.

Recalling what Wang Xian just said, they were certain about it.

Their expressions sank into despair.

“Enjoy the arrival of death!”

Looking nonchalant, Wang Xian swept his gaze across everyone before he turned and walked toward the dragonians.

“Dragon King!”

Upon seeing the arrival of Wang Xian, Mo Qinglong knelt down along with the rest of the dragonians.

“Mm, take it!”

Wang Xian gave a simple nod and tossed a Level 5 elixir pill to each of them. He looked around at the bodies on the ground.

“Dragon King, they should be able to be resurrected!” Mo Qinglong said respectfully when he saw Wang Xian scanning around.

Wang Xian remained quiet as he looked at him.

“Dragon King, this is the Soul Returning Branch that I got from the Dragon Palace!”

Mo Qinglong pointed to a greyish branch in the middle of the floating island as he spoke.

“Hur?”

As Wang Xian looked at the glowing branch, a hint of unexpected joy flashed in his eyes.

“When Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi returned a few days ago, I was afraid they might be up to no good. Hence, I went back to the Dragon Palace. Initially, I wanted some of the members from the Dragon Palace to follow me back. But I can’t command them, and they ignored me. Prime Minister Turtle said the Dragon Palace needed guards, and none of them could leave without your orders. But he gave me a Soul Returning Branch and said this would help us tide ourselves over in resisting crisis when in danger!”

Mo Qinglong accounted to Wang Xian respectfully.

“Mm, it was a thoughtful idea from Prime Minister Turtle!”

Wang Xian looked satisfied with it. Mo Qinglong had wanted some of the members from Dragon Palace to be present here, but Prime Minister Turtle and the rest would definitely ignore Mo Qinglong as no one else could command them except himself.

But luckily, Prime Minister Turtle was being thoughtful by getting Mo Qinglong to bring forth a Soul Returning Branch. Otherwise, their loss would have been rather huge.

“Roving Sword!”

Wang Xian shouted to Roving Sword.

“Yes!”

Roving Sword walked over immediately as he lowered his head in respect.

“Old Mo, inform Omniscient Group. Those who were involved in attacking my family, our sect, kill them all. No matter how many forces have participated in this, no one stays alive!” said Wang Xian coldly. “Roving Sword, you’ll follow them!”

“Yes, Dragon King!”

Frantic killing intent surged within the eyes of Mo Qinglong and the rest of the dragonians.

Even Roving Sword held his fist tight with golden radiance flickering in his eyes.

This time, there were only two of the Golden Swordfish clan left. As the leader of the clan, he had to slay all the enemies!

“You guys provoked me first. Don’t blame me for being cruel. This time, I’ll massacre the entire Underworld!”

Wang Xian slowly turned around and surveyed his surroundings.

At this time, it had become a living hell.

Despairing screams and agonized shrieks were ringing in his ears nonstop.

“Dragon King, you’ll die horribly!”

Nie Wushuang, Emperor Qi, and the rest of the experts from Sacred Sects and Sacred Clan growled ferociously with trepidation on their faces when they heard Wang Xian.

Dragon King is going to annihilate clans and sects!

This time, it’s a complete wipeout!

This struck desperate rage and immense fear into all of them.

What awaited their loved ones and friends would be the insane revenge of Dragon Sect!

“You guys did the same thing to my Dragon Sect. I’m just paying you back!”

Upon hearing their despairing screams, Wang Xian let out a clap of cold laughter. “Go to hell and make your confession!”

Argh!

“No, please let my family go!”

“NO, NO. Dragon King, I was wrong. I beg you, please!”

All of them panicked and shivered in their boots.

However, Wang Xian remained unwavering. If he had not arrived today, all the people in Dragon Sect would have been killed.

They would not have let off his loved ones and friends.

So why should he let them off?

“Do it now!” Wang Xian commanded Mo Qinglong and Roving Sword coldly.

“Yes!”

Dragonians and Roving Sword responded loudly.

Roving Sword swung his arm and supported their bodies with a longsword. Then they disappeared at a daunting speed.

“Send the information of those forces and enemies who participated in besieging us. We are going to pay them back!”

After hovering out of the scary sea region, Mo Qinglong contacted a dragonian in the Omniscient Group right away.

As of now, the biggest intel group, Omniscient Group, was under the control of Dragon Sect. Obtaining information was a piece of cake.

“Yes!”

“Currently, there are three first-class forces and two Second-class forces in Rivertown. They posted that they will be off to kill those families that befriended the Dragon King!”

“The forces who participated in besieging us are Donghua Sacred Sect, Devil Corpse Palace, Devil Spirits Temple, Dongmen Clan, Dark Sect...”

“On the Underworld forum, those forces who supported in annihilating Dragon Sect are Qingtian Sect from Gu City, Hua and Han Family of Modu...”

Soon, Mo Qinglong got hold of all the information.

While Omniscient Group was running at full force, Roving Sword began the massacre with 31 Dragonians at a domineering speed.

However, the live update on the Underworld forum had not been updated for more than ten minutes.

Today, 99 percent of the Martial Artists who were not present in Rivertown were staring at the live update on the forum.

All the Martial Artists of the Underworld were surprised to see that the live update had stopped updating for more than ten minutes!

“What’s going on? Update it now! Didn’t Dragon King arrive? What is happening? Was the Dragon King killed?”

“Quick, show us the dead body of the Dragon King. It has been more than ten minutes, why aren’t there any updates?”

“Tsk tsk, could it be that the Dragon King has been killed and now they are trying to clean up the scene? Why is the update so slow?”

“Update now. Otherwise, I’ll curse you for being killed by the Dragon King!”

After more than ten minutes of silence, all the Martial Artists in the Underworld were anxious about it.

What’s going on? Post the pictures of the Dragon King getting killed now!
