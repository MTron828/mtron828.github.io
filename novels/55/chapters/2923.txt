Chapter 2924: 2,924 Dragon Palace’s shocking decision 4

Sweep across the Machine Royal Territory!

Since the Dragon Palace was prepared to interfere with the matters of the glazed area and obtain some resources, it wouldn’t be as simple as assisting the glazed area.

Originally, Wang Xian’s plan was to slaughter his way into the Chimei territory and hunt down a large number of demons.

But now, he could shift his target to the machine royal territory.

“Dragon King, I think it’s possible. Let us, the Dragon of devouring, take action in this battle.”

Ao he’s eyes lit up as he spoke.

“Yes. Since we have decided, we will destroy the entire machine royal territory. Before that, we must be fully prepared.”

Wang Xian nodded slightly and said.

When ao he heard that, he revealed an excited expression.

Once they swept across the entire machine royal territory, all the resources in the entire machine royal territory would be devoured by the devouring dragon. What kind of concept would that be? 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Their strength would definitely rise to a terrifying level.

“Ao Xie, your devouring dragon has made a huge profit this time.”

The eight limbed fiend fiend and the others said enviously.

“Hehe, after we destroy the Machine Imperial region and our devouring dragon rises, we will sweep through the Chimei region. At that time, all the resources of the Chimei region will be given to you.”

Ao Xie said with a smile.

“Liuli is very familiar with the machine royal territory. We need to get more detailed information from them.”

As Wang Xian spoke, he stood up immediately.

“Prime Minister Gui, follow me to the governor. Ao he, you guys return to the Dragon Palace and order your subordinates to prepare.”

He continued to give orders.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The members of the Dragon Palace replied immediately.

Wang Xian brought Prime Minister Gui and flew towards war continent immediately.

At this moment, in a hall in war continent, the governor and the rest were also waiting for news from the Dragon Palace.

“Dragon King!”

Upon seeing Wang Xian and the rest walking in, the rest immediately stood up and greeted them.

“Governor, we have already made a decision. Please give us a copy of all the information in the machine royal territory.”

Wang Xian walked over and said directly.

“Oh? All the information in the machine royal territory? The Dragon Palace will help us guard this place? I will send you a copy of the information later!”

“By now, the machine royal territory should have received the news of your arrival. I reckon that they wouldn’t dare to attack us. The people from Your Dragon Palace will help us guard this place. There shouldn’t be any problems.”

The governor said with a smile.

“Since our Dragon Palace is here, we won’t be keeping watch here. Governor, give me all the information about the machine royal territory, including the star map of the machine royal territory. Our Dragon Palace is preparing to invade the Machine Royal Territory!”

“Your glazed domain doesn’t need to participate in this war.”

Wang Xian shook his head with a smile.

“Huh? What?”

The governor was slightly stunned. The celestial emperors from the glazed domain were also looking at him in astonishment.

“To tell you the truth, the mechs from the machine royal territory are useful to our dragon palace. Therefore, we have to exterminate them. If possible, we have to exterminate all the mechs from the machine royal territory.”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he spoke.

“This…”

The governor and the rest’s expressions changed as they revealed shocked expressions.

They had only invited the Dragon Palace to help them guard this place. In the end, the Dragon Palace wanted to exterminate the machine royal territory?

This was too ferocious!

“Dragon King, it’s not easy to destroy the machine royal territory. Their strength is much stronger than the imperial court of the Witch Association. They have a deep foundation and might be hiding very powerful offensive means.”

The governor’s expression changed as he spoke.

“Since our Dragon Palace is prepared to make a move, we will be prepared. Governor, all you need to do is to pass us their information.”

Wang Xian smiled.

Wang Xian was confident in dealing with the machine royal territory.

No matter how strong the machine royal territory was, it was only on par with the glazed area.

If it was stronger than the glazed area, they would have left for the glazed area a long time ago.

Since they did not leave, it meant that they were not confident in defeating glazed area.

They were not confident, but the dragon palace was.

Now, Wang Xian had a clear understanding of glazed area. There were more than 30 celestial thearchs in the entire glazed area, while the Dragon Palace currently had 52. (the celestial thearch who experimented with the eight-limbed demonic fiend was killed!)

Most importantly, the Dragon Palace had him and the Heaven Array.

With Wang Xian’s current strength, he was confident that he could fight against three to four of the same level alone.

The Heaven Array could also fight against three of the same level.

They could not be described as ordinary level three celestial thearchs.

In addition, the robots in the machine royal territory had a fatal flaw. They did not have their own divine kingdom. If they wanted to escape, they could only rely on their own speed.

This way, it would be much easier to hunt them down.

“Dragon King, you still have to be careful. I will immediately order someone to send you all the information regarding the machine royal territory, including some of the weaknesses of their robot army.”

The governor said solemnly.

He was also a little shocked by the Dragon King’s decision.

The Dragon Palace actually wanted to destroy the machine royal territory. This decision was simply too shocking.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded and looked at the governor. “Leave the machine royal territory to us. As for the Chimei territory, you can deal with it yourself. When the time comes, we will need all the corpses of Yaoxie.”

He reminded him.

“Don’t worry, Dragon King. We will collect all the corpses we have killed as compensation for the Dragon Palace!”

The governor nodded.

“Governor, this is all the information regarding the machine royal territory. We have been collecting and updating it for hundreds of millions of years.”

At this moment, a divine emperor took a communication stone plate. This was a special communication stone plate that had an extremely strong sealing ability.

The glazed domain used an AI, but the machine royal territory was the strongest in terms of technology. Therefore, they would place all the important information in a special place.

“Dragon King!”

The governor took it and handed it to Wang Xian.

“Alright. Soon, our Dragon Palace will organize an army to rush over from the teleportation formation. At that time, governor, you can also remove the soldiers here!”

Wang Xian received it with a smile and said to them.

“I really didn’t expect you to make such a decision. I can’t say anything either. I hope the Dragon Palace can win.”

“If you can win, our Veluriyam capital will be very grateful and celebrate together.”

The governor looked at Wang Xian and said softly.

“Hehe, alright. Let’s celebrate together then!”

Wang Xian smiled and gestured to them. Then, he flew out with Prime Minister Gui.

“This… governor, I really didn’t expect the Dragon King to be so crazy. They actually decided to attack the machine royal territory. This is the machine royal territory. Even if the strength of those robots is weaker than our Veluriyam capital, they are not much weaker!”

Seeing the Dragon King and the others leave, a god Emperor of the Veluriyam region couldn’t help but speak out.

“Since the Dragon Palace has made this decision, they will also roughly guess the machine imperial region’s strength.”

“It’s very likely that the Dragon Palace thinks that they are stronger than us and can even destroy our Veluriyam region. That’s why they decided to attack the Machine Imperial Region!”

The domain Lord’s eyes flickered as he exclaimed with a face full of astonishment.

“Stronger than our glazed domain? They think they can destroy us?”

The God emperors were moved.
