Chapter 1018: 1019, let’s stop

Translator: 5496903

“Ahhhhhh!”

Screams rang out once again in the cave. Everyone’s expressions changed drastically. Looking at the cold faces of the Golden Swordfish in the cave, they could not help but shiver.

It was too terrifying!

Be it combat techniques or divine abilities, they were not something an ordinary rank 7 transcendent could compare to.

They were as calm as machines, the golden swords in their hands carrying a special energy.

11 divine abilities, in an instant, caused all the rank 6 experts to die.

Even a rank 7 transcendent was heavily injured, falling to the ground in fear.

Seeing this scene, Snake Scar’s face was extremely pale.

He, who had always been high and mighty, felt the threat of death. He couldn’t help but retreat backward.

Wang Xian glanced at the people in the battle indifferently and looked at snake mark.

When their eyes met, Snake Mark’s expression changed instantly. His eyes revealed a terrified expression.

“Stop, stop quickly. I have already passed the news to the Yun family and our family. If you dare to kill us, the Yun family and the snake family will not let you off!”

Snake Scar’s face was a little pale. There was no trace of his usual arrogance. He pointed at Wang Xian and could not help but retreat backward.

Wang Xian smiled and did not say anything. He just watched the battle quietly.

Eleven level seven transcendents against six level seven transcendents. It was almost a two-on-one battle. It was a completely crushing battle.

“Help us and help us deal with them. After we leave safely, the Yun family and the snake family will definitely give you a huge sum of money to help us!”

When he saw Wang Xian looking at them with a smile, he shouted at the four level seven supernatural realm experts behind him with a flustered expression.

When the four level seven supernatural realm experts heard what he said, their expressions changed slightly.

The four of them looked at each other and looked at the arena.

There were six level seven supernatural realm experts in the arena. If the four of them attacked, it would be 11 against 10. Although they couldn’t threaten them, it was enough for them to protect themselves.

Moreover, if the four of them attacked, Wang Xian might not dare to attack again.

The four of them were hesitant and hesitant.

Once they attacked, they would definitely offend that young man.

“As long as you guys attack, each of you will get a transcendent level seven weapon and Armor!”

Snake mark gritted his teeth and shouted loudly when he saw their hesitation.

“7th rank weapon and Armor?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Their eyes were filled with fervor.

7th rank weapon and armor, these two treasures were worth 40 to 50 million mid-grade spirit stones.

With their strength, 80 to 90 million mid-grade spirit stones, close to 100 million, was a huge fortune.

“HM?”

Zhang Fengying and elder Zeng looked at the 4 transcendent 7th rank experts and frowned.

“Alright, Commander Snake, don’t forget your promise!”

The 4 experts gritted their teeth and spoke.

“Don’t worry, I, Snake Hen, am a man of my word. Everyone here can bear witness!”

Snake hen gritted his teeth, his expression ugly as he nodded.

Taking out 8 Type 7 transcendent weapons was not something the snake clan could afford to take out in one go.

However, their lives were more important at this moment, not to mention that the Yun family had to share the burden.

“Alright, let’s do it!”

The four transcendent-level rank-7 powerhouses nodded their heads heavily.

They looked at Wang Xian and said, “Everyone, let’s stop here. You Can’t do anything to them if we join in!”

The four of them took a few steps forward and held their weapons tightly as they warned Wang Xian.

“Hehe!”

When Wang Xian saw the four of them walking over with a face full of warning, a hint of mockery appeared on his face. “Let’s see then. If you don’t die today, it will be us who will die. I want to see if I can do anything to you!”

“You...”

The four of them, who were at transcendent level seven, had a slight change in expression.

They didn’t want to make a move either. They wanted to settle this peacefully and obtain their weapons and armor. This was what they wanted to see the most.

However, the other party had no intention of stopping at all.

“Hurry up and make a move!”

An expert from the Yun family saw that they were still hesitating. With a face full of difficulty, he blocked the attack in front of him and shouted loudly.

“Make a move!”

Four experts at level seven of the extraordinaire gritted their teeth and charged into the battlefield.

The addition of four experts at level seven of the extraordinaire instantly reduced the pressure on the experts from the Yun family. They heaved a sigh of relief.

Wang Xian watched with a smile on his face. It was indeed difficult to determine the victor in a short period of time between eleven experts and ten experts.

However, Wang Xian was not in a hurry.

Today, Snake Mark and the rest would definitely die.

“They are fighting. It will take a long time for the victor to be determined!”

“What should we do? There is such a huge commotion coming from here. The wind-winged savage fish and the rest will definitely be able to hear it. If they come, we will be finished!”

“Why is this Wang Xian doing this? It’s clearly difficult to determine the victor now. Why is he still fighting?”

“Damn it, damn it!”

The students behind them saw the battle that had erupted completely. They retreated once again towards the passageway.

Now that the four extraordinary seventh-stage powerhouses on their side had made their move, they didn’t dare to escape on their own.

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the crowd that was discussing behind him. A cold expression appeared on his face.

Zhang Fengying, Zhang Yitian, and the rest looked at each other. They were also looking at the passageway behind them warily!

“Let’s stop. We won’t be able to determine the victor for a period of time.”

At this moment, the addition of the four transcendents at level seven did not alleviate the pressure on snake mark. He said to Wang Xian with an embarrassed expression.

His tone started to soften!

“You’ve softened?”

Wang Xian stared at snake mark mockingly and asked with a face full of mockery.

Snake Mark’s expression changed drastically. He gritted his teeth and lowered his head. “Yes, I’ve softened!”

“But I won’t let you off!”

Wang Xian’s voice turned cold instantly. The lightning strike wood in his hand moved slightly. With a swing, he attacked a level 7 transcendent.

“Whoosh!”

A sudden sound startled the only transcendent level 7 powerhouse who was struggling to resist the two golden swordfish. His body shook and his body was covered in earthy yellow armor.

He wanted to resist Wang Xian’s attack head-on.

“PFFT!”

However, when the lightning strike wood landed on his body and penetrated his body, he was stunned.

He didn’t take Wang Xian’s attack seriously. In his opinion, such a young man was at most at level five extraordinary.

However, what he didn’t expect was that his casual attack was actually... Fatal.

He lowered his head and stared at the Thunderbolt Wood on his chest with a face full of fear. His body fell backward heavily.

His face was filled with disbelief.

He died with his eyes wide open!

“What?”

However, Wang Xian’s attack shocked everyone around him.

Everyone widened their eyes and looked at the scene in disbelief. An expert from the Yun family had been killed.

The balance had been broken!
