Chapter 533: Time to Whack Everyone

“Kill all of them!”

His emotionless voice was heard everywhere, hitting the surrounding Second-class forces, who displayed startled looks.

To their surprise, the forces that had been following behind Wang Xian halted when the Dragon Sect came to a stop.

They were listening attentively to the conversation ahead when they noticed a plain voice.

All of them were shocked.

The group of experts from Dongmen Clan, who was the closest group, could not help but twitch their lips.

“I wonder which fellow doesn’t want his life!”

“I think we should stay a distance away from it. It seems unsafe to stay too close to Dragon Sect!”

Some of the Inborn Experts from Dongmen Clan were discussing softly.

They were terrified, as this fierce man just kill anyone as he liked!

Today was the battling day between Sect Leader Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi of Diabolism. Both of them had made a pact that no conflict was allowed.

Donghua Sacred Sect had also issued orders that no Martial Artists were allowed to strike today.

Since Donghua Sacred Sect and the alliance of the orthodox sects had taken their stance, who dared to make their moves? This was simply a suicide move.

But clearly, Dragon Sect was not bound by this rule.

“Kill us all?”

The bunch of people from Crimson Bug was stunned by Wang Xian’s words. They stared hard at Wang Xian, revealing a creepy look.

“Kill us all? Hiak hiak, what the...”

Before they could finish their sentence, twenty devil figures flashed out from behind Wang Xian, launching their attack at a domineering speed.

“How dare you break the rules... Go to hell!”

The three old men who stood at the forefront of Crimson Bug let out a creepy shriek when they saw the black shadows’ attacks.

Boom boom!

At this time, the score of Dragonians released their daunting oppression with terrifying dragon claws, raking at the experts of Crimson Bug.

“Damn it!”

The group of a hundred-odd Crimson Bug people did not come with the ancestral sects. They were the first batch to reach this place. Hence, there were only three Inborn-level Crimson Bug experts.

“Burst!”

Crimson Bug was appalled by the domineering aura from the Dragonians. Their oversized clothes ballooned and flapped as thickly-dotted crimson bugs began crawling towards the Dragonians.

Boom boom!

The massive crimson bugs exploded out, charging at the Dragonians, filled with a scary corrosive toxin.

“Hmph!”

The Dragonians displayed only disdainful looks as they shook their bodies, releasing intense devil aura while blocking out the explosive blood. They racked their dragon claws across.

Hiss!

Argh!

Screams of panic and desperation were heard as the disciples of Crimson Bug got torn apart.

All the crimson bugs that were nurturing within the bodies let out a fearful cry.

“How dare an orthodox sect break the rules. Damn you!” an Inborn Expert from Crimson Bug screamed with a scary and malevolent face after witnessing hundreds of disciples almost getting wiped out.

A crimson insect flew into the sky and exploded in the air, a thousand meters high.

Boom! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The crimson glow lit up the sky, as that bug was a type of signal bug.

“I’m not from the alliance of the orthodox sects. Why do I care?!”

Upon hearing that Inborn Expert of Crimson Bug, Wang Xian sneered.

Argh!

Before the three Inborn Experts could say anything, they were slaughtered by three Dragonians.

Eek, eek!

The hideous crimson bugs were still found all over the ground, letting out cries of horror.

Beside them lay the corpses of their owners. Twenty seconds was all it took to exterminate the hundreds of disciples of Crimson Bug, who had been clamoring in arrogance not long ago.

They couldn’t resist or struggle.

Several Second-class forces beside Wang Xian were stupefied by what they saw.

“Dragon Sect, it’s the Dragon Sect. He’s the Dragon King!”

A girl, by the side, was crying out in surprise and excitement.

“Come here, Xun’er.”

A lady who was standing beside her quickly pulled her to one side as she looked at Wang Xian with consternation.

“Dragon Sect, Dragon King!”

Other disciples of Second-class forces also staggered back in trepidation.

Reputation was all that mattered!

Now that they had witnessed the Dragon King of Dragon Sect killing a bunch of people from Crimson Bug, all of them were shaking in their boots.

“Dragon King!”

An old man took a deep breath and lowered his chin with his fist cupped and a pale-looking face.

“Dragon King!”

The rest of the people quickly bowed with their hands cupped.

That girl, who had been looking at Wang Xian with curiosity, was pressed down by the lady beside her.

“Mm, let’s go!”

Wang Xian nodded his head plainly. With a swing, a flame began to burn away all the crimson bugs on the ground to the right.

“Who dares to attack the disciples of Crimson Bug?”

A tyrannical roar came before Wang Xian could even take two steps. He saw red figures flitting towards their direction from the right rear side.

Wang Xian whirled around and stopped moving as he looked over with a beaming face.

There were thousands of people with an old man who had an odd-looking bug that looked like a facehugger on his head.

The bug looked extremely scary and hideous and was slapping on the top of the head. The more frightening thing was his face, as it was covered in tiny and thickly-dotted little bugs twisting around. It looked extremely horrifying.

The old man wore an extremely oversized crimson robe with great terror hidden inside.

Standing behind the old man were Inborn Experts of Crimson Bug, who looked ugly and hideous.

When the group arrived, all the people from the Second-class forces gasped.

They started to shiver. If the war between the good and the bad break out, they really had no idea how to fight this bunch of scary people.

The incoming rush of pungent blood already made them sick, and all they could do was watch these people blankly.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows as he looked at this bunch of people. With a cold gaze swept at that old man, he said indifferently, “Not attack...wipe out. Look at the floor. Those are their ashes!”

“Hur?”

That old man was slightly taken aback as he traced the floor with eyes, which were slowly turning red.

There seemed to be scary bugs swimming in his eyeballs.

“Great, how dare you kill my disciples. Since you broke the rules first, I’ll give you a bloodbath!”

The old man opened his mouth wide enough for one to see worms wriggling inside it. He was a worm man!

“What’s going on? Why did the group stop again? ”

“It’s Crimson Bug. Just now, the Dragon King seemed to have annihilated them, and now, the experts of Crimson Bug have arrived.”

“The Crimson Bug of Diabolism is really courting their own doom. I’m happy to see this though. The people from Diabolism are really ignorant. How did they not recognize the Dragon King from Dragon Sect?”

“Hmm, this is getting exciting. The Crimson Bug of Diabolism is going to get exterminated!”

“I’m sure. How can the person who offended Dragon Sect stay alive? It’s just a mere Crimson Bug.”

The Sacred Clans and ancestral sects commented with thrill and anticipation. They had been following behind Dragon Sect at a hundred meters away, wiping the sweat away from their foreheads.
