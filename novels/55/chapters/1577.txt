Chapter 1578: 1,578 dragons have a reverse scale 1

Somewhat arrogant, somewhat insolent!

This was the evaluation of the King of Bingxin Empire towards Wang Xian.

In the room, the two patriarchs of Bingxin Empire were sitting there quietly, deep in thought.

“Big Brother, what do you think!”

The long-haired elder said to the white-haired elder.

“Although that priest Wang is powerful and has great potential, his character is destined to cause him to provoke many enemies. Now that he has even provoked ao Tian, this is not a good thing!”

“For our Bingxin dynasty, Young Master Ao Tian is the better choice!”

After a long silence, the white-haired elder said calmly.

“I also think that the supreme chief’s son is the best choice. It will be extremely beneficial for the future of our Bingxin Dynasty!”

“No matter what, priest Wang has cured big brother’s illness for decades. We can’t be too ungrateful!”

The long-haired elder nodded slowly at the side.

“Since young master aotian has spoken, it’s not easy for us to refuse. Especially if the supreme sect leader proposes marriage, with the supreme status of our sect, we can’t refuse either. Since that’s the case, we’ll Betroth Jian ‘er to young master aotian!”

“This is also a better choice for Jian ‘er. As for priest Wang, he can choose any beauty from the Bingxin Dynasty!”

A smile slowly appeared on Bingxin King’s face as he looked at the two ancestors and suggested.

“Alright, in that case, let’s go to the venue where I am the only one. If Jian ‘er can really obtain the first place tomorrow, it will be of even greater benefit to our Bingxin dynasty. Haha!”

The long-haired elder stood up and said with a smile.

The white-haired elder and Bingxin king nodded with smiles on their faces.

The matter had already been settled.

Bing Jing Huan, who was standing in front, revealed a cold smile on his face, filled with schadenfreude.

“Jian ‘er, let’s go. Master will bring you to the venue where I rule Supreme!”

The next morning, the bingxin king, the two ancestors, and Bing Jing Huan came to the front of Ling Jian ‘ER’s courtyard and called out to Ling Jian ‘ER.

“Master?”

Ling Jian ‘er walked out. When she saw her ancestors and the top experts of the Bingxin dynasty, she was stunned.

“Master, why are you here?”

She asked curiously.

“Haha, Why? Can’t you come and see my outstanding disciple?”

The long-haired old man smiled and shouted happily.

“Zoujian ‘er, we will take you there. We hope that you can get the first place today. By then, the Bingxin dynasty will be proud!”

“After today’s battle, father will give you a big surprise!”

King bingxin said with a smile.

“Thank You, Your Majesty!”

Ling Jian ‘er nodded with a smile.

“Let’s Go!”

King bingxin nodded and said directly.

“Wait, your majesty. Wang Xian hasn’t arrived yet. He should be here soon!”

Ling Jian ‘er looked outside and said.

“Jian ‘er, let’s rush over first. Pastor Wang knows the place!”

The long-haired elder frowned slightly and said with a smile.

“That... that’s fine!”

Ling Jian ‘er nodded slightly and followed the people of the Bingxin Empire towards the place where I am the only one who knows martial arts.

...

“Little brother Wang Xian, are you confident that Jian ‘er... Jian ‘er will acknowledge me as his father?”

At this moment, on the way to Ling Jian ‘ER’s courtyard, sect leader Ling looked at Wang Xian and said nervously.

“Sect leader Ling, don’t be nervous. Jian ‘er can’t recognize you now, but you can take your time to nurture her!”

Wang Xian smiled at sect leader Ling.

During this period of time, Ling Jian ‘ER had gradually accepted him. Naturally, he wanted her to get to know sect leader Ling.

Even if they couldn’t recover their father-daughter relationship, at least sect leader Ling would be happier and feel more at ease.

“Pastor Wang, I was wrong. I was wrong. As long as you save me, I’m willing to do anything you want me to do!”

At this moment, an old voice suddenly came from the side.

Sect leader Ling frowned slightly and looked to the left.

An old man with a stooped figure, who looked like a beggar who was about to die at any moment, begged Wang Xian.

“Don’t pretend to be so pitiful. Find a safe place to spend the rest of your life!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the old man. There was no trace of pity in his eyes.

He would naturally not rescue a person who wanted to threaten him!

The hunchbacked old man looked at Wang Xian’s determined look and his eyes were filled with gloom. He watched Wang Xian walk forward and followed closely behind him.

“Sage, Princess Jian ‘Er has followed the king and the old ancestor to the venue where I rule Supreme!”

When Wang Xian arrived in front of Ling Jian ‘ER’s courtyard, a maid said to him.

“Oh? She has already gone?”

Wang Xian frowned slightly and nodded. He looked at sect leader Ling and said, “Jian ‘ER has already gone. Let’s Go Too!”

“Alright, Alright!”

Sect leader Ling nodded and followed Wang Xian to the venue.

Behind them, the stooped old man followed behind with determination in his eyes.

He planned to waste his time with Wang Xian. Even if he had to give up on the dignity of a powerhouse, he had to get Wang Xian to treat him.

Otherwise, his life would be over.

“So many people!”

When sect leader Ling and Wang Xian arrived at the venue in the middle of the two mountain peaks, sect leader Ling looked around in astonishment.

More than 100,000 people gathered around. Judging from their strength, they were much stronger than the Liuhai region.

“There are naturally many people in the martial arts competition of the Solitaire sect. This is also because there are many people who are not qualified to enter. Otherwise, there would be millions and millions of people!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the surroundings.

The last day of the Solitaire sect martial arts competition was also the day of the finals. It was much livelier than the beginning.

Around the arena, there were many big shots and experts.

Especially the seat at the front of the competition, which was filled with many empty seats at the beginning.

The two experts at level seven of the Seethrough realm, who were hosting the first day, sat to the side and changed into two old men in cyan robes.

“Eh? Sect leader Ling, Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the area. When he saw that there was no sign of Ling Jian ‘er, he was slightly curious.

“Little brother Wang Xian, over there. Jian ‘ER is over there!”

At this moment, sect leader Ling pointed to the front seat and said with a face full of surprise.

Wang Xian looked over and saw that the Bingxin Empire and Ling Jian ‘ER were sitting at the seat of the lone sect.

The two patriarchs of the Bingxin Empire were conversing with the two green-robed elders.

“Sect leader Ling, let’s sit over there first!”

Wang Xian looked over. Without much thought, he came to the seat where the Bingxin Empire used to sit.

He had just sat down when Ling Jian ‘er noticed their arrival and waved at him.

Wang Xian smiled and waved back with a smile on his face.

“Hehe, Hehe, Jian ‘er has become much more cheerful!”

Sect leader Ling looked at her daughter with tears in her eyes as she said excitedly.

“Don’t worry sect leader Ling, I will bring Jian er back. I will make her acknowledge you as her father!”

Wang Xian looked at sect leader Ling and promised.
