3513 3512 was in an uproar!

“Run, run!”

“It’s the experts of the Dragon Palace. They are attacking again. Run!”

“I swear that I will never set foot in the Hundred Cities Alliance Again!”

In one of the cities of the Hundred Cities Alliance, the sounds of panic and escaping could be heard.

There were also those who were cursing.

They had collapsed!

At this moment, those disciples and Great Beings who were still alive were on the verge of collapse!

Not too long ago, they couldn’t even get out of the city!

They had thought that they would be safe within the city!

But now, two Level 2 universe masters of Dragon Palace were directly charging over, and they didn’t even have the strength to resist.

Within the city, the strongest city leader saw the two great beings of Dragon Palace and wanted to cower!

These were universe masters with level 2 battle power!

Their city couldn’t withstand it at all!

The Great Beings from the Dragon Palace were wreaking havoc!

The Great Beings from the Hundred City Alliance came to support and fought together.

Everything happened very suddenly!

Very quickly, 15 cities of the Hundred City Alliance were attacked, and the news of them being destroyed spread crazily on the universe AI.

This time, the sudden invasion of the Dragon Palace caught them off guard.

However, the city was too big, and a large number of disciples and great beings of the Hundred City Alliance had fled!

When they had run away and revealed this matter on the universe AI, the entire Hundred City Alliance was stunned!

“Our ten thousand city was attacked by two universe ruler level two great beings of the Dragon Palace. Our city was destroyed, and more than half of the people in the city were killed or injured. The Dragon Palace is too terrifying, and their power is too terrifying!”

“Our city was also attacked by two universe masters of the same level. Later, the Great Beings of our 100 City Alliance came and fought with the Great Beings of the Dragon Palace!”

“Your city was still in good shape. The attack on our great bright city was even more terrifying. Can you imagine it?”? “Within dozens of seconds, every city was destroyed, and our city leader was killed. Our City Leader was a universe master of level two, and he was killed in an instant. It was the Great Beings of the Dragon Palace!”

“Hiss, 15 cities were attacked at the same time, and 15 cities were instantly turned into ruins. The Dragon Palace sent out too many warriors, and their power is even more terrifying than we imagined!”

“Our Hundred City Alliance is going to be in trouble. Another 15 cities were destroyed, what will we do in the future?”

On the universe AI, those disciples who had escaped death were discussing.

Seeing their discussions and hearing their news, the disciples from the other cities of the Hundred City Alliance were all stunned!

15 cities had been attacked, and it was the type of attack that would destroy cities with great strength.

Even a universe ruler level 3 warrior had appeared!

This… was too terrifying!

The Dragon Palace was still the Dragon Palace!

The attacks of the Dragon Palace were getting more and more terrifying!

This time, the power displayed by the Dragon Palace was too powerful!

There were at least 28 universe masters level 2 warriors.

At least one universe master level 3 warrior.

It was so powerful that it made the city lords of the other cities of the Hundred City Alliance feel fear and despair!

How could they defend against such a powerful Dragon Palace?

If the experts of the Dragon Palace came to attack a city in the future, their city would be in ruins before the reinforcements of the Hundred Cities Alliance arrived!

Panic spread in all the cities!

“I’m going to F * ck his entire family. My life is important. I’m going to betray my city!”

“I’m going into seclusion. I’ve decided. I’m going to go back to my own divine kingdom and enter seclusion for a million years. I Won’t come out no matter who calls me out. I Won’t stay in the city!”

“I’m going into seclusion or I’m leaving. I Can’t stay in any city of the Hundred Cities Alliance in the future!”

This time, the experts and disciples of the other cities of the Hundred Cities Alliance were completely scared to death!

I Won’t do it!

I want to hide!

I want to quit the Hundred Cities Alliance!

Life is more important!

“Damn, how can the Dragon Palace be so powerful? This is unbelievable. There are almost thirty terrifying experts in the Dragon Palace?”

“Isn’t the Dragon Palace not so powerful? How can it be so terrifying?”

“You’ve always said that the Dragon Palace is not powerful, but the Dragon Palace is becoming more and more terrifying. Can’t you be more reliable?”

“Could it be that experts from the ancestral Dragon Clan are involved? According to the development of the Dragon Palace, they shouldn’t be so strong!”

“The Ancestral Dragon Clan is involved? Maybe it’s possible!”

The other forces and races discussed when they saw the news.

Every time the Dragon Palace showed its strength, they were shocked and shocked!

The dragon palace was like a bottomless pit. Every time it showed its strength, it would shock everyone!

It was getting stronger and stronger!

It was getting more and more terrifying!

The collapse of the 15 cities shook all the forces and races.

The strength the Dragon Palace showed this time was enough to compete with the Hundred Cities Alliance!

“Ugh? How is this possible?”

At this time, under a forest, Green Dragon Moon and Green Dragon Beard Shadow were shocked when they saw this information.

They had only just received the news that Dragon Palace had destroyed 15 cities of the Hundred City Alliance. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

However, they knew one thing — their ancestral dragon lineage was not involved.

This was entirely dependent on Dragon Palace’s own power.

“According to the information analysis on the AI, Dragon Palace has displayed 28 universe masters with level-two Combat Power, and one universe master with level-three Combat Power. This… this…”

“That universe master with level-three combat power should be Dragon King!”

Green Dragon Moon and Green Dragon Beard Shadow looked at each other in disbelief!

This power was too strong!

It was so strong that even for their ancestral dragon bloodline, it was not a small power!

“How did their Dragon Palace’s strength increase so quickly? Did they hide it in the past, or was it because of the Elves?”

The Azure Dragon Shadow muttered, his eyes shining.

They had sensed that the dragon king might have made a breakthrough after he was chased back by the plant demon beast.

Was It related to the elves?

“No matter what, it’s a great benefit to our ancestral dragon bloodline. After all, the Dragon Palace has a good relationship with us, and the Hundred Cities Alliance will be in even more trouble. Their disaster is about to begin!”

Green Dragon Moon said with a smile.

The rest of them nodded with a smile.

“Let’s go back!”

At the same time, Wang Xian also received information from the cities through an lie.

He immediately sent a message and the water touch king flew over with a city’s treasure and disappeared!

This was only the first time the Dragon Palace had retaliated.

There would be another such attack, and it would last until the Hundred Cities Alliance was destroyed!
