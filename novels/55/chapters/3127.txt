Chapter 3128: 3127 arrogant guest

Heavenly Dragon Clan?

Wang Xian was deep in thought when he heard the words of venerable Lou Shan.

He had gotten to know a little about the Heavenly Dragon Clan recently.

This was the clan of the divine dragon closest to their Dragon Palace.

It was a primary race in the universe. It was rumored that there were more than a hundred powerful venerable divine dragons.

“Are you guys on good terms with the Heavenly Dragon Clan?”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the Yalong Steed beneath the young man and revealed a puzzled expression.

How could a race that used the Yalong as a steed be on good terms with a divine dragon race?

“Hehe, this Yalong was a gift from the Heavenly Dragon Race to our ancient painting sect back then. It’s a heavenly halberd dragon horse with a strong bloodline. What do you think of this Yalong?”

Honorable Sir Lou Shan smiled and asked.

“Its bloodline is very strong. I didn’t expect the Celestial Dragon Clan to fall to such a state.”

Wang Xian said plainly.

“HMM?”

Honorable Sir Lou Shan raised his eyebrows slightly when he heard Wang Xian’s words. Then, he smiled and said, “I heard that the Dragon Palace has a divine dragon with a pure bloodline. I wonder if Dragon King can let us take a look?”

“The main reason why we are here is to have an exchange. We want to see if there are any items in the dragon palace that can help the Asian dragon improve rapidly. We can exchange them.”

As he said that, he looked at the divine dragon statues around him.

“Let’s forget about this. All the Divine Dragons in our Dragon Palace are our disciples. We don’t carry out any transactions and there are no treasures to upgrade the Asian Dragon.”

Wang Xian shook his head when he heard his words.

What a joke. Let them see a purebred divine dragon?

Did they treat their Dragon Palace as a zoo?

Were the disciples of their Dragon Palace for people to watch? Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian’s rejection caused venerable Lou Shan to be slightly stunned and shook his head slightly.

At the side, a few middle-aged elders frowned slightly and revealed displeased expressions.

This was especially so for the young man. He looked at Wang Xian coldly.

Such a powerful clan of the Heaven clan had given them congratulatory gifts in order to befriend their ancient art sect. Now, this Little Dragon Palace did not give them any face at all.

However, at this moment, the Heavenly Halberd Dragon horse under the young man trembled slightly when it heard Wang Xian’s words.

“Dragon King, save me. I don’t want to be a mount for the rest of my life.”

All of a sudden, a voice entered Wang Xian’s ears.

When he heard this voice, he was slightly stunned. His gaze swept across the Heavenly Halberd Dragon horse that the young man was sitting on.

“HMM?”

“Beast, since you are reduced to a mount, you should have the mentality of a mount.”

Venerable Lou Shan stared at the Heavenly Halberd Dragon horse. A wave of pressure covered the body of the Heavenly Halberd Dragon horse.

“Pa!”

The Heavenly Halberd dragon horse couldn’t withstand the terrifying pressure and knelt on the ground.

Wang Xian swept his gaze across and narrowed his eyes slightly. “Venerable Lou Shan, are you selling this heavenly halberd dragon horse?”

“Heavenly Halberd Dragon Horse?”

Venerable Lou Shan raised his eyebrows when he heard Wang Xian’s words.

“Dragon King, you didn’t even let us see the Divine Dragon of Your Dragon Palace. Now You Want To Buy My Heavenly Halberd Dragon Horse?”

“The bloodline power of the Heavenly Halberd Dragon horse that I’m sitting on might be higher than the bloodline power of all the inferior dragons in Your Dragon Palace.”

Before the Honorable Sir Lou Shan could continue, the young man beside him said coldly.

“Our Dragon Palace is not the Heavenly Dragon Clan. All the members of our Dragon Palace are disciples of the Dragon Palace. They are not for the eyes of others, and it’s even more impossible for us to trade.”

Wang Xian said faintly.

“Dragon King, to put it bluntly, Your Dragon Palace is still far from the Heavenly Dragon Clan.”

Venerable Lou Shan said with a smile on his face.

This smile carried a hint of mockery.

“I don’t know if the dragon clan can be compared to the Heavenly Dragon Clan. However, the Heavenly Dragon clan can tell that they are average when they gift their clansmen to others as mounts.”

Wang Xian said with a hint of mockery.

“Dragon King, the Heavenly Dragon Clan is a friend of our ancient painting sect. Their strength is also not something your dragon clan can compare to. Don’t criticize others as you wish.”

Venerable Lou Shan stopped smiling and reminded him.

“So what if you criticize them? They are already like this, yet they are still not allowed to criticize us? It’s really shameful for a dignified primary race of the universe to send their own people over to be slaves.”

Wang Xian shook his head mockingly. His eyes were filled with disdain.

A dignified primary race of the universe. Even the human tribe, which had the largest number of people, would not send their own people over to be slaves.

The heavenly dragon race even called themselves the Divine Dragon Race. It was simply a disgrace to the Divine Dragon Race.

“Hehe, Dragon King, that’s because you don’t know the current situation of the Divine Dragon Race in the universe. Don’t tell me you still think that the current Divine Dragon Race is a pure divine dragon that was once at the peak of the Universe?”

“This arrogance, you can’t have it. Your Dragon Palace is just an ordinary primary race in the universe.”

Lou Shan Knight chuckled.

As they conversed, the smell of gunpowder slowly rose.

“How many of the current divine dragon lineage are true dragons? Hehe, the divine dragon lineage is just an ordinary race in the universe now.”

“Now is not the time to be immersed in the glory of the past, but to see the reality clearly.”

The young man riding the Heavenly Halberd Dragon horse also said coldly.

“Our Dragon King is talking to the Honorable Sir Lou Shan. You are a divine emperor powerhouse, what right do you have to interrupt?”

Prime Minister Gui’s gaze swept over the young man and stared at him coldly.

“You… I Am…”

“Shut up!”

The young man wanted to continue speaking, but Prime Minister Gui’s aura shook, and a force belonging to a venerable directly charged at him.

“HMM?”

Venerable Lou Shan narrowed his eyes as his eyes narrowed slightly. A cold expression appeared on his face. “Dragon King, what do you mean by this? Are you trying to make an enemy out of our ancient art sect?”

As he spoke, an imposing manner surged from his body.

“Since you are here to visit our Dragon Palace, you should be a guest properly. Don’t be arrogant and don’t place the rules of the outside world on us. When we are talking, those who are not qualified should not interrupt. Don’t you understand this little rule?”

Wang Xian looked at venerable Lou Shan from the divine art sect and swept his gaze across all of them.

“You…”

When the young man heard Wang Xian’s words, his expression changed drastically.

“It seems that the Dragon King doesn’t welcome us. It seems that the Dragon Palace doesn’t place our ancient art sect in their eyes.”

The Venerable Dragon Mountain said faintly.

“Why should we place you in our eyes? Enemies are enemies and friends are friends.”

Wang Xian stood up and said plainly.

“Hahaha, Alright, Alright, Alright. Since we can’t become friends, forget it. Let’s go.”

Venerable Lou Shan stood up slowly and laughed out loud.

“HMPH!”

At the side, the young man and a few middle-aged elders snorted softly and followed closely behind.

“So you mean that you are going to become enemies with our Dragon Palace.”

Wang Xian looked at their figures and asked faintly.

“That depends on your dragon palace’s own choice. Don’t be too arrogant.”

The Venerable Dragon Mountain said mockingly without turning his head back.

“Our Dragon Palace’s Choice?”

Wang Xian smiled and glanced at Prime Minister Gui.

“Dragon King, then let’s make an enemy.”

Prime Minister Gui said faintly and waved his hand.

In an instant, the leaders of the Dragon Palace and more than 20 universe knights appeared in front of them.
