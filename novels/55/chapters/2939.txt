Chapter 2940: On the 2940 Devils and demons

“Beep Beep Beep Beep Beep Beep Beep Life Backup reboot, data backup commencing!”

“Backup successful!”

Just as the Dragon Palace was rapidly upgrading, a light suddenly lit up in the center of a meteorite in the boundless void next to the machine emperor territory.

A robot opened his eyes, data flashing one by one.

!!

Soon, his face revealed a look of hatred.

“Dragon King, Dragon Palace, I want you all to pay the price!”

A roar resounded from his mouth, his body shook and the meteorite started to crack.

“Ah Ah Ah, my body’s strength is only at Undying Level 3, it can’t even break through the meteorite!”

A voice filled with unwillingness resounded, extremely terrifying.

“I Want Revenge, I Want Revenge!”

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

A huge force collided with the meteorite. The meteorite slowly cracked open and a slightly worn-out robot walked out from it. He looked extremely pathetic. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Who would have thought that this was the creator of the machine royal territory.

A stray dog.

The machine royal territory was completely swept away by the Dragon Palace. It would not be long before the machine royal territory ceased to exist.

Time passed day by day again. Wang Xian and the rest were in the creator’s secret base, quietly waiting for the elevation of the devouring dragon.

However, at this moment, something unexpected happened in the glazed domain.

“Retreat! Retreat! All the life planets in the glazed domain retreat!”

“The domain Lord is defending against the four leaders of the diabolical God monarchs. Let’s retreat quickly!”

In just a few short months, the glazed domain had undergone tremendous changes.

Two months ago, the glazed domain slaughtered the invading diabolical gods. A large number of diabolical gods and diabolical God monarchs were killed.

However, just as Yao Xie was about to be chased out of the glazed domain, a huge devil lair appeared. There were more than 20 Yao Xie God emperors.

However, what they did not expect was that not long after, another three huge devil lairs had arrived in the glazed domain.

There were four leaders in the four devil lairs!

Each leader had the strength of a rank three void God Emperor.

These four leaders were known as Chi, Mei, Wang, and Jiang by everyone in the glass region!

Chi, Mei, and Jiang were the strongest existences they had seen in the Chi Mei region. They were also named after these four words.

The three great devil grottoes gathered over. The four leaders immediately led all of Yao Xie’s subordinates to attack the army of the glass region.

When nearly a hundred Yao Xie God emperors appeared, everyone in the glass region revealed shocked expressions.

The domain Lord didn’t hesitate and immediately led everyone to retreat.

Retreat, Retreat!

They immediately retreated half of the glazed domain.

Furthermore, the entire glazed domain instantly entered an emergency state, and all the life planets retreated far away.

However, during that escape, the domain lord was still heavily injured in order to defend against the four great leaders of the demons and monsters.

After retreating half of the VELURIYAM domain, before they could make any preparations, the four terrifying devil dens charged over once again.

This time, the VELURIYAM domain didn’t have any intention of defending.

Escape!

On the battle platform, countless experts and soldiers stared in shock at the position in front of them.

The four leaders surrounded and attacked the domain lord.

Around the domain lord, the seven colored glazed stone spun, holding the seven colored ruler, and terrifying water currents attacked the four leaders.

The seven-colored glazed stone was the true treasure of the entire glazed domain, and only one seven-colored glazed stone was born in the entire glazed domain.

The seven-colored ruler was made from the five-colored glazed stone, which had been built by the domain lords over the generations.

By relying on these two true treasures, the domain Lord was able to keep his life under the siege of the four demons.

Even so, facing four existences of the same level, he could only hold on for one to two hours.

He had to fight for an hour or two to get all the strong disciples of the glazed domain to retreat.

“There’s no time. Our domain Lord can not hold on for long. I will summon my divine kingdom now and abandon the battle platform. All the soldiers will enter my divine kingdom!”

The first Supreme Elder looked at the situation in front of him and shouted with an extremely ugly expression.

“First Supreme Elder, the troops of Yaoxie at the rear have already charged over. We still have tens of thousands of humans from the life planets!”

At this time, an anxious voice sounded.

At this time, even though they didn’t face Yao Xie’s attack head on, the suffocating pressure made their expressions extremely ugly.

“Send my orders, send 100,000 undying emperors to summon their God countries and bring the tens of thousands of humans from the life planets into their God countries!”

The Great Elder roared with a dark expression.

“Yes!”

The surrounding soldiers immediately responded loudly.

“Hu, the domain Lord said that he can only hold on for an hour, Yao Xie from behind will arrive in less than an hour, we have to retreat as far away as possible in 40 minutes!”

In the surrounding area, over 20 god Emperors stood at the side, their expressions extremely ugly.

No one had expected such a situation to occur.

“We have already retreated to the center of the glazed domain. If we continue to retreat, where can we retreat to?”

A God emperor roared in a low voice.

“If we keep retreating, we can only keep retreating. If Yaoxie keeps attacking, we have to be prepared to escape. At that time, we might need the divine kingdoms of all the god Kings and God emperors to be used by the citizens of the glazed domain to escape.”

A level two godly monarch expert from the glazed domain said gloomily.

“Everyone, for the final preparations, the teleportation arrays of the glazed domain and the sacred domain have been opened.”

Hong Fengyan, who was standing at the side, said to the experts from the glazed domain.

Hong Fengyan was one of the godly monarchs sent by the sacred domain to provide support this time.

However, the experts from the sacred domain did not expect such a situation.

If this unsolvable situation was maintained, the veluriyam domain would probably be completely finished.

However, once the VELURIYAM domain was finished, their holy region might be threatened by the chimei domain.

“Inform the citizens of the Veluriyam Domain to head to the planets near the boundary of the Holy Region. If the matter is urgent, teleport immediately!”

The first Supreme Elder immediately ordered.

“Yes!”

A divine emperor immediately nodded.

Soon, the VELURIYAM domain abandoned their battle platform. The Divine Kingdom of the first supreme elder carried countless soldiers and disciples as they retreated.

Three days later, Yao Xie occupied three-fifths of the veluriyam domain.

Half a month later, Yao Xie occupied four-fifths of the veluriyam domain.

A month later, almost all of the VELURIYAM domain was occupied. Countless people of the VELURIYAM domain gathered at the borders of the Holy Region.

Yaoxie stopped his attack and instead absorbed the results of the battle in the Veluriyam Domain.

The citizens of the Veluriyam Domain, who had lived for countless years in the starry skies, were all occupied.

At the border, there were at least hundreds of millions of life planets squeezed together. They were very close to each other.

The surrounding void was filled with divine kingdoms.

The Divine Kingdoms of the god Lord, the Divine Kingdoms of the god Kings, and even the divine kingdoms of the void God Emperor.

Within the divine kingdom, there were also all the citizens of the glazed domain.

Not just trillions of people!
