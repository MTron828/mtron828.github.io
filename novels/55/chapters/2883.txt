Chapter 2884: dragon descent celestial wizard territory

“Soon, the starry sky will be shaken by this!”

Hong Fengyan looked at the expedition team of the Dragon Palace and muttered.

“That’s right, the divine dragon, the inheritance of the Divine Dragon. This time, the imperial court’s Wizard Association and the barren lands are going to be in trouble!”

The celestial emperor of Shangshui said with a sigh.

Hong Fengyan wanted to go on this expedition, but Wang Xian didn’t agree.

With the current strength of the Dragon Palace, there was no need to involve people from outside the Dragon Palace.

Wang Xian had 100% information on the expedition to the Heaven Wizard region.

“The Dragon King and the rest are simply too powerful. Master, do you think that glazed tile, the number one force in the starry sky, is a match for the Dragon Palace?”

Ye Lui Ying asked her master with a face full of curiosity.

“Even if the Dragon Palace is not their match now, it will easily surpass Veluriyam in the future.”

The god Emperor of Shangshui answered from the side.

They had stayed on the Dragon Island for half a month. During this time, they had a deeper understanding of the dragon palace.

From the AI, they could also know the time when the dragon palace had risen.

It had been less than ten years.

It was extremely terrifying.

With his understanding of Liu Li, it would take him less than ten years to surpass her.

“What’s that? Where did the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace take the two giant beasts?”

“Did something happen? Where did the Dragon King and the others go?”

On the Dragon Island, the Dragon Island was bustling again. Nine Divine Dragons were pulling the dragon palanquin, and the small blue house was carrying 100,000 powerhouses of the Dragon Palace.

When they flew into the distance, they immediately caught the attention of many people on the Dragon Island.

They looked at the huge little blue house with surprise on their faces.

The ordinary people of the imperial star area didn’t know what had happened in the vast wilderness or in the holy region.

“What?”

Some spies of the imperial court and the Wizard Association saw it on the Dragon Island. They frowned and immediately passed the news over.

“Wu Wu Wu!”

“Roar Roar Roar!”

At that moment, the Kun’s roar and the wind god Dragon’s roar sounded.

In the next moment, their figures quickly disappeared.

With Little Blue’s small house and the wind god Dragon’s speed, they would not be able to see their figures clearly if they did not have the strength of a divine king fifth rank or above.

Even if they were extremely huge, they would not be able to see them at all if they flew at high speeds.

It was too fast!

“Dragon King, it will take two days to reach the Heaven Wizard region. It will take half a month to reach the Heaven Wizard Association’s Witchcraft Mountain.”

In front of the Dragon Sedan, Prime Minister Gui reported to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly.

“When we reach the Heaven Wizard region, the Witchcraft Association will definitely receive the news in advance.”

“However, the actual strength of our Dragon Palace is still unknown to the Witchcraft Association and the imperial court. They will definitely not escape directly. After all, as a wizard and a powerful array formation master, their strongest point is their defensive battle!”

Prime Minister Gui continued.

“How’s the preparation of the Heaven Formation?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian asked.

“Dragon King, the Heaven Formation has been waiting for this day for a long time. Without us saying anything, he would have been fully confident. However, the Heaven Formation can’t trap the Overlord and the Wizards.”

Prime Minister Gui said.

“However, the Ba Qi also said that the Wizards are very strong. Once you get close to the Dragon Palace at a terrifying speed, the wizards will be easier to kill than the Overlord!”

Prime Minister Gui continued to add.

“It’s best if we can kill both of them.”

Wang Xian mumbled.

“It’s fine if we kill one of them and injure him severely. At that time, with the ability of the Heaven Formation, he won’t be able to escape even if he passes through the formation!”

Prime Minister Gui said with a smile.

“That’s true. It’s just a little more troublesome.”

Wang Xian smiled and stared at the void in front of him. His eyes were sparkling.

This battle was the battle that shook the entire resplendent starry sky of the Dragon Palace.

It was also the battle where the Divine Dragon roared in the starry sky.

After this battle, Long Xiao was nowhere to be found!

“Old Man Sky Array, it’s time to go home!”

On Xiao Lan’s body, Ba Qi looked at sky array and said with a smile.

“Yes, it’s time to go home!”

Sky Array didn’t Mind Ba Qi’s teasing voice. He looked ahead with a sigh.

He was going home!

The Imperial Star Field was his home!

After tens of millions of years of fall, he was now back. This time, he would be able to kill his enemies with his bare hands.

He had been waiting for this day for a very, very long time.

“I’m finally going home, Hahaha!”

Suddenly, he laughed heartily.

Ba Qi and the others also laughed.

Only invincible in battle secretly looked at sky array.

The Nine Wind Divine Dragons moved quickly, followed closely by Little Blue’s small house.

They shuttled quickly through the starry sky.

Their terrifying speed caused the planets in the imperial star field to not sense that they were passing by.

Two days passed very quickly, and there were already very few life planets around.

In front of them was the Celestial Wizard Realm.

The Celestial Wizard realm was once a relatively famous large region in this resplendent starry sky.

The Magi in the Heaven Magus region were the most feared existences in the entire resplendent starry sky.

In the past, the Heaven Magus region had two rank two divine emperors. However, the two of them were able to fight against at least four to five existences of the same level.

Hence, the Heaven Magus region was abnormally powerful in the entire resplendent starry sky.

Its overall strength was ranked third.

The Heaven Magus region was larger than the Emperor Star region. The entire star region had a dark hue to it.

Compared to the saint region, this place was much darker.

90% of the people in the Heaven Magus region were array masters and all of them wanted to become a magus.

However, the array masters in the Heaven Magus region had more branches.

Some of them would transfer the bodies of demon beasts or desolate beasts to their bodies in order to increase their strength.

In order to increase their strength, they would kill countless humans to carry out experiments and refine powerful weapons.

This was a world where the strong preyed on the weak.

And the Witch Formation Association was the ruler of this world.

The flying vehicles of the Heaven Magus region were made from the bodies of desolate beasts and Fey Beasts. There were also some flying vehicles that were set up with arrays.

It seemed to lack the feeling of science fiction and was filled with magic.

The Heaven Magus region’s Witch Formation Association was the ruler, but they did not directly govern all the planets.

There were also various forces of all sizes in the Heaven Magus region.

“Wu Wu Wu!”

“Roar Roar Roar!”

In the starry sky of the Heaven Magus region, muffled roars filled with palpitating power rang out as waves of powerful might filled the surroundings.

A few roars announced the arrival of the Dragon Palace.

It announced the arrival of the dragon to the Heaven Magus region!

“What a terrifying roar!”

“What giant beast is that? Hiss, it’s so fast!”

“Those nine creatures… No, what are the eleven terrifying creatures?”

“Space Beasts?”

The roars attracted the attention of some of the nearby life planets.

The figures flew into the starry sky. When they saw the giant creatures flying past, their pupils constricted and their faces filled with fear.

However, before they could see clearly, the dozen or so terrifying figures had already disappeared!
