Chapter 3170: 3,169 heavenly dragons

“I’ve broken through!”

Wang Xian’s dragon body was coiled in the Dragon King Palace. He was smiling.

The breakthrough in his strength allowed him to be comparable to a level 3 universe knight.

Furthermore, in terms of combat strength, he could easily kill a level 3 universe knight with his terrifying speed.

At the side, the Five Elements Millstone was absorbing the acquired spiritual treasures. With the powerful heaven burial spiritual treasure, the five elements millstone was 100% improved.

After the improvement, the five elements millstone still had the ability to kill a universe knight Level 3 great being.

The improvement of his strength made him very happy. He moved and arrived at the dragon transformation pool.

At this moment, in the dragon transformation pool, the disciples of the Dragon Palace were quickly absorbing the dragon blood inside.

On the nine dragon pillars around the dragon transformation pool, the dragon blood was still flowing from the dragon head.

This time, the dragon palace had reaped a huge harvest. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

All the members of the skeleton clan and all the skeletons had turned into dragon blood.

There were billions and billions of skeletons. Even though some of the skeletons were weak, they were still extremely terrifying under the huge amount of accumulation.

This time, Wang Xian couldn’t even guess how much the Dragon Palace could improve.

But presumably, this was an extremely terrifying number.

Sweeping his gaze across, he flew out of the Dragon Palace and arrived at the skeleton island in front.

At this moment, ao crab was leading the devouring dragon to devour the Divine Kingdom of the skeleton clan.

A large number of divine kingdoms could similarly allow them to obtain a huge improvement.

All the members of the Dragon Palace were undergoing rapid improvement.

While the Dragon Palace was steadily improving, everyone in the Milky Way knew about the outcome of this battle.

And more than ten universe primary races, led by the mist race, announced on the AI that they were prohibited from killing the Yalong.

This caused the result of this battle.

“The Dragon Palace fought against the three races for ten days and ten nights. Ten days later, two universe knights from the ancient art sect helped the three races and attacked the Dragon Palace. When the scales of victory tilted towards the three races, Willow deity Knight helped the Dragon Palace. Willow deity Knight unleashed his terrifying universe Knight Level 3 strength and helped the Dragon Palace destroy the three races.”

“The venerable willow deity is too powerful. He actually helped the Dragon Palace. This means that the venerable willow deity will stand on the same side as the Dragon Palace in the future.”

“The terrifying strength that the Dragon Palace unleashed this time is enough to shake the entire Milky Way. No force is a match for them.”

When everyone else in the Milky Way received this news, their faces revealed an extremely shocked expression.

The Dragon Palace had destroyed three races.

This battle had destroyed the skeleton race, and the nine blade race had collapsed.

When the disciples of the nine blade race who were rushing towards the Milky Way heard this news, they collapsed.

All the universe knights and warriors of their race had died.

Their nine blade race’s current strength wasn’t even comparable to a domain level race.

This caused the nine-blade race to disintegrate.

The two universe races disappeared completely.

As for the bloodthirsty race, even though the people of the Milky Way didn’t know much about them, they must have suffered heavy losses.

On the third day after the Dragon Palace destroyed the three races and the two universe knights from the ancient painting sect, they were in the vast starry sky, and their bodies were emitting vast power as they crossed the void space.

The two old men in the lead stood on a simple ancient painting. There were mountains, rivers, and rivers on it, and it looked magnificent.

A group of 50 people, their speed was very terrifying.

However, when the old man in the lead received a message from the AI, he frowned slightly, and his expression changed slightly.

He waved his hand, and the surrounding people immediately stopped.

“Sect, what happened?”

An old man beside him asked.

The others looked over.

These 50 people were the strong warriors of the ancient art sect and 50 universe knights.

Their goal this time was the Dragon Palace.

The deputy sect leader of the ancient art sect was killed and a descendant of the sect leader was killed. The ancient art sect had to take revenge for this.

“Nine swords, the skeletons, and the bloodthirsty race were all killed. The left and right guardians were also killed. Willow God Knight from the Milky Way helped the Dragon Palace. That Willow God Knight has the power of a level 3 universe Knight.”

“Now, the Dragon Palace has two level 3 universe knights.”

The sect leader of the ancient art sect frowned and said with an unpleasant expression.

“What? Isn’t Willow God Knight of the Milky Way a pinnacle level two universe knight? She has broken through and is standing with the Dragon Palace?”

A Knight of the ancient art school’s expression changed slightly when he heard that.

“Two universe knights with level three Combat Power, and they are powerful pure-blooded godly dragons. This is troublesome.”

The old man on the right had a serious expression on his face.

This time, they were prepared to fly over and destroy the Dragon Palace. However, they received this news.

Two universe knights at Level 3, and the rest were close to 40.

This terrifying power was not something they could destroy.

The atmosphere was tense, and the 50 People’s expressions were ugly.

“Leader, what do we do now? Are we not going to take revenge?”

A Universe Knight couldn’t help but say with an awkward expression.

“It’s going to be difficult for us to destroy the Dragon Palace with our power alone.”

The leader of the ancient art school shook his head and looked at the information on the AI. His eyes gleamed. “The Dragon Palace has many pure-blooded godly dragons.”

“Are they really pure-blooded godly dragons? According to the information we got, the Dragon Palace is developing very fast. Did they really get the inheritance of a powerful godly dragon?”

A Universe Knight asked in surprise.

“It should be a pure-blooded dragon God. I’ll contact the Sky Dragon clan and see if they are willing to help.”

The leader of the ancient painting sect hesitated for a moment and said.

“Sky Dragon Clan? Are they willing to help? That Dragon Palace is also a dragon God clan.”

Another knight said.

“There are eight or nine powerful Dragon God clans in the universe. They all want to transform into true dragons and restore the glory of the Dragon God. However, the relationship between the races of the Dragon God clans is not good.”

“Those who can obtain the inheritance of the divine dragons and those who can perform the atavism all think that they are the true dragon’s son of heaven. How can they be willing to submit to them?”

“If that’s the case for the Heavenly Dragon Race, it should be the same for the Dragon Palace. With our relationship with the heavenly dragon race, they might be interested.”

The sect master of the ancient painting sect said lightly.

“I really envy these races with powerful bloodlines. Back then, the Heavenly Dragon Clan even tried to curry favor with us. Now, after hundreds of millions of years, the other party’s strength has far surpassed ours.”

“However, the Heavenly Dragon Clan doesn’t seem to have any purebred divine dragons. Their strength is considered the weakest among the divine dragons. Now that we have the Dragon Palace, the Dragon Palace has purebred divine dragons. Perhaps…”

The old man beside the sect master of the ancient painting sect muttered.

His eyes shone brightly!
