Translator: 549690339

In a year’s time, he would be able to reach Tianyuan City!

In Tianyuan City, which was located in the sword and magic universe, Wang Xian, who had the body of the Void Dragon, opened his eyes and revealed a smile!

His main body had improved!

The improvement of this body of the Void Dragon could be accelerated a little!

Currently, he was at level seven, the ruler of the universe.

In the past few hundred million years, he had only improved by two levels. In Wang Xian’s opinion, it was extremely slow!

“Let’s take a stroll around Tianyuan City! ”

Wang Xian stood up. He had been in seclusion here for 400 million years. To him, it was indeed very boring!

He took out his communication stone plate and sent a message to long yin and long yinhao.

It had been 400 million years since he last met them!

Long Yinyin and long Yinhao had looked for him countless times during this period of time, but they rejected him more directly than he did!

After sending the message, Long yinyin received a message very quickly.

Wang Xian’s figure moved and flew out.

“Brother Wang Xian! ”

More than ten hours later, Long Yinyin flew over and shouted at Wang Xian excitedly!

Wang Xian looked at the figure in front of him and smiled.

Long yinyin had changed a lot after not seeing him for 400 million years!

Her face was still as exquisite and beautiful as ever. As he cultivated the water attribute, not only did time not leave any traces on her face, but it also made her figure even more perfect.

It was not an exaggeration to call her a water fairy.

Unlike Shui Linglong’s cuteness, long yinyin had the demeanor of a powerful elder sister!

After 400 million years, his strength had also improved tremendously.

He had already reached the sixth level of the Universe Dominator!

This improvement speed was even faster than Wang Xian’s!

The main reason was that during these 400 million years, the place where Wang Xian went into seclusion to cultivate was not a treasured place.

Compared to the place where he fought frequently and obtained some resources to improve himself, there was a huge gap.

If he continued to cultivate, he had the hope of reaching the peak of the Universe Overlord realm before the arrival of the calamity!

“Long time no see! ”

Wang Xian looked at her and said with a smile!

“Brother Wang Xian, it’s been a long time. It’s been more than 400 million

Long Yin flew to his side and said with some hidden bitterness!

(‘I didn’t look for you guys because of some special reasons! ”

Wang Xian smiled and said, “I’m really sorry, but there’s nothing else. I have a lot of time now! ”

“Where do you want to go and what do you want to eat? Let’s Go Together! ” He continued to say with a smile!

“Yes, yes. Let’s go and eat something delicious. I know a place in Tianyuan city where the food is very delicious! ”

Long yinyin nodded her head happily. Her face turned red as she grabbed Wang Xian’s arm and said!

“Alright, let’s go and have a taste! ”

Wang Xian nodded his head with a smile. He stretched out his hand and held her hand as they flew forward.

This caused long Yinyin’s body to tremble slightly. Her face was filled with happiness.

After not seeing each other for more than 400 million years, long yinyin had opened up a lot of things.

She had also mustered up a lot of courage!

The two of them flew and arrived at a restaurant!

The two of them chatted as they ate.

After not seeing each other for 400 million years, their relationship was much better than before!

The two of them also had a tacit understanding!

“What I did has nothing to do with me. Shu Qing and the rest won’t blame me,

At the main body, Wang Xian laughed mischievously!

The true colors of a man!

A man would still be a teenager even if he died!

“Oh right, where’s long Yinhao? Why didn’t he come with you?”

After the two of them finished their meal, they came to a beautiful scenic spot. Wang Xian suddenly asked long yinyin!

“Yinhao is currently with Saintess Liuyue. Brother Wang Xian, you would never have thought that my younger brother is dating Saintess Liuyue! ”nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Long Yinyin spoke to him!

Her words stunned Wang Xian!

Long Yinhao actually got together with Saintess Liuyue!

Saintess liuyue from the flowing water forbidden ground?

“Why did they get together all of a sudden? Not Bad, this kid!”

Wang Xian was astonished!

Although Long Yinhao had obtained the inheritance of a water-elemental powerhouse’s corpse in the demon pillar, Saintess Liuyue had also obtained it!

In addition to the Flowing Moon Holy Maiden’s background, as well as her strength being stronger than long Yinhao’s, he was indeed somewhat surprised!

“Hehe, Little Xian, I didn’t tell you about their matter in the communication stone plate. More than four hundred million years ago, after you left, did you still know about it? “Our group of powerful disciples from the Forbidden Sacred Land and Sacred Academy suffered a large number of demonic beasts ‘attacks. At that time, many powerful experts died

“At that time, we were also attacked by Demon Beasts. At that time, Yin Hao helped Holy Maiden Liu Yue defend against a fatal attack. ”

“Yin Hao almost died at that time. Later, he was saved. In the end, his relationship with Holy Maiden Liu Yue became better, and that kid started to train hard! ”

“Now, his realm is one level higher than mine. He has already reached the seventh level of a universe ruler. After he broke through, his relationship with Holy Maiden Liu Yue was exposed. I only found out about it later! ”

Long yinyin said with a smile!

“Oh? He actually broke through to the seventh level of the universe dominator? The speed of his cultivation is so fast! ”

Wang Xian revealed a look of surprise!

“I’m also very surprised. Maybe it’s because this kid knows that he is under a lot of pressure and is working hard in his cultivation. Coupled with the full efforts of our ancestors, his improvement is indeed very fast!”

Long yinyin nodded her head.

“With Yinhao’s talent and current strength, he’s worthy of Saintess Liuyue! ”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

This long Yinhao could be considered his brother-in-law in the future!

Hehe!

“HMM, let him bring Saintess Liuyue over when he’s free. Let’s have a good gathering! ”

Long Yinyin said!

Wang Xian nodded his head.

In the next few months, Wang Xian and long yinyin strolled around Tianyuan City.

After more than 400 million years of development, the entire Tianyuan City had undergone many changes!

It would take several years if they wanted to tour the entire Tianyuan City!

A few months was just a snap of the fingers for Wang Xian and long yinyin!

On this day.

Wang Xian and long yinyin were playing in a lake.

Long yinyin’s communication device, which was sitting at the side, trembled.

When she saw the contents, her expression changed slightly. She stood up immediately!

Her face turned slightly pale!

“What’s Wrong?”

Wang Xian saw long yinyin’s expression change drastically. He frowned slightly and asked her with concern immediately!

“Brother Wang Xian, Yinhao… Yinhao has fallen. He was killed. ”

Long yinyin’s voice trembled as she spoke. Her eyes turned red instantly!

“What? Yinhao has fallen?”

When Wang Xian heard that, his expression changed slightly as well. His gaze focused as he stood up immediately. “He should have a resurrection treasure.. Is He resurrected now?”
