Chapter 622: Return Of The Dragon King (3)

At this very moment, the news of Nie Wushuang, Emperor Qi and other forces going to exterminate the Dragon Sect was spreading and updating constantly on the Underworld website.

When the martial artists of the Underworld saw the terrifying strength of Adjaya and Lan Qingyue, they were astonished.

For two girls to have the strength of supreme experts, the visual and psychological impact on them was immense.

[The Dragon King definitely obtained some peerless legacy. Otherwise, the Dragon Sect wouldn’t have risen so rapidly. His girls wouldn’t possess such terrifying strength either!]

[This is really insane! If the Dragon King wasn’t dead, the Underworld would be theirs in the future!]

[I believe the annihilation of the Dragon Sect will likely allow many other Sacred Sects to heave a sigh of relief!]

On the Underworld website, various martial artists exchanged their views. For those Sacred Sects and Clans that had not headed over to Rivertown, their attention was focused on the Underworld website as they waited for the news confirming the Dragon Sect being annihilated.

Argh!

“Shit! The members of the Dragon Sect are really strong! Be careful!”

“Be careful! Be careful!”

Just as the Inborn experts from Dong Hua Sacred Sect and Devil Corpse Palace clashed with the two hundred members of the Dragon Sect, terrifying Charging Swords and Return Swords attacked constantly.

The group of golden swordfish killed over twenty Inborn experts with their incredible swordsmanship.

This stunned the Inborn experts from Dong Hua Sacred Sect and Devil Corpse Palace as they growled loudly.

“Kill!”

At this moment, the dragonians dragonified their arms into terrifying dragon claws to attack their enemies directly.

They were fearless in the face of death.

For the Dragon Sect and the Dragon King, they were willing to sacrifice their lives.

At the most critical moments for the Dragon Sect, all the dragonians unleashed aura that totally disregarded death.

Those fearless attacks together with resilient defensive capabilities sent chills down the spines of the four hundred Inborn experts from Dong Hua Sacred Sect and Devil Corpse Palace.

“Adjaya, Qingyue! Get behind and rest!”

Guan Shuqing stood up and took a deep breath. Xiao Yu and Elder Fang, who were beside her, were equally pale.

The Holy Goddess, Sun Lingxiu, resembled more of a Goddess of Frost at this very moment.

“Attack!”

Guan Shuqing gritted her teeth and waved the lotus truncheon in her hands. Bunches of fire lotus flowers shot towards the enemies before her.

Her attacks seemed limitless and the terrifying attacks continued incessantly. The destructive force of her attacks astounded the crowd that was watching from afar.

“Judgement!”

A white light was emitted from Sun Lingxiu and shot across like rays of aurora beams.

Beside her, Miracle Doctor Blood Man stared ahead bitterly as he tried his best to protect her master.

Xiao Yu and Elder Fang didn’t participate. They were more suited for close-range battles. At this juncture, they had chosen not to charge ahead and had their attention fixed on Emperor Qi and Nie Wushuang.

Around the six of them, two Level 11 golden swordfish were protecting them.

“If we encounter real danger later, I’ll activate the defense array within my truncheon and we will escape together!”

Adjaya supported her own injured body and struggled to stand upright.

“Adjaya, we were wrong in the past. Let me apologize to you. If... If we can get past this calamity, we will be sisters!”

Lan Qingyue had also stood up by now and held Adjaya softly.

“In that case, you will have two more sisters!”

Adjaya laughed liberally as she looked at Sun Lingxiu beside her.

“Sister Lingxiu is great!” Lan Qingyue smiled faintly.

“She’s better than all of you!” Adjaya was direct. She smiled before sighing. “If I knew about this, I wouldn’t have followed him here!”

Lan Qingyue chuckled and knew that Adjaya was just saying that in a fit of displeasure.

That was entirely reasonable. A girl from a foreign country had followed him here. Yet, she didn’t even get to see him for the subsequent period.

And she had to suffer their cold treatment. Ordinary girls wouldn’t have taken such grievances, let alone the fact that she was a princess!

“I’m sorry!” Lan Qingyue said apologetically. She turned to stare at Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi before saying, “Let’s stop the two of them together. There is still hope!”

“That’s right! Xiao Xian’s subordinates are really strong!”

Adjaya looked across the entire battlefield and revealed a smile. The next instant, she turned and looked at Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi coldly!

“Sss. How could the Dragon Sect be so strong?”

“Close to forty or fifty Inborn experts have died. However, it would seem that none from the Dragon Sect have died!”

“Are you sure? How could the members of the Dragon Sect be so terrifying? It feels like they aren’t even on the same fighting level. Even though we have four hundred Inborn experts on our side, it is not certain that we will be able to defeat the two hundred members of the Dragon Sect!”

Scattered around the battlefield, the crowd was shocked while watching the battles unfolding before their eyes.

The battle between six hundred Inborn experts was truly horrifying and astounding.

Yet, after just a minute, they were horrified to see that the Inborn experts on their side were killed rapidly.

Even though they had twice the number of Inborn experts, they were still on the losing end.

If the battle continued as it was, the outcome wasn’t certain yet.

“These disciples of Dragon Sect are really problematic!”

Seeing how the battle had developed, Emperor Qi remarked with a solemn face.

“Let’s get into it and end the battle quickly!”

Ruthlessness flashed across the eyes of Nie Wushuang. He waved the spiritual longsword in his hand and terrifying golden sword energy was launched ahead.

“Kill!”

Emperor Qi moved at the same time and attacked a golden swordfish.

“Now!”

Seeing that Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi had joined in the fight, Lan Qingyue and Adjaya gritted their teeth and headed towards both of them.

Xiao Yu and Elder Fang followed behind resolutely and the black skeletons on them started extending crazily.

“Both of you have just lost and yet you dare to face us again. It seems like I have to cripple both of you completely this time!”

Nie Wushuang remarked harshly when he saw Lan Qingyue and Adjaya charging towards him again.

“This time, we are here too!” Xiao Yu growled.

Without a tinge of fear, she lunged forward with the bone sword in her hand.

Tsk!

Emperor Qi and Nie Wushuang snorted and swung their spiritual equipment across!

Bam!

The spiritual equipment was stopped by Lan Qingyue and the other three girls but they were pushed back.

“The Dragon Sect is truly pretty strong!”

“They are able to reach the Budding Realm in this world that is experiencing the Age of Dharma Decline. Moreover, they are still so young. It would seem like they have inherited some incredibly powerful legacies!”

“It would at least be Immortal-class legacy. Otherwise, they would never have been able to reach such a level!”

“Now that we have descended into the real world ahead of time, we might have a great chance encounter before us!”

The four old men stood by the side and silently watched the battle unfold. All of them had the vibes of being superior to others.

When they saw Lan Qingyue and Adjaya, they were pleasantly surprised.

“Oh gosh! That young girl wasn’t injured at all despite being hit by Sect Leader Nie Wushuang!”

“Shit! Sect Leader Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi have been held back by the four of them while the four hundred Inborn experts are being slaughtered rapidly by the two hundred members of the Dragon Sect. Could it be... The annihilation of the Dragon Sect will turn out to be...”

“It can’t be. This isn’t possible. How could the disciples of the Dragon Sect be so powerful? Look at the fire attacks from that girl. She hasn’t flinched for a moment at all. Her destructive might is too insane!”

“If this goes on, the four hundred Inborn experts will be defeated. It can’t be... How could it be possible that they can’t annihilate the Dragon Sect with such a grand line-up considering that the Dragon King is already dead?”

“Dragon Sect... How could they be so terrifying...”

The surrounding crowd could feel their hearts palpitating violently as they watched the battle before them with disbelief.

Four hundred vs two hundred. Yet, they were being killed rapidly. This had exceeded everyone’s expectations.

On the Underworld website, all the martial artists were astonished to witness what was on the livestream thread.

No one had expected this to happen.

“Could it be that the annihilation mission of the Dragon Sect will end up in failure this time?”

Everyone could feel their hearts skip a beat.

The Dragon Sect was too strong. Even when considering that the Dragon King had died, the two supreme experts of Sect Leader Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi, together with four hundred Inborn experts, still couldn’t eradicate the Dragon Sect! That was horrifying!

It was especially so for the swordsmen with golden longswords. Their attacks were so insane that the crowd could feel their scalps going numb from fear.

A Dan Realm swordsman could even go against two Dan Realm experts and still have the upper hand!

What was most shocking was that Emperor Qi and Sect Leader Nie were held back temporarily and couldn’t join in the fight.

“Trash! It seems like we have to take action ourselves!”

At this moment, an old man, who had stood by the side with a sense of superiority, grumbled discontentedly.

“Alright. Let’s end this quickly so we can interrogate those girls about their legacies!”

“In that case, let’s end it!”

When the bald old man wearing a red suit finished his last word. the group of four old men flew ahead.

“This is the end!”

The four old men commented nonchalantly and the aura around them strengthened instantly.

Rumble!

Terrifying fire pillars rose and shot up over a thousand meters.

The four flaming pillars altered the entire sky.

The auras of the four old men were a lot stronger than Emperor Qi and Nie Wushuang.

“You guys are really trash! It’s just a small Dragon Sect and yet you required us to step in!” an old man commented plainly. He waved his arm and a wave of terrifying attacks swept towards the dragonians and golden swordfish!

Boom!

“Oh gosh! How terrifying! How terrifying! They... They...” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Behind them, all the martial artists in the Underworld that witnessed this were completely dumbfounded.

These auras were too strong. Despite being a distance away, they felt suffocated.

“Those four old men... Sss... Dragon Sect is definitely going to be annihilated now! Even if the Dragon King were around, the outcome wouldn’t change!”

The thousand-meter fire pillars were something that they thought would exist only at the end of the world.

Considering the terrifying might, annihilating a Dragon Sect would be a walk in the park.

In the opinions of these people, the annihilation of Dragon Sect would still be easy even if the Dragon King were around!
