3355 At the edge of the 3354 continent, the Dragon Palace was the king

“Whoosh!”

A terrifying bullet headed towards the two devouring dragons.

One of the devouring dragons looked over and suddenly opened its huge mouth.

A black hole-like energy shot towards the bullet.

“Weng!”

His body shook and numerous earth-attribute devouring dragons surrounded the black hole and attacked the bullet as well.

“Roar Roar!”

Another devouring dragon continued to attack the surrounding mecha battleships.

Every strike destroyed a large number of mecha battleships, causing them to fall to the ground.

“Roar Roar Roar, with your strength, you still want to destroy our Dragon Palace!”

Right at this moment, after ao crab blocked the terrifying bullet, the follow-up attack did not arrive.

He moved his body and charged into the sky above the steel union.

“Roar!”

He opened his mouth and streams of demonic flames descended.

“Boom!”

The terrifying demonic flames destroyed a large number of weapons.

“Whoosh!”

At this moment, Wang Xian made use of his powerful defensive strength and speed to charge out from the flames of war.

His gaze was locked onto a general of the steel union. He flapped his incipient saint wings.

“Crash!”

He pushed his speed to the limit and attacked the general directly.

“Attack him!”

The general sensed Wang Xian’s attack and roared loudly.

Dense shells covered Wang Xian.

A Taiji pattern appeared around him. Wang Xian passed through the attacks of the shells directly.

“Oh no, his speed is too fast!”

When the general saw that all the attacks were ineffective against Wang Xian and saw his terrifying speed, he revealed a look of astonishment.

“Die!”

Wang Xian came to the front of the general and waved his dragon claws!

Boom! Boom! Boom

The general shot out streams of terrifying energy, but it had no effect on the dragon claws.

The Dragon Claw landed and the general fell into Wang Xian’s Dragon Claw.

Boom

The sound of an explosion came from his Dragon Claw. Wang Xian scanned his surroundings coldly.

“Not good!”

“That Dragon King’s strength is also extremely terrifying. We are not his match!”

“A general is dead!”

A general was killed by Wang Xian. Everyone in the surroundings was filled with fear.

This was a general of their steel union. He was practically an immortal existence.

“Warning! Warning! The enemy is too powerful. The base is unable to fight back. The base is unable to fight back!”

At this moment, the voice of the AI sounded in the minds of the generals in the cockpit of the huge battleships.

Upon hearing this voice, the faces of everyone in the steel union changed drastically.

“Damn it, how can there be four universe Knight Level 9 warriors in the Dragon Palace, how is this possible!”

The leader of the Iron and Steel Union roared indignantly.

“Leader, we are not their match, activate the Absolute Defense!”

A general saw all the warriors of the Dragon Palace rushing into the area of their base and roared ferociously.

“Activate the Absolute Defense!”

The leader of the steel union shouted and gave the order.

Boom! Boom! Boom

At this moment, a light shield rose around him and spread in all directions.

“All the disciples of the Steel Union retreat into the core circle!”

“Fire at the experts of the Dragon Palace!”

The generals immediately gave the order loudly.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The self-destructing mech spaceships charged at Wang Xian and ao crab without any regard for their lives. The sound of explosions kept ringing out.

The light shield began to envelop and form a golden defensive space.

This golden glow was not the power of technology, but the defense of the grotto-heaven paradise in their base.

“Boss, help me destroy this Golden Sawtooth First!”

At this time, the swallowing dragon that had been fighting with the Golden Sawtooth roared at ao crab and the others.

The Golden Sawtooth was very powerful, and it seemed to have intelligence as it kept rotating.

The terrifying golden sawtooth cut through all the energy.

It made the swallowing dragon, a level 9 knight, have to avoid it.

This was the strongest weapon of the steel union.

It was made of metal from a blessed land and a brain.

Even though it had a single attack, it couldn’t kill a level 9 knight.

However, when a level 9 knight was entangled, it would be a headache!

“Suppress this Golden Sawtooth!”

Ao crab roared and turned to attack the Golden Sawtooth.

There was only a Level 9 universe Knight Devouring Dragon accompanying Wang Xian.

He stared at the shield in front of him and waved his dragon claws.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Terrifying waves landed on the shield, but it didn’t budge at all.

This caused the devouring dragon to frown slightly.

“Dragon King, the defense of this shield is extremely terrifying!”

He immediately transmitted his voice. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Shield, Hehe!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly. He did not mind it and looked to the side.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The Golden Sawtooth was moving slower and slower under the attacks of Ao crab and the other devouring dragons.

“Oh no, sawtooth is about to be suppressed!”

Within the Steel Union’s Protective Shield, the generals saw sawtooth being suppressed by ao crab and the others, and their expressions were extremely ugly.

This sawtooth could be said to be the steel union’s biggest trump card.

And now it was being suppressed by the Dragon Palace!

“This dragon palace is too powerful, luckily we still have the protection of this blessed land.”

A general’s forehead broke out in cold sweat, and his expression was extremely ugly as he said.

Four universe knights and Level 9 warriors were not something the iron and steel union could fight against.

The leader of the iron and Steel Union stood in the center, his expression changing constantly.

“Look at the AI, the AI has sent news that the lich kingdom and the wrapped corpse race have been destroyed, completely destroyed!”

At this time, a general exclaimed.

“What!”

Everyone was shocked.

“It should be the two knights from the Dragon Palace, they were ready to destroy us when we were about to attack!”

The generals trembled, their expressions dark.

When they were about to destroy the Dragon Palace, the Dragon Palace was also preparing to destroy them.

“Sawtooth has been stopped by them!”

“Phew, the Dragon Palace is too powerful!”

At this moment, a general looked at the area in front of him. Sawtooth’s energy had almost been consumed.

“Fortunately, our paradise is strong enough and has a terrifying defensive barrier!”

At this moment, all the senior disciples of the iron and Steel Union felt lucky.

“Beep Beep Beep, enemy invasion, enemy invasion!”

At this moment, an unusually urgent voice suddenly resounded throughout the entire space.

Figures slowly appeared behind the iron and steel union base that covered half of the base.
