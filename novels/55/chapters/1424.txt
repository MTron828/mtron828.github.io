Chapter 1425: 1425 multi-colored algae Demon Beast

“Hehe, young master Wang’s connections are so strong. I’ll let young master Wang contact the Light Dragon Dynasty and the Heaven Sword sect!”

“That’s right, that’s right. If he can even settle his daughter, wouldn’t that mean everything would be easy to settle?”

As soon as the white-haired old man finished speaking, the voices of Guan Shuqing and the other girls rang out.

They stared at Wang Xian with smiles on their faces. Their eyes were filled with sarcasm.

When the white-haired old man saw this situation, as someone who had lived for more than a thousand years, he naturally knew that he had said the wrong thing.

However, his expression did not change as he picked up his teacup and took a sip. He was extremely calm.

In fact, he even felt a little good in his heart!

Serves him right!

“Ahem, I’m not too familiar with you. I’m not too familiar with you!”

Wang Xian coughed.

“Then regarding the matter of the alliance, I’ll have to trouble you in a few days!”

Feng Luan said to Wang Xian.

“I’ll give it a try, I’ll give it a try!”

Wang Xian felt a few unfriendly gazes and smiled awkwardly.

At this moment, the communication stone plate in his interspatial ring vibrated!

“HMM?”

Wang Xian took out the communication stone plate and looked at it. He raised his eyebrows slightly.

“There’s something I need to take care of at the Dragon Palace. I need to make a trip there now!”

Wang Xian said directly to Guan Shuqing and the rest.

“What a coincidence!”

A few girls sized him up from head to toe.

“Really!”

Wang Xian took the communication stone plate!

“If you have something to do, you can go back first!”

Sun Lingxiu smiled and said to him.

“We will go back after discussing some matters with the blood stream sect. If something happens at the Dragon Palace, you can go back first!”

Feng Luan also smiled at the side.

“Okay, Ao Jian, you guys stay here and protect them!”

Wang Xian nodded and turned around to fly out.

He slipped away!

Guan Shuqing and Xiao Yu rolled their eyes when they saw Wang Xian’s fleeing figure.

“Interesting. A powerful marine demonic beast race suddenly appeared near the Dragon Palace. It seems to be coming from the sea area around the human-demon graveyard!”

Wang Xian flew into the sky and sped toward the Dragon Palace.

Prime Minister Gui had just sent a message. A group of powerful demonic beasts had appeared within the Dragon Palace’s territory.

Among the group of Demonic Beasts, there was an existence at level five of the Seethrough realm.

Level five of the Seethrough realm. It seems to be a demonic beast in the human-demon graveyard?

This reminded Wang Xian of the recent changes in the human-demon graveyard.

Buzz

Wang Xian increased his speed and flew towards the dragon palace at an extremely fast speed.

When his strength reached the void interpretation realm, his speed was 10,000 to 20,000 Childe per hour, which was more than ten times the speed of sound!

This speed was already extremely terrifying. He couldn’t even see a shadow.

It took Wang Xian a full ten hours before he returned to the sky above the Dragon Palace.

Bang

After entering the Dragon Palace, Prime Minister Gui rushed over immediately.

“Dragon King!”

“What’s the current situation?”

Wang Xian asked Prime Minister Gui directly.

“The Demonic Beast Race hasn’t moved yet. They are located 11,200 kilometers northeast of our Dragon Palace. A group of strange demons are monitoring them!”

Prime Minister GUI reported immediately.

“Do you know what they are doing here?”

Wang Xian asked with a twinkle in his eyes.

“We don’t know yet. Dragon King, should we make a move first?”

Prime Minister Gui asked.

“Call the Warriors of our Dragon Palace over. We will go and take a look!”

Wang Xian said without hesitation.

If they were enemies of a powerful demonic beast race, they would kill them immediately!

The current Dragon Palace had 100% control over the surrounding sea area. If there were any unstable factors, they would either submit or die.

The strong preyed on the weak!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister GUI nodded and swam to the side.

“Wuwuwu!”

Soon, the sound of a horn was heard from the Dragon Palace, and the members of the Dragon Palace quickly flew toward the dragon field.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang

The sound of metal could be heard, and the demon monkeys holding golden cudgels appeared one after another!

The thunder prawns, which were shining with blue light, had armor on their vital parts.

Golden Swordfish that were covered in golden armor and were emitting golden light.

Heavenly Eye archers who were holding metal bows and wearing light armor

Dolphins and colorful sea snakes.

Nine flood dragons that were forty meters in size.

Each member of the Dragon Palace contained a terrifying power.

Compared to a year ago, they were now fully armed. Each of them was holding a void interpretation level weapon.

They were wearing armor of the void interpretation level.

Compared to the past, their combat strength had increased by at least 30% .

One should not underestimate this 30% .

Perhaps the current members of the Dragon clan with six to seven members at level one of the void interpretation level could fight against a strong enemy at level three of the void interpretation level. In the past, they would need at least 10 of them.

This was the powerful benefit of weapons!

In just a short span of 10 seconds, more than 2,000 warriors of the Dragon Clan arrived at the Dragon Field in an orderly manner.

“The target is more than 10,000 kilometers away. Let’s set off immediately!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across all the members of the Dragon Palace. A satisfied expression appeared on his face as he shouted softly.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

All the members of the Dragon Palace shouted softly.

“Roar! Roar!”

The nine flood dragons roared and pulled the dragon chair to the front.

Wang Xian moved his body and sat directly in front of the Dragon Chair. The Army of the Dragon Palace rushed toward the northeast direction.

It was vast and mighty! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Although there were only about 2,000 members of the Dragon Palace who followed him on this expedition, there were 1,000 insightful void realm experts.

More than 2,000 creatures were equivalent to the combined forces of 30 to 40 dynasties.

Even the insightful void realm experts of the blood flow empire were only so many.

The members of the Dragon Palace traveled at a very fast speed in the water. They could cover a distance of more than 10,000 kilometers in just a little over two hours.

“Reporting to the Dragon King, that powerful demonic beast race is located 50 kilometers ahead!”

When the Army of the Dragon Palace arrived, Ao Yao, who had been scouting nearby, appeared in front of the army and reported to Wang Xian.

“Ao Yao, how is the opponent’s strength?”

Wang Xian asked Ao Yao.

“Dragon King, the opponent is a wood elemental sea creature. There are two experts at level five of the void interpretation stage, six at level four of the void interpretation stage, more than a dozen at level three of the void interpretation stage, and more than 20 other void interpretation stage experts!”

Ao Yao reported directly.

“Two level five void interpretation experts?”

Wang Xian mumbled, “Surround them directly!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The Demon War division and the Thunder Division surrounded him from both wings.

The nine flood dragons pulled their thrones and continued to charge forward.

In front of them was an area with dense seaweed. Seaweed that was three to four meters tall was swaying on the bottom of the sea.

In the middle of the seaweed, more than a thousand creatures were scattered around.

This was an extremely beautiful demon beast. It had colorful colors, just like beautiful seaweed.

It had colorful eyes. If they stood there without moving, they would think that it was a special undersea plant.

“WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH!”

More than a thousand colorful demon beasts were moving within a radius of ten kilometers. Suddenly, a special language was transmitted.

“Sou Sou Sou!”

Following that, in the center, a five to six meter long demonic beast with a beautiful head floated in the middle of the ocean. Its eyes were filled with vigilance.

A special sound was emitted from its body, causing all the surrounding demonic beasts to float in the ocean. Its eyes were filled with coldness!
