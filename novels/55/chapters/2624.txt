2625 2,625 level 8 abyssal seeds

“Roar Roar Roar!”

Within the Abyss, 5 to 6 million abyssal seeds roared, the leader of the Undying King Level 8 abyssal seeds exuded a ferocious aura!

The vast killing Aura, long black claws, it looked extremely terrifying!

Behind it, close to 1,000 undying king abyssal seeds followed behind, their aura billowing to the skies!

The Beichuan sect members saw a large portion of the abyss seeds rushing towards the Dragon Mountain on the right, they couldn’t help but look over!

They already knew that the master of the Frost Goddess had brought people over to hunt the abyss seeds!

Now that they saw the Dragon Palace and Dragon Mountain rushing towards the abyss seeds, they were stunned!

Was this courting death?

That was an undying level 8 abyss seed, an existence that even their forefather had to be careful against!

“Damn it, if the Dragon Palace people are massacred, at most we can save the Dragon King!”

Bei Chuan clan forefather looked over, growling with a solemn face!

Saving the Dragon King was also because he was bei Shuang’s master, dying here would cause bei Shuang’s heart to form a bond!

“I’m here, Dragon King. Let me show you the powerful divine weapon forged by the fire hammer clan and the array formation I’ve set up!”

On the command platform of Dragon Peak, Sky Formation revealed a sinister smile when he saw five to six million abyssal seeds charging towards them!

“Sky Eye Arrow Division’s Free Attack!”

“Starwood Dragon Division’s Free Attack!”

“Fire Hammer clan, get ready!”

The Heaven’s formation immediately gave out orders. In the Dragon Peak, Mou Zesen and the rest of the heaven’s Eye Arrow Division members shot arrows forward one after another!

Wang Xian stood on the command platform and watched this scene with a smile on his face!

“Enter the attack range, fire hammer clan, Attack!”

When the group of Abyss species entered a range of hundreds of millions of kilometers, the order to attack was given!

“Hahaha, let’s see the fiery golden sword forged by our fire hammer clan!”

Duan Jinming and the others’eyes flashed with excitement!

At the positions of the holes in Dragon Peak, something that looked like an altar was placed below!

On the altar, a fiery golden giant sword slowly condensed!

The giant sword ranged from 1,000 meters to 5,000 meters in size. It contained a terrifying power!

There were over 1,000 of these powerful godly swords!

“Sou Sou Sou!”

All the huge swords trembled, in the next moment, they charged forward to attack!

A fiery red mixed with gold marks tore through the void of the Abyss!

“Weng!”

At the instant the huge swords attacked, they were at the Dragon Eye above the Dragon Mountain Command Board!

At this time, a pair of dragon eyes gleamed, two green spears flew out from the Dragon Eye, their target was the Undying Emperor Level 8 abyss seed in the center!

Dragon Mountain continued to fly forward at a terrifying speed!

“Howl Howl Howl!”

The group of Abyss species felt the attack from Dragon Mountain, they were slightly shocked, roaring angrily!

The leader of the undying level 8 abyss species stared at the 2 green lances that instantly reached him, spitting out lava like flame laws!

“Peng Peng Peng!”

A terrifying collision resounded in space, the aftershock of the green spears and lava laws caused the undying level abyss seeds behind to instantly be heavily injured!

“Qiang Qiang Qiang!”

At this time, the golden blades covered in flames also rushed into the Abyss!

“Pu Pu Pu!”

The terrifying flame blades pierced through the abyss seeds!

“Howl Howl Howl!”

“Peng!”

A Flaming Gold Sword landed on the Undying Level 3 abyss seed, making a terrifying sound of collision!

Following a huge sound, the flaming gold sword immediately became an even more terrifying sword!

The tiny sword instantly pierced through the abyss seed!

In other places, the terrifying sword also pierced through the surrounding powerful abyss seeds!

“Sou Sou Sou!”

At this time, the Sky Eye Arrow Rain also fell, covering all the abyssal seeds!

“Howl Howl Howl!”

Screams rang out continuously!

...

“Howl!”

The undying level 8 abyssal seed saw this scene, its face filled with rage as it instantly arrived in front of Dragon Mountain!

It jumped up high, its 10,000 m body and 1,000 m claws, attacking towards the top of Dragon Mountain!

“Rumble Rumble Rumble!”

However in the next moment, at the Dragon Horn on Dragon Mountain, beams of light from the cross shot towards it! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Peng Peng Peng!”

Continuous beams of light from the cross landed on the undying level 8 abyss species!

“Howl Howl Howl!”

The Abyss species let out a howl of fear, large chunks of its flesh were cut off, fresh blood splattered everywhere!

“Sou Sou Sou!”

At this time, Dragon Mountain’s attack wasn’t over yet, many thorns rushed out from within, swiftly twining in the air, forming a huge hand grab!

...

“Peng!”

The Twining Hand grabbed the undying level 8 abyss seed, the thorns were like venomous snake teeth, piercing into its body!

“Howl!”

An incomparably painful howl came from its mouth, the level 8 seed struggled madly, however its life force quickly vanished!

The thorns grabbed its corpse and retreated back into Dragon Mountain!

“Attack!”

At this time, on the altars of Dragon Mountain, another fiery golden blade condensed!

The second round of attacks began!

Over 1,000 sharp blades, every one of them could threaten an undying emperor level warrior, along with the 30,000 over Sky Eye Arrows, there were only half of the 5 to 6 million abyss seeds!

Sou Sou Sou

The huge swords flew, blossoming into fiery golden flowers in the abyss seeds!

One after another, the abyss seeds quickly fell!

“Howl Howl!”

Terrified voices came out of the mouths of some of the abyss seeds, large amounts of their comrades were killed, causing them to Panic!

Some of the abyss seeds wanted to escape!

“Follow me and leave those abyss seeds behind!”

Ao Xing Mu’s body moved and he headed straight for the group of Abyss species!

There were many abyss species heavily injured in front of him, he couldn’t let them escape!

“It’s leader!”

The Starwood Dragon species swiftly flew into space, chasing after the abyss species!

“Hiss... this... this...”

The Beichuan sect members watched as the 5 to 6 million abyss species fled at a terrifying speed, their faces filled with shock!

“That undying level 8 abyss seed was killed by the Dragon Palace, that huge mountain is terrifying!”

“What level of war machine is this, to actually be able to kill an undying level 8 abyss seed, it’s too strong!”

“So Strong, that Dragon Palace’s strength is too strong!”

Exclamations came from their mouths, killing an undying level 8 abyss seed, ever since the eruption of the Abyss, only their sect leader had joined forces with the frost goddess over 10 days ago to do so!

However that incomparably powerful Dragon Mountain had actually killed an undying level 8 abyss seed in such a short period of time!

“What a powerful war machine, killing an level 8 abyss seed so easily, this war machine can at least deal with two or three, or even three or four level 8 abyss seeds!”

The bei Chuan sect elder muttered with a face full of shock!
