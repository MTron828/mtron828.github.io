3540 3539 the rise of the Dragon Palace’s migration

The news of the suspected destruction of the Hundred Cities Alliance spread like wildfire in the universe’s AI!

In particular, the person who spread the news claimed that the Dragon Palace had destroyed the Hundred Cities Alliance.

Many people found it unbelievable and couldn’t believe it!

However, as time passed, after five to six hours, images were transmitted to the universe’s AI.

The images were of the Hundred City Peak.

These images were taken by the dozen strong warriors.

They only dared to come to the hundred city peak after all the strong warriors of the Dragon Palace had left.

Under the destruction of the great battle, many of the Hundred City Peaks had collapsed.

However, only a few dozen had collapsed!

This was because this war was a war that the dragon palace had completely crushed.

The war was extremely tragic for the Hundred City Alliance, but it wasn’t tragic at all for the Dragon Palace.

On the contrary, it easily destroyed the Hundred City Alliance, and there weren’t too many fierce battles!

This also made the battlefield not too tragic!

However, when the image of the Hundred City Peak was uploaded to the Universe AI, many people immediately recognized that this was the headquarters of the Hundred City Alliance, the Hundred City Peak! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

At this time, there were no longer any living beings within, it looked extremely desolate!

Below, there was still some blood, not much blood!

“A crushing battle, it was an easy crushing battle. Dragon Palace Dragon Emperor and the others flew straight to 100 city peak and easily killed the alliance leader. The 300 universe rulers of 100 city peak were unable to resist, we want to know now, why is Dragon Palace so strong?”

On this screen, there was a line of questions.

This information could be said to be the stone hammer that destroyed the Hundred City Alliance!

It was really destroyed, completely destroyed!

“Hiss, Hundred City Peak is the headquarters of the Hundred City Alliance. Hundred City Alliance leader is a powerful wizard. As a wizard, he has operated hundred city peak for billions of years, and his strength is at the level of a universe ruler at level 3. With the advantage of the array formation and the geographical advantage, it’s definitely not a problem for one person to fight against two or three of the same level. Even so, he’s still easily destroyed?”

“How powerful is this Dragon Palace? They killed their way to the headquarters of the Hundred City Alliance and annihilated them. There must be more than one or two level 3 universe masters in Dragon Palace!”

“Is this the power of Dragon Palace? Why do I feel that they are getting more and more terrifying each time? Aren’t they too powerful?”

“I want to know if there are any great beings from the ancestral dragon bloodline participating in this battle? If there aren’t, then this dragon palace is simply too terrifying!”

On the universe AI, Stone Hammer was discussing the news of the destruction of the Hundred Cities Alliance. Countless great beings were discussing with shocked expressions!

The power that the Dragon Palace displayed was too terrifying!

The other party was the Hundred Cities Alliance!

However, with the Alliance of a group of high-level races, if the ancestral dragon bloodline didn’t interfere, then how powerful was the Dragon Palace?

How powerful was the force that could easily destroy the Hundred Cities Alliance?

“The battle between the ancestral dragon bloodline and the Sacred Dragon bloodline is still going on. The ancestral dragon bloodline probably didn’t help the Dragon Palace, but the Dragon Palace could easily destroy the ancestral dragon bloodline. The Dragon Palace is the third largest Divine Dragon Force!”

Some experts sighed in their hearts.

With such strength, they were already able to dominate the inner regions of the heaven-splitting chaotic land and were among the top advanced races!

Now, the number of advanced races that were stronger than the Dragon Palace could be counted with one’s fingers!

The third largest divine dragon force, the Dragon Palace, had completely risen!

Just as all the disciples of the powerhouses were discussing about the dragon palace on the Universal Ai, Wang Xian and the rest had already returned from the Dragon Palace!

All the treasures in the Hundred Cities Alliance had been obtained by them.

The resources this time were extremely terrifying!

“All of you disciples, increase your strength immediately. I want to move the Dragon Palace to the river of Eternity First!”

Wang Xian stood in front of the Dragon Throne and said with a smile.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

All the leaders of the Dragon Palace replied immediately!

The resources they had obtained this time were enough to bring about an earth-shattering change in the strength of the Dragon Palace!

Wang Xian smiled and waved his arm. Some of the formations that were originally used by the Hundred Cities Alliance to suppress the Dragon Palace instantly collapsed!

He moved and arrived above the Dragon Palace. Following closely behind, he brought the Dragon Palace along and headed toward the river of eternity.

The flying speed of the Dragon Palace was not slow under the lead of Wang Xian and the rest. However, it would still take nearly three years to reach the river of eternity.

At this time, it would be over in a snap of the fingers in the heaven-splitting primordial land!

Wang Xian had no other choice. The Dragon Palace was still located at the edge of the heaven-splitting primordial land.

It was merely at the edge of the land and Sea of mountains and seas.

The distance was still too far!

However, Wang Xian only needed to control the flying direction of the Dragon Palace slightly!

Moreover, it would not delay his cultivation!

The Dragon Palace was flying in the ocean of mountains and seas. Lei Ming, Ao Qitian, and the rest were around them, intimidating some desolate beasts.

Wang Xian moved his palm and the five elements millstone appeared in front of him. With a move of his palm, more than 300 innate spiritual treasures appeared in front of him.

Innate spiritual treasures were not as precious as innate supreme treasures.

There were quite a number of innate spiritual treasures. Most importantly, innate spiritual treasures could be forged from the body parts of powerful desolate beasts and living beings.

All the Masters of the universe in the Bai Cheng Alliance possessed innate numinous treasures.

Furthermore, Wang Xian had obtained more than 300 innate numinous treasures with just the five elements attributes!

With more than 300 innate numinous treasures, the five elements Millstone had a 100% chance of making a breakthrough. However, he did not know if it would be able to cross a level and reach the level of a Master of the universe, the level of an innate numinous treasure!

He sat cross-legged in the sky above the Dragon Palace, and the Five Elements Millstone was quickly absorbing more than 300 innate spiritual treasures of the five elements.

The Five Elements Millstone was absorbing at a very fast speed. It was almost one innate true treasure a day.

However, it would still take more than half a year to completely absorb it!

“This… This Dragon King actually destroyed the Hundred Cities Alliance. This is simply unbelievable!”

At the same time, in a Green Dragon Palace, Green Dragon Moon, Green Dragon Beard Shadow, and the other great beings from the ancestral dragon lineage saw this information on the universe AI, and their faces were filled with disbelief.

The Hundred City Alliance was destroyed?

Destroyed by the Dragon Palace?

This…

“How powerful are the Dragon King and the others now? With the power of the Hundred City Alliance, to attack their nest and destroy them, they would need at least three or four universe masters with level 3 Combat Power, right?”

Green Dragon Moon was shocked.

“At least, I didn’t expect it. I didn’t expect the power of the Dragon Palace to be so terrifying. Did they get an opportunity to grow?”

Green Dragon Shadow shook his head in surprise.

He couldn’t understand it at all!

“However, the Dragon Palace destroying the Hundred Cities Alliance will benefit US greatly. The Holy Dragon Clan and the Dragon Palace are destined to be enemies!”

The Azure Dragon Whisker Shadow said with a twinkle in his eyes.

The Azure Dragon Moon and the others nodded. The Dragon Clan and the Holy Dragon Clan were already enemies.

The stronger the Dragon Clan was, the greater the benefits to the Holy Dragon Clan!
