Chapter 991: 0992, he must die

Translator: 5496903

A group of twenty people with three special lines on their faces walked in the center.

Their voices rang out in the surroundings. One by one, they flew down from the sky and scanned their surroundings.

“Eh? Deputy Commander Xiao, your luck is a little bad this time. You actually encountered so many powerful thunderfish!”

Yun Hanhai looked at deputy leader Xiao who was treating his wounds and asked in surprise.

“Yes!”

When deputy leader Xiao saw them arriving, he swept his gaze across Wang Xian. Suddenly, he frowned and nodded his head slowly.

“We encountered some danger just now. We don’t need your help now. You guys can go back to your work. Thank you!”

Deputy leader Xiao’s eyes flickered as he asked.

The group of girls from the amethyst mercenary group looked at each other when they saw them. They glanced at Wang Xian who was at the side and thought to themselves, this is not good.

“Yes, we have settled everything. Thank you, Deputy Leader Yun, for coming to help us. There’s no need for that now. Let us recuperate for a while. You guys can go on with your work!”

“Yes, yes. Thank you, young master, for coming to help us!”

A few girls hurriedly said to Yun Hanhai and the others.

“Vice regiment commander Xiao, what kind of danger have you encountered!”

At this moment, another voice came from afar.

Following that, more than ten people rushed over from not far away.

Vice regiment commander Xiao frowned slightly. “It’s fine. Sorry for disturbing everyone. You guys go back to your work!”

“It’s fine, it’s fine!”

The ten or so youths who came shook their heads and looked at the young master’s mercenary group at the side. They hurriedly said, “Deputy Regiment Commander Yun, you’re here too!”

“En!”

Yun Hanhai nodded. “I saw the amethyst mercenary group calling for help, so I came.”

“Oh right, did you guys see that newborn kid?”

Yun Hanhai asked the group of mercenary group members.

“No. If we meet him, we will definitely tell Deputy Leader Yun!”

The leader of the group of mercenaries said hurriedly.

Yun Hanhai nodded his head indifferently and said coldly, “He’s just a kid. He’s hiding very well!”

The group of girls from the amethyst mercenary group frowned when they heard Yun Hanhai’s words. Their eyes would glance at Wang Xian from time to time.

At this moment, Wang Xian’s entire body was in tatters. There were wounds all over his body. Therefore, he was not discovered for the time being.

However, if one were to take a closer look, they would definitely realize that he was the person they were looking for.

Currently, although Wang Xian’s strength was abnormally strong, he was severely injured. When he attacked just now, he almost fell down. He had already reached his limit.

If he was discovered by the people in the young master’s mercenary group at this moment, it would be troublesome.

“Alright!”

Yun Hanhai nodded his head and looked at deputy chief Xiao. “If the amethyst mercenary group encounters that kid, please inform Deputy Chief Xiao!”

“Sure!”

Deputy Chief Xiao nodded his head perfunctorily.

“Eh, that... That!”

Suddenly, one of the members of the mercenary group at the side looked at Wang Xian with a surprised expression.

“Isn’t that... isn’t that the new Wang Xian?”

He pointed his finger over and asked with an astonished expression.

“Huh?”

The members of the young master’s mercenary group and the people beside him were slightly stunned as they looked over with an astonished expression.

Yun Hanhai squinted his eyes slightly as he looked at Wang Xian who was sitting cross-legged on the ground.

He didn’t notice when he saw a few members of the amethyst mercenary group who were severely injured and recovering while sitting cross-legged on the ground.

Now, it seemed like...

“Wang Xian!”

“Deputy leader Xiao, you guys are a little unscrupulous. You are clearly here, yet you didn’t tell us!”

Yun Hanhai glanced at her and slowly waved at the person beside him.

“That’s right, deputy leader Xiao. This kid has repeatedly embarrassed our young master’s mercenary group. Moreover, we have already announced that we are going to deal with this kid. If we let him escape this time, our young master’s mercenary group will be greatly embarrassed!”

A young man beside Yun Hanhai walked out and said to deputy leader Xiao with a smile on his face.

“Wow!”

As he said that, he pulled out the longsword in his hand and stared at Wang Xian coldly. A teasing look appeared on his face as he said, “Hey kid, Wake Up!”

Wang Xian sensed the people from the young master’s mercenary group. He frowned slightly and ignored them.

Just as the amethyst mercenary group had guessed, the three attacks earlier had drained all his strength. Now, he had to recover.

In just a few minutes, he would be able to fight for about ten seconds.

“Hehe, looks like your injuries are not light. TSK TSK, I think there’s no need for you to suffer so much. Let us send you to hell!”

When the young man saw that Wang Xian did not respond, he held his longsword and spoke mockingly as he walked over.

“Stop!”

Qin Qing and the other seven or eight girls who were not injured stood up immediately and shouted at the young man.

They moved and immediately came in front of them to block him.

“Huh?”

The young man was slightly stunned. He turned around and looked at Yun Hanhai.

“Deputy commander Xiao, what’s going on? You Didn’t tell us that that Kid was with you just now, so why are you stopping us now?”

Yun Hanhai’s eyes flickered. “Doesn’t this kid have a grudge with you?”

“Deputy Commander Yun, this friend just saved our lives, so we naturally have to protect him!”

Deputy Commander Xiao’s face was slightly pale as he stood up and said to Yun Hanhai.

“Deputy captain Xiao, what do you mean by this?”

Yun Hanhai’s face turned cold slowly. “You want to protect this kid?”

“He saved our lives. Naturally, we have to protect our benefactor!”

Deputy Captain Xiao stared at Yun Hanhai expressionlessly.

“Deputy Captain Xiao, you have to know that this kid is someone that our young master must kill. He must die. No one can stop him!”

Yun Hanhai stared at her coldly and walked slowly towards Wang Xian.

The people beside him immediately followed behind.

“He provoked our young master’s mercenary group. No matter who he is, he must die!”

A middle-aged powerhouse beside Yun Hanhai swept a cold glance at the members of the amethyst mercenary group and said coldly.

“Young master’s mercenary group. Don’t tell me you want to go against our amethyst mercenary group?”

Vice Commander Xiao also walked over with an embarrassed expression and confronted them.

“You want to go against our young master’s mercenary group because of a kid?”

Yun Hanhai’s expression immediately darkened as he coldly said.

Vice Commander Xiao and the others didn’t say anything. However, they stood in front of him and said everything.

“He must die, Xiao Yuanyuan. All of you are already injured. You Can’t Stop Us!”

Yun Hanhai said with a cold face.

“We will protect him today. Don’t even think about hurting him!”

Deputy Commander Xiao pulled out the long saber in his hand and said with a determined face.

The girls of the amethyst mercenary group also took out their weapons and stared at Yun Hanhai and the others angrily!Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates
