Chapter 1170: 1171 to make up for it

Translator: 5496903

When Bright Moon City was once again enveloped by the dragon thorns, Wang Xian had already arrived at the royal city of Dragon and Phoenix.

Currently, hundreds of thousands of citizens were expanding the city in the royal city of Dragon and Phoenix.

It could be seen that the citizens were building their homes with passion.

In the past, due to the help of Wang Xian and the policies of Feng Luan, the citizens of the royal city were united as one.

When the people were united, the speed of building a city would be doubled.

In this world with powerful martial arts, even if the city walls were dozens of meters high and dozens of meters wide, the speed of construction was still terrifying.

However, it took almost all of Feng Luan’s savings to build this city.

This was also because Feng Luan had higher requirements for the city walls. Otherwise, the resources she took out would be enough to build seven to eight cities like Bright Moon City.

After all, this was the starting point of the dragon-phoenix Empire, the future Dragon-phoenix royal city.

“Aren’t you going back to the Dragon Palace?”

Feng Luan saw Wang Xian following her into the Dragon-phoenix royal city and asked him curiously.

“I have something to take care of!”

Wang Xian smiled and looked into the dragon-phoenix royal city.

Feng Luan looked at the ice-fire civet cat on his shoulder and rolled her eyes at him. She didn’t say anything else.

Wang Xian came to the side of the mayor’s residence. He looked at the room and the items in the interspatial ring. Then, he walked over with a smile on his face.

Knock, Knock

There was a knock on the door. In the courtyard, Zhang Fengying was sitting under a tree. Beside her, there were a few sculptures.

These sculptures all looked like her family members.

Looking at the sculptures, she was a little absent-minded. However, compared to before, the sadness in her eyes was much less.

Time could heal all wounds.

However, time made her feel lonely. In this city, she didn’t know what she could do without her family?

She didn’t know what beliefs she had to support her to survive.

When she heard the knocking on the door, she forced a smile on her face.

“Liuyan, come in!”

She said softly!

“UH...”

The door was pushed open. When Wang Xian heard Zhang Fengying’s words, he felt a little embarrassed. It seemed that she had mistaken him for Jin Liuyan.

“Huh? Wang Xian!”

When Zhang Fengying saw Wang Xian, she was slightly stunned. She squeezed out a smile and shouted softly.

She was filled with curiosity towards this young man in front of her at the beginning.

She really wanted to get to know this young man. She even knew that she had a good impression of him.

However, the disaster that followed caused her to have mixed feelings.

If it wasn’t for Wang Xian, their Zhang family wouldn’t have been wiped out.

“Fengying, I went on a long trip a few days ago and brought some gifts for you!”

Wang Xian looked at her expression and felt a little helpless. He walked over with a smile.

“No, I don’t need it!”

Zhang Fengying looked at Wang Xian and shook her head slowly. She didn’t know how to face him.

“I’ll leave it with you. HMM, you must use it as soon as possible. Don’t let others see it. Also, I’ll give you a cat so that you won’t be so bored in the future!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he carried the ice fire civet cat on his shoulder and gestured to the little guy.

“Meow!”

The ice fire civet cat licked Wang Xian reluctantly.

However, after Wang Xian glared at it, the little fella turned its head with a twinkle in its eyes and jumped to Zhang Fengying’s side easily.

“Meow!”

The fire and ice civet cat looked at Zhang Fengying and stretched out its hand to lick her palm.

Zhang Fengying looked at the two tails and the red and blue eyes. A hint of shock appeared in her eyes.

“This is the fire and Ice Civet Cat Demon Beast. It can speak human language. You need to teach it well!”

Wang Xian spoke to Zhang Fengying. With a move of his arm, a bloodline that was emitting a strong vitality appeared in front of him.

The bloodline contained a majestic energy. Instinctively, it made all the living beings around them restless.

If there were ferocious beasts around, they would definitely go crazy over the bloodline.

“This is the bloodline of the tarsal bone demon beast. It can improve your bloodline. Absorb it as soon as possible!”

“In addition, this is the inheritance of a beast tamer. If you are interested, you can cultivate it. If you are not interested, you can just burn it!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he placed the items beside Zhang Fengying one by one.

When she looked at the legendary Demonic Beast Cub in front of her, which she had read about in a certain document, and looked at the bloodline inheritance that contained such terrifying bloodline energy that was at least at the fifth and sixth level of the Void interpretation realm, her heart pounded violently.

As for the last inheritance, to be able to be placed together with the Demonic Beast Cub and the Void Interpretation Bloodline, it was definitely not simple.

Zhang Fengying stared at Wang Xian with her eyes wide open. Her eyes were filled with disbelief.

“These things of yours, are these still...”

She said to Wang Xian in a panic.

It was at least the inheritance of the fifth-level Void Interpretation Demonic Beast Bloodline, the legendary demonic beast ice fire civet cat, and the inheritance of a Beast Tamer.

Regardless of which one it was, it was a treasure that could make the entire kingdom and even the entire Liuhai region go crazy.

Yet now, Wang Xian actually gave all three treasures to her.

This...

“Take it as compensation for you. You should quickly absorb the Demon Beast bloodline now. If you need anything in the future, contact me!”

Wang Xian smiled and said to her.

“These items are too precious. I Can’t take them from you!”

Zhang Fengying shook her head quickly.

The things that Wang Xian gave her were beyond her imagination.

“Take it. Alright, I’m leaving now. Contact me if you need anything. Also, you must use the demonic beast bloodline as soon as possible!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

As Wang Xian spoke, he walked out.

When Zhang Fengying saw Wang Xian leaving, she opened her mouth and stood up immediately.

She was wearing a long, loose robe that covered her knees.

Even with the loose clothes, one could still tell that she had an extremely good figure.

She opened her mouth but saw Wang Xian’s figure move and disappear.

“Meow, beautiful Zhang Fengying, Hello!”

At this moment, the ice fire civet cat on her suddenly spoke to her.

Zhang Fengying was slightly stunned. She looked at the ice fire civet cat in astonishment and then smiled.

“One can not always look at the past. Since I’m alive, I have to do it for the sake of some beliefs in my heart. I hope you can forgive my selfishness!”

Zhang Fengying mumbled. She looked at the demonic beast bloodline and the Beastmaster’s inheritance in front of her and picked it up before walking into the room.

“Phew, it’s good that you accept it. The last thing I like is to owe someone a favor!”

Not far from the courtyard, Wang Xian looked at Zhang Fengying’s residence with a bewitching gaze. When he saw her entering the room with the tarsal bone demonic beast bloodline, a smile appeared on his face.

“Phew!”

All of a sudden, Wang Xian sucked in a breath of cold air. There was an inexplicable look in his eyes.

“Don’t look at me when I’m being rude. Don’t look at me when I’m being rude. I’m not such a person!”

Wang Xian shook his head quickly. His eyes were burning as he flew towards the Dragon Palace in the distance.
