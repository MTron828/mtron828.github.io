Chapter 398: Get Out Of Our Territory (2)

“Get out of our territory!”

An order resounded on the surface of the sea.

On a black ship, a young man carried a sharp blade in his hand and stared harshly at the approaching yacht.

The same words as that night? Their territory?

When Wang Xian heard him, he squinted his eyes.

The seas are just part of the territory of the dragon race. It doesn’t matter if it’s below or above the surface!

Wang Xian’s eyes shimmered.

Dreadful marine creatures were currently occupying the area below the surface of the sea. On the surface, strong and powerful ancient sects had occupied the area. The entire sea had been divided and controlled.

Wang Xian smirked. It appeared that he wouldn’t be just competing against creatures below the surface of the sea, but also had to compete with ancient sects above the surface.

He wouldn’t wish for someone pissing him off above his head.

The yacht continued cruising forward. He had sufficient time to toy with them. This time, Wang Xian wouldn’t just make a detour.

Huh?

When that young man saw the yacht not accelerating or turning around, he raised an eyebrow as his expression turned chilling.

“Seems like someone is courting death!”

At this point, a middle-aged man and the young man walked forward. Their gazes were fixed coldly on the approaching yacht.

They had already been restless previously. Now that they were seeing a yacht approaching them, their mood got worse.

The Yacht Club had alarmed some spiritual fish below the surface of the sea. Over the last two days, they hadn’t encountered a single one. Now that this yacht was disturbing the area, it would be harder for them to encounter one.

The middle-aged man and young man gradually drew their swords as they watched the yacht approaching.

Beside them, disciples from the Sacred Seas of Swords on the two ships were looking in the direction of the yacht, smirking with contempt.

“How dare you encroach into the territory of our Sacred Seas of Swords! You guys must be courting death!”

When the yacht was two thousand meters away from them, the young man shouted harshly. His voice reached Wang Xian and the group’s ears clearly.

“Continue ahead as plotted!” Wang Xian instructed Mo Qinglong.

“Yes, young master!”

The yacht remained on its original path.

“It appears that there are people who aren’t showing any regard for our Sacred Seas of Swords!”

“Kill them! Sink into the sea those who dare to encroach on the territory of the Sacred Seas of Swords,” the middle-aged man and the young man instructed emotionlessly.

In the sea, each ancient sect occupied a region. People from other forces could enter the region but were forbidden from capturing spiritual fish in the region and also forbidden from lingering for an extended period.

These were the rules of the sea and were established through strength.

Those who were stronger would occupy a bigger area. In other words, they would obtain greater resources.

Facing the yacht, the Sacred Seas of Swords wouldn’t back off at all.

This was their territory. In their territory, others should follow their orders. These were the rules of the jungle, the rules of the survival of the fittest.

Whoosh!

The young man saw the yacht passing by fifty meters away from them. He swung his sword lightly towards the sea.

In the direction where he pointed, the seawater coalesced rapidly into sharp blades.

In an instant, ten longswords made of seawater appeared before the young man.

The middle-aged man beside him did the same. As he waved his arm, seawater formed countless longswords and were sent piercing forward. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Insolent brats!” the young man snorted. The water swords flew towards the yacht at an astonishing speed.

“Who gives you the guts to be so brazen in the territory of our Sacred Seas of Swords. Are you really that eager to go to hell?”

On the two ships, the disciples of Sacred Seas of Swords saw Senior brother Ma and Attendant Yun strike as they looked towards the yacht with disdain.

Their actions were incomparably domineering.

Above the sea, the rule of survival of the fittest was greatly manifested.

“Interesting!”

Seeing them strike, Wang Xian showed a faint smile. “Let’s go and ask them about the sea.”

Wang Xian smiled. A huge wall of seawater was raised before the yacht as he waved his arm. It acted as a water shield and took the attacking water swords directly.

Subsequently, Wang Xian leaped into the air and flew towards the two ships.

Xiao Yu and Elder Fang were eager to give it a try. They jumped into the air and flew closely behind Wang Xian.

Guan Shuqing could only pout. Having not reached the Inborn Realm, she was still unable to fly in the air for short periods.

“What?”

“Flying in the air? They are Inborn experts!”

“This is bad! We have encountered experts! It’s no surprise that they ignored our warning!”

On the two ships of the Sacred Seas of Swords, the disciples were shocked and stunned to see Wang Xian raising a water wall with a single wave of his arm, and that he was flying towards them.

“That’s a young man! He’s so young and yet he has already reached the Inborn Realm!”

“There are still four beautiful ladies behind him! Oh gosh! All of them are flying in the air. Five Inborn experts!”

“These Inborn experts are so young. Which powerful sect are they from? How can they be so young?”

When the disciples of the Sacred Seas of Swords saw Xiao Yu and Elder Fang approaching them, their eyes widened and were filled with disbelief.

Senior Brother Ma and Attendant Yun could feel their eyelids twitching violently as they stared solemnly at Wang Xian and the group.

“We are the disciples of Sacred Seas of Swords. May I know what intentions you guys have?”

The middle-aged man and young man saw Wang Xian landing on their ship. Seeing the overly young looks of the group, they were in awe.

Wang Xian looked at the crowd of disciples of Sacred Seas of Swords with contempt and superiority.

“Explain to me the distribution of powers of the sea!”

Wang Xian’s eyes landed on the middle-aged man and young man and instructed them directly.

“YOU...”

When the young man saw how Wang Xian was looking down at them, and that he didn’t seem to have any regard for them, his expression sank.

“Speak!”

Wang Xian stared harshly at that young man.

Disciples of a Sacred Sect? Your territory? Everything has to be backed with the corresponding strength.

If you guys are the disciples of a Sacred Sect, I alone am the entire Sacred Sect!

Wang Xian had zero favorable opinions of the disciples of Sacred Seas of Swords who dared to attack him.

If you dare to look down on me, I’ll stand before you with absolute authority.

“We are the disciples of the Sacred Seas of Swords. This is the territory of our Sacred Seas of Swords!” That young man gritted his teeth, clenched his fist and spoke solemnly.

He emphasized the Sacred Seas of Swords once again. Clearly, he was trying to warn Wang Xian with the name of the Sacred Seas of Swords.

“Your territory? How hilarious? Do you know the consequences of attacking me?”

Wang Xian smirked, looked at the brazen and arrogant young man before him, and moved his arm.

Boom!

The seawater around them turned into a huge water snake and dived towards the young man.

“Don’t you dare! You will be making the entire Sacred Seas of Swords your enemy!”

The middle-aged man standing by the side chided loudly when he witnessed Wang Xian attack.

Hehe!

Wang Xian responded with a cold and mocking smile.

That water snake moved at astonishing speed towards the young man.

The young man’s expression changed radically. The longsword in his hand glowed in dense blue light as he swung towards the water snake!
