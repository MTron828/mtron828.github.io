Chapter 956: 0957, who was the prey?

Translator: 549690339

“There’s a ferocious beast!”

When the Golden Swordfish mentioned that there was a ferocious beast, father Zhou’s expression turned anxious instantly.

Jin Liuyan and Zhou Hanhan also stood up hurriedly.

“Oh?”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly. The ferocious beast was not discovered by the Golden Swordfish. Instead, it was told to the Golden Swordfish by the strange monsters who were hiding in the surroundings.

He stood up and looked ahead with a strange glint in his eyes.

As expected, two emperor crocodiles that were over ten meters in size were lying in front of him. Their eyes were extremely red. It was obvious that they were in a state of anger.

Once the carriage approached them, the two emperor crocodiles would definitely launch a fatal attack.

“There are marks on their heads. Hehe, they were left behind to deal with us, right?”

A hint of coldness flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes as the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

“But it’s perfect. I want to see this Emperor Croc as well!”

He stood up immediately and flew towards the two Emperor Crocs. He said, “Don’t worry, they are just two extraordinary level five Emperor Crocs!”

“There are ferocious beasts following behind the caravan?”

Father Zhou asked with a look of astonishment.

Jin Liuyan and Zhou Han stared at Wang Xian curiously.

To them, the level five extraordinary crocodile was simply a colossus. Their strength was definitely not weak in the East Ocean Academy.

With a cultivation of level three extraordinary, they could be considered as outstanding students.

However, they would definitely be swallowed by the crocodile in one gulp when they were faced with it.

They focused their attention on it. They wanted to see how strong Wang Xian was.

“Two extraordinary level five Imperial Crocs. They are a little weak!”

Wang Xian flew over and sized up the Imperial Crocs that were hiding in the swamp.

“Roar!”

When the two Imperial Crocs saw Wang Xian hovering ten meters above their heads, they immediately became ferocious and leaped up.

In the darkness, two terrifying monsters that were ten meters in size attacked Wang Xian who was in the sky.

This scene was extremely shocking to the surrounding people!

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly. The surrounding aquatic plants suddenly flew towards the two Imperial Crocs in a frenzy. With an even faster speed, they landed heavily on the ground.

“Boom! Boom!”

A dull sound was heard. Wang Xian moved slightly and stood on the two Imperial Crocs.

“Dragon’s might!”

Wang Xian stared at the two alligators coldly. A terrifying aura was emitted from his body.

“Submit!”

The intelligence of ferocious beasts was very low. Basically, they relied on their instincts to fight and hunt.

However, no matter how low their intelligence was, they still possessed the intelligence of a five-year-old child.

The powerful aura, along with Wang Xian’s terrifying dragon’s might, entered their minds directly.

The Imperial Croc was an aquatic creature.

“Roar! Roar!”

A series of low, fearful roars could be heard. They wriggled their huge bodies uneasily.

“Don’t move!”

Wang Xian said coldly.

When the two Imperial Crocs heard Wang Xian’s words, they didn’t dare to move recklessly. Their eyes were filled with fear.

“Listen to my orders. Otherwise, I will kill you immediately!”

Wang Xian stood in front of them. A strong killing intent surged from his body.

“Roar! Roar!”

The two Imperial Crocs quickly stuck their heads to the ground and placed their tails in the swamp.

“Get Up!”

Wang Xian asked them to prop up their limbs.

“Roar! Roar!”

The two Imperial Crocs got up obediently. They lowered their heads as if they were facing an Imperial Croc whose level was higher than theirs.

Wang Xian smiled in satisfaction.

Imperial Crocs were aquatic creatures. Although Wang Xian’s level was the same as the Imperial Croc and he could not control them directly, he could still threaten them.

It was just like how a high-level Imperial Croc commanded a low-level Imperial Croc.

“This...”

Father Zhou, Zhou Han, Jin Liuyan and the rest who saw this scene not far away widened their eyes.

Even though Jin Liuyan had witnessed Wang Xian’s terrifying strength, the scene before his eyes still shocked him.

Two gigantic ferocious beasts, which were at extraordinary level five, were tamed in less than a minute!

This... This was simply unbelievable!

“You... Captain Wang, you are also a Beast Tamer?”

Jin Liuyan and Zhou Hanhan walked over with sparkling eyes and asked in astonishment.

“Beast Tamer? I guess so!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly.

“Impressive, this is simply too impressive. Beast Tamers are an extremely rare profession. Moreover, even a powerful Beast Tamer would need one to two months to tame an extraordinary level five ferocious beast!”

Jin Liuyan widened her eyes and exclaimed in shock.

Father Zhou widened his eyes and walked over with a face full of shock and excitement.

“The caravan in front has stopped. Let’s stop and rest for a while!”

Wang Xian smiled and said to them.

“Alright, it’s up to captain Wang to make the decision!”

Father Zhou and the rest did not have any objections.

The ability to tame two extraordinary level five ferocious beasts in an instant could definitely allow them to enter Donghai city safely.

“Light a fire and eat something. We’ll have to take the night route. The night route is the most dangerous in the Blackwater Swamp!”

Father Zhou waved at the workers and said.

“Vice commander Ling, supervisor DU, elder Xiao, the people from the Zhou Chamber of Commerce behind us have also stopped. They’re more than three thousand meters away from us!”

At this moment, in front of them, a huge caravan stopped to rest. A member of the Spirit Beast mercenary group walked over and said in a low voice.

“Looks like that young man’s mercenary group isn’t simple. The two imperial crocodiles didn’t affect them at all!”

Supervisor du of the Green Vine Chamber of commerce frowned slightly and said in a low voice.

“Hehe, how extraordinary can it be? No matter how powerful they are, they can only deal with a transcendent level six powerhouse at most!”

Elder Xiao smiled faintly and didn’t seem to mind at all.

Holy Sea town wasn’t like East Sea city. There was a ranking list of mercenary groups and they had only stayed in holy sea town for two to three days. They didn’t know about the immortal Phoenix mercenary group.

However, even if they knew, they might not be afraid.

When Wang Xian destroyed the sword scar mercenary group, no one saw it. Most people thought that they used powerful weapons or formations to kill a transcendent level seven sword scar.

Vice-leader Ling of the Spirit Beast mercenary group also had a powerful weapon in his hands!

“Vice-leader Ling, I’ll leave the rest to you!”

Supervisor du thought for a moment and smiled as he looked at vice-leader ling.

“Don’t worry, leave it to me!”

Vice-leader ling smiled confidently. He swept his gaze around and waved at the dozen or so people beside him.

Among the fifteen people, two were at transcendent-level rank six while the rest were all at transcendent-level rank four or rank five.

“Let’s go and take all their money from the prey!”

Deputy Leader Ling raised his head slightly and said with a relaxed expression.

The members of the Spirit Beast mercenary group nodded with a smile. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

In the eyes of everyone in the Spirit Beast mercenary group, all the mercenary groups in Shenghai Town were trash.

If they wanted to make a move, the other party was just a small prey!

“Let’s Go!”

Deputy Leader Ling personally led a group of powerhouses and carefully avoided everyone’s gaze. They circled around from the side and after leaving everyone’s line of sight, they looked in the direction of Wang Xian and the rest. The corners of their lips curled up slightly.

“Let the hunt begin!”
