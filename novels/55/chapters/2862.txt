Chapter 2863: resplendent starry sky, Dragon King 4 of the Dragon Palace

“Die!”

A cold murderous aura emanated from the god-destroying wind emperor. He stared coldly at Wang Xian and the rest. With a wave of his arm, countless sharp swords attacked Hong Fengyan and the rest.

The wind swords did not attack Wang Xian because he wanted to capture him alive.

He wanted to find out the secret of him in the depths of the windless forest valley.

“Ah!”

In the surrounding area, tianxin covered her eyes and let out a cry of surprise.

“Master!”

When Ye lui Ying and the rest saw this desperate attack, their faces turned extremely pale.

Facing such an attack, they had no ability to resist.

Hong Fengyan’s eyes revealed an extremely grave expression.

“You’re courting death!”

Boom

Just as the wind swords were about to land on them, just as Hong Fengyan was putting up her defenses, a voice filled with rage rang out from nowhere.

On the right, two figures with pitch-black bodies and a terrifying aura were flying towards them.

The wind prison around Wang Xian and the rest, the wind swords that were attacking the invincible Hong Fengyan and the rest, trembled slightly and slowly collapsed.

“Eh?”

At this moment, the expression of the celestial emperor of wind destruction who was the first to react changed slightly. A look of vigilance appeared in his eyes as he immediately flew to the right.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Boom! Boom

At this moment, two black shadows flew towards them without any concealment. Their eyes were filled with violent killing intent.

“Two celestial emperors are here!”

“Hiss, what’s the situation?”

“Which faction are they from?”

When they saw the two terrifying figures flying over, everyone’s expression changed drastically. Their eyes were filled with horror.

“74 seconds!”

Wang Xian stood there and smiled as he looked at the figures flying over.

Behind him, Hong Fengyan’s eyes were wide open. There was a look of surprise on his face. His eyes were sparkling.

“This… boss Wang, this… who are they?”

Invincible battle technique looked at Wang Xian with his eyes wide open. His eyes were filled with excitement.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Two figures flew over and appeared in front of Wang Xian.

“Dragon King, we are too late!”

The next moment, a scene that left everyone dumbstruck and even shocked appeared.

The two figures looked at the young man who was about to be killed by the eight directions and immediately bowed and shouted.

Dragon King, are we too late?

Dragon King?

This sentence caused many people to be bewildered. However, the bodies of the experts from the eight directions, the Celestial Emperor of wind destruction and Hong Fengyan trembled as shock appeared in their eyes.

“It’s just right. It’s not too late!”

Wang Xian looked at the eight directions demonic fiend who had rushed over and revealed a smile.

“Dragon King, how did you get the injuries on your body? Which fellow did it? Are you courting death?”

“Dragon King, these are some divine pills that we obtained. Please heal your injuries First!”

The eight-limbed demonic fiend sensed Wang Xian’s weak body and hurriedly flew over to take out some medicinal pills.

Wang Xian looked at the divine pills that he handed over and revealed a look of surprise.

“Looks like the harvest is not bad!”

He picked up the divine pill of the first level of the Void Celestial Emperor and placed it into his mouth. It transformed into Dragon Qi to heal his injuries.

“Hehe, the harvest this time is not bad.”

Mo Sha laughed at the side. His gaze slowly swept across the surroundings as killing intent flickered in his eyes.

“Looks like someone wants to die!”

As he spoke, his gaze locked onto the body of the god of wind destruction.

The eight-pointed sword swept across all the strong disciples of the eight barrens and finally landed on the god of wind destruction.

Waves of unconcealed killing intent rushed towards them.

“Cough, cough.”

Sensing the cold killing intent from the eight-pointed sword and the demonic fiend, the god of wind destruction’s pupils contracted slightly. He coughed and his eyes were filled with shock.

“Dragon Palace? Dragon King?”

His gaze landed on Wang Xian and his expression changed as he asked.

“There are other dragon kings of the Dragon Palace in this starry sky?”

Wang Xian looked at god-destroying wind and asked with a calm expression.

“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace?”

Upon hearing these words, the invincible battle technique behind him was slightly confused. What was wrong with the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace?

He had long known that Wang Xian was the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.

However, he, who had just ended his seclusion for half a year, did not know what the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace represented in the starry sky.

It was the Dragon Palace, which was now known as the Third Force.

And the Dragon King was the leader of the Dragon Palace!

“What force is the Dragon Palace?”

Not only him, but some people around him didn’t have a deep impression of it.

They had isolated the two regions, and there was no communication between them.

Other than the experts of some forces, there were still many people who didn’t know about the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King.

Especially people like tianxin.

“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, I didn’t expect him to be the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. How is this possible? Isn’t the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace at the Divine Emperor Level? The Dragon Palace is one of the top three forces in the starry sky. How can it be so young?”

“Hiss, the Dragon Palace that defeated the Imperial Court and the Wizard Association? The Dragon Palace that controls the imperial star field? The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is here, and… and it’s this young man.”

“No Wonder, no wonder he was so calm and didn’t change his expression when facing God emperor wind destruction. So he’s the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace! Even though he was heavily injured, he didn’t put God Emperor wind destruction in his eyes.”

However, at this moment, shocked voices came from the surroundings. Their bodies trembled and their eyes widened.

Some people didn’t know the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, but there were also many who knew him. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Especially during the Battle of the rise of the Dragon Palace five years ago, everyone who received this news was shocked.

In that battle, the Dragon Palace pursued the other party for hundreds of millions of miles without being defeated.

After that battle, Bhang, who was ranked third, was now ranked fourth.

The leader of such a force was actually the young man in front of them.

The young man who was ridiculed by some people just now and was thought to be about to be destroyed.

The young man who was said to be acting cool…

Now, they couldn’t help but swallow a mouthful of saliva.

“This… this… F * ck!”

When invincible heard the exclamations from the surroundings, he couldn’t help but widen his eyes and jump up. He stared at Wang Xian who was in front of him.

Ye Lui Ying and the rest of her senior martial siblings were also dumbfounded. They were completely dumbfounded.

The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace was someone who was even more honorable than the domain lord of their holy region.

It was no exaggeration to say that the Dragon Palace could destroy their holy region.

However, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace was right in front of them, and they had been playing with him for months.

At this moment, even Hong Fengyan’s eyes were wide open.

As for Tianxin and the others, they were even more stunned.

“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!”

Behind them, the expressions of the eight barren guardian elders and disciples changed drastically, and a trace of cold sweat appeared on their foreheads.

They actually wanted to deal with the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.

“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, there should be a misunderstanding between us. On behalf of the eight barrens, I apologize to you on behalf of the Disciples!”

The expression of the god-emperor of wind destruction changed. He cupped his hands towards Wang Xian and forced a smile on his face.

As the god-emperor of the eight barrens, he naturally knew a little about the strength of the Dragon Palace.

Overall, the Dragon Palace should be stronger than them.

He knew that they had made a mistake in this matter. Next, they would have to pay a price to make amends.

“Buzz!”

However, the sky suddenly changed!
