Chapter 904: 0905 Phoenix immortal crisis

Translator: 549690339

An old man and a one-armed, one-eyed old man.

The old man looked extremely ugly. There was a long scar on his face. The scar was three to four centimeters deep. That Eye was directly blinded by this attack.

Even if such an old man had a smile on his face, he still looked extremely ferocious. The murderous aura on his body could not be hidden at all.

“Dao Hen!”

Shopkeeper Liu’s expression changed slightly, and he shouted at the one-eyed old man involuntarily.

“Commander Dao Hen!”

The middle-aged commander of the sand sea mercenary group at the side also had a slight change in expression, and he shouted at the old man.

Dao Hen was a very strange name. No one would choose this name.

In fact, the old man was not called Dao Hen in the past.

However, when he was middle-aged, which was a hundred years ago, he was only the commander of a bronze mercenary group.

Later, when he was on a mission in the wild, he was ambushed by another mercenary group and was almost killed by a slash.

However, he was lucky enough to escape death.

Since then, he let others call him Dao Hen. Two years later, he killed the mercenary group that ambushed them.

Ever since that narrow escape, Dao Hen began to rise. He even used 100 years to establish Dao Hen mercenary group.

The number one mercenary group in Holy Sea Town, the leader of a five-star gold mercenary group.

A rank 7 transcendent.

Dao Hen’s strength and influence in holy sea town could be ranked in the top three.

He didn’t have any enemies in holy sea town, because those who provoked him were already dead.

Dao Hen was a legend in holy sea town, and no one dared to provoke him.

“Hehe, how is it? Commander Sand Sea?”

Dao Hen looked at the shocked expressions of the people around him and ignored them. He looked at Commander Sha Hai with one eye and said with a faint smile.

However, in Sha Hai’s eyes, Dao Hen’s smile and eyes seemed to be full of warning.

This made his forehead break out in a cold sweat.

Dao Hen’s name was not something that a five-star silver mercenary group like him could provoke.

“But... But...”

Commander Sha Hai stuttered as he looked at shopkeeper Liu.

Shopkeeper Liu saw Dao Hen’s invisible threat and his expression was extremely ugly. “Dao Hen, the Sha Hai mercenary group is our partner. Do you wish to withdraw your threat?”

“Threat? Did I threaten Commander Sha Hai? Haha, Shopkeeper Liu, you can’t speak carelessly!”

Dao Hen turned to shopkeeper Liu in surprise and said with a smile.

Shopkeeper Liu looked at Dao Hen’s expression and his face darkened. “Dao Hen, are you going to interfere in our matters with the life and Death Pill Workshop?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“I’m not involved. I’m just asking Commander Sha Hai to give face. Why? Are you going to interfere with this, shopkeeper Liu?”

Dao Hen’s gaze was somewhat cold as he stared at shopkeeper Liu.

When he was cold, he looked even more terrifying, as if he was going to attack at any time.

“Hehe, Dao Hen, you and I are not young. We all know what you mean!”

Manager Liu said coldly with a dark face.

Speaking of which, he was really not afraid of Dao Hen.

Even if he was the commander of the strongest mercenary group in Holy Sea Town, everyone feared Dao Hen.

However, he had the support of the Immortal Phoenix Pill and weapons workshop. The power behind him was not something that a five-star gold mercenary group could provoke.

Even with the power of the risk pill and weapons workshop, destroying knife scar was like squashing an ant.

Of course, with the power of Holy Sea town’s immortal Phoenix Pill and weapons workshop, it was much weaker than knife scar.

However, this title was enough.

“Shopkeeper Liu, Commander Dao Hen is a friend of our life and Death Pill Workshop. Why? Do you want to suppress our friend? Do you think we are afraid of You?”

At this time, the woman next to him said with a smile on her face.

Shopkeeper Liu’s face darkened and he didn’t say anything.

Commander Sha Hai, who was sandwiched in the middle, looked even more embarrassed. In this place, their strength was the weakest. If they offended one of them, they would have no place in holy sea town in the future.

“Manager Liu, I don’t need you to lecture me. Since you say that I’m threatening, then threaten me!”

Manager Liu, who was at the side, smiled darkly.

“It seems that Commander Dao Hen is going to completely make things difficult for us, Phoenix Immortal!”

Manager Liu narrowed his eyes and said to Dao Hen.

“Old Thing, you only have the strength of a transcendent fourth rank, yet you dare to talk to me like this. Do you really think that I have to respect you just because you have the backing of the Phoenix Immortal Pill and weapons workshop? A threat? I’ll show you what a threat is today!”

Dao Hen’s face suddenly became ferocious. He looked at the Immortal Phoenix Pill and weapons workshop with one eye and said coldly, “Everyone from the Immortal Phoenix Pill and weapons workshop, get out here. In the future, you’d better not let me see you step into it again!”

Suddenly, Dao Hen shouted directly into the immortal Phoenix Pill and weapons workshop. His cold voice spread across the surrounding streets.

“Eh?”

All the people in the shop were slightly shocked, and their faces showed astonishment.

However, when they saw dao hen outside, their faces changed, and they walked out in surprise.

“Dao Hen, do you know what you are doing?”

Shopkeeper Liu saw dao hen directly threatening the customers in the shop, and his face changed greatly. He stared at Dao Hen and asked.

“Do you want me to repeat it again? In the future, don’t let me see anyone enter the Immortal Phoenix Pill and Weapons Workshop!”

Dao Hen coldly pointed at the shop’s signboard and said with a smile.

Everyone who had just walked out looked at it in shock.

Dao Hen actually dared to go against the Immortal Phoenix Pill and weapons workshop?

“What’s going on? What Happened?”

“Why did Dao Hen have a conflict with the immortal Phoenix Pill and Weapons Workshop?”

“Although the Immortal Phoenix Pill and Weapons Workshop’s strength is not as good as Dao Hen’s, this is still a huge pill and weapons shop after all. The power behind it is extremely terrifying. Why would dao hen provoke it so recklessly?”

Some of the martial artists who passed by were shocked as they stood around and watched.

“Did you hear that?”

Dao Hen’s face was full of smiles as he slowly spat out two words!

“I... I heard it!”

When the customers who walked out saw Dao hen’s expression, their expressions changed slightly.

In Saint Sea Town, they could choose not to come to the immortal Phoenix Pill and weapons workshop, but they absolutely could not provoke Dao Hen!

“Haha, I also don’t recommend that everyone go to the Immortal Phoenix Pill and weapons workshop to buy things. If you want to buy weapons and pills, you can go to the life and Death Pill formula and the Holy Item Weapon Workshop!”

At this moment, a loud laughter was heard.

Everyone quickly looked over and saw a middle-aged man and an old man leading a group of people over.

“That is? The shopkeeper of the holy item forging workshop and the leader of the Mirage Sea mercenary group!”

“Look, shopkeeper Qing of the life and Death Pill Workshop is also here. Could it be that this is a game between the three major forces?”

When the surrounding people saw the people from the biological forging workshop arrive, their expressions changed slightly as they whispered their suspicions.

Shopkeeper Liu’s expression also changed drastically as his eyes flickered with a luster.

This was a premeditated counter-attack, a game between the three great forces.

However, it was clear that their Phoenix Immortal Pill and weapons workshop had been targeted.

This caused his heart to sink.

No Wonder Dao Hen dared to go against them.
