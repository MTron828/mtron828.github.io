Chapter 2980: Becoming a Dragon Knight in 1980? 6

“Four-armed race, the Dragon Palace and the Divine Dragon belong to us!”

“Hahaha, it belongs to you? Then you have the right to take it away from us?”

Yang Xiaohun led four wolf beasts and followed the experts of bhang and rushed toward the Dragon Palace.

The four-armed race also rushed toward the Dragon Palace from the side.

“Splash!”

They brought with them a powerful force, and the seawater automatically separated to reveal the appearance of a Dragon Palace.

“Boom!”

They didn’t hesitate at all and directly attacked the place below.

“Bang!”

The level of the Dragon Palace on the nine destruction planet wasn’t very high to begin with, so it couldn’t resist the attack of a divine emperor.

The powerful force immediately broke open many holes in the Dragon Palace.

They did not fight, but went into the dragon palace directly to check out the situation inside.

“The concentration of spiritual energy inside is very high!”

“This is only a sub-base of the Dragon Palace. There are very few members of the Dragon Palace!”

They entered the Dragon Palace and immediately looked around.

However, they soon searched the entire Dragon Palace. Apart from feeling that the dragon palace was filled with all kinds of divine dragon buildings, they didn’t find anything special.

What they didn’t know was that the Dragon Palace, whether it was the dragon field or the Dragon Cave, was only useful to the members of the Dragon Palace.

It was useless to intruders who didn’t have the bloodline of the Divine Dragon.

“What a rich bloodline power!”

“The members of the Dragon Palace, just the bloodline power alone contains a huge amount of energy!”

In the air above the Dragon Palace, Yang Feng looked at the dozens of corpses in front of him, his eyes flashing with excitement.

He waved his arm and licked it, his eyes burning with excitement.

“This blood has a high possibility of improving the bloodlines of other desolate beasts and Fey beasts. They are definitely higher than ordinary quasi-dragon bloodlines!”

He thought to himself.

“Looks like the members of the Dragon Palace are also treasures!”

At this moment, a voice sounded, causing Yang Feng’s expression to sink. He coldly looked up at the four-armed race’s deacon.

If not for the four-armed race’s fellows, these treasures would all belong to them.

Now, not only would the four-armed race fight for a portion, their race would also occupy a large portion.

In the end, very few would fall into their own hands!

Boom! Boom! Boom

At this moment, a rumbling sound came from below.

“Deacon, we didn’t find any treasures inside!”

The Majestic Dragon Palace slowly collapsed, and the four-armed race was the first to fly out and report.

The Dragon Palace on the nine destruction planet was low-level and didn’t have a large area, so they checked it out very quickly.

They did not find any treasures inside.

This made them look bad.

“After all, it’s just a small sub-base. It’s normal for there to be no treasures. You Go to the headquarters of the Dragon Palace.”

Deacon Qian of the four-armed race immediately ordered.

“Yes, Deacon!”

Everyone nodded and looked at the creator.

“I’ve blocked the information on the AI through special means. If the Dragon Palace doesn’t have any other special means of communication, they won’t be able to sense the situation here for more than ten days.”

The creator said to them and then looked at the nine destruction planet below. “I’ll lead the way!”

“Let’s Go!”

The four-armed race immediately followed and flew toward the teleportation array on the nine destruction planet.

“We’ll go too!”

Yang Xiaohun looked over and said to the eight barrens. They also flew toward the teleportation array below.

“Hehe, friends of the three-eyed race, let’s wait here!”

Deacon Qian of the four-armed race stared at Yang Feng and said with a smile.

The overall strength of the four-armed race was stronger than the three-eyed race. If they were to fight for some treasures, he was confident that the four-armed race would get more.

As long as he could restrain Yang Feng, it would be fine.

“HMPH!”

Yang Feng snorted coldly and floated in the air without moving.

He knew that the other party wouldn’t let him take action, and he wasn’t prepared to take action either.

The time to truly divide the benefits hadn’t arrived yet. They had to wait for the experts of their race to arrive.

At that time, it would be the time to divide the resources.

“The natives here? Participating in the matters of our universe’s central race requires a price.”

“I advise all of you to SCRAM!”

At the location of the teleportation array on the nine-annihilated planet, the four-armed race, Yang Xiaohun, and the others landed in front of the teleportation array.

A Level 4 divine emperor expert from the four-armed race swept his cold gaze across the desolate divine emperor and the others and warned them.

“Haha, they are people from our three-eyed race. Our three-eyed race will protect them.”

Yang Xiaohun laughed loudly and said coldly.

“Let’s Go!”

After he said that, he waved to the people behind him and entered the teleportation array.

“Let’s Go!”

The four-armed race warriors immediately ordered and stepped into the teleportation array.

Soon, their figures disappeared into the teleportation array.

“Hiss, they are the warriors from the center of the universe. They are the warriors from the other side of the Universe!”

“There are actually powerhouses from the center of the universe coming, they are too strong, their target seems to be the Dragon Palace!”

“Now the Dragon Palace is going to be finished, the Dragon Palace is going to meet a disaster, the powerhouses from the center of the universe, their strength is too terrifying!”

The surroundings of the teleportation array were abnormally bustling, the group left through the teleportation array.

Everyone around heard their conversation and saw their faces clearly.

Three eyes!

Four arms!

Just this strange appearance alone made them feel fear.

Seeing them leave, everyone became excited.

Some people looked at the two experts in the void and were even more shocked.

One by one, news spread crazily on the AI.

However, some people soon realized that the information they sent out was immediately covered by all kinds of irrelevant information.

This made them extremely astonished.

Even so, the news from the nine obliteration planet was still spreading crazily in the eight barrens and six directions.

Especially when the four-armed race and the three-eyed race, Yang Xiaohun, led the experts from the eight barrens out of the teleportation formation one after another, it caused a huge sensation.

The news of the arrival of the universe’s experts spread throughout the eight barrens and six directions. Countless experts were shocked.

“Eh?”

However, at this very moment, Wang Xian was sitting on the dragon throne. In front of him, all the leaders of the Dragon Palace were gathered.

Wang Xian sat on the throne with a frown. His eyes were sparkling.

When the Dragon Palace on the nine annihilation planet was destroyed, Wang Xian immediately received a system notification.

Following that, he discovered that the members of the Dragon Palace who were guarding the Dragon Palace were also killed.

Among them was a rank one divine emperor.

Who would dare to destroy the Dragon Palace and kill its experts in the starry sky?Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎
