Chapter 1152: 1153 was furious

Translator: 5496903

More than two billion middle-grade spirit stones. Even an ordinary transcendent ninth-level family would not be able to afford it.

However, this two billion middle-grade spirit stones was a drop in the bucket for Wang Xian. If he wanted to raise his level now, he would need more than 100 billion middle-grade spirit stones.

However, Wang Xian was not worried. As long as the dragon spike covered the entire star-moon kingdom, he should be able to obtain more than 100 billion middle-grade spirit stones.

When that time came, he should be able to fight against an insightful void martial artist once his level was elevated to extraordinary level eight.

“You still have to pay attention to the spies. The undercurrent assassin organization will definitely not give up easily. Moreover, the leader of the undercurrent has yet to appear. You have to be careful!”

Wang Xian reminded the DRAKONID.

“It’s the Dragon King. With the presence of the Lords of the strange demon, there won’t be any problems!”

The drakonid smiled and retreated.

“I still can’t be careless!”

Wang Xian mumbled. He looked at all the information about the undercurrent assassin organization that Feng Luan had obtained. He looked at the middle-aged man with long hair.

This middle-aged man was a madman who killed people like a weed.

The murder of his own family members had already driven him crazy. After the death of his second son, it had caused him to wipe out an aristocratic family of insightful emptiness realm experts.

This young master Ying was his third son. Now that he had died in his hands, with that Madman’s character, he would definitely not let this matter rest!

“However, this time, i, the dragon Spike, am not afraid of You!”

Wang Xian’s face revealed a cold expression. He would take whatever came his way. He was not afraid of an expert at the first level of the insightful emptiness realm. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Dusk arrived again. At this moment, at the entrance of the Mayor’s residence, the leader of the city guards was following behind a middle-aged man with long hair with a respectful expression.

He was a transcendent level 9 powerhouse, and he even followed by the side like a slave.

The long-haired middle-aged man’s face could not be seen, and his entire body was extremely cold.

“It’s already arranged, right?”

The middle-aged man ignored the city guard leader and asked the white-clothed elder with a broken arm beside him coldly.

“Leader, it’s already prepared. The spy for the dragon Spike has already sent our people to pay the Commission!”

The old man in white hurriedly replied.

“Okay, I will go there myself!”

The long-haired middle-aged man nodded, and the old man in white hurriedly led the way.

The leader of the city guards behind wiped the cold sweat off his face and looked at his figure with some fear.

In the evening, it was time for the spy of the Dragon Spike to collect the commission.

At this time, it was the busiest time of the day in Bright Moon City. The members of the mercenary group who had returned and the workers who had finished the day’s work.

“It’s been two days, and undercurrent hasn’t made any reaction. Could it be that undercurrent has given up?”

“It’s really possible. It seems that the dragon Spike will become the King of the assassin world in the future. Undercurrent can’t do it anymore!”

On the street, many people were talking about the two major assassin organizations.

The long-haired middle-aged man stood there and listened to the discussions of the people around him. His eyes flickered with killing intent.

He had two big taboos. One was his family. If anyone dared to kill his family, he would definitely kill his entire family.

The second was the undercurrent assassin organization. The undercurrent assassin organization was his life’s work. If anyone dared to say that it was an undercurrent, it would be a slap to his face.

He looked at the people who were talking, and his eyes flashed with a cold light.

“Leader, it’s appeared. The hidden line of the dragon Spike has appeared. Yesterday, I sent Shisan to follow that hidden line. Shisan disappeared directly. There should be someone protecting the hidden line of the dragon Spike!”

The voice of the old man in white rang out at this moment, causing the long-haired middle-aged man to narrow his eyes slightly and look forward.

His gaze locked onto an old man. His gaze swept the surroundings, and he frowned slightly.

The long-haired middle-aged man followed the spy of the dragon spike.

The spy did not sense that someone was following him, and it was even more unexpected that the person following him was an expert at the profound void tier.

He had to hand over the deposit that he had received according to the route to the DRAKONIDS.

Ten drakonids were responsible for a specific location.

The drakonids that he was handing over to were not very far away from him. In fact, they were only separated by two streets.

The spy calmly walked towards the location where he was handing over to, with the long-haired middle-aged man following behind him.

Suddenly, a glint flashed across the long-haired middle-aged man’s eyes. He slightly swept his gaze towards a rooftop in front of the left, his eyes flashing with a luster.

“Is this the assassin of the dragon spike? A race of Demon Beasts. It Won’t be long before I exterminate all of You Damned Demon Beasts!”

He muttered, his eyes revealing a cold expression. He followed the dark thread and walked forward.

The strange demon hiding in the sky didn’t find the long-haired middle-aged man following them.

The long-haired middle-aged man was the master of Undercurrent, a cave-level assassin. They were following them, and it wasn’t something a level eight extraordinary strange demon could find.

After walking for about a thousand meters, the spy and the DRAKONID began to meet.

“Sir, the Commission has been safely received!”

The old man walked to the drakonid, smiled, and handed a cloth bag to the drakonid.

“Good, very good!”

The DRAKONID smiled. “Continue to collect the Commission!”

“Yes...”

“I don’t think there’s a need. If you dare to make an enemy out of undercurrent, all of you will die!”

Suddenly, a voice sounded beside their ears.

The old man’s expression froze, and the DRAKONID’s face was filled with shock.

A figure dressed in blue with red stripes and blood-red eyes was coldly staring at them.

“Peng!”

The Master of undercurrent waved his arm, and the old man’s body directly exploded, turning into a cloud of blood mist.

“Dragon Spike, Haha, You Dare to kill my son and go against the undercurrent. I will let you know the consequences of offending me.”

A cold voice suddenly sounded on the street. It was extremely loud and spread over a dozen kilometers.

The sudden attack and the cold and ear-piercing voice caused everyone around to reveal shocked expressions.

When everyone turned around to look, they revealed shocked expressions.

There, a blood mist slowly fell towards the ground. Clearly, a person had been killed by the terrifying attack.

A young man was controlled by the long-haired middle-aged man. His eyes were wide open as he looked at the long-haired middle-aged man in shock.

“What... What’s going on? That long-haired middle-aged man, he’s... He’s the master of Undercurrent!”

A middle-aged man looked at the master of undercurrent who had slightly raised his head and revealed his blood-red eyes in shock. His eyes were filled with shock!

“Today is just the beginning!”

Under the gaze of thousands of people, the master of undercurrent controlled the body of the DRAKONID with one hand. His body moved, and he flew into the sky, attacking the strange monster.

The Strange Monster, who had been hiding in the surroundings, revealed a terrified expression. Its expression changed drastically, and it hurriedly fled into the distance.

“Assassin of the Dragon Spike, Damned Beast, you still want to escape?”

The master of undercurrent shouted softly and stretched out his arm. A stream of blood-red water flowed directly towards the strange monster.

The Strange Monster’s expression changed drastically. It immediately used its void divine ability and once again fled into the distance.

“HM?”

The eyes of the master of undercurrent narrowed slightly, and an angry expression appeared on his face. “Die!”

The terrifying blood-red water flowed once again, and despair appeared in the strange monster’s eyes. Its figure flashed and appeared.

The strange demon was exposed to everyone for the first time!
