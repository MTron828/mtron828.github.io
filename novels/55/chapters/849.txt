Translator: 549690339

“Ahhhhh!”

“Save me, save me!”

Everything happened in just three seconds. The flames burned brighter and brighter. Half of Philomena’s body was charred black. A terrified expression appeared on her face as she screamed out loud.

The Highgod of the Nordic region, the god of thunder and the god of the Earth were flapping the flames on their bodies with terrified expressions.

The twenty immortals stared at Wang Xian vigilantly.

In the short exchange of blows, the Dragon King only released three flames. In the end, Philomena’s entire body was burned, and the two highgod clones were covered by the flames.

“AH, the flames are on my body!”

At this moment, Yu Wenhua’s terrified voice rang out. When he was flapping Philomena’s flames, some of the flames were on his body, and his arms were burning.

No matter what, the flames would never be extinguished.

Even if a superior immortal God made a move, it was still useless.

What happened at this moment actually made all the human immortals and gods around swallow a mouthful of saliva.

The people from the Yu Wen clan and the Nordic divine territory stared at Wang Xian in horror. No one dared to attack again.

“Divine ability, this is a divine ability!”

A surprised voice came from the Xuan Yuan clan’s Supreme Elder.

He stared with wide eyes at the four immortals who had been burned by the flames, and his expression changed drastically.

Divine ability.

Immortals cultivated battle techniques. If they wanted to increase their strength again, there was only one way, which was to condense the battle technique into a divine ability.

All the immortals knew this, but it was extremely difficult to condense a divine ability, and many high-level immortals were unable to find a way.

“The flame breath is indestructible!”

“Ah!”

The supreme elder of the Yuwen clan had an extremely unsightly expression as he shouted loudly. He gritted his teeth and waved the ancient fan in his hand, directly cutting off Yuwen Hua’s arm.

The arm fell to the ground, and the flames continued to burn.

“Save me, save me!”

Philomena was completely flustered. Her face was extremely pale, and more than half of her body had been burned.

If not for the dense water energy surrounding her to suppress the flames, she would probably have died.

Beside her, the two highgods of the Nordic domain were rolling on the ground, their eyes filled with fear.

“Dragon King, extinguish the flames on Philomena’s body. Are you really going to fall into a situation where you will fight to the death with our Yuwen clan and the Nordic Domain?”

Cold sweat appeared on the forehead of the grand elder of the Yuwen clan. He growled at Wang Xian in a low voice with an embarrassed expression.

“The wedding turned into a funeral. It’s pretty good!”

Wang Xian looked at this scene indifferently with a smile on his face.

This was the first time he had unleashed the endless sight. He was a little dissatisfied with the effect.

The Flames unleashed by an extraordinary level one could not extinguish it in an instant. This endless sight felt a little weak!

However, the ability of not being able to see clearly and not being able to see clearly was fully displayed. It was indestructible!

“Dragon King, if you dare to kill Princess Philomena and the god of Thunder Mountain and Earth in our divine territory, our god King will not let you off!”

A God from the Nordic divine territory stared at Wang Xian and shouted loudly with his eyes that were about to crack.

“Do you know that I hate threats the most?”

Wang Xian turned his head to look at the God and said with a twinkle in his eyes.

The middle-aged God’s expression changed drastically. He was afraid that a flame would shoot out from Wang Xian’s eyes and burn him directly.

“Dragon King, if you can stop now, our Yuwen clan would like to apologize to you!”

The supreme elder of the Yuwen clan stared at Wang Xian with a face full of fear and said with an embarrassed expression.

No one had expected that the Dragon King would be so powerful.

Just the two flames shot out from his eyes could destroy two highgods.

Who would dare to go up against such terrifying flames.

Even if this was the territory of the Yuwen clan, even if there were more than twenty gods in the Nordic divine territory, no one dared to go up.

It was too terrifying!

One person smiled as he looked at the forty to fifty gods. Yet, the other party did not dare to attack. Instead, he was apologizing respectfully! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

It was so terrifying.

The eyes of the surrounding immortals, who had secretly thought that the Dragon King would admit defeat, were filled with shock.

Even the western gods looked at this scene with embarrassed expressions, especially the Mad God of the Garden of Eden’s divine realm and the young divine son and goddess of the Roman divine realm.

They had gloated and even looked excited. Their expressions had completely disappeared.

“Apologize? Do I need an apology from the Yuwen clan? It’s Too Late!”

Wang Xian watched the scene indifferently. There was no expression on his face.

When the supreme elder of the Yuwen clan heard Wang Xian’s rejection, his face was extremely gloomy. He clenched his fists and gritted his teeth. “Dragon King, what do you have to do to extinguish the flames?”

“Anyone who offends our Dragon King will die!”

Wang Xian did not speak. Ao Jian, who was at the side, spoke coldly like a sharp sword that had been unsheathed.

After he finished speaking, the faces of all the immortals and deities of the Yuwen clan and the Nordic celestial domain changed drastically.

“No, no, I beg you, Dragon King. It’s my fault. Please let me go!”

Dressed in a bride’s gift, the extremely beautiful philomena revealed a look of despair on her face. She was in immense pain and most of her body was burnt black. She looked extremely pathetic.

She was no longer as beautiful and prideful as before, nor did she have the disdain and ridicule in front of Wang Xian.

She knelt on the ground. The Immortals and gods around her came to her rescue, but none of them dared to go forward.

Yu Wenhua’s arm was covered in flames. He could only cut off his own arm.

The two highgods were covered in flames and were screaming in agony.

“I came to attend your wedding, but you didn’t give me any face. You even said that you have the ability and qualifications. Unfortunately, you don’t have the ability and qualifications!”

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian said indifferently and turned around to walk out.

However, when he saw a glass of wine on the table, he paused.

“The last toast is to the Yellow Earth and death. This toast is to all of you!”

Wang Xian picked up the wine glass and threw it behind him gently.

The wine glass formed a line and landed in front of Philomena and the two highgods.

Cheers to all of you!

“Boom!”

The Yuwen clan and the gods from the Nordic Celestial Domain revealed furious expressions. A terrifying aura shot up into the sky.

The aura of the forty to fifty gods caused the entire world to change drastically. Even the movement techniques under their feet were slowly cracking.

However, Wang Xian did not bother with them. He slowly paced and flew into the distance at an average speed.

Xiao Yu, Feng Lingtian, Ling Xiao, and the rest followed closely behind.

They left in a carefree manner.

From the beginning to the end, the immortals from the Yuwen clan and the Nordic celestial domain did not dare to make a move.

The people from the western celestial domain did not dare to make a move either. Two Flames had killed two highgods. Who would still dare to make a move?

“Ah, ah, ah, no, no, I was wrong. Please, let me go. Give me a Chance!”

Philomena’s screams continued to ring out, causing the Yuwen clan and the gods of the Scandinavian God’s domain to have extremely unsightly expressions.

No matter what method they used, they could not extinguish the wisps of flames that were not very lush.

They could only watch as Philomena was burned to ashes.

They watched as the two gods stopped screaming and lay there motionless.

This was truly a wedding turning into a funeral!
