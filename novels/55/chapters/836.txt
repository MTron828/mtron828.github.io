“Sister Feng Luan, are you going back?”

At the huge dining table in the dragon bedroom, Guan Shuqing asked Feng Luan in surprise.

“I’ll go back when I reach the transcendent realm!”

Feng Luan nodded, and a cold look flashed in her eyes. “That’s my world. I have some things to deal with!”

Guan Shuqing looked at her expression and pursed her lips. She knew what was going on.

There was only one empress who appeared in the history of time. Her talent and strength were definitely unparalleled in the history of time.

However, such an empress was betrayed and only a drop of her blood essence escaped. If Wang Xian didn’t accidentally obtain the Vermillion Bird’s blood essence and if he didn’t activate the Vermillion Bird’s blood essence with his divine dragon bloodline, she wouldn’t be able to revive, she would be completely destroyed in the future.

She wanted to take revenge on these enemies. She wanted to take back everything that belonged to her.

“When you return, it might not be the world you were in in the past!”

Wang Xian looked at Feng Luan and said slowly.

As she sat there, she naturally exuded a sense of nobility. This kind of nobility was something that even a Jiaya could not compare to. It was possible that she was only missing a crown.

Feng Luan was slightly silent and did not speak.

She did not know how long she had been dead for, whether it was a hundred years, a thousand years, or even 10,000 years. It was possible that the empire back then had already fallen. It was also possible that the enemy back then had already died.

“It might not be long before I go to the transcendence continent. Do you want to go there together after a period of time?”

Wang Xian continued to speak to Feng Luan.

On Earth, even if Wang Xian devoured all the aquatic creatures, it would only allow him to stay in the supernatural realm. He had to enter a higher world.

He thought that he had to cross the Void to search for a higher world. However, there was a path now. He would enter a stronger world from this path.

Long Xiao was in the universe. Earth was only his first step. He had to go out eventually.

Feng Luan shook her head slowly. “What I’m about to do is too dangerous. You’re still too weak!”

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian laughed when he heard her words. A strong sense of confidence appeared on his face. He stared at the Empress with a burning gaze. “Do you know how long it took me to reach this step from an ordinary person?”

“Three years, less than three years!”

“Do you know about Qingyue’s talent? Do you know Lingxiu’s talent? The current you is inferior to them!”

Feng Luan frowned and looked at Lan Qingyue and Sun Lingxiu. Wang Xian’s words made a dignified empress unhappy.

However, she could feel a mysterious power from Lan Qingyue’s body. This power was still very weak now, but it would be extremely terrifying in the future.

There was also Sun Lingxiu. That dense light energy was as holy as a god.

She had to admit that this guy’s two women had even greater potential than her in the future.

Not to mention this guy opposite her.

There was a dragon race on the transcendental continent. She didn’t know much about that dragon race, but she also knew that they were the top existences on the continent.

“At the very least, you guys still can’t keep up with my pace!”

The Empress said with some dissatisfaction.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian smiled and didn’t say anything else.

“Sister Feng Luan, why don’t we go to your world together in the future?”

Guan Shuqing also suggested.

Feng Luan hesitated for a moment, but she still shook her head. “I want to go there. There are many things that I need to deal with!”

Seeing Feng Luan refuse again, Guan Shuqing and the others had no choice.

In the following period of time, the group went to the Dragon Palace to play and cultivate.

After the Dragon Palace became fifty kilometers long, it became even more beautiful and glorious. A few beautiful girls played with some aquatic creatures and went to the floating island to play. Every day, they were extremely happy.

During this period of time, Tang Yinxuan’s strength had broken through to the immortal God realm. Her cultivation method was a little strange. Her water attribute and sound waves were stronger in support, but weaker in battle.

Furthermore, Tang Yinxuan had a group of dolphin companions in the Dragon Palace.

These dolphins had yet to officially join the Dragon Palace and had been cultivating in the Dragon Palace.

Wang Xian had passed the water dragon transformation technique to them.

In the Dragon Palace, these dolphins cultivated very quickly. In just over a year’s time, more than a dozen of them had broken through to the infant stage while the rest were at the Dan stage.

Similar to Tang Yinxuan’s characteristics, these dolphins’attacks were very weak, and their defensive support energy was quite abnormal.

After killing the eight gods of the Garden of Eden, the previous negotiations also collapsed, but the other side did not take any revenge.

Their strength did not dare to take revenge either.

During this period of time, Ao Qitian had been on a crusade in all directions. Very quickly, the entire sea area around the sub-continent was ruled.

The sea area in the eastern hemisphere of the Earth was all within the Dragon Palace.

The number of Immortals and deities in the Dragon Palace had also directly reached 52!

A year had passed, and the entire world was calm and tranquil.

The divine realm and the immortal sects had more frequent contact. Even the World Network had been opened up, and the warriors of the entire world could communicate in it.

At present, there were more than 200 million cultivators in the world, with more than 100 million warriors in the west.

The Eastern Immortal sect was like an immortal, High and mighty.

The western divine realm was like a god, looking down on all living things.

However, this world was still a technological society. It was just that the rules were gradually set by the immortals.

Boom! Boom! Boom

A year later, in the morning, a terrifying pressure filled the entire dragon palace.

All the members of the Dragon Palace instantly felt as if they were facing a great enemy. Even the array formation in the Dragon Palace began to tremble.

Wang Xian, who was in the bedroom of long Xiang, had a change in expression. He immediately flew out.

“I’ve broken through!”

A majestic voice was heard. Wang Xian, Shu Qing, Lan Qingyue, and the rest saw Feng Luan floating in the middle of the Dragon King Palace. There was a small vermillion bird between her brows.

The Vermillion Bird was circling around her body, exuding a terrifying aura.

“Hiss, she’s really fast!”

Wang Xian looked at Feng Luan in astonishment. He still needed ten million dragon Qi to break through.

“Sister Feng Luan!”

Guan Shuqing and the other girls flew over.

“I’m leaving!”

Feng Luan, who had broken through to the transcendence realm, had undergone a huge change.

“Transcendence, transcendence of mortals. This is what a true immortal should be like. I feel that the energy in his body is sufficient to kill me instantly!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered.

“If we are fated, we will meet again on the transcendence continent!”

Wang Xian looked at Feng Luan and said to her.

“If we are fated, we will meet again!”

Feng Luan nodded. A transcendent aura was slowly emitted from her body. “Perhaps one day, when I reach the peak again, I will look for you guys!”

Domineering, transcendent, and fierce. At this moment, the empress was showing her prowess.

“I’m leaving!”

She was obviously not a person who was good at parting. Her body moved, and she directly disappeared, flying toward the west.

“Sister Feng Luan, we will look for you!”

Guan Shuqing and the others shouted loudly.

“When I reach the peak and become the empress, I will look for you!”

“At that time, we will meet again!”
