Chapter 1431: 1431 bloodshed imperial city

“Command the world to lay down the flag!”

“The meaning of the flag laid down by the bloodshed empire is obvious. Command the world.”

“When the flag is laid out, all the forces in the entire Liuhai region must listen to the Order!”

“With the strength of the bloodshed empire, they have the right to command the world!”

“In the past, all the level six Seethrough void martial artists in the entire Liuhai region were with the bloodshed empire. Now, although there is an additional sect master of the Heavenly Sword sect, this does not have much effect on their status!”

In the vast wilderness, Feng Luan and Wang Xian sat in a sedan.

Outside the sedan, more than 30 insightful emptiness realm experts were accompanying them. Two level two insightful emptiness realm beasts were pulling their proud sons.

Beside Feng Luan, there was a one-meter-sized flag with the words “Command the world”written on it.

After Wang Xian and Feng Luan returned from the Heaven Sword sect, they gathered more than 30 insightful emptiness realm experts and headed to the blood flow empire.

The order of the bloodshed empire had been sent to the Dragon and Phoenix Empire. They had no choice but to go.

If they didn’t go, it would be equivalent to not giving face to the bloodshed empire. The consequences were obvious.

Furthermore, the bloodshed empire gathered all the forces for the matter of the demon beasts in the demi-human graveyard. This time, it would be difficult for all the forces to remain unscathed.

“That was in the past.”

Wang Xian smiled. “I wonder if the blood flow empire has any plans to gather all the forces in the Liuhai Region?”

Feng Luan shook her head. “We’ll know when we get there!”

The team proceeded forward. The blood flow empire was at least 300,000 kilometers away from the dragon-phoenix Empire. The journey was extremely long.

If they rushed over, it would take at least four to five days.

At that time, it would also be the time for the blood flow empire to invite all the powers in the world to discuss important matters.

At the same time, all the powers in the entire Liuhai region started to move, heading towards the direction of the blood flow empire.

A storm was about to arrive!

“Your Majesty, Lord Wang, two kilometers ahead is the blood flow empire’s Imperial City!”

After traveling for four consecutive days, the old woman’s voice sounded from outside.

“Hang up the flag!”

Feng Luan waved her arm and opened the curtain. A flag floated above the sedan.

“As expected of the bloodshed imperial city. It’s really lively and extraordinary!”

Wang Xian looked outside and was slightly surprised.

In the past, the most magnificent city he had seen was Xiaoyao city. However, compared to the city ahead, Xiaoyao city was much inferior.

The entire city was like an ancient Western Castle. Every building in the city was extremely luxurious.

The golden city gates emitted a thick and heavy color.

A city wall of 500 meters was definitely the tallest city wall that Wang Xian had ever seen.

They were still 2,000 meters away from the bloodshed empire. Below them was a wide road.

The road was paved with milky-white tiles, giving people a comfortable feeling.

The entire road was two to three kilometers wide, surrounded by luxurious carriages.

Many forces with flags also walked towards the imperial city that was filled with historical heritage.

Void interpretation level experts could be seen everywhere, and void interpretation level demon beasts could be seen everywhere.

In front of the city gate, there was a moat that was one thousand meters wide. Terrifying fish would occasionally appear in the moat.

The level of these fish was not low. Even if a half-step void interpretation expert were to fall into the moat, he would still have a slim chance of survival!

“The entire Liuhai region is as big as Earth. There are definitely more than 10,000 void interpretation experts in there. There should be more than 1,000 people who came to the bloodshed empire this time. Including the bloodshed empire, there should be close to 2,000 void interpretation experts!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Wang Xian thought to himself.

“What power do you belong to? I’ll bring you to the place where you live!”

Just as they arrived at the entrance of the city, two middle-aged men of extraordinary level nine walked over and asked them.

“The Dragon and Phoenix Empire!”

Mang Hong pointed at the flag of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire and said to the two middle-aged men.

“Come with us!”

The two of them nodded and led them inside.

The two of them sped along the road while Wang Xian, Feng Luan, and the rest followed in a car.

After traveling for at least 70 to 80 kilometers, they arrived at the location of the square.

It was a huge square.

The square had an area of at least five kilometers.

In the middle of the square, there were many statues. Each of the statues was as tall as 100 meters and arranged neatly in a row!

In front of the square, there was a huge imperial palace.

Two seven to eight meters tall lions were lying on the left and right of the imperial palace.

These were not stone lions, but two third level void interpretation demonic beasts.

One could see how powerful the blood flow empire was.

“I’ll lead you to a castle. Your dragon-phoenix Empire will temporarily stay in the castle, waiting for the summon of our blood emperor!”

Two middle-aged transcendents at level nine spoke to them and led them into a nearby castle.

The castle was not very big, but it had a beautiful environment. It was five stories high and was very good.

There was still running water in the courtyard. A castle outside the palace was already so beautiful, let alone inside the palace!

“Rest well for a night. I don’t know what Will Happen Tomorrow!”

Feng Luan said to her subordinates.

“It’s Her Majesty!”

Everyone nodded.

This time, Feng Luan brought more than 30 insightful emptiness realm experts from the dragon and Phoenix Empire.

Beside Wang Xian, Ao Jian and a golden swordfish were followed by 15 strange demons.

Ao Yao was personally leading the team.

Other than Ao Yao, the rest of the strange demons were the strongest 14 among the strange demons.

Four were at level three of the void interpretation realm, ten were at level two of the void interpretation realm, and level three of the Void Interpretation Realm could assassinate level four of the Void interpretation realm.

Ten were at level two of the void interpretation realm, and they could assassinate level three of the Void interpretation realm.

This force was not strong, but it was definitely not weak.

At the very least, other than the king of the Light Dragon Dynasty, the Hanhai dynasty, the Divine Wind Academy, and the Blood Stream sect, the strange demons could be easily assassinated.

Even the king of some dynasties could be dealt with.

If Ao Yao was included, there was no need to mention it.

“I’ll have a good look at the various factions in the Liuhai Region Tomorrow!”

Wang Xian sat in a room in the room. He poured a cup of tea and muttered with a smile on his face.

“Are they here?”

At this moment, in a large hall in the imperial palace, four to five middle-aged elders were sitting on both sides.

A middle-aged man in blood-red clothes and a beautiful woman sat in the center.

The one who spoke was the middle-aged man sitting at the side.

“Sir, the people of the dragon and Phoenix dynasty have arrived!”

The middle-aged man standing in the center reported respectfully.

“Hehe, it’s good that they’re here. Your Highness, I’ll Have to trouble the Shadow Division of the Blood Flow Dynasty!”

The middle-aged man said to the middle-aged man in the middle of the blood-red clothes with a smile.

“Your Highness, that Supreme Genius named Wang Xian is also with the dragon and Phoenix Empire!”

Before the middle-aged man in the blood-red clothes could speak, the reporting staff quickly said.

“Oh? That supreme genius at level five of the Seethrough Void?”

On both sides, the middle-aged elders frowned slightly.
