Chapter 3025: 3024 slaughtered his way out of the blood path, intimidating the group of Heroes 8

“Oh no, what’s the situation!”

“Old Bai, medicinal wine!”

On the ancient rare race’s giant mountain peak, terrifying array fluctuations and terrified screams immediately attracted the attention of everyone on the peak.

There were over 5,000 people on the entire peak, and all of them were ancient rare race alchemists.

There were also quite a number of God Emperor Level Alchemists.

They sensed the changes outside, and their expressions changed. The expressions of two of the god Emperor level eight experts changed, and powerful defenses condensed on their bodies as they flew out.

“Dragon Eye Lock on all corners!”

The instant they charged out, an incomparably terrifying attack attacked them.

“Not good, everyone get ready. We’ve been attacked!”

The two brain spirit race experts who had charged out felt this might. Their expressions changed drastically, and they immediately roared loudly.

“What? We’re at the peak, and there are incomparably powerful restrictions around us. There are a large number of subordinates guarding the bottom of the peak. Why are we suddenly being attacked?”

In the alchemist room, everyone’s expressions changed drastically when they saw this scene.

“Hualala!”

At this moment, terrifying chains covered the entire peak.

“Attack!”

The expressions of the two rank eight divine emperor brain spirit race experts changed drastically. Their heads turned azure in an instant. Their hair was like water whips as they waved towards the chains in the sky.

“Peng Peng Peng!”

A terrifying collision was heard.

The brain spirit race had huge heads. They were natural water attribute cultivators. Their hair was their weapon of attack.

“Hehehe, go to hell!”

At this moment, the eight-headed divine emperor and the sky array appeared on the left and right.

The eight-headed divine emperor moved, and his entire body was like black liquid as he charged towards them.

The sky array waved its arms, and powerful formations condensed in the void.

“Oh no, there’s a rank eight divine Emperor Magus!”

Seeing the sky array’s strange body and sensing the changes in the world, their expressions changed.

The Magus lineage was an exceptionally powerful existence in the center of the entire universe.

Many people were unwilling to provoke the Magi.

This was because they were powerful and strange.

Formations and sorcery could seal a space. Once it was sealed, they could not even escape.

“Who are you people? Why are you attacking my brain spirit race!”

A rank eight divine emperor’s expression changed greatly as he questioned with a gloomy expression.

“This is the price you have to pay for invading our Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian flapped his divine wings and attacked them at a terrifying speed.

“Dragon Palace!”

Upon hearing these two words, the hearts of the Brainiac race members sank.

Not long ago, the Dragon Palace had assassinated a large number of experts from their Brainiac race. Who would have thought that they would be here again…

“Everyone, destroy all the medicinal pills and divine herbs. Even if we die, we can not let them obtain them!”

A fierce expression appeared on the face of an expert from the brain spirit race as he cried out sternly.

“Yes!”

“Destroy, destroy them all!”

The faces of the alchemists from the brain spirit race revealed terrified expressions as they cried out in panic.

“Pu Pu Pu!”

However, at this moment, an Lie’s figure appeared. His sharp dagger was smeared with an intense poison as it slashed across the heads of the experts from the brain spirit race.

“Oh no, someone has entered!”

The surroundings were filled with sounds of panic. The entire peak was thrown into chaos.

Boom

In front of him, Wang Xian’s arm turned into a dragon claw as he attacked a brain spiritual race expert.

When the brain spiritual race expert saw Wang Xian’s speed, his expression changed drastically.

“Law Divine Ability: water control three thousand!”

He roared sternly and formed ripples in front of him. Fish scales appeared on the ripples and formed an indestructible defense.

“PFFT!”

However, just as his defense was formed, an incomparably sharp claw penetrated his head from behind him.

“The person that the Dragon Palace wants to assassinate can’t escape!”

Ao Yao’s voice entered his mind. He widened his eyes and was filled with shock.

His life force was quickly melted by the power of light and darkness.

“Big Brother!”

A terrified voice sounded from the side.

“Hehehe!”

Ba Qi’s cold laughter sounded. He waved his arm and his liquid-like body grew longer as he attacked him.

The brain spirit expert immediately blocked it.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

However, the formation attack from the Heaven Formation had arrived.

This caused his eyes to turn blood red.

Boom! Boom

Wang Xian increased his speed and attacked him as well.

“No, we, the brain spirit race, will definitely not let you off!”

The level eight divine emperor expert shouted sternly. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

In the next moment, he was overwhelmed by the extremely powerful attack.

Faced with the combined attack of Wang Xian and the other three, he could not last for more than five seconds.

“No, no, no…”

“Elder!”

At the back, the group of alchemists roared with fear on their faces.

“Die!”

Ba Qi and Ao Yao did not hesitate at all. They attacked the rest of the alchemists directly.

What followed was a one-sided massacre.

“Hahaha, Dragon King, we are rich! There are so many medicinal pills in there!”

At this moment, an excited roar came from the inner space of the peak.

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the Brainiac race experts who were waiting to be slaughtered. His body moved and he flew straight into the inner space.

In the stone chamber inside the peak, the words “Pill storage chamber”were written on it.

Upon entering, one would immediately see bottles and jars of medicinal pills.

Each jade bottle contained a large number of pills.

“This is?”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly. Indeed, he had let go of the Golden Belt.

“TSK, TSK, tsk. Dragon King, this is a place where the Brainiac race refines pills. The Brainiac race is good at refining pills in this area of the void. Their pills are sold to dozens of races and races!”

“Even if this isn’t the core of a few pill refining rooms, there are still quite a number of pills stored here.”

Ba Qi walked in at this moment and said with glowing eyes.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian was also slightly excited. There were many, many pills in there. There were almost millions of them.

Even though there were many pills that were not of a high level, coupled with the resources that he had obtained recently, it was enough for him to achieve a breakthrough in his strength.

After achieving a breakthrough, he would have the combat strength of a level nine celestial thearch.

With his combat strength of a level nine divine emperor, it was enough for him to kill existences of the same level.

In that case, in this piece of void space, those who were stronger than the Dragon Palace were only the few powerful domain-level races.

“Sky Array, record the situation here. In the name of our Dragon Palace, immediately transmit it to the universal ai!”

Wang Xian kept all the pills and instructed the sky array.

“It’s the Dragon King. We have recorded everything!”

The Heaven Formation nodded!

“Deal with it. Let’s return to the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian said.

They nodded and their figures slowly disappeared.

Using the two major races to intimidate the other races.

It was believed that the universe’s artificial intelligence system would be in an uproar soon.

At that time, the domain-level experts would also become obedient.
