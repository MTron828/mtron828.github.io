Chapter 2973: , in the race at the center of the universe

“The base of the eight barrens is rumored to be a treasure ground of the ancient race. I found that there is a powerful formation sealing a special metal gem at the center of the place. This metal gem can absorb a large amount of spiritual energy!”

“A part of the spiritual energy absorbed is scattered around, and a part is used for storage. It can be used as energy. All the energy of the formation and all the equipment in the Dragon Cave is provided by this.”

“According to my guess, if we activate all the formations and all the weapons to attack, it will last for at least a year. After the energy is exhausted, we can continue to absorb and recover.”

As the sky formation spoke, it brought Wang Xian towards the depths of the Dragon Cave.

Currently, the depths were filled with some buildings.

It occupied four-fifths of the space of the entire Dragon Cave.

However, the remaining space was not too crowded for all the members of the Dragon Palace to enter.

The core of a war machine was very important. The more energy it had, the stronger its long-lasting attack would be.

“How powerful is the entire Dragon Cave?”

Wang Xian asked the Heaven Formation.

“Dragon King, with the many formations I have set up and the weapons forged by the fire hammer clan, it shouldn’t be a problem for me to destroy a level six divine emperor with my full strength!”

“In short, even if there were ten of me, I wouldn’t be able to withstand all the attacks from the Dragon Cave!”

The Heaven Formation said with a smile.

“Sure, it’s already very powerful!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“When you fly, the speed of the entire dragon cave is comparable to a level five divine emperor powerhouse. There’s one more point. If Our Dragon Palace were to set up a summoning altar at a place in advance, an lie would be able to teleport the entire Dragon Cave.”

Prime Minister Gui said.

Wang Xian nodded and sized up the entire Dragon Cave.

In the Dragon Cave, there were arrow platforms that were specially used by the arrow dragon species. There were also some battle platforms that were prepared for the Starwood Dragon species.

Holes were dug out on both sides to prevent enemies on both sides.

Powerful and awe-inspiring equipment were placed at the entrance of the holes.

Even a level six divine emperor could explode it directly.

The entire Dragon Cave was abnormally powerful.

Wang Xian looked around and was very satisfied.

At least for now, the entire Dragon Cave was the strongest offensive method of the Dragon Palace.

Moreover, if the heaven array and the fire hammer clan’s strength were to increase in the future, they could still upgrade the entire Dragon Cave.

The limit of upgrading depended on how strong the core energy of the entire Dragon Cave could support.

“Well done.”

Wang Xian looked around and praised him again.

“Hehe, Dragon King. Now that we have no opponents in the entire resplendent starry sky, this Dragon Cave is of no use to us for the time being!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Next, let some members of the Dragon Palace Rest for a while. I plan to send someone to the bhang Liu He!”

Prime Minister Gui smiled and told Wang Xian about the next plan.

“To the bhang Liu He?”

Wang Xian was deep in thought.

At present, the resplendent starry sky had no secrets to the Dragon Palace. Naturally, Wang Xian was aware of the situation at the bhang Liu He.

According to the guess of the Dragon Palace, the opposite side of the bhang Liu he was most likely the center of the universe.

And the bhang Liu he should be the ruins of a race!

“With an Lie’s ability, we can explore the entire bhang liu he first. It would be best if we can obtain some treasures. When we are strong enough, we can make preparations for stepping into the starry sky opposite the bhang Liu he in the future!”

Prime Minister Gui continued.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head!

“We are preparing to rest for a month or two. We will let the members of the Dragon Palace understand the information first before we can investigate together with an lie!”

Prime Minister Gui said.

“You can make the arrangements for this!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

At present, there were still ten level five divine emperors of the Dragon Palace, not including him. It would be sufficient for the members of the Dragon Palace to explore the eight barrens and six directions.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded.

The completion of the Dragon Cave was a good thing for the entire Dragon Palace. After that, Prime Minister Gui gave all the members a month or two to rest and wander around in the starry sky.

While all the members of the Dragon Palace were resting, they were in the eight barrens and six directions.

“It’s almost done, it should be done soon!”

A month later, in the chaotic area of the desolate land of six directions, there were collapsed ancient buildings around them.

On the ground, there were corpses. Compared to the last time, the number of corpses had increased a lot in the past month.

A month ago, according to the speculation of the godly monarchs, the array formation in front of them should be broken very soon.

However, after a month, more than 100,000 people died, but the array formation was still not broken.

This made the godly monarchs anxious, and some of the experts and disciples of the eight desolation started to panic.

They were also afraid of death.

“Lord Godly monarch, how long will it take to break the array formation?”

The thousands of injured eight desolation disciples asked in fear.

“It should be soon, it should be soon!”

The godly monarch muttered, and his eyes were bloodshot as he stared at the array formation in front of him.

They were only a step away from the palace in front of them, but this array formation had completely isolated them.

Even though they thought that the array formation was about to be broken, more than 100,000 people had died over the past month, but it was still not broken.

“Look at that palace. There are people, there are people!”

Suddenly, at that moment, a godly monarch expert widened his eyes and pointed in the direction of the array formation with a face full of shock as he shouted loudly.

“Oh?”

At that moment, everyone’s bodies trembled. They immediately looked in the direction of the array formation and stared intently.

In an instant, their eyes revealed a look of terror.

In front of them, six eyes were also staring in their direction.

The source of the six eyes was not three people, but two people.

In the center of their brows, there was also an eye.

At this moment, the two people who looked exactly like humans but had a vertical eye in the center also looked at them.

The cold eyes stared at them, making them feel a chill in their hearts and some fear.

This was definitely the gaze of a very powerful expert.

Even though they were separated by the array formation, it still made them shiver.

“I beg the two masters to help us break the array formation here!”

The emperor master hurriedly shouted at the two three-eyed humans outside.

However, the two three-eyed humans on the other side were filled with curiosity and surprise. They looked at each other and couldn’t hear the desolate god race’s words.

“They can’t hear us, they can’t hear us!”

“Three-eyed humans, these are definitely great beings from another region. They are great beings from another region. That should be the center of the Universe!”

“Think of a way to communicate with them. Think of a way to communicate with them!”

The god Emperors revealed anxious expressions as they shouted.

“Let me do it!”

At this moment, the desolate god Emperor who was standing in the middle took a deep breath and said.

“Desolate god Emperor, do you have a way to communicate with those people over there?”

The god Emperor’s expression changed as he stared at him and said loudly.
