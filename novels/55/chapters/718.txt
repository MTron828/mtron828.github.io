“That young lady is so powerful, she actually, she actually easily defeated Kong Leshan and the others, and she actually fought together with the Crown Prince!”

“The crown prince obviously knows that young lady, and he even fought before. Why does he listen to the Crown Prince’s words, it seems like he suffered a loss with that young lady!”

“Although this young lady is powerful, but if she wants to defeat our crown prince, that’s...”.

“Ah, F * ck, you’re hitting my butt again. You Demoness, demoness, I’ll fight to the death with you!”

On the surrounding streets, a group of Yellow Heaven Immortal sect disciples and their family members looked on in shock when they saw Xiao Yu instantly defeating Kong Leshan and the others.

When they saw that the young girl was actually fighting with their crown prince, shock appeared on their faces.

Everyone started to discuss. However, before they could finish their words, a miserable voice came from the sky.

Everyone widened their eyes as disbelief appeared on their faces.

“You hit my butt again. This word again is the key. You have to strike it down!”

A young man below gulped and said in a daze.

The Heaven’s chosen disciples of the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect who were standing next to Feng Lingtian raised their heads and revealed expressions of shock.

This was especially so for the three young men and women who were instantly defeated. Their eyes were filled with shock and their expressions were somewhat ugly.

“This young lady is so... So Strong. Even the crown prince was completely suppressed by her!”

One of the heaven’s chosen disciples opened his mouth slightly.

“The wind is cold, the water is cold, and the autumn wind is cold!”

At this moment, Feng Lingtian’s voice came from the sky, and the leaves in the sky fell.

The green leaves were formed from wind attribute energy, and they rotated slowly, emitting a terrifying attack power.

“You still have time to use your ultimate move!”

Xiao Yu looked at Feng Lingtian who was standing in the sky with concentration, and a trace of mockery appeared on the corner of her mouth. Her body moved, and she directly charged over with a strong defense.

“Pa Pa Pa!”

The leaves on Xiao Yu’s body made a crisp sound as the black bone armor on her body repelled the sharp leaves.

“F * * k, it’s this terrifying defense again!”

Feng Lingtian looked at Xiao Yu who was charging forward and could not help but twitch his lips. With a wave of his arm, tens of thousands of leaves flew towards Xiao Yu.

“Shadow Bone Whip!”

Xiao Yu waved the bone whip in his hand, instantly turning into hundreds of them. Each of them was like a terrifying poisonous snake that spread across a radius of a few thousand meters.

“PA PA!”

The leaves were easily sent flying. The two bone whips wrapped around Feng Lingtian’s body, causing his expression to change drastically!

“Pa!”

“Ah!”

A crisp sound rang out on the streets of Yellow Heaven City. The people below could see that Feng Lingtian’s pants had been torn to shreds.

White flesh was revealed from within.

Everyone below was stunned. This was the crown prince, their crown prince!

The Yellow Heaven Immortal sect only had one immortal god expert, which was Feng Lingtian’s father, a middle-level immortal.

Feng Lingtian was the crown prince of the entire Yellow Heaven Immortal sect.

But now, their crown prince had been beaten up by a young girl, and it was even a whip.

This, this...

“How many times have I told you not to hit me there? You, you... I can’t afford to offend you, can I not hide from you?”

Feng Lingtian’s face was extremely red. He touched his back and felt traces of bulging blood as he gritted his teeth.

Xiao Yu’s attack wasn’t very heavy, but that was the case. Seeing this girl humiliate and trample on him, Feng Lingtian felt like he wanted to die.

He was the Crown Prince of the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect, the most monstrous heaven’s son in the entire yellow cauldron.

This was already the second time he had been whipped by this girl.

The first time was outside, he warned everyone not to tell anyone about this matter. But now, it was actually inside Yellow Heaven City.

Under the gazes of everyone.

Feng Lingtian felt extremely aggrieved. He couldn’t afford to provoke her, but this young master could hide!

“Hide? Do you think you can hide?”

Xiao Yu’s face was filled with mockery.

“If this young master can’t hide, then I’ll be at your disposal!”

Feng Lingtian gritted his teeth and moved like a gust of wind. “This time, your brother isn’t here. If you want to capture this young master, you must be Dreaming!”

“Evasive shadow technique. This is the evasive shadow technique created by sect leader Feng Ying. It can burst forth with a terrifying speed!”

“Once the evasive shadow technique is used, it can disappear without a trace. I didn’t expect the crown prince to be forced to this extent by a young lady!”

The crowd below saw Feng Lingtian evading and said in slight shock.

“Then let’s give it a try, little slave!”

Xiao Yu’s face revealed a mocking expression. The bone whip in his hand immediately lengthened as he attacked Feng Lingtian.

“Haha, Little Demoness, Little Demoness, if you want to catch me, don’t even think about it for the rest of Your Life!”

Feng Lingtian’s figure moved and easily dodged Xiao Yu’s bone whip. His sullen mood was finally eased and he began to mock.

“Is that so?”

Xiao Yu’s expression did not change. He did not retract the bone whip in his hand. With a wave of his arm, a bone whip condensed from demonic qi instantly attacked.

“Haha, if you can’t hit it, are you angry? !”

The Bone Whip was once again evaded, and Feng Lingtian mocked loudly.

Xiao Yu’s expression turned slightly angry when he heard the taunts. He stretched out his ten fingers and a bone whip formed from Devil Qi appeared from his body. It instantly covered an area of five to six thousand meters in the sky. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Little Witch, Little Witch, I’m right here. Come, come, hit me!”

One had to admit that Feng Lingtian was extremely despicable, as he evaded Xiao Yu’s terrifying attacks and laughed out loud.

“Little Slave, you won’t be able to escape now, right?”

Xiao Yu’s mouth revealed a crafty smile as she pulled her arm, and the bone whips that had been gathering in the sky and had not been retracted quickly surrounded Feng Lingtian, sealing off all directions.

“F * ck, you crafty Demoness!”

Feng Lingtian’s expression changed drastically. The six longswords around him slashed towards the bone whips in an attempt to escape.

“Boom!”

But in an instant, Feng Lingtian’s voice was flung towards the ground.

His body landed on the street, instantly causing a crack to appear on the street.

“Ah! F * * K!”

A painful voice came from her mouth. Xiao Yu landed with a smile on her face, the bone whip in her hand completely wrapping around her body.

With a move of her palm, a bone whip formed from Devil Qi was formed in her hand and she directly struck towards Feng Lingtian’s back.

“Little slave, do you admit defeat!”

“Ah Ah Ah, you witch, witch, I am a seven foot tall man...”

“Pa!”

“Ah, I admit defeat! ! I admit defeat! !”

Feeling the pain from his back and Butt, Feng Lingtian almost cried.

Even his father had never hit him like this before, and now, he had already lost to a woman twice.

He had no way of resisting at all!

Especially this time, under the watchful eyes of everyone.

“Who is causing trouble in Yellow Sky City? You’re courting death!”

At this moment, an earth-shattering shout rang out, and a number of yellow sky city guards who were flying on swords flew over slowly!
