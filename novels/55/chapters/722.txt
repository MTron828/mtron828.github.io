Chapter 723: 0724 Dragon Gate Banquet 2(1/20)

Translator: 549690339

“Do we know who did it?”

In the main seat of the room, an old man sat there with a sullen face and said with a sullen face.

“Deacon Zhang, we have found out. The one who did it was the Doctor from the Divine Dragon Medical Center. He is known as the Red God doctor. He is at the Dan Stage!”

“However, according to the information we have, the person behind this Red God doctor is someone called Wang Xian. He is the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate, the strongest force in the Jianghu!”

A middle-aged man sitting next to him said as he took out an invitation card.

“Coincidentally, I received a piece of news today!”

The middle-aged man handed the invitation card over. “This was given to me by a martial artist who joined the Puppet Immortal Sect!”

“Dragon Gate Banquet?”

The Old Man took the invitation card and his eyes flickered.

“That’s right, Dragon Gate banquet. I have investigated this Dragon Gate today and found out that this force is not simple!”

The middle-aged man said in a deep voice.

“Not simple?”

The old man raised his head and looked at the middle-aged man.

“Yes, this Dragon Gate used to be the most powerful force in the martial world. At the same time, it was also the king of Jiang City. The Dragon King of Dragon Gate was at least at the infant realm, or even stronger. Moreover, there were at least ten infant realm experts in Dragon Gate!”

The middle-aged man said.

“More than ten infant realm experts?”

The old man revealed a surprised expression and automatically ignored the words ‘even stronger’, then, his eyes turned cold. “No wonder they dared to cripple the disciples of our puppet immortal sect. This Dragon Gate is really audacious!”

“The Dragon Gate banquet is interesting!”

The old man’s eyes turned cold as he slammed the invitation card heavily on the table. “I think this is the farewell banquet!”

The middle-aged man frowned. “Deacon, should we report this matter to the immortal sect? After all, the strength of this dragon sect is not to be underestimated!”

“There’s no need for that for now. Today, we’ll go over and ask them to give us an explanation. If this dragon sect doesn’t know what’s good for them, we’ll report it to the immortal sect and destroy it!”

“This... is a deacon!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The middle-aged man still wanted to ask if there was any danger. After all, they were a faction in jianghu in the past and couldn’t be compared to the immortal sect at all.

As long as this Dragon Gate didn’t seek death, they definitely wouldn’t dare to attack them!

A faction without immortals and gods would be destroyed in the end!

At this moment, on the jianghu network, within the Shun Ding region’s page, a few posts were trending in the forum.

One was about Mu Zidao and Ming Feng.

Jianghu website was the largest website in China, and ordinary people knew about this forum.

What happened at the school gate yesterday was known by all the students of Jiang Cheng University.

Someone had brought this matter to jianghu website.

There weren’t many words, only photos.

Mu Zidao and Ming Feng were wearing torn clothes as they stood in front of an RV. A dog was squatting there staring at them.

The two of them were in an exceptionally sorry state. The clothes on their bodies couldn’t cover their bodies at all.

What shocked everyone even more was that the two of them were repairing cars.

That’s right, they were repairing cars.

Mu Zidao and Ming Feng were both elite disciples of the Ming Wang Immortal sect. They could definitely be ranked in the top ten among the younger generation in the immortal sect.

However, the two dazzling disciples of the immortal sect were actually repairing the car in such a sorry state.

This was obviously abnormal.

At the same time, it also caused all the martial artists in the Shun Ding region to be dumbstruck.

“What’s going on? Mu Zidao and Ming Feng are both very powerful. How did they end up in such a State?”

“Oh my God! What’s going on?”

Everyone was shocked as they replied below. In just a few short hours, it had become the hottest topic in the Shun Ding region.

However, someone who knew about it quickly revealed the cause and effect. This immediately caused an uproar in everyone in the Shun Ding region!

An infant stage dog!

Jiang City University’s famous figure, Wang Xian!

Dragon King of the Dragon Gate!

Following that, there was a post that attracted everyone’s attention this morning.

Dragon Gate Banquet!

The Jianghu faction, Dragon King of Dragon Gate, would hold a Dragon Gate banquet at Xianyang Hotel and invite all the martial artists from the aristocratic families in Jiang city.

This post was related to Mu Zidao’s and Ming Feng’s posts.

The originator was the same person!

Dragon King of Dragon Gate!

“I didn’t expect there to be such a faction in jianghu, and it’s even within the territory of our Shun Ding!”

In the Ming Wang Immortal sect, a dozen or so young men and women were sitting on a mountain platform that was emitting a faint light.

A thin and weak young man holding a white scepter raised his head indifferently and glanced at the two gloomy-looking young men sitting beside him.

“Does our immortal sect elder have any orders?”

A girl was holding a cell phone and taking beautiful pictures as she asked with a smile on her face.

“Do you think the immortal sect will do anything about this? The disciples of the immortal sect are humiliated after provoking others, and the immortal sect will avenge them? Hehe!”

The thin and weak young man said mockingly.

“After all, there are about ten infant realm cultivators. Maybe the Dragon King is a half-step immortal god Powerhouse. This force is not weak.”

The girl continued.

“Tonight, my father is attending a banquet. That guy dares to humiliate us because he has an idea. He wants to join our Ming Wang Immortal sect. In this way, he will attract our immortal sect’s attention, investigate his background, and then invite them to join the immortal sect. This way, he can get better benefits!”

Obviously, Feng’s face was gloomy, and his eyes flickered. “However, he picked the wrong person. He can join, but he has to pay a price!”

“They are a very powerful force and are very useful to our immortal sect. Hehe, but you guys are really unlucky. At most, you can only disgust the other party. In the future, your status might not be lower than ours!”

The thin and weak young man laughed.

The Dragon King of the Dragon Gate dared to humiliate Mu Zidao and Xian Feng. Clearly, in their eyes, he had only one goal, which was to attract the attention of the immortal sect and invite them into the immortal sect.

That was because if the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate deliberately wanted to humiliate mu zidao and Xian Feng, he was obviously courting death.

A powerful force that once belonged to the jianghu was obviously not so stupid!

“I’ll go and see the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate Tonight. Which one of you is interested in going?”

The thin and weak young man stood up with a smile on his face and said casually.

“I’ll Go!”

“I’ll go and take a look too, Hehe!”

The young men stood up with smiles on their faces.

If Wang Xian knew about the thoughts of the Ming Wang Immortal sect and thought that he wanted to attract the attention of the immortal sect, he didn’t know if he would think that they were too narcissistic.

However, from the perspective of the immortal sect, this was the only plausible explanation.

An ant ran onto the body of an elephant. The elephant wouldn’t think that the ant was here to provoke it.

It just thinks the ant is lost.

Because ants don’t deliberately seek death.

In their opinion, that’s what Dragon King means!
