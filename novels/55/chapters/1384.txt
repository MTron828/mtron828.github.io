Chapter 1385: 1385 dressed up as a playboy

“Young master, put all the spirit pearls in the interspatial ring. Take a look!”

In the Spirit Pearl Shop, the shopkeeper handed over the interspatial ring with a respectful expression and said with a smile.

He had heard Wang Xian’s words clearly just now.

He had heard of the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty.

A powerful dynasty that suddenly rose up had only been established for a year. It had destroyed four dynasties and occupied all the cities of the four dynasties.

With the current strength of the Dragon and Phoenix Dynasty, it was definitely one of the best within a hundred thousand kilometers.

And this young master in front of them had a very high position in the dragon and Phoenix dynasty.

They didn’t dare to offend such a force!

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. He swept his gaze across the spirit pearl in his interspatial ring and nodded his head in satisfaction.

Then, he walked out directly.

“The dragon-phoenix Empire!”

The elder of the Fire Hammer clan who had been following Wang Xian all this while had a puzzled look in his eyes.

“This guy is too arrogant. He actually doesn’t put us in his eyes at all!”

“Arrogant, he’s really arrogant to the extreme!”

“The dragon-phoenix Empire. If that Kid has a very high status in the dragon-phoenix Empire, he’s really not someone we can afford to provoke. This empire destroyed four empires in just ten days. Their influence is extremely terrifying. No wonder he was able to take out more than 100 billion middle-grade spirit stones!”

“Even if he has the ability, young master Yao invited him to the banquet organized by the young master of Xiaoyao City. Yet, that guy is still so disdainful. He’s simply arrogant!”

“That’s right. So what if it’s the dragon-phoenix Empire? In front of the young master of Xiaoyao City, it’s nothing.”

Seeing Wang Xianniao leaving without even bothering with them, the young men and women revealed furious expressions.

They were all princes and princesses from various big forces. Their statuses were extremely honorable.

Now that they were being treated with such contempt by a person, all of them were extremely furious.

“HMPH, you don’t know what’s good for you!”

Yao Dingfeng looked at Wang Xian’s back and snorted coldly. His eyes were extremely cold.

“Go and buy some elixirs!”

Wang Xian walked out of the Spirit Pearl Shop. The faint aura of a silkpants disappeared instantly. A faint smile appeared on his face.

It felt good to be a hedonist disciple.

If anyone doesn’t like me, fine, let’s attack the Dragon and Phoenix Empire!

Haha!

“Next, I will continue to act as the Dragon and Phoenix Empire!”

Wang Xian thought as he smiled and walked into the surrounding elixir stores.

The spirit stones in his hands were in the trillions. Naturally, he had to exchange them for resources that could be used to increase his strength.

Wang Xian did not hesitate at all when he took out all the elixirs of the insightful void tier.

He swept through the four elixir stores and spent more than 600 billion middle-grade spirit stones!

After a round of purchasing, Wang Xian walked towards the elixir area again.

He took out all the elixirs and spiritual herbs one by one.

In just a day’s time, Wang Xian spent more than 50,000 middle-grade spirit stones.

At least one-fifth of the spiritual herbs and elixirs in the entire elixir area were gone. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“As expected of Xiaoyao City. Even with more than 50,000 spiritual stones, it didn’t cause much of an impact to this place!”

Wang Xian sighed slightly when he came out of the elixir area.

After returning to the weapons area, Wang Xian walked toward the shop that the fire hammer tribe leader rented yesterday.

“Eh? Business is so good?”

When Wang Xian went over, he noticed that there were many customers lining up outside the shop to buy weapons.

“TSK TSK, I really didn’t expect the fire hammer tribe to open a shop. Moreover, the quality of the weapons inside are pretty good!”

“I heard from the Fire Hammer tribe that they are no longer in the gilded gold tribe. Aren’t they afraid that without their protection, some factions will capture them and make them slaves?”

“I guess many forces are waiting for the fire hammer clan to leave the city. Once they leave the city, I guess some forces will make a move!”

“Who cares? We are buying our weapons. It has nothing to do with us!”

When he arrived at the entrance of the shop, Wang Xian heard the discussions of some customers around him.

They didn’t have any scruples. They even said the same thing in front of the members of the Fire Hammer clan.

The members of the Fire Hammer clan ignored them and focused on selling their weapons!

“After the king’s auction ends tomorrow, I will raise Duan Jinming’s strength to the third level of the Seethrough void stage. Before I leave, I must let them experience what the fire hammer clan is like. Their subordinates are not people who can be underestimated by just a few people!”

Wang Xian thought to himself.

He was very satisfied with the speed at which the weapons were being sold.

Although the fire hammer clan was weak, their craftsmanship was well-known.

It was already night when he returned to his residence. When Wang Xian reached the door, he saw Duan Jinming, who was dressed neatly, walking out excitedly.

As he walked, he was holding a communication stone plate and giggling foolishly.

“Jinming, why aren’t you here to greet the Dragon King?”

The old man who had been following Wang Xian for the whole day said sternly when he saw the silly look on Duan Jinming’s face.

“AH? Oh Oh, Third Grandpa, Dragon King, Dragon King, I’m sorry, I didn’t see you!”

Upon hearing the old man’s voice, Duan Jinming hurriedly raised his head. When he saw Wang Xian, he said in a panic.

“No need, no need. Jinming, what made you so happy?”

Wang Xian asked with a smile on his face.

“Hehe, Dragon King, this... I’ll go and look for the third lady!”

Duan Jinming scratched his head and revealed an honest smile on his face.

“HMM, go on, go on. In a few days, I’ll bring you to the gilded gold family to propose a marriage!”

Wang Xian said to Duan Jinming with a smile on his face.

“Thank you, Dragon King. Thank you, Long Wang!”

Duan Jinming, who was nearly two meters tall, thanked him immediately.

“Oh right, I will bring you to the king’s auction house tomorrow to see the world!”

Wang Xian continued to speak to Duan Jinming.

“Oh? Yes, yes. Thank you, Dragon King. Thank you, Dragon King!”

Duan Jinming thanked him immediately. His eyes were filled with joy.

His strength had reached the first level of the Seethrough void stage. He would be able to be together with the third lady in the future.

In the end, he would be able to follow such a boss. This was something that he never dared to imagine in the past.

Wang Xian smiled. As one of the pillars of the future members of the Dragon Palace, Duan Jinming naturally could not treat his subordinates poorly.

“Hehe, Dragon King, you are so good to Jin Ming. This child is really lucky. We are really lucky to have met you, Dragon King!”

The old man beside him sighed.

Wang Xian smiled. “In the future, the Fire Hammer clan will become an existence beyond your imagination!”

“Dragon King!”

After returning to his residence, the Fire Hammer clan leader walked over and greeted him respectfully.

“Come in!”

Wang Xian was sipping his tea and checking some information through the communication stone tray.

“Dragon King, we sold a total of 5,000 weapons today. After we bought some supplies, the rest of the spirit stones are all here!”

The chief of the Fire Hammer clan respectfully handed over an interspatial ring.
