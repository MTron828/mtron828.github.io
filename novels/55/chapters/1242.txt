Chapter 1243: Battle of the 1244 Prodigies

Translator: 5496903

The Prince of the Hanhai dynasty was dead!

The matter had blown up!

When everyone around saw this scene, two sentences flashed through their minds.

It had blown up, it had blown up completely!

Everyone’s faces were filled with shock as they looked at Ling Jian ‘er in shock.

In the distance, a group of people from the Heavenly Sword sect who were watching this scene had a huge change in their expressions.

The Prince of the Hanhai Empire was killed by Ling Jian ‘er, but it was completely different from the last time when Ling Jian ‘er killed the disciples of the Hanhai Empire.

The prince was the son of the king of the Hanhai Empire.

It could be said that in terms of status, he was equivalent to the son and daughter of the sect leader of the Heavenly Sword sect.

But now, Ling Jian ‘er actually killed an outstanding prince. The Hanhai Empire would definitely not let this matter go easily.

There was already some friction between the two powerful forces. Now that a prince had died, the Hanhai dynasty would definitely take revenge in a frenzy.

A prince could already represent the Hanhai dynasty.

Killing a prince was undoubtedly putting the Hanhai dynasty’s face on the ground and using all their strength to rub against each other!

How could the Hanhai dynasty let such an action go so easily! !

This would even cause a confrontation between the two peak powers, and it would trigger a battle at the insightful void tier.

Blood for blood!

When Ling Jian ‘er saw Han Ming Qing being penetrated by her golden light, she was slightly stunned. Her blood red eyes slowly retreated and her chest rose and fell. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“What... What terrifying destructive power!”

She clenched her arms tightly and killed Han Qing Ming directly, which was out of her expectations.

She had also truly experienced how terrifying the things she had obtained were. It had caused her attacks to increase by several times.

The terrifying penetration and void interpretation level armor were like thin paper.

“Origin of gold. I didn’t expect that I had only absorbed a single golden lotus tree...”

She mumbled.

“Ling Jian ‘er, you demoness, you ruthless fellow. You actually dared to kill my brother. You must die today!”

An angry roar resounded through the entire sky.

Han Mingshan hugged Han Ming Qing’s corpse. His entire body was filled with a terrifying killing intent. He stared at Ling Jian ‘ER and roared sinisterly.

Hugging Han Ming Qing’s corpse, he slowly stood up. “You dared to kill the Prince of the Hanhai dynasty. Even if your father is a sect of the heavenly sword sect, even if your father still recognizes you as a demoness, you must die today!”

“Even if we have to go to war with Your Heavenly Sword sect, we will take revenge for this!”

“You dare to kill our Prince? Kill her!”

“Surround her!”

The expressions of the thirty people behind Han Ming Shan changed drastically as they surrounded Ling Jian ‘er.

“I have nothing to do with the Heavenly Sword sect. If you dare to insult me, you must be prepared to die!”

Ling Jian ‘er raised her head and looked at everyone around her. Her eyes were extremely cold.

Even in such a situation, she was not afraid at all.

“D * mn, Ling Jian ‘ER is too strong. She is still so strong at this moment!”

“It’s over, it’s over. If Ling Jian ‘er did not kill Han Ming Qing, the Hanhai dynasty would definitely not dare to kill him. But now, the Hanhai dynasty will definitely not let her go!”

“If they let Ling Jian ‘er off, then the Boundless Sea Empire will lose a lot of face. After all, they are a top-tier power below the empire. They will definitely not give in.”

Everyone around looked at Ling Jian ‘er and discussed in amazement.

At this moment, 80% of the people on the Heaven’s pride stage had gathered here. All of them stared in this direction with their eyes wide open.

“Good, good. You Dare to kill my younger brother? Then today, we will fight to the death. No matter who dares to help you, they will be our enemies!”

As Han Mingshan spoke, his gaze swept towards the people from the Heavenly Sword sect.

Standing in the center of the Heavenly Sword sect was a young man with five longswords on his back. When he saw Han Mingshan looking over, he coldly swept his gaze across the arena without the slightest expression.

“Senior brother Su, should we...”

Behind him, a young man from the Heavenly Sword sect looked at the scene and frowned slightly.

“You brought this upon yourself!”

The eyes of the young man with five longswords on his back flickered as he spoke, and there was even a hint of schadenfreude in his eyes.

His aunt was the second mother who was killed by Ling Jian ‘er, and his cousin was also killed by Ling Jian ‘er.

He was already filled with hatred towards Ling Jian ‘er.

If Ling Jian ‘Er hadn’t killed the Prince of the vast Empire and Han Mingshan wanted to kill her, the people of the Heavenly Sword sect couldn’t just stand by and watch. But now...

A cold light flashed in his eyes. He had brought this upon himself.

“If the sect leader really brings her back one day, she will replace me as the most favored disciple of the heavenly sword sect. Now, it’s even better if she dies!”

The corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

“This Ling Jian ‘ER is really courting death!”

On the other side, Tang Yuan, Tang Ling ‘er, and some of the blood flow empire’s disciples were standing together.

Other than them, there were also a few young men. One of them was holding a wooden sword, the other was holding a huge hammer, and the other was holding a huge axe.

These few people would occasionally attract the attention of the surrounding people. It was obvious that they were not simple either.

Tang Ling ‘er saw Han Ming Qing who had died and her expression changed slightly. She said with a face full of disgust.

“Ling Jian ‘ER’s attack just now was a little strange. However, if no one saved her, she should be dead!”

Tang Yuan looked at Ling Jian ‘er and said to his sister.

“Hmph, who dares to save her? Even the people from the heavenly sword sect might not be able to save her, let alone the others. who dares to do so!”

Tang Ling ‘er sneered from the side

“Hurry up, hurry up, something big has happened outside!”

“What big thing?”

“Didn’t you guys hear the sound just now? Ling Jian ‘er and the people from the Hanhai dynasty are fighting. Furthermore, Ling Jian ‘er killed Prince Han Ming Qing. This matter has blown up. Now, the Hanhai dynasty wants to surround and kill Ling Jian ‘er!”

“What? Go, go, let’s go and take a look!”

In the Heaven’s Pride Pavilion, a young man suddenly walked in and said loudly to the few young men inside.

His words caused everyone in the heaven’s pride pavilion to be stunned

The Heaven’s Pride Pavilion had an array formation, so the soundproofing was very good. They didn’t hear what was happening outside.

When they heard the young man’s words, most of them stood up and walked outside with faces full of surprise.

Ling Jian ‘er!

Han Ming Qing!

Each and every one of them was a heaven’s favorite who was the center of attention. Now that such a thing had happened, they naturally had to go out and take a look.

“HMM?”

Wang Xian was sitting in front of the service counter with some tea leaves in his hands. He was slightly stunned when he heard the news.

A hint of silence appeared on his face. He placed the tea leaves into his interspatial ring and walked out directly.

When he walked out of the Heaven’s Pride Pavilion, he saw tens of thousands of people gathered in front of him.

Wang Xian walked straight in. A mask appeared on his face, completely covering his face.

Following that, the coquettish black robe also appeared on his body.

The Nameless Heaven’s Pride had returned!

“She has caused so much trouble in such a short period of time? What an unlucky woman!”

Wang Xian moved his body and floated into the sky. He looked inside.
