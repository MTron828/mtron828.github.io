Chapter 888: 0889 was disdainful

Translator: 549690339

The next morning, before dawn broke, the Mermaid Island was filled with noise.

After Wang Xian cultivated for a while at night, he continued to kill the Piranhas.

With the eye of the Heavenly Dragon, there was no difference between night and day. He wanted to accumulate sufficient resources for the members of the Dragon Palace to increase their strength.

“Ah! Run! There’s an extraordinary level-three piranha over there!”

On the second day, exclamations could be heard from the Mermaid Island from time to time.

On the second day, everyone didn’t have much time left. In order to complete the mission, they had to take more risks.

This made the battle today much more tragic than yesterday. Many examinees died tragically in the mouths of the Piranha.

“Whoosh!”

At this moment, a figure flashed past a group of people who were running away with the sound of wind.

The expressions of those people changed slightly.

“It’s that youth!”

“It’s him who killed Ao Xue and the rest last night!”

“His strength is definitely not below transcendent-level rank 3. is he planning to hunt down that transcendent-level rank 3 piranha?”

Exclamations came from the mouths of the few of them. They stopped and hesitated for a moment before looking back.

“Leave this place. Otherwise, you will have to bear the consequences!”

At this moment, a warning voice came from the side.

They raised their heads and saw eight young men staring at them coldly.

“They are too overbearing. Let’s Go!”

“Let’s go. They are not people we can provoke!”

Everyone’s expression changed slightly as they left this place hurriedly.

When Wang Xian was hunting, he could not let the people around him watch. This way, they would realize that he could transform into a divine dragon and it would be disadvantageous to him.

After killing the extraordinary level-three piranha within three moves, Wang Xian continued to rush to the next place.

“In front of us is the central circle of the Mermaid Island. There are even more powerful piranhas with big mouths there!”

The piranhas around Wang Xian were suspended in the air as he looked towards the center.

In the center, the area within a five-kilometer radius was filled with seawater. This was the center of the Mermaid Island.

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled. He could see many huge mermaids lying on the shore.

There are at least ten of them who are at transcendent level five. There might be even higher ones

Wang Xian took a deep breath.

This was not a place that he could deal with. He could only change his direction and hunt at other locations.

There was no need for him to take the risk now. He had already collected the items for the assessment. He was now collecting resources for the members of the Dragon Palace.

Two days passed very quickly. Wang Xian looked at the time and immediately flew towards the ship.

Behind him, a group of Drakonids followed behind.

This time, he obtained a total of 600 corpses of extraordinary level one creatures.

He obtained a total of 85 corpses of extraordinary level two creatures.

Fourteen corpses of extraordinary level three creatures!

If he devoured all of them, he would be able to increase it by more than 400 dragon crystals.

However, for the sake of development, Wang Xian kept all of them.

He looked at the ship. Five middle-aged men were floating in the air, waiting for their return.

At this moment, there were already people who had returned on the ship. Some of them were filled with excitement while others were frowning.

When Wang Xian and the rest landed on the ship, everyone glanced at them intentionally or unintentionally. Their eyes were filled with respect.

Soon, more and more people arrived. When the stipulated time was up, there were already more than a thousand people on the ship.

The other few hundred people either didn’t make it in time or were already dead.

There were more than twenty people who died at Wang Xian’s hands.

“Those who have completed the assessment, come out!”

The ship started on time. A middle-aged man walked to the front and spoke to everyone.

In an instant, the youths who had completed the assessment mission walked out excitedly.

There weren’t many people, only 60 to 70.

“Only five transcendent level one jade gels have been handed over!”

The middle-aged man glanced at them and continued.

More than half of the people immediately walked over and placed the jade gels in front in exchange for an admission permit.

This admission permit required the person to verify it. It would leave an image and no one else could pass it off.

“Below, for every jade glue that exceeds one, you will receive an additional academy point. Transcendent Level 2 jade glue, 10 points, transcendent level 3 jade glue, 100 points, send them over one by one!”

The middle-aged man saw that there were still more than 10 people who did not hand in their jade glue and continued speaking.

“Teacher, I have six, and I have a transcendent level 2 jade glue!”

“I have seven, and I have two transcendent level 2 jade glue!”

One by one, the young men walked over arrogantly as they spoke confidently.

They were all the leaders of their respective teams.

“That’s right!”

The middle-aged man who had a cold expression on his face revealed a faint smile.

“Haha, you guys are really trash. So many people only managed to obtain so little. Looks like I have the most!”

A young man laughed loudly as he walked forward and took out one jade glue after another from his interspatial ring.

“It’s Qi Lian. Qi Lian is very strong. I wonder how many he has obtained from this solo mission!”

“Definitely not less than ten!”

The surrounding youths looked at the long-haired young man enviously.

“One, two... eleven, eleven transcendent-level rank 1 jade glue!”

“Also, hiss, there are actually three transcendent-level rank 2 jade glue. He killed three piranhas of the same level in two days!”

“Awesome, as expected of Qi Lian!”

The crowd exclaimed in shock. Even the teacher was a little surprised, and his eyes were filled with admiration.

For a young man to be able to kill two vicious beasts of the same level in two days, it was already very impressive.

One had to know that the fighting strength of vicious beasts was not weaker than humans of the same level at all. In fact, they were even slightly stronger.

Killing three humans of the same level in two days at such a young age was considered not bad.

“Haha, I said that I should be the one who killed the most this time!”

Qi Lian heard the surrounding people and laughed arrogantly.

“Ha, Qi Lian, don’t be happy too early, Hehe!”

At this moment, a young man walked over and placed five transcendent-level rank 2 jade glue in front of his teacher with a smile. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“You... HMPH, Du Wen, what’s so great about it?”

Qi Lian’s expression changed when he looked over and he said with a dark expression.

“Hehe, nothing much. It’s just five transcendent tier 2 jade gels!”

The young man called Du Wen had a short stature and was rather delicate and pretty. However, at this moment, he said with a proud smile.

He was showing off his sharp edge!

“Hiss, amazing. Each one is stronger than the other!”

“Du Wen and Qi Lian are both well-known heaven’s favored sons in our holy sea town. They were able to kill so many ferocious beasts of the same level. Their abilities must be extraordinary!”

“Brother Du, you are really impressive!”

The surrounding young men were full of admiration. A few of them immediately flattered them.

“Hehe!”

When Wang Xian saw their arrogant looks, he shook his head in disdain.

“A piece of jade glue!”

He walked over and placed a piece of jade glue on the table.

The corpses of Piranhas were all resources. He would not take out too much jade glue. One was enough. It would be a waste to have too much!

“What? You came up with a piece of jade glue? No, it’s him. F * CK, it’s the Jade Glue of an extraordinary level 3 Piranha!”
