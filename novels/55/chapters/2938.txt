“What a rich energy!”

As soon as he entered the Life Experiment Treasury, a vast amount of energy rushed towards him. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“This is? A semi-finished product?”

When he entered, he looked around in astonishment.

!!

Inside the Life Experiment Treasury, there were many bottles and jars filled with plants and fruits.

They were wrapped in transparent liquid.

Even if they were placed in the entire bottle and jar, the majestic energy still spilled out.

“Dragon King, this seems to be a semi-finished mechanical product. The treasure energy in these bottles and jars has been broken down and fused with a biological metal. This is the special energy in the body of a robot!”

The Heaven Array approached a bottle and opened it to investigate.

“This should be the natural treasure of the entire machinery empire. It’s a pity that it has already been processed. It can only be absorbed by the Devouring Dragon!”

Wang Xian sized up the entire treasure house.

The treasure house was not big. It was about 50 kilometers, but there were many treasures in it.

These resources could create a mechanical army for the creator.

“Indeed, the devouring dragon will be able to improve crazily this time!”

The Heaven Array said softly.

“The information from the mechanical army should have been digested by the Devouring Dragon. Contact Prime Minister Gui, ao crab and the rest and ask them to come over and absorb the information!”

Wang Xian said to the heaven array with a smile.

“Yes!”

The Heaven Array nodded and took out the communication stone plate.

“Eh? This special space can actually block all kinds of signals!”

He looked at the communication stone plate and raised his eyebrows slightly. His body moved and he flew out. He tore open the space and passed the message to Prime Minister Gui.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

At this moment, the excited roars of prime minister GUI were endless.

Ten Devouring Dragons that were at least 30,000 meters in size were flying around.

Their faces were filled with excitement.

Around them, there were huge swallowing dragons flying around.

“They’ve expanded, Ao he and his group have expanded!”

Ba Qi and the rest couldn’t help but say.

“Damn, 1 million underlings, the weakest undying Emperor Level 7, Emperor level fighting power over 100, Emperor Level 39, Ao he is too enviable!”

The group of Dragon Palace leaders were all jealous.

The swallowing Dragon’s improvement this time was too strong.

“Weng Weng!”

“Hehe, the sky array sent a message!”

At this time, Prime Minister Gui smiled and took out his communication stone plate.

“Oh? Prime Minister Gui, what did the Dragon King Say?”

The group of Dragon Palace leaders looked over curiously.

“Ao he, lead your swallowing dragon underlings, we’ll go to the Dragon King immediately, there’s still a huge amount of resources there.”

Prime Minister Gui looked at the message and shouted at Ao Xie.

“Roar!”

“What? Prime Minister Gui, the Dragon King still has a huge amount of resources? Roar! We are ready to leave!”

Ao Xie’s excited voice sounded.

The other leaders of the Dragon Palace were even more envious of them.

“Damn it. After this upgrade, we will not only let ao Xie and the others destroy the chimei zone, but also let them unify the ancient heaven punishment zone. Let them go to the desolate land to search for treasures.”

Mo Sha and the rest said sourly.

“All members of the Dragon Palace, prepare to set off!”

Prime Minister Gui roared and led the Dragon Palace Army towards the center of the automaton Emperor Region.

Compared to a few months ago, the swallowing dragon race had undergone a terrifying evolution.

When they came, the weakest of the swallowing dragons was Level 4 undying fighter, and now the weakest was Level 7 undying fighter.

What was this?

A million swallowing dragons and the weakest at level 7, it was simply terrifying!

“Howl Howl!”

Excited roars came from the swallowing dragons, their huge bodies swaying.

The automaton region was their blessed land.

After over 20 hours of flying, they arrived at the Creator’s secret base.

Prime Minister Gui, ao crab, and the rest entered the soil and tore open space to enter the crack.

“Dragon King!”

Ao crab transformed into his human form and shouted excitedly.

His eyes were shining as he stared at this mechanical world. He almost drooled.

“Come over!”

Wang Xian’s voice rang out. The Devouring Dragons immediately flew over.

“Ao crab, this time, your devouring dragons have profited greatly. There’s still the body of the creator here. Most importantly, there’s also the energy core of the Creator!”

Heaven’s formation smiled and said to Ao crab.

“Roar!”

Ao crab could not help but let out a roar and flew over excitedly. The Dragons of devouring opened their mouths and followed behind him.

“Distribute the resources here and let the Dragons of devouring devour all of them. Ao crab, come over here!”

Wang Xian said to them.

“Dragon King!”

Ao crab flew to Wang Xian’s side and shouted with a smile.

“Feel the energy here!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he passed the mechanical heart to ao crab.

“This is?”

Ao crab took it and revealed an excited expression. “What a majestic energy. I feel that the energy contained in the giant’s body is much more than that of the creator. Huff! Huff!”

His face revealed a burning expression and his breathing was rapid.

“Can you upgrade another level?”

Wang Xian asked him.

“Dragon King, it should be about the same. It should be about the same!”

Ao crab said excitedly.

“Let’s upgrade it. There is another creator’s body in the castle over there. The energy contained in it is not less than that of the giant’s body.”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Yes, yes. I will allocate the resources here immediately and upgrade it immediately!”

Ao he quickly said.

“Dragon King, there are so many treasures in the Machine Royal Territory!”

Ao he flew over and said with a shocked expression.

The upgrade of the devouring dragon was already terrifying enough. He didn’t expect it to be able to upgrade to another level.

“The resources in the entire machine royal territory for more than a billion years should have been obtained by US apart from the ones that were consumed!”

Wang Xian smiled.

“After the devouring dragon has received a huge upgrade, our dragon palace can go out to conquer the chimei territory and destroy the demons there. By then, the Dragon Palace will be able to receive another upgrade.”

“Furthermore, the demon lair that we obtained from the chimei territory should be able to upgrade our Dragon Palace.”

Prime Minister Gui said happily.

“Let’s Let the devouring dragon upgrade first. After that, we will return!”

Wang Xian nodded.

The upgrade of Ao he and the rest could allow the dragon palace to retract the resources in the entire starry sky.

It could allow the overall strength of the Dragon Palace to be upgraded once again.

“This expedition to the Royal Armed Forces is the right choice.”

Wang Xian looked at the devouring dragons around him as they started to devour the mechanical world. A smile appeared on his face.

The more than one billion years of accumulation in the machine emperor realm were all attributed to the Dragon Palace.
