Chapter 1476: The feast of 1476

“Hiss! The heartless sword path sect! They have established the heartless sword path sect!”

“With their strength, they have become a second-rate top force!”

“Look! During the battle just now, none of the 200 swordsmen died. They have always been expressionless, cold, and indifferent. The heartless sword path sect lives up to its name!”

“Inviting all the forces within a thousand kilometers? What are they trying to do? Are they announcing their existence and making people submit to them? Or are they recruiting disciples? Or are they asking other forces to pay tribute to them?”

When Wang Xian’s voice rang out, all the family forces around sucked in a breath of cold air. They were discussing in shock. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

However, when some of the cities within a few hundred kilometers heard Wang Xian’s voice, all of them had shocked expressions on their faces.

The towering sky sword sect had been destroyed!

The forces that had been standing here for thousands of years had been destroyed!

Furthermore, this heartless sword path sect had invited all the forces within a thousand kilometers. What were they trying to do?

The families and clans in the cities as well as some sects and dynasties had astonished expressions on their faces.

However, a force that could destroy the towering sky sword sect had invited all the forces within a thousand kilometers. Who would dare not to come?

All the forces, including those dynasties, had to send people over.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian looked at the entrance of the towering sky sword sect and flew in.

However, when he was halfway there, he glanced at the few forces on the right. After hesitating for a moment, he continued flying in.

“Phew, phew, we didn’t make a move. Fortunately, this lord let us go. Fortunately, we are lucky!”

“When that Lord looked over just now, I thought we were going to die. Sob, SOB, I was almost scared to death!”

“Thank goodness that Lord is Magnanimous!”

When Wang Xian and the group of Golden Swordfish entered, the members of the Li family felt as though they had survived a calamity.

Just now, the Chiefs of the four forces had attacked Ren Xingchen.

If that Lord really wanted to argue with them, they would be dead for sure!

“It seems that the lord of the heartless sword path sect is not that ruthless. However, he looks so young. Did he take some kind of pill?”

The experts of the surrounding families whispered.

“Let’s come here in three days. I think it won’t be anything bad!”

The people from the aristocratic families took a deep look at the mountain peak.

Now, this mountain peak had changed its name to Heartless Sword Dao Peak!

“Ao Yao, lead your men to search the entire mountain peak and bring all the treasures over!”

“Ren Xingchen, prepare for the banquet in three days!”

Wang Xian ordered them.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

In the sky, Ao Yao led his men to search for treasures in the mountain peak.

The entire mountain peak was huge. It was about 3,000 meters tall. The most important thing was its height.

From the surface of the sea, it was only 2,000 meters tall. However, it was actually more than 20,000 meters tall.

The bottom of the sea also belonged to this mountain peak.

The location of the bottom of the sea was isolated by a formation. There were gemstones dotted on the bottom of the sea, making the entire seabed look dreamy and extremely beautiful.

After all, it was a powerful faction that had two experts at the seventh level of the Seethrough Void Tier and had stood tall for more than 4,000 years.

It was not something that the former blood flow empire could compare to.

The most spectacular part of the entire mountain peak was the location at the bottom of the sea.

“Dragon King, we have established the heartless sword path sect. Do you want to recruit disciples?”

Ren Xingchen hesitated for a moment before asking Wang Xian.

“Yes, we will recruit disciples according to the normal development of the sect. Inform all the nearby forces at the banquet in three days!”

“In addition, the main thing is to mobilize all the surrounding forces to look for Ling Jian ‘er!”

Wang Xian said with a twinkle in his eyes.

When he decided to destroy the towering sky sword sect, Wang Xian was prepared to use this place as a base for the dragon and Phoenix Empire to invade the vast region in the future.

In addition, he would establish a powerful force that could allow all the forces within a radius of 1,000 kilometers to help him find Ling Jian ‘er.

Killing two birds with one stone.

“Yes, sir. I’ll Go and prepare now!”

Ren Xingchen nodded and left immediately.

He had to prepare well for the banquet that would be held three days later for all the forces within a radius of 1,000 kilometers.

Wang Xian swept his gaze across his surroundings, from the mountain peak to the surface of the sea.

Following that, he flew towards the bottom of the sea.

There was no seawater under the isolation of the formation. There was a completely different world under the sea.

Furthermore, there was a spiritual spring at the bottom of the sea. This was not the small-scale spiritual spring that was discovered by the Dragon Palace. Instead, it was a large-scale spiritual spring.

A large-scale spiritual spring was completely locked by the formation. At the bottom of the spiritual spring, a holy land for cultivation was created.

Cultivating in a place with the densest concentration of spiritual energy would allow one to cultivate at a speed more than twenty times faster than the outside world. It was also a rare and precious place for cultivation.

Wang Xian came to the library of the Atlas Sword sect and started to read through them curiously.

There were all kinds of books in there. Reading these books would allow him to gain a deeper understanding of the vast region.

In the next two days, the entire vast region was close to the north flowing sea. There were more than fifty cities and five third-rate forces.

Such a dense group of powerful forces didn’t exist in the flowing sea area.

When all the forces learned that the heartless sword sect had destroyed the towering sky sword sect and was going to hold a banquet three days later, the entire area became lively.

The forces discussed among themselves.

That day in the north flowing sea, they saw the heartless sword sect destroy the disciples of the towering Sky Sword sect with their own eyes. Their faces were filled with excitement as they introduced them to the people around them.

As for the shuffling of the strongest forces in the vicinity, the other forces could only silently watch and obey.

It was their fault for being weaker.

On the third day, one by one, the forces rushed toward the heartless sword sect.

There were five third-rate forces. There were a total of thirty families, sects, and dynasties.

Unlike the flowing sea region, the vast area was more densely populated with humans. This was also to better combat the fierce beasts.

The Real Wilderness area was also very large. It was possible that there was not a single city within a few thousand kilometers, only ferocious beasts running around wantonly.

“I heard that the most powerful person in the heartless sword path sect is a young man. Are you sure it’s a young man and not an old man who took a special pill?”

“Who knows? I just heard that they came from the flowing sea region. I don’t believe that a small place like the flowing sea region would have such a powerful force!”

“I wonder why they invited us here. I hope it’s not a bad thing!”

In the afternoon, more than 30 forces of all sizes gathered in front of the Heartless Sword Dao sect’s mountain peak.

There were four to five hundred insightful void realm experts and five level six insightful void realm experts.

On their ships and airships, they carried boxes of gifts.

Although the heartless sword path sect didn’t say that they would bring gifts, it was impossible for them not to bring some gifts in hopes of befriending this new and powerful sect.

The young men who followed them looked forward with curiosity.

The cards of the towering sky sword sect had been removed, and only the words ‘heartless sword path sect’gave off a cold aura!
