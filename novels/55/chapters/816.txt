Chapter 817: 0818 crab general

Translator: 549690339

In the Hydra territory, the Hydra possessed the strength of a superior immortal.

This was an extremely terrifying race. However, with the strength of Wang Xian and the rest, they could completely surround and annihilate it.

By devouring this Hydra, his strength would be able to immediately complete the first transformation of the Divine Dragon.

“First, subdue or destroy the race of the killer crabs. Ao Yao, you lead the way!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao moved and directly rushed to a position on the left in front of him.

Everyone followed behind him.

Soon, Ao Yao stopped and vigilantly stared at the position in front of him.

The sea here was about 4,000 meters deep. At the bottom of the sea was a sandy land. Under the sandy land, there were huge holes.

Some of the holes were two meters in size, some were five meters in size, and some were seven to eight meters in size.

Beside these holes, there was a plant that looked like a cactus. The plant was black in color and looked like a poisonous substance. It emitted a black glow.

“This is the place!”

Ao Yao looked at the Dragon King, with a solemn expression, he said, “Dragon King, these killer crabs are hidden in the hole. The hole is very deep and their attack speed is very fast. They will arrive in an instant. Moreover, the black plant beside them will stick to its body when it comes into contact with it. It has a strong corrosive effect!”

“Are there many killer crabs in the infant stage?”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the area in front of him. Within a radius of more than ten kilometers, there were densely packed caves. It was no wonder that there were very few creatures in this area.

“There are quite a few. There should be a few dozen of them!”

Ao Yao replied.

“A few dozen?”

Wang Xian smiled and said, “Let’s Attack!”

“Leave it to us!”

Upon hearing Wang Xian’s order, Ao Qi moved his body. Three members of the thunder shrimp clan, Ao qi, leaped up.

The three immortal-level odd shrimps raised the hammers in their hands at the same time.

“Lightning, spread!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The hammers of lightning in their hands emitted a lightning glow. Streaks of lightning condensed on them.

“Crackle!”

The Hammers of lightning landed heavily on the ground. Streaks of lightning spread forward and spread across an area of ten kilometers in an instant.

The entire sandy ground turned blue.

“Splash!”

In an instant, the sound of flowing water could be heard from the ground. Claws that emitted black light crawled out of the hole, and the limbs of the killer crab that had furry and sharp thorns crawled out.

The killer crab had ten limbs, and each of its limbs was a terrifying weapon.

However, the killer crab that crawled out now had ten legs supporting its body, and it seemed like it was about to dance as it trembled.

Tens of thousands of killer crabs crawled out from the pit and were performing a break dance. The scene looked extremely comical.

“Sssss!”

At this moment, a strange sound was heard. Wang Xian looked over and saw a huge killer crab crawling out from the pit in the middle of the pit in anger.

It had ten legs that were twenty meters long and each leg was one meter thick.

However, what surprised Wang Xian was that his left leg was completely different from his right leg.

The right leg was like a sharp sword, shaped like a sword.

The left leg was like a piece of bamboo. At the end, it was a sphere.

It was as if the right leg could be used to fight, and the left leg could be used to support it.

“Let me destroy it!”

The belligerent ao Qitian moved his body and attacked the killer crab directly.

“Hualala!”

The cries of the leader of the killer crabs caused the killer crabs to slowly surround and attack him. Their legs were trembling as they looked at Wang Xian and the rest.

Ao Qi revealed a faint smile.

He waved the hammer of lightning in his hand toward the sky. Bolts of lightning instantly appeared in the middle of the water.

The other two immortal-level thunder prawns also waved their hammer of lightning. A bolt of lightning entered the sand once again.

The group of killer crabs that had not reached the immortal-level started to dance. This scene was very amusing!

“Bzzz!”

The leader of the killer crabs saw the look of his subordinates, and his face revealed a furious expression. He stared at AO Qitian with cold eyes, and his body stood up straight like a human.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

One by one, the limbs that were like weapons attacked AO qitian.

“Go to Hell, you little crab!”

A monstrous demonic flame rose from Ao Qitian’s body, and his figure became about eight meters long. The sea-pacifying needle in his hand directly smashed toward one of his limbs.

The killer crab looked like it was twenty meters long, but in fact, it was mainly the length of his ten limbs. His body was only about two meters long.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

However, when the sea-pacifying needle smashed toward it, the four limbs of the killer crab directly responded,

one was like a sword, and the other was like a rod. They crossed and blocked ao Qitian’s attack.

Then, the other six weapons attacked ao Qitian directly.

Six twenty-meter-long weapons attacked at the same time. It was as if six people were attacking at the same time. Ao Qitian could not block them at all.

“Roar!”

Ao Qitian roared. Dark red scales covered his entire body. Dense demonic qi surrounded his body and blocked the killer crab’s attack.

“Pa Pa Pa!”

However, the killer crab’s body attack frequency was very terrifying. Without breaking through the defense, it attacked again more than a dozen times in an instant.

Ao Qitian’s hands wanted to stop it, but he was entangled by the other four limbs.

“Hiss!”

The killer crab suddenly kicked backward, leaving a one-meter-long wound on AO Qitian’s body, and blood flowed out.

The most terrifying thing was that the fresh blood quickly turned black.

It was poisonous!

This terrifying killer crab had a terrifying speed.

“Roar!”

Ao Qitian roared to the sky, and dense demonic qi entered the wound directly. The huge wound healed at a terrifying speed.

“This killer crab’s attack is so strong. It’s a kind of sword, a kind of cross attack like a soft stick. It’s like the two mace in ancient China, and the mace is like a whip. There was a hero in ancient China who used the two mace, and one weapon in each hand would have a great advantage in battle. However, the killer crab is equivalent to ten weapons attacking at the same time, and even ao Qitian is at a disadvantage!”

“Furthermore, the limbs of this killer crab are similar to that of the Bone Dragon. It doesn’t have any elemental attacks, but it is extremely tough. It can withstand the attacks of the ocean-pacifying divine needles!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled.

This killer crab was indeed very abnormal. Its limbs were already so terrifying even without any elemental attacks. If he were to take it in as his subordinate, he would definitely be able to defeat it.

Wang Xian was intrigued. In the legends, there were shrimp soldiers and crab generals in the Dragon Palace. Now that there were shrimp, this crab could be taken in as well.

If he allowed them to cultivate the demonic dragon transformation and develop towards the direction of the Bone Dragon, they would definitely become a powerful subordinate.

There was a terrifying race in the universe, the insect race. They dominated with their terrifying numbers and powerful physical bodies.

The form of this crab general was similar to that of the insect race!
