Chapter 1303: Manager Qian of the third largest trading company in the world, 1304

“Hiss, this...”

“Tang Feng, Tang Yuan, and the rest have spoken. What’s going on? If we don’t handle this properly today, it might affect the relationship between the blood flow empire and the Heavenly Sword sect. It might even cause a huge dispute!”

“Who would have thought that a fox and that Wang Xian would actually cause such a huge incident!”

“Judging from the confessions of the teachers of the Divine Wind Academy, Zhang Fengying and Ling Jian ‘er, that Wang Xian might really have been framed!”

“Framed? Then why did the Vixen frame him? However, he didn’t even accept Ling Jian ‘er and that Zhang Fengying. He shouldn’t have taken a fancy to the Vixen!”

“It’s troublesome now. If they start a dispute, it will cause a huge sensation!”

When Tang Feng and Tang Yuan walked out and stared at Ling Jian ‘er with ugly expressions, everyone could not help but take in a breath of cold air.

The eyes of everyone in the surroundings flickered as they looked over.

A few experts from the heavenly sword sect also looked over. When they saw this scene, they shook their heads helplessly.

They did not go over. Everything would be handled according to how happy their young miss was.

Although today’s matter would affect their relationship with the blood flow empire, it would not affect them too much.

It was impossible for two powerful factions to start a war because of the conflict between the younger generation.

“No matter who it is, if they dare to say that they want to kill him or bully him, they will have to pay the price. It is already good enough for them to get lost. I did not say that killing them is already giving face to your blood flow empire!”

Ling Jian ‘er stared coldly at Tang Feng and Tang Yuan. She did not relent just because of their words.

This caused Tang Feng, Tang Yuan, and Tang Ling ‘ER’s expressions to turn extremely ugly. Their eyes flickered as they stared at her.

“Are the few of you going to get lost on your own, or do you want me to help you get lost?”

Ren Xingchen held a huge sword in his hand. His gaze was filled with killing intent as he stared at Tang Ling ‘er and the group of Heaven’s pride experts behind him. He immediately threatened them.

Arrogant!

Each of them was more arrogant than the last!

Regardless of whether you are a princess, a prince, or a heaven’s favorite, as long as you provoke Wang Xian, you must get out immediately!

Wang Xian looked at Ling Jian ‘er and Ren Xingchen speechlessly.

The personalities of these two people really made him speechless.

However, Wang Xian was slightly gratified towards them. It was not in vain for him to have saved their lives back then.

Such a friend could be made!

“Good, good. Ling Jian ‘er, we, the bloodshed empire, will remember what happened to Your Heavenly Sword sect today!”

Tang Ling ‘er glared at Ling Jian ‘er angrily.

This was the first time she was chased out directly by someone. This was the first time in the entire Liuhai region.

She would definitely return the humiliation today.

Tang Feng and Tang Yuan took a deep breath when they saw Ling Jian ‘er’s domineering manner. A cold glint flashed in their eyes.

They were a little unwilling to leave this place like this.

However, facing the current Heavenly Sword sect, they were no longer afraid of the blood flow empire’s forces. They were no longer afraid of the other party when they brought out their strength.

The two of them looked at each other and looked towards the back.

“How disappointing!”

Manager Qian was displeased when he saw the two of them looking at him.

He had originally planned to get to know more forces in the Liuhai region through Tang Feng and the others. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

However, he didn’t expect such a thing to happen.

What made him even angrier was that Ling Jian ‘er completely ignored him when he toasted to Ling Jian ‘er just now.

He even walked to the side of the young man and confessed to him. This made his expression extremely ugly.

He was a disciple of the Qian family of the third largest trading company in the world, but he was actually ignored by a lady from a faction in the Liuhai region.

This made him feel extremely humiliated.

As a result, his heart was filled with a faint killing intent towards Wang Xian.

“Harmony, Miss Ling Jian ‘ER. Harmony begets wealth. The cause of this matter is that your friend abandoned Miss Tang Ling ‘ER’s subordinate, and her subordinate was just a little angry. Nothing much happened? “Why did he chase Miss Tang Ling ‘er out? This isn’t good!”

“Since he abandoned a woman, then it doesn’t matter if he apologizes to her. As for Miss Tang Ling ‘er, it’s also for the good of her subordinate. This matter is just an apology from that young man!”

“Simply, let him apologize to Miss Tang Ling ‘ER, and this matter will be over!”

The slightly chubby young man, shopkeeper Qian, walked forward with a smile on his face and said indifferently.

Seeing the slightly chubby young man suddenly walk forward and hearing his words, the surrounding people were slightly stunned. Many people’s pupils constricted slightly.

“Oh? That young man is?”

The elder from the Heavenly Sword sect looked at shopkeeper Qian and looked at the middle-aged man beside him with a surprised expression.

The middle-aged man next to him looked at shopkeeper Qian’s figure with a slightly unpleasant expression.

“Elder, this is a bit troublesome. Shopkeeper Qian is the third trading company in the world in charge of the flowing sea region. He has a deep background and is not someone that any faction in the flowing sea region can provoke!”

The middle-aged man said with a grave expression as he looked at shopkeeper Qian, who was walking toward the center.

“The third trading firm in the World?”

The elder from the Sky Sword sect was slightly startled as he slowly frowned.

For the third trading firm in the world to be able to achieve such a feat, it was not an ordinary faction.

In reality, the third trading firm in the world represented an Allied faction.

The third trading firm in the world was controlled by the Qian family, which was famous for doing business. However, in reality, behind the Qian family, there were a few terrifying factions as shareholders!

The Qian family had only reached its current stage thanks to the support of the several terrifying factions behind it.

Any of the factions behind the Qian family could annihilate all of the factions in the flowing sea region.

They absolutely couldn’t afford to provoke them.

The old man hesitated for a moment, frowning as he looked at shopkeeper Qian. He had already made some decisions in his heart.

They could not afford to offend such a force. They could not afford to offend manager Qian.

“Is it manager Qian? It’s him, the person-in-charge of the Liuhai District of the third largest trading company in the world!”

“Hiss, manager Qian, everyone has overlooked such a huge figure!”

“What does manager Qian Mean? He wants Wang Xian to apologize to Tang Ling ‘er? This... he wants to help the people of the bloodshed empire, Tang Feng and the rest!”

“The third largest trading company in the world is a businessman. The blood flow empire is very important to them. Of course, they have to speak up for Tang Feng and the rest!”

“This is troublesome. This manager Qian is not someone the Heavenly Sword sect can afford to offend!”

Some of the people around who knew about manager Qian’s background looked at him in surprise. Their eyes were sparkling.

From his three sentences just now, it was obvious that he wanted to help Tang Feng and the rest. Furthermore, he did not agree to kick Tang Ling ‘er and the rest out.

However, manager Qian didn’t offend the Death Heaven Sword sect. He just wanted that young man to apologize!

“Hehe!”

Seeing manager Qian walking over, Tang Feng, Tang Yuan, and the rest revealed a faint smile.

They looked at Ling Jian ‘er and narrowed their eyes slightly.

“Ling Jian ‘ER, Wang Xian beside you. After apologizing, we will leave your Heaven Sword sect. To be honest, our blood flow empire disdains your Heaven Sword sect.”

“We are only here to give you face. Since you guys don’t give us face, there’s no need for us to accompany you guys here!”

Turning the tables!

The words of the two of them meant that it wasn’t Your Heavenly Sword sect that chased us out!

You guys don’t have the right to chase us out. We are the ones who look down on us here!

If it was an insult for Ling Jian ‘ER to ask them to scram, then it was also an insult for them to leave with disdain!
