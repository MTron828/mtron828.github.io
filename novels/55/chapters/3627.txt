3628 No one below the peak of 3627 was invincible!

“Huh?”

While the experts of the invincible zone were still discussing around the Heavenly River, Prime Minister Gui’s words stunned them!

The Dragon Palace was going to hold an auction!

Four or five innate supreme treasures?

This made them all look shocked.

“This… The Dragon Palace is actually going to auction innate supreme treasures, innate supreme treasures, innate supreme treasures that are hard to get even for us!”

“Not to mention us, even a true universe ruler would find it hard to obtain it. Out of the three, Tai Shui Demon King, the old scholar, and the Black Tower Wizard, at most two of them have a connate true treasure!”

“Connate true treasures can only be encountered by chance, but not sought after. A treasure of this level can definitely cause a life-and-death battle between universe rulers. The Dragon Palace actually took out four or five of them to sell. This is truly terrifying!”

“It is indeed terrifying. After all, they are innate true treasures. The Dragon Palace is simply too rich!”

“Including the six great races today, I heard that they have exterminated seven or eight top-tier high-level races. It is very terrifying!”

When the Great Beings of invincible region heard prime minister turtle’s words, they were shocked.

Innate true treasures were treasures that even a true universe master might not have!

Although the Mu God clan and the light giant clan each had their own true treasures, they were all true treasures.

However, these were their race’s most precious treasures, inheritance true treasures!

They were a true treasure that their race had built up over 20 billion years!

To only have one true treasure after such a long time, one could imagine how precious it was!

It was hard for one out of 100 old monsters in the invincible region to have a true treasure!

There might not even be more than ten connate cardinal treasures in the entire invincible zone!

However, the Dragon Palace was going to auction four or five of them this time!

It was extremely terrifying! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

After Prime Minister Gui spoke to the surroundings, he immediately took out the universal AI and made a statement in the name of the Dragon Palace!

Dragon Palace: in two years, the Dragon Palace will hold an auction in the Heavenly River and the Dragon Palace’s territory. There will be light, dark, metal-elemental connate cardinal treasures, as well as a large number of connate numinous treasures and other treasures!

After the announcement, Prime Minister GUI immediately distributed the resources!

After the announcement was made, all they had to do was wait!

However, when the news of the Dragon Palace was released, many people in the universal AI were dumbfounded!

What was going on?

What was going on?

Just a moment ago, the universal AI was saying that the Dragon Palace was going to be destroyed!

However, the Dragon Palace suddenly announced that they were going to hold an auction!

And they were going to sell their innate supreme treasures!

What was going on?

Wasn’t the Dragon Palace supposed to be attacked by the three old monsters of the invincible region and surrounded by more than 70 experts of the Saint Dragon King?

Some disciples in the Heavenly River said that the Dragon Palace was going to be destroyed!

When this news spread, everyone’s faces were filled with shock.

“What? The Dragon Palace actually killed three old monsters of the Invincible region and 71 universe overlords with level 3 combat strength?”

“Hiss, how is this possible? Didn’t they say that the supreme water demon king and the other two old monsters of the invincible region are not weaker than the true universe overlords? How could they be killed by the Dragon Palace? And how long has it only been?”

“No way! What… What happened in the Heavenly River? If the Dragon Palace didn’t announce that they were going to hold an auction, I wouldn’t have believed it!”

“This dragon palace is simply heaven-defying. Some of the strong disciples in the Heavenly River said that the Dragon Palace destroyed all the experts of the Monster King and the others within ten minutes. The weakest one is a universe dominator with level 3 battle strength. Such experts, other than the peak races, are the overlords of a region!”

“How many high-level races have universe overlord Level 3 warriors guarding them? However, more than 70 of such warriors were annihilated by the Dragon Palace!”

Terrifying!

Terrifying!

All the powerful disciples looked at the latest news with shock on their faces!

Universe Overlord Level 3 warriors were definitely overlords within the Split Heaven Primal Continent!

Even the powerful Hundred Cities Alliance only had one universe master with level three Combat Power, the Alliance leader!

A Universe Master with level three Combat Power would be an honored guest no matter where he went!

However, more than 70 of such level experts had been killed by Dragon Palace within 10 minutes!

Especially the three old monsters from the invincible region!

“Dragon Palace’s power is simply unfathomable. Among the high-level races, which one of them is a match for them? Even the technology world can’t do that, right? Dragon Palace is simply invincible below the pinnacle race!”

“Invincible below the peak race? I agree with that. The strength of the Dragon Palace is too terrifying. You have no idea where their bottom line is!”

On the universe AI, a powerful person commented!

Invincible below the peak race?

“A powerful person from the invincible region said that the Dragon King is invincible below the universe ruler realm!”

At this time, another message came from the universe ai!

An old monster from the saint’s bloodline murmured, “Is there really an invincible person in this world?”?

They also interpreted it as being invincible below the level of a universe master in the Dragon Palace!

Many experts agreed with this statement!

“The three old monsters from the Invincible Zone are no match for the Dragon King. The Dragon King can be said to be invincible!”

“I’m sure that the Dragon Palace has an 80% chance of reaching the peak of the race. The Dragon King can lead the Dragon God’s bloodline back to the peak of the race!”

On the universe’s AI, countless disciples of the race were discussing!

The battle at the Dragon Palace had completely exploded!

No one dared to look down on the Dragon Palace!

No race dared to look down on the Dragon Palace!

And the Dragon Palace was being called invincible below the peak by more and more experts of the race!

However, the Dragon Palace had destroyed the peak experts of the six races, the light giant of the Holy Dragon lineage, which caused the disciples of the six races to feel grief and fear!

And despair!

All the peak experts of their race had been killed!

How could they not feel despair?

Despair due to the strength of the Dragon Palace!

The Divine Mountain of Light, the lair of the Divine Dragons, was located below a divine mountain. There was an enormous divine kingdom.

This was the Divine Kingdom of the Divine Dragon King!

In the center of the Divine Kingdom, a bright divine dragon egg slowly cracked open, and a small divine dragon crawled out!

The eyes of this small bright divine dragon were filled with fear and anger.

He was the Sacred Dragon King, and he had witnessed the terror of the Dragon King with his own eyes!

Invincible!
