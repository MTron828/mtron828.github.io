“Kill, Kill, Kill!”

“Hahaha!”

“Shuang ER has undying level 8 battle strength, she will become the Vice Leader of the Bei Chuan sect, all the disciples, Kill!”

A berserk voice resounded within the abyss, bei Shuang was alone against an undying level 8 and 3 undying level 7. The leader rushed over from behind, shouting excitedly!

He rushed to bei Shuang’s side and fought with her!

“What? Bei Shuang has broken through again, she has undying level 8 battle strength!”

“Hiss, bei Shuang has become our deputy sect leader, this... undying level 8 battle strength, bei Shuang is less than 40,000 years old!”

“Emperor’s potential, emperor’s potential, hahaha!”

“Bei Shuang deputy sect leader Long live, Hahaha, kill Kill Kill Kill!”

The surrounding Bei Chuan sect disciples erupted in fighting spirit, shouting excitedly!

The bei Chuan sect only had 4 undying level 8 warriors, adding one now was a huge boost to the sect!

Most importantly, bei Shuang was too young, too heaven defying!

Breaking through consecutively, reaching undying level 8 in less than 40,000 years of age, such strength was terrifying!

This made all the disciples of the Bei Chuan sect extremely excited!

The stronger the Bei Chuan sect was, the more proud and confident they were as disciples!

“HM? Then bei Shuang’s strength has broken through again?”

At this moment, not too far away from them, beside the Bei Chuan Sect, was the sect from last month!

Some of the Warriors from last month heard the voices and their expressions changed!

At the front, a few warriors looked at each other, filled with shock!

“Looks like that proud daughter of the heavens has really returned!”

An elder said slowly!

“Undying Emperor Level 8 battle strength, it’s already grown up, much more terrifying than the proud daughter back then, this girl’s future is limitless! After this battle, we’ll pay her a visit.”

“HM, report to leader, this girl’s future is limitless!”

The few warriors said, after which they faced the abyss seed in front of them seriously!

“Leave it behind!”

“Haha, Alright, Shuang Er, you trap it, I’ll take care of it!”

Bei Shuang’s entire body was covered in frost, every attack contained terrifying frost energy!

Ice Seal, Frost, Ice Spike!

In terms of restraining, trapping and attacking, the frost energy was almost all rounded!

An undying level 8 abyss seed, in front of bei Shuang, it was greatly restrained, the Bei Chuan sect leader beside was a famous existence!

As a sect leader, within the same level, he was also a pinnacle existence!

“Die!”

“Hahaha!”

An hour later, in a carefree battle, the Bei Chuan sect leader teamed up with Bei Shuang to kill an undying level 8 abyssal seed!

This was the first undying level 8 abyssal seed to be killed in these few days!

“Howl Howl Howl!”

After the undying level 8 abyssal seed was killed, the surrounding abyssal seeds revealed a trace of fear, they roared and flew towards the back of the Abyss!

“Haha, they actually retreated, Haha!”

“Sect leader is Mighty, deputy sect leader Bei Shuang is too powerful!”

“That’s right, the ice and frost greatly restricted that undying level 8 abyssal seed, this is the first level 8 abyssal seed we’ve killed!”

The surrounding Bei Chuan sect warriors and disciples discussed excitedly!

Their gazes towards bei Shuang were filled with respect!

“All disciples retreat, these beasts don’t dare to attack for the time being!”

The Beichuan sect leader shouted happily!

The group of disciples retreated happily towards the planet!

At the same time, the group of warriors from last month saw the situation and were shocked!

Bei Shuang and leader Bei Chuan worked together and actually killed an undying level 8 abyss seed, such power was terrifying!

Today’s battle was even more shocking than the previous few days!

Frost goddess Bei Shuang worked together with leader Bei Chuan and killed an undying level 8 abyss seed!

The moment the news spread, it caused a huge commotion in the entire demon island’s AI!

Not long ago, he was able to fight against a Level 7 immortal king. Now, he was able to fight against a level 8 immortal king. This speed was too fast!

A Level 8 immortal king would be an elder in the sect!

The name of the Frost Goddess was once again like a bright star. It appeared out of nowhere and illuminated the entire Demon Island!

...

“Hehe, he rose up so quickly. The vice sect leader of the Bei Chuan Sect?”

Wang Xian had some understanding of bei Shuang’s matter from the AI. When he saw the comments about bei Shuang, a smile appeared on his face!

“With bei Shuang’s status in Bei Chuan sect, the rest of the matters will be easy to handle!”

He mumbled and a smile appeared on his face!

Long Feng was almost here!

“Dragon King, Long Feng has arrived!”

An hour later, just as Wang Xian expected, long Feng arrived!

“Let Long Feng stay here first. I’ll make a trip to the Beichuan sect!”

Wang Xian said to Ao Jian and immediately flew towards bei Shuang’s Planet!

The Dragon Palace had entered this abyss to fight against the abyssal seed with a group of forces. They had to inform the Beichuan sect first!

With bei Shuang’s current status in the Beichuan sect, this was a small matter!

...

“This disciple of mine is of great use!”

Wang Xian smiled!

Taking bei Shuang in as a disciple only taught her the cultivation method. The resources given to her were not much!

Moreover, the Bei Chuan sect would provide the resources for bei Shuang’s cultivation in the future. There was no need for Wang Xian to worry too much!

This was something he was more willing to see! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Whoosh! Whoosh

Soon, Wang Xian arrived at the planet where bei Shuang was located. He had sent a message in advance!

Bei Shuang was currently located in the middle of all the planets on the Northern Line of the Bei Chuan sect!

In a large hall on the planet, a group of over a hundred experts were sitting inside!

The experts in this hall were not only from the Bei Chuan sect!

The sect leader of the great sect, the ancient God dynasty, the leader of the Dragon Python group, or even the patriarch and elders were all here last month!

The main character in the hall was a girl, the goddess of ice and frost, bei Shuang!

Bei Shuang’s powerful rise shocked all the factions. The experts from the three major factions who were guarding the northern front immediately came over to befriend her!

Everyone laughed and chatted with bei Shuang, praising her generously!

This also made bei Shuang feel like she had been in the limelight for a long time!

It also made her feel a little uncomfortable!

“Huh?”

At this moment, when she saw the message sent by Wang Xian, she immediately stood up!

“Everyone, I’m sorry. My master is here. I’ll go and welcome him!”

Bei Shuang said apologetically to everyone!

“Oh? Of course, of course!”

“Haha, then we won’t bother you anymore. That person is really lucky to be able to take in such a good disciple like bei Shuang!”

“That’s right, that’s right!”

In the main hall, the experts from the various factions stood up and said with a smile!

Bei Shuang cupped his hands apologetically and flew out directly!

When the Bei Chuan clan leader and the others saw this scene, they frowned slightly and felt somewhat helpless in their hearts!
