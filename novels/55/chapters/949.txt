Chapter 950: 0951 had gotten a great bargain

The members of the Green Vine Chamber of Commerce saw more than twenty people walking over. The middle-aged man in the lead was emitting a thick murderous aura, and a satisfied expression appeared on his face.

“A five-star silver-rank mercenary group. You should meet our standards!”

A middle-aged man continued to say.

Vice-leader Ling of the Spirit Beast mercenary group next to them glanced at them and nodded slightly. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Huh? What?”

Everyone from the whale shark mercenary group was slightly stunned. They asked in astonishment, “Which two-star gold mercenary group?”

“It’s that Kid’s mercenary group. All the experts in the group must have died. Why Don’t you take a look at your own strength? You still want to accept our mission? You’re not qualified!”

The middle-aged man from the Ivy Club pointed at the backs of Wang Xian and the rest.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and turned around.

“Did you see that? It’s that kid. He’s still a little displeased!”

The few people from the Green Vine Chamber of Commerce saw Wang Xian’s back and said with a face full of mockery.

A hint of displeasure flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes as he looked at the whale shark mercenary group.

“This...”

The whale shark mercenary group felt like vomiting blood. They turned around and looked at the people from the Green Vine Chamber of commerce as if they were looking at a retard.

“The Immortal Phoenix mercenary group doesn’t meet the standard?”

The whale shark mercenary group’s leader asked in astonishment.

“Their mercenary group is called the Immortal Phoenix? There are twelve people and they are weak. Naturally, they are not qualified to accept our mission. I see that everyone’s strength...”

“This, if even the immortal Phoenix mercenary group is not qualified, we are even less qualified!”

The leader of whale shark shook his head at the members of the Green Vine Chamber of Commerce and interrupted the middle-aged man.

“What?”

The members of the Green Vine Chamber of Commerce were slightly stunned. They didn’t understand what the leader of whale shark had said.

“If even the immortal Phoenix mercenary group is not qualified, then no mercenary group in the entire holy sea town is qualified. I think you should stop issuing missions!”

Captain Whale Shark raised his voice slightly, cupped his fists, and then turned to leave.

“This... you...”

Everyone in the Green Vine Chamber of Commerce was completely stunned.

“Captain, are we not accepting this mission?”

“No. Just now, Captain Immortal Phoenix was obviously dissatisfied with the green vine chamber of Commerce. In order not to offend Immortal Phoenix, we don’t accept this mission!”

“That’s true. There’s no need to accept this mission. The Immortal Phoenix mercenary group is too crazy!”

The whale shark mercenary group immediately left and whispered to each other.

As for the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group, the people of Holy Sea town only knew that they had destroyed the mirage sea mercenary group and the Saber scar mercenary group. They didn’t know that in bridge forest town, they had used 100 million spirit stones to hire the dragon Spike to assassinate the Lin family of bridge forest town.

They had just returned from bridge forest town yesterday, but they had heard the discussions of the bridge forest town mercenary group.

Just because of a million middle-grade spirit stones, the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group had directly offered 100 million middle-grade spirit stones to kill the Lin family.

It was absolutely crazy.

Offending the Immortal Phoenix Mercenary Group for a mission was not worth it!

They would never do such a thing as they were cautious.

Moreover, this green vine chamber of Commerce didn’t even know about the immortal Phoenix mercenary group. He was also an idiot.

“F * ck, what’s Going On? Why are they so afraid when they hear the name of the Immortal Phoenix Mercenary Group?”

The faces of the people from the Green Vine Chamber of Commerce turned ugly. What the F * ck was going on?

It wasn’t easy for a qualified mercenary group to come here, and they just left?

The deputy leader of the Spirit Beasts frowned slightly and revealed a look of surprise.

“Are you guys here to accept the mission? I wonder if you guys will accept the mission here?”

Just as Wang Xian walked over from the position of the Chamber of Commerce, a voice was suddenly heard.

Wang Xian looked over and saw a woman looking at him.

The woman looked to be in her twenties and thirties. Her looks were not very outstanding, he looked at Wang Xian and the rest. “Although I didn’t hear what you guys said just now, I saw the level on the test stone plate. You guys have the ability to accept our mission!”

“Oh?”

Wang Xian smiled. “What level is the mission? How much is the reward?”

“A four-star silver-grade mission. The reward is 50,000 middle-grade spirit stones!”

The lady said to Wang Xian directly.

“50,000 middle-grade spirit stones?”

Wang Xian smiled but nodded nonetheless. “Alright, we’ll accept the mission!”

“Alright, we’re here with the business group, so we’ll set off together. We’ll set off tonight!”

The lady said to Wang Xian directly.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded. A four-star silver-grade mission of 50,000 middle-grade spirit stones was simply too little for him.

However, he had been rejected by a chamber of Commerce just now, which made him lose the intention to continue searching for missions.

Since it was on the way to Donghai City, he decided to treat it as a side trip!

“Alright!”

The lady nodded her head happily. “Do you guys still want to Go and prepare?”

“No need. We can just wait here. We will set off directly tonight!”

Wang Xian shook his head!

“Yes, alright. There are only seven or eight people in our chamber of Commerce and only three carriages!”

The woman said to Wang Xian, “When the time comes, we’ll follow the team of the Chamber of Commerce. If we’re lucky, we won’t encounter any danger!”

Wang Xian nodded at the side. He sat behind Ao Jian and the rest and waited.

“Father, Liuyan!”

After about two hours, the woman’s voice rang out.

“Hanhan!”

“Thank you for your classmate Liuyan this time. If it weren’t for her, we wouldn’t have gotten so many supplies. Hanhan, you have to thank Miss Jin properly!”

“Uncle, you’re too polite. Hanhan and I are like sisters!”

The voice of conversation sounded. The woman smiled and looked at her father and the girl beside her.

“Have you found the mercenary group?”

The middle-aged man asked the woman with a smile.

“We’ve hired them!”

The woman nodded. “Let’s Get Ready. We’ll set off soon!”

“Okay, okay, leave it to me. You and Miss Jin sit here and rest for a while!”

The middle-aged man touched the woman’s head.

“Liuyan, when I was looking for the mercenary group, I recruited a handsome guy, and he’s a very talented genius, right?”

“Handsome guy? Han Han, you’re really something. Are you looking for a mercenary group or a handsome guy? If your father finds out, he won’t beat you to death!”

“Hehe, the most important thing is that our family’s small business doesn’t pay a high commission. It’s rare to find a mercenary group, so I happened to find a group with an extraordinary tier 5 expert. Naturally, I went over to ask, but I didn’t expect it to be successful!”

“You’re really something. There’s a handsome guy over there. Let me take a look!”

“Keep your voice down. He’s Over There!”

The two girls chatted with each other while smiling. Zhou Hanhan pointed at Wang Xian and the rest who were sitting at the back.

“This...”

Jin Liuyan looked over. When she saw Wang Xian’s figure, her eyes immediately widened in disbelief.

He looked at his best friend and then at Wang Xian. He couldn’t believe it.

“They accepted your mission?”
