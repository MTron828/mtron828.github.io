Chapter 183: Nirvana

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

The cards were dealt! Totally!

Wang Xian was extremely exhilarated. Guan Shuqing did resist in the beginning, but she gave up.

She allowed him into her room.

Wang Xian was thrilled as he hugged Guan Shuqing fast and furious as soon as he came to her room.

The door was opened and closed in one go.

Subsequently, it was the most exciting moment for Wang Xian.

Even though it was his first time doing this, he had seen a few clips under the influence of Wang Dahai. At the very least, he was not a total noob.

After the shrill cries, it was the alluring moan.

At 11 pm, the moon was high in the sky, and the waves washed up onto the shores.

It was a beautiful night.

Be it outside or inside the villa, it was full of seductive glows and sounds.

However, at this time, two black figures were dashing towards the villas.

“This is the place. The one whom Young Master wants to kill is inside!”

“There are only three women and Wang Xian in the house. This lad has some luck with women!”

“Hmph, how dare a Miracle Doctor who is ranked eighteen provoke our Young Master Liu. Go to hell!” As the two black figures spoke, they moved in swift actions. With a leap, they entered the villa immediately.

“Kill them all!” A black figure looked into the villa and spoke in a murderous tone.

“Go!” The two black figures charged into the villa at a daunting speed.

Ring!

Suddenly, the bells beside Elder Fang rang without any warning when she was resting in her room.

“Someone broke in!” She immediately opened her eyes and dressed up. With a skip and an arm swing, she picked up her sword and walked out of her room.

She cast a glance at the door that was tightly closed at the side where Xiao Yu was resting. With some hesitation, she leapt to the third floor. “I should remind Xiao Yu’s brother!”

But when she jumped into the room, she heard the seductive voices within the room.

Along with that, it was conversations like, “No, stop it,””I’m dying,” and “Let’s change to another position.”

Elder Fang stared with her eyes wide open. Subsequently, her face turned red instantly.

Ring!

At this time, the bells in her hands rang again. She could not stay here any longer. With a leap, she jumped down and walked to the entrance of the villa.

“Who is it? How dare you barge in like this!” Elder Fang drew her long sword with a slightly blushed face as she spoke coldly to the two black figures in front of her.

“Hur?” I did not expect to see a Martial Artist here!” The two black figures narrowed their eyes and launched their rapid and fierce attack.

“Seeking your own death!” Elder Fang had a slight change in her expression. She wielded her long sword and darted out at the two figures.

“Level 8 Martial Artist!” Both black figures were shocked. They exchanged eye contact and wielded the daggers in their hands for another attack.

The two black figures were Level 8 Martial Artists too.

Xiao Yu, who was deep in her sleep, did not know her Master was battling with someone outside. All the more, Wang Xian was ignorant about it.

He was also battling at that moment. If he was not battling, he could have easily detected the happenings outside.

Elder Fang and the two black figures fought for twenty minutes.

Eventually, they left the place quickly with bewilderment.

The woman possessed a combat skill that was way beyond their expectations.

Whoo!

“Who are they? All their strokes were ruthless, and they were out to kill!”

Elder Fang knit her eyebrows slightly as she looked to the distance. The two black figures had long since disappeared in the dark.

She pondered for a moment and went back to the villa. In a move, she jumped directly to the second floor. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Standing outside, she could still hear some voices from upstairs. Elder Fang blushed once again. She took a deep breath and went back to her room.

Third floor, within Wang Xian’s room.

An hour passed...

Two hours passed...

Three hours passed...

Guan Shuqing felt numbness in her entire body as she was almost blacked out.

“I can’t go on, Xiao Xian. I... I really can’t.” Guan Shuqing was almost tearing up as she pleaded.

Wang Xian was slightly stunned, “I haven’t... haven’t...”

“Xiao Xian, I really can’t go on. My lips are swollen!” Guan Shuqing shook her head with slight terror.

He was too strong, and he lasted for too long. Simply formidable.

Wang Xian gave a bitter look on his face. He was not expecting himself to be so formidable. After almost four hours, he was still energetic.

Could it be because of his Dragon nature?

He frowned slightly. With a bitter face, he said, “Okay, Shuqing. It was my fault today.”

As Wang Xian looked at the pale-looking Guan Shuqing, his heart ached as he consoled her.

“No, it was my fault. I didn’t...” As Guan Shuqing spoke, her voice got softer and softer. Eventually, she fell asleep.

“Well, it’s not good to be too strong either!” Wang Xian sighed as he pulled the quilt at the side over Guan Shuqing!

Bam!

What he did not notice was, something from the table dropped onto the bed as he pulled the quilt.

It was a piece of blood-red stone, and the stone landed around Guan Shuqing’s thighs.

There was a trace of blood on the bed sheet. When that piece of blood-red stone fell on it, it slowly emitted a red glow.

“I shall take a shower!” Wang Xian stood up and walked to the bathroom.

When the bathroom door was closed, the red stone gave off an immense amount of glow which encompassed Guan Shuqing slowly.

A virtual image of Suzaku flashed and disappeared shortly.

The Suzaku’s Blood Essence was gone too.

Guan Shuqing, who was lying on the bed, did not know that she was undergoing her Nirvana.

The next morning, Wang Xian looked at Guan Shuqing, who was still sleeping. He used his Azure Dragon Energy to heal some of her wounds. Subsequently, he came downstairs quietly.

“Brother, where is my sister-in-law? Get her to have breakfast with us!” said Xiao Yu when she saw Wang Xian walking down.

“She’s still sleeping. We can have it first.” Wang Xian giggled and sat down to have his breakfast.

“Oh, are you going out today?” Xiao Yu continued to ask.

“I don’t think so. We should be taking a rest!” Wang Xian shook his head when he thought of Guan Shuqing.

Elder Fang, next to him, looked at Wang Xian discreetly as she ate her breakfast quietly.

After breakfast, Elder Fang suddenly instructed Xiao Yu, “Xiao Yu, go upstairs now. I have something to talk to your brother about!”

“Hur?” Xiao Yu hesitated and was confused for a while before she nodded and headed upstairs.

Wang Xian looked at Elder Fang with questions.

“Yesterday, someone snuck into the villa. They were two Level 8 Martial Artists with strong murderous intention!” Elder Fang told Wang Xian sternly. “I’m afraid there will be stronger ones next time, and I won’t be able to stop them!”

After hearing what Elder Fang said, Wang Xian was stunned. With a frown, he asked, “Are they after me?”

Elder Fang nodded her head slowly. “I think so!”

Wang Xian’s eyes turned cold. “Leave this to me. I hope they’ll return again!”

Elder Fang was slightly stupefied as she fixed her gaze on Wang Xian without uttering any words.
