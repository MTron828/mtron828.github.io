Chapter 427: Watching Them Getting Killed One After Another

“Inborn Expert, that juvenile is an Inborn Expert!”

All the surrounding people noticed the spooky sapphire flame exploding out from Xiao Ran’s body, and they were startled when the imposing aura spread across the entire area.

That juvenile who looked so young was actually an Inborn Expert.

How old could he be judging from his appearance? Fifteen or sixteen? Everyone was quite certain that this juvenile was not even eighteen!

“How is there such a young Inborn Expert? He’s even younger and a level higher than Xiao Fan! An Inborn!”

“Unbelievable. Totally unbelievable. How could there be such a young Inborn Expert in this world?”

All the surrounding Xiao Clan’s disciples and Inborn Experts were appalled as they watched Xiao Ran, who exploded all his strength.

“What? Such powerful strength, but how can this be?”

The old man from the Liang Family who sneaked an attack was aghast by the aura exploded out by Xiao Ran all of a sudden.

The sword was blocked by that juvenile. But to his horror, his sword was broken in half without his knowing. Only when the broken sword fell to the ground was a shrill sound heard.

“Inborn Spiritual Weapons, spooky Heavenly Flame!”

The old man from Liang Family recalled what the skinny old man had said and turned gloomy immediately.

“Oh no!”

When the skinny old man saw the Clan Leader making a sudden strike, his expression was totally different as great despair surged in his heart.

He told the Clan Leader about the Inborn Spiritual Weapons and the Heavenly Flame. Still, he had not mentioned that they were no match for that juvenile even when he and the fat old man joined hands.

“Clan Leader could have the wrong impression that I was crippled by Miracle Doctor Wang, but he didn’t know that I barely escaped from that brat!”

Even though the Clan Leader was stronger than any one of them, the skinny old man and the fat old man were stronger when they joined hands.

“Gone, the Liang Family is completely finished!”

The skinny old man revealed a miserable and desperate expression on his face as he looked at Wang Xian and the surrounding fifty Inborn Experts. He knew that he would never avenge himself.

With trembling hands, he pulled out a dagger from his arms.

This dagger was prepared to slaughter Miracle Doctor Wang.

“I don’t want to witness the downfall of Liang Family.”

The skinny old man gazed at the dagger in his hands with malevolence.

Poof!

He stabbed the dagger right into his heart.

Bam!

His body fell straight to the ground.

“Old Gu!” exclaimed the horrified experts from Liang Family when they saw Old Gu commit suicide.

Boom boom!

At this time, the entire region was sealed off by an imposing aura.

Everyone spun around. To their horror, they realized the entire region was blockaded by the fifty Inborn Experts who exploded their Inborn aura.

To the air and to the ground!

Every expert in Xiao Clan was petrified by this.

“Stay and witness this. Those who deserve to be killed will die! We’ll not strike at unrelated people.” Wang Xian plainly warned everyone on the spot.

People from Xiao Clan grimaced. Since when did the almighty Sacred Clan, Xiao Clan, have to be forced to stay put and watch their people being killed?

Since the establishment of the Xiao Clan, there was never a time that they felt so sullen.

But looking at the fifty Inborn Experts, they did not dare to make a single move at all.

Ah!

Just then, a cry of horror suddenly cut through the air.

Everyone hurriedly looked over only to see a bluish flame sticking to the arm of Liang’s Clan Leader. The flame was inextinguishable as it quickly spread to the rest of the body.

“No!”

Liang’s Clan Leader picked up the broken sword with trepidation as he wielded it at his own arm.

Sss...

“The Clan Leader of Liang Family was an Inborn for thirty years. He might not be a Pinnacle, but it should have been soon. Look at how he was trounced!”

“With Inborn Spiritual Weapon and Heavenly Flame...not many Inborn Experts can compete with this combination.”

“How can that Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown be so scary? He is already imba. Now, he actually coaches another domineering existence. Moreover, he’s an Inborn Expert!”

Everyone in the Xiao Family had mixed expression.

“Father!”

The wealthy-looking lady let out a despairing cry when she saw her father axing his own arm.

“Clan Leader! Go to hell, brat!”

Liang’s Inborn Experts were horrified as they lunged murderously at Xiao Ran for an attack.

Boom!

Instantly, Mo Qinglong, Mo Yuan, and the other three Dragonians charged at that five Inborn Expert when they made their moves.

Average Half-Step to Dan Realm Experts could fight against seven to eight Inborn Experts. Possessing the strength of a Half-Step to Dan Realm, Mo Qinglong could fight dozens of Inborn Experts. Killing one was chicken feet to him.

Ah!

After the Dragonians took the Devil’s Skeletal Pills, their domineering bloodline had upped their strength such that they were comparable to Pinnacle Inborn Experts. Mo Yuan was even on par with an average Half-Step to Dan Realm.

Instantly, those five experts who had tried to strike were killed at once!

Blood spattered everywhere!

When the old man of Liang Family heard the screams of his people, he was devastated. With resoluteness in his eyes, he glared at Xiao Ran. “I’m not convinced, you little bastard!”

His body began to burn with blood gushing out of his body, looking horrible.

However, the aura exuded from his body was even scarier.

Growl!

The Clan Leader of Liang Family let out a beast-like cry!

“This is...! This sorcery is known as the Flash of Glory. As more fresh blood burns, more powerful energy will be exploded. The self-consumption is quite high. Hence, it is a taboo technique. Liang Qianguo is burning away all his life!”

When the old man in the air witnessed the scary sorcery of Liang’s Clan Leader, his face changed. “For the next ten seconds, he will explode the strength of Half-Step to Dan Realm!”

“Using his own Blood Essence as the trigger to perform Flash of Glory, I’m afraid that brat with Inborn Spiritual Weapon and Heavenly Flame cannot block this!” said an old man with a solemn look. Exchanging life for ten-second glory, the Flash of Glory was domineering.

The aura exploded by Liang’s Clan Leader forced the surrounding people to take a step back as horror filled their eyes.

“Kill him, kill him!”

Xiao Fan, with bloodshot eyes, stared at Xiao Ran when he saw his grandfather casting the taboo sorcery.

“Igniting his own blood away just for ten seconds of Glory. Quite impressive.”

Upon seeing the old man from Liang Family trying to exchange a life for a life, Wang Xian displayed a faint smile and said, “Old Mo, lend a hand to Xiao Ran!”

“Yes, Young Master!”

As soon as Mo Qinglong spoke, he appeared before Xiao Ran, like a phantom. With a cold smile, he stared at the Clan Leader of Liang Family.

“Grandpa Mo!”

Xiao Ran was paled by the oppressing aura as he gave a weak cry.

“Mm, Xiao Ran, not bad. I’ll stop him for ten seconds for you while you kill him!”

“Darmn!”

The surrounding experts from Xiao Clan twitched their lips aggressively when they witnessed this.

The entire fu*king operating series is distinct. When someone besieges you, your master will take them out. If you’re not a match, your master will get someone to replace you. Those that can’t outfight you, you can kill instantly!

This is an apparent shielding of them, suppressing them by force.

Yet, as the Sacred Clan, all they could do was watch their shameless act as they performed the massacre!
