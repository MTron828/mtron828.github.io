Chapter 450: Dragon Sect’s Killing Order (1)

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

Strong aura shot through the skies and ominous clouds tumbled.

The terrifying aura of each dragonian rose from their bodies into the sky and formed an insane devil dragon circling and rumbling.

It was as though they were announcing to the world that the Dragon Sect had descended onto the world!

Dragon in the sky!

Shocking, frightening and unbelievable!

The surrounding crowd was dumbfounded and their bodies shivered violently as they stared at the dragonians with terrifying auras.

Fifty dragonians and fifty powerful Inborn experts.

All of them were kneeling before that young man, Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown.

An invincible vibe filled every corner of the arena of the Outstanding Young Heroes Competition.

“Those dozen-plus young men are... are all the subordinates of Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown!”

“Their auras are insanely powerful! Fifty Inborn experts! We are talking about fifty Inborn experts!”

The surrounding crowd was greatly shaken. They stared with disbelief at the fifty dragonians who were kneeling on the floor and were clearly panic-stricken.

“Fifty Inborn experts and a dozen or so of them have defeated all the supreme talents!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Over ten supreme talents were overwhelmed. The Outstanding Five Devil Dragons and the Seven Dragon Stars are all subordinates of Miracle Doctor Wang. Their strength could even be considered to be amongst the upper echelons of Inborn experts. This... This is simply frightening!”

Everyone’s eyes opened wide as they mumbled.

At this very moment, the young lord of Sea Serpent Island and the group from the Qiao Clan stared at the fifty Inborn experts kneeling before Wang Xian in disbelief.

“This cannot be possible! This cannot be possible!”

The young lord of Sea Serpent Island, Qiao Fuzi, and the rest were a little out of sorts. There were fifty Inborn experts and these experts had just defeated them a while ago.

All of them were the subordinates of Miracle Doctor Wang.

And now, Miracle Doctor had announced the establishment of his Sacred Sect.

Sacred Sect! He just established a Sacred Sect.

Moreover, it’s an incomparably strong Sacred Sect!

They swallowed their saliva and their eyes were filled with fear. At this moment, with just thirty Inborn experts on their side, they were going to go against a Sacred Sect.

A Sacred Sect that had fifty Inborn experts.

“The Dragon Sect will be established today. First, I’m going to announce that those who offend our Dragon Sect shall die!

“Dragon Sect Killing Order: Annihilate all who are going against us!

“After which, annihilate their families, including the Sacred Clans and Sects!”

Wang Xian looked at the fifty dragonians that were kneeling before him. He lifted his head and turned to the young lord of Sea Serpent Island and the group of experts from the Qiao Clan. Gradually, he revealed an eerie smirk.

“Now that I have said what I wanted, you guys can come and kill me now!”

Wang Xian’s lips curved into a smile and he looked at them with contempt.

“Those who offend our Dragon Sect shall die! Those who offend our Dragon King shall die!” the fifty dragonians shouted loudly in unison.

Mo Qinglong stood up and the crowd of dragonians behind him followed. Their eyes were fixed on the young lord of Sea Serpent Island and the group behind him.

“Follow me to kill our enemies!”

“Kill!” Mo Qinglong instructed with killing intent, and the crowd of dragonians responded.

Rumble!

Instantly, devilish aura blocked out the entire sky and the devil dragon roared loudly. Without a moment of hesitation, Mo Qinglong and the group of dragonians charged towards the enemies.

“No, no. We are backing out. We are backing out!”

“It was Medical Saint Sect who issued the Medical Saint Sect’s killing order. It has nothing to do with us. Our Wu Family is backing out. We are backing out!”

When the eight forces saw the group of dragonians charging towards them, they were filled with horror.

Those were fifty Inborn experts. Moreover, they were all existences that could match Pinnacle Inborn experts. Even though they had thirty Inborn experts, they wouldn’t be a match at all.

Completely and thoroughly overwhelming.

It was especially so for the Inborn supreme talents that had fought with the dragonians previously. They knew clearly how terrifying these dragonians could be.

While fighting in the arenas, they clearly understood that they were a far cry from them. Now that the dragonians were going for their lives with the intent, they would undoubtedly be slaughtered!

The people from the eight forces were flabbergasted and overwhelmed with fear.

Even the group of four from the Qiao Clan were horrified.

“Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown, our Qiao Clan is backing out. Since you have established a Sacred Sect, our Qiao Clan wouldn’t be willing to make you our enemy!” a middle-aged man from the Qiao Clan shouted immediately.

“Spare no one!” said Wang Xian coldly.

“My father is the second strongest man in the Underworld. Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown, are you sure you dare to kill me?”

When the young lord of Sea Serpent Island saw the group of dragonians with terrifying vibes, he also felt fear.

Just a while ago, two of these dragonians had defeated the two supreme talents from Devil Corpse Palace and Devil Spirits Temple. The strength of those two was just a notch weaker than him.

Yet, there were even stronger existences within this group.

“None of you are getting away after offending our Dragon King!” Mo Qinglong responded to the young lord of Sea Serpent Island with killing intent.

Sss!

The surrounding crowd was shocked and cold sweat broke out on their foreheads. Once again, they retreated.

“He’s going to kill the people from the Qiao Clan and the son of the Lord of Sea Serpent Island. Miracle Doctor Wang... He’s simply...”

“He’s no longer called Miracle Doctor Wang. We should be addressing him as the Dragon King. To establish a sect at twenty years old and become the leader of a Sacred Sect, his achievements are unmatched throughout history!”

“The Dragon King would consider one’s background when he decides to kill? Just think about the Elders of the Sacred Followers Guild and the disciple of Medical Saint Sect. He would definitely not stop for the Lord of Sea Serpent Island or the Qiao Clan. Didn’t the Dragon King say that he’s going to annihilate their clans regardless of whether they are from a Sacred Clan?”

“The Sect Leader of a Sacred Sect... A twenty-year-old leader of a Sacred Sect... Moreover, he is the founder of the sect... How terrifying!”

The crowd was shocked to see the dragonians charging ahead, brimming with killing intent.

All of them could feel cold sweat breaking out on their backs.

He didn’t care if you were from a Sacred Clan or if you were the son of the second strongest man. He would just kill you without reservations.

“Young lord, please escape as quickly as you can. We will hold them here!”

the two middle-aged men who were standing beside the young lord of Sea Serpent Island said in a hurry and with resolve.

“Uncle Ma, Uncle Bei!”

The young lord of Sea Serpent Island was astonished and stared at the two middle-aged men bitterly.

“Quick! Run!”

When the two middle-aged men saw Mo Yuan and Mo Qinglong attacking them, they were fearful and immediately charged ahead to stop them.

“All of you will die!”

Mo Qinglong had a hideous expression on him. As he waved his arm, his palm transformed into an incomparably terrifying devil dragon claw.

His palm was over a meter long and was much more terrifying than the two dragonians previously.

“If you dare to kill the son of our Lord, our Lord will not let you off!” the two middle-aged screeched loudly. Water flowed rapidly on their bodies and formed various vortexes.

Each vortex was five meters wide and soon the stones on the ground were lifted.

“Half-Step to Dan Realm! They are Half-Step to Dan Realm experts!” the surrounding crowd was stunned once again.

Tsk!

However, Mo Qinglong and Mo Yuan weren’t afraid at all as they charged towards the two middle-aged men.

“It doesn’t matter if you are Half-Step to Dan Realm experts! Both of you will still die today”

Arrogant words came from them. The aura that they were emitting was causing the crowd to shiver in fear.

That domineering black devilish aura was truly too frightening.

“It’s over, it’s over!”

When Mo Qinglong and Mo Yuan released their auras, the people from the other eight forces were devastated.

As they saw the remaining dragonians charging towards them, they couldn’t help but feel deep regret!
