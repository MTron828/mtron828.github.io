Chapter 74: First-grade Restaurant vs Longxuan Restaurant (End)

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

The old street was more buoyant than normal today. It was especially so in the vicinity of First-grade Restaurant.

Just a while ago, all the traffic was gathered at the well-decorated entrance of Longxuan Restaurant. However, at this very moment, it looked a little deserted.

“This is crazy. This is crazy! First-grade Restaurant is full right now. I couldn’t even squeeze in if I wished.”

“I was still thinking of going to take a look at the one-headed abalone. I have never seen a one-headed abalone in my life.”

“One-headed Abalone, two-headed abalone, Atlantic Bluefin Marlin, Chinese Bahaba fish, Yellow Croaker Fish and several precious ornamental arowana! First-grade Restaurant’s promotional activity is truly shocking.”

“First-grade Restaurant truly deserves its name. However, Longxuan Restaurant is in an embarrassing situation now. They have been publicizing fervently and even invited a star over. During the opening speech, they even claimed to be much better than First-grade Restaurant. This is simply a slap to their own face!”

“Yeah, a slap to their own face. Longxuan Restaurant publicized that everything is going at half price but exclude two-headed abalone, Atlantic Bluefin Marlin and some top-quality ingredients. However, everything is going at half price at First-grade Restaurant. First-grade Restaurant is clearly to take a loss with each sale!”

“This is a contest between First-grade Restaurant and Longxuan Restaurant but it seems like Longxuan Restaurant has been handed a complete defeat!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

At the entrance of Longxuan Restaurant, some customers took a glance at Longxuan Restaurant. They shook their heads and walked towards First-grade Restaurant just a short distance away.

Director Xie was shivering in anger while standing by the side and hearing their conversation. He gritted his teeth and clenched his fist tightly.

Defeat. Utter defeat!!

From the beginning to the end, the boss of First-grade Restaurant had never shown his face. And from the beginning to the end, First-grade Restaurant had never done any publicity.

Relying on just strength, First-grade restaurant had completely rolled over Longxuan Restaurant.

“How can this be possible? How did he get his hands on such precious seafood!”

Director Xie’s eyes were filled with disbelief.

He thought that he was already great to be able to get two-headed abalone and Atlantic Bluefin Marlin. However, just a simple comparison and it was clear that he was far from it.

“Director Xie, we... We...” The middle-aged manager of Longxuan Restaurant walked out and stammered with sorrow.

“Damn it!” Director Xie turned his head over and stared at the middle-aged man with murderous intent. “Didn’t I ask you to investigate the background of the boss of First-grade Restaurant? Didn’t I ask you to keep a lookout of their actions? These are the results of your investigation?”

“Director Xie, this really isn’t my fault. I had not expected this either. They only brought out these ingredients last night. At that time, we were having the celebratory feast!” the manager said righteously.

Celebratory feast!

When Director Xie heard these words, it felt full of mockery. Celebratory feast? A celebratory feast for this darn outcome?

“Brother, what should we do?” the young man from the side walked over and asked Director Xie with a face of sorrows.

“After investing close to $20 million, we can’t just let it be!” Director Xie clenched his fist tightly as a violent look flashed past his eyes.

The young man was taken aback but soon revealed the same expression. “Brother, I also feel that we shouldn’t just let this go. brother-in-law’s strength could be considered really strong in Rivertown. Should we look for him?”

Director Xie took out a cigarette and lit it. “I’ll go make a call.”

“Longxuan Restaurant will operate as planned. The victory of this showdown will belong to us.”

Director Xie sneered at the people around and headed directly to the office in Longxuan Restaurant.

The surrounding members of the media and publicity personnel took a look at Longxuan Restaurant before looking at First-grade Restaurant just a short distance away. Suddenly, they were lost as to how to write their articles.

Lin Qingying also looked inquisitively at First-grade Restaurant and her eyes were shimmering.

“Boss, we have succeeded. There’re barely any customers at Longxuan Restaurant and we have a full house right here. There’re still a lot of people waiting to come in to take a look!”

At this moment, Manager Huang spoke excitedly to Wang Xian within the office in First-grade Restaurant.

“As expected!”

Wang Xian’s lips curved slowly into a smile. “Since we have started the activity today, we better do it well. This will be tough on the employees. Get something good for lunch!”

“It’s not tough. It’s not tough. After this incident, it wouldn’t be easy for Longxuan Restaurant to get up again. On the contrary, with the seafood that boss had brought over, our business would only get better and better!” Manager Huang said joyously.

“Definitely! Oh right, Manager Huang. Reserve a private lounge for me tonight. I’ll like to invite some friends over for dinner.” Wang Xian said to Manager Huang.

“Alright, Director Wang.” Manager Huang nodded his head.

“Xiao Xian, you are really awesome.” The moment Manager Huang left, Guan Shuqing looked at Wang Xian with total respect.

“Haha, that’s a given.” Wang Xian smiled satisfactorily.

It was a little beyond his expectations to be able to win this showdown so easily.

Although he brought over quite a substantial amount of top-quality ingredients from the ocean the last few days and Longxuan Restaurant was miles away from First-grade restaurant, Longxuan Restaurant shouldn’t have been defeated so utterly.

However, their mistakes were on the discounts given and that they were too petty about the discounts.

First-grade Restaurant was also providing 50% off like Longxuan Restaurant. However, First-grade Restaurant’s 50% discount was on all ingredients.

As for Longxuan Restaurant’s 50% discount, it did not include those top-quality ingredients. Besides that, they were still emphasizing how extravagant they were at their opening ceremony. In the end, this became a tight slap on their own faces.

Comparing would only reveal one’s shortcomings.

If Longxuan Restaurant did not compare themselves with First-grade Restaurant, they were indeed really awesome.

However, in a simple comparison, the difference between them was stark.

Even Wang Xian had not expected that the arrogant Director Xie would be such a scrooge.

However, Wang Xian was able to do so because these top-quality ingredients did not cost him anything as he caught them from the seas. However, Director Xie had to spend real cash to purchase his ingredients!

Wang Xian lied on the chair leisurely and was smiling as he witnessed the rise of First-grade Restaurant.

What happened on Old street today was soon spread to the majority of Rivertown.

Many group chats, Weibo, chat groups and forums were discussing First-grade Restaurant.

The reputation of First-grade Restaurant had also quickly spread to other cities as it became sensational over the internet.

In this era, a Chinese Bahaba fish would be enough to make the headlines, let alone a restaurant in possession of such a range of top-quality ingredients.

As for Longxuan Restaurant who had been publicizing fervently over the past few days, they had now become the joke.

A showdown ended with Longxuan Restaurant’s complete defeat!

Late at night, some media houses who caught the news carried their cameras over to First-grade Restaurant to visit the hottest restaurant in Rivertown.

Wang Xian saw it from his office. After which, he sent Manager Huang over to receive them.

When it came to interviews from the media, Wang Xian was still very willing to accept them. This was a very good way to achieve publicity.

“Let’s go and try the food of First-grade Restaurant. More importantly, have a taste of the legendary fish gelatin from the Chinese Bahaba fish that is rumored to be a great beauty supplement!”

“Qinying, First-grade Restaurant is probably full today!”

“It’s fine. With this face of mine, the boss would definitely give us a table. Hehe, we might even get it for free!”

At the entrance, Lin Qingying wore a huge face mask and entered First-grade Restaurant with her assistant.
