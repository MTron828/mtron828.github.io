2595 2595 god King level eight abyss species

“Usually, the abyss species are led by a leader and a group of underlings. The situation in this huge peak is a little different!”

“From the initial attraction to now, there are more than a dozen types of abyss species. It means that they are not of the same race!”

“There is only one race in the magma below this huge peak!”

Wang Xian stood at the top and looked. There was an abyssal race in the lava with a dark red body!

The dark red abyssal seed was about a thousand meters in size and had a pair of horns. It looked extremely ferocious!

It was attacking the other abyssal seeds that entered its territory!

At the bottom of the lava, one could vaguely see a tree with fiery red fruits on it!

The abyssal seeds that rushed in wanted to snatch these fruits!

“There are actually so many abyssal seeds that want to snatch the fruits inside. It seems that the fruits of the trees below are more attractive to the abyssal seeds than the dragon’s blood!”

Wang Xian mumbled!

There were creatures in the abyss, so naturally, there were treasures born. Since this huge mountain was able to attract so many abyssal seeds, the treasures inside must be very precious!

“Aren’t there any level eight immortal King Abyss seeds here?”

Wang Xian looked at the location below and muttered!

Based on his speculation, there should be even more powerful abyss seeds here!

“Wait here!”

Wang Xian muttered and continued to wait around!

The battle below was very intense. One by one, the abyss seeds were killed and devoured. Among them, a few level seven immortal King Abyss seeds were trying to break out of the encirclement deep into the lava!

The entire magma was extremely chaotic!

“Roar Roar Roar Roar!”

At this moment, Wang Xian heard another roar from above!

Three to four level 7 immortal king abyssal seeds appeared with a few thousand underlings and dove down directly!

Wang Xian was slightly shocked and immediately hid back in the cave!

“Boom Boom Boom!”

Four level 7 immortal King abyssal seeds appeared once again and charged into the magma, causing the battle to become even more intense!

“I wonder if there are any level eight abyss seeds in there. If there aren’t, I can definitely enter and fight!”

Wang Xian showed a hesitant look as he looked down!

Wang Xian and the rest had ten level seven immortal king combat strength members. Speaking of which, the ten of them could fight against a level eight immortal king together!

There were many level seven abyss seeds below Wang Xian!

“There’s no point in going into the Tiger’s den. At worst, I can just run away!”

Wang Xian made a decision in his heart!

F * ck!

Their strength was no longer weak. If three or four level seven immortal king level abyssal seeds dared to charge in, why wouldn’t he dare to!

“Get Ready. Let’s go and take a look too!”

“The level five and level six members will follow. The weaker ones will wait behind!”

Wang Xian immediately gave the order!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

All the members of the Dragon Palace nodded their heads!

“There’s no need to hide it. We Can’t hide it either!”

He moved his body and flew down directly!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

At the same time, he let out a dragon roar and his entire body immediately transformed into a divine dragon!

The 20,000-meter divine dragon body was revealed. Wang Xian wagged his tail and shrunk his body slightly to about 1,000 meters!

Behind him, Ao Qitian and the rest transformed into their battle forms and followed closely behind Wang Xian!

“Let’s go take a look at those fruits first. If there are any abyssal seeds obstructing us, kill them immediately!”

Wang Xian transmitted his voice to them!

“Peng!”

After entering the lava, Wang Xian flew straight towards the trees in the lava below!

This was a gigantic tree that was tens of millions of meters tall in the lava. The fiery-red fruits on top of it supported a space that looked extremely resplendent!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

When they had just charged in, four to five dark red abyssal seeds flew over from the bottom of the lava!

Each of them had the combat strength of an immortal king level seven!

Behind them, there were a few thousand immortal king level seven and below!

“This abyssal seed is so strong. There are already ten of them who have resisted the other abyssal seeds. Now, four to five of them have flown out from the bottom. This abyssal species is not simple!”

...

Wang Xian’s eyes were sparkling!

“Kill them, at the fastest speed possible!”

Wang Xian let out a low growl and used his dragon claws to meet the abyssal seeds that were flying towards him from below!

“Roar!”

The few abyssal seeds had an extremely violent expression on their faces. They spat out a flame law from their mouths and swept it towards Wang Xian and the rest!

“Kill one of them first!”

Wang Xian also opened his dragon mouth and spat out the flame law!

Boom

A violent collision sound was heard. With the buffer of the surrounding lava, their attack power could only affect an area of 100 kilometers!

Behind them, Ao Qitian and the rest immediately released an area-of-effect attack and covered the few abyssal seeds!

Puff! Puff

...

Ao Yao and the rest hid in the lava. With a strange movement, they instantly killed a level seven abyssal seed and kept its corpse!

“Alright!”

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Just as the level seven abyssal seed was killed, a violent roar came from below!

Wang Xian’s pupils constricted slightly. Around him, the abyssal seeds that wanted to enter also trembled and looked inside!

“An abyssal seed with a combat strength of level eight!”

Wang Xian looked down and felt a chill in his heart! Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The abyssal seeds that rushed in from the surroundings let out an unwilling roar. They turned around and fled outside!

“Forget it, I’m no match for them!”

Wang Xian looked over and shook his head slightly. One level eight godly king abyssal seed and more than ten level seven abyssal seeds were no match for them!

He also moved his body and immediately fled into the sky!

“Roar!”

The level eight abyssal seed below stared at Wang Xian and the rest with its blood-red eyes. When it saw them escaping, it let out an angry roar. However, it did not chase after them!

“Huh? It didn’t chase after US and didn’t come out of the lava?”

Wang Xian looked over and raised his dragon eyes slightly. He glanced down and immediately shifted his gaze to the abyssal seeds that were flying towards the sky!

There were about ten of them and they were divided into three races. Each of them flew towards the entrance of the cave vigilantly!

“Attack! Attack Them!”

When Wang Xian saw this scene, his eyes were filled with joy. Although he was not a match for the abyssal species below, the abyssal species dragon palaces above him could totally destroy them!

He locked his gaze on the abyssal species that had four immortal godly monarchs and charged straight at them!

Ao Qitian and the rest immediately followed behind!

“Roar!”

When the group of Abyss races saw Wang Xian and the rest charging at them, they revealed an extremely furious expression. In this narrow space within the huge mountain, it was not easy for them to escape. They charged straight at them in anger!

“You’re courting death!”

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a cold expression. He waved his dragon claws and met the Abyss races one by one!

The four abyssal seeds wanted to challenge Wang Xian and the rest, but in less than two minutes, they were all killed!

His gaze swept to the top of the giant peak, and his eyes were sparkling!

“Let’s go. Since the abyssal seeds can’t come out from the bottom, we can totally clear out the other abyssal races here!”
