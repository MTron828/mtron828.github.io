3443 3442 killing water mage cave master

A figure, a snow-white figure, was attacking the thousands of disciples of the ancestral dragon lineage.

His entire body was covered by water currents. As he ran, he looked like a pool of special water.

His body was incorporeal and looked extremely strange.

This was a special creature.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly. His eyes were sparkling.

There were actually experts who wanted to attack the ancestral dragon lineage.

It seemed that they had come prepared this time.

If Wang Xian didn’t guess, this figure was called cave master water mage.

Azure Dragon Moon had warned him before that among the twelve cave masters, he should not challenge Cave Master Tianheng or Cave Master Ice Emperor. The last one was cave master water mage.

To be able to make Azure Dragon Moon say such words, it was also a recognition of their strength!

“A universe overlord level powerhouse sneaking up on a group of universe knights, isn’t that a little shameless!”

Wang Xian started to move at this moment.

If he didn’t make a move, these thousands of disciples of the ancestral dragon lineage would all die.

“Huh?”

The water flow that was attacking the disciples of the ancestral dragon lineage paused slightly. Looking at Wang Xian who suddenly appeared in front of him, his gaze focused.

“Hehe, you really interfered. A newly advanced powerhouse from the ancestral dragon lineage?”

The cave master of the water mage did not seem to be too surprised by Wang Xian’s attack.

In the battle between Wang Xian and the cave master of the Demoness Cave, all the powerhouses could tell that he was also a powerhouse from the divine dragon lineage.

In addition to that, Wang Xian had entered the cave abode of the Azure Dragon Moon twice. All of these were seen by everyone.

They had already made some guesses and were on guard against Wang Xian!

“I’m not from the ancestral dragon lineage. However, I’m very displeased with the lackeys of the Holy Dragon lineage!”

Wang Xian shook his head slightly and said faintly.

“Hehe, since you’re standing on the ancestral dragon lineage, I don’t care if you’re a disciple of the ancestral dragon lineage or not. You Must Die!”

“Killing you is much more valuable than killing thousands of disciples of the ancestral dragon lineage. I want to exchange your body for treasures. Hualala!”

After he finished speaking, his body moved instantly.

The water current was his body, allowing him to transform at will.

He condensed into the form of a water god Dragon and stretched out his dragon claws to grab at it.

“What? One of the Twelve Cave Masters, the cave master of the water mage, wants to make an enemy out of the ancestral dragon lineage?”

“It’s fortunate that Lord Wang Xian made a move. Otherwise, we would be finished!”

“Damn it, there’s a traitor among us. There are even experts who want to kill us. They must have come prepared!”

At the front of the Azure Dragon Moon Cave abode, the disciples of the ancestral dragon lineage looked at this scene with unsightly expressions.

The attack by the cave master of the water mage just now had made them feel the arrival of death.

It was fortunate that a Lord had appeared out of nowhere!

Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to escape!

“How dare you act so arrogantly with Your Fake Divine Dragon Body!”

Wang Xian stared at the illusion of the water mage and a cold look appeared in his eyes.

Boom

His body shook and the Clouds and mist appeared around him.

“Go to the sky and fight immediately!”

At the surrounding area, the cave masters saw the situation here and their expressions turned ugly. They warned him coldly.

Hualala

Whoosh

Master Shui and Wang Xian didn’t violate the rules here.

They were also afraid of disturbing the terrifying space behemoth.

The Clouds and mist enveloped master shui completely. However, it was as if he didn’t need to use his eyes to see anything as he attacked Wang Xian directly.

“With just you? I’m going to destroy you completely today!”

Master Shui revealed a strong sense of confidence as he roared furiously, “Use your body as a formation, watertight, and seal the Void!”

Clearly, he was very confident in his own strength!

His entire body trembled. Water droplets were connected to the city and spread around.

These water droplets condensed into a formation in the void.

A sealing formation. Under this formation, one could only return to his divine kingdom in an instant after breaking the formation.

“Hehe, very good. I like your confidence!”

Wang Xian smiled. In his body, chains extended crazily to the surroundings, sealing off an area of void as well.

“Thank you for your help, brother Wang Xian. Be careful, brother. This water mage’s attack is very strange.”

At this moment, Green Dragon Moon’s anxious voice came from afar.

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the area. Green Dragon Moon was completely suppressed by the four level one masters of the universe.

However, he was a wood elemental divine dragon. His greatest strength was his recovery ability.

If they wanted to kill the Green Dragon Moon, they would need at least some time.

However, the Green Dragon Moon was already locked onto. Even if he tried to escape, he would still be chased down. From their point of view, the Green Dragon Moon would definitely die.

However, it would take some time.

“Don’t worry.”

Wang Xian smiled faintly. The last time when he killed the cave master of the Demoness Cave, he had only used one-fifth of his strength.

This time, he would not hold back!

The incipient saint wings flapped violently and he disappeared in an instant!

“HMM? What a fast speed. However, everything about you is under my perception!”

The cave master of the water mage cave sensed Wang Xian’s speed and his expression changed slightly.

When Wang Xian appeared at a certain spot, a water bubble appeared in front of him.

It wrapped around him directly.

“Such a quick reaction. He can capture the location where I am flying.”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned, but he didn’t care. He waved his arm and the five elements Millstone attacked the cave master of the water mage.

Boom

The Five Elements Millstone attacked and the five elements began to revolve. The entire five elements millstone was extremely red.

A terrifying flame suddenly exploded.

It was as if the entire sky was covered in flames.

Crack! Crack! Crack

“What!”

The sudden appearance of the Five Elements Millstone and its sudden burst of power caught master shui off guard.

Cracks also appeared on the formation that he had set up to seal the void.

A cold look appeared in Wang Xian’s eyes. As his body flickered, his arm turned into a flaming dragon claw.

Boom

The appearance of the Flames seemed to have caused the cave master to lose his powerful senses.

Wang Xian appeared at the side of the cave master and attacked the body of the water dragon that he had transformed into.

“Ah!”

A miserable scream came from the mouth of the cave master. Lotus petals slowly appeared around him.

Each petal possessed an extremely powerful defense.

“Eh? This is a water lotus. No, it should be him who swallowed the water lotus and comprehended a powerful defensive law.”

Wang Xian’s gaze focused and flickered slightly.

“However, you still have to die!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and four ninth-grade water lotus flowers appeared around him. They were pressing down on him directly.

“What? How is this possible!”

When the cave master saw the four ninth-grade water lotus flowers, he was stunned and filled with disbelief

How could he have four ninth-grade water lotuses? Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

He had stayed in the Eternal Sky River for over a billion years before he obtained a ninth-grade water lotus. After devouring it, he comprehended a powerful defensive law.

There were four of these fellows who had just arrived here not long ago?
