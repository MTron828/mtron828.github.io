“Today, the horned shark mercenary group killed a horned snake in the eastern suburbs swamp. I’m really envious!”

“The mission to kill the horned snake is 1-star gold rank. After the horned shark mercenary group completes a few 1-star gold rank missions, they will be able to advance to 2-star gold rank!”

“Today, the Demon Hunter Academy of Eastern Sea City is recruiting students. I wonder how many people will be able to complete the trial mission!”

“Is there a mercenary group going to Murloc Island for a mission? If there is, we will request for a mercenary group above silver-rank!”

As they walked into the demon hunters mercenary group, lively voices could be heard. Many young, middle-aged, and even old men were sitting at the tables and talking loudly.

Some of them were shirtless and their bodies were covered in scars.

Some of them were drinking and listening quietly.

There were men and women.

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings.

The entire demon hunter mercenary group was huge. Every single one of them was exuding a ferocious aura.

Most of them were above the extraordinaire level.

“No wonder Gu Qingwen and the rest wanted to establish an empire after coming to Earth. They are just small fry on the extraordinaire continent. That’s why they want to live a life like a King!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the place and walked straight to the innermost area.

In the middle of the area, there was a huge screen. The screen was filled with all kinds of missions.

There were missions to hunt demonic beasts! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

There were escorts!

There were missions to search for spiritual herbs!

There were large-scale missions and small-scale missions!

There were all kinds of missions. The level of the missions ranged from bronze level to mythical level.

And among the mythical rank missions, there was actually a mission to obtain the dragon tooth of the dragon race!

Wang Xian took a glance and walked to the service counter.

“I want to establish a mercenary group!”

He said to a woman at the service counter.

“Establishing a mercenary group requires 10,000 low-grade spiritual stones. The initial mercenary group is 1-star bronze rank. If it is established, please pay the spiritual stones!”

The waiter said to Wang Xian without even lifting his head.

“Established!”

Wang Xian nodded and took out 10,000 low-grade spirit stones.

“Please state the name of the mercenary group. We will make a badge for all of you. One low-grade spirit stone for each badge!”

The waiter raised his head and said to him.

“The Dragon King Mercenary Group!”

Wang Xian said directly.

The waiter was stunned for a moment. Then, he sized up Wang Xian and laughed, “The Dragon King mercenary group? Young Man, are you courting death? How dare you call yourself the Dragon King Mercenary Group!”

“Leader, the Dragon Race has a strong reputation in the supernatural continent. Once someone slanders them, the dragon race will kill them immediately when they find out!”

The DRAKONID reminded him hurriedly.

“Is that so?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. He didn’t expect the dragon race to be so domineering.

“PFFT, young man, change your name. This name is not beneficial!”

The waiter at the front desk said with a smile.

“Then let’s call it the Celestial Phoenix Mercenary Group!”

Wang Xian didn’t mind it too much. There was no need to create more trouble over a name.

Moreover, the name of the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group was not bad.

Wang Xian thought about it and smiled.

“How many badges do you want? Also, do you want some other supporting tools? You can take a look!”

The receptionist continued to speak to Wang Xian.

“Take one of the mission stone plates. Give me twenty badges first!”

Wang Xian said directly.

“Alright, wait for a while. The badges will be produced very soon. The mission stone plate costs one million low-grade spiritual stones. You can pay with medium-grade spiritual stones!”

The waiter said to Wang Xian.

“Low-grade spiritual stones!”

Wang Xian paid one million and twenty spiritual stones without hesitation.

The mission stone tablet was equivalent to the mission screen in the demon hunters mercenary group. One could view it through the stone tablet.

This item was similar to a computer, but it was achieved through a formation.

In the current transcendence continent, there were no legendary-level mercenary groups.

There were only three legendary-level mercenary groups.

“Ding, the system has issued a mission to unify the sea of the transcendence continent. The reward is: Jade Dragon Seed, heavenly tree!”

“Ding, the system has issued a mission. The path of the strong has been opened. As a divine dragon, the dragon can amaze the world. The path of the mercenary group can be upgraded to a silver mercenary group. One can obtain a random extraordinary item from the Dragon Palace’s Treasure!”

At this moment, the system’s voice suddenly rang out, causing Wang Xian to be slightly stunned.

Following that, a smile appeared on his face.

“I just saw the instructor of the Demon Hunters Academy entering our Holy Sea Town!”

“The selection of the Demon Hunter College is about to begin. I wonder which lucky one will be able to enter the Demon Hunter College!”

“I’m going to participate in it tomorrow as well. If I enter the Demon Hunter College, I’ll be able to gain a lot of resources and connections. I might even be able to join some gold mercenary groups!”

“Sigh, I don’t want to anymore. I took the assessment once when I was thirty years old. It was too difficult!”

At this moment, the entire hall suddenly became lively. Most of the people were talking about the demon Hunter College.

“Demon Hunter College!”

Wang Xian mumbled as he recalled the things about the demon Hunter College in his mind.

The Demon Hunter College existed in every dynasty and empire. Its main purpose was to nurture a mercenary group.

As there were too many demons and monsters in this world, it required too many strong people to eradicate them and solve some hidden dangers. Therefore, a mercenary group was very important in the entire transcendence continent.

By entering the Demon Hunter Academy, one could learn more martial techniques, obtain more information, and cultivate the elites of the mercenary groups.

Those who could graduate from the Demon Hunter Academy were all experienced experts.

Similarly, it was very difficult to enter the demon Hunter Academy. One could not be more than forty years old, and they had to complete the assessment mission.

The Demon Hunter Academy was free, and it mainly focused on actual combat. As long as one completed a certain mission, they could smoothly graduate.

For everyone who wanted to become strong, the Demon Hunter College was the most ideal place.

Of course, it was not that easy to enter the demon Hunter College. There were more than a dozen towns under Donghai City, and each town had a few million people. In addition to the people in Donghai City.

Every year, there were more than a few hundred thousand people who wanted to join the Demon Hunter College!

“Leader, it would be best if we could join the Demon Hunter College. Joining it would bring great benefits to our mercenary group!”

Gu Qingwen and the rest looked at Wang Xian with burning eyes as they spoke.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. The purpose of the Demon Hunters Academy was to nurture powerful mercenaries. The restrictions were very low as long as they completed a fixed mission every semester.

In the Demon Hunters Academy, one could obtain some information and resources that the outside world could not.

“Your badges have been made. If you want to make a mercenary group uniform, you can go to the side to make a custom one. Also, after the mercenary group’s level has increased, you can change your badges for free!”

Soon, the waiter shouted at them and handed them a badge with a bronze sword and a shield crossed together.

Below, there were five Big Words: Immortal Phoenix mercenary group.

The badge could be directly put on the clothes to symbolize identity.
