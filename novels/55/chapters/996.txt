Chapter 997: 0998, you have offended too many people

Translator: 5496903

“Demon Hunter Villa!”

Wang Xian stood in front of a luxurious door. He looked at the plaque in front of him and walked straight in.

“Private gathering. Please Show Me Your Invitation Card!”

When he reached the door, a young man stretched out his hand and said to him.

Wang Xian handed the invitation card over casually. With the young man’s nod, he walked in.

There was only one path in the surroundings, so he wasn’t afraid of taking the wrong path.

The entire villa was planted with spiritual herbs of the first level of transcendence. Taking a breath would make one feel refreshed.

The surrounding environment was very beautiful.

Rockery and ponds were not inferior to those big villas and manors on Earth.

It was even more magical.

“The gathering of the Demon Hunters Academy Is Here!”

Passing through a small path, a service staff member spoke to him at the intersection.

Wang Xian walked for dozens of meters and saw a field.

The field was open-air and there were some tables and chairs placed on it. At this moment, there were already many people there.

At least a hundred young men and women were sitting inside. A group of people were drinking and discussing something.

Wang Xian walked straight over and took a glance. He didn’t see anyone from the amethyst mercenary group.

He found a random seat and took a sip of the wine on the table.

Some of the students didn’t recognize Wang Xian when they saw him entering.

Wang Xian had only stayed in the academy for less than two days. There weren’t many students who had seen him.

“I heard that the Yun family went to the young master’s mercenary group again yesterday. Did they receive any news?”

“There is still no news from the twenty people in the young master’s mercenary group. It seems like they are doomed!”

“The young master’s mercenary group suffered a great loss in this matter. Not only did they not kill Wang Xian, but they even lost their lives on the Thunder Island!”

“I think that after such a thing happened, that kid named Wang Xian will die even more. The young master’s mercenary group will not let him off. Even the Yun family will kill him to vent their anger!”

Just as Wang Xian was sitting there and waiting, a group of more than ten people walked over to him. They were chatting in low voices.

“This student, do you have anyone here?”

A young man took a look at Wang Xian and asked him.

“No one!”

Wang Xian shook his head and sipped the wine in his cup.

The good wine from the supernatural continent was slightly better. It could be 50 to 60 years old, or even a few hundred years old.

The taste was completely incomparable to those on Earth.

“Dear student, which mercenary group are you from? You look a little unfamiliar?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

After a dozen of them sat down, a young man looked at Wang Xian and asked with a smile.

“The Immortal Phoenix Mercenary Group!”

Wang Xian replied with a smile.

“The Immortal Phoenix mercenary group? Why haven’t I heard of it before?”

A hint of doubt appeared in the young man’s eyes.

“Someone sent an invitation!”

Wang Xian said faintly.

“Oh!”

The young man nodded and raised his head slightly. He smiled and said, “We are from the tornado mercenary group!”

Wang Xian nodded.

When the young man saw that Wang Xian didn’t have the envious look that he had imagined, he turned his head away unhappily and ignored him.

“Are the little guys from our tornado mercenary group here yet?”

“Yes, they are here. Those little guys are ecstatic when they heard that they could come to this gathering. I think they will be here soon!”

“Yeah, we should recruit one or two good seedlings this time and nurture them well!”

The people from the tornado mercenary group were chatting beside them.

“Leader, deputy leader, seniors!”

In less than five minutes, three to four figures walked over.

They had excited expressions on their faces as they walked over with a smile.

“Take a seat!”

A young man nodded at them and pointed to a few seats beside them.

“Yes, leader!”

The four young men responded immediately and walked towards the seats beside Wang Xian.

However, when one of the young men pulled a chair and was about to sit down, he was stunned when he saw Wang Xian.

“You... Why are you here?”

Duan Qingwen widened his eyes and whispered with an embarrassed expression.

Now that he was facing Wang Xian, he didn’t dare to speak loudly, let alone mock him.

“Huh?”

“It’s him!”

When the other young men heard Duan Qingwen’s voice, they were stunned when they turned around.

“Oh? What’s wrong? Do you guys know each other?”

The young man who spoke to Wang Xian earlier asked curiously.

“Senior, he is Wang Xian from our Class!”

Duan Qingwen said with an unpleasant expression.

When he finished his sentence, the surroundings instantly turned silent.

Everyone looked at Wang Xian in unison. Their expressions changed slightly.

“Wang Xian, the freshman Wang Xian?”

The young man who was sitting in the middle immediately stood up and asked in a deep voice.

“Yes, leader, that’s the one!”

Duan Qingwen nodded in slight astonishment.

“How did you get in here?”

The leader of the tornado mercenary group kept changing his expression as he stared at Wang Xian with a dark expression.

Wang Xian, the new Wang Xian!

How did this fellow get here?

He even dared to invite him over?

This fellow not only offended the amethyst mercenary group, but also the young master mercenary group.

Now, Yun Hanhai and the others had disappeared because of this guy. He was someone that the young master’s mercenary group wanted to destroy.

Who would dare to invite him over?

No one would dare. No one in the demon Hunters Academy would dare.

But now, this guy was sitting with them. If the others didn’t know, they would think that it was their tornado mercenary group who had brought him over!

If this was seen by the young master’s mercenary group, the tornado mercenary group wouldn’t be able to explain it clearly.

“Of course, he walked in.”

Wang Xian saw the young man staring at him. He frowned and said faintly.

“Walked in? I Don’t care how you came in. Stay away from us!”

The leader of the tornado mercenary group stared at him with a dark expression.

“Huh?”

Duan Qingwen was slightly stunned when he saw the captain’s reaction. Then, a gloating expression appeared in his eyes.

“You want me to stay away from you guys? If I remember correctly, I was the one who came first!”

Wang Xian stared at the young man and said expressionlessly.

“If I want you to leave, then leave immediately. Why? Do you want us to ask you to leave?”

The young man standing next to the captain of the tornado mercenary group also realized the problem. He stared at Wang Xian and said with a frosty expression.

“Wang Xian, I think you should stay away from us. How dare a person like you come here? You are really courting death!”

Duan Qingwen also spoke up.

Now that he had joined the tornado mercenary group and the captain had already asked Wang Xian to leave, he wanted to add insult to injury.

If he could leave a good impression on the captain and the rest, why would he be afraid of Wang Xian?

At the thought of this, he looked down from above. His eyes were filled with mockery.

“Hehe, I’d like to see how you guys are going to ask me to leave.”

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a cold expression. He stared at them and sat there motionlessly.

“Bang!”

“I think you really don’t want to take the easy way out. Kid, you’ve offended too many people. Get Out of our place!”
