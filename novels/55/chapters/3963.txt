Translator: 549690339

Just as Wang Xian and the rest came out from the Holy Moon, there were dozens of powerhouses at the entrance to welcome them.

One by one, the Masters of the universe bowed to Dragon Roar.

Among these powerhouses, the strongest one was at level four of the Masters of the universe!

It was obvious that Dragon Roar Yin’s status in the dragon roar forbidden ground was very high!

“HMM, let’s return to the Dragon Roar Forbidden Ground First! ”

Long yinyin faced the powerhouses in the forbidden ground and nodded her head indifferently. She was filled with the temperament of a saintess.

Cold, proud, and extraordinary!

“It’s the Saintess! ”

The powerhouses in the dragon roar forbidden ground nodded their heads and immediately flew to the side with them. “Sister, sister, wait for me, wait for me! ”

At this moment, a voice came from behind.

Wang Xian looked over and saw a young man who looked slightly similar to long yinyin flying over quickly.

This was not the first time Wang Xian had seen him.

When he was on the seventh level, Wang Xian had already seen long Yinyin’s younger brother.

As for what his name was, he didn’t know!

“Hehehe, sister, wait for me. Let’s go back together! ”

The young man flew over with a cheeky smile on his face. He looked at Wang Xian who was beside him and his eyes sparkled. “Brother Wang Xian, right? Hello, Hello. You’re very good. I really admire you! ”

“He’s my younger brother. His name is long yinhao. He’s very mischievous.”

Long yinyin introduced him to Wang Xian.

“Yes, Hello!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“Let’s go. Let’s Make a trip back home first! ”

As Long Yin Yin spoke, the experts around them brought them away quickly!

They flew to a temporary base in the dragon’s Roar Forbidden Land. There was a teleportation formation here!

Through the teleportation formation, they went through five interchanges before arriving at the lair of the Dragon’s roar forbidden land.

“Eh? The Dragon’s Roar Forbidden Land is on an island?”

When Wang Xian noticed his surroundings, he realized that he had arrived at an island.

The surrounding area was filled with the ocean!

They were currently on an island.

And in front of this pirate, there was a strange island.

In that island, there was an incomparably huge mountain peak.

The mountain peak pierced through the clouds and reached an extremely terrifying height.

Furthermore, there was an incomparably huge waterfall that flowed down from it.

It was an extremely spectacular spectacle!

The waterfall fell from the sky and gave off an incomparably loud roar.

However, this roar was completely different from the dragon’s roar.

As for whether there were dragons in the sword and magic universe, Wang Xian learned from the information he obtained that there were none.

“That’s right. Brother Wang Xian, don ‘t you know that our dragon roar forbidden ground is in the Sky Sea? That is the sky peak of our dragon roar forbidden ground. Isn’t it very spectacular? We will live and cultivate there. ”

Long Yinhao said to Wang Xian.

“Let’s fly over! ”

Long yinyin said to Wang Xian and gestured to the surrounding elders.

The elders nodded and did not follow him.

Long Yin Yin brought Wang Xian towards the sky peak of the Dragon Roar Forbidden Ground.

The Sky Peak of the dragon roar forbidden ground was indeed spectacular.

Compared to the Dragon Roar Forbidden Ground, Ming Yi Sacred Academy was like a weak ant.

In this universe, the difference between the sacred grounds was huge!

Wang Xian flew to the front of the sky peak and immediately sensed a majestic water energy.

At the same time, he sensed that he had entered a special space.

“The defense around the sky peak is pretty good! ”

Wang Xian sensed his surroundings and thought to himself.

This defense could at least fend off existences at the ninth level of the universe dominator.

“Come here. The Sky Peak is very tall and huge. Let’s go to the top! ”

Long Yin continued to speak to Wang Xian as they flew towards the top of the sky peak.

The sky peak was indeed very high. After a few minutes, they finally arrived at the top.

“Yinyin, Yinhao.”

A few hundred kilometers below the top of the sky peak.

When they flew over, a voice was heard!

Wang Xian looked over and saw five to six elders and more than ten middle-aged men standing at the edge of the Sky Peak!

Their gazes landed on Wang Xian.

Wang Xian could sense streams of energy sensing him. However, these energies didn’t have any malicious intent!

“Grandpa, elders, deacons, Dad, Mom! ”

Long Yin and long Yin Hao shouted immediately.

“Hehe, good, good. Not bad. This is young master Wang Xian!”

The old man in the middle of the group smiled and nodded at the two of them.

Then, his gaze landed on Wang Xian. “Thank you, young master Wang Xian. You saved my granddaughter’s life twice. We at the Dragon Roar forbidden ground are eternally grateful! ”

Senior, it was nothing! ”

Wang Xian cupped his hands politely.

With his current body’s strength, there was no problem for him to address him as senior.

Furthermore, Long Yinyin’s grandfather was definitely much older than Wang Xian.

He was someone who had lived for at least ten billion years!

“Hehe, it’s not a small matter to be indebted to you for saving my life. Furthermore, little brother, you are able to suppress the rest of the holy sons and saintesses. You have unlimited potential. Come, come, come, come in and sit!

Long Yinyin’s grandfather smiled and gestured with his hand!

Wang Xian nodded and flew inside. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The location inside was not a luxurious palace. Instead, it was a cave surrounded by plants. Water flowed through the cave and it was exceptionally beautiful!

“Wang Xian, my grandfather is in the center. These two are my parents. The rest are my second and third grandpas. They are also the elders and deacons of the Dragon Roar Forbidden Ground. ”

Long yinyin came to Wang Xian’s side and introduced him in a low voice.

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“Hehe, come and sit. Little Brother, you are called Wang Xian, right? I shall call you Xiao Xian. You have outstanding talent. If our dragon roar forbidden land can have such a spoiled child joining us, it will be our luck. ”

When they came inside, everyone sat down.

Long Yinyin’s grandfather said to Wang Xian with a smile on his face.

“I heard that you like some special treasures. They are all in Here! ”

As he spoke, he threw an interspatial ring to Wang Xian.

“Thank you, Elder. ”

Wang Xian took it and called him elder as well!

“Haha, we will be on the same side in the future. Yinyin has also mentioned your condition. Our Dragon Roar forbidden land will naturally agree to it. Of course, we are the ones who have the upper hand since you were able to join our dragon roar forbidden land this time.”

Grandpa Dragon Roar Yin laughed and said!

“Joining the Dragon Roar Forbidden Land will also bring me a lot of benefits in my cultivation. ”

Wang Xian replied politely and sensed his interspatial ring. He realized that there were not only three treasures inside.

Instead, the five items mentioned by Dragon Roar Yin were all inside. Especially the universe breath soil that he paid the most attention to. There were indeed many of them.

The energy of the breathing soil also made him a little excited.

This breathing soil contained a large amount of sword and the aura of the magical universe.

Perhaps the living beings in this universe could not sense it, but Wang Xian could.

It should not be a problem for the disciples and experts of the Dragon Palace to use it to resist the repulsion of this universe!
