Chapter 1312: Danger lurked everywhere in 1313

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

“Three spirits battle armor!”

Wang Xian moved his body after the sudden attack. His body was instantly covered with a layer of powerful defense.

The attack landed on his body but was easily blocked by the three spirits battle armor.

Wang Xian looked at the two middle-aged men in front of him with a cold gaze.

“Nameless Sword Demon?”

The few of them looked at Wang Xian with a hint of surprise in their eyes. “Get out of here. Otherwise, don’t blame us for being rude!”

“Isn’t it a little inappropriate for you to attack us directly like this?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. There was a hint of coldness in his eyes.

“Keke, Kid, don’t you know that in the main hall, don’t barge into every place with abundant spiritual energy? Be careful, you won’t be able to get out once you enter!”

A middle-aged man revealed a smile as he stared at Wang Xian with his sinister eyes.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows as he swept his gaze across the three of them. He snorted softly before turning around and leaving.

“Should we make a move?”

“Forget it. This nameless sword demon’s strength is extremely terrifying when he is at the second level of the Seethrough realm. The pet beside him is not simple either!”

“After receiving the spiritual energy from the Heaven’s Pride Bridge, his strength is much stronger than before. Don’t take any risks!”

The three of them looked at Wang Xian’s figure as their eyes sparkled as they watched him leave.

“This place can only be said to be the periphery of the main hall. Yet, there are so many strong people here. Furthermore, they attacked without saying a word. How Cruel!”

Wang Xian left the place where he was earlier and scanned his surroundings.

In some of the intact houses, the spiritual energy contained in them was obviously much denser than in the surroundings.

It was even several times denser than the surrounding area.

Clearly, there was a formation in there.

These houses and buildings used to be the place where the experts of the blood stream sect lived and cultivated.

Now, some of the experts were occupying this place to cultivate. If they were to barge in recklessly, it was very likely that they would be attacked by their opponents.

“I should go straight to the place where the demon soul is!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. He did not enter the surrounding buildings. Instead, he shuttled through the main hall and walked towards the interior.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Walking in the main hall, Wang Xian could hear the roars of ferocious beasts coming from not far away.

The closer he got to the center, the louder the roars of ferocious beasts became.

“This should be the spiritual herb garden of the ancient blood stream sect. It’s a pity that all of them have been destroyed by ferocious beasts!”

Wang Xian looked at a territory that was 1,000 meters long and 7,000 to 8,000 meters wide in front of him. He moved his body and continued flying forward.

“The main hall of the Blood Stream sect!”

He carefully arrived at the central area. Wang Xian looked at the 2,000-meter-tall main hall of the blood stream sect.

It covered an area of about five kilometers. The entire building looked extremely majestic.

Even the Dragon Palace could not compare to it.

The entire main hall contained a terrifying energy. It had been standing there for at least 4,000 to 5,000 years.

Half of the main hall was on land and the other half was on the ocean.

It was not easy to build the same building as dozens of cities.

The main hall had a total of twenty-one floors. The former leader of the Blood Stream sect was on the top floor, overlooking the entire flowing sea area.

The two vice leaders were on the nineteenth and twentieth floors.

The first floor of the eighteen floors below was the parliament area, while the other seventeen floors were the land of the seventeen elders.

Currently, many places in the main hall were occupied by ferocious beasts. There were also many buildings around the main hall.

Every building was a paradise for the insightful emptiness realm experts.

“King, we need to pass through the first floor and reach the demonic beast area on the opposite side!”

The Demon Soul looked at the main hall in front and said to Wang Xian.

“Okay, let’s Go!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and walked towards the entrance of the first level of the main hall.

“Eh?”

Suddenly, Wang Xian, who was traveling, raised his eyebrows. His eyes flashed with a cold expression.

“Two are at the second level of the void interpretation stage, three are at the first level of the void interpretation stage, and there’s also a formation!”

He thought to himself. He did not stop at all.

“Kill!”

The moment Wang Xian got close to him, numerous attacks were launched at him.

This time, it was a blatant act of killing and robbing.

“Kill!”

When Wang Xian saw his opponent’s outburst, he didn’t hesitate at all. His body shook and a powerful aura was emitted. He used all his strength and attacked straight ahead.

“Roar! How Dare You Ambush Us? Die!”

The Demon Soul roared and his body immediately turned into about seven to eight meters. His huge body pounced straight ahead.

Boom

“It’s the nameless sword demon. Don’t be afraid. Activate the trapping formation!”

A calm voice came from the side. When they saw Wang Xian react, they didn’t panic at all.

With a shake of his arm, the formation compass was activated.

The green trapping formation covered Wang Xian directly.

“A third-level void interpretation formation?”

Wang Xian looked at the trapping formation with a smile in his eyes. Without any hesitation, he charged towards the three of them.

“Go to hell!”

When the three of them saw that the formation was activated, they raised their weapons and knives and slashed towards Wang Xian and the demon soul.

“You want to Ambush Me? You Don’t know what’s good for you!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and a stream of golden energy was released to block the two of them who were attacking him.

“Golden fire cleansing!”

His body shook and he easily passed through the trapping formation. His supernatural ability, golden fire cleansing, was used to attack the front.

“What?”

When the three people who were lying in ambush saw Wang Xian charging out of the trap formation, they were stunned.

When the expert at the first level of the Seethrough realm saw the divine ability that was attacking him, he was shocked.

“Dharma Idol: Ancient Mountain Guardian!”

He quickly shouted in fear. An ancient mountain immediately enveloped him.

Boom! Boom! Boom

However, at the moment when the ancient mountain was protecting him, the attack that was washed away by the Golden Flames had already landed on his body.

The powerful supernatural ability and the crushing power.

It caused the ancient mountain to collapse rapidly.

“No... Save Me!”

The first level of the Seethrough realm expert was filled with horror as he shouted in horror.

“Gold crack void!”

“Star Explosion!”

However, Wang Xian did not give the other two any chance. The powerful attack directly attacked the other two.

“Oh no, he can actually pass through the trapping formation!”

The other two experts at the second level of the Seethrough realm had a drastic change in expression. They quickly resisted.

“Ah!”

However, when they were resisting Wang Xian’s defense, the other one at the first level of the Seethrough realm was killed on the spot.

“Gilt Gold Sword Pursuit!”

“Fire penetrates gold!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Fire Territory!”

Following that, Wang Xian did not stop for even a second. He combined his supernatural power and three attributes to attack the other two.

Each attack was able to kill a terrifying attack of a second-level insightful void martial artist without stopping for even a second.

This caused the other two second-level insightful void martial artists to be overwhelmed with horror. Their eyes were filled with horror.

Was this nameless sword demon so terrifying?

“Dharma Idol, freeze thousands of miles!”

“Dharma Idol, heaven-turning water!”

The two of them gritted their teeth. Their bodies trembled in fear.

Wang Xian’s attack was too terrifying. The first attack could kill a second-level insightful void martial artist. There was no room for them to engage in a battle!
