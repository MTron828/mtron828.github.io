“Break the array, break the array!”

“Quick, quick, all warriors break the array, we must break the array.”

A terrifying voice resounded from the leader and the elders.

From the battle till now, even if the dragon palace had displayed their strength, with the ability to fight and suppress the world margin sect.

Even if over 10,000 undying godly monarchs were suddenly assassinated, they didn’t panic too much.

However, when this strange space appeared and they couldn’t sense their god country, everyone was completely panicking.

Even the two forefathers of the world margin sect were terrified.

If they couldn’t break this array, then the tens of millions of people of the world margin sect would all die here.

The entire world margin sect was about to be destroyed.

“Don’t linger in battle, break the formation with all your strength.”

A World Margin sect patriarch roared and hurriedly flew to the side, wanting to escape the bramble monster’s attack and attack the surrounding formation.

“Break the formation!”

The World Margin Sect Master also roared and controlled the world margin ruler to attack the black hole spatial disturbance formation.

However, every attack of the horizon ruler was blocked by the thorny monster.

“What’s going on? Why did such a strange thing suddenly appear? The entire battlefield has been covered!”

“What is this? An Array? It actually covered the entire battlefield. Does the Dragon Palace have a secret weapon?”

“This time, the horizon sect has kicked an iron plate. I didn’t expect the Dragon Palace to be so powerful!”

When the black hole spatial disturbance formation appeared, all the surrounding forces watching the battle were slightly shocked.

The two patriarchs of Jiuxiao looked at each other and stared at the formation that had suddenly appeared below them with a solemn expression.

Against the Dragon Palace, if it was their Jiuxiao this time around, they would also be in a miserable state.

“Kill!”

At this moment, in the black hole spatial disturbance, Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with coldness. With a move, he flew out from the command post and charged into the battlefield.

His arm turned into a dragon claw and charged towards the experts of the world margin sect.

Against a force that was chasing after Qing Yue and Lingxiu, Wang Xian of the world margin sect would definitely be destroyed.

Anyone who dared to hurt them would have to pay a price that was billions of times higher.

“Ah!”

Wang Xian’s attack instantly killed over a hundred immortal king level experts.

In the surroundings, the level 9 immortal king level experts of the world margin sect were being held back. There was no way for them to save them.

“Patriarch, Patriarch, save us. We are not the Dragon King’s match.”

Some of the experts cried out in fear when they saw how easily Wang Xian killed over a hundred immortal King realm experts.

“Damn it, Dragon King, Stop!”

The eyes of the world margin patriarch were bloodshot as he roared.

However, his roar was just a useless roar.

“Buzz Buzz Buzz.”

“Not good. Be careful of your surroundings. That Strange Creature has assassinated you again.”

At this moment, a series of shocked and angry voices rang out, causing the entire battlefield to be in complete chaos.

The appearance of the black hole and the lack of high-end combat strength caused all the experts and disciples of the world margin sect to completely lose order.

“Ah, no. Patriarch, save me!”

Suddenly, an incomparably miserable voice rang out.

Hearing this voice, everyone from the world margin sect was shocked.

“Elder Duanmu.”

Some of the Warriors looked over, their pupils dilated, their faces filled with shock. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

On the battlefield, behind one elder, two black and white silhouettes appeared.

Right now, other than Ao Yao, there was another member with undying level 9 strength.

With the two of them working together, one of the elders could not dodge at all.

“What!”

The two elders looked over, their expressions extremely ugly.

Their hearts pounded violently.

Another elder had died, this was the seventh elder to die at the hands of the Dragon Palace.

If this continued, all of them would die.

“Do whatever it takes to break the array.”

One of the World End Patriarchs roared crazily.

“Sacrifice! Sacrifice!”

...

At this moment, the other patriarch suddenly stared at the World End Ruler and roared at Sect Master World End.

“Sacrifice!”

Sect Master World End and the two elders trembled when they heard this. However, their eyes swept across the battlefield. They gritted their teeth and roared in a low voice.

“Buzz Buzz Buzz!”

In the next moment, the three of them squatted on the horizon ruler and placed their hands on it.

“Ah! Ah! Ah!”

Three roars filled with pain and madness rang out, as waves of fresh blood surged into the horizon ruler.

“Bang Bang Bang!”

At the side, the thorns of the thorny monster landed heavily on the horizon ruler.

“Buzz!”

However, at this moment, the entire horizon ruler emitted a terrifying green light.

...

In the center of the horizon ruler, a blood-red symbol slowly appeared.

“Attack!”

After the symbol completely appeared, sect master horizon let out a wild roar. The power of the laws on the entire horizon ruler surged, and with an unstoppable momentum, it charged forward.

“Bang Bang Bang!”

The thorns that blocked it were directly cut off, and the horizon ruler directly rushed to the front of the black hole disturbance array.

“Oh?”

On the command platform, the sky array frowned slightly when it saw this scene.

“Boom!”

The next moment, the sound of collision rang out. The entire black hole void disturbing array trembled and quickly collapsed.

“All Disciples, run!”

Seeing that the array was broken, the World Horizon sect master immediately roared crazily.

“Run!”

All the experts and disciples saw that the array was broken. Without the slightest hesitation, they directly fled into their own divine kingdom.

They didn’t want to stay here any longer.

The terrifying life-reaping arrows made them terrified assassins.

Every second, hundreds of thousands of disciples and experts died. They were truly afraid.

“Give up on the horizon ruler and run.”

When the two horizon patriarchs saw the situation around them, their hearts bled as they roared in the direction of the horizon ruler.

In the next moment, their figures disappeared.

“Weng Weng Weng!”

Tens of millions of people fled in fear. However, in the process of fleeing, millions of people were still left behind.

“This... this...”

Everyone who was watching the battle was stunned.

The formation suddenly broke and everyone saw the world end ruler rush out. On the world end ruler, three skinny experts were kneeling on it in a miserable manner.

Soon, some people recognized that they were the sect master and elders of the Horizon sect.

Then, tens of millions of people fled back to their own divine kingdom.

This scene was quite shocking and tragic.

“Cough Cough!”

“Dragon King, in the future, we, the horizon sect, will fight to the death with you. In the future, we will fight to the death with Your Dragon Palace for tens of millions of years!”

On the world’s end ruler, an incomparably cold and venomous voice came out from the mouth of the world’s end sect master.

His body trembled as he looked at Wang Xian behind him.

This time, the power of the world’s end ruler erupted during the sacrifice, causing his foundation to be damaged and his strength to regress. He would never be able to return to his peak for the rest of his life.

He would never forget this enmity, the enmity of this disciple who was killed by an expert. He would never be willing to take revenge!

“Buzz!”

His voice fell, the figure also slowly disappeared.
