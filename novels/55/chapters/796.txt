Translator: 549690339

In the Xia City, over 30 people were killing the disciples of the Saint Medicine Saint Medicine Immortal sect.

This action caused all the ordinary people in the Xia city to be dumbstruck.

The Xia city could be considered to be within the Yao Ding region. In the Xia City, who would dare to offend the disciples of the two immortal sects?

Even the second generation of the richest people in the Xia city were like grandsons in front of the disciples of the immortal sects.

However, today, the two disciples of the immortal sects who were showing off and showing off in Xia City were killed one by one by people who were hovering in the air.

At this moment, it caused a huge sensation in the entire city!

However, what was even more shocking was the martial artists of the pugilistic world.

In the morning, the Holy Doctor, Holy Medicine, and Immortal sect directly destroyed the forging workshop of the Dragon Gate. In the afternoon, the experts of the Dragon Gate directly flew to the gate of the two immortal sects and killed a group of people. They even made a move to kill the disciples of the two immortal sects in Xia City.

An eye for an eye, an eye for a tooth. Revenge doesn’t last overnight.

It was said that the disciples of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect were directly killed by more than a thousand people, which made everyone extremely shocked.

“The Dragon Gate sent out a total of about 60 infant realm experts. After being killed by 18 infant realm experts, they were actually able to send out more than 60 people. It’s really terrifying!”

“This should be the full strength of the Dragon Gate. It seems that the Battle of the three immortal gates has completely started!”

“All the experts of the Dragon Gate have come out. I wonder how the two immortal sects will deal with them. The Dragon Gate has no territory and no ordinary disciples!”

On the Jianghu website, all the disciples of the immortal sects read the messages and sighed.

The Revenge of the Dragon Gate also made all the immortal gods of the immortal sects feel fear in their hearts. There were more than 60 infant realm experts, and most of the immortal sects didn’t have so many experts.

“Haha, So What If It’s the Dragon Gate? They only dared to sneak attack and leave immediately. Since you want to fight, then let’s Fight!”

“The Dragon Gate doesn’t dare to confront Our Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect directly. Cowards, it won’t be long before we completely exterminate you!”

Soon, on the Jianghu website, a group of Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect disciples ridiculed and replied on the Jianghu website. Moreover, there were many such posts. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Seeing the posts of the Holy Medicine and Holy Medicine Immortal sect, the rest of the disciples of the Immortal sect were also slightly silent.

Indeed, the number of infant realm experts in the Holy Medicine and Holy Medicine Immortal Sect was definitely more than sixty. It was even double the number of words.

The reason why the Dragon Gate didn’t dare to block the city gate of the Chaos Origin Immortal sect like the last time was because they were afraid of the experts of the two immortal sects.

The martial artists in the martial arts world took out the strength of the Dragon Gate and the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect to make a detailed comparison.

From this, they came to a conclusion that the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect was not comparable to the chaos origin immortal sect at all. The strength of the Dragon Gate was not comparable to the two immortal sects, and there was even a huge gap between them.

As for the forces in the Dragon Palace, some people guessed that those terrifying swordsmen belonged to the Dragon Palace.

This post of analysis attracted the approval of many people.

“Hehe, Your Holy Medicine and Holy Medicine Immortal sect underestimating the Dragon sect will have to pay a heavy price!”

At the position of the Chaos Origin Immortal Sect, the three immortal gods listened to the information reported by their subordinates, and their faces revealed a cold expression.

The result of the battle between the three immortal sects involved the Chaos Origin Immortal sect. Now, the Chaos Origin Immortal sect was considered a relatively weak existence by the disciples of the immortal sects.

“I’m afraid they don’t know about the existence of the dragon sect and that terrifying strange creature. It’s a terrifying concealment!”

A middle-aged immortal God said coldly.

...

“Dragon King, all the disciples of the two immortal sects outside the holy city have been cleaned up. The holy city has closed two city gates and the east gate is still open. Clearly, they are very confident in their own strength!”

On a mountain peak, Wang Xian stood at the top of the mountain peak. Mo Qinglong reported to Wang Xian.

“Hehe, this is good too. Tomorrow, they will definitely set up an ambush at the east gate. That is their territory. They are more familiar with the terrain than us!”

Wang Xian revealed a cold smile as he looked at the holy city 20 kilometers away. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly. “No matter what, as long as their disciples from the East Gate Dare to go out, they will attack. It’s not certain who will ambush who!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Mo Qinglong nodded.

Night had fallen, and the Jianghu Internet was still bustling with activity. Within the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect, the two great sects had started to set up an inescapable net at the entrance of the city.

Once the Dragon Gate’s experts appeared, they would definitely be able to instantly sense it and kill it.

They were extremely confident that they had the strength.

The two great immortal sects’experts hid at the two sides of the city gate. As long as they gave the order, dozens of experts would be able to act instantly.

Moreover, there were dozens of infant realm experts at the city gate that were ready to provide assistance at any time.

Once the Dragon Gate powerhouses appeared, they would be completely annihilated!

However, what they didn’t know was that many pairs of eyes were staring at them coldly in the sky.

The Sky broke into dawn, and the entire sacred city was bustling with activity. Compared to the chaotic origin city, the attack of the Dragon Gate at the city gate yesterday didn’t affect them too much.

Except for the family members of the disciples of the immortal sect who were killed, they didn’t cause much panic.

This was their confidence in the strength of the immortal sect.

“Take the things, Act according to the plan, and leave the city!”

At nine o’clock in the morning, in the Holy City of the Holy Medicine Immortal Sect, a few infant realm experts said to the hundreds of disciples around them.

“Don’t worry elder, leave it to us. Hehe, I hope that the people of the Dragon Gate can kill their way over!”

The corners of a young disciple’s mouth curled up slightly as he spoke with a face full of smiles.

“Alright!”

A few elders revealed smiles on their faces as they watched them walk out.

Bait, they were acting as bait.

However, even if it was a bait, this group of over a hundred young disciples didn’t have the slightest bit of worry.

Not to mention that they were holding a formation, even if there were dozens of infant realm experts lying in ambush at the side, there were still thirty to forty infant realm experts within the city that were ready to provide assistance at any time.

They had almost reached a hundred infant realm experts, so what was there to be afraid of! !

A group of immortal sect disciples walked out from the East Gate of the sacred city with smiles on their faces.

The group of people walked out and just happened to be facing the sunlight. They walked forward with their heads held high and swaggered over a thousand people, their gazes sizing up their surroundings.

“Where are the experts of the Dragon Gate? Why haven’t They Come Out Yet? Could They be afraid?”

“Our trap this time is very obvious, but it doesn’t matter. Originally, the elders didn’t have much hope this time. However, we have to provoke those that we should provoke!”

“Haha, that’s right. Yesterday, they dared to kill so many disciples of our two great immortal sects. Today, we stand here and see if they dare to make a move.”

“Such an arrogant Dragon Gate. Today, we will kill their spirit!”

More than a hundred young disciples continued to walk forward with smiles on their faces.

After walking for more than two thousand meters, they were already far enough from the city gate.

A young man standing in the middle looked around!

“Dragon Gate Brat, are you only good at sneak attacks? Now that your grandfather is here, come and attack me! Haha!”
