“Big Brother Ba Qi, we can’t kill the race with the undying level 9 abyss species, they have 10 undying level 8 abyss species.”

Within the Abyss, Poison 9 heard that Ba Qi wanted to plot against the race with the undying level 9 abyss species, he opened his eyes wide and asked.

The level 9 abyss species was something they had encountered not long ago, but that race was extremely powerful.

One undying Emperor Level 9 race, 10 level 8 ones, the rest over 800,000, that was quite a number.

With their strength, they could defeat the other party, but they would definitely reveal themselves, attracting the attention of the other races. If they attracted the attention of the emperor, they would be finished.

“Little nine, what kind of existence are we now?”

Mo Sha patted his shoulder and asked earnestly.

“Ah, we... We Are the legendary Divine Dragon Clan. The Divine Dragon clan’s powerful peak dragon species, the poisonous horned dragon species.”

Poison nine was slightly stunned and said.

“What is the most powerful poisonous horned dragon species?”

Mo Sha continued to ask.

“Poison, a powerful poison.”

Poison nine was stunned and said.

“That’s right, it’s not good to just fight and kill. Intelligence is sometimes more important than strength. Let’s go, this time your two brothers will show you what the perverted style is.”

“Jie Jie, Jie Jie!”

Mo Sha said, he couldn’t help but laugh.

“Perverted style?”

Poison 9 was stunned, his face filled with shock.

“Little ones, follow behind us and don’t speak, listen to our orders.”

Ba Qi roared once more, leeching on the abyss seed and flying towards the Undying Level 9 race.

“Howl Howl Howl!”

When Ba Qi and the others flew over, the race let out a warning roar.

“Howl Howl Howl!”

Ba Qi immediately roared a few times, sending a message.

And this message meant: boss in front, we’ve lost many of our comrades to the human warriors, our leader has been killed too, we’ve come to join you, we respect our boss.

“Roar Roar!”

The Undying Level 9 abyss seed looked at Ba Qi and the others, its eyes filled with surprise and joy, lifting its head slightly to scan.

Its race had over 800,000 abyss seeds, but there were only about 1,000 of them at the undying level, and among the abyss seeds flying over.., there were hundreds of them at the undying level (there was a batch of abyss seeds that hadn’t been killed, leaving behind to live on) .

This was a huge boost to his race.

“Howl!”

He roared softly, ordering the 8 qi and the rest to fly over.

“Howl Howl!”

The 8 Qi Devil and the rest responded, flying over directly. Without any warrior dignity, they knelt in front of the undying level 9 abyss species, showing their submission.

Howl

The undying level 9 abyss species roared in satisfaction.

“Howl.”

The 8 Qi turned and roared at Mo Sha.

Mo Sha bowed and took out a large piece of flesh, respectfully handing it to the undying level 9 seed.

“Howl!”

The undying level 9 seed’s eyes lit up, opening its mouth to swallow, a satisfied expression on its face.

“Howl Howl Howl!”

The undying level 9 seed growled, asking if there was any more flesh.

“Howl!”

Mo Sha immediately pointed to the right. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Howl

The level 9 seed immediately ordered Mo Sha to get it.

Mo sha nodded and immediately flew to the right, returning 10 minutes later with a piece of flesh.

Howl

The undying level 9 seed growled and immediately rushed over to swallow it, asking if there was any more.

Mo Sha immediately nodded, he was ordered to continue.

10 minutes later, Mo Sha took another piece.

The undying level 9 seed continued to ask after swallowing, Mo sha still nodded.

“Howl Howl!”

...

This time the undying level 9 seed ordered him to take all of it.

10 minutes later, Mo Sha took some more.

The undying level 9 seed asked again after swallowing.

Mo Sha still nodded.

“Howl!”

The Undying Level 9 abyss seed was enraged, its tail swiping at his body causing blood to appear.

“Howl Howl!”

It looked down and ordered Mo sha to bring it over.

“Howl Howl!”

Beside him, the 8 points roared, wanting to accompany him.

After which, the 8 points immediately led the way respectfully.

...

“This...”

Poison 9 watched from the side as the demon and the 8 Qi lured the Undying Level 9 abyss seed away, stunned.

“Howl Howl!”

Flying over a billion km to the right, there were no more abyss seeds around.

Demon pointed at a meteorite and roared.

The Undying Level 9 abyss seed indeed saw a piece of flesh on the meteorite.

A greedy look appeared in his eyes, his body moved, swiftly flying forward and swallowing it.

“Hehe!”

At this time, Ba Qi and Mo Sha Smiled, their bodies moving, they came before the level 9 undying and let out a roar.

“Howl Howl!”

The Level 9 undying roared in satisfaction.

However very quickly, its expression changed and its body began to tremble.

“Peng!”

“Keke Keke, the effects are acting up.”

At this time, the body of the 8 qi and Mo Sha’s abyss seed exploded, Mo Sha’s powerful energy landed on the head of the Undying Emperor Level 9.

“Parasite!”

The 8 Qi roared, immediately unleashing the poison horned dragon’s parasite ability.

His body was like liquid, rushing straight towards the Undying Emperor Level 9.

It was extremely difficult to parasitize someone of the same level, however this undying emperor level 9 was poisoned and even got hit in the head by Mosha, Ba Qi’s parasitism didn’t encounter much of a hindrance.

“Keke Keke, it worked, it was too easy.”

8 Qi’s excited voice came from the level 9 undying’s mouth.

“Quickly remove the poison, otherwise your body will be heavily injured.”

Mo Sha smiled and reminded.

“Keke.”

The energy within 8 Qi’s body surged, removing the poison within.

The flesh was used by 8 qi and Mo Sha for research. At the start, the Undying Level 9 didn’t have any poison within.

This was to lower its guard, the last piece of flesh on the meteorite was the most important part, it was poisonous.

Normally, an undying level 9 would have felt something was wrong, but if they were careless, they would have been poisoned.

The Eight Point Demon Fiend had changed classes to poison horned dragon, their bodies were formed from poison, it was easy for the poison to heavily injure an undying level 9.

“Don’t waste any energy to kill their leader, eight Qi, go call the 10 undying level 8 abyss species over, I’m already useless as a parasite, I need another one.”

Demon Demon said to eight Qi.

“Keke Keke, no problem, the next abyss will be our world.”
