3502 3501 battle-lord level 3

“Lord, one of them is a powerful Green Dragon. He can instantly kill A Level 2 universe lord. Even two light dragons were killed by him.”

“He has a pair of powerful wings. Not only is it a treasure, but it can also display the speed of a level 3 universe Lord.”

Nine sky plant demon beasts were shuttling through the bottom of the river, and a Sky Plant Demon Beast Warrior reported to the Gold Ring Sky Plant Demon Beast.

“A pure-bred Green Dragon? I can just destroy it and absorb it as nourishment.”

The Gold Ring Sky Plant Demon Beast’s eyes shone, and a look of anticipation appeared on its face.

The Green Dragon was an extremely precious nourishment for him. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

If he could absorb it, he might be able to increase his strength again.

The eight golden hoop sky plant beasts smiled when they saw their lord’s confidence.

Their lord was a mutated existence among the sky plant beasts. He had both wood and gold attributes and was extremely powerful.

The nine experts of the sky plant beasts flew towards the Azure Dragon Palace. They were very fast and the Dragon Palace was not far from them.

At this moment, in the Dragon Palace, the Green Dragon Whisker Shadow was refining this dragon palace.

Wang Xian began to devour all the resources and quickly converted them into Dragon Qi.

Although there were more resources here, there was still some distance to go before Wang Xian could achieve a breakthrough.

It would take some time for the Green Dragon Whisker Shadow to refine this dragon palace.

Furthermore, he could not completely refine it. He could only control this dragon palace simply.

Time passed by, and in front of the Dragon Palace, nine sky plant demon beasts appeared.

They glanced around.

“Hualala!”

Golden branches extended from the Golden Sky Plant Demon Beasts, and a golden mirror appeared.

“They have entered the Dragon Palace. Good, we can catch them in a jar and kill them all!”

He looked at the Dragon Palace and smiled.

“Sir, we can completely lock them in there.”

A sky-planting demonic beast said with shining eyes.

“OK!”

The Golden Ring sky-planting demonic beast nodded and flew to the sky above the Dragon Palace.

“Take out the devouring tree!”

He said.

“Yes, Sir!”

A sky-planting demonic beast waved his arm and a tree flew to the front of the Golden Ring sky-planting demonic beast.

The roots of this tree looked like a huge open mouth!

His roots landed on the tree one by one and waves of energy poured in.

In the next moment, the branches covered the Dragon Palace.

“Guard the four dragon gates. Kill anyone who comes out!”

The golden hoop sky plant ordered.

“Yes, my Lord!”

The eight heaven plant demonic beasts answered. They immediately came to the top of the four dragon gates and covered them with thorns.

“HMM?”

In the Azure Dragon Palace, Wang Xian was sitting cross-legged in the dragon palace absorbing resources. When he sensed the situation outside, he opened his eyes and looked over immediately.

At this moment, the Azure Dragon Whisker Shadow in the Dragon King’s Hall also opened his eyes immediately.

Buzz

With a thought, he could see everything clearly outside the Dragon Palace!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Azure Dragon Moon and the rest flew towards Wang Xian with a solemn expression.

“How is this possible? They escaped back to their divine kingdom in an instant. How did they rush over so quickly?”

An expert from the holy dragon lineage said with an awkward expression.

The expression of the Green Dragon Beard Shadow was also somewhat awkward.

“The opponent is very strong. If My senses are not wrong, he is a level three master of the universe.”

He spoke with a solemn expression.

A level three master of the universe was not someone they could contend against.

“The eight sky plant demonic beasts around are level two masters of the universe.”

Wang Xian sensed the outside and frowned slightly.

Logically speaking, the sky plant demonic beasts and the rest should have escaped back to their divine kingdom. If they wanted to rush over again, it would take a few months at the earliest.

If the distance was relatively far, it was possible to take a few years.

However, the other party had rushed over in just a dozen hours.

This was completely out of their expectations.

The other party had used that tree to entangle the entire Dragon Palace, and they were completely trapped.

Unless they gave up on this dragon palace.

“Not good. I can sense that the space around us has been sealed!”

At this moment, the expression of the Azure Dragon Whisker Shadow changed drastically as he spoke.

Wang Xian sensed for a moment. This space had indeed been completely sealed off.

He looked outside as his eyes sparkled.

“We have to break through. Otherwise, if the other party completely seals off the Dragon Palace, we will be in trouble!”

The Azure Dragon Whisker Shadow looked at Wang Xian with a serious expression and said.

“Brother Azure Dragon Whisker Shadow, how long will it take for you to take control of this Dragon Palace?”

Wang Xian asked him.

“At least three months!”

The figure with the azure dragon beard replied, “After I have basically refined this dragon palace, I will be able to utilize some of its power.”

“Three months?”

Wang Xian pondered for a moment. “I will first lure that level 3 master of the universe away to buy some time. If there is no chance, I will send someone to bring you away!”

“HMM? Dragon King, you want to pin down that master? No, this is too dangerous!”

Green Dragon Moon shook his head immediately.

“Hehe, don’t worry. Since I dare to make a move, I have confidence!”

Wang Xian smiled and squinted his eyes as he stared at the Golden Heaven Plant Demonic Beast.

If it didn’t have a powerful treasure, Wang Xian could definitely pin it down.

“Brother Green Dragon, please take control of this dragon palace as soon as possible. I’ll go out and give it a try.”

Wang Xian continued to speak to them.

“This…”

Qinglong Xuying’s expression changed. He cupped his hands at him and said, “Dragon King, you have to be careful!”

“Don’t worry. A disciple from my dragon palace will come over later. If there’s really no other way, they can bring you guys out of Here!”

Wang Xian spoke to them. His body moved and he flew towards a Dragon Gate.

At the entrance of the Dragon Gate, he set up a devil spirit altar and sent a message to an lie.

After receiving his reply, he stared outside.

“A level three master of the universe, I’ll give it a try today!”

Wang Xian mumbled.

The spirit spirit appeared on his shoulder while the ghost avatar appeared on one side.

The water touch king had been lying on the other shoulder while the five elements millstone was floating above his head.

Around him, the Taiji dragon plate was spreading the news.

In the next moment, his body immediately moved.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The Divine Dragon on the Five Elements Millstone let out a roar and directly blasted away the thorns that covered the Dragon Gate.

“The enemy is starting to counterattack!”

When the two Heaven Plant Demonic Beast powerhouses at the Dragon Gate saw that the thorns that were laid down were broken, their eyes focused, and a ghastly expression appeared on their faces.

They did not hesitate at all and directly bombarded the entrance.
