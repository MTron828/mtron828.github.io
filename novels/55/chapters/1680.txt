Chapter 1681: 1681 life-and-death pill workshop and Holy Item Forging Workshop 1

“We heard that there are some reckless people who dared to provoke our boss. They came from hundreds of thousands of miles away to help our boss kill the enemy. TSK, TSK, tsk!”

Mo Sha shouted loudly. He stood beside Wang Xian and puffed out his chest. He raised his head proudly.

“That’s right!”

Mo Gui Lin, who was on the left, nodded his head heavily and replied loudly. He looked at the people from the life-and-death pill workshop and holy item forging workshop. His eyes were filled with strong killing intent.

“You bunch of reckless people actually dare to be enemies with our boss and even kill the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan. Your crimes are unforgivable!”

As he spoke, a terrifying killing intent directly charged towards the two great factions.

After Mo Sha finished speaking, his eyes were filled with admiration as he nodded his head towards Mo Sha.

This little brother of his could be considered to have a good eye.

The medicine master and the weapon master were completely dumbfounded when they heard Mo Sha and Mo Lin’s words.

Even all the disciples of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop were staring blankly at the Demon God and Mo Lin who were standing beside the young man.

? ? ? ?

Weren’t these two longevity experts here to help them exterminate the fire lark clan?

Why were they facing them now...

At this moment, everyone from the Sacred Fire clan, who was dozens of kilometers away, was looking at this scene in disbelief.

Two longevity experts who came from the sky came to help the two major forces exterminate the fire Lark clan.

Yet, they were standing beside the mysterious young man and were facing the two major forces with killing intent.

This...

“Senior Feng Yun, get ready!”

Wang Xian looked at Mo Sha and Mo Gui Lin who were standing beside him on his left and right as he spoke to Feng Yun.

“Alright!”

Feng Yun recovered from her shock and a mystical glow appeared in her eyes. Her eyes sparkled as she nodded her head heavily.

“All fire cloud sparrow disciples, get ready. With young master Wang around, we will kill our way over today!”

Feng Yun held the staff in her hand tightly in excitement as she shouted loudly.

“Yes, kill! Kill! Kill!”

“Haha, with Young Master Wang around, we will kill our way over and destroy them!”

As soon as Feng Yun’s voice fell, all the Fire Cloud Sparrow clansmen roared with excitement on their faces.

Everything that had happened today was simply too dreamy!

All the hope and power had been brought by the young master Wang that their ancestor had mentioned.

“Kill! Destroy the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop!”

The defensive fireworks around the fiery cloud mountain range dissipated. Everyone from the Fiery Cloud Sparrow clan charged forward with excitement.

“Mo Sha, you guys help Fengyun to fight against the medicine master and the item Master!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered with a cold killing intent as he spoke to Mo Sha and the rest.

“Keke, boss Mo, leave it to us. What Medicine Master and Item Master? They are just two pieces of trash!”

Mo Sha immediately shouted loudly. His eyes were ice-cold as they locked onto the medicine master and Tool Master. They were filled with killing intent.

“You dare to provoke our boss? Die!”

Mo Gui Lin’s body moved and directly attacked the tool master and Tool Master.

“Kill!”

Feng Yun’s eyes shot out terrifying flames when she saw the two of them attacking. She raised the Phoenix staff in her hand and directly stepped on the clouds.

“Demon God, you... you don’t keep your word. Damn it, damn it!”

When Medicine Master and weapon master saw that Mo Sha had helped the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan attack them, they looked extremely embarrassed.

They even had the thought of retreating.

There were three longevity experts on the other side, including the former captain of the fire cloud personal guards and the New Demon God whose demonic aura spread far and wide.

Each of these two people was stronger than them. Now, together with the demonic scale trio, they were working together.

“Kill!”

Wang Xian couldn’t care less about what the medicine master was thinking. He moved his body and took the lead to attack the 200,000-strong army of the two major forces.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

Above his head, the five elements millstone floated and a yin-yang Taiji diagram appeared under his feet.

“Kill, Kill, Kill!”

The expressions of the 200,000 experts of the two major factions changed drastically when they saw the firecloud Sparrow clan charging over.

“Kill!”A group of half-step wanshou experts immediately ordered loudly.

“Kill!”

All the disciples gritted their teeth and roared loudly. However, compared to just now, they had completely lost that invincible aura.

All of them knew that this time, their two major forces were going to fall.

“Five elements Millstone, suppress!”

Wang Xian roared loudly. The five elements millstone with a radius of 20 kilometers appeared directly in the sky.

The gray energy charged directly at the 200,000 people from the two major forces.

“Defend!”

More than 20 half-step longevity experts saw the terrifying five elements millstone and immediately shouted in unison.

“Young master Wang, we are here to help you!”

The elders of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan immediately flew over.

The battle was triggered!

Boom

A terrifying collision was heard and blocked the attacks of Wang Xian and everyone from the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan.

The combined strength of the two major forces was much stronger than the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan.

Take the half-step Wanshou Masters as an example. There were more than 20 of them from the two major forces. On the other hand, the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan and Wang Xian only had about 15 of them.

There was also a gap in the other top-notch combat strength.

“Keke, Boss MO, let me help boss solve some problems!”

At this moment, a gigantic dark palm directly attacked the 20-odd half-step Wanshou Masters in the sky tens of thousands of meters high.

“Oh no!”

“Oh no!”

The medicine master and the weapon master looked extremely embarrassed when they saw mo sha suddenly attacking their subordinates.

The clan elders of the two large forces also revealed expressions of shock.

“Dodge, quickly Dodge!”

The twenty over people hurriedly shouted and fled in all directions.

The Palm of darkness, which covered an area of fifty kilometers, directly descended at a terrifying speed.

All the disciples of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop fled in all directions with terrified expressions!

“Ah!”

“Ah Ah Ah Ah!”

However, soon after, miserable cries sounded out. More than half of the 23 half-step wanshou experts were killed by the terrifying dark palm.

50,000 to 60,000 people were directly killed by Mo Sha’s palm.

The might of a wanshou expert’s palm was so terrifying!

“Jie Jie Jie!”

Mo Sha’s maniacal laughter came from the sky.

“Demon God... you... you are forcing us!”

The medicine master and weapon master, who were entangled by Mo Gui Lin and Feng Yun, roared with bloodshot eyes.

Their auras shook violently. Flames and an ocean engulfed Feng Yun, Mo Sha, and Mo Gui Lin.

At this moment, they could only try their best to pin down the three of them.

Otherwise, as long as one of the three of them attacked with a few moves, all of their subordinates would die.

“Well done!”

Wang Xian looked satisfied when he saw that Mo Sha had helped them to eliminate half of the half-step Wanshou realm experts.

It was a pleasant surprise to meet Mo Sha.

He did not expect Mo Sha to become the demon god of the Demon God tribe of the nine God Empire. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

If he had known about this earlier, he would have gone to the demon God tribe and called Mo sha over to massacre everyone!
