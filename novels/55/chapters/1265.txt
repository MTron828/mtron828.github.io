Chapter 1266: 1267 wreaked havoc

Translator: 5496903

The death of the Earth!

When Wang Xian unleashed his four elemental attacks, a deathly silent aura within a radius of two kilometers suddenly became lively.

The entire area seemed to be wailing, silent, and buried.

A terrifying energy was formed within a radius of two kilometers.

This energy was filled with an aura of destruction.

When Wang Xian sensed this terrifying power, he was also shocked by the terror of this supernatural power.

This was the first time he had used the Earth’s death.

This power could easily kill any powerhouse at level two of the Seethrough realm. Even level three of the Seethrough realm had to be taken seriously.

“What? What kind of power is this?”

The Demon Soul, who was in front of him, had a look of hope. His eyes were filled with panic.

The threat of death instantly enveloped its entire being. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“That is?”

It hurriedly looked behind it, and its eyes instantly widened.

Around that despicable human, a special energy shook the entire space.

The seawater around him actually slowly disappeared under this energy.

This terrifying energy was spreading towards it at a terrifying speed.

“No, no... What kind of attack is this?”

It was filled with fear as it tried its best to fly forward.

The exit was right in front of its eyes.

However, death was even closer to it.

“Five elemental spirit Pearl, Go!”

A pained expression appeared on its face as it gritted its teeth. The five elemental spirit pearl above its head flew towards Wang Xian from above.

The five elemental spirit pearl spun rapidly and emitted an extremely bright flame radiance.

The bright flame collided with the energy from the Battle of the Earth. The flame radiance lit up a space filled with destruction.

Taking advantage of this opportunity, the demon soul rushed towards the exit without any reluctance.

“Five elemental spirit Pearl!”

At this moment, Wang Xian didn’t bother about the demon soul that had escaped. Instead, he flew towards the five elemental spirit pearl with an excited expression.

Buzz

He shook his arm and grabbed the five elemental spirit pearl.

A surge of energy of the five elements spread throughout his body.

“Haha!”

Looking at the Spirit Pearl that contained a huge amount of energy, Wang Xian couldn’t help but laugh.

The five types of spirit pearls were refined into weapons. The five attributes were interwoven together, and they were endless.

Wang Xian waved his arm and the entire five elemental spirit pearl was arranged in a row.

Golden, green, earthy yellow, blue, and red lights.

The five elemental spiritual beads were divided into individual individuals and emitted energy waves that belonged to their own attributes.

“Withdraw!”

Wang Xian opened his mouth and the five elemental spiritual beads entered his stomach directly.

“After a period of nurturing, I will have the five elemental dragon beads. When I take them out to fight, it will increase my combat strength by a lot!”

A smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face as he looked towards the exit.

The figure of the Demon Soul had already disappeared.

“Consider yourself lucky!”

A faint smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face. He wasn’t too concerned about not leaving the demon soul behind.

Compared to the 100,000 spiritual liquid, the five elemental spirit Pearl was more precious.

At this moment, a hollow area appeared around him. It was at the bottom of the sea, but there wasn’t any seawater within a two-kilometer radius.

The seawater in the sky seemed to be afraid of this space and didn’t dare to enter.

The power of the Earth’s death was so terrifying.

Wang Xian’s figure moved and flew into the distance.

Boom

Not long after he left, a huge amount of seawater surged in from that location, producing a loud roar.

Roar! Roar

Wang Xian flew less than ten kilometers on his way back when he heard the roar of a ferocious beast from the side.

He was slightly stunned as he looked down.

“Eh? That’s a ferocious beast at the first level of the Seethrough Realm!”

Looking at the Black Sea Python that was 20 meters long, his body moved. Without any hesitation, he charged forward.

There were many creatures at the Seethrough realm in the land of trials. The highest level among them was at the third level of the Seethrough realm.

With Wang Xian’s current strength, he was an invincible existence in this space.

“The land of trials has spiritual liquid. Moreover, the corpses of ferocious beasts can be used to refine blood essence. I can flatten the entire land of trials. This is especially so for the area of the demonic beasts. They are all aquatic creatures. I can directly devour them!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled as he attacked the Sea Python that was at the first level of the Seethrough realm.

With his strength, it was easy for him to kill a creature at the first level of the Seethrough realm.

In less than 20 seconds, the Sea Python turned into a corpse.

Wang Xian moved his body and transformed into a dragon, devouring it directly.

Following that, he opened his Dragon Eyes of light and dark fire. Wang Xian continued to look in the direction of his surroundings.

He did not return immediately. Instead, he started to wreak havoc in the entire training ground.

If he encountered any ferocious beasts, he would devour them immediately.

Among them, Wang Xian encountered quite a number of demonic beasts in the training ground. There were at least a few hundred of them.

When he encountered these demonic beasts, he did not hesitate at all and killed them directly.

On his body, the demonic spirit token that he obtained from the Mercenary Association was glowing.

Every time he killed a demonic beast, it would glow once.

While Wang Xian was wreaking havoc in the training ground of the demon race, those demonic beasts that were lucky enough to escape danger had spread the news of this place.

“Humans are indeed despicable and shameless. They actually used a cheating method to send powerhouses to the training grounds. Damn it, humans should be exterminated!”

“Many of our tribesmen were killed by the humans in the training grounds. I swear that I will devour them when I see them in the future!”

“We want revenge. We want revenge. The Heaven’s Pride Bridge will open in a few days. When that time comes, we will kill the human’s Heaven’s pride and kill them!”

Within the demi-human race, there was a wave of anger. As for the powerful demi-human’s Heaven’s pride, they were even more furious and vowed to take revenge.

Each of the powerful demi-human’s Heaven’s pride stared coldly in the direction of the humans. Their eyes were filled with a crazed killing intent.

“Haha!”

However, at this very moment, in the training grounds, the despicable human, Wang Xian, who made countless of demi-humans gnash their teeth, let out an excited laugh and devoured the second level void interpretation beast in front of him.

In the lair of this aquatic beast, there were still more than 5,000 spiritual liquid.

Wang Xian began to devour crazily in the entire training ground.

In just a short span of more than ten hours, almost all the creatures in the training ground of the Demonic Beast region were slaughtered.

In the entire region, the aquatic creatures, coupled with the gains from the spiritual liquid, allowed him to increase by a total of about 100 million dragon crystals.

This was definitely a huge resource.

“Let’s go to the humans’side. There are no aquatic creatures in the humans’side. The gains might not even reach one-third of what we have here. However, this is not a small amount!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled as he passed through the layer of formation and entered the human’s trial area.

With his invincible strength, he continued to kill and wreak havoc!
