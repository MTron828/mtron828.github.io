Chapter 453: The Seething Underworld

“He’s declaring war with one Sacred Sect and another seven first-class forces. This is indeed the style of Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown.”

“They will be having a Pilgrimage three days frrom now. They will receive the enemy on the first day and accept Pilgrimage on the second day. What great confidence he has.”

“Dragon King of Dragon Sect. From now on, the entire Underworld will be seething with this!”

The remaining forces marveled at that young man who spoke boldly at the Outstanding Young Heroes Competition ground.

Even those Sacred Sects over there felt the tremble in their hearts.

They would have to look up to this young man in the future.

The founder of the Sacred Sect, Dragon King!

“Let’s go!”

Wang Xian scanned everyone with the corner of his lips drawn. He looked at Xiao Yu and the rest beside him with a beaming face.

The Dragon Sect was established, and their name was known in the Underworld.

Next, the Sacred Sects would begin competing with each other. He wanted the Dragon Sect to dominate Underworld and rise above any Sacred Sects.

“The Dragon Sect will take over the ranking of the supreme talents this year!”

Mo Qinglong walked behind and cast a glance at the gigantic Named Cliff with the corner of his lips slightly drawn.

He made a move with his huge Claws of the Devil Dragon, raking them across the Named Cliff.

Bam, Bam, Bam!

The dust from the rocks fell off as Mo Qinglong swung his dragon claws from top to bottom. In another swift movement, he returned to behind Wang Xian again.

All of them watched Wang Xian and the gang in silence. None of them dared to utter a word.

When they saw Mo Qinglong fly to the Named Cliff, they looked over.

The cold Eastern breeze swept in as the two powerful words appeared on the Named Cliff.

Dragon Sect.

The calligraphy that seemed to be dancing was filled with unlimited mightiness.

At the entrance, everyone took the initiative to give way to them as they looked at them in awe.

“The Outstanding Young Heroes Chart this time seemed to be prepared for Dragon Sect. Hehe, this bunch of young men took over the rankings like a breeze.”

“This is too sick. How on earth did they get their powerful strength at such a young age?”

“I’m afraid bloodshed is brewing in the Underworld three days from now!”

Until those groups of figures disappeared, all of them watched silently. The rest of the Sacred Sects and Sacred Clans in the field began to stalk out slowly.

“Amitabha, this is a terrifying Sacred Sect. All of them are young Inborn Experts!” said the Flower Monk flatly as he fiddled with his bloody beads with a stern look.

“Interesting. It’s great that the Underworld gets chaotic. It’s time for us, the diabolism they regarded us as, to rise!”

The ominous-looking young man widened his mouth as he swept his gaze across the surrounding experts of the Underworld. With a bloodthirsty look on his face, he said, “The bloodshed is going to start again in the Underworld!”

“Amitabha. I used up half of my beads in the combat just now. It’s time to collect some back!”

A bloodthirsty aura surfaced on the Flower Monk’s face as he looked around. As he put his palms together, he lowered his head slowly.

The ominous-looking young man looked at him coldly before he strode to his sedan.

Before his sedan, the four middle-aged men stood there without moving an inch. Their faces paled as they sensed a faint domineering aura from the Half-step to Inborn.

“To strengthen the Devil Corpse Palace, I need more corpses of the experts!”

The ominous-looking young man looked at the four middle-aged men with a vague murderous look. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

He sat in the sedan and headed out.

“Wow, the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart has been updated!” Xiao Yu exclaimed fervently as she checked her phone when the gang was in the car heading towards Rivertown.

“Why, Xiao Yu? Are you number one?” Elder Fang asked with a smiling face from beside her.

“No, it’s not me!”

Xiao Yu pouted with slight unhappiness. “I was the one who defeated the Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island. Instead of giving me first place, they gave it to my brother. So unfair!”

“What an uncrowned champion. This is shady. Didn’t they say no rankings for those who didn’t participate in the competition?” Xiao Yu remarked with dissatisfaction while the rest around her chuckled.

“Establishing a Sacred Sect at the age of 20. Do you think he needs to get in the arena? Besides, you’re his sister. How could anyone think Xiao Xian is weaker than you?” said Guan Shuqing to Xiao Yu smilingly.

“That is still unfair. The championship should be mine. The first female champion in history!”

Xiao Yu trotted to Wang Xian with displeasure. But subsequently, she exclaimed with excitement, “Brother, you were simply dashing just now!”

“I have always been dashing!” Wang Xian chuckled.

“The entire Underworld is heated. All of them are discussing Dragon Sect. Brother, the Medical Saint Sect, and Qiao Clan are quite strong. If they really turn up in three days, do we need to get those babies from the Dragon Palace in advance? Haha, and that blue whale of a sister-in-law, Qingyue. I’m sure it will freak them out!”

Xiao Yu held Wang Xian’s arm as she commented excitedly, using her imagination.

“Do we need the members of Dragon Palace to be here? Till then, you can just transform into the invincible Divine Dragon and take down a Sacred Sect all by yourself!” said Wang Xian jokingly.

“Brother...You...”

Xiao Yu stared at him furiously. The moment she thought of what she looked like after the transformation, her hair stood on end.

If she had to turn into a Divine Dragon for an extended period, she would be infuriated by her own appearance.

“Okay, Xiao Yu is the cutest of all,” said Wang Xian hurriedly upon seeing her angry look.

“I hope all of them will come in three days. Otherwise, the Dragon Sect will need to take the trouble to seek them out one by one!”

A trace of murderous intent flashed in Wang Xian’s eyes as he spoke.

He would not let any one of them off who wanted his life.

He would not let off all the forces like Medical Saint Sect, Qiao Clan, Wu Family, and so on.

They had to pay a bloody price for what they’d done today.

The vehicle continued its way to Rivertown.

They arrived in Rivertown in the evening.

When they entered the city, a fleet of luxurious cars emerged out of nowhere around them.

More them hundreds of them drove by the side of their cars.

Without any communication, these cars lined up in a row in front of them.

With car plates of Rivertown, they escorted the car to the villa.

Subsequently, these people in the luxurious cars did not get out and drove off immediately.

All the big shots of Rivertown were sitting in the cars as they swept a glance with awe at the villa.

That was the house of the Dragon King, founder of a Sacred Sect.

It was the sacred ground of all people in Rivertown.

Wang Xian smiled at those families and magnates who curried favors. Back in the villa, he lay on the sofa comfortably, sipping a cup of tea. He took out his phone and scrolled through the updates in the Underworld.

[Dragon King established a Sacred Sect with fifty Inborn Experts!]

[Unparalleled Dragon King emerged as the champion of the Outstanding Young Heroes. The most terrifying young man, Wang Xian, the Dragon King!]

[Dragon Sect’s Pilgrimage in three days. Will it perish or shock the Underworld?!]

[Newly-established Dragon King issued a Dragon Sect killing order to Medical Saint Sect, Qiao Clan, Wu Family and...]

The Underworld was once again shaken up because of Wang Xian, and this time, it was unprecedented heat!
