Chapter 764: 0765 strong sound waves to attract fish (2/5)

Translator: 549690339

Ring, Ring, ring

Before he got close, Wang Xian heard a series of unique sounds.

The sounds were very strange and had a special attraction.

“Sound of the Soul?”

Feng Luan’s surprised voice flashed across her eyes as she looked ahead.

At this moment, Wang Xian, Feng Luan, and the DRAKONID were flying on the surface of the ocean like an abyss as they looked into the distance.

A beautiful green figure was standing on the peculiar aquatic plants on the surface of the sea. A beautiful zither was floating in front of her. The sound came from the zither.

Wang Xian was also looking at Tang Yinxuan curiously.

Compared to the previous zither sound, her current zither sound was much more unpleasant. It was even a little off-key.

“Yinxuan!”

Wang Xian flew over and shouted at Tang Yinxuan. He looked around and realized that the DRAKONID was not around.

“Wang Xian!”

Tang Yinxuan smiled when she saw Wang Xian coming over.

She took a glance at Feng Luan and greeted with a smile, “Shuqing, you’re awake!”

However, Feng Luan was in control of her physical body now. She ignored Tang Yinxuan and looked at her curiously.

This caused Tang Yinxuan to be slightly stunned.

“Yinxuan, why are you playing the zither here? Where are the other DRAKONIDS?”

Wang Xian looked at him curiously and asked.

“I’m doing an experiment!”

Tang Yinxuan moved and came to Wang Xian’s side. She pointed at a fish that was tied up.

“This is an earthstar fish that we caught. It’s tied up with a rope. Look!”

As she spoke, she stared at the zither in front of her with both hands.

“Ring, Ring, Ring!”

A very special sound was heard. Following that, the earthstar fish swam towards her rapidly.

Wang Xian was slightly stunned as he stared at the Earthstar fish that was wagging its tail. Half of its body was khaki and the other half was green. There was a bump on its head, and it was also khaki and green in color. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Voice of the soul, longevity fish!”

The Flames at the corner of Feng Luan’s eyes throbbed. Her eyes were filled with flames as she stared at the ocean abyss beneath her. A thoughtful look appeared on her face.

“What are you doing? Attracting?”

Wang Xian revealed a look of surprise as he said to Tang Yinxuan.

“Yes, attracting. Through some communication with it, I can use sound waves to attract it over. If the experiment is completed, I can use sound waves to attract the earth star fish over!”

Tang Yinxuan’s eyes lit up as she said, “Through this method, we will be able to obtain many earth star fish!”

“However, the current attraction is still a little off. I can only be certain when the DRAKONIDS catch another Earth star fish!”

When Wang Xian heard her words, he looked at Tang Yinxuan in astonishment. “If we succeed, how many Earth Star Fish will we be able to attract?”

“Within a radius of ten kilometers, with my cultivation, I can at most cover a radius of ten kilometers!”

Tang Yinxuan hesitated for a moment before replying.

“A radius of ten kilometers is completely enough. If we succeed, we can capture more than half of the earth star fish in the entire mysterious ocean!”

Wang Xian’s face lit up.

The value of an earth star fish was comparable to a grade-6 elixir. If there were hundreds or thousands of them, it would definitely be a terrifying income. If he exchanged them for elixirs, he could easily become a superior immortal.

“Dragon King, Miss Tang, we’ve caught an earthstar fish!”

At this moment, DRAKONIDS emerged from the bottom of the sea. One of them held an earthstar fish in his hand and said.

“We’ve finally caught the second one. It’s really difficult to catch only two in three days!”

A smile appeared on Tang Yinxuan’s face. She took out a rope from her interspatial ring and tied it up.

This earthstar fish was only the size of a palm, and it contained a very strong life force.

The Earthstar Fish had an extremely fast speed in the water, and it was very small. It was very difficult to catch it.

If not for the fact that the ten drakonids were all at the infant stage and had the Divine Dragon bloodline, it would be considered pretty good if they could catch one.

The Mysterious Sea was too big and too deep. Moreover, there were some powerful creatures in the water, and some of them were comparable to the infant stage.

“There are two earth star fish here. I can ensure that I can attract them over. However, I need to test it out for a while!”

Tang Yinxuan continued to speak to Wang Xian. She took out the zither and began to test it out.

Wang Xian watched from the side with a smile. If this was successful, it would be considered a considerable profit.

“I want to go to the bottom of the sea to take a look!”

At this moment, the voice of Feng Luan suddenly came from the side.

Wang Xian looked at her and frowned slightly. “Why are you going to the bottom of the sea?”

“These fish are called longevity fish. There are such fish in the Sea of longevity in our super-developed continent!”

Feng Luan said something that puzzled Wang Xian.

“You discovered my blood essence in this world. It’s possible that there is some connection between the two worlds!”

“I want to go and take a look!”

As Feng Luan spoke, her body moved and she flew directly to the bottom of the sea.

“You...”

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly. His body moved and he grabbed her body. He stared at her coldly and said, “This is not your body!”

Feng Luan was stunned when she saw Wang Xian grabbing her arm. “Don’t worry. Nothing will happen. There are no transcendents in your world. No one can keep me here. This is very important to me!”

Wang Xian heard the helplessness in her eyes and his heart softened. He stared at her with a twinkle in his eyes. “You have to come up in half an hour. Otherwise, I will think of a way to suppress the fire energy in Shu Qing’s body in the future!”

“Alright!”

Feng Luan frowned slightly and nodded.

Wang Xian let go of her arm and nodded at her.

She moved and flew directly to the bottom of the sea at a terrifying speed.

“Is there a connection with her world?”

Wang Xian frowned slightly. If there was a connection with the supernatural world she mentioned, he might have to step into that world in the future.

“Ring, Ring, Ring!”

“It’s a success, it’s a success!”

Just as he was thinking, Tang Yinxuan’s happy voice came from the side.

Wang Xian looked over and noticed that Tang Yinxuan was moving while playing the zither. The Earth Star Fish had been following by her side as if they were attracted by a strong force!

“Do you want to give it a try now?”

Wang Xian moved to Tang Yinxuan’s side and said to her.

“Sure!”

Tang Yinxuan nodded her head heavily and looked at the surrounding drakonids. “All of you enter the water and observe the area within a five-kilometer radius. See if there are any earth star fish swimming over!”

“Yes!”

The group of DRAKONIDS nodded their heads and entered the bottom of the sea.

“Phew!”

Tang Yinxuan took a deep breath and glanced at Wang Xian.

“Give it a try. I’ll stand guard by the side for you!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Okay!”

Tang Yinxuan nodded her head and placed her hands on the zither. A special sound rang out.

There was a special rhythm to the sound. When it landed on the water, it emitted waves that spread out in the surroundings!
