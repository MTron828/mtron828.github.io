3585 3584, destroy the experts of the three great races

“Hehehe, it’s a success. The Dragon King and the others have succeeded. Disciples of the god Herding clan, your doomsday has arrived. Do you want to destroy our Dragon Palace?”

Mo Sha, who was located in the Central Palace of the grotto-heaven blessed land, roared with a sinister face. With a move of his palm, a wave of energy was transmitted to the area below!

At the same time, the powerful defense around the grotto-heaven blessed land slowly began to dissipate!

The defense had disappeared!

Inside the grotto-heaven paradise, Ba Qi, who was parasitizing the guardian deity, revealed a smile on his face!

Outside, Wang Xian also revealed a smile when he saw this scene!

“What’s going on? The defense of our grotto-heaven paradise seems to have disappeared? What’s going on?”

“Hiss, what happened? Why did the defense suddenly disappear? How did it disappear so quickly?”

“No, no, no, the defense is gone, the defense is gone!”

The sudden disappearance of the defense of the grotto-heaven blessed land stunned all the disciples of the Mu God clan. Their bodies trembled as they roared in horror!

How did the defense suddenly disappear?

Was it dissolved by the terrifying treasure of the Dragon Palace? Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

How could it be so strange!

“Hahaha, disciples of the Mu God clan, die!”

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The defense of the grotto-heaven paradise disappeared, and the powerhouses of the Dragon Palace let out cold roars.

Ao Qitian and the rest did not hesitate at all and flew directly into the grotto-heaven paradise!

The terrifying energy was wreaking havoc in the grotto-heaven paradise!

“No, no, no, no!”

A voice of fear and despair came from the mouths of the disciples!

Wang Xian’s figure moved, and he instantly rushed up with a cold smile on his face!

The strongest among the disciples of the herdsman clan was only at the level of a universe knight. How could they resist against Wang Xian and his group of more than 40 Level 3 universe masters?

With a sweep of the energy, countless disciples were easily killed.

They couldn’t even escape!

Wang Xian waved his arm and a demonic altar appeared in front of him!

“Leave no one alive. Let’s finish this battle quickly!”

Ao Qitian and the rest roared. The disciples of the herdsman clan were quickly annihilated!

Forty Level 3 universe masters with combat strength were attacking at the same time. It was absolutely devastating in this small space!

In less than a second, all the disciples of the herdsman clan were killed!

Only those disciples with Resurrection Treasures escaped the calamity!

“Dragon King!”

After these disciples were killed, an Lie’s figure appeared!

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the surrounding experts of the Dragon Palace and gave an order!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

One by one, the experts of the Dragon Palace flew over and arrived around an lie!

The next moment, their figures left!

There wasn’t even a corpse in the blessed land of the god Shepherd tribe!

“Dragon Palace, you are courting death!”

At this moment, figures were flying over from the deeper parts of the god Mu clan. Their bodies were emitting terrifying auras!

The patriarch of the god Mu clan was at the front. He stared in the direction of the Blessed Land and let out a furious roar!

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

At this moment, hundreds of figures flew over from the left and right sides. They were also emitting vast and terrifying energy!

They were the experts of the black fog spirit race and the corpse-eating ghost race!

Before they left, the six great races had already set up interconnecting arrays so that they could quickly gather together!

“Oh?”

The experts of the Mu God race, the Black Fog Spirit race, and the corpse-eating ghost race flew over. As they got closer to the center, they revealed astonished expressions!

They didn’t sense any powerful energy in front of them. They didn’t even sense any living beings in front of them!

“What’s going on?”

A peak expert of the Mu God clan revealed an astonished expression. His gaze focused as he slightly increased his speed!

The patriarch of the Mu God clan also increased his speed as he rushed towards the grotto-heaven blessed land!

“This… this…”

However, when they saw the situation in the grotto-heaven blessed land, their faces were filled with astonishment and shock!

“How did the defense of the grotto-heaven blessed land disappear? Where are the disciples of our God Mu Clan? Where are the people of the Dragon Palace? What Happened?”

A peak expert of the god Mu clan growled in a low voice!

The patriarch of the god Mu clan stared ahead and suddenly had a bad premonition!

He immediately came to the sky above the Mu God clan’s grotto-heaven blessed land!

“What’s going on? Patriarch of the Mu God clan?”

The patriarchs of the Black Fog Spirit clan and the corpse-eating ghost clan flew over and asked curiously!

The Patriarch of the Black Fog Spirit clan scanned his surroundings. He had an extremely sharp nose, as though he could smell anything!

“I can smell death. There were countless deaths and injuries down here just a dozen seconds ago!”

The Patriarch of the Black Fog Spirit Race said with a grave expression!

His words caused the patriarch’s body to tremble, and his expression turned extremely ugly!

“A disciple of our Mu God race…”

When the surrounding experts of the Mu God race heard this, their eyes turned slightly red!

“My God Kingdom!”

The patriarch’s body trembled, and his God kingdom appeared behind him!

With a wave of his arm, a book flew out of his divine kingdom!

On the book, there were five big words written on the Patriarch’s family tree!

He flipped open the family tree and saw the words on it. His eyes almost popped out of their sockets!

The names on the family tree had decreased by 70% !

This also meant that 70% of their disciples had died!

“Dragon Palace, Dragon King!”

The patriarch of the shepherds, who was holding the family tree in his hand, let out a mournful roar!

70% of their disciples had died. This was the foundation of their shepherds!

How Long would it take for them to recover?

“All the disciples of our shepherds in the grotto-heaven blessed land have been killed. All of them have been killed!”

Around them, the experts of the shepherds trembled when they saw the furious patriarch. Their eyes were bloodshot!

Seventy percent of their disciples had been killed. This was an irreconcilable feud!

“Hiss, this… this… We rushed here so quickly, but our disciples were still killed?”

When the experts of the Black Fog Spirit clan and the corpse-eating ghost clan saw this scene, their expressions changed slightly!

The attack of the Dragon Palace was simply too fast!

The patriarch and the others had rushed over after receiving the message. Just like that, they were still too late!

They were shocked that they had broken through the defense of the blessed land so quickly!

“Hu hu!”

The experts of the shepherds were breathing fast, and their faces were extremely ugly!

The experts of the black fog spiritual race and the Ghoul tribe also had ugly expressions!

The Dragon Palace was stronger than they had imagined, and more cunning than they had imagined!

“Dragon Palace, I want all of your disciples to enjoy millions of years of torture. I want every one of your disciples to live in endless torture and pain. I want you to beg for Death!”

The patriarch of the god Mu clan raised his head and roared with a ferocious face!

He wanted to avenge his disciples and make the Dragon Palace pay ten times or a hundred times the price!
