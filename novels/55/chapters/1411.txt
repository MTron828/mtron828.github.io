Chapter 1412: 1412 came to the imperial study in disguise

“They are just like a bunch of robbers. They don’t want to pay anything and want to enter the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty. HMPH!”

“Isn’t it just having eight to nine thousand years of history? So What?”

The disgruntled voices of a few girls came from inside. Wang Xian glanced at the group of people who had left.

“What’s going on? Why are the people from the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop here?”

Wang Xian entered the imperial study room and looked at the group of girls inside. He asked in puzzlement.

“Xiao Xian, you’re here?”

The group of girls immediately revealed a look of joy when they saw him enter.

“The life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop are here to issue an ultimatum. After rejecting them this time, I reckon they will use some means!”

Feng Luan frowned and said to Wang Xian.

“What’s wrong? Can’t the fire lark stop them?”

Wang Xian frowned as well and asked worriedly.

“Stopping them is only temporary. Although the other party can not directly send experts to destroy our dynasty, they can use their powerful forces and financial resources to target us!”

Feng Luan’s eyes flickered. “Just now, I had already taken a step back and was willing to cooperate with them. 70% to 30% , but they still didn’t agree. These two forces are too overbearing!”

“If the other party were to play some tricks, it might bring a great disaster to the dragon and Phoenix Empire!”

Wang Xian frowned and looked at her.

“According to the style of these two forces, they might not want to play any tricks. Instead, they would directly suppress them with a powerful force!”

Feng Luan guessed.

“If it’s a direct confrontation, we can still deal with them. We still have to increase our strength!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were sparkling as he said.

With his current strength, he could fight against a sixth level void interpretation. This strength was considered pretty good, but it was only limited to the region of flowing sea.

If it was placed in the vast region, or even the region of the five empires, it would not be enough.

“Forget it. We will be flooded in the future.”

Feng Luan shook her head helplessly and rubbed the space between her eyebrows.

In the past year or so, there were simply too many things that she needed to worry about.

The dragon-phoenix dynasty had just risen, and there were simply too many things that needed to be dealt with.

“Sister Feng Luan, didn’t you say that you wanted to go out and take a stroll in disguise? Why don’t you ask Little Xian to come with you and we’ll take a good stroll around these great rivers and mountains!”

Little Yu said with great interest.

“That’s good too. Some cities reflect some things, so we can go and take a look too!”

Feng Luan nodded.

Politics did not happen overnight. Some policies were implemented, but whether they were implemented or not, Feng Luan did not know.

If she wanted to truly understand, she still needed to personally go and take a look.

To experience the people’s livelihood and see the hardships of the people, she could better solve the problem.

Only then would the entire dynasty support the dragon and Phoenix Dynasty even more.

Although this world was a world of martial arts, powerful martial arts could suppress everything.

However, the prosperity of a dynasty depended not only on martial arts, but also on policies.

Those who gained the hearts of the people would obtain the world.

After gaining the hearts of the people, the geniuses, geniuses, and experts from a city would want to join the dynasty and the army.

Naturally, the dynasty would become stronger and stronger!

“Alright, I’ve stayed in the Dragon Palace for a year. It just so happens that I want to come out and have a look!”

Wang Xian nodded and said with a smile.

“Then let’s get ready and set off!”

The group of girls said happily.

The third year of the Dragon and Phoenix Dynasty calendar, the Dragon and Phoenix Queen visited in disguise.

...

“The dragon-phoenix dynasty is courting death. How dare they shut us out of the life-death pill workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop? If it wasn’t for the problems in the central continent, we would have sent out experts to destroy them! “Do they really think that they can ignore us just because they’ve unified more than 20 dynasties and have more than 200 cities? !”

“Now that the dragon-phoenix Dynasty doesn’t put us in their eyes, we’ll let them know the consequences. Otherwise, there might be more dynasties that don’t put us in their eyes in the future!”

“Each and every small dynasty dares to be so arrogant. The Lord Manager has already learned about this. The Lord Manager has already gone to the blood flow dynasty!”

“Blood flow dynasty? Could it be that our Lord Manager wants the blood flow dynasty to make a move?”

“If our life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop join hands, besides strength, we also have financial resources. As long as we can bring out something that makes the blood flow dynasty interested, they will make a move!”

At this moment, outside the dragon-phoenix Empire, five people rode on void interpretation level beasts with cold expressions as they flew into the distance.

They wore the clothes of the life and Death Pill Workshop and holy item forging workshop, and they emitted a faint killing intent.

From ancient times until now, other than the powerful empires, no dynasty would dare not let their life and Death Pill Workshop and holy item forging workshop enter.

The Dragon and Phoenix Empire was one, and it was only one dynasty!

A dynasty? Did they really think that they could match up to the Empire? What a joke?

...

“The location in front is the ice and Snow Empire. The closest city to us is the wind and frost city. The first city we went to was here!”

Feng Luan was in disguise.

Wang Xian and the seven girls had followed her out for three days and arrived at the first city. It was a city 50,000 kilometers away from the dragon and Phoenix Empire.

This city could be considered to be far away from the emperor. Feng Luan mainly wanted to come to these cities to take a look.

“Wow, this city is dressed in plain silver. It’s so beautiful!”

The few girls looked at the city in front of them and said with sparkling eyes.

“Keep a low profile when you’re there. All of you are traveling incognito, not tourists!”

Wang Xian reminded them when he saw the group of girls in high spirits.

“Hehe, we can also enjoy the scenery!”

The group of them came to the city that was covered by snow and wind and landed on the ground.

Apart from Wang Xian and the group of girls, Feng Luan also brought two people. One was Mang Hong and the other was an old lady. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The old lady was also a powerhouse at the level of the Seethrough void tier. She was also at level four of the Seethrough void tier. She was an elder of a dynasty.

After she was subdued by Feng Luan, she was kept by her side because she had the highest loyalty.

Mang Hong’s strength had also reached profound void tier 4, and he was one of the pillars of the dragon and Phoenix dynasty.

The group walked toward wind frost city. As a city, there were quite a number of strangers coming and going, so many people were curious about them.

After all, most of them were great beauties.

“This city is so beautiful. There’s snow everywhere. It’s so unique!”

After entering the city, the group of girls looked around curiously.

“Make way, make way!”

At this moment, two berating voices came from behind.

“Huh?”

Feng Luan and the others hadn’t gone far when they heard this unscrupulous voice, causing her to frown slightly.

The carriages pulled by the snow beasts sped forward.

Feng Luan looked at the carriage, slightly displeased!
