Chapter 531: The Fearless

One Budding Realm expert, five Dan Realm experts, and a hundred and fifty Inborn experts.

The scales on their bodies were the best protection and swords in their hands the ultimate weapons.

With these, the Golden Swordfish appeared to be Pinnacle Inborn experts armed with Inborn Spiritual Weapons and a similar level of armor.

“Bring the Golden Swordfish with us tomorrow!” proclaimed Wang Xian as he let out a glimpse of a smile. With the Golden Swordfish adding to the strength of Dragon Sect, that would make up a good two hundred Inborn experts which far exceeded the strength of Donghua Sacred Sect. Although this formation may be slightly inferior to the alliance of orthodox sects, it was definitely strong enough to strike awe across the underworld.

“Fearless I shall be...tomorrow!” Wang Xian smirked.

All the while, Nie Wushuang was the main thing stopping him from confronting Donghua Sacred Sect.

Based on his estimation, Nie Wushuang should be at the level of the Budding Realm by now. Still, his actual power at that level remained unknown.

If his power were to be on par with Wang Xian, then Dragon Sect would not have any edge over Donghua Sacred Sect.

However, with the Golden Swordfish on my side, be it Donghua Sacred Sect, or any other sect of Diabolism, I’ll whack the hell out of you people!

A tinge of gladness was seen in his eyes.

Showdown Day! Peak of Huashan!

As the sun rose, today marked an important day for the entire Underworld, as it concerned the future of the Underworld.

Families and ancestral sects from all over the country flocked to Huashan.

Unlike the Outstanding Young Heroes Competition, today’s battle concerned everyone’s lives.

With all the martial artists making their way to Huashan, one could expect no less than hundreds of thousands of martial artists from the Underworld to gather here. This is not a word of exaggeration.

“I wonder if the Dragon King will turn up for the duel today.”

“I’d think so. But I’d rather he didn’t. It seems that something terrible is going to happen with him around!”

“I don’t think he will go since he has offended both the orthodox sects and Diabolism after annihilating the Remains and several experts from the Donghua Sacred Sect a couple of days ago. He would be in trouble if Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi decided to get even with him...”

“With the Dragon King’s unpredictable behavior, one can’t be too sure.”

All Martial Artist families had gathered in the Jiang City, heading towards Huashan as their destination. Old Xue, and the Ren and Duan families were exchanging conversations.

The Dragon King came from Rivertown, and they were also the ones who had witnessed his rise.

Nonetheless, never in their wildest dreams did they expect that the young lad back then would make his mark on the Underworld today.

Old Xue, in particular, had emotions that were even more stirred up for the fact that the Dragon King had unblocked his meridians for him. Due to this, he could advance to Half-step to Inborn Realm which was considered to be rather remarkable in the Underworld.

“Do you have any idea whether the Dragon King will be going, Old Xue?” asked Ren Family Head after moments of hesitation.

All eyes were on Old Xue, as they knew very well that he and the Dragon King were on good terms.

Moreover, the Dragon King must have played a part in Old Xue’s advancement. Otherwise, they did not believe an elder Martial Artist could have skipped a few levels within a year.

“Yes, he’ll be there,” muttered Old Xue, with much bitterness.

Upon hearing the much-expected answer, the Martial Artists shook their heads slowly, “One can only hope that nothing too disastrous will happen.”

“The fate of the Underworld lies in the hands of this battle!”

...

“Just as Dragon Sect announced its establishment at Huashan, the taking of the Underworld by Dragon Sect shall happen right here as well!”

Looking at the mountains in the distance, a trace of arrogance flashed across Wang Xian’s face.

With fifty disciples of the Dragon Sect and 156 members from the Golden Swordfish behind Wang Xian, the group hurried to Huashan at lightning speed.

From afar, Wang Xian saw many Martial Artists gathered at Huashan, and the number was a good dozen times more compared to the Outstanding Young Heroes Competition. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Each and every martial artist was armed with weapons, fully prepared for a great battle.

Huashan was not only expecting martial artists from the Underworld today, but those from Diabolism as well.

Although it had been set that the orthodox sects and Diabolism would not fight against each other on this very day, no one could be sure of that.

“Let’s head over!” Wang Xian commanded.

With his two hundred men, Wang Xian dismounted in a quiet corner and walked gradually towards the entrance of Huashan.

“Who do you guys think is likely to emerge as the winner for today’s duel?”

“Undoubtedly, our Sect Leader Nie Wuya. He topped the Underworld as the strongest expert half a century ago, and he took the lives of numerous experts then. Our victory in that battle fifty years ago was owed largely to him. Thus, history shall repeat itself today!”

“Emperor Qi of the Devil Corpse Palace is equally competent. He must have been very confident with himself to have challenged Sect Leader Nie Wuya.”

“We shall give our support to Sect Leader Nie Wuya! Emperor Qi from Diabolism shall be killed!”

“That’s right! We shall support Sect Leader Nie Wuya!”

Many discussions were going on in the surroundings as all of Huashan was swamped with Martial Artists. Wang Xian was able to see groups of sect disciples dressed in uniform attire, not too long into his walk.

With a faint smile on his face, Wang Xian glanced briefly at them while continuing on his way ahead.

“Hey, that is...? That’s Dragon Sect and the Dragon King!” someone exclaimed, drawing the attention of all martial artists to look at Wang Xian in astonishment.

“To think the King of Dragon Sect had the nerve to come. That’s truly dauntless of him!”

“Precisely, he still has the guts to be here after beheading so many experts of Donghua Sacred Sect just yesterday. Isn’t he afraid that Sect Leader Nie Wushuang will take revenge?”

“And Diabolism is not going to let him off lightly for killing the Remains either. It’s daring of him to be here!”

“Look, the Dragon King has many more followers than before. Are they the new disciples of the Sect? Why is it that I cannot sense their inner power? Besides, they are not wearing any masks or wings? They must be the latest disciples groomed by Dragon Sect!”

Wang Xian and his followers had instantly become the center of attention after making their appearance as everyone was making comments discreetly about them.

With the Dragon King gaining “the greatest slayer of unparalleled experts” as his latest title, one would refrain from making comments about him openly. Otherwise, one could end up being finished off by him at any time.

The Dragon Sect was said to be an unkind sect, as it had been perceived as a Sacred Sect of both righteousness and evil.

Very soon, the news of the Dragon King being here with his group of disciples at Huashan went around.

Many sects and families were slightly surprised by their showing up.

“Let’s hope the Dragon Sect and Dragon King will not bring any misfortune to us at Huashan today!”

“Misfortune bestowed in the presence of the Dragon King. This is, however, unlikely to happen today. With powers of the entire Underworld and Diabolism coming together, the Dragon King is expected to take a low profile!”
