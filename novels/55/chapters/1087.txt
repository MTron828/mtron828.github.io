Chapter 1088: 1089 was guarding the city by himself

Translator: 5496903

“Ah!”

With a miserable scream, the Blood Barbarian Demonic Beast, who was at transcendent level nine, widened his eyes. His eyes were filled with fear.

He could not believe it. He could not believe how Wang Xian had discovered him.

The blood shadows that filled the sky were one of the most powerful abilities of the blood barbarian demonic beasts.

“Humph!”

Wang Xian waved his dragon claw and his body fell downwards. There was a hole the size of a human head on his chest.

The single-target attack of the gold-splitting void penetrated his body directly.

“Kill him, kill him!”

Seeing one of their comrades being killed, the other four blood savage demonic beasts roared furiously. All the blood shadows emitted the same sound, causing one to feel dizzy.

“Blood Demon Cross Kill!”

At this moment, a terrifying killing intent descended once again. The cross kill came from four different directions.

The Dark Red Cross that contained a powerful demonic aura was like the symbol of the cross of judgment. The space seemed to be filled with a vacuum.

Accompanied by the blood demon cross kill were four ferocious and terrifying figures of two meters in size. Their sharp claws emitted a thick bloody stench as they attacked.

“These blood savage demonic beasts are attacking one after another. An Ordinary level nine extraordinary expert wouldn’t be able to withstand them at all!”

Wang Xian looked at the continuous terrifying attacks with a look of astonishment on his face. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

No wonder vice commander Meng had a long wound on his chest. If he were to face ten or so transcendent level 9 blood demon beasts, he would be severely injured if he wasn’t careful.

Four blood demon cross attacks arrived at the same time with the double killing intent behind them.

Wang Xian stood there. The moment the blood demon cross attacks came, they penetrated through his body.

The four blood barbarian demonic beasts were also a little stunned. Their attacks stopped instantly.

“Die!”

The lightning strike wood in Wang Xian’s hand emitted a blue-green glow. The lightning surrounded it and drew a streak of lightning. It attacked a blood barbarian demonic beast directly.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The Blood Barbarian Demonic Beast couldn’t Dodge in time and sank into its head.

The Second Blood Barbarian Demonic Beast was dead!

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Thorns extended out from the lightning strike wood and attacked the other three blood barbarian demonic beasts.

At the same time, when Wang Xian was fighting against the five blood barbarian demonic beasts, the battle on the battlefield had erupted completely.

Ao Jian and the 11 people were directly defending against the 15 blood shadow walkers who were at transcendent level eight.

The 11 people had unified supernatural powers and unified sword moves. They were not at a disadvantage when fighting against the 15 blood shadow walkers.

Ao jian even used his supernatural powers to take them by surprise and directly killed a blood shadow walker who was at transcendent level eight.

At the location closest to the north gate, Mayor Jin Qianyuan and the President of the hiring association had already led the people of Holy Sea town to engage in an intense battle with the Blood Shadow Walkers.

However, the people of holy sea town were completely suppressed by the over 40,000 blood shadow walkers.

Although Jin Qianyuan was injured, it was still very easy for him to unleash the strength of a transcendent level 8.

The President of the hiring association was also a transcendent level 8 powerhouse.

All the transcendent level 8 Blood Shadow Walkers were held back by Ao Jian and the rest. The five blood savage beasts were also held back by Wang Xian.

When they were faced with the blood shadow walkers who were not at level eight transcendents, they did not feel much pressure.

Jin Qianyuan and the President of the mercenary association were slaughtering the beasts in all directions. They were slaughtering the beasts one by one in a frenzy.

On the city wall, the group of people were crazily launching attacks at the ground. The sky was filled with attacks, drowning the Blood Shadow Walkers one by one.

“It’s all thanks to Commander Wang. Otherwise, we would be finished!”

“Haha, this is too easy. Commander Wang and his men are defending against the top-tier siege beasts. The mayor and the others are much easier!”

“Did you see that? Commander Wang has already killed two transcendent level 9 beasts. He’s too powerful!”

On the city wall, everyone heaved a sigh of relief. With commander Wang at the north gate, they had completely defended it.

Everyone had a happy expression on their faces.

“Buzz!”

However, at this moment, everyone felt as if the entire holy sea town had been shaken.

In an instant, the noise on the entire city wall stopped. Even Jin Qianyuan and the others, who were slaughtering the blood shadow strollers below, had a slight change in expression as they hurriedly looked behind them.

“What’s the situation? Why do I feel as if the entire city has been shaken?”

A young man revealed a shocked expression. He suddenly had a bad premonition in his heart.

“It’s a formation. It’s the great city-guarding formation of Saint Sea Town. A powerful attack has landed on the formation!”

An old man exclaimed with a face full of shock.

“Buzz!”

When the old man finished speaking, the entire saint sea town trembled once again!

“Someone is attacking the formation. What’s going on? Could it be that there are city gates that aren’t guarded?”

“What’s happening at the other city gates? What’s going on?”

The array formation trembled twice in a row, causing fear to appear on everyone’s faces.

The array formation was the last line of defense of the entire holy sea town, and it was also the last desperate situation.

This meant that the city gates were lost, which meant that holy sea town had reached its most critical moment.

This made everyone feel a deep fear. Once a city gate was breached, hundreds of thousands of fierce beasts would enter the city.

This was a huge disaster for everyone.

...

“Retreat, Retreat!”

At this moment, at the East Gate, vice regiment commander Meng’s face was filled with fear as he shouted at the cavalrymen.

In front of them, there were hundreds of thousands of wandering sea demons. Behind the wandering sea demons, there were more than thirty blood barbaric demon beasts floating.

Five of the blood savage beasts stood in the center. Even if they were thousands of meters away, they could still feel the strong smell of blood on their bodies.

Five half-step void interpretation blood savage beasts, close to 30 rank nine and rank eight extraordinary blood savage beasts.

In addition to the powerful wandering sea monsters, each wandering sea monster’s strength was no less than rank three extraordinary, and there were even many rank seven, eight, and rank nine extraordinary beasts.

Disaster. This was a disaster that holy sea town couldn’t resist.

Even the riding wind battle team of the Ocean Corps fled to Holy Sea town under the Order of Vice Commander Meng.

At this moment, the riding wind battle team only had about two thousand people.

“There are too many powerful demon beasts. We can’t resist them. We can’t resist them at all!”

The students and instructors of the three academies turned pale when they saw the riding wind battle team returning to Holy Sea Town. They walked over and shouted, “What should we do? What should we do? Have the reinforcements from East Sea City arrived yet?”

“Attack! Don’t stop attacking!”

Vice Regiment Commander Meng, who had returned to the city wall, didn’t reply immediately when he heard their anxious words. Instead, he shouted loudly.

He looked at the people from the three academies and said with a gloomy face, “I haven’t received any reply yet. I will ask for reinforcements!”
