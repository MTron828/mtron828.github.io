3821 3820 special energy and the Black Resurrection Lily!

In the past, most of the places that other peak races could occupy were occupied by type 5 space beasts.

Furthermore, there were at most two or three Type 5 space beasts!

And this was the place where a Type 6 race or even a Type 7 space beast was born.

This was a world of difference!

The difference was huge!

All universes had an iron law. Only powerful treasure lands could give birth to experts. If it wasn’t for special circumstances, powerful treasure lands would be occupied by experts.

Take the fiery heart treasure land as an example. It was a treasure land.

The center was occupied by various space races.

The strongest race had an existence at the level of a ruler at level eight.

Such a powerful existence, coupled with the suppression of the starry universe, was not something that a great being from the 9-origin universe could occupy.

Another example was the storm continent, which was also occupied by a powerful pinnacle race.

Their power was also not something that the 9-origin universe could occupy!

Of course, there was also a possibility that there was a special situation. It was because the space beasts did not like this treasured land, so it was not occupied.

The possibility was too low, especially for a powerful treasured land!

Wang Xian and the rest flew forward and landed on the special material!

Stepping on this material, it was soft. It was like an incomparably huge piece of flesh.

Wang Xian reached out his hand and dug into it. However, the terrifying hardness was completely out of his expectations.

“What’s going on? I can’t even damage it?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Wang Xian’s face was filled with astonishment.

“It’s indeed very tough. Even a space beast that’s in the eighth or ninth level would find it difficult to destroy it, right?”

Lan Qingyue waved her arm and a grayish long spear pierced downwards.

However, it did not destroy it at all!

Wang Xian frowned slightly. “There seems to be the power of darkness in here. There is also a special life force. The fusion of darkness and life force?”

He placed his palm on it and tried to absorb it!

However, he could not absorb this energy!

“I can’t absorb it?”

Wang Xian was a little surprised. He moved his body and immediately floated in the air, scanning the area.

“Eh?”

At this moment, he noticed a huge pit in front of him.

This pit had a special meatball growing out of it.

This meatball was swallowed by the Interstellar Beast!

It was also because of this meatball that the interstellar beast had completely elevated to the level of a ruler at level seven.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to elevate himself by fusing with the other space beasts.

Wang Xian flew to the location of this huge pit. A dense and strange energy was surging over.

This energy was somewhat intoxicating, but it also made him alert.

He had a premonition that if he were to directly absorb this energy, it would probably be dangerous for him.

It was an energy that was filled with temptation but also contained vitality!

He waved his arm and dug out a piece of flesh from the inside.

It was like flesh and blood.

“This energy is so strange!”

Lan qingyue sized it up with a curious look on her face. “Xiao Xian, what do you think this energy is for? was the space beast swallowing a special divine herb?”

“Divine herb? It’s possible.”

When Wang Xian heard this, he raised his eyebrows slightly.

He hesitated for a moment. With a move of his palm, a wisp of ancestral tree extended out.

However, after the ancestral tree extended out, it was obvious that it was not interested in the piece of flesh in its hand.

When Wang Xian saw it, he frowned again.

Occupying this place, it couldn’t be that it was useless to the Dragon Palace, right!

Buzz

However, at this moment, a scene that surprised Wang Xian appeared.

On the branch of the ancestral tree, a flower appeared.

When Wang Xian saw this flower, his eyes lit up instantly.

“Black Resurrection Lily!”

That’s right, black resurrection Lily!

This was a treasure that Wang Xian obtained when he destroyed a race.

A dead black resurrection Lily!

Later on, due to the ancestral tree, it was resurrected proudly!

After being resurrected, the black resurrection Lily grew. Now, there were hundreds of black resurrection Lily in the Dragon Palace!

These black resurrection Lily were all used by the charming dragon clan.

The Charming Dragon clan was a very rare dragon species in the Dragon Palace.

Back then, the Dragon Palace obtained the corpse of an ancestral witch, and with this corpse, they gave birth to a charming dragon species.

Both of them were peak dragon seeds, replacing the Dolphins from before.

However, due to the limited energy of that ancestral witch’s corpse, it could only give birth to 1,000 charming dragons.

There was no doubt about the strength of the charming dragons. Coupled with the black resurrection Lily, they were very powerful.

Now that Wang Xian thought about it, that ancestral witch’s corpse must be extraordinary!

Wang Xian even suspected that the ancestral witch’s corpse, which could give birth to a peak dragon seed, must be an existence that was comparable to the 12 ancestral witches of the voodoo race.

Of course, this was just a guess!

As for the Resurrection Lily, the angel race possessed the resurrection Lily. They possessed the radiant resurrection Lily!

This was the ultimate treasure of the angel race. Very few people possessed this treasure.

Wang Xian had never seen it before, and neither had the third prince used it before.

Clearly, this treasure could only be used under special circumstances or for special powerhouses.

However, after Wang Xian obtained the black resurrection Lily, although it was resurrected, it grew very slowly.

The Black Resurrection Lily that the Dragon Palace had now was only at the peak of the venerable realm!

This might have something to do with the level of the ancestral tree.

After all, the ancestral tree had yet to recover to the level of the Heaven’s fate.

It was still unable to evolve the divine tree on its branches.

This was especially so for a special treasure like the Black Resurrection Lily.

The black resurrection Lily poked out from the ancestral tree and immediately took root on this piece of flesh.

Very soon, the flesh and blood were quickly absorbed by the Black Resurrection Lily.

The entire black resurrection Lily looked like it was emitting a beautiful black glow!

It was filled with a strange attraction!

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled. With a move of his body, he immediately arrived at the location of the deep pit.

This pit was originally the place where the unique flesh and blood plant grew.

He placed the black resurrection Lily in it.

Buzz

In an instant, the entire black resurrection Lily started to sway. It seemed to be extremely excited.

Waves of energy surged towards it.

The blood-red energy also surged into it!

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows.

“The energy in this pit has actually greatly enhanced the black resurrection Lily. Does that mean that it can also enhance the charming dragon seed?”

Wang Xian mumbled.

As the demonic dragon seed was born from the ancestral witch’s corpse, the energy in their bodies was also very strange.

Although it was said to be of the darkness attribute, there were some differences!

All in all, it was a little strange. It was very compatible with the Black Resurrection Lily!

Since the black resurrection Lily could absorb energy here, the demonic dragon seed should be able to do the same!
