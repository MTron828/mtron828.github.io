Chapter 473: I’ll Take Care of You All

“Bro, do you think he has reached Dan Realm based on the strength that he displayed just now?” asked the girl in the middle to the young man as she stared blankly at the lava pool.

“How could it be? Even though he can kill five powerful Fire Demons in a single strike, I still don’t believe he possesses the strength of Dan Realm!”

The young man shook his head. “He must have some compelling treasure with him!”

“I guess so!”

The girl nodded slowly, and knit her eyebrows. She took an ice crystal from her pocket and placed it in her mouth.

“Another relapse?” The young man rushed to her side with concern.

“I’m fine!” The girl shook her head.

“Don’t worry, sister. We’ll find the Holy Water!” said the young man said with a firm tone.

As her eyelashes arched upward, the girl revealed a beautiful smile.

“Let’s hope that the young man can come out soon!”

...

“Sure enough, it’s the Fire God’s Graveyard. There are so many treasures here.”

Wang Xian entered the pool of lava and was elated by what he saw.

The lava pool was a few hundred meters deep with sticky magma all over. Even an Inborn Expert could get melted in the hot lava.

At this time, Wang Xian gave off a fiery glow, filling up his body with Inferno Dragon energy. Entering this place was no different from entering the ocean.

Fire Demons all were crouching at the bottom, with hundreds of them densely packed together.

They surrounded the central location with a huge lotus flower.

The lotus was two meters in size, giving off a fiery-red glow even amid fire-hot lava.

However, that lotus flower was different from Flaming Lotus. It had a huge stem. To be precise, it was a tree.

Wang Xian was thrilled as he dashed to the bottom of the lava.

Grooo!

The arrival of Wang Xian awakened all the Fire Demons around him. A few hundred dark Fire Demons’ eyes were watching him.

“Since there are no Dan Realm Fire Demons, there’s no need to fear.” Wang Xian drew his lips and braved forward.

Grooo!

At that very moment, a few hundred of Fire Demons charged at him.

“Hmph, go to hell!”

Wang Xian snorted as he brought up both hands. The entire space at the bottom of the lava seemed to be plunged into silence.

“Exterminate!”

With a soft groan, hundreds of Fire Demons shattered, with the fire crystals on their foreheads flying towards him.

“Given my current strength, I’m just a level away from being God-like. Besides, my strength is close to becoming a deity after transforming into a Divine Dragon!”

Wang Xian arched his lips as he came to the gigantic Flaming Lotus.

Getting close to the lotus, Wang Xian noticed the heat given off was not that high.

[Fire God Lotus: Level 12]

“Hur? It’s not a Flaming Lotus, it’s a weapon!”

Wang Xian was taken aback upon seeing the gigantic Fire God Lotus.

The entire Fire God Lotus’ stem was seven meters long while the flower had a size of two meters.

He touched it and realized that it was a metal lotus.

“It’s a weapon, a Level 12 weapon!”

Wang Xian was a little shocked as he swung his arm and grabbed the Fire God Lotus.

Buzz!

Suddenly, a terrifying flame shrouded Wang Xian and the color of the flame switched from red to purple to black and eventually to a bloody red.

The bloody red flame turned into a lotus flower which lurched at him. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“What?”

Wang Xian had a slight change in his expression as dragon scales surfaced on his body, giving off an immense flame.

Roar!

Suddenly, furious roars came from the Fire God Lotus. Wang Xian had a slight change in his expression. It was a spirit, and a powerful one.

Om!

Wang Xian shook his arms, and they transformed into two-meter-long terrifying dragon claws while he raked them across the Fire God Lotus.

Buzz!

The Fire God Lotus jerked once before it was finally calmed down.

“Hur?”

Wang Xian stared at the Fire God Lotus while he swung his arm again. The Fire God Lotus gradually shrunk into a 1.6-meter size.

The fiery-red lotus flower was the size of a human head with twelve petals on it.

“This is? A staff?”

Wang Xian was shocked to see this as he sensed a surging and robust fire element coming from it.

There were many elemental Martial Artists in Euramerica also known as mages. These mages who specialized in remote attacks would have staffs as their weapons.

“A Level 12 staff surpasses any Inborn Spiritual Weapons!”

Wang Xian held the staff in his hand as he sensed the incredible power in it. His eyes glimmered with surprise.

With the Fire God Lotus staff in his hand, he felt cool!

Besides, the Fire God Lotus could alter its size, which was extremely amazing.

Wang Xian looked around and noticed the space under the layers of lava was much larger than that above.

“The space over here should be connected with the other routes!”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes slightly as he peered into the distance.

“Fire God Hephaestus specializes in making Fire Demons and refining equipment. Does that mean that a type of weapon is hidden under each of the nine routes? If that is the case, then...”

Wang Xian’s eyes were fired up with passion. If there were nine Level 12 weapons, that would be insane.

Let’s check it out!

With a thought, he looked to the left and swam out rapidly.

“Oh no, someone took the Fire God’s staff!”

At this time, an old man with striking red hair had a huge change in his expression as he growled in another side hall.

“What? Lord Armins, did you say someone took the Fire God’s staff? How is this possible?”

The people beside him were stunned as they exclaimed with disbelief.

“It’s true. I left some fire to keep a tab, but little did I expect someone to take away the staff of Fire God.”

That old man’s face was somber.

“But the staff is spiritual. No one can take it if they are too weak. Could it be some other compelling experts from other sects who were here?” the group of experts from Fire God Denomination asked with gloomy faces.

“I’m not sure. Let’s act fast. We need to pass through the side hall and get inside. Otherwise, it will be complicated!”

“On the other hand, send someone to investigate this. The Fire God’s staff is mighty. If someone got it, we will be able to find out.”

“I hope it’s not anyone from the other Denominations!” the group from Fire God Denomination remarked with darkened expressions.

“Nope. There’s nothing. It’s just this weapon. What a disappointment!”

Wang Xian made one round without any discovery of other weapons under the lava pool. Feeling let down, he shook his head.

Then he jumped out of the lava.

Bam!

Wang Xian leaped out from the lava before the five people.

“Hur?”

As soon as they saw Wang Xian with a staff in his hand, they were astounded.

“You guys will lead the way. With me around, there’s nothing to be afraid of!” Wang Xian commented jokingly as he was in high spirits.

The five of them took a deep look at him and the staff before they nodded.

“Bro, it’s better to be careful. This is Fire God Palace, the Graveyard of a God!”

The young man took a deep breath solemnly as he reminded Wang Xian again.

“No problem. Don’t be such a chicken. I’ll take care of you all!”

Wang Xian grinned at them.
