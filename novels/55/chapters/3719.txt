3720 3719 spirit Red Bone’s strength

“This Dragon King’s strength is not weaker than ours. He might even be stronger!”

“His level of mutation, even when he was at the peak of the Divine Dragon Race, could be ranked in the top three!”

On the spiritual demon race’s high platform, the black vulture king, lizard king, Yama King, and the other nine skeleton kings looked at Wang Xian in slight shock.

Even the black vulture king, who had some understanding of Wang Xian, was slightly shocked in his heart.

This terrifying speed was really hard for them to guard against.

Furthermore, they were all experts at the second level of the Universe Overlord realm. Naturally, they saw Wang Xian and the lizard king competing with each other in a wine cup!

Both parties transferred their energy to the wine cup. It was obvious that the Lizard King did not have any upper hand. In fact, he was at a disadvantage.

It was to the extent that he drank the wine in the wine cup!

This made them extremely shocked!

This Dragon King was not simple!

“As expected of the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. To be able to lead the Dragon Palace to this stage, he is really impressive!”

The fishy King looked at Wang Xian and could not help but exclaim in surprise. He picked up the wine cup beside him and raised it to Wang Xian!

“Hehe, compared to all the skeleton kings, I still have a long way to go!”

When Wang Xian saw the benevolent behavior of the Fishy King, he poured a glass of wine with a smile and raised it towards him!

“Hahaha, in the future, when the Divine Dragon Clan is in your hands, it is really possible for them to return to their peak.”

King Yama and the rest also smiled as they picked up their wine glasses!

They were closer to the black vulture king, but they did not put Wang Xian in their eyes just now.

Just a nod was enough for them!

However, now that Wang Xian had displayed his strength that was on par with them, they agreed with his strength.

That was why he was so polite!

Wang Xian smiled at them.

“I really didn’t expect that the Dragon King’s strength was inferior to mine 2,000 years ago. Now, he has improved to such a terrifying level!”

The spirit demon king sighed softly at the side.

“He’s just relying on his powerful bloodline.”

Wang Xian replied humbly!

The speed of his improvement was indeed a little terrifying, even among the peak races.

However, everything made sense. After all, the disciples of the peak races did not have the shackles of a realm when they were below the level of a ruler. Hence, their breakthrough was faster!

“In the future, it will really be your young people’s World!”

The black vulture king looked at Wang Xian and smiled. Then, he instructed the spirit demon king beside him!

The spirit demon king nodded his head. Then, his body moved and he flew towards a building behind him!

“My granddaughter will be out soon.”

The black vulture king looked at a building in front of him and spoke to the skeleton kings beside him!

Since the Lizard King was suppressed by Wang Xian, he kept a low profile at this moment. He sat there in silence!

At this moment, a red-robed spirit-red bone with blood-red flames on it flew out from the building in front of them!

It was dressed in red and had long flowing hair. There was a symbol of flames on its forehead!

His pure white arm made him look completely unlike a disciple of the skeleton clan!

However, the energy contained within his body was terrifying! Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

When Wang Xian saw the spirit red bone coming out, his eyes sparkled as he sized it up.

The Spirit Red Bone, which had inherited the Scarlet Queen’s inheritance, became stronger and more goddess-like after breaking through.

It gave people a feeling of being above the nine heavens.

“Eh? Black Vulture King, is this your granddaughter who just broke through? The energy in her body is not simple.”

The Bloody Tan King looked at the spirit red bone and turned his eyes to the black vulture king as he asked.

The other seven skeleton kings also looked at the black vulture king in shock.

“Haha, my granddaughter has obtained a powerful inheritance. Whether it is her potential in the future or her fighting strength of the same level, it is not something that we can compare to!”

The black vulture king said proudly!

“No wonder your granddaughter broke through, black vulture king. You must be really lucky to have such a large army!”

A Skeleton King’s eyes flickered as he said with a hint of envy.

They could naturally see that the spirit red bone’s body was unusual at a glance.

They could even feel that the spirit red bone that had just broken through posed some threat to them.

This was undoubtedly very terrifying!

It was comparable to the mutated existence of their skeleton race.

“Greetings, Grandpa, greetings, Skeleton Kings!”

Spirit red bones flew over and raised his head to look at the black vulture king and the rest. He cupped his hands and smiled when he saw Wang Xian.

Wang Xian smiled and nodded at him.

“Haha, Good, Good!”

When the black vulture king saw Ling Honggu, he stood up with a smile on his face. “Three-talons, mingtuo, the dozen of you will go over!”

“It’s the Black Vulture King!”

Below them, more than a dozen skeleton kings who were in the Dominator level one flew to the back of Ling Honggu and lowered their heads slightly!

“Not long ago, my granddaughter Ling Honggu made a breakthrough. I am very happy. During this ceremony, I will officially announce something. Other than me, the black vulture king’s lineage will respect Hong Gu.”

“In addition, three claws, Ming Tuo, the dozen of you, I will tell you clearly that in the future, Red Bone’s potential will be much stronger than mine. The path in the future will be much more than mine. Among you, you can choose to submit to red bone now and make her your King!”

Black Vulture King stood there and said loudly!

His words caused the skeleton kings to be slightly shocked.

Transferring his subordinates to the spirit red bones was something that the skeleton race wouldn’t do unless they were close relatives.

Of course, it wasn’t that easy to transfer his subordinates to his close relatives.

This required him to have the strength to make them submit!

“Three of you come out first and spar with the Red Bones. Don’t worry, don’t Worry!”

Black Vulture King ordered directly!

Black Vulture King’s skeleton king subordinates looked at each other. They clearly knew something about this matter!

They also knew that their king valued red bones very much!

“The three of us will challenge Princess Red Bones!”

Three Skeleton Kings walked out, bowed to red bones, and said!

“Alright!”

Ling Honggu looked over and nodded. His body moved and he immediately flew up into the sky!

“Your Highness, we have offended you!”

The three skeleton kings moved and immediately floated around Ling Honggu!

“Make your move. You Can’t break through my defense!”

Ling Honggu looked at them and waved his arm. The Red Dress on his body changed into a blood red color and swayed around him.

“Eternal withered!”

“Skeleton, corrode!”

“Ghost Valley, Kill!”

The three skeleton kings felt the powerful pressure coming from Ling Honggu’s body. They did not hold back and launched their strongest attack!

Countless withered bone spears, terrifying skeleton heads, and the gloomy and terrifying Ghost Valley Mountain attacked Ling Honggu directly!

“Blood Sea, Devour!”

Ling Honggu looked over and waved her arm. The blood-red dress around her went straight for it. In the air, the blood-red dress turned into a sea of blood, instantly melting the attacks of the three skeleton kings!

She waved her blood-red dress all over the sky and attacked in an instant!
