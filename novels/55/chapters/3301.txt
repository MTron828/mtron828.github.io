3302 So what if we take 3101 away?

Boom! Boom! Boom

In front of the God kingdoms of the Righteous God race, the powerful figures of the liches flew over one by one.

Their bodies emitted a sharp and terrifying aura as they charged at Wang Xian without any restraint.

They flew to the left and right of the lich king and sized up Wang Xian with cold eyes.

Wang Xian looked at the experts who were flying over and his expression changed slightly. It was a little ugly.

“Haha, You Want Us To get the hell out of here? This must be the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.”

The Lich King stared at Wang Xian. His face was filled with coldness and disdain. “However, Your Dragon Palace doesn’t seem to have the qualifications to allow us to leave.”

“The Lich clan of the Lich Kingdom?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian swept his gaze across them. His expression was a little ugly as he asked coldly.

At the edge of the heaven opening primal continent, the liches were from the Lich Kingdom.

This was a very powerful race. Their strength was not something that ordinary powers could compare to.

They belonged to the wizard lineage and possessed strange witchcraft and strange offensive techniques.

Ordinary powers would not dare to provoke them.

In front of them were eleven universe knights with level eight combat strength.

With so many experts, even with Wang Xian’s strength, he was not their match.

At the moment, Wang Xian could fight and even kill two to three experts of the same level.

The five elements millstone in his hand could kill one of the same level.

However, there were too many universe knights with level eight combat strength.

It was not something the current Dragon Palace could fight against.

“Hehehe, that’s right, the treasures here belong to the Lich Kingdom now. Anyone who dares to fight with us is an enemy of the Lich Kingdom. The moment you step into our array domain, it will be seen as a provocation. Don’t blame us for not being polite.”

A lich beside the lich king said coldly.

Although they could not attack the factions and experts surrounding Lu Xing Kong, they could kill them if the other party attacked first.

“The Lich Kingdom, the Lich clan!”

“Hahaha, are you threatening us? How dare you, a mere dragon palace, Threaten Our Lich Kingdom?”

When the Lich King heard his words, his eyes revealed a sinister expression, “Today, this king will take away all the Cosmos God kingdoms. I want to see how your Dragon Palace will become our enemy, Haha!”

“Do you really think that you are invincible in the surrounding starry sky? Do you think that our Lich Kingdom is afraid of You? Hahaha, you do not have the qualifications!”

As he spoke, his eyes were filled with killing intent and disdain as well!

“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, don’t be arrogant here. Attack us if you have the guts!”

A lich next to the lich king said coldly, “If it weren’t for the rules of the heaven opening desolate continent, I would have taught you a lesson just because of what you said just now!”

“Scram! Without the rules, Your Dragon Palace is nothing in front of Our Lich Kingdom!”

“Boom Boom Boom!”

As soon as he finished his sentence, a violent aura surged toward Wang Xian.

The other experts from the Lich Kingdom also charged forward.

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly when he felt this terrifying aura.

He stared coldly at the experts from the Lich Kingdom.

“Put away all the Cosmos God kingdoms. Whoever dares to snatch them from US will die today!”

The Lich King roared with a grim expression.

“Yes!”

Above the God kingdoms of the Righteous God race, some of the liches who were collecting the god kingdoms immediately replied.

“Hehe!”

After the Lich King finished speaking, he stared at Wang Xian with a grim expression and raised his head slightly.

“This… This Lich Kingdom didn’t give Dragon Palace Dragon King any face at all!”

“Face?”? “This is the god Kingdom of more than 10,000 universe knights. It’s the treasure of the entire righteous God race. Even for the Lich clan, it’s a huge amount of resources. How could they give up? Even if it’s to make enemies with the Dragon Palace, it’s nothing!”

“That’s right, the Lich Kingdom is much stronger than the Dragon Palace. So what if we don’t give Dragon King Face!”

“Let alone the Lich Kingdom, even if we are facing so many divine kingdoms, we would still make the same choice.”

At the back, the more than ten middle-aged elders couldn’t help but discuss in low voices when they saw the scene in front of them.

Wang Xian floated quietly in the air and watched the powerhouses of the Lich Kingdom collecting the divine kingdoms in front of him.

At the front, the huge demonic dragon head of the Lich King was also staring at Wang Xian. His eyes were filled with coldness and disdain.

As the god kingdoms were kept, Wang Xian could only stand there and watch.

The strength of the other party was not something he could contend against.

The strength of the Lich Kingdom was also not something the Dragon Palace could deal with.

“Lich Kingdom, you will regret what happened today!”

Wang Xian stared at the lich king and said calmly.

“Hahaha, cut the crap. Your Dragon Palace is not worthy of making us regret!”

The Lich King said disdainfully.

“Dragon King, these God kingdoms can allow the devouring dragon clan to receive a huge boost. This bunch of damnable fellows. Seems like after Ao crab has absorbed the universe God kingdoms, it’s time for him to bring his subordinates to the lich kingdom for a trip!”

Heaven array stood behind Wang Xian and said with a gloomy face.

They never expected that their spoils of war, the treasures of the Righteous God race, would actually be taken away by the powerful factions in the heaven opening primal continent.

“There’s no need to wait for Ao crab and the others to break through. I’ll go over. Although I can’t kill the strong ones, it won’t be a big problem for me to destroy all the universe knights below level seven in the Lich Kingdom!”

An Lie said darkly.

With his ability, entering the lich kingdom would cause the entire lich kingdom to pay a heavy price.

“Indeed, there’s no need to wait!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and said with a sinister expression, “I’ll make them spit them all out!”

“Let’s Go!”

As he said that, he did not stay here any longer. He turned around and flew back.

“Hehe, Trash!”

At the front, the Lich King saw Wang Xian leaving. His face was filled with mockery and disdain.

“HMM? Then the Dragon King and the rest have left!”

“What can we do if they don’t leave? The Dragon Palace is no match for the Lich Kingdom. Tsk Tsk, the Dragon Palace has suffered a great loss this time!”

“Hehe, the forces surrounding Lu Xingkong don’t dare to touch their treasures, but we, the forces that split open the heaven and desolation continent, Do!”

At the back, the dozen or so people shook their heads with a smile when they saw Wang Xian and the others leaving.

Boom

However, at this moment, they suddenly sensed an energy fluctuation at the side. The figure of the Dragon King appeared in front of them at a terrifying speed.

This made their faces change.
