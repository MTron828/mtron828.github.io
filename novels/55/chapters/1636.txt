Chapter 1637: The 1637 Sky Demon was still divided into half

“Welcome, Sky Demon!”

Looking at Wang Xian’s figure, the He Sui clan and the He clan looked at each other.

They could see the excitement in each other’s eyes.

The higher-ups of the two clans pursed their lips and immediately shouted at Wang Xian.

“Just Call Me Wang Xian. Speaking of which, the name Sky Demon was given by your he clan!”

When Wang Xian heard the respectful voices of the He clan’s higher-ups, he smiled and shook his head.

“Phoenix Emperor, the goddess of the wilderness, brother Wang Xian, please come in, please come in!”

The He clan and he Sui clan’s higher-ups were all beaming as they hurriedly invited him in.

Wang Xian nodded and looked at Feng Luan and the rest.

“Clan leader he, clan leader he sui, everyone, it’s our dragon and Phoenix Empire that has dragged you down recently.”

“However, from now on, you don’t have to be so worried anymore!”

“I’ll have to trouble the He clan to mobilize your information department. Next, it’s time for our dragon and Phoenix Empire to retaliate!”

Feng Luan said to the He clan’s he Sui clan’s upper echelons with a smile.

“Retaliate?”

Everyone from the two clans was slightly stunned. Following that, a hint of fervor and excitement flashed across their eyes.

“Brother Wang Xian, the three superpowers led over 100,000 experts to attack the flowing sea region. Could it be that you managed to hold them off?”

At this moment, he yuan, who was at the side, asked Wang Xian excitedly.

“We killed 60,000 experts and left an old ancestor of the Wuji Empire behind. Now that we are back, it is time for us to fight the three superpowers.”

“Very soon, we will each take a place in the entire vast region!”

Wang Xian smiled and said to he yuan.

“Killing an old man and 60,000 experts? Brother Wang Xian, your strength? and haven’t you already?”

He Yuan asked again with a face full of curiosity.

“With my current strength, it shouldn’t be a problem for me to fight against a few people at level nine of the Seethrough realm. I didn’t Die Last Time!”

Wang Xian smiled and said to he yuan.

When the higher-ups of the He clan and he Sui clan heard Wang Xian’s words, they revealed an excited expression.

Wang Xian and the rest had actually defeated the three super forces and a group of experts. It was simply terrifying.

In the future, the vast region would no longer belong to the three super forces.

Instead, it would belong to the Dragon and Phoenix Empire.

“Brother Wang Xian, Emperor Phoenix, we will mobilize all our forces immediately. If you need any information, let us know!”

At the side, the He clan leader said excitedly.

“All the news about the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop. We have already paid attention to the news about the three superpowers!”

Wang Xian said directly.

“Little Xian, what are you trying to do?”

Feng Luan asked when she heard Wang Xian’s words.

“Naturally, we have to get rid of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop. They have been finding trouble with us time and time again. They really think we are easy to bully!”

“In addition, the Wuji Empire has to teach them a good lesson and destroy a few of their cities!”

Wang Xian said directly.

The He clan and he Sui clan, who were at the side, were a little fearful when they heard that.

They had casually gotten rid of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop. They had also casually destroyed a few cities of the Wuji Empire.

In the vast region, only the sky demon could say such words.

“Alright!”

Feng Luan nodded her head in agreement. “It’s time to teach the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop a good lesson!”

“Brother Wang Xian, Emperor Feng, the backers of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop are...”

After hesitating for a moment, the He Sui clan’s clan leader said softly.

“Don’t worry, we are very clear about their backers.”

Feng Luan shook her head.

“Rest for the night. We will make a move tomorrow!”

Wang Xian decided.

Everyone from the He tribe and he sui tribe nodded with excitement.

At the same time, the He tribe and he sui tribe members around the holy tree saw the dragon and Phoenix Empire’s soldiers descending again.

The experts from the two tribes who had fought together with the dragon and Phoenix Empire’s soldiers immediately asked for some information out of curiosity.

When they learned that the dragon-phoenix Empire and Sky Demon had directly defeated the army of the vast region and launched a counterattack, excitement appeared on their faces.

The dragon-phoenix Empire and Sky Demon had defeated the three superpowers, and now, they had launched a counterattack.

In the future, the vast region would completely change.

The He clan and he Sui clan were the two races that the dragon-phoenix Empire was closest to. In the future, their clans would definitely rise.

In the future, there was no need for them to hide around the He clan’s sacred tree. They would have a wider territory.

At the same time, when the army from the vast region arrived at the divine kingdom ruins.

“Reporting, according to the urgent news, the dragon-phoenix Empire’s experts have entered the He clan’s Land!”

A message was transmitted to everyone’s ears.

Everyone from Skyfiend and the dragon-phoenix Empire had arrived.

Everyone knew clearly what they were doing here. They were attacking their vast territory.

“Everyone from the southern royal family, follow me back!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Upon hearing this news, southern Emperor Jianghe and another patriarch shouted with a gloomy expression.

“It’s the Patriarch!”

A group of southern royal family disciples hurriedly replied.

“If Skyfiend really goes to your southern royal family, can you withstand him?”

Patriarch dark eye looked at everyone in the southern royal family with an extremely unsightly expression as he said in a deep voice.

The faces of the two southern royal family’s patriarchs instantly stiffened.

How could they withstand the arrival of skyfiend?

Just Empress Dragon Phoenix and the wilderness goddess were enough to make their southern royal family suffer, not to mention the even more terrifying skyfiend.

“Then what do you guys think we should do?”

Southern Emperor Jianghe’s expression changed as he asked in a deep voice.

“At this time, once we separate, we’ll just have to wait for each of us to break through!”

The supreme headmaster stood there with an embarrassed expression.

He didn’t dare to leave. With the enmity between the Solitaire sect and the skyfiend, with the current strength of his solitaire sect, they could be easily destroyed..

“Then what do we do now? If the dragon-phoenix Empire and the sky demon head to the nest of our southern royal family, our tens of thousands of years of foundation will be destroyed!”

Southern Royal River roared in a low voice.

This was related to the rise and fall of their southern Royal Family!

“Now, the first thing we need to do is to join forces. We can not be separated. Once we do, we will be destroyed one by one!”

“Second, we need to sign an agreement with the Dragon and Phoenix Empire. Although we are not their match, they will not be able to destroy us!”

“If we really fight, it will not benefit anyone.”

Wuji King walked out and said in a deep voice.

“Even if we sign an agreement, the Dragon and Phoenix Empire will have to agree!”

The two ancestors of the southern royal family said in a deep voice.

“The Dragon and Phoenix Empire is an empire. What they want is a domain and resources. They will not fight to the death!”

Wuji Nation Master analyzed.

“I hope it’s as you said. Now, should we send people to negotiate peace with the Dragon and Phoenix Empire?”

Southern Emperor Jianghe said with a bad expression.

“It’s to negotiate peace, not peace!”

Dark eye patriarch sighed slightly.

Right now, they didn’t have the right to negotiate peace. They could only beg the other party to stop attacking!
