Boom! Boom! Boom

The fragment of the Starfield was flying forward, struggling to break free from the intercepting energy.

Lan Qingyue and Xiao Lan had no idea what to do with this fragment of the Starfield.

Moreover, the speed of the fragment of the Starfield was getting faster and faster.

It wouldn’t be long before it would widen the distance between them.

Wang Xian felt helpless when he saw this scene. He was afraid that he wouldn ‘t be able to get his hands on this fragment of the Starfield.

Lan qingyue, who was at the side, also shook her head helplessly.

This might require an even stronger force to be able to stop it.

“Forget it! ”

Wang Xian shook his head and said to Lan Qingyue.

“Roar Roar Roar! ”

However, as soon as he finished his sentence, an extremely terrifying energy shrouded over this area.

This terrifying and vast energy caused the expressions of Wang Xian and Lan Qingyue to change drastically.

This extremely vast energy gave people an unusually overbearing and invincible feeling.

Although this energy wasn’t directed at Wang Xian and Lan Qingyue, at this moment, they felt as though they were in a terrifying ocean.

They were like a small ship in the ocean.

As long as a gust of wind and waves came over, they would be crushed.

“Not good, Xiao Xian. There’s an extremely terrifying existence flying towards us.”

Lan Qingyue looked towards the depths of the boundless starry sky and said to Wang Xian with a face full of shock. “Yes, let’s go. We have to stay far away from here! ”

Wang Xian replied immediately.

Xiao Lan and the rest did not need to give orders. They immediately flew in the opposite direction.

Crash

However, at this moment, an explosion came from the front.

In the next second, Wang Xian, Lan Qingyue, and the rest saw a figure appearing out of thin air in front of them.

He appeared in front of the fragment of the Starfield.

His enormous body covered the entire starry sky. He had an oval-shaped body that was similar to Xiao Lan and the rest.

The difference was that there were two enormous whiskers in front of him.

There was also a glowing ball on the whiskers.

The entire Space Beast had an invincible and vast aura of a king.

When Wang Xian saw the space beast appear out of thin air, his pupils constricted slightly.

“Master, Dragon King, it’s the Chaotic Space Beast, the powerful Wonton.”

At this moment, Xiao Lan’s voice was suddenly heard.

“Chaotic?”

Wang Xian and the rest were slightly surprised.

Chaos, a chaotic space beast.

A top-tier space beast that lived in the nine-origin universe.

At that time, the passageway between the nine-origin universe and the starry universe was opened by him and a few other top-tier space beasts.

It was an absolute overlord-tier space beast in the nine-origin universe.

It was an absolute overlord-tier existence.

Tens of millions of years had passed. By now, it should have eliminated the suppression of the starry universe.

In other words, his current strength was extremely terrifying.

Under the astonished gazes of Wang Xian and the rest, the two glowing spheres above his head shone with a ray of light.

The Ray of light enveloped the fragment of the starry universe. “What is he doing? He wants to obtain the fragment of the starry universe. ” When Wang Xian and the rest saw it, they were astonished.

A galactic behemoth that was at the top of the nine-origin universe and a galactic behemoth that was exceptionally powerful in the universe actually came here.

Furthermore, he was attacking the galactic fragment.

“His target is the galactic fragment. A treasure of this level is enough to attract a galactic behemoth of this level. ” Lan qingyue mumbled.

“Let’s go. Let’s leave this place.”

Wang Xian only took a glance and immediately gave an order to Xiao Lan.

An existence of this level was not someone they could afford to provoke.

Without the suppression of the starry universe, an existence at the pinnacle of dominance could easily kill them.

They were not on the same level at all.

After all, Xiao Lan and Lan Qingyue were merely at the seventh level of dominance.

The gap between them was too huge!

Such existences were the best in the starry universe.

Especially when they were more intelligent than the local space beasts!

Xiao Lan did not hesitate and escaped immediately!

However, the moment Wang Xian and the rest escaped, the space beast suddenly looked over!

He did not do anything. He looked at the fragment of the Starfield with a glint in his eyes.

The starfield fragment was completely restrained by his energy.

The powerful force of the Starfield fragment couldn’t escape at all.

It even flew towards Hun Dun.

“A fragment at the heaven origin creation level. This is a good treasure. ”

He mumbled. Without any movement, he suddenly turned towards the spot where Wang Xian and the rest had disappeared.

“It seems to be the Dragon Kinz of the Dragon Palace. He has great potential! ” Hun Dun mumbled.

Although he was a space beast, he was different from the space beasts in the starry universe.

His intelligence was the same as the living beings in the nine-origin universe.

Even when they were in the nine-origin universe, the top-tier Space Beasts used the universe’s Al.

He knew about the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.

The main reason was that the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace was too famous.

He even knew some of his deeds in the universe!

A hint of contemplation appeared on his face before he disappeared in the next instant.

“He shouldn’t have chased after us. I wonder if he managed to get his hands on the galactic fragment. ”

Xiao Lan flew forward quickly. Lan qingyue glanced at the back and spoke.

“We should be able to get it! ”

Wang Xian guessed.

They were already able to block the fragment of the Starfield.

With the strength of an expert at the peak of the Dominator realm, it was sufficient to block the fragment of the Starfield. “Master, that Lord is here.”

At this moment, Xiao Lan suddenly spoke.

Lan Qingyue’s gaze froze. Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly as well.

“The other party doesn’t seem to have any ill intentions. ” However, Wang Xian spoke very quickly.

In front of them, the figure of Hun Dun slowly appeared.

His aura was not that terrifying. He was floating in the void in front of them as he sized up Wang Xian and the rest.

“Greetings, senior Hun Dun. May I know what your orders are?” Upon seeing this, Wang Xian immediately bowed and cupped his hands.

“Greetings, Senior Hundun.”

Lan Qingyue and Xiao Lan also greeted him. “Hehe, Hello, Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.”

Hundun smiled and replied to Wang Xian.

Upon hearing his words, Wang Xian heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

If such an existence wanted to kill him, it would be too easy.

“May I know what is the matter, Senior Hundun? If Our Dragon Palace can do it, we will definitely not decline. ”

Wang Xian spoke again.

(‘I heard that there is a treasure in the Dragon Palace. We would like to make a trade with you, Dragon King.”

Hundun’s words caused Wang Xian to reveal a stunned expression.

Trade?

A peak-level ruler, a top-notch existence among the space beasts of the nine-origin universe, wanted to make a trade with the Dragon Palace?

(‘I wonder what Senior Hundun wishes to make a trade with. Compared to our Dragon Palace, I believe that other peak-level races have more treasures to trade with you, right?”

Wang Xian said with some doubts in his heart!
