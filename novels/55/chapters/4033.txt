“He has been resurrected in our dragon Roar Forbidden Ground. ” Long Yinyin’s eyes were slightly red as she spoke to Wang Xian!

“Let’s go. It’s good that he can be resurrected. Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian nodded and spoke to her!

“MMM”‘

Long yinyin nodded her head. her face was filled with worry. “Although Yinhao can be resurrected, he has already cultivated to this realm. Even if he has sufficient resources in the future, it will take hundreds of millions of years for him to recover to the level seven realm of the Universe Overlord! ”

“This will also have a huge impact on his future! ”

“Don’t worry, don’t Worry! ”

Wang Xian comforted her and looked at her. “Yinyin, do you know how Yinhao died?

“Father didn’t tell me. He said that he would tell me after I returned.”

Long Yinyin replied!

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered when he heard that.

It seemed that long Yinhao’s death was not simple!

If he were to die at the hands of the demonic beasts, Long Yinyin’s father would have nothing to hide.

Wang Xian brought long yinyin and flew quickly to the location of the teleportation formation to carry out the teleportation!

Tianyuan city was still very far from the Dragon Roar Forbidden Ground!

It took them more than ten days to reach the Dragon Roar Forbidden Ground!FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

They immediately flew towards the Sky Peak!

“Father! ”

Before they reached the entrance, long yinyin shouted loudly! “Yinyin, Little Xian is here too. Come over!”

Long Yinyin’s father’s voice could be heard from inside.

Wang Xian and the rest entered and realized that many people were already seated.

They were all experts from the Dragon Roar Forbidden Ground.

This included long Yinyin’s ancestor, the founder of the Dragon Roar Forbidden Ground!

“Father, grandfather, forefather, what’s the current situation of Yinhao?” Long Yinyin hurriedly asked!

“There’s nothing wrong with Yinhao. It’s just that all of his cultivation has disappeared and he needs to cultivate again. ”

Long Yinyin’s father sighed and replied!

“Uncle, how did Yinhao Die?”

Wang Xian stood at the side and asked directly.

His words caused long yinyin’s father’s expression to change slightly.

Around them, the expression of the forefathers of the dragon roar forbidden ground gradually turned ugly.

“According to Yin Hao, he was killed by a sneak attack. He didn’t see the person who attacked him. However, before his life force dissipated, he saw a few faces. There was the current saint son of the flowing water forbidden ground, an expert who was in the eighth stage of the ruler realm of the flowing

water forbidden ground, the saint son of Xu Ni from the space forbidden ground, and a few experts from the space forbidden ground. ”

“The one who attacked him should be an expert from the forbidden space, because before he died, he sensed the fluctuation of the space attribute! ”

Long Yinyin’s grandfather, second elder, said slowly. In the end, he sighed helplessly!

“This… “Why did they kill Yinhao? Yinhao didn’t offend them. How could they do this? Grandfather, didn’t the experts from the undeserved forbidden ground forbid any disciples from fighting? “They killed yinhao. We want to sue them and tell the experts from the undeserved forbidden land and the flowing water forbidden land! ”

Upon hearing this, Long Yin Yin’s face revealed an angry expression as he said loudly!

“We can sue, but without evidence, how could they believe it? Especially, among them are the holy sons from the flowing water forbidden land, the holy sons from the Space Forbidden Land, and the experts from the space forbidden land. ”

“Flowing water forbidden ground, space forbidden ground. If we have no evidence and they give us a false accusation, our dragon roar forbidden ground won’t be able to bear it. There’s a possibility that… Sigh! ”

The second elder shook his head and said weakly.

Their dragon roar forbidden ground had been glorious for the past few hundred million years.

There were the powerful Wang Xian holy sons and two holy sons and Saintesses with unparalleled potential!

However, the experts of the dragon roar forbidden ground knew the real situation clearly.

Saint Wang Xian was an outsider after all. His identity was so mysterious that even they didn’t know a thing or two about the dragon roar forbidden ground.

Therefore, they still relied on dragon roar yin and Dragon Roar Hao.

Fortunately, Dragon Roar Yin and Dragon Roar Hao were also very capable.

Especially Dragon Roar Hao. At such a young age, he had already reached the seventh level of the Universe Overlord realm. He could expect to reach the peak of the Overlord realm in the future.

But now, he had suddenly fallen midway.

Their dragon roar forbidden ground was more unbearable than anyone else!

Flowing Water Forbidden Ground, space forbidden ground!

In the absence of evidence, even if long Yinhao saw them before he died, what could he do?

They didn’t dare to say anything!

This was the sorrow of a weak faction!

“The holy son of the space forbidden ground and their experts, the holy son of the flowing water forbidden ground and their experts. ”

When Wang Xian heard their words, his eyes flickered slightly.

The holy son of the flowing water forbidden ground, Wang Xian, knew that he didn’t get his hands on the corpse of the water-attributed strong practitioner in the demon pillar back then in the ruins of the universe.

At that time, his eyes were filled with anger, unwillingness, and jealousy. Wang Xian could sense it.

However, he didn’t pay much attention to it back then.

Was he taking revenge on Long Yinhao Now?

It might be more than that!

Wang Xian thought of Saintess Liuyue. Among them, Saintess Liuyue might also be involved!

“Grandpa, can we go and see Yinhao Now?”

Long yinyin bit her lips and said to the second elder and the rest!

“He’s inside!”

The second elder pointed to the position inside and said.

Long yinyin nodded and walked straight inside.

Wang Xian immediately followed by the side!

The two of them entered the spot inside.

Long Yinhao was sitting cross-legged in the deepest part of the pond.

However, he was extremely weak at this moment! He hadn’t even reached the realm of celestial thearch!

“Brother! ”

Long Yinyin looked at his brother and sensed his aura. His expression changed and he shouted!

“Sister, brother Wang Xian, you guys are here! ”

Long Yinhao opened his eyes. When he saw Wang Xian and long yinyin, he smiled and shouted!

“Are… Are You Alright?”

Long yinyin looked at him with a pained expression and opened her mouth.

“Sister, what could have happened to me? I just died once. Didn’t I just resurrect? However, I’m afraid that it will take some time for me to recover to my peak! ”

Long Yinhao squeezed out a smile and said!

Long Yinyin looked at his smile and didn’t know what to say for a moment!

“It’s alright. Just focus on your cultivation. I will take revenge! ”

Wang Xian said to long Yinhao indifferently!

“Big Brother Wang Xian, if you can cultivate to the Tianyuan blessed realm, no, as long as you can cultivate to the peak of the Universe Dominator, with your powerful strength, you will be invincible below the Tianyuan blessed realm. At that time, you will be able to help me vent my anger. hahaha, I will have to rely on you in the future! ”

Upon hearing Wang Xian ‘s words, long Yinhao immediately laughed out loud!

His mentality was pretty good.

Although 400 million years had passed, he had not changed much!

“Alright, very soon! ”

Upon hearing his words, Wang Xian also smiled.

Very soon, there was still more than a month before his original body arrived!
