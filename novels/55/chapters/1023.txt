Chapter 1024: The 1025 Dragon Spike had arrived

Translator: 5496903

He had killed the young master’s mercenary group and offended a few powerful families.

These families all wanted to destroy him.

Since that was the case, Ao Yao and the others would make the first move.

By destroying these families, they would be able to obtain a lot of resources and spirit stones.

The resources they would obtain from this group would increase strange demon and the others’strength, and then they would go and finish off the Yun family.

Moreover, this way, no one would suspect him.

When that time came, East Sea city would already be shrouded in darkness, and no one would know that he was the one who made the move.

“Currently, I have more than 100 million middle-grade spirit stones in my hands, but I still need a lot more!”

He had obtained more than 103 million spirit stones from the windwing rampant fish territory, and a portion of them had been obtained from snake mark and a few transcendent seventh rank experts.

It was not enough to upgrade a strange demon to level eight extraordinaire with more than 100 million spirit stones.

Wang Xian did not use the spirit stones to purchase the spirit stones either.

Soon, a day passed slowly.

Wang Xian walked into the courtyard and watched the moon rise high into the sky. Dawn had arrived.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian walked into the courtyard. He would be setting off together for this operation.

However, he would not enter the snake family. Instead, he would wait outside. He needed to do one thing.

The snake family was also located in the Eastern District, behind the Demon Hunter College.

A few kilometers behind the demon Hunter College, there was a mountain peak. There, there were a few powerful families living in the eastern district. The snake family was one of them.

At dawn, there were fewer people on both sides of the road.

Especially in this area. At dawn, no one was staying here anymore.

When Wang Xian arrived at the foot of the mountain, he saw a row of chairs beside him. He walked over with a smile and landed there.

Bored, he took out his communication stone plate and checked some information.

Ao Yaoyao and the rest had disappeared.

The target was the snake family!

Wang Xian leaned on the chair and looked at the information about the Demon Hunter College as well as the information about the eastern sea city.

There was also a forum in Donghai City. There were various rankings, the ranking of the strong, the ranking of the mercenary groups, and so on.

There were all sorts of juicy news.

Among them, the most discussed topic was about the auction in ten days.

This time, the three big shops were promoting the auction very much. Just by revealing the items that were being auctioned, it was already a level nine extraordinary.

It was definitely a grand banquet for the auction.

“Dragon King!”

Just as Wang Xian was flipping through all sorts of information, Ao Yao’s figure appeared.

Beside him, there was a middle-aged man floating by the side.

The middle-aged man was completely unconscious.

“He’s an expert of level eight transcendence from the snake family. He should know where the snake family’s treasure is!”

Ao Yao scanned the surroundings warily and said.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded. “Control him!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Wang Xian stared at the middle-aged man’s body. The moment he released soul capture, the middle-aged man became clear in an instant.

However, Ao Yao’s arm was directly inserted into his body.

“Soul capture!”

Soon, Wang Xian’s face turned pale. Ao Yao immediately kept the corpse into his interspatial ring.

He closed his eyes and leaned against the chair, searching for information one by one.

“I’ll send the information to your mind!”

Very soon, Wang Xian heaved a sigh of relief and said to Ao Yao.

“Yes!”

Ao Yao nodded.

Wang Xian sat there and sorted out the memories in his mind.

There were too many memories of a person. If he accepted all of them, it could even drive him crazy.

“However, there are quite a lot of spirit stones in the snake family’s treasure house!”

Wang Xian smiled.

800 million middle-grade spirit stones. This was what Wang Xian obtained from the memories of that expert.

Other than 800 million middle-grade spirit stones, there were other treasures.

For example, materials, formations, elixirs, spiritual herbs, and so on!

There was even a medicinal garden in the snake family!

Since I’m no longer helping Feng Xian, I can forge my own weapons and refine elixirs

Wang Xian thought to himself. If he didn’t help Feng Xian’s shop, he could obtain more benefits.

I have to sell the bloodline in my hands as soon as possible

Wang Xian thought to himself and hesitated on how to sell this bloodline.

In the past, he had thought of auctioning off the bloodline through Feng Xian. Now, it seemed like he had to think of another way.

“How about...”

Suddenly, a light flashed in Wang Xian’s mind. He pondered for a moment and felt that it was really feasible.

“If I do this, I would be going against Phoenix!”

Wang Xian smiled and shook his head.

“Dragon King, take care of everything!”

“Alright, let’s Go!”

Ao Yaoyao’s voice rang out. Wang Xian stood up and walked towards his residence.

The dozen Odd Yaoyao did not follow him. Instead, they were announcing something to the East Sea city.

The Dragon’s Thorn was here!

The future king of assassins of the East Sea city was here!

Wang Xian returned to his residence. He took a look at the items in his interspatial ring and laid down on his bed to rest.

There was nothing faster than killing and robbing people to get money!

“AH, master and the rest have been killed!”

In the early morning, screams came from the snake family.

This scream seemed to indicate something.

Not far from the snake family was a song family, a merchant family. The strength of the Chamber of Commerce could be ranked in the top ten in Donghai City.

“Father, look. This morning, we placed a red piece of paper in our hall. Last night, the array formation didn’t have the slightest fluctuation. It was silent. The word ‘Dragon Spike’was written on it, and there was also a contact information for the communication stone plate!”

A middle-aged man held a red piece of paper in his hand as he spoke to an old man with a grave expression.

To be able to hide from their family’s array formation and quietly place an item here, if they were here to assassinate them...

They didn’t dare to imagine it!

“Dragon Spike?”

The old man took the red piece of paper, and a surprised expression appeared on his face.

“Dragon Spike? Master, this... This says ‘Dragon Spike’?”

At this moment, an old official at the side was suddenly stunned and hurriedly asked.

“Oh? Old Hong, do you know this thing?”

The old man asked in surprise.

“Yes, of course I know it. Dragon Spike, the Dragon Assassin organization. I didn’t expect them to come to our East Sea city. Next, East Sea City will be in Chaos!”

The old Butler muttered, and his face slowly darkened.

“Tell me the details!”

The old man frowned and immediately asked him.

“Master, Dragon Spike is an assassin organization. As far as I know, they have become the kings of the underground in several towns under East Sea city. No one dares not to assassinate them!”

“Even...”as he spoke, he swallowed a mouthful of saliva, and his eyes were filled with shock!

“Even what?”

The old man hurriedly asked.

“Even, the mayor of bridge forest town was assassinated by Long Ci, and in broad daylight, he was killed!”

The old official licked his lips, “That Mayor has the strength of a Type 8 transcendent!”

“What?”

The old man’s face was filled with shock. He actually dared to assassinate the mayor, an expert of the Type 8 transcendent. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“I didn’t expect the dragon Spike to come!”

The Old Butler muttered!
