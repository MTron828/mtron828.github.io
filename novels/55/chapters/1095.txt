Chapter 1096: 1097 five elements formation

Translator: 5496903

“Everyone, take out your pills. Take them all out!”

“I have a transcendent tier 3 pill here. I have it here!”

“I have it too, I have it too!”

“I hope Commander Wang Can Help Us get through this crisis!”

“Lord Wang has already helped us enough. Even if we fail, we will not blame Lord Wang!”

In Holy Sea Town, Jin Qianyuan and a few experts of holy sea town floated in the air and took the pills one by one. They didn’t know what use the pills were for Commander Wang, but as long as they obeyed, it would be over.

At this time, only Lord Wang could be trusted.

“I hope all the pills in our pill workshop can help Lord Wang!”

“And the pills in our pill workshop!”

“Lord Wang, Do You Want Spirit Stones? I have a lot of spirit stones!”

“I have herbs here!”

They took out all the pills and spirit herbs that were usually extremely precious to them.

They moved very fast. Soon, more than 100,000 pills were taken out in the entire sacred sea town.

All of these were the accumulation of the entire sacred sea town.

Even Jin Qianyuan and the rest took out all the pills in their interspatial rings.

Outside the city wall, terrifying dark energy entered the body of the Blood Barbarian Demon Beast.

This was the first time Wang Xian saw a breakthrough of a void interpretation expert. This terrifying power was almost a hundred times stronger than a half-step void interpretation expert.

Even a hundred half-step void interpretation experts could not defeat a void interpretation expert.

After breaking through to the void interpretation realm, the divine ability would undergo a terrifying evolution. At that time, it would no longer be called a divine ability, but a dharma idol.

Moreover, after breaking through to the void interpretation realm, the divine ability comprehended by the transcendents could be easily used.

In the past, using it once would take half an hour to recover. After reaching the void interpretation realm, it would only take about five minutes.

Moreover, breaking through to the void interpretation realm was to transform the divine ability into a dharma idol. The power of the Dharma Idol was incomparably terrifying.

An insightful emptiness realm expert could easily destroy a town.

The palpitating power outside made everyone in holy sea town feel helpless. All they could do was to look at the young man standing on the city wall.

That was their only hope, their only hope of surviving.

“A half-step abhijna city-guarding formation can’t withstand it at all. I need at least five of them!”

Wang Xian looked at the items in the system’s Dragon King’s treasure house.

Now that he was in the extraordinary realm, he could only exchange for extraordinary items.

However, the only thing that could defend the holy sea town was the city-guarding formation.

“Sir Wang, the elixirs are here. These are the elixirs and spiritual herbs that everyone in the holy sea town has. They are all here. I wonder if they are enough!”

Jin Qianyuan flew to Wang Xian’s side and said to him nervously.

“I want to activate something. If the elixirs are not enough, I have no choice!”

Wang Xian took a glance at Jin Qianyuan and flew into the sky.

Everyone looked at Wang Xian but no one said a word.

In front of them was the abyss. Above them was their hope.

“So many? It should be enough!”

Standing thousands of meters high in the sky, Wang Xian looked at the pills in his interspatial ring. A smile appeared on his face.

He didn’t expect the entire Shenghai town to be able to produce so many pills.

It seemed that the more people there were, the more power there was. No one would hide their pills.

Wang Xian poured all of them into his mouth. The pills entered his stomach one by one and immediately turned into dragon energy.

“Ding! Consume the pills. Host’s dragon energy has increased by 500,000 Dragon Crystals!”

Ding...

“Ding! Consume the pills. Host’s dragon energy has increased by 800,000 Dragon Crystals!”

Ding...

“Ding! Consume the pills. Host’s Dragon Energy has increased by 1,000,000 Dragon Crystals!”

One by one, the pills entered his stomach. In the end, there was an increase of 1,010,000 dragon crystals.

“That’s enough. There’s still another 10,000 Dragon Crystals!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with excitement as he heaved a sigh of relief.

“Kekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekeke!”

At this moment, an excited and cold voice rang out, causing Wang Xian to feel a chill in his heart.

“Not good, it has made a breakthrough. It’s a void interpretation demonic beast, a void interpretation demonic beast!”

“It’s over, it’s over!”

Below, the people of Shenghai Town looked over hurriedly. They saw a seven to eight-meter-sized beast with two black sharp claws. Its arms were filled with ferocious teeth.

A ten-meter-long tail appeared on its back.

It was filled with demonic qi. Within a radius of a thousand meters, a monstrous bloody smell rushed into the clouds.

The Terror of the Void Interpretation Demonic Beast was fully displayed!

It smiled excitedly and stared in the direction of holy sea town with cold eyes.

At this moment, it slightly raised its head and slowly raised its arm, pointing at Holy Sea Town in the air.

The black energy instantly condensed into a thousand-meter-long death spear.

It gently pointed at the distance of about five thousand meters!

The black death spear streaked a black light in the air and instantly landed on holy sea town.

“Boom!”

The sound of a collision rang out, and the entire holy sea town began to tremble violently.

“Crack Crack Crack Crack!”

In the sky, the water element array let out the sound of glass shattering. It could be seen with the naked eye that the array was slowly cracking.

“Bang!”

In the end, the array completely dissipated!

It was only one attack, and it was five thousand meters away.

Everyone in Holy Sea town was stunned. Some people couldn’t help but sit up.

“Keke, all humans, prepare to die!”

The leader of the Blood Savage Beast revealed an excited and ferocious expression. With a strange cry, its body moved and directly rushed towards holy sea town.

His arm slowly grew longer, and the densely packed teeth on his arm were gnawing on it.

“Whoosh!”

He waved his arm, and streams of blood mist quickly spread towards Holy Sea town.

“It’s over!”

On the city wall, seeing the void interpretation experts rushing over, everyone couldn’t help but close their eyes.

They were waiting for death!

“Weng!”

Right at this moment, they suddenly felt the surrounding air turn cold, and the blood mist was completely blocked outside.

Everyone was slightly shocked. They raised their heads and looked over hurriedly.

A blue array had surrounded the entire holy sea town.

“It’s Lord Wang!”

Their Hearts jolted as hope reappeared in their eyes.

“Do you think a half-step void interpretation city protection array can stop me?”

The leader of the Blood Barbarian Demonic Beast’s cold voice was heard. His eyes were filled with killing intent as he stared at Wang Xian, who was a thousand meters above the holy sea town.

Buzz

However, under his gaze, the green energy in Wang Xian’s arm was spreading rapidly. It completely overlapped with the blue water energy.

When the leader of the Blood Barbarian Demonic Beast saw another half-step void interpretation level formation, a bloodthirsty look appeared in his eyes. “I swear, I will let you die in pain!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He stared at Wang Xian and spoke one sentence after another.

A hint of mockery appeared on Wang Xian’s face as he moved his arm again.

A fiery-red light screen appeared. This was not the end. It followed closely behind the earthen-yellow light screen.

Finally, it was the golden light screen.

Buzz

The entire holy sea quaked before it stabilized completely.

The strongest formation of the transcendence level, the five elements formation, was activated.

“Let me die in pain. Beast, come and kill me!”

A provocative voice sounded.
