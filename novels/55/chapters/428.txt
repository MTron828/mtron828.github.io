Chapter 429: Avenged

All the experts from Xiao Clan felt irony and bitterness.

But subsequently, doubts surfaced on their faces.

Why is he here for revenge? He claimed that his mother was killed.

All the experts turned their focus to the wealthy-looking lady, Xiao Fan, and Xiao Ran.

“What the hell is going on?” asked the old lady whose hands were shaking as she stared at the wealthy-looking lady.

The wealthy-looking lady did not answer her. She was pale and quiet. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Xiao Ran, since you’re one of the disciples of Xiao Clan, you’ll tell me the truth. We’ll stand up for you!” said the old lady to Xiao Ran with a darkened expression when she saw the wealthy-looking lady keeping her silence.

“Get lost!” Xiao Ran bellowed at that old woman, “I don’t need the Xiao Clan to stand up for me. Why would I need you now? Haha!” Xiao Ran scorned.

Talking about standing up for him now? Does he still need it?

What were they doing in the first place?

Xiao Ran swept his cold gaze across all the members of Xiao Clan. “The elders from the general office and pharmacy, I still remember what you guys said to my mum when she looked for you. All of you shall die too!”

As Xiao Ran spoke, he pointed the sword at Xiao Fan and lunged forward. “But I’ll kill you first so that your mum can feel the pain of losing kin!”

“No! Don’t you dare? Don’t you dare!”

The wealthy-looking lady screamed crazily. She pulled out a hairpin from her hair and pointed it at Xiao Ran with a ruthless look.

The old lady was shaken when Xiao Ran bellowed at her. With a mixed expression, she could not help but cough.

Her great-grandson had actually turned his back on her and chided her!

“You think you’re fit to stop me?”

Xiao Ran looked at the wealthy-looking lady with cold eyes as he slashed the Ancient Spiritual Sword at her.

Ah!

The wealthy-looking lady let out a devastating scream. Even though she was a strong Level 9 Martial Artist, she was not in Xiao Ran’s league.

As the sword swept across, the wealthy-looking lady’s arm was slashed off. The sword continued its stance as it was wielded at Xiao Fan.

“No... Don’t kill me!”

Xiao Fan was petrified as he quickly fled.

As the future successor and the most outstanding disciple of Xiao Clan, Xiao Fan chickened out and dared not fight with Xiao Ran at all.

The so-called Sacred Clan supreme talent was nothing like a clown now!

“I’ll kill you with the move that you used to humiliate me. Flame Stream!”

Xiao Ran wielded the Ancient Spiritual Sword. Sheets of Tranquil Blue Heavenly Flame transformed into blazing streamers, shooting at Xiao Fan.

Ah!

Xiao Fan did his best to dodge, but both his legs were hit by the sapphire flame.

He let out a painful cry as he witnessed his legs vanishing rapidly. Desperation filled his eyes.

“Son, my son!”

Hearing the shrieks coming from his son when the Tranquil Blue Heavenly Flame enveloped him, the wealthy-looking lady cried out in agony.

“What a daunting flame!”

Sigh!

All the people from Xiao Clan were stunned and astonished by what they saw. Their feelings were complicated when they looked at Xiao Fan.

“Go to hell, too!”

Xiao Ran pointed his sword at the wealthy-looking lady and killed her in a single move.

“Come on out, you two elders!”

Xiao Ran cast a look at the wealthy-looking lady and Xiao Fan, who had been reduced to ashes. He felt relieved as he turned to the other two elders.

Both of them had constant mixed expression.

All the surrounding experts of Xiao Clan were watching them.

Yet, no one spoke a word.

Now, they finally understood something, and they were at a loss of words.

Ultimately, it was Xiao Clan’s doing that a demon-like Xiao’s disciple came here for his revenge.

Based on the current situation, nobody could interfere with this.

That Xiao’s disciple had found himself a formidable master.

Upon seeing all the surrounding clan members holding their tongues, the two elders’ faces went pale.

They knew that they were completely finished this time.

Never did they expect that befriending that wealthy-looking lady would land them in such a state today.

Indeed, no one should bully the young ones!

With two agonizing cries sounding off in the Xiao Clan, Xiao Ran had eliminated all his enemies.

He’d taken his revenge!

Bam!

Xiao Ran knelt before Wang Xian with tears rolling down his cheeks. “Thank you, master! I have avenged my mum and the rest!”

“Since you’ve taken your revenge, we can leave now.”

Wang Xian patted his shoulder with a smile and got him to stand up. “Let’s go. You must practice hard from now on because you can only depend on yourself in the future. The true strength lies in yourself.”

As Wang Xian spoke, he slowly stalked out. Xiao Ran stood up with a forceful nod and followed behind him.

Phew!

As the Dragonians retreated, fifty of them simply strutted out of the mansion.

All the disciples of Xiao Clan heaved a sigh of relief but remained silent.

As they looked at the corpses on the floor, there was embarrassment, anger, humiliation, and complicated looks on them.

“Nobody shall breathe a word to anyone regarding what happened tonight!”

The old man in the air slowly descended as he issued warnings to the surrounding disciples.

They could not afford to throw their faces away with someone barging into the mighty Sacred Clan and left after killing a dozen people.

Especially when this was an ironic matter that involved a member of Xiao Clan exacting his revenge.

A victim member returning for revenge was the root of the problem.

If word got around, the entire Xiao Clan would be a laughing stock.

“Laozu has been informed. He’s furious about it. If this is not handled properly, everyone will have a difficult life!”

The current Clan Leader of Xiao Clan spoke with bitterness.

This matter involved the most outstanding disciple of Xiao Clan, his mother, and two elders.

They had joined hands to destroy a member of Xiao Clan. Moreover, he was such a super formidable disciple.

A disciple who had advanced to Inborn Realm at a mere age of fifteen.

The severity of this matter infuriated Laozu more than someone killing members of Xiao Clan

“Xiao Ran, Miracle Doctor Wang!”

As the experts watched the figures disappearing into the dark, their eyes blinked. Eventually, everyone exclaimed.

Wang Xian chuckled and, upon seeing Xiao Ran in a trance after exacting his revenge, said, “It’s time you think about how you’re going to lead your life now!”

Since he had taken his revenge, he had lost the goal in his life.

It was time to think about how to lead his life from now on.

Wang Xian would not interfere with his life. He could only take care of his disciple for the time being and not for his entire life. He would be on his own in the future.

“Thank you, master!”

Xiao Ran lifted his chin and looked at Wang Xian as he nodded with force.

A new chapter of life had begun!
