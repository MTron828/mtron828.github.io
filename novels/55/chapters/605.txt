Chapter 606: Grand Master

“Huh? The contest to select ten disciples to enter the Yong Chang Cauldron is starting tomorrow?”

Wang Xian was surprised when he overheard the conversation of the disciples by the side.

“Yeah. The selection will last for more than half a month!” that disciple answered respectfully.

“More than half a month? So long?”

Wang Xian raised an eyebrow and looked confused.

“The grand contest of disciples from the three Immortal Sects... Yong Chang world is about to descend to the real world. To ensure that disciples from all Immortal Sects can experience huge incremental growth, the three Immortal Sects have decided to host a grand contest for all their disciples. The top thirty will receive elixir pills and spiritual equipment as rewards. Besides that, the top ten will qualify to enter the Yong Chang Cauldron!” That disciple continued his explanation for Wang Xian.

“Oh? Is that right?”

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly and answered, “I’m not going. Get me another batch of spiritual medicine. I’m going to continue refining!”

“Yes!”

That disciple was impressed.

Despite becoming an alchemist master and blacksmith master at the young age of twenty, he was still as diligent. This made an ordinary disciple like him feel ashamed.

Wang Xian wasn’t interested in the grand contest of disciples or entering the Yong Chang Cauldron.

At this point, Wang Xian wanted to prepare resources for Roving Sword, the dragonians, and others after reaching Level 9.

Continue with refining elixir pills!

For the subsequent period, Wang Xian was once again immersed in refining elixir pills.

After his level had increased, Wang Xian’s speed in refining elixir pills had increased substantially.

Ten days later, after refining all spiritual medicine in Da Hong Immortal Sect into elixir pills, Wang Xian requested to refine Level 7 elixir pills.

The five Elders were shocked when they received the news.

Refining Level 7 elixir pills! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Level 7 elixir pills could substantially increase the strength of a Budding Realm expert.

Elite elixir pills like these had always been refined by an Immortal Realm expert in Da Hong Immortal Sect.

There were definitely not more than three alchemist grand masters in the entire Yong Chang City.

Two of them were Immortal Realm experts while the other was a Budding Realm alchemist grand master from Yong Chang Immortal Sect who had to rely on a Level 13 alchemy furnace.

The five Elders didn’t reject Wang Xian’s request and gave him ten sets of materials.

The five Elders had given him ten sets for Wang Xian to try out first. If he was successful with these sets, they would allow Wang Xian to continue.

It wasn’t because the Elders were stingy but mainly because Da Hong Immortal Sect also didn’t have lots of Level 7 spiritual medicine.

To refine a Level 7 elixir pill, one required forty-nine tufts of spiritual medicine. If it was unsuccessful, it would be a huge loss.

Moreover, Da Hong Immortal Sect didn’t have a lot of Level 7 spiritual medicine.

Wang Xian readily accepted their conditions for the ten sets of materials. Using two days, he refined the ten sets into Level 7 elixir pills.

The time required to refine Level 7 elixir pills had exceeded Wang Xian’s expectation completely.

Wang Xian gave the five Elders twelve pills. Once again, the five of them were dumbfounded.

Close to a thirty percent success rate! He was able to reach a thirty percent success rate!

Grand master! An alchemist grand master!

They looked at Wang Xian fervently as though they were staring at a peerless beauty.

Following which, they gave Wang Xian another twenty sets of materials for him to refine.

These twenty sets were also the remaining materials that they had the authority to use.

Wang Xian accepted readily. In total, Wang Xian gave the five elders thirty-six Level 7 elixir pills from thirty sets of materials.

The five Elders were exhilarated.

What they don’t know is that my success rate is still a hundred percent. I have eighty-four Level 7 elixir pills with me and each one could give me more than a million units of dragon energy. With eighty-four pills, that’s more than eighty million units of dragon energy!

Wang Xian stared at the elixir pills in his hands with excitement.

Although eighty million units of dragon energy was insignificant compared to the requirement of one billion to reach the First Transformation of the Divine Dragon Transformation, it was still sufficient to help Roving Sword reach Level 13.

Besides that, these elixir pills would also substantially strengthen the dragonians.

“Let me nurture these five spiritual liquid balls into a Water Dragon Ball first. Although merging five Level 12 spiritual liquid balls might not reach Level 13, it will still be pretty strong!”

When his level increased, Wang Xian wouldn’t require them to refine Level 7 elixir pills. He placed them into his body instantly and started nurturing.

Wang Xian now had two thousand Level 5 elixir pills, four hundred Level 6 elixir pills and eighty-four Level 7 elixir pills!

Wang Xian looked at the elixir pills he had saved over the past half a month and smiled subconsciously.

Other than those he had obtained from Da Hong Immortal Sect, some of these elixir pills were from the customers he had accepted through his shop.

“These elixir pills would be more than sufficient to strengthen the dragonians and the Dragon Palace. At that time, I won’t have to worry, even if the other eight cauldron worlds are appearing in the real world!”

Wang Xian’s eyes beamed with excitement.

“Bring in the materials for spiritual equipment.

Refining of spiritual equipment. Refining of spiritual equipment in a frenzy.

In less than ten days, Wang Xian had refined over a thousand pieces of spiritual equipment.

He had also obtained three to four hundred pieces of spiritual equipment in the process.

Level 12 Spiritual equipment!

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up and he got ready to refine Level 12 spiritual equipment.

This time, the five Elders didn’t hesitate at all and gave all the materials to him.

When Wang Xian had been refining elixir pills and spiritual equipment, the Yong Chang world had been exceptionally lively over the past half a month.

The grand contest between disciples of three Immortal Sects was going on and the top ten would qualify to enter the Yong Chang Cauldron for cultivation.

When everyone heard about it, they were frenzied.

Yong Chang Cauldron was the most elite spiritual equipment and an Immortal Treasure. Entering it was an attractive option.

Moreover, based on historical records, all the Immortals had reached that stage within the Yong Chang Cauldron.

The spiritual energy in it was so dense that it could almost be considered liquid. Cultivating in it would be dozens of times more effective. It was the holy ground for countless experts.

Countless capable disciples would fight for the ten slots with all their might.

Other than these ten slots, the top thirty disciples would also receive immense rewards.

Level 11 spiritual equipment, a Level 6 elixir pill and five thousand spiritual stones!

The three Immortal Sects had expended huge resources in preparation of substantially improving the strength of their disciples.

The competition ground was in Yong Chang Immortal Sect. It was also the largest site of the three Immortal Sects.

Each arena spanned several miles and there were over twenty arenas. More than several hundreds of thousands of people could sit around these arenas.

“Soundless Sword!”

“Breathless Sword!”

“Dustless Sword!”

“Sorrowless Sword!”

At this very moment and in an arena of Yong Chang Immortal Sect, a middle-aged man held a longsword in his hand. As he waved the sword, sword energies penetrated a young man soundlessly, breathlessly, dustlessly, and sorrowlessly.

“What is this... Merciless Swordsmanship! What an incredible display of Merciless Swordsmanship!”

“Sss... Yonglin is defeated! The third-ranked disciple of Yong Chang Immortal Sect was defeated! That middle-aged man is too strong!”

“He was executed soundless, breathless, dustless and sorrowless in an instant! Where did this disciple from Immortal Slaying Sect come from? Why haven’t I heard of him before?”

“His name is Roving Sword. Based on what I’ve gathered, he only joined the Immortal Slaying Sect a while back. He is incredibly strong and especially so in sword technique. He is widely regarded by many in Immortal Slaying Sect to be a once in a ten-thousand-year genius that has a high chance of reaching the Immortal Realm!”
