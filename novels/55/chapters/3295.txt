3296 3,095 cups of tea were used to exterminate the two races

Boom! Boom! Boom

Waves of terrifying aura rushed forward.

The huge dragon’s aura covered the entire world.

When the Dragon Palace’s aura charged towards the two races, all the experts and disciples of the Ancient Sea Race of the righteous God race were shocked.

This was especially so for the two ancestors of the righteous god race. At this moment, their expressions changed drastically.

Their eyes were fixed on the dragon of darkness beside Wang Xian, and their hearts were beating violently.

They could feel the power of the same level from the demonic dragon.

It was even stronger than them because the other party was a divine dragon.

The Dragon Palace had more than 60,000 universe knights. They could barely accept it because they had the combat strength of two universe knights at the seventh level and had a powerful righteous god combat body.

In terms of high-end combat power, they had a huge advantage.

But now, when a universe Knight Level 7 Dragon God appeared in the Dragon Palace, their expressions changed drastically.

This power, it was impossible for their true God race to destroy the Dragon Palace.

The Dragon of Darkness, along with the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, the power of the dragon palace was not much weaker than their true God race.

Especially the number of universe knights in the Dragon Palace was too many.

At this moment, the expressions of all the great beings of the ancient sea race became even more awkward and terrified.

With the power of the Dragon Palace, it would be a piece of cake for the ancient sea race to be annihilated.

“Damn it, retreat, Retreat!”

The two ancestors of the true God race growled in a low voice with a gloomy face.

This time, the righteous God race had suffered a great loss.

Not only could they not destroy the Dragon Palace, but they had also completely offended it.

They had also given up on the landing battle.

This huge loss was difficult for them to accept.

However, in this situation, if they continued to fight, their losses would be even greater.

“Retreat, Retreat!”

When the experts of the ancient sea race heard the words of the ancestor of the Righteous God, they immediately roared loudly.

F * ck, they were no match for him at all.

“I’ve already said, Don’t leave when you’re here. Kill them all!”

Wang Xian looked at them with a mocking expression and immediately ordered loudly.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

In the next moment, the members of the Dragon Palace rushed forward without any hesitation.

“Dragon King, don’t be so arrogant. Do you really think that we are afraid of You? In terms of high-level combat strength, Your Dragon Palace is no match for us.”

Seeing that the Dragon Palace dared to attack them directly, the ancestor of the Righteous God race roared with an embarrassed expression.

According to the power of the Dragon Palace, the number of Level 6 universe knights in the Dragon Palace was much lower than theirs.

Furthermore, there were only two level seven universe knights in the Dragon Palace.

If they were to really fight, the righteous God race might not be afraid. They just didn’t want to lose too much!

The Dragon Palace was pushing their luck. This made them extremely furious.

The two ancestors of the righteous god race stared at Wang Xian. Their eyes were filled with killing intent.

“Haha, You Are Courting Death. If I say I will destroy you today, I will destroy you today!”

Wang Xian laughed maniacally. In the next moment, the incipient Saint Wings appeared behind him. His figure moved and disappeared instantly.

“Huh?”

The pupils of the two elders of the righteous god race shrunk slightly when they saw Wang Xian disappearing instantly.

“Who gave you the courage to destroy the Dragon Palace?”

In the next moment, Wang Xian’s figure rang beside their ears.

Hearing the voice that was so close to them, the faces of the two ancestors of the righteous god race changed drastically. They revealed an astonished expression.

Their bodies trembled as they looked ahead.

Five meters ahead of them was only five meters away.

The Dragon King was already five meters away from them.

However, they did not notice anything.

Gulp

The two of them swallowed a mouthful of saliva. Their foreheads were instantly filled with cold sweat.

“You You…”

Their bodies trembled.

“Huh? You’re not arrogant anymore?”

Wang Xian looked at them and smiled.

“How is this possible? How is this possible!”

One of the ancestors of the Righteous God race roared in disbelief. His eyes were filled with despair. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Killing you guys is like slaughtering dogs!”

Wang Xian smiled and extended his palm.

“Run, run, run!”

The two of them did not hesitate at all. They fled to the side in horror.

Buzz

But in the next moment, Wang Xian’s figure disappeared. When he reappeared, he had two ancestors of the righteous god race in his hands.

Whoosh! Whoosh

At this moment, in front of them, everyone stared blankly at the two figures in the Dragon King’s hands. They felt their vision go black.

Especially for the powerhouses of the Righteous God race, they were their ancestors.

A Universe Knight Level 7 being was subdued by the Dragon King in an instant!

Just how powerful was the Dragon King?

“It’s over, we’re finished, we’re finished!”

The Universe Knight Level 6 Great Beings of the righteous God race saw this scene and roared in fear.

“Run, run, run, run as many as you can!”

The leader of the Righteous God race roared mournfully.

“Dragon King’s power is not at Universe Knight Level 7, it’s even stronger. How is this possible? No, no, no!”

On the ancient sea race’s side, the leader of the ancient sea race saw this scene and his face was filled with disbelief and despair.

They were on the verge of collapse.

Not to mention the 60,000 universe knights in Dragon Palace, Dragon King’s power was still above universe Knight Level 7.

The two ancestors of the true God race were instantly killed.

How could they fight?

They were just waiting to die!

Peng

At this time, the two ancestors of the true God race trembled and were thrown towards the Dragon Palace.

The Dragon King waved his arm and a terrifying true treasure attacked the true God race, but he closed his eyes and floated in the air.

“Run!”

All the Great Beings of the true God race saw their forefather killed, and they saw the dragon king hovering in the air with his eyes closed.

This was a chance for them to survive.

They ran as far as they could.

However, to the horror of the universe knights and level six great beings of the true God race, the disc-like treasure gave off a despairing aura as it attacked them.

Roar! Roar! Roar

The Five Godly Dragons roared at the five elements grinding mill, and a powerful pressure swept across them. The level-six universe knights felt as if the starry sky was pressing down on them.

They were invincible!

“We’re completely finished!”

They didn’t even have the slightest intention of defending against a single treasure. They knew that the true God race was completely finished.

Hong! Hong! Hong

A terrifying energy swept past, and the 22 universe knights and level six great beings of the true God race were instantly killed.

Roar! Roar! Roar

At the side, the Dark Dragon roared and charged toward the ancient sea race. The terrifying Devil Flames blotted out the sky and covered the Sun.

Little Blue let out a low growl, locked her gaze on the 90 or so space hum beasts, and rushed over.

“Die!”

At this moment, all the experts and disciples of the Righteous God race and the Ancient Sea Race lost their fighting spirit.
