Chapter 1568: 1568 saint of Light 7

“To destroy the darkness soul with the powerful power of light requires precise control, especially when Qing city is of the darkness attribute. It is extremely difficult!”

“However, the strength of the morning light has increased by quite a lot. This angel of light is not bad!”

Dark Eye Elder’s eyes were also staring intently at this place. He commented indifferently when he saw the morning light elder attack.

“Although the crown prince has been invaded by seventeen darkness souls, it is fortunate that they are all at the sixth level of the profound void tier!”

“With the increase in my strength, I can accurately control twenty angels of light. It is not too difficult to deal with the Darkness Souls!”

When Dawn Light Patriarch heard dark eye patriarch’s words, he said indifferently.

“Hiss, controlling twenty angels of Light, Dawn Light Patriarch’s control over light is terrifying!”

“Yeah, it’s simply too powerful. If only I had such powerful control, that would be great!”

“The patriarch is worthy of being the patriarch. In terms of control over the light attribute, no one can rival him!”

“It seems that the dark soul in the crown prince’s body can be quickly dispelled!”

In the surroundings, when everyone saw the morning light patriarch controlling seventeen angels of light into the body of Wuqing City, all the radiant priests had looks of amazement on their faces.

Such control over the light was indeed worthy of being the number one radiant priest.

When Wang Xian saw the move of the Patriarch of the morning light, he raised his eyebrows slightly and revealed a hint of surprise on his face. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“As expected of a radiant priest at the eighth level of the Seethrough void tier. His control ability is indeed powerful!”

Wang Xian didn’t hold back and directly praised.

“HMPH, with your strength, you don’t have the right to judge our patriarch. Just watch with Your Eyes Wide Open and broaden your horizons!”

When Tian Qingguang heard his words, he glanced at Wang Xian with a gloomy face and said mockingly.

Wu Qingyan clenched her fists at Wang Xian and raised her head slightly.

Wang Xian did not shift his gaze. His Dragon Eyes of fire and light were staring straight into Wu Qingcheng’s body.

He felt that the Darkness Souls in Wu Qingcheng’s body were not that simple.

These darkness souls were completely complete and possessed powerful intelligence.

“They have joined forces!”

As expected, just as Wang Xian expected, when the seventeen angels of light entered the body of Wu Qing City and were about to destroy the Darkness Souls, all the Darkness Souls actually joined forces.

“Huh?”

Forefather of the morning light was slightly stunned when he heard Wang Xian’s words. When he sensed that the darkness souls in the body of Wu Qing city were about to join forces, his expression changed slightly.

He glanced at Wang Xian in surprise and his aura trembled.

“HMPH, even if they joined forces, they will definitely die today. How dare they stay in the body of the Crown Prince of Wuqing City? Prepare to be purified!”

A strong sense of confidence appeared on forefather Chenguang’s face. The Radiant Angel staff in his hand shook once again. Three more radiant angels appeared and fell into the body of Wuqing City.

They used their powerful control to suppress the soul of darkness.

Even Wang Xian had to admit the strength of the forefather of the morning light. He was indeed worthy of being the pioneer of the radiant priest.

“With his current strength, he is indeed able to control the soul of darkness...”

Wang Xian watched from the side as he muttered.

However, before he could finish his words, his expression instantly turned grave.

“This is troublesome. Stop immediately!”

Wang Xian quickly said to Patriarch of dawn light.

“Shut up. Don’t talk nonsense when our patriarch banishes you!”

“A kid who thinks he can interfere with our patriarch just because he has some strength? He doesn’t know his place!”

As soon as Wang Xian finished his sentence, two priests of light shouted coldly from the side.

“This is bad!”

As soon as the two priests of light finished their words, forefather Chenguang’s heart skipped a beat and his expression turned ugly.

“Come out!”

He shouted immediately and twenty angels of light flew out from Wu Qing Cheng’s body.

“Ah Ah, Roar Roar!”

At this moment, Wu Qing Cheng suddenly let out a blood-curdling scream.

Following that, the blood-curdling scream turned into a terrifying beast roar.

The roar was filled with a brutal expression.

Wu Qing Cheng’s eyes changed rapidly like a wild beast.

“Devour! Seventeen darkness souls are actually being devoured. They are about to merge into one and evolve!”

Seeing this scene, forefather dawn light’s body trembled and his face turned pale.

He stared at Wu Qing Cheng’s body and his expression kept changing.

“What happened?”

Dark Eye patriarch appeared in front of Wu Qing Cheng in an instant and stared at him.

Wu Qing Cheng’s body was trembling violently. His face, stomach, and arms bulged one after another. His skin was torn as if it was going to explode.

“Evil creature, if you dare to hurt my descendant’s life, I will turn you into ashes!”

Patriarch dark eye growled in a deep voice as a terrifying and brutal aura rushed into Wu Qing city’s body.

At this moment, Patriarch Dark Eye was like an awakened darkness demon god, looking down at the entire world.

The Darkness Souls in Wu Qing city’s body sensed this aura and immediately fell silent.

Their skin began to recover.

“Plop!”

At this moment, Patriarch Dawn Light, who was standing by the side, sensed this aura and immediately knelt down.

“Lord dark pupil, it’s my fault. I didn’t expect that this group of darkness souls would actually devour and evolve each other. Now, I...”

He knelt beside forefather dark pupil, lowered his head, and said with an extremely unsightly expression.

When all the surrounding radiant priests saw forefather dawn light kneeling down, their hearts turned cold.

“Is there any other way?”

Forefather dark pupil stood there and swept a glance at forefather dawn light, his expression slowly sinking.

“Unless... unless there’s a radiant priest at level nine of the insight void, otherwise...”

Morning Light Patriarch said with an extremely ugly expression.

There was no radiant priest at level nine of the insight void in the entire transcendence continent.

His words made everyone in Wuji dynasty look extremely ugly.

This meant that the crown prince of Wuqing city was about to fall!

The death of the Crown Prince was a major event for the entire Wuji dynasty!

Everyone around them fell silent. Their expressions were ugly.

“All radiant priests, investigate Qing city. If anyone can cure them, our Wuji Empire will give you whatever you want!”

At this moment, Patriarch Dark Eye expressionlessly glanced at all the radiant priests and said coldly.

Everyone could feel the faint pressure coming from his body.

Some of the weaker ones had cold sweat forming on their foreheads.

All the radiant priests hesitated for a moment before taking two steps forward. They carefully sized up the crown prince of Wuqing City who was floating in the air.

“Big Brother!”

“Qing City!”

The people from Wuji Empire clenched their fists tightly in the surroundings. Their expressions were extremely ugly.

Everyone from the He clan and Bingxin Empire looked over in astonishment.

They didn’t expect that the Crown Prince of Wuji Imperial City of Wuji Empire would actually die in the hands of the Darkness Soul.

“I want three light pearls of the eighth level of the void interpretation stage and ten light pearls of the seventh level of the Void Interpretation Stage!”

At this moment, Wang Xian swept his gaze across the surroundings with ease. His gaze landed on Wu Qing city as he spoke indifferently.

His voice resounded in the ears of everyone around.
