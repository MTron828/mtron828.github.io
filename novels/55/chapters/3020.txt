Chapter 3021: No. 3020 created a bloody path to intimidate No. 4

“Die!”

On one of the core planets of the living soul race, Wang Xian was emitting a violent murderous aura as he charged toward the experts of the living soul race.

With his terrifying speed and overwhelming strength, he easily killed four level seven celestial thearch experts.

“Who are you? Why did you invade our living soul race!”

When some of the living soul race powerhouses who had rushed over from behind saw this scene, their faces were filled with fear as they roared again.

“Those who trespass our dragon palace will be killed even if they are far away!”

Wang Xian growled in a low voice. A terrifying murderous aura spread to the surroundings.

“Dragon Palace?”

When some of the citizens on the planet heard these words, their faces were filled with astonishment.

“Run!”

The group of living soul race powerhouses who were flying over felt Wang Xian’s strength. When they heard his words, their expressions changed as they roared immediately.

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

However, the group of experts who were rushing over from behind were not very strong. An Lie’s figure flashed and killed all of them before anyone could react.

As for the Divine Emperors of the living soul race who were further away, they were so frightened that they hurriedly fled and returned to their divine kingdom in an instant.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the surroundings. When he saw all the divine emperors fleeing for their lives, he spoke to the heaven’s formation.

Ao Yao and the rest of the Heaven Formation flew to Wang Xian’s side and flew into the void immediately. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“This… Dragon Palace? Is it the Dragon Palace in the ruins of the Mohan clan? Why are they attacking us all of a sudden?”

“They will be killed even if they are far away? Did Our Living Soul clan offend their Dragon Palace?”

“What happened to our Grand Supreme Elder Now?”

On the planet, countless people from the living soul clan were discussing in fear.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

Not long after, a large number of experts from the living soul race were teleported over from the planet’s teleportation array. There were more than 100,000 experts, and their bodies were emitting a terrifying pressure.

The few experts in the lead were all eighth level divine emperor experts.

“The first Elder’s divine plate has already been shattered. How did the Dragon Palace rush over to our place so quickly?”

Everyone looked toward the Blessed Land of the first Supreme Elder of the living soul tribe. Their eyes swept across the surroundings and their expressions were extremely gloomy.

Not long after their people arrived at the starry sky, the Dragon Palace sent people to kill them.

Even if they were far away, they would be killed. Was this a warning?

“Next Place!”

At this moment, in the starry sky of the living soul tribe, Wang Xian looked at an lie and said with a smile.

“It’s the Dragon King and the thousand-hand race!”

An lie nodded and disappeared instantly.

Two hours later, a huge battle broke out on the thousand-hand continent of the thousand-hand race.

More than 200 celestial thearchs from the thousand-hand race were killed, including 10 celestial thearchs at level seven.

Four hours later, more than 700 celestial thearchs from an ancient race and a domain-level race were killed on the road of one race.

Eight hours later, more than 800 celestial thearch powerhouses from the brain spirit race and domain-level race were killed on a planet.

As time passed, more and more races and domain-level planets were attacked. At least 700 to 800 celestial thearch powerhouses were killed.

Furthermore, there were basically seven to eight celestial thearch powerhouses who died completely.

In the beginning, Wang Xian and the rest’s attacks only caused a stir in a small area.

When the four powerful races were attacked consecutively, the matter on the AI of the Universe became more and more sensational.

“What’s going on? is the Dragon Palace courting death? In such a short period of time, they attacked four to five powerful forces!”

“What’s going on? is the Dragon Palace in the starry sky crazy? Attacking the races one by one? Are they seeking their own destruction?”

“They killed an eighth level divine emperor expert of the brain spirit race, and even the current young clan leader of the brain spirit race was killed!”

“The people from the Dragon Palace said that those who offend the Dragon Palace will be killed even if they are far away. Could it be that these races have invaded the Dragon Palace?”

“That’s crazy. They are directly assassinating the experts of various forces. Aren’t they f * cking afraid that they will join hands to kill you?”

Countless people in the universe’s AI were shocked when they saw this information.

Not long ago, the three-eyed race and the four-armed race announced that they were disbanded and completely destroyed. The Dragon Palace that destroyed the two major races rose up in this starry sky.

The information about the Dragon Palace that the three-eyed race and the four-armed race released caused a stir.

Countless people were discussing on the AI.

Many factions were also secretly moving.

However, in just half a month, the Dragon Palace’s experts were crazily assassinating the experts of various races?

This…

What was going on?

Was the Dragon Palace crazy?

However, the fact that the Dragon Palace was able to assassinate so many experts at such a terrifying speed also shocked many people.

“In a short ten hours or so, the Dragon Palace has assassinated five factions. Even if they were to hurry, it would be too late!”

“This dragon palace is not simple. They were able to kill a level eight celestial thearch powerhouse without giving him a chance to escape. It seems like they might have a level nine celestial thearch powerhouse or a powerful treasure!”

“Now that things are getting lively, will they still assassinate the powerhouses from other forces?”

On the universe’s artificial intelligence, the disciples of the domain-level races were discussing among themselves.

However, Wang Xian and the rest’s actions made the expressions of the experts from the brain spirit race, ancient rare race, and the other factions a little awkward.

“The Dragon Palace should know that our people have entered his domain. He is taking revenge one by one and intimidating them one by one!”

At this moment, on a continent, a huge sculpture of the founder of the brain spirit race stood at the center of the continent. It was over a million meters tall.

Behind the sculpture, the experts of the brain spirit race gathered in a large hall. Their expressions were extremely gloomy.

An eighth level divine emperor expert had been killed. Even the son of their clan leader, the outstanding young Clan Leader of the brain spirit race, had been killed.

This was a complete provocation to their brain spirit race.

“Revenge? Deterrence? They are courting death!”

“They dare to kill our young patriarch. They are trying to start a war!”

An angry brain spirit race expert roared angrily.

“Since the other side dares to assassinate several forces and directly state their names, they are not afraid of our revenge. Moreover, in the eyes of the Dragon Palace, we are the enemy.”

“They want to use this madness to deter other races.”

An elder of the brain spirit race who was sitting in the middle said indifferently, his eyes shining.

Water flowed on his enormous brain, looking a bit strange and sacred.

“Intimidate? Do they really think that domain level races are so easy to intimidate? Unless they can display even more powerful strength!”

The head of the brain spirit race who was sitting next to the elder said with a sinister expression.

“I’ll go and take a look and check out the situation of the Dragon Palace.”

The expert of the brain spirit race who had just spoken slowly stood up and said.

“Old Head, be careful. There’s something strange about the Dragon Palace!”

The rest of the brain spirit race immediately said.
