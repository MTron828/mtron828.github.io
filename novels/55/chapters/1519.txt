Chapter 1520: 1520 priest Wang from the Holy Medicine Shop

“Young man, if you go to the holy medicine shop, with your strong light power, you can definitely become an important priest of light in our Holy Medicine Shop!”

“When the time comes, I will tell the owner about your matter. I will be by your side to help you in the future!”

“Although I am not strong, I have experienced the ups and downs of life and know a lot of things. Young man, if you have anything, just ask me. Maybe I can give you some advice!”

Old Hu was a very open-minded person. Even though Wang Xian was very strong, his attitude did not change.

This made Wang Xian very comfortable. Coming to this unfamiliar place, he could also learn a lot from Old Hu.

“I’ll go tell Tang Mei about you. You stay here now!”

Old Hu patted his shoulder and walked out with a smile. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Wang Xian sat in the car and looked at the location of his heart.

About 80% of his heart was pitch black while the remaining 20% was bright!

I still need to have a deeper understanding of the light. I need to master and use more of the power of light

Wang Xian thought to himself.

When he became a demonic dragon, his understanding of the darkness had reached a terrifying level.

At this moment, only by improving his understanding and utilization of light could he achieve a balance.

“Young man, we have arrived at the ruins of the Kingdom of God. Do you want to come out and take a look?”

Not long after, Old Hu’s voice came from outside.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded immediately and went outside. He looked around.

“This is?”

When Wang Xian walked out and looked ahead, he revealed a look of shock.

It was a huge empty space with the ground paved with pitch-black stone slabs.

An aura of desolation rushed over.

He looked around and saw various buildings.

It was similar to the cemetery of the human and demon. There were no cities here and they were all built separately.

What shocked him was a huge black building dozens of kilometers away. The building looked like an altar.

There was a huge body on it. The body was made of black stone, and it looked like it was looking down at the entire world.

That person was once the owner of the divine kingdom ruins.

Later generations called him demigod haiming.

Demigod Haiming was a terrifying mighty figure in the ancient times. He controlled the entire divine kingdom forest and his strength was heaven and earth.

Legend had it that at that time, he wasn’t even afraid of the Dragon Race.

However, Demigod Dark Abyss had died on his way to becoming a god.

He had left behind this god country ruins, a huge space.

Their location was similar to the area in front of the palace.

This area was 500 kilometers long. Within these 500 kilometers, it had become a place where vast areas gathered.

The three superpowers and eight first-rate forces had all gathered here.

All of them were here to obtain the god Country Ruins’treasures.

Back then, demigod Hei Ming had collected a terrifying amount of resources in order to break through to become a god.

These resources could easily be used to build a dynasty.

Some even said that if one could obtain all the treasures in the god country ruins, they could build an empire.

Over the past tens of thousands of years, countless experts had come to this place. There was even an empire’s longevity realm expert who wanted to enter, but he never came out.

However, even at the borders, there were terrifying resources. Every day, millions of people would enter the god country ruins.

Unfortunately, tens of thousands of years had passed, and 20% of the veil of the god country ruins had not been lifted.

Because demigod dark abyss was of the darkness attribute, the entire God country ruins were filled with darkness creatures.

There were even strange creatures like the dark soul.

Some people said that it was formed from the remnant thoughts of the Dark Abyss demigod after he died.

Because of the ruins of the divine kingdom, the light priest profession was born.

There were many people around, and it was like a huge chaotic city.

The deeper they went, the more luxurious it became, and the more orderly the plan became.

The entire space seemed to be prohibited from flying. Everyone had to walk on the ground.

Among the people who passed by, Wang Xian did not see anyone below level five or level seven or eight of transcendence. It was very common here.

It gathered the powerful forces and elites of the entire vast region. One could imagine how many strong people there were.

After driving for three hours, the carriage slowly stopped in front of a shop.

The hiring association was located a few thousand meters away from the shop. This was considered a central location.

This was a shop with a height of ten stories. The words ‘Holy Medicine Clinic’were written on it. At the entrance, there were two beautiful women dressed in pure white clothes waiting for them.

The entire clinic occupied an area of about a thousand meters.

“Young master Wang, this is our holy medicine clinic. If you really want to become a priest of light, I’ll bring you upstairs to meet our Master!”

The old lady walked over and said to Wang Xian respectfully.

“MMM, if nothing goes wrong, I will stay in the Holy Medicine Clinic for a period of time!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“Alright, Follow Me!”

The old lady nodded her head and brought him inside immediately.

Wang Xian, Lao Hu, and the rest followed behind. As for the few girls behind, they obviously didn’t have the same treatment as Wang Xian.

“Chief Tang!”

The three of them walked in. The two beauties at the door immediately greeted him respectfully.

“There are six radiant priests at the insightful void level in our holy medicine clinic. Each radiant priest at the insightful void level occupies a floor to treat the guests at the insightful void level!”

“I am one of the main managers below the insightful void level. The main income of our clinic comes from this clinic!”

The old lady said to Wang Xian as she led him up the stairs.

As soon as they entered the medical center, a strong light energy was transmitted over. The gentle energy made people feel refreshed as if they were bathed in spring.

There were injured people entering the rooms one by one.

“There are a large number of dark creatures in the ruins of the Kingdom of God and the forest of the Kingdom of God. They are all extremely strange and have different treatment methods for all kinds of injuries!”

“Our Holy Medicine Clinic is located in the ruins of the Kingdom of God. It can be considered to be a little famous. There are only five more famous than us!”

The old lady introduced to Wang Xian and walked up the stairs.

The higher they went, the fewer patients there were. They went all the way to the top floor.

The top floor had an area of 1,000 meters and was extremely luxurious.

“I can’t do anything about it. Captain Yun Gu’s bone corrosion poison is too deep. I can’t deal with it. Captain Yun Gu can go to the holy light clinic to seek the treatment of a stronger radiant priest!”

They had just reached the top floor when they saw an old man dressed in white with a scepter in his hand speaking to a middle-aged man.

Behind the middle-aged man were five or six middle-aged men who were emitting a bloody aura.

“Sigh, my abdomen has been hit by the bone corrosion demonic flower’s dark energy. If I don’t deal with it, my strength will be affected by fifty percent. Since priest Tang Yi can’t deal with it, I can only go to another medical hall to take a look!”

The middle-aged man was shirtless. He shook his head helplessly and put on his clothes.

“Bone eroding demonic flower, bone eroding poison?”

Wang Xian followed behind him. His eyes were sparkling as he looked at the middle-aged man’s abdomen.
