Chapter 1236: No. 1,237 versus Heaven’s Pride

Translator: 5496903

On the Heaven’s pride leaderboard, each and every name was emitting an eye-catching light. Even if they were very far away, they could still be seen clearly.

Wang Xian scanned the names on the leaderboard.

“Oh my God, another Black Horse has appeared. That Mu Yuan has actually reached the ninth place on the Heaven’s Pride Leaderboard!”

“Hiss, there are so many black horses these days. The Heaven’s pride leaderboard changes every day. Some of the Heaven’s pride leaderboards in the past were directly pushed down!”

“That’s because the prodigy bridge will appear in a dozen days. Once it appears, it will connect to the prodigy stage on the other side of the demonic beasts. At that time, when the prodigies of the human and demon races compete, the demonic beasts will be able to obtain the title of the prodigy Paragon and receive a large number of rewards!”

“The Prodigy Paragon. This means that in the entire flowing sea region, humans and demonic beasts are the strongest of the younger generation. As far as I know, the prodigy Paragon was only obtained by the sect master of the Heavenly Sword sect a hundred years ago. For nearly a hundred years, it was all the demonic beasts that obtained the title of The Prodigy Paragon!”

“Demonic Beasts are born with inheritances. Powerful demonic beasts can reach the level of the Seethrough Void realm within a few decades. There’s no way for us to compete with them. I wonder if senior Qian ye will be able to obtain the title of supreme prodigy this year!”

The people around also raised their heads to look at the Heaven’s pride roll. The sounds of their conversation entered Wang Xian’s ears.

“Supreme prodigy?”

Wang Xian glanced at the list and heard the voices around him. He mumbled softly.

His gaze swept across the surroundings. The entire heaven’s favorites arena was like a huge training square. Groups of young people were gathered here.

In the middle of the arena, there were some arenas. There were young people sparring on the arenas, and there were also people fighting on the arenas.

The Heaven’s favorites arena had a total height of 500 meters. Anyone could spar on the arenas at the bottom.

And above, there were even larger stages. There were twenty stages in total, all the way up to the height of five hundred meters in the sky.

The smallest of these stages had a radius of three kilometers. Even an expert at the profound void tier could fight on it.

However, there was an age limit to climbing onto the stage above.

The array could detect a person’s growth ring. Those with a growth ring of more than fifty were not allowed to step onto the stage.

Stepping onto the ring meant challenging a heaven’s favorite. One had to take out at least 500 drops of spiritual liquid or other treasures in order to have the right to challenge.

If the challenge was successful, the item would be returned and the reward would be obtained.

This was the rule.

“From now on, break through the Heaven’s favorite ranking!”

Wang Xian revealed a faint smile as he walked towards the Heaven’s favorite stage.

Although his attire was a little flirtatious, there were more people around the heaven’s pride stage who were dressed more flirtatiously than him.

Some people were riding on a mighty mount and held shiny weapons in their hands. Their aura was even more flirtatious than Wang Xian’s.

Walking around the Heaven’s pride stage, Wang Xian did not attract the attention of others.

He walked straight towards the Heaven’s pride stage. As he passed by one arena after another, there were cheers and cheers from the surroundings as well as the sounds of collisions and shouts.

He looked around and saw that all of them were young men below the half-step void interpretation stage. There were even very few of them who were at level nine of the extraordinaire.

He continued walking upwards. Soon, Wang Xian saw the first heaven’s pride stage. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Ranked 20th on the Heaven’s Pride Roll: Chen Lin of the blood sect

In front of the Heaven’s pride stage, there was a huge stone tablet with four names written on it.

The blood sect represented the blood stream sect. Chen Lin was ranked 20th on the Heaven’s pride roll.

When some prodigies became famous, they would bring along their sects, clans, or kingdoms. This was also an indirect form of publicity.

Buzz

“Divine Wind Academy’s Huang Tian is challenging the blood sect’s Chen Lin, ranked 20th on the prodigy roll!”

At this moment, the entire Heaven’s pride stage shook as a cold voice rang out.

Wang Xian was slightly taken aback as he looked over in astonishment.

“Someone is challenging a heaven’s pride expert again. Who Is this Huang Tian from the Divine Wind Academy?”

“Let’s go, let’s hurry over and take a look. There are so many battles on the Heaven’s pride stage these few days!”

“All the hidden geniuses have come out. They are trying to step onto the heaven’s Pride Bridge!”

Voices rang out one after another. Following that, Wang Xian saw many people flying towards the blood sect. Chen Lin’s arena.

That was the arena belonging to the 20th-ranked heaven’s favorites. They came to the front of the arena, threw a drop of spiritual liquid into it and entered the arena directly.

“Has someone already challenged me? He’s one step faster than me!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. With a move of his body, he flew directly to the front of the Heaven’s favorites arena.

To enter and watch the Heaven’s favorites competition, one had to pay a fee of one drop of spiritual liquid.

However, Wang Xian possessed the divine ability, shadow and light (also known as no formation) . He could ignore the formation and enter directly.

When Wang Xian flew in, he saw two young men standing at the front desk.

A young man dressed in blood-red clothes was holding a large saber in his hand. His gaze was cold as he stared in front of him.

He was Chen Lin from the blood stream sect, who was currently ranked 20th on the Heaven’s favorites ranking.

In front of him was a black-clothed young man with two large words, divine wind, engraved on his back.

He was the Prodigy challenger, Divine Wind Academy’s Huang Tian.

The Blood Stream sect and Divine Wind Academy were both powerful forces that could rival the Radiant Dragon Dynasty. They were both top-tier forces.

“A nobody from divine wind academy still wants to challenge me. He’s really courting death!”

In front of the arena, Chen Lin stared coldly at the challenger, Huang Tian, and said coldly.

“Haha, You Really Take Yourself seriously. Our senior Huang Tian is the top genius of the academy. After entering seclusion for a year, there really is no tiger or monkey in the mountain that can claim to be the King!”

“That’s right. With our senior Huang Tian’s strength, you’re merely a small start, yet you still dare to speak arrogantly!”

Opposite Chen Lin, Huang Tian, who was wearing the divine wind academy’s clothes, did not speak. He placed his hands behind his back and stared arrogantly at Chen Lin.

Behind him, more than twenty students of the Divine Wind Academy followed behind him and directly mocked Chen Lin.

“Arrogant, arrogant. Do you really think that bullshit Huang Tian is a match for our senior Chen Lin!”

“Senior Chen Lin, kill him, kill him!”

In the surroundings, some disciples of the blood stream sect heard the words of the Divine Wind Academy and Roared angrily.

The Blood Stream sect and the divine wind academy had always had some friction, and it was even more so on the prodigy stage.

“Haha, Little Disciple of the blood stream sect, I can defeat you within ten moves!”

Huang Tian heard the voices around him and a trace of coldness flashed across his eyes. He laughed loudly and directly flew onto the arena.

“Come here and Die!”

Standing in the middle of the stage, Huang Tian stared at Chen Lin arrogantly. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly as he stretched out a hand and curled it in a provocative manner.

“You’re courting death!”

Chen Lin’s eyes were filled with killing intent. His body moved and he directly flew to the middle of the stage, facing Huang Tian from afar.

“Make your move. You’re just a bunch of small factions. I want to climb higher mountains. Don’t waste my time!”

Huang Tian’s hands were still behind his back as he spoke to Chen Lin with contempt.

“Fine, fine. I’ll let you know the consequences of challenging me!”
