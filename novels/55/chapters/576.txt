Chapter 577: Collaboration

“Let me be clear, you cheapskate Master. This is a collaboration between you and my family. On account of us boosting your sales so much by referring customers to you yesterday, you mustn’t act like such a cheapskate towards us anymore!” Mu Wanbai told Wang Xian as she came to his side while pointing at him.

“If my business scale becomes really prominent, I’ll make sure to benefit your family greatly!” Wang Xian answered with glee as he looked at Mu Wanbai.

Speaking of which, Mu Wanbai and Piao Lingxue were his lucky stars. Had it not been for the two of them, he would not be enjoying such brisk business right now.

“Alright, since you’ve said so. Haha!”

Mu Wanbai nodded with much satisfaction upon hearing Wang Xian’s promise.

“It’s a small shop I have with no space to sit around. Nonetheless, please go on Senior!” Wang Xian said to the old man without any hesitation as he smiled at the latter and took over the box from his hands.

Seeing that Wang Xian had accepted the present from him, the old man broke into an even wider smile. “The Mu Family would like to have a batch of Spiritual Equipment and Elixir Pills refined!” the old man exclaimed.

“A batch?” Wang Xian asked.

“How much are we looking at?” he continued while his heart fluttered. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Two hundred portions of materials for Level 10 Spiritual Equipment, twenty for Level 11, two hundred for Level 5 Elixir Pills and forty for Level 6 Elixir Pills!” the old man replied.

“In the near future, the Spiritual Equipment from the Yong Chang Cauldron will no longer be of prominent use when its cauldron world descends into the real world. What’s more, the other cauldron worlds will soon follow and descend. Hence some of the resources will have to convert into physical ones!” the old man continued.

“Is that so?” Wang Xian questioned following the old man’s words. His heart skipped a beat.

“How much longer will it be before the Yong Chang cauldron world descends into the real world?” he asked in succession.

“Two years at most, if not one. Could be even shorter otherwise!” the old man said to Wang Xian while the latter listened with a darkened expression.

“As of now, I still don’t know your name, Master. May I know which Immortal Sect you are a disciple of?” the old man asked Wang Xian out of curiosity upon seeing the change in his expression.

“I’m Wang Xian, from the Da Hong Immortal Sect!”

Wang Xian responded upfront for he had no means to hide the facts anyway.

“What? Wang Xian of the Da Hong Immortal Sect?”

Just then, a gasp came from Mu Wanbai as she asked in utter surprise. Even Piao Lingxue looked towards Wang Xian in complete bewilderment.

“So you’re Wang Xian, Dragon King Wang Xian from Mt. Fengyu!” Mu Wanbai exclaimed loudly as she stared intently at Wang Xian with her jaw lowered.

To which, Wang Xian looked back at Mu Wanbai before nodding his head.

“Oh? Is he a renowned Master?” the old man quizzed as he looked at his granddaughter, stunned.

“Dragon King Wang Xian from Mt. Fengyu, who rose to sudden fame. The one who broke through eight mountain sects single-handedly within a day, and helped to bring Mt. Fengyu up to eleventh placing from nineteenth. Also, the one to defeat Kong Guanglin with a single strike on the very same day. Despite your current placing as the twentieth amongst all disciples within the Da Hong Immortal Sect, many are of the opinion that you actually possess the capabilities to come within the top ten. To think that you turned out to be the Dragon King! Rumor has it that the Dragon King’s known for being obnoxious, but it appears that you’re something of a cheapskate from what I see!”

Mu Wanbai shrieked as she fixed her gaze on Wang Xian.

“Is that so? Well, that’s something I wasn’t aware of!” Wang Xian responded with a faint smile.

“A disciple of Mt. Fengyu. To think that this Master here is also a member of our Da Hong Immortal Sect!”

The old man chimed in while assessing Wang Xian with bouts of curiosity, scrutinizing him from top to bottom.

Everyone from the Mu Family was also a disciple of the Da Hong Immortal Sect, many of whom were amongst the higher management.

“Given your prowess, Master, you’re more than qualified to become an Elder of the Da Hong Immortal Sect!” The old man opined as he slipped into deep thought.

“An Elder?” Wang Xian uttered in mild surprise. Becoming an Elder of the Da Hong Immortal Sect was something which had not crossed his mind before.

“There’s only five within the entire Da Hong Immortal Sect who are blacksmith masters or alchemy masters. Yet, you’re both, Master Wang Xian. Becoming an Elder would be such a breeze for you!” the old man explained to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian gave it a brief thought before dismissing the idea altogether almost immediately.

Becoming an Elder of the Da Hong Immortal Sect would mean having to come across Immortal-class figures.

To have such an existence paying attention to oneself, and checking up on one’s background, would only result in complications very easily.

Hence, it was best to avoid gaining the attention of such figures for the time being.

“Let’s not focus on the other worlds for now. Given that the Mu Family would like to have so much Spiritual Equipment and Elixir Pills refined, the amount of materials that we’re looking at ...” Wang Xian trailed off while looking at the old man.

The old man commented no further when he heard Wang Xian changing the topic.

Presently, the Da Hong Immortal Sect, Yong Chang Immortal Sect, and Immortal Slaying Sect were very much at ease.

Given the millennium of peace enjoyed, many of the higher management figures within the Immortal Sects had come to establish their own clans, while even more had come to place their own clans as the top priority while relegating the Immortal Sect to second.

Their various Immortal-class figures paid no heed to such a situation despite their awareness.

Even though the senior management each had their own clans outside of the Immortal Sects, the clans would have to be dismissed and be fully integrated into the Immortal Sects upon the order from an Expert amongst the Immortal-class figures.

For the Immortal-class figures, such was the prowess and terror they possessed along with their authority.

“Based on the account from the young lass of my family, I’ve come to hear of your prowess in the refinement of Equipment and Elixir Pills, Master. Hence, should it be alright with you, we’ll have two portions of the materials for the refining of Equipment prepared. We’ll also have twice the amount of Spiritual Grasses needed ready. What do you say?”

The old man proposed his idea to Wang Xian.

While the Mu Family did not have their own blacksmith, they did have their own alchemist, who also happened to be a master of the trade.

Their alchemist master could only guarantee a success rate of thirty-percent for the refinement of Level 5 Elixir Pills, and forty-percent for those at Level 6!

Should Wang Xian be the one to do the refining, the results would no doubt turn out much better.

“Sure!” Wang Xian nodded after a brief hesitation.

“Alright then. Tomorrow, we’ll have the materials brought over.” The old man brightened up with glistening eyes.

After a slight moment of hesitation, he continued, “Master, should we be able to increase our future orders of Spiritual Equipment and Elixir Pills, can we still stick to the current rates?”

“Sure!” Wang Xian consented.

“Haha, how easy-going and decisive you are, Master. Here’s to our amiable collaboration! Amiable Collaboration it is!” the old man sang excitedly before extending a handshake to Wang Xian.

“Cheers to an amiable collaboration!” Wang Xian nodded with a wide grin.

“Then we’ll disturb you no further. We’ll have the materials sent over tomorrow. Thank you for taking the trouble then, Master!”

The old man smiled radiantly.

“Sure!” Wang Xian nodded in response.

“We’ll take our leave!” The old man signaled while waving his hand. He then made his way out with Mu Wanbai and company following behind him.

“Little did I expect this cheapskate to be so easy-going today!” Mu Wanbai chimed cheerfully as she emerged from the shop.

“We’ve made a huge profit through this collaboration!” another old man in the company finally blurted out with eagerness. He had remained silent throughout earlier.

“I’ve helped our family to save a lot of materials. So what do you say, second Grandpa, shouldn’t you reward me for that!?”

Mu Wanbai spoke with glee, as her eyes squinted into two crescents.

“Haha! Yes indeed. I’ll be sure to reward you handsomely, little lass. To think it only costs us two portions of Spiritual Grasses, two portions of Spiritual Grasses! When we’re back, be sure to contact the other clans. Inform them that we can offer four Elixir Pills with three portions of material as the price. By then, I’m sure many of the clans will come over while we refer the refining work over to this Master thereafter and earn the additional portion of materials. Haha, who knows, we might just strike it rich through this opportunity!” The old man laughed in joy while the other also gleamed with uncontrollable exhilaration.

To the Mu Family, it was a huge profit gained for them this time!

Upon hearing the words from the second grandpa, Mu Wanbai stood dazed for a moment before returning to her senses. This... what a sly wily fox he is!

“What a huge gain!”

Meanwhile, Wang Xian was also cheering in the shop with equal elation.
