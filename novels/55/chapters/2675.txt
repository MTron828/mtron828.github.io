2676 2676 Demon Island Alliance

In these seven days, last month the Great Church had made all the preparations.

They had prepared all the escape routes.

Moreover, in these few days they also received other news about the demon island.

The current Demon Island, the Northern line and the eastern direction, was the main place for the invasion of the Abyss.

In the east, the two great religions were guarding it.

Now that the Northern line was lost, the Abyss on the Northern line could expand to the central area of the Demon Island.

Next, the entire Demon Island would be threatened by the Abyss. Even the great religion in the central area had to organize the upcoming confrontation.

“The entire demon island has realized the seriousness of the problem. Now, two-fifths of the Demon Island has been swallowed by the Abyss. The other three great religions intend to establish an alliance to resist the abyss together.”

An ancestor from the great religions said slowly last month.

“The expansion of the Abyss this time will be a catastrophe for the entire imperial star field. Even the imperial court is prepared to fight!”

Another ancestor sighed slightly.

“Is the imperial court about to start fighting?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows.

“Yes, the army from the imperial court has started to move. Someone in the AI said that an abyss seed at the level of void God Emperor has appeared at the entrance of the Abyss.”

That old ancestor nodded his head.

“Dragon King, we will head to the center of the Demon Island next. Your Dragon Palace?”

The sect master looked at Wang Xian last month and asked tentatively.

“Our Dragon Palace will not join the Alliance of the Demon Island. We will still be free to hunt the abyss seed.”

Wang Xian said directly.

“Then, we will thank you, Dragon King.”

When they heard Wang Xian’s words again, they were not as displeased as before. On the contrary, they were slightly excited.

The Dragon Palace had said the same thing the last time. However, after this battle, the Dragon Palace had sent out the most experts. They were all relying on the Dragon Palace.

They also understood that unless the dragon palace encountered an irresistible opponent, they would not escape directly.

“There’s no need. Are we preparing to head to the center of the Demon Island Now?”

Wang Xian shook his head and asked.

“Yes, Dragon King. Let’s head there now. We can reach it in ten days!”

The chief of last month nodded his head.

Their planet had a teleportation formation that could directly reach the central region. However, the teleportation formation could not teleport the planet.

This time, it could be said to be a major migration of the northern front.

Wang Xian nodded his head. After looking over here, he turned around and flew towards the inviting Moon Planet.

The Dragon Palace could not withstand this abyss at the moment.

However, even if the heaven array was upgraded to the peak of the Immortal King Realm, Wang Xian did not dare to guard this place rashly and kill the abyss seeds.

After all, two peak of the Immortal King Realm Abyss Seeds had appeared last time. If more than ten of them appeared directly, the Dragon Palace would have to die inside.

It was safer to follow the Demon Island’s main force.

At the very least, the Dragon Palace would be able to escape the moment they encountered an irresistible existence.

That was because there were some who were slower than them..

After returning to the inviting Moon planet, the nearby 400-odd planets continued to head east. They were traveling in the vast void space of the universe.

Wang Xian returned to the main Dragon Palace and waited for the advancement of the members of the Dragon Palace.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

Five days later, Wang Xian, who was bored out of his mind, received a video call from the Imperial Star Lady.

He was slightly stunned and a smile appeared on his face.

“Star Lady Beauty, you are out of the secret realm?”

He said with a smile.

“Hehe, I just came out. The first thing I did was to contact you. I have already advanced to the Immortal King Stage!”

“Congratulations! Congratulations!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Oh right, handsome Wang Xian, I have a favor to ask of you.”

The Imperial Star Lady cupped her fists and asked.

“What made you have such a good attitude?”

Wang Xian smiled when he saw her like this. He raised his eyebrows and asked.

“There is going to be a war in the imperial court. All the strong ones will enter the battlefield. We, the younger generation of disciples, will also enter the battlefield.”

“Entering the battlefield to hunt abyssal seeds, you will be able to obtain the imperial court’s Meritorious Service, and the meritorious service can be exchanged for treasures. The core disciples of our generation have to lead their respective forces to establish meritorious service, and the meritorious service will also be rewarded by the former.”

“Hehe, see if you can send some of your subordinates over to help me. Of course, I Won’t let you help me for free. If I receive the reward, we’ll split it fifty-fifty.”

...

Di Xingnu said with a twinkle in her eyes.

“I’m not short of your reward. Besides, I’ve said before that your power is the Dragon Palace. Alright, I’ll send my men over to your place in a few days. Is that Alright?”

Wang Xian agreed immediately.

“Wang Xian, you’re too kind. There’s no rush. We won’t set off until ten days later.”

Di Xingnu nodded immediately.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and hung up after chatting for a while.

He still had a good impression of the Empress Star. From the beginning when he used her as bait until now.

Over the past few years, their relationship was very good.

Even if he had to disregard the fact that she did not save Qingyue Lingxiu, Wang Xian would still help her.

Perhaps this was...

...

“It’s enough to send one immortal king level eight powerhouse and a few level seven powerhouses to follow her.”

Wang Xian mumbled.

After the upgrade of the Dragon Palace, there were many powerhouses. Sending a few would not affect the dragon palace.

Boom

At this moment, a powerful pressure came from the location of the Dragon Transformation Pool.

His eyes lit up and he immediately stood up and went into the dragon transformation pool.

At this moment, in front of the dragon transformation pool, there was a sky array with a water element dragon head and eight dragon heads and arms suspended in the air.

A powerful aura burst out from his body.

The sky array that had a strange appearance appeared extremely terrifying at this moment. It was like an ancient dragon demon. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Dragon King, I have made a breakthrough!”

The sky array opened its eyes and looked at Wang Xian. It flew over excitedly.

It was one step closer to regaining its peak strength.

“Haha, Very Good. With you around, the strength of the Dragon Palace has also increased a lot.”

“In the entire imperial star field, other than the imperial court, there is no other force that we can fear.”

Wang Xian sized up the heaven array that was emitting a chaotic aura and smiled.

The strongest experts of the major sects in the Imperial Star Field were only at level nine and peak king of God level. The powerful major sects only had a handful of peak king of God level existences.

After the Heaven Array was set up, it was enough to contend against them!

“There might be another big battle coming up. Let’s work hard for the next few days!”

Wang Xian continued.

“It’s good to have a big battle. With a big battle, we can improve quickly!”

The Heaven Array stroked his dragon whiskers. A strong fighting spirit flashed in his eyes.

“Dragon King, I’ll go to the Dragon Peak first to carry out the modification and upgrade it to its peak.”

As he spoke, he bowed to Wang Xian.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and looked into the dragon transformation pool.

Over there, the last batch of disciples from the Dragon Palace was about to be upgraded!
