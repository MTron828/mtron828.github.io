Chapter 510: I’m Annihilating The Devils (1)

“Dragon King, we will be passing by the Abyss on our way back. Should we head over with the dragonians?”

On the way back, Wang Xian and the group called for a bus to send them back to Rivertown. When they were on the roads, Mo Yuan asked this.

“Oh? The base of the Abyss?” Wang Xian was baffled. “The base of the Abyss is in the city ahead?”

“Yeah. Ling City, a relatively famous city in the Underworld!” Mo Yuan nodded his head as he answered Wang Xian.

“A famous city?” Wang Xian was a little confused.

“Yeah. Ling City is just beside the Fateless Forest. There are lots of martial artists in the entire Ling City. Moreover, many wanted martial artists seek refuge in Ling City!”

“There’s another more commonly known name of Ling City and that’s Ghost City. In it, there’s a huge area where everyone has left and no one is residing.”

Mo Yuan explained to Wang Xian. “It’s a chaotic place and the base of the Abyss is built right there. Moreover, they have established a rather good information department. These information agents are all outlaws recruited within Ling City!”

“Ling City? I have not heard of it. Since we are passing by, let’s go and take a look!” Wang Xian nodded his head and instructed Mo Yuan.

“Yes!” Mo Yuan nodded his head and went to direct the driver towards Ling City.

After entering Ling City, Wang Xian realized that it was more of a larger county than a city.

The roads of the entire city were a little cramped. There were also more houses and it was a little more chaotic as compared to Rivertown.

“Dragon King, we are here!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

When the car arrived at the city center of Ling City, Mo Yuan turned around and informed Wang Xian.

“Located in the city center?” Wang Xian alighted and observed the surroundings while he asked.

“This base wasn’t built by Long Qi and the rest. They took over an assassination group and built it into the base of the Abyss!” Mo Yuan explained as he led Wang Xian towards a shop ahead.

“Ling Yue Bar!”

Wang Xian lifted his head and saw the name of the shop. He smiled and entered it.

It was roughly 5 pm and the bar hadn’t opened for business.

Mo Yuan took out his phone and informed Long Qi and the rest.

“Dragon King!”

Soon, seven dragonians opened the door and greeted Wang Xian respectfully.

“Dragon King, please follow us!”

Once they were in the bar, Wang Xian noticed some of the employees were already working.

These employees were all ordinary people of both genders.

They looked curiously at Wang Xian and the group.

“Dragon King! We usually enter through Gate 2 and rarely enter through this gate!”

Long Qi said to Wang Xian in a solemn tone.

“Are there any other entrances?”Wang Xian replied with a laugh.

“Five of them!” Long Qi answered and led them to an office.

Soon after, Long Qi activated a switch and a tunnel leading underground appeared.

“This is just one of the entrances. There are four other entrances!” As Long Qi spoke, he led them down the tunnel.

After walking for approximately a thousand meters, a huge underground space appeared before Wang Xian’s eyes.

“This was the base of a first-class assassin group in the Underworld in the past. It’s extremely well hidden. Unless someone is part of the assassin group, it would be hard for them to enter!” Long Qi explained to Wang Xian.

“This is a pretty huge place. It’s almost half the size of the Dark Conjurers’ base!”

Wang Xian looked around him in shock. Not many people were in the underground space.

Other than the seven dragonians, the rest were all information agents.

Information gathering was an important aspect of an assassin group.

An assassin group without any information would basically be operating with both of their eyes closed. Even if they received a mission, it would take a huge amount of time to complete it.

The entire Abyss’ base had twenty-odd information agents processing information gathered from various places.

“For the near future, gather all information on Dong Hua Sacred Sect!” Wang Xian looked around and instructed them.

“The information on Dong Hua Sacred Sect might be a little troublesome. They are too strong and it would be hard for us to get!” Long Qi frowned slightly and continued, “However, we can buy information.”

“Buy information?”

“Yeah. Omniscient Group is an organization that specializes in selling intelligence. As long as you can afford it, any information can be bought. However, they charge exorbitant fees!” Long Qi nodded his head as he explained.

“Omniscient Group!”

Wang Xian knew about the Omniscient group. In the past, they had published information on him.

The Omniscient group knew everything within heaven and earth.

This was the strongest information organization in the Underworld. When it came to the news on the Underworld, there was nothing the Omniscient Group didn’t know.

One could tell how incredibly strong the Omniscient Group was.

“The Omniscient Group is also in this city!” Long Qi suddenly interrupted.

“Huh? Their base is here too?” Wang Xian was taken aback and shocked.

“We got to know this by accident. Shenling Information Technology Private Limited! That should be the nest of the Omniscient Group!” Long Qi added.

“Is it?”

“I’m seventy percent sure. There were a few times we overheard their informers exchanging information in our bar. They are really, really secretive!”

Long Qi continued, “Furthermore, other than the Omniscient Group, the base of Remains from Diabolism is also located within the Fateless Forest a short distance away. They have many disciples who are active in this place. Over the last few days, the number of martial artists in Ling City has been dropping rapidly!”

“Omniscient Group and the Remains are here! How interesting! Could it be that the Omniscient Group and Remains are not aware of our existence here?”

Wang Xian was a little curious. The Omniscient Group was the best in gathering information. They shouldn’t be unaware of things that were happening so close to them.

“Dragon King, there’s a good chance they don’t know about it. Our Abyss has only been established for a short period. Moreover, the missions we have accepted are less than ten thus far. Naturally, as we accept more missions, the Omniscient Group will likely notice us with their incredible network!” explained Long Qi.

Wang Xian nodded his head. That was reasonable. Although the Omniscient Group was incredible, it was impossible for it to know everything in the Underworld.

Since the establishment of the Abyss, it was now ranked on the top of the assassin group chart in the Underworld. However, they had only been established for just a few months.

Moreover, the Abyss was only made up of seven people and had accepted a small number of missions.

“Interesting. If we could gain control of the Omniscient Group, everything would be easier!”

Wang Xian hesitated. After walking around the base of the Abyss, he started pondering.

When he walked out of the base of the Abyss, it was already past 6 pm. Wang Xian had no intention to return today and thus headed in the direction Long Qi had told him about.

Shenling Information Technology Private Limited was a high-tech company.

With regard to this company, Wang Xian had heard of it. It was one of the top five hundred companies in the world and was among the most elite tier in the aspect of computer information.

Besides that, Shenling Information Technology Private Limited also had its own satellite.
