“Brother!”

In the morning, Wang Xian suddenly received a call from Xiao Yu when he arrived at the first-grade pavilion that had been renovated.

“Eh? What’s wrong? Are you coming back this afternoon or tomorrow morning?”

Wang Xian asked with a smile.

“Eh, I’m injured!”

Xiao Yu’s slightly weak voice was heard.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian was stunned. A hint of coldness flashed in his eyes. “I’ll be there right away!”

“Brother, don’t come over. I’m calling you now. My injuries aren’t too serious. I’ll be fine in a few days. However, three of the strange demons might have died!”

Xiao Yu said to Wang Xian with a bitter expression.

“Just wait for me there!”

Wang Xian took a deep breath and said to Xiao Yu.

“Brother, I said it’s fine. I’m not young anymore. I Can’t let you come whenever something happens!”

Xiao Yu said to him.

“Forget it, forget it. I’ll let ao Jian Mo Qinglong and the rest go over!”

Wang Xian nodded. After chatting with him for a while, he hung up the phone!

“My younger sister has grown up. Hehe!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly. Following that, his expression darkened as he looked at Mo Qinglong.

“Bring all the Ao jian ao demons and all the disciples of the Dragon Gate. Those who have already left, get them to head to the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect. Contact Elder fan when the time comes and let me know!”

“This is a piece of soul-returning wood. Give it to the demonic beasts and see if you can revive the three demonic beasts that died. Head over immediately!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Mo Qinglong replied immediately. His body moved and he flew into the distance immediately.

“As long as I can protect him for as long as possible!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly and walked towards the villa.

At this moment, a shadow flashed across the sky above the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect. It was almost as if he had teleported.

The shadow landed at the Medicine Peak and entered it directly.

“Sect leader!”

When the crowd saw the middle-aged man’s figure, they immediately called out respectfully.

“En!”

The middle-aged man’s face darkened as his gaze swept over and landed on Feng Lingtian.

“Hey, are you stupid? What are you standing here for?”

Feng Lingtian stood beside Xiao Yu’s bed with his head lowered, thinking about something.

Xiao Yu could not help but call out to him.

“Ling Tian!”

The middle-aged man shouted at his son and walked over.

“Father!”

Feng Lingtian turned his head and revealed a self-mocking smile, “Father, come and see Xiao Yu. See if you can treat her quickly!”

The middle-aged man was stunned when he saw his son’s expression. He then turned to look at Xiao Yu and nodded. He then took out a medicinal pill from his interspatial ring.

“Level eight healing medicine. The injuries on her body can be completely healed in two days!”

The middle-aged man said and handed it to Elder fan.

Elder fan looked at it and directly put it into Xiao Yu’s mouth.

“I have a simple understanding of the matter. Thank you for saving my son. Thank you!”

The middle-aged man looked at Xiao Yu and thanked him.

“Father, I’m Useless!”

Feng Lingtian said with an ugly expression.

“If you’re useless, then cultivate well!”

The middle-aged man patted his shoulder and said, “Father will avenge you for this!”

“I Will!”

Feng Lingtian clenched his fists and looked at Xiao Yu. He said with determination, “Don’t worry, I’ll let you protect me this time. I’ll protect you in the future!”

“Just you, cultivate for eight lifetimes!”

Xiao Yu said with a smile.

Feng Lingtian was stifled by her words and gritted his teeth, “Just you wait!”

“Sect leader, where did the chaos origin immortal sect get the guts to attack Ling Tian!”

Elder Ming walked to the side of the middle-aged man and asked with a serious expression.

“I met Jin Gujia today. He has already broken through to the middle-stage immortal realm. It must be because I killed his son that he would spare no expense to kill Ling Tian!”

As the middle-aged man spoke, his eyes flashed with killing intent, “However, since they dare to attack, we will accompany them to the end. Establish an assassination team and kill them for me!”

“The strength of our Yellow Heaven Immortal sect’s disciples far surpasses that of his chaos origin immortal sect. Since they dare to kill Ling Tian, they must be prepared to die!”

“It’s the sect leader. I will be in charge of the assassination team!”

Elder Feng’s expression was solemn as he said, “So what if the golden ancient Jia has broken through to the middle immortal realm? Right now, we are competing in the strength of the disciples of the immortal sect. Since they dare to touch us, they will have to bear the consequences of our Crazy Revenge!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Alright!”The middle-aged man nodded his head slowly.

Elder Feng immediately went out to prepare.

The middle-aged man looked at his son and then at Xiao Yu who was lying on the bed. A faint smile appeared on his face.

When his eyes fell on the strange creature lying on the bed next to him, a look of surprise appeared in his eyes.

The great elder of the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect walked over and reported the situation one by one.

Not long after, elder fan received a call from Mo Qinglong.

“Sect master Feng, brother Xiao Yu has sent someone over. I’ll go and pick him up. I’ll have to Trouble Your Immortal sect to pass through!”

Elder fan said to the middle-aged man.

“Okay!”

The middle-aged man nodded.

“Miss Fan, I’ll go with you!”

The great elder of the Yellow Heaven Immortal Sect, who was holding a cane, said to elder fan.

“Okay!”

Elder fan nodded and flew out.

At the entrance of the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect, a group of Yellow Heaven Immortal sect disciples stared at the group of people in front of them vigilantly.

More than 80 Drakonids followed a Jiaya and Tang Yinxuan out of 30 people. The other 50 Drakonids had all arrived.

In addition, Ao Jian and the eight strange demons who were hidden in the air.

And Ao Jian!

The bodies of these people contained terrifying energy, making the disciples of the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect full of vigilance!

“Eh?”

The great elder of the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect swept his gaze across the crowd with a face full of shock.

“Ao Jian, come with me!”

Elder fan said to them.

“Yes!”

Ao jian nodded and followed elder fan towards Yao Feng.

As soon as he stepped into the room, the middle-aged man instantly turned his head and stared at Ao Jian. His eyes flickered.

“Eldest Princess!”

Ao Jian walked to Xiao Yu’s side and called out respectfully.

“Eldest Princess!”

At this moment, ao Yao did not hide his figure. A white figure slowly appeared and called out.

When the middle-aged man saw ao Yao appear out of thin air, his expression changed drastically. A trace of shock flashed across his eyes.

“Yes, Ao Yao, go and take a look at your subordinates!”

Xiao Yu squeezed out a smile and said to Ao Yao.

“It’s the eldest princess!”

Ao Yao nodded and moved to the side of the strange demon.

“Leader!”

The strange demon shouted in a low voice.

“Take me to the other three places of Death!”

The strange demon said indifferently.

“Yes!”

Ao Yao helped the strange demon up, and the two figures disappeared into thin air.

“Two immortal gods, and one of them has a terrifying concealing ability!”

A trace of shock flashed through the middle-aged man’s eyes, and his gaze swept towards the position of the door, and the shock in his eyes became even greater.

Over fifty infant realm experts!

The girl’s elder brother directly sent over a terrifying force that was comparable to their immortal sect!
