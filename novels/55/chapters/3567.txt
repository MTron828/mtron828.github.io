3568 Among the 3567 heaven-destroying demonic beasts

“Damn it!”

The group of Level 3 universe masters of the heaven-destroying demonic beasts stared at the group of experts from the Dragon Palace in shock!

When they saw the dozen or so level 3 universe masters of the Dragon Palace, their expressions were abnormally ugly!

The Dragon Palace had already arrived at their lair, yet they didn’t even notice it!

“Kill!”

Wang Xian continued to lock onto the leader of the sky-planting demonic beast and shouted coldly!

The power of wind and thunder on the incipient Saint Wings burst out!

“Attack! This is the territory of the sky-planting demonic beast. With our strength, we can totally withstand it!”

When the leader of the sky-planting demonic beast saw Wang Xian charging at him again, his face was filled with vigilance!

He roared loudly and a branch extended out from his body!

On this branch, there was an incomparably resplendent leaf of the tree of light!

This leaf contained a terrifying power!

In the eyes of the leader of the sky-planting demonic beast, the instant kill earlier was caused by a sneak attack!

Now that he had taken out his innate supreme treasure and was in his complete form, even if he wasn’t a match for the Dragon King, he could still spar with him!

The resplendent leaf emitted a luster and dense leaves of the tree of light appeared around him in an instant!

These bright leaves attacked Wang Xian directly!

Even though Wang Xian was very fast, he was still able to lock onto them!

“Dragon King, leave it to me!”

However, the leader of the sky-planting demonic beast tribe thought that everything was too simple!

The water-touching King, who was on Wang Xian’s shoulder, started to move and welcomed the bright leaves of the innate treasure!

Splash

Her entire body turned into a ball of seawater and wrapped around the leaves!

The seawater completely wrapped around the leaves of the tree of light!

Wang Xian’s speed continued to attack the Chief of the sky-planting Demonic Beast tribe!

“What!”

The Chief of the sky-planting demonic beast tribe was slightly stunned when he saw his innate treasure being completely blocked by a demonic beast!

He quickly waved the branches on his body to resist!

However, the attack of the water touch king was not blocked. Instead, it covered the branch!

“What the Hell Is This?”

When the leader of the Sky Plant Demonic Beast saw this terrifying attack, his expression changed drastically. He couldn’t help but Roar in horror!

Buzz

At this moment, the five elements millstone flew out from Wang Xian’s body and directly covered the Sky Plant Demonic Beast Leader’s body!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The five elements millstone enlarged and completely covered him. On top of it, the five divine dragons let out furious roars! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Not good!”

Feeling this terrifying pressure, the sky plant chief’s face changed drastically. His eyes were filled with fear!

This five elements Millstone gave him a threat of death!

“Crash!”

At this moment, Wang Xian rushed in front of him again. His arm turned into a dragon claw.

The huge Dragon Claw attacked his body.

“Get lost!”

The leader of the Sky Plant Demonic Beast’s face changed drastically. With a ferocious expression, he roared and countless branches covered Wang Xian!

The branches attacked Wang Xian one by one. Around Wang Xian, the Taiji Dragon disc appeared!

The Taiji Dragon Disc spun and the branches landed on it. The Taiji Dragon Disc did not move at all!

On the contrary, a terrifying backlash force caused the branches to wither rapidly!

“Ah!”

A pained roar came from the leader of the Tianzhi Demonic Beast!

Wang Xian’s dragon claws landed on the main body of the leader of the Tianzhi Demonic Beast and sank straight into it!

The destructive force of the five elements was eroding his life force!

“No, no!”

The leader of the Tianzhi Demonic Beast felt his body disappearing and roared in horror!

Instant Kill, another instant kill!

Earlier, he thought it was because he was taken by surprise!

This time, he was prepared for everything, but he was still killed in an instant!

His strength was not weak among the level three combat strength of the Masters of the universe!

Furthermore, he had an innate supreme treasure!

Yet he was still killed in an instant!

Just how strong was the Dragon King?

“Die!”

The energy from Wang Xian’s body surged into the chief’s body!

His body began to wither rapidly!

His life force was disappearing rapidly!

Soon, his life force was completely gone, leaving behind an incomparably huge corpse!

However, the moment the chief’s life force dissipated, he sensed that a seed had awakened in the deepest part of the waterfall not far away!

On this seed, there were traces of extremely weak wind and thunder energy!

This was the power of the inceptive holy wings to search for enemies in the void!

“Oh? There’s a life-saving method?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. However, this life-saving method only retained a sliver of hope of revival.

It wasn’t the kind of revival that could directly avoid a fatal blow!

“What!”

“Patriarch? Patriarch was killed again!”

“The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is very powerful. We Aren’t his match!”

At this moment, the remaining peak experts of the sky plant demonic beast clan trembled when they sensed that their patriarch was killed again!

Their patriarch was killed again!

He was killed again!

How could the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace be so powerful?

How could they defend against such power!

“Run!”

All the peak experts of the sky plant demonic beasts were prepared to run away!

The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace was too powerful!

“Buzz!”

However, at this moment, just as they were about to run away, the entire world started to change color!

Nine-colored auspicious clouds appeared in the sky above them. These auspicious clouds shone with some light and scattered across the space!

“Not good, they have magi, powerful Magi!”

Seeing the nine-colored auspicious clouds suddenly appear and sensing the changes in the surrounding space, their expressions changed drastically!

“Ah!”

Right at this moment, a miserable cry was heard.

This miserable cry caused the peak experts of the Sky Plant Demon Beast clan to tremble once again!

They hurriedly looked to the side!

At the side, a strange black and white figure penetrated one of their companions!

In front of their companion, there was a strange dragon species that was exuding a strange and confusing aura!

Her human body and dragon tail were filled with strangeness.

Her long wavy hair was abnormally beautiful, and her every action was soul-stirring.

She had black and red eyes, and when she looked into his eyes, she felt extremely strange.

This was the charm dragon!

The Charm Dragon was born from a unique and strange ancestral witch’s corpse in the Dragon Palace. This ancestral witch was called the creator by the female snake that was saved by Wang Xian!

Later on, 1,000 dolphins turned into the charm dragon!

Now, the Dragon Palace had 1,000 Charm Dragons, and the leader of the Charm Dragon had a black spider lily!

Standing in front of the Sky Plant Demon Beast was the leader of the Charm Dragon!

With the black spider lilies in hand, the succubus guardian Dragon worked together with Ao Yao and easily killed a level 3 master of the Universe!

“Eh? The Succubus is really powerful and strange on the battlefield. If I had known earlier, I would have improved her strength!”

Wang Xian looked over and mumbled!
