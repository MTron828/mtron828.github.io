Chapter 3927: 3926 void Dragon

Translator: 549690339

The Void Dragon Pearl was created a few eons ago by the previous generation of Heavenly Yuan Destiny realm experts of the Divine Dragon Clan.

Furthermore, it was created together with other heavenly yuan destiny realm experts..

However, it didn’t succeed.

Even if it failed, this void Dragon Pearl had always been kept in the Divine Dragon Clan’s treasury. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

It was kept as the most precious treasure.

The Divine Dragon Clan’s Last Heavenly Fate Water Divine Dragon believed that the reason why the Void Dragon Pearl couldn’t be cultivated was because it couldn’t give birth to life.

It couldn’t give birth to wisdom.

In fact, the heavenly fate experts had terrifying creative powers.

They could create a whole new race.

The reason why they didn’t succeed was because the creature they created was too powerful.

It was like how a powerhouse from the Heaven’s origin realm could easily create a high-level race.

However, it would be difficult for him to create a peak race.

He could at most create a few or even a dozen existences that were comparable to a divine dragon.

It would be difficult to create a large-scale one.

However, it would be even more difficult if they wanted to create a mutated divine dragon. It was impossible.

The Void Divine Dragon was an existence that the Heaven’s origin creator wanted to create.

However, it was a pity that it was not that easy to create a mutated divine dragon.

This was especially so for an existence where space was king.

Hence, it had never succeeded.

The previous generation of the Heaven’s origin creator Water Divine Dragon had guessed that the energy of the ancestral tree would allow the void dragon bead to be completely nurtured.

Of course, this was just a guess.

At this moment, Wang Xian looked at the scene in front of him with a hint of anticipation in his eyes.

A few heavenly water divine dragons had been created together. There were void divine dragons that had yet to be nurtured even after several eons.

Now, it seemed that they were about to be born!

In the dragon bead above, there was a tiny embryo of a divine dragon that was like a fossil. At this moment, it seemed to have a life of its own!

Crack! Crack

Slowly, cracks started to appear on the entire Dragon Pearl. The tiny divine dragon inside opened its mouth and ate all the energy in the Dragon Pearl!

Crack! Crack! Crack

Crack! Crack

As time passed, the tiny divine dragon crawled out of the Dragon Pearl. It opened its mouth and continued to devour the outer shell of the dragon pearl.

At this moment, Wang Xian suddenly had a vague feeling that surged into his heart.

“What is this feeling?”

Wang Xian’s mind stirred as he stared at the Divine Dragon.

The Divine Dragon stopped devouring and shook his head. Then, he looked at Wang Xian.

Then, he blinked his eyes and continued to devour.

Buzz Buzz

As the Divine Dragon devoured the entire dragon bead, his body size became about one meter.

He still looked extremely weak.

However, at this moment, some information appeared in Wang Xian’s mind. It was about the usage of some special energy.

With a thought, the tiny divine void dragon in front of him moved and instantly appeared in front of Wang Xian. It entered his body directly.

This divine void Dragon seemed to have no physical body.

“Indeed, it doesn’t have a physical body. It’s like a void dragon formed by the power of space. This void dragon is not an individual, but a part of my body. ”

Wang Xian mumbled.

Yes, this effective void Dragon had already become a part of his body.

In the void, everything was empty.

When the Divine Dragon entered Wang Xian’s body, Wang Xian felt that there was an additional amount of energy in his body.

He looked ahead and his body moved. In an instant, he appeared in front of him.

This distance was not very far. It was only about a kilometer away.

This was because the energy of the divine dragon in his body was too weak.

It was so weak that it couldn’t even reach the level of a god.

It was too weak!

Although it was weak, this void dragon possessed a terrifying ability to evolve.

This ability to evolve was even stronger than the mutated divine dragon.

The ability to control the power of space could be said to be the most unique mutated divine dragon in the Dragon Palace.

lie!

Wang Xian had a thought and called an lie over.

At the same time, he set up a demonic altar in one of his spots.

It was a pity that Wang Xian did not sense the existence of the demonic altar, even though it was very close to him.

“It seems that I only have the power of space, but I can’t teleport through this demonic altar. This should be an lie’s unique characteristic! ”

Wang Xian thought to himself.

An lie was a unique existence. He might be slightly different from the creatures of the void race!

In addition, he probably didn’t have the ability to ignore any defenses or barriers.

He only had the purest power of space.

Of course, when the Void Dragon reached a terrifying realm, he might be able to reach an lie’s level!

“Dragon King! ”

At this moment, an lie flew over and bowed to Wang Xian!

“Bring me to your void Pagoda! ” Wang Xian instructed him.

“It’s the Dragon King! ”

An lie nodded.

The Void Pagoda was a war treasure used by the royal family of the Void. It was also considered an extremely precious treasure to the royal family of the Void.

During the last war, it was left behind in the nine-origin universe.

The Void Pagoda contained an incomparably majestic spatial energy.

In this Void Pagoda, an Lie’s strength had risen to the level of a second-stage ruler after tens of millions of years!

This cultivation speed was not considered slow.

Of course, this was also because of the help of the heart of faith.

The heart of faith was also of great use to an lie in breaking through his shackles.

Wang Xian came to the Void Pagoda. With a thought, the body of the Void Dragon flew out from his body.

Wang Xian began to control his mind.

He shifted his mind to the body of the Void Dragon.

He sized up his body which was only about a meter long. He felt the surrounding space energy and tried to absorb it!

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

A large amount of space energy surged into his body. Wang Xian could feel that his body was improving rapidly.

The speed of improvement was extremely fast!

In just a few hours, Wang Xian felt that he had achieved a breakthrough.

With a move of his palm, a space dagger appeared in his hand.

He threw it into the distance and the space dagger instantly appeared a kilometer away in front of him.

The dagger did not fly over. Instead, it teleported over.

There was no time lag.

In other words, the arm did not fly out. Instead, it was teleported over.

It looked extremely strange and terrifying.

This was the power of space.

“It’s really powerful! ”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. He was prepared to upgrade his void Dragon

Avatar.

This could not be said to be an avatar. This was because this void dragon was Wang Xian himself.

It was just that the Void Dragon did not have a physical body. Wang Xian’s actual body was a physical body.

In short, the Void Dragon was Wang Xian, and Wang Xian was also this void

Dragon..
