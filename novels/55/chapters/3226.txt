Chapter 3227: 3226 charged into the encirclement of Lu Xingkong

“Bang!”

A terrifying attack came. Wang Xian’s Dragon Claw grabbed the body of the grand elder of the horned seal race.

“Scram!”

When the grand elder of the horned seal race saw this situation, his expression changed drastically. He roared in horror and a huge golden hammer appeared in his hand.

“Buzz!”

“Ahhhhh!”

However, at the next moment, an extremely terrifying power of flames surged into his body.

Fire countered metal. The first Supreme Elder’s body turned red instantly and his body trembled.

“This is bad!”

“Not good, first Supreme Elder!”

“Attack him!”

The thousands of universe knights beside the first supreme elder of the horned seal race had a drastic change of expression when they saw this scene.

Their eyes revealed a look of horror.

There was actually someone who suddenly attacked from below.

This made their hearts tighten. They waved the weapons in their hands and slashed at Wang Xian.

“Hahaha, do you think you can destroy our Dragon Palace?”

Wang Xian laughed out loud. His figure flashed as he grabbed the body of the chief elder of the horned seal race and easily dodged their attack.

“No!”

At this moment, the chief elder of the horned seal race, who was about to collapse, let out a desperate scream.

Wang Xian waved his arm and put his body away.

“What! That’s the Dragon King, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!”

“Damn it, he actually killed the first Supreme Elder!”

“Lord Protector, Help!”

In just a split second, when they saw the first supreme elder being killed, the universe knights were shocked.

The first supreme elder of the horned seal race was a level 5 universe knight.

He was killed by the Dragon King in an instant.

How was this possible!

Didn’t the Dragon King only have the strength of a level four universe knight?

Could it be that he had broken through?

Everyone’s expression was abnormally ugly. The group of knights from the Horned Seal race hurriedly looked down for help.

Their Golden Dragon Knight Protector didn’t come out immediately because he was refining the acquired Supreme Treasure.

“It’s your turn now!”

A level five universe knight was killed. Wang Xian had nothing to worry about now.

The Five Elements Millstone appeared above his head. He flapped his primaless sacred wings and charged towards more than 1,000 universe knights.

“Attack him!”

Seeing Wang Xian’s attack, the Universe Knights from the three races in the sky showed a look of fear. They immediately released a terrifying energy that poured towards him.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

The five elements grinding mill spun above Wang Xian’s head. The attacks were easily blocked.

“Roar!”

Wang Xian let out a low roar and transformed into the body of a divine dragon. The incomparably huge dragon tail swept towards them.

“Not good, Dodge immediately!”

“Dodge, Dodge quickly!”

The terrifying dragon tail suddenly attacked, causing everyone to reveal a look of horror.

The terrifying aura on the dragon tail made them feel suffocated.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

More than a hundred universe knights couldn’t Dodge in time and were swept by Wang Xian’s dragon tail. Their bodies were sent flying backward, and their vitality was almost gone.

“He is very strong. We are not his match.”

An elder of the twin species shouted in shock as his expression changed drastically.

“Isn’t the Dragon King a level four universe knight? How did he suddenly become a level five? Furthermore, he is such a terrifying level five powerhouse?”

The Lady of the Serpentine race roared with bloodshot eyes.

“Hehe, with your strength, you still want to destroy our Dragon Palace?”

Wang Xian said disdainfully. He swayed his huge dragon body and charged towards them.

“Clang!”

“Dragon King, you’re courting death!”

At this moment, a terrifying attack came from below.

An incomparably resplendent crown was emitting a dazzling golden glow. The swords and sabers on it were crossed as they attacked Wang Xian directly.

“Bang!”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes slightly when he saw the acquired Supreme Treasure that was attacking him.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Without Wang Xian’s command and control, the five elements millstone in the sky let out a furious roar.

The entire five elements millstone spun and turned into a terrifying flame that smashed directly at the crown.

“Boom!”

An incomparably terrifying collision sound was heard. The crown that was at the level of an acquired supreme treasure fell directly downwards.

In this collision, the five elements millstone had the complete upper hand.

Of course, this was also the reason why this acquired Supreme Treasure had not been completely refined.

“What!”

Below, the figure of the Golden Dragon Knight appeared. When he saw that the crown had been knocked down, his expression changed drastically.

Even if this acquired supreme treasure had not been completely refined, he could still display some of its power.

However, he was actually at a disadvantage in the collision with the Dragon King’s treasure. This caused his pupils to constrict slightly.

“That’s it? I’ll Destroy You First!”

Wang Xian’s gaze locked onto the venerable Golden Dragon. He moved his body and extended his dragon claws to dive down.

His body was slowly emitting a terrifying power of flames.

The True Dragon’s dragon body could allow him to change the eight attributes in his body at will.

Under such circumstances, he could perfectly restrain his enemy.

“What speed and terrifying power. This Dragon King has broken through!”

Sensing the Dragon King who was charging at him, the expression of the venerable golden dragon changed drastically.

He could no longer sense the aura of the first Supreme Elder. In other words, the first supreme elder had been killed.

This made his heart sink slightly. A hint of panic appeared in his eyes.

“Scram!”

His body trembled. His entire body turned into a thousand meters in size. His long golden tail swept towards Wang Xian.

“HMPH!”

Wang Xian stretched out his dragon claw and clawed at his long golden tail.

“Bang!”

The Dragon Claw collided with the long golden tail. The five elements grinding mill landed on the dragon claw rapidly, and a surge of energy was added to it.

“Crack! Crack! Crack!”

The Dragon Claw grabbed the long tail. Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a cold expression as he flung it downwards.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The shrine below instantly collapsed.

Wang Xian swayed his body and appeared below the venerable Golden Dragon in the next second.

“What a terrifying speed!”

The descending venerable Golden Dragon sensed the dragon king below him and his expression changed drastically.

“Divine Crown Protection!”

He growled in a low voice. The acquired Supreme Treasure Crown was above his head as a wave of golden laws enveloped his body.

“It’s useless!”

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

Wang Xian looked at the venerable Golden Dragon who was enveloped by the golden glow. His dragon claws landed heavily on the crown.

“Roar!”

The five elements grinding on the fire god Dragon let out a roar. A terrifying pillar of fire shot out.

“Crack, crack, crack!”

The golden law surrounding him slowly cracked and collapsed.

“No, Dragon King, Stop!”

At this moment, the Venerable Golden Dragon revealed a look of fear in his eyes. He let out an involuntary roar.

“Peng!”

Wang Xian’s dragon claw penetrated the golden light defense and landed on his body. He clenched it tightly.

The Second Level 5 universe Knight of the Horned Seal race had died!

“Gulp!”

“This… this…”

In the sky, when the other knights of the three races saw Golden Dragon Knight being killed so quickly, their eyes revealed fear and despair.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m
