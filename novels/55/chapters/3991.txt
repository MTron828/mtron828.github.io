Since my main body can not enter, I have less of an advantage. Of course, there are only a few. An lie should be able to enter.”

“An lie should be able to bring people in as well!”

Wang Xian mumbled. His body moved and he continued flying forward!

He scanned his surroundings. The deeper he flew, the more war machines there were!

On those war machines, there were many corpses!

The energy of these corpses was not as terrifying as those at the peak of the

Universe Dominator realm, but they were not weak either.

They must be experts at the eighth or ninth level of the Universe Dominator realm. With the help of the war machines, they could unleash the destructive power of those at the peak of the Universe Dominator realm!

Wang Xian came to the side of a war machine and found that he could enter it.

He entered the depths of the war machine and did not find any treasures.

“Even if there are treasures in the war machine that can enter, they were taken away by the undeserved forbidden ground and flowing water forbidden ground in the past! ”

Wang Xian mumbled as he spoke.

His body moved and he flew towards a war machine that was like a spaceship.

On this spaceship, there were streams of energy enveloping it. Similarly, there were terrifying holes on it!

After he entered from one of the holes, he realized that there was an energy barrier in the depths of the spaceship.

He used his hand to sense that it was not something that he could break through.

At the very least, he needed to have the strength of a master at level nine.

“Even if there are treasures in this spaceship, it would be difficult to obtain them!”

Wang Xian thought to himself.

He estimated that even if there were opportunities and treasures in this spaceship, it would be dangerous and difficult to obtain them.

Otherwise, why would he leave it for them?

With this thought in mind, he moved his body and continued to investigate the surroundings.

C’ HA”IM?”

When Wang Xian continued to fly forward, he was slightly stunned when he saw a dilapidated building.

“This is… The Kingdom of God? There is actually a kingdom of God Here?”

Wang Xian looked at the huge building and was slightly shocked. A hint of astonishment appeared on his face.

It was the Divine Kingdom of a powerhouse from the nine-origin universe.

This Wang Xian was definitely not mistaken!

Powerhouses from the sword and Magic Universe did not cultivate the divine kingdom! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian flew over and took a look at the divine kingdom. He realized that it was of the water attribute.

The divine kingdom was in ruins, but there was still an energy seal that prevented one from entering!

“This divine kingdom does not have the aura of the Divine Dragon. It seems that it is not the Divine Kingdom of the Divine Dragon Race. I wonder why a divine kingdom would appear here. ”

Wang Xian muttered to himself with a puzzled look on his face.

He continued to search the surroundings but didn’t see the divine kingdom again.

There were about 50 to 60 other broken war machines, corpses, and the like.

There were no treasures that could enter the divine kingdom either.

Wang Xian couldn’t enter the divine kingdom even if there was an energy barrier.

“It seems like I have to wait for an lie to come before I can enter these war machines and the divine kingdom. I should be able to get a decent harvest! ” Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled with anticipation.

This was like opening a blind box. What if he could find a powerful treasure?

He did not encounter any danger.

Wang Xian continued flying.

At this moment, his powerful sensing ability sensed a powerful spatial fluctuation.

His body moved and he flew over immediately!

When he flew over, he saw a pagoda floating in the air askew.

The entire space had no land, and the entire city was floating in the air.

The position below gave people a sense of danger. That was the bottom, and there was danger there.

And in the position in front, the huge, Askew Pagoda, which was upside down, had its tip inserted into the void below.

It was as though it had entered another space!

Wang Xian looked over and revealed a curious expression.

He got closer and looked at the place where the tip was inserted. At the edge, he could vaguely sense that it was another space.

However, there were spatial storms within a short distance!

The energy of the spatial storms was not very strong. With Wang Xian’s strength, he should be able to pass through with difficulty!

He swept his gaze across the surroundings and sensed with his mind.

“Someone came here just now. I think he entered the place! ”

In the surrounding space, Wang Xian could feel the fluctuation of the space. It was obvious that someone had been here before.

“The holy sons and Saintesses of the undeserved forbidden ground and flowing water forbidden ground?”

Wang Xian mumbled. He hesitated for a moment before moving his body and flying straight in.

There were only a few decades left before he could contact an lie.

He could go inside and take a look. Even if he was trapped inside, he would be able to get an lie to bring him out.

Buzz

A powerful tearing force of space was transmitted over. Wang Yun’s Space Force covered his entire body and condensed into numerous sharp swords to defend against it.

Buzz

Very soon, his figure appeared in another space!

When Wang Yun saw this space, his body paused slightly.

This space was not very big, and it could not be compared to the space above.

However, this space was not very small either.

Moreover, the energy of this space was more stable than the space above!

In the front of this space, there were more than ten enormous pillars.

These pillars seemed to support the entire space.

In this space, there was a building that was similar to the Void Pagoda. It contained the power of space.

This building was almost complete and contained a huge amount of space power.

“It is indeed similar to the Void Pagoda. No, this should be the Void Pagoda. It should be similar to the Void Pagoda of an lie. The Aura and level should be the

Wang Xian looked over and his eyes sparkled.

Other than the Void Pagoda, there were more than ten corpses.

These corpses were all trapped and killed here!

Other than these, there was nothing else.

“To think that the Void Pagoda of the Void clan would appear here. What a surprise. Moreover, this void pagoda has not been destroyed. It is obviously suppressed!”

“Could it be that the Void Universe is involved in this war as well?”

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings. His eyes flickered.

“This should be a huge formation. The formation trapped and killed these experts. impressive. A huge formation that trapped and killed more than ten existences at the peak of the Universe Overlord realm. There’s also a terrifying void Pagoda! ”

Wang Xian sighed slightly.

Buzz

At this moment, he sensed something in his heart and immediately looked to the right.

There, he saw some human figures standing in front of the huge pillars.

“Those are the holy sons and holy virgins of the unfettered forbidden land, flowing water forbidden land. ”

“I think there are also the holy sons and Holy Virgins of the Forbidden Land,

the Sacred Academy, and the sacred land.”

Wang Xian looked over and mumbled.

At this moment, he realized that there were holy sons and Saintesses and heaven’s pride disciples around each of the huge pillars.

This made him a little curious.

He hesitated for a moment before flying over.

However, before he arrived in front of them, he saw many figures at the center of the huge pillars.

Obviously, these figures had been sealed and were dead!

There were many magic symbols carved on the pillar.

These figures that had been sealed and died sat on a throne.. Each of them held a great magic staff and were filled with determination!
