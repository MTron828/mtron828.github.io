Chapter 2895: 2,895 might of the Dragon Palace 2

“All the god-king powerhouses of the Shamanistic Association were killed, not a single one was left alive. However, the Dragon Palace did not kill any powerhouses below the god-king level. I would like to ask the powerhouses of the eight barrens, are you panicking?”

Are you panicking?

At this moment, in the communication network of the eight barrens and six directions, a piece of news came from a slightly well-known person.

And that person was invincible in terms of battle techniques.

Invincible in terms of battle techniques used a special method to get his underlings to log onto his communication network and publish this message. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

His slightly mocking words attracted the attention of many people in bhang Liu he.

Did they panic?

How could bhang Liu he and the others not panic?

They had just joined forces with the Imperial Court of the Cheng Wizard Association. In just two months, the Cheng Wizard Association and the Imperial Court were destroyed by the Dragon Palace.

And they had been easily destroyed.

They had swept through a region and destroyed two top forces.

Nine Wind Dragons roared in the starry sky and shook the world!

‘this…’.

When the experts of the eight barrens heard the news, their expressions changed drastically.

This was a matter that concerned their lives.

The eight barrens were very powerful, but they were definitely not as powerful as the combined forces of the imperial court and the Cheng Wizard Association.

Especially the formation Wizard Association. After they had prepared their defenses, their eight barrens could not break through their opponent’s defense in a one-on-one fight.

However, now that they were destroyed, apart from the ones released by the Dragon Palace, the others were all destroyed.

Even the Wizards were killed!

The Wizards were the peak existences among the resplendent starry sky celestial thearch.

There were no more than three experts who were stronger than the Wizards in the entire resplendent starry sky.

Even the barren divine emperor of the eight barrens was no match for Wizards.

“Do you think the Dragon King will lead the powerhouses of the Dragon Palace Here?”

At this moment, someone asked a question.

The expressions of all the powerhouses and disciples of the eight barrens changed drastically when they saw this question.

There was a strange commotion in the eight barrens and six directions communication network now.

The disciples who were not from the eight barrens were all very shocked and replied to all kinds of comments.

However, the disciples from the eight Barrens felt their scalps go numb when they saw these questions and chose to remain silent.

This caused a lot less people to reply to the comments even though it was originally a very shocking matter.

The atmosphere was slightly strange.

Not only in the communication network, but also in the eight barrens and the six barrens’reality, the atmosphere was very strange.

Some of the disciples from the eight Barrens looked embarrassed and hurried.

Many of them looked worried.

They were really afraid now.

They were afraid that the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace would lead the experts to attack them.

What could they do then?

Surrender or run away?

As for resistance, none of the disciples and experts of the eight barrens thought that they would be a match for the Dragon Palace.

“Lord desolate celestial emperor, all the information in the communication network is true. Also, I got a piece of news from the holy region that the Divine Emperor Wu of the imperial court and the Divine Emperor Yan of the Umbrella League were instantly killed by the Dragon King in the Holy Region!”

As the entire eight barrens and six directions shook, all the divine emperors of the eight barrens gathered in the great hall on the eight barrens planet.

Dozens of eight barrens guardians stood in front of them. The leader, an old man, reported with an extremely ugly expression.

The atmosphere was slightly solemn, and everyone’s expressions were very bad.

Even the barren divine emperor, who was sitting in front of them, had a gloomy expression.

The information that had been circulated on the communication network in the past two days was a disaster that was about to arrive.

The other dozen or so divine emperors leaned on their divine thrones, their expressions changing.

For a moment, the entire hall seemed to freeze.

The strength that the dragon palace had displayed made them feel despair.

If they attacked, the eight desolates would definitely not be a match for the Dragon Palace. They did not know how many people would die by then.

Once the Dragon Palace was organized in advance, they might even be able to catch them all in one fell swoop.

“Boom!”

Just as the entire hall was abnormally silent, a terrifying aura rushed over.

“Who is it!”

“You are courting death. How dare you barge into our eight Barrens!”

In an instant, the god Emperors in the hall seemed to have been ignited by flames. They all stood up, and their bodies were filled with a brutal expression.

“Weng!”

“Everyone from the eight desolate!”

At this moment, a voice sounded.

The desolate god Emperor stared at the figure that appeared in front of him, his eyes flashing with a cold luster.

“Oh?”

When they saw the figure that appeared, everyone’s expression changed slightly.

“Monarch?”

The desolate god Emperor looked at the old man who entered the great hall with the light scepter in his hand. He had a surprised expression as he asked.

“He’s just a stray dog!”

The Emperor Master held the scepter of light tightly and said expressionlessly.

“May I know why you’re here?”

The desolate god Emperor stared at him and his expression changed.

“The Witch Formation Association was destroyed and all of our god Emperors died. I’m the only one who escaped!”

The Emperor Master said in a deep voice and raised his head slightly and closed his eyes.

“Is the Dragon Palace’s Divine Dragon Real?”

The desolate god-emperor gritted his teeth and asked the emperor.

“Yes, it’s exactly the same as the wind divine dragon in the records. It’s a real divine dragon.”

The Emperor replied.

“Hiss!”

In the hall, the protectors and the god-emperor could not help but suck in a breath of cold air. They were moved.

“Then why did the emperor come to us?”

The desolate divine emperor clenched his fists and asked.

“I’m here to tell you that you should be prepared to escape and find an opportunity to take revenge!”

The desolate divine emperor opened his blood-red eyes, which were somewhat desolate.

Everyone in the Great Hall looked at the tired emperor in front of them and felt a chill in their hearts.

This was the leader of a peak faction that once ruled a region, but now he was actually in such a sorry state.

“Monarch, please stay with us for now. We have been here for hundreds of millions of years, and we have a secret base in the depths. Even if the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace and the others come, they will not be in danger.”

The barren divine emperor said to him slowly.

“Okay!”

The monarch nodded, and his eyes swept across the surrounding barren divine emperors, his gaze landed on the barren divine emperor. “The Dragon Palace is very powerful, and even the inheritance formation of the Wizard Association could not withstand it for two minutes. The sky array divine emperor is good at all kinds of formations. If the Dragon Palace comes, we must find a safe place.”

“Otherwise, everyone will be finished!”

He reminded.

“Don’t worry. Even powerful wizards can’t find that place in the eight desolates six harmonies.”

The desolate divine emperor said.

At the same time, he was very shocked.

What kind of power could make the monarch so afraid?

How powerful was the Dragon Palace!

Time passed bit by bit, but the eight desolates remained silent.

At this time, what else could they do?

Shouting was just a joke.

Everyone could see that there was a huge difference between eight desolates and the Dragon Palace.

However, the news of the Dragon Palace sweeping through the Heaven Wizard region and destroying the Cheng Wizard Association and the imperial court gradually spread to other star areas.

Unlike eight desolates, six desolates, and the Holy Region, they were most concerned about the Dragon Palace’s Divine Dragon.

Was the Dragon God a real Dragon God?

Was it the legendary Dragon God at the pinnacle of the Universe?
