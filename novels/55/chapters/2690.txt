2691 2691 had occupied the horizon domain

“This...”

The angry and resentful voice of the sect master of the horizon sect was still echoing in the sky. Besides six to seven million floating corpses, there were no other disciples of the horizon sect around Dragon Peak.

Looking at the floating corpses on Dragon Peak, everyone felt a chill in their hearts.

Because an elder of the horizon sect had snatched the abyssal seed from the Dragon Palace, and because the horizon sect had killed the disciples of the Dragon Palace, the horizon sect had paid such a price.

“This... how did the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace become so powerful?”

On the left, the forces of the North Stream sect and the others from the world margin sect had watched this scene with their mouths Agape.

They had asked themselves to know a little about the strength of the Dragon Palace, but what they had shown today had shocked them.

“Last month, sect master, the Dragon Peak of the Dragon Palace seems to be more powerful than before, and its energy is more abundant.”

An ancestor of the ancient God dynasty whispered to the sect master last month and the others.

“Yes!”

The sect master last month and the others nodded slightly. They could sense the change in the Dragon Peak.

“The array master in the Dragon Palace must have made a breakthrough, so he can contend with the world margin sect.”

An ancestor of last month said in a low voice.

“The strength of the Dragon Palace has jumped to the peak of the Demon Island. The world margin sect has been defeated, and even Jiu Xiao is no match for the Dragon Palace.”

The sect master from last month sighed slightly.

To be invincible on the Demon Island, the Dragon Palace’s strength was truly terrifying.

“Let’s pay them a visit.”

At the Nine Heavens Sect’s group’s seats, the two nine Heavens Patriarch looked at each other and said softly.

Having witnessed the Dragon Palace’s terrifying strength with their own eyes, nine heavens had to be on good terms with the Dragon Palace to avoid future conflicts.

Otherwise, the end of the world might be a lesson for them.

They swept their gazes across the corpses of the world margin great sect. There were more than 18,000 godly monarch-level corpses.

Furthermore, they recognized that there were two bodies of elder world margin. Including the five that had disappeared previously, there were seven in total.

They were close to half of the world margin’s peak combat strength.

“How terrifying!”

At the back, the Patriarch of the heaven-severing sect was speaking in shock. When he saw Patriarch Jiuxiao and the rest flying over, he immediately followed behind them.

“The Dragon Palace’s strength is truly extraordinary. Congratulations, Dragon King, for defeating the Tianya sect!”

Jiuxiao’s patriarch flew over, cupped his hands, and congratulated Wang Xian.

“Thank you, Jiuxiao. Our Dragon Palace has no intention of becoming enemies with any force. However, the Tianya sect killed our disciples.”

Wang Xian cupped his hands at Jiuxiao’s patriarch and replied politely.

After all, the two of them were peak immortal king existences and deserved equal treatment from the Dragon Palace.

“Congratulations, Dragon King. Congratulations, Dragon Palace. In the future, if anything happens to the Dragon Palace on the Demon Island, we, Duan Tian, will definitely support them.”

Duan Tian’s sect master and Patriarch flew over and said respectfully.

Duan Tian’s strength was slightly lower than Jiuxiao Tianya’s, so he naturally had to lower himself when facing the Dragon Palace.

“Thank you, everyone. We need to take care of this area before heading to the center of the Demon Island. Perhaps in the future, we will become neighbors. In the future, our Dragon Palace will also protect the Demon Island with you.”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Then we won’t disturb the Dragon King.”

When Jiu Xiao, Duan Tian, and the other powerhouses heard that, they were slightly shocked and nodded immediately.

Wang Xian’s intention was very obvious. He wanted to tell them that they were going to the world’s end domain to occupy it.

The Dragon Palace would replace the world’s end sect.

As for the people from the world’s end sect, they would probably flee to other places.

Otherwise, with the strength of the Dragon Palace, they would not be able to resist.

“Congratulations Dragon Palace, Congratulations Dragon King!”

“Congratulations Dragon King!”

In the surrounding area, the experts of the various factions shouted with flattering expressions.

They had personally witnessed the world margin sect’s crushing defeat. In the future, when the Dragon Palace settled down on the demon island, they would naturally lick it.

“Dragon King, Congratulations.”

“Will the Dragon Palace settle down on the Demon Island in the future?”

The experts from the ancient God dynasty of the Beichuan Sect’s dragon Python group looked at each other and flew towards the Dragon Peak. Their eyes were sparkling as they asked.

“Yes, we are preparing to occupy the territory of the ends of the Earth!”

Wang Xian nodded.

“That’s even better. That’s even better. In the future, our powers and the Dragon Palace’s territory will be much closer.”

The sect master and the rest from last month immediately said with smiles on their faces. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Alright, our Dragon Palace will head to the center of the Demon Island immediately.”

...

Wang Xian said.

“Alright, Alright. We will head back immediately as well.”

The sect master and the rest of the experts from last month also said immediately.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the surroundings and saw that all the corpses and the like had been put away. He flew to the command platform and said to the Heaven Formation.

“Alright, Dragon King.”

The sky array nodded with a smile on its face. The Dragon Peak was activated and flew towards the center of the Demon Island.

As they watched the gigantic and towering dragon peak gradually fly into the distance, all the forces behind them watched with a look of astonishment.

“Who would have thought that an external force, the Dragon Palace, would step on the ends of the Earth and step onto the stage of the Demon Island today?”

All the experts could not help but sigh in their hearts.

“Inform all the disciples of Jiuxiao not to provoke anyone from the Dragon Palace in the future.”

...

The two elders of Jiuxiao were silent for a moment before they gave an order to the sect master of Jiuxiao.

The strength of the Dragon Palace was already very terrifying to begin with. Now, they had even obtained the ultimate treasure of the horizon.

“Dragon King, other than collecting a bunch of corpses, the biggest reward this time is the horizon ruler.”

On the Dragon Peak, Heaven Array looked at the horizon ruler in the Dragon Peak with a smile and said to Wang Xian.

Everyone from the horizon sect instantly returned to their own divine kingdom. Naturally, they couldn’t take this horizon ruler with them.

Wang Xian looked over and his body moved. He landed directly on the horizon ruler.

“At the last moment, the sect master of the Horizon sect and two elders offered sacrifices. This caused the power of the horizon ruler to be very strong.”

Wang Xian came to the front of the world end ruler and sized it up.

It was a wind attribute divine weapon that possessed an extremely powerful power.

It was the Supreme Treasure of the World End sect!

“This world end ruler is a supreme treasure at the peak of the godly monarch realm. When controlled by three godly monarch level nine experts, it can unleash the combat strength of the peak of the immortal godly monarch realm. It is extraordinary and belongs to a powerful war divine weapon.”

The Heaven Array came to the world end ruler and said, “This world end ruler has intelligence and is loyal to the world end sect. I need to modify it.”

“I’ll leave it to you. With this sky edge ruler, it can increase the strength of the Dragon Palace by quite a bit.”

Wang Xian said.

Three level 9 powerhouses controlling the sky edge ruler could unleash the combat strength of a peak immortal king.

This was equivalent to adding seven more immortal King Level 9 powerhouses to the Dragon Palace.

“Other than this sky edge ruler, I’ve gained a lot.”

Wang Xian mumbled. The corpses of the seven elders, the god country of four immortal King Level 9 powerhouses, and two immortal king level 9 abyssal seed corpses.

This time, he could add 11 level 9 undying godly monarchs to the dragon palace.

The rest of the improvements were also huge.

“With such strength, the Dragon Palace can completely gain a foothold on the Demon Island, guarding the Abyss on the Northern Line.”

He mumbled, a smile on his face.
