Chapter 1418: 1418, what was a chosen one? 4

“They are not bad, but there is another young man who is very good. That young man in tattered clothes has very good skills!”

“He should have just broken through to transcendent level 8, but his rich experience almost caused Qian Jun to fail miserably. This young man should not be from a good family. In time, he won’t be inferior to that Xiao Yue!”

The old woman at the back said to Mang Hong with a smile.

“When this generation of prodigies rises up, our dragon-phoenix Empire will become better and better, Haha!”

Mang Hong laughed happily.

“The selection of the top ten has ended. Congratulations to Xiao Yue, Qian Jun, Zhou Hai, Liu Fengwen, Nangong Huahua...”. He Yiqing and the other ten prodigies, you will represent the flaming sun continent to Dragon-phoenix royal city to participate in the final competition. At that time, you will compete with the other continents’Prodigies!”

“In the afternoon, the ten prodigies will have a ranking. Who will be able to become the king of the prodigies of Our Flaming Sun Continent? Everyone, let’s wait and see!”

On the stage, the teachers of Flaming Sun Academy announced loudly.

“Eh? I didn’t expect that other than that young man from Daybreak Moon, there’s also a good seedling!”

At this moment, in a corner of the stage, an elder from the blood stream sect said in slight surprise.

“Oh? There’s more? Great-grandfather, didn’t you say that Xiao Yue is about to break through to the half-step void interpretation realm? Who else could it be?”

The arrogant youth beside the old man asked in surprise.

“That plain-clothed youth, he yiqing, didn’t take too many pills from his body. He has rich battle experience and should have fought in the wild. He’s a good seedling!”

The old man lightly stroked his beard and said with a smile.

“Is that so?”

The youth looked over curiously.

The duel in the afternoon didn’t drag on for too long.

Two hours later, the competition continued.

This time, it was the battle for the top ten rankings. It was much more exciting than the one in the morning and yesterday.

Every youth wanted to prove themselves and obtain a higher ranking.

At the start of the ranking competition, every genius youth who appeared on stage drew a flood of cheers.

The ten youths had undoubtedly become the ten star figures of the Flaming Sun Continent.

“That he yiqing is really surprising. He actually fought with Nangong Huahua for such a long time!”

“Yeah, this he yiqing is probably going to be ranked sixth, the strongest expert among the rank eight transcendents!”

“Nangong Huahua lost to Zhou Hai!”

“Zhou Hai defeated Qianjun, I didn’t expect that!”

“The finals are here!”

As the battle progressed, the audience looked at the battle on the stage with excitement.

The final battle, Xiao Yue vs Zhou Hai.

Zhou Hai was originally a very low-key person among the five, but he didn’t expect that he would fight all the way to the end.

“Both of them are at the peak of transcendent level 9. It will take at least ten minutes to decide the victor!”

In the center of the viewing platform, the city lord of Flaming Sun City and the Dean of Flaming Sun Academy looked at the duel in satisfaction.

They represented the flaming sun region. They did not want to be ranked behind in the first prodigy tournament of the dragon-phoenix Empire.

It was very embarrassing to say that.

“Haha, Zhou Hai, You’re not my match. The Top Prodigy of the flaming sun region is mine. Haha, it’s time to break through!”

At this moment, two figures separated from each other in the fierce battle below.

Xiao Yue suddenly laughed maniacally, and her aura began to rise rapidly.

“What?”

Zhou Hai’s expression changed slightly when he saw Xiao Yue’s aura increase greatly. “You’re going to break through!”

“Haha, that’s right. I was about to break through two days ago. Today, the time has come. I’ll let you experience the power of a half-step void interpretation!”

Xiao Yue laughed maniacally, and with a movement, a terrifying power directly pressed down on Zhou Hai.

Zhou Hai’s expression changed greatly. The opponent’s attack had doubled. With his strength, there was no way for him to block it.

“Boom!”

He gritted his teeth and received the opponent’s punch. This time, his body was sent flying over a hundred meters away. He felt a sweet taste in his mouth!

“What?”

“Xiao Yue actually broke through. She actually reached the half-step void interpretation realm in the battle!”

“My God, Xiao Yue actually broke through to the half-step void interpretation realm. This... is simply too strong!”

When everyone around saw this scene, their faces were filled with shock. All of them stared at Xiao Yue with their eyes wide open.

“Good, good, half-step void interpretation, half-step void interpretation!”

On the main stage, the city lord of Flaming Sun City and the Dean of Flaming Sun Academy saw this scene and revealed excited expressions as they laughed loudly.

With a breakthrough, Xiao Yue would have the chance to compete for the title of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire’s King of Geniuses.

“Xiao Yue!”

“Xiao Yue!”

In the surrounding audience stands, those who supported Xiao Yue cheered excitedly.

“I admit defeat!”

Zhou Hai swallowed the blood in his mouth and said unwillingly.

“Haha, in the younger generation of the flaming sun continent, I, Xiaoyue, am the strongest. Haha, I Am the Head of the Chosen One!”

Xiaoyue couldn’t help but shout at the sky with excitement. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

In the entire flaming sun continent, he was the king of the younger generation!

“Domineering, Xiaoyue is simply too domineering. This is the king of the younger generation of our Flaming Sun Continent!”

“Too cool, too cool!”

When the surrounding spectators saw the Howling Xiaoyue, all of them revealed smiles on their faces as they spoke in admiration.

“TSK TSK, he’s really a little arrogant. Such a heaven’s favorite isn’t considered a heaven’s favorite!”

In a corner of the spectator stand, a youth said with slight disdain.

“These ten youths are all pretty good. We’ll recruit them over later!”

The old man said with a smile.

Coming here this time was a pleasant surprise to him.

“Congratulations to the Dawn Moon Prodigy, the Top Prodigy of our flaming sun continent. He will lead the prodigies of our flaming sun continent to participate in the dragon-phoenix Empire’s prodigy competition!”

“The remaining nine prodigies will go up to the stage to receive their rewards!”

After Wild Cheers, the Flaming Sun Academy’s Dean stood up with a smile and said.

“It’s the Headmaster!”

One by one, the top ten youths of the flaming sun continent flew onto the stage and enjoyed the brilliance of the attention of thousands of people.

Ten youths stood in a row on the stage with strong confidence on their faces.

Eight male students and two female students!

Each person’s face was filled with pride and pride.

“Today, you are the Peerless Geniuses of Our Flaming Sun Continent!”

The Dean looked at the ten young men in high spirits and shouted loudly.

“Absolute geniuses!”

“Absolute geniuses!”

Around them, hundreds of thousands of spectators stood up and shouted in unison.

“Hehe!”

“They don’t have the qualifications to be called absolute geniuses!”

“The Dragon and Phoenix Empire also doesn’t have the qualifications to hold the genius competition!”

“What is a genius? Only those who use blood to fight their way out of the genius stage of the demi-human graveyard can be called a genius!”

“All of you aren’t qualified yet!”

At this moment, a mocking voice resounded in the surrounding sky, causing everyone to be slightly stunned.

The youth from the blood stream sect slowly stood up!
