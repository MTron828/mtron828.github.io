Chapter 2964: On top of the 2964 Chimei region treasure

“Dragon King!”

Wang Xian returned to the demon lair and heard the voices of Tian Cheng and the rest.

“Get Ready. We are going to attack the level four demon lair of the void God realm. It might be dangerous at that time. Keep this liquid and you can recover your injuries instantly.”

“We have entered the level four demon lair of the void God realm. We have to kill the level four demon leader of the void God realm as soon as possible. We can’t let it summon its subordinates!”

!!

Wang Xian reminded Ao he and the rest.

“Dragon King, there shouldn’t be a problem. Right now, our devouring dragon has 33 level three god-emperor realm experts. They can surround and kill a level four god-emperor realm demonic lair. Adding me, there shouldn’t be a problem.”

Ao he said confidently.

In this one year, they had broken through more than 10,000 demonic lairs. The demonic lairs and the lairs in the demonic lairs were huge resources for the devouring dragon.

Currently, there were 6,000 emperor-level devouring dragons.

There were also 33 emperor-level Rank-3 Devouring Dragons.

Ten emperor-level Rank-3 Devouring Dragons could fight against one emperor-level Rank-4 Devouring Dragon.

More than 30 emperor-level Rank-3 Devouring Dragons had a high chance of killing one emperor-level Rank-4 demonic beast.

“To prevent any accidents, I will use the immortal-slaying calabash to launch an attack in an instant. Ao you and the emperor-level Rank-3 Devouring Dragon will follow closely behind. Try your best to kill it in an instant!”

Wang Xian instructed ao he.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao he nodded his head.

“An lie!”

Wang Xian gestured to an lie.

An lie nodded his head. He had already checked all the remaining 15 demon caves.

“Get Ready!”

He reminded Wang Xian and the rest.

Everyone nodded their heads.

“Let’s Go!”

An lie shouted softly. In the next moment, they appeared in front of the altar in another demon cave.

This was because the dragon of Ao Crab’s devouring ability was in a combat state. It was extremely huge.

The moment they appeared, they were immediately discovered.

However, the level four celestial thearch Yao Xie in the deepest part of the demon lair was a little stunned when he saw Wang Xian and the rest who suddenly appeared. He did not manage to react for a moment.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

At this moment, about 70 level three celestial thearch immortal slaying swords instantly attacked the level four celestial thearch Yao Xie.

Ao crab, who was ready to attack, and the 33 devouring dragons also launched their attacks.

The terrifying energy instantly covered the dazed Celestial Thearch level-four demonic evil celestial thearch.

“Ao ao ao!”

A terrified voice sounded.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

In the next moment, the Celestial Thearch level-four demonic evil was directly covered by the terrifying energy, and its vitality quickly disappeared.

“Instant kill!”

Ao crab could not help but shout.

Instant Kill!

The sudden appearance and sudden attack killed the level four demonic god before he could even react.

“The rest of the demonic god, finish them off as soon as possible!”

Wang Xian clenched his fists excitedly and said to Ao crab and the rest.

There were 50 demonic god-level demonic god in this demon cave. Among them, one was level four and five were level three.

Without the need for Wang Xian to make a move, the devouring dragon would be able to kill all of them.

In less than five minutes, all the devouring dragons flew over with a large number of corpses.

“A celestial thearch level three devouring dragon can reach level four celestial thearch of the Void by devouring this demon lair!”

“A celestial thearch level four demonic corpse can allow a member of the Dragon Palace to reach level four.”

“If the Celestial Thearch level four demonic lair is not enough to level up, it means that this demon lair can allow the Dragon Palace to add two celestial thearch level four combat strength members!”

Wang Xian muttered to himself as a smile appeared on his face.

It was a perfect start.

Now that the start was over, it was time to wait for the Dragon Palace to increase the combat strength of the two level four celestial thearch members.

“Ao Yao, bring the corpse back to the Dragon Palace and upgrade your strength!”

“AO he, send a member to devour this demon lair. After you guys upgrade it, we will continue to enter the next demon lair!”

Wang Xian instructed.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao and the rest nodded.

After a good start, the rest would be much easier.

They continued to hunt and upgrade the demon lairs one by one. Even if they were to face the last two demonic lairs of a level five celestial thearch, they would be able to deal with them.

“Get Ready, Kill!”

Half a month later, Ao Yao returned. The Devouring Dragon had increased the combat strength of one celestial thearch level four.

There were a total of three celestial thearch-level Rank-4 members.

Wang Xian let out a low growl and they instantly appeared in another demon lair.

It was three against one, and there were more than thirty celestial thearch-level Rank-3 Devouring Dragons. It was equivalent to six against one!

This time, the celestial thearch-level Rank-4 Yao Yao was still unable to resist and was quickly killed.

Soon, another demon lair was conquered.

This time, they didn’t have to wait for the members of the Dragon Palace to digest the resources and directly attacked the demon cave behind them.

Following that, they continued to attack for five consecutive times before they stopped.

Only eight demon caves were not taken down.

The reason why they stopped was because there were two level four celestial thearch experts in the eighth demon cave.

“Let’s level up first. After digesting the resources we have now, there will be eighteen level four celestial thearch experts in the Dragon Palace.”

Wang Xian calculated with a smile on his face.

“Dragon King, I’ll go upgrade!”

Tian Cheng, who was standing at the side, couldn’t help but say.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded and naturally had no objections.

After the upgrade of Tian Cheng, each of them could rival two or three of the same level. Naturally, he would be the priority.

“After you guys have finished upgrading, apart from the last two demon caves, sweep all the other demon caves at once!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

The members of the Dragon Palace nodded with a smile and immediately returned to the Dragon Palace to start upgrading.

Half a month’s time was very fast for them.

Fifteen days later, the 18 celestial thearch-level-four experts of the Dragon Palace arrived.

“Get Ready!”

An lie looked at them and reminded them.

The Hunt continued.

The 18 celestial thearch-level-four experts of the Dragon Palace were very easy to hunt.

In less than a day, all six demon caves were destroyed.

“There are only the last two left. If we want to take down the last two demon caves, we need to raise our strength. After half a month, we will destroy them!”

Wang Xian said confidently.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The leaders of the Dragon Palace also revealed a confident expression.

Now, they had 18 celestial thearch level four combat strength. They were able to fight against a celestial thearch level five demon and gain the upper hand.

On this day, the resources they obtained from the six demon caves were multiplied. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

According to Wang Xian’s calculations, they could increase the number of level four celestial thearch fighters by 28.

18 plus 28,46.

Level five celestial thearch demon could be killed!

“An lie, pay attention to the movements of the two demon caves. I will return to the Dragon Palace as well!”

Wang Xian instructed an lie before returning to the Dragon Palace with his subordinates.

Now that an lie had absorbed the energy from the altar of the high-level demon cave, his strength had a breakthrough once again.

He was a level three celestial thearch. He went to the level five Demon Cave of the Celestial Thearch and couldn’t be discovered by the demons.

“Let’s Rest for a while!”

After returning to the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian went to his bedroom in satisfaction. He was preparing for the biggest battle in the chimei territory in half a month!
