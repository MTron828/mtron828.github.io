Chapter 580: Shot To Fame (3)

The prices Wang Xian was charging were definitely the lowest in the entire Yong Chang City.

The main reason was largely because his success rate was insanely high.

Even grandmaster-class existences wouldn’t have a success rate of a hundred percent in refining elixir pills or spiritual equipment.

It was especially so for refining elixir pills. An alchemist grand master would at most have a success rate of forty to fifty percent while refining Level 5 elixir pills.

As for refining Level 6 elixir pills, the success rate would roughly be at thirty percent.

However, Wang Xian could achieve a hundred percent. In other words, even if Wang Xian had accepted two sets of materials for refining elixir pills, his rewards would still be great.

This was also the reason why Wang Xian agreed to the collaboration with the Mu Family. When the volume was great, he would totally accept a lower price.

Therefore, Wang Xian also offered a seemingly exceptional low price to Tianwen Sect.

“Not charging?”

When the five men heard Wang Xian, they were stunned once again. He’s not charging? He’s really not charging? Are there such good deals in the world?

They felt this was a little unbelievable.

However, they knew that he wasn’t lying to them when they saw boxes of precious materials placed on the floor.

He had no reason to scam them either.

“Master, your charges are even a lot cheaper than the Saint Forge Workshop! This...” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The middle-aged man with long hair looked at Wang Xian and spoke with disbelief.

“You don’t have to worry about the quality of the elixir pills or spiritual equipment.”

Wang Xian smiled and replied to him.

“Thank you, master. Thank you, master! We will arrange to send the materials here right away. Thank you, master, for being magnanimous. After we offended you, you are still willing to do so. Let me apologize to you once again!” the five of them said gratefully.

This was the level of magnanimity that a master should have. Despite them offending Wang Xian just moments ago, Wang Xian was still willing to charge them a really low price.

Wang Xian smiled faintly and said, “You guys can go prepare the materials. Just send them over when you are ready. If you can, help me publicize my shop!”

“Yes, yes!”

The five of them nodded and added, “We will go get the materials ready and will be back soon!”

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. He looked to the boxes of materials beside him, waved his arm and sent them to the second floor.

The five people from Tianwen Sect didn’t hesitate at all as they headed for the exit right away.

“This feels unreal!”

When the five men from Tianwen Sect left the small shop, they looked at the signboard once again. They felt a little confused and lost.

“Yeah! That young man is really a master. Moreover, even the Mu Family looked for him to refine their elixir pills and spiritual equipment!”

“I wonder if he’s the alchemist master or blacksmith master. Is there another master?”

“It has to be. We are lucky that the people from the Mu Family were here. If we clashed with the master, the outcome would have been really unimaginable!”

“That master is magnanimous and we are really lucky!”

“Yeah, we are really lucky!”

As the five of them conversed, they couldn’t help but be excited.

They would have never expected a small shop like this to really have a master.

Moreover, the master was magnanimous. He didn’t take offence and agreed to refine elixir pills and spiritual equipment for them. This made the five of them greatly impressed by Wang Xian.

“That’s a real master! Let’s go and get our materials!”

“Let’s go. The master even charges a lot lower than the Saint Forge Workshop. It’s a blessing in disguise that the bunch of scumbags from Saint Forge Workshop rejected us previously. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have gotten such a great deal!”

The five of them headed back towards their sect excitedly. In less than an hour, they came back with several boxes of materials.

“Master, master!”

The five of them carried boxes of materials into the shop with some other disciples of Tianwen Sect.

“You can just leave them there!”

Wang Xian was pleasantly surprised to see them back so quickly as he instructed them.

“Yes, yes!”

The five of them nodded their heads and instructed their disciples.

“Master, when will our spiritual equipment and elixir pills be done?”

The five of them rubbed their hands as they asked Wang Xian.

“Your orders are fewer. I’ll refine your materials first. You guys can return to collect in the afternoon tomorrow!”

Wang Xian looked across the boxes and spoke directly.

“Afternoon, tomorrow? So fast?”

The five of them were shocked once again.

“Just come back tomorrow and they will be ready!”

“Alright, alright!”

The five of them nodded their heads and didn’t question further. After exchanging a few more words with Wang Xian, they left the shop.

“Puff! It’s another rewarding day!”

Wang Xian moved all the materials to the second floor. He couldn’t help but feel exhilarated.

The materials and elixir pills from the Mu Family would allow him to gain over thirty million points of dragon energy.

As for the elixir pills of Tianwen Sect, he would also be able to gain over six million points of dragon energy.

Together, his dragon energy would reach approximately forty million. On top of that, he would still get a huge batch of spiritual equipment.

“This is even more insane than robbing a bank!”

Wang Xian’s eyes stared fervently at the various materials on the second floor. He closed the shop for the day.

“The spiritual flame ball can be devoured by the Inferno Dragon Ball while the spiritual liquid ball can be used to nourish the Water Dragon Ball!”

Wang Xian had three dragon balls currently.

A Level 11 Inferno Dragon Ball, a Level 10 Wood Dragon Ball and a Level 10 Water Dragon Ball.

The level of the Inferno Dragon Ball was the highest. After devouring the Level 11 spiritual flame ball, the Inferno Dragon Ball would get a substantial lift.

The Wood Dragon Ball was the Level 9 spiritual wood ball he obtained on the floating island previously. He had now nurtured it to Level 10.

The three dragon balls were of little use to him currently.

However, when the dragon balls reached the same level as him, the might of the dragon balls would be incredible.

Wang Xian spent a full fifteen hours before completely refining the materials brought by Tianwen Sect into spiritual equipment and elixir pills.

The boxes of spiritual equipment and elixir pills would definitely draw a frenzied cloud if placed in the Underworld.

In Yong Chang world, there were also precious items.

“Master!”

At noon, the voices of the five old men from Tianwen Sect could be heard.

“They are done! Feel free to take them away!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and the boxes of spiritual equipment and elixir pills flew from the second floor. Subsequently, he walked down while wearing a faint smile.

“Done!”

The five of them were exhilarated. These elixir pills and spiritual equipment were all exceptionally precious to Tianwen Sect.

“They are done! They are all done! Oh gosh! The spiritual equipment and elixir pills are done! Thank you, master! Thank you!”

When they opened the boxes and saw the spiritual equipment and elixir pills, they were elated and thanked Wang Xian loudly.

“You are welcome. If you can help to introduce customers and send them over, please do so!”

Wang Xian waved his arms at them and continued, “I’m going back to work.”

“Yes, yes! Master!”

The five of them nodded their heads respectfully before turning their fervent gaze back to the spiritual equipment and elixir pills.

“Haha! Let’s go. I was still worried that we couldn’t find a master to refine for us. Even if we found one, it might take three to four months or even six to seven months. Now, we got it done in a single day. Our luck is really off the charts!”

The five of them carried the boxes out joyously and loaded them onto a horse carriage.

“Let’s go!” the five of them shouted happily.

“Old Ge, take a look at the entrance of Saint Forge Workshop! The scumbags from Mt. Zhenliu are there too!”

When the horse carriage went past the entrance of the Saint Forge Workshop, a middle-aged man squinted his eyes and saw a group of people before the entrance of Saint Forge Workshop.

The middle-aged man with long hair looked over and a thought struck him.

“That master forgave us and still refined spiritual equipment and elixir pills for us. Our Tianwen Sect should also try to repay this graciousness and express our gratitude!”

“Since that master asked us to introduce customers to him, it’s only natural that we do our best!”
