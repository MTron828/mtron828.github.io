Translator: 5496903

“No one is to show any mercy. Tear her into pieces and sacrifice her spirit in heaven!”

In front of the Prodigy stage, the Prince of the Hanhai dynasty, the third dark horse, Han Mingshan, slowly placed Han Mingqing’s body on the ground and roared with a face full of killing intent.

“Yes!”

Around them, more than 30 people from the Hanhai dynasty surrounded Ling Jian ‘er, their faces filled with anger and killing intent.

In the center, Ling Jian ‘ER’s expression was still as cold as ever as she scanned her surroundings. There was not the slightest change in her expression.

Even though she had fallen into a desperate situation, she still did not make a move.

“Aooo!”

Little ha floated from Ling Jian ‘ER’s shoulder into the air, her cute little face revealing a fierce expression.

She was eager to protect her master.

“Make a move, kill!”

The surrounding people were silent as they stared at Ling Jian ‘er and the people from the Hanhai dynasty.

The water spirit Pearl in Han Mingshan’s hand spun in front of him, and his voice filled with killing intent resounded throughout the sky.

“There are so many men here, it’s not appropriate to bully a Lady!”

Just as he finished speaking, a voice rang out.

This stunned the people from the Hanhai Empire who were about to make a move. They looked at the voice with a cold expression.

Han Mingshan’s expression changed slightly. He turned his murderous gaze over.

“How embarrassing. To gang up on a girl, TSK TSK!”

A frivolous and disdainful voice was heard again.

The voice was naturally from Wang Xian. He floated in the air and walked slowly towards Ling Jian ‘er.

The surrounding people were also slightly stunned.

Who Dared to interfere in this matter?

Was he courting death?

This was the matter of the Hanhai Empire. Anyone who participated would be making an enemy out of the entire Hanhai Empire!

“Hiss... how... how could it be him!”

“The Nameless Heaven’s pride is actually the Nameless Heaven’s pride. What is he trying to do? Is He a hero saving the damsel in distress? Or did he know Ling Jian ‘ER in the past?”

“This... is the Nameless Heaven’s favorite trying to help Ling Jian ‘er?”

Everyone was stunned for a moment, and their faces were filled with shock.

They watched as Wang Xian flew to Ling Jian ‘ER’s side, and their eyes were wide open.

Ling Jian ‘ER’s eyes were filled with shock as well. She looked at Wang Xian, and there was an inexplicable glow in her eyes.

“Awooo!”

Xiao Ha, who was floating in the sky, blinked her eyes in confusion and called out excitedly.

“Nameless prodigy?”

When Han Mingshan saw Wang Xian’s figure, a cold glint flashed in his eyes. “Are you here to court death?”

Wang Xian looked at Han Mingshan and revealed a smile in his eyes. “It’s a pity that all of you don’t have the ability to do so!”

A sense of confidence and contempt was emitted from Wang Xian’s body.

This nonchalant aura that didn’t put the people from the Hanhai Empire in his eyes shocked everyone around him.

“As expected of a Nameless Heaven’s favorite. This aura is definitely not something that an ordinary person can possess!”

A young man looked at Wang Xian’s indifferent expression and was full of astonishment.

“Thank you!”

Ling Jian ‘ER’s eyes flickered as she looked at Wang Xian and said softly.

Wang Xian waved his hand as if he did not care at all.

“You don’t have the ability? Kid, you are too arrogant. Since you want to help this witch, you shall die with him!”

Around them, a young man from the Hanhai Empire roared with murderous intent in his eyes.

“Come on then. I really want to see how you guys are going to let me die. Haha!”

Wang Xian chuckled as he swept his gaze across more than 30 people around him.

“Hiss, this Nameless Heaven’s favorite is really going to help Ling Jian ‘er!”

“It’s hard to say now. It will be very difficult for the people from the Hanhai Empire to kill them!”

“Ling Jian ‘ER’s strength is ranked fourth on the prodigy roll. She can be said to be the strongest person below the profound void tier. It’s hard to say who Han Mingshan’s strength is. I don’t know who is stronger and who is weaker compared to the nameless prodigy. However, if Han Mingshan doesn’t face Ling Jian ‘er head-on, it will be very difficult for the other people of the Han Hai dynasty to kill Ling Jian ‘er even though they have more people!”

“I wonder what the relationship between this Nameless Heaven’s favorite and Ling Jian ‘ER is. After this incident, the Nameless Heaven’s favorite will definitely be hunted down by the Hanhai Empire.”

Everyone around looked at Wang Xian and discussed in hushed tones.

Han Mingshan stared at Wang Xian as his expression changed slightly. Han Mingqing’s death and the sudden appearance of the Nameless Heaven’s favorite.

This made him and the people from the Hanhai Empire not necessarily be able to keep him.

“If you dare to help Ling Jian ‘er, our Hanhai Empire will definitely not let you off in the future. You will be hunted down by the insightful emptiness realm experts of our Hanhai Empire!”

Han Mingshan stared at Wang Xian and threatened him. Then, he slowly took two steps forward.

“Haha, I took off my mask. Do you guys know who I am?”

When Wang Xian heard his threat, a teasing look appeared in his eyes.

“PFFT!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Wang Xian’s words almost made Han Mingshan vomit blood. Some of the people around him could not help but laugh.

“D * mn, what this Nameless Heaven’s favorite said makes sense. Once the mask is removed, no one will know that he is the Nameless Heaven’s favorite!”

“Haha, that’s right. This Nameless Heaven’s favorite is really hiding his merits and fame. D * mn, he’s Smart!”

Some of the young men could not help but laugh.

The faces of everyone from the Hanhai Empire turned even gloomier.

“Someone actually came out to help Ling Jian ‘er!”

At the side, Tang Ling ‘er saw the Nameless Heaven’s favorite who had suddenly appeared. She frowned slightly and said, “And it’s this guy who is hiding his face. He has already issued a challenge to me!”

“Ling ‘er, you shouldn’t be a match for him!”

When Tang Yuan heard her words, his eyes flickered as he stared at Wang Xian.

“A hateful guy who doesn’t dare to show his face to others!”

When she thought about how the Nameless Heaven’s favorite had already challenged her and she might not be a match for him, she felt even more hateful towards this nameless heaven’s favorite.

“Mu Yuan!”

Tang Yuan, who was at the side, appeared to be deep in thought. His lips moved slightly as he transmitted his voice to the young man who was holding the wooden sword.

The young man who was holding the wooden sword looked over and nodded his head slowly.

“Those who hide their heads and tails are either weak or ugly. I wonder which one you belong to!”

He held the wooden sword in his hand and stared at Wang Xian. Then, he slowly walked towards the center.

“It’s Mu Yuan. This... Mu Yuan is going to...”

“Another heaven’s pride expert has joined in. Furthermore, it’s Mu Yuan!”

“Han Mingshan, Mu Yuan, and the Nameless Heaven’s pride expert. These three are the three biggest dark horses on the heaven’s pride stage. Don’t tell me the three of them are going to fight!”

“This is going to be interesting. The three dark horses are going to fight. I really want to see who is stronger and who is weaker!”

When the crowd saw Mu Yuan, who was holding a wooden sword, walking out again and directly targeting the Nameless Heaven’s pride expert, they revealed an excited look on their faces.

“Then I might belong to the former. I’m very weak!”

When Wang Xian saw the young man who walked out all of a sudden, he still had a faint smile on his face as he replied calmly.

“Cool, this nameless prodigy is so humorous!”

“He’s a little handsome. I like humorous guys!”

Wang Xian’s reply caused some of the girls who were infatuated with him to sound infatuated.
