“Eh?”

The lady in the snow-white dress was slightly taken aback by her words. The people around her were also slightly taken aback!

“A private room?”

The lady who was talking to the lady was stunned. Her expression changed drastically.

“You guys have a private room? With your status, you still want to get a private room? What a joke!”

The Lady said with a cold smile on her face!

“Excuse me!”

Wang Xian watched from the side. He couldn’t help but pick up the card in his hand and waved his hand. Then, he walked to the side!

“Huh?”

When the girls saw Wang Xian walking over, they instinctively made way for him!

Crack

Wang Xian came to the front of the private room. He swiped the card in his hand and the door of the private room opened!

“Beautiful miss di Xing, please come in!”

Wang Xian pretended to be a gentleman and gestured to her with an invitation. He smiled and said that!

Miss di Xing could not help but smile and walked straight into the room!

“Pa!”

The door closed and the girls’expressions started to change!

“How could she get a private room? With her status...”

A lady couldn’t help but say!

The normal auction was fine, with their status they could get a private room, but this time they could get one?

This time, there was news from yesterday, there were a few powerful true treasures being sold, and one of them was a life saving true treasure!

This made many emperor court elders and even guards come!

Such an auction, the private rooms would naturally be reserved for the elders and guards, some undying level 7 or 8 warriors might not even be able to get one!

Yet they had a private room?

“It might be the private room they ordered in advance!”

The lady in the Snow White dress frowned, following which she didn’t take it to heart, walking straight to the seat beside her!

“How satisfying. I hate it the most when they act so high and mighty. HMPH!”

The Empress Star Lady entered the private room and said happily!

“Aren’t you going to thank us for our cooperation just now?”

Wang Xian smiled and sat at the side!

“Alright, Alright. Thank you, young master Wang Xian!”

The Empress Star Lady Smiled!

The two of them sat in the private room and waited quietly!

There were quite a number of people in this auction. With a glance, Wang Xian realized that there were about 70,000 to 80,000 godly king powerhouses!

There were some godly king powerhouses who could pose a slight threat to him!

The auction started very soon!

Items were auctioned one after another. The items that were auctioned at the beginning had also attracted quite a lot of competition!

The soul-returning fluid, life force fluid, and other items were considered the final items. They would only be auctioned at the end!

Wang Xian had been waiting all this while. Di Xing ‘er did not bid for any items either!

“It’s about to arrive. This time, many important figures of the imperial court have come for your treasures!”

Two hours later, the final few items finally arrived!

“There are a total of six ultimate treasures at the finale of this auction. The auction will start from the sixth item!”

“The sixth ultimate treasure, ingesting the ordinary fluid. Ingesting the ordinary fluid will allow any non-sentient creature to gain sentience. Even if it’s an ordinary flower or grass, a drop of it will give birth to sentience!”

“Giving it to one’s battle pet can give birth to sentience, just like a heavenly demon. There’s one more thing. Grandmaster di has guessed that if a person consumes it, it can increase one’s comprehension. It’s a rare treasure!”

“The starting bid is 100 cubic god Stones!”

The six treasures were the elixir of life, eternal flame, and Nirvana Lightning. The Elixir of life and the soul returning liquid were Wang Xian’s items. The remaining one should be the original treasure!

One side of the Divine Stone started the bidding. The other side was a unit. One side of the divine stone could buy 10 level 5 immortal king elixirs!

This starting price was not low, but it was still a world treasure!

“110!”

The auction started and soon, someone started bidding. In the end, the eternal flame was bought by an imperial court powerhouse with 500 divine stones!

The next item to be auctioned was the eternal flame, eternal flame. It could change a person’s physique and give him a powerful fire attribute physique. His cultivation speed would increase by a few times!

The starting price of the eternal flame was much higher. The starting price was 1,000 cubes!

Furthermore, the eternal flame caused a commotion in the entire auction. Many experts were bidding!

...

In the end, the price was set at 12,000 cubes!

“I have enough resources to break through on my own!”

Wang Xian calculated the resources that were exchanged for 12,000 cubes of divine stones. His eyes were flashing with excitement!

“The next item to be auctioned is the nirvana lightning liquid. The effect of this nirvana lightning liquid is similar to that of the eternal flame. The only difference is the Lightning attribute!”

The auction of the Nirvana Lightning liquid began. This time, the price of the Nirvana Lightning liquid was much higher than that of the eternal flame. 18,000 cubic god stones were sold!

“There are still the last three items which grandmaster di considered the most precious. We will start from the third item!”

“After consuming a drop of life force liquid, anyone below void God Emperor will be able to instantly recover no matter how serious their injuries are. It is equivalent to a Second Life!”

The third treasure, life force liquid, was given by Grandmaster di to a higher position than endless flame and the others!

This treasure was equivalent to a second life. It could instantly recover to its peak. It was definitely a powerful treasure!

The starting price of the life force liquid was 20,000 cubes, and in the end, it was bought by a person in a private room for 25,000 cubes!

“The one who made a move just now seems to be Protector Abyss!”

...

“It should be protector abyss. Protector Abyss is an existence at the peak of the godly monarch realm. This kind of treasure is very important to experts at this level!”

After the sale of the life force liquid, some people whispered among themselves!

“The protector has made his move. If it wasn’t for the protector, the price might be higher!”

In the private room, Emperor Star Lady Whispered!

“It’s alright. This price is already pretty good!”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes slightly. He was indeed very satisfied with this price!

“But there’s actually a treasure that is even more valuable than the vitality liquid. I wonder what it is!”

He muttered!

“The second true treasure is an offensive god weapon, it’s called the killing gourd. Within the gourd, one can nurture sword energy. When the sword energy is released, it has the destructive power of a pinnacle undying god King!”

At this time, the last true treasure was taken out!

On the stage, an old man held an ancient green gourd in his hand. The gourd looked extremely ordinary! RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

However, when the old man opened the lid, an incomparably sharp blade energy floated above!

The blade energy was green and revealed an incomparably sharp blade energy, it was almost bone piercing!

“This immortal slaying gourd can produce a blade energy within 10 years, the blade energy can be accumulated!”

“Also, with the wind laws, it can increase the speed of the blade energy, such a treasure is extremely powerful!”

The old man continued his introduction!

“So powerful. Doesn’t that mean that the eternal god Lord can kill a Level 7 or 8 immortal king expert with it?”

In the private room, Emperor Star Lady exclaimed in shock!

“I can’t do it. The sword qi is too sharp. Anyone below level 5 immortal king would find it hard to withstand this bone-piercing sword light. However, this immortal slaying calabash is indeed a rare treasure!”

Wang Xian said slowly as he stared at the immortal slaying Calabash with a twinkle in his eyes!
