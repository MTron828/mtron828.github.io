Chapter 788: 0789 Dragon Gate Auction 2

Translator: 549690339

“Dragon King, Look, this is our Dragon Gate auction house. The entire auction house is divided into three levels, and it can seat three thousand people!”

“The equipment inside are all made by the puppet immortal sect. Everything is very convenient.”

“In addition, there are two shops next to the auction house. One is a spirit tool shop, and the other is a medicinal pill shop. This can also be considered as the main shop of our refining workshop!”

“Dragon King, you need to take out some spiritual weapons and elixirs and place them in the shop. The items placed in the shop must not conflict with the items being auctioned. However, there must be a treasure that can protect the shop!”

Upon arriving at the floating island, Mo Qinglong introduced the items to Wang Xian. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Wang Xian sized up the entire floating island and nodded his head in satisfaction.

This island was snatched away by the celestial puppet sect in the beginning. After that, it was sent over obediently.

Wang Xian took a liking to the powerful puppet techniques of the celestial puppet sect. They used it to build special houses and items. It was definitely dozens of times better than modern buildings.

Hence, Wang Xian gave the celestial puppet sect some rewards and asked them to help build it.

The celestial puppet sect was naturally very willing to help.

The eastern half of the floating island was built into a dragon gate auction house. The western part was built into a place for leisure.

In the future, when he went out to sea, he didn’t need to use ships anymore. He could directly control the floating island to float.

“Alright, let me make some preparations!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. With a move of his body, he circled around the floating island.

Three days passed in an instant. During these three days, Wang Xian received a piece of good news.

A Jiaya had broken through to the immortal realm.

Originally, she was in the infant stage. Her body still contained a majestic fire attribute energy that she had yet to digest. After experiencing many fortuitous encounters, she had also taken this step.

Wang Xian was not too surprised that a Jiaya had entered the immortal stage.

Now, Lan Qingyue and Sun Lingxiu could also enter the immortal stage at any time. The same was true for the nine-headed Hui.

Next was ao shrimps and ao nu!

In the Dragon Palace, there were at least four to five other people who could enter the immortal stage at any time.

Moreover, after the corpse of an immortal-level aquatic creature was sent back to the Dragon Palace, it would soon be able to give birth to one or even two immortal gods in the Dragon Palace.

Soon, the immortal gods of the Dragon Palace would be close to twenty.

“Is the floating island of the Dragon Gate in front of us? This is the legendary island!”

“The Dragon Gate auction. This time, I want to auction a grade-7 medicinal pill. As long as I have this Grade-7 medicinal pill, I will be able to break through to the infant realm!”

“I want to buy an earth star fish as a gift for my great grandfather. Haha!”

“This Dragon Gate’s auction is simply too grand. It’s an immortal-level spirit weapon. Five of them will be auctioned at once, and there are three sets of spirit weapon sets. Dragon Gate is simply too rich!”

“Look, those are the immortal gods and disciples of the Natural Born Immortal sect. I heard that Dragon Gate and the natural born immortal sect are cooperating. In the future, Dragon Gate’s forging workshop will provide spirit herbs!”

“Those are the leaders of the Ming King Immortal sect and the Puppet Immortal Sect!”

“There are also immortal gods from the Xuan Yuan clan!”

“So many immortal gods are here!”

Three days later, in the early morning, the Dragon Gate auction had already caused an uproar on the Jianghu website for the past three days.

The Dragon Gate auction was the first auction in the history of all the immortal sects. It was also the most grand auction.

It was a celestial artifact, a level-12 spirit artifact set, and a level-7 elixir. With such an item, it was enough to attract the attention of the immortals.

Furthermore, during these three days, the Dragon Gate auction also collected a lot of treasures that were put up for auction.

As an auction house, it wasn’t just the auction house that auctioned the items themselves. In fact, most of the auction houses only auctioned the items sent by others.

Although most of the items in the Dragon Gate auction house were taken out by Wang Xian himself, he had also collected quite a number of high-value items.

He would take a certain amount of commission to help them conduct the auction.

The precious treasures and three days of publicity had attracted all the disciples of the immortal sects and even the immortals.

In the morning, there were even many disciples of the immortal sects who came to the floating island.

Wang Xian stood beside the entrance of the Floating Island and looked at the immortals who had entered with a smile.

In just half an hour, seven immortals from the immortal sects had arrived.

One could imagine the attraction of the immortal artifacts, spirit qi sets, and grade-7 elixirs.

Around them, the members of the Dragon Gate were guarding each and every position to ensure their safety. Ao Jian was also in charge. No one dared to cause trouble here.

The floating island was considered the territory of the Dragon Gate, so the immortal god of the Dragon Gate could make a move directly.

“The two shops next to the auction house can buy pills and spirit tools. Moreover, if you have the materials, you can help forge them for free. Two sets of metal materials can be used to forge one spirit tool, three sets of spirit herbs, and four pills for you. It’s simply too suitable!”

“I heard that in the future, the Dragon Gate will open a forging shop in the real cities next to the major cities of the immortal gate. You can buy fifth, sixth, and even seventh grade pills there. The same is true for spirit tools. In addition, you can also bring your own materials!”

The Immortal God of the Wild Beast Immortal sect led the second-ranked Heaven’s favorite, Shou Tian, and a dozen disciples into the floating island. A disciple said with a twinkle in his eyes.

Their Wild Beast Immortal sect was very powerful, but they were not very good at alchemy and refining tools. As a result, they were in urgent need of spirit tools and medicinal pills.

“If it’s really at this price, then it’s very suitable. This auction will see if there are any spirit tools that are suitable for me. If there aren’t, then I can only find materials for the Dragon Gate forging workshop to refine!”

The tall and sturdy immortal god slowly nodded his head.

“The Earth Star Fish is sold in that shop. They can be exchanged with medicinal pills and spirit herbs at the same price, or they can be bought with spirit stones. There are a total of 500 of them. It’s simply too crazy!”

“The Dragon Gate is simply too rich. No wonder they can nurture so many powerful disciples. With such resources and fewer than a hundred disciples, they can naturally nurture many infant realm cultivators!”

“Oh my God, did you hear that? The shop that sells spiritual artifacts has a grade-13 spiritual artifact. It’s too awesome. They took out a celestial artifact and sold it at a marked price without even auctioning it!”

Exclamations and exclamations could be heard one after another. Everyone rushed towards the Earth Star Fish Shop, the spiritual artifact shop, and the elixir shop.

This floating island was simply a treasure trove. Even the eyes of the Celestials were burning with passion. They were itching to snatch it away!

Soon, five to six thousand people gathered on the floating island.

This was because of the requirements set by Wang Xian.

If one wanted to enter the floating island, one had to fulfill one of two conditions.

The first was to possess the strength of at least half-step infant realm.

The second condition was to possess 50,000 spirit stones or items worth 50,000 spirit stones.

Otherwise, more than 100,000 people or even more would pour into the floating island.

After all, the Dragon Gate auction was currently the most grand auction in the pugilistic world, with the highest value of items.

“Hehe, after this auction, the resources I will obtain will at least be able to rise to the level of a highlevel immortal. At that time, among all the immortal sects, there will be no more than five people who can match my fighting strength!”
