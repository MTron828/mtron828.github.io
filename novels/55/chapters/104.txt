Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“Get out of the way. Can those two students give up their seats?”

The instructor yelled at Wang Xian and Wang Dahai as he carried the student over.

“She must have fainted from the heatstroke!”

Wang Dahai was shocked as he stood up hastily and gave up his seat.

Wang Xian also stood up when he saw the instructor lay the girl down on the ground.

At this time, two doctors ran over.

Apart from the school doctors, the regular hospital doctors were present during the military training at the University of Rivertown to prevent any accidents.

Two doctors, a middle-aged man and a 27 to 28-year-old female doctor, sprinted over.

“Doctor Sun, let me take a look first. She must be suffering from heatstroke!” said the middle-aged school doctor to Doctor Sun as he carried his medical equipment.

“Sure, Doctor Song, you can examine her first.” Doctor Sun nodded.

At this time, Wang Xian felt Wang Dahai tugging his arm. He peered over with doubt. Wang Dahai was pouting his lips in a direction.

Wang Xian looked over.

That doctor was about 28 years old. She wore a white gown that couldn’t hide her bosomy figure. Her white gown was pushed up at the chest area.

She had a fair and refined profile. With bun-up hair, she looked just like a goddess.

Wang Xian was in a stupor for a moment as he found her familiar. He then recalled the same Doctor Sun at the previous accident the other time.

“Her body feels hot, it doesn’t seem like she got heatstroke!”

The anxious voice of the middle-aged school doctor was heard, “Give her some cold water before we apply some medicine on her!”

“She’s not having a heatstroke? Didn’t the students have their check-up in advance? Check her heartbeat to see if there are any problems.” Doctor Sun continued, “Let me do it since it’s more appropriate.”

“Sure!” The middle-aged school doctor agreed immediately while Doctor Sun took over.

Doctor Sun took out her stethoscope immediately and placed it at the girl’s chest area.

“Gosh, her heart is beating very slowly!” Doctor Sun’s expression had a drastic change. She flipped the eyelid of the girl, “Her eyes are red. This is not a heat stroke.”

“Her breathing is weak. We must send her to the hospital immediately!” said the middle-aged school doctor as he placed his finger on the girl’s nose.

“What’s going on? Is she alright?” Just then, two school in-charges rushed over and consulted.

“It’s not a heat stroke. It should be some other illness. We need to get her to the hospital now for an examination!” the middle-aged school doctor replied immediately.

“How serious!” The two school teachers frowned.

“Hurry, get the car now. We’re sending her to the hospital before it’s too late!” Upon seeing the motionless girl, Doctor Sun spoke anxiously.

“Okay, I’ll get the car now,” said the two school teachers who were panicked too.

The impact would be huge if students had any accidents during military training in school.

“Let me take a look.” At this time, Wang Xian spoke when he saw the frail-looking girl.

“You...” Upon hearing Wang Xian, everyone turned to look at him.

“Don’t you fool around...” said the middle-aged school doctor impatiently as he realized how young and inexperienced Wang Xian was.

“Wait, you...” Doctor Sun looked at Wang Xian as she observed him carefully with a pair of refined eyes. “You were the one in that accident...”

“Yes, let me take a look!” Wang Xian nodded and said to Doctor Sun.

“Okay, go ahead.”

Radiance flickered in the eyes of Doctor Sun as she stared at Wang Xian with curiosity.

Previously, they did a detailed examination of the young men and the young lady from the car accident back in the hospital.

What shocked all of them in the hospital was that the broken leg of the young girl had miraculously healed by itself.

On the other hand, the young man’s injuries were even more severe as his ribs were fractured. Yet, the bones had been fixed in some unique way.

It was shocking to all the doctors. Such a situation could be considered a miracle in the medical field.

When Doctor Sun learned about the report, the first thing she thought of was that juvenile. She did not expect to meet him here.

The middle-aged school doctor and the two school teachers were slightly stunned by what Doctor Sun had said. But they did not stop him.

“I’ll do it!”

However, a juvenile in his military uniform walked out suddenly just when Wang Xian stood up.

The juvenile was 1.8 meters tall, looking cheerful and handsome. His confident vibe was even more intense when he was in a military training outfit.

“Out of my way. Let me do it!” The juvenile looked at Wang Xian and spoke immediately while he fished out an ID from his right pocket.

“This is?”

The middle-aged school doctor opened his eyes wide with a shocked expression. He exclaimed, “Sacred Followers Guild, Medical Saint!”

“I’m not a Medical Saint yet. I’m just an apprentice.”

The juvenile gave a faint smile as he held his chin high when he heard the exclamation from the middle-aged school doctor.

Confident, handsome, imposing!

“Unexpected. Unexpected!”

The middle-aged school doctor was overwhelmed with surprise. “Little Miracle Doctor, come and take a look!”

“Sacred Followers Guild!” Doctor Sun was also taken aback as she gazed at the juvenile.

Sacred Followers Guild was one of the two sacred places in the medical industry.

Almost everyone in the medical industry knew about Sacred Followers Guild. At the same time, all the medical students were hoping to have a chance to learn in the sacred place.

However, only very few doctors managed to pass the test.

Any apprentices who walked out from the Sacred Followers Guild were equipped with formidable medical skills.

The middle-aged school doctor spoke respectfully to the juvenile, and the juvenile was enjoying such treatment. He wriggled his finger, and the silver needles appeared in his hand.

“Awesome!”

The middle-aged school doctor was amazed by the appearance of the silver needles.

“Excuse me.”

The juvenile pushed Wang Xian away and squatted down immediately.

“Little Miracle Doctor, please take a look at this student to see what’s wrong with her,” said the two school teachers respectfully. Apparently, they had heard of the reputation of the Sacred Followers Guild.

“Okay, don’t worry. If it’s not something serious, I can cure her with a silver needle!”

The juvenile drew his lips and spoke confidently.

“That’ll do!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The two teachers heaved a sigh of relief as they smiled. Then they looked at Wang Xian and Wang Dahai who were gathering around them. “Two of you, please give way. Don’t interrupt the Little Miracle Doctor while he is treating!”

“Sacred Followers Guild!”

Wang Xian took two steps back as he gazed at the juvenile with surprise.

He had heard Old Xue mentioning the Sacred Followers Guild. They were like the ultimate existence in the entire medical industry.

The members of Sacred Followers Guild came from a mix of the underworld and society. Some of them were commoners while some were Martial Artists.

However, the majority of them were mainly Martial Artists since they would circulate their Internal Energy during their treatment.

The juvenile placed his hand on the young girl’s hand and closed his eyes.

“Hur?” The juvenile knit his eyebrow slightly.

“What is it, Little Miracle Doctor? Is her illness serious?” asked the two teachers when they saw the juvenile frowning.

“It’s a little tricky!” In a flash, the juvenile took the silver needle in his hand and inserted it into one of the acupoints on the girl’s arm.

“I can treat her, but it will take some time!”
