Chapter 1007: Was 1008 convinced

“Yes, be careful!”

Wang Xian nodded his head lightly and looked at the supernatural level five Demon Beast, the wind-winged savage fish.

Compared to the ferocious beast, there wasn’t much difference in intelligence.

Wang Xian waved his arm and kept it into his interspatial ring.

“You... how did you discover that there was a wind-winged Savage Fish Demon Beast There?”

Zhang Fengying nodded at the girl apologetically. She came to Wang Xian’s side and asked in astonishment.

“With my eyes!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly.

“Who are you lying to!”

Zhang Fengying glared at Wang Xian in disbelief.

“Eh... I didn’t see it with my eyes. How could I know where it is!”

“Let’s go, continue!”

Wang Xian said in a speechless manner.

Zhang Fengying’s expression changed.

“You saved Xiao Ying’s life just now. I’ll count it as your win for 10 times. We’ll win 13 to 10!”

She said to Wang Xian with a dark expression.

Wang Xian smiled and looked at the spot in front of him. His eyes were sparkling.

“Hmph, you’re so arrogant after winning. Just you wait!”

Zhang Fengying waited for Wang Xian. Her face was filled with displeasure as she looked ahead again.

“Stop!”

After walking for a few hundred meters, Wang Xian said to all of them.

“What’s wrong, Captain Wang?”

“Did you notice it again? There aren’t any ferocious beasts 500 meters ahead?”

Zhang Fengying’s expression changed slightly. She stared at Wang Xian and said.

The people behind also looked at Wang Xian in astonishment.

“You guys, that, that and that!”

Wang Xian did not answer them. He pointed to Ao Yao and the rest who were beside him and said.

“Yes, leader!”

Ao Jian and the rest nodded their heads.

Wang Xian looked ahead and pointed the lightning wood in his hand at the bottom of the sea!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Rays of light that were accompanied by lightning instantly spread forward at a terrifying speed.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

Zhang Fengying, the amethyst mercenary group, and the Void Beast mercenary group all stared at Wang Xian’s hand movements closely.

At this moment, one by one, the caracal boas were entangled by thorns and crawled out of the cave.

At the back of the cave, there was an extraordinary level six demon beast, the wind-winged savage fish.

“Golden Light Spike!”

Ao Jian and the other barren swordfish waved their longswords and rays of golden light instantly penetrated into the heads of the Jinlin Boa and the wind-winged savage fish.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian said to them and walked straight ahead.

Everyone widened their eyes. Zhang Fengying had an incredulous look on her face. She looked at the corpses of the ferocious beasts on the ground and then at Wang Xian.

“How did you find them?”

Zhang Fengying walked to Wang Xian’s side and asked while staring at him.

“My Eyes, Big Sister!”

Wang Xian looked at her and replied truthfully.

“How is that possible? How can the eyes see them? They were clearly in the cave and were hidden so well. How can they see them?”

Zhang Fengying got closer with a face full of disbelief.

When Wang Xian saw the hot figure right in front of him, the corner of his mouth twitched. “Maybe it’s because of my good eyesight!”

Zhang Fengying’s expression changed. She knew that this was his secret and it was impossible for her to tell him.

“This... is considered a truce!”

Zhang Fengying’s face darkened as she looked at Wang Xian and said.

“Let’s keep moving!”

Wang Xian looked around and continued to walk towards the center.

Zhang Fengying, who was at the side, looked around from time to time. She sized up Wang Xian from time to time.

The people from the amethyst mercenary group and the Void Beast mercenary group behind him were also stunned. They followed behind him in astonishment.

“This is too amazing. They are so far away and they are even hiding in the cave. How did leader Wang manage to do it?”

“It is quite abnormal. He discovered the ferocious beasts hidden below five to six hundred meters away. This time, leader Wang might be able to lead us to the windwing Savage Fish’s treasure!”

A few young men from the Void Beast mercenary group looked at Wang Xian with admiration and discussed in a low voice.

The eyes of the group of girls at the side flickered as well.

This was especially so for the girl who had just been rescued by Wang Xian. She didn’t believe Wang Xian’s words just now. If it weren’t for him, she would probably be dead by now.

“Huh?”

After walking for seven to eight thousand meters, Wang Xian suddenly discovered a location below them. A windwing savage fish was following them.

However, this wind-wing savage fish was in a passage under the sea.

Its body was stuck to the soil. It was obvious that it was listening to the sound of Wang Xian’s footsteps.

These wind-wing savage fish are really smart. Perhaps they have been fighting with the mercenary group for the past few years. Their intelligence is getting higher and higher

Wang Xian thought to himself and stopped walking.

“What’s wrong, Wang Group? Are there more ferocious beasts lying in ambush ahead?”

Seeing that Wang Xian had stopped, elder Zeng looked at him in astonishment as well. His gaze was fixed on the underwater caves ahead.

Zhang Fengying’s gaze was fixed on those caves. A green glow shot out from her eyes. It was obvious that she had unleashed her ocular arts to the maximum.

“Bang!”

The lightning struck wood in Wang Xian’s hand landed on the ground. He waved his arm forcefully.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

The sound of a violent collision suddenly came from under their feet. This caused their expressions to change drastically.

“Boom!”

The ground split open instantly. An extraordinary level six wind-wing savage fish was tied up by Wang Xian with thorns.

“Damn humans, I’m going to kill you all!”

The wind-wing savage fish was tied up all over. Its pair of blood-red eyes stared at Wang Xian. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Bang!”

Wang Xian struck the lightning wood in his hand and killed it instantly.

“This...”

Elder Zeng was stunned. Zhang Fengying, who was at the side, widened her eyes in disbelief.

“You... you actually discovered the demonic beasts hidden under our feet. How... How did you do it!”

This was the first time she felt defeated.

When Wang Xian stopped earlier, she was still looking ahead. However, she did not expect him to discover the wind-winged savage fish underground.

The underground was the cave passage of the wind-wing savage fish. He had also learned about it from the information.

The passage was at least two to three meters thick from the ground.

It was difficult for the wind-wing savage fish to launch a sneak attack from the ground after two to three meters.

In the end, a wind-wing savage fish was brought up directly from the passage below.

How did he do it?

Zhang Fengying looked at Wang Xian’s feet and wondered if he had eyes on his feet.

“Let’s go, Big Sister!”

Wang Xian looked at Zhang Fengying, who was looking at him expectantly. His face was filled with smiles.

Big Sister?

She was just a big sister, but now she had become a big sister!

She couldn’t leave this big sister behind no matter what!

Zhang Fengying’s expression changed. This was a blatant insult.

“Leader Wang, you are simply too powerful!”

“Not only powerful, you are practically invincible. Even the demonic beasts below us can discover you!”

“Haha, with leader Wang, we will definitely be able to return with a full load!”

The group of young men from the Void Beast mercenary group said with a fawning expression.

Even some of the girls were staring at Wang Xian’s figure with twinkling stars in their eyes.

“Be on high alert!”

Zhang Fengying growled with an embarrassed expression. When everyone saw her sullen face, they shrunk their heads slightly and stopped talking.

“Leader... leader Wang, how did you do it?”

She couldn’t help but walk over and ask again.

“Call Me Big Brother!”

Wang Xian said faintly.

“Big Brother!”

She gritted her teeth!

“Are you convinced?”

“I’m convinced!”!
