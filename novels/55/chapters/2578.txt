2579 2579 abyss seed lair

“Hehe!”

Looking at the disappearing figure of the ancestor of the ninth-grade heaven sect, he smiled gently!

“Dragon King, let the leader of the three seas sect escape. Kill the rest. There are a total of 303 immortal godly monarchs and four level six immortal godly monarchs!”

Ao Qitian flew over and reported to Wang Xian!

“HMM, very good. Put away their corpses. We will continue to hunt for Abyss Seeds!”

Wang Xian nodded his head!

The arrival of the five forces from the ninth-grade sky sect had brought Wang Xian and the rest quite a good harvest!

Out of more than a hundred immortal king corpses, there were five level six immortal king corpses!

These resources could definitely add another level seven immortal king warrior to the Dragon Palace!

“As long as there are seven to eight level seven immortal King Warriors in the Dragon Palace, we can consider annihilating the ninth-grade sky sect!”

Wang Xian mumbled!

Seven to eight level seven immortal King Level Masters, together with the array formation, could kill four to five level seven immortal King Level Masters!

Now, he could increase the resources in his hands by two. The Sky Formation would be guarding the Dragon Star. Excluding him, he also needed five level seven immortal king level resources!

“I hope I can gather all the resources within half a year. Then, I can make my move!”

He moved and led the members of the Dragon Palace to fly in another direction!

In the next month, Wang Xian and the rest used the dragon blood to continue to attract the abyssal seeds!

For a whole month, they obtained a lot of harvest again!

With all the resources in their hands, they could create three immortal king level seven powerhouses!

“This kind of harvest is fast, but it’s also slow!”

A month later, Wang Xian looked at the harvest in his hands!

This kind of improvement was extremely terrifying to any force!

“It’s still a little weak. If I encounter a larger abyssal race, I can only escape!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows as he thought of the situation he had encountered during this month!

Once the number of abyssal races reached more than 100,000, most of them were led by Level 7 immortal king level abyssal races!

With Wang Xian and the rest’s strength, they could only retreat when faced with such a race!

It was all because they were too weak!

“Dragon King, something has happened on our side!”

At this moment, ao Yao’s figure flew over quickly and said to Wang Xian!

“HMM? What’s the situation?”

He raised his eyebrows and asked immediately!

“Dragon King, we found an incomparably huge mountain peak there. There are many holes in the mountain peak. We found the existence of abyss seeds inside!”

Ao Yao reported immediately!

“Bring Me There!”

Wang Xian flew over immediately!

“This is?”

When he arrived, he looked at the huge mountain peak in front of him with a shocked expression!

The entire mountain peak was about 200 to 300 million kilometers in size under Wang Xian’s perception. He could not tell how big the diameter was!

The pitch-black mountain peak stood in the middle of the abyss. It looked exceptionally spectacular!

On this towering and huge mountain peak, there were numerous densely packed holes. Some of the holes were big while others were small!

One could see some abyss species entering and exiting from the inside!

“This is? This is a large-scale abyss species!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly. His eyes were flashing with a fiery glow!

Encountering such a large-scale abyss species, and one that had its own territory, was both a danger and an opportunity!

Once he could hunt down this large-scale abyssal race, the rewards would be abnormally terrifying!

“Take out the dragon’s blood immediately. Let’s see if we can attract some here!”

“Also, call Ao Qitian and the rest over!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly!

If the dragon’s blood could attract the abyssal races inside, he could hunt them down continuously!

There was no need to spend a lot of time to search for them!

Moreover, according to Wang Xian’s estimation, the number of abyssal seeds in this race was definitely not small. There should be hundreds of thousands of them!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao nodded. Soon, all the members of the Dragon Palace gathered!

Splash

...

Wang Xian waved his arm and a pool of Dragon’s blood was placed in front of him!

“Hide yourself!”

He whispered and immediately hid himself. He stared at the spot in front of him!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

“Squeak! Squeak!”

“Quack! Quack! Quack!”

Very soon, it was so fast that Wang Xian and the rest were astonished!

One by one, abyssal seeds flew out from the mountain peak. Their burning eyes flew towards the direction of the Dragon’s blood!

“Quack! Quack! Quack!”

A powerful abyssal seed spread its wings and flew towards them at a terrifying speed!

“Roar!”

...

However, at this moment, an abyssal seed that was like a round ball flew over at an even more terrifying speed and crashed into another one!

“Bang!”

The tremendous force immediately sent it flying!

Behind him, more than 10,000 abyssal seeds poked out from within, exuding a deathly silent and terrifying power!

“There are immortal king level seven abyssal seeds, and there are even two of them!”

Wang Xian frowned slightly when he saw the spherical abyssal seeds and the abyssal seeds that were filled with bone spikes behind them!

“We can’t be defeated. Let’s go, let’s escape!”

Wang Xian did not hesitate and immediately ordered all the members of the Dragon Palace!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Ga Ga Ga!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

However, the moment they moved, the abyssal seeds behind them sensed them and let out roars!

The round abyssal seed at the front flew to the side of the Dragon’s blood and devoured it immediately. Then, it stared at Wang Xian and the rest who were escaping with its bloodthirsty eyes!

“Roar! Roar!”

The next moment, it let out a wild roar and chased after them from behind!

“Oh no, they are catching up. Speed Up!”

When Wang Xian saw the abyssal seed chasing after them, the tens of thousands of abyssal seeds behind him did not hesitate and chased after them directly!

Wang Xian thought to himself, this is not good. Energy enveloped the members of the Dragon Palace and they joined in immediately!

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

“Roar! Roar!”

However, the abyssal seed behind him didn’t give up. It let out a furious roar and chased after him closely!

“These guys!”

Wang Xian fled for half an hour. When he saw the two of them following closely behind him, he looked a little embarrassed!

“Get Out!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled. After hesitating for a moment, he flew towards the exit!

He was prepared to return to the Dragon Palace to increase the strength of the Dragon Palace and convert all the resources into combat strength!

Behind him, the two level 7 abyss seeds of the Eternal Celestial Master chased after him for a full 20 hours before they finally stopped!

In the middle of the chase, Wang Xian had no choice but to keep ao Yao and the rest into the mother nest!

Twenty hours later, Wang Xian’s face was pitch black as he slowed down his speed. Fortunately, he was at level seven immortal king. If he was at level eight, he would be doomed!

“Phew, let’s go out First!”

Wang Xian exhaled heavily and continued to head towards the exit!

After staying in there for two months, he was still about five hours away from the exit!

“Eh?”

Just as Wang Xian was about to reach the exit, he met some familiar figures!

Looking at the group of people that were tens of millions of kilometers to his right, his eyes were sparkling!

Tianshan Sword sect!
