Chapter 1169: 1170 Dragon Thorns

Translator: 5496903

“They have left!”

In the restaurant, Feng Luan looked at the position of the Mayor’s residence. She looked at the four figures that were disappearing quickly and said to Wang Xian calmly.

“It seems that the country is still more important than my son!”

Wang Xian stood beside her and said with a smile.

“The main reason is that the dragon thorns are too powerful. The deviant demons are too powerful!”

Feng Luan Sighed.

Feng Luan was very clear about the power of the dragon spike. What made her most envious was the strange demons.

There were more than 170 strange demons. Among them, there were around 150 that could assassinate rank 8 transcendents and 20 that could assassinate rank 9 transcendents.

One that could assassinate a half-step void interpretation expert.

Such a terrifying assassin, if placed in a small country, would definitely cause the entire kingdom to be on tenterhooks.

Even in the current dragon-phoenix Empire, the dragon spike could cause the entire dragon-phoenix empire to be in darkness.

It wouldn’t be long before the citizens of the dragon-phoenix Empire fled to other places.

Wang Xian revealed a smile. “Your subordinates are also very terrifying.”

He looked at the four figures that had disappeared with his bewitching eyes and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

“If nothing goes wrong, star-moon kingdom will be under the control of the Dragon Thorns in the future!”

“I’ll try my best to cover the entire star-moon kingdom within a few months!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he took out his communication stone plate with a smile on his face and sent a message to the DRAKONIDS.

“Continue the mission!”

The mission continued.

After the nine DRAKONIDS received the message, they didn’t hesitate at all. They immediately sent the message through the communication channel of the Dragon Thorns assassin organization.

“Damn, the dragon Spike has resumed the mission, what are they doing?”

“No Way, four insightful void realm experts just came to Bright Moon City with the Holy Killing Order, and they still dare to accept the mission. My God, what is the dragon spike doing? They don’t even put the four insightful void realm experts in their eyes?”?

“This... this...”

When those clans and mercenary groups with the dragon Spike’s contact information received the message from the dragon assassin organization, their faces revealed a look of disbelief.

What the hell was this?

Was the dragon Spike planning to commit a crime against the wind?

Did they think that they could fight against six or even seven insightful emptiness realm experts in the city?

“This... does the dragon spike have a trump card to fight against insightful emptiness realm experts? Otherwise, why would he still dare to commit a crime against the wind at this time?”

The people of Bright Moon City revealed a look of shock and bewilderment.

“Should we give it a try?”

Within a mercenary group, an old man revealed a hesitant expression.

“Let’s just wait!”

In the end, no one dared to hire the dragon assassin group at this juncture.

Time passed very quickly. The night passed once again. The Sky cleared up and the sun rose into the sky. The warm sunlight illuminated the entire bright moon city.

The entire bright moon city was incomparably calm.

“The curfew has been lifted!”

“The city seal has been lifted!”

In the early morning, the city guards’voices rang out within Bright Moon City.

This caused all the citizens of bright moon city to reveal astonished expressions.

“This... What’s going on? All the curfews have been lifted, and the patrolling soldiers are clearly gone, and the city guards have also decreased by a lot!”

“Didn’t the four experts come yesterday with the Holy Killing Order? Logically speaking, they should be dealing with the dragon spike by today at the latest, so why isn’t there any movement at all?”

Everyone was somewhat stupefied. Yesterday, the four insightful emptiness realm experts had arrived domineeringly, but after that, there wasn’t the slightest reaction.

It was as if they hadn’t arrived.

In fact, even the restrictions within the city had been removed, and the city protection array that had been opened with all its might had been directly shut down.

This situation caused everyone to feel somewhat stupefied.

“Could it be... could it be that the dragon spike has really caused star-moon kingdom to bow its head? The dragon Spike had assassinated the third Prince!”

When everyone thought of the dragon Spike resuming its mission last night, they were all stunned, and their eyes revealed a look of disbelief.

Other than the dragon spike causing star-moon kingdom to bow its head, they could not think of any other answer.

However, star-moon kingdom lowering its head and submitting was a little shocking to everyone.

Killing the third prince was nothing.

What kind of power could cause the star-moon kingdom to not even take revenge on their own son?

“This dragon spike is too terrifying!”

Some people looked at each other, shock appearing in their eyes.

“What does star-moon kingdom mean?”

Within the city Lord’s Manor, the long-haired master of undercurrent stared at City Lord Liu with Bloodshot eyes as he roared in a low voice filled with anger.

“Undercurrent, the king didn’t even take revenge on the third prince. What do you mean?”

City Lord Liu saw the master of undercurrent staring at him and angrily questioned him, and he said coldly with an unhappy face.

Even the third prince was killed, and the King didn’t take revenge. So what if you, the son of an undercurrent assassin organization, was killed?

What did it mean?

The master of Undercurrent’s expression changed slightly, and his body trembled slightly. His heart was filled with endless anger.

All this while, even when he had just been slapped in the face by the dragon spike, he had never been so angry.

At this moment, he could no longer hold it in. The city Lord’s mansion prohibited him from providing any information about the master of undercurrent.

If he wanted to deal with the dragon spike, he had to rely on himself.

Rely on himself?

He was the leader of the Master of undercurrent. He knew how difficult it was to deal with an assassin organization, especially this dragon assassin organization.

If he didn’t have the assistance of the city Lord’s mansion, it would be impossible for him to deal with the dragon spike.

“HMPH!”

Undercurrent master’s face was filled with frost. His body moved, and he directly flew out.

Everyone thought that he was a madman, but a madman was able to become a powerful insightful void expert. The leader of the assassin organization also possessed a powerful mind.

If he really wanted to waste time with the dragon spike every day, it would obviously be a foolish act.

However, what made him extremely unwilling was that in the future, the underground of star-moon kingdom would be under the control of the dragon spike.

“Dragon Spike!”

The master of undercurrent shouted in a low voice. His eyes were filled with a crazed killing intent!

“Let’s go. We have gained a lot this time. We can have a good rest when we return to the Dragon Palace. When will your auction be held?”

At the East Gate of Bright Moon City, Wang Xian and Feng Luan were walking out with smiles on their faces.

There was a kitten lying on Wang Xian’s shoulder.

“For the auction, we have to wait until the Dragon and Phoenix royal city is completely renovated. At the very least, we have to make the dragon and Phoenix Royal City as big as Bright Moon City!”

Feng Luan looked at Wang Xian and said, “But it will take at most two months!”

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head slowly.

The dragon-phoenix Empire had been established. Feng Luan wanted to let the dragon-phoenix Empire enter the stage of the Liuhai District and step onto the stage of the extraordinary mainland. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Firstly, she wanted to attract the merchants and the mercenary groups to settle down in the Dragon-phoenix royal city.

The best way was to hold a large-scale auction.

When the time came, she would take out enough treasures to attract the experts and mercenary groups from the surrounding countries.

Wang Xian would also sell his pet eggs and the bloodlines of demonic beasts and ferocious beasts at this auction.
