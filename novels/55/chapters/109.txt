Chapter 110: Known Throughout University of Rivertown (1)

[Shocking news! After one of the five goddesses, Guan Shuqing, was seen having lunch with a guy and had seemingly fallen in love, our goddess Lan Qingyue was also seen having dinner with a guy. Moreover, the guy they ate with is the same person! Their actions were intimate and looked just like a couple. The male protagonist is none other than the immoral year-two Wang Xian!]

[What does the immoral Wang Xian truly possess to allow him to eat with two of our goddesses in the same day?]

[What kind of scumbag is the immoral Wang Xian? Please follow our thread as we bring you into Wang Xian’s life!]

[Oh my goddesses! Please take a good look at him. He is an immoral beast to go out with two of you in the same day! That’s a disgraceful breach of norms!]

[The Immoral Year-Two Wang Xian. A god-like existence! Deserving of our worship!]

The school forum was a lot more raucous today than normal. However, the comments on the forum also made countless people dumbfounded.

The first was Guan Shuqing rejecting a guy’s confession and going to the canteen with another guy for lunch.

And the second was their goddess, Lan Qingyue, meeting up with the same guy for dinner!

This was a tragic development as it dealt consecutive blows to the fragile minds of many male students.

However, what made countless male students enraged was that the one who accompanied Goddess Guan Shuqing for lunch and Goddess Lan Qingyue for dinner was the same person.

The same year-two guy.

If there were two different guys, the other male students might just drown their sorrows with alcohol in memory of their crushes.

However, if there was only one guy, that’s a different story.

What they wanted to do the most currently was to turn that scumbag, the immoral Wang Xian, into memories.

That’s right, he’s an immoral beast!

It would have been fine if he had just gone out with one of their goddesses. However, he went for both goddesses at the same time! Having lunch with Guan Shuqing and dinner with Lan Qingyue in the same day!

This asshole...

They couldn’t even get one and now a guy had gotten both of them?

Who could tolerate this?

No one could!

They had to expose this immoral beast and let their two goddesses see the true character of this man.

And to also let the huge female cohort in the University of Rivertown know the existence of this immoral beast, Wang Xian.

If the incident in the afternoon made Wang Xian famous, what happened at night made his name known throughout the entire University of Rivertown.

When Wang Xian returned to his dormitory room, he immediately sensed three pairs of intense eyes looking towards him.

“Aiyo! Our immoral beast, Old Wang, is back!”

A voice filled with jealousy and envy sounded from Wang Dahai.

“Huh...” Wang Xian paused and looked at Wang Dahai, feeling puzzled.

“Damn! And you are still looking at me with those innocent eyes! Old Wang, I believe it will be better for you if you lock the door to the room. Otherwise, I’m afraid there will be people charging in to beat you up!”

Looking at how Wang Xian had reacted, Wang Dahai gritted his teeth in anger.

Having lunch with Guan Shuqing in the afternoon.

Having dinner with Lan Qingyue at night.

Immoral! Immoral beast!

“Haiz. Comparing would only make one feel inferior. Old Wang, if you wern’t our roommate, we would definitely beat you up severely!”

Zhang Wen exhaled slowly and looked as though he wanted to eradicate the scourge for the greater population.

“What exactly happened?” Wang Xian looked at them and still had no idea what was happening.

“Take a look at the forum yourself!”

When the three of them saw his “innocent” expression, they gritted their teeth and remarked in unison.

Wang Xian shrugged his shoulders, walked to his study desk immediately and loaded the school forum webpage.

“What the hell!”

When he saw the entire forum being overwhelmed by the same message, he couldn’t help but blurt vulgarities.

It was especially so when he saw the word in front of his name! He was on the verge of spitting blood.

Immoral Beast, Wang Xian?

Asshole!

When he clicked into each thread, all the comments were condemning him.

They were condemning him for being a two-timer and for overreaching for someone way beyond his league.

Some threads even published his personal particulars. However, they were quickly removed by the moderator.

Wang Xian saw the liveliest thread had over 8,000 comments.

What the hell! There are only a total of 10,000 plus students in the University of Rivertown!

“This... I’m not a two-timer,” Wang Xian shook his head bitterly and mumbled.

“You are not? Explain yourself then! Why did you eat lunch with Guan Shuqing in the afternoon? Why did you eat dinner with Lan Qingyue at night?”

At this moment, three grudgeful voices sounded.

Wang Xian turned his head around and saw three guys staring at him with resentment.

Even though Zhang Wen and Zhang Feng already had girlfriends, this fact did not stop them from condemning Wang Xian.

After all, the two goddesses of the University of Rivertown had rumors with the same guy, and this infuriated many others.

After listening to them, Wang Xian twiddled his fingers. He was feeling complicated.

In his heart and undoubtedly, he had seen Guan Shuqing as his girlfriend.

As for Lan Qingyue, although it wasn’t at the level of a girlfriend, Wang Xian naturally wished to be together with this girl from the bottom of his heart.

He could also sense Lan Qingyue’s admiration of him.

But... With today’s laws and societal norms, this was clearly difficult.

It was especially so as the two girls would most likely find this hard to accept.

Even if...

Even if the two girls could agree, their parents would not.

It was especially so for Lan Qingyue. Her family was wealthy, and she would be the future successor. Why would her parents allow her to suffer such grievances?

“Can you give me a cigarette?”

Wang Xian felt irritated all of a sudden. Although he didn’t know how to smoke, he still asked for one from Wang Dahai.

“Damn, still want a cigarette? You better tell us everything now! What are your relationships with the two goddesses?”

Wang Dahai looked at him, feeling speechless, but he still gave him a cigarette. He even lit it for Wang Xian.

Wang Xian took a deep breath and slowly exhaled.

The smoke lingered around him.

Wang Dahai and the group found this to be very pretentious.

“If you let me choose...”

Wang Xian took another puff. In his mind, two figures appeared.

Nonetheless, he would have a clear answer if he had to make a choice at this moment.

“Guan Shuqing!”

Wang Xian answered.

“You are choosing? YOU... You...”

The trio didn’t really care about his final decision. What they cared about was Wang Xian’s reaction.

Choose? You are actually thinking of choosing?

Both goddesses were the dream girls of any man, and they would work their hardest just to be with either one of them!

Bzz!

At this moment, his phone rang.

It was the notification sound of WeChat. Wang Xian looked across and saw three pairs of burning eyes staring at his phone. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Coincidentally, another message was sent over.

These messages were from two people; Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue.

Wang Xian could feel three pairs of cold eyes staring at him. He felt helpless and revealed a bitter look. Taking his phone with him, he jumped onto his bed.

“Alright, alright. I’m sleeping now,” he yelled and unlocked his phone.

Guan Shuqing’s message was, [What are you doing now? Are you not going to the library tonight?]

Lan Qingyue’s message was [I’m sorry Wang Xian. I might have caused you trouble.]

Looking at these two messages, Wang Xian felt conflicting emotions.

Guan Shuqing couldn’t possibly not know about the school forum. However, she didn’t questione Wang Xian. She ignored those comments and didn’t condemn Wang Xian at all. This was trust and unconditional belief in Wang Xian!

Lan Qingyue was apologizing to him for what had occurred at night and wasn’t concerned about how this would affect her reputation. This was sacrifice!

With two girls sacrificing so much for him, what else could he possibly ask for!
