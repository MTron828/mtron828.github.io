Chapter 414: Alchemy Furnace

This wretched kid! I was still thinking of introducing him to Miracle Doctor Wang so he could help him out on the path ahead. Yet, he didn’t know what is right for him and even offended Miracle Doctor Wang!

Mogul Sun was exceptionally furious and stood beside Wang Xian in fear.

Wang Xian looked to Mogul Sun with a radiant smile before turning and looking at Sun Longxuan with contempt.

“Are you curious now as to why not a single person is willing to join your Mechanic Sect?”

“That’s because I’m Wang Xian!”

That’s because I’m Wang Xian.

It was five simple words but the surrounding crowd could all sense the dominance in Wang Xian’s words.

Just because he was Wang Xian, not a single person from all the families and sects in the Southern Province dared to join Sun Longxuan’s Mechanic Sect even if they had strong desires to.

Upon hearing Wang Xian, Sun Longxuan’s eyebrows twitched violently as he gritted his teeth.

Just because he’s Wang Xian.

He saw his father bowing down and apologizing in fear and trepidation before his eyes.

This was the very first time he saw his father being so careful before another person. Moreover, he was just a young man.

He clenched his fists tightly and was filled with astonishment.

“Come and apologize to Miracle Doctor Wang immediately!” Mogul Sun pulled a long face, looked at his son and ordered him furiously.

“Father... I...”

“Go!”

At this moment, a voice reverberated from beside him. He was taken aback and stared at the two guys whom he addressed as big brothers in disbelief.

They were the Saints from a Sacred Sect, and even they were asking him to apologize!

Is he someone that even the Saints of a Sacred Sect are wary of?

Who the hell is Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown?

Sun Longxuan, who had just returned from overseas, was exceptionally embarrassed. Despite being overwhelmed with humiliation, he walked with heavy steps towards Wang Xian.

“Apologize!”

Seeing his son dragging his feet and being indecisive, Mogul Sun slapped him on his head.

Sun Longxuan lowered his head and didn’t dare to say another word. Although he was strong and his father was just an ordinary man currently, even Inborn experts wouldn’t encroach on his father’s authority.

“Miracle Doctor Wang, I’m... I’m sorry!”

“You should have expected this outcome and not acted as you did. No matter where you are, it’s important to learn humility first. It is especially so in the Underworld. If you offend one you can’t afford to, you might lose your life!” Wang Xian chuckled as he instructed him.

“Yes, yes. Miracle Doctor Wang is right! This brat was overwhelmed with the power he has and became brazen because of his background. He deserves it!” Mogul Sun nodded his head and agreed with Wang Xian.

Wang Xian waved his hand. Seeing Mogul Sun apologizing to him fearfully and in trepidation, Wang Xian had no intention to be too demanding in this matter.

After all, Sun Longxuan was just an arrogant Half-step to Inborn brat.

“Thank you, Miracle Doctor Wang for your magnanimity. After I learned that Miracle Doctor Wang was coming, I prepared a gift for you. I hope you will accept it!”

Seeing that Wang Xian didn’t press on the matter, Mogul Sun was finally able to heave a sigh of relief and quickly commented. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Hmm! I’m here mainly to see if there’s anything good in this trading area. If there is, I’ll do a fair trade!” Wang Xian said to Mogul Sun.

“Alright, Miracle Doctor Wang, please come with me. The trading area is right at the back. I’ll bring you there!” said Mogul Sun with smiles as he led the way for Wang Xian.

Wang Xian nodded in response and followed behind him with Lan Qingyue.

Seeing how deferential his father was acting towards the young man, Sun Longxuan looked extremely bitter.

He looked at the two young men beside him, took a deep breath and asked solemnly, “Big brothers, who the hell is that guy?”

Saint Qi and Saint Wen looked cautiously at Sun Longxuan and answered, “He’s an extremely powerful young man and the number one on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart currently!”

“What? Number one on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart?”

Sun Longxuan was taken aback. Naturally, he knew about the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart. All those who were ranked in the top five were Inborn experts below twenty-five years old.

As for the number one ranked person, he definitely had incredible strength. In fact, he might even have a strength that could match those experienced Inborn experts.

“Besides that, he’s a Miracle Doctor who ranks in the top ten on the Miracle Doctors Chart, a master alchemist, and annihilated an entire first-class force previously. He had a conflict with the Flame Palace which was annihilated a while back, and even slew the Elders from the Sacred Followers Guild some time ago,” Saint Qi and Saint Wen explained.

That demon-like young man couldn’t be described with common sense. Not many people would dare to kill Elders from a Sacred Sect.

Not only did he commit the killings, but he was still alive and kicking at this moment.

Even with their status as Saints of the Dark Sect, they would avoid offending a person like him to the best of their ability.

It was hard to tell if he would disregard their status as Saints of a Sacred Sect and kill them on the spot.

Gulp!

Sun Longxuan swallowed a mouthful of saliva as fear slowly crept up within him. Despite spending most of his time overseas, he still knew about the strength of a Sacred Sect.

That young man has just killed an Elder from a Sacred Sect?

“He’s so insane?”

Cold sweat was breaking out on Sun Longxuan’s forehead.

“Once, three to four Inborn experts stood up for him before the Flame Palace while risking incurring the wrath of the Flame Palace. He is at least able to summon four to five Inborn experts. Coupled with the fact that he knows no fear, no one will offend him without reasons or if the matter does not concern huge interests,” said Saint Qi and Saint Wen while frowning.

It was at least the case for them. This was because a person like Wang Xian wouldn’t care about your background.

“It’s no surprise that my father was so horrified a while ago!”

Sun Longxuan felt enlightened. He was a prideful person and so was his father.

The connections with Saint Qi and Saint Wen came from his father. Moreover, he had seen his father conversing with the Elders from the Dark Sect. Never once did he see his father trembling in fear and acting so deferentially to them.

The incident today had really taught Sun Longxuan a lifelong lesson:

To keep a low profile at all times.

“Miracle Doctor Wang, the trading today will be starting soon. Let’s take a look at some of my collection. I had it prepared for Longxuan’s sect previously. However, I don’t think he is capable of becoming a sect leader and there won’t be a need for this collection!”

Mogul Sun brought Wang Xian to his private room and explained with a radiant smile on his face.

There were tables around them and the table at the center already had things on it.

“Spiritual grass! There are three tufts of Level 4 spiritual grass, some weapons and some machines built from the legacy of Lu Ban. Oh right, I also have a small cauldron!”

Mogul Sun pointed to the center as he explained to Wang Xian excitedly.

Hmm!

Wang Xian nodded his head and turned his attention to the table in the center.

Eh?

When he saw the small cauldron that was half a meter in size, he was shocked. Excitement gleamed in his eyes as he walked towards it immediately.

Alchemy furnace: Level 5

“Alchemy furnace! Oh gosh! This is an alchemy furnace!”

Wang Xian exclaimed in shock as he approached it. When he arrived before the alchemy furnace, he started observing the red alchemy furnace carefully.

An alchemy furnace was something he had been looking for a long time. He couldn’t even find one in the National Treasury. Therefore, he was shocked to learn that Mogul Sun had an alchemy furnace!
