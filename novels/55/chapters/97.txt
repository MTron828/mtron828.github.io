It seems like the system still has a lot of functions that aren’t unlocked and only would be when I’ve reached a certain level.

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered.

It has changed! My personal information has changed!

There are additional line items of “Dragon Palace” and “Dragon Palace Subordinates”.

Divine dragons exist in this universe. However, I’m not just an ordinary divine dragon, but also possess a god-like Divine Dragon System. The cultivation of Divine Dragons couldn’t extract divine energy by devouring marine animals. Instead, they have to cultivate diligently. As for me, due to the system, I could make use of the system to convert them directly into dragon energy. As compared to the divine dragon race, there’s a huge difference!

Similarly, I could build the strongest Dragon Palace directly through the system!

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. Divine Dragon System was relatively more unique. It couldn’t make one become an unparalleled Divine Dragon directly, and required that he take one step at a time.

The focus of Invincible Divine Dragon Cultivation System was in cultivation!

Only by going through each step could he become an invincible divine dragon.

One should know that the strongest races of the universe weren’t just the dragon race.

However, he could make use of the system to become an invincible existence!

“But!” Wang Xian had a million thoughts running in his mind. In the end, he had a bitter look on his face and couldn’t help but curse. “Isn’t the material required to build the Dragon Palace a little too much?”

Disregarding others, just a hundred tons of gold would be an astronomical sum.

A hundred tons of gold would be 100 million grams. Taking the price of gold to be $330 be gram, he would need $33 billion.

The $33 billion was even before he considered other materials. The total sum required to build a dragon palace would be astronomical.

Wang Xian’s expression darkened. He couldn’t even take out a hundred million currently, let alone $30 billion.

“Poor, I’m still too poor.”

Wang Xian pulled a long face and took a deep breath. “This is forcing me to rule the world so as to look for the resources!”

“Forget it. I might not need to rule the world but I do need to earn some money. Once I have the money, the gold and other materials could be bought. It is just that spiritual stone wouldn’t be easy to get!”

Spiritual stone was a condensed form of pure energy. However, he hadn’t seen one previously. Therefore, it was most likely very valuable.

Wang Xian shook his head and stopped thinking about it. He wanted to take this step by step, as it hadn’t even been a month since he became a divine dragon.

The money would come and so would the Dragon Palace.

“King!”

At this moment, the spiritual turtle disrupted Wang Xian’s thoughts.

Wang Xian looked at the spiritual turtle. The spiritual turtle was drastically different from when he first saw it.

Its shell looked a little sturdier and wasn’t like the ground beetle previously. It even looked rather majestic.

“Not bad, not bad. I’ll call you Prime Minister Turtle in the future. Don’t address me as King. Call me ‘Dragon King!’”

“Yes, Dragon King. Prime Minister Turtle thanks Dragon King for the name!”

“Sure, sure!”

Wang Xian looked at Prime Minister Turtle with satisfaction. Although its current appearance wasn’t great, it was highly intelligent. A Prime Minister Turtle that doesn’t know how to bootlick isn’t a good Prime Minister Turtle!

“Why don’t you head into the seas? Why do you choose to stay in this lake?” Wang Xian asked peculiarly.

“It’s more comfortable here and I won’t be disturbed!” Prime Minister Turtle answered honestly.

“Alright.”

Wang Xian was a little speechless. Waving his arm, the Earth Dragon Cultivation Arts of the Divine Dragon Transformation was imprinted in his mind.

“Cultivate diligently here. I’ll make my move now.”

After finishing his words, Wang Xian headed out immediately.

Time flew past quickly, and he had to return.

He had a fruitful night. Not only did he manage to subdue a Prime Minister Turtle but he had also gotten an idea of the process of building his Dragon Palace.

However, no one would have imagined that the sea monster of Jianghai Lake was actually a large and horrifying turtle that spanned over 10 meters.

When he arrived at school from the seaside, it was already past 9 am.

Just as he stepped into the dormitory room, a rough voice sounded.

“What the... Old Wang, you are finally back. I called you so many times but you didn’t pick up. Come, accompany me to buy some clothes today.”

Wang Xian lifted his head and immediately saw a fat head extending out of the bed.

“Dahai, why are you so early? What a rare occasion!”

Wang Dahai had the same surname as him and was a year older than Wang Xian. He weighed around 190 catties.

He had all the strengths of a fatty such as being honest, upright, and conservative on the outside but passionate on the inside. He was the closest friend Wang Xian had in the dormitory.

Wang Dahai was a local of Rivertown. Typically, he wouldn’t report to school before school started. It would seem that he had arrived the previous day and was acting a little strange.

“I have something in mind, hehe.” Wang Dahai chuckled.

Looking at his horny look, it must be related to a girl!

“Old Wang, I’ll get up right now. Accompany me to buy some clothes!” Wang Dahai stood up as he spoke.

Speaking of Wang Xian’s nickname, “Old Wang,” there was a meaning behind it.

The story was from the beginning of freshman year. At that time, there was a guy from the opposite dormitory block who liked a girl from their class.

However, that girl was more interested in Wang Xian.

After that guy confessed and got rejected, Wang Xian got another nickname, “Old Wang, the Neighbour” or in short, “Old Wang.” [1] Almost everyone in the dormitory addressed him as such.

“Buy clothes? I have to accompany my sister today. My sister has arrived.” Wang Xian chuckled.

“Your sister, Xiao Yu, has arrived?” Wang Dahai was a little surprised. “Why don’t we ask your sister, Xiao Yu, along?”

“Let me ask her about it.” Wang Xian didn’t reject the suggestion.

Wang Dahai was a great guy and had been taking good care of him. He had treated Wang Xian to multiple meals and even lent Wang Xian his motorcycle over the summer holidays.

After getting Wang Xian’s call, Xiao Yu replied, “Brother, I’m going to take a look at the school clubs with Xiao Mi, Yuanyuan and Su Qian. I guess I won’t be going.”

Wang Xian nodded his hand. “Alright, have fun. I’ll accompany my roommate to get some stuff.”

“Give me a moment to wash up!”

Upon hearing Wang Xian’s words, Wang Dahai immediately jumped up and started washing up.

“Where are we going to get clothes?” Wang Xian asked.

“City center!”

“Why do you want to go to the city center to get clothes. Can’t you just get them from the shops beside the school? Oh right, you haven’t told me why you arrived at school so early?”

Wang Xian looked at Wang Dahai.

Hehe! Wang Dahai chuckled. He stuck his head out of the washroom and said, “Let me bring you to have some fun tonight.”

“Eh... You got a date? Is she from our school?” Wang Xian asked in shock.

“She’s a senior. Hehe, it was initially last night but she went out with her roommates for dinner. Therefore, it was postponed to tonight. Old Wang, you are lucky.”

“Damn, why does it feel like you’ve gotten more handsome since the last time I saw you a month ago. If only you were a little uglier. You would then be able to show how tall and mighty I am.”

“Sigh. It’s okay, who asked me to be so kind? She said she would be bringing her roommates along. Perhaps they might find you handsome and have a relationship that lasts for a single night with you.”

“Old Wang, the Neighbour” was a comic strip character. He took on many roles, among which was a guy who got into an affair with the neighbor’s wife.
