Chapter 889: 0890 whoever kills my daughter will die!

Translator: 549690339

A shocked voice was heard.

A piece of jade glue, just a piece of jade glue.

When the crowd saw Wang Xian casually handing over a piece of jade glue, a young man almost burst out in ridicule.

However, when he saw his face and the piece of jade glue on the table that was four to five times bigger than the level one jade glue, he could not help but let out a cry of surprise.

“Hiss, the jade glue of an extraordinary level three Piranha!”

“It’s him. The young man who killed Ao Xue, bei Ming, and Qing Feng has at least the strength of a level three extraordinary!”

“He should have killed more than one level three extraordinary piranha. Back then, we were chased by more than a dozen piranhas. In the end, he rushed over and killed the Piranha!”

“His eight subordinates are also very strong. If they were placed in our hands, they would definitely be among the top experts. The only ones who could fight against them are Qi Lian and the others!”

When the people around saw Wang Xian, they were all shocked and discussed in low voices.

Wang Xian and the rest were definitely dark horses among them.

They had killed Ao Xue and the other three geniuses from Shenghai Town. In this assessment, more than 20 people had died at his hands. Their strength was unfathomable.

“Jade Glue of extraordinary level three?”

The middle-aged man who was standing at the front was slightly stunned. A glimmer of light flashed in his eyes, he stared at Wang Xian with a burning gaze and said, “Good, good. I didn’t expect to meet a heaven’s favorite in Shenghai Town. Not bad. Here you go. This is the admission notice. There are 100 points on it!”

“Very good. Among this batch of students, you are among the top!”

The four middle-aged men at the side looked at each other and said with smiles on their faces.

“Thank you for your praise, Mentor!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly and took the admission notice.

Wang Xian was completely unperturbed by the astonishment of the people around him.

How could a transcendent level three jade glue be so excited? If he were to take out all the piranha corpses, wouldn’t he be so scared that he would pee his pants?

As for his mentor’s praise, he didn’t take it to heart. If a transcendent level five mentor were to fight with him now, it was uncertain who would win or lose.

Wang Xian retreated to the side and looked at the admission notice in his hand indifferently.

“How arrogant!”

“How Handsome!”

The eyes of some girls on the ship lit up when they saw Wang Xian’s cold and arrogant look.

He had a perfect figure, a determined gaze, a handsome face, and a powerful strength. He was also a heaven’s favorite. He was completely the Prince Charming in everyone’s hearts.

On the transcendent continent, anyone under the age of forty could be considered a genius if their strength was at the peak of level two.

Anyone who reached level three could be called a heaven’s favorite.

As for level four, they could be called a peerless genius.

Level five, they could be called a Peerless Heaven’s favorite!

As for those who were even higher, they could only be described as monsters. Such monsters would definitely be the most dazzling existence in the empire.

“HMPH, after killing Ao Xue, bei Ming, and Qing Feng, just wait for your death!”

“Not to mention anything else, the horned shark mercenary group will definitely not let him off. A Fallen Heaven’s pride can not be called a heaven’s Pride!”

At this moment, Qi Lian and Du Wen, who were standing at the side, had extremely ugly expressions on their faces.

They had originally thought that they would be able to rank first in holy sea town this time. However, they had not expected that they would be directly crushed by this fellow who had appeared out of nowhere.

Being crushed by a guy who had no blind spots made them feel a little embarrassed.

The title of first place in holy sea town’s assessment results would be very beneficial to the establishment of a mercenary group and a team to recruit experts in the future.

Qi Lian and Du Wen’s voices weren’t soft, and everyone around them could hear them clearly.

The group of young men were slightly stunned, and then they slowly frowned.

“Ao Xue’s team this time has many members trained by the Dogfish mercenary group. He might really be in big trouble!”

“Ao Xue’s father is the vice-leader of the squalid shark mercenary group. He’s an extraordinary level five powerhouse. It’s impossible for him not to take revenge for his daughter’s death!”

“Then this young man is in big trouble. No matter how much of a heaven’s favorite he is, he would be killed even if he provoked a one-star gold mercenary group!”

The surrounding people thought of the background of Ao Xue and the rest and discussed in low voices. Their eyes would occasionally glance at Wang Xian.

When the five middle-aged instructors heard the discussion around them, they looked at each other and shook their heads slowly.

They had actually angered a one-star gold mercenary group. What a pity for such a good student.

The demon hunting mercenary group was neither a military academy nor an aristocratic academy.

The demon hunting academies were established by the various kingdoms and empires for the purpose of eliminating demonic beasts and ferocious beasts. Even if they were to enter the academy, they would study and cultivate while accepting missions to hunt and kill demonic beasts and ferocious beasts.

Therefore, the management was very lax and they would not get involved in the students’grudges.

In every city, it was forbidden to fight outside the arena. As for leaving the city, it was not up to the countries to care whether they were dead or alive.

An outstanding student had offended a powerful mercenary group and the Academy would not say anything even if he was killed.

This world was extremely cruel. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The people on the ship were discussing in low voices. Some of the young men who wanted to curry favor with Wang Xian immediately dismissed this idea.

“HMPH!”

Qi Lian and Du Wen stood at the side with a cold smile. They exuded an arrogant aura.

“Dogfish mercenary group?”

When Wang Xian heard the conversation around him, a thoughtful look appeared on his face.

The ship arrived at the shore very quickly. Five middle-aged men brought them to Shenghai town.

“Did my child pass the assessment?”

“Son, did he pass?”

“Daughter, how is it?”

The moment they entered the city, there were already seven to eight thousand people gathered at the entrance. Seeing them arrive, some of the young men’s parents shouted loudly.

“Eh? Where are Ao Xue and the others?”

In the center of the city gate, there were more than twenty people from the Dogfish mercenary group. A middle-aged man with an axe in his hand and a middle-aged man dressed like a noble stood there.

Everyone looked at the group of young men who flew over. Soon, they frowned as they had a bad feeling.

“Ao Xue!”

In the center of the squalid shark mercenary group, a burly middle-aged man dressed in armor shouted loudly.

An unbridled voice rang out at the city gate, drowning out all other voices.

This caused everyone to be slightly displeased. However, when they saw his identity, they immediately shut their mouths and restrained the impatience on their faces.

The loud voice didn’t receive any response.

The young men who were taking the assessment looked at Wang Xian and the rest who were walking behind them.

“Huh?”

The burly middle-aged man was slightly taken aback. His face slowly sank.

The luxurious middle-aged man and the middle-aged man who was holding an axe glanced at the crowd. Their brows twitched violently.

“Bei Ming!”

“Qingfeng!”

A somewhat anxious voice sounded, but there was still no response.

“Uncle Ao, Miss Ao Xue and Bei Ming Qingfeng have already been killed!”

At this moment, at the front of the group of young examinees, Qi Lian’s lips curled into a cold smile as he spoke directly.

“What? killed? Who Dares to Kill My Ao Kuang’s Daughter? !”

The middle-aged man in the middle of the horned shark mercenary group’s expression changed drastically, and a violent killing intent instantly surged from his body as he shouted loudly.
