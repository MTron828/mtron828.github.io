Chapter 296: Hold The Plane And Move (3)

“For a long time, no one dared to call me, Sui Huang, that!” Sui Huang remarked emotionlessly. After which, five palms made of flames grabbed their necks tightly.

“What?”

The skinny middle-aged man and the several old men behind him were instantly petrified.

The palms made of flames appeared on their necks suddenly. They did not have any time to react to it. To their horror, they realized they couldn’t break free from the palms.

However, what really frightened them the most was what the old man had just said.

Sui Huang... Sui Huang... He said his name was Sui Huang!

All large Families and Sects would know what this name represented.

That name belonged to one of the most horrifying old men in Shang Jing.

“Sui Huang, how did... I... We...”

“Spare me your nonsense!”

Coldness gleamed in Sui Huang’s eyes. When he moved his arm, the palms made of flames moved. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Crack crack!

The five men’s eyes widened and were filled with disbelief. Their bodies trembled violently as they fell to the ground.

They weren’t even feeling remorseful at all.

Bam!

“Sui Huang, Sui Huang...”

The other middle-aged man mumbled. Suddenly, his eyes widened and he kneeled in front of Sui Huang.

“Thank you, Sui Huang. Thank You, Sui Huang. They are finally dead! I can now die without regrets!”

The middle-aged man was very agitated and his face was filled with tears. After which, he gritted his teeth and was about to smash his palm on his head.

Bam!

Sui Huang kicked his arms away to prevent him from committing suicide. He then said, “Whether you deserve death will be determined later. For now, seal the two holes for me!”

“Yes, yes! Even if you want me dead now, I wouldn’t grumble about it!”

That middle-aged man kneeled and kowtowed before Sui Huang. He stood up and waved his arms. Instantly, a stream of energy blocked the cracks of the plane.

“Brother Wang Xian, you are a miracle doctor. Can you help to treat the injured?” Sui Huang asked Wang Xian after shooting the middle-aged man a death stare.

“Alright!” Wang Xian smiled and replied with a nod.

This old fogey, Sui Huang, is pretty domineering. Wang Xian looked around him, squatted down and injected streams of Azure Dragon energy into those with injuries. Soon, they recovered.

“Chief Leader, can you take a look at the pilots? They... They have lost consciousness!!”

An aircrew member spoke to Sui Huang frantically. At this moment, the alarm system of the plane continued to sound.

“Let me take a look!” Wang Xian replied as he walked over to the cockpit.

The cockpit was damaged by the fight between the two sides and a large hole was left in it.

The pilots had collapsed inside the cockpit.

Wang Xian walked over and was stunned. He frowned, turned to Sui Huang and said, “They’re beyond hope!”

“What?”

Sui Huang was shocked and turned solemn.

“What? Sir... Sir... Are they really beyond hope?” the aircrew members and security asked in fear.

“They are gone!” Wang Xian replied and shook his head.

One of the aircrew members rushed to the controls and picked up the radio.

“Mayday! Mayday! Flight Number A934J from Rivertown towards Shang Jing. The pilots on board have encountered danger. Requesting immediate support!”

“Mayday! Mayday! Flight Number A934J from Rivertown towards Shang Jing. The pilots on board have encountered danger. Requesting immediate support!”

The aircrew member was sweating as he called for help.

“This is bad!”

Soon, that aircrew member pressed a few buttons and realized something had gone wrong. He shouted frantically, “The radio is out! The radio is out!”

“There are problems with other action keys too. It’s over! It’s over!” That aircrew member became even more flustered as he shouted loudly.

“What’s the matter?” Sui Huang frowned and shouted, “Calm down!”

Hu hu hu!

The aircrew member took a few deep breaths and replied, “The pilot is dead, and so is the secondary pilot. There’s no one who can control the plane now! Furthermore, some equipment is damaged! We.... We...”

Tears streamed down from his eyes as he spoke.

“Let me ask, let me ask,” an air stewardess said fearfully.

She picked up the announcement system and said with a trembling voice, “Calling for all passengers. Our plane has encountered a major incident. Is there anyone who knows how to fly a plane!?”

She continued, “If there is, please come over to the cockpit immediately. This concerns the lives of everyone!”

The air stewardess repeated the announcement several times and her voice sounded throughout the plane.

“What? Who knows how to fly a plane? Who knows how to fly a plane!? Get to the cockpit immediately!”

“Oh gosh! The plane is diving downwards! Mum, I don’t want to die!”

“It’s finished, it’s finished! Who knows how to fly a plane! Please get to the cockpit quickly! The plane has deviated from its path and is slanting down now!”

“I don’t want to die, I still have a family! My children!”

When the passengers heard the air stewardess’s announcement, panic broke out.

However, no one stood up. In this era, a pilot wasn’t common.

“Is there anyone who knows how to fly a plane? Please come to the cockpit immediately. We are facing a major crisis!”

The announcement sounded again. However, there was still no one who stood up.

Panic started sprouting in everyone’s heart.

“Make a call! Contact the headquarters to see if there are any signals!” Sui Huang frowned and said.

Mobile phones were prohibited on the plane. However, at this moment, he couldn’t care less.

“The high-speed movements will affect the signals. Nonetheless, we can give it a try!”

One of the aircrew members replied hurriedly. He then took out his phone and called.

“We are flight number A934J, we are experiencing a major incident, requesting for headquarters aid!” the aircrew member called and shouted hurriedly.

Bzz! Bzz!

From the other end of the phone, an unstable buzzing noise sounded.

“It’s not working. The signals are unstable when flying at high speeds. The message isn’t getting through. This isn’t working!”

“It’s over, it’s over. We are just three minutes away from the airport. However, the plane is totally out of control and we can’t possibly land it properly. The plane is going to crash!”

“The emergency equipment is malfunctioning as well!”

Fear gripped the members of the aircrew as they shouted frantically.

They were out of their means. Based on the current trend, the plane would be crashing.

At this moment, the command center of Shang Jing airport had also realized that they had lost contact with Flight A934J.

“Leader, Flight A934J is still uncontactable. According to the normal flight schedule, they are just three minutes away from landing!”

“Leader, we have turned on satellite tracking. We found a plane flying abnormally!”

“Leader, we received an emergency call from flight A934J. However, the voices were constantly interrupted and we couldn’t hear anything.”

“Hurry up! Lock down on their position with satellite and identify the problem they are facing. Continue to contact them. We definitely must establish contact with them!”

At this moment, the various leaders from the airline were commanding frantically.

If something was to happen to the plane, the repercussions on the airline would be grave.

If there were a lot of casualties, even the higher management of the airline would need to bear the responsibilities.

“Oh gosh! Flight A945J is totally out of control and is spiralling down,” one of the staff members shouted desperately at this moment.

All the management members from the airline looked up. A plane was barreling towards the ground at an astonishing speed.

Everyone trembled and was frightened.

“Dear passengers, I would like to inform you of an unfortunate piece of news. The plane will crash in three minutes. We will try our best to force an emergency landing. Please pray for us!”

At this moment, a desolating piece of news was broadcasted through the announcement system.

“No... No... Don’t!”

“How did this happen? How did this happen? I don’t want to die!”

“I want to make a call! I still have words for my wife and my children!”

The passengers screamed in fear. Some passengers turned on their phones and tried to convey their last words to their loved ones.

The air stewardesses did not stop them. Instead, they did the same and started drafting their messages.

They were in complete despair.

Everyone felt hopeless. If the plane crashed, how many of them could possibly survive?

Everyone in the cockpit squatted down in despair and their bodies couldn’t help but tremble.

“These few rascals! Only causing troubles for others!”

Sui Huang was gloomy and clenched his fist tightly.

“How far are we from the airport now?” Wang Xian frowned and asked one of the aircrews at the side.

“We are roughly fifteen kilometers away.”

Boom!

As the aircrew spoke, the plane started turning. The group fell and rolled towards the far end.

“Over ten kilometers.”

Wang Xian had a gloomy expression as he looked at the control system. He then pulled the red valve on the end.

Rumble!

With the propulsion system stopped, the plane fell straight down.

“Haiz, Old Sui! Let’s give it a try!”

Wang Xian smiled as he spoke calmly to Old Sui who was beside him.

Huh? Sui Huang was stunned. Soon, he nodded and smiled, “If I was alone, I wouldn’t be confident in doing this. Since it is the both of us, I am confident!”

“Haha! Alright then! Landing in Shang Jing in this manner wouldn’t be a great thing to look back at!” said Wang Xian while shaking his head. After which, he smashed the window in front of him and jumped out of the plane.

“Haha, Landing in Shang Jing in this manner will be the best way for you to remember your trip here!” Sui Huang laughed and followed behind him.

The two of them came to the bottom of the plane. They exchanged glances, smiled, stretched out their arms and slowly pushed against the plane.
