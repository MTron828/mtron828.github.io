Chapter 2942: demons and monsters descended

On the high tower on the planet at the border of the glazed domain, a group of celestial emperors stood there in silence.

A severely injured domain Lord!

A Dragon Palace that couldn’t be contacted!

Originally, the Dragon Palace coming to support their glazed domain was a great help to them, but after the Dragon Palace invaded the machine emperor domain, there was no news.

!!

They couldn’t contact the Dragon Palace, so they had to think of the worst.

The Dragon Palace was probably in danger.

“Retreat. Retreat to the border of the Holy Region. There are some planets left in the middle of the border to guard against Demonic Beasts!”

The governor said slowly.

The surrounding godly monarchs fell silent and nodded helplessly.

“I’ll organize it!”

The Grand Supreme First Elder said and flew out.

“Let’s contact the Holy Master and get him ready!”

Hong Fengyan and the other two celestial emperors immediately contacted the sacred master.

The azure glass region’s defeat was not only a blow to them, but also to the entire starry sky.

The azure glass region used to be the strongest region. Now that the Azure Glass region had been defeated, how could they defend against demonic beasts invading other star regions?

“All the soldiers and disciples of the glazed domain, all the citizens, please get ready. We are about to retreat to the saint domain. Everyone, get ready!”

Soon, a voice filled with authority resounded throughout the entire sky.

The faces of all the citizens of the glazed domain stiffened slightly when they heard this voice.

“Are we going to retreat to the Saint Domain? Do We have no hope at all?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“I didn’t expect that our glazed domain would be defeated. We have to flee!”

“Do we have no chance at all? We can invite other factions to help us!”

“What other factions can we invite? Currently, the only powerful factions are the dragon palace and the sanctum of sages. It’s said that we haven’t been able to contact the Dragon Palace ever since they entered the machine royal territory. The Dragon Palace might be in danger!”

“I heard from Lord God Emperor that we haven’t been able to contact the Dragon Palace for the past half a year. With the Dragon Palace’s support, we might be able to fight. Now… I’m afraid something has happened to the Dragon Palace!”

“The Dragon Palace must be very strong since they dared to invade the machine royal territory. Why Can’t we contact them now? What Happened?”

“Is the machine royal territory so easy to conquer?”? “The creator has existed for more than a billion years. The Dragon Palace has only risen for a short time. They must be too young and might be ambushed by the robots. If we can’t contact them after such a long time, something must have happened!”

“Didn’t the invincible battle technique say that the Dragon Palace is invincible? Isn’t it able to destroy the machine royal territory easily? What’s the situation now? Why isn’t that guy arrogant on the AI Now?”

When the order to retreat sounded, everyone in the glazed area was in an uproar.

Who wanted to leave their hometown?

Who wanted to watch their starry sky be occupied?

Everyone was talking about it, especially the current situation of the Dragon Palace, because at this moment, they had no hope without the help of the Dragon Palace.

But now they chose to retreat, which meant that there was a high possibility that something had happened to the Dragon Palace.

“Invincible in battle tactics, did something really happen to the Dragon King and the others?”

At this moment, invincible in battle tactics was standing with his senior sister at the bottom of the tower.

An elder at the peak of the godly king realm from the glazed domain couldn’t help but ask him at the side.

“Now, boss Wang and the others have probably obtained a huge amount of resources and are cultivating, so we can’t contact them for the time being.”

Invincible battle technique looked at the old man and said indifferently.

“This…”

When the old man heard his words, his heart sank.

How could he believe invincible battle technique’s conjecture.

Obtaining treasures and absorbing resources, and not being able to contact them for half a year, this possibility was too low.

“Junior Brother Invincible, is what you said true?”

When the second senior sister heard his words, she couldn’t help but send a voice transmission.

“Senior sister, I don’t know either. Not only can we not contact boss Wang, but we also can’t contact Master Tiancheng. I’m really panicking now!”

Invincible battle technique couldn’t help but say.

He wanted to go back to the Dragon Palace and ask what was going on!

But after he went back, it would take him at least a few months to come back.

By then, it would be too late.

Second senior sister’s expression changed slightly when she heard his words.

“Little Seven, invincible, prepare to head to the Holy Region.”

At this moment, Shangshui divine emperor flew over and said to the two of them.

The two of them saw that their master’s expression was not good and obediently nodded as they followed behind.

Hence, a vast escape began.

Countless planets and divine kingdoms flew in the vast void towards the holy region.

With their speed, they would need at least half a year to cross the entire boundary.

This was under the circumstances of relying on teleportation arrays. Otherwise, with so many people, they would only be able to cross the boundary in one to two years.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

Just as they were escaping from the glazed domain, roars could be heard from a spatial crack in the depths of the machine emperor region.

“Dragon King, another 10 members of the devouring dragon have broken through. They possess the combat strength of a level three void Celestial Emperor!”

Prime Minister Gui came to Wang Xian’s side and reported with a smile.

“Now, there are 19 level three void Celestial Emperor members of the Devouring Dragon. The rest of the celestial emperor ranks are around 150!”

Prime Minister Gui continued happily.

“Yes, very good. Now, we are just waiting for Ao crab to break through. If ao crab can successfully break through, the Dragon Palace will have a member with the combat strength of a level four celestial emperor!”

Wang Xian nodded and looked at Ao crab who was devouring the mechanical heart with a smile on his face.

In a short period of time from the punitive expedition to the royal territory, ao Crab’s combat strength had reached level three divine emperor from level one divine emperor. Now, he was making a breakthrough to level four.

Such a speed was shocking.

“Ao crab should be able to complete the breakthrough in one to two months!”

Wang Xian said faintly.

“Yes, the continuous breakthroughs have slowed down ao crab’s absorption rate.”

“Dragon King, after we return, the glazed domain should have already eliminated the evil spirits that invaded the chimei domain. By then, the other members of the Dragon Palace will be able to improve as well.”

Prime Minister Gui said with a smile.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded and took out the communication stone plate to continue nurturing.

A few days ago, he discovered many weapons and treasures here. Some of the treasures were used by the god-emperor powerhouses and should have been obtained by the creator.

However, these divine weapons and robots could not be used. Wang Xian brought them over to increase the power of the five elements great mill.

During this period of time, he was not bored.

However, the current Wang Xian would never have thought that the current glazed domain was completely different from what he had imagined.

The Dragon Palace destroyed the robots and swept across the machine royal domain.

In the glazed domain, the chimei domain also swept and occupied it.

The great escape of the glazed domain began!
