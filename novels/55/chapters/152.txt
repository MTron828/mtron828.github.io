Chapter 153: The Wedding

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

All of them stared at the two boxes of tea leaves in shock.

Zhang Yuanli was taken by surprise too. She’d found herself a rich boyfriend. As such, she understood some of these things.

She and her boyfriend had once bought a box of Pu’er tea leaves from the 1980s for an elder.

However, she never expected this brother would gift two boxes of such tea leaves to her father. It cost more than $200,000!

“It’s just some tea leaves. Since Uncle Zhang loves to drink tea, I had to buy him some good ones!”

Looking at his surprised look, Wang Xian chuckled. No amount of money could measure the bonds they shared.

“Aunt Zhang, Sister Li, we bought you some presents too.” Xiao Yu, at the side, beamed as she took out Aunt Zhang’s jewelry and Sister Li’s watch.

“This...”

Zhang Yuanli was taken aback when Xiao Yu passed her the Vacheron Constantin watch and the platinum jewelry to her mother.

“All these things cost at least $200,000...?” said Zhang Yuanli in shock as she looked at Xiao Yu and Wang Xian.

“$200,000? And these things... didn’t they cost around half a million?” Uncle Zhang was stunned. His expression was slightly different than before.

“Xiao Xian, did you do something bad? Where on earth did you get the money to buy all these things? I’m telling you, we cannot do anything that breaks the law,” said Uncle Zhang.

The rest of the people around them were staring at Wang Xian with doubts and suspicions.

How can a student have the money to buy such expensive gifts?

Not to mention, they were from the poor Wang siblings.

“Uncle Zhang, when I was in college, I earned some money by chance with my own restaurant and a hospital in Rivertown. Now, I’m still quite loaded,” Wang Xian explained ambiguously. “When you go to Rivertown next time, I can bring you guys to check out my restaurant.”

“Restaurant? Hospital?” Uncle Zhang felt relaxed when he heard what Wang Xian said. “That’s good. But the things you bought were too expensive.”

“It’s okay!” Wang Xian shook his head. “It’s not much. Don’t worry, Uncle Zhang. I’m rich enough to buy these things!”

“Oh well, you’ve grown up in the blink of an eye. You became more capable. That’s very good!” Uncle Zhang patted him on the shoulder with consolation.

“He is rich now!” The surrounding neighbors stared at Wang Xian with a surprised look.

They were jealous when they saw the gifts that Wang Xian sent to Uncle Zhang and his family.

Almost half a million worth of gifts, yet Wang Xian gave it readily to Uncle Zhang, and they might receive more in the future.

“I didn’t expect Xiao Xian to be earning big bucks now. That’s incredible. He’s a boss at such a young age.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“I thought so too. Xiao Xian is so clever. He will become somebody in the future. It’s happening now.”

“Xiao Xian is awesome at such a young age. He might become a millionaire in the future. Xiao Xian, don’t forget us in the future.”

The surrounding crowd praised Wang Xian with faces full of smiles as they curried favor.

Wang Xian smiled and nodded but did not utter a word.

Everyone felt embarrassed.

“Xiao Xian and Xiao Yu, have you had your lunch? It’s almost noon. I’ll make your lunch now!” Aunt Zhang stood up at this time as she asked them.

“Not yet. Thanks, Aunt Zhang.”

“Don’t stand on ceremony with me. You just arrived, right? Take a seat and chat with Uncle Zhang!”

Uncle Zhang opened up the cigarette packaging and distributed a box to each of the neighbors. He spoke with them for a while before they finally left.

“Xiao Li, brew the tea for your brother and me!” Uncle Zhang took out the tea leaves happily.

“Sure, Dad!”

“Xiao Xian, since you’re doing well, I feel at ease now. From now on, don’t buy these things for me anymore,” said Uncle Zhang to Wang Xian smilingly.

“Okay.” Wang Xian chuckled and asked with doubts, “Oh, Uncle. Who drove out just now when I was here?”

“Your future brother-in-law.” Uncle Zhang was obviously unhappy when he said this. “Sigh, let’s not talk about this. Xiao Xian, how’s school?”

Uncle Zhang changed the topic, and Wang Xian did not continue to ask. Instead, he chatted with Uncle Zhang about other things.

“Uncle Zhang, since Sister Li is getting married, aren’t you busy now?”

After lunch, Wang Xian saw Uncle Zhang sipping his tea relaxingly, and he raised his question.

“Nothing to be busy about. Since the banquet is managed by the hotel, it’s much more manageable than before,” Uncle Zhang answered.

“Oh, Uncle Zhang. Where’s your fishing rod? Let’s go fishing if you have nothing going on later.”

Lake Xianfeng was quite renowned in the entire southern province. The entire lake spanned thirty to forty kilometers, and the deepest area of the lake was more than ten meters deep.

Uncle Zhang even undertook an area at the Lake Xianfeng to rear fish.

Wang Xian had loved to fish since he was young. The fish that he caught mostly turned into food on the table.

“Fishing? We can’t fish anymore. This year, weird things have happened to Lake Xianfeng. Not a single fish could be found in it. Those fish that I reared in the fish pond this year were all gone. It’s very odd. All the families which reared fish incurred quite a loss!”

When Uncle Zhang talked about the fish, he frowned immediately.

“The fish were gone in all of Lake Xianfeng?” Wang Xian’s curiosity was piqued.

“Yes, it was bizarre. This even went on the news, and someone was sent to investigate. But there isn’t any conclusion to date. I reared more than 10,000 catties of fish, but now it’s all gone.” Uncle Zhang shook his head and sighed.

“Oh?” Wang Xian was even more doubtful.

Wang Xian and Xiao Yu returned to their home from Uncle Zhang’s place after 2 pm.

After they came back home, Xiao Yu smiled and asked Wang Xian, “Brother, do you know who Sister Li is marrying?”

“Not sure. Uncle Zhang looks like he didn’t want to talk about this, so I didn’t ask much.”

“She’s marrying someone from Rivertown. A rich second generation! I heard Sister Li say that his family is rich!”

“Really? But why did Uncle Zhang seem reluctant about this?” asked Wang Xian curiously.

“Brother, Sister Li told me that her future husband has some family issues.”

“What issues?” Wang Xian looked curiously at Xiaoyu.

“Sister Li’s husband came from a wealthy family. His family disagreed with this marriage in the beginning. But Sister Li’s husband loves her so much that they got a baby. That is why they had no choice but to agree.”

“Moreover, Sister Li told me that her husband’s parents were going to arrange a joint marriage with an equally wealthy family. Hence, even though they agreed to the marriage, they were not happy at all.”

“Simply said, they are looking down on Sister Li’s family. Hmph! What snobs!”

“This time, Uncle Zhang was angry about the bride’s car. Uncle Zhang’s original plan was to get the groom to fetch the bride from here since it is only a two-hour car ride from Rivertown. The atmosphere would be far more lively, and Uncle Zhang and his family would look good. Yet the other party’s parents turned this idea down because it was too troublesome. They wanted to ask Sister Li to set off from a hotel in Rivertown.”

“The man was a weakling too. He dared not defy what his father said. What was more infuriating was that Sister Li is getting married, but the guy did not help her at all. He said he was busy with his own family work. Don’t you feel angry too?”
