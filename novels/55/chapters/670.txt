Chapter 671: Xiao Yu’s battle (2)

“Wind Blast”

The young man waved his arm and a strong gust of wind that covered over a thousand meters swept towards Xiao Yu!

The Wind Blast swept across like a tornado. Xiao Yu snorted and a pair of bone wings appeared behind her in the next instant.

The bone wings emitted a black glow as she flapped them lightly.

Xiao Yu was unmoved as she charged through the approaching Wind Blast and directly towards the young man.

“What? This witch is really strong!” the young man exclaimed in surprise once again. Shifting his palm, sword after sword flew out from his space ring.

Each sword emitted a dense green glow with layers of wind blade circling it.

Weapon set!

A set of spiritual equipment made up of nine separate swords! Moreover, every single sword was a powerful Level 12 spiritual sword!

“Ten pieces of Level 12 spiritual equipment! He’s darned rich! The spiritual equipment on him definitely played a part in Feng Lingtian being the most demon-like talent in our Huang Cauldron world!”

“That girl isn’t simple at all. From her looks, she’s probably as old as Feng Lingtian. Yet, her strength is truly terrifying!”

“That girl has the strength of a Budding Realm expert and the spiritual equipment on her isn’t simple either. That’s a little beyond our expectation!”

“How can this be possible? Lingtian is the most outstanding talent in our Huang Cauldron world! Yet, he is on the losing end against another girl!”

Surrounding the battle, the crowd of people from the Huang Cauldron world looked on in shock at the battle between the young man and Xiao Yu.

The young man was the most demon-like talent in the entire Huang Cauldron world and the youngest son of their Immortal Sects. He had inherited the bloodline of his father.

He had reached the Budding Realm in his twenties and was undoubtedly the strongest among those at his age.

He was also considered by the disciples of Immortal Sects in Huang Cauldron world to be the most demon-like prince.

However, the most elite talent of their Huang Cauldron world was being pushed back by a girl in the real world where they had all believed the people were extremely weak.

To make things worse, the girl was roughly the age of Feng Lingtian!

Everyone was astonished, including Feng Jinqing, whose eyes were flickering.

“With your level of strength, what gives you the guts and confidence to call yourself young master and act arrogantly to me, your mom!?”

At this moment, Xiao Yu easily defended against the attacks from Feng Lingtian.

The bone wings behind her black flapped steadily and she held a bone sword in one hand and a shield with the other! Her defensive strength was insanely high.

Feng Lingtian’s attack couldn’t injure her in any way.

“YOU... This is what you are asking for! Saber Hurricane!”

Feng Lingtian was clearly embarrassed. He extended both of his arms and manipulated the ten pieces of Level 12 spiritual equipment to circulate around him.

“The body as the blade, slash!”

Boom!

Resembling a scale 10 hurricane, terrifying daggers of green-colored energy were forming rapidly around Feng Lingtian.

Green-colored energy gathered and formed into swords around him.

Spiritual swords and green wind blades that extended over a hundred meters surrounded the young man and rotated at an immense speed.

Wind attribute was easily one of the fastest among all elements.

Boom!

Following a series of bone-chilling whistles, the swords were launched towards Xiao Yu.

“I’ll show you my true strength!”

Xiao Yu had gotten serious. She shook the longsword in her arms and the bone sword extended. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

In an instant, the bone sword had turned into a black ivory whip that was several dozens of meters long.

Terrifying spikes that curved backwards were distributed throughout the ivory whip, making it look extremely gruesome.

Xiao Yu swung her arm down and the ivory whip was flicked towards the young man like an attacking viper!

The bone wings, bone shield, and even the ivory whip were part of Xiao Yu’s body. Controlling them was extremely easy.

The ivory whip penetrated through the Saber Hurricane and wrapped towards Feng Lingtian.

“F*ck!”

Feng Lingtian’s face darkened upon seeing the attacking ivory whip. The next instant, he directed the Level 12 spiritual swords around him towards the whip.

Pa!

However, the ivory whip wrapped itself around each long sword and eventually around Feng Lingtian before he could even react to it.

“Tsk! Let’s see if you still dare to fight with your mom!”

Xiao Yu pulled her arm back as she shouted. Feng Lingtian was extremely bitter. Just as he attempted to break free, the ivory whip extended even longer and had him completely subdued. His body flew towards Xiao Yu at a terrifying speed.

“Hey girl... Stop!”

Feng Jinqing was flabbergasted when he saw Feng Lingtian being trapped. He waved his arm and a wind blade slashed towards Xiao Yu.

Bam!

“It’s just sparring!”

Sun Lingxiu swung his arms and a ray of light met the wind blade, neutralizing it.

Bam!

Having retracted her ivory whip, Xiao Yu stepped on Feng Lingtian’s face as she asked, “Do you admit your defeat now!”

“YOU...”

A burning sensation cruised through his body as his face turn as dark as coal. He felt as though he had just been forced to eat shit.

Pa!

Xiao Yu waved her ivory whip which landed on his buttocks directly. At that moment, Feng Lingtian felt as though his flesh was split. Looking down at Feng Lingtian who was below her feet, Xiao Yu smirked and asked again, “Are you going to admit your defeat!?”

“Argh... YOU...!”

Feng Lingtian’s expression changed drastically. He felt that his pants had definitely split and there was definitely blood on his buttocks.

Moreover, he felt his face was completely swollen. This filled him with humiliation.

“Stop!”

Seeing that Sun Lingxiu stopped his attack, Feng Jinqing was slightly surprised.

When he witnessed Feng Lingtian being humiliated, the vibes around him changed and a terrifying explosion of aura erupted from him.

At that very moment, the color of the sky changed and the surrounding space seemed to have stopped.

There wasn’t a single gust of wind and everything was silent!

Tsk!

Xiao Yu was shocked by the aura from the old man. She pulled back the ivory whip in her hands and mocked Feng Lingtian. “Coward! I look down on you. What kind of man are you if you are asking the elder in your family to stand up for you after losing to me!”

“You, you, you...”

Feng Lingtian was extremely bitter and stared at Xiao Yu. His eyes were full of indignance and anger.

“What are you looking at! If you’ve got the guts, let’s go for a one-on-one battle again!”

Xiao Yu gave him a thumbs down with disdain.

“You have gone too far!”

Feng Lingtian almost threw up blood upon seeing Xiao Yu’s expression. He was the demon-like prince of the Huang Cauldron world and yet he had not lost in the hands of a little brat in the real world.

Moreover, his face had been stepped on and his buttocks whipped by her. This...

His pride as a man was completely shattered!

Around them, members of the higher management of the Yellow Sky Immortal Sect were dumbfounded at the words of their prince. Their expressions were a great scene to witness.

However, while they were astonished, they were also shocked by Xiao Yu’s strength.

Terrifying!

He wasn’t called the most demon-like prince in the Huang Cauldron world for nothing. He was also the strongest disciple among the younger generation of the three Immortal Sects.

“I bully you and you are getting your elders?”

Xiao Yu lifted her head with contempt, making Feng Lingtian almost throw up blood from anger. He rubbed his face and still threw up after failing to keep it in.

“Haha! Great! Who would have expected this! Who would have expected these girls to possess such strength in the Underworld and to have established such a powerful Dragon Sect!”

At this moment, Jin Kunming’s eyes lit up. He stared at Xiao Yu and said, “I represent the Immortal Realm Excellencies of our Primeval Chaos Immortal Sect. Join our Primeval Chaos Immortal Sect and I’ll grant you girls three Elders’ positions and a large amount of spiritual equipment and elixir pills.

“I’m sorry. We have said that we aren’t going to join any Immortal Sect!”

Lan Qingyue looked across and shook her head at them.

“The Nine Cauldron Worlds will descend into the real world soon. The Immortal Sects will rule the world. There are things you can’t control while being in the Underworld. Even if you don’t wish to, you still have to accept it!”

Jin Kunming squinted his eyes as he looked at Lan Qingyue and the girls.
