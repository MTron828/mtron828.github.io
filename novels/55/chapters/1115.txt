“The weak are prey to the strong, and the strong are the Kings!”

Prime Minister Gui heard his words and said indifferently without any expression.

“If you are stronger than us, we are willing to submit to you and give this place to you!”

Prime Minister GUI continued with a genial expression, “If you feel that you are weaker than us, then join us. Don’t worry. In Our Dragon Palace, we will help you to improve your strength and your bloodline. Submitting to us is definitely the best choice for your wind-eye Clan!”

Wang Xian looked at Prime Minister Gui’s expression and felt a little impressed. If Prime Minister Gui wasn’t too hot-tempered, he wouldn’t be as arrogant as if he would die if he didn’t submit. He wouldn’t be the slightest bit weak either.

This head butler of the Dragon Palace did a good job. He was indeed a talent who was well-versed in all the history and literature on Earth.

If Prime Minister Gui didn’t use him 100% , Wang Xian wouldn’t even dare to use such a person. Who knows when he would take you down. He was too awesome.

“HMPH, you guys don’t have the ability to make us submit to you!”

The leader of the Wind Eye clan revealed an angry expression. With a move of his arm, the Longbow on his back appeared in his hand.

“Eye of the wind, arrow of the Wind!”

He shouted softly and pulled his arm. A green arrow flashed with a green glow and shot towards Xiao Lan in an instant.

The terrifying arrow shot towards Blue’s eyes.

Blue saw the terrifying arrow and slowly closed its eyes. Gray energy flickered around its body as the gray energy gathered towards its eyelids.

“Boom!”

A terrifying explosion sounded, but the shockwave from the explosion was completely blocked by the gray energy on Blue’s body.

If it wasn’t for its resistance, the aftershock alone would have affected a radius of a thousand meters.

“What a terrifying attack. It’s much stronger than the leader of the Blood Barbaric Demonic Beast!”

Wang Xian revealed a surprised expression and his pupils contracted slightly.

“Clap Clap Clap!”

“This leader is very strong. Speaking of which, he’s much stronger than me!”

Prime Minister Gui saw the attack of the leader of the Wind Eye clan and clapped with a smile on his face.

“Humph, let me tell you. The Wind Eye clan will not join Your Dragon Palace, and you can forget about forcing us to join. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being rude!”

The leader of the Wind Eye clan narrowed his eyes slightly when he saw that the giant beast was not injured at all. Then, he said with a cold face.

“There are only benefits and no disadvantages for you to join our Dragon Palace!”

Prime Minister Gui was full of smiles. Then, he looked at the people behind the leader of the wind-eye clan and said with a smile, “Let’s do it!”

The moment he finished his words.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The sound of blows came from the back.

“Not good! Watch your back!”

“Watch Out!”

The faces of the entire wind-eye clan changed dramatically as they shouted.

“What is it!”

However, when the group of Wind Eye clan’s clansmen turned their heads to look, their expressions changed drastically.

At this moment, there were already over a hundred clansmen lying on the ground. Their bodies fell straight to the ground.

They only saw a flash of white spots. In the end, over a hundred clansmen were killed in an instant?

“You dare to kill my clansmen!”

The leader of the Wind Eye clan turned his gaze over. Streaks of blood appeared in his eyes as he furiously roared.

“Leader... leader, they are not dead. They are just unconscious!”

A member of the wind-eye clan hurriedly walked over to check and said.

“What? They are not dead?”

The leader of the wind-eye clan let out a sigh of relief.

“Yes, they are not dead. However, we can kill them easily. Our Dragon Palace sincerely invites all of you to join us!”

Prime Minister Gui’s voice came through, and he said with a smile.

The leader of the Wind Eye clan looked extremely embarrassed. This was a blatant threat!

“What if I don’t agree?”

The leader of the Wind Eye clan asked with a dark face.

“The strong prey on the weak, right?”

Prime Minister Gui said with a smile.

It was just the law of the jungle!

He understood this principle. The strong prey on the weak. This was the survival rule of demon beasts, fierce beasts, and even humans, and even the entire transcendental continent.

When the weak were killed, no one sympathized, because the strong wanted to develop.

Feng Yan was slightly silent. He looked at his subordinates lying on the ground, his expression extremely unsightly. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Just now, his gaze swept the surroundings, and he could see many spots of light hidden there.

There were more than a hundred of them.

He could see the Hidden Demon Beast Race, but his clansmen, whose strength had not reached the profound void realm, could not discover them at all.

At this moment, the group of light spots had already disappeared, and no one knew where they were hiding.

This made him, who had an eye technique, extremely solemn.

If he didn’t submit, then the strong would prey on the weak. To put it simply, he wanted to attack them.

He didn’t dare to guarantee that he would be able to escape. This sudden appearance of the Dragon Palace was too mysterious.

As for his clansmen, he was certain that they wouldn’t be able to escape the assassination of the white spots!

“We are not slaves to join you!”

The leader of the Wind Eye clan took a deep breath and said with an embarrassed expression.

“We will not let a Demon Beast clan with a profound void martial artist become a slave. If you join the Dragon Palace, you will be the leader of the Wind Arrow Division of the Dragon Palace. Your position will be second only to Prime Minister Gui!”

At this moment, Wang Xian spoke directly.

The leader of the Wind Eye clan looked at Wang Xian deeply. He gritted his sharp teeth and nodded his head heavily. “Alright, our wind eye clan agrees!”

“It’s one thing for you to agree. You still need to pass through the Dragon Gate. Only by passing through the Dragon Gate will you be qualified to become a member of our Dragon Palace!”

Prime Minister Gui smiled and pointed at the Dragon Gate behind him!

“It’s just an entrance. What’s so difficult about passing through it?”

The leader of the Wind Eye clan had a solemn expression.

“Take it!”

Wang Xian flicked his finger and a drop of blood that was emitting a golden glow flew in front of the leader of the Wind Eye clan.

Looking at this drop of blood, he was shocked. “What kind of blood is this? How can it possess such pure energy and a vast will?”

“You’ll know once you take it. Remember, don’t resist!”

Wang Xian said solemnly.

The leader of the Wind Eye clan showed hesitation on his face. In the end, he swallowed it directly.

Instantly, the vast will wanted to enter his mind.

“Don’t resist. It Won’t hurt you at all!”

Wang Xian’s voice rang out again, causing the leader of the Wind Eye clan to have a drastic change in expression.

He could sense the terrifying bloodline contained in the blood, but he could also sense the will contained in the blood.

Consuming it would bring unimaginable benefits to his bloodline, but he would have to pay a price.

“Consume it. It’s a demon beast at the insightful void level. If he is unwilling, we can’t subdue it at all.”

Wang Xian stared at the leader of the Wind Eye clan.

After a full minute, a smile finally appeared on Wang Xian’s face.
