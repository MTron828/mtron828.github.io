Chapter 3218: 3217 dragon-seizing palace, annihilating Sky Sea Dragon King

“Just you wait.”

Sky Sea Dragon King let out a ferocious roar as the crown of a acquired true treasure wrapped around him.

The Dragon Palace was right in front of him.

However, he didn’t notice that the Dragon Palace was trembling slightly. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Boom! Boom! Boom

At this time, a Level 5 universe knight from the Horned Seal race waved a terrifying golden diamond toward Sky Sea Dragon King from behind him.

“Humph!”

Sky Sea Dragon King sensed the attack from behind him, snorted, and continued to fly forward.

With the defensive power of his acquired true treasure, it was enough to block this attack.

Peng

A terrifying collision sound was heard, and cracks appeared on Sky Sea Dragon King’s defense.

“Damn it, the acquired true treasure on his body is too powerful.”

Seeing that his full-power attack was blocked, the great beings of the horned seal race had ugly expressions and were somewhat envious.

Acquired Supreme Treasure! He didn’t even have such a treasure.

If he wanted to obtain an acquired supreme treasure, he would need a great opportunity, or there was only one way to enter the heaven splitting chaotic land.

“Hahaha!”

The Sky Sea Dragon King laughed wildly and dragged his injured body forward.

In the next second, he would be able to enter his own Dragon Palace.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

However, at this moment, the Tianhai dragon palace trembled violently and suddenly flew away in a strange manner.

The Tianhai Dragon King, who was flying toward his own Dragon Palace, was stunned. He opened his mouth slightly, and his expression changed drastically.

Buzz

His expression changed drastically, and his body quickly turned illusory.

Bang

“Hahaha, Tianhai Dragon King, I want to see how you can escape without your Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian saw the Dragon Palace flying towards the distance at a terrifying speed. Knowing that Ao Jin had succeeded, a smile appeared on his face.

He interrupted ao Jin’s thoughts of escaping back to his Dragon Palace in an instant. Narrowing his eyes slightly, he charged towards the Tianhai Dragon King.

“What have you done? What have you done to My Dragon Palace? !”

When the Tianhai Dragon King saw that his dragon palace was fleeing, he wanted to control it to fly over from afar. However, he was met with a huge resistance.

This caused his expression to change drastically. He glared at Wang Xian with his blood-red eyes and roared furiously.

“Haha, What Have You Done? Don’t you want to snatch my bloodline? It’s impolite not to reciprocate. This time, I Will Snatch Your Dragon Palace and take your life.”

Wang Xian smiled faintly and looked at him mockingly.

Without the Dragon Palace, under their siege, even if he had a acquired Supreme Treasure, he was definitely not their match.

“Surround and kill him!”

Wang Xian said in a sinister tone. The five elements grinding mill directly attacked the Tianhai Dragon King.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The willow deity and the heaven formation’s attack arrived. The terrifying power directly covered the Tianhai Dragon King.

“Return this Dragon King’s Dragon Palace, return this Dragon King’s Dragon Palace!”

The Tianhai Dragon King roared somewhat crazily. He wanted to chase after his Dragon Palace.

The Tianhai Dragon Palace was his last trump card. Once he lost the Tianhai Dragon Palace, everything would be over.

Losing his bloodline, losing his Dragon Palace, everything would be over.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

The five elements great mill and the willow deity sky array’s attacks landed on the Tianhai Dragon King, causing his acquired Supreme Treasure’s defense to completely collapse.

“Eh? They actually took away the Tianhai Dragon King’s Dragon Palace?”

The experts of the horned seal race and the Gemini race, who were standing to the side, revealed astonished expressions.

Their eyes flickered as they directly attacked the Tianhai Dragon King.

“No, no, no, I, the Tianhai Dragon King, am not resigned.”

The Tianhai Dragon King saw the group of people surrounding him and felt the terrifying energy. His face revealed a terrified expression.

With his current strength, he was no match for them.

The Dragon Palace had been stolen away. What awaited him was the possibility of destruction.

“Kill, Kill, Kill!”

He attacked Wang Xian and the rest with a crazed expression, flapping his huge wings.

“Die, Beast!”

The eyes of the elite from the horned seal race were filled with coldness.

He moved and rushed over. His terrifying long tail swept towards the Sky Sea Dragon King.

With the Sky Sea Dragon King’s strength, he could barely fight against a level five universe knight.

However, if it was a life-and-death battle, he was still no match for him.

Not to mention, there was also Wang Xian and the other experts.

At this moment, the Sky Sea Dragon King did not have the ability to resist.

“Bang!”

The huge force caused his body to start to collapse, with cracks appearing one after another.

“Heavenly Dragon Eight Tribes!”

Wang Xian growled in a low voice. The Shadows of the eight Divine Dragons attacked the Tianhai Dragon King from all directions.

The attacks of the two experts of the twin species also covered the area.

“No, no, no!”

Terrified and desperate screams were heard.

“No, no!”

At the side, the great demons controlled by the Tianhai Dragon King and the supremacies of the Xingjiang clan revealed terrified expressions in their eyes.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

At the Tianhai Dragon King’s side, streams of terrifying energy were extinguishing the life force of the Tianhai Dragon King.

Ten seconds later, the Tianhai Dragon King was completely annihilated.

“No!”

At the side, the bodies of all the great demons and venerables controlled by the Tianhai Dragon King trembled. The life force on their bodies also quickly disappeared.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept over and he raised his eyebrows slightly.

“What a terrifying control technique.”

He muttered.

“Whoosh!”

At this moment, Wang Xian saw the expert from the horned seal race moving and flying toward the Tianhai Dragon King rapidly.

He moved his palm and grabbed the crown on the head of the Tianhai Dragon King.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and moved his body. He reached out his hand and grabbed the body of the Tianhai Dragon King.

Buzz

However, just as he was about to grab it, the expert from the horned seal race waved his arm and directly put the Tianhai Dragon King’s corpse into his bag.

“You took away the acquired treasure and you want to take away the corpse as well?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly and said faintly.

“Your Dragon Palace has obtained the Tianhai Dragon King’s Dragon Palace. Your Harvest is greater than ours.”

The expert from the horned seal race frowned slightly and said.

“Without us taking the Sky Sea Dragon Palace away, can you destroy the Sky Sea Dragon King?”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled as he said indifferently.

However, he did not snatch it away from the experts from the horned seal race.

The corpse of the Sky Sea Dragon King was comparable to the corpse of a universe knight at level four.

There was another one not far away.

Furthermore, the Star River clan and the other great demons’corpses numbered in the hundreds.

He moved and immediately grabbed towards the Star River clan’s clan leader’s corpse.

“HM?”

When he flew over, the eyes of the two women from the Snake Lady clan flickered.

Their bodies moved and similarly grabbed towards the Star River clan’s clan leader’s corpse.

Beside the corpse of the Xingjiang clan’s clan leader was a powerful acquired spiritual treasure, Chi Yang.

“Scram!”

Wang Xian’s eyes turned cold when he saw the two women from the Sheji clan trying to snatch the treasure from him.

The horned seal race was in cahoots with the Sheji clan. Do you want more treasures?
