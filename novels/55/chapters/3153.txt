Chapter 3154: Three Clans vs Dragon Palace 3

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

“The members of the Dragon Palace below are ready. TSK, TSK, tsk!”

“They didn’t run away. They are very confident. In that case, kill them all.”

The skeleton island was slowly approaching from the top of the Dragon Palace. It was as if they were crushing everything in their way. Wherever they passed, the water of the Milky Way would rush to the surroundings.

A vast and terrifying energy was being emitted towards the surroundings.

At the front, the eyes of the nine swords clan leader, the skeleton clan leader, and the blood violent clan leader were sparkling as they looked down.

The gigantic skeleton island also came to a stop slowly.

“Eh?”

At this moment, when they noticed the nine wind divine dragons swaying behind Wang Xian, their pupils contracted slightly.

“Is that the legendary wind divine dragon? is that a purebred divine dragon?”

The Knights of the skeleton race roared in a low voice as their eyes flickered with a crazy ghostly flame.

“I can sense a powerful bloodline power. I can sense a powerful bloodline power!”

The Universe Knight of the bloodthirsty race also roared in a low voice. He was in a crazy state. “It’s even stronger than the bloodline power of the Sky Dragon Race!”

“It’s these nine godly dragons. Rumor has it that the Dragon Palace has nine pure-blooded wind godly dragons. It seems possible.”

The leader of the nine blade race also said excitedly.

Pure-blooded godly dragons!

Such powerful bloodline power could upgrade their bloodlines and make them break through.

“We must capture those nine godly dragons and destroy the Dragon Palace.”

The golden skeleton clan leader was also roaring in his heart as he stared at Wang Xian intently.

“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, Hahaha. You didn’t expect that our nine swords clan would come back, did you?”

The nine swords clan leader shifted his gaze to Wang Xian as he roared ferociously.

“Hehe, it’s just a stray dog. We can easily crush your nine swords clan to death.”

When Wang Xian heard the chief’s words, he looked at him with a mocking expression.

The nine swords race was nothing to the Dragon Palace.

Even the skeleton race was nothing to them.

He looked at the blood-condensed figure and narrowed his eyes slightly. “I wonder what race you are? I don’t think our Dragon Palace has any enmity with you, right? You Dare to attack our Dragon Palace, aren’t you afraid of Our Revenge?”

“Haha, If You Want Us not to attack you, it’s simple. Give us the nine divine dragons behind you, and we can consider letting you go.”

The clan leader of the Blood Evil clan laughed crazily. His expression changed as he spoke, looking abnormally terrifying.

“Destroy us? You also have this ability. Our Dragon Palace doesn’t kill nameless people. A bunch of dog Sh * t, tell us your name!”

Ba Qi stared at the leader of the bloodthirsty race, who seemed to be condensed from blood, and shouted coldly.

“Hahaha, we, the bloodthirsty race, will let you all die a clear death. If you are destroyed, you will know who killed you.”

The leader of the bloodthirsty race laughed maniacally as blood flowed on his body.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Just as Wang Xian and the rest were confronting each other, universe knights appeared around them.

They were standing in the distance and looking in their direction.

When they heard the words of the leader of the bloodthirsty race, they were shocked.

“Bloodthirsty race, it’s that bloodthirsty race. The skeleton race actually allied with them!”

“Hiss, it’s that bloodthirsty race? The bloodthirsty race that was almost exterminated by the Sky Dragon Race? Why are they here?”

“The bloody clan was very powerful back then. There were more than 30 universe knights in the clan, but they were almost exterminated by the Heavenly Dragon Clan. Only a portion of them managed to escape. I didn’t expect the skeleton race to ally with the bloody clan to exterminate the Dragon Palace.”

Some of the knights around were shocked when they heard this name.

The bloody clan was a powerful race in the starry sky of the Ancient Painting God sect. They used to be very powerful. They disappeared after being exterminated by the Heavenly Dragon Clan hundreds of millions of years ago.

Who would have thought that they would suddenly appear today.

They even wanted to wipe out the dragon palace.

“The skeleton race came prepared this time. Nine swords, the skeleton race, and the bloodthirsty race. The three races combined have the ability to wipe out the Dragon Palace!”

“The three universe primary races combined. They are completely prepared.”

“The Dragon Palace is going to be in trouble this time.”

The Knights of the universe primary races looked over, their eyes shining.

“HM? The bloodthirsty race, it’s them?”

On the right, two universe knights from the ancient painting sect flew over. When they saw the bloodthirsty race, they raised their eyebrows slightly.

The ancient painting sect was very clear about the bloodthirsty sect, and both sides were considered enemies.

The Heavenly Dragon Clan had exterminated the blood ruthlessness clan, and their ancient painting divine sect had a good relationship with the Heavenly Dragon Clan, so the enemies of their friends were naturally not much better.

“Left protector, do you think it’s possible that the blood ruthlessness clan killed Venerable Lou Shan and the others?”

The venerable from the ancient painting sect said as he slightly narrowed his eyes.

The left Protector raised his brows. With a wave of his arm, a white disk appeared once again, and a drop of blood floated on it.

At this moment, the blood on it changed instantly.

“What?”

The expert from the ancient painting sect focused his eyes and stared at it.

Soon, shadows appeared in the White Mirror.

The shadows looked blurry, but one could tell who they were from the outline.

“They are not from the bloodthirsty race!”

“They are from the Dragon Palace!”

The left protector stared at him, his eyes full of anger.

“It’s the Dragon Palace. They really killed him. No wonder the Dragon King didn’t give us any face at the last banquet. It turns out that the Dragon Palace killed Venerable Lou Shan.”

The Venerable of the ancient painting sect growled with murderous intent.

They turned their heads and stared in the direction of the Dragon Palace, full of murderous intent.

“Dragon Palace, I didn’t expect you to kill the vice sect leader of our ancient art sect. You killed our people. Even if you aren’t killed today, our ancient art sect will completely destroy you.”

The left Protector moved and approached the front, roaring with killing intent. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“What?”

“What’s going on? Dragon Palace killed Lou Shan Knight of the Ancient Art Sect?”

“This… Hiss!”

The two knights from the ancient painting sect suddenly flew out and roared with killing intent, causing the universe knights hiding in the Void to be slightly shocked, their faces filled with shock.

Even the nine blade race and the skeleton race were slightly stunned, their faces filled with shock.

No one had expected that Lou Shan Knight was actually destroyed by the Dragon Palace.

This… they were too unscrupulous.

The ancient painting sect was very powerful. They had 60 to 70 universe knights, and they had more than one universe Knight Level 3 warrior.

They dared to offend such a force. This time, even if the skeleton race, the nine blade race, and the bloodthirsty race couldn’t destroy the Dragon Palace, the Dragon Palace would be destroyed by the ancient painting sect soon.
