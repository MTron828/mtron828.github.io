Translator: 549690339

“Roar Roar Roar! ”

“Boom Boom Boom! ”

The sounds of battle rang out continuously.

The attack power of the three demonic beasts was abnormally terrifying!

The three of them were fighting on their own. When they attacked one demonic beast, the next second, the other two might explode!

In fact, their attacks were indiscriminately all-rounded attacks, and their opponents were all enveloped within!

“Lin Niu, Rotten Bird, I advise you to return to my body. I will lead you to the Great Dao of Heavenly Yuan creation! ”

In front of them, the Demon Hunter King roared with a face full of killing intent. His body trembled. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Behind him, terrifying sharp thorns attacked the two demonic beasts, Lin Niu and rotten bird!

His Bone Thorn’s attack was extremely terrifying. Wherever it passed, cracks would appear in the void!

The terrifying energy carried the surrounding energy and formed a terrifying dark spear.

This dark spear seemed to fly out of the terrifying Abyss and attacked the other two magical beasts!

As for the other two magical beasts.

The Unicorn and one-eyed unicorn ox was covered in blood-red scales. These scales were shining with a luster.

There were symbols on them. These symbols were like musical symbols.

They kept flying out of his scales.

The moment they flew out, these symbols turned into mountains, swords, giant beasts, and all sorts of other things.

They contained terrifying offensive power!

The bird-like rotten bird flapped its wings slightly, and the entire starry sky fell with a terrifying rain of corrosion.

The instant this rain of corrosion fell, it formed a special space between heaven and earth!

The entire sky seemed to have become his domain.

A terrifying domain!

“The strength of these demonic beasts is definitely not inferior to mine!” Wang Xian looked at their battle with a look of shock in his eyes!

These three demonic beasts were obviously formed from the four limbs of an elite in the Heaven’s origin realm.

Having cultivated to this stage, they had even gained intelligence!

However, Wang Xian did not understand why they would fight.

By devouring the other party, they could become an existence at the Heaven’s origin realm?

He was astonished.

From a distance, he stared at them quietly!

In the surrounding area, all the demonic beasts that were above level eight were also looking at them in awe.

The suppression from the bloodlines of the three demonic beasts made them afraid to move!

The battle continued!

Time passed day by day!

When Wang Xian saw this scene, his eyes sparkled.

“Hahaha, you’ve been fighting with us for half a year. It’s about time. It’s almost time for you to die! ”

Five months later, the demon hunter King suddenly became violent in front of them.

Terrifying bone spikes suddenly appeared on his back!

Each of the blood-red bone spikes was thousands of meters long.

Most importantly, his bone spikes were thick and sharp, glowing with light!

This demon hunter King went berserk!

His strength was clearly the strongest among the three demonic beasts.

And now, he was the first to go berserk!

“Roar Roar, Demon Hunter King, do you think we’re afraid of You? Lin Niu, let’s cripple his claws first! ”

The rotten bird saw the demon hunter king go berserk and his cold eyes were filled with blood as he roared loudly!

He roared and went berserk as well.

Waves of dark power surged out from his body.

This dark power condensed into a liquid and the black liquid revolved around him!

“Both of you will die if you devour my children! ”

The horns on the head of the unicorn ox shone with a luster, and it also went berserk!

Its body began to grow larger, and the light on its scales became even more blood -red.

A single scale was like a terrifying weapon!

It was like a terrifying weapon of war!

There was clearly a deep blood feud between the three of them.

They didn’t join forces to fight the other one at all!

The three demonic beasts went berserk at the same time.

An even more terrifying battle erupted!

Wang Xian was not far away. He watched the battle escalate and watched quietly.

This was the real battle.

A battle that was close to the Heaven’s origin level.

Even if an expert who was at the peak of the universe’s ruler stepped into it, he would be crushed and exploded by their violent energy!

Too strong!

Simply too strong!

Wang Xian was also slightly surprised.

If these three demonic beasts were to surround and attack him, they would probably be able to kill him completely!

The battle continued.

More than ten days passed.

The three demonic beasts were completely bloodthirsty and their aura didn ‘t decrease!

Their violent state was enough for them to last for a long time!

“Roar, you two stupid things. You are just a piece of flesh that fell from my body. Today, I will take it back completely. Die! ”

“Today, I will show you the majesty of the Mad Demon, the shadow of the sky demon agar. ”

Half a month later, the demon hunter King suddenly let out a wild roar.

The voice in his mouth changed!

The next moment, he suddenly spread out his arms!

An extremely terrifying shadow of the Demon God appeared behind him.

This shadow of the Demon God was similar to the Demon Hunter Beast, but it looked dozens of times more ferocious!

The terrifying shadow was exuding an incomparably terrifying aura.

When Wang Xian felt this aura, his expression changed drastically!

“This aura is many times stronger than the one unleashed by the Demon Hunter King Just Now! ”

Wang Xian’s eyes narrowed and a shocked expression appeared on his face. “Has he touched upon the realm of the Heaven’s origin creation?”

He was extremely shocked. After hesitating for a moment, he took a few steps back!

The sudden eruption of the demon hunter King’s terrifying strength could crush him directly!

“Damn it, Demon Hunter King, no, you’re Not Demon Hunter King, you’ve been invaded, you’ve been invaded! ”

When the rotten bird saw the demon hunter King’s sudden burst of power and the terrifying shadow of the demon god, its expression changed drastically as it roared in fear!

“How is this possible? Agar Heavenly Demon God? Agar Heavenly Demon God is in the Mad Demon Universe, how can he be here? Demon Hunter King, stop playing tricks! ”

Lin Niu’s gaze also focused as he roared with a face full of shock and anger!

“You two fellows, I gave birth to you with my flesh and blood. You Don’t know how to repay me with gratitude, so I can only crush you and completely devour you!

At this moment, Demon Hunter King was abnormally terrifying.

His aura was completely different from before!

Just now, his body contained the metal and darkness attributes, but now, there was an additional Earth attribute!

The energy that was mixed together was abnormally violent.

In addition to its special body, the demonic God shadow behind it was much stronger and more powerful than before!

“Shadow enveloping, demonic god Embrace!”

The Demon Hunter King Roared, and the demonic god shadow behind it spread its arms and directly enveloped the two demonic beasts, the rotten bird and the Qilin ox!

When the demon god Shadow spread its arms, it seemed to embrace the entire world!
