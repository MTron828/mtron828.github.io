Chapter 3139: 3138 Dragon Palace came here to exterminate the dragon race

“Dragon Palace, come here to exterminate the Dragon Race!”

A cold and dignified voice sounded in the mountain base of the dragon race.

The sudden appearance of the Little Blue House attracted everyone’s attention.

Their appearance immediately alerted the entire dragon race.

“What?”

“The Dragon clan is here to exterminate the entire clan? The Dragon Clan is here to attack us?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Look up! are those the two space beasts of the Dragon Clan?”

Below them was the base camp of the Dragon Clan.

When the disciples below saw the space beasts, they were shocked.

“All members of the Dragon Clan, prepare to attack!”

Wang Xian shouted and ordered.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The next moment, the 500,000 members of the Dragon Palace from Xiao Lan’s little house flew down.

They did not hesitate at all. Streams of powerful energy blasted downwards.

Wang Xian waved his arm and the crescent moon rose into the sky. Images appeared in front of him.

Combining with the information he obtained in his mind, his gaze landed on a mountain peak in front of him.

“Seal that place!”

He waved his arm.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Sky Array, ao crab, and the others did not hesitate at all and immediately attacked that mountain peak.

“Oh no, the Dragon Palace is attacking!”

“Damn it, the dragon palace actually dares to attack our dragon race and even attacked our Dragon Mountain. They really think we are easy to bully.”

A powerful energy descended from the ground toward the mountain. All the disciples of the Dragon Clan turned pale and quickly dodged to the side.

Buzz

At this moment, on the mountain in the middle of the Dragon Mountain, the Patriarch of the Dragon Clan and two old men moved and instantly appeared in a large hall at the top of the mountain.

They stood in the hall and looked around with embarrassed expressions.

“The Dragon Palace is attacking us. They are attacking us!”

The leader of the Dragon Race looked furious. He looked at the Great Beings from the Dragon Palace who were attacking them, and his eyes were cold.

“Activate the Defense Array!”

“Activate Dragon Mountain!”

“We have been standing in the universe for hundreds of millions of years. How can we be so easy to bully?”

“Dragon Palace? Do you really think you can destroy us? Kill, Kill, Kill!”

A Universe Knight of the Dragon Race Stared at the sky and roared furiously.

“Inform the nine-blade race to come over and support us. If we are destroyed, the Dragon Palace will definitely attack the nine-blade race.”

Another universe knight roared with a gloomy face.

They had never thought that the Dragon Palace would attack them.

According to their guess, the Dragon Palace wasn’t strong enough to invade them.

But now, the Army of the Dragon Palace had arrived.

However, the dragon race had been standing for billions of years, and they weren’t weak either.

They weren’t without foundation.

Especially their base camp, which had been built into an iron wall after billions of years of operation.

“Dragon Mountain, move!”

“Go out and fight!”

The leader of the Dragon Race roared coldly.

He moved and instantly appeared outside the palace.

“All Disciples of the dragon race, face the enemy. All experts, organize the battle!”

“Dragon Palace, our Dragon Race has established the universe for so long. How can we be destroyed so easily? Today, we will make you pay the price!”

The leader of the dragon race shouted and stared coldly at the sky array ao crab and the others.

Feeling their power, his pupils shrank.

“Two level two knights?”

He focused his eyes and shouted again, “Dragon Mountain, Rise!”

Rumble

Roar! Roar! Roar

The entire mountain range let out a loud noise.

The incomparably huge mountain range actually slowly rose up, and waves of terrifying power flew out from the mountain range.

In front of them, a mountain peak that looked like a dragon’s head raised its head and stared at the sky array ao crab and the others.

The entire mountain range seemed to have survived.

“Rumble!”

The mountain range that was over 10,000 kilometers in length directly attacked the sky array ao crab.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

“Let us pay the price. You Don’t have the right to do so. You dragon-descent race actually dare to chase after our Dragon King and kill the Asian Dragon. Today, we will make you disappear from the universe.”

The sky array looked at the mountain range that was emitting a terrifying power, and a cold expression appeared in his eyes.

He waved his arm, and a vast array formation was formed.

Ao he turned into a devouring dragon and attacked the leader of the Dragon Race.

“HMPH, you want to destroy us? Today, I’ll show you all the power of the Dragon Race!”

The leader of the Dragon Race moved and flew to the head of the mountain range. His eyes were filled with killing intent.

He held the dragon bone scepter and waved it at Ao he. “Two level 2 knights from Your Dragon Palace? You want to destroy us? Dream On!”

Hong

Within the Dragon Bone Scepter, a blood mist condensed into the shape of a godly dragon and attacked ao crab.

“Two?”

“Roar!”

Ao Crab’s eyes revealed a look of mockery. His body shook and roars came from within his body.

Three devouring dragons that were almost the same size as him flew out from his body.

Roar

One of the devouring dragons looked at the godly dragon formed by the blood mist and waved its terrifying claws.

Hong

The blood mist dissipated.

“Puny Ones, kill him!”

Ao Crab Laughed Sinisterly and roared loudly, attacking the leader of the dragon race.

Around him, three devouring dragons stood on both sides, exuding an overwhelming power.

“What? Four universe knights at level two!”

Seeing the swallowing dragons that suddenly flew out of Ao crab’s body, the face of the leader of the dragon race changed drastically.

“No wonder they dared to invade our dragon race. So they have five universe knights at level two.”

He looked very embarrassed. He waved his dragon bone, and the 10,000-mile-long mountain range below him shot out huge mountains and smashed toward them.

“Array formation, cleansing candle!”

At this moment, the Heaven Array Formation was formed behind them. A beam of light that contained the essence of everything swept forward.

The entire void was directly enveloped by a dazzling light.

“Damn it, that fellow is a powerful array formation master!”

His expression changed as the ten thousand li mountain range beneath him formed a defensive wall.

Weng

The light swept past, and the leader’s eyes revealed a trace of fear.

The enemy’s strength was beyond their imagination.

“Black Screen Formation, activate!”

At this time, a cold roar came from the side.

Black fog surged out from the mountains and spread towards the sky.

The black fog condensed into many wyverns that looked like vengeful spirits, and they covered everyone in the Dragon Palace.

The two remaining knights of the dragon race controlled the formation and glanced over at the leader with an awkward expression.
