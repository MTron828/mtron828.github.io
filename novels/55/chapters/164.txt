Chapter 165: Painful Price

The sarcastic tone stunned Mr. and Mrs. Wei, Wei Zhiwen, and the rest of their relatives and friends.

Anger flashed within Wei Qingguo’s eyes. He bet the in-laws wanted to embarrass them.

“Our Wei Family is preparing a grand wedding...you...” Wei Qingguo lifted his head with a furious look as he traced the source of the voice.

However, he froze before he could finish his sentence as he looked shockingly at the six people in front of him.

“Director Miao, Director Li, Manager Fang, Director Zhao, Director Heng, and Director Wu!”

When Wei Qingguo saw them, his pupils could not help but constrict. All six of them were people whom he needed to fawn upon. Why? Why are they here?

“Hello, Director Wei.”

Miao Zhiyong smiled at Wei Qingguo with a sarcastic look on his face. “Today, we are here to send the bride off. But, we didn’t expect to wait this long. The bride came, and yet, you were slow in receiving her. You don’t even have basic manners. Director Wei, you’re doing things the wrong way!”

“Yes, yes. It was our oversight!” Miao Zhiyong spoke as if he was teaching a lesson to Wei Qingguo. But Wei Qingguo did not dare to be displeased about it. He hurriedly bowed and apologized.

“If you want the bride to come out of the car, you should at least prepare some red packets!” Director Zhao beside him grinned at Wei Qingguo. [1]

“Yes, I got it. We’ll prepare them right away!” Wei Qingguo apologized with a nod, even though he was full of surprise.

Why? Why did these six people come with the bride’s wedding car?

Was it a coincidence or...?

Uncle Zhang, Aunt Zhang, and Sister Li were shocked to see this. What was going on?

Why did Wei Qingguo treat those six people beside Xiao Xian with so much respect?

The relatives and friends behind Wei Qingguo were equally surprised when they saw this.

Among them, some recognized Miao Zhiyong and the rest.

All six people had a great influence on Wei Family’s business.

“Yes, we’ll get it done now,” said the middle-aged lady quickly with a constant mixed expression.

“If you don’t have the red packet, that’s fine. You can always give something else!” Wang Xian smiled nonchalantly at Wei Qingguo and his wife.

“What else?”

Wei Qingguo knit his eyebrow slightly when he heard Wang Xian. Radiance flickered in his eyes as he stared at Wang Xian, unsure of his identity.

“Since it’s for the bride, it’s as good as switching the gift from your left hand to your right hand,” Wang Xian looked at them with his lips drawn. Seeing everyone staring at him, he smiled and continued, “All the shares of the Ling Medical Equipment Group and all assets of the Wei Family can be treated as Sister Li’s red packet for getting off the car!”

“What? Are you insane? What sheer nonsense is this?” As soon as Wang Xian finished his sentence, the middle-aged lady pointed her finger at Wang Xian and shrieked.

“What nonsense are you talking about?” Wei Qingguo stared at Wang Xian with a dreadful look.

Even Uncle Zhang and Aunt Zhang, next to him, were shocked.

“I think it is feasible. It’s not a big deal to transfer Wei Family’s assets to the bride.”

“Young Master Wang is right. You’ll have to pay some price for getting a daughter-in-law.”

“You didn’t even receive the bride when she’s been here for so long. Take it as a little punishment!”

“Yes, since Young Master Wang’s sister is married to the Wei Family, you can’t treat her poorly. Assets transfer is not a big deal.” Miao Zhiyong, Director Li and the rest persuaded Wei Qingguo in a cold tone.

To them, it was a great honor for the Wei Family since Young Master Wang’s sister was marrying their son. How dare the Wei Family forego and pay no attention to the customary practice.

No wonder Young Master Wang had to get the six of them. Wei Family was digging their own grave!

“This...”

Wei Qingguo’s expression turned awful immediately when the six of them expressed their opinions. He was staring at Wang Xian with a pair of disbelieving eyes.

Young Master Wang?

The six of them actually addressed him as Young Master Wang?

The middle-aged lady watched this scene, looking pale. What are Director Miao and the rest trying to do? Force them?

“You can’t blame me for asking too much. Sister Li held her banquet yesterday when she married to your family. But none of you turned up. Not even the groom. Heh, I even had to look for my own wedding car. In that case, I can only ask for a bigger red packet for my Sister Li.” Wang Xian beamed as he looked at the pale-looking middle-aged lady and Wei Qingguo.

The relatives and friends behind them were shocked as they stared at them. None of them uttered a word.

“Transferring all our assets... isn’t this... too much?” Wei Qingguo had a constant mixed expression as he spoke with a trembling voice.

“Nope, I don’t think so,” Miao Zhiyong answered with a face full of smiles. “I can tell that the Wei Family is bullying the bride’s family. If you don’t pay such a price, who knows if you will continue to bully the bride!”

“That’s right, Director Wei. You need to reconsider it. If you don’t agree with it, we have our own ways too,” Manager Fang said impassively to Wei Qingguo.

“How can all of you do such things?!” The middle-aged lady had an ashen look with her body trembling violently. Her voice sounded like she was crying.

“I’m getting a safety net for my Sister Li,” said Wang Xian coldly to them.

“Wei Qingguo, don’t turn things ugly. Otherwise, you won’t have a chance to make it up.” Miao Zhiyong at the side threatened him.

A look of despair flashed across Wei Qingguo’s eyes. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, “Fine, we will transfer all our assets to our daughter-in-law. Please step out of the car.”

“Great, Director Wei. You’re generous. Come to us if you have any need in the future,” Miao Zhiyong said smilingly to Wei Qingguo.

A stick and a carrot.

Six of them could easily make the Wei Family bankrupt, at the same time, they could bring Wei Family to the next level.

Upon hearing Miao Zhiyong, Wei Qingguo gave a smile. None of them knew if the smile was a happy one or an upset one.

Perhaps it was both.

Whatever had happened today was totally beyond his expectations.

A daughter-in-law from the countryside, whom they despised, actually had such an influential brother.

He could get all the people whom Ling Medical Equipment Group depended on over here.

He wanted all of the Wei Family’s assets to be transferred under the bride’s name.

Yet, Wei Qingguo did not dare to refuse. Otherwise, Ling Medical Equipment Group would not survive for more than six months.

“This... how...”

The middle-aged lady was stupefied. Are they giving away the properties and assets that the Wei Family worked hard for in the past decades just like this? VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

To the daughter-in-law whom she had always looked down upon?

Uncle Zhang and Aunt Zhang were dumbfounded as they looked at Mr. and Mrs. Wei, then back to Wang Xian again.

Sister Li, in the wedding car, was looking confused. All the Wei Family’s assets are going under my name?

“Xiao Wei, aren’t you getting the bride out of the car on your big day?” The relatives and friends of the Wei Family quickly got this situation out of a fix.

“Yes, Xiao Wei. Pick her up and get ready for the wedding,” Wei Qingguo and the middle-aged lady said hurriedly.

It was a situation that was hard for them to swallow, but nothing could be changed.

In the future, they would have to please this daughter-in-law!
