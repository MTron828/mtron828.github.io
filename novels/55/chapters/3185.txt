Chapter 3186: The three thousand one hundred and eighty-five forces attacked together

“Roar Roar!”

“Damn that fellow. He actually dared to desecrate the Dragon Tomb of my skysea Dragon Palace. I want to kill them. I want to kill them.”

At the same time, the Dragon King’s Hall was shifted to the last position at the back of the Dragon Palace. The SKYSEA Dragon King sensed the situation at the dragon tomb. His eyes instantly turned blood-red and were filled with violent killing intent.

His furious roar spread throughout the entire Dragon King Palace.

However, Wang Xian didn’t care whether he had desecrated the Dragon Tomb of the Sky Sea Dragon Palace or not.

They were both enemies. Why would he care about these?

“The guy beside the Dragon King is very powerful. He should have the strength of a level four universe knight. I want to fuse with this body as soon as possible. I want to kill them.”

He roared crazily. With a wave of his arm, the treasures in the Dragon King Palace fused into his body.

At this moment, he had to fuse with this body as soon as possible at all costs. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Otherwise, with the strength of the Dragon King and the rest of the Dragon Palace, they would be able to break through the defenses in the Dragon King’s palace.

Only when he had completely fused with this body would he have the ability to fight back.

Time passed little by little. There were not many dragon bones in the entire dragon tomb. There were only about a hundred of them.

Furthermore, the energy contained in these bones was much less than what Wang Xian had absorbed last time.

However, it was about the same.

The dragon bone that he had absorbed last time was forged by the skeleton clan into an existence with the combat strength of a level three universe knight without a dragon head.

The owner of the dragon bone must have been extremely powerful when he was still alive.

Sky Sea Dragon King’s position in the Dragon clan was not very strong, at most a universe knight level eight or nine.

In the Dragon Clan, only universe masters were considered a powerful dragon clan.

Even so, the power of more than 100 dragon bones added together was very terrifying.

“The Dragon King Palace is in front. Let’s go, break it into the palace and kill that Sky Sea Dragon King.”

In front of the Dragon Tomb was the Dragon King’s Palace, which had been transferred to the back of the Tianhai Dragon Palace.

Killing intent appeared in Wang Xian’s eyes as he immediately rushed over.

There was a calabash floating above Venerable Willow God’s head, the immortal slaying calabash.

An immortal slaying sword flew out from the immortal slaying Calabash and directly attacked the Dragon King’s palace in front.

“Damn that fellow!”

The Tianhai Dragon King in the Dragon King’s Palace opened his eyes. An ugly expression appeared on his face as the Dragon King’s Palace teleported and disappeared.

At the same time, the Dragon King’s Palace suddenly appeared in the medicinal garden.

At this moment, there were quite a number of demonic beasts in the medicinal garden looking for treasures.

Seeing the sudden arrival of the Dragon King’s palace, each and every one of their faces revealed an incomparably shocked expression.

“I let you in, and I gave you an opportunity. Now is the time for you to sacrifice yourselves. Offer your loyalty and completely submit to me!”

The Tianhai Dragon King, who was coiled up in the Dragon King Palace, growled in a low voice with a gloomy face.

An invisible energy swept out in all directions.

As the energy swept across the entire Tianhai Dragon Palace, the bodies of the more than one hundred demonic beasts that entered the palace first trembled slightly. They felt an unrivaled energy enter their minds.

These were the demonic beasts that had jumped through the Dragon Gate and gone through baptism in the past.

What they didn’t know was that when they entered the Sky Sea Dragon Palace continuously and when they obtained the opportunity, an invisible hand was controlling everything.

An invisible energy was invading their bodies.

However, at this moment, a key point was completely opened.

“Enter the Dragon King Palace and protect this king.”

A voice appeared in their minds, and the eyes of the hundred or so demonic beasts flashed with the image of a golden divine dragon.

“As my king commands!”

They answered respectfully and immediately flew into the Dragon King Palace.

Among the hundred or so demon beasts, there were more than 30 great demons.

The rest of the demon beasts were at least level eight God emperors.

After all, they had been given some opportunities in the Sky Sea Dragon Palace.

However, among the hundred or so demon beasts, the strongest one was only a level two universe knight.

They easily entered the Dragon King’s Hall and guarded the Dragon King’s respect.

In a corner of the Dragon King’s Hall, a woman with a human body and a snake tail slowly stepped into the Dragon King’s Hall. Her round eyes scanned the surroundings as she walked towards the entrance of a cave.

The Heavenly Dragon King, who was trying his best to merge his body, did not sense a figure that did not belong to him entering the Dragon King’s Hall.

“Eh?”

At the back of the Sky Sea Dragon Palace, Wang Xian frowned slightly when he saw the Dragon King’s palace disappearing instantly.

The Willow Deity’s immortal slaying sword also missed.

“In the Sky Sea Dragon Palace, he can control the Dragon King’s Palace to teleport. Although the area of the Dragon King’s Palace is not very big and my attacks can cover it completely, this dragon palace has a barrier.”

“With my attack power, I can’t damage this Dragon Palace.”

The willow deity frowned and said.

Wang Xian nodded slightly.

Although the Sky Dragon King was very weak, this dragon palace wasn’t weak.

It was at least a level eight or nine universe Knight Dragon Palace. The willow deity couldn’t destroy it at all.

Even if it was a large-scale attack, it would be blocked by some barriers.

In order to kill the Tianhai Dragon King, they had to enter the Dragon King Hall.

“Let’s give it another try. If it really doesn’t work, we’ll give up. Let’s take everything that the Tianhai Dragon Palace can take away first.”

Wang Xian said.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The willow deity nodded. The two of them moved and flew toward the Dragon King Hall.

However, just as Wang Xian and the willow deity were in the Tianhai Dragon Palace, seven to eight million experts from ancient painting sects and the Heavenly Dragon Clan flew to the sky above the Milky Way.

Around them, the foggy race and some experts from other races followed them from afar.

However, after flying for ten minutes in the Milky Way, a huge teleportation formation suddenly appeared on the right.

There were two universe knights guarding the teleportation formation.

All the experts from the two races immediately flew towards the teleportation formation.

“What’s This?”

Seeing this, the expressions of the people following them changed slightly.

“The ancient painting sect and the Heavenly Dragon Clan are fully prepared. They’ve built a teleportation array directly. This teleportation array will definitely reach the Dragon Palace directly.”

“Absolutely. The two forces are fully prepared for this battle. If they fly over, they’ll need at least a day. However, they’ll be able to get there immediately through the teleportation array. This is to prevent the Dragon Palace from escaping!”

“It looks like they’ve made a lot of preparations to destroy the Dragon Palace. This time, it’s almost foolproof.”

The experts from the Milky Way were discussing in shock.

They knew that the disaster that belonged to the Dragon Palace had arrived.

The experts from the ancient painting sect, the Heavenly Dragon Clan, slowly stepped into the teleportation array and disappeared.

Conquering the Dragon Palace!
