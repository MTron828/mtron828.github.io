3690 The words of 3689 dead people could not be trusted!

“80% chance?”

At the radiant God Mountain of the Angel clan, in a towering mountain peak, the third Prince looked at the message sent by his subordinate and frowned slightly.

The Dragon King had entered the invincible zone. This time, in order to kill the Dragon King in the Invincible Zone, the third Prince had given his subordinate a powerful Angel Army!

In the third Prince’s opinion, the strength of this army of angels was enough to fight against a Level 2 universe dominator. Now, only 80% of them could kill the Dragon King!

“What a surprise!”

He looked at the data sent by his subordinates, “With the strength of the Dragon King, it’s very easy for him to kill A Level 1 universe Dominator!”

The third prince pondered for a moment and took out a divine stone of light. The divine stone of light floated in front of him!

“Third prince, what’s the matter?”

Soon, the image of the Green River Water Phoenix appeared in front of him. She looked at the third prince and asked calmly!

“Have your people work together with my people to kill the Dragon King completely!”

The third prince stared at the Phantom of the Green River Water Phoenix and said!

“Huh?”

The Green River Water Phoenix looked surprised. “My men are about to make their move. My men are enough to kill the Dragon King!”

“Let’s join forces. Just in case, the Dragon King is stronger than we thought!”

The third Prince said to her!

Originally, they thought that since they had sent someone to kill the Dragon King, it would be a piece of cake for them to kill him!

They were all top-notch experts of the peak race, and their statuses were also extremely noble.

Now, it seemed that things were not as easy as they thought!

“Alright, let’s let them join forces.”

The Green River Water Phoenix pondered for a moment and nodded lightly!

She knew that the third prince was a proud person. To kill a small figure and still want to join forces with her, that small figure must have exceeded his imagination, and he was not 100% sure.

And killing the Dragon King was also very important to her, so she agreed!

“Okay!”

The third prince nodded!

The Green River Water Phoenix’s figure disappeared, and soon sent a message!

The third Prince sent the message to his subordinates in the invincible zone, and his eyes flickered slightly!

“Kill the Dragon King, and it won’t be a big problem to subdue the Dragon Palace!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

He murmured.

As long as his subordinates in the Invincible Zone killed the Dragon King and brought his body over, the Dragon King would be dead for sure!

Regardless of whether the Dragon King had any treasures or not, he could easily kill him!

But he had to obtain the Dragon King’s corpse or his flesh and blood!

“Eh? The third prince sent us a message. He wants us to contact someone. Fire vanishing sky, Fire Phoenix, fire vanishing sky?”

Soon, more than ten angels in the Invincible Zone rushed to the trading center.

The angel in the center received the message from the third prince, and his eyes flickered!

“Phoenix Clan? Fire Vanishing Heaven? How did the third Prince find the Phoenix Clan?”

An angel asked in puzzlement!

“The matter of the third prince is not something that we can guess. Contact Fire Vanishing Heaven immediately. I wonder how much power the third prince has found for us!”

As the angel in the center spoke, he immediately began to make contact!

Just as the experts from the Angel clan and the Fire Phoenix clan were about to make their move, Wang Xian had already rushed to the Exchange Hall!

This time, he didn’t use his clone to come over for the sale. Instead, he came over in his true form!

With his current strength, he could already act without restraint in the Invincible Zone!

Even if there were a large number of experts surrounding him, he wasn’t afraid at all!

Hence, he didn’t need to use his clone to sell his goods like last time!

When he arrived above the continent of the trading ground, Wang Xian landed on a spot!

He didn’t enter the interior of the trading ground because there was a formation there. If he entered, his strength would be suppressed!

Therefore, he chose a spot outside!

After landing, he moved his palm and five hundred fruits floated around him. He stood there and scanned his surroundings!

“Oh? That’s the Dragon King. The Dragon King Is Here!”

“The Dragon King is here. He didn’t enter the inner part of the trading ground. He’s outside. Let’s go, Let’s Go!”

“The Dragon King is finally here!”

When the experts around the trading ground noticed Wang Xian’s arrival, they moved and rushed over immediately!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Soon, dozens of experts arrived around Wang Xian.

When they saw the 500 fruits floating in front of Wang Xian, their pupils constricted slightly and their faces were filled with shock!

“This… there are so many fruits. There are actually 500 of them. This is 500 of them!”

“Hiss, the Dragon King actually has so many fruits!”

“These 500 fruits, if we were to use the Dragon King’s trading price, we would need at least two to three innate treasures before we can trade them away!”

Dozens of experts looked at the 500 fruits with burning eyes!

They wanted to rush over and snatch them away!

However, it was a pity that the person in front of them was the Dragon King!

He was the Dragon King who had killed the mad demons and was close to sweeping the invincible region!

There was a vague saying in the invincible region.

One on one, the Dragon King was invincible!

Sweeping the invincible region, the Dragon King could be considered to have done it!

His terrifying strength had killed two mad demons in succession!

His strength was extremely terrifying!

When Wang Xian arrived at the trading ground, the news spread at a crazy speed. Many experts from the invincible zone flew over quickly!

A few minutes after Wang Xian arrived, hundreds of old monsters from the Invincible Zone had gathered around him!

Hundreds of old monsters stared at the 500 fruits with burning and greedy eyes.

Whoosh

At this moment, a figure carrying a bow flew over. His gaze swept across the fruits in front of Wang Xian, and a hint of passion flashed across his eyes!

“Dragon King, is what the Mad Demon said true? As long as a mad demon or a top-notch expert consumes a large amount of them, they will be able to achieve a breakthrough?”

The figure carrying the bow could not help but ask!

“HMM?”

“He is a top-notch expert of the Elf clan!”

“He is an Oakley archer of the Elf clan. The Elf clan seems to have a good relationship with the Dragon King!”

His words caused the surrounding experts to look expectant as they stared at Wang Xian!

“The Elf clan!”

Wang Xian looked at this expert of the Elf clan and sized him up before replying, “The words of a dead person can not be trusted!”

“The words of a dead person?”

The moment Wang Xian finished his sentence, all the old monsters around him were stunned. Their faces were filled with astonishment and shock!

What did he mean?

The words of a dead person?

“However, there is one thing that the mad demon Jin Gui was right about. A mad demon who consumed a large amount of ordinary fruit would have a 99% chance of breaking through. A top-notch expert might still be lacking!”

At this moment, Wang Xian’s voice rang out once again!
