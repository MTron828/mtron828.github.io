“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The battle continued as the terrifying energy reverberated throughout the world!

Liu Lan and Wang Xian’s eyes were bloodshot from the battle!

They only had their eyes on the Asgardian demon god.

All their energy was completely locked onto him.

This also made Wang Xian feel much more relaxed by the side. All he needed to do was to attack normally!

The animosity between the Asgardian demon god, the sword, and the magic universe had exceeded Wang Xian’s imagination!

“Liu Lan, Hopeless Sky, you want me to die. Even if I die, I will make you pay a terrible price. I will also make you, the sword, and the magic universe, pay the price!”

The wounds on the Asgardian demon god’s body were increasing!

The despair in his eyes was also increasing!

There was an additional existence in the Heaven’s origin realm!

This was only his body. He had just broken through to the Heaven’s origin realm and didn’t even have any resurrection treasures in his hands!

Once he died, he would truly die.

He would be completely annihilated!

Now, because of Wang Xian, he was completely locked on to both his escapes!

He knew that Wang Xian had a terrifying locking ability.

Today, with Liu Lan and the hatred of Wang Xian, there was a high possibility that he would die here!

He could die, but he also wanted to make the sword and the Magic Universe pay the price.

“Today, I, Wang Xian, will behead you to pay tribute to the lives of those who died in the sword and the Magic Universe! ”

Wang Xian raised his battle axe and roared.

His entire body was rapidly expanding until it was 1,000 meters in size!

Boom

Wang Xian dashed out and engaged in close combat with the Asgardian Demon God!

Liu Lan waved the staff in his hand. Streams of energy covered the surroundings to prevent the Asgardian demon god from escaping!

At the same time, streams of water were injected into Wang Xian’s body to strengthen his defense and recovery ability!

Wang Xian raised his head. The fragments of the Starfield were suspended in the air above him.

The stars were spinning above him!

The stars were attacking Aggar!

The terrifying energy covered the sky and the Sun!Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Aggar was in an extremely miserable state.

He flapped his wings and tried his best to Dodge!

Now, he could no longer block any attacks!

He could not withstand the combined attacks of Wang Xian and the other two!

“Ahhhh!”

However, even if he tried to block the attacks again,.

He could not dodge the attacks of Wang Xian and the others!

He dodged the attacks of Hopeless Sky and was struck by a Star!

He let out a furious roar and let out a miserable shriek!

“Disintegration of the OMEN!”

He let out another furious roar and his eyes were filled with madness!

“Disintegration of the omen. Last Time, Agatha used this move to escape. His limbs were also left here because of this move!”

Liu Lan saw Agatha’s move and immediately reminded Wang Xian loudly!

At this moment, Wang Xian saw the body of Agatha transformed into 20 to 30 body parts!

Heads!

Limbs!

Eyes!

And two wings!

There was also a chest and some bones!

He quickly fled to the surroundings and far away!

When Wang Xian saw this scene, his eyes focused!

He waved his arm and the five elements Millstone and the Tai Chi Dragon Plate flew out, attacking the pupils one by one!

At the same time, Wang Xian’s body trembled and split into nine parts, attacking the limbs one by one!

The Starfield fragment and the book of water forbidden spell were also sweeping towards the bodies of the Agar Heavenly Demon God! Each of the 28 body parts contained a terrifying energy.

They were fleeing in all directions!

Liu Lan and Hopeless Heaven also tried to intercept them!

They also had powerful means to intercept them!

Stay here! ”

One by one, their limbs were enveloped by Wang Xian and the rest’s energy!

At this moment, the head of the Asgard Celestial Demon flew toward the group of experts from the forbidden grounds and the Sacred Academy!

“If you want to kill me, I will make your sword and Magic Universe pay a terrible price. I will make all the experts from your sword and Magic Universe die with me!”

The head of the Asgardian Demon God roared crazily.

The eyes on his head disappeared, and he looked abnormally terrifying!

But the energy contained in them was very terrifying!

“You want to kill the disciples of our sword and Magic Universe? Don’t even think about it! ”

Liu Lan’s eyes were extremely cold!

He waved the staff in his hand, and the water condensed into a giant hand that grabbed at his head!

In the next moment, the huge hand grabbed Agartian’s head, and his head let out a blood-curdling scream!

But the moment he was grabbed, he suddenly opened his mouth and spat something out!

It was an eye.

Inside the eye was a face that looked crazy!

This face broke through the bindings of the eye and turned into a terrifying face of a demon god!

The face of the demonic god grew larger and larger and continued to attack the group of disciples!

“Not good!”

Liu Lan’s expression changed slightly when she saw this!

“Not good! The Demonic God’s target is us! Run! Run! ” “Oh no! The demonic God wants to kill us! We’re not his match! Run! Run!” “Run! Run! This face is not something we can block!”

At this moment, all the peak-stage rulers of the sacred grounds, forbidden grounds, and sacred academy in the surrounding area looked at this face in shock!

They immediately attacked the face of the demon god and ordered all the disciples and experts to immediately flee!

“Die, die, die, die, Liu Lan, hopeless sky, I said, even if I die, I will make your sword and Magic Universe pay a terrible price. Hahaha, die, die, die, die! ”

Agartian Demon God roared crazily!

At this moment, he didn’t want to escape anymore!

But before he died, he wanted to kill these million experts from the sword and Magic Universe.

Once these experts died, when the calamity arrived, the sword and magic universe might still suffer a terrible disaster!

“Agartian, you are courting death! ”

At the front, when Hopeless Heaven saw this scene, his expression changed drastically as he roared crazily!

“Brother Wang Xian, run! ”

The Dragon’s Roar and Yin Longyin Hao’s face turned extremely pale when they saw the attack of the Agatian Demon God!

Only when they faced the demon God who was in the Heaven’s origin realm did they realize how terrifying this level was!

Even just a face made them feel fear and despair! They shouted at Wang Xian’s void Dragon Body in Panic!

“Hehe, don’t worry! ”

Wang Xian looked at them and smiled faintly.

“Transformation of the Netherworld Dragon! ”

With a thought, Wang Xian’s real body instantly merged with the Void Dragon Body!

“The three of us are attacking you together. If we can still cause you any trouble, then we are too trash! ”

Wang Xian raised his head and looked at the face of the demon god.. He shook his head and sneered!
