Chapter 801: 0802 assassinating the immortal God

Translator: 549690339

The Sun was high in the sky, and the small town of the treacherous Spike clan was deserted. All the houses were tightly shut.

There weren’t many pedestrians on the streets. As the treacherous Spike clan, they usually rested during the day and came out to take action at night.

The treacherous Spike clan cultivated the dark attribute, and their combat strength in the dark far surpassed that of the day.

Their assassinations would often be carried out in the dark.

The Strange Thorn clan in the dark was incomparably terrifying.

The Strange Demons hid in the void, staring coldly at a black mountain peak in front of them.

Black demonic qi surrounded the mountain peak, making it seem eerie and terrifying.

That was the place where the strange demon clan’s immortal gods cultivated.

Naturally, they would not assassinate the immortal gods. Instead, they would prevent the Strange Thorn clan’s immortal gods from discovering them.

Ao Yao stood there quietly. Seventy Strange Demons had already entered the strange Thorn tribe and started to assassinate them.

The strange demons who had special skin and cultivated the divine light dragon transformation were the kings of assassinations. Even the immortal gods would find it very difficult to sense the strange demons of the infant realm.

Only when the strange demons of the same level appeared would they be able to see clearly and discover them.

The Strange Thorn clan would never have thought that an assassin would openly enter their lair and assassinate them during the day.

As the strongest assassin clan in the pugilistic world, he would never have thought that.

“Ah, there’s a demon!”

Time slowly passed. After an hour, a terrified scream came from the center of the town.

The Scream instantly spread to a radius of more than ten kilometers.

“Ah!”

Soon, another scream came. Ao Yao frowned slightly and shouted, “Go!”

Ripples appeared in the air, and the whole town was woken up. From the back of the town, black-robed assassins of the Strange Thorn clan walked out.

“We are the strange demon clan of the Dragon Palace, the Strange Thorn clan. Please give us your guidance in the future!”

At this moment, a cold voice came from the air, echoing throughout the entire Xia Ding region.

The Strange Demon’s voice echoed with the screams just now, startling the entire Strange Thorn clan and the Mad Beast clan.

“The screams and the immortal God’s voice!”

Everyone was slightly startled. One immortal God after another flew out of the gate of immortality, especially the Strange Thorn Tribe’s immortal gods.

Three immortal gods dressed in black robes appeared in the sky above the small town, looking towards the direction of the sound.

Below, the members of the Strange Thorn tribe came to the road of the small town. They looked towards the immortal gods in the sky and bowed respectfully.

“The smell of blood is very strong!”

A Strange Thorn Immortal God’s voice was somewhat hoarse. He looked down, and his face, which was covered by black robe, was somewhat embarrassed.

“Black robe, what’s Wrong?”

A golden bird, half a meter in size, was emitting a resplendent golden light. Beside it were two burly old men.

The one who spoke was the golden bird.

Because the Strange Thorn clan and the Wild Beast clan were in the same Xia ding, their relationship could be considered quite good.

The golden bird was somewhat similar to the golden bird from the school of Imperial Beasts. They looked over in confusion.

“Someone broke into our Thorn clan!”

An old man in the middle revealed a pair of slightly red eyes. His gaze was fixed on the road below.

There were only over a hundred members of the Thorn clan gathered there. This gave them a bad premonition.

“Disciples of the Thorn clan, come over here!”

A thorn immortal god shouted softly. The dignity and voice of the immortal God directly covered the entire town.

However, what made them feel embarrassed was that there was no movement. Other than the group of Thorn Disciples on the road, there was no movement at all.

“This...”

The Three Immortal Gods of the Wild Beast Immortal sect looked at this scene in astonishment.

The Strange Thorn clan was completely nurturing their disciples as assassins. The loyalty of each disciple could reach 100% .

It was impossible for them not to come out under the orders of the immortal god experts.

However, other than the 100 odd members of the Strange Thorn clan, the entire town was filled with a deathly stillness and a bloody stench.

One of the Strange Thorn clan’s immortal gods waved his arm, and the buildings below were overturned one by one, revealing the scenes inside.

“Hiss!”

The pupils of the six immortal sects could not help but shrink, and their faces revealed an embarrassed and solemn expression.

In the houses, on the beds, and on the sofas, there were numerous assassins from the Thorn clan.

The number of members of the Thorn clan was very small to begin with, only one to two thousand in total. But now, there were only a hundred or so people standing on the road.

The atmosphere fell silent, and the three immortal gods from the Thorn clan trembled slightly.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

An Immortal God from the Wild Beast Immortal sect said with a solemn face.

“The immortal God in the void just now said that they are members of the Dragon Palace’s spiky demon clan. A few days ago, you assassinated members of the Dragon Gate and destroyed the Dragon Gate forging workshop...”

An immortal God next to them glanced at the three spiky immortal gods, and his eyes flickered with a solemn face.

“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace of the Dragon Gate, cough, cough!”

The black figure in the middle looked into the distance and slowly closed his eyes.

“We admit defeat!”

A slightly bitter voice sounded, and the immortal gods of the Strange Thorn clan felt a little powerless.

Yesterday, fifty nascent realm experts of the Holy Medicine Immortal sect were killed, and the two immortal sects didn’t dare to leave the city gate now.

Now, when the Dragon Gate was dealing with the two immortal sects, they were actually able to spare some people to deal with the Strange Thorn clan.

For an immortal sect that was good at assassination, 90% of the disciples of the immortal sect were assassinated. More than 20 infant realm members were directly killed, and two half-step immortal gods were also assassinated. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

What could they use to fight back? It was even uncertain whether the Dragon Gate would stop at this point!

With such a terrifying assassination method, in addition to the immortal gods of the Dragon Gate and the Dragon Palace, the assassination clan was completely defeated!

“The power of the Dragon King is really too terrifying. While suppressing the two immortal gates, he was also able to take out his hand to assassinate the experts of the clan. With their strength, I’m afraid that even the Xuan Yuan clan and the Yuwen clan might not be his match!”

The Immortal God of the Mad Beast clan looked at each other and said in a low voice.

“Let’s go. I believe that in the future, no immortal gate will dare to provoke the Dragon Gate!”

The Immortal God of the Mad Beast Clan left, and the strange demon in the Void also left.

He moved and led the strange demon toward the Holy Doctor Holy Medicine Immortal sect.

On the same night, what happened to the Strange Thorn clan was reported on the jianghu web, and the entire jianghu was shocked again.

“As expected, the Dragon Palace is also the Dragon King’s force. When the Dragon King led a group of experts to suppress them, the strange demon clan of the Dragon Palace almost exterminated the Strange Thorn Clan!”

“The Strange Thorn clan has kicked a metal board this time. The Dragon King’s influence is too strong!”

“It’s really hard to imagine. The Strange Thorn clan is an assassin clan. Now, 90% of their disciples have been assassinated by the strange demon clan of the Dragon Palace!”

All the disciples of the immortal sect were discussing in shock. The two immortal sect disciples who received the news were even more terrified.

While the disciples of the immortal sect were discussing, Wang Xian was planning something.

Assassinating the immortal God!
