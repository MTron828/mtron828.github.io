For the sake of resources, Huaxia’s Jianghu forces wanted to unify the sub-continent. At present, India’s side was directly destroyed under the attacks of the Xuan Yuan clan and the Yuwen clan.

Some other forces, such as the Netherworld Fire God sect, were directly destroyed or subdued by the other immortal sects.

As soon as the immortal sects appeared, the weak Huaxia was like a sleeping dragon, easily destroying the powerful sub-continent forces.

Currently, in the entire sub-continent, only the forces of the island nation had not been subdued. This time, the Wild Beast Immortal sect, together with the Great Hong Immortal Sect, the Yongchang Immortal sect, and the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect, went to conquer the island nation’s most powerful force, the nine Snakes Association.

The Nine Snakes Association was the most powerful force in the island nation. It had a total of five immortal gods, a force that could not be underestimated.

However, the nine snakes association was nothing in the face of the four powerful immortal sects. The four immortal sects could easily wipe them out.

Tonight, the Nine Snakes Association would give a reply to the four immortal sects.

Wang Xian pondered for a while and looked at Xiao Yu. “Xiao Yu, are you going over tonight?”

“Yes, I’m going over to have some fun. What’s the matter, brother?”

Xiao Yu asked Wang Xian curiously.

“It’s nothing. I’ll go over with You Tonight!”

Wang Xian shook his head. If the nine snakes association was really going to submit to the four great immortal sects, why would they meet the gods in the Garden of Eden today?

“Yes, Alright, Brother. Oh right, two immortal gods from the puppet immortal sect were killed by the gods from the Ancient Greek divine realm. The ancient Greek divine realm said that the puppet immortal sect was too greedy and violated the Treaty!”

Xiao Yu nodded. She suddenly recalled the news she received today and told Wang Xian.

“The gods from the ancient Greek divine realm have killed the immortals from the puppet immortal sect!”

Wang Xian’s gaze turned cold as a hint of killing intent flashed in his eyes.

He knew a little about the two immortals from the puppet immortal sect. They were definitely not the kind of people who would dare to ask for too much. They definitely did not have the guts to violate the treaty with a divine realm.

A while ago, Wang Xian had a lot of contact with the two immortal gods of the puppet immortal sect. The two of them were considered good people and they were considered good friends.

The forging workshop of the Dragon Gate and many other things were built with the help of their disciples.

Speaking of which, among the immortal sects, other than the natural born immortal sect, their relationship was the best.

Moreover, after he destroyed the Holy Doctor and Holy Medicine Immortal Sect, the two immortal gods from the puppet immortal sect came over to seek refuge with him. In the future, they would only follow the orders of the Dragon Palace.

Back then, Wang Xian didn’t take a fancy to the strength of the puppet immortal sect and rejected them. When he wanted to forge something, the two immortal gods immediately followed him with great respect.

He could be considered as a lackey of the Dragon Palace.

He didn’t expect that he would lose his life because of a collaboration!

“Divine Realm!”

A cold glint flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes.

Those who are not of the same race would have different thoughts. Wang Xian did not agree with this statement. However, sometimes, this statement was not wrong.

“You guys can play here. I will come and look for you at night.”

Wang Xian’s mind was filled with thoughts. He nodded his head and looked at Feng Lingtian. After sensing his strength, he said to him, “Cultivate well. Your current strength is still too weak!”

“Yes, it’s the Dragon King!”

Feng Lingtian’s face turned slightly red as he nodded his head hurriedly.

Xiao Yu smiled at the side and didn’t say anything.

Wang Xian’s figure moved and returned to his room on the floating island. He hesitated for a moment and said, “Ao Jian, send someone to inform the strange demon clan and get them to investigate all the information in the Divine Realm!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao jian nodded his head and immediately ordered his subordinates to report to the Dragon Palace.

“Ancient Greek divine realm!”

Wang Xian mumbled as his eyes sparkled with an inexplicable luster.

“Dragon King, the Garden of Eden has sent an invitation!”

In the evening, the demonic azure dragon walked into the room and reported to Wang Xian.

“Oh? An Invitation? Let Me See!”

Wang Xian took the invitation with slight curiosity.

“Cherry Blossom Peak!”

Wang Xian stared at the invitation with a face full of curiosity. With a move of his body, he flew to the location outside.

At the leisure area, Xiao Yu and a group of core disciples of the immortal sect were resting on the island.

“Xiao Yu, are you guys going to Cherry Blossom Peak Tonight?”

Wang Xian saw Xiao Yu and Feng Lingtian chatting. He came to her side with a smile and asked her.

“Huh? Brother, how did you know?”

“It’s fine. You Guys Go First!”

Wang Xian saw Xiao Yu’s curious look and said with a smile.

Xiao Yu did not ask any further and continued to play.

At night, Wang Xian flew towards the location of Cherry Blossom Peak.

Cherry Blossom Peak was located next to the Snow Mountain of the island nation. It was the same mountain that Wang Xian went to in the afternoon, but it was not the same room.

“Please, Dragon King!”

When they arrived at the location of Cherry Blossom Peak, an old man looked at Wang Xian and said respectfully.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded and followed closely behind as they walked into a cave that was surrounded by cherry blossoms.

When they entered the cave, they saw a huge banquet hall. However, there was no banquet held in the entire hall at this moment.

The people from the four great immortal sects were sitting in the banquet hall. The gods from the Garden of Eden were also sitting in the hall.

One was on the left while the other was on the right. There were five old men from the nine snakes association sitting in the middle.

When Wang Xian arrived, he instantly felt that the atmosphere was extremely solemn.

“Haha Dragon King, Please take a seat here!”

When the angel of Okra saw Wang Xian, she smiled at him and said.

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the surroundings and walked toward the seat beside the angel of Okra without any expression on his face.

In the hall, the immortals from the four major immortal sects were stunned when they saw Wang Xian.

Xiao Yu was not too surprised when he saw Wang Xian. He was just very surprised.

“Haha, everyone from Huaxia Immortal Sect, don’t make things difficult for others!”

At this moment, the skinny elder who was sitting in the middle of the hall laughed out loud when he saw Wang Xian.

The Ten Immortals from the Wild Beast Immortal Sect, Yellow Heaven Immortal sect, Great Flood Immortal sect, and Yongchang Immortal sect, who were sitting across from Wang Xian, had ugly expressions when they saw Wang Xian’s sudden arrival.

They glanced at Xiao Yu. An elder from the Wild Beast Immortal sect asked in a deep voice, “Dragon King, what are you going to do?”

“It has nothing to do with me. I was just invited here.”

Wang Xian smiled faintly at the okra angel and took a sip of the tea on the table. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“HMM?”

The okra angel and the surrounding gods raised their eyebrows slightly. “Dragon King, the Friends of the Nine Snakes Association are our allies in the Garden of Eden. Now, your Huaxia Immortal sect wants to destroy them. Dragon King, you have some status in Huaxia. Please say something.”

“It’s not good for me to get involved in the matters of our Huaxia Immortal Sect!”

When Wang Xian heard the angel of Okra’s words, he finally understood.

The Garden of Eden wanted to use him to solve the nine snakes association’s matter.

He didn’t know what agreement the nine Snakes Association had reached with them.

When he thought about the matter of the puppet immortal sect, his voice was a little cold.

“Dragon King, no matter what, we can be considered partners in the future. This shouldn’t be a big problem for you, right?”

Hearing Wang Xian’s rejection, the angel of okra frowned and said with a twinkle in her eyes.

“Cooperation is cooperation. It shouldn’t have anything to do with other things, right?”

Wang Xian said to them indifferently.

His words caused the faces of the gods in the Garden of Eden to change slightly. Their eyes turned cold. “Dragon King, are you clearly not sincere about cooperating?”

“Don’t confuse cooperation with other things!”

Wang Xian shook his head lightly.

“In that case, it seems that there is no need for cooperation between us!”

The angel of Okra looked at him coldly and said.

Wang Xian smiled faintly and didn’t say anything.

Wang Xian didn’t have high hopes for cooperation from the start. It would be best if it could succeed. If it failed, there wouldn’t be any losses.
