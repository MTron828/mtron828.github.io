Chapter 1437: 1437 must explain to us

“The nameless sword demon is a powerhouse at level six of the Seethrough Realm!”

Level six of the Seethrough realm! Level six of the Seethrough realm!

When everyone saw Wang Xian casually deflecting an emperor’s attack to the side, their eyes widened.

“No wonder the dragon and Phoenix Empire dared to disobey the order of the bloodshed empire. It turns out that Wang Xian has the strength of level six of the Seethrough Realm!”

“No wonder, no wonder Wang Xian dared to look down on the emperor. It turns out that he has reached this realm as well!”

“Have the Sky Sword sect, the dragon-phoenix Empire, the bloodshed sect, and the Light Dragon Empire come to an agreement? Are they going to join forces?”

“Wang Xian and sect leader Ling are two sixth-level insightful void martial artists. The bloodshed empire may not care about one sixth-level insightful void martial artist, but if there are two...”

The surrounding forces stared at Wang Xian in shock.

A master at level six of the Seethrough realm who was not even thirty years old. What kind of concept was this?

This was simply defying the natural order.

“Are you courting death?”

When the emperor saw that his attack landed on his own people and that three masters of the Seethrough realm were killed, he revealed a furious expression.

“Haha, Old Man, do you have the ability to kill me?”

Wang Xian looked at the old man and laughed out loud. He stared at the emperor mockingly.

When the emperor heard Wang Xian calling him an old man and holding the scepter in his hand tightly, his expression changed drastically.

“Two experts at the sixth level of the insightful emptiness realm. No wonder, no wonder you dare to challenge us, the bloody flow empire. However, do you really think that we are afraid of You? Do you really think that we, the bloody flow empire, can’t do anything to You?”

The other emperor extended his hand to stop him. He glanced at the sect master of the Wang Xian Heavenly Sword sect with a cold expression. His eyes were filled with killing intent.

They did not expect that a force that they thought was like an official would slap their faces in such a manner.

What shocked them even more was that their strength had completely exceeded their expectations.

“Everyone from the Bloodflow Empire, we are not here to challenge you. It is you who are too arrogant and treat us as Chess Pieces!”

“When it comes to dealing with the demonic beast clan, why should we explain our actions to you? You Don’t take us seriously at all!”

The sect master of the Heavenly Sword sect stared at the two emperors and said faintly.

“You still have to explain to us about the demonic beast clan. We also have to give a detailed explanation!”

Wang Xian looked at the two emperors and said faintly.

Why would they need to explain to you about the actions of the blood flow empire?

Sorry, they really had to explain!

Sect leader Ling’s words and Wang Xian’s words made the two elders’faces extremely awkward.

On the surface, there were only three experts at level six of the void interpretation realm in the blood flow empire. However, in reality, there were four of them.

However, the current blood emperor and the manager of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop had yet to return from their journey to the vast region.

Furthermore, one of the emperors was still at the tomb of the demi-human.

They really couldn’t deal with Wang Xian and sect leader Ling.

In fact, if both parties were to fight, the one who would suffer the greatest loss would be the blood flow empire. Perhaps the entire imperial city would be reduced to ruins during their battle.

This caused their expressions to change continuously.

As the former blood emperor of the blood flow empire, when had they ever been so restrained?

“Now is the time for the transformation of the entire Liuhai region. As the strongest existence in the blood flow empire, we are naturally the main ones!”

Prince blood flow’s expression changed drastically as he stared at Wang Xian and sect leader Ling. He said with a gloomy face.

“Shut up. You Don’t have the right to speak here!”

Wang Xian glanced at prince blood flow and said coldly.

He stared at the two emperors and said, “Make the plan together. Don’t even think about not contributing a little!”

“You... you...”

Prince Xue Liu’s body trembled when he heard Wang Xian’s reprimand. He stared at Wang Xian with bloodshot eyes.

“We will discuss the matter of the demonic beasts another day!”

One of the emperors stared deeply at Wang Xian and sect leader Ling as he said coldly.

“All of you, take care of yourselves. HMPH!”

The other emperor swept his gaze across the four forces of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire. With a snort, he turned around and left.

Prince Bloodflow’s expression changed as he stood there.

“We’ll discuss it another day. Listen to our Bloodflow Empire’s announcement!”

He waved his arm and walked out directly.

Leaving behind all the factions in the Great Hall whose faces were filled with astonishment.

They looked at the dragon-phoenix Empire, the Sky Sword sect, the Light Dragon Empire, and the Bloodflow sect standing in the Great Hall in a daze.

“I really didn’t expect that they actually had the power to resist the Bloodflow Empire!”

“Two level 6 profound void martial artists, plus their profound void martial artists, they really aren’t afraid of the blood flow empire at all. This is simply...”

“The Demon Beast Clan hasn’t changed yet, but a huge earthquake has happened on our side!”

Some factions discussed with astonished expressions.

The subordinate dynasties and sects of the blood flow empire looked at them with ugly expressions.

For thousands of years, this was the first time they had forced the bloodshed empire into such an awkward situation.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the surroundings and looked at the three forces of the Heavenly Sword sect.

“Let’s Go!”

Sect leader Ling and the rest nodded their heads and led their subordinates out.

Wang Xian and Feng Luan also walked out.

“Hiss, these four forces have really formed an alliance!”

“It seems like they are prepared for the huge changes in the Liuhai region. They have already formed an alliance!”

“It’s obvious that they are dissatisfied with the attitude of the bloodshed empire today...”

Voices of discussion rang out in the hall.

Only after Wang Xian and the rest left did they dare to follow them out.

“If it wasn’t for the fact that the bloodshed empire has gone overboard, I don’t want to shed all pretense of cordiality with them. They really don’t put us in their eyes!”

Walking out of the Great Hall, the Sky Sword Sect’s sect master shook his head slightly and said indifferently.

Thinking that he was at least an expert at the sixth level of the profound void tier, yet the blood flow Empire still didn’t put the sky sword sect in their eyes, one could imagine how arrogant they were.

“They have been invincible in the flowing sea region for too long, making them think too highly of themselves!”

The Light Dragon King said indifferently.

They didn’t agree with the blood flow empire’s plan at all.

It was obvious that they wanted to weaken their power.

“I wonder what the blood flow empire will do next?”

Feng Luan said thoughtfully.

“Hehe, they have been standing on the clouds for a long time. Now they should know what to do. This world is not theirs. In the end, they will compromise!”

Sect Master Ling said with a smile on his face.

Sect Master Yi and the Light Dragon King nodded slightly.

It was impossible for the blood stream empire to attack them, especially when the Demon Beast Clan wanted to establish an empire.

The appearance of the Demon Beast Empire was actually the most stressful thing for the blood stream empire.

During this period, the blood stream empire could only rope them in. Once they fought, the losses of the blood stream empire would be even more severe!FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
