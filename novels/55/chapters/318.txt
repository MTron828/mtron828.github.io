Chapter 319: The Wood Dragon Ball

Wang Xian was pleasantly surprised by the two Spiritual Treasures, namely the Ancient Sword of Zhan Lu, and the Zither of Hao Zhong.

Wang Xian had no use for the zither. On the other hand, he was very fond of the sword.

He was not versed in swordplay. Nonetheless, the childhood dream of venturing the world and helping the underprivileged as a chivalrous swordsmen remained rooted at the back of his mind.

Knights looked suave as they wielded their long swords, their main choice of weapon.

Swish, attack at lightning speed!

Swosh, take the counter-strike!

Wang Xian grinned as he roleplayed with the sword, before his sight landed on the remaining Jade box.

“A container carved out of Emerald. Just the container alone is worth hundreds of millions!” Wang Xian exclaimed as he picked it up for assessment. It was not particularly heavy, glowing in emerald-green translucence. It looked incredibly invaluable.

“What’s this?” Wang Xian quizzed. As he opened the container, he was stunned at the sight of a jade-green orb. A message flashed across his mind.

[Golden-rain Tree Wood Spiritual Bead: Level 10]

“Spiritual Bead of the Golden-rain Wood. A Level 10 Wood Spiritual Bead!” Wang Xian exclaimed with an astounded look.

Wang Xian had come across many Spiritual Beads. For instance, the two Spiritual Flame Balls of the Sui Family, the two Spiritual Beads which he received from Flame Palace and Fire God Denomination, as well as the ones which he had obtained right from the beginning.

But this was the first time in which he came across a Spiritual Bead of another element.

“I can totally refine this Level 10 Spiritual Bead and transform it into a Dragon Ball. A Wood-element Dragon Ball!” Wang Xian uttered to himself. Picking it up gently, Wang made a light swirl of the Spiritual Bead on his palm. Drops of his essence blood seeped into the bead as it brimmed with life.

Soon after, he opened his mouth and absorbed the Spiritual Bead into his body.

Given the nourishment from his Dragon Energy, the Wood-element Spiritual Bead would transform into a Wood Dragon Ball. Which would also possess incredible powers.

Furthermore, a Wood Dragon Ball is able to improve land arability. By placing it on a Spiritual Medicine Garden, it would greatly boost the growth of Spiritual Medicine within the area.

“A huge profit we’ve made this time!” Wang Xian cheered as he admired the Ancient sword of Zhan Lu, Wood-element Spiritual Beads, along with other Spiritual Medicine and treasures of the like.

This included the invaluable floating island. To him, these were priceless treasures.

Thereafter, he flipped through the treasure trove once more, but could no longer find anything more valuable than the things which he had on hand.

Wang Xian exited the treasure trove, and continued searching in the neighboring rooms.

As they came to a room within one of the Central Grand Halls, Wang Xian and gang discovered the name of the Sect which had settled on this Spiritual Island.

The island was named Wood Mirage, eponymous to the Sect which had settled on it.

Stone tablets lined the rooms of the Grand Halls. Based on records carved on one of them, it stated that there were more than two thousand disciples on this Wood Mirage Island.

Amongst them was a Laozu, who had attained abilities of the Dan Realm.

“An ancient First-class Sect would be on par with a current Sacred Sect,” Wang Xian said, trailing off. He sighed as he looked at information on the stone tablet. While making his way out, he was surprised by the giant footprint ahead which measured close to four meters.

A footprint up to four meters in length. The monster with this footprint must tower over twenty meters in height. It’s enough to topple houses hovering at sixteen meters, Wang Xian thought to himself as he assessed the extent of the damage around him.

It was no surprise for a monster of over twenty meters in length to exist within the oceans.

After all, the blue whale measured more than thirty meters, while a sperm whale could reach over twenty meters.

And these were known mammoths on Earth, so it only meant that there were still many out there which were yet to be discovered.

While a blue whale may be gigantic, its combat abilities were much weaker, which made it an ordinary species.

Dawn had arrived by the time Wang Xian completed his tour around the island. As he arrived at the sea, deep in thought, he was immediately received by Roving Yaksha.

“Dragon King!” Roving Yaksha greeted.

“How do we go about moving this island? What’s the fastest speed at which it could move?” Wang Xian asked Roving Yaksha in response.

Now that he owned the island, Wang Xian was preparing to put the island through a series of refurbishments.

Turning the entire island into his ideal wonderland, for some future fun, seemed like a good choice.

In this way, there was no future need for cruise ships, for he could simply ride on the island.

That sounded really cool just by the mere thought of it.

“Dragon King, moving the island requires aid from an external force. This can either be a powerful source of wind or tidal energy, or physical strength,” Roving Yaksha explained.

He continued, “The island isn’t too heavy, given that it’s currently floating on the sea. Even we Yakshas are able to move it.”

“That said, our moving speed will be very slow, as we can only shift it between the time of sunrise to sunset. Hence the distance moved will not be significant!” he ended.

Nodding in acknowledgment, Wang Xian gave a faint smile. So long as the island can be shifted quickly, he thought.

There were only a hundred Yakshas. But, with the addition of the Devil Monkeys, Prime Minister Turtle and gang, it would definitely speed up the rate at which the island was shifted.

“Prime Minister Turtle!” Wang Xian called out, to which the former immediately moved over.

Bowing his head, Prime Minister Turtle swam over to meet Wang Xian. “Subject here, at your command!” Prime Minister Turtled greeted.

“Bring Roving Heavens and the rest along. We’ll shift this island over to the one where the past Dragon Sect base stood!” Wang Xian ordered Prime Minister Turtle.

It would be good camouflage to have the island shifted over, which would make it easier for Wang Xian to order its refurbishment thereafter.

“Yes, Dragon King!” Prime Minister Turtle nodded. Following which, he gathered all the Dragon Palace members to set off immediately, as they prepared to shift the floating island over to the Bohai Sea.

Wang Xian assessed the speed at which the island was shifting. He was very pleased even though it was moving at less than half the speed of a speedboat. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

As the Dragon Palace welcomed more members, or with rising abilities of their manpower, moving the floating island would also become much faster.

To the extent where one day, perhaps Prime Minister and Roving Girl alone would possess enough strength or prowess to move the island at hasty speed.

With that, Wang Xian returned onto the island and headed for the Spiritual Medicine Garden. He wanted to test his abilities in the art of refining elixir pills.

He had just arrived in the garden when he bumped into Mo Yuan and Mo Qinglong.

“Young Master!” the duo called out.

“What is it?” Wang Xian asked.

“Young Master, the Dragonians have come with an urgent report. It’s regarding the murderers of Mo Ersan and Mo Sanyi. We’ve got information,” Mo Yuan updated.

“Have they been found?” Wang Xian questioned as he lifted an eyebrow.

“We’ve been informed that the selection day for the new Saint and Saintess of the Heavenly Sound Sect has been brought forward. The ceremony will be held tomorrow and the day after, outside their sect ground entrance in the mountains. During which, the murderers will appear!” Mo Yuan answered.

“But many of their sect experts will be present then. The possibility of the Abyss to carry out a successful assassination is nil,” Wang Xian said doubtfully.

“According to the rules of the Sect, once the candidates for the Saint and Saintess have been confirmed, they’ll be protected by Inborn experts. It’s only when the Abyss has surpassed the Inborn status that they will be able to succeed,” Mo Qinglong elaborated.

“Dragon King, should Master and I strike together right away, or should we continue waiting?” Mo Yuan asked.

“Since they’ve been found, we’ll make our move!” Wang Xian replied as his eyes narrowed. “The venue for the selection of the Saint and Saintess by the Heavenly Sound Sect, you say? The one who’s able to order the mission is presumably a strong competitor for the Saintess,” he continued.

“Let’s exact our revenge today!” Mo Yuan and Mo Qinglong chimed in together.
