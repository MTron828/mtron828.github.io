“Xing Hua Planet has given an explanation, claiming that they didn’t send anyone to cause trouble on the Dragon Planet. If the dragon planet says they sent someone to cause trouble, please provide evidence!”

“Xing Hua Planet is giving in, directly giving an explanation!”

“Xing Hua planet’s 3 powers don’t have an undying level 7 warrior to protect them, they aren’t a match for Tiger Chaos Demon Country!”

When the Dragon Star Goddess Yin Xuan’s concert was in full swing, when the Dragon Palace and tiger chaotic demon country made a statement!

Xing Hua Planet quickly gave an explanation!

When everyone saw this explanation, they all discussed!

The current situation was very clear to everyone!

Xing hua planet’s 3 powers without an undying level 7 warrior guarding them were weaker than the dragon palace and Tiger Chaotic Demon Country!

They had to respond to the questions from the Tiger Chaotic Demon Country and Dragon Palace!

“I wonder if the ninth grade sky sect will respond!”

“The ninth grade sky sect shouldn’t care about the Dragon Palace and the tiger chaotic demon country. After all, what would they dare to do even if they don’t respond to the Dragon Palace and the Tiger Chaotic Demon Country?”

Xing Hua Planet responded, and some people began to guess the situation at the ninth grade sky sect!

After all, the remarks made by the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation and the Dragon Palace this time were very firm!

“Dragon King, Xing Hua Planet has responded. They said they want us to produce evidence!”

At the location of the Dragon Star Battle Pets’sales counter, the Heaven Fey Imperial preceptor walked over and said!

“What evidence do you want? Just say that the members of the Black Cloud Planet’s skeleton society have admitted it. After we open today, send people to destroy Xing Hua Planet Tomorrow!”

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly as he said coldly!

“Destroy planet Xing Hua?”

The Heaven Fey Imperial preceptor’s pupils constricted slightly. Following that, he nodded his head heavily!

Once planet Xing Hua was destroyed, there would only be one commercial planet in this region, the Dragon Planet!

Furthermore, the powerhouses of the Black Cloud Skull Party were definitely hired by planet Xing Hua. Therefore, they had to pay a heavy price!

“Dragon King, the concert has ended. Now, all the members are walking towards US under the guidance of the star Goddess and goddess Yin Xuan!”

At this moment, Prime Minister GUI came over to report!

“Alright, prepare to welcome the guests!”

Wang Xian smiled and nodded!

“Everyone, come and see what a paradise for battle pets is!”

“Today, the dragon star has just opened. The Dragon Palace has taken out 250,000 eternal God Main Battle Pets and 75 immortal god King Battle Pets!”

“If you want a partner to fight side by side, if you want a powerful and cool mount, the Dragon Palace will definitely have a choice that you’ll be satisfied with!”

Emperor Star Lady’s voice resounded, followed by over 100 million people rushing over!

“As the space is limited, only about 100 million people can enter, eternal God level 5 and above can enter directly, with a certain amount of God stones, those who aren’t qualified can watch from the screen outside!”

At this time, another voice resounded!

Over 100 undying Emperor Battle Pets, over 100,000 eternal God Lord Battle Pets, this was a huge attraction to all the powers!

It could be said that today, the number of people who came to Dragon Star for battle pets was much more than the star Goddess and the rest!

Many powerful powers headed in!

In the past, there might not even be one undying level 5 battle pet in 10,000 years, and now there were two for sale on Dragon Star!

This made many organizations excited!

Some of the strongest warriors were only undying level 5, if one could buy an undying level 5 battle pet, that would double their strength!

“Wow, so many battle pets, simply too many!”

“Look at the center, my God, Look, there are all undying warpets!”

When everyone entered the market, looking at the undying warpets around, the hundreds of thousands of eternal god Lord warpets around, their faces were filled with shock!

“Just the strength of these warpets combined, it’s enough to destroy a pinnacle 3rd class warrior!”

Some factions swept their gaze over and their eyes were filled with fervor!

“Let’s go and buy that Level 5 immortal King War Pet!”

“I want to buy a Level 1 immortal King War Pet!”

“I wonder if there are any war pet cubs that we can buy for our core disciples!”

Some of the powerhouses from the factions swept their gaze over their surroundings fervently and walked straight towards the group of immortal King Desolate Beasts!

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the powerhouses who were walking towards the immortal king desolate beast and revealed a smile on his face!

The number of immortal kings who came to Dragon Star this time could reach up to 2,000. Most of them were here for the battle pets!

“Dragon King, someone wants to purchase that Immortal King Level 5 Battle Pet!”

Not long after, Prime Minister Gui walked over and reported to Wang Xian!

“Good, good!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled!

“Prime Minister Gui, send someone to purchase elixirs immediately. Use All the god Stones sold by the war pet to purchase elixirs and God herbs!”

...

Wang Xian instructed immediately!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded his head!

“I Want This Immortal God King War Pet!”

“Haha, this one is the best as a mount. I want this one. Give me the god Stones!”

“The Eternal Divine Lord’s War Pet. We, the East-hill sect, will take all 5,000 of this race!”

One War Pet after another was quickly purchased. Those who did not have enough divine stones could only watch with excitement!

On the AI, the matter regarding the Dragon Star had also attracted the attention of countless people. When someone posted a picture of each war pet, it caused countless people to be shocked!

They had taken out more than 100 war pets at once. Now that they saw it with their own eyes, they were shocked!

Many people looked at the war pets, and their hearts were itching!

“I want to go to the Dragon Star. No one can stop me!”

...

“Wow, this is so powerful. I want one to be my mount!”

The videos of the war pets were released one after another, and many people commented below!

It was the first time for many people to see so many war pets. The Dragon Palace was too powerful!

At the teleportation array, countless people were still swarming toward long xing!

“DAMN! Look! The ninth-grade sky sect has responded to the Dragon Palace!”

“It has responded. The ninth-grade sky sect has responded: anyone who makes us pay the price has become history!”

“Ninth-grade Sky sect’s words must be domineering. Anyone who makes me pay the price has become history. Is this a warning to the dragon palace and the Tiger Chaotic Demon Country?”

“As far as I know, the ninth-grade Sky sect had three immortal king level seven experts long, long ago. They have the right to say such words!”

“As expected of one of the overlords with a deep heritage. They are so confident that they don’t put the Dragon Palace and tiger chaotic demon country in their eyes at all!”

The declaration of the Ninth-grade Heaven’s sect made all the forces see the confidence of the old forces, and they were all in awe of it!
