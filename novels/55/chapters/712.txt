Chapter 713: 0714 was worse than a dog (third watch!)

Translator: 549690339

“Boom!”

A rumbling sound was heard at the entrance of the school.

At this moment, more than a thousand people had gathered around the school. Wang Xian’s RV was smashed in the middle, causing everyone to gasp.

They looked at the beast-like puppet chariot in shock.

“Obviously, student Feng is too cool. Wow, I love him to death!”

“HMPH, this is the difference. That Wang Xian doesn’t have any ability to fight back. The two of them are not on the same level!”

“He is also a popular figure in the school. He is not even worthy of carrying Mu Zidao’s shoes!”

The excited voices of the first and second year girls could be heard from the surroundings. The third and fourth year students sighed helplessly.

Wang Xian was indeed not on the same level as the celestial sect. He could not be compared to them at all.

There was nothing they could do after being humiliated today.

“Roar, Woof Woof!”

At this moment, the sound of dogs barking was suddenly heard. It caused the people around to be slightly surprised.

A golden figure of about two meters in size was standing at the spot where the RV was split open. His fierce gaze was staring at the obvious wind and the puppet chariot that he was sitting on.

However, everyone in the surroundings ignored him after a glance.

“How is it? Is this our territory now? If you don’t dare to spar with me, then Lower Your Head and admit your mistake!”

Mu Zidao stared at Wang Xian mockingly.

From the beginning to the end, he didn’t put Wang Xian in his eyes. So what if he was at least at the Dan Stage?

The Dragon Gate of the pugilistic world and the Dragon King? What the hell was that?

Compared to him, who was at the half-step to the infant stage, and the Ming Wang Immortal Sect, what was that?

“You still have the right to spar with me!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across Mu Zidao and Ming Feng who was sitting in the puppet station. A hint of coldness flashed across his eyes.

“Tian Tian, teach them a lesson!”

The corner of his mouth curled up slightly as he said faintly.

“Huh?” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Wang Xian’s words made Mu Zidao and Ming Feng’s eyebrows twitch. The people around them were also stunned.

However, at this moment.

“Roar, Roar Roar!”

The Heavenly Dog’s low roar was heard. Following that, before anyone could react, a terrifying aura was emitted from its body.

“Woof Woof!”

It roared and pounced on Ming Feng who was sitting in the puppet chariot.

“Eh? What?”

Ming Feng was stunned. When he saw the aura of the heavenly dog, his expression changed.

The white sword in the chariot was pulled out.

However, at this moment, the heavenly dog landed on the puppet chariot. It raised its paw and waved it.

“Boom!”

The entire chariot was torn apart. Ming Feng’s expression changed as the sword in his hand shone with a white light.

However, a dog claw swung over once again. The terrifying power caused a hint of despair to appear on Ming Feng’s face.

The longsword in his hand flew to the side. The clothes on his upper body were torn apart, and three wounds appeared on his chest.

A mocking and disdainful look appeared in the Heavenly Dog’s eyes. It opened its mouth and bit towards Ming Feng’s shoulder.

Ming Feng’s face was instantly filled with cold sweat as the light energy on his body trembled.

However, in an instant, the dog’s mouth directly bit onto his shoulder, causing the light on his body to immediately dim.

“Ah!”

Ming Feng let out a blood-curdling scream as he swung his head upwards. With a wave of his dog claws, the clothes on his lower body were instantly shattered into strips of cloth.

Three more wounds appeared on his body.

With a sweep of his tail, Ming Feng’s body smashed towards Mu Zidao.

In an instant, from the moment the heavenly dog’s attack ended, only an instant had passed.

Everyone in the surroundings widened their eyes in disbelief.

Ming Feng, an elite disciple of the immortal sect, was actually toyed with by a dog.

He didn’t have the slightest bit of strength left to resist. This... How was this possible?

“Ah! Beast!”

When Mu Zidao saw Ming Feng smashing towards him, his expression changed greatly and he immediately caught it.

However, at this moment, the heavenly dog moved. It waved its claws and clawed towards Mu Zidao.

“Go to hell!”

Mu Zidao’s expression changed greatly. The long sword in his hand instantly turned pure white. It was extremely dazzling as it slashed towards the heavenly dog.

“Bang!”

The long sword collided with Tian Gou’s claws, producing a sound of collision.

A trace of disdain flashed in Tian Gou’s eyes. With a slight force, the spirit sword directly flew towards the sky.

With a wave of its dog claws, a wound appeared on Mu Zidao’s body from top to bottom. His clothes also instantly split open.

Tian Gou repeated the action of attacking with obvious wind. Its body leaped and bit towards Mu Zidao’s shoulder.

“No, no!”

Mu Zidao’s face was filled with fear. He waved his fist and wanted to smash towards Tian Gou’s head.

Tian Gou’s eyes revealed ridicule. He didn’t Dodge at all and continued to bite towards Mu Zidao’s shoulder.

When Mu Zidao’s fist landed on the dog’s head, it instantly became numb. At this moment, he felt that he had ascended into the sky!

“Hiss!”

With a wave of the dog’s paw, his elegant and unworldly clothes had already formed into strips. It couldn’t cover his body at all.

“Peng!”

His body landed beside Ming Feng.

“Infant tier, it’s actually an infant tier creature!”

Ming Feng had recovered at this moment. He raised his head and shouted loudly with a face full of shock.

When the heavenly dog heard Ming Feng’s cry, it raised its head slightly. Its eyes were filled with human-like contempt.

It slowly walked towards the two people like a dog king.

“Don’t... Don’t Kill Us!”

When Mu Zidao saw the heavenly dog walking over, his face revealed a terrified expression.

The disdain and contempt in the eyes of the heavenly dog became even stronger. It walked over and waved its paw, drawing three bloody marks on their buttocks and buttocks.

Following that, the heavenly dog quickened its pace and ran to Wang Xian’s side. It bit its tail and spun around him.

“Not bad!”

Wang Xian stroked Tian Tian’s dog head in admiration and praised him.

“Woof Woof!”

Tian gou stuck out his tongue and licked it. He barked and raised his head slightly as if he was very proud.

“Gulp!”

“I... I saw something...”

“How is this possible? How is this possible!”

The people around them were in disbelief, especially the girls who were in their first year and second year. They looked at the scene in front of them in disbelief.

What did they just see?

A dog had completely defeated Mu Zidao and Ming Feng!

He had easily trampled on their Prince Charming with his dog paws. He was the invincible disciple of the immortal sect in their hearts.

Meanwhile, that dog was wagging its tail in front of Wang Xian.

The young man whom they looked down on and called unworthy of Mu Zidao and Ming Feng carrying their shoes.

“Mu Zidao and Ming Feng are actually, actually inferior to his dog!”

One of the girls widened her eyes as she looked at this scene in a daze.

The contrast, the huge contrast.

Just as they were about to watch the so-called famous person being easily crushed by Mu Zidao and student Xianfeng, they were easily killed by the opponent’s dog.

The two of them looked like they were in a sorry state, and everyone’s eyes were filled with shock.
