Buzz

Crash

Wang Xian flapped his incipient saint wings and quickly shuttled through the surrounding starry sky.

A day later, he arrived at a planet. This starry sky was very strange.

Two planets were connected together.

Green trees grew in the void. These green trees were also connected together.

Even the huge star and Sun in the center were connected to each other.

This was a very special starry sky.

It was also this special starry sky that created an intermediate race, the Gemini race.

Although the Gemini race was not very strong in the surrounding starry sky, they still had a few billion years of foundation.

The Gemini race had many disciples, and the entire void was the domain of the Gemini race.

The number of stars occupied by the Gemini race alone numbered in the millions. The number of Gemini race had reached a terrifying level.

The special and special space had created this special race.

“It really is a place where water and soil nourish a person. Hehe.”

Wang Xian came to this starry space. In this space, he could feel a special and strange energy. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

This kind of energy would have some effect on a person.

“There are people in the AI who refer to this place as the Gemini Domain. It seems like this is indeed the case.”

As Wang Xian spoke, he narrowed his eyes slightly and flew straight towards the main planet of the Gemini race according to the memories in his mind.

The main planet of the Gemini race was very special.

Most planets were solid while the starry sky of the Gemini race was like a hornet’s nest. It was densely packed and looked extremely shocking from afar.

The experts of the Gemini race lived in this Hornet’s nest.

“According to my memory, this planet is the most precious treasure of the Gemini race. The entire planet contains a terrifying wind attribute force. The closer to the center, the more experts there are of the Gemini race.”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the area.

He had to be careful.

After all, it was an elementary race in the universe.

His body moved, and his body began to turn illusory as he flew straight in.

What the Gemini race could confirm was that they did not have a level five universe knight.

This allowed Wang Xian to sneak in very smoothly.

With his concealment ability, only a level five universe knight or above could sense it.

It was located at the core of the entire planet of the Gemini race.

It was also the largest cave entrance in the center. After Wang Xian entered, he immediately sensed the strong wind attribute law energy.

The entire cave entrance was only a thousand kilometers in height. Looking up from below, one could see the green energy.

In the sky, there were some wind attribute trees and plants.

The scenery of the plants above was indeed a little strange.

However, the entire interior was very beautiful.

Wang Xian flapped his wings and flew rapidly into the cave.

The plants in the sky gave him the best cover.

As he flew into the cave, he soon saw many palaces.

The palaces were lined up in a row. At a glance, they looked exceptionally luxurious.

“It’s about time. We can start now.”

Just as he was about to reach the center, Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled.

He took out the five elements millstone. With a move of his palm, he positioned it in the sky above the five elements millstone. The fire god Dragon slowly extended his hand.

“Let’s attract all the experts from the Gemini race over first.”

He muttered to himself. With a wave of his arm, the five elements Millstone flew straight ahead.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The next moment, the roar reverberated throughout the entire planet. A fire god Dragon swayed its huge body and roared furiously.

The Fire God Dragon’s power was not very strong. It was only comparable to a level four universe knight.

However, with the support of the five elements grinding mill, the fire god Dragon’s recovery and endurance had reached a terrifying level.

Boom

Under the control of Wang Xian, the fire god Dragon raised his head and unleashed a ball of terrifying flames towards the palace in front of him.

“What? What Happened?”

“Divine Dragon? Fire God Dragon? Why did a divine dragon suddenly appear in our Gemini Race?”

“Bastard, quick, destroy him!”

This was the core of the entire Gemini race. It was also the residence of countless experts of the Gemini race.

When a fire dragon suddenly appeared within them, the expressions of the great beings of the twin species changed drastically.

The Universe Knights immediately attacked the Fire Dragon.

Roar! Roar! Roar

The fire dragon swayed its huge body, and waves of terrifying flames attacked the universe knights.

“Oh no, this dragon is very powerful. Why did such a dragon suddenly appear here?”

“What the hell is going on?”

The Universe Knights’expressions changed drastically, and they roared in embarrassment.

“Roar!”

“Peng! Peng! Peng!”

In the sky, the fire god Dragon Tail, which was over 30,000 meters long, swept toward the Dozen Universe Knights.

“Dodge! Dodge!”

The Universe Knights of the twin races’expressions changed drastically.

Peng! Peng! Peng

However, five or six universe knights were killed instantly.

Hu! Hu! Hu

At this moment, the sound of rushing wind could be heard throughout the entire planet.

“What happened?”

“The highest alert is that there’s an enemy invasion!”

“Who dares to invade our twin races?”

Universe Knights of the twin races rushed toward them from the other caves.

When they saw the flaming fire dragon, their expressions changed.

“Why did a fire dragon suddenly appear on our side?”

A two-faced old man frowned and asked with a serious expression.

“Leader, we don’t know either. This fire dragon suddenly appeared in the sky, and it’s exactly the same as the legendary dragon. It should be a pure-blooded dragon!”

A two-faced old man flew over and said solemnly.

“Send someone to guard the surroundings and kill this fire god Dragon First!”

The leader of the twin races ordered coldly.

“It’s the leader!”

“Kill this fire god Dragon!”

The old man roared and ordered the universe knights around him.

“It’s the Supreme Elder!”

The Universe Knights responded immediately. In an instant, 700 to 800 universe knights attacked the Fire God Dragon.

The leader of the twin races gestured to the Great Beings around him and started to look around.

Suddenly, a fire god Dragon appeared. They had to be alert to see if there were any accomplices around or if there was a conspiracy.

“I wonder if I can destroy this twin species with the five elements millstone alone.”

Wang Xian hid in a corner and stared at the battle ahead with a cold gaze.

He had merely ordered a divine dragon from the five elements millstone to come out and fight. He wanted to attract all the experts from the twin species to come over.

Then, he would capture them all in one go!
