Chapter 819: 0820 Battle of dragons and snakes

Translator: 549690339

The Sea of snakes was the name given to the sea ahead by the killer crab, ao crab, because there were countless snakes there.

The area of the Sea of snakes was about 100 kilometers in radius. In this 100 kilometers, it was the territory of the Hydra.

In this area, and even the surrounding area, were all within the jurisdiction of the Sea of snakes. Because the killer crabs were tough bones, the snakes could not digest them, so the killer crabs could survive nearby.

Otherwise, they would have already entered the snake’s stomach.

“Dragon King, we have already entered the area of the Sea of snakes. We have to be careful!”

As soon as they entered the area of the Sea of snakes, ao crab said to Wang Xian in a panic.

Wang Xian nodded his head and swept his gaze forward. In the sea area ahead, he could see sea snakes every few hundred meters.

Among them, there were not only sea snakes. He even found some powerful terrestrial venomous snakes.

Some snakes were two to three meters long, but there were also snakes that were more than ten meters long.

Some of the snakes had triangular heads, and some of the venomous snakes had sharp teeth that were exposed to the air. There were all kinds of colors. Looking at them, it was enough to make one’s scalp tingle.

“Why are there venomous snakes on the land? There are even some Shui Mang among them!”

Wang Xian frowned slightly and revealed a look of surprise.

This place could really be considered a sea of snakes. Many of the snakes were very weak and had not even reached the innate level.

However, there were also powerful pythons, weird two-headed snakes, and even three-headed snakes.

These mutated snakes were all very powerful.

“Let’s continue!”

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings. There were many sea grasses at the bottom of the sea. Some snakes were hidden within the sea grasses, and their colors were the same as the sea grasses.

“Hiss, hiss, hiss!”

Seeing Wang Xian and the rest coming over, some snakes stuck out their tongues and made a special sound in the water.

Soon, this sound was heard continuously in the surroundings, as if it was a special signal.

Wang Xian looked at the snakes that were spitting out their tongues curiously and sized up this strange sea of snakes.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Just as they were advancing a few thousand meters forward, suddenly, from the undergrowth at the bottom of the sea, dozens of strange snakes that were about ten meters in size attacked them directly.

Each of the ten snakes had the strength of the Dan stage. Waves of Venom shot towards them directly.

Crackle! Crackle

The sound of thunder and Lightning was heard. A few infant stage members of the Thunder Shrimp clan released bolts of lightning and struck the ten snakes directly.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss

After the ten snakes died, the dense cries of the snakes were heard again. Moreover, the cries were even louder than before!

“Continue!”

Wang Xian was puzzled. The surrounding snakes were merely making their cries. He could not understand what they meant.

They kept walking forward at a slow speed.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

When they were about ten kilometers ahead, suddenly, a stream of black poisonous liquid came from all directions.

The poisonous liquid entered the water and turned the surrounding seawater into poisonous liquid.

The poisonous liquid surged towards them and surrounded them slowly from all directions.

Buzz

At this moment, a strange demon’s figure moved and a bright energy swept out in all directions.

Although the strange demon was not good at healing with light, the energy carried by the light attribute was still very effective against poison.

Furthermore, it was the light emitted by an immortal God.

As the light swept past, all the poison disappeared.

“The sea of snakes is filled with danger. It’s very dangerous!”

Ao crab looked around vigilantly and said to Wang Xian.

“Advance!”

Wang Xian looked at the snakes that were screaming again. He was astonished.

The attack from the ten snakes and the venom was obviously premeditated.

In other words, the snakes in the Sea of snakes were ambushing the intruders?

“If that’s the case, this Hydra is indeed extraordinary.”

Wang Xian looked around. The venomous snakes that were ambushing them earlier left quickly.

They were organized and disciplined. This was definitely not something an ordinary immortal creature could do.

Wang Xian had seen many immortal creatures before. Perhaps the ones with the highest intelligence and the most experience were the immortal creatures from the Wild Beast Immortal sect.

Most of the other celestial beings that he had encountered were as intelligent as ao crab. They definitely did not understand so many things.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Just as Wang Xian and the rest continued to move forward, the sound of water breaking could be heard. Wang Xian looked up and saw a dense cluster of poisonous fangs attacking them.

In front of them, more than 100 poisonous snakes that were emitting a cold aura were staring at them.

Each of the poisonous snakes was 15 meters long and lined up neatly.

They had black bodies and pitch-black teeth. What they had attacked earlier was the venom that they had released. The venom was like teeth and was filled with penetrating power.

“10 of them are in the infant stage. The rest are all in the Dan Stage!”

Wang Xian sensed their strength and his eyes sparkled.

“Destroy them!”

Ao Qitian waved his arm and the group of demon monkeys attacked the 100 plus snakes in front of them.

“Roar, Kill!”

The group of demon monkeys moved and attacked the venomous snakes with terrifying attacks.

The 100 plus venomous snakes were nothing in front of the demon monkeys. One by one, the demon monkeys easily cracked the bodies of the venomous snakes.

The two of them were on completely different levels of battle.

“Could it be that there are more powerful attacks waiting for me ahead?”

Wang Xian revealed a curious expression.

The snakes that were ambushing them were getting stronger and stronger. This time, there were even ten infant stage powerhouses.

Ten infant stage snakes were sufficient to deal with many intruders.

“This is?”

Just as Wang Xian and the rest continued to walk forward for about ten kilometers, they approached the center of the Sea of snakes.

At the bottom of the sea, a pitch-black semi-sphere was formed.

It was a semi-sphere that was enveloped by black venom. If one wanted to enter it, one had to pass through the black venom.

“This venom is like a good formation. It used the venom to form a defense. It’s really smart. This HYDRA is really smart. After layers of defense, only immortal-level creatures can enter it!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Wang Xian’s face was filled with admiration. If they weren’t so strong, they would have died halfway.

Could there be an even stronger existence waiting for us behind this venom?

Wang Xian guessed in his heart. His eyes were flashing with red and blue light.

“Eh, Something’s Not Right. This is not a layer of defense. The area ahead is filled with venom.”

“In other words, there’s a sea of venom within a radius of at least ten kilometers. The Hydra should live in the Sea of Venom and establish its own territory.”.

Even if a powerful immortal god was able to barge in here, they could forget about killing him.

There was absolutely no mistake. The Hydra had established a perfect defensive space!
