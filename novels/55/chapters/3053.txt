Chapter 3054: 3053 unbridled 4

“Under the Milky Way? Let’s go and kill him!”

The Ice Mountain Race’s Greatsword Protector stood on the deck in front of the battleship. His gaze was fixed on the Milky Way as he ordered the surrounding elders.

Their bodies moved as they flew downwards.

Master Yu followed closely from the side as he read the information on the book.

“Surround the surroundings. Don’t let him escape.”

Twelve level nine celestial thearch powerhouses and one peak celestial thearch powerhouse stared coldly at the location below and flew away quickly.

“Eh?”

At the same time, at the location below the Milky Way, the dragon eyes had been staring at the person above. He immediately frowned.

With his Dragon Eyes’vision and the enhancement of his ability in the water, Wang Xian’s vision in the ocean was not affected at all. On the contrary, it was enhanced.

Even the vision of a powerhouse at the peak of the celestial thearch might not be as good as his.

Seeing that the other party was flying downwards, Wang Xian knew that the other party had already known his location.

“Let’s Go!”

He frowned and kept the Mi Xin deer into the mother nest. Then, he quickly hid in a certain direction.

Wang Xian’s speed was very fast when he was swimming in the ocean.

“He is escaping in that direction.”

At this moment, master Yu, who was following beside the guardian of the Ice Mountain Race’s giant sword, saw the change of target in the book and said immediately.

“His speed is very fast.”

Following closely, he frowned slightly when he saw the speed of the target in the book.

“Chase!”

The middle-aged guardian of the giant sword shouted loudly and brought master Yu to the maximum speed.

However, they were located in the Milky Way and were already close to one billion kilometers away. It was impossible for them to catch up to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian was located in the inner part of the Milky Way and was flying in one direction at a rapid speed.

“Damn it, his speed is so fast!”

The Guardian of the giant sword at the back could not see the figure in front of him even after ten minutes of chasing. This made him look a little embarrassed.

However, the good thing was that he could already sense some aura.

“Guardian Bing Ling, his speed is not slower than yours at all.”

Master Yu looked at the speed of the target in the book and said with a dark face, “Moreover, we are traveling unscrupulously in the Milky Way. We might encounter danger.”

“Continue to chase. If we don’t kill him, our Bing Ling race will not give up.”

The giant sword protector growled with a face full of killing intent. He waved his arm and the giant sword in his hand slashed directly behind him.

A huge reverse force pushed his speed to a terrifying level.

“I see it!”

At this moment, he saw a figure fleeing rapidly in front of him. His gaze froze and was filled with murderous intent.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian also sensed the figure chasing after him from behind. He frowned and accelerated abruptly. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“His speed has increased again. Damn it.”

The Giant Sword Protector’s face was extremely cold as he continued to pursue him from behind.

“Protector Bingling, are we going to continue pursuing him?”

“With his speed, it will be very difficult to catch up to him. Furthermore, he might encounter powerful dire beasts.”

Master Yu didn’t want to take the risk and spoke up.

“Pursue him. With him in front, even if he were to be attacked, he would be the first to be attacked. We are pursuing him from behind. The danger is minimal. Don’t worry, master Yu, we will not be in danger.”

The Guardian of the giant sword said with a solemn face.

“Alright then.”

Master Yu pondered for a moment and nodded slightly. “He wants to fly in the direction of the willow deity Daoist sect.”

“Do you want to escape to the Willow deity Daoist sect? Wishful Thinking.”

The Guardian of the giant sword immediately changed his direction and headed to the side to intercept him.

With Master Yu’s lock on him, he was not afraid of losing him.

“Huh?”

Five minutes later, Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly when he saw the ice-cold Race’s powerhouse appearing by his side.

“I’ve been locked on.”

Wang Xian looked at the two figures behind him and a cold expression appeared on his face.

There must be a wizard who had locked on to him.

“Let’s see who’s faster.”

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a cold expression. He pushed his speed to the limit and flew in another direction.

“HMPH, as long as he doesn’t enter the willow deity Daoist sect, he will have to pay the price.”

“Immediately arrange for people to guard the surroundings of the willow deity Daoist sect.”

The huge sword Protector’s face was gloomy.

He knew that it would be difficult to kill the other party this time. However, as long as he could force the other party back to his divine kingdom or force him to use the fallen leaves to return to his divine kingdom, he would succeed this time.

Next time, they would be able to kill him.

It had to be said that it would be very troublesome to kill the disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect.

“Do I have to keep chasing him?”

Wang Xian sensed the figure behind him and frowned slightly.

He flapped his incipient saint wings and continued to fly forward.

His dragon eyes scanned the area in front of him warily. In the middle, he encountered many aquatic creatures of the celestial emperor level.

However, he did not have the time to hunt these aquatic creatures at this moment.

After flying for more than five hours, Wang Xian did not know where he had flown to. The aura behind him was still chasing after him.

“Still chasing?”

Wang Xian’s expression turned slightly awkward. If he continued to chase after them, he would not be able to escape.

Unless Wang Xian returned to the Dragon Palace in an instant. However, the Dragon Palace was too far away.

“I can’t waste any more time. Even if I let an lie send me here, it’s better than being chased all the time.”

“Besides, I still have this.”

Wang Xian mumbled as a fallen leaf appeared in his palm. A hint of killing intent surged in his heart.

After getting rid of it this time, he would make the ice mountain race pay the price.

The Fallen Leaf’s return journey was obtained from the few people who were killed.

Now, he had a total of two pieces in his hand.

Whoosh

“Not good!”

At this moment, Wang Xian sensed a terrifying sense of danger attacking him.

His expression changed and he immediately looked to the side.

A desolate beast with a sharp head and a slender body was attacking him directly.

The strange attack and the terrifying speed caused Wang Xian’s expression to change drastically.

At this moment, he didn’t hesitate at all and crushed the fallen leaves on his way back.

His figure disappeared instantly.

When the desolate beast that was hiding and hunting around saw that Wang Xian had disappeared, it shook its body and let out an unwilling growl.

“That fellow has disappeared.”

At the back, Master Yu read the information in the book and immediately said.

“A desolate beast at the peak of the Divine Emperor Realm has appeared in front. This fellow must have been attacked, so he used the fallen leaves to escape in an instant.”

The huge sword protector revealed an excited and ferocious expression.

“Let’s go back. There are our people monitoring the willow deity Daoist sect.”

A smile appeared on the face of the giant sword protector as he said immediately.

At the same time, in the Willow deity Daoist sect, Wang Xian’s figure gradually solidified. He looked a little embarrassed.

“Hahaha, Wang Xian, let me tell you. This is only the beginning. The Revenge of our ice mountain race has only just begun. It Won’t be long before we take your head!”

A sinister laughter suddenly came from the side.
