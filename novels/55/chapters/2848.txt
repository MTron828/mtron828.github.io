Powerful energies emanated from the 20 over people, the strongest was at level 7, the weakest was at level 5.

However, amongst them, there were 4 at Level 7.

This caused ye Lui Ying and the rest’s expressions to change, their eyes filled with rage.

“Are you guys planning to rob us?”

!!

Fourth senior sister stared at them with a grave expression and asked in a deep voice.

“Hehe, it’s wrong to rob us. This wind jade is ownerless. Whoever gets it will get it. So, please leave this place so that we won’t hurt the Peace!”

The middle-aged man in the lead narrowed his eyes slightly and said with a smile.

Fourth senior sister and the others were stunned. Their expressions changed.

The other party was stronger than them, so it was obvious that he had them!

“Disappear from our sight within ten seconds, or else don’t blame us for being impolite!”

A middle-aged man next to them held two balls in his hands and threw them up, warning them indifferently.

“You… you don’t dare to go too far!”

Seeing their domineering appearance, Ye Lui Ying roared with a face full of anger.

“They are wearing the clothes of the eight barrens. They are from the eight Barrens!”

At the side, sixth senior sister said in a low voice. Her expression was extremely ugly.

The other party was from the eight barrens. Even if they were to introduce themselves, the other party would not be afraid.

At the front, fourth senior sister also realized this problem. Her face was filled with unwillingness.

“Alright!”

The other party was obviously stronger than them. They could not do anything about it.

“Hehe, if you know what’s good for you, then put down the wind jade in your hands and leave this place!”

The middle-aged man in the lead said with a laugh.

“Oh?”

Fourth senior sister’s expression changed slightly when she heard their words, and her eyes revealed a cold expression.

“What did you say?”

She gritted her teeth and asked.

“I said, leave the Wind Jade in your hands, or we can only send you away and let you return to your own Divine Kingdom!”

“Hehe, I don’t know where your divine kingdom is. I don’t know if I can make it back if I go back. It would be bad if I miss the windless day.”

The middle-aged man in the lead said kindly, but he also looked as if he had them in his pocket.

Not only did they want the more than twenty wind jade in front of them, they also wanted the Wind Jade that fourth senior sister had already obtained!

They wanted all of them!

“You… you are clearly robbing us. Do you really think that we are easy to bully!”

Ye lui Ying pointed at them angrily.

“Hahaha, I will still give you ten seconds to consider!”

The middle-aged man who had spoken just now laughed loudly again.

“Ka Ka Ka!”

At this moment, even fifth senior brother and sixth senior sister were filled with anger. They clenched their fists and made sounds.

They could give up on the Feng Yu that they didn’t get, but now, they actually wanted to snatch away the Feng Yu that fourth senior sister had already gotten.

Outrageous!

“Hehe!”

At the front, the disciples of the eight barrens held their heads up slightly and crossed their arms as they stared at them mockingly.

Wang Xian, who was standing at the side, looked at them and shook his head slightly.

This was really… courting death!

“I really didn’t expect this. It’s really fate!”

Wang Xian, who was from the eight Barrens sect, didn’t take it seriously at all. Just as he was about to make his move, his expression suddenly paused and he stopped.

He looked to the left and a smile slowly appeared on his face.

“Tianxin, it’s right in front of you. I’ve already sensed it!”

“I told you. With my invincible battle techniques, I’ll definitely get you a large amount of wind jade for your cultivation this time!”

“HMPH!”

A voice that made the man very unhappy was heard.

However, this voice made Wang Xian feel a sense of familiarity.

“Brother Invincible, you’re really something. Your Water Mirror Technique is amazing!”

“That’s right, brother invincible. It’s all thanks to you this time!”

Following that, a flattering voice was heard.

“There are already people occupying the front!”

At this moment, another pleasant-sounding voice was heard.

“Occupying that area? Haha, Feng Yu is fated to be with me there. So what if others occupy that area?”

A slightly arrogant voice continued to be heard.

“HMM?”

Suddenly, another group of people appeared. When they heard these voices, they frowned slightly.

This was especially so for the disciples of the eight barrens. When they heard a name, their expressions changed slightly.

Ye Lui Ying and the others immediately looked to the left.

“Wow, there are quite a few people. Everyone, this treasure is fated to be with this young master. All of you should leave quickly!”

A group of people appeared in their line of sight.

A young man who looked like he was the number one person in the world looked over. He raised his head slightly and spoke arrogantly.

Beside him were a dozen middle-aged men and a lady.

The Lady had an outstanding appearance and a sweet and charming face. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“This treasure is fated to be mine. All of you, leave quickly!”

When Wang Xian heard this, his face turned black.

This fellow had not changed at all after so many years!

“This person seems to be the invincible one who is famous for his battle techniques!”

Fifth Brother stared at the invincible fighter and frowned.

He hadn’t been here for long, but he knew that the invincible fighter was mainly because he was too high profile.

However, he had the right to be high profile, his master was a god Emperor.

His talent was said to be extremely monstrous, he had the strength of an undying level 7 at such a young age.

It was said that he was invincible in the same level.

“Invincible in battle techniques!”

“This place was discovered by US eight Barrens First!”

The leader of eight barrens frowned and said coldly to invincible in battle techniques.

“You discovered it first? I’ve already said that this item has fate with me, what’s the use of discovering it first?”

Invincible in battle techniques glanced at eight barrens and the others, not putting them in his eyes at all.

“Hehe, over 20 wind jades, all undying god King Level 6, Tian Xin, these wind jades should be enough for you to cultivate for a while.”

Invincible battle technique only arrogantly ignored everyone, looking at the wind jades, smiling at the lady beside him.

“Isn’t this a little bad!”

The lady looked around and asked him.

“What’s bad about it? I’ve already said that this Feng Yu is fated to be with us, this is a treasure that belongs to us.”

Invincible said shamelessly.

“Invincible, are you not putting us in your eyes?”

The group in front saw this punk actually flirting with girls in front of them, ignoring them, their faces filled with rage.

“I really don’t put you all in my eyes, what? You want to fight with me? JUST THE FOUR OF YOU UNDYING Level 7 warriors? Just you people?”

Invincible slightly raised his head and said with disdain.

“You…”

The group’s expressions changed, staring at invincible with embarrassment.

Invincible was a god Emperor’s final disciple, even if they were of the same level, they weren’t his match.

Even if all of them attacked together, it would not be as good as his trump card.
