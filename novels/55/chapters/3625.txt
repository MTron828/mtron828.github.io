3626 3625. was there really an invincible enemy in this world? 4

“The Supreme Water Monster King suppressed the Frost Divine Dragon and continued to fight. With the experience of the Supreme Water Monster King, he was able to kill it. The old scholar obviously had the confidence to kill the red-clothed woman, not to mention the black tower wizards. It’s extremely strange, so we can be sure that the dragon palace will be destroyed!”

“It should be. It must have cost a lot to invite the monster king, the Black Tower Magus, and the old scholar here at the same time. TSK TSK, did the angel race intervene?”

“The few experts from the Dragon Palace are indeed strong enough. It’s a pity that they met the three top-notch experts from our invincible region!”

“Hehe, that’s true. The top-notch experts from our invincible region can easily wipe out over a dozen experts of the same level!”

The innate supreme treasure covered the dragon palace, so they couldn’t see what was going on inside!

The experts of the invincible zone also spoke out in boredom, their voices echoing in the sky above the heavenly river!

When they spoke, there was a hint of pride!

They were proud of the strength of the experts of the Invincible Zone!

Of course, this pride came from their powerful confidence!

“Is… is it really as they say? is the Dragon Palace really going to be destroyed?”

“It should be. Did you feel it? The experts of the invincible zone are all very terrifying. We must not provoke them!”

“The experts at their level are absolutely right. You should know that there are top-tier races like angels, demons, dark clan, divine tiger, Black Tortoise, and other experts in their group. The Dragon Palace is finished!”

“This is the will of the angel race. After all, the angel race is too terrifying. Even if they don’t go out, they still have thousands of ways to destroy the Dragon Palace!”

Some of the experts’disciples heard the experts of the invincible zone talking and also whispered!

They were in awe of the invincible zone and the experts of the Invincible Zone!

Some of the disciples of the experts took the universal AI and posted the information immediately!

Some experts directly edited the information: The Dragon Palace was currently sealed by the three terrifying existences of the invincible region. Although they couldn’t see the situation inside clearly, there were experts of the invincible region around, many experts from the peak races said that the Dragon Palace was about to be destroyed. The three experts of the supreme water demon king were extremely terrifying!

After he finished editing the information, he sent it out!

At this moment, the Universe AI was boiling!

An old monster like the Tai Shui Demon King from a long time ago had challenged the Dragon Palace Dragon King, and it had already attracted the attention of countless Great Beings’disciples!

However, when the Tai Shui Demon King arrived, not only was he alone, but there were also two terrifying beings from the invincible region, and there were more than 70 universe rulers and level 3 great beings from the six great races of the Holy Dragon bloodline.., the Universe AI was shocked!

They knew that this wasn’t a normal challenge, but to destroy the Dragon Palace!

This attracted the attention of all the disciples from all the factions in the universe ai!

Countless people were discussing!

The Dragon Palace would be destroyed by the Invincible Region Warriors?

The Dragon Palace wouldn’t be destroyed?

All sorts of discussions were going on!

But when the latest news was sent, everyone was even more shocked!

“Is the Dragon Palace really going to be destroyed?”

“Hiss, is that really what the experts of the Invincible Zone said? Then it seems like the Dragon Palace is doomed!”

“The Dark Horse of the Dragon Palace’s counterattack will end here. After all, destroying the Dragon Palace has the will of the Angel clan!”

On the universe’s AI, some powerful disciples couldn’t help but feel sorry for the Dragon Palace!

With the last hope of the Divine Dragon Clan, the strongest force of the Divine Dragon clan was going to be destroyed in the end!

Many of the powerful disciples discussed, and at the same time, they felt the terror of the Invincible Zone!

The strength of the Dragon Palace could only be so terrifying!

The strength of the Dragon King could only be so strong! FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The mutated purebred divine dragon, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, was still no match for the old monster of the Invincible Zone!

One could imagine how terrifying the Invincible Zone was!

It was worthy of the name of the Invincible Zone!

While the disciples of countless races were discussing on the universal AI, the experts of the invincible zone were still chatting in the sky above the Heavenly River.

While the disciples were waiting for the news, waiting for the Dragon Palace to be completely destroyed!

Below, the energy that enveloped the dragon palace slowly began to dissipate!

“Eh?”

The dissipation of the energy enveloping the dragon palace immediately attracted the attention of the old monsters of the surrounding invincible region!

They looked over in astonishment!

“Ten minutes, it’s only been ten minutes and the black tower’s Magus, Taishui Demon King, and the old scholar have already destroyed the Dragon Palace?”

An old monster of the Divine Tiger Clan asked in puzzlement.

“It’s about the same. The old scholar said that after destroying the red-clothed woman of the Dragon Palace in five minutes, it’ll be simple…”

His companion nodded, but he didn’t say anything. His eyes instantly widened as he stared down in disbelief!

What did he see?

The Dragon Palace was intact, and the disciples of the Dragon Palace stood there indifferently!

“Top-tier experts of the Invincible Zone? In my opinion, they are trash, too trash!”

“Haha, that’s right. They even showed off to our Dragon King and said that they would take our Dragon King’s head. Just those three trash?”

“They’re really too good-for-nothings. Our Dragon King gets one good-for-nothings every time he moves. They all say that the experts of the invincible zone are powerful. I think they’re just that. They’re too good-for-nothings!”

“Haha, it’s mainly because our dragon king is too powerful. However, the invincible zone is indeed worthy of its name. Our Dragon King can casually kill this top-notch expert. Invincible Zone? Hehe, I think our Dragon Palace can change its name to the Invincible Dragon Palace!”

“Haha, that’s fine. Those six great races still dare to besiege us. Now, TSK TSK, clean up the corpses and bring them into the Dragon Palace!”

“Under the realm of universe ruler, our Dragon King is invincible. Everything else is trash!”

“Trash!”

“Trash!”

“Trash!”

At this time, a leisurely voice was heard, full of mockery and disdain!

All the Old Monsters of the invincible zone stared wide-eyed at the figures of the Dragon Palace who were speaking!

Their bodies trembled violently!

What was going on?

The Supreme Water Demon King was dead?

The Black Tower Magi were dead?

The old scholar was dead?

The three top experts of the Invincible Zone had died just like that?

“Cough cough, how… How is this possible? How is this possible? It’s only been ten minutes, and all of them are dead. The supreme water demon king, the Black Tower Magus, the old scholar, and the others are the top experts of our invincible zone!”

An old monster from the angel race widened his eyes and growled in disbelief!

“10 minutes, 71 universe ruler Level 1 warriors, and three top-tier old monsters from our invincible region. How… How Strong is this Dragon Palace? How Strong is the Dragon King?”

An old monster from the Godly Tiger Race, a pinnacle race, opened his mouth and said in shock!

“Is there really an invincible enemy in this world?”

An old monster from the Saint clan murmured!

Everyone around was shocked. Invincible under the universe ruler?

Really?
