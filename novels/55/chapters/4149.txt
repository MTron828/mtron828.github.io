Translator: 549690339

“HM? Knight Level 5 strength?”

Tianci stood on the stage and announced his strength, all the disciples around him heard him and looked at him in shock.

Hidden Dragon’s stage, on this stage, all of them were under 200 million years old.

At this age, most of them had just stepped into the knight realm.

With a glance, there were only a few level 3 knights!

Not to mention a level 5 knight.

There wasn’t even one in the entire arena.

“Mu Li tribe, a level 5 knight, so strong, he’s definitely in the top 3 in our group!

“Almost, how does this guy train? Why is his level so high, most importantly, he’s not from the dead tribe or the Black Earth tribe.”

“Wow, this level, isn’t it much higher than ours?”

Some youths glanced at Tian Chi who stood out from the crowd, their faces filled with envy and respect.

In this hidden dragon and young Phoenix Arena, all of them were the top youths of the six paths universe.

They came from the various large tribes.

Every one of them was one of the top few existences in their own tribes.

But now, some of them had been struck by Tian Ci!

“HM, not bad, to be able to train for over 90 million years to possess such strength, that’s really not bad! ”

In the middle of the Hidden Dragon Chick’s arena, an old man floated in the air.

His gaze swept over Tian Ci, nodding his head, praising him generously!

“HMM? What? He hasn’t even cultivated for 100 million years?” “No way! He’s only half my age, but he’s already so powerful?”

“Hiss, how terrifying! ”

Everyone in the surroundings was slightly shocked when they heard the old man’s words.

“I really didn’t expect that I would be invincible in the same generation. I didn’t expect this brother to be so powerful as well. Hahaha, this is interesting! ”

At this moment, a youth flew over from the seat of honor at the front.

There were more than a hundred people beside the youth.

The youth in the middle was at least three meters tall and his entire body was filled with explosive muscles!

He looked extremely thick.

He looked at tianci and laughed out loud!

“Invincible in the same generation? You Are Tujiang Tong from the Mystic

Earth tribe, right? Your strength is not bad, but you are not my match! ”

“Huala! ”

The group of youths from the Mystic Earth tribe flew over and landed on the

arena.

The youth in the lead swept his gaze over Tujiang Tong and tianci.

“The two of you aren’t my match! ”

He said with confidence and arrogance!

At his neck was a human head that was flickering with a black light. The black light reflected on his pale face, making it look extremely strange.

“You two are so small, I’ll send you flying with a Slap! ”

Tu Jiang Tong saw the youth flying over and shook his head with disdain!

Tian Chi’s gaze swept over them, hearing their words, he smiled too!

“Two knights at Level 5, if they join forces, they can barely compare to me! ”

He moved his palm and the water in front of him condensed, a sharp sword appeared in his hand.

Tianci said indifferently.

It was as if he was talking about something very easy!

The moment he finished speaking, Tu Jiang Tong and the youth from the dead tribe were slightly stunned, their eyes focused on him.

“Haha, I thought I was confident enough, I didn’t expect you to be even more confident and arrogant than me! ”

Tu Jiang Tong stared at Tianci and laughed!

He narrowed his eyes and walked straight towards tianci. He sized him up and slowly extended his huge palm.

“Very good, let’s get to know each other! ”

Tu Jiang Tong walked over, extended his hand and said to tianci.

Tianci smiled and extended his hand to shake Tianci’s!

“HMM?”

All the gazes of the surrounding youths were focused on him.

This was clearly an open and hidden battle.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

A pair of huge palms and a pair of small palms were clasped together.

Following that, everyone could feel waves of energy brewing in their palms.

Some of the weaker ones could not help but take a step back!

Tianci and Tu Jiang Tong smiled as they looked at each other.

Their bodies were somewhat out of sync!

But soon, the smile on Tu Jiangtong’s face began to disappear.

Five seconds later, he quickly pulled out his arm, and his huge arm kept shaking!

He stared at tianci, and his expression kept changing!

“Not bad! ”

Tianci looked at him, smiled, and said.

“Okay, okay, okay. It really is okay. It seems that if I want to beat you, I need to use all my trump cards! ”

Tu Jiang Tong’s expression changed slightly as he said to Tianci with a serious expression!

“I’m looking forward to the duel!”

Tianci smiled at him.

“Haha, Good, good, I’m looking forward to it! ”

“This is interesting. It seems like the first place of our group will be decided between us and this pretty boy!”

Tu Jiang Tong said with a loud laugh. He was very forthright!

When the youth from the dead tribe heard Tu Jiang Tong address him, his face turned black and he immediately cursed!

Tu Jiang Tong didn’t pay much attention when he heard that.

“That person called Mu Li Tianci is so handsome. He’s not at a disadvantage when facing the two elites from the Black Earth tribe and the dead tribe. He even has the upper hand. ”

“He’s really handsome. I didn’t expect him to be able to compete with Tu Jiang Tong and the others. He’s really amazing. ”

Some of the young men looked at the three of them and whispered among themselves.

Some of the young ladies looked at Mu Litianci with stars in their eyes.

“He is a little high-profile.”

Mu Liyin ‘er had been looking at tianci from below. When she saw this scene, she frowned slightly and said!

“Hehe, it’s a waste of a young man to not be arrogant! ”

When Wang Xian heard that, he smiled faintly and did not care about it at all.

This was the temperament that a young man should have.

Modest, confident, and proud!

“A talented young man should naturally be more flamboyant!”

Mu Liyin’s father, who was standing at the side, also said with a smile. His face was filled with happiness.

“Yin c er, you should also go to the arena to spar with each other. The calamity is about to arrive. Next, you should also raise your own strength! ” Mu Liyin’s father said to her, “Let’s see if we can obtain a decent result.”

“I’ll give it a try, but I’m afraid it’ll be a little difficult, there are too many strong fighters. ”

Mu Li Yin ‘er said.

In the other arenas, there were many proud fighters.

In the proud fighters’ group, the strong fighters had already reached the pinnacle of the Universe Knight Realm.

She was much weaker.

However, she could still give it a try.

Next, the six paths convention officially began.

The strong disciples of the four groups also began to compete for the 1,000 spots!
