“This Dragon Palace’s strength is so strong, in this battle, they’ve killed about 7,000 to 8,000 undying Emperor Abyss seeds!”

“That Dragon Mountain’s attack is so terrifying, that flaming golden sword, every one of them has an undying emperor level attack right?”

“That Dragon Palace’s strength isn’t as weak as we thought, it’s indeed worthy of being able to take out our northern Frost deputy sect leader’s training technique!”

“With the help of the powerhouse from the Dragon Palace, our losses are much, much less!”

While Wang Xian was exchanging pleasantries with the powerhouses from the Bei Chuan sect, on the surrounding planets, some of the Bei Chuan sect disciples were discussing in astonishment!

To be able to kill an immortal king level 8 abyss species, their strength was almost on par with their bei Chuan sect!

Even if they were relying on the strength of the Dragon Peak!

Because of bei Shuang, the Bei Chuan sect had a good impression of the Dragon Palace!

“Master, I’m going to continue my cultivation!”

After chatting with the Bei Chuan sect leader for a while, they left immediately!

Bei Shuang also informed Wang Xian and left immediately!

Wang Xian watched them leave with a smile on his face!

He moved and immediately flew towards the planet where the Dragon Palace was built!

After he arrived, Ao Yao, Mu Zesen, and the rest of the strange arrow dragon species followed him to the main Dragon Palace!

“Ao Yao, Mu Zesen, both of you have leveled up to immortal king level eight. Use the rest to upgrade the arrow dragon species and the piercing dragon species!”

Wang Xian took out all the resources of the Abyss species to upgrade the strange demon and the Heavenly Eye Arrow Division!

Most importantly, with the help of the Dragon Peak, the heaven’s Eye Arrow Division’s combat strength far exceeded that of the other dragon species!

As for Ao Yao and the rest, there was no need to mention them. They could assassinate and be invisible in the void!

“This time, with their upgrade, the strength of the thorned and arrow dragon species can be doubled!”

Wang Xian mumbled to himself!

A doubling of strength was a little exaggerated!

The abyssal seeds were nurturing the battle with battle, and the Dragon Palace’s nurturing battle with battle was even more terrifying!

After the group of Dragon Palace members entered the Dragon Transformation Pool, Wang Xian stayed in the Dragon Palace for the next few days!

Ten days later, Ao Yao, Mu Zesen, and the rest had a breakthrough in their strength!

And this time, other than them advancing to level 8 immortal king, the Heavenly Eye Arrow Division and strange demon had also added five level 7 immortal king powerhouses each!

As for the rest of the increase, there were originally 1,000 immortal king powerhouses in Dragon Peak, but now there were 5,000 of them!

After all, there were too many abyss seeds this time!

“The Dragon Palace should be stronger than the Bei Chuan Sect Now!”

Wang Xian mumbled as a smile appeared on his face!

“Come, Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian led the members of the Dragon Palace to the Demon Island immediately!

“Dragon King, Miss bei Shuang came a day ago. She wanted to go with you to a planet of last month’s great sect to participate in an exchange meeting. Since you weren’t around, she left an invitation letter here!”

When Wang Xian arrived at the Dragon Peak, Tian Cheng handed him an invitation letter and said to him!

“Oh? Exchange meeting? What Exchange Meeting?”

Wang Xian took the invitation letter and raised his eyebrows slightly!

“I heard from Miss bei Shuang that it’s an exchange meeting. Right now, this place is facing the threat of the Abyss.”Last month, the great sect of last month held an exchange meeting during the war. Every powerhouse of every faction had a lot of treasures that could be bartered, they could also trade abyss seed crystals!”

Heaven’s formation said to Wang Xian!

“We can go and take a look!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows!

The great sect organized a trade fair last month. Naturally, there were many powerhouses who went there. Now that they were facing a threat, some people might take out their treasures in exchange for an increase in their strength!

Wang Xian now had a lot of treasures in his hands. Even if it was exchanged for abyss seed crystals, it wouldn’t be too bad!

“Invite the Moon Planet!”

Wang Xian looked at the address of the invitation letter and opened his AI to search!

“Sky Array, do you want to make a trip there?”

He looked at the sky array and asked!

“Alright!”

The sky array nodded and the two of them flew towards the invite planet together!

Invite the moon planet was located at the center of thousands of planets in the Northern line. It was also the most prosperous planet in the Northern line!

When Wang Xian and the rest flew over, they could see that there were many people on the planet!

There were only a few people on the planets in the Northern line. There were no fewer people here!

According to the address, Wang Xian arrived at a huge square!

He swept his gaze over and saw at least a million people around him. Some of them even placed some treasures on the ground!

Some of them clearly wanted to exchange for the abyssal seed crystals, while others wanted to barter with them!

...

There were a few million people around, and most of them were at least at level five of the Eternal Celestial Master!

All kinds of treasure lights illuminated the surroundings. At a glance, it was extremely shocking!

The entire square was like a large-scale treasure field!

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across, and his eyes were sparkling!

This was the first time he had encountered such a huge scene! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

He didn’t know how long this war would last. Everyone wanted to quickly increase their strength!

Only by surviving would they be able to become stronger!

Many people did not hold back and took out their treasures to trade!

However, the outer area was where the ordinary disciples traded. The core of the exchange was a palace in the middle of the square. It was where the god-king level trade took place!

Wang Xian walked towards the center. When they arrived at the entrance, there was an intelligent robot checking them out!

This kind of robot didn’t have any combat capabilities, but those who weren’t qualified to enter would be courting death if they dared to barge in!

...

This was because the number of immortal king level powerhouses inside would be a terrifying number!

Ding

After checking the invitation letter, Wang Xian walked in!

After walking for ten minutes, he saw many small pavilions. There were many people in each pavilion!

With a glance, there were at least 30,000 to 40,000 people!

These were all undying emperor level warriors!

The 4 powers, along with the Warriors from the other planets in the north, along with the great sect from last month, their numbers were terrifying!

These 30,000 to 40,000 people weren’t all of these powers!

Just the Bei Chuan sect alone had close to 10,000 undying emperor level warriors, one could imagine how many warriors gathered here!

“This god weapon is so powerful. Hiss, only A Level 7 undying godly monarch abyss seed crystal can be exchanged for it. It’s worth this price!”

“This exchange for a powerful god weapon, this... This isn’t easy to exchange for!”

“Battle pet, A Level 5 undying godly monarch battle pet. Sigh, it’s a pity that my abyss seed crystal isn’t enough!”

The moment he entered, one voice after another could be heard. There was even a powerful aura of a god weapon within!

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up as he looked around!

There were indeed many treasures around!

“What kind of treasure is this? It can actually enhance the quality of the Divine Kingdom!”

“It’s so powerful. What is this? I’ve never heard of it before. It can heal injuries quickly. This is too powerful. It’s extremely useful to the immortal divine kingdom!”

Wang Xian walked in as he looked around. Suddenly, an exclamation could be heard!
