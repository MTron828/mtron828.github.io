Chapter 316: The Roar of The Devil Monkey

On the Spiritual Island, one Inborn expert from Lei Family, Water Separation Island and Wind God Sect respectively stepped forward and looked at Mo Qinglong, Mo Yuan and Mo Shiwu with contempt.

They walked over slowly with their weapons in their hands, glowing in a chilling light.

“You guys must be courting death!”

Mo Qinglong’s eyes were filled with killing intent as he stared at the three Inborn experts walking towards them. Devilish aura started circling around his body.

Mo Yuan transformed his fingers into claws and stared at the approaching group harshly.

“Hehe! Devilish cultivators! It seems like we are going to eradicate devils for the benefit of the world!”

An old man turned solemn after noticing the dense devilish aura being emitted from their bodies.

“Kill the three of them!” an old man shouted. Subsequently, he jumped ahead and charged towards Mo Qinglong, Mo Yuan and Mo Shiwu.

The three Inborn experts reached Mo Qinglong and the group in an instant. The stifling pressure of an Inborn expert was mixed with their dense killing intent. The three Inborn experts had no plans to hide their aura and killing intent at all.

...

At this moment, Wang Xian, who was on the seabed, did not know about the intense battle that was going on at the Spiritual Island. Wang Xian smiled faintly and looked ahead.

In front of him, a hundred Patrolling Yakshas were pinned down on the floor with grave injuries under the attacks from the Devil Division, nine Venomous Sea Snakes, Roving Lobster, and Roving Girl.

“Surrender to me or die!”

Wang Xian stood on the back of Prime Minister Turtle, shrouded his dragon power towards all the Patrolling Yakshas and spoke coldly.

“I surrender!” The leader of the Patrolling Yakshas looked at Wang Xian and the group in horror. Gradually, he lifted his head.

“Great. This will be the wisest choice you make in your lifetime.”

“The Dragon Palace shall be separated into nine divisions in the future. The Devil Division has since been established. Today, I shall confer on you, leader of Patrolling Yakshas, as the Dragon Guard Division. You shall patrol the four seas and guard the Dragon Palace. I shall also bestow upon you the name of Roving Yaksha!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he waved his hands. Drops of essence blood entered the Patrolling Yakshas’ heads as Wang Xian smiled.

Devil Division was the main battle strength against the enemies. As for the Dragon Guard Division, they would be responsible for patrolling the surroundings of the Dragon Palace and protecting it.

Although there were only a hundred Patrolling Yakshas, the strength and battle prowess they demonstrated when they worked together were incomparably horrifying.

Moreover, they could move extremely fast in the water. Even Wang Xian was astonished at their speed.

In water, they possessed a speed that even the Nine Venomous Sea Snakes couldn’t match.

However, if the Nine Venomous Sea Snakes were above the sea surface, their speed would be a lot faster than it was in the seas.

“Thank you, Dragon King. Greetings, Dragon King!” The leader of the Patrolling Yakshas bowed down in a unique manner as he remarked.

“Greetings, Dragon King!” the surrounding Patrolling Yaksha followed, kneeling down respectfully as they remarked.

“This is the cultivation art for the Water Divine Dragon. Cultivate diligently in the future!”

A thought was sent into their minds. Subsequently, Wang Xian looked at the floating island.

“Eh? Bring me to the bottom of the floating island to take a look!” Wang Xian said to Roving Yaksha immediately.

“Yes, Dragon King!”

After absorbing the essence blood of the divine dragon, a flash of energy beamed from the eyes of the Roving Yaksha. The speed of water flowing on his body became even quicker.

“Dragon King, this is our old nest. We have been living under this island!”

After arriving at the side of the island, the Roving Yaksha pointed to the bottom of the island.

Wang Xian looked across inquisitively. The base of the floating island wasn’t connected to the seabed. Moreover, a type of plant was growing on the bottom of the island.

This plant was black in color, similar to the color of the Patrolling Yakshas. They were densely packed and covered the entire bottom of the floating island.

Moreover, this type of plant wasn’t just a layer. Instead, there were several layers of them which formed empty spaces each layer.

Wang Xian was surprised to see a one-meter-tall Yaksha moving within these spaces. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“This is...?”

“This is our nest and also our food.”

Roving Yaksha swam over, scraped a part of the plant using his weapon-like arm and handed it to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian received it and realized it had strong buoyancy!

“So this plant is the reason why the island floats and can even move!”

Wang Xian was in awe of the mysterious things of the seas. There were all kinds of strange animals in the sea.

“If I convert this island to my accommodation, wouldn’t it be...!”

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up. He just had to modify this floating island a little to convert it to a mobile base. In fact, he could even pull this floating island to the Bohai Sea.

If he wished to go to other areas, he could also shift it to the Pacific Ocean or the Indian Ocean.

A mobile fortress and base!

Wang Xian’s eyes burned with enthusiasm. “You guys, wait for me here. I’m going to take a look at the Spiritual Island!”

After finishing his words, Wang Xian moved and swam towards the Spiritual Island.

As the ruins of an ancient sect, there should be lots of treasures on it. Moreover, he had informed Mo Qinglong and the group to search for treasures while he was under the water.

Wang Xian believed they would have obtained lots of spiritual treasures by now.

“The rewards this time are indeed handsome!”

Wang Xian revealed a faint smile and arrived on the Spiritual Island.

Rumble!

“Tsk! How dare you guys injure our Lei Family’s people! Trying to grab these spiritual medicines and spiritual treasures with just the three of you? You guys must be courting death!”

However, he heard a furious roar that propagated through the entire Spiritual Island the moment he landed on shore.

After which, the sounds of collision erupted. Wang Xian squinted his eyes and his expression turned cold.

“Cough cough. All of you shall die!” A weak voice sounded. It was the voice of Mo Qinglong.

“Haha! Kill us? We will kill you right now!” A brazen voice sounded once again. “Still thinking of getting the treasures? Wishful thinking! Even if you were a Pinnacle Inborn expert, we would still kill you!”

“It seems like someone can’t wait to die!” Murderous intent gleamed in Wang Xian’s eyes. Based on what Mo Shiwu had said, all treasures found should be obtained through their respective strengths.

This was the agreement for the split of treasures on the Spiritual Island.

In Wang Xian’s opinion, no one in the three Forces would be a match for Mo Qinglong or Mo Yuan.

Based on the voice of Mo Qinglong, he was clearly injured now. In that case, there was only one possibility. A group of people had attacked them together.

Rumble!

Wang Xian tapped lightly on the water surface. Roving Heavens immediately raised his head above the surface.

“Follow me!”

Roving Heavens gave his orders before jumping onto the shore of the Spiritual Island.

Below him, eight hundred devil monkeys followed closely behind. They were like savage beasts from the bottom of the water as they surfaced from the seas. Every single one of them had an intense devilish flame emitting from their body.

Roar!

Roving Heavens walked beside Wang Xian and let out a cry.

With his six-meter tall figure, he was a towering figure beside Wang Xian. He held a golden rod in his hand.

Behind him, eight hundred devil monkeys jumped onto the shores of the Spiritual Island. The horrifying auras from them masked the moon in the sky.

“Let’s go!”

Wang Xian stood up gradually. The group of devil monkeys spread out before charging forward rapidly with Wang Xian.

Grr grr grr!

As the devil monkeys growled, the entire Spiritual Island trembled!
