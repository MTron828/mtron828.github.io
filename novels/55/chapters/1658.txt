Chapter 1659: 1659, Huo Luo'er made her move

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

A group of more than 1,000 people were led by two young men dressed in black.

The two of them held a huge hammer in their hands, and their faces were filled with wanton smiles.

The group of people flew directly to the side of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop, proudly glancing at everyone from the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan and the Holy Fire clan across from them.

“Who are they?”

“They are from the nine God Empire. They are from the nine God Empire’s demon god Tribe!”

“Hiss, why are the people from the Demon God tribe here? What are they trying to do?”

“Could it be that the demon God tribe is helping the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop?”

Looking at the more than a thousand people who were filled with an invincible aura and arrogance, everyone from the Fire Cloud Sparrow’s side had a huge change in expression.

Even the Sacred Fire clan’s people had solemn expressions on their faces.

Why did the nine God Empire’s demon God tribe suddenly participate in this war?

What did they mean by this?

“Haha, a Fourth Level Void Interpretation Fellow. which disciple of our demon God tribe killed him!”

The 1,000-plus people’s gazes swept across the surroundings.

The black-clothed youth with long hair who stood at the front laughed loudly as he looked at Lie Hanling and shouted loudly.

“Senior brother, leave the fourth level of the Profound Void to me!”

A youth standing at the front moved and directly flew towards Lie Hanling.

He also held a huge black hammer in his hand as a violent aura was instantly unleashed.

From the moment he came up to the moment he attacked, it had only been two seconds. He did not hesitate at all and was extremely domineering.

“Two young masters of the Moyuan clan, you came quite quickly!”

Shui Lianhun looked at the two youths leading the Devil God tribe and greeted them with a smile.

“Haha, since I Have Nothing to do, I came early!”

The two youths from the Devil God tribe laughed and said indifferently.

“Devil Yuan general, Devil Yuan Bei, will the sacred fire tribe be handed over to you?”

Lie Hanshan looked at the two and asked with a trace of fear in his eyes.

“The sacred flame tribe will be handed over to us. We from the demon God tribe want to see how powerful the disciples of the founding general of the Phoenix Dynasty are. Hehe!”

A strong battle intent was revealed from General Mo Yuan’s body.

“With the strength of the two brothers, the sacred flame tribe is probably not your match!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Lie Hanshan smiled and looked at the position opposite him.

“Oh no, the life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop actually invited people from the demon god Tribe!”

“General Mo Yuan, Mo Yuan bei, two of the top five disciples of the Demon God tribe!”

Tens of thousands of people from the fire cloud sparrow tribe came to watch. When they saw the people from the demon God tribe, their faces were filled with embarrassment and solemnity.

Now that they were here, it meant that they would help the two big battles to fight against them.

These were people from the demon God tribe of the nine gods. They were a terrifying force that was not weaker than the sacred fire tribe. They were even more powerful than the sacred fire tribe.

To a certain extent, they even represented the nine God Empire.

This was because the nine gods were united.

“I never expected the two major factions to invite the demon God tribe. Next, the Fire Cloud Sparrow tribe will be in even more trouble. If they invite the tribe leader of the Demon God tribe to act, the Fire Cloud Sparrow tribe might be exterminated!”

Everyone from the sacred fire tribe had ugly expressions.

The two major factions might be afraid of the sacred fire tribe, but the nine God Empire’s demonic God tribe would definitely not be afraid of them.

“I never expected our patriarch to invite the experts of the demonic god Tribe!”

“Is the demonic God tribe going to join the battlefield to help us kill the Fire Cloud Sparrow Tribe?”

“Haha, if they can invite helpers, our life and Death Pill Workshop and holy item forging workshop can also invite helpers!”

“The experts of the demonic God tribe are able to deal with the Sacred Fire clan, and we will be able to crush the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan once again!”

Compared to the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan, who had an ugly and solemn expression, the disciples of the life and Death Pill Workshop and holy item forging workshop had excited expressions on their faces.

With the help of the demonic God tribe, it was only a matter of time before they annihilated the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan.

“Disciples of the Sacred Fire clan, come out and face your death!”

At this moment, more than ten disciples of the demonic God tribe flew out and stared at the sacred fire tribe members with battle intent.

“Compete with the disciples of the Demonic God tribe!”

An elder of the sacred fire tribe standing at the front frowned and said indifferently.

“It’s an elder!”

Some disciples of the sacred fire tribe immediately nodded and went up to welcome him.

“Ah!”

At this moment, a scream came from the front of the arena.

Everyone looked over.

“Oh no, our elite disciple of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan has been killed!”

“Hiss, that guy from the sacred item forging workshop actually has a full set of insightful void tier equipment, and his weapon is even higher than his own realm!”

“Haha, Good Kill. The beasts of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan will be killed one by one. Lie Qing is awesome!”

An embarrassed voice came from the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan, while the other side cheered excitedly.

“Haha, Trash of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan, come on, let’s continue. Who Wants to fight me, Jiang Xingkong!”

In front of the holy item forging workshop, a burly young man stepped forward and stared at Xu Xingcan, obviously indicating his opinion.

“I’ll do it!”

Xu Xingcan stepped forward, exuding an indomitable aura.

“Hehehe, it’s my turn now, the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan seems to be empty!”

Xu Xingcan rushed forward, the life and Death Pill Workshop’s Shui Lianhun walked forward with a face full of smiles.

“Haha, the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan is empty, no one is a match for our Miss Shui Lianhun!”

“Fire Cloud Sparrow clan’s trash, our Miss Shui Lianhun makes a move, do you dare to have anyone fight against us!”

“We’ve killed quite a few of the Fire Cloud Sparrow’s Heaven’s favorites. There’s almost none left, Haha!”

The people from the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop mocked loudly.

The Fire Cloud Sparrow clan’s people looked at Shui Lianhun, who was walking forward, and when they heard their mockery, their expressions became somewhat unsightly.

Some of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan’s people looked in the direction of the Sacred Fire clan, asking their people to make a move!

“Let me!”

Lie Hanshan stared at Shui Lianhun and said coldly.

“Lie Hanshan of the Sacred Fire clan, right? I told you, Your Sacred Fire clan will be taken over by our demonic God tribe!”

Mo Yuan locked his gaze on lie Hanshan and said coldly.

This caused lie Hanshan, fire skylark, and the others’expressions to change slightly.

“Hehe, don’t tell me that your fire Skylark clan has no one under a hundred years old? If one isn’t enough, then you can have a few more!”

Shui Lianhun stood in the air and stared provocatively at everyone in the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan.

“Below a hundred years old, there are only two fifth level void interpretation cultivators, young master Xu Xingcan and young master Huo Mingtu. They are being harassed by Jiang Xingkong and Shui Lianyi, this...”

The Fire Cloud Sparrow clan members looked at each other, their expressions ugly.

In terms of overall strength, they were slightly weaker than the two great factions.

“I want to kill you!”

At this moment, Huo Luo'er’s figure moved, directly flying forward.

“What?”

“Princess, you can’t!”

“Princess, you’re not her match!”
