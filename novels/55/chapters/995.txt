Chapter 996: At the 0997 banquet

Translator: 5496903

In the next few days, Wang Xian made a trip to the Demon Hunter Academy. After he handed in a level five extraordinary thunder fruit as a mission, the one-star Gold-grade mission was considered to be completed.

As for the other thunder fruits, they were consumed by Wang Xian to upgrade the level six extraordinary demon.

It could also be considered to make up for the lack of level eight extraordinary combat strength.

After a period of improvement, Wang Xian, who had a fortune of billions, became poor again.

In the past few days, Wang Xian did not go to the academy after a day of lessons. With his strength, he would not be able to learn anything in there.

Three to four days passed in a row. In the past two days, there was a rather sensational news on the demon Hunter Academy’s Forum.

“Yun Hanhai has yet to return to Thunder Island with young master’s mercenary group!”

“Yun Hanhai and the members of young master’s mercenary group are currently unable to contact any information!”

The two pieces of news started to spread two days ago, and at the beginning, not many people paid attention to it.

Going out to do anything and not returning, it was normal for them to be unable to contact each other.

However, two days had passed, and these two pieces of news gradually caused many people to guess.

Some people even said that the members of the young master’s mercenary group were currently asking the mercenary group that went to the Thunder Island for a mission if they had seen Yun Hanhai and the rest.

The moment this news was released, it caused many people to be shocked.

“Yun Hanhai and the young master’s mercenary group went to the Thunder Island to kill the new student, Wang Xian. I heard from Wang Xian’s classmates that he has already returned. Why hasn’t Yun Hanhai and the rest returned yet?”

“I saw the members of the Yun family heading to the young master’s mercenary group yesterday. Could it be that something has really happened to Yun Hanhai?”

“Could this matter be related to Wang Xian? Yun Hanhai and the rest went to kill Wang Xian. Now that Wang Xian is fine, they have disappeared!”

Everyone in the Demon Hunters Academy was discussing in astonishment.

However, following that, many people dismissed this idea.

“With the strength of that freshman Wang Xian, even if Yun Hanhai were to stand there and let him fight, he wouldn’t be able to kill him with the equipment on his body!”

“That’s right. I heard that the young master’s mercenary group sent three level six extraordinary experts and a group of level five extraordinary experts. It’s impossible for this freshman to kill them!”

“When they went to the Thunder Island, all the experts from the amethyst mercenary group were injured and returned. Could it be that the young master’s mercenary group also met with misfortune?”

“It’s very possible. Even deputy leader Xiao was injured badly. I heard that they almost didn’t make it back. Yun Hanhai and the rest might really have met with an accident.”

The discussion in the Demon Hunters Academy’s Forum was ongoing. However, no one linked the death of the young master’s mercenary group to Wang Xian.

“Phew, looks like the death of Yun Hanhai and the rest won’t make people think that it was Wang Xian who did it!”

At this moment, in the base of the amethyst mercenary group of the Demon Hunters Academy, a group of core members of amethyst were sitting in a room.

Deputy Captain Xiao looked at the message on the forum and heaved a sigh of relief.

“Even if the young master’s mercenary group knows that it was Wang Xian who did it, they won’t be able to do anything to him with his strength.”

A Girl said with a twinkle in her eyes.

“The young master’s mercenary group might not be able to do anything, but the Yun family will not let him off. Wang Xian is very strong, but he is not a match for the Yun Family!”

A female student beside him said.

The rest of them nodded.

When deputy leader Xiao and the rest came back to tell them about the incident, no one dared to believe it.

A freshman killed a group of level six supernatural beasts and Yun Hanhai and the rest in an instant when he was severely injured. How strong could he be?

He was at least at level 7 transcendent!

There wasn’t a single level 7 transcendent among the students of the Demon Hunter College.

They couldn’t believe what they heard.

Their commander Feng Yun, one of the top three experts in the college, was still far from level 7 transcendent.

“Yuan Yuan, since he saved you, he is the benefactor of our amethyst mercenary group. If we can help him, we will!”

Sitting in the center was a tall girl.

She was at least 1.9 meters tall and wore black armor. One could vaguely see her perfect figure.

She had golden eyes, golden hair, and a wild aura around her.

She was the leader of the amethyst mercenary group, Zhang Yitian, who had the bloodline of the winged demonic beast.

She sat there and muttered to herself, “Invite him to the banquet tomorrow afternoon!”

“Oh? Leader Jin, invite him? The other leaders mentioned that they wanted to talk about the mission in the Dragon Wind Region!”

Xiao Yuanyuan said in surprise, “Leader, do you mean to bring him along?”

“Yes, he is very strong. We, Amethyst, owe him a favor. Let’s repay him!”

Zhang Yitian said with a frown. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Alright!”

Xiao Yuanyuan nodded and looked to the side. “Qin Qing, go and send the invitation to Wang Xian!”

“Me?”

Qin Qing was stunned and stood up.

“Yes, Wang Xian has saved you twice. It’s better to build a closer relationship with such a strong person. You Can Go!”

Xiao Yuanyuan said to Qin Qing with a smile.

“It’s the vice-leader!”

Qin Qing hesitated for a moment before nodding her head.

...

In a house beside the demon Hunters Academy, Wang Xian had rested for four to five days. He had completely recovered and was about to continue looking for missions to carry out when he saw Ao jian attracting a girl from outside. He was stunned.

“Oh? Is There Something Wrong?”

Wang Xian looked at Qin Qing and asked with some doubt.

“Commander Wang, I’m here to give you an invitation card. Our commander asked me to give it to you!”

Qin Qing walked to Wang Xian’s side helplessly and handed him an invitation card.

He took it in surprise.

“Our commander said that there will be a hiring mission for this banquet. If commander Wang is interested, you can come and take a look!”

Qin Qing didn’t dare to look at him,

in the past, Wang Xian had crippled her brother’s limbs. She had thought that when she became stronger, she would seek revenge for her brother. Now... She had no such thoughts at all.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian took a look and nodded at her.

“Also... I... I apologize on behalf of my brother. He’s young and reckless.”

Qin Qing lowered her head and apologized.

“It’s alright. I didn’t take it to heart.”

Wang Xian shook his head.

“I’ll be leaving first then!”

After Qin Qing finished speaking, she immediately ran out.

Wang Xian took a look and smiled faintly. This girl was really kind-hearted.

“The banquet, the elite mercenary group banquet of the Demon Hunters Academy!”

Wang Xian looked at the name of the invitation card and his eyes flickered. “It’s not a mission. To think that the amethyst mercenary group would take it so seriously. Let’s go and take a look!”

He thought to himself and didn’t plan to go out to look for missions.

The next evening, Wang Xian walked out wearing simple clothes.

This time, the Demon Hunters Academy’s elite mercenary group banquet could be said to be a gathering of the elite students of the Demon Hunters Academy.

The banquet was held in a mountain villa behind the demon Hunters Academy.

The mountain villa was called the Demon Hunters Mountain Villa. It was a large-scale gathering place!
