Chapter 4092 - 4092: 4091 attacked with all its might

Translator: 549690339

The three chaos helminth beasts saw Wang Xian and the rest attacking them.

Sensing the terrifying might, they didn’t dare to gather together.

When they gathered together, they would suffer even more attacks!

They let out a wild roar and flew straight to the back.

The Chaos Helminth beast that was targeted by Wang Xian and the rest also flew back in an attempt to escape.

Although they didn’t have much intelligence, they knew how to avoid danger.

Faced with the attacks of Wang Xian and the rest, the three chaos helminth knew that they were no longer their match.

If they were not careful, they might even die!

This caused the three chaos helminth to flee into the distance with all their might!

Wang Xian’s body trembled. The nine-origin dragon realm completely enveloped him!

The Unicorn Ox charged towards the chaotic worm beast. Wang Xian also enveloped it within. A powerful energy landed on the Unicorn Ox’s body, causing his speed to increase by a lot.

Wang Xian flapped his primaless saint wings and flew over quickly as well!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

“Roar! Roar! Roar! ”

Within his nine-origin domain, the shadows of Divine Dragons appeared one after another.

The entire space was completely sealed by Wang Xian!

The Linniu flew to the front of the Chaos Helminth Beast and lifted its claws.

Its entire claw grew longer, resembling a blood-red bone blade!

On its body, the unique symbols seemed to have come alive.

The symbols flew out and transformed into a terrifying demonic beast, biting at the Chaos Helminth Beast!

When the Chaos Helminth saw the unicorn ox fighting it at close range, it let out a wild roar and charged forward.

It opened its mouth and rows of sharp teeth could be seen on it.

These sharp teeth contained a terrifying aura.

The Unicorn Ox was not afraid at all. Its strength was not weaker than the chaos helminth!

At this moment, Wang Xian waved his arm and the five elements Millstone flew out.

There was no need for him to hide the five elements millstone in the 9-ORIGIN domain!

After the five elements Millstone flew out, it spun and headed straight for the Chaos Helminth!

On top of the five elements millstone, all kinds of weapons shot out.

Each weapon contained a powerful destructive force!

Wang Xian extended his dragon claws and attacked as well!

All of them were close combat attacks!

When the chaos helminth saw the continuous attacks, its eyes revealed a look of fear!

Its body shook violently as streams of earth elemental energy wrapped around its entire body!

When Wang Xian and the five elements millstone saw it defending itself, they went to three different positions and surrounded it!

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom

Boom! Boom! Boom

All kinds of attacks attacked the chaos helminth!

Bang! Bang! Bang

The defense around the chaos helminth was crumbling rapidly.

It could not withstand the combined attacks of Wang Xian and the rest!

The Unicorn Ox charged forward directly. The horn on its head began to grow bigger and longer. It grew to the size of 10,000 meters and pierced towards its body!

The chaos helminth quickly defended itself!

However, Wang Xian and the five elements Millstone were attacking the chaos helminth directly from the side!

On the Five Elements Millstone, the five divine dragons merged together and condensed into a dragon claw that attacked the Chaos Helminth!

The top of Wang Xian’s Head was towering. The dragon horn emitted a radiance and landed on the book of forbidden water spells.

A terrifying stream of water fell from the book of forbidden water spells.

The stream of water pierced through the chaos helminth!

The chaos helminth couldn’t Dodge the attack that was launched at the same time!

“Roar Roar Roar! ”

Following that, it let out a blood-curdling scream.

Fresh blood oozed out from the Chaos Helminth’s body.

Its fresh blood was an earthy yellow liquid that contained pure earth elemental energy!

“Roar Roar Roar! ”

“Dong Dong Dong! ”

It let out a roar from its mouth and a rumbling sound came from its body. It was as though an earthquake had erupted!

In the surrounding area, Wang Xian’s 9-origin domain started to tremble violently.

The surrounding space also started to tremble violently!

“Five-element Annihilation Disc! ”

Wang Xian saw this attack from the chaos helminth and channeled his energy into the five-element millstone!

The five-element millstone started to spin and rose directly above the Chaos Helminth!

Waves of crushing energy started to revolve continuously.

Five-element revolve, five-element annihilation disc!

The five elements annihilated disc resisted the attack of the Chaos Helminth.

Wang Xian, who was at the side, slowly opened his dragon mouth. A wave of energy was brewing in his mouth!

“Boom!”

A nine-colored torrent attacked the chaos helminth!

At the side, the special symbols on the body of the unicorn ox emitted a glow. His incomparably thick scales began to change.

Bone spikes extended out from his body.

Each of the blood-red bone spikes was a thousand meters in size.

This made the Linniu look like a devil!

The bone spikes on the Linniu’s body shot out from his body and headed straight for the Chaos Helminth!

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

The sound of penetration was heard once again!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The chaos Helminth’s screams continued.

Faced with the siege of Wang Xian and the others, this chaos helminth did not have the strength to resist!

With what?

Wang Xian one-on-one with this chaos helminth beast to fight a draw, coupled with the case of Lin Niu and five elements grinding, is completely crushed.

One-sided battle!

Just like Agatha Devil at that time, can resist the attack of two of the same level, but against three simply can not resist.

Even if they were able to withstand the attacks for a short period of time, it would be at the expense of their lives!

This chaos helminth didn’t have as many tricks as the Asgardians.

It would be even more difficult to escape and resist!

A special blood gushed out from the body of the chaos helminth. It was filled with fear as it roared crazily!

Streams of blood transformed into attacks. They condensed into earth spikes and attacked Wang Xian and the rest!

“Be careful! ”

Wang Xian reminded them. His body trembled and he moved to his side. The accompanying elf spirit appeared beside him.

At the moment, the accompanying Elf Spirit and the Ghost Avatar did not improve with him. Hence, they possessed the combat strength of the Heaven’s origin blessed realm.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The reason was that they did not have enough energy and Wang Xian’s realm was not high enough!

The reason why Wang Xian was able to possess the ghost avatar was largely due to the ancestral tree.

The ancestral tree supported a portion of the Ghost Avatar’s energy.

Now that the ancestral tree had not reached the Tianyuan blessed realm, how could the ghost avatar possess the strength of the Tianyuan blessed realm?

Similarly, the accompanying elf spirit was the same.

They relied on Wang Xian, but they also relied on the ancestral tree!

However, the current spirit spirit was still of great use to Wang Xian.

The Netherspirit clone would not be able to do it!

When the Spirit Spirit appeared, the book of water curse immediately landed in her hands..
