Chapter 639: Manta Ray And The Pure Blood Coral

“Are you done with your chores?”

When Wang Xian returned to the beach, Xiao Yu and the girls were still eating. Seeing Wang Xian approaching, they questioned him with smiles.

“Yeah. I have to head to the disordered region tomorrow. You girls can remain here and enjoy yourselves!” Wang Xian sat down and spoke to them with a smile.

“Alright, Xiao Xian. If there’s anything you require our help with, you can just inform us. We aren’t weak at all right now!” Lan Qingyue replied to Wang Xian with a smile.

“Alright, alright. But I really don’t need your help at this moment!” Wang Xian chuckled.

The girls were indeed not weak at the moment. Xiao Yu, Elder Fang, and Sun Lingxiu would be able to reach the Budding Realm soon.

As for Lan Qingyue, she had reached the Budding Realm some time ago. The first Kun she bred, Xiao Lan, had also reached Level 12.

The Budding Realm Xiao Lan had reached a size of over seventy meters. On Earth, it was definitely a terrifyingly huge creature.

Moreover, based on what Lan Qingyue had told him, Xiao Lan would be able to reach Level 13 within half a year.

When Xiao Lan reached Level 13, its size could reach two hundred meters. Moreover, it would be able to fly in the sky. Its strength would definitely rank among the pinnacle among those in the same realm.

Wang Xian accompanied them till 12 AM before the group headed back to the hotel.

On the next day, Wang Xian led the group of dragonians and steered towards the disordered region.

As compared to other areas, the disordered region looked a little gloomier.

It was especially so for the areas under the sea. Other areas might have seawater that was blue in color. However, the disordered region was much darker and had terrifying vibes being emitted from the bottom of the sea.

Roving Sword, Roving Heavens and the rest are a few hundred miles ahead of us!

Wang Xian stood on the yacht and sensed the surroundings. He retrieved the map and instructed, “Head towards the disordered island straight ahead!”

“Yes, Dragon King!”

Mo Qinglong nodded his head, steered the yacht and moved towards the central location.

Around them, several black mountain peaks extended out from the bottom of the sea. The peaks were rugged and looked extremely sharp.

The further he proceeded, the more peaks he noticed that were extending out of the waters.

One should note that the sea below them could reach a depth of over three thousand meters. In other words, these protruding peaks were at least three thousand meters tall.

The deeper he moved, the more peaks he saw.

In this place, it was impossible for large ships to move through. A mistake would result in the sinking of the entire ship.

The greyish mist made the day resemble the night.

The sun resembled the moon as it emitted dim light.

Bam!

“Be careful!”

Suddenly, Wang Xian felt a terrifying aura from the bottom of the sea. He was astonished and shouted to remind the group.

Boom!

At this moment, followed by a huge explosion, the front of the yacht exploded. A creepy creature extended its wings and charged towards them.

[Manta Ray: Level 10]

[Extractable Dragon Energy: 112,342]

“It’s an Inborn-level marine creature!”

Seeing the Manta Ray charging towards him, Wang Xian was astonished.

This Level 10 Manta Ray was roughly six to seven meters in size. Its entire body was pitch-black and emitted dense devilish aura.

It resembled a bat and had two fluid wings. At the edge of each wing was a razor-sharp bone spike.

The Manta Ray had a horrifying mouthpart and teeth that resembled a fork that was protruding out of its mouth. It also had a black tail that was roughly three meters long.

The Manta Ray jumped out of the water surface and charged towards them at a terrifying speed by flying.

“You must be courting death!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

A cold light flashed in the eyes of Mo Qinglong. He pulled back his arm and transformed his arm into a terrifying dragon claw before swinging it towards the Manta Ray!

Ji ji ji ji ji!

The Manta Ray cried out pitifully as it was caught!

“Huh? What a strong skeletal structure.”

Mo Qinglong was surprised. Flexing his arm, the Manta Ray was killed on the spot.

Swish swish swish!

At this moment, more than a dozen additional Manta Rays flew out of the sea. They extended both of their wings and used their razor-sharp mouthparts and tails to attack Wang Xian and the dragonians.

Wang Xian waved his arm and the Manta Rays flew towards him.

Bam! Bam! Bam!

The dozen-odd Manta Rays were killed right away and were put into Wang Xian’s space ring.

“The disordered region is indeed something. While steering on the sea, we can even encounter terrifying marine creatures flying out from the sea. This area isn’t a place where the weak could survive!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he stared into the water below him.

Wherever there were strong marine creatures, they would likely have spiritual items around.

Wang Xian leaped into the sky and dove right into the water.

Huh? Level 11 Manta Ray!

Just as he dived into the water, Wang Xian saw a Level 11 Manta Ray right away. Its body was roughly ten meters long and was emitting terrifying vibes.

It flapped its wings while releasing streams of devilish aura.

At this juncture, that Manta Ray was staring in the direction directly below him.

It’s not surprising now that the sea appears so dark. There are probably a large number of Manta Rays within the disordered region!

Wang Xian reached forward and the water before him seemed to be held in his palms.

Rumble!

Water swords appeared out of thin air and shot towards the Level 11 Manta Ray.

With Wang Xian’s current ability to manipulate water energy, killing creatures that were weaker than him was like a walk in the park.

After putting the corpse of the Manta Ray into his space ring, Wang Xian dived deeper in.

There was an underwater mountain below him. The mountain wasn’t very tall and Wang Xian saw a tuft of spiritual grass that emitted a blood-red glow in the middle of the mountain.

Wang Xian squinted his eyes, dived down and appeared beside it in an instant.

Pure blood coral! This is a tuft of pure blood coral!

Wang Xian observed it in shock.

This wasn’t an ordinary coral or ordinary spiritual grass.

The bottom of this pure blood coral was connected to various terrifying roots. There were countless mouthparts densely packed on these roots, making it look exceptionally grotesque. It had its own life.

The pure blood coral was located in the middle of its eleven roots’ extension and was emitting vast energy.

“Is this the pure blood coral? It feeds on the fresh blood of living creatures to form the pure blood corals while the living creatures can also greatly enhance their strength by devouring it. Tempt and be tempted!”

Wang Xian mumbled to himself. He waved his hands and a stream of water grabbed towards the pure blood coral.

Swish swish swish!

Those roots’ extensions with revolting mouthparts instantly surrounded the pure blood coral.

Wang Xian waved his arm and five spiritual swords appeared around his hand before slashing those roots’ extensions.

Pfft pfft!

Wang Xian severed the roots’ extension and plucked out the pure blood coral with his hand. Dense energy was emitted in the instant.

[Pure blood coral: Level 6]

[Extractable Dragon Energy: 18,621]

“It’s still alive!”

Holding the pure blood coral in his hand, Wang Xian was astonished to find it still alive. Those roots extensions of the blood coral were still alive.

Gradually, it grew palm-size roots.

“This is...? If we don’t remove the roots completely, it will continue to grow longer, hunt for living creatures to form new pure blood coral, and grow stronger!”

“This is truly magical!”

Wang Xian was slightly impressed. Given some time, it would be able to form another pure blood coral with immense energy.

“In that case, there will definitely be lots of pure blood corals in this place. This is indeed a treasure ground. The contests of marine animals are just like the contests between humans!”
