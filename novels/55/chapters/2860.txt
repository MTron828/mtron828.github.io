“Oh No, oh no, we’re doomed!”

“How did we meet the Celestial Emperor of the eight barrens? Damn it, damn it!”

When he saw the wind prison surrounding them, invincible battle technique revealed an anxious expression.

The celestial emperor of the eight barrens. Once they were captured, no one could save Wang Xian.

Even if his master came personally, he wouldn’t be able to save Wang Xian.

!!

“Not good!”

The faces of Ye Lui Ying and the rest turned pale instantly. They looked around uneasily.

“Sir Celestial Emperor, can we make a deal? I can owe you a favor!”

Hong Fengyan clenched her fists slightly and said to the Celestial Emperor of the eight Barrens in the sky.

“Oh?”

The Celestial Emperor of the eight Barrens looked at Hong Fengyan with a hint of surprise in his eyes.

He then looked to the side. When he saw the corpse there, he raised his brows slightly.

Combining the words of their eight desolation disciples, he narrowed his eyes slightly.

“Who killed him?”

He asked coldly.

“Lord Feng, it’s that young man. It’s that young man who killed our eight desolation disciples. That shangshui God Emperor’s disciple has invincible battle techniques. There’s also a protector from the holy region who wants to protect him!”

“That protector of the sacred region is already half a step into the god Emperor Realm!”

The protector of the eight desolates, who was holding a horsetail whisk, immediately reported to him.

“God Emperor Wind destruction is here. I didn’t expect that the god Emperor of the eight desolates would rush over at this time!”

“They won’t be able to escape this time. That young man is probably going to be killed.”

“Not necessarily. That protector of the sacred region is willing to owe a favor to protect that young man. After all, that protector of the sacred region is about to become a god Emperor. A favor from a god Emperor is very valuable!”

“I wonder how the Celestial Emperor of wind destruction will deal with him!”

When the guardian of bhang reported, the surrounding people were also discussing in astonishment.

It involved the final disciple of the Celestial Emperor of Shangshui, whose combat techniques were invincible. It also involved the protector of the Holy Feather, an existence who had one foot in the celestial emperor realm.

However, now that the Celestial Emperor of wind destruction had arrived, the outcome of the matter was likely to be decided.

“It’s definitely him!”

The god-emperor of wind destruction narrowed his eyes slightly as his gaze landed on Wang Xian.

He was now certain that this figure was the one who flew out from the depths of the windless forest valley.

However, what surprised him was that this young man looked a little weak.

“Lord God-emperor of wind destruction, please see if you can spare my boss Wang on account of my master. Don’t worry, I will definitely make my master compensate with treasures!”

Invincible battle technique looked at God Emperor of Heaven’s destruction and said respectfully.

He didn’t dare to be arrogant in front of the god Emperor!

“Alright, no matter what, you have to pay the price for killing our disciples. We don’t need the favor of the future God Emperor of eight barrens, nor do we need the treasures of God Emperor Shangshui!”

“Hand him over now. If you are protecting him, I don’t care if you are the protectors of the holy region or the disciples of the god Emperor, just kill him!”

The God Emperor of Heaven Destruction Glanced at Hong Fengyan and invincible battle technique before his gaze landed on Wang Xian.

Normally, he would hesitate when faced with such a condition.

However, he had chased after them from the depths of the windless forest valley for this figure.

How could he let him go?

Even if he didn’t kill the disciples of bhang, he would still capture them.

“Damn it!”

Upon hearing the words of the god of wind destruction, invincible couldn’t help but curse. He looked extremely embarrassed.

Hong Fengyan’s expression also changed slightly.

“I will hold them back later. You should escape first. I have already broken the confinement circle for you!”

She transmitted her voice to Wang Xian.

Now, she couldn’t help but feel a little regretful. If she had known earlier, she would have ordered Wang Xian to return to her divine kingdom. This wouldn’t have resulted in the current situation.

She had been careless. She thought that with her current strength, she would be able to bring him away.

However, she didn’t expect a celestial emperor to appear.

When Wang Xian heard her voice transmission, he couldn’t help but smile. He took a few steps forward, swept across everyone in the surroundings, and landed on the body of the Celestial Emperor of wind destruction.

“You…”

Hong Fengyan, who was at the side, was slightly stunned. She reached out her hand to pull him.

However, she was unable to stop him before she fell into a trance. This caused her to be slightly taken aback.

“My body is injured. Initially, I didn’t want to make a move.”

Wang Xian stared at the god-destroying wind emperor and said faintly.

Indeed, he didn’t want to make a move. With his current injuries, it would take a month for him to fully recover. If he continued to make a move, he might need to rest for a year.

A year was a very long time for him.

Therefore, he had been watching and did not say anything. If he could leave today, he would have to make a trip to the eight barrens after heavenly array eight qi and the others came. From the looks of it, if heavenly array eight qi and the others did not come, he would have no choice but to take action.

However, if he took action, it would not be so easy.

However, he saw the greed in wind destruction god Emperor’s eyes. He saw that he was determined to obtain it. This made him slightly curious.

He didn’t seem to know this guy!

“Huh?”

“What’s wrong with that young man? Why is he so calm? Is there something wrong with his brain? is he talking to the god-destroying wind emperor?”

“The injuries on his body seem to be from fighting with the disciples of the eight desolates. Did he hurt his brain?”

The crowd was stunned when they saw Wang Xian walking forward. They were discussing in astonishment.

God-emperor of wind destruction was also slightly stunned. He stared at Wang Xian in confusion.

“Those who killed our disciples are our enemies. If all of you are standing there, I will kill all of you as well!”

God-emperor of wind destruction sensed Wang Xian’s aura. He looked at Hong Fengyan and the battle technique that he could not see.

He was still a little apprehensive about Hong Fengyan, who was about to advance to the level of god-emperor, and the last disciple of god-emperor of Shangshui.

But that was all. If the other party was not good, he would kill him today.

What could the other party do to him?

An unconcealed killing intent spread out in the surroundings.

Sensing this killing intent, Hong Fengyan and the others’faces changed, turning slightly pale.

“Big Brother Invincible, come over quickly. Come over, Big Brother Invincible!”

Everyone in the surroundings could clearly sense the killing intent of celestial thearch wind destruction.

The two young men behind Tian Xin shouted at invincible battle technique anxiously.

“Invincible, don’t try to be strong!”

Tian Xin also shouted at invincible battle technique with an anxious expression.

“F * CK, is invincible battle technique the kind of person who is afraid of Death?”

Invincible battle technique looked at Tian Xin and the rest with bloodshot eyes. He raised his head and said. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

His words made Tian Xin and the rest turn pale.

“Wang Xian, are you prepared to…”

Hong Fengyan also opened her mouth and wanted him to escape later. However, before she could say anything, Wang Xian waved his hand to stop her.

“I would like to see the strength of the eight Desolation Celestial Emperor.”

“At the same time, I also want to tell you that you guys are in trouble!”

Wang Xian’s gaze landed on the Celestial Emperor of wind destruction. His eyes were cold.

When the Celestial Emperor of wind destruction saw Wang Xian staring at him without any fear, he frowned slightly.

He felt uncertain when he thought of Wang Xian flying out from the depths of the windless forest valley.

“Hehe, then let me see your ability.”

The divine emperor of wind destruction was astonished and said coldly. He did not dare to attack rashly!
