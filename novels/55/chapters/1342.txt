Chapter 1343: 1343 destruction of a nation 4

“Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Wang Xian, the leader of the Dragon Palace!”

“I have been away from the Dragon Palace for a year. I didn’t expect so many things to happen in a year’s time. Next, I want to talk to you about the deep sea spiritual spring and the congratulatory gifts!”

Wang Xian stood there and glanced at the crown prince, Princess Yi Ye, and the rest with a calm expression.

The 500 to 600 members of the Dragon Palace stood behind Wang Xian and stared coldly at the people from the Heaven Island Empire and the one leaf continent empire.

“What is the Dragon Palace trying to do? What are you trying to do on the day of the engagement between the Crown Prince and the Princess? Are you looking for death? Scram back to your seats!”

The old man at the side saw that everyone from the Dragon Palace had stood up and stood behind Wang Xian. When he heard his words, his expression changed slightly and he shouted with a cold gaze.

“Eh?”

“Eh? What’s wrong? What happened over there?”

“That’s the people from the Dragon Palace. What are they trying to do?”

As crown prince Jiang and Princess Yi Ye came over to toast, many people were paying attention to this place.

When they saw the situation over here, everyone looked over. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“This... why are all the people from the Dragon Palace standing together? Are they trying to cause trouble? A bunch of D * MN Fellows!”

“What are they trying to do? Are they tired of living?”

The cold voices continued to ring out. The customers around them slowly stood up with cold expressions in their eyes.

Those present were basically all the family forces in the Sky Island dynasty. An external force dared to cause trouble at the engagement ceremony between the Crown Prince and the Princess of the one leaf continent dynasty.

This was an offense to all the forces of the Sky Island dynasty.

“Eh? What happened over there?”

On the stage in front, the old man of the one leaf continent dynasty looked over and frowned slightly.

“Nothing should happen!”

The king of the Sky Island dynasty raised his eyebrows, glanced over and shook his head faintly.

He understood the power of the Dragon Palace. Back then, the fact that the Sky Island Empire was able to seize the deep sea spiritual spring was enough to tell that there was a huge gap between them and the Sky Island Empire.

It was even worse than the other two demonic beast races.

If they weren’t worried that they would leak the information about the deep sea spiritual spring, the Dragon Palace wouldn’t even be able to get 10% of the spiritual stones.

The elder from the Ye continent empire nodded his head faintly.

“Are you courting death?”

Wang Xian heard the arrogant threat from the old man and revealed a smile. “So, I wanted to talk to you guys properly. Since you guys insist on talking after the death of someone!”

“Then, I shall fulfill your wish!”

As he spoke, he pointed with his arm. A ball containing the destructive aura of the five elements instantly attacked the old man.

“What? You actually dare to attack!”

Wang Xian didn’t make his move very quickly, so everyone could see it clearly.

Everyone around was slightly shocked. Even Prince Jiang and Princess Yi Ye were also stunned.

This fellow actually dared to make a move at their engagement venue?

Who gave them the courage?

“You’re courting death!”

The old man’s expression changed slightly. He waved his arm and a scepter instantly appeared in his hand, blocking the attack in front of him.

However, when the old man’s shield was formed, the destructive power of the five elements directly landed on the shield formed by him.

“Bang!”

At the moment of contact, a terrifying explosion immediately erupted.

“What!”

The old man’s expression changed instantly. His pupils constricted slightly and his face was filled with fear.

“Bang!”

The explosion did not have a large area. However, this dull explosion was something that no one had expected!

“Ah!”

At this moment, a terrified roar came from princess one leaf. She looked at the wine cup in her hand in horror.

There was a piece of flesh there.

She felt that her face was a little sticky.

Flesh and blood. The old man’s body completely exploded.

At her engagement banquet with Crown Prince Jiang, it was filled with blood!

“What? !”

“Protect the Emperor!”

Everyone was completely stunned.

The young man from the Dragon Palace suddenly attacked, and the Heavenly Island Dynasty’s elder at the first rank of the insightful void realm whose body was directly blown to pieces.

There was bloody flesh everywhere, and the tens of thousands of people around were shocked.

“Kill them!”

“How dare you! How dare you!”

The experts of the Heavenly Island dynasty instantly appeared in front of Crown Prince Jiang and princess one leaf, and their eyes were filled with killing intent.

“Boom!”

At the center of the reception, the King of the Sky Island Empire instantly stood up, his terrifying aura directly soaring into the sky.

His expression was incomparably gloomy. He had just told the one leaf continent empire that nothing would happen.

In the end, in an instant, an expert of the Sky Island Empire was directly killed, and princess one leaf was even frightened.

A slap to the face, a blatant slap to the face.

An old man from the Ye Continent Empire standing by the side also instantly stood up, his expression slightly awkward.

“Elder one leaf king, I will give you an explanation for this matter!”

His face was filled with dense killing intent as he spoke coldly, slowly walking down the field.

With every step he took, the killing intent on his body became more serious.

The elder from the one leaf continent empire had a dark expression as he looked at the Sky Island King, standing on the spot and looking down at the front.

“Now, can we talk about the deep sea spiritual spring and the congratulatory gifts?”

Wang Xian looked at the tens of thousands of people from the Sky Island dynasty surrounding them. The dozens of insightful emptiness realm experts in front were staring at them with murderous intent. There was still a faint smile on their faces.

“Deep sea spiritual spring? Today is Prince Jiang’s Big Day. Trash from the Dragon Palace, I think you all want to die. Since you dare to make a move, i, the water electric eel clan, will destroy you on behalf of the Sky Island Dynasty!”

At this time, before the people of the Sky Island dynasty could make a move, the leader of the Water Electric Eel Demon Beast clan on the left side of the Dragon Palace moved. He swayed his huge body and flew to the front of the Dragon Palace in an instant.

He spat out a blood-red tongue. Lightning surrounded his body, and his ferocious face looked abnormally terrifying.

When his strength reached a certain level, there would be people who would make a move to curry favor with him without the help of the Sky Island dynasty.

This was the case for the leader of the electric eel tribe.

“Anyone who dares to offend the Sky Island Empire will die!”

The lightning on its body exploded. A bolt of lightning that was three meters thick charged straight at Wang Xian.

“Since you want to die before it’s your turn, I shall grant your wish!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were extremely cold when he saw the leader of the electric eel charging at him. With a wave of his arm, a gray energy that covered an area of 1,000 meters swept over.

Buzz

The Lightning was covered by the gray energy and disappeared instantly. It was filled with the energy of death and destruction as it charged towards the leader of the electric water eel.

“Not good!”

The expression of the leader of the electric water eel changed drastically. He opened his ferocious mouth and bolts of lightning struck out.

Every scale on his body was flashing with lightning, forming a lightning prison around him.
