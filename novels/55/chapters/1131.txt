Chapter 1132: 1133 floating sea city was opened

Translator: 5496903

Feng Luan and Wang Xian, who were cultivating, opened their eyes and looked at the door.

A pool of liquid was slowly flowing into the room.

Feng Luan looked at Wang Xian. Wang Xian nodded his head slowly and a name appeared in his mind.

Undercurrent!

Undercurrent assassin organization.

“It’s actually an extraordinary level nine assassin!”

When Shui Liu entered the room, Wang Xian revealed a look of astonishment.

According to the rumors, the undercurrent assassin organization could only assassinate people at level nine of the supernatural realm. Now, they were sending top-notch assassins to kill him?

His eyes flickered slightly as he looked to his left and right.

At this moment, in the room on the left, a young man was sitting cross-legged on the bed. Beside him was a devilish blue mask. He was looking over with a smile on his face.

“It seems like this guy is part of the undercurrent assassin organization. Furthermore, it is very likely that he is the descendant of the master of Undercurrent!”

Wang Xian looked over and was deep in thought.

He sat cross-legged and did not move. Feng Luan also slowly closed her eyes and ignored him.

Feng Luan did not think much of an extraordinary level nine assassin.

Moreover, the first target of this assassin was Wang Xian.

“An assassin who dared to assassinate me?”

Wang Xian was slightly mocking. He felt an energy attacking him. The terrifying penetrating force was so strong that even if he was hit, he would still be injured.

“PFFT!”

However, when the assassin with his calm eyes came to Wang Xian’s surroundings, an invisible dagger attacked him instantly.

The sound of penetration was heard, but the killer revealed a look of despair. He looked at his chest in disbelief.

A ball of dark energy blocked his mouth, and he couldn’t make any sound.

“Undercurrent assassin organization...”

Wang Xian looked at the killer who was in disbelief. A faint smile appeared on his face.

Boom! Boom! Boom

At this moment, a terrifying trembling sound was heard, causing Wang Xian to be slightly stunned.

Feng Luan immediately stood up and looked at Wang Xian. “The sound from floating sea city should be the sound of void interpretation experts breaking the formation forcefully. There are at least three to four second level void interpretation experts!”

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and said directly.

Feng Luan nodded. Without any hesitation, she opened the window and jumped out.

“I’ll let you live a little longer!”

Wang Xian looked at the room next to him and quickly flew toward the floating sea city.

“What’s going on?”

“It’s the sound from the floating sea city. Someone is breaking the formation!”

“Let’s go, let’s go quickly. If we can enter, there might be the inheritance of a void interpretation stage expert!”

“It might even be the lair of a demonic beast race!”

At dawn, the terrifying attack that came from the seashore caused the entire bright moon city to tremble. Some of the martial artists hurriedly flew towards the seashore.

At this moment, no one cared about the rules that forbade flying in the city! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“It’s an expert from the royal family of star-moon Kingdom!”

“Star-moon dove, it’s a demonic beast, star-moon dove, The Guardian Demonic Beast of the royal family of star-moon Kingdom!”

Wang Xian and Feng Luan quickly flew towards floating sea city. Cries of surprise could be heard from the surroundings.

In the sky, two star-moon doves, which were about ten meters in size, flapped their wings. They were exceptionally eye-catching in the sky.

Half-step void interpretation demonic beast, star-moon dove.

On top of the star-moon doves stood a group of people. On top of the star-moon doves stood four void interpretation experts, including the city lord of Bright Moon City.

The star-moon Dynasty sent four insightful emptiness realm experts.

In addition to the four from the star-moon dynasty, an elder from the Heavenly Moon sect was also close to the four from the star-moon kingdom.

In addition, the Wind Howl Kingdom had one level three insightful emptiness realm expert and one level two insightful emptiness realm expert.

At this moment, this group of insightful emptiness realm experts were working together to attack the array formation.

Breaking the array formation with force.

At the back, there were at least 10,000 warriors, including half-step insightful emptiness realm experts and level nine transcendents. There were quite a number of such rare experts.

“At most, we will have to attack more than 10 times before the formation will be broken!”

Feng Luan watched as more and more buildings appeared. Her gaze was slightly focused.

“They are obviously united. In a while, without a team of void interpretation powerhouses, it will be impossible to enter!”

Wang Xian glanced at Feng Luan and said softly.

“No, everyone can enter. The outermost part of this floating sea city is an illusion formation. Below the illusion formation is a killing formation. This floating sea city is not that simple. There will be dangers inside!”

Feng Luan’s eyes sparkled.

“Are you saying that we need someone to scout the way?”

Wang Xian looked at her.

“Yes, the killing formation inside is not complete. Clearly, there are a lot of problems due to the long duration. However, the more it is like this, the more it will reflect the danger of the floating sea city. It might even threaten the life of an insightful emptiness realm expert!”

Feng Luan nodded her head. “There’s no need to rush. We can just follow the crowd in!”

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. His divine ability, the light and darkness formation, could ignore the formation. However, this did not mean that he could ignore the elemental attacks of the formation.

However, he would not activate the formation. Without anyone controlling it, even if he were to barge in, he would not be in any danger.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The terrifying attacks landed on the formation one after another, causing everyone around to reveal horrified expressions.

“This time, the Kingdom of howling wind has really crossed the line!”

On the body of a star Moon Dove, a young man dressed in yellow clothes with his head slightly raised looked at the group of experts at the profound void tier and frowned slightly.

“Third prince, the Kingdom of Howling Wind has been getting restless in recent years, and their hands have been stretched out very long!”

An elder beside him said respectfully.

“Hmph, now that Father’s strength has broken through, he really thinks that we, starry moon, are afraid of them!”

The young man snorted coldly. Standing on the body of a half-step void interpretation demonic beast, he looked down at everyone below, the corners of his mouth slightly mocking.

“A bunch of chess pieces.”

He said indifferently, his gaze turning towards the huge floating sea city that was gradually exposed, his eyes burning with passion.

“This should be the Hundred Beast City of that Beast Tamer from three hundred years ago. If I can obtain the inheritance of the Hundred Patrol Beast Tamer Senior...”

As he spoke, his eyes burned with passion.

“Boom!”

At this moment, a loud explosion sounded from the front.

Everyone looked over, their eyes filled with excitement.

The sky started to shatter like glass. Everyone’s eyes widened as they stared intently inside.

“What is this?”

“What dense spiritual energy. The spiritual energy here is almost double that of the outside world!”

“Hundred Beast City, look at that huge inscription over there!”

Tens of thousands of people in the surroundings looked over and shouted in shock.

“Charge, charge, we’ll charge over immediately. The first one to charge over will definitely reap more rewards!”

“Isn’t Hundred Beast City the Lair of the Hundred Patrol Beast Tamer who is a sixth level profound void martial artist? Could it be...”

When the formation was completely broken, a primitive floating sea city with a circumference of 10 kilometers appeared in their sight.
