“To send such a terrifying force just for his own sister, it really is...”

Inside the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect, Ling Xiao’s gaze swept across the group of powerful forces, and he was slightly shocked. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He looked at the young girl lying on the bed and thought of Ao Jian and the name Ao Yao creature.

The eldest princess!

In ancient times, only the emperor’s sister was called the eldest princess.

Obviously, the Dragon King was their king.

Between Immortals and gods, even a lower immortal would not be so respectful to a higher immortal.

Not to mention that an immortal would treat a girl who had not reached the level of an immortal.

To address the eldest princess respectfully, one could imagine the position of the girl in the Dragon King’s heart.

One had to know that his own son, the infant realm experts of the sect, would not normally address him as the crown prince, but directly address Ling Tian!

This was because this was the dignity of the strong. Unless his son stepped into the immortal realm, only then could he be addressed as the crown prince!

One could imagine how much the Dragon King doted on his sister.

“Sect leader, the assassination team has been formed. Ten infant realm experts and fifty dan realm experts are waiting outside the door!”

Elder Feng came to the medicine peak and swept his gaze across the group of Drakonids at the door with a face full of surprise. His gaze was directed at their sect master, Ling Xiao.

“Yes!”

Ling Xiao nodded slightly and slowly walked out of the door.

“Trash!”

At the side, Ao Jian and Mo Qinglong heard what elder fan had said to them.

Ao jian coldly looked at Feng Lingtian, who was not far away, and snorted coldly.

Feng Lingtian heard Ao Jian’s words and looked a little embarrassed. He lowered his head.

“Okay, okay. Ao Jian, don’t talk about him. It’s already good enough that he can bring me out!”

Xiao Yu, who was at the side, had recovered a lot after taking a large number of pills. When she heard Ao Jian’s words and looked at Feng Lingtian’s face, she hurriedly said.

“It’s the eldest princess. The Dragon King said that I’ll protect you in the future!”

Ao jian nodded and said to Xiao Yu.

“No need, no need. Forget it. I’ll tell my brother!”

Xiao Yu waved her hand when she heard that Ao Jian was going to protect her.

She knew what it meant to be an immortal-level powerhouse. To ask him to protect her was simply...

However, Xiao Yu was very happy with her brother’s love for her. No matter what danger she encountered, her brother would always be there.

“Princess, let’s go and take care of some matters!”

Mo Qinglong, who had just contacted Wang Xian, walked over and said respectfully to Xiao Yu.

“Okay, Go!”

Xiao Yu nodded and looked at Feng Lingtian.

“Hey, little slave, is there something wrong with your brain?”

Seeing that he was motionless, Xiao Yu could not help but shout.

“No, my brain is very normal!”

Feng Lingtian looked at Ao Jian’s figure and said, “I’m thinking, when will I have the strength of your brother? With this kind of power, I can protect you in the future instead of you protecting me!”

Xiao Yu was stunned for a moment before a smile appeared on his face. “Don’t compare yourself with my brother. My brother can not be compared to anyone else. You are not bad yourself. A heaven’s favored son, a demon prince, you are much more powerful than many other heaven’s favored sons!”

Feng Lingtian was slightly bitter. “If I don’t compare myself to your brother, even you can not be compared to him!”

“I am different from you. You should have noticed something as well, so don’t compare yourself to me. Don’t compare yourself to my brother. Just be a good little slave from now on. Don’t think too much!”

Xiao Yu said with a smile.

Her brother and her brother had turned her into a divine dragon.

Xiao Yu knew that their starting point had already far surpassed that of ordinary people. Even if Feng Lingtian was as strong as the number one heaven’s favorite of yellow cauldron and the evildoer crown prince, he was still a human and could not be compared to them.

“I don’t want to be a little slave!”

Feng Lingtian said with an embarrassed expression.

“What? You still want to be the Master?”

Xiao Yu rolled her eyes at him and waved her hand. “Let’s retire, little slave. I’m too tired. I want to rest for a while!”

Feng Lingtian looked at Xiao Yu, who had her eyes closed, in a daze.

Seeing her eyelashes flutter slightly, a hint of bitterness appeared on her face again.

“The Immortal sect will provide you with all the information. This time, experts above the Dan stage are the targets of our assassination. We will kill anyone we see!”

“However, don’t be careless. Since the Hunyuan Immortal sect dares to declare war against us, they will definitely have a backup plan, especially since the supreme elder of the Hunyuan Immortal sect has already broken through to the middle-level immortal realm. According to the agreement of the Yellow Cauldron three immortal sects, the Heaven and earth will belong to them!”

“This assassination will last for a very long time. Everyone, get ready!”

At the entrance, Ling Xiao ordered the group of immortal sect disciples in front of him with a dark expression.

The Hunyuan Immortal sect dared to attack his son. As an immortal God, Ling Xiao would naturally retaliate. Otherwise, it would be a waste to be an immortal god.

Regardless of whether or not the other party’s strength had increased significantly, they had to pay a heavy price for this assassination.

Ling Xiao was already prepared to fight for a long time!

“Sect leader Ling, does the agreement between the immortals and gods mean that immortal-level experts are not allowed to make a move?”

At this moment, Mo Qinglong and Ao Jian walked out from the side and looked at Ling Xiao. Mo Qinglong asked.

“HMM?”

Ling Xiao Glanced at AO Jian and knew what they meant.

With the Dragon King’s love for his sister, he might really dare to make immortal-level experts make a move.

“It’s best if the immortal-level experts don’t fight, even if you haven’t signed the immortal-level agreement!”

Ling Xiao looked at Ao Jian, he slowly reminded, “The immortal-level experts are not allowed to fight in the immortal-level agreement. If the immortal-level experts have grudges, they can be resolved in two ways. One is a disciple battle. Each immortal sect will choose some disciples to fight to the death!”

“The other method is a battle between the immortals and gods. Apply to all the immortals and gods. Under the agreement of both parties, a life-and-death battle will be held in a desert or an ocean

“As for the rest, when someone attacks an immortal God, the immortal God can directly kill the attacker

“When someone barges into the immortal sect, the immortal God can attack without any scruples

“If the immortals do not attack because of the above conditions, they will be punished by all the immortals and killed!”

Ao Jian and Mo Qinglong nodded slowly, their eyes shining.

“In that case!”

Mo Qinglong glanced at the members of the Dragon Gate in front of him. “Block the gate of the Primordial Immortal Gate. Kill every single one of them who comes out!”

“I still have five subordinates on my side. Let them enter the interior of the Primordial Immortal Gate and assassinate them!”

Just as Mo Qinglong finished speaking, Strange Demon’s voice came from the void.

“Alright. Since the immortals and deities can not attack, then we will not attack!”

Ao jian nodded with a cold gaze. “Mo Qinglong will lead all the Dragonmen to block their immortal gate!”

“Strange Demon will enter and assassinate them!”

“They dared to hurt our eldest princess. Let them know what fear is and what despair is!”

Block the gate of immortality, assassinate!
