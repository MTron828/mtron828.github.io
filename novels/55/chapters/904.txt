Chapter 905: 0906 poor kid?

Translator: 549690339

At the center of Holy Sea Town, in front of the three largest pill and weapon workshops, a dense crowd gathered.

Life and Death Pill Workshop!

Holy Item Forging Workshop!

Immortal Phoenix Pill and Weapon Workshop!

The three top forces, these three pill and weapon workshops, occupied 50-60% of the continent’s pill and weapon.

50-60% was already a very terrifying number, almost a monopoly. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

It was the same in Saint Sea Town. The other small pill and weapon workshops were living in the cracks between them.

The Immortal Phoenix pill and weapon workshop had risen in the past two years. Its rise was extremely terrifying, and it quickly took over the entire star-moon kingdom.

It sold both pills and weapons. It was obvious that the Immortal Phoenix pill and weapon workshop would offend the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Pill Workshop!

Today, this situation was clearly targeted by the two great factions.

The surrounding people were discussing this scene in hushed tones.

Shopkeeper Liu stood there with an extremely ugly expression. The employees of the Phoenix Elixir and weapons workshop walked out one by one and watched this scene with indignation.

The two major forces were targeting each other. The number one mercenary group in the Holy Sea, the Knife Scar mercenary group, and the number four mercenary group in the Holy Sea, The Mirage Sea mercenary group.

With the help of the two major mercenary groups, the Phoenix Elixir and weapons workshop was helpless in such a situation.

At this moment, Wang Xian, who was standing in the shop, was watching this scene with a twinkle in his eyes.

“It seems that the shop set up by Feng Luan has been targeted!”

Wang Xian was deep in thought as he looked at the leader of the Sword Scar and Mirage Sea mercenary groups.

One of them was at level seven and the other was at level six of the supernatural realm. Furthermore, they had four to five hundred people in their mercenary groups.

They were definitely a big force.

“Since we have bumped into each other, let’s Help!”

Wang Xian was full of smiles as he looked at the stunned crowd. He shouted with a smile, “Everyone from Fengxian, are you still doing business? Buy some elixirs!”

His voice suddenly rang across the entire street, causing everyone around to be slightly stunned.

Especially Shopkeeper Dao Hen Qing and the rest. When they heard this voice, they immediately looked towards Wang Xian’s location.

“This young man?”

An old man opened his mouth in astonishment. “What is this young man doing? Buying things at this time? Is He that stupid?”

“What an idiot. After what happened to him, Dao Hen even shouted. How dare he buy things at this time!”

“That’s true. There are more and more brainless people nowadays. Do you guys Think Dao Hen will make an example out of this kid?”

“It’s hard to say. However, judging from the clothes on this kid’s body, the most he can buy is a level one extraordinary elixir!”

Everyone’s gaze was focused on Wang Xian as they discussed in a low voice.

Even manager Liu, who was at the side, was stunned. However, at this moment, there were still people who dared to come to their shop to buy things. Even if it was the cheapest elixir, they would still sell it.

“Go and receive this little brother!”

Manager Liu said to a salesperson with a sullen face.

“I didn’t expect to meet a brainless guy!”

Dao Hen’s face turned sullen when he saw that Wang Xian still dared to buy things at the Fengxian Elixir and weapons workshop after hearing his words.

“Haha, so be it. Look, only a stupid guy would buy things at Fengxian. Those with a little bit of intelligence wouldn’t buy them!”

However, shopkeeper Qing, who was standing at the side, didn’t get angry. Instead, she said with a loud laugh.

“I hope that the others won’t be as stupid as this little guy!”

As she said that, she swept her gaze across everyone gathered around her with a face full of smiles. Finally, her gaze fell on shopkeeper Liu once again.

“Shopkeeper Liu, why aren’t you going over to serve the customer in your shop? Who knows, the other party might buy a transcendent tier one medicinal pill!”

A mocking voice rang out in the surroundings, causing shopkeeper LIU’s expression to change drastically.

“Haha, shopkeeper Liu, hurry up and go. If your service isn’t good enough, that foolish brat might not be buying medicinal pills from you anymore. Haha!”

Beside him, the shopkeeper of the holy item forging workshop was also laughing out loud as he mocked.

“In the future, with the life and Death Medicinal Pill workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop targeting us, Feng Xian is finished!”

“Sigh, there are many things in Feng Xian that are cheaper than the two of them. However...”

“With the presence of Dao Hen and the mirage sea mercenary group, who would still dare to go to Feng Xian to buy things? Only those foolish brats would dare to go there. Even if they were to buy, they would probably only buy transcendent-level rank-1 medicinal pills. They might not even be at the transcendent-level!”

The people around were discussing softly.

Foolish Kid?

At most, he would buy elixirs of level one extraordinaire?

Wang Xian was standing at the entrance. When he heard their sarcasm, a hint of disdain flashed across his eyes.

He swept his gaze across the surroundings and the corner of his mouth curled up slightly. “Manager Liu, I want to buy a large number of elixirs. Please come over and we can have a discussion!”

“Huh?”

Wang Xian suddenly spoke again, causing manager Liu’s expression to change. He was a little surprised and in disbelief.

“Haha, shopkeeper Liu, hurry up and go. Maybe the other party wants to buy two extraordinary first level pills?”

At this moment, shopkeeper Qing’s teasing voice came from the side.

Everyone around felt that it was funny. They suspected that this young man was someone that the life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop had deliberately found and humiliated them.

Manager Liu had also thought of this. His face was so gloomy that blood almost dripped from it.

However, as a manager, if he didn’t go over, he would definitely become a weakness for the other party.

Wang Xian saw everyone’s mockery of manager Liu and revealed a faint smile on his face.

He moved his arm.

Crash

In an instant, middle-grade spirit stones landed at the entrance of Feng Xian’s interspatial ring.

The crisp and melodious sound caused everyone to be slightly stunned.

“This...”

Everyone looked over and their eyes widened. Their eyes were filled with disbelief.

Spirit Stones, middle-grade spirit stones, piles and piles of middle-grade spirit stones were released from the interspatial ring!

“Hualala!”

The sound was still not over. Slowly, spirit stones that were three meters tall, five meters long, and two meters thick were piled up like a wall.

The middle-grade spirit stones were pure and emitted spiritual energy. Under the sunlight, they emitted a seven-colored glow.

“I want to buy elixirs. I want to buy elixirs that cost eight million middle-grade spirit stones!”

Wang Xian said to manager Liu with a smile on his face.

Manager Liu’s eyes were wide open. He was completely stunned.

The surrounding manager Dao Hen Qing and the people from the holy item forging workshop were also stunned.

“Hiss... this, this...”

Everyone around also widened their eyes and sucked in a breath of cold air. Their faces were filled with shock as they looked at the pile of middle-grade spirit stones that formed a wall.

Eight million, this was eight million middle-grade spirit stones!

The corpse of a transcendent rank 6 demonic beast was worth between five hundred thousand to eight hundred thousand.

The corpse of a demonic beast could be refined into medicine and weapons. Its value was several times higher than transcendent rank 6 medicinal pills and weapons.

However, these eight million mid-grade spirit stones could buy the corpses of more than ten transcendent tier 6 demonic beasts.

They could buy fifty to sixty transcendent tier 6 pills and weapons.

Fifty to sixty pills? What kind of concept was that?
