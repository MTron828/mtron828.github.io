3421 3420 broke through

“Attack! All disciples, attack immediately! Destroy their defenses!”

A loud roar rang out in front of the main hall of the Lightning race, followed by a series of terrifying attacks brewing in the sky.

“Defense!”

Within the defense, all the powerful disciples of the Lightning race channeled their energy into the formation, adding a powerful defense to the defensive formation.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

A terrifying collision sound rang out.

In the sky, the black cloud started to move rapidly. At a terrifying speed, it was like a pitch-black ocean wave, crashing directly towards the Lightning Race’s defensive formation.

“Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!”

The Lightning Race’s defensive formation began to shake violently, causing ripples to appear.

Fortunately, the Lightning Race’s defensive formation was able to withstand it.

This blessed land had been managed by the Lightning race for nearly ten billion years. It had been reinforced with the foundation of the Blessed Land.

It would not be easy to destroy it.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The black cloud did not give up. Waves of attacks landed on the defense of the Lightning race.

The entire defense formation trembled violently. However, that line of defense was not broken.

“As long as it can withstand it!”

At the same time, in the palace where Wang Xian was staying, he muttered to himself as he looked at the scene in front of the main hall through the formation in front of him.

This formation was installed by the Thunder Ray tribe. It was also convenient for him to understand the specific situation.

After seeing that there were no major problems, he continued to absorb resources. Very soon, he was about to break through.

“We can’t break through!”

In front of the main hall of the Lightning race, the principal of the Great Thunderclap School and the others had ugly expressions on their faces when they saw the terrifying attacks of the black cloud.

“We can only suppress them completely now. Take out the treasures that are suppressing them.”

The principal of the great thunderclap school immediately ordered.

In the sky, the Black Cloud had launched more than a dozen attacks consecutively. Knowing that he wouldn’t be able to break through this defense, he gave up and returned to the rear.

He floated in the air, emitting a terrifying aura.

“Wanting to break through our Thunder Light Race’s defense is just wishful thinking. When we come out, it will be the day that our thunder light race will take full revenge. It will be the beginning of your disaster!”

The Thunder Light Race’s clan leader roared with a face full of killing intent.

“HMPH, you can never come out. You will be suppressed here forever!”

The city lord of Liuyan City roared coldly.

“Suppress!”

“Set up the water of Death Domain!”

“Seal off the surroundings!”

Orders sounded one after another, followed by pale white water of death domain being released and surging into the surroundings.

One after another, treasures of suppression were placed into the water of death domain.

The water of death domain was just like its name, able to create a death domain.

One could not sense any attributes within the water, only the power of one’s physical body.

The water of death domain was exceptionally difficult to cut through, and many suppression sects used it.

Naturally, one would need to rely on other treasures.

Even if the Great Thunder Sound College did not know any arrays, they were still able to completely suppress the Thunder light race and the others here.

Even if the outside world wanted to destroy it, it would be extremely difficult.

Of course, there was a limit. A Level 1 universe ruler could still destroy them if they wanted to.

All sorts of suppressive items were scattered in the surrounding areas, and the suppressive methods started to be laid out.

At the same time, the news of the Thunder light race being suppressed spread out from the universe AI.

“The Great Thunderclap Academy and the other four great powers have invited a Level 1 universe ruler to help them. The Thunder Light race doesn’t dare to accept the challenge, they are already being suppressed!”

“The Great Thunderclap School has still lost. Facing a universe ruler level great being, even eldest senior brother is useless!”

“What a pity. In the end, the Great Thunderclap School’s power and foundation are stronger. After all, with the four great powers working together, the Thunder Light race will be completely defeated this time!”

“I don’t know if eldest senior brother of the Thunder Light Race has gone into hiding or has been suppressed. What a pity!”

“Hahaha, that’s great. The Lightning race is arrogant. With the four of us joining hands, we can easily suppress them. So what if it’s the big senior brother of the Lightning Race? In the future, there will be no lightning race in the world!”

On the AI, the powerful disciples of the four forces were commenting.

The disciples and citizens of the four forces naturally cheered.

From now on, there would probably be no lightning race. As for whether they could escape in the future?

The probability was too low!

The Thunder Ray tribe and the rest were completely silent.

Time passed day by day, and the suppression was still going on.

That black cloud did not leave. According to the agreement in the contract, he could only leave after the thunder ray tribe was completely suppressed.

The suppression could not be completed in a day or two. It needed at least a month’s time.

When the time was up, Wang Xian’s dragon energy was increasing at a crazy rate.

Boom

On this day, in the palace where Wang Xian was staying, a terrifying aura was surging towards the surroundings.

“Ding! Congratulations to host for upgrading to level-four Universe Knight and comprehending the law of Dharma Aspect: Mighty Heavenly Dragon!”

The system’s voice rang out. In the middle of the palace, Wang Xian’s dragon body was emitting a dazzling nine-colored luster!

“Roar!”

Wang Xian could not help but let out a low roar. His powerful roar shook the heavens and earth.

The entire sky changed color!

He had broken through!

A level four universe knight could kill a level one universe dominator if he fought against a level seven universe knight.

Now that he had stepped into the level of a universe dominator, he had already stepped into the ranks of the top experts in the universe.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Wang Xian let out an excited roar once again. The thunderclouds around him condensed into the form of a divine dragon.

“I’ve made a breakthrough. This is the perfect time to get rid of the trouble on the side of the Thunder Ray race.”

Wang Xian smiled faintly and transformed into his human form.

“HMM?”

At the same time, at the main hall of the Thunder Ray race, the Dean of the Great Thunderclap Academy and all the other strong disciples were setting up a suppression technique.

They suddenly felt an energy coming from the right that made their hearts palpitate.

“Send someone to check it out!”

The Black Cloud moved slightly and the voice came.

“Could it be that the experts of the Thunder Ray race are causing trouble? Let’s go check it out immediately.”

The two forefathers of the great thunderclap academy frowned and jumped directly onto the body of the Thunder Lion.

“Roar Roar!”

The Thunder Lion galloped and immediately went to investigate!
