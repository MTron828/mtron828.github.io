Chapter 182: My Broadsword Is...

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Wang Xian expressed that his big D... was thirsty.

While admiring the beauty of Guan Shuqing, he had an idea in mind, and thoughts started flowing.

“Shuqing, let’s go and swim in the sea. The weather today is the best and most comfortable for it!” Wang Xian said with a smile to Guan Shuqing.

“Sure,” Guan Shuqing replied happily. However, her expression soon changed to helplessness as she continued, “I forgot to bring my swimsuit.”

“I have some here. I asked Xiao Yu to buy for you when she was buying one. Come over,” Wang Xian replied with a righteous smile. He then brought Guan Shuqing to the changing room.

The swimsuits were definitely not bought by Xiao Yu.

As an upright man, the swimsuits Wang Xian gave Guan Shuqing were all bikinis. Hehe.

“This...” Guan Shuqing was shocked as she replied and her face quickly turned red from embarrassment.

“What happened?” Wang Xian asked innocently.

“This...The swimsuit is too revealing. Why is it all...” Guan Shuqing blushed as she asked while pointing to the wardrobe.

“Oh? That’s true. This sister of mine! Why did she get swimsuits like these? What if others see my gorgeous Shuqing in these? That will be bad! However, don’t worry about that. There aren’t any outsiders here. How about you just wear it now?”

Wang Xian explained while pushing the blame to his younger sister righteously.

There was a flicker in Guan Shuqing’s eyes and the blush spread to her neck. She nodded her head slightly and replied, “Alright!”

She shivered as she took a swimsuit. After which, she said to Wang Xian, “Go out first...”

“Fine, I will go out, I will go out.”

Wang Xian nodded and smiled. He then walked out.

“Wait.”

However, at this moment, Guan Shuqing called out to him.

Wang Xian was stunned for a moment and curiously turned his head around.

He saw Guan Shuqing blushing as her eyes started to flicker. She pouted, stared at Wang Xian and asked, “Will your younger sister get this type of swimsuit?”

Wang Xian looked at the swimsuit Guan Shuqing was holding. The swimsuit was skimpy and even had a hole at the bottom.

He recalled the recommendation the boss gave when he was buying.

Wang Xian’s expression changed drastically as he shouted, “Xiao Yu, I asked you to buy a swimsuit. Look at what you’ve bought. What is this?”

He walked out as he pretended to be angry. On the way, he closed the door!

Bam!

Tsk! Guan Shuqing snorted after she saw through Wang Xian’s act. She then gave a supercilious look as she changed for another swimsuit.

“Big Brother, what are you talking about? Didn’t you choose the swimsuits yesterday?” Xiao Yu asked.

“What? What are you saying Xiao Yu? Why aren’t you training?” Wang Xian retorted.

At this moment, Guan Shuqing overheard the conversation vaguely.

Pft! Guan Shuqing could not hold back her laughter further. She then looked for a swimsuit that looked comparably normal.

“Wow, you’re so gorgeous!” Wang Xian exclaimed.

He was lying below the sunshade umbrella. When he saw her walking over, he went up to her to welcome her.

Tsk! Guan Shuqing rolled her eyes.

She wore a black swimsuit and because the swimsuits Wang Xian bought were only able to cover the important parts, it was exceptionally appealing to the eyes.

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up as he walked over, pretending that the previous events had not happened. He said, “Let’s go and swim in the sea. We can slide down from the slides from the third story. It’s really interesting. Come, let me help you!”

“Ok. Today’s weather looks great!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Guan Shuqing looked up at the sun happily and replied.

“Yes, the weather is great today. The seawater is very clear too. Let me help you,”

Wang Xian replied as he walked over, rubbing his hand. He then extended his arms around Guan Shuqing.

While enjoying the skinship with Guan Shuqing, Wang Xian was really satisfied with his choice of swimsuit. This is great!

“You...”

Guan Shuqing blushed suddenly as she said, “You... Can you just use your hands to help me? You don’t have to hold me by the bottom too!”

Wang Xian was stunned. He looked down immediately and saw his little brother sticking out to help Guan Shuqing. Embarrassment was soon written all over his face.

“I’m in the prime of my youth! Hehe!” he replied while forcing a laugh.

After which, Guan Shuqing kept a distance from Wang Xian. She looked at the slide and sat on it enthusiastically.

Wang Xian followed behind her.

While swimming in the seas, the only shame Wang Xian felt was that Guan Shuqing knew how to swim. Otherwise, it would have been perfect.

After playing in the sea until 5 pm, Wang Xian felt hot all over his body.

“You can just stay over for the night.”

At dinner, Wang Xian regained his serious looks and continued, “We have a lot of rooms here. Why don’t you just stay behind for the night!”

Hmm? Guan Shuqing hesitated.

“There is a family theatre in this villa. Let’s watch some movies tonight,” Wang Xian replied as he saw Guan Shuqing hesitating.

Time to strike the metal while it’s hot, he thought.

“Yes, it’s possible, but...”

Guan Shuqing looked at Wang Xian and hesitated. In the end, she did not say what she was thinking of.

Hehe!

Wang Xian made a big grin.

Xiao Yu was eating her food at the side while looking at her own brother. She felt that her elder brother had changed and had become a pervert.

After dinner, Wang Xian left Guan Shuqing in the living room to rest while also asking Xiao Yu to chat with her.

He immediately rushed to the family theatre and made a call.

“Dahai, Dahai. Hurry up! Send me the seeds!” [1]

Wang Dahai, who had just picked up the call, was bewildered. He was having dinner with his family and questioned, “What seeds are you talking about? Can you be clearer?”

“Japan’s seeds!” Wang Xian exclaimed. His broadsword was already thirsty beyond words. He must succeed tonight!

Suddenly, Dahai noticed silence over the dining table. He lifted his head gradually and saw his parents.

“What nonsense are you spouting? I already have a girlfriend! I have already confessed to Su Qian and she agreed to it.”

Wang Dahai walked towards his room as he replied to Wang Xian.

“What a good brother you have been!” Wang Xian praised.

Wang Xian saw the few seeds that Wang Dahai sent over. He gave a vile smile on his face as he started to meddle with the player.

The family theatre was connected to the Internet. There were a few comfy sofas at the center of the room and they could fit a family.

Wang Xian slotted the files from Wang Dahai behind Detective Chinatown and selected the autoplay function.

Hehehe!

Wang Xian laughed vilely and revealed a satisfied look.

He returned to the living room and talked briefly to Guan Shuqing and Xiao Yu. At around 8 o’clock, Elder Fang pulled Xiao Yu away for training.

“Let’s go Shuqing. Let’s go and watch a movie!” Wang Xian said to Guan Shuqing with a smile.

“Alright. Oh! Which room will I be staying in tonight?” Guan Shuqing asked.

“Just a room on the third story will do. We have plenty of rooms here!” Wang Xian replied with a smile.

“Let’s go!” Guan Shuqing nodded with a smile as she replied. “We should sleep after the movie. Shall we go shopping tomorrow?”

“Sure. No problem! I will get some gifts for you tomorrow. This is also my duty as your boyfriend!” Wang Xian replied.

“You promised!” Guan Shuqing exclaimed.

“Naturally!”

Wang Xian smiled as he brought Guan Shuqing to the family theatre on the third story.

“Let’s watch Detective Chinatown! Have you watched it before?” Wang Xian asked.

“Not yet. Let’s watch this movie. The reviews for it are great!” Guan Shuqing replied.

Hmm.

Wang Xian nodded his head and the two of them sat on the sofa.

He held Guan Shuqing in his embrace lightly throughout the movie.

Guan Shuqing did not push him away and she leaned on Wang Xian. It was warm and romantic.

The movie started soon after and it was a good comedy show. Guan Shuqing was amused by it.

As the movie was ending, Guan Shuqing commented joyously, “This movie is so funny, What a great movie!”

“Yes! It was a great movie!”

Wang Xian replied while squinting his eyes at Guan Shuqing as the movie ended.

“It’s already 10 pm! Time for bed!” Guan Shuqing said shyly when she noticed Wang Xian staring at her.

“Let me hug you for a while longer. Just a while more!” Wang Xian replied softly.

“Alright!” Guan Shuqing nodded and replied. She loved the current atmosphere.

At this moment, a familiar piece of music sounded. On the screen, a shocking movie started playing.
