“Wu Wu!”

Within the surrounding starry skies, a low growl sounded and the little blue house quickly flew towards the horned seal race.

Many people saw the little blue house flying through the starry skies and their faces were filled with shock.

Very quickly, within the surrounding starry skies, a piece of news spread through the universe AI.

Two incomparably huge space beasts appeared in the Western Region.

Some powers had ideas about these two space beasts, and they quickly flew over.

The weaker space beasts all had the power to fight above their level, and it was almost impossible to kill a space beast of the same level.

The stronger space beasts were even able to directly fight dozens of beings of the same level.

Their enormous bodies and terrifying talents made countless races envious.

Many races wanted to suppress and subdue a universe space beast for cultivation.

Among them, the most famous race in the surrounding starry skies was the ancient sea race, a race that had over a hundred space beasts.

The void beasts they had were called the desolate hum beasts.

Once, they used the desolate hum beasts as the vanguard, and all their clansmen used energy to support them.

They directly charged into the lair of an intermediate power in the universe, directly tearing that intermediate race apart.

The space beasts were extremely attractive to many races.

Not long ago, even the princess of the Water Dragon Palace personally led a group of experts to subdue the ten ferocious dragon-headed beast.

Unfortunately, they were ambushed by the Fire Dragon Palace and the ten-headed Dragon Beast was obtained by the Fire Dragon Palace.

This could also be seen how attractive a space beast was to a group of races.

When some experts of the forces received this news, they naturally wanted to investigate and see if they could subdue it.

“Dragon King, we’re here. The nest of the horned seal race is ahead.”

However, just as some forces in the surrounding Lu Xingkong were coveting Xiao Lan’s little house…

Prime Minister Gui, who was on Xiao Lan’s body, reported to Wang Xian.

“Are the eight-point race ready?”

“They are ready. The news that the eight-point race and Xiao Lan’s little house have appeared in the surrounding Lu Xingkong has gathered many experts from the horned seal race and the snake princess race.”

“Once we appear, the experts from the horned seal race and the snake queen race will arrive very soon.”

Prime Minister Gui nodded his head.

“Alright.”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and looked ahead.

In the surrounding void space, there were many planets. There were many experts and flying crafts shuttling through the starry skies.

They had already arrived at the interior of the space domain of the horned seal race.

The surrounding planets were all planets where the horned seal race’s people lived.

“These two space beasts actually appeared within the territory of our horned seal race. Immediately report to the Lords.”

“Quick, quick, report to the Lords within the race. If they go crazy, we won’t be able to hold them off.”

The experts on the surrounding planets looked at the small blue house that was rapidly flying past in shock as they spoke.

At the same time, on the core planet of the horned seal race, countless experts were gathered here.

“According to the news from the front, those two space beasts are flying in our territory. If they don’t change their direction, it’s very likely that they will reach our side.”

On a huge platform that towered into the clouds on the planet, an old man looked at his subordinate’s report and said.

“Do you know what the Space Beast Is?”

A warrior from the horned seal race asked.

“Not yet, it’s huge, at least 500 to 600 km. There are people in the AI guessing that it’s a terrifying being that flew out from the mountain and sea meridians of the primal continent!”

The old man shook his head.

“If one of the two space beasts has the power of a level 5 knight and the other has the power of a Level 4 knight, I think we can give it a try.”

In the center, an old man holding a crescent moon weapon said, looking at the middle-aged man, “Leader, what do you think?”

“I think we can give it a try, with the strength of the seven of us, we still have a chance.”

The leader’s eyes gleamed as he said.

The attraction of the Space Beasts was too great.

Hearing his words, the old man holding the crescent moon weapon curled his lips, he ordered, “Let everyone prepare first. Call the Snake Princess clan over. Their abilities can also help a little. If we can succeed this time, it will be a big improvement for us.”

“Yes, Patriarch!”

The surrounding elders immediately responded.

“Should we prepare the forbidden eye?”

A dignified old man beside him hesitated for a moment and said. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“There’s no need. If we use the eye of taboo, even if we can suppress it, we won’t be able to subdue it.”

The old man holding the crescent weapon raised his eyebrows and shook his head.

“True!”

The old man nodded and the group stood on the high platform in the sky and looked ahead quietly.

Soon, the Knights of the snake ji race flew over.

“Do you have the confidence to suppress that Space Beast?”

The leading snake lady flew over and said solemnly.

“Based on the specific situation, if that Space Beast’s power is too strong, we don’t have to act Rashly.”

The horned seal race leader said.

The surrounding people nodded slightly.

“Wu Wu!”

However at this time, a low roar sounded, two huge beings appeared in their line of sight.

“What space beasts are these, how can they be so huge?”

When the two space beasts appeared in their sight, the gaze of the snake lady race members froze.

Too Huge!

“This power, it should be a level 5 Knight!”

“However, a normal level 5 knight can forget about fighting that Space Beast!”

The leader of the horned seal race immediately analyzed.

“They are flying towards us? What are these two space beasts doing?”

At this moment, they suddenly realized that the two enormous space beasts were flying straight towards them, causing the expressions of everyone from the horned seal race to change slightly.

“A universe Knight Level 5 space beast, we can try to suppress it!”

The eyes of the old man holding the crescent weapon gleamed as he spoke.

The rest of the people nodded slightly, their eyes burning with passion.

Here, the horned seal race had the geographical advantage while the two space beasts were still flying over recklessly.

This was a huge opportunity for them.

Perhaps, they could suppress it!

“Hehe!”

“Get Ready, let’s do it!”

Wang Xian, who was on Xiao Lan’s body, saw more than 3,000 universe knights from the horned seal race and the snake princess race gathered together. His eyes were cold.

“Wu Wu Wu!”

“Wu Wu!”

Hearing the order, Xiao Lan’s small house’s gray pupils glowed.

They suddenly opened their huge mouths, and a black hole suddenly appeared.

The black hole expanded at a terrifying speed, as if it wanted to devour the entire world.
