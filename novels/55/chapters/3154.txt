Chapter 3155: Eruption of 3154: three races vs Dragon Palace 4

“Huh?”

In front of the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian and the rest saw the two venerables from the ancient art sect who had suddenly appeared. They narrowed their eyes slightly and there was a glint in their eyes.

“Hahaha, I didn’t Expect Your Dragon Palace to be so arrogant. You even dared to kill Venerable Lou Shan from the ancient art sect.”

“You are courting death. However, we can completely exterminate all of you even without the ancient art sect.”

The leader of the nine swords race was slightly stunned when he saw this scene. He roared ferociously.

The Dragon Palace was not far from death.

“HMPH, how dare you people from the ancient painting sect come to our Dragon Palace to be arrogant. So what if we kill you?”

Wang Xian stared at the two universe knights from the ancient painting sect. His eyes were filled with coldness. “Why don’t you and the nine swords race, these three races who are courting death, join forces and see who dies in the end.”

“Arrogant, arrogant!”

The two universe knights of the ancient painting sect were filled with killing intent. “Dragon Palace, you will definitely perish. This is what our ancient painting sect has said.”

“Ka Ka Ka, there’s no need for your ancient painting sect to say it. Our skeleton race says that they will definitely perish, so we will definitely perish.”

Just as the two universe knights of the ancient painting sect finished speaking, the golden skeleton clan leader, who was located in front of the Skeleton Island, let out a metallic laugh.

“All disciples of the skeleton clan, Get Ready!”

He raised his golden arm and shouted.

Crack! Crack! Crack

A series of metallic sounds were heard, and countless disciples of the skeleton clan emerged from the ground of Skeleton Island.

At a glance, one could not see the end.

There were at least a few billion of them.

Every skeleton was emitting a terrifying murderous aura.

They weren’t afraid of death or pain, their numbers were huge.

At the very front were countless undying god emperor level skeleton disciples, behind them were emperor level ones.

The skeleton sea was usually the main tactic in the battles of the skeleton races, winning with numbers.

They didn’t care about the sacrifice of the weak skeletons.

“All disciples of the nine blade race, prepare to destroy the Dragon Palace!”

“Roar, exterminate the Dragon Palace!”

The leader of the nine-blade race raised the long sword in his hand and roared. The eyes of the 30,000 strong warriors were filled with killing intent.

The Dragon Palace had forced them to flee. Today, they would make the Dragon Palace pay the price.

“Hahaha, blood-thirsty race, Kill!”

“Kill!”

The blood of the leader of the blood-thirsty race rose, and his blood qi soared into the sky as he roared loudly.

Other than the 14 universe knights, there were over a million other members of the blood evil race.

When the blood aura rose from their bodies, it was like a blood-red pearl falling from the sky.

This scene was extremely terrifying.

“The war is about to break out!”

“What a terrifying aura. This time, nine swords, skeleton, and blood evil used 22 universe knights.”

“Although the number is not as many as the Dragon Palace, there are more level two universe knights among them. Furthermore, the powerful trump cards of the nine swords race and the skeleton race have yet to be revealed.”

In the surrounding void space, Universe Knights from all the elementary races in the Milky Way had arrived.

They watched from afar and felt the terrifying aura spreading from the skeleton island. Their faces were filled with shock.

“All the disciples of the Dragon Palace, prepare to kill the enemy!”

Wang Xian stared at them coldly. His eyes were filled with awe as he shouted sternly.

“Kill the enemy!”

“The Dragon Palace is invincible!”

The faces of all the members of the Dragon Palace were filled with fighting spirit.

“Kill!”

On the skeleton island in front of them, the golden skeleton chief roared loudly.

Crash

The disciples of the skeleton race flew out from the skeleton island like a sea of skeletons. They flew towards the Dragon Palace in all directions.

They raised their arms to protect the front, the skeletons were connected together, from afar, they formed a sharp shield and rushed forward.

There were over a billion skeletons at the front.

The weakest was an undying emperor level being, extremely terrifying.

The power of the 10 skeletons at the front was something even knights would be wary of.

“Kill!”

The golden skeleton clan leader moved and flew up. His gaze was locked onto the group of knights from the Dragon Palace.

He waved his arm and numerous sharp golden lights attacked Wang Xian and the rest.

“Kill, Kill, Kill!”

Behind them, the black robes on the Knights of the skeleton clan disappeared instantly.

Their pitch-black bodies were revealed and blood-red ghost flames were dancing in their pupils.

The skeletons all over their bodies were glowing. They were not evil skeletons, but holy objects.

“Kill, Kill, Dragon Blood, Hahaha!”

The leader of the blood-thirsty race rushed up, and the bloodthirsty blood in the sky kept flying up.

Around him, all the Knights of the blood-thirsty race started to move, and they attacked the Knights of Dragon Palace.

“Lei Ming, find a chance to kill a few universe knights!”

“Kill the rest!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were shining. He growled and moved to meet the Universe Knights of the three races.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Roar Roar Roar!”

In an instant, the 30 universe knights of the Dragon Palace started to move.

As for the other 10 universe knights, they were still hiding in the Dragon Palace, waiting for an opportunity.

From the outside world, 30 Universe Knights was all the power of the Dragon Palace.

However, Wang Xian did not let Lei Ming hide.

He knew that the skeleton race had an existence that could fight against a universe knight level 3.

Since that was the case, Wang Xian did not need lei long to hide.

“The Dragon Palace has six universe knight level existences. There are 24 universe Knights Level 1, which is much more than the three major races. However, the three major races have one more universe Knight Level 2 than the Dragon Palace.”

“The skeleton race still has a trump card they haven’t used, and the nine blade race also has a trump card. I think Dragon Palace should have one too, they’re testing each other out.”

In the surrounding areas, the universe knights watched the battle ahead, their eyes shining.

This time, they could clearly understand the skeleton race and Dragon Palace’s strength.

Rumble! Rumble! Rumble

In the sky, the energies of both parties collided, shattering the surrounding void space and turning it into darkness. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Kill!”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes slightly and the five elements millstone appeared beneath him. His gaze locked onto a Level 2 universe knight from the blood evil race and he charged forward.

In the surroundings, the members of the Dragon Palace also locked onto their targets.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Led by billions of Skeleton Corps, the elites of the nine-sword race and the experts of the brutal blood race rushed toward the dragon palace at the bottom of the Milky Way.

“It’s time for you to see the strength of the Dragon Palace.”

Prime Minister Gui narrowed his eyes and guarded the rear.

“Dragon Wizard, Arrow Dragon, Attack!”

He shouted and ordered the attack.
