3450 3449, a terrifying battle

The body of the Astral Beast was completely revealed. Its triangular head coldly stared at Baili’s Archangel.

That monstrous aura caused everyone to feel suffocated.

Baili’s Archangel stared at the Astral Beast. His twelve angelic wings flapped, and his eyes were calm.

“Retreat. I want the twelfth grade water lotus.”

He stared at the space beast calmly, and his expression didn’t change at all.

“I’ve protected the grade-12 water lotus for billions of years, and you want to take it away? Angel race, from today onwards, I want to kill everyone I see!”

The Space Beast let out a furious roar.

Any living creature in the heaven opening primal continent, as long as they reached the universe ruler realm, would possess powerful intelligence.

Naturally, there was no problem for them to speak the language of the universe.

The three eyes of the space beast that were filled with killing intent stared at the 12-winged archangel with incomparable ferocity.

“HMPH, going against our Angel race, even if you are a space beast, you must die!”

The 12-winged archangel snorted with disdain.

In the next moment, the 12-winged archangel on his back flapped its wings and instantly appeared in the sky above the space beast.

The Tentacle of the space beast also moved in an instant. The entire world seemed to be completely enveloped.

Boom! Boom! Boom

At the next moment, a terrifying collision sound was heard.

He couldn’t see it anymore!

Wang Xian and all the experts around him couldn’t see the battle inside anymore. They could only feel waves of terrifying energy surging over.

“Their speed is too fast. My Eyes Can’t keep up at all.”

Wang Xian looked at the battle in front of him. His pupils contracted slightly and his face was filled with shock.

It was too fast.

When Baili Archangel flapped his long wings, Wang Xian could no longer catch his figure.

The gigantic space beast was also enveloped by the water and light energy.

They retreated backward repeatedly.

Even the Angel Army that was surrounding them immediately expanded their encirclement.

“How terrifying, they are so powerful!”

Lingling spoke beside Wang Xian’s ear as she trembled slightly.

“The treasure is right below them. You Don’t dare to snatch the treasure now, right?”

Wang Xian smiled and said to her.

“I don’t Dare!”

Lingling replied obediently.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The Rumble and battle continued in the middle. They were watching the vast battle from afar.

With Wang Xian’s current strength, he wouldn’t even be left with a speck of dust if he entered.

“This is too terrifying. Is this a battle between the Masters of the Universe?”

“I wonder who will win. This battle is too terrifying!”

“It should be archangel Baili who will win. After all, he is the Master of the Angel Race!”

In the surrounding area, all the experts were discussing.

The commotion of this battle could even be seen clearly in Heng Tian City.

Buzz

All of a sudden, everyone felt the sky brightening up.

A Bright Cross appeared in the sky.

The entire cross was emitting a dazzling light power.

When this cross appeared, the surrounding space seemed to have disappeared. There was only this cross in the world.

“What is this? An innate treasure?”

Wang Xian could feel an unusually terrifying aura from this cross.

This cross seemed to be able to judge everything.

“Innate supreme treasure, cross of Judgment!”

The Great Elf, Life Voice, who was standing quietly at the side of the battlefield, looked at the Cross of judgment with a solemn expression in his eyes.

Every innate supreme treasure was extremely precious.

It was extremely difficult for the masters of their universe to obtain it.

This required luck, Luck, and strength.

Just like now, the Space Beast had been waiting for the birth of the grade-12 water lotus for billions of years.

It wasn’t certain whether it could be obtained now.

The Cross of judgement appeared in the Void and descended directly, as if it could suppress everything.

“Bird Man of the Angel race, do you think I haven’t made any preparations in these billions of years? If you want to snatch the grade-12 water lotus, I’ll destroy it, but I won’t let you take it away, hahaha!”

“Twelfth-grade Water Lotus, Bloom!”

At this moment, a violent voice was heard from the center. The river of eternity below was trembling violently.

The river water started to change. In the huge area, the river water condensed into a lotus pattern.

The Lotus Rose and headed towards the Cross of judgment.

When everyone around saw this scene, they were shocked.

Wang Xian had a strange expression on his face.

“Me?”?

A gigantic space beast actually called himself “Me”? Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

This… The Universe was full of wonders.

“Beast, stop it. If you dare to destroy the foundation of a twelfth grade water lotus, I will definitely kill you today!”

Baili’s Archangel revealed an angry expression. The judgement cross in the sky accelerated and descended.

Following that, one by one, the angel wings gathered around them. Flapping their wings, they shot towards the center.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The terrifying attack came again. On the surface of the river, Wang Xian could feel that the water had turned red.

The Space Beast was injured. From the looks of it, its injuries were not light!

“Beast, Scram immediately.”

Baili Archangel roared again, and a spear suddenly appeared above the judgement cross.

The surroundings of this spear were pitch black, as if it was in another dimension.

“You actually have an innate supreme treasure. You were prepared for this. Ahhhh!”

The Space Beast’s angry voice sounded.

“Holy Bone Spear, isn’t this the universe light Archangel’s innate supreme treasure? He actually took it. Looks like Baili was prepared for this.”

The great elf life sound arrow frowned slightly when she saw the holy bone spear come out.

She was at the same level as Baili Archangel, but he had the innate supreme treasure, judgement cross.

This was why she was wary of him.

As a peak race, he had an innate supreme treasure. If she fought him, she would definitely be at a disadvantage.

Now, he had another innate supreme treasure, holy bone spear.

“Maybe I can really kill this space beast.”

She muttered.

The Space Beast did not have a Cosmos God nation. It could also be said that their huge bodies were a cosmos God nation.

Hence, they did not immediately flee back to their God nation.

Facing the attack of the two innate supreme treasures, great archangel Bai Lie had a great chance to destroy them.

“Twelfth-grade water lotus, explode, rhythm of water, water from the sky!”

The Space Beast Roared.

“You’re courting death!”

Archangel Baili also roared furiously.

“Splash!”

The water from the sky that wasn’t supposed to fall fell down again.

The difference was that the water from the sky carried tens of thousands of tons and attacked Archangel Baili.

“Hahaha, you didn’t expect this, did you? I’ve been here for billions of years, and I’ve already made a huge connection with the twelfth grade water lotus. If you want to snatch it away, you’ll only be able to obtain a badly damaged twelfth grade water lotus.”

The Space Behemoth roared crazily.
