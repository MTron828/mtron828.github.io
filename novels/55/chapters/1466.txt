Chapter 1467: The destruction of 1467 second-rate force 1

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

While Ren Xingchen was dodging the attack of the Wu clan leader, he was killing the Wu clan members wantonly.

While everyone around was watching the battle in shock, the gate of the towering sky sword sect slowly opened.

Two old men and a woman walked in the center, followed by a group of middle-aged men.

“Huh?”

When the gate of the sword sect opened and everyone walked out, the high-ranking officials and disciples of the towering sky sword sect frowned slightly.

There was no respectful voice, not even the voice of the disciples guarding the gate.

The two old men and the woman looked over with displeasure, and found that more than ten disciples were looking into the distance with shocked faces.

“Jian Qingjian Wen, what are you doing?”

Behind them, a middle-aged man saw the displeasure on the three old men’s faces and hurriedly shouted at the disciples who did not know what was going on. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Ah, elders, deacons, Senior Brothers!”

More than ten disciples who were guarding the gate reacted and turned around to see the elders. They hurriedly bowed.

“What’s going on? I told you to guard the gate, but you can’t even guard it properly. I think you...”

The middle-aged man berated them sternly.

The old man at the side waved his hand. The middle-aged man immediately stopped and glared at the crowd.

“What happened?”

The old man in the middle looked forward and asked curiously.

Today, the towering Sky Sword sect opened its mountain gate to recruit disciples.

The surrounding clans and aristocratic families within a radius of more than a thousand kilometers swarmed over. When the mountain gate was opened, this scene appeared, causing them to be somewhat curious.

“Reporting to Elder, there are people fighting ahead!”

A disciple hurriedly said.

“Oh? Fighting? Don’t bother about them. Our towering sky sword sect’s disciple recruitment process has begun!”

That elder shook his head indifferently.

“Elder... Elder!”

That disciple hesitated for a moment before continuing, “The battle over there is between a young man and the Wu clan of ancient magic city. Right now, besides the Wu clan’s patriarch, almost all the other clansmen in ancient magic city have been killed!”

“A young man?”

The elder was slightly taken aback as he asked in surprise.

“That’s right, it’s a young man. He’s only in his thirties and has the strength of a third level profound void martial artist!”

The disciple hurriedly nodded his head.

“What?”

The three elders at the very front revealed expressions of shock. Their bodies moved as they directly floated in the air, looking towards the center of the battle.

The rest of the people also flew up into the sky curiously, their gazes fixed over.

“I really didn’t expect that that young man to have killed almost all the members of the Wu clan!”

“This young man’s strength is at the second level of the profound void tier, but he has dual cultivation of both metal and water attributes. Heavens, this is simply abnormal!”

“Monstrous, simply too monstrous. The Wu clan provoked such an enemy, and sooner or later, they will be exterminated!”

“I heard that that young man is a disciple of the Ren clan that the Wu clan exterminated a few years ago. His dual cultivation has even reached the second level of the profound void martial stage. Even in our vast sea region, he will shine brilliantly!”

The three elders of the towering sky sword sect had just flown into the sky when they heard the shocked voices of several experts from the surroundings.

In the surroundings, even those fourth or fifth level profound void martial stage experts were staring at the scene with faces full of shock.

The three elders looked over and their pupils contracted.

“What exquisite swordsmanship!”

“What a powerful dual-attribute usage!”

“What monstrous talent!”

Three exclamations sounded from their mouths and the eyes of the three elders flickered.

“If we can recruit him into our sky high sword sect, just recruiting him alone would be equivalent to recruiting a few thousand!”

The old man in the middle, Shuangyang, spoke with some fervor.

“Such a monster should be nurtured by an expert!”

The woman next to him frowned.

“Clan leader Wu is going to be defeated!”

“The Wu clan is really going to be destroyed!”

At this moment, a surprised voice came from the front.

Everyone looked over at the same time. At a height of one thousand meters above the ocean, there were countless golden and blue longswords covering a radius of one thousand meters.

Countless longswords attacked the Wu clan leader in the middle.

“Ah, you little bastard, no, no!”

In the sky, the Wu clan leader shouted in fear.

“10,000 Golden Swords!”

Ren Xingchen roared and all the longswords attacked the Wu clan leader.

“Pu, Pu, Pu!”

Tens of thousands of longswords pierced through one body and broke into pieces.

“Hiss, terrifying!”

“Although he relied on a formation during the battle just now, his strength is absolutely terrifying!”

When the surrounding people saw this scene, their faces revealed a look of shock and bewilderment.

“Hu!”

Ren Xingchen slightly panted, and his gaze slowly stared at the ship of the song clan.

When his gaze landed, the faces of all the song clan members changed drastically, and their bodies couldn’t help but take a step back.

Their strength was much weaker than the Wu clan’s. The strongest among them was only at the second level of the profound void tier.

If Ren Xingchen wanted to destroy them, it would be a piece of cake.

“Clang!”

Ren Xingchen slowly moved the longsword in his hand. He looked at the song clan’s ship and slowly flew over.

“Next, it’s Your Turn!”

His cold voice covered all the song clan members, causing their faces to instantly turn extremely pale.

“Xingchen, our song clan did not participate in the matter of exterminating your clan. It was all done by the Wu clan. It has nothing to do with us!”

The song clan’s clan leader was no longer as high-spirited as before. He cried out involuntarily.

“Then you didn’t say that just now!”

Ren Xingchen stared at them with killing intent.

“Gulp!”

The song clan’s clan leader swallowed a mouthful of saliva. His voice trembled as he said, “Just now, just now, we said the wrong thing!”

“I’d rather kill the wrong person than let you go. So, you have to die too!”

Ren Xingchen said as he shook the long sword in his hand.

“No, you can’t kill me, you can’t kill me!”

Song Wan shouted at Ren Xingchen with a terrified face.

“Eh, isn’t that little girl the one you like, elder Qi?”

At this moment, an old man in the sky above the towering sky sword sect looked at the woman beside him and asked.

“That’s right. I’ve taken a fancy to a girl. Her talent is extremely rare among women!”

Elder qi frowned slightly.

“Today, all of you will die!”

Ren Xingchen’s cold voice sounded. He waved the long sword in his hand and numerous powerful sharp swords shot towards the song clan.

“Buzz!”

Elder Qi hesitated for a moment. He waved his arm and a huge sword charged forward.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

The sound of sharp swords clashing could be heard. All of Ren Xingchen’s attacks were blocked.

“Huh?”

“What’s going on? who made a move? !”

When the surrounding people saw that the huge sword had easily blocked all of Ren Xingchen’s attacks, they were slightly stunned. They quickly looked behind them.

“That is?”

When everyone looked over, their pupils constricted slightly and a respectful expression appeared on their faces.

“This little brother, Song Wan is already a disciple of our Atlas Sword sect!”

Elder Qi floated over, and the elders and deacon disciples on both sides immediately followed behind.
