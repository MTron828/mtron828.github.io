The foundation of the Righteous God race was extraordinary.

They had a powerful righteous god combat body and a huge number of universe knights.

“All of them are not simple. The ancient sea race is also very strong. The space beasts are terrifying. No wonder the Dragon Palace and the Water Dragon Palace were only ranked third even after they joined forces to destroy the demonic dragon lineage and the holy prose clan.”

Wang Xian mumbled as he watched all the powerhouses of the righteous God race fly forward.

In the surrounding area, there were also countless people looking at them with respect.

“I heard that the ancient sea race will have a large-scale auction tomorrow. There will be many acquired Numinous Treasures for sale.”

At the same time, at the center of the Righteous God race, there were more than ten figures standing on a canvas.

One of them was holding a flask of wine. An old man who looked a bit sloppy took a sip of wine and asked.

“It seems so. According to their announcement on the universe AI, there are no less than eight acquired true treasures now.”

A middle-aged man nodded.

“Let me ask what kind of treasure it is. If there are any treasures that we can use, we can go there tomorrow!”

An old woman on the right side said indifferently.

“Haha, for the sake of this big battle, I’ve already sold all of my things to exchange for some treasures. I don’t have the money to participate in the auction anymore. Old Wine, you have quite a few divine stones now. Exchange them for battle strength, just in case.”

An old man on the left side with bulging muscles said with a laugh.

“That’s exactly what I’m thinking. This time, we’ll challenge the mountain giant tribe. We’ll fight in close combat. Their strength isn’t weak, and I still want to live for another hundred million years. Hehe, let me ask what kind of treasures there are. If there are any good treasures, I’ll go over tomorrow to take a look.”

The person holding the wine flask said with a smile.

“I got the news. There are seven acquired Numinous Treasures, one fire-type, one water-type, and two light-type. None of them are of any use to us.”

“There are also three metal-type treasures. One of them is a metal-type battle armor that’s not bad. TSK TSK, the effects of this battle armor are very strong. It’s considered the peak among acquired Numinous Treasures. Just looking at it makes me want to buy it.”

Soon, the old woman raised her eyebrows and said in surprise.

“Oh? There are three metal-type items? There’s even a metal-type battle armor? Not Bad, not bad. I’ll Go There Tomorrow!”

The old man holding the wine pot said, “But there are three acquired Numinous Treasures with metal-type attributes. I think there will be many people going.”

“Hehe, even if there are many people going, many clansmen will give you face, Old Jiu.”

The middle-aged man next to him said with a smile.

The old man with the wine pot laughed loudly.

The group of experts from the Righteous God race continued to move forward. Half an hour later, they stopped in the Void to prepare for battle.

Although they were very strong, they didn’t dare to be careless when facing the races from the heaven opening primal continent.

The arrival of the righteous god race caused a huge sensation.

The entire starry sky was discussing the strength of the righteous God race.

Time passed bit by bit, and a day passed in the blink of an eye.

The next day was the day of the ancient sea race auction.

Because the great battle of the Righteous God race had attracted almost all the experts in the surrounding starry sky, by the morning of the fifth day, according to the ancient sea race auction house’s announcement, the number of acquired spiritual treasures.., there were already eight of them.

Eight acquired Numinous Treasures had attracted countless experts to participate in this auction.

In the morning, countless people flew towards the auction house.

Wang Xian also flew towards the auction house that had many tiny peaks standing tall in the morning.

When he arrived at the auction house, he took a jade token and went straight to a peak close to the front.

As the auctioneer of the five acquired spiritual treasures, he naturally had to enjoy extremely high treatment.

There were a few tables, chairs, and some delicacies in a few hundred square meters of space.

Wang Xian sat there and scanned his surroundings. He waited quietly.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Figures from the surrounding areas flew over quickly.

There were experts from various races in groups of three to five. There were more than a hundred of them.

The leaders were all at the level of universe knights.

As long as one stepped onto the mountain peak, there would basically be experts at the level of universe knights.

One could imagine how many experts had been attracted to this battle.

Wang Xian sat there and waited quietly.

“Eh? There are experts from the Righteous God race here? And there are quite a number of them. Are they also participating in this auction?”

At this moment, a surprised voice was heard.

Wang Xian looked over and his eyes flickered.

It was easy to identify the people from the righteous God race. Every one of them was about five meters tall. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Their bodies were emitting a strong qi and blood energy, giving off a strong impact.

Some of the experts from the righteous god race were even emitting a golden glow.

They charged over directly and everyone around them immediately made way for them.

As they swept their gaze over, over a thousand experts from the righteous God race came to the few peaks at the front. They were not too far away from Wang Xian.

The arrival of the experts from the righteous god race attracted everyone’s attention.

Most of their eyes were filled with reverence.

This was because it was very likely that the righteous god race was about to set foot on the heaven-splitting primordial land.

Wang Xian did not mind it and waited for the auction to begin.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Half an hour later, roars were heard, accompanied by the power of the wilderness.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian swept his gaze over and revealed a look of surprise.

In the surrounding area, twenty space hum beasts were flying over from all directions rapidly. They slowly surrounded the entire auction house.

The gigantic space hum beasts scanned everyone with their cold eyes.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

At this moment, experts from the ancient sea race flew over from the front and landed on the auction stage.

Twenty space beasts guarded the surroundings.

Big Spender!

“Welcome to our ancient sea race’s auction. Haha, it’s Our Honor.”

An old man dressed in white stood in the middle of the auction stage and laughed loudly as he spread his arms.

“Everyone should be clear about the rules of our ancient sea race auction. The highest bidder will get it. The bidders can choose to hide their identities. Our ancient sea race will also ensure everyone’s safety.”

“If anyone dares to cause trouble, kill them immediately!”

“Of course, our ancient sea race values harmony. I Won’t waste any more words. The auction will begin immediately!”

As the white-robed elder spoke, he lightly clapped his hands.

“This time, our auction will be very grand. First, we will begin with a acquired Numinous Treasure!”

As he spoke, a beautiful woman immediately brought over a box. The box opened, revealing a light attribute acquired numinous treasure.

“We will start with a acquired Numinous Treasure. It’s a big deal!”

“Haha, there must be a lot of good stuff this time. Let’s see if we can get anything!”
