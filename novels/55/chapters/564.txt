Chapter 565:

The First Customer (1)

“I have a shop now. Next, it’s the customers!”

After Wang Xian and the middle-aged landlord settled the store together, the moon was already up in the sky.

Wang Xian took a look at the tiny shop with a satisfied look on his face.

He did not want to open a shop in the first place for fear of too much trouble.

The alchemy and equipment refining system in the Yong Chang world was already matured. Hence, there was no direct sale of Spiritual Grass and materials.

Instead, all the alchemy and equipment refining stores would collect and procure Spiritual Grass and materials for refining equipment.

This prohibited Wang Xian from earning the difference of self-purchasing Spiritual Grass to refine his own elixir pills.

Many things had been monopolized in the small and prosperous Yong Chang.

No one would need to worry about the materials when going into the store as they could straightaway forge their items.

But opening a shop by himself meant that customers would have to prepare all the materials by themselves.

But he would not sell elixir pills or weapons, but rather, he would provide a processing service.

When customers approached him with materials, he would refine them into elixir pills and Spiritual Equipment.

This would be the first store that provided such a service in the all of Yong Chang.

He created this type of store not for its uniqueness, but rather, it was a helpless act.

“If not, I’d have to stay in the shop and wait for business every day!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows, but soon, he straightened out his thoughts.

At present, there was nothing to learn in Mt Fengyu either.

He had already mastered the first level of battle techniques. To learn the second level, he needed to come up with resources for exchange.

Two thousand Spiritual Stones in a day.

This was a massive number to any disciple of Da Hong Immortal Sect.

Unless the disciples came from a wealthy background whereby their parents could afford such an amount, ordinary disciples would not be able to cough out two thousand Spiritual Stones.

“There’s nothing to do even if I stay in Mt Fengyu. Why don’t I just inform Mentor Yu?”

Wang Xian hesitated before he locked up the store and rode off to Da Hong Immortal Sect on his sword.

“Hur? Mentor Yu, you’re still up!”

Wang Xian came to the living room and was surprised to see Mentor Yu having tea. He hurriedly greeted her in shock.

“Waiting for you to get back. I did not expect your strength to be so great!” Mentor Yu exclaimed as she looked at Wang Xian with glistening eyes.

She did not expect that the injured young man she picked up from the waterfall could promote Mt Fengyu by nine positions in one day!

“It was beyond my expectation too.”

Wang Xian smiled and did not comment further.

“Since you beat Kong Guanglin today, cease your individual challenges and mountain sect challenges for the time being,” said Mentor Yu.

“Hur? Why?”

Wang Xian was startled as he looked at Mentor Yu.

“Tenth place is good for us. The disciples of Mt Fengyu are not eligible to access the resources for tenth position and below. Besides, making a showy display on your ability might not be a good idea!” said Mentor Yu to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian revealed a contemplative look as he understood what Mentor Yu was trying to say.

Mt Fengyu’s disciples were weak. If they received resources that were completely unmatched with their own strength, it would trigger grievances and jealousy. Though no one would say anything on the surface, some finger-pointing from the others was inevitable.

If a Dan Realm disciple decided to seek trouble from an Inborn disciple, that would be an easy job even with Da Hong Immortal Sect’s rules and regulations in place.

“How about the individual leaderboard?” asked Wang Xian.

“If you possess the strength of the top three, you may go ahead and challenge as you wish. Now, you should just slow down and maintain a low profile!” Mentor Yu suggested to Wang Xian.

“I got it, Mentor Yu. I would like to have my cultivation outside for a short period!” said Wang Xian as he nodded.

“Outside? Sure. But you need to return once a week. I’m your mentor, and I’m responsible for you!” said Mentor Yu to Wang Xian.

“Great!”

Wang Xian nodded.

“Take a good rest. I’ll be claiming our resources for the mountain sect and your resources for the twentieth position of individual outstanding supreme talents.”

Mentor Yu exhibited a smile.

“Yes, Mentor Yu!”

Wang Xian nodded with gratefulness.

“Have a good rest!”

Mentor Yu walked up the stairs as soon as she finished talking to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian looked at the disappearing figure and smiled.

Mentor Yu was considered to be the closest person to him in this Yong Chang world.

I must repay her gratitude in the future!

Wang Xian pondered to himself. He did not return to his room, but rather headed to Yong Chang City on his sword.

When he arrived at the marketplace of Yong Chang City, Wang Xian did not rest. He went shopping and bought three signboards.

A horizontal one and two vertical ones.

On the horizontal one, he engraved “Alchemy and Blacksmith Master.” The other two signboards were used for the introduction.

“Bring your own materials. Refining pills by an alchemy master.”

“Bring your own materials. Forging by a blacksmith master.”

Wang Xian revealed a satisfying look as he hung the signboards outside his shop.

He then went to purchase some tables, chairs, and tools at night.

After three hours of work, he finally got the entire shop ready.

“Now, I’ll just wait for business to come!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian revealed a faint smile and came to the third story to rest.

The next morning, he opened the shop early and waited for customers to come in.

The daily traffic volume was crazy in the central area of Yong Chang City.

From early in the morning, there was non-stop human flow in front of the stores on the street.

However, no one entered the store.

Compared to the shops around him, his shop was tiny.

Besides, his decoration was far off from those shops around him. It was a stark contrast, as his shop looked rundown.

The elixir stores had posh decorations and a refreshing and spirit-lifting herb smell at the entrance, while one could sense sharpness from the other weapon stores even from afar.

His shop did not have any features.

“Alchemy and Blacksmith Master? What a brag. How can such a small store have masters around?”

“Why would such a master reside in such a small place?”

“Now that our Spiritual Stones are becoming fewer, unscrupulous businessmen are increasing. Haha, it’s just a tiny, twenty square-meter place, and the signboard puts ‘Alchemy and Blacksmith Master.’ Pui!”

“A new shop? This is obviously a scam! If such masters were around, they would hold an opening ceremony. That would naturally draw the attention of the crowd. Scammers!”

Some passers-by took a peek inside the shop with curiosity when they saw the signboards outside. But after they took a look at the shop, they commented disdainfully.

Many people passed by the shop from morning to afternoon. Some people noticed the signboards, but all of them were disdainful and ridiculed them.

“How is it possible to have a master in a tiny shop like this? Besides, why would masters be staying here?”

“This is typical lousy marketing.”

Wang Xian was sitting in the shop as he overheard the sarcastic remarks mentioned by the passers-by as they stopped by for a brief moment. However, he was not disheartened and waited patiently.

This was his first day of business, and he remained patient.

Cream would always rise up to the top. He would make his name known in Yong Chang soon!
