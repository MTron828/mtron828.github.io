Chapter 2949: easily swept through the glazed domain

“Everyone from the Dragon Palace…”

“This!”

“What are they trying to do?”

When the devouring dragon and the others rushed out, the god emperors and domain lords of the glazed domain were slightly shocked and shouted!

!!

“Prime Minister Gui, tell them not to be rash. Yaoxie is much stronger than us. Let’s…”

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Roar Roar Roar!”

…

The governor’s expression changed drastically as he hurriedly spoke to Prime Minister Gui.

Even though he could sense the level three divine emperor strength of the Dragon Palace member, there were two leaders of Yaoxie and more than fifty divine emperors of Yaoxie in front of them.

All they needed to do was to fend off Yaoxie. It was too dangerous for them to rush over recklessly.

However, before he could finish his sentence, six terrifying roars sounded!

“Hiss, what’s This?”

The domain Lord quickly looked forward and took a deep breath. His face was filled with shock.

“This, this, this…”

The surrounding godly monarchs also revealed shocked expressions.

The six roars came from the six members of the Dragon Palace who had rushed out.

However, at this moment, they had completely changed.

Their bodies turned into ferocious monsters that were 30,000 meters in size.

They were 30,000 meters in size, had 18 terrifying sharp claws, a ferocious and terrifying head, and a long tail that looked like a divine dragon.

A savage, bloodthirsty and violent aura was emitted from their bodies.

The six members of the Dragon Palace directly attacked the Army of the Wicked Beast Lair.

They could immediately confirm from the aura emitted by the six members of the Dragon Palace.

That was the power of a level three divine emperor.

That was the power that only domain lords could unleash.

The six members of the Dragon Palace were all level three divine emperors!

This… made them feel extremely shocked.

Six level-three divine emperors!

“TSK, TSK, tsk. Six of you, don’t let any of these evildoers escape. Kill them all!”

Ba Qi stood at the back and felt the devouring Dragon’s aura. He roared with envy.

“Roar! Roar!”

A devouring dragon in the middle let out a low roar and looked at the other five brothers.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

An incomparably violent voice came from their mouths once again. Their roars completely covered the roars of all the evil demons in front of them.

At this moment, the evil demons from the two demon caves seemed to have been cast with a body-immobilizing spell. They stared blankly at the six devouring dragons that were attacking them.

Sensing the violence, Bloodthirst, and savagery on their bodies, it was as if they were nothing compared to them!

“Heeheeheehee!”

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The two leaders of the bewitching charm and the bewitching Sprite felt the aura of the devouring dragons and let out a panicked roar.

“Heeheeheehee!”

“Roar Roar Roar!”

However, when they saw the six devouring dragons charging at them, they could only give the order to attack.

“Roar Roar!”

The 50-odd demonic god Emperors in the two devil caves suppressed the fear in their hearts and directly faced the six devouring dragons.

“Those who seek death, don’t leave a single one alive!”

One of the devouring dragons let out a low roar and looked disdainfully at Yao Xie who was attacking them. He raised his head!

“Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!”

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

A black ball condensed in their mouths and directly attacked Yao Xie in front of them.

“Peng! Peng! Peng!”

When the ball flew out, the black ball exploded, and the entire ball actually split into small insects with earthy yellow bodies and pitch-black wings.

The insect race had incomparably sharp teeth, and they attacked Yao Xie’s army from all directions.

“Ji Ji Ji Ji!”

The insects let out sharp cries.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

Countless demonic beasts let out bloodthirsty roars as they charged towards the bugs.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Roar Roar Roar Roar!”

But very quickly, an incomparably miserable cry was heard.

“Boom!”

In that instant, the six devouring dragons had already rushed to the front of the countless demonic beasts, their bodies trembling.

Black soil appeared out of thin air, enveloping the void around a billion square kilometers.

An entire world was completely enveloped.

Within this one billion square kilometers, illusory insects filled the area.

Divine Ability Space!

The six devouring dragons used their divine ability space the moment they appeared!

The strongest attack.

“Roar!”

When the space enveloped this area, the six devouring dragons charged into the group of demons.

With their enormous bodies and terrifying claws, all the demons within a hundred million square kilometers around them instantly suffered a terrifying attack.

“Ao ao ao!”

“Ao ao ao AO!”

Under their attacks, the demonic beasts did not have any strength left to resist. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Pu Pu Pu!”

The dozens of divine emperors at the front were specially taken care of by a devouring dragon. Its sharp claws swept past them and directly cut them in half. Destructive energy rushed into their bodies!

“AO AO!”

An incomparably miserable cry sounded. It sounded abnormally miserable.

“Ji Ji Ji Ji!”

All the attacks seemed to have just begun. The divine ability space was formed. The Earth and darkness elemental laws condensed into a bug race that covered the sky and covered the earth.

In an instant, the number of bugs formed by the Earth and darkness elemental laws seemed to be even greater than that of Yao Xie.

The difference in numbers seemed to be reversed immediately.

“Roar Roar Roar Roar!”

Miserable cries resounded throughout the entire void space.

“Heehee Heehee!”

“Roar Roar Roar!”

When the two leaders, Yao Xie Xie Jie, saw this scene, a trace of fear appeared on their faces.

Yao Xie Jie waved his claws, and one by one, traces of darkness formed as he attacked a devouring dragon.

Evil Sprite raised its head, two huge fangs, flashing golden light, metal condensed into its own shadow, also towards a devouring dragon attack.

“Ho ho ho!”

The two devourer dragons that were attacked stared, their sharp claws slashing directly at their attacks.

“Boom Boom!”

“Boom Boom!”

The sounds of collision rang out. Without any hesitation, they locked onto the two leaders and charged forward.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

From the side, two more devouring dragons turned their gazes towards the two leaders. Their eyes were filled with ferocity and fury as they charged forward.

“Let’s kill these beasts first before we help them kill the two leaders!”

The remaining two devouring dragons roared as they swept their eyes over the other billions of demonic beasts. Their eyes were filled with disdain.

“Roar Roar!”

They charged towards the demonic god Emperors.

The terrifying aura and overwhelming strength caused the demonic god Emperors to tremble. Their eyes were filled with fear.
