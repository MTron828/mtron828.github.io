Chapter 372: Whale Kun

CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Kun was one of the five strongest and most fearsome monsters in the universe.

Its body could grow to over a few thousand miles. When in the water they could swim. When in the air, they could transform into a roc and fly. It was truly an existence feared by many.

Kun were bred to be warring creatures by the Ancient God race, one of the most elite races in the universe.

The breeding and nurturing of Kun was also the core secret in the Ancient God race and their biggest reliance.

Lan Qingyue’s eyes were filled with excitement as she stared at the blue whale that was swimming above the dragon palace.

“The breeding of a Kun will require a great amount of energy. From birth till it grows to a few thousand miles in size, the amount of energy required is beyond imagination. In the breeding of Kun, the most important aspects would be energy extraction and bloodline refining. The more the Kun eats, the faster its power could grow. Therefore, a Kun is also commonly referred to as a Devouring Kun.”

“A blue whale needs to consume four to eight tons of food each day. This amount of energy is just sufficient for its daily usage and doesn’t include the extraction of energy and refining the blood of what it consumed. Moreover, the bloodline of the blue whale is very pure. It does not possess any tinge of bloodline from strong races and therefore won’t face the same limits that were imposed in some bloodlines. Through the Arts of Kun breeding, it can grow into an exceptionally powerful Kun in the future!”

Lan Qingyue mumbled to herself as she stared hard at the blue whale. Her eyes were shimmering with a strange glow and she seemed capable of seeing through the blue whale.

“Let’s try breeding it!”

Lan Qingyue looked at the dragon blood in the Dragon Transforming Pool and was filled with excitement. Soon after, she left the Dragon Palace through the Southern Gate.

Lan Qingyue was fast and she faced no resistance in the water. She had a mysterious aura around her and this made her, who was already beautiful, even more elegant.

Oooooo!

When Lan Qingyue approached the blue whale, the gigantic blue whale seemed to have felt something. It turned its gigantic head towards Lan Qingyue instantly.

Oooooo!

The blue whale ejected a stream of bubbles from its blowhole. It wanted to be closer to Lan Qingyue using its head as it could feel a sense of familiarity and closeness with her.

Lan Qingyue smiled when she saw this. As an Ancient God Kun Breeder, she had a disposition about her that made all beasts feel close to her.

“The energy in the blue whale is comparable to an Inborn expert. However, it did not activate it. As a result, even though it has an enormous body, it is still very weak!” Lan Qingyue said softly as she places her hands onto the blue whale’s body.

A drop of blood from her hand landed on the blue whale’s head. Immediately, a stream of decadent and greyish energy started flowing from Lan Qingyue’s hand and encompassed the entire whale.

Oooooo!

The blue whale was swaying its body slightly, causing turbulence in the water. Within his body, huge transformations were ongoing.

The skeletal structure of the blue whale wasn’t very strong. As the greyish energy flowed into its body, its body started to decay fast.

Its bones, flesh, organs, and skin started to be mortified.

The energy in its bones, flesh, organs, and skin were extracted and this enormous amount of energy flowed into the blue whale’s blood.

Its blood was being refined rapidly and the red and viscous blood started to emit a faint glow.

Soon after, the glowing blood started to flow throughout the blue whale’s body.

The whole process lasted for about an hour and the blue whale’s skin now looked tougher.

A decadent scent could be picked up instantly.

It was just like a zombie that had died a few thousand years ago.

“Breeding Kun has some similarities with zombies!” Lan Qingyue exclaimed as she witnessed the drastic changes happening to the whale.

Zombies were simply from the corpses of ordinary people. When one died, it could be transformed into an invincible zombie through special rituals.

The current conditions of the blue whale were similar to a zombie, but also had differences. The whale still possessed strong intelligence and vitality.

Ancient God Kun Breeder had been making use of such tough methods to breed a creature with a normal bloodline into an exceptionally strong Kun.

“The strength of the blue whale is now only at the Inborn Realm. I will get some dragon blood from Xiao Xian later. In this way, I can raise the level of the blue whale to Level 11!”

Lan Qingyue squinted her eyes. Through this, she would be able to help Xiao Xian in the future.

Oooooo!

“Master!”

At this moment, the blue whale which was beside Lan Qingyue let out a soft moan.

“Alright! It seems like you have fully received the cultivation arts of Kun. From now onwards, I shall be calling you Xiao Lan!” Lan Qingyue said to the blue whale with a bright smile.

“Yes, master!” Xiao Lan nodded its head and replied. Its gigantic body remained behind Lan Qingyue as a display of deference.

“Xiao Xian is awake! You can just hang around here now!”

Lan Qingyue looked in the direction of the Dragon Palace and saw Wang Xian. The next instant, she went over to the Dragon King Hall rapidly.

“Xiao Xian!”

“What’s the matter, Qingyue?”

Wang Xian knew Lan Qingyue had woken up as he did not see Lan Qingyue when he opened his eyes. He then started to scrutinize her from head to toe.

“Hehe, I’m fine!”

Lan Qingyue pounced into the embrace of Wang Xian ecstatically. “Xiao Xian, I have reached the Dan Realm currently after accepting the inheritance of the Ancient God race. Look there! Xiao Xian, that is Xiao Lan, my first Kun!” She pointed at the blue whale which was outside the Dragon Palace as she spoke.

“Is it?”

Wang Xian was astonished! She could start breeding a Kun right after accepting the inheritance of the Ancient God race. These Ancient God Kun Breeders were indeed terrifying!

“Yeah. Xiao Lan is now in the Inborn Realm. It also has a strong defense, so strong that even Dan Realm creatures couldn’t injure it. Xiao Xian, can you give me some dragon blood? With it, I can strengthen it to Level 11!” Lan Qingyue remarked with a sense of accomplishment.

“You could bring it to Level 11 with just some dragon blood?”

Wang Xian was dumbfounded. This speed of leveling was a little insane!

“Yeah!” Lan Qingyue nodded her head heavily.

“Alright! Follow me! I’ll go get some for you!” Wang Xian nodded his head. After which, he carried Lan Qingyue as he flew towards the Dragon Transforming Pool.

“How much do you need?” Wang Xian looked at the dragon blood inside the pool and asked with a bright smile.

There was lots of dragon blood in the pool but the dragon blood was just Level 11.

The level of the blood was dependent on the blood of the creatures it was absorbed from. The stronger the creatures, the higher the level of the refined dragon blood.

“About a thousand catties will suffice!” Lan Qingyue said with a smile. The next moment, she waved her arm and extracted a stream of dragon blood.

Wang Xian nodded his head. A thousand catties of dragon blood wasn’t much. The Dragon Transformation Pool had over ten tons of dragon blood.

These were the refined products of the corpses and blood of creatures that had previously attacked the Dragon Palace.

“Let’s go! I’ll like to take a look at the Kun you are breeding!”

Wang Xian and Lan Qingyue moved and arrived beside the blue whale.

With a wave of her arm, Lan Qingyue directed the dragon blood she extracted previously into the body of the blue whale directly.
