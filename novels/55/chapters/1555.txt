Ling Jian ‘ER’s face turned pale. She had never thought that there would be such a terrifying darkness soul hidden in the middle.

That destructive and violent energy made her feel extremely small.

A sense of despair appeared on her face.

“Weng!”

At this moment, the darkness soul moved and her body trembled.

“Boom!”

However, at this moment, a black shadow suddenly flashed before her eyes. Following that, the ferocious and terrifying darkness soul vanished.

“What’s going on?”

Her eyes widened, filled with disbelief.

“Shadow?”

She muttered as she thought of the white figure from not too long ago.

“Could it be?”

“Junior sister Jian ‘er, quickly pluck the sword heart grass away. Quick, quick, a team is about to break through!”

At this moment, Bing Jinghuan’s anxious voice came from behind.

Ling Jian ‘er suddenly reacted and hurriedly reached out to grab the sword heart grass.

She directly stored it into her interspatial ring.

“Not good, the sword heart grass has been taken away by that woman!”

When Ling Jian ‘er rushed towards the center, everyone around her had been paying attention to her.

When they saw the sword heart grass being taken away, all of their faces were extremely ugly.

The sword heart grass of the eighth level of the profound void tier was comparable to a pill of the seventh level of the profound void tier.

Only the three super powers had pills of this level.

This was a huge treasure to second-rate forces and even third-rate powers.

A black veil heart fruit of the seventh level of the profound void tier was already so important to the crown prince of Wuqing City, let alone a spirit grass of the eighth level of the profound void tier.

“Junior sister Jian ‘er, let’s leave immediately!”

Bing Jinghuan saw Ling Jian ‘er flying over, and his face revealed an excited expression as he shouted loudly.

As long as they obtained these three sword heart grasses, it would be worth it to enter the Black Curtain Garden.

Moreover, their acquisition of the sword heart grasses had been seen by the surrounding thousands of people. They could not stay in the black curtain garden anymore.

Otherwise, they would definitely be attacked by others.

“Alright!”

Ling Jian ‘er nodded her head heavily and did not stop as she fled towards the exit.

“We are also preparing to retreat!”

Bing Jing Huan shouted at his subordinates and prepared to escape from the attacks of the Darkness Souls.

“How can it be so easy to leave!”

A wind attribute cultivator suddenly moved and three darkness souls chased after him.

His figure flickered, and he led the darkness souls to Bing Jing Huan and the others on their way out.

“Damn Fellow, you dare to provoke our Bingxin dynasty? I think you want to Die!”

Bing Jing Huan and the others roared in anger when they saw that someone was deliberately trying to trip them up.

“Haha, so what if it’s the Bingxin dynasty? !”

The Old Man in black robes, who was covered in black robes, laughed loudly without any fear.

These first-rate forces wore black robes in order to compete with the first-rate forces and even the three super forces for the spirit herbs.

This way, they wouldn’t be afraid of being retaliated against.

“Junior sister Jian ‘er, you should leave first. Once you leave the Black Screen Garden, there will be experts from our iceheart empire protecting you!”

“You want to snatch the treasures from our Iceheart Empire? Dream On!”

A cold voice sounded out from Bing Jing Huan’s mouth. Ling Jian ‘er nodded his head and did not dare to hesitate as he flew towards the exit.

“All of you, go chase after her and snatch the sword heart grass from her hands!”

“We can not let her leave. As long as we obtain the three sword heart grass, everything will be worth it!”

At the surrounding area, a few of the team leaders gritted their teeth and chased after Ling Jian ‘ER.

“Ahhhh!”

In an instant, when some people gave up on the battle with the Darkness Soul, the battle that was originally evenly matched was immediately destroyed by the Darkness Soul.

A miserable shriek sounded out.

“Damn it, retreat! There are some experts chasing after the ice heart dynasty’s women. We Aren’t a match for these darkness souls!”

Some teams that weren’t confident of obtaining the sword heart grass only wanted to obtain some low grade spirit herbs.

Seeing this situation, their expressions became extremely ugly.

They hurriedly retreated out of the deep valley, their expressions changing as they looked towards the place where Ling Jian ‘ER had escaped to.

“Damn it, let’s go, we’ll also fish in troubled waters!”

A few of the teams said with ugly expressions, directly chasing after Ling Jian ‘ER.

Since they could not obtain the low-grade spirit herbs, they would see if they could obtain the three sword heart grass.

In an instant, more than 200 people chased after Ling Jian ‘er.

This made the people from the Bingxin Empire look extremely embarrassed.

“Run!”Ling Jian ‘er felt the people chasing after her and her expression was a little embarrassed.

This group of people would definitely not let go of her bingxin empire’s background for the sake of the three sword heart herbs.

“These guys!”

Wang Xian followed behind Ling Jian ‘ER and swept his gaze across the more than 200 people chasing after them.

However, with their speed, it would be difficult for them to catch up to Ling Jian ‘ER.

Wang Xian didn’t make a move either. He wouldn’t make a move unless Ling Jian ‘er was in danger.

“This woman is so fast. We can’t catch up to her at all!”

“We’ll reach the exit in an hour at most. We won’t be able to catch up to her!”

Some of them looked embarrassed when they saw Ling Jian ‘ER’s speed.

Some teams immediately stopped. Once Ling Jian ‘er charged out, there would be experts from the bingxin empire protecting them. If they charged out, they would only be killed by the experts from the Bingxin Empire.

However, to the surprise of many people, three teams did not stop. They continued to lock onto Ling Jian ‘ER’s figure with excitement in their eyes.

“Two days ago, a divine tree appeared at the Divine Kingdom’s ruins, the Black Water Divine Lake. Experts from the super powers and a few first-rate forces have rushed over. There might not be experts from the Bingxin Empire at the entrance!”

These three teams had only entered the black screen garden for a day, so they had some understanding of the situation outside.

With the appearance of the divine tree in the Black Water God Lake, a group of powerful forces immediately rushed over. At this moment, there might not be any experts from the Iceheart Empire at the entrance.

Hence, they did not give up.

The three teams followed closely behind Ling Jian ‘er, who was 2,000 meters behind her.

Ling Jian ‘er felt the speed behind her and heaved a sigh of relief. The exit was right in front of her.

She could protect the three sword heart grass!

Wang Xian followed behind her.

Buzz

Ling Jian ‘ER flew out with a smile on her face. She immediately looked towards the direction of the Bingxin Empire.

“Damn it. The Blackwater God lake has been completely sealed off by the three super forces and a group of first-rate forces. We can’t enter at all. How overbearing!”

“The people of the Bingxin dynasty are indeed powerful. They killed two experts of the seventh level of the profound void stage on the spot!”

“It’s our fault for being weak. Hehe!”

Right then, voices suddenly came from the front.

The voices came from the people in black robes.

When she looked at the Bingxin dynasty, she found that there were no experts of the Bingxin dynasty there.

Even the experts from the superpowers and the other first-rate powers weren’t there!

This caused Ling Jian ‘er to be slightly startled, and she couldn’t help but feel alarmed and flustered.
