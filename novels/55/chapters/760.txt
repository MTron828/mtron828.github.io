Chapter 761: Mighty Empress 0762(4/5)

Translator: 549690339

In one night, Wang Xian was thrown out twice. This made him extremely embarrassed.

Fortunately, it was Shu Qing who took over his body in the morning. She walked out of the room with Wang Xian happily!

“This place is so beautiful!”

When they arrived at the courtyard, Guan Shuqing looked around happily and exclaimed in surprise.

“This is the natural gate of immortality. During the year that you slept, the nine cauldrons world has already appeared. The area that we are in is the Tang cauldron!”

Wang Xian explained to Guan Shuqing.

“Celestial sect? It’s really like a Fairyland!”

Guan Shuqing raised her head and looked at her surroundings. There were all kinds of plants around her and she looked very beautiful.

“Dragon King, your breakfast!”

At this moment, Fairy Flower’s voice came from outside the door.

“HMM, come in!”

Wang Xian replied to her.

Fairy flower was holding some spirit fruits and vegetables that contained spiritual energy in her hands as she walked into the courtyard.

He was stunned when he saw Guan Shuqing.

She was dressed in fiery red clothes, had an exquisite face, and had a smile on her face. She was a beauty that was not inferior to him.

In fact, flower fairy felt that her temperament was far superior to his!

“It’s Here!”

Flower fairy placed her breakfast on the stone table at the side. She glanced at Wang Xian and Guan Shuqing and said, “Dragon King, our sect leader will bring you to the herb garden to have a look and discuss the matter of cooperation.”

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded. “I’ll be there soon!”

“Alright!”

Fairy Flower took her leave and Wang Xian and Shuqing ate breakfast together.

During the meal, Wang Xian briefly told Shuqing about the current world. This made her open her mouth slightly and a surprised expression appeared on her face.

After breakfast, Wang Xian went straight to the place where the queen of Flowers was staying.

“Dragon King, my wife has woken up. It seems that the wood spirit fruit is quite useful!”

The flower queen looked at Guan Shuqing and said in surprise.

“Yes, thank you!”

“No need. Dragon King, you have cured us of Changshu. To our immortal sect, a few grade-8 spirit fruits can’t compare to you!”

The flower queen shook her head. “Let’s go, Dragon King. I’ll bring you to the herb garden to take a look.”.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and followed the flower queen into the herb garden.

When he arrived at the herb garden of the natural born celestial sect, he was slightly stunned.

This was the largest herb garden he had ever seen. In the entire herb garden, there were at least tens of thousands of different types of spiritual herbs.

Apart from spiritual herbs, there were also spiritual trees.

It was not an exaggeration to say that the value of these herb gardens was simply immeasurable.

“As expected of the natural celestial sect that has the most spiritual herbs among all the celestial sects. It is no wonder that the four celestial immortals from the Holy Doctor Celestial sect and Holy Medicine Celestial sect came here personally!”

Wang Xian looked at this herb garden with a slight sigh. If the entire herb garden belonged to him and was refined into a medicinal pill, he might be able to complete the first change in the Divine Dragon realm directly.

For a moment, he even had the urge to rob!

“Haha, Dragon King, this is just our ordinary herb garden. The place where the Grade-7 and grade-8 spiritual herbs are planted is in a different location!”

The supreme elder of the innate immortal sect, elder Mu, said with a face full of pride.

This was the accumulation of their sect for a thousand years.

“Looks like I will need a branch that can serve the evergreen tree before I leave!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. He walked to the side and swept his gaze across the spiritual herbs. “Elder mu, how many spiritual herbs do you plan to take out?”

“Two-thirds. We need to keep some for emergencies. The rest will be used to refine pills!”

Elder Mu looked at Wang Xian. “Even if it’s two-thirds, it’s still a considerable amount. How long will it take for the Dragon King to refine it?”

“Very soon!”

The corners of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly. He waved his arm and twenty-five grade-5 spiritual herbs flew into his hand instantly.

He smiled at elder Mu and the rest. Wang Xian spread out his hands and a water curtain appeared in front of him.

Following that, the spiritual herbs melted rapidly.

He stared at the drops of liquid with his sharp eyes and quickly assembled and condensed them.

“Condense!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

With a wave of his arm, five Grade-5 medicinal pills appeared in front of him instantly. The entire process took less than two minutes!

Elder Mu, Hua Houhou, and the other three celestials by the side opened their mouths slightly. Shock was written all over their faces.

“Amazing, amazing! It will take at least twenty minutes for the old man peony from the true martial immortal academy to Refine A level five medicinal pill. Furthermore, it might not even be a hundred percent success rate!”

“Even with the help of the alchemy furnace from the Holy Medicine Immortal sect, they don’t have such a fast speed and success rate!”

Elder Mu looked at Wang Xian and said with a sigh.

Although the innate immortal sect had more spiritual herbs, they couldn’t refine medicinal pills. Even if they were to find someone else to refine them, they wouldn’t be as insane as Wang Xian.

The few immortals from the natural born immortal sect looked at each other and decided that they would befriend this Dragon King in the future!

“HMPH!”

At this moment, a soft snort came from the side.

A slender and fair palm waved forward and spiritual herbs flew over.

The spiritual herbs that flew over turned into liquid under the encirclement of the flames.

The pair of slender and fair arms rippled slightly. The spiritual liquid condensed into medicinal pills and fell into the palm.

Elder Mu was stunned.

The Queen of Flowers was stunned.

The other three celestials were also stunned.

Even Wang Xian was staring at the medicinal pills in his hand with his mouth agape.

Grade-6 medicinal pills, five grade-6 medicinal pills.

From the moment he took them out to the moment they fell into his hand, the entire process had turned into medicinal pills.

Just now, Wang Xian was still acting pretentious as he refined a grade-5 medicinal pill in less than two minutes with his water refining technique.

Now, Guan Shuqing, no, she should be a woman named Feng Luan. She refined a grade-6 medicinal pill in less than half a minute.

It was obvious who was superior and who was inferior. It was as though she had completely defeated Wang Xian.

This caused his expression to turn slightly ugly.

He knew that this woman was deliberately provoking him.

“This... this... Your Wife’s alchemy skills are so strong. She can actually refine pills so quickly without using an alchemy furnace!”

Elder Mu looked at the pill in Guan Shuqing’s hand with a face full of shock, feeling somewhat incredulous.

In addition to her terrifying alchemy skills, elder Mu felt a powerful flame energy from the moment she made her move.

This energy made him feel apprehensive.

A middle-level immortal was at least a middle-level immortal, and it was possible that he was a superior-level immortal.

This made elder mu slightly shocked.

No wonder he was not afraid of the Holy Medicine Immortal sect and the Holy Doctor Immortal sect at all. Just their strength alone was enough for him to not be afraid of them.

“Hehe, it’s fine, it’s fine!”

Wang Xian looked at the flame flickering between his brows and the majestic Feng Luan. He smiled awkwardly.

“Dragon King, we have complete confidence in your strength. I believe that our cooperation will definitely be able to monopolize the entire Elixir Market!”

Elder mu said to Wang Xian with a smile.

“Don’t Worry!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and looked at the majestic Feng Luan beside him. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

He was just thinking that it would be troublesome if he were to refine so many elixirs on his own.

Now it seemed that there were laborers!
