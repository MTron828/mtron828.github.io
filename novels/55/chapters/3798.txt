3799 3798 ancient god Feed Kun Lord

“Actually, there’s no need to worry too much. From the looks of it, the angel race and the Phoenix race will be completely suppressed. We might be able to hide a little.”

When the Royal’s voice rang out, everyone pursed their lips, their faces filled with astonishment.

It wasn’t very harmful!

It was very insulting!

What did he mean by the difference being too great?

What did he mean by there might not be a problem?

Did he mean that the angel race and Phoenix race would be completely suppressed?

However, looking at the current situation, it seemed to be the same.

The legendary ancient god Feeding Kun Lord had three Kun that could contend against a ruler at the eighth rank.

Such resistance?

The strength of the Angel Race and Phoenix race was indeed able to contend against three rulers at the eighth rank with all their trump cards.

But this confrontation was only temporary!

The two phoenixes of the angel race forcefully increased the strength of the third Prince’s offensive treasure.

Although it could contend against a ruler of the eighth rank, how long could it last?

A month? Two months?

Or perhaps a year?

But one had to know that apart from the three Kun, there was also the ancient god Feeding Kun Lord!

The ancient god Feeding Kun Lord’s strength was also at this level!

Most importantly, the legendary ancient god kun-master was an existence that was besieged by the three peak races!

Their strength was only comparable to an ordinary ruler at the eighth rank?

This was obviously impossible!

The legendary ancient god kun-master definitely had a terrifying strength that far surpassed an ordinary level!

“This… how is this possible?”

“How is this possible?”

At the same time, the third prince, the Azure River Water Phoenix, as well as the experts of the Angel Race and Phoenix race, saw the three Kun that surrounded them.

They looked at Lan Qingyue and the legendary ancient god Feeding Kun master.

They felt this terrifying strength, and their faces were filled with shock and disbelief.

The strength of a ruler at the eighth rank.

The battle prowess of four rulers at the 8th rank.

And they were the terrifying existences of the legends!

How could they fight?

As they looked at the sealed space and felt this terrifying pressure, their bodies began to tremble violently.

How could this be?

“Shit!”

“We’re finished, we’re finished!”

The faces of the Angels and Phoenixes at the 7th rank changed drastically, their eyes filled with fear and shock.

What should they do?

What should they do?

They were doomed!

Once they started fighting, they would definitely not be their opponents.

If they continued fighting, they would die!

They would die!

The Gap was too big!

They were merely existences at level eight who relied on their trump cards to forcefully increase their strength. It was fake.

As for the opponents, they were real! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Hehe, third prince, Green River Water Phoenix, you two aren’t naive enough to think that I would be waiting for you guys to attack me just by relying on the strength that I displayed, right?”

“I would be foolish enough to wait for you guys to kill me, right?”

Wang Xian stared at them with a face full of mockery. His eyes slowly revealed a look of disdain.

Wang Xian had walked from Earth to here step by step. He wouldn’t be careless in any way!

Those who thought that he was careless would eventually become dead people!

The third Prince and Green River Water Phoenix in front of him were the same.

“You two idiots!”

Wang Xian looked at their extremely ugly expressions and mocked them.

When the third prince and the Green River Water Phoenix heard his words, their bodies trembled violently and their eyes were bloodshot!

“I’m giving all of you from the Angel tribe, the Phoenix tribe, a chance to live. Come, third prince, Green River Water Phoenix. Haven’t the two of you been trying to destroy me?”

“Today, I’m giving you a chance. The two of you attack me, and I’ll fight you two alone. If you can defeat me, I’ll release all of you.”

Wang Xian stared at them and continued to speak indifferently!

“F * ck!”

“Hiss, the Dragon King is awesome. He wants to fight the third prince and Green River Water Phoenix of the Angel of light alone? This is a blatant provocation!”

“It’s very insulting. It will be interesting if they don’t dare to accept the Challenge!”

“Hahaha, if they don’t dare to accept the challenge, then the Angel clan and the Phoenix clan will lose a lot of face.”

“Dragon King: Haven’t you always wanted to destroy them? Well, I’ll give you a chance. Now, you can join hands to attack me and defeat me. You can live.”

“It’s very insulting. This is going to be interesting. With the strength that the Dragon King has displayed, how can the third prince fight with the Green River Water Phoenix like this? Unless they still have a trump card!”

When the surrounding strong disciples heard Wang Xian’s words, they widened their eyes and couldn’t help but discuss among themselves.

Humiliating, one-on-one!

Did you guys dare to do it?

“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, don’t go too far!”

The Water Phoenix of the Green River stared at Wang Xian and said.

“Haha, you’re saying that I’m going too far. How interesting. You Want to kill me, but I’m here now, and you’re saying that I’m bullying you. You’re relying on the strength behind you. Alright then, I’m also relying on the strength of the Dragon Palace now. Shall we fight it out?”

“Besides, I’m a man of my word. If you can defeat me, I’ll release all of you. TSK TSK, come and fight it out with me. If you do, the powerhouses in your clan might be able to survive.”

“But if you don’t, none of you will be able to leave!”

After Wang Xian finished his last sentence, his eyes were filled with coldness and coldness.

“Huff Huff!”

The Green River Phoenix’s breathing was a little hurried.

At this moment, the phoenixes around her looked at her in silence.

At the third Prince’s side, the powerhouses from the Angel tribe were also looking at him.

It was obvious that they had an opinion!

They had been forced into a desperate situation!

“Burn all your life force and give it a try!”

A fire phoenix stared at the Green River Water Phoenix and said faintly!

His words made the Green River Water Phoenix’s wings tremble and its claws slowly clenched!

“Good, good. Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, let us try your current strength!”

The Green River Water Phoenix flapped its wings slightly and the wings on its body slowly began to burn.

This was consuming her life force!

“Whoosh!”

The third Prince also stood out. With a wave of his arm, a spear appeared in his hand, and a crown appeared above his head!

Golden Light was flowing on the wings!

Three innate supreme treasures.

His aura rose!

But at this moment, his expression was extremely ugly.

His Angel Army, the strongest five battle angels who were at the seventh level of the ruler realm, had all turned into energy.

If he didn’t exhaust them, he still had a chance.

Now, the Green River Water Phoenix might have to exhaust its life force!

“Hehe, very good. At least you guys aren’t cowards. Let me see your strength and your ability to be arrogant!”

Wang Xian moved his body and four ghost clones instantly attacked the third prince and the Green River Water Phoenix.

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

The Green River Water Phoenix and the third Prince Roared and attacked the ghost clones.

“The Dragon King is obviously teasing and humiliating them!”

An expert of the Netherworld race who was at level seven shook his head.
