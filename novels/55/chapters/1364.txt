Chapter 1365: 1365 Dragon Palace, Battle

“We surrender, we surrender!”

“Don’t Kill Us, we surrender!”

The East Gate of the dragon-phoenix Imperial city was wide open.

The people who poured out of the dragon-phoenix imperial city shouted at the armies of the Three Kingdoms.

“HMM? Only tens of thousands of people?”

However, to the surprise of the star-moon king and the others, only 40,000 to 50,000 people escaped from the dragon-phoenix imperial city to surrender.

“Although the number of people is relatively small, they are all elites!”

The Southern Cloud King at the side swept his gaze across the group of people who had come out to surrender, his face full of smiles.

Most of these people were quite strong, and it seemed that their living conditions were not bad either.

If these people were placed in a city, they would be considered elites!

Feng Luan looked at the 40,000 to 50,000 people who had left and heaved a sigh of relief. Only 40,000 to 50,000 people had left in the nick of time, and she was still rather gratified!

“It’s the queen who gave us a safe and stable home. We’re willing to fight for this home!”

At this moment, an old man shouted loudly with a flushed face.

“We’re willing to fight for this home!”

“We’re willing to fight for our home!”

“We’re willing to fight for our Queen!”

In the city, the citizens roared with passion.

They had all come from unstable and unsafe places to the Dragon and Phoenix Empire.

Here, they enjoyed a stable life, and their children enjoyed a good education.

They did not need to be afraid, and they did not need to live in fear.

This was where they truly belonged.

Wandering around?

Why not fight for their home, even if it meant death! Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Even if it meant becoming slaves! They had to fight for their home!

“A bunch of idiots. Three dynasties besieging and the Fourth Dynasty coming soon. Even the general has run away. You Idiots still want to fight for your home. Just wait for Death!”

“Hehe, that’s why they are poor and stupid. It Won’t be long before they are killed and all the women become slaves!”

Hearing the voices behind them, the faces of those who had escaped from the dragon-phoenix Empire turned extremely grim.

They had just learned that the dragon-phoenix Empire had a powerful formation and a good living environment. They had just established their empire and were here to settle down and earn spirit stones.

Now that the dragon-phoenix Empire was about to be destroyed, they were afraid of death and had no sense of belonging at all. Thus, they left immediately.

“Alright. Today, we will fight for the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty. Trust me!”

Feng Luan looked at the people behind her who were willing to fight for the dragon and Phoenix dynasty. Her eyes were filled with determination as she said to Wang Xian who was beside her, “I also trust your Lord Wang!”

“Close the city gates!”

Wang Xian turned around and glanced at the people behind him.

These were the citizens of Feng Luan, but their faces were very cute!

He ordered the soldiers at the city gates to close them.

“Good, good. A bunch of stupid things. I’ll give you a chance to live, but you don’t cherish it. All the Star Moon Empire soldiers, get ready. Kill!”

“Don’t hold back. Kill!”

“Get ready to attack!”

“Get ready to attack!”

The Star Moon King, the Southern Cloud King, and the Wind Howl King all gave orders at the east gate!

“Kill! Kill! Kill!”

Clang! Clang! Clang

Roar! Roar! Roar

The sky-shaking killing, the cold sound of weapons, and the roar of mounts all sounded at the same time.

The wind and clouds changed, and war broke out!

“All the soldiers of the dragon and Phoenix Dynasty, welcome the Battle!”

Feng Luan said coldly!

“Fight, I’m Invincible!”

The soldiers roared.

“Charge!”

The three void interpretation experts stood in the air and roared.

On both sides, the military flags of the three empires were waved!

“Charge!”

Four hundred thousand soldiers attacked directly from two kilometers away.

“It’s up to you!”

Feng Luan looked at the army charging over, looked at Wang Xian, and said.

Wang Xian smiled confidently and raised his arm slowly. “All citizens of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, float in the sky and take a good look at this battle!”

“All of you will be proud of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire. You will be proud of your choices. In the future, all of you will be the best!”

A powerful and confident voice covered the entire dragon and Phoenix Empire. This stunned the more than ten million people in the Dragon and Phoenix Empire!

“Young Master Wang, are you going to show your Trump Card?”

The civil officials and generals around Wang Xian looked at him with flickering eyes. A strong sense of hope was revealed in their eyes.

“With Sir Wang around, we are invincible!”

“We believe in Sir Wang. Fly into the sky!”

When the citizens of Shenghai town heard Wang Xian’s words, they flew into the sky in excitement.

“He actually wants us to watch the battle. What ability does this Lord Wang have?”

The eyes of the rest of the citizens flickered as they looked at the confident and arrogant figure.

Anyone who had reached the transcendence level would fly into the sky.

When they had just flown up, they saw an army of 400,000 charging over and 40 insightful void martial artists lined up neatly in the sky.

Their faces turned pale, and their bodies trembled!

“Can we win?”

Everyone from the dragon-phoenix Empire gulped, clenching their fists tightly.

“The dragon-phoenix Empire is finished? Defend, what can we use to defend?”

“Luckily we came out, otherwise, it would be over!”

Outside, the citizens who had surrendered from the dragon-phoenix Empire looked at the terrifying army, saying.

“With a single charge, we will break through the city!”

The three fourth-level profound void martial stage powerhouses were floating in the air above the 400,000-STRONG Army.

They stared at the front with awe-inspiring eyes and said confidently.

“Disciples of the Dragon Palace, destroy them. Leave No one alive!”

Wang Xian sensed the tens of millions of people from the dragon and Phoenix Empire floating in the sky behind him and smiled.

He looked ahead. When the 400,000-strong army arrived more than 1,000 meters in front of him, he let out a soft shout.

“Roar!”

“Roar!”

“Heaven’s eye, Wind Dragon Illusion Arrow!”

The moment Wang Xian’s voice fell, roars and cold voices rang out in the surrounding area.

A power that was as wild as the wilderness charged directly from the front and the left and right.

The terrifying whistling sound caused the hearts of the 400,000 strong army to tremble!

This whistling sound was accompanied by the majesty of a Divine Dragon.

“Eh?”

The expressions of the Star Moon King, Southern Cloud King, and Wind Howl King changed slightly as they hurriedly looked around.

Just from the sound, they knew that the owner of the sound was extraordinary!

“What fast arrows, block them!”

However, they suddenly saw arrows that were like wind dragons attacking them.

The three of them changed their expressions slightly and said hurriedly.

“Eh?”

The expressions of the other nearly forty insightful emptiness realm experts shot out icy cold expressions as they directly blocked the arrows.

“Not good, the power of that arrow is so terrifying!”

However, at this moment, the expression of an insightful emptiness realm second stage expert changed drastically as he looked at the flowing light-like wind dragon illusory arrow in horror.

“Roar!”

The Wind Dragon Arrow rushed to the front of the 400,000-strong army, as it let out a roar.

This was Mou Zesen’s aspect arrow.

“Roar, Boom!”

The terrifying attack landed in the midst of the Wind Howl Empire’s army, instantly killing 30,000 to 40,000 soldiers!

“Brothers, leave the Wind Howl Empire to us, Kill!”

A cold voice sounded out in the sky!
