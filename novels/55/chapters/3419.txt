“There’s no resistance at all. Looks like the Thunder Ray race might have guessed that we have experts here!”

“They’re not stupid. They should have guessed something. But that’s good too. As long as we suppress them in the grotto-heaven blessed land, it’s enough!”

“Hmph, I was hoping that the Thunder Ray race would court death and attack us.”

Inside the Thunder Ray race, a group of experts from the four major forces entered the inner area.

Their gazes swept the surroundings.

The entire inner area of the Thunder Ray race was filled with empty buildings. There wasn’t a single person.

This caused the experts from the great thunderclap academy to feel slightly displeased.

At this time, if the thunder ray race were to ambush them, it would be what they wanted to see the most.

Because as long as they made a move, the lord above would also make a move.

“Continue. Right now, everyone from the Lightning race should be holed up in their main hall. There are three connected paradises there.”

The Great Thunderclap Academy’s headmaster shouted in a low voice and they continued to advance.

And when the Great Thunderclap Academy entered the interior of the Lightning race, the forces from the outside world, as well as the Lightning Race’s patriarch and the others in the main hall, also received the news.

In front of the main hall, all the powerful disciples of the Thunder Ray race gathered here.

They stared at the scene in front of them with cold faces.

“Clan leader, the only thing we need to confirm now is whether there are powerful experts hidden in the black cloud above the Great Thunderclap Academy.”

The grand elder of the Thunder Ray race stared at the Black Cloud in the picture.

According to the detection methods of the Thunder Ray race, the moment they entered here, the four major forces were in their sight.

What was different from before was that there was a black cloud above the four great powers.

This black cloud was also a place that the Thunder light race was apprehensive about.

They had to find out if there was a universe ruler level one great being within the black cloud.

However, even if they were to investigate, they would still wait until the other party arrived to investigate.

Otherwise, what if there was a universe ruler level one being within the black cloud, and they went to attack?

They would never be able to return.

“Once the enemy arrives, we will launch an attack!”

The leader of the Thunder Light race shouted coldly.

Right now, the Army of the Thunder light race had yet to enter the blessed land. They were going to conduct a final test.

Before they were certain that the enemy had a universe ruler level being, they would not give up resisting.

Time passed by slowly. The four great powers rushed toward the Thunder Light Race’s main hall.

“The opponent is about to appear within the attack range. Once the opponent appears, attack with all your might.”

“We will attack the Black Cloud in the sky and directly unleash our strongest attack.”

The four great factions were getting closer and closer. The Lightning Race’s clan leader spoke to a group of disciples and a few grand elders as he ordered.

“Yes!”

The group of disciples immediately replied, and a few grand elders also nodded heavily.

“Hahaha, lightning race, you are really a bunch of trash. You actually cower here and don’t dare to come out!”

Before the voices of the four great factions could be heard, the voice of the Great Thunderclap Academy’s headmaster was transmitted over.

“Hehe, old bald donkey who is desperate. If it was just the four great factions, our lightning race would be able to exterminate you one by one!”

The Lightning Race’s clan leader stared ahead and roared with a face full of killing intent.

“Exterminate us? Then let’s see who will exterminate who!”

The Great Thunderclap Academy’s headmaster roared furiously.

“Attack!”

At this moment, the Lightning Race’s clan leader saw that the other party’s figure had already appeared within their attack range. He immediately roared loudly.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

All the members of the Lightning race did not hesitate at all. Countless amounts of energy poured forward.

The attack of the Lightning race’s leader had directly locked onto that Black Cloud!

“Kill!”

The Great Thunderclap Academy’s Headmaster roared with a face full of killing intent. The disciples of the four great factions immediately launched their attacks.

“HMPH!”

A cold snort came from within the black cloud. A terrifying energy directly swept forward.

This black energy was like a black wave, easily wiping out the attacks of the Thunder race leader and the others. It was still attacking them at a terrifying speed.

“Damn it! There are indeed universe masters! Retreat! All disciples, retreat into the grotto-heaven blessed land!”

The Thunder race leader roared with an abnormally ugly expression.

“Retreat!”

The other disciples of the Great Beings had already made their preparations. They immediately retreated.

“Ah Ah Ah!”

However, the speed of the black waves sweeping over was too terrifying. Some of the weaker disciples still did not have the time to dodge.

Screams of pain rang out. This time, more than 100,000 disciples of the Thunder Light race were killed or injured.

This was even under the condition that they were fully prepared.

A universe ruler with level one combat power was undefeatable to them!

“Damn it!”

The leader of the Thunder Light Race and the others looked extremely gloomy when they saw this scene. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Facing such a great being, they could only helplessly retreat.

Weng Weng

Just as they retreated into the grotto-heaven blessed land, the protective array of the grotto-heaven blessed land was immediately activated.

Following that, the attacks of the estate-heaven blessed land started to brew.

This was the final trump card of the Thunder Light race standing tall in the Thunder Cloud Domain.

A powerful defense that even a universe master level one great being would find difficult to break.

A powerful attack could kill a universe pinnacle great being.

“Humph!”

“Hiding so quickly? Thunder light race, you are really a bunch of trash!”

The city leader of Purple City shouted coldly.

“The Thunder light race will remember today’s grudge. And that great being hiding in the black cloud, you dare to attack us, but you don’t dare to reveal your identity?”? “A great being with the Combat Power of a universe ruler at level one, I didn’t expect you to be such a scumbag. How Ironic.”

The supreme elder of the Thunder Light Race said coldly, staring at the black cloud with a strong sense of mockery.

“That’s right. What BULLSH * t expert. He said that our thunder ray tribe is a cowardly turtle. What about you? You are so powerful yet you still don’t dare to walk on the road. You are really a coward. hahaha!”

An elder at the back seat also cursed.

Since they had already become enemies and the Thunder Ray tribe had been forced to such an extent, they had nothing to worry about.

The lightning race’s experts cursed, but there was no movement from the Black Cloud.

Those who could cultivate to such an extent were all old monsters who had a billion or so memories. They were all very thick-skinned.

Naturally, they wouldn’t take this little insult to heart.

Of course, only he himself knew whether he was angry or not.

“My lord, the defense of the Lightning race’s grotto-heaven blessed land shouldn’t be too strong. We can try to attack it!”

The Great Thunderclap Academy’s Headmaster’s gaze was cold as he cupped his hands toward Hei Yun.

If they could break through the Lightning Race’s defense, then they could save the treasures that could suppress this place.

“Alright!”

The voice from within Hei Yun sounded without the slightest hesitation.

Obviously, he had already felt the killing intent in his heart for the invective of the Thunder race.
