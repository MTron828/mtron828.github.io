“Huh? What’s the situation with the Mirage Sea mercenary group?”

“The leader of the Mirage Sea mercenary group is here personally. What is he trying to do by stopping those young men?”

When the surrounding people saw the leader of the Mirage Sea mercenary group blocking the entrance of the mercenary group and Wang Xian and the rest, they were bewildered.

Wang Xian stared at the leader of the Mirage Sea mercenary group. There was no expression on his face as he asked indifferently, “Why did the members of your mercenary group bump into us? Furthermore, they have the time to contact you guys!”

“I’m asking you a question!”

A cold glint flashed across the eyes of the leader of the illusionary sea mercenary group. His gaze was fixed on Wang Xian.

“I’m asking you a question too!”

Wang Xian stared at the old man without showing any signs of weakness.

This scene caused everyone around to be slightly stunned. Their faces were filled with astonishment.

“How dare they go against the illusionary sea mercenary group? What are their identities?”

“The illusionary sea mercenary group is a reputable group in our holy sea town. Not many people dare to provoke them. Who is that young man?”

Some people around looked at Wang Xian and the rest in astonishment.

Wang Xian had only been in holy sea town for less than half a month. Although there were a few sensational incidents, not many people knew him.

“Kid, I think you are courting death!”

A strong murderous intent shot out from the eyes of the leader of Huan Hai. In an instant, the surrounding air seemed to freeze.

“The person who is courting death is already dead!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly. With a flick of his finger, a corpse appeared on the ground.

The corpse was the middle-aged leader of the Mirage Sea mercenary group. At this moment, his eyes were wide open and filled with fear.

The corpse that appeared out of thin air stunned everyone.

This was especially so for the members of the Mirage Sea mercenary group. Their eyes were instantly bloodshot as they stared at the corpse on the ground with an extremely embarrassed expression.

Whoosh

Wang Xian waved his arm and kept the corpse back into his interspatial ring. A smile appeared on his face as he said, “Excuse me, please step aside!”

“Kid, I think you want to Die!”

An angry roar came from the leader of the Mirage Sea mercenary group. The members of the Mirage Sea mercenary group beside him also had cold expressions on their faces as they gripped their weapons tightly.

“Those who are looking for death are already dead. Those who want to die, I think they are going to die soon!”

Wang Xian stared coldly at the leader of the illusionary sea mercenary group and the rest of the members. They were going head-to-head with each other!

He did not show any signs of weakness.

“Hiss, what was that just now? That seems to be Xiu Hanshan’s corpse!”

“It can’t be. Xiu Hanshan, a level 5 extraordinaire, was killed!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“He is one of the only three level 5 extraordinaires in the illusionary sea mercenary group!”

When the surrounding people saw the corpse just now, they were shocked. They looked at Wang Xian and the rest in astonishment.

The atmosphere was a little tense.

“Get out of the way!”

Wang Xian looked at the group of people who were filled with killing intent and said coldly.

“Brat, just you wait. If I don’t kill you, I will have wasted my dozens of years in Shenghai Town!”

The leader of the illusory sea mercenary group, Xiu Qianshan, stared at Wang Xian coldly.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian smiled disdainfully and walked straight ahead.

The members of the Mirage Sea mercenary group opened a path and stared at all of them with bloodthirsty eyes.

“Who is that young man? Why is he so confident?”

“A three-star silver mercenary group, the Phoenix mercenary group. This is the first time I’ve heard of it!”

The surrounding people looked at the badges on Wang Xian and the rest and exclaimed in surprise.

“Three-star silver mercenary group?”

Xiu Qianshan’s gaze froze slightly.

“When Captain Han Shan replied with the communication stone plate, he said that the other party was only a two-star bronze-grade. Why did he suddenly become a three-star silver-grade?”

An old man from the Mirage Sea mercenary group said with a solemn expression.

A three-star silver-grade mercenary group must have an extraordinary level-five powerhouse. However, it was unbelievable for the other party to advance to three-star silver-grade so quickly.

Their Mirage Sea’s 5-star silver rank took more than 30 years.

With the level of the mercenary group, they could only advance after completing 10 missions of the same level.

However, if one mission failed, two mission points would be deducted.

Once they failed, the previous two successful missions would all be nullified.

Moreover, if a mercenary group failed too many times, they would lose their level.

This was also the reason why a five-star silver-grade mercenary group took more than 30 years.

For example, Wang Xian’s immortal Phoenix mercenary group was completely different. They possessed the combat strength of a level seven supernatural being. The average level five supernatural being would naturally increase their level very quickly.

At the later stages, their speed would slow down.

Of course, this was only relative. With the speed at which Wang Xian and the rest increased their strength, the immortal Phoenix mercenary group would soon reach the gold-grade.

After clashing with the Mirage Sea mercenary group, Wang Xian walked straight to the Celestial Phoenix Elixir and weapons workshop.

When he arrived at the entrance of the Celestial Phoenix shop, he realized that there was no one inside.

Yesterday, the threat from Dao Hen and the involvement of the Mirage Sea mercenary group made the mercenary group of Shenghai Town not dare to come to the Celestial Phoenix Elixir and weapons workshop to shop.

Today, the entire shop was completely empty.

“Young master, I didn’t expect it to be you. Would you like to buy some elixirs?”

When Wang Xian walked into the shop, the staff in front of him was slightly stunned and asked respectfully.

“Buy some elixirs. Where’s shopkeeper Liu?”

“Shopkeeper Liu is at the back. I’ll call for him immediately!”

A middle-aged man behind the counter said hurriedly and walked to the back quickly.

“Young master... are you going to buy some elixirs again?”

Shopkeeper Liu walked out and asked Wang Xian with a face full of anticipation.

“Yes, an elixir that costs 500,000 middle-grade spirit stones!”

Wang Xian nodded his head directly and took out the remaining heaven star grass and Heaven Billow grass after the mission. “Also, I have some Heaven Star Grass and Heaven Billow Grass in my hands. Please calculate the price!”

“Heaven Billow Grass?”

Manager Liu’s eyes lit up and revealed an excited look. “Young master, we are willing to buy it at 1.5 times the market price. Thank you, Young Master!”

Wang Xian waved his hand. “Change it into elixirs that can improve your cultivation!”

“Yes, yes!”

Manager Liu nodded his head quickly and his face was flushed.

It was another deal that was close to one million middle-rated spirit stones. Although it was far from the previous deal, it was still a huge deal.

Furthermore, after this deal ended, some of the elixirs in Shenghai town were about to run out of stock.

To buy 70% of the elixirs in the Fengxian Elixir and weapons workshop by himself, it was a terrifying thought.

“Young master, please take a look!”

Wang Xian received the elixirs that manager Liu handed over. After checking them, he was very satisfied.

Manager Liu was obviously not a short-sighted person. He had offered a huge discount on both purchases.

Wang Xian brought along a medicinal pill worth one million middle-grade spirit stones and walked towards his residence.

After digesting these medicinal pills, the strength of the strange demon and the Golden Swordfish could be improved considerably.

“This young master seems to be called Wang Xian. I don’t know why he helped our Fengxian medicinal pill and weapon workshop so much. His strength is really strong. He came twice and bought nine million medicinal pills.”

Shopkeeper Liu’s eyes flickered as he watched Wang Xian leave.

Ding! “Congratulations to host for advancing to a silver-level mercenary group. Activate the reward!”
