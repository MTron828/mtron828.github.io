A special sound came from the stomach of the leader of Cloud Valley.

Wang Xian controlled the hand of divine light to remove the bone corrosion poison with a calm expression.

“Leader of Cloud Valley, did you feel the increase in pain in your stomach?”

When the head of the pavilion saw this scene, he quickly asked the leader of Cloud Valley.

“No, the pain has actually lessened a lot. Young master, is it... is the bone corrosion poison being removed?”

The leader of the Cloud Valley revealed an excited expression and quickly asked Wang Xian.

“Don’t move recklessly. It will be over soon!”

Wang Xian said faintly and didn’t answer him. He looked a little cold and arrogant in the eyes of the people around him.

However, his cold expression showed respect in the eyes of the people around him.

“What a terrifying control. He didn’t use the powerful light energy to remove the poison in an instant. Instead, he used this precise control and used the power of light to envelop every bit of the power of darkness. Impressive!”

The hall master at the side stared at Wang Xian in astonishment. When he saw the bone corrosion poison in the stomach of Captain Yun gu being slowly removed, a look of astonishment appeared on his face.

An ordinary radiant priest would use the power of light directly to forcefully remove the poison in the other party’s body.

Once they encountered a slightly troublesome injury that involved the internal parts of the body and the vital parts of the head, they would be helpless.

This required an even more powerful radiant priest to control the power of light to heal them bit by bit. This required a strong control over the power of light.

The first type was very simple, but the second type was extremely difficult.

In terms of control, he felt that he was inferior to this young man in front of him.

“Strong healing!”

The bone corrosion poison was slowly removed. Wang Xian waved his arm and released a divine ability. The area of his stomach that had been corroded by the dark power recovered little by little!

The Hand of divine light landed on the spot where the wound had been cut open. The wound healed quickly and did not leave any scars.

“Alright, Alright, it’s really healed. Haha, Thank You, Young Master, thank you, Young Master!”

A happy voice came from Commander Yun Gu’s mouth. He felt his body and his face was full of excitement.

This bone corrosion poison entered his five internal organs. It was a deadly thing. Once it was too long, it would be completely finished.

At that time, he would not be able to use fifty percent of his strength and his strength would be greatly reduced.

“Thank you, young master. Young Master, your art of Light is really amazing. You were able to treat an injury that even hall master Tang couldn’t treat. You’re really a young hero!”

“That’s right. You’re too amazing. To possess such a powerful power of light at such a young age, you’re really amazing among all the radiant priests!”

The few people beside leader Yun Gu spoke to Wang Xian with flattering expressions.

“This...”

The young man who was standing at the side looked at this young man in shock.

His master didn’t manage to heal his injuries, but he actually managed to heal them. Could it be that he was even stronger than his master?

This made him a little dazed.

“There’s no need. The fees will be charged according to the standards of the Holy Medicine Clinic!”

Wang Xian shook his head. As he spoke, he looked at the owner of the clinic.

“Young brother, you were the one who treated leader Yun GU’s injuries. All the fees will be given to you!”

Head Tang gestured to leader Yun Gu.

“Alright, Alright. Young Master Wang, this is the fee. Please accept it!”

The old man beside leader Yun Gu quickly handed over an interspatial ring.

“Alright, I’ll accept it then!”

Wang Xian nodded and accepted it without any hesitation.

“We have something to attend to first. If there are any friends who need treatment in the future, I’ll definitely introduce them to this place!”

Leader Yun Gu exchanged a few pleasantries before turning around and leaving.

“Leader, this is the young master that I told you about not long ago. Did you not see him? Take a look at the communication stone plate now!”

The old lady said to leader Yun gu immediately after the patient left.

There were some things that Wang Xian couldn’t say directly since he was present.

“Huh?”

The hall master was slightly stunned. He nodded when he saw Chief Tang’s expression. He smiled at Wang Xian and said, “I was treating Captain Yun Gu’s illness just now, but I didn’t see any news!”

As the hall master spoke, he took out the communication stone plate and took a look. His pupils constricted slightly as he kept it slowly. His eyes flickered.

“Young master, are you sure you want to join our Holy Medicine Clinic? With your abilities, you can totally open your own clinic!”

After hesitating for a moment, the hall master asked Wang Xian.

“I’m sure. I might be staying in the clinic for a few months!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“Alright then. We will vacate the fourth floor of the clinic for you. According to the rules of the clinic, those above the void interpretation stage will be given 20% of the income to the clinic!”

“However, little brother, you are very strong. You only need to give 10% of the income to the Medical Center!”

The head of the medical center said to Wang Xian.

He nodded his head at the side.

“Head, leave the matter of this young man to me. I will be his assistant on the fourth floor in the future!”

Lao Hu said with a smile at the side.

“Sure. Lao Hu, make arrangements for this little brother. Sometimes, little brother can come and look for me!”

The hall master said with a smile.

“Alright, thank you, Hall Master!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and followed Lao Hu down the stairs.

“Master, why... Why did you give him such good conditions?”

The young man at the side asked in surprise when he saw Wang Xian and the rest leaving.

“This young man is very young, but he is very strong. It will be very beneficial for us if he stays in our clinic. It will be very good for our reputation.”

The owner of the medical center smiled. It was not easy to recruit a powerful radiant priest.

A radiant priest who was above the dimension sundering realm was a cash cow in the ruins of the divine kingdom. Forget about entering their Holy Medicine Medical Center, even entering the Divine Light Medical Center was an easy task.

...

“Young man, come here. This fourth level used to be a place where a radiant priest of the dimension sundering realm would treat patients. However, that radiant priest has already left. I will get someone to clean it up!”

Old Hu brought Wang Xian to the clinic on the fourth level. The area of more than a thousand square meters could be said to be very huge.

On the fourth level, the place where patients were treated was only about 200 square meters. The rest of the places were for resting.

The entire room was very luxurious.

Old Hu called a few girls over to tidy up. Those girls looked at Wang Xian curiously. From time to time, they would look over and whisper to each other.

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and came to the balcony.

From the balcony, he could see passers-by coming and going outside.

He was very satisfied with the environment here.

“Young man, what time do you plan to receive the guests every day? Do you have any requests? For example, what kind of patients you can’t treat and why you won’t receive them?”

Lao Hu said to Wang Xian, “The identity of a radiant priest at the insightful void level is very honorable. You can treat the patients at a fixed time!”
