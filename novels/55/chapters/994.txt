Chapter 995: At the 0996 banquet

Translator: 5496903

The Cloud Clam was a fierce beast unique to the thunderstorm area.

They lived in the black clouds. This kind of fierce beast was unusually rare. They would only come out of the black clouds when there was a rainstorm.

The feathers on this kind of fierce beast were very precious in eastern sea city.

The value of a cloud clam was comparable to two fierce beasts of the same level.

The reason was its feathers.

This kind of black feather could allow people to swim freely under the sea, and it also had a powerful defense.

The equipment made by the cloud clam was very valuable in east sea city. Once it appeared, it would be quickly snatched away.

In the records of the thunderstorm area, the cloud clam was very rare.

This time, the aerial beast mercenary group had to go through many investigations to find the location where the cloud clam was gathered.

However, what they didn’t expect was that the cloud clams in this nest were too strong!

Wang Xian rushed into the dark clouds and discovered that there were more than twenty cloud clams inside. Among them, there were three of them who were at transcendent level seven.

“Not bad again!”

Wang Xian was full of smiles as the group of strange demons started to move quickly.

Wang Xian held the lightning strike wood in his hand and also attacked the cloud clams one by one.

“Chirp, chirp, Chirp!”

Urgent cries came from the dark clouds. In less than ten minutes, all the cloud clams were killed by them.

After storing them into his interspatial ring, Wang Xian searched the surroundings. After confirming that there were no cloud clams in the surroundings, he dared to return.

After more than an hour, Wang Xian and the rest returned to Donghai City. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Looking at the mercenary groups and Chambers of commerce that were coming and going in the surroundings, Wang Xian took out his communication stone plate and sent a message to supervisor Yi of Donghai City’s Phoenix Elixir and weapons workshop.

Very soon, after receiving a reply, Wang Xian immediately walked towards the Fengxian Elixir and weapons workshop.

In Donghai City, the Fengxian Elixir and weapons workshop had four shops.

There was a shop next to the demon Hunters Academy in the Eastern District.

Wang Xian knew the location of Fengxian and walked straight into the shop.

The shop took up a total of seven to eight rooms and looked very luxurious.

However, there wasn’t a single customer in the shop.

“Captain Wang!”

When Wang Xian walked in, supervisor Yi came up to him directly.

Under the astonished gaze of the waiters in the shop, he was led to the VIP area.

“Captain Wang, you’ve been here for a few days, right? Is there anything we can help you with?”

Supervisor Yi poured a cup of tea for Wang Xian enthusiastically and asked with a smile.

“Buy some elixirs!”

Wang Xian smiled and said directly.

“Leader Wang, tell me how many elixirs you need. I’ll get someone to prepare them immediately!”

Supervisor Yi looked at Wang Xian with anticipation.

“Yes, 180 million middle-grade spirit stones!”

Wang Xian took out a few interspatial rings directly.

180 million spirit stones. This was the reward for the dragon Spike assassination as well as the rewards he obtained in the past two days.

Director Yi was stunned for a moment before a look of joy appeared on his face. “Good, good. Leader Wang, I’ll get someone to prepare it immediately!”

“Oh right, director Yi, do you accept the corpses of the ferocious beasts here?”

Wang Xian asked.

He had quite a number of the corpses of the ferocious beasts in his hands. These corpses were already dead, so devouring them would not be able to increase the dragon energy.

The Dragon Pond in the Dragon Palace was too far away from this place, so he could only sell them temporarily.

“The carcasses of ferocious beasts? Take them. If leader Wang wants to sell them, we will purchase them at the market price!”

Supervisor Yi said directly.

“Alright, take a look!”

Wang Xian took out more than ten interspatial rings and said to her.

Interspatial rings were still very precious on the transcendence continent.

A ten cubic meter interspatial ring cost one million middle-grade spirit stones.

Many extraordinary experts had interspatial rings that were around one cubic meter.

However, these interspatial rings were all obtained from Earth. He had a total of more than a hundred.

Among them, there were seven or eight interspatial rings that were a hundred square meters in size.

It was more than enough to hold a group of fierce beast corpses.

“This...”

Supervisor Yi suddenly widened his eyes.

Eight corpses of a level 8 supernatural realm killer. These were level 8 supernatural realm beasts.

In Donghai City, there were no more than five mercenary groups that could hunt level 8 supernatural realm beasts.

“Cloud toad!”

Her eyes sparkled. “Leader Wang, the corpses of your beasts are worth 300 to 400 million middle-grade spirit stones!”

“Do you want them?”

Wang Xian asked.

“Yes, of course I want them!”

Manager Yi quickly said, “Leader Wang, do you want to exchange them for medicinal pills?”

“All of them!”

“Alright, the price we offer will definitely satisfy leader Wang!”

Manager Yi said with excitement in his eyes.

A single transaction was worth 500 to 600 million middle-grade spirit stones. Even if it was a year’s worth of transactions from the four shops in east sea city, it would only be this amount.

“Leader Wang, after a period of time, some of the higher-ups of our Fengxian Guild will come to the East Sea city. At that time, our Fengxian Guild will hold an auction. I wonder if leader Wang is interested?”

Supervisor Yi called the shopkeeper over and instructed him to prepare the elixirs. Then, he spoke to Wang Xian.

“We’ll see when the time comes!”

Wang Xian thought for a moment and said.

“Alright, I’ll contact Captain Wang when the time comes!”

Supervisor Yi nodded his head.

Under supervisor Yi’s enthusiasm, Wang Xian left the Phoenix Elixir and weapons workshop and headed straight for his residence.

Supervisor Yi’s eyes sparkled as he watched Wang Xian’s back.

“To think that he was able to hunt and kill a ferocious beast of extraordinary eighth level. This Phoenix Immortal mercenary group is really mysterious and unpredictable. They are able to take out so many spirit stones every time. I really don’t know how he got them!”

She muttered.

“Hey, what’s wrong with supervisor Yi? It’s not easy for a customer to enter your shop to buy things. Are you very reluctant? Haha, can you earn a few hundred spirit stones today?”

At this moment, a mocking voice came from the side.

Supervisor Yi looked over and saw the shopkeeper of the life and Death Pill workshop looking at him mockingly.

“Humph!”

Supervisor Yi sneered and turned around to walk into the shop.

“Hehe, I heard that your Phoenix Immortal will hold a large-scale auction in a month’s time. At that time, we and the holy item forging workshop will also hold one!”

At this moment, the shopkeeper of the life and Death Pill Workshop’s voice sounded again.

This caused supervisor Yi to be stunned. His eyes revealed a grave expression as he walked into the shop uneasily.

“Hehe, Feng Xian, you want to make an enemy out of our life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop? You’re courting death. Just wait and see. It Won’t be long before you close down!”

The shopkeeper of the life and Death Pill workshop muttered coldly.

...

Wang Xian returned to his residence and immediately took out all the pills.

There were more than 500 million spirit stones worth of pills than he had expected. It could increase the strength of the group of Dragon Palace members by at least 400,000 dragon crystals.

The strength of the group of Dragon Palace members would be greatly enhanced.

Wang Xian swallowed the pills one by one and began to increase the strength of the Golden Swordfish and the strange demon.

400,000 dragon crystals was a terrifying amount of energy. It was enough for them to undergo another huge improvement.

After Wang Xian had used up all the dragon crystals.

The 11 golden swordfish had all reached transcendence level five.

Nineteen Strange Demons had also reached transcendence level five and one had reached transcendence level six.
