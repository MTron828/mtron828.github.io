Chapter 4145 - 4145: 4,144 of the same root, striking the divine tree

Translator: 549690339

The breakthrough of the Tai Chi Dragon Plate made Wang Xian relaxed.

In the following period of time, he strolled around the Mu Li tribe leisurely every day.

Tianci was cultivating. Tianci’s mother, Mu Liyin ‘er, was also cultivating.

Mu Liyin ‘er was very young. She could not fall behind in her cultivation.

Otherwise, she would not have any status in the Mu Li tribe.

Any tribe would be based on strength.

If you were strong, your status would be high. Even if there were powerful elders, your own strength couldn’t fall behind.

Otherwise, others wouldn’t respect you just because your father was strong.

Niu Li Yin ‘er was once the favored daughter of the heavens in the Mu Li tribe. Her talent was outstanding.

Even now, her talent was very strong in her generation.

Her strength was also ranked at the top.

However, she had kept a low profile ever since tianci was born.

She had to keep a low profile. There were too many rumors in the tribe! “Foster father, I’m coming to your house soon. 1 have something to tell you! ” Tens of thousands of years had passed. On this day, Tianci sent a message. Wang Xian received his message. He smiled and replied immediately.

“Foster Father! ”

Ten minutes later, tianci’s voice sounded in the room.

“Come in! ”

Wang Xian said to him. Tianci pushed the door open and entered!

Lin Niu followed beside him. His eyes were sparkling.

“Foster father, I have something important to tell you. During the period of my cultivation, the treasure in my body has grown a little. Furthermore, it has gained a powerful skill and a few branches! ”

Tianci walked up to Wang Xian and said excitedly.

“Oh? Let me take a look! ”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and placed his palm on Tianci’s body to sense his condition.

Water Elemental realm, level five universe Knight Realm.

Wood elemental realm, level four universe Dominator realm.

Level Four Universe Dominator realm. In any universe, this strength could be considered an elite existence.

The heavenly creation true treasure in his body was growing as his strength increased.

The tree in his body was already dozens of meters long.

There were many branches on it.

Among them were the soul-returning wood branches.

The soul-returning wood branches were growing on it.

Apart from that, there were hundreds of branches.

Each branch possessed different abilities and different offensive methods.

Even though Tianci was only at the fourth level of the universe dominator, he might not be a match for someone at the eighth level of the universe dominator if they were to fight.

An offensive type of Tianyuan destiny-level treasure was extremely terrifying!

Out of these few hundred branches, a large portion of Wang Xian knew about them.

However, compared to the past, there were more branches.

At the root, there were many densely packed roots!

At the top, there were two more extremely eye-catching branches.

These two branches were somewhat illusory. Among the numerous branches, they were also very eye-catching!

“Foster father, this new branch is very powerful. I call it the divine tree. I’ll cover it up for you! ”

As Tianci spoke, he moved his palm and an illusory branch appeared in his hand.

He held the branch and moved his body. A figure that looked exactly like him appeared in front of him.

When Wang Xian saw the figure that looked exactly like him, he raised his eyebrows slightly.

Buzz

Tianci waved his arm and swung it at the figure that looked exactly like him.

It was an ordinary attack.

The figure that looked exactly like him was ten meters away. It seemed that the attack could not reach him at all.

However, in the next second, the Gray branch landed on the figure that looked exactly like him.

The figure cracked under this attack and the life force in its body disappeared completely.

Then, it disappeared slowly!

Wang Xian sensed it from the side and revealed a surprised expression.

From what he sensed, be it the body that looked exactly like him or the gray divine striking tree branch, they were all very strange.

The divine striking tree branch waved its hand casually and this branch seemed to be able to teleport. It appeared in front of the target and struck directly.

There was no way for him to dodge.

As for the body that was exactly the same as tianci, in Xian’s opinion, the wood attribute energy in his body was no different from his own.

It was somewhat similar to the netherspirit avatar, but there were some differences.

The strength of this body was exactly the same as Tianci’s. It was even equivalent to one of Tianci’s avatars.

Moreover, the energy of this body came from the position of the root of the ultimate treasure of Tianyuan.

” Impressive. ”

Wang Xian complimented him generously.

“Hehe, foster father, as long as 1 hold this divine striking tree, I will have an attack range in my heart. Within this range, I can attack whoever I want. The attack will descend in an instant. ”

“Also, the clone that I made just now has the same root as me because this is the power from the root. Now, I can use the root to create clones that are exactly the same as me and possess the same strength as me.”

“1 even feel that these clones are myself. Now, I can create three clones! ” Tianci said excitedly!

“Also, foster father, Tonggensheng also has an attack method. Similarly, Tonggensheng has an attack range. Within this range, 1 can make the roots enter the enemy’s body, absorb his life force, and even control the enemy’s body!

He continued to add on!

“These two skills are very powerful. The power of the ultimate treasure ofALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Tianyuan is beginning to show.”

When Wang Xian heard that, he was slightly surprised. It was indeed an attack- type ultimate treasure of Tianyuan.

It could directly create clones and create three clones with the same strength as itself.

If it broke through to the Tianyuan creation stage and created three more clones, it would be equivalent to four beginner-level Tianyuan creation stage clones!

As for the divine tree, it was also powerful.

“Let me take a closer look! ”

As Wang Xian spoke, the energy of the ancestral tree entered Tianci’s body.

When the energy of the ancestral tree touched the treasure of Heaven’s origin creation, the treasure of Heaven’s origin creation, the divine tree, was obviously very excited and happy.

Speaking of which, Tianci was raised by him.

The divine tree in his body was also raised by the ancestral tree.

He had been instilled with the energy of the ancestral tree since he was young. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have grown so fast!

The branches wrapped around the energy of the ancestral tree as if they were welcoming it.

Wang Xian used the energy of the ancestral tree to sense the new divine striking tree and the roots beneath it!

When he touched the roots, an aura of origin was transmitted over.

These roots were extremely important to this divine tree.

It was even the strongest part of this divine tree.

This was some information that Wang Xian had obtained.

Following that, an extremely likely information flashed across his mind, causing his eyes to glow!
