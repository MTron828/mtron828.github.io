Chapter 760: Below Empress 0761(3/5)

Translator: 549690339

A vermilion bird pattern flickered between Guan Shuqing’s brows.

Feng Luan took over the body. In an instant, the dignified empress of the transcendent world was stunned.

She had been cultivating since birth, becoming empress at the age of 15 and Empress at the age of 30.

She had been imposing all her life. There was not a single man in the entire continent who was worthy of her.

Moreover, Feng Luan, who had a cold personality, a noble body, and a suffocating majesty, had no romantic feelings at all.

In the entire continent, there weren’t many men who dared to look her in the eye.

The majesty of the Empress made all the men feel ashamed in front of her.

But now, she was actually lying under a man, and it was a man who was as weak as an ant in his eyes.

This caused a hint of coldness and killing intent to flash across Feng Luan’s eyes.

The pressure of the empress slowly gathered.

“Pa, baby, come up, hehehe!”

However, at this moment, a frivolous voice was heard. Following that, the man moved violently.

In an instant, the Empress’s dignity was drowned out. Her face was extremely red.

However, this feeling made her...

For a moment, Feng Luan’s expression changed drastically.

Wang Xian didn’t know that Shu Qing, who was under him, had already been occupied by another soul. He was prepared to release the pain of missing her for more than a year.

Five minutes later, Feng Luan’s thoughts were drowned out. She closed her eyes tightly.

One Hour... two hours...

Finally, the two of them laid on the bed. Wang Xian was in a very happy mood.

“Shuqing, you have no idea. I have missed you so much over the past year. Today, you are finally awake!”

Wang Xian stretched out his hand and hugged Guan Shuqing. Suddenly, he frowned slightly.

The Guan Shuqing in front of him suddenly gave her a very unfamiliar feeling. The Flames flickering between her brows gave her a special kind of dignity.

Looking at her eyes, Wang Xian was shocked. His expression changed drastically. “You are not Shuqing!”

Feng Luan’s expression changed when she heard Wang Xian’s words. She had no idea how to talk to the man in front of her. She frowned.

“Who exactly are you?”

Wang Xian’s expression was extremely awkward. He stared at her and asked.

“I am that drop of Vermillion Bird Essence Blood!”

Feng Luan’s expression darkened.

“Where is Shuqing? What did you do to her?”

Wang Xian’s expression changed drastically. He revealed a cold expression.

“Xiao Xian, Xiao Xian!”

Suddenly, the flame between her eyebrows disappeared slowly and Guan Shuqing’s panicked voice was heard.

Wang Xian was stunned and he was a little stunned. Looking at her eyes, he knew that it was Guan Shuqing this time.

“Shuqing, are you alright?”

He asked hurriedly.

“Xiao Xian, there seems to be another person in my body. Just now... When we were together, I suddenly returned to my body and another soul took over my body!”

Guan Shuqing said to Wang Xian in panic.

When Wang Xian heard her words, his scalp went numb.

“Shuqing, can you contact her?”

Wang Xian said with an embarrassed expression.

Anyone who had an additional soul in their body would be horrified.

“She is the soul from the Vermilion Bird Essence Blood that you absorbed back then. See if you can contact her!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Wang Xian said to Guan Shuqing with a solemn face.

“Contact?”

Guan Shuqing took a deep breath when she heard Wang Xian’s words. She closed her eyes and tried to contact her.

Wang Xian felt a little uncomfortable when he saw Guan Shuqing’s eyebrows trembling non-stop.

There was actually a wisp of soul in the Vermilion Bird’s blood essence. This was something that he didn’t expect.

“Phew!”

After a few minutes, Guan Shuqing suddenly heaved a sigh of relief and opened her eyes.

“How is it?”

“I’ve contacted Xiao Xian. She said that her name is Feng Luan, the Empress of the Phoenix dynasty in the transcendence continent. During the Nirvana, she was attacked and injured. A drop of her essence blood escaped and was absorbed by me. After that, she became like this. She also said that she would be able to reconstruct her physical body when she becomes stronger in the future!”

As Guan Shuqing spoke, her expression kept changing.

“Then...”

Wang Xian’s expression changed. He took a deep breath and asked, “Who is in control of your physical body now?”

“I’m not sure. Sometimes, it might be me and sometimes, it might be her. But now, we can sense what is happening outside!”

Guan Shuqing said with a bad expression.

“Is she sure that she can reconstruct her physical body just because she’s strong?”

Wang Xian frowned and asked.

“She said that she can. As long as she has a drop of blood essence and sufficient energy, she can be reborn!”

Guan Shuqing nodded.

“Damn it. Luckily, she’s a woman. If she’s a man, I have to think of a way to kill her!”

Wang Xian’s expression softened a little. As long as she was a woman and didn’t endanger Guan Shuqing’s life, it would be easy to solve the problem.

If it was a man, then Wang Xian was really F * cked up.

In a situation like the one just now, he suddenly changed his soul. If it was a man, that would be so satisfying...

Guan Shuqing’s expression was also a little strange. She naturally knew what happened just now.

“Sigh, I didn’t expect there to be such a problem. Shuqing, don’t worry. I will solve it for you as soon as possible!”

Wang Xian shook his head and sighed.

“HMM, Xiao Xian, I feel that I’m very strong now!”

Guan Shuqing nodded. Although she had an additional soul in her body, it wasn’t harmful at all. She heaved a sigh of relief.

“Go to sleep. Rest well!”

Wang Xian kissed Guan Shuqing and held her in his arms.

Guan Shuqing also hugged her slowly.

“Get lost!”

However, at this moment, a cold and dignified voice was heard. Wang Xian instantly felt a strong force pushing towards him.

“F * ck!”

Wang Xian couldn’t help but curse. He stared at Guan Shuqing with an embarrassed expression.

At this moment, a flame appeared between Guan Shuqing’s eyebrows again.

The Aura on her body had completely changed. Her eyes were filled with dignity as she stared at Wang Xian without any emotion.

“This is my wife’s body!”

Wang Xian’s expression was awkward.

“Get Out!”

Feng Luan waved her arm and a flame appeared. She grabbed Wang Xian’s arm and threw him out of the bed.

Wang Xian’s expression changed instantly. His body was thrown out without any resistance.

“Upper-level immortal!”

Wang Xian’s face was extremely embarrassed. The strength that Shu Qing had displayed just now was at most a middle-level immortal. However, this woman was able to unleash the strength of an upper-level immortal.

“Flame Gate!”

Feng Luan waved her arm and the surroundings of the bed were instantly surrounded by flames, forming a curtain-like object.

“F * ck!”

When Wang Xian saw this scene, his face instantly turned black.

Feng Luan, who was lying on the bed, was breathing rapidly. She slowly closed her eyes.

Wang Xian stood outside without any clothes. He looked at her helplessly and realized that he was no match for her.

Shaking his head, he waved his arm and a wooden bed appeared. He laid on it helplessly.

“Xiao Xian!”

However, a familiar voice suddenly came from the bed in the middle of the night.

Wang Xian immediately got up, got into bed, and hugged Guan Shuqing.

Upon seeing this scene, Guan Shuqing couldn’t help but smile!
