Chapter 1657: In the 1657 Arena Battle of life and death

“Eh? You want to increase my strength?”

Huo Luo'er followed Wang Xian to his residence with a face full of curiosity. She looked at him in puzzlement.

“Brother Wang Xian, my strength has just increased not long ago. Mother said that I want to increase my strength. Unless I strengthen my cultivation base, forcefully using resources to increase my strength will harm my bloodline!”

She continued to speak to Wang Xian.

“I know. Sit On the ground!”

Wang Xian nodded. He opened his mouth slightly and the five elements Millstone flew out.

On the five elements millstone, there was a ball of extremely terrifying flames.

Fire Soul!

This ball of fire soul was being absorbed by the Five Elements Millstone. Currently, the fire soul of the ninth level of the Seethrough realm had been reduced to the eighth level of the Seethrough realm.

But that’s enough!

“What is this? Fire Spirit?”

Fire Lola slightly cross-legged on the ground, slightly wide-eyed, staring at the five elements mill above the terrible flame.

“Close your eyes and feel the fire!”

Wang Xian’s voice rang in her ear.

Lorde closed her eyes at once.

“The five elements grind, run!”

With a wave of Wang Xian’s arm, the five elements grind into the size of two meters, above the five dragon operation.

The energy of the Fire Divine Dragons was rapidly enhanced. Under the circulation of the Five Elements Millstone, the flaming soul turned into wisps of pure flames that slowly flowed towards Huo Luo'er.

“Flame Envelopment!”

Wang Xian shouted softly. A streak of flame fell from the five elements millstone and enveloped Huo Luo'er.

The terrifying flames in the flaming soul quickly entered Huo Luo'er’s body.

“Boom!”

The moment the pure flames landed on Huo Luo'er’s body, her profound void Tier 2 strength immediately broke through. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Following that, the flames intensified, and the Fire Divine Dragon on the five elements millstone swayed its body, directly entering Huo Luo'er’s body.

The Fire Divine Dragon entered her body, helping her stabilize her foundation and circulate the flames.

“Boom!”

In less than five minutes, the aura within Huo Luo'er’s body rose once again.

Fourth level of the Seethrough realm!

Huo Luo'er already possessed the peak bloodline of the fire Lark clan. She could directly cultivate to the half-step longevity realm.

Now, Wang Xian was using the fire soul as energy and the five elements great grinding gang to temper his body.

There were no hidden dangers at all.

Boom

More than ten minutes later, another powerful aura burst out from her body.

Fifth level of the Seethrough realm.

The rapidly increasing aura did not stop.

If this was placed outside, even in the central continent region, it would still be extremely terrifying if others knew about such a terrifying growth rate.

Half an hour later, the sixth level of the Void Interpretation Stage!

One hour later, the seventh level of the Void Interpretation Stage!

Three hours later, the eighth level of the Void Interpretation Stage!

The energy of the flaming soul was depleted.

Wang Xian waved his arm and kept the five elements grinding mill. A smile appeared on his face.

Although the strength of the eighth level of the Seethrough realm was not very safe in the upcoming battle, it was much better than before.

“I... I...”

At this moment, Huo Luo'er slowly opened her eyes. Her pure eyes were filled with shock.

“Brother Wang Xian, my strength... my strength has actually reached the eighth level of the void interpretation stage. How is this possible?”

She stood up slowly and felt the strong strength in her body. She stared at Wang Xian with her eyes wide open in disbelief.

From the second level of the void interpretation stage to the eighth level of the void interpretation stage in a total of more than three hours. This was simply shocking.

Even though the fire lark tribe was one of the top races on the continent, they did not dare to imagine such a thing.

“Get used to your own strength. Call Me When You Go Tomorrow!”

Wang Xian said directly to Huo Luo'er.

“Brother Wang Xian, i... I’ll get used to it first!”

Huo Luo'er felt a little absent-minded. Looking at Wang Xian who was in front of her, she nodded her head excitedly.

She walked out. When she reached the door, she couldn’t help but turn her head. “Brother Wang Xian, thank you!”

“You’re welcome!”

Wang Xian smiled and poured himself a cup of tea.

“The current state of the fire lark makes me feel a little constrained!”

He leaned against the chair and raised his eyebrows slightly.

There were two longevity experts on the other party’s side and only one on his side. If the other party were to really go all out, the fire Lark clan would definitely suffer a huge loss.

“Let’s take it slow and raise my strength to the longevity realm as soon as possible!”

Wang Xian thought to himself.

“Brother Wang Xian!”

The next morning, Huo Luo'er’s voice sounded from outside.

Wang Xian opened his eyes and opened the door. “Have we set off?”

“HMM? Everyone has gathered at the entrance. Let’s go over!”

Huo Luo'er looked at Wang Xian with a smile.

“Alright, let’s go and take a look. Today, we shall watch our little beauty Huo Luo'er slaughter everyone!”

Wang Xian smiled and instantly came to her side.

“Hehe, brother, no one knows that you helped me to improve my strength. Today, I want to kill those D * mned guys!”

Huo Luo'er held his arm affectionately and said excitedly.

“Hehe, the Little Loli from back then has grown up!”

Wang Xian stroked her head.

After helping Huo Luo'er improve her strength yesterday, she had become even more affectionate to him today.

“HMPH!”

Huo Luo'er smiled and grabbed Wang Xian’s arm as they walked towards the city gate.

“Eh? Who Is that young man? Why is our little princess so intimate with him?”

“I don’t know. I’ve never seen that young man before. Is He a disciple of the song sect or the fire sect?”

“I hope this fellow has some powerful treasures, our little Princess!”

As they walked on the road, the people in Volcano City were all shocked when they saw their little princess holding onto the arm of a young man so intimately.

“Huh?”

When Huo Luo'er, Wang Xian, and the rest arrived at the city gate, the young disciples of the Sacred Fire clan and the fire Lark clan looked over.

Upon seeing this scene, many people were shocked.

Lie Hanshan raised his eyebrows. This made him, who had a good impression of the fire lark, a little unhappy.

“Sister Huo Luo'er!”

“Sister Huo Luo'er!”

Two young men walked up and looked at Wang Xian.

“Brother Xu Xingcan, brother Huo Mingtu!”

Huo Luo'er immediately greeted the two young men with a smile.

“This is?”

The two young men looked at Wang Xian and asked Huo Luo'er curiously.

“This is brother Wang Xian. He’s from another place!”

Huo Luo'er introduced him.

“Hello, Brother. I’m Xu Xingcan!”

“I’m Huo Mingtu!”

The two of them cupped their hands and greeted Wang Xian.

“Wang Xian!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the two of them. Both of them were at the fifth level of the Seethrough realm. They should be the leading figures among the younger generation of the fire Lark clan.

“Princess Huo Luo'er is here. Let’s Go!”

The Voice of the Holy Fire clan could be heard from the front.

“Let’s Go!”

Everyone nodded and immediately flew towards the center of the battlefield.

“Brother Wang Xian, Xu Xingcan is the most outstanding disciple of our fire lark song sect. His father died in this war!”

“Huoming tu is the most outstanding disciple of our fire Lark clan. He is a disciple of our fire sect. A few heaven’s pride disciples were assassinated by Masked Assassins!”
