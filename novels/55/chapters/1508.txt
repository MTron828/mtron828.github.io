Chapter 1509: 1509 if I become a demon, there will be no demon 4 in the world

Even if I have to use my broken body, I will destroy everything here!

When Wang Xian saw that everyone in the ancient demon city was terrified and wanted to escape, a cold expression appeared in his eyes.

There was no fluctuation in his pupils. His body moved and he gave up on fighting against the seven demon masters. Instead, he attacked the people in the ancient demon city.

“Madman, Madman, this is a Madman!”

“Run, run, we have to run!”

“Lord Demon Master, Save Us!”

When everyone in ancient demon city saw Wang Xian giving up on fighting against the demon master and charging towards them, they were all shocked.

Was this guy a Madman?

He was facing the attacks of the seven demon masters from ancient demon city, yet he still wanted to kill them!

How much hatred do we have?

It seems that in the beginning, they heard a sentence: a month ago, someone from your ancient Devil City besieged a woman. Today, all of you will die!

Damn it, a month ago, someone from ancient Devil City besieged a woman, and you want to destroy our entire city?

Even in ancient Devil City, everyone was extremely vicious, and they couldn’t help but curse.

You want to destroy all of us just by besieging a woman?

Do you have to be so overbearing!

Unfortunately, Wang Xian had already fallen into a demonic state. He was like a demon that had lost his rationality.

All he wanted was revenge!

Even if they were to beg for mercy loudly, Wang Xian wouldn’t have any reaction.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

At this moment, the extremely terrifying demonic scale chain swept across a radius of ten kilometers.

The terrifying demon scale chain was at least one meter thick and looked like a dragon scale. Once it was hit, even a level 6 Seethrough void martial artist would not be able to escape!

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

“Ah! Ah! Ah!”

“Demon Lord, Help!”

The demon scale chain swept across a ten-kilometer radius. A total of more than 100,000 people roared with fear on their faces.

A ten-kilometer radius was turned into ruins.

More than 100,000 people died instantly.

“Damn it!”

When the seven Devil Masters saw that Wang Xian was still distracted from killing the people from the ancient Devil City while fighting with them, their faces were filled with rage.

Killing people under their noses, wasn’t this disrespecting them!

“Kill him!”

The Devil Master who was holding the sickle had a sinister look on his face. He waved his arm and a huge sickle slashed toward Wang Xian!

“Beast, go to Hell!”

The other demon lords attacked Wang Xian ferociously.

However, what shocked everyone was that Wang Xian didn’t Dodge at all. He continued to attack the area in front of him.

In front of him, more than 100,000 people from the ancient demon city were fleeing in panic.

However, with their speed, they were far inferior to Wang Xian.

The devil scale chains swept forward once again.

“He is a madman! Ahhh!”

“No!”

Sounds of despair were heard.

Boom! Boom! Boom

However, at this moment, terrifying attacks landed on Wang Xian’s body.

The huge scythe slashed at the waist of Wang Xian’s dragon.

A ferocious ghost shadow bit the area where his dragon tail was.

A skull head hit Wang Xian’s head heavily.

Every attack that could seriously injure even a level 7 Seethrough void martial artist landed on Wang Xian’s body.

Black blood splashed down rapidly like rain.

Large chunks of flesh and blood fell to the ground.

Especially at the dragon’s body, the scythe left a 10-meter long and 2-meter deep wound on his body.

“Roar! No one can escape!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

However, Wang Xian didn’t seem to notice such a terrifying wound.

He raised his head and let out a wild roar. His body moved and he continued to charge forward. The monstrous demonic flames didn’t diminish in the slightest.

His body moved and he flew for five to six kilometers. He waved his dragon claw at the fleeing crowd in front of him.

“Ahhhh!”

The miserable shrieks rang out once again. With a swipe of his claw, nearly 10,000 people died instantly.

“Ahhhh, this damned beast. Attack again. This time, I will definitely kill him!”

When the dual-headed demon lord saw Wang Xian charging into the crowd and killing wantonly, he roared furiously.

“The dual-headed demon has descended!”

His body trembled. A dual-headed, four-armed demon figure appeared and tore at Wang Xian.

“Corpse Tomb Mountain!”

“Heavenly Devil Soul!”

Angry Voices rang out one after another as dharma idols were unleashed and attacked Wang Xian.

“Roar Roar! Everyone, Destroy!”

At this moment, Wang Xian was still unperturbed. With a loud roar, his entire body suddenly enlarged.

First was his dragon body, which directly transformed into a radius of six kilometers. Following that, his dragon head and dragon claws transformed into a radius of three kilometers.

An even more terrifying demonic dragon had descended into the ancient demon city!

“What?”

“What kind of dharma idol is this?”

The seven demon masters saw the 100-meter-long creature suddenly transform into a length of six thousand meters. Its head was three thousand meters long and its two gigantic claws were three thousand meters long.

They widened their eyes and roared in fear.

“Attack! Continue to attack!”

The two-headed demon lord saw Wang Xian’s figure increasing rapidly. With an ugly expression, he roared again and cast another Dharma Idol!

The other six demon lords did not hesitate and cast the Dharma Idol together.

In an instant, 14 extremely terrifying dharma idols attacked Wang Xian.

The setting sun was like blood as it illuminated the ancient demon city.

The ancient demon city, which was already gloomy, terrifying, and brutal, was even more terrifying under the Dharma Idols.

However, Wang Xian, who possessed a terrifying body, was like a world-destroying demonic dragon.

He ignored the attacks of the seven demon lords and chased after the people of the ancient demon city who had committed the most heinous crimes.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The sound of an explosion reverberated within a radius of a few hundred kilometers.

Even the people from the He clan in the distance were looking on in horror.

The fourteen dharma idols landed on Wang Xian’s body.

His dragon body and claws were dissipating at a terrifying speed. He was slowly returning to his original size.

His entire body was in tatters.

However, his dragon head was still as big as three kilometers!

“Dragon Head, devour the world! Roar! Roar!”

A roar came from his mouth. The dragon head was so big that it could devour the mouth of a mountain. It was going straight for the front.

Boom! Boom! Boom

At this moment, the dragon’s mouth was like a black hole, swallowing all the buildings and living beings around it!

“Oh my God!”

“It’s over, it’s over!”

“What kind of existence did we provoke? and which damn thing attacked that woman!”

Everyone in ancient Devil City started to despair.

After several attacks, 300,000 to 400,000 people in ancient Devil City died.

When the dragon’s head opened, it was as if the door to the Abyss was opened.

Everything was destroyed.

No one was able to walk out of this terrifying dragon’s mouth.

From Afar, one could see that the entire ancient devil city had been completely razed to the ground.

A million living beings had all died!

Under the setting sun, there was only a broken body and an incomparably shocked Devil Master!
