Chapter 1333: The eighth Prince of 1334 must die! Go

“How is this possible? How can he still have strength?”

When Bing Hanzi, who was floating in the sky, saw Wang Xian charging towards him directly, a hint of fear flashed across his skinny face.

He stared at Wang Xian who was flying towards him. With a wave of his hands, ice mountains of a hundred meters in size smashed towards Wang Xian.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Wang Xian stared at Bing Hanzi with his dragon eyes. With a gentle wave of his dragon claws, the ice mountains collapsed.

“Oh No, run!”

A hint of panic appeared on his face. With a move of his body, he turned around and fled into the distance.

“Can you escape?”

Wang Xian opened his mouth and the Five Elements Millstone appeared again. This was not a Dharma Idol but a weapon.

Boom

The Five Elements Millstone flew out and attacked Bing Hanzi. It grew bigger and bigger in the air and the destructive aura appeared once again.

It was as if the long river of time could destroy everything.

“There’s another millstone like this? Is it going to die in the end?”

Bing Hanzi looked at the five elements millstone that was attacking him from behind. His eyes were a little dim.

He stared deeply at Wang Xian and slowly closed his eyes.

He had lived for thousands of years and was already worth it. The only thing that made him unwilling was that he wanted to witness his young master becoming an invincible powerhouse.

He wanted to witness how Han Zong stood at the peak of the flowing sea region. Now, he couldn’t see it anymore.

Bing Hanzi didn’t struggle anymore and closed his eyes.

Wang Xian walked forward with his dragon body. With a wave of his dragon claws, he kept his corpse into his interspatial ring.

The corpse of a fifth-level insightful void martial artist contained an extremely terrifying energy.

Wang Xian swayed his body and looked towards the location of the Dharma Idol, the five elements millstone.

The death of Bing Hanzi did not cause the frozen land to disappear.

The energy brought by the terrifying ice ball was still resisting the five elements millstone.

“Roar!”

Wang Xian let out a roar. Waves of dragon flames were spat out towards the location below.

The ice seal melted slowly and turned into water energy. Instead, it was replenished on the body of the Five Elements Millstone.

The four divine dragons of metal, wood, fire, and earth began to revolve. Streams of energy revolved on the body of the water divine dragon that was sealed in ice.

The water divine dragon slowly recovered. He opened his mouth and an extremely cold ice ball appeared in his line of sight.

Ice Heart: seventh level of the Void interpretation stage

“Seventh level of the void interpretation stage. So it’s the terrifying energy of the seventh level of the Void Interpretation Stage!”

Wang Xian looked at the ice ball and a hint of astonishment flashed across his eyes.

Buzz

At this moment, the five Elemental Dragon Ball transformed into the five elemental millstone flew over. The water dragon that was standing on it opened its mouth and swallowed Bing Xin directly.

The other four divine dragons immediately helped to subdue her!

“TSK TSK, not only does the five elemental millstone contain powerful energy, it also has its own spirituality. It can swallow energy on its own to increase its strength!”

Wang Xian smiled when he saw the water god Dragon slowly subjugating Bing Xin.

The core of the Five Elements Millstone was these five Dragon Balls, and the Dragon Balls were Wang Xian’s Natal artifact.

Now, after transforming into the five elements millstone, each of the Divine Dragons was born with spirituality.

In the future, it could become a powerful artifact that could think. Furthermore, Wang Xian would not need to nurture them alone in the future for their improvement.

“With my current strength, I can kill a fifth-level Seethrough Void!”

Wang Xian landed in the middle of the Dharma Idol’s five elements millstone and revealed a smile on his face.

With a thought, he reverted back to his human form. At the same time, the Dharma Idol’s five elements millstone dissipated little by little. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The weapon of the five elements millstone rotated slowly and turned into a crown that landed on Wang Xian’s head.

The lifelike five elements divine dragon added a little dignity to Wang Xian.

A black outfit appeared on his body, Crown, and head.

“Why is there no movement from above? What’s the situation now?”

“Is it over? Who will win and who will lose?”

At the bottom, when Wang Xian’s Dharma Idol, which covered an area of about 2,000 meters, appeared, everyone below could not see the battle above.

Only when the sounds of battle disappeared did everyone mutter.

“That big millstone is disappearing bit by bit. Could it be that Wang Xian has lost?”

“That’s very possible. After all, his opponent is an old monster who has lived for thousands of years!”

When the five elements millstone slowly disappeared, some people exclaimed and shouted loudly.

When Long Xiaotian saw this scene, his eyes were filled with despair and his entire body was powerless.

“Haha, we won, We won. That D * MN Guy finally...”

Long Xiaoyun looked at the sky and saw Wang Xian’s dharma idol dissipating. He thought Bing Hanzi had won. His face was flushed red as he roared in excitement.

However, when he saw a black figure descending towards them, everyone was stunned.

“That’s... That’s Wang Xian...”

“It’s Wang Xian. Where’s Bing Hanzi? Where’s Bing Hanzi? Could it be...”

Soon, everyone saw Wang Xian’s figure. They widened their eyes and shouted in shock.

The new generation of Peerless Heaven’s favorites had won the battle between the new and old peerless experts.

As for why there was no sign of Bing Hanzi, everyone had a premonition.

He had fallen!

“What? This is impossible... this is impossible... this is impossible!”

The eighth Prince, Long Xiaoyun, stared at Wang Xian. He shook his head vigorously and shouted in disbelief.

Behind him, the expressions of the people from the Frost sect changed drastically. A hint of fear flashed across their eyes.

“Haha, we won! Brother Wang Xian won!”

Compared to the eighth Prince’s despair, Long Xiaotian stared at Wang Xian with excitement. Even tears were streaming down his face.

Long Xiaotian’s grandfather even raised his fist in excitement.

Bam

Wang Xian sat in the middle of the room. He wore a crown on his head and looked at everyone around him arrogantly.

“An invincible posture. This is the real invincible posture!”

“Wang Xian can be called invincible because he is only 26 years old. To be able to defeat Bing Hanzi at this age is heaven-defying. Even in the entire supernatural continent, he is definitely an invincible powerhouse among the younger generation!”

“This is too cool, too cool!”

Everyone’s gaze was focused on Wang Xian.

The admiration of the younger generation!

The admiration of the middle-aged generation!

The exclamations of the older generation!

There was also a hint of reverence mixed within.

All kinds of gazes landed on Wang Xian. At this moment, even in the next hundred years.

Wang Xian was definitely the most dazzling existence in the flowing sea region.

“I didn’t expect this brother Wang Xian to have such great strength at such a young age. I, Long Tengyang, am deeply impressed!”

At this moment, the voice of the King of the Radiant Dragon Empire, who was sitting in the middle of the stage, was heard.

Everyone was slightly shocked and quickly turned their heads.

The King of the Radiant Dragon Empire stood there and cupped his hands as he spoke to Wang Xian.

He addressed him as brother Wang Xian!

He addressed Wang Xian as me!

He addressed Wang Xian as Long Teng Yang!

At this moment, the king of the Light Dragon Dynasty placed Wang Xian on the same level.

Wang Xian also had the right to communicate with him on an equal level.

After killing the founder of the Frost sect, Bing Hanzi, there were only a few people in the entire Liuhai region who were stronger than him.

There were only a few people with a higher status than him.

The king of the Light Dragon dynasty was not among them!
