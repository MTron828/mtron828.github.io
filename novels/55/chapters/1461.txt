Chapter 1462: 1462 headed to the vast region

“Prime Minister Gui, have you found her?”

Four days later, Wang Xian and a group of girls were sitting in the Dragon King’s palace.

When they saw Prime Minister Gui, a few girls immediately stood up and asked hurriedly.

“Dragon King, Dragon Queen, we have used the entire dragon-phoenix Empire, Liuhuang Alliance, and the strength of our Dragon Palace, but we still haven’t found Miss Ling Jian ‘er!”

“However, someone said that they seemed to have seen this figure flying towards the east!”

Prime Minister GUI reported to Wang Xian and the rest.

“The East?”

Wang Xian frowned slightly.

“It’s the Dragon King. The north-flowing sea, which is 300,000 kilometers away from the east, is a vast area. With our current search efforts, Miss Ling Jian ‘ER is either in the wilderness or heading towards the vast area!”

Prime Minister Gui continued to speak to Wang Xian, “The vast area of the sea is an area close to the nine gods empire. The area is about ten times larger than the flowing sea area!”

“The vast area of the sea?”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. He was naturally very clear about the vast area of the sea.

If the flowing sea area was equivalent to a city, then the vast area of the sea was equivalent to a province!

And those empires were equivalent to a huge country.

In the supernatural continent, there were five empires. There were about twenty territories of the vast sea region.

And there were about forty to fifty places like the flowing sea region.

The three divisions, together with the ocean region and Dragon Island formed a huge supernatural continent.

With Wang Xian’s current energy in the flowing sea region, it was impossible to not find someone unless the person stayed in the wilderness or died.

Otherwise, it was impossible for him to not be able to find the person.

If he couldn’t find the person, he would have to leave this region.

“It’s very likely that Sister Ling Jian ‘ER has already left the Liuhai region and headed for the vast region!”

Zhang Fengying said with a frown.

“This is all our fault. If we had treated her better back then, perhaps...”

A few girls said with some self-blame.

“This matter is not your fault. Everyone has their own personality. Ling Jian ‘ER’s personality is different from yours!”

Wang Xian shook his head and felt a little helpless.

It was impossible to say that he did not blame himself. Looking at a girl who liked him and often cooked food for him, she dug her heart out because of his rejection.

Other than feeling a little numb, he also felt a little guilty.

This was especially so for a guy like Wang Xian who was a philanthropist. If he did not find Ling Jian ‘er, he might not feel well for the rest of his life!

“Dragon King!”

At this moment, Ao Jian led a group of more than ten subordinates and walked in. They bowed to Wang Xian.

“How is it?”

Wang Xian asked Ao Jian and the rest.

“Dragon King, the heartless sword principle can indeed be cultivated. If I’m not wrong, this is the real heartless sword principle. It is completely incomparable to the superficial level on earth!”

“To cultivate the emotionless sword principle, one must dig out the heart and re-cultivate the sword heart. After cultivating the sword heart, one must begin to train the sword heart, making the sword heart have feelings and making the sword heart emotionless. Finally, one can freely withdraw and release the Sword Heart. That is the great success of the emotionless sword principle

“However, to dig out one’s own heart, one must first forget the feelings and condense the embryo of the sword heart. Otherwise, if the embryo is not condensed, digging out the heart will cause one to die instantly

“It is very difficult to condense a sword heart embryo without emotions. The mortality rate is very high. Even for our Golden Swordfish clan, one out of ten clansmen who cultivate will die!”

Ao Jian reported to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian brought over the cultivation method of the heartless sword principle. No one dared to cultivate this thing.

He passed the heartless sword principle to Ao Jian and showed it to him.

What he didn’t expect was that Ao Jian actually allowed people to cultivate it.

Fortunately, with the soul-returning wood, the dead clansmen could be resurrected.

“Can they cultivate it? How is the effect of their cultivation?”

Wang Xian immediately stood up and asked.

“It can greatly increase their combat strength. If they succeed, they can easily fight two levels above them!”

Ao Jian said with a solemn face, “But it’s very difficult to succeed. The mortality rate is extremely high!”

“Can You Golden Swordfish tribe continue to cultivate?”

Wang Xian asked Ao Jian.

Golden Swordfish tribe were born swordsmen. Furthermore, they didn’t have much emotions. Perhaps they could really cultivate it.

“We can cultivate it. If we can cultivate it, in the entire Dragon Palace, perhaps only the leader of AO demons can fight us!”

Ao Jian’s face revealed a strong sense of confidence as he said proudly.

“You can control the matters of cultivation. Don’t suffer too many casualties!”

Wang Xian said to Ao Jian.

“Yes, Dragon King. These are Ao Jian’s hearts. The other nine are the hearts of the Golden Swordfish that have successfully cultivated it!”

“The hearts are the fatal weakness of the cultivators of the heartless sword principle before they have successfully cultivated it. Once the hearts are crushed, we will die!”

“Furthermore, the process of forgetting our feelings while cultivating the heartless sword principle may affect our loyalty. Dragon King, you can suppress us by holding our hearts!”

As Ao Jian spoke, he handed over the hearts one by one.

Wang Xian looked over and nodded slowly.

“Hold the hearts. Within a radius of dozens of kilometers, the dragon king can sense our presence. If you want to find Miss Ling Jian ‘er, you just need to hold the hearts and you will be able to sense us within a radius of dozens of kilometers!”

Ao Jian continued to report to Wang Xian.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded. “All of you can go and cultivate!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Wang Xian kept the hearts of Ao Jian and the rest. He looked at Ling Jian ‘ER’s heart and shook his head slowly.

“Xiao Xian, are you going to the vast region to look for Ling Jian ‘er?”

Guan Shuqing and the other girls looked at Wang Xian. “If you really go, we will support you!”

The few girls also knew that Wang Xian valued friendship. When Guan Shuqing’s life and death were still unknown, he was so angry that he almost wiped out the entire jianghu.

Although Ling Jian ‘er could not be compared to Guan Shuqing, it was only right for him to retrieve her.

“Let’s wait for a while. If he really goes to the vast area, I won’t know how to search for him for a while. I’ll make some preparations during this period of time!”

Wang Xian rubbed the space between his eyebrows and said.

“Dragon King, the demon Qilin clan is preparing to evolve into the Fire Phoenix Dragon Seed in the Dragon Pool. Do you want to go over and take a look?”

Prime Minister Gui, who was standing below, asked Wang Xian respectfully.

“Alright, I’ll go and take a look!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and flew towards the Dragon Pool.

Judging from the name of the Fire Phoenix Dragon Seed, one could tell that it was a top-notch dragon seed.

One by one, the demon Lin entered the dragon pool and rapidly transformed, while two demon Lin were already standing beside the Dragon Pool.

The fire Phoenix Dragon Seed did not allow the demon Lin to directly evolve into a phoenix. The dragon seed was still primarily a dragon.

It was very different from the Phoenix Phoenix true form of the Phoenix Luan. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

After the demon Lin clan transformed into the fire Phoenix Dragon Seed, two enormous wings grew out of their backs.

Their entire body looked more agile and vigorous. Their bodies were covered by a group of fiery red wings, making them look extremely noble.
