Chapter 3897: 3896, the wrath of the belief universe!

Translator: 549690339

“Damn it, Damn Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, Damn Dragon King, our Amie Mountain Palace will never let you go, never! ”

The Brilliant Sun Palace was destroyed, and the second palace was also destroyed!

At the same time, at the position of the belief universe passage, an old man received a message, and his face revealed an extremely angry expression.

“Damn it! “He cursed angrily.

The elders of the Amethyst Palace suddenly cursed angrily, causing the elders of the surrounding palaces to frown and look at him.

“Your Amethyst Palace was also destroyed?”

The elder of the Radiant Sun Palace asked the elder of the Amethyst Palace with a gloomy face!

“Yes, it was the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, the ancient god of the Dragon Palace, the kun-feeding master, who killed all the gods and believers of our army. This Damn Dragon King, once the calamity arrives in the future, they will be the first to be destroyed by our Amethyst Palace! ”

The elder of the amethyst palace growled with a face full of killing intent!

His eyes were filled with hatred!

The million-strong army of the Amethyst Palace was their elites!

The million-strong army had been destroyed, and their core strength and foundation had suffered a great loss!

They couldn’t even accept this loss!

They had entered the starry cosmos to increase their strength, but instead of increasing their strength, they had suffered a huge impact. This was something they couldn’t accept!

“The army of your Armi Mountain Palace has been destroyed. The Army of our

Radiant Sun Palace should have been destroyed by the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. ”

The elders and experts of the Radiant Sun Palace also spoke with an ugly expression.

The Radiant Sun Palace was the first to be destroyed!

However, before all the gods and believers of the Radiant Sun Palace died, they didn’t see who had attacked!

From the looks of it, it was definitely the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!

“Two legions have already been destroyed, and in such a short period of time, the legions in our Palace!”

The experts in the surrounding palaces had solemn expressions on their faces!

The elders immediately gave orders one by one.

They told the legions in the palace to be careful.

However, even though they sent out reminders, the worry on their faces didn’t decrease at all!

This was because the Dragon King and the others were too powerful!

Two space beasts that were comparable to the peak of the gods!

Even the star field fragment was in the hands of the Dragon King!

(‘I really didn’t expect that our entire belief universe would be forced to such an extent by a force from the 9-origin universe.”

An elder from a palace slowly opened his mouth to speak, his expression somewhat ugly.

Just a single dragon palace had caused their entire belief universe to be on tenterhooks.

This was something they had never expected in their belief universe!

Right at this moment, an incomparably vast energy suddenly appeared in the sky above all the gods.

An enormous illusory figure condensed from the power of belief appeared in the sky.

The illusory figure was incomparably huge, as if it occupied an entire stretch of the sky!

This figure had three faces, left, right, and center.

Each face had a different expression.

Malevolent, kind, and cold! “It’s the king of the gods! ”

“Greetings, King of the gods! ”

When all the elders and experts of the 24 palaces saw this figure appear, their hearts trembled, and they immediately bowed respectfully!

Even if this king of the gods wasn’t the supreme god of their palaces!

However, when faced with this figure, all the experts of the gods bowed respectfully!

The title of King of the gods wasn’t given for nothing!

“The starry sky fragment has already been taken away and used by the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. Order all the disciples of the palaces to gather together. I will open up a teleportation channel and bring them back safely! ”

The lips of the face in the center of this vast voice moved and a voice came from it.

The voice contained a powerful magic power. It was as if as long as one heard this voice, they would believe in him!

“It’s the king of the gods! ”

The elders who believed in the universe palace immediately responded respectfully!

“Supreme God, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace has stolen the precious land of our belief universe and killed the disciples of our belief universe. We must not let him go! ”

The elder of the Ami Mountain Palace said to the king of gods with anger and hatred on his face!

“We already know about this. ”

The supreme God replied, but didn’t say anything else.

Because even they, even supreme gods, didn’t know how to do it!

The star field fragment had been obtained by the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, and he had already used it!

In that case, it had power comparable to the peak gods. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

In addition, the Dragon Palace’s ancient god Feed Kun master was comparable to the peak races.

They didn’t have any good ideas either!

It wasn’t that they couldn’t destroy the Dragon King, but they didn’t want to take this risk!

The belief universe had a heavenly yuan creation grade treasure. Letting a rank seven gods lead such a treasure into the starry universe was absolutely enough to kill the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!

However, the risk was too great!

If this treasure attracted the attention of the starry beasts in the starry universe, it would be like beating a dog to death!

Therefore, they could not use such a treasure to kill a Dragon King.

Without such a treasure, as the strongest expert below the supreme God level, would it be so easy to kill?

In addition, with the suppression of the starry universe, the chances of killing the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace were too small.

Even if there was a way, it wasn’t worth it.

The price was too great!

Therefore, the current Dragon King of the Dragon Palace had no way to deal with the belief of the universe.

This time, when he stepped into the starry universe, not only did he not gain anything, he even suffered heavy losses.

As for what happened next, he could only plan it all over again!

When the elders of the palace saw that the king of all gods did not respond, they stood there helplessly.

At this moment, they had no better ideas!

“It’s a pity that I didn’t get any useful information!”

At this moment, in the starry universe, Wang Xian had destroyed the army of the Amishan Palace.

This time, he did not receive any news from the army of the gods of the Amie Mountain Palace.

This made him slightly disappointed!

“We have destroyed two armies of the palace consecutively. I believe the belief universe must have received the news. They should not allow other armies to enter our territory! ”

Lan qingyue, who was standing at the side, spoke up!

“Yes, they have already given a warning. I’m afraid it will be difficult to hunt them down again. ”

Wang Xian nodded and looked to the left. “Lin Wenluo did not set up a scouting device at the left. Let’s go to the left and try our luck.”

A universe was still too big. Although the goal of the belief universe was also very big, it was still difficult to find them!

Next, I’m afraid it will depend on luck!
