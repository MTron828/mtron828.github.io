2838 2838 holy wings

“Dragon King, did you sense anything?”

When they saw the incipient holy wings appear behind Wang Xian, Tian Cheng and the rest immediately asked Wang Xian.

“Yes, the feathers of the incipient holy wings are inside.”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and looked inside.

“Dragon King, it’s very dangerous inside the windless forest. Even those in the celestial emperor realm can not be underestimated.”

“The seemingly calm windless forest is very terrifying. That is, those who enter can not create the slightest wind. Once the wind appears, these wind-attributed trees will attack directly.”

“But as long as something enters, unless it is illusory, it will definitely carry the wind. That is to say, once you enter, you will be attacked by the trees inside. The stronger the wind, the more trees will be attacked.”

“Some people say that this is the Holy Land for wind attribute cultivators from ancient races.”

The sky array reminded him.

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly and flew into the forest.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

The eight-limbed demonic fiend and the rest moved and followed closely behind.

Whoosh

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

When they entered the windless forest, the leaves of the surrounding trees trembled slightly. They made a rustling sound as if there was a gust of wind.

In the next moment, countless leaves from the trees attacked them directly.

The trees in the windless forest were at least tens of thousands of meters tall, and each tree had a few million leaves.

The densely packed leaves attacked them and covered them directly.

“Humph, how can a small attack stop us?”

Mo Sha snorted coldly. His entire body was protected by the darkness attribute. When the leaves landed on their bodies, they were immediately neutralized.

“Eh?”

At this moment, Wang Xian, who was at the side, let out a surprised cry.

He looked around and realized that there weren’t any leaves attacking him.

Wang Xian’s mind stirred. He sensed the incipient saint wings behind him and thought of one of the characteristics of the incipient saint wings.

However, this characteristic was of little value to Wang Xian.

He was a divine dragon and possessed seven attributes. He could adapt to most of the environment.

“Eh, Dragon King, why aren’t you being attacked? Could it be because of the incipient Saint Wings?”

The Heaven Array looked over and asked in astonishment.

“It should be.”

Wang Xian nodded and flew straight ahead.

The surrounding branches and leaves still did not attack him. He hesitated and waved his arm. A surge of energy attacked the tree at the side.

“Hualala!”

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

In the next moment, the branches and leaves attacked Wang Xian.

Wang Xian’s body shook as he blocked the attacks from the leaves.

After a round of attacks, the surrounding attacks stopped.

“It seems that if I were to make a move, I would still be attacked.”

Wang Xian mumbled.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

At the back, the eight-headed heaven formation and the rest flew over. The surrounding leaves and branches attacked continuously.

The attack power of the leaves could threaten a level one godly monarch. However, against them, they could not be hurt even if they did not try to block it intentionally.

“You guys go to other places. I will search here myself.”

Wang Xian saw that they were constantly being attacked. He hesitated for a moment before speaking.

“Dragon King, it’s more dangerous here. It’s better for us to stay by your side.”

Tian Chen and the rest said hurriedly.

“If you guys encounter danger here, I might not even be able to encounter danger.”

“You guys can leave now. With the incipient holy wings, it shouldn’t be a problem. I will contact you guys after I find the holy wings and Holy Feathers.”

Wang Xian said directly.

The demon formation and the rest looked at each other and nodded slowly.

“Dragon King, you must be careful!”

“Don’t Worry!”

Wang Xian replied and flew inside immediately based on the sensing from the incipient holy wings.

With the wings, Wang Xian could fly without being attacked. As long as he was careful not to be touched by the branches, he would be fine.

In comparison, it was much easier for him to fly with Mo Sha and the rest.

“Let’s go out. I’ll bring you guys to look for treasures.”

Seeing Wang Xian’s figure disappearing quickly, Mo sha and the rest said.

“Keke, do you know where there are treasures?”

Mo Sha Ba Qi’s eyes lit up as he asked immediately.

“I know more than all of you. Just follow me.”

Tian Chen said indifferently. The four of them turned around and left the windless forest.

“Eh? This Is? There are treasures?”

On the other side, Wang Xian stared at a tree in front of him after flying for two hours. His face revealed a look of surprise.

“This should be the wind jade from the mouth of the Heaven Formation. It’s like Jade and is formed purely from the laws of the wind attribute. It has a special ability and is extremely beneficial to wind attribute cultivators.”

Wang Xian mumbled as he looked at the wind jade that grew on the tree in front of him. Then, he moved to the front of him.

He stretched out his hand and plucked the wind jade directly.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

The moment the Wind Jade was plucked, numerous sharp leaves covered Wang Xian.

Millions of leaves landed on his body in an instant.

“It seems that the attack power of the trees here is a little higher. They can already threaten a level two immortal king powerhouse.”

Wang Xian sensed the attack that landed on his body and calculated in his heart.

He looked at the Wind Jade with his palm. He hesitated for a moment before placing it on his chest.

The trees in the windless forest were considered plants. He wanted to see if this thing had any special feelings towards the ancestral tree.

Buzz Buzz

Under his probing, there was indeed some response.

However, this response did not come from the ancestral tree. Instead, it came from the immortal slaying calabash on the ancestral tree.

The immortal-slaying calabash was a treasure that Wang Xian obtained in the imperial court.

It was indeed a supreme treasure. However, there were hundreds of immortal-slaying swords in the immortal-slaying calabash that could rival a peak godly monarch. However, none of them could threaten a godly monarch.

According to Wang Xian’s guess, the immortal-slaying calabash could only reach that level after the dragon palace was upgraded and the ancestral tree was upgraded.

The current immortal-slaying calabash was a little useless.

“Is this wind jade useful for the immortal-slaying calabash?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. With a thought, the immortal-slaying calabash immediately appeared in his hand.

Buzz

Slowly, the Wind Jade was absorbed by the immortal-slaying calabash. In less than two seconds, the wind jade was completely absorbed.

However, Wang Xian did not sense any changes in the immortal-slaying calabash.

“Perhaps, this wind jade can help the immortal-slaying calabash evolve?”

Wang Xian guessed in his heart. He moved his body and continued flying in.

Under the guidance of the primaless holy wings, the holy wings holy feathers should be in the deepest part of the windless forest.

He flew at a fast speed and encountered many wind jade along the way. All of them were plucked by him and absorbed by the immortal-slaying calabash.

The deeper he went, the stronger the attack of the leaves. In the end, the terrifying attack of the leaves of the wind-elemental law was sufficient to threaten a level nine godly monarch.

“I’m Close!”

Three days later, Wang Xian stopped and stared ahead.

The area in front of him had undergone a change. It was not densely packed with countless trees but a huge mountain peak.
