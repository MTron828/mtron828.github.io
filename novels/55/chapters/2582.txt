2583 2583 abyss killing each other

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The round abyss seed’s despairing voice rang out. Over a dozen of its divided bodies were instantly killed!

Corpses were left on the ground!

Boom Boom Boom

At the same time, Wang Xian, Ao Qi, and the rest of the members of the Dragon Palace also started to move!

They hid on both sides and looked at the 2000 to 3000 abyss seeds. The terrifying energy instantly covered an area of over 10 million kilometers!

The Five Elements Millstone was suspended in the sky. The formation above it instantly descended and formed a defense that was sufficient to trap a level 6 immortal King!

“Die!”

Wang Xian’s arm turned into a dragon claw and headed straight for the level 7 immortal King abyssal seed!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

Ao Qi and the rest were roaring furiously in the surroundings. Streaks of blood-red lightning shot towards all the abyssal seeds!

“Peng Peng Peng!”

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Ji Ji Ji!”

“Ga Ga Ga Ga!”

All sorts of screams rang out, the abyssal seeds that were ambushed instantly fell into Panic!

The abyssal seeds didn’t have much intelligence, relying on their instincts to hunt and kill, without their leader’s orders, they were like headless flies!

In an instant of attack, all the abyssal seeds below undying God emperor were killed!

When the rest of the abyssal seeds saw this scene, they immediately fled in all directions!

“Ji Ji Ji Ji!”

The abyssal seed with bone spikes stared at Wang Xian’s dragon claw with blood-red eyes. The dense bone spikes on its body stood up!

“WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH!”

The bone spikes went straight for Wang Xian’s Dragon Claw!

“Boom Boom Boom!”

In an instant, the sounds of explosions rang out continuously. A large amount of blood flowed out from Wang Xian’s Dragon Claw!

“The level seven abyss seed of the immortal deity king is indeed not easy to deal with!”

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a cold look!

“Dragon King, let us help!”

At this moment, the voices of Ao Yao and Ao Qitian came from the side!

Ao Yao’s strength was the strongest among them. The two of them quickly killed one of them and attacked the other!

“Finish it as soon as possible!”

Wang Xian roared. In order to prevent more powerful abyssal seeds from coming over from the abyssal seed lair, they had to be fast!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao qitian, Ao Qi, and Ao Yao instantly surrounded him. The four of them immediately surrounded and attacked the level seven immortal king abyssal seed!

Faced with the attacks of Wang Xian and the rest, the level seven abyssal seed did not have the strength to escape. It wanted to flee in fear!

“Crash!”

However, when Ao Qitian and Ao Qi sealed the entire world with the blood-red chains, the level 7 abyssal seed went berserk!

Two minutes later, ao Yao’s claws penetrated his body. Ao Qitian’s rod landed heavily on his head, ending his life!

“Die!”

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and saw that there were more than ten level 5 and 6 immortal king abyssal seeds fighting against the members of the Dragon Palace. He waved his dragon claw!

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

A series of miserable screams rang out as all the abyssal seeds were killed!

“Take the corpses away and change the location!”

Without any hesitation, Wang Xian waved his arm and collected the corpses one by one!

The rest of the members of the Dragon Palace also collected the corpses. They immediately flew towards the right side of the giant mountain!

“Dragon King, the attack of the abyssal seed is a little strange. Two members of the Dragon Palace were severely injured!”

When they were more than 100 million kilometers away from the giant peak, everyone stopped and Ao Qitian reported to Wang Xian!

“Tell them to recuperate first and not to participate in the battle!”

Wang Xian immediately said!

The attack of the abyssal seed was indeed a little strange. For example, the round abyssal seed could be divided into nearly 20 abyssal seeds to escape!

As for the abyssal seed with the bone spikes, it could shoot out its own bone spikes. The bone spikes could erupt with a terrifying explosion!

Even though the defense of Wang Xian’s dragon claws was very strong, he would bleed instantly!

...

If he was not careful, he might be severely injured or even die!

It was much easier for the godly king to fall here than it was outside!

“Continue to attract!”

Wang Xian set up the formation and placed the dragon’s blood on the side as he waited quietly!

Perhaps the dragon’s blood was extremely attractive to the abyssal seeds, but this time, there were still many abyssal seeds flying towards them!

“It’s a little more troublesome this time. There are three types of level seven immortal king abyssal seeds at the front. Ao Yao, pay attention!”

“There are more than 300 immortal king abyssal seeds. A little less. Ao crab, Duan Jinming, you guys take care of the rest. This time, be careful!”

Half an hour later, when the roars of the abyss seeds were heard, Wang Xian’s eyes gleamed as he reminded them one by one!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The members of the Dragon Palace nodded solemnly!

“Ga Ga Ga!”

...

This was an abyss race. They had four pitch-black skeletal wings and an incomparably sharp head!

At the tail, there was a meatball with a barb on it!

There were a total of about 2,000 of them, but there were three level 7 undying godly monarch abyss species!

“Kill!”

When the 2,000 abyss species flew over, Wang Xian roared and immediately locked onto one!

Ao Qitian ao crab and the rest also locked onto one. Ao Yao hid in the surrounding void and waited for an opportunity to strike!

“Ga Ga Ga!”

Seeing Wang Xian and the rest who suddenly appeared, this race from the Abyss gave off a brutal aura. They charged forward without any hesitation!

“Kill!”

The members of the Dragon Palace let out a furious roar. An overwhelming nomological force blasted forward!

The battle began!

In front of the top-tier combat strength, the Dragon Palace only had one more. Therefore, this battle must be very difficult!

A violent battle rang out in the Abyss. Other than the three level seven abyssal seeds, the rest of the abyssal seeds were all killed by the members of the Dragon Palace ten minutes later!

However, these three abyssal seeds were extremely powerful. Wang Xian and the rest were struggling to fight against them bit by bit!

Seeing their own clansmen die, the three abyssal seeds became even more violent!

The surrounding formation was destroyed and the sound was transmitted to the location of the giant peak. At the entrance of the giant peak, there were many abyssal seeds looking over with cold eyes!

When Wang Xian saw this scene, he knew that it was not good!

“Retreat while fighting!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Wang Xian transmitted his voice to Ao qi and AO qitian!

Following that, the three of them retreated rapidly. Very quickly, they retreated 200 to 300 million kilometers!

The three level seven immortal king level abyssal seeds were still chasing after them crazily!

Buzz

Not long after, a black and white shadow appeared behind the abyssal seeds that Wang Xian was fighting against!

“Pu Pu Pu!”

The black and white shadow instantly penetrated through its huge head and entered its body!

“Pu!”

A second later, ao Yao’s body emerged from the body of the level seven immortal King abyssal seed!

“Dragon King, take care of one!”

Ao Yao said with a smile!

“Take care of the other two immediately!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were sparkling as he immediately charged over!
