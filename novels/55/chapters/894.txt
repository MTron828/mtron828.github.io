Chapter 895: 0896, daylight assassination

Translator: 549690339

“Bastard, how dare you kill a member of the Dogfish mercenary group!”

At the city guard office, the vice leader of the Dogfish mercenary group and the other members of the Dogfish mercenary group had received the news. When they saw the corpse, they roared angrily.

“Vice leader of the dogfish mercenary group, the deceased is not one person. The corpse of the other person has been taken away. I wonder if this person is a member of your dogfish mercenary group!”

A city guard took out a portrait and asked him.

Vice Commander Dogfish’s brows twitched violently. “He’s one of our members!”

“The murderer left behind a red piece of paper. We can’t find any other information. It should be the work of the killer. If vice commander dogfish has enough evidence to prove the murderer, we can arrest him!”

The city guard handed a red piece of paper to him and said.

Vice leader Dogfish took the paper with an embarrassed expression when he saw it, but he didn’t recognize the words on it.

In the entire transcendence continent, other than Feng Luan who had been to Earth, no one could recognize the word ‘congratulations’.

“Bring the corpse with us. Let’s Go!”

Vice leader dogfish said to his subordinates with an embarrassed expression.

“It’s the vice leader!”

The members of the squawk shark mercenary group nodded, and their expressions were a little ugly.

This was the fifth brother who went to spy on that young man, and now all of them were dead.

“Vice leader, the one who killed the Eastern Han must be that young man. Since he dared to come back, he might... might be prepared. Do We... do we still need to spy on him?”

Wu Dazhuang walked out of the city guards and spoke to the vice regiment commander in a slightly frightened voice.

At this moment, he felt extremely regretful. Yesterday, he had even mocked that young man.

Could he have been assassinated just like his own dead squad members?

Just thinking about it made him feel a little afraid.

“Hu, send our brothers to guard the four city gates. Once he leaves, report immediately. I’ll go look for Bei Qianjun and Qing Guya!”

The vice commander of the horned shark mercenary group said with a cold expression.

“Interesting. They must know who did it or who bribed the assassins!”

At this moment, a woman was standing by the window on the second floor of the City Guard’s office. She smiled as she watched the members of the horned shark mercenary group leave.

“It’s very normal for these mercenary groups to kill each other. It’s also very normal for them to hire assassins!”

An old man beside him said respectfully.

“It’s alright to cause a little trouble. It’s not good if it really gets out of hand. Forget it, it’s not my fault even if you testify against me!”

The woman smiled and shook her head.

...

“Dragon King!”

At this moment, a group of drakonids walked over from the remote room that Wang Xian had bought.

“Dragon King, we have all the information regarding the residences of the members of the Dogfish mercenary group!”

“Also, we have also obtained the information regarding bei Qianjun’s family and Qinggu Cliff!”

The ten DRAKONIDS stood beside Wang Xian and reported to him.

“Alright. Also, you have to think of a way to publicize the dragon assassin organization and let others know our contact details. Also, how to pay the remuneration!”

Wang Xian received the information with a smile and handed it to the side.

Ao Yao, who was hiding at the side, received it directly.

“It’s the Dragon King. Some assassin organizations will establish their own spies. There must be at least a dozen spies in each city. We can also develop our spies!”

Long Yi and the rest hesitated for a moment before saying.

“Develop our spies?”

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment before saying, “You guys go and find some people whose lifespan is about to expire. Then, we promise to let them live for a few hundred more years. The price is to become our spies!”

“Live for a few hundred years?”

The group of Drakonids was stunned for a moment before they revealed a shocked expression.

Life Span. Many people would definitely agree to let them be our spy if they were given life span.

“That’s right. All of you go and look for those smart people. Those whose abilities are below transcendent level one will become our spy. We will also promise to give them some rewards. The number of people is around twenty!”

Wang Xian said.

Those who were not at transcendent level did not have a long life span. However, if they possessed the divine dragon bloodline, their lifespan would increase by at least a few hundred years.

With a few hundred years of lifespan and a fixed monthly reward, it would be easy for them to find spies.

“It’s the Dragon King. Leave this to us. We will definitely find the most suitable person!”

A DRAKONID responded immediately.

“Alright, Go!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

This afternoon, the two people who died here did not cause any commotion.

The dogfish mercenary group did not spread the news either.

However, the failure of the undercurrent assassin group and the death of five of their subordinates had already made the dogfish mercenary group wary.

Night arrived very quickly. It was in the base of the dogfish mercenary group.

“Tell our brothers to be careful today. Don’t Sleep and be vigilant. Also, Ao Kuang, go to the undercurrent assassin group and ask them why they haven’t made a move yet!”

In a courtyard that spanned five to six acres, an old man sat in the center.

He held a walking stick in his hand and frowned as he spoke to Ao Kuang.

“Yes, leader. I’ve already gone to undercurrent’s side. The other party said that the assassins they sent out have already been killed. The other party’s strength is at least transcendent fourth rank. They need to send out transcendent fifth rank assassins. They need to add another 500,000 mid-grade spirit stones!”

Ao Kuang hurriedly replied.

“500,000 mid-grade spirit stones? Why aren’t they going to rob them?”

The Old Man’s face was slightly embarrassed as he stared at AO Kuang with dissatisfaction.

“Leader, I’ll pay for this. He killed my daughter. No matter how great the price is, I’ll destroy him!”

Ao Kuang saw the leader’s expression and hurriedly said with an ugly expression.

“En, I’ll leave it to you. Hurry up and kill that brat. I don’t wish for any more brothers to die because of this!”

The old man slowly nodded.

“Yes!”

...

Night arrived quietly. Tonight, regardless of whether it was the horned shark mercenary group, the bei Qianjun family, or the Qing Guya family, none of them slept.

They had no choice but to be careful since they were suspected of being assassinated by an assassin.

As night fell, everyone was cultivating in the base.

Within the horned shark mercenary group, there were four middle-aged watchmen on high alert.

“It’s almost dawn. There’s no movement at all!”

“Our base has a transcendent tier 5 array defense. The moment the other party steps in, we’ll be able to sense it!”

“There’s nothing wrong with being careful. There’s nothing wrong with being on guard for the entire night!”

The four middle-aged men laughed as they chatted. As a powerful mercenary group, the reason they were able to reach this point was not just because of their strength.

It was also because of their experience and patience. Even if there was a hint of danger, they would be 100% alert.

They had provoked a young man and suspected that he had some strength, so they would treat him 100% .

A lion uses its full strength when hunting a rabbit!

When the sky was completely bright, the four middle-aged men became even more relaxed. There were even sounds coming from some rooms in the base. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Seeing this situation, the four middle-aged men also walked into the rooms with smiles on their faces, ready to wash up.

At this moment, almost invisible ripples appeared in the sky.
