Chapter 1142: 1143 Beast Tamer’s inheritance

Translator: 5496903

“This is the inheritance of a beast tamer. How to tame ferocious beasts and demonic beasts. This is to make use of the pressure of the bloodline. This method is similar to the way the divine dragon rules low-level creatures. It will be of great help to me too!”

Wang Xian looked at the words entering his mind one by one. The blood-like words slowly returned to the normal bloodline of demonic beasts.

“TSK TSK, this inheritance is really powerful. It’s so powerful. It’s a pity that old man Bai Xun didn’t place his interspatial ring here. There’s only the inheritance here!”

When all the words entered his mind, a hint of excitement flashed across Wang Xian’s face.

The liquid that formed the words was not an ordinary liquid. Instead, it was the bloodline of the demonic beast tarsal bone.

According to old man Bai Xun, the tarsal bone demonic beast had already become his life-bound demonic beast.

The term ‘life-bound demonic beast’was created by him. Through his own method, he had fused with the tarsal bone demonic beast and directly controlled the tarsal bone demonic beast.

He also possessed the full strength of the tarsal bone demonic beast.

It was also because of this tarsal bone demonic beast that he was able to achieve his current achievements.

The tarsal bone demonic beast was a top-notch demonic beast that could reach the sixth level of the Seethrough realm.

Even within the five great empires, the bloodline of a demonic beast of this level would be snatched away by countless experts.

It was even very likely that the bloodline of a demonic beast of this level would cause a bloodbath.

“If I were to sell the bloodline of a demonic beast of this level, how terrifying would the resources obtained be?”

Wang Xian muttered in his heart as his eyes revealed a burning expression.

However, a look of contemplation appeared on his face as a figure appeared in his mind.

“Forget it. I owe her. I’ll give this bloodline of the demonic beast to her!”

Wang Xian mumbled as a smile appeared on his face. With a move of his arm, he stored the bloodline of the tarsal bone demonic beast into his storage spirit bag.

After coming out of the demonic beast sculpture, Wang Xian looked around and continued his search.

According to the records of the Bai Xun Master, there were two insightful void-level bloodlines and fifteen extraordinary-level bloodlines in the sculptures in the main hall.

These bloodlines could nurture more than a dozen top-notch families. They could even use these bloodlines to build a dynasty.

After searching for nearly a hundred sculptures consecutively, the number of sculptures in the main hall became fewer and fewer. The entire main hall was in a mess.

There were pieces of sculptures everywhere. Wang Xian frowned slightly. He didn’t find another demon beast bloodline of the Seethrough level. It should have turned into dried blood by now.

“What a bunch of wastrels!”

Wang Xian glanced at the group of Seethrough experts and thought to himself.

“F * ck, what are these things? Didn’t those two damn beasts say that this is the burial place of the Bai Xun Elder? Why is there nothing here?”

After another 10 minutes, a profound void martial artist shouted impatiently.

They had dug three feet into the main hall, but they did not find any treasures.

This made them extremely angry.

“You came in before us, did you find any treasures?”

The Wind Howl Dynasty’s third rank profound void martial artist stared at Feng Luan with a gloomy face and asked coldly.

For a moment, the other five profound void martial experts also stared at her coldly.

“If I obtain the treasure, I will have already left. Moreover, the Bai Xun Old Man’s treasure is related to the bloodline pet egg. Do you think I can hide them?”

Feng Luan stared at them coldly with an expressionless face.

This caused the expressions of the six profound void martial experts to be somewhat unsightly.

The Bai Xun Old Man’s treasure definitely had the pet egg and various bloodlines. The pet egg could not be stored in the interspatial ring.

Even the bloodlines of fierce beasts and demon beasts could not be stored in the interspatial ring unless there was a special container.

Moreover, if she had really received the inheritance of old man Bai Xun, she would have left long ago. How could she still be here to accompany them.

This made the six insightful emptiness realm experts’expressions turn bad.

“F * ck, I don’t believe that there isn’t any treasure in the Hall!”

One of the profound void martial experts was somewhat unwilling. He pulled out his long sword and directly slashed forward.

The terrifying sword ray directly slashed out a trace that was a thousand meters long and three to four meters deep. This trace directly pierced through the entire main hall.

The other profound void martial experts didn’t say anything. They looked at the trace on the ground. Below, there were rocks and nothing else.

“Could it be that the Bai Xun Old Man’s treasure is really not here?”

Feng Luan also frowned. She was the first to come here, but she did not find anything.

She moved her arm, and a fire phoenix directly attacked the surroundings. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

However, nothing unusual was detected. All the items were directly turned into ashes in the flames.

“Damn it, we wasted so much time and I was seriously injured!”

The face of the expert at level three of the Seethrough realm from the Howling Wind dynasty turned black.

He had come all the way to the star-moon kingdom, yet he didn’t obtain anything.

If he had known earlier that he would enter the Hundred Beasts City right from the start, he might have been able to obtain some pet eggs.

“Phew, let’s Go!”

Feng Luan shook her head helplessly and said to Wang Xian.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian was expressionless. He nodded his head and followed Feng Luan out.

The other six insightful emptiness realm experts searched for a few more minutes unwillingly. The entire main hall was almost destroyed, but they still couldn’t find any treasures.

Finally, everyone left in anger.

Wang Xian and Feng Luan left the main hall. As soon as they arrived outside, they saw that there were still many demonic beasts and ferocious beasts wreaking havoc in the hundred beasts city.

There were also many demonic beasts and ferocious beasts that ran to other places.

There were thousands of demonic beasts attacking in front of the city walls of Bright Moon City. The experts in the city were defending themselves.

However, the strange thing was that there weren’t many demonic beasts and ferocious beasts or even human corpses on the ground.

When Wang Xian saw this situation, a smile appeared on his face.

“Although there aren’t any other big gains, it’s still not bad. Let’s go. Let’s return to Bright Moon City. You can arrange for the dragon Spike!”

Flying in the sky, Feng Luan said to Wang Xian calmly.

“HMM? Did you obtain any treasures in the main hall?”

Wang Xian was slightly taken aback as he asked in astonishment.

“No, didn’t I give you five pet eggs? Three of them are at transcendent level seven, one is at transcendent level eight, and one is at transcendent level nine. They are worth billions of mid-grade spirit stones!”

Feng Luan smiled faintly and asked, “How was it? Did you get anything?”

“I’m Alright!”

“Huh?”

Suddenly, Wang Xian saw a few familiar figures scanning the sky. He changed his expression slightly.

“I have an enemy. Cover me for a while. Let’s leave quickly!”

Seeing the third prince who was still unwilling to find him, Wang Xian’s eyes turned cold as he said hurriedly.

“Huh?”

Feng Luan looked over and waved her arm to block Wang Xian. She nodded and flew toward Bright Moon City quickly.

“You didn’t obtain any treasures, right?”

Bright Moon City was a little chaotic at this moment. There were no void interpretation experts in the city. Feng Luan flew straight to the room of the restaurant.

She looked at Wang Xian and asked with a smile.
