“This fellow, Tan Lang!”

The disciples of the eight barrens saw the thin middle-aged man directly attacking the youth. They frowned slightly and slowly shook their heads.

However, they did not stop him.

Tan Lang was the middle-aged man’s name. As for whether it was his real name, they did not know either.

Tan Lang was an alchemist grandmaster and knew a lot about medicinal pills.

!!

At the same time, they also knew that ravenous wolf was famous for his greed.

Once he encountered a treasure, as long as he had the chance to obtain it, he would never give up.

Seeing ravenous taking out the imprisonment ring and attacking the young man, coupled with Ravenous Wolf’s words just now, they knew that the elixirs that the young man consumed were not simple. Ravenous Wolf wanted to make a move.

The people from bhang and the rest watched indifferently with a smile on their faces.

“HMM?”

At this moment, Wang Xian, who was sitting cross-legged, slowly opened his eyes. His gaze was fixed on a confinement ring that was heading towards him.

His gaze was fixed on the greedy middle-aged man in front of him. There was not the slightest fluctuation in his eyes.

Buzz

The confinement ring came to the top of his head and locked onto him.

“Hehe!”

When the thin middle-aged man in front saw that the confinement ring was locking onto him, his face was filled with excitement and greed.

“Bang!”

A hint of coldness appeared in Wang Xian’s eyes. The imprisonment ring above his head suddenly collapsed.

“Boom!”

The next moment, greed widened his eyes. His eyes were filled with horror.

He stared at his entire body in horror. He realized that his body was actually slowly cracking apart. His body was dissipating rapidly.

A great terror descended on his heart. The threat of death caused his body to tremble violently.

“No!”

His eyes were filled with fear and despair as he stared at Wang Xian in front of him in horror.

At the back, a group of disciples from the eight barrens who were watching the show showed a shocked expression when they saw tan lang’s body disintegrating and dissipating rapidly.

“Oh no, that young man is very strong!”

Brother Long, who was the leader, had a drastic change in expression as he shouted in shock.

His body moved, wanting to protect Tan Lang.

“No no no!”

However at this time, Tan Lang’s body had completely crumbled, disappearing bit by bit.

He could never imagine why this youth’s strength was so terrifying.

Back when they tried to snatch Feng Yu from him, he didn’t even dare to resist, why did he unleash such terrifying strength now.

To be able to render a level 6 immortal king like him defenseless, how strong was he?

“HMPH!”

Looking at Tan Lang’s body turning into ashes, Wang Xian snorted coldly and looked at brother long who was trying to save Tan Lang.

Boom

In the next moment, a terrifying flame appeared around brother long.

“What!”

“Oh no, go and Get Help!”

The flame surrounded brother long. His face was filled with horror as he stared at Wang Xian, who was sitting cross-legged. Immediately, he shouted loudly.

Boom

However, at this moment, the flame grew stronger and enveloped his body. It caused him to dissipate before he could even let out a scream.

He was dead.

From the death of ravenous wolf to Brother Long’s death, everything happened in an instant.

However, the young man who was sitting there did not move at all. He was staring at them coldly.

What kind of strength was this?

Immortal King level eight? could an immortal king level eight do it?

“Boom Boom Boom!”

At this moment, all of their bodies trembled. Their eyes were filled with shock.

They had offended an existence that they could not afford to offend.

A middle-aged man hurriedly took out an item and shot it into the sky.

The distress signal of the disciples of the eight barren sect was transmitted from the sky above the windless forest.

Wang Xian raised his head and looked over. He frowned slightly.

“What a Killjoy!”

He stood up slowly and a trace of might was emitted from his body.

This was the second time that the group of people in front of him had met.

The last time, when Wang Xian was about to make a move, he happened to be invincible in terms of combat techniques. They had escaped a calamity.

However, now, they were actually provoking him and using the imprisonment ring to imprison him.

What were they trying to do?

Rob Him? Or kill him?

Hehe!

Wang Xian stared at them and couldn’t help but feel a little amused. They were also awesome and lucky to be able to rob the Celestial Emperor.

“What a terrifying might!”

Traces of might shot out from Wang Xian’s body. Their expressions changed drastically and their foreheads were filled with cold sweat.

“It has nothing to do with us. It has nothing to do with us!”

A few middle-aged men shouted hurriedly.

A few young men beside them were trembling slightly and their figures were illusory.

They wanted to escape back to their divine kingdom.

Boom

However, at the next moment, a terrifying aura shook slightly and their illusory figures gradually solidified.

“This is impossible…”

The few of them roared in disbelief as their bodies trembled.

What kind of existence was this young man?

“A bunch of people who are looking for death!”

Wang Xian said indifferently. The surrounding energy trembled slightly.

A wave of energy that made them feel despair rushed towards his body.

“No!”

The remaining 20 or so people roared in fear.

“Peng Peng Peng!”

At the next moment, the corpses fell to the ground one after another.

“Sou Sou Sou!”

The corpses fell and had no defense. They stirred the wind and the surrounding trees began to attack one after another.

Leaves and branches fell on their bodies, piercing through their bodies. It was abnormally tragic.

They had brought this upon themselves and could not live!

“Over there, over there is the location of our eight desolate disciples’distress signal!”

“What kind of danger have they encountered? The disciples who came this time are all at the divine king level. Could it be that they are fighting over Feng Yu?”

At the same time, not far away from here, more than a dozen figures were rapidly flying over.

In other places, the eight desolate disciples’distress signal also attracted many eight desolate experts and disciples to quickly rush over.

When some disciples from other factions saw the distress signal, they revealed curious expressions on their faces. Some of those who were close to them also rushed over.

Sending the signal flare at this time was most likely for the sake of snatching Feng Yu.

They were all here for Feng Yu. Naturally, they had to go and see if they could gain anything.

“Eh? Someone is rushing over so quickly!”

At this moment, Wang Xian was walking towards the corpses. Before he arrived in front of the corpses, he sensed someone flying over quickly.

There were more than a dozen figures. They were slightly stronger than the people he had killed.

The leader was an immortal King Level 9 elder.

“Where are our disciples from the eight barrens?”

More than a dozen people flew over. One of the elders scanned the surroundings and shouted doubtfully. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Look down!”

One of them shouted immediately. More than a dozen of them looked down.

When they saw more than 20 corpses, a strong murderous intent appeared on their faces.

Their eyes soon landed on Wang Xian, who was in front of the corpses.

“Surround him!”

An elder roared immediately. A strong murderous intent shot out from his body.
