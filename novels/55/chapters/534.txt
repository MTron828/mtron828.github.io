Chapter 535: The World Is The Enemy

Argh!

Shrieks of panic and desperation were heard as it was total overkill.

In less than a minute, the Crimson Bug had been totally wiped out.

None of the forces would ever believe such a speed when the word got out.

Crimson Bug was comparable to the existence of a Sacred Sect. Yet, it had been wiped out in a brief moment.

Even a Dan Realm Expert had been killed easily.

Wang Xian was satisfied with what he saw. The power of the golden swordfish clan had gone beyond his expectation.

Given their combat power, it was not something dragonians could match up with.

After all, one was a man-made dragonian, while the other one had gone through the baptism of the Dragon Pool who had a chance to evolve into a real Dragon in the future.

Eek, eek!

Countless crimson bugs were crawling around on the floor while Wang Xian swung his arm and hurled out the Nether Skull. Black Nether Flame immediately shrouded across the bugs and corpses.

Sizzle!

A somewhat petrifying sound was heard as the Nether Skull opened its mouth to gobble up the Nether Flame.

The Deity Lady of Nether Flame Denomination would have never expected the Nether Skull could have devoured so much energy in Wang Xian’s hand.

“Amitabha, which benefactor is taking lives out here? Does he want to break the rules?”

At this time, a voice came from the sky as twenty bald monks emerged from the mountain to the South.

They were wearing crimson Kasayas with blood-red beads in their hands. They looked down with brows furrowed.

“Crimson Bug? Their disciples are all wiped out?”

Another voice came from the southwest. One by one, experts who had sickles and were dressed in oversized black hoodies sprouted out from the mountains. Their eyes were glimmering with black radiance.

“Hur? Dragon King of Dragon Sect? How dare you guys show up at this place!”

A group of experts were suspended in the air, looking over in Wang Xian’s direction. Nie Wuya, at the center, glowered at Wang Xian with a hateful expression.

“The Dragon King of Dragon Sect actually wiped out the Crimson Bugs of Diabolism. Gasp!”

Several experts from Sacred Sects leaped to the summit of a mountain at the southeast. When they looked over here, they sucked in a cold breath.

Wang Xian swept his gaze across Donghua Sacred Sect and several sects from Diabolism. With his lips slightly drawn, he said, “Crimson Bug offended me, so they deserve to die!”

“Dragon King, I think you’re simply digging your own grave by coming here today. After our Sect Leader eliminates Emperor Qi, it will be your doom!”

Nie Wuya stared at Wang Xian with bloodshot eyes as he bellowed in a low voice.

“What happened last night was just the beginning. There’s no hurry, because I’ll annihilate Donghua Sacred Sect!”

Wang Xian looked in the direction of Nie Wuya and spoke with a flat tone.

“Fine, let’s see who will be annihilated!”

Nie Wuya clenched his fists tight as he snorted and leaped down.

“So it’s the Dragon King from Dragon Sect who annihilated the Remains and now, Crimson Bug. Are you declaring war with us?” asked the experts from Reeds Spirits coldly, with their black clothing and sickles in their hands.

“I’ll kill whoever messes with me!” Wang Xian looked over and continued with an overbearing vibe, “You guys are no exception!”

“Amitabha, if you commit a killing sin, you’ll go to Hell!”

The experts from Devil Spirits Temple slowly spoke. They took one look at Wang Xian before they turned and stalked away.

Wang Xian curled his lips slightly. With an arm swing, the Nether Skull flew back into his hand, leaving a floor of ashes.

“Let’s go!”

Wang Xian headed to the tallest peak of Huashan with a smile on his face.

He did not have the slightest care about annihilating Crimson Bug effortlessly.

The arrival of the golden swordfish clan enhanced the foundation of Wang Xian by two to three folds. Roving Sword could fight against a Budding Realm Expert. Wang Xian could, too, handle or kill one Budding Realm Expert.

Judging from the situation in the Underworld now, the strongest would be Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi. Both of them were at most Budding Realm Experts.

He could fight them off. Hence, he was fearless!

“The annihilation of Crimson Bug only took a few minutes!”

“After the despairing screams, the unparalleled expert of Crimson Bug finally knew they were from Dragon Sect. Hence, there was no hesitation in getting all the disciples to flee.”

“I seem to have heard voices from Donghua Sacred Sect Experts too. All the Underworld Experts have heard the growl and cries!”

Upon seeing the departure of Dragon Sect, the forces from the Underworld then slowly followed behind.

When they spotted the ashes tracing a human shape on the right-hand side, they took in some cold air.

Within a short period of time, a terrifying force that was comparable to a Sacred Sect was annihilated. The power of Dragon Sect was domineering.

“We cannot afford to offend Dragon Sect!”

The Huashan summit had become a scenic area that was somewhat important. However, no ordinary men except Martial Artists were here today.

When Wang Xian was nearing the Huashan summit, all the Martial Artists were already packing the place.

When these Martial Artists saw Wang Xian and the gang, they were slightly stunned, with a look of awe in their eyes.

“Hur? This feeling is...?”

Suddenly, Wang Xian’s brow furrowed as he looked towards a mountain on his left.

This was Wang Xian’s second trip to Huashan, and it was also his second time having such a peculiar feeling.

The first time was at the legendary Zhong Fang Immortal Bridge, another quizzical aspect of Huashan.

When Wang Xian had attempted to look in that direction with his Piercing Eyes, he seemed to be blocked by unique energy.

Today, the feeling got intense when he was nearing the Huashan summit.

He squinted his eyes slightly with blue and red radiance flashing in them.

I’m still blocked out by a kind of energy. It’s just that the energy is weaker at this spot!

Why does Huashan always give me a kind of feeling that there is another world hidden away within it?

That energy feels like some kind of array in the Dragon Palace. Is there a great array in this place?

Wang Xian had all the questions in his mind as he pondered while frowning. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Strange! Strange! Strange!

Arrays were something that existed in legends. The only array in the Underworld that he came across was in Donghua Sacred Sect, and the power of that array was so-so.

The array over here had reached an astounding level, such that he could only sense a slight degree of creepiness with his current strength.

Just as Wang Xian was standing there deep in thought, the various sects and clans from the Underworld were heading to the foot of the tallest peak of Huashan.

When those Martial Artists passed by and saw Wang Xian deep in thought, they were whispering among themselves.

As soon as they arrived at the foot of the tallest peak, the alliance of the orthodox sects and Diabolism had already divided into two distinctive camps.

In terms of numbers, Diabolism had fewer people than the alliance of the orthodox sects by a few folds. However, every Diabolism Martial Artist was exuding a powerful aura.

Before Sect Leader Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi of Diabolism arrived, all the Martial Artists were exchanging conversations in low voices.

At this time, Donghua Sacred Sect released an order stating that the alliance of the orthodox sects would be eliminating Dragon Sect after Sect Leader Nie Wushuang claimed victory.

Apart from Sui Clan and Xiao Clan, who disagreed with it, all the Sacred Sects and Sacred Clans in the alliance of the orthodox sects were assumed closed.

As for Diabolism, all the denominations in Diabolism had already decided that they would exterminate Dragon Sect after the battle.

Dragon Sect was going to have the world as their enemy!
