Chapter 1381: 1381, you are from a noble race

“Get up. Your bloodline is extremely noble. It’s just because your bloodline is too thin!”

Wang Xian supported him with his arm. The Fire Hammer tribe leader stood up and lowered his head respectfully.

“Thank you, Dragon King. If it weren’t for you, our fire hammer tribe would have been like this for generations. We are just a lowly level eight supernatural race!”

The leader of the Fire Hammer clan said gratefully.

“Duan Jinming’s bloodline is one level higher than yours. Are you willing to join the Dragon Palace?”

Wang Xian looked at Duan Jinming and asked him.

“Join the Dragon Palace?”

Duan Jinming was a little stunned.

“Jinming, hurry up and agree. It’s time for our fire hammer clan to rise!”

The leader of the Fire Hammer clan hurriedly said to Duan Jinming.

After absorbing his divine dragon blood essence, the fire hammer clan leader had completely submitted to Wang Xian. Naturally, he would help him to subdue the entire fire hammer clan.

“Yes, it’s the clan leader!”

Duan Jinming nodded his head. After witnessing Wang Xian’s magical means, he would agree even if it was his own choice.

“Alright, Swallow the blood essence. You will automatically receive the fire gold dragon seed’s inheritance!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and a drop of blood essence floated beside him.

Duan Jinming nodded his head and consumed it directly.

Following that, Wang Xian injected his dragon qi into his body directly.

Arms appeared on his body one after another. Initially, he only had six arms, but now he had twelve arms.

His strength had also risen to the first level of the Seethrough realm.

“Thank you, Dragon King. Clan leader, my strength has also risen to the first level of the Seethrough void stage. We are no longer a lowly race!”

A minute later, Duan Jinming shouted excitedly.

“Hurry up and thank Dragon King!”

“Yes, yes. Thank you, Dragon King. Thank you, Dragon King!”

As he spoke, Duan Jinming knelt on the ground and kowtowed to him.

“Get Up!”

Wang Xian smiled. After becoming a member of the Dragon Palace, it didn’t mean that they had lost their emotions and desires.

Other than being 100% loyal to the Dragon King, they were just like humans.

“My strength has reached the first level of the Seethrough void stage. Will I be able to be together with the third lady in the future?”

Duan Jinming stood up and said excitedly.

“Of course. I have agreed to your marriage. I will definitely help you marry the third lady back to the Dragon Palace. Haha!”

Wang Xian smiled.

The future development of the Dragon Palace would definitely involve the members of the Dragon Palace getting married, giving birth to children, and then going through a cycle.

This was the best way for a top-tier force to live.

Currently, the Dragon Palace lacked some vitality. They were all subdued by Wang Xian before they developed intelligence. They lacked some human experience.

If the Fire Hammer clan were to join in the future, it would bring more vitality to the dragon palace.

Furthermore, the Fire Hammer clan had over two thousand members, which could be considered as a huge increase in the number of members of the Dragon Clan.

As for asking Duan Jinming to marry the third young lady of the Gilded Gold Clan, Wang Xian was also very supportive.

“Thank you, Dragon King. Thank you, Dragon King!”

The honest and honest Duan Jinming immediately knelt down and thanked him.

“No Need, Duan Yanlie. Are you working for the Gilded Gold Clan? Quit your job and lead your clansmen to find a place to Live!”

“A small gilded gold clan is not qualified to make members of my Dragon Palace work!”

Wang Xian said to the fire hammer clan leader.

“It’s the Dragon King. We will handle this matter immediately!”

The fire hammer clan leader replied immediately.

“Okay, I will give you some spiritual stones. You Go and find a place to live. We will stay here for a few days and find a place to sell some weapons. After the auction, I will bring you back to the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian continued to give him orders.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The chief of the Fire Hammer tribe nodded.

“As for Jin Ming, don’t worry. Before we leave, I’ll bring you to the gilded gold tribe to propose marriage!”

Wang Xian looked at Duan Jinming who was hesitating and smiled.

“Thank you, Dragon King. Thank you, Dragon King!”

Duan Jinming smiled honestly.

Wang Xian smiled as well. As the second peak dragon in the Dragon Palace, he naturally wouldn’t treat his subordinates badly.

Buzz

Wang Xian waved his arm and the formation disappeared, revealing the worried fire hammer clansmen outside.

“Clansmen!”

“Jin Ming!”

Seeing that they had come out safely, the clansmen immediately shouted.

“Clansmen, there are some things that I can’t tell you right now!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The Fire Hammer clan leader was a little agitated when he saw his clansmen. “But what I want to tell you is that our fire hammer clan is not a lowly clan!”

As he spoke, an incomparably powerful aura was emitted from his body.

“What?”

The aura of the profound void tier caused the surrounding two thousand plus fire hammer clansmen to be instantly stunned. Their eyes were wide open, filled with disbelief.

“Clan leader, this is... My God, the profound void tier. Our clan actually has a profound void tier expert!”

“Haha, the Clan Leader actually became a profound void tier expert. We are no longer a weak clan!”

All the members of the Fire Hammer clan stared at the chief of the Fire Hammer clan with excitement.

“The Gilded Gold clan doesn’t treat us badly. Let’s finish their work first. We will move out of here tomorrow. We will talk about some things at night!”

The chief of the Fire Hammer clan said to everyone. Under the curiosity of the members of the Fire Hammer clan, they continued to work.

Some of the Fire Hammer tribe members looked at Wang Xian and their faces were filled with astonishment.

“Oh my God, look at Jin Ming. Jin Ming’s aura is so terrifying. It turns out that Jin Ming has also reached the insightful emptiness realm!”

“Jin Ming actually gained six more arms. His forging speed is so terrifying. This...”

Very soon, everyone’s attention fell on Duan Jin Ming.

His strength had reached the insightful void stage and he had twelve arms.

Twelve arms forging weapons at the same time, forging twelve weapons at the same time.

In just over a minute, all twelve extraordinary level six weapons were forged.

This terrifying forging speed stunned even Wang Xian.

Similarly, the Fire Hammer clan leader, who had eight arms, was also extremely fast.

“This is insane. Even though I have the origin forging technique, I’m still not as fast as them!”

“Forging more than ten arms at the same time. Even if it’s a transcendent level nine weapon, with Jin Ming’s talent, he can forge twelve in two minutes at most!”

“Crazy!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were burning as he looked at all the members of the Fire Hammer clan.

He didn’t leave. There were still two days left before the king’s auction. He would be with the fiery hammer clan in these few days.

He definitely couldn’t let anything happen to these precious subordinates of his.

Wang Xian sat at the side and leisurely looked at the waterfall at the side. From time to time, he would look at Duan Jinming and the rest.

Initially, it would take them a day to complete the task. However, with the presence of Duan Jinming and the Fiery Hammer clan leader, it was completed very quickly.

“What, you want to leave here? I think you’re courting death. Our Gilded Gold Clan has already treated you well by taking you in, yet you still want to leave?”

In the evening, an angry voice sounded from the front.
