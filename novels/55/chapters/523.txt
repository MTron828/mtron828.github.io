Chapter 524: Killing Experts From Dong Hua Sacred Sect (1)

[I hope the Dragon Sect can annihilate more devil sects. In that case, annihilating the entire Diabolism will be an easy task together with the strength of the orthodox sects!]

[Even Dong Hua Sacred Sect wishes to see the Dragon Sect annihilate more devil sects. They probably have high regard for the strength of the Dragon Sect. Let’s hope that the Dragon King can eradicate more devil sects!]

Wang Xian noticed there were more and more threads of this nature after Dong Hua Sacred Sect made its statement.

Besides that, there were threads that cheered on the Dragon Sect and the Dragon King. They proudly boasted about the invincibility of the Dragon King and the Dragon Sect, the Dragon King who saw all evil as his enemies, for whom eliminating Diabolism entirely would be a walk in the park.

There were all kinds of discussions. Subsequently, the devil sects made their statements to warn the Dragon Sect and Dragon King to stay low and that they would be taking revenge for the Remains.

The entire Underworld was exceptionally lively. Looking through these comments, ruthlessness flashed in the eyes of Wang Xian.

It seems like Dong Hua Sacred Sect is truly scheming. They hope to see me annihilate more devil sects? Hehe! I have no feud with the devil sects but I do have one against you!

Wang Xian’s expression turned cold as ice. Looking at the messages popping up on his phone, he stood up and continued refining spiritual equipment.

The effects of this Inborn Spiritual Equipment would be first tested on Dong Hua Sacred Sect!

After working through an entire night, Wang Xian had crafted fifty sets of Devil Shadow Mask and Devil Wings. Seeing the Inborn Spiritual Equipment that was glowing with a dull light, he revealed a satisfied smile.

“Dragon King! These are the pieces of information that Omniscient Group has gathered on Dong Hua Sacred Sect!”

Soon after, Mo Yuan carried a set of information to Wang Xian.

“Can we find an entry point? A few days have passed and it’s time to give Dong Hua Sacred Sect a surprise!”

Wang Xian looked through the information as he asked Mo Yuan.

“Entry point?” Mo Yuan sank into deep thought. Soon, he lifted his head and answered, “Dragon King, we do have an opportunity tomorrow!”

“What kind of opportunity?”

“Nie Wushuang of the Dong Hua Sacred Sect and Emperor Qi of Diabolism have arranged to meet at Huashan for the supreme battle. Eighty percent of the Inborn experts of Dong Hua Sacred Sect will likely attend this major battle. However, there will be some who remain to guard an area. Dong Hua Spiritual Ore Mine!” answered Mo Yuan.

“Dong Hua Spiritual Ore Mine?” Wang Xian raised an eyebrow as he flipped through the information in his hands.

Other than having Nie Wushuang, the reason why Dong Hua Sacred Sect could become the strongest sacred sect in the Underworld was because of the spiritual ore mine.

A spiritual ore mine that one could excavate spiritual stones.

Based on the information on record, Dong Hua Sacred Sect could excavate forty to fifty thousand spiritual stones from the spiritual ore mine annually.

Forty to fifty thousand spiritual stones was an insane amount.

Because of the existence of the spiritual ore mine, the number of Inborn experts in Dong Hua Sacred Sect easily triumphed in the Underworld.

“Dong Hua Spiritual Ore Mine is just fifty kilometers away from the sacred grounds of Dong Hua Sacred Sect. If we ambush them tomorrow, we can easily kill all the experts that remain to guard to spiritual ore mine!” Mo Yuan answered confidently.

“Fifty kilometers...?”

Wang Xian raised an eyebrow.

“Yeah! Fifty kilometers. A Dan Realm expert will be leading the guards with at least a dozen-odd Inborn experts. It’s an incredibly important location for Dong Hua Sacred Sect!”

Mo Yuan nodded his head.

“In that case, we don’t have to wait to attack them until they are away. The people in the Underworld would believe that we are afraid of Dong Hua Sacred Sect. Since we are going to attack, we shall do it tonight!”

A beam of ruthlessness gleamed in Wang Xian eyes as he spoke.

“Tonight?”

Mo Yuan pondered for a moment before asking, “Dragon King, would you want to go with us?”

“Naturally. Nie Wushuang from Dong Hua Sacred Sect will likely have reached the Budding Realm. If he is there, you guys wouldn’t be a match!”

Wang Xian nodded his head before continuing. “Inform all disciples of the Dragon Sect to head towards Dong Hua Spiritual Ore Mine. The battle has begun!”

The battle has begun!

Wang Xian didn’t have the intention to target with Dong Hua Sacred Sect so quickly. However, he wanted to give Dong Hua Sacred Sect a lesson after seeing their statements on the Underworld.

Otherwise, Dong Hua Sacred Sect would assume that his Dragon Sect was just a joke.

Since they had decided to not rest till a side had perished, so be it!

Wang Xian smirked coldly. “Distribute these Devil Shadow Masks and Devil Wings to all the dragonians and test out the strength!”

“Yes, Dragon King!”

Mo Yuan nodded his head. Soon, the disciples of the Dragon Sect arrived one after another.

“Let’s go!”

The group of dragonians kept the Devil Shadow Masks and Devil Wings as they followed behind Wang Xian towards Dong Hua Sacred Sect.

They didn’t take any form of transportation vehicles.

Dragon Sect was currently in an opposing stand to Dong Hua Sacred Sect. There was no way Dong Hua Sacred Sect would not guard against the Dragon Sect.

Moreover, Dong Hua Sacred Sect definitely had its own intelligence channels.

If he had headed towards Dong Hua Sacred Sect with so many people, they would definitely be alerted.

As such, Wang Xian and the group of dragonians chose to fly there directly.

In a deserted area, a group of people were in black clothes and wore black hideous looking masks.

Behind them, they had pairs of wings that spanned over three meters.

The group of fifty-odd people flew rapidly across the sky.

They were just like a flash of shadows as they moved ahead at a tremendous speed.

“Inborn-level wings can fully enable an Inborn expert to fly rapidly across the sky. In fact, they are even faster than airplanes!” Wang Xian mumbled as he looked ahead of him. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

At this very moment, the higher management of Dong Hua Sacred Sect was gathered in a hall in Dong Hua Sacred Sect.

No one was in the Master’s seat.

Nie Wuya and several other Dan Realm experts were seated closer to the front.

Other than the three Dan Realm experts that had shown themselves during the alliance of the orthodox sects, there were two other old men by their side with faint auras emitting from them.

“Tomorrow will be the major battle between our sect leader and Emperor Qi. At that time, Old Xiang will guard the sect while Old Zhou will guard the spiritual ore mine. As for the rest, we will follow the sect leader!”

Nie Wuya instructed the other old men around him.

“I really want to witness the battle of the ages of the Underworld and see how insanely strong our sect leader is currently!” an old man commented.

“Old Zhou, we can’t leave the spiritual ore mine unguarded!” Nie Wuya said to the old man with a smile.

“It doesn’t matter if it is guarded or not. Who dares to have ulterior motives on Dong Hua Sacred Sect?”

The old man snorted confidently while clearly looking displeased.

Hehe!

Nie Wuya chuckled. “That Dragon King from the Dragon Sect has the guts to stand against us! How brazen!”

“The Dragon King of the Dragon Sect is indeed arrogant and fearless. After offending us, they went to annihilate the Remains. Even the devil sects are looking to kill the Dragon King to take revenge for the Remains!”

“That Dragon King is indeed strong but we will definitely be able to kill him if we fight him together!”

“Of course, it wouldn’t be a problem if the five of us work together. Although the Dragon King is arrogant, he isn’t weak at all. Nonetheless, he will likely not live long after offending us and the devil sects. He will either be killed by us or by the devil sects!”

Nie Wuya chuckled. “We still can’t drop our guard right now. If the Dragon King were to ambush us when we leave, it would be problematic!”

“Hehe! We have an ancient defensive spirit array over the spiritual ore mine that can even trap any Dan Realm experts. If he’s here, we will just trap him here!”

The old man who was addressed as Old Zhou smirked and continued, “A Dragon King isn’t a cause for concern yet. If he dares to come, I’ll turn him into a trapped beast!”

“He’s indeed not a cause of concern. However, the devil sects are running amok. If it were peacetime, the Dragon Sect would have been annihilated. There’s no way he could be arrogant like now. Tsk!”

Nie Wuya snorted and killing intent flashed in his eyes.

“Haha. Leave the spiritual ore mine to me and don’t worry about it. I’ll just kill anyone who comes!” Old Zhou said while brimming with killing intent.
