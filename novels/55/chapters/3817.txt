3818 3817 was the ruler of a Level Seven Astral Beast!

Boom! Boom! Boom

A terrifying astral beast that looked exactly the same emerged from the ruler of a level six astral beast and attacked Wang Xian.

This strange attack gave Wang Xian a slight shock.

However, from Wang Xian’s point of view, his strength was only slightly stronger.

The size of the astral beast was hundreds of times larger than Wang Xian when he was in his divine dragon form. The gigantic astral beast emitted a blood-red glow and charged towards Wang Xian.

Boom

An extremely dull sound rang out. Wang Xian’s eyes focused as a sinister look appeared in his eyes.

Bang

A loud collision sound rang out. Wang Xian could feel that the blood-red energy was starting to explode.

Waves of corrosive energy charged towards his body.

Roar! Roar! Roar

However, in the next second, the space beast let out an intense scream.

His attacks were still unable to break through Wang Xian’s defense.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

Wang Xian fanned his dragon tail, which was covered with the power of the Taiji Dragon Disc. He swept it out forcefully.

“Boom!”

A wave of light and dark energy surged, causing the dragon tail to enter the interior of the Space Beast’s body. Black and red blood flowed continuously.

“Roar!”

Wang Xian extended his dragon claw. The powers of light and darkness gathered and clawed at the Space Beast’s body.

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

A large amount of flesh and blood was torn off.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

A miserable cry came from the Space Beast’s mouth.

There was a hint of fear in its blood-red eyes.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

It roared loudly and looked at the other six space beasts. It let out a cry for help.

“Roar! Roar!”

“Roar! Roar!”

The other six space beasts, who were at level six, responded with a hint of fear in their eyes.

They could already sense that the other party’s strength was not something they could fight against.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

One by one, the Space Beasts roared. Their bodies began to retreat.

“Don’t let them escape!”

Wang Xian shouted in a low voice. He swayed his dragon body and continued to attack the space beast.

Dragon Claws, Dragon Tail!

As they were all relying on the Tai Chi Dragon Plate, their attacks were very primitive.

Even so, with the tai chi dragon plate, each attack could leave a large number of wounds on its body.

“Roar!”

The Space Beast let out a low roar. Streams of energy wrapped around its entire body and blocked Wang Xian’s attacks.

Now, it didn’t attack at all. It only defended.

The other six space beasts did the same. They retreated rapidly into the depths.

“Qingyue, kill one of them first!”

Wang Xian let out a low roar and said to Lan Qingyue.

“Alright!”

Lan Qingyue responded immediately. She waved her arm and a gray spear appeared above her head instantly!

With a wave of her arm, the Gray Spear attacked the space beast in front of Wang Xian.

“Woo Woo!”

“Woo Woo!”

Xiao Lan and Xiao House also growled. The gray ocean that was scattered around them started to revolve around the terrifying gray spear.

It was as if the entire ocean was carrying a spear as it attacked the space beast.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The space beast sensed the threat of death and couldn’t help but let out a wild roar.

The other six space beasts in front of him looked over and let out a low roar.

They wanted to save him, but it was already too late!

The terrifying attack landed on the Space Beast’s body.

The gray destruction spear penetrated his body directly. The terrifying gray ocean engulfed him directly.

Under the attacks of LAN Qingyue and the others, this space beast was instantly killed.

When Wang Xian saw this, his face revealed a look of shock.

This was the ancient god Feeding Kun master.

This was the strength of the ancient god Feeding Kun master.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The other six space beasts who were at level six of the ruler realm saw it. Their blood-red eyes were filled with fury and killing intent.

They swayed their huge bodies and flew into the space rapidly.

Wang Xian and the rest immediately chased after them from behind!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The six level six space beasts roared into the space. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Soon, they entered a special territory.

It was a very strange territory. There seemed to be a continent in front of them, but it was not a continent.

If one wanted to describe it, it could be described as a flesh and blood continent.

There was a black and red substance that looked like meat on it.

When this substance was connected, it was the size of more than ten universe planets.

The range wasn’t very big, but it wasn’t small either!

The special substance gave off a powerful energy. It had the power of Life and darkness.

The combination of life and darkness was very strange.

On this strange substance, there were some plants. These plants contained boundless energy!

The plants were very strange, like strange meatballs, black and red.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The six ruler level 6 space beasts flew over, letting out roars in unison!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

Immediately, the ruler level 6 and below space beasts responded, letting out over a hundred roars.

Soon after, one space beast after another could be seen flying towards them.

The six void beasts opened their mouths.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

One void beast after another entered their mouths as if they were merging into their bodies.

Their auras grew stronger and stronger.

Soon, over a hundred void beasts merged into their bodies.

Roar! Roar! Roar

In the next moment, a void beast at the sixth stage of the sovereign realm in the center raised its head and roared.

The two astral beasts on both sides immediately surged into its body.

“What Kind of Astral Beast is this? It can actually fuse?”

When Wang Xian and the rest who were flying over saw this scene, their expressions changed slightly. They were filled with shock.

“Stop them!”

He immediately let out a soft shout.

“Woo Woo Woo Woo!”

Xiao Zhai, Xiao Bai, and the rest immediately let out a roar. They opened their mouths and spat out grayish energy that condensed into two long spears.

Lan Qingyue waved her arm, and two gray chains appeared on her left and right hands.

The chains instantly wrapped around the two spears and quickly spread forward.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The space behemoth that was fusing sensed it and quickly flew forward.

As they flew, they fused together.

And as they fused, their speed increased greatly.

“Roar! Roar!”

Soon, the five sixth-stage sovereign realm space beasts completely entered the body of the Space Beast in the center.

Its aura became extremely terrifying.

However, it didn’t stop. Instead, it opened its mouth and began to devour the flesh and blood in front of it.

As the flesh and blood entered its stomach, its aura instantly became even more terrifying!

Its body size, also instantaneously doubled!
