Chapter 1023: 1024 then, he would kill

Translator: 5496903

“My son was killed by you, and so were the experts sent by you. I really didn’t expect that. However, very soon, I will make your life a living hell!”

A group of people came up to Wang Xian and said these cold words directly.

Wang Xian looked at the group of people and his gaze landed on the center of the group. His pupils contracted slightly. He was an extraordinary level nine and was definitely a top-notch expert.

“Someone from the Yun Family?”

Wang Xian’s face was gloomy. He looked at the middle-aged man and asked with a twinkle in his eyes.

“It’s good that you know who killed you!”

The middle-aged man said coldly. He took a deep look at Wang Xian and walked straight ahead.

Wang Xian’s face darkened.

“How Annoying!”

Wang Xian was in a bad mood after encountering the incident with Feng Xian and the threat from the Yun family.

What should he do if he was in a bad mood?

Wang Xian walked towards his residence.

“Dragon King!”

The group of DRAKONIDS had already returned. When they saw Wang Xian enter with a bad expression, they greeted him carefully.

“Have you arranged the spies?”

Wang Xian asked the group of DRAKONIDS.

“Dragon King, the spies have been arranged!”

The group of DRAKONIDS replied.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded. Since the spies had been arranged, he could make his move.

So what if he was in a bad mood? He could only kill!

“Ao Yao, how confident are you in assassinating that middle-aged man just now?”

Wang Xian asked Ao Yao.

“Seventy percent. He should be a bloodline cultivator. He has already cultivated a bloodline to its peak!”

Ao Yao’s voice sounded from behind.

Wang Xian nodded his head. The Yun family possessed a bloodline. The reason why the current head of the Yun family was able to cultivate to extraordinary level nine was because of his bloodline.

In fact, the middle-aged man was already over 300 years old this year.

“Is there a 70% chance?”

Wang Xian mumbled, “Go and investigate the Yun family tonight. You will be able to find out everything clearly!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao nodded his head.

He knew that the Dragon King was going to make a move against the Yun family.

As long as they destroyed the Yun family, the dragon assassin organization would instantly become famous throughout the entire eastern sea city.

At this moment, the discussions in the Demon Hunters Academy had gone crazy.

“The new student Wang Xian killed Captain Snake Mark, a group of experts from the Yun family!”

“The new student Wang Xian is devoid of conscience. Not only did he not save his fellow students, he even added insult to injury!”

“Wang Xian deserves to die. Dozens of his fellow students died because of him. Such a person should be cut into pieces!”

“The evil Wang Xian. If it weren’t for him, dozens of students wouldn’t have died!”

Not long ago, one post after another suddenly appeared in the forum of the Demon Hunter College. It instantly attracted everyone’s attention.

Wang Xian killed Snake Mark?

This was a matter that shocked the entire college!

When they opened the post and saw the information inside, they were shocked.

Wang Xian had 11 experts of supernatural seventh level? Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

They even killed four experts of supernatural seventh level from the Yun Family?

A bunch of students from the Demon Hunter College’s mercenary group were killed by him?

This...

Everyone was dumbfounded. What was going on?

However, they soon understood the whole story.

However, it didn’t take long before the people from the Void Beast mercenary group and the amethyst mercenary group recounted everything that happened.

“I see. I didn’t expect so many things to happen to the wind-winged savage fish. I didn’t expect Wang Xian to be so awesome!”

“This Wang Xian is simply too powerful. He actually possesses such terrifying strength!”

“Haha, the group of people who posted just now might be the only ones who managed to escape alive. How unlucky. They thought Wang Xian was an ant, but they didn’t expect him to be a terrifying demonic beast.”

“This Wang Xian killed Yun Hanhai, killed snake mark, and more than a dozen students from the young master’s mercenary group. He offended so many forces at once. I reckon that he won’t be able to live for long!”

“The forces behind him who killed this group of people joined forces, but they are extremely terrifying. I wonder if the forces behind Wang Xian can withstand them!”

“It seems like this Wang Xian isn’t simple. He’s really strong. Luckily, we didn’t provoke him!”

The students of the Demon Hunter College were discussing among themselves.

They never expected that a new student would be able to stir up a storm in the demon Hunter College.

Many elite students of the college had died because of him.

The entire Demon Hunter College was in a heated discussion. Soon, the news of this incident was spread to the snake family.

The snake family was a relatively powerful family in East Sea city.

The only difference was that the snake family started out as a mercenary group.

The snake family was much weaker than the Yun family, but they were not to be underestimated.

The head of the snake family had the strength of a level 8 transcendent, and there were three to four level 8 experts in the family.

“Find all their information and keep an eye on them. They dare to kill the core disciples of our snake family, damn it!”

An angry roar came from the snake family.

The forces of the snake family immediately took action.

“Dragon King, there are people monitoring our surroundings!”

In the evening, when Wang Xian was dealing with the items in his hands, Ao Yao’s voice sounded from the side.

“Hehe, let them monitor us!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly.

“There are a total of three forces!”

Ao Yao added.

“Oh, is that so? Don’t bother about them. Go to the Yun family tonight and take a look!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Night arrived very soon. Wang Xian laid on his bed and rested.

The surrounding ao Yao also disappeared into the night sky.

No one had noticed their figures. No one would know that darkness would descend soon.

“Dragon King, we have checked all the locations of the Yun Family!”

The next morning, Ao Yao’s figure appeared beside Wang Xian as soon as he walked out of the room.

“How is it? How confident are we if we can get rid of the Yun Family?”

Wang Xian asked directly.

“Forty percent. The Yun family has three level eight extraordinaires, seven level seven extraordinaires, and 25 level six extraordinaires. If we were to assassinate them, we might attract the attention of the surroundings. Once we are discovered, we will fail!”

Ao Yao said to Wang Xian.

“So Low?”

Wang Xian frowned slightly. A hint of contemplation appeared on his face. “Go and capture the people who are watching us at the entrance!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao nodded and said to the sky.

In less than a minute, three unconscious people were thrown in front of Wang Xian.

“Soul Catcher!”

His heart skipped a beat, and he immediately cast soul catcher.

“Yun Family!”

“Snake Family!”

“Du family!”

Soon, Wang Xian obtained the family that the three people came from. He pondered for a while.

“First, I’ll take care of the snake family. Then, at night, I’ll spread the congratulatory death token of the dragon spike mercenary group across the entire city!”

“From tonight onwards, I’ll stir up the water in the entire Donghai city. After i destroy the snake family, I’ll take away all the treasures of the Snake Family!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled as he thought of a perfect solution. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly.
