Translator: 5496903

“Trash, you can’t even control your own Beast!”

“Trash is trash. You Can’t even control your own mount. What a disgrace to the six element sect!”

The sudden incident on the street in front of the auction attracted everyone’s attention.

When the five Fang clan youths saw the city guards staring at them coldly, they mocked Xing Tianyi with disdain.

“You guys...”

Xing Tianyi’s face was filled with anger as he coldly swept his gaze across the five of them.

“Get down immediately!”

Feng Lingtian and Liu Qing stared at Xing Tianyi who was riding on the Thunder Leopard and warned him coldly. Their gazes swept across the other young men and similarly shouted, “You guys get down too!”

“City guards, we didn’t bump into anyone. Only trash would be unable to control their mounts properly and bump into people!”

A few youths from the Fang clan sat on top with smiles on their faces as they spoke to Feng Lingtian and the others.

When Xing Tian heard their words, his expression turned slightly malevolent.

“Old Hu, Old Hu, not good, his injuries are very serious!”

“This thunder leopard is a rank 9 transcendent beast. Old Hu’s cultivation is only at rank 8 transcendent. Even if he were to be touched by it, he would be severely injured!”

“Damn it, City Guards, you have to stand up for us brothers. We were walking fine here, but we were directly attacked by his beast!”

At the side, three young men had ugly expressions. They glared at Xing Tian Yi with anger as they growled.

On the ground, the middle-aged man’s vitality was extremely weak. The middle-aged men gave him several pills consecutively, but they were only able to alleviate some of his injuries.

“All of You Shut Up!”

He didn’t dare to say anything about the Fang clan’s taunts, but these trash mercenary group members before him dared to shout at him. They were courting death!

“What? So Arrogant?”

“This fellow is so arrogant. His own vicious beast bumped into someone, and he still dares to be so arrogant!”

“Shh, all of you, keep your voices down. Their group is riding an extraordinary ninth grade vicious beast. and look at the clothes on their bodies. Disciples of the six element sect, don’t look for trouble!”

Some of the surrounding people were a little angry when they saw Xing Tian Yi’s arrogant manner.

However, most of them were watching from the side.

This matter concerned the disciples of the six element sect. This was not something that they could interfere with.

The six element sect was a sect that was even more powerful than many kingdoms.

“The one who will shut up is you. Immediately follow us to the city Lord’s mansion. Otherwise, don’t Blame Our Dragon and Phoenix Empire for being impolite!”

When Feng Lingtian saw how arrogant he was, his expression became a little awkward. was he looking down on them.

“Didn’t we just bump into a piece of trash? Here, get out of our sight immediately. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being impolite!”

Xing Tian glanced at Feng Lingtian with a cold expression. With a move of his arm, drops of liquid that contained terrifying spiritual energy appeared in his hand.

There was a total of five drops, and each drop of the spiritual liquid gave off a white luster that filled a radius of one meter.

With a wave of his arm, he threw it directly at the middle-aged man who was lying on the ground.

“Spiritual liquid, it’s spiritual liquid, the spiritual liquid from the Ladyboy Graveyard!”

“Hiss, five drops of spiritual liquid is equivalent to over a million middle-grade spiritual stones!”

The middle-aged men were stunned as they looked at the five drops of spiritual liquid.

“Hu, we don’t lack this spirit liquid. I...”

“Take it. Otherwise, if you don’t have the spirit liquid, you’ll Lose Your Life!”

A middle-aged man looked at the spirit liquid and stared at Xing Tianyi with a dark expression.

However, before he could finish his words, a young man from the six element sect glanced at him disdainfully and warned him indifferently.

“Take it and get lost. If you’re not satisfied, come to the demi-human graveyard and look for our six element sect!”

A six element sect girl said with a smile.

“Six element sect?”

The middle-aged men’s pupils contracted slightly as they looked at each other. They picked up the five drops of spirit liquid with an embarrassed expression and helped the injured middle-aged man up.

Feng Lingtian and Liu Qing frowned as they looked at the injured middle-aged man. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Scram! We want to participate in the auction held by your country. Why? Do you still want to arrest us?”

Xing Tianyi saw that the city guards were still surrounding them and shouted at them angrily.

“Immediately call the soldiers of the Dragon and Phoenix Army over!”

Feng Lingtian and Liu Qing looked at each other and said to a city guard at the side.

After they finished speaking, they looked at Xing Tianyi and said, “If you violate the rules of our Dragon and Phoenix Empire, you will have to pay the price!”

“We have already settled this matter. What more do you troublesome fellows want?”

Xing Tianyi frowned and stared at the two of them coldly.

“Chase them out immediately!”

At this moment, Wang Xian, who was standing at the side, walked over. He looked at the injured middle-aged man and the five drops of spiritual liquid beside the middle-aged man. His eyes were burning with passion.

He turned to Xing Tianyi and said coldly.

“Brother-in-law!”

“Lord Wang!”

When Feng Lingtian, Liu Qing, and the rest saw Wang Xian, their eyes were filled with respect as they shouted hurriedly.

Wang Xian nodded his head slowly. He looked at the eight people from the six elements sect and the five people from the Fang clan.

“Chase them all out and forbid them from entering the city!”

He said directly.

“What?”

Xing Tianyi and the rest were slightly stunned. Their expressions turned cold instantly. Even the five people from the Fang clan were slightly stunned. Their expressions turned grim slowly.

“Chase us out? Your Dragon and Phoenix Empire Dares to chase us out?”

A young man from the six elements sect stared at Wang Xian coldly.

“Why wouldn’t they dare?”

Wang Xian laughed mockingly.

“Haha, Alright, Alright. We will stand here. I want to see how you will chase us out!”

Just as Wang Xian finished his words, Xing Tian, who was at the side, laughed out loud. His eyes were filled with mockery.

They were disciples of the six elements sect. He was also the Prince of the star-moon kingdom. He wanted to see how a small place like this would dare to chase them out.

Wang Xian shook his head slowly.

“Whoosh!”

At this moment, Wang Xian’s figure moved. With a terrifying speed, he appeared beside Xing Tianyi in an instant.

A terrifying force landed on his body.

Xing Tianyi didn’t expect Wang Xian to attack him directly. His face was filled with shock.

However, at this moment, he had no time to dodge.

“Roar! Roar!”

The Thunder Leopard, who was sitting on his seat, saw Wang Xian attacking his master. His eyes were filled with killing intent.

“Bang!”

However, when Wang Xian’s palm landed on Xing Tianyi’s body, his palm also landed directly on the ground.

“Roar! Roar!”

The terrifying physical strength landed on the Thunder Leopard. This extraordinary level nine ferocious beast let out a blood-curdling scream.

Its head was smashed into pieces.

“The Dragon and Phoenix Empire welcomes any friend to come, but they do not welcome anyone who does not abide by the rules. According to the rules of the Dragon and Phoenix royal city, ferocious beasts will lose control and attack people in the city. They will kill the ferocious beasts and expel their owners!”

Wang Xian’s indifferent voice rang out. Meanwhile, Xing Tianyi’s body landed heavily on the ground. The powerful force caused him to spit out a mouthful of blood!
