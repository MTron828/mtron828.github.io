Chapter 576: Big Business

The group left the shop and Wang Xian shuttered the doors soon after. Suddenly, the shop regained peace and silence.

Looking at the materials in the room, Wang Xian’s eyes beamed with excitement.

Fifteen people have requested to refine Level 5 elixir pills. That’s the equivalent of 45 sets of spiritual medicine. Based on the rate of four elixir pills per set of spiritual medicine, I will get 180 elixir pills. Deducting the 60 elixir pills to fifteen people, I will still get 120 elixir pills!

One person has requested Level 6 elixir pills. I’ll get eight elixir pills!

Level 5 elixir pills could increase my dragon energy by roughly ten thousand points. If I have 120, it would be the equivalent of over a million points of dragon energy!

Level 6 elixir pill give more than a hundred thousand points of dragon energy. Eight pills would be close to a million points of dragon energy!

Together, two million points of dragon energy won’t be a problem. I can even heal my injuries completely!

Wang Xian’s eyes beamed with excitement. He was getting two million points of dragon energy in a single day. If he was lucky, he could raise his level to Level 9 soon!

Wang Xian’s lips curved into a smile as he looked towards the materials for weapons.

A total of thirty-three sets. Among them, there were four sets of Level 11 materials.

In other words, he would be getting 4 Level 11 spiritual weapons and 29 Inborn-level weapons!

“Time to start refining!”

Wang Xian took a deep breath. He was exhilarated as he started refining rapidly.

Wang Xian was incredibly fast and the materials were turning into elixir pills and weapons at a frenzied pace.

As for the additional elixir pills, he consumed them directly to heal his injuries!

After he’d finished refining all the materials into elixir pills or weapons, it was already 4 AM.

With a single thought, his attributes surfaced in his mind.

[Name: Wang Xian]

[Race: Five Elements Divine Dragon (Able to transform into a human)]

[Level: 8]

[Dragon Energy: 21,563,421/100,000,000]

[Superpower: Dominate marine animals (Ability to rule any marine animals that are lower than your own level)]

[Devour any form of marine animals (For extraction of dragon energy)]

[Five Elements Control]

[Art of Cultivation: Divine Dragon Transformation]

[Art of Fire Refining: Refine All Equipment With The Origin Source Flame]

[Art of Water Refining: Refine All Equipment With The Origin Source Water]

[Battle Techniques: Water Clone (Preliminary), Sword Edge (Preliminary), Instant Shift (Preliminary)...]

I’m still missing over seventy million points of dragon energy to level up. Moreover, a new category of battle techniques has appeared!

Looking at his own attributes, Wang Xian pondered them.

He would need to consume more than seven hundred Level 6 elixir pills or over seven thousand Level 5 elixir pills to gather seventy million points of dragon energy. The amount was a little too huge.

However, it would take just a month for him to reach if he was getting more than two million points of dragon energy each day.

Wang Xian revealed a smile as he went to the third floor to rest.

What Wang Xian wasn’t aware of was that less than an hour after the seventy to eighty female disciples of Mt. Xue had returned to Mt. Xue, all the female disciples of Mt. Xue knew about a demon-like master who was unparalleled in refining elixir pills and equipment.

Those female disciples from Mt. Xue were introducing Wang Xian to the rest of the disciples as though they were hardcore fans of Wang Xian.

“A twenty-year-old handsome alchemist master and a blacksmith master at the same time. He’s the most outstanding young man in Yong Chang world!”

“A demon-like master that is unparalleled in refining elixir pills and equipment and the prince charming of all girls!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“The most dazzling genius in Yong Chang City and definitely the youngest unparalleled master!”

They weren’t stingy on the compliments of Wang Xian, making those female disciples who had not gone with them feel curious and regretful.

It was especially so as this master who was unparalleled in refining elixir pills and equipment charged a lot less, regardless of whether it was equipment refining or elixir pill refining.

Moreover, this master would make each piece of spiritual equipment based on your requirements.

This was a deadly attraction for every single cultivator.

Custom made weapons from a blacksmith master? What price would you have to pay if you looked for another blacksmith master?

However, this blacksmith master wasn’t charging for workmanship. He would simply be requesting two sets of materials.

Elixir pills? Other places offered three pills while this master offered four pills.

Never underestimate the value of a single pill. If it was a Level 5 elixir pill, the value would be close to a thousand spiritual stones!

The value of a Level 6 elixir pill would be even more insane.

Some disciples from Mt. Xue started gathering what they had saved up over time to bring to Wang Xian for refining.

On the next day morning, beautiful female disciples walked into the shop shortly after Wang Xian opened it.

“Handsome master, is my spiritual sword done?”

A female disciple walked to Wang Xian passionately, staring at him with her bright and seductive eyes.

“Your name please?”

“Handsome master, I’ve brought two customers for you today!”

The girl smiled radiantly at Wang Xian.

“Thank you!”

Wang Xian looked to the other girls and found them to be stealing glances at him from time to time while conversing softly.

“Qin Zi. You can call me Qin Zi. Handsome master, you have to remember my name!”

“Handsome master, I’m here to collect my item!”

For the entire morning, the stream of people into and out of the small shop didn’t break. Moreover, the girls from Mt. Xue weren’t simply here to collect their elixir pills and spiritual equipment. They also brought him lots of customers.

This made Wang Xian smile for the entire morning.

“Master, master!”

In the evening, when the last female disciple from Mt. Xue had left, several figures entered.

Wang Xian looked up and saw Piao Lingxue and Mu Wanbai.

Other than the two of them, there was an old man and a middle-aged man beside them.

“Ms. Piao! Ms. Mu!”

Wang Xian smiled radiantly when he saw them stepping in.

Without the two of them, his business wouldn’t have been as great.

“I’ve brought you huge business today!”

Mu Wanbai smiled at Wang Xian such that her eyes formed a line. “Shouldn’t you get me something in return?”

Huh?

Wang Xian was taken aback. He turned to the old man and middle-aged men, showed a smile and said, “Sure!”

“What a young master in alchemy and blacksmithing! You are really unparalleled in this world. If I hadn’t heard from Piao Lingxue personally, I wouldn’t have believed it!”

The old man scrutinized Wang Xian from top to bottom as he spoke.

“Tsk! You are my grandpa! And yet you don’t believe what I’ve said!”

When Mu Wanbai heard the old man, she pouted and stared at him.

Haha!

The old man chuckled. The next moment, he took out an item, handed it to Wang Xian and said, “This is our first meeting. Please accept this token as a gift from our Mu Family!”

Huh?

Wang Xian was taken aback. He looked at the box in the old man’s hand but didn’t accept it right away.

“I heard from Ms. Piao Lingxue that you wanted a space ring. Our Mu Family happens to have a few. This is the one with the largest space that we have. It has the capacity of a thousand cubic meters!” the old man said with a smile.

A space ring with a thousand cubic meters!

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up. He looked at the old man and asked, “May I ask what your conditions are?”

“It’s obviously about refining elixir pills and equipment. I hope that for our collaboration, you can give some interest to us!”

The old man was direct as he chuckled.
