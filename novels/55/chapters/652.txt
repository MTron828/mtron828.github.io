Chapter 653: The Dragon King Preaching Dao (1)

Translator: Larbrestudio

Roar roar roar!

The violent roars, the terrifying devilish aura, and the blood-boiling battle.

“This is...?”

Wang Xian was shocked to see the battle in the Dragon Field as he turned to look around him.

Around him, various Dragon Palace members stared intensely at the battle between Roving Heavens and Roving Yaksha on the Dragon Field.

The Yaksha race, Anomalocaris race and Mysterious Demon race were frowning as they watched the battle.

However, the Devil Monkey race was completely different.

All the members of the Devil Monkey race could feel the strong battle desires from their leader. Their eyes were slightly red and their hairs stood up. The terrifying battle will was released without any intention of masking it.

Those with dark attributes favored battle from birth. The more they fought, the more excited they would get.

Fresh blood made their own blood boil.

The more they fought, the braver and stronger they would get.

Wang Xian looked into the field. When the battle started, Roving Heavens was constantly being knocked back by Roving Yaksha’s water energy. However, as the battle went on...

Huge fangs appeared in Roving Heavens’ mouth. His eyes were also starting to turn red.

All his hair stood up and the speed of the metal rod in his hand grew faster and faster with escalating strength.

Gradually, Roving Yaksha could only defend passively.

When it came to defending, Roving Yaksha was indeed better. He was adept in diverting the brunt of the attack as he manipulated water waves to re-direct powerful attacks.

However, passive defending would eventually lead to defeat.

After ten minutes, Roving Yaksha lost.

Roving Heavens didn’t stop there. He continued the challenge and fought more and more bravely. One Venomous Sea Snake charged towards and attacked Roving Heavens.

The Venomous Sea Snake was exceptionally fast. Those who were weaker could only see a green shadow moving across.

When facing the Venomous Sea Snake in battle, Roving Heavens suffered several wounds within a short period of several tens of seconds.

However, when his violent body was completely covered in pitch-black dragon scale armor, the outcome of the battle soon became clear.

“When the Devil Monkeys rage, their blood boils and the divine dragon bloodline in them will be completely triggered!” Wang Xian mumbled to himself.

Looking at the illusory vision of a divine dragon on Roving Heavens, he was completely astounded.

When his bloodline was completely triggered, he could even challenge those that were stronger than him. He was even stronger when compared to the Venomous Sea Snake who possessed the Wind Divine Dragon bloodline!

“Let me give it a try!”

Roving Demon flexed and disappeared from everyone’s vision without a trace. [1]

Roving Heavens observed his surroundings in shock.

Assassination! The true assassination!

Wang Xian was slightly surprised. Even he couldn’t sense where the traceless Roving Demon was. This was indeed frightening.

Roving Heavens was hit several times consecutively and wounds the size of a fist appeared across his chest.

However, when Roving Heavens closed his eyes, Wang Xian realized a unique talent of the Devil Monkey.

Ears. Their ears were shaking constantly.

Bam!

When Roving Demon attacked, Roving Heavens met him directly.

Roving Demon had to show itself when he attacked. When he saw Roving Heavens meet him directly, he was astonished and was knocked back several steps.

“According to the legends, the Dragon has nine sons with different talents. Those powerful descendants are not any weaker than their father. Now that we have inherited the essence blood from the Dragon King, we are unique sons of the dragon. As we cultivate, we will awaken different abilities!”

Beside Wang Xian, Prime Minister Turtle explained, “After Roving Sword broke through to Level 13, it triggered part of his divine dragon bloodline and he obtained the unique talent of Metal Edge Body. As for Roving Heavens, despite not reaching Level 13, he has triggered even more of his bloodline than Roving Sword!”

Wang Xian was enlightened. He looked into the field and said, “The talents of Roving Heavens are indeed a little unique. I wonder what kind of abilities he will be granted!”

Prime Minister Turtle also looked ahead curiously.

Defeat! Defeat!

Roving Heavens challenged Roving Yaksha, Venomous Sea Snake, and Roving Demon consecutively and defeated all of them.

This had completely exceeded Wang Xian’s expectations.

Roving Lobster and Roving Girl had just reached Level 12. It wouldn’t be necessary for them to participate in the battle as they wouldn’t be a match either.

As for the following battle, the strength of the leader of the Anomalocaris race had also exceeded Wang Xian’s expectation.

His fist was fast and furious and carried powerful electric powers. He was just as mighty and powerful as the Thunder God!

“It seems like lady luck is really shining on me. The Devil Monkey race and Anomalocaris race aren’t as weak as I had expected.

Wang Xian was pleasantly surprised. In the Dragon Palace, Roving Heavens was the strongest, followed by the Nine Venomous Sea Snakes. Subsequently, it would be Roving Demon and the Budding Realm experts of the Mysterious Demon race, Roving Yaksha, and the newly advanced Roving Lobster and Roving Girl.

Roving Yaksha being relatively weaker was within Wang Xian’s expectation. His strength lay in group attacks.

The Yakshas’ talents were in teamwork. When working together with their race members, they could launch terrifying attacks that were far beyond what they could do individually.

Following this was the battles between Dragon Palace members below Level 12.

The entire grand contest lasted for two days and Wang Xian stood by the side all along while watching.

They would form the foundation of the Dragon Palace and he had rather high expectations for them!

“Prime Minister Turtle and Roving Heavens, follow me!”

After the grand contest had ended, Wang Xian spoke to them in a solemn voice.

“Yes, Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Turtle and Roving Heavens followed Wang Xian to the Dragon King Hall, feeling a little excited.

“I’ll raise both of your strength to Level 13!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and dense streams of dragon energy flowed into their bodies.

This dragon energy was extracted entirely from the pure blood corals and would be sufficient to raise two people to the Immortal Realm.

Grrrr, grrr!

Huge changes were happening on the bodies of Roving Heavens and Prime Minister Turtle.

Prime Minister Turtle reverted to his initial form. His huge ten-meter body gradually grew to fifteen meters and the pattern on his shell deepened and became clearer.

There were patterns of the sun, moon, and stars, and one would be able to tell that it was extraordinary with a single look.

As for Roving Heavens, he grew two additional ears. This greatly surprised Wang Xian.

“Thank you, Dragon King!”

Terrifying auras emanated from their bodies. They went down on their knees and shouted respectfully.

Roving Heavens, who had reached the Immortal Realm, would be able to grow to roughly two meters. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

He manipulated the seven-meter metal rod in his hands and stuffed it within his ears directly.

Wang Xian was stunned to witness it.

Sun Wukong? [2]

However, there was a difference between Sun Wukong and Roving Heavens. For The Great Sage Equalling Heaven, Sun Wukong, he simply shrank his golden rod. For Roving Heavens, it was because of the powerful ability of his ears!

I might really be able to raise a Devil Monkey capable of destroying worlds in the future! Wang Xian thought to himself and couldn’t help but smile.

“Dragon King, I believe there’s one more thing we should do now!”

At this moment, Prime Minister Turtle wiggled his body. To Wang Xian’s astonishment, Prime Minister Turtle shed his turtle shell, shrank it, and held it in his hand.

He caressed his turtle shell as he spoke to Wang Xian.

“Huh? What’s the matter?”

Wang Xian looked at Prime Minister Turtle.

Wang Xian was completely convinced of Prime Minister Turtle’s intelligence at this moment. Having an old and wise official proposing and executing plans for him was a great thing for him.

“Preaching Dao!” [3]

“Preaching Dao?”

Wang Xian was a little confused.

“That’s right, it’s about preaching Dao. In the legends of China, a Saint preaching Dao could enlighten thousands and thousands and grant intelligence to countless living creatures. All living creatures are capable of cultivation!

“Dragon King, you could preach Dao in the Dragon Palace. The billions of marine creatures within the region of the Dragon Palace could listen in. Through preaching Dao, their intelligence might be manifested. Even if they failed to do so, they would still be able to roughly understand the concept of cultivation!

“Perhaps there will be a day that they undergo a metamorphosis and their chances of leaping through the Dragon Gate will be higher!”
