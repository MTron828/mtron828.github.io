Chapter 433: Gathering Of The Outstanding Heroes (2)

“Xiao Xian, if I pass you a birdcage now, you’ll look like the walking wasted rich young man in the novel!”

After they came out of the hotel, Guan Shuqing teased the way Wang Xian was dressed.

“Really?”

Wang Xian chuckled as he fanned himself.

Bam!

Suddenly, a figure was hurled towards him at this time.

Wang Xian made a quick move and dodged it. He looked over his shoulder and spotted a young man on the floor. The young man held a sword as he spat out a mouthful of blood.

“Haha, what...Prince Jade Sword. Look at you now. Are you fit to be the eighth on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart? Ridiculous!”

Coupled with a scornful voice, a young man stalked over as he checked out the young man on the floor with a slightly lifted chin.

“He’s Bei Wuying, the future successor of Bei Family in Yuan City. He also succeeded the Northern Kick, and advanced to Inborn Realm!”

“I think he just advanced into the Inborn Realm. Guess he will have a placing in the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart!”

“Prince Jade Sword, eighth on the chart, was easily defeated by him.”

“There are so many talents this year. Last time, this successor of the Northern Kick couldn’t even make it on the chart. It’s a surprise to see him with formidable strength.”

Everyone around gasped in astonishment.

It was big news for the eighth ranking on the chart to be easily defeated.

“Ahem, you defeated me with a dozen strokes even after you advanced to Inborn Realm. How dare you be insolent! I’m younger than you by five years old. Within the next years, I’m 100 percent sure that I’m going to advance to Inborn Realm. Till then, no one will know the outcome!” said Prince Jade Sword, who was lying on the floor. Upon hearing Bei Wuying’s mockery, he wiped the blood at the corner of his lips with pride.

“Lad, you’re still not convinced?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Bei Wuying darkened his expression at Prince Jade Sword’s words. He overlooked Prince Jade Sword and asked.

“Hmph, of course not. You only have a few more years of practice than me. Why should I be convinced?”

Unyieldingly, Prince Jade Sword fixed his eyes on Bei Wuying.

“Don’t you know when you’re the weaker one, you should endure the hardship patiently? Otherwise, you’ll die if you act insolently when you can’t outfight others.”

Straightaway, Bei Wuying moved as he lunged at Prince Jade Sword with both legs turning into afterimages.

Prince Jade Sword was aghast as he quickly brought up his sword at his chest.

Bam!

Yet, when the terrifying power swept onto his chest, his face was horrified.

“Since you said I’m weak, I’ll show you the power of Whirling Umbra Kick!”

Killing intent filled the eyes of Bei Wuying as afterimages formed at his legs.

Instantly, they enveloped Prince Jade Sword.

“Bei Wuying is out to kill!”

“Oh no, that Prince Jade Sword is going to be killed!”

“That Prince Jade Sword did not want to concede defeat either. He didn’t want to admit that he lost. If you’re not a match of others, you should have just admitted it. Now, he’s finished.”

Bam, Bam, Bam!

Coupled with the whispers in the surroundings, a loud banging sound was heard.

“Ah... if you kill me, my family will not let you off!”

“Hmph, do you think your family is a Sacred Clan? Would the Bei Family be afraid of you?”

With a frosty face, Bei Wuying did not stop his kick.

Prince Jade Sword groaned without stopping as his eyes were filled with trepidation.

“Go to hell!”

At this time, Bei Wuying gave a low bellow as the afterimages of his legs quickly merged into one. The dark shadow of a kick swept towards Prince Jade Sword.

“No!”

A cry of panic came from his mouth as Prince Jade Sword’s body was thrown far away.

In the air, everyone could see his deformed body.

“Courting your own doom!”

There was a murderous aura surrounding Bei Wuying as he swept his cold gaze at Prince Jade Sword’s body.

“Sss... he’s dead. The number eight on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart was killed by someone who has no ranking.”

“He’s far too strong by gathering all the virtual images for an attack.”

“Could Bei Wuying be the dark horse of the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart?”

Everyone looked at him with awe.

His strength was so mighty that he could kill the talent ranked eighth on the chart easily.

“Hmph!”

When Bei Wuying noticed the crowd was discussing him in low voices, he exhibited a haughty look.

“We have many talents this year. How dare a Half-step to Inborn Expert play punk. Really asking for his own death!”

As he spoke, he inserted his hands into his pockets as he stalked by the side with a proud look.

“Get lost!”

Hundreds of people gathered around him, and the way to the hotel was blocked.

“You’re the one in our way!”

As Bei Wuying was heading their way, Guan Shuqing was displeased upon hearing his reprimand.

“Hur?”

Bei Wuying raised his eyebrow when he heard Guan Shuqing. He looked over with a pair of ghastly eyes.

He looked around and eventually stopped in Guan Shuqing’s direction. “Let me tell you this. There’s only one way in this Underworld – the victory road. Losers have no way out!”

“Get lost now!” hee shouted again.

Several young men who walked out of the hotel quickly stepped aside as they dared not refute.

Just like Bei Wuying had said, speak with fists.

“That’s right.”

Upon hearing Bei Wuying’s comment, Wang Xian nodded his head in agreement. There’s only one way in this Underworld – the victory road.

“In that case, you can get lost!” said Wang Xian dryly, picking up his Golden Ivory Fan and pointing at Bei Wuying.

“Hur?”

Seeing Wang Xian standing before him, pointing at him with the fan in his hand, there was only coldness in Bei Wuying’s eyes.

“Asking me to get lost? Looks like I have to do my killing spree today. More and more people have a death wish!”

“Heh heh.” Wang Xian chuckled at his words. He peered at the corpse at the side, “What he said was right. Your strength is just so-so. How dare you put on airs when you just became an Inborn?”

“Hur?”

“Who is this young man? He’s so young. I’ve never seen him before?”

“Not sure which family or Sacred Sect he’s from. But since he dares to provoke Bei Wuying, he must be an Inborn-level expert.”

“This is going up against Bei Wuying. What qualification does this young man have?”

“Perhaps he’s just some rich man’s son. He’s even holding a folding fan. How coquettish!”

To their astonishment, the surrounding people began to comment about Wang Xian when they saw Wang Xian holding the Golden Ivory Fan.

“Since you said my strength is so-so, come and have a taste of it!”

Rage surged in Bei Wuying’s eyes. He had been taunted by ignorant fellows time and time again. It looked like he had yet to establish his reputation.

“I must kill more people to establish the reputation of Bei Wuying so that everyone can respect me!”

Bei Wuying grinned as he revealed a creepy look.
