3820 3819 cursed dragon killed a Level 7 space beast! Descend

“This is? Cursed Dragon!”

Lan Qingyue’s eyes sparkled when she saw the tens of thousands of cursed dragons being brought over by an lie.

Cursed Dragon!

The most unique dragon species in the Dragon Palace.

This was a type of dragon species that could commit suicide.

When they appeared, they would commit suicide.

Fortunately, after they committed suicide, they could resurrect with the tree branches of the soul returning tree!

The Dragon Palace of the curse rarely used them. In fact, they didn’t even use them during the war.

This was because all the great beings in the 9-origin universe knew about the existence of the cursed creatures.

In addition, the power of the dragon of the curse was very weak.

Now that the dragon of the curse had reached the pinnacle of the venerable realm, it had basically reached its limit.

They had no chance of breaking through!

This was also the reason why the Dragon Palace didn’t have many cursed dragons at the moment.

There were a total of 50,000 of them.

50,000 of them was considered the least among the eight million in the Dragon Palace!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

At this moment, a roar came from the back. Following that, waves of terrifying energy attacked Wang Xian and the rest!

“1,000 disciples of the Cursed Dragon, go up and meet them!”

Wang Xian’s expression changed drastically when he saw this terrifying attack!

He immediately ordered the group of Cursed Dragons!

The cursed dragons also understood their usage. Without any hesitation, they moved their bodies and immediately went up to meet the terrifying attack!

1,000 cursed dragons immediately went up to meet the energy!

Lan Qingyue and the great mill of the five elements immediately released their strongest defenses.

As for the Tai Chi Dragon Disc, it had completely collapsed. It would take a very long time to repair it.

This time would probably take thousands of years, or even tens of thousands of years!

After all, the Tai Chi Dragon Disc, which was now the ruler of a level nine realm, would not recover so easily after collapsing!

Fortunately, the Tai Chi Dragon Plate was mainly formed from the Dragon Soul and the heart of Light and darkness.

As long as the Dragon Soul was still around, as long as the heart of Light and darkness was still around, it could slowly recover.

As for Wang Xian, he had yet to encounter such an energy to destroy the dragon soul.

“Roar!”

“Roar!”

A Thousand Cursed Dragons roared. Faced with the energy that could destroy them, they did not panic at all. In fact, they were not afraid at all!

Although the cursed dragons had to pay with their lives since they were born.

However, they didn’t need to cultivate like the other dragons in the Dragon Palace. They needed to improve. They were still very relaxed in the Dragon Palace.

Furthermore, they could be revived.

There was a saying that one would gain a lot of things while losing something.

There were pros and cons. Becoming a cursed dragon was the choice of many members in the Dragon Palace.

This was the first time Wang Xian had used a cursed dragon!

Before the 1,000 cursed dragons could reach the front, the terrifying energy fluctuations caused them to collapse instantly.

Instant Death!

After all, the gap was still too big!

However, at the moment of their death, a strange energy and a strange killing curse surged towards the space beast that was at level seven!

This attack was strange and terrifying!

They couldn’t defend or Dodge, they could only take it head on!

“WUUUUU!”

However, this attack from the Level 7 ruler-level astral beast still quickly caused the five elements grinding attack to collapse and land on the small house’s body.

When the energy landed on his body, more than half of his body was quickly wiped out.

This was even under the circumstances where he had the full support of Lan Qingyue and Xiao Bai.

Faced with the attack of this furious Space Beast, the little house could only withstand two to three attacks at most!

This was even under the situation where he had the support of the five elements grindstone!

After blocking the attack, Wang Xian fixed his gaze on the situation of the Space Beast.

In addition, another 1,000 cursed dragons flew out, ready to launch a suicidal attack!

With 1,000 cursed dragons, Wang Xian didn’t have much confidence in killing a level seven space beast.

After all, this wasn’t an ordinary ruler.

Instead, it was a level seven ruler.

Furthermore, it was a space beast with extremely tenacious vitality!

“Attack!”

Wang Xian saw that the space beast only let out an intense scream and immediately ordered the other 1,000 cursed dragons.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The 1,000 cursed dragons did not hesitate at all. They charged forward like moths to a flame!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

When the Space Beast, who was in pain, saw another 1,000 ants charging at it, its body only trembled.

A wave of dark red energy swept out!

The 1,000 cursed dragons died instantly!

“Roar! Roar!”

After the 1,000 cursed dragons died, an increasingly desperate voice came out from the mouth of this space beast.

The voice that shook the heavens and earth spread throughout the entire space!

His life force was disappearing at a terrifying speed!

“It seems to have succeeded!”

Lan qingyue stared at it closely as she sensed the life force of this space beast. Her eyes sparkled!

“Indeed.”

Wang Xian watched as the life force of the Space Beast, which was the overlord of the level seven realm, rapidly disappeared under the backlash of the 2,000 cursed dragons.

2,000 cursed dragons could destroy a space beast that was the overlord of the universe at the level seven realm. This was worth it for Wang Xian.

Of course, Wang Xian couldn’t do such things frequently.

This was because it would take a long time for the cursed dragons to be resurrected.

There was a limit to the number of cursed dragons in the Dragon Palace!

After resurrecting, they would need a lot of resources to advance to the peak of the supremacy realm!

“They are completely dead.”

Wang Xian stared at the Cosmic Beast and smiled when he saw its complete death.

“Let’s Go!”

Next, it was time to reap the rewards!

Wang Xian didn’t really care about the corpse of a level seven master of the universe.

What he cared about was the value of the territory in front of him.

This land of treasures was very strange. That incomparably huge material was also very strange!

The entire space territory was very strange.

Furthermore, according to what Wang Xian knew, the space beasts in the universe were born from planets.

Of course, it was not just the birth of planets. It could also be the birth of space beasts from other treasures!

Wang Xian suspected that the space beasts here were born from this domain.

This was because the energy fluctuations in this domain were too similar to those space beasts!

Swoosh

Wang Xian and the rest flew over and took a look at the corpse. With a move of his palm, he took out the soul-returning wood branch.

“An lie, bring them back. There are also some corpses of the space beasts here. Bring them back as well!”

Wang Xian instructed an lie.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

An lie nodded.

“Let’s go, qingyue. Let’s see what treasures are hidden here!”

Wang Xian flew forward in a good mood.

It could be said that the value of this place was definitely far beyond the treasures occupied by other peak races.
