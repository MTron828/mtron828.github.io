Chapter 1242: Battle of the 1243 elites

Translator: 5496903

“Ling Jian ‘er, you are too arrogant. With just us? With just me alone, I can easily cripple you!”

Han Mingshan’s expression turned cold, and a trace of killing intent flashed in his eyes.

“You killed more than ten elite disciples of our Hanhai dynasty. Ling Jian ‘er, today, I will make you pay the price!”

Han Mingqing held a long sword in his hand and pointed it at her.

“Hehe, are you all coming together, or one by one!”

Ling Jian ‘er moved her hand, and a long metal sword appeared in her hand, staring coldly at them.

“What happened?”

“It’s Ling Jian ‘er and the people of the Hanhai Dynasty!”

“That’s Han Ming Qing, and that should be the black horse Han Ming Shan who suddenly appeared just now. In just a few short hours, he directly entered the prodigy roll and defeated seven prodigies in one go. He’s now ranked 14th on the prodigy roll. If that nameless prodigy isn’t here, his ranking might continue to rise!”

“I’ve watched Han Ming Shan’s battle. He’s a prince of the Hanhai dynasty, and his strength is extremely terrifying. All of his opponents were defeated within five moves!”

“That Han Ming Shan’s strength should be even stronger than Han Ming Qing’s!”

“A few days ago, Ling Jian ‘er killed over a dozen people from the Hanhai dynasty. Now, it looks like the Hanhai dynasty is coming for revenge!”

“Ling Jian ‘er killed Han Ming Wen, who was once ranked 17th on the prodigy roll. Han Ming Wen is the son of a prince of the Hanhai dynasty. The Hanhai dynasty will definitely not let this go!”

“Two princes want to deal with Ling Jian ‘ER. This time, Ling Jian ‘ER is in trouble. Although I don’t dare to kill her, I will definitely humiliate her!”

Around them, some people looked over in surprise when they saw Ling Jian ‘er and the people from the Han Hai dynasty gathered.

Be It Ling Jian ‘er, Han Ming Qing, or Han Ming Shan, they were all the prodigies that everyone was looking at.

Especially Ling Jian ‘ER. She was a woman and ranked fourth on the Heaven’s favorites list. She was extremely powerful.

Although Han Ming Shan had just appeared on the heaven’s favorites stage, he had already become the third dark horse after Mu Yuan and nameless. He had defeated Seven Heaven’s favorites within a few hours!

“Let me test your strength first. HMPH, a ruthless woman who killed her own mother and killed her own brother and second mother. Just how powerful is she? !”

Han Ming Qing’s eyes were filled with coldness. “You killed my cousin. Today, I will strip you of all your clothes!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Shut up and Die!”

When Ling Jian ‘er heard Han Ming Qing’s words, a strong killing intent appeared in her eyes. The golden longsword in her hand directly attacked Han Qing Ming.

The bone-piercing cold light could be clearly felt by everyone within a few hundred meters.

Her mother had been killed, and she had killed her younger brother and second mother to take revenge. This was a taboo for her, and it would forever scar her heart.

No one was allowed to offend her, much less throw salt on it. Otherwise, she would definitely kill the other party.

A few days ago, a woman from the boundless sea dynasty had taunted and provoked her, and she had killed more than a dozen people.

“Haha, good, Let’s fight. I want to see what a witch who was chased out of the sect by her father is capable of!”

Han qingming felt the bone-piercing sharpness, and his expression changed, but he still taunted.

People who lost their reason were easier to deal with.

They Knew Ling Jian ‘ER’s weakness, and they also knew that this matter would make Ling Jian ‘er lose her reason.

Ling Jian ‘ER’s arms trembled from the attack, and her eyes were slightly moist and bloodshot.

“Peng, Peng, Peng!”

Facing Ling Jian ‘ER, Han Qingming did not dare to be the slightest bit careless. One water sword after another directly covered Ling Jian ‘er.

An intense collision sound rang out. Han Qingming directly moved forward, and one after another, powerful water energy attacked Ling Jian ‘ER.

He was ranked seventh on the prodigy roll, and his strength was at the peak of the half-step void interpretation realm.

Even if Ling Jian ‘er was very strong, it wouldn’t be that easy to defeat him.

The battle between the prodigies caused the surrounding people to hurriedly retreat.

“Haha, Vicious and Merciless Witch, today we will teach you a good lesson on behalf of your father!”

Han Qingming saw that Ling Jian ‘ER’s attacks were a little messy and laughed out loud as he mocked her once again.

His voice spread out for a few kilometers and was basically heard by everyone around the Heaven’s pride stage.

He called her a witch one after another and each of them was ruthless.

“This Ling Jian ‘ER is really unlucky. She fell out with her father, and her mother was killed. She even killed her talented younger brother!”

“The people from the Hanhai dynasty are obviously trying to bully Ling Jian ‘ER in public and make him collapse!”

“The people from the Heavenly Sword sect are there, but they won’t help. That Ling Jian ‘er is going to be unlucky today!”

The surrounding people looked at the two people fighting in the arena, then looked at the other prince behind them and said in a low voice.

Not far away from them, a group of youths wearing the heavenly sword sect’s uniform looked at the arena coldly, without the slightest reaction.

“Go to hell!”

When Ling Jian ‘er heard his words, she took a deep breath. Her eyes were bloodshot.

A golden light flashed across her chest. The golden light was extremely bright as it entered the sword in her hand.

“Haha, you still can’t kill me!”

Han Ming Qing laughed out loud. A look of confidence flashed across his eyes.

He knew that he was not Ling Jian ‘ER’s match. However, it was very, very difficult for Ling Jian ‘er to kill him.

He had a level 2 profound void martial stage armor, and the long sword in Ling Jian ‘ER’s hand was also a level 2 profound void martial stage. As long as he escaped, he would definitely not be able to kill him.

He came to challenge him, and then asked his elder brother to make a move. Otherwise, if they joined forces to attack, it would make people think that their Hanhai Empire was so weak that they needed to join forces to bully a Woman!

Seeing a golden ray of light attacking towards him, he held the long sword in both hands and lightly shook it.

“Boundless Sea Sword Defense!”

He shouted and the corners of his mouth curled up. He used a sword technique divine ability to meet the ray of Golden Light.

“Pu!”

However, the next moment, he was stunned.

The Ray of golden light easily pierced through his divine ability defense.

This ray of sword light seemed to be able to pierce through everything as it attacked him.

“Break for me!”

Han Ming Qing’s expression changed slightly. He raised the long sword in his hand and met the golden light directly.

When the long sword in his hand landed on the golden light, his expression changed drastically. The arm that was holding the long sword started to bleed.

A terrifying sharp light flowed through his arm and entered his body, causing his entire body to feel extremely uncomfortable.

He felt as if his body was about to collapse.

“What attack is this? How can it be so terrifying?”

His expression changed drastically, and his eyes were filled with fear.

“Resplendent, origin of gold!”

A cold voice continued to sound out, causing Han Ming Qing’s eyes to be filled with shock.

“Fifth brother, save me!”

Feeling the even more terrifying golden light attack, Han Ming Qing’s face was filled with shock as he cried out in fear.

His body was in extreme pain, and his body was stiff. There was no way for him to escape.

“Huh? What?”

Behind him, the people of the Hanhai dynasty were watching the battle between Han Ming Qing and Ling Jian ‘er.

When Han Ming Qing suddenly asked for help, they were slightly stunned.

Han Ming Shan looked over and immediately noticed Han Ming Qing’s strange expression. His expression changed drastically.

“Ling Jian ‘ER, stop. If you dare to hurt my seventh brother, no one will be able to save you today!”

He moved and shouted at Ling Jian ‘ER.

“PFFT PFFT PFFT PFFT!”

Just as he finished his sentence, the Golden Origin’s attack landed on Han Ming Qing.

There was no obstruction. In an instant, Han Ming Qing was pierced through.

His life force disappeared in an instant!

Seeing this scene, everyone was stunned.
