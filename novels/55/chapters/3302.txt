“Not good!”

“What is this dragon king trying to do!”

More than a dozen experts from the heaven opening primal continent saw Wang Xian appearing beside them instantly. Their pupils constricted slightly and their faces revealed a horrified expression.

They felt a death threat enveloping them. Without any hesitation, some of them fled directly while others wanted to return to their Cosmos God country instantly.

“A bunch of people who are seeking death. My Dragon Palace has said that whoever dares to covet our Dragon Palace’s spoils of war will die!”

Wang Xian stared at them coldly. His eyes were filled with coldness.

His arm turned into a dragon claw and enveloped all of them instantly.

At the next moment, death enveloped more than ten of them.

“No, no, no!”

“Dragon King, don’t!”

The expressions of the dozen of them changed drastically. With Wang Xian’s terrifying speed, they didn’t even have the chance to escape.

Their eyes were blood-red as they roared indignantly.

“Bang!”

However, in the next moment, the extinguished energy landed on their bodies, causing their vitality to be quickly extinguished.

Buzz

However, one of the middle-aged men emitted an earthen-yellow glow. The earthen-yellow glow disappeared in a flash, leaving behind a corpse.

Around him, more than a dozen people were killed by the demon in an instant.

Even a universe knight with level seven combat strength could not withstand one move from Wang Xian.

“HMPH!”

Wang Xian snorted coldly. His face was filled with cold killing intent.

“Go Back!”

He said to Tian Chen an lie and his figure disappeared.

“Huff Huff!”

“D * mn it, D * MN Dragon King. They are not a match for the liches. If they don’t dare to do anything to the liches, they will kill us. Those who bully the weak are afraid of the strong. Your Dragon Palace deserves to die!”

When Wang Xian had just returned to the Dragon Palace, at the same time, he was in a swamp at the edge of the heaven-splitting primordial land.

There were many khaki palaces on the khaki swamp. These palaces were not stationary. Some of them were slowly entering the swamp.

In one of the palaces, a lifeless clay figurine slowly showed its life force. He opened his eyes, his face filled with endless anger, and his body was trembling.

He was someone who had already died once. Even if he had been resurrected, the price of resurrection was too great.

Moreover, the dozen or so companions with him were all killed by the Dragon King!

How did they offend the Dragon King?

It was because the dragon king saw that they were easy to bully.

“Dragon King!”

He roared furiously with a face full of unwillingness, and his body trembled violently.

But he knew that he wasn’t a match for the Dragon King!

Their race wasn’t a match for the Dragon Palace either.

The mud man’s body trembled violently. A few minutes later, he took out the universe AI and immediately posted a message on it.

Even if he could not take revenge, he had to disgust the Dragon King!

“Dragon King, what about the Righteous God Race?”

In the Dragon Palace, when Prime Minister Gui saw Wang Xian and the rest coming back and saw that the Dragon King’s expression was not good, he frowned slightly and walked over to ask softly.

“They have been occupied by the people of the Lich Kingdom. They have eleven level 8 universe knights there. Prime Minister Gui, collect some information about the lich kingdom from the universal AI.”

Wang Xian instructed him with a solemn face.

He moved and sat on the Dragon Chair. His anger slowly calmed down.

Since the Lich Kingdom’s powerhouse, the Lich King, wanted to make an enemy of the Dragon Palace and accompany the Dragon Palace King, Wang Xian would play with them.

The strongest powerhouse in the entire Lich Kingdom was only a universe knight level 8. Therefore, Wang Xian and the Dragon Palace had this trump card to play with them.

He wanted the Lich Kingdom to spit out all the things they had obtained.

He wanted them to pay a heavy price.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister GUI’s expression changed slightly and he nodded immediately.

Prime Minister Gui could naturally imagine how huge the divine kingdoms and treasures of the Righteous God race were.

Not to mention anything else, just those divine kingdoms alone could allow the devouring dragon race to receive a huge boost.

As for the other resources, there was no need to mention them.

This amount of resources was very important to the Dragon Palace.

However, he didn’t expect it to be snatched away by someone.

He immediately opened his AI and ordered some of his subordinates to start gathering some information about the lich kingdom.

Wang Xian sat on the Dragon Chair and pondered for a while. Then, he disappeared instantly and arrived at the Red Gold Dragon Palace.

At this moment, half of the building materials in the entire Dragon Palace were gone.

Ao crab’s huge body was still devouring continuously.

“Dragon King!”

Sensing Wang Xian’s arrival, ao crab immediately stopped and bowed to him.

“How long will it take to devour the Dragon Palace and the Dragon Palace of the Divine Wind and Thunder Dragon?”

Wang Xian asked him directly.

“Dragon King, I’m afraid it will take another one to two years. This dragon palace is too sturdy and has too much energy.”

Ao he replied immediately.

A powerful Dragon King’s Dragon Palace was not so easy to devour.

One had to know that back then, even a universe knight level 8 or 9 warrior could not break through these dragon palaces.

Ao he also started to devour from the inside. If it was from the outside, he would not be able to bite through it.

It was within his expectations that the devouring process would be so slow.

“HMM, it’s alright. There’s no rush!”

Wang Xian nodded.

This speed wasn’t slow either!

Initially, Wang Xian planned to wait for the Dragon Palace to reach the starry sky surrounding the land. After absorbing the ancient sea race, he would wait for a few more years before he could land. Now, some of the situation had been disrupted by the Lich Kingdom.

However, he still did not plan to land immediately.

The battle to land would have to wait for Ao crab and the others to upgrade themselves.

As for the Lich Kingdom, Wang Xian could settle it without ao crab and the others.

He moved his body and returned to the Dragon Palace immediately. He opened the universal AI and searched for some information about the lich kingdom.

The Lich Kingdom was a faction at the edge of the heaven-opening primeval continent.

One could also choose to challenge the Lich kingdom for the landing battle, but basically, no faction would choose to do so.

They were ranked in the top three at the edge of the continent.

The Wizard faction belonged to the peak faction. They fought against those of a higher level. Their strange attacking methods made the other factions in the heaven-splitting primeval continent apprehensive.

“Huh?”

However, when Wang Xian began to search for information about the Lich Kingdom, he saw the latest news.

“The treasures of the Righteous God race and the Divine Kingdoms of all the strong and elites have all been obtained by the Lich Kingdom. When the Dragon King rushed over, he could only flee in a sorry state in the face of the strong warriors of the Lich clan!”

“The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is too arrogant. Your spoils of war, your treasures, and the forces surrounding the starry sky do not dare to touch them. However, the forces of the heaven-splitting primeval continent dare to touch them. Now that the treasures of the righteous God race have all been taken by the Lich Kingdom, don’t you dare to Say Anything?”? Trash!”

There were quite a few pieces of information similar to this. Furthermore, it was quite popular now.

This made Wang Xian raise his eyebrows slightly.
