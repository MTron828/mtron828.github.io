Translator: 549690339

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The dazzling battle continued.

The rumbling sound covered the sky and the Sun!

When Wang Xian saw this scene, a look of astonishment appeared on his face!

“In a battle of this level, even if I were to enter, I would probably be killed. Fortunately, these elemental gods do not have intelligence. ” Lin Niu exclaimed with some emotion!

The battle between the elements was indeed terrifying!

They didn’t have intelligence, but it was abnormally explosive.

They had no life and no intelligence. It was purely an instinctive confrontation.

The outcome of the battle between the two elements might be complete annihilation. One side might even be devoured.

They wouldn’t retreat nor did they know fear.

If there weren’t any special circumstances, it wouldn’t end.

Wang Xian nodded and watched carefully.

The battle continued. At the beginning, it was the battle between the flames and the golden glow.

As they fought, the golden glow and the flames were dissipating continuously.

The area covered by the flames and the golden glow was also shrinking rapidly.

As time passed, their respective territories became smaller and smaller.

Following that, at the center of the Flames, the white flame flower charged forward.

A resplendent golden pillar at the center of the Golden Glow also began to collide with the white flame flower.

The physical collision between the elements.

Boom Boom Boom

Boom Boom

The collision began. The battle began!

At this moment, Wang Xian had been watching the battle here for more than 10 ,ooo years!

They didn’t leave. Instead, they were watching this huge battle to see if they could gain anything from it!

The battle between the elemental bodies was still as brutal as ever.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The collision was a direct collision!

Sparks and metal fragments flew in all directions as they collided.

“Huh?”

At this moment, Wang Xian stared at the Sparks and metal fragments.

His eyes lit up!

After the Sparks and metal fragments flew out, they slowly returned to their bodies.

There were also a few fragments that turned into energy and filled the surrounding area.

“Fragments of the elements?”

Wang Xian’s mind stirred as he revealed a hesitant expression!

Boom! Boom! Boom

Boom! Boom! Boom

The collisions continued. With each collision, there were some fragments scattered out!

The strength of these two elemental gods was extremely terrifying.

At the very least, if Wang Xian were to fight them, he would be the one to die!

It could be said that he was comparable to an existence at the control level.

“These fragments are an incomparably huge treasure. ”

Wang Xian’s heart was burning with passion.

The fragments of the two elemental gods were equivalent to the flesh and blood of the Heaven’s origin avatar!

It was definitely a supreme treasure!

One had to know that the qilin cow was once just one of the four limbs of the Asgardian demon god.

“Let’s go over and see if we can obtain those fragments!”

Wang Xian’s heart was burning with passion.

His entire body burst into flames and he couldn’t help but fly in!

He flew to the back of the flower of flames and was prepared to fly over from the back of the flower of flames!

Boom! Boom

However, this time, when Wang Xian entered the back of the flower of flames, something unexpected happened!

At the front, the Golden Pillar that was originally fighting with the flower of flames was attacking Wang Xian directly!

Rays of golden light were attacking him from the surrounding areas!

Although the flower of flames was colliding with him, the golden pillar seemed to have its eyes on Wang Xian. It completely ignored the attack of the flower of flames!

There was no such thing as defense in an elemental battle.

Therefore, even if the golden pillar did not resist, the flower of flames would still be able to injure the enemy by itself!

“What’s going on?”

Wang Xian’s expression changed.

His body shook and immediately transformed into the body of a metal elemental divine dragon!

The entire body of the dragon also emitted a golden glow!

However, when he transformed into the body of a metal elemental divine dragon, the surrounding flames immediately attacked him!

When Wang Xian saw this scene, his expression changed slightly.

His body moved and he flew into the distance, leaving their battle range!

When Wang Xian flew out quickly, the two elemental gods continued to fight!

Whoosh

“This won’t do. I Can’t enter at all. Once I enter, I will be attacked! ” Wang Xian said with a frown.

If he didn’t enter, he wouldn’t be able to obtain the elemental fragments inside.

“Entering the fire attribute will result in me being attacked by the elemental gods of the metal attribute. If I transform into the metal attribute, I will be attacked by the flame flower. If I transform into other attributes, I will probably be attacked by them together! ”

Wang Xian thought to himself as he continued to ponder.

He watched as the battle continued to erupt. His mind was spinning non-stop.

No wonder the elven empress was not too surprised when she learned that Wang Xian had encountered the Elemental God!

Although this elemental god was an incomparably huge treasure, it was impossible for him to control it!

What was the use of a treasure that could not be controlled?

Even if they were engaged in a great battle, there would be fragments that would escape, but they would not be able to enter.

In fact, even if one was strong, they could suppress two elemental gods.

But when one entered, they would also be attacked by two elemental gods.

And this pure Elemental God’s origin energy, once it was attacked, its body would not drop any fragments, but would instead melt.

This also meant that it was impossible to obtain the fragments of the Elemental God artificially.

Only the collision between the Elemental God and the Elemental God, the collision of pure energy, did not contain any other energy, bloodline, or constitution.

Only then could it cause their bodies to fall into pieces and not be melted by the energy.

Wang Xian thought to himself. After hesitating for a while, he thought of something.

Buzz

He flew towards the battlefield of the two elemental gods once again.

However, this time, he flew from the center of the two battlefields!

His dragon body began to change as well.

Half of it was a fire dragon and the other half was a metal dragon!

Furthermore, the flames and the metal radiance were constantly interweaving and fusing!

There was a special taiji pattern on his body and underneath him.

It was a tai chi pattern formed by the metal and fire attributes!

When these two tai chi patterns were fused together, the metal and fire attributes were intertwined and transformed continuously!

This time, when he entered the battlefield of the two elemental gods again.

The two elemental gods paused for a moment before they continued to fight.

It was as if they didn’t sense Wang Xian’s arrival.

It wasn’t that they didn’t sense him.

It was just that for the elemental gods who had no intelligence, no consciousness, and only instincts, Wang Xian was like a Bug!

In the past, he was of the fire attribute, but in the next moment, he was of the metal attribute!

Under all sorts of circumstances, the elemental gods who had instincts would go down!

After appearing many times, the two elemental gods ignored Wang Xian and continued to fight!

“It’s a success! ”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with excitement!
