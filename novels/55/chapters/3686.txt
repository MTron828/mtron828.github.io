“Hehe!”

When Wang Xian saw that the three of them were about to escape, a smile appeared on his face. He stared at them mockingly and asked, “Can you guys leave?”

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

As soon as he finished his sentence, the old witch, water demon, Ming shisheng, and demon wings slowly walked out from behind Wang Xian.

They looked at the three old crazy demons, Shi Senlei shimmering and blotting out the sky. Their eyes were filled with mockery!

“A bunch of idiots. You still want to escape? You’d better obediently submit to our Dragon King!”

Monster Wings said lightly!

Not long ago, he had just been suppressed. Now, seeing that these three old monsters of the same level as him were about to be suppressed, he was in a very good mood!

“Huh?”

“What? Old Witch, you’re not dead? And you, water demon, Ming Sha Sheng, and monster wings, you’ve submitted to the Dragon King?”

Lei Shan and the others, who were about to leave, saw the old witch and the others appear. Their pupils constricted slightly, and their faces were filled with shock!

They looked at them in disbelief.

The old witch, water demon, Ming shisheng, and Demon Wing were the Old Mad Demons of their invincible region!

The most supreme existences!

Now, they actually appeared at the same time, and they even submitted to the Dragon King?

This? ? ?

They found it unbelievable!

“I really didn’t expect that all of you would submit to the Dragon King. Hehe!”

The white clouds covered the sky. Slowly, branches extended out and stared at them warily as he spoke!

Whoosh

As soon as he finished his sentence, Wang Xian flapped the uninitiated holy wings on his back and instantly appeared at the place where they had to retreat!

“They have surrendered. It’s your turn now. Surrender or die. There’s no other choice!”

Wang Xian stared at them and said indifferently!

None of the lunatics in the invincible zone were kind, so he didn’t have to worry anymore!

Surrender or Die!

“Dragon King, you don’t put us in your eyes. Do you think that you can stop the three of us with just the three of you?”

Lei Shan’s expression slowly darkened as he stared at Wang Xian and said!

“It’s easy to kill all of you!”

Wang Xian looked at him and said indifferently!

“Hahaha, kill us? With just the five of you? arrogant. Dragon King, you’re too arrogant!”

Shi Sen let out a furious roar as his body slowly grew bigger. The khaki-colored energy on his body charged towards the surroundings!

“Killing the three of you is indeed not difficult!”

Wu Sha said slowly and the staff appeared in her hand. “Shi Sen, Lightning Flash, I advise you to submit now and suffer less physical pain!”

“HMPH!”

Lightning flash snorted and immediately transmitted his voice. “Sky shrouding, Shi Sen, attack the Dragon King and break through!”

“Crackle crackle!”

As soon as he finished his sentence, a terrifying power of lightning burst out from his body instantly!

Shi Sen raised his palm at the side and clenched it forcefully. An incomparably huge earthy yellow ball appeared in the sky above him!

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Within the dark clouds, countless branches were attacking Wang Xian!

The three of them launched a terrifying attack at Wang Xian at the same time!

“Five Elements Millstone, activate!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly when he saw them attacking him. With a move of his palm, the five elements millstone appeared in front of him!

His palm landed on the Millstone and the five elements power surged into it to receive their attack!

At the same time, four Netherspirit avatars appeared beside him and also met their attack!

“Boom!”

“Boom!”

A terrifying collision sound rang out. The attacks of Shi Sen, Lei Shan, and sky shrouding landed on the attacks of the five elements millstone and the netherspirit avatars!

The energy surged and disappeared quickly!

Wang Xian managed to fend off their attacks alone!

“This is impossible!”

“This strength…”

Seeing that the Dragon King was able to fend off their attacks alone, the expressions of Lei Shan and the other two changed once again!

“You don’t know your limits. You insist on US teaching you a lesson!”

Ming shasheng let out a low growl. In an instant, more than 200 black shadows charged towards Shi Senlei and the rest!

The water demon wings also charged straight at them!

Wu Sha immediately set up a formation behind them!

“Hehe, I won’t shed tears until I see my coffin!”

Wang Xian moved his palm and the five elements millstone smashed towards Lei Shan!

The terrifying energy carried by the five elements grindstone caused Lei Shan’s expression to change drastically!

He quickly dodged to the side!

Crash

However, at this moment, Wang Xian moved and attacked Lei Shan in an instant!

“What speed! He’s too fast! His speed is too fast!”

When he saw Wang Xian attacking him, Lei Shan’s expression changed drastically again!

“Lightning, Bloodline Burst!”

At the spot between his brows, the lightning symbol emitted a glow and enveloped his entire body!

Crackle 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

In an instant, he burst out with a speed that was not inferior to Wang Xian’s and dodged backward!

“Eh? He can actually burst out with such a fast speed?”

The burst of lightning caused Wang Xian to reveal a stunned expression.

“Let me see how long you can hold on!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were locked on him as streams of wind and lightning attacked him!

“This Dragon King’s speed is terrifying. I Can’t do it. I have to escape immediately. I can only hold on for about ten minutes!”

Lei Shan’s expression was a little grave. He was like a real terrifying lightning bolt. With a light tap, he flew to the right!

Whoosh

Wang Xian flapped his genesis saint wings and chased after him immediately!

“Bind!”

At the same time, a spiritual figure appeared on his shoulder. She held the water lotus staff and bound Lei Shan!

“What the Hell Is This?”

Lei Shan’s expression changed drastically when he saw a surge of energy coming towards him!

The water energy was hindering his speed!

It reduced his speed by a lot!

“Dragon Breath of Life!”

Wang Xian opened his mouth and a torrent of energy rushed towards him!

His expression changed drastically as a lightning shield appeared around him.

The Lightning Shield rotated around him as he flew rapidly in an attempt to escape from this place!

“Dragon Claw!”

Wang Xian’s eyes focused as his arm turned into a dragon claw. The light and dark divine dragon on the Taiji Dragon disk immediately circled around him to strengthen him!

“Bang!”

A powerful force directly broke through the Lightning Shield around Lei Shan.

“This dragon king is too terrifying!”

In just an instant, Lei Shan realized how terrifying Wang Xian was. His heart pounded violently!

The Dragon Claw clawed at his body. The powerful force caused his body to tremble violently. He couldn’t help but fall downwards!

“PFFT!”

At the same time, he spat out a large amount of blood!

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

At this moment, the four Netherspirit avatars arrived at his surroundings. Wang Xian also continued to attack him!

“It’s over. They are not on the same level!”

Lei Shan’s expression changed drastically when he saw Wang Xian charging at him again!

He felt that he was on a completely different level from the Dragon King. He had no way of resisting at all!

Total Annihilation!
