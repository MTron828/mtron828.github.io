2581 2581 was upgraded and they entered the Abyss again Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

When they returned to the Dragon Palace, Ao Qitian, Ao Yao, and the other two immediately entered the dragon transformation pool!

This time, Wang Xian was prepared to allow the three of them to upgrade their combat strength to Level 7 immortal King!

In addition, Wang Xian used the rest of the corpses he obtained this time to pile up high-end combat strength!

He obtained more than a dozen level 6 immortal king corpses, and even more level 5 and Level 4 immortal King corpses!

These over 1,000 corpses were all used to increase the level 6 and level 5 combat strength of the Immortal King!

When he stepped into the Abyss again, Wang Xian was prepared to bring all of them to the lair of the Void Mountain of the abyss seed!

If he was lucky enough to capture more than a dozen level 7 immortal King Abyss seeds, then the strength of the Dragon Palace would receive a huge increase!

Time passed day by day, the members of the Dragon Palace quickly rose!

However, in front of the closest abyss entrance to the star South star system, the Warriors of the Sky Mountain Sword sect stood not far away, their expressions extremely ugly!

“It’s already been five days, the sixth elder and the rest haven’t come out yet!”

An elder looked at the bottomless abyss in front of him, his expression ugly!

In the main sect, once an expert led his disciples into the Abyss, there would be a fixed date!

Normally, if they agreed to come out in two months, they would basically come out in a few days around two months!

However, it had already exceeded the fixed period of ten days, and there was still no one!

In the Abyss, one could not directly return to their own divine kingdom, and they could not communicate with each other. Once they did not return for a long time, they would most likely be in danger!

“Damn it, with the sixth Elder’s vigilance, he shouldn’t be in trouble, unless he really encounters a powerful being, an unstoppable being!”

A middle aged man’s expression was incredibly ugly as he roared softly!

This time, they had dozens of undying emperors heading over, an elder, this power wasn’t small to their Sky Mountain Sword sect!

“We’ll wait another 5 days, if they don’t arrive in 5 days, then something bad will happen!”

The leading elder sighed and said!

“HM? The Sky Mountain Sword sect people have been waiting there for a few days, waiting for their people!”

At this time, in a restaurant far away on the continent, 2 middle aged men looked over and said softly!

“HMM, there should be some experts from the sects who haven’t come out yet!”

The two of them didn’t pay too much attention as they spoke. They were mainly monitoring the people from the Dragon Palace!

Five days passed once again. In the Dragon Palace, Ao Yaoyao, AO qitian, and Ao Qi had completed their upgrades!

At the same time, there were 15 more level 6 immortal King realm experts and 40 level 5 immortal King realm experts at the side!

Wang Xian swept his gaze across them and revealed a satisfied expression!

“Let’s go, Let’s Go!”

His eyes sparkled as he immediately ordered the members!

This time, there were still 200 members. However, there were a total of four level 7 immortal king powerhouses including him!

There were 15 level 6 immortal king powerhouses and 40 level 5 immortal king powerhouses!

The rest were all level 3 immortal King Warriors!

200 members were almost 80% of the core members of the Dragon Palace!

“Let’s Go!”

They flew over quickly. After more than 10 hours, Wang Xian and the rest arrived at the entrance of the Abyss and flew toward the land!

“Let’s go. It’s been 15 days. Sixth Elder and the rest should be dead!”

As soon as Wang Xian and the rest arrived on land, they saw a group of people flying out!

He took a glance and revealed a cold smile on his face!

“Sky Mountain Sword sect!”

Muttering to himself, he flew rapidly into the Abyss!

“Let’s go straight to the lair of the Void Mountain. If there’s another level seven immortal king level abyss seed this time, we will be able to kill it!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were sparkling with excitement!

“Let’s speed up and fly over!”

He said and flew towards the lair of the giant mountain and abyssal seed!

As the distance was relatively far, it would take at least a few days to fly over!

When Wang Xian and the rest stepped into the Abyss again, their news was also transmitted to the five major forces!

However, this time, the five major forces did not take any action!

“The Dragon King has led the powerhouses of the Dragon Palace to take action again. What should we do? Should we just watch?”

On a planet in the ninth-grade heaven sect’s domain, the sect master of the three seas sect growled in a low and gloomy voice!

Previously, only he and the ninth-grade Heaven Sect’s patriarch had escaped. They did not discover that he had harmed the two powerhouses of the Jianhua Group and the Black Forest Group!

Now that he received this news, the three seas sect leader’s expression was Savage!

Last Time, the three seas sect had also sent 60 undying godly king warriors, and now there were only about 100 of them!

Because of the Dragon Palace, the three seas sect had suffered terrible losses!

...

But the more it was like this, the more the three seas sect leader wanted revenge. He wanted the Dragon Palace to be destroyed, he wanted to kill everyone in the Dragon Palace!

The current Dragon Palace had almost become the three seas sect leader’s inner demon!

“We suffered heavy losses last time, that Dragon King is so crafty, unless the five of us gather all the warriors, it will be too hard to destroy them!”

The Jian hua group’s CEO said with a dark expression!

The losses last time were too heavy, their Jian Hua Group only had four undying level 6 warriors, they had lost half of them!

If the losses continued, they could not afford it!

Most importantly, the last time the Dragon King brought 700 undying godly monarchs and that strange assassin!

If they wanted to destroy the Dragon King and the rest, they had to use all their strength!

Even the ninth grade sky sect had to send all their warriors, that was possible!

“Send all their warriors?”

The vice sect master of the ninth-grade sky sect frowned, and his expression changed!

...

“Oh right, I’ve received a piece of news!”

At this moment, the sect master of the demon Slayer sect who had been sitting at the side suddenly raised his head!

“Oh? What News?”

The group of experts looked at him!

“I’ve received a piece of news from the Sky Mountain Sword sect. The group of experts from the Sky Mountain Sword sect who went to the abyss this time may have already died!”

“And I heard from sect master Ji that the position of the Dragon King and the others last time was told by the Sky Mountain Sword sect, and there was some conflict between the Sky Mountain Sword sect and the Dragon Palace!”

The sect master of the demon Slayer sect said indifferently!

“HMM? You mean to frame the Dragon King? To sow discord between the sky mountain sword sect and the Dragon Palace? That’s unlikely!”

The vice sect master of the ninth-grade sky sect frowned and then shook his head!

“According to the information we received, when the Dragon King came out, the people of the Sky Mountain Sword sect happened to have disappeared. The Dragon King and the others had enough motive, and it was also a very coincidental one!”

The sect master of the demon-slaying sect continued with a twinkle in his eyes!

“Even so, if there is no conclusive evidence, the Sky Mountain Sword sect would not be the enemy of the Dragon Palace. Moreover, we have such an obvious motive. The Sky Mountain Sword sect is not stupid!”

An expert from the Black Forest group frowned. He felt that it was not feasible!
