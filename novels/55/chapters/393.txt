Chapter 394: Mutated Divine Dragon (1)

“They weren’t killed by Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown? But based on all other objective signs...?”

In an office in a skyscraper, a middle-aged man wearing a suit saw the reply from the Sacred Followers Guild on his computer screen. His eyebrows knitted together.

Based on the information gathered by the personnel from their Omniscient Group, the experts from the Sacred Followers Guild and the crowd that came to watch the show had not left the villa of Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown after entering it.

As to what really happened, they couldn’t be certain. Nonetheless, they were sure that these people were dead.

Therefore, their Omniscient Group had announced the deaths of the experts from the Sacred Followers Guild. Following the operatives of the Group closely to ensure hundred percent reliability, they didn’t confirm that those people were killed by Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown.

“Were they killed by savage beasts from the sea? Could it be that Miracle Doctor Wang has a dreadful and savage sea beast as a pet? Or could it be just like what the Sacred Followers Guild claimed, that the experts encountered an accident with savage beasts from the sea?”

At dawn, Rivertown was covered in a storm. Most of the truth was masked or washed away. Even the Omniscient Group found it hard to verify most of the information and they weren’t a hundred percent certain.

Nonetheless, a lot of martial artists felt more relieved at this point.

If the experts from the Sacred Followers Guild had been killed by Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown, that demon-like existence would be truly too terrifying.

...

At this very moment, within a cave abode deep in the mountain surrounded by flowers and birds...

It was a luxurious and beautiful cave abode. A beautiful lady and a burly middle-aged man were sitting in the center. Before them, a group of middle-aged men stood upright and neatly.

“Don’t we have any news on Yaoquan yet?”

The beautiful lady gritted her teeth and her eyes were a little red as she questioned the burly middle-aged man before the group of middle-aged men.

“Madam, we still do not have information on young master at this moment.”

“From what we gathered from the people around the Yellow River, we understand that young master had some conflicts with Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown. Subsequently, we found out that young master contacted the family head of the Lei Family and the Double-faced Heavenly Axe before his disappearance,” the group of middle-aged men replied solemnly.

The disappearance of Bian Yaoquan had caused a huge ruckus within the Medical Saint Sect. The Bian branch of the Medical Saint Sect was expending all efforts and resources to investigate.

However, Bian Yaoquan and the Poison Duo had kept their actions completely secretive and hadn’t told anyone about them.

“Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown?” The burly middle-aged man sitting by the side frowned as his expression gradually turned heavy. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“With the Poison Duo around, even a strong First-class Force would find it hard to erase them without leaving traces behind. This Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown...”

A gloomy light flashed in the eyes of the burly middle-aged man as he spoke bitterly.

It had been close to half a month! His son had been missing for close to half a month! With Poison Duo protecting him, ordinary First-class Forces would find it hard to kill them without leaving traces of clues behind.

Based on the rumors of Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown over the last two days, he would likely possess such capabilities.

“Find out more about this Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown. I want every piece of information regarding him!” instructed the burly middle-aged man.

“Yes, Sect Leader!” the group of middle-aged men responded in unison before leaving.

“Qingfeng, Yaoquan will be fine. He will be fine!” said the beautiful lady with teary eyes as she grabbed onto the arm of the burly middle-aged man.

“He will be fine. I’m Bian Qingfeng. No one dares to harm my son! No one dares!”

The burly middle-aged man tried to console the lady. He lifted his head and wore a stern and fierce expression. “If anyone dares to, he will die no matter who he is!”

...

At night, a yacht was steering towards the sea from the villa connected to the sea.

“Brother, will you really be able to cure my master and me in the Dragon Palace?”

It was a little dark and the heavy rain continued pouring. The group sat on the sofa of the yacht when Xiao Yu suddenly asked Wang Xian this.

“Of course. Rest assured. Brother will be bringing you to a place filled with miracles!”

Wang Xian nodded his head with a gentle smile.

When night fell, Wang Xian decided to not wait any further. He got up and brought Xiao Yu and Elder Fang along as he steered towards the Dragon Palace.

He planned to make use of the tremendous energy within the Dragon Transformation Pool to transform the two of them into dragons and cleanse the venom lingering within their bodies.

This was also his last-ditch attempt.

“Really? I didn’t get to go the previous time and I definitely have to make it up this time. It’s a shame that the final examinations are coming up soon. I’ll likely miss it this time!”

Xiao Yu was initially exhilarated but soon pulled a long face as she spoke.

The semester was coming to an end and the final examinations would be starting soon. However, she would likely miss the examination.

“It’s alright. I’ll settle the matters about your examinations!” Wang Xian smiled and shook his head as he continued, “Where would you like to go for the winter holidays? I’ll bring you around!”

“Winter holidays...?”

When Xiao Yu heard Wang Xian, her eyes lit up. “I want to roam the entire country from the South to the North. For the summer holidays, I want to head overseas to play!”

Xiao Yu let her thoughts roam and revealed a satisfied and joyous expression.

“Alright. When you recover, I’ll bring you around!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and Elder Fang beside him also smiled.

Next to her, Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue and Sun Lingxiu walked over.

With a group of beautiful girls accompanying him, Wang Xian had a great time chatting and eating.

Late at night, the yacht arrived above the Dragon Palace.

“Xiao Yu, Elder Fang! Don’t be too surprised in a while! Let’s go!” Wang Xian carried Xiao Yu and supported Elder Fang as he remarked.

To the astonishment of the two girls, Wang Xian carried and pulled them along as they dived into the sea.

When the majestic and awe-inspiring Dragon Palace appeared before them, the two girls were dumbfounded.

Despite having heard about the Dragon Palace from Lan Qingyue and Guan Shuqing, Xiao Yu was still deeply astonished when she saw the incomparably huge Dragon Palace under the water’s surface.

The beautiful Dragon Palace made her feel innate respect and fear for it.

It was especially so when they arrived at the Dragon Palace. Their eyes widened as they stared at the various huge structures around them.

Swish swish swish!

At this moment, several creatures swam towards Wang Xian.

The first to arrive were the Nine Venomous Sea Snakes. They remained stationary before Wang Xian in a respectful manner.

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

At this instant, more and more creatures appeared with each being more unique in physique than the last.

They swam before Wang Xian, went down on one knee and greeted him.

“This... Are these the Crawfish Soldiers and Crab Generals of the Dragon Palace?”

Xiao Yu’s eyes widened in disbelief as she stared at the Dragon Palace members before her.

Even Wang Xian was shocked as he looked at the crowd before him.

The ones at the very front were the Anomalocaris and the Golden Swordfish race. At this point, the two races had undergone the baptism of the Dragon Transformation Pool.

After the baptism, their form had undergone tremendous changes.

The Anomalocaris was standing upright. Around them, bluish sparks glowed. Two incomparably huge front limbs looked forceful and seemed to be hiding horrifying electric energy.

The stature of approximately 2.5 meters looked extremely intimidating!
