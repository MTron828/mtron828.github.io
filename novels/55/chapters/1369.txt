Chapter 1370: In the Dongyuan dynasty where 1370 peed their pants

“There’s no need. Get Up!”

Wang Xian saw the millions of pairs of eyes looking at him with respect and admiration. He waved his hand with a smile and said nonchalantly.

Feng Luan came to Wang Xian’s side and looked at him with a smile. She said softly, “Thank You!”

“Haha!”

Wang Xian raised his head slightly and laughed loudly as he looked at her with an arrogant look.

“HMPH!”

Feng Luan rolled her eyes at him when she saw her behavior. She snorted softly and looked at the members of the Dragon Palace. “I really didn’t expect them to improve to such a terrifying level in just half a year!”

“That’s because I’m back. Naturally, they will be able to improve tremendously!”

Wang Xian laughed and echoed from the side.

“You are really thick-skinned!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Feng Luan looked at him speechlessly.

“Sigh, look at Her Majesty the Queen and Lord Wang chatting and laughing. This is very rare. Her Majesty the Queen has always been extremely cold. Is it because her majesty and Lord Wang have...”

“Don’t Talk About Her Majesty behind her back. HMM, but I feel that our queen and Lord Wang are very compatible. Furthermore, the Queen and Lord Wang are very close!”

“It would be great if the queen could really be together with Sir Wang. With Sir Wang around, who would our dragon-phoenix Empire be afraid of?”

“Perhaps our queen and Sir Wang are already together. You Don’t know that this city was given to our Queen by Sir Wang. Also, every time we are in trouble, Sir Wang would come over to help us. What do you want to say...”

At the back, the citizens who were floating in the sky saw the intimate interaction between Wang Xian and Feng Luan. They looked over from time to time and laughed.

The generals and soldiers on the city wall also turned over.

Their faces were filled with smiles.

They really hoped that Her Majesty the Queen could be together with Sir Wang...

With Sir Wang around, they would have nothing to fear in the future.

During today’s battle, Wang Xian’s position in the dragon and Phoenix dynasty was almost comparable to Feng Luan’s.

“Reporting to the Queen, the army of the Dongyuan dynasty is currently at a location of 15 kilometers away. They are expected to arrive in five minutes!”

At this moment, a scout flew over quickly and reported loudly.

“Dongyuan Dynasty?”

Feng Luan revealed a smile when she heard the Scout’s report.

“The Fourth Dynasty!”

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up and he couldn’t help but lick his tongue.

The delivery man had arrived!

“Those scumbags from the Dongyuan dynasty. Since they are here, we will give them a surprise. Haha!”

The generals from the dragon and Phoenix dynasty laughed confidently.

At this moment, an army was flying towards them at a speed of 15 kilometers away from the dragon and Phoenix Dynasty.

This army was completely different from the three dynasties of the star-moon dynasty.

At the front of the army were rows of palace maids, each of whom was riding on colorful birds and beasts.

They stood on top with a huge cattail leaf fan in their hands.

A total of 20 palace maids stood on both sides, and at the back was a sedan chair that was 20 meters long.

The sedan chair was pulled by ten five-meter-long beasts, and in the middle of the sedan chair sat a middle-aged man in a luxurious dragon robe.

The middle-aged man in the Dragon Robe had a small mustache, and the two concubines on his left and right were serving him.

Behind him was a powerful army.

This trip did not seem to be for war, but for tourism.

“Speed up. We can’t let star-moon dynasty destroy them. We must get the dragon-phoenix Dynasty’s flourishing age fire lotus and the flourishing age fire Lotus Array Formation!”

The middle-aged man in the Dragon Robe who was sitting on the dragon palanquin looked at the information in his hand. He frowned slightly and said to an old man around him.

“Yes, your Majesty!”

The old man revealed a bitter smile. How could he be fast enough to destroy a dynasty with such a formation?

However, the old man could only mumble in his heart. He shouted at the surrounding people and sped up a little.

“Your Majesty, there’s no need to be anxious. The Dragon-phoenix dynasty actually dared to kill our envoys. We can easily destroy them. Even if the star-moon dynasty has already destroyed the Dragon-phoenix dynasty, the treasures still belong to us. They don’t dare to fight with us!”

A woman next to the dragon-robed middle-aged man said with a smile.

“Beware of accidents!”

The dragon-robed middle-aged eastern Yuan king frowned as he looked at the information in front of him and said indifferently.

“With our Dongyuan dynasty’s strength and your wisdom, nothing unexpected will happen!”

The woman said flatteringly.

“If it was in the past, I naturally wouldn’t be worried, but... a mysterious and powerful force suddenly appeared in our vicinity!”

The Dongyuan King’s eyes flickered. “They destroyed the Sky Island dynasty and the one leaf continent dynasty. That’s the one leaf continent dynasty!”

“What? There’s actually such a powerful force?”

The Dongyuan King’s words caused the two women to be slightly shocked, and their expressions changed slightly.

“Yes, but after we obtain the flourishing age fire lotus and the flourishing age fire Lotus Array, our strength will be greatly increased. It Won’t be long before our strength will surpass the one leaf continent empire. When that time comes, we won’t be afraid even if we meet that force!”

A trace of arrogance slowly appeared on the Dongyuan King’s face.

“That’s for sure. Even if His Majesty meets that mysterious faction now, with His Majesty’s powerful strength, he will be able to crush everything.”

“In this flowing sea region, other than the top factions in the LADYBOY graveyard, other than the carefree city lord position, you are the most powerful!”

The two women continued to lick.

“Haha, of course!”

The king of Dongyuan lay down and narrowed his eyes, his face full of enjoyment.

He did not take the dragon-phoenix Dynasty’s attack to heart at all.

However, when he thought of the graceful figure of the dragon-phoenix Queen, his heart burned with passion.

The magnificent army flew toward the Dragon-phoenix dynasty.

“HMM? What a strong smell of blood. Is there a fight already?”

“Maybe the star-moon empire has already destroyed the dragon-phoenix Empire. After all, a small dragon-phoenix can’t resist the Alliance of three dynasties at all!”

“We have to be quick too. Our king is determined to get that treasure!”

“Faster!”

On both sides, the insightful emptiness realm experts whispered to each other when they smelled the smell of blood in front of them.

As the army flew, the dragon-phoenix Imperial City appeared in their line of sight.

“The Dongyuan Dynasty has arrived, the Dongyuan King has arrived!”

“Has the dragon-phoenix Dynasty been destroyed?”

When the dragon-phoenix Imperial City appeared in their line of sight, the arrogant voice of an old man sitting beside the king of the Dongyuan dynasty directly covered the front.

“The dragon-phoenix Dynasty has killed our country’s envoy and snatched the treasures. Today, our Dongyuan Dynasty’s army has come to subvert it!”

The old man explained his intentions and the entire Dongyuan dynasty army flew forward proudly.

However, as they got closer and closer to the dragon and Phoenix dynasty, they felt that the atmosphere was a little weird.

On the city wall, a group of soldiers and soldiers were looking at them mockingly?
