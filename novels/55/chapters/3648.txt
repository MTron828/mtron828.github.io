3649 3648, snatch the treasure and set up an ambush! Go

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian didn’t expect the seven black tortoise to really trade with him!

One ordinary embryo fruit in exchange for five innate spiritual treasures!

This was definitely a huge profit!

It was a completely unfair trade!

This could also be seen how important the ordinary embryo fruit was to some of the experts in the invincible region!

Some of the old monsters in the invincible region had become stronger, but their realms had yet to break through. This would cause their state of mind to be unable to control their own strength!

A treasure that could stabilize one’s state of mind and strengthen one’s state of mind was far more important than what Wang Xian had imagined!

This was also the reason why the Angel clan had deliberately announced that the Dragon King possessed a treasure that could stabilize one’s state of mind!

“If you guys still wish to continue the transaction, you can look for me on the Universal Ai!”

After the transaction was completed, Wang Xian said to them with a smile on his face.

“Alright!”

The seven black tortoise experts squeezed out a smile and nodded their heads!

Wang Xian nodded his head and continued flying forward!

“This Dragon King is asking for too much!”

“One is willing to fight and the other is willing to suffer. There’s nothing we can do about it.”

As they watched Wang Xian’s figure leave, the seven black tortoise experts shook their heads helplessly.

The other party didn’t force them to sell the fruit.

“However, this fruit is of great use to us. The energy of this fruit can enhance our intelligence. It is even more important to the top experts of the Invincible Region!”

A black tortoise expert sized up the fruits in his hand. His eyes were sparkling!

“For top experts, one fruit is not enough. It would be best if there are more than ten of them, or even more!”

One of the experts beside him hesitated for a moment and carefully stored the fruit!

“The price is too high. Spread the news that the Dragon King has a mind-stabilizing spiritual fruit!”

One of the black tortoise experts curled the corners of his mouth slightly and said indifferently!

The other black tortoise experts nodded with a smile and a twinkle in their eyes.

In any case, there were already experts in the invincible region who spread the news that the Dragon King had a mind-stabilizing spiritual treasure. It was no big deal for them to spread the news again!

They were also prepared to spread the news about the price!

As for whether the other experts in the Invincible Zone wanted to buy it or snatch it, they couldn’t care less!

Their actions were also an expression of their dissatisfaction towards Wang Xian.

The price was too high!

There might not be anyone who would carry out the transaction!

Instead, they would carry out… snatching!

Wang Xian flew towards the depths of the invincible zone. The seven black tortoise experts had already spread the news to the experts they were familiar with!

Furthermore, it was passed to the circle of the powerhouses from the other peak races in the Invincible Zone!

However, when the news that the Dragon King had a treasure that could stabilize his mind was confirmed, it caused quite a number of people to be shocked!

However, when they saw the price that the Dragon King was selling, their faces turned black!

“A divine fruit of the peak level of a universe knight actually requires five innate spiritual treasures to exchange for it. Isn’t this too underhanded?”

“This is too much, this is indeed too much. This level of fruit, the more we can get, the better. For those top-tier warriors, we need at least a dozen or so, a dozen or so, exchanging for 60 to 70 upper sky spiritual treasures, this price is too expensive for top-tier Warriors!”

“Looks like Dragon Palace Dragon King has a lot of these god fruits, if he had more, wouldn’t he be able to make crazy demons who have lost their minds recover?”

In the invincible zone, some experts were discussing among themselves!

The divine fruits that could stabilize one’s mind and improve one’s state of mind were very useful to many experts!

Especially for top-tier or even crazy demon-level existences!

If a crazy demon could get a lot of divine fruits, he might even have a chance to get out of his current state and regain his mind!

The experts were speculating! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

This news was spreading little by little in the Invincible Zone!

A bunch of old monsters from the peak races were the first to receive this news. After that, it was spread to other places!

Wang Xian continued to fly deeper into the invincible zone. He would need to fly for about a year to reach the end of the Invincible Zone’s diameter!

“I didn’t expect the Dragon King to really have a treasure that can stabilize his mind. He even made a trade? Hehe, to offer such a high price, the Dragon King is simply courting death!”

In the void of the invincible zone, the eyes of more than a dozen old monsters from the Angel clan lit up when they received the news!

They had just casually fabricated a lie, but the lie turned out to be the truth!

That was a great benefit to them!

The Dragon King had the divine fruit that could stabilize his mind, and the price was so high!

In the invincible region, there were many experts who didn’t want to pay such a high price!

If they captured the Dragon King and even killed him, wouldn’t all the treasures belong to them?

Of course, in the invincible region, there weren’t many who could kill the Dragon King in a one-on-one!

The Dragon King was indeed very strong. He could kill the Mad Demon Prohibition!

However, he couldn’t resist the combined efforts of the old monsters. He couldn’t resist the trump cards of the old monsters!

“Next, I might have to be a little more careful!”

At the same time, Wang Xian, who was flying in the invincible zone, muttered to himself with a smile on his face!

He reckoned that he had revealed the treasure that he had in his hands to stabilize his mind. Similarly, he had deliberately sold it at a high price!

When the time came, he could kill anyone who came to snatch the treasure!

However, Wang Xian had already revealed a little of his strength. He had to be careful next!

He had to prevent the sneak attacks of some old monsters!

He continued flying forward. A month later, there was an area left behind by the dilapidated Kingdom of God!

This was an area that was filled with flames. The entire area was completely engulfed in flames!

In the middle of the flames, there were numerous gigantic meteorites. These meteorites were also emitting high temperatures!

“The energy of the fire attribute is very active. This is a treasured land. There should be some old monsters from the invincible zone cultivating and surviving here!”

Wang Xian looked ahead, his eyes were sparkling!

He didn’t stop and flew straight ahead!

“There are experts who came to our area. Their bodies are emitting the pressure of the Divine Dragon. We can confirm that the purebred divine dragon is the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!”

In the invincible zone, the location of some of the experts could be known in advance once someone entered!

Wang Xian didn’t hide anything and was immediately discovered!

More than a dozen demons in this area immediately emerged from the gigantic meteorites!

This area was called the Sea of demons. From the name, one could tell that this was the position occupied by the old demons from the peak race!

Demons were mainly of the Fire and darkness attributes!

More than a dozen demons could immediately tell from Wang Xian’s aura that he was the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!

“This Dragon King has a treasure that can stabilize his mind. The price for it is very high. Furthermore, with his strength, we won’t be able to kill him even if we join forces!”

More than ten demons immediately communicated with each other!

Their pairs of demon eyes stared greedily at Wang Xian’s figure.

“Let’s not make a move first. Check the direction he is heading towards. We are familiar with the Invincible Zone!”

One of the demons said while his eyes flickered.
