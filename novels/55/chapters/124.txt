Chapter 125: Medical Hall is Open

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Wang Xian ignored that fellow. He was even more annoyed with the middle-aged man.

If both of them came with a good attitude, he would not have any comments.

But all they did was stare hard at him, and judge him from head to toe without any courtesy.

People would have thought that this middle-aged man was a pervert.

Wang Xian usually ignored such people. I don’t care who you are.

Who cares!

The faint smile froze on the face of the middle-aged man. He darkened his expression and glared coldly at Wang Xian.

“Master, this fellow is too arrogant. Last time, he even commented that the Sacred Followers Guild is trash. Too haughty. We ought to teach him a lesson!”

The juvenile by his side stared at Wang Xian as he spoke viciously.

He bored grudges ever since what happened last time. He told his Master about this since he was here.

Yet his Master’s curiosity was piqued, and that was not what he had expected. After some investigations into that young man, the outcome took them by surprise.

According to the information from the Sacred Followers Guild, he was not a disciple of the Sacred Followers Guild.

Wang Xian might have inherited the medical skills from some experts unknowingly.

Hence, his Master had a plan.

“Yes, he’s arrogant. This lad probably thought he could afford to be haughty!”

Radiance flashed in the middle-aged man’s eyes as he stared at Wang Xian. “He thought he could be arrogant since he has ties with Qin Family and Xue Family. Heh.”

“Master, he probably didn’t know what we’re capable of. Should we teach him a lesson?”

Coldness flashed in the juvenile’s eyes.

“Sacred Followers Guild cannot be humiliated. No spirits or God could save them if they did!”

The middle-aged man displayed a cold look. “Initially, I wanted to recruit him to the Sacred Followers Guild and get him to hand over his medical skill inheritance. Since he is so ignorant, I shall not give him any face. Hmph!”

“Master, what should we do?” Upon hearing what his Master said, the juvenile looked surprised.

“We must teach him a lesson. Didn’t he open a medical hall? If that’s the case...”

Radiance flickered in the middle-aged man’s eyes. “Some lads don’t know what’s good for them. We need to teach him a lesson. Hehe.”

“That’s right, Master. We need to teach him a lesson!”

The juvenile showed excitement on his face.

Anyone who provokes Sacred Followers Guild is seeking their own doom.

No spirits nor Gods can save them!

“Let’s go. We’ll meet the people from the Yan Family. I heard that the old man in Yan Family has already attained half-step level,” said the middle-aged man.

“Yes, Master!”

The juvenile nodded and followed behind his Master.

Yan Family was ranked first in the Ancient Martial Artist Family of Rivertown. They were the absolute ultimate existence in this town.

Even though Yan Family had retreated for twenty years and things had changed, they were still known as the first in the Rivertown.

The rest of the Ancient Martial Artist Families could never be comparable with the Yan Family in terms of their capabilities.

Wang Xian came to the Divine Dragon Medical Hall and suggested some ideas to the renovation workers.

Once the renovation was completed, they could use it immediately since they only used materials of the best quality.

In addition, Wang Xian also got Old Qin and Old Xue to promote his business for him.

Publicity was difficult for Wang Xian, but it was a piece of cake for them, especially Old Qin.

Old Qin pulled strings for him. In the future, those eligible patients were recommended here for treatment if they could not get themselves cured in Rivertown’s hospital.

Wang Xian also fixed a price.

Cost of treatment would start from $2 million. No money? I’m sorry. Please leave.

The Divine Dragon Medical Hall is not a charity organization. No money, no cure.

Wang Xian was not a Virgin Mary that would treat any poor man who came along.

There were too many pitiful people around the world. If all of them need treatment, wouldn’t he be tired to death?

Hence, Wang Xian laid some ground rules.

1. Treatment fees start from $2 million. Subject to conditions.

2. No money, no cure.

3. Appointments need to be made in advance.

4. Open from 9 am to 5 pm daily.

These four rules, in his opinion, were not harsh at all. They were achievable.

Time passed by, and Wang Xian just shuffled between the restaurant and Divine Dragon Medical Hall every day.

The weather was rather hot these few days. Xiao Yu had been complaining to him how hot it was during their military training.

Seeing her getting darker each day, Wang Xian decided to find a chance to strengthen her body with the Dragon Energy.

With regards to his sister’s future, he had some struggles.

He wanted Xiao Yu to practice the Divine Dragon Transformation with him.

But Xiao Yu did not have the Divine Dragon bloodline.

Wang Xian could not possibly insert his blood essence into his sister.

If she did, she would be controlled by him. Then she would possess the mindset that she was under his command.

Naturally, he did not want his own sister to do that.

It was possible for her to practice Ancient Martial Arts. However, he did not have the methods.

What Mo Qinglong practiced was considered a devilish art. It was not suitable for Xiao Yu to practice.

Whereas Xue Family’s Art of Cultivation could only be practiced by the men.

Hence, he did not mention too much to Xiao Yu. After the Dragon Palace was built, there would be ways.

The Dragon Palace had a treasure known as the Dragon Evolution Fruit. After eating that, one could transform into a dragon.

When the time came, he would just need to ask his sister to take the fruit and that would do.

“Boss, all the things are ready. We can open for business tomorrow!” said Manager Huang after he checked on all the things in the medical hall on the fourth day.

“Okay, done.”

Wang Xian nodded.

All the renovation was completed. The medical hall was painted in green with wood furniture.

Green represents wood attributes. Hence, Wang Xian felt that this was a suitable color.

The entire room was very simple, with three beds and four chairs in the middle.

The second floor had the exact same layout with three beds.

“I have invited those who needed to be invited. Tomorrow, the medical hall will be officially opened!”

Wang Xian smiled. If the medical hall succeeded in the future, the revenue from the First-grade Restaurant could not hold a candle to the revenue of the medical hall.

The medical hall was opened for business the next morning. There was no stage or publicity.

Wang Xian put two wooden signs on both sides of the medical hall.

One said, “May the opening be a success.”

Another one had the Divine Dragon Medical Hall’s rules written on it.

The rules were what Wang Xian had set.

As a Divine Dragon Medical Hall, there must be some style in it.

The two signs before the entrance were very eye-catching.

The pedestrian traffic was huge on the old street. Some of them looked at the medical hall with curiosity. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Medical halls had almost disappeared in modern times. There were only pharmacies, healthcare services, and hospitals.

But an ancient medical hall was rarely seen.

Some of the people crowded around and looked at the ancient and plain-looking medical hall.

A curious old man walked closer and read the fascia board. He then swept his gaze at the signs near the entrance and got a shock on his face.

“What does it say? Treatment fees start from $2 million. Subject to conditions. No money, no cure. Appointments need to be made in advance. Open from 9 am to 5 pm daily. What kind of medical hall is this, with the cost of treatment that starts at $2 million? Nowadays, people are crazy about money. Is a deity the doctor? It’s so expensive!”
