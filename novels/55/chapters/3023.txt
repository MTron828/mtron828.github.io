Chapter 3024: 3023 killed his way out and intimidated the rest of the heroes

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The terrifying attack was directed downwards. The interior of the star let out a series of rumbling sounds.

The level eight divine emperor powerhouse from the brain spirit race was crushed without any resistance.

There was not a single scream.

There was no resistance either.

He was suppressed by a powerful force.

When Wang Xian saw this scene, a faint smile appeared on his face.

“Very good!”

With a wave of his arm, he kept the corpse away.

“Dragon King, Look over there!”

At this moment, the surprised voices of Heaven’s formation and the rest came from the side.

“Eh?”

Wang Xian looked over and his eyes immediately lit up.

This space was located in a blessed land. The entire area within a radius of 100 kilometers around the core of the star was hollow.

There was a kind of purple core flame rising inside.

In the core flame, there was a kind of purple flame flower.

The dense flame flower occupied most of the space.

“Purple swallow flower, a level eight divine emperor purple swallow flower. There are also many purple swallow flowers that have matured!”

Wang Xian looked at these divine flowers with a look of surprise in his eyes.

“As expected of a domain-level race. There are so many resources in just one planet!”

Ba Qi clicked his tongue and exclaimed in surprise.

“The brain spirit race also has billions of years of heritage. It’s not surprising to nurture some precious divine flowers. This is really a pleasant surprise!”

Tian Chen swept his gaze across and revealed a smile.

“Put it away. Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian was also full of smiles as he said to them.

“Dragon Palace, are these resources enough for you to upgrade?”

Ba Qi and the rest put away all the divine flowers and asked Wang Xian.

“It shouldn’t be enough!”

Wang Xian shook his head.

“Hehe, we have killed quite a number of experts during this period of time. We have also obtained quite a number of treasures from their interspatial rings. We should be able to upgrade you by killing a few more experts!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Ba Qi estimated.

“It’s possible!”

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly.

“I’ll get my men to investigate the situation of the brain spirit tribe and ancient rare tribe regarding their herb garden and resources!”

Ba Qi’s eyes flickered as he immediately sent a few messages.

“Let’s go. Let’s get rid of the brain spirit tribe experts on this planet First!”

Wang Xian opened his mouth and looked at an lie.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

An lie nodded and disappeared immediately.

This planet was one of the more important planets of the brain spirit race. There were more than 1,400 celestial thearch-level powerhouses on this planet.

After the celestial thearch-level-eight powerhouse was assassinated, the following actions were even simpler.

With the four celestial thearch-level-eight combat strength and the help of the poisonous horned dragon, it was easy to kill them.

In 20 minutes, all the Divine Emperors of the brain spirit race were killed.

“Done. Jie Jie Jie, let’s go to the ancient rare race!”

20 minutes later, Ba Qi said excitedly.

“Let’s Go!”

An lie and the others nodded and teleported away.

Soon, they came to an empty place. There was no continent or planet. Instead, there was a mountain in the void.

It was an incomparably huge mountain peak.

This was the domain of the ancient rare tribe!

“Dragon King, good news. Just now, I asked Mo Sha and the rest to search for some resources related to the ancient rare tribe. Mo Sha and the rest have really found a place!”

When they arrived at the void in front of the mountain peak, Ba Qi looked at the information on the universe’s AI and spoke.

“Oh?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows as his eyes sparkled.

“However, there is one thing. There are four level eight celestial thearch powerhouses there. We need to make a plan!”

Ba Qi said.

“Four level eight celestial thearch powerhouses?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly.

“It shouldn’t be a big problem. Ba Qi, Mark all the ancient rare tribe information on this mountain peak. Mo Sha is currently staying with a level seven celestial thearch ancient rare tribe powerhouse. He should know about the teleportation formation on this mountain peak. Usually, there will be a public teleportation formation and a secret teleportation formation. We can attack after destroying these two teleportation formations first.”

Heaven Array said.

“Alright, this demonic fiend should already know about it. In addition, Heaven Array, you’d better set up an array formation to conceal your aura and cover this huge mountain to prevent any accidents.”

Wang Xian said.

“Alright, Dragon King. We can assassinate the ancient rare race experts outside first. Then, we can deal with the four level eight divine emperors in the land of resources. With our strength, we can kill them.”

The sky array nodded.

“Alright, then we…”

The few of them immediately began to formulate a plan. Very quickly, a detailed plan was completed.

With Mo Sha and the rest of the Divine Emperors as spies, their actions were very simple.

After silently killing the divine emperors one by one, they cut off the teleportation array and immediately flew towards the peak of the mountain.

Located at the peak of the Giant Mountain was a place where the ancient rare earth tribe refined elixirs.

They refined elixirs using the peak spring and special yet powerful flames.

The ancient rare earth tribe was good at refining elixirs. This was a place where they refined elixirs.

And as a place where they refined elixirs, they naturally had a large number of elixirs and divine herbs.

“Heaven Formation, set up the formation!”

Wang Xian immediately ordered the heaven formation when he was near the peak of the mountain.

The Sky Formation nodded and immediately set up the formation.

Boom

The setting up of the sky formation immediately caused the world to tremble. A celestial thearch flew out and scanned his surroundings.

Whoosh! Whoosh

Puff

However, the moment the celestial thearch level eight flew out, Ba Qi turned into a black stream and drilled into his body.

The expression of the Type 8 divine emperor changed drastically, as he prepared to defend.

However, the sharp claws behind him entered his body, causing his body to stiffen.

Everything happened in an instant.

“Sou!”

Ba Qi latched onto the ancient rare race expert, fighting for control of his body.

Very quickly, his eyes flashed with a black light.

“Lao Bai, what’s the situation?”

At this moment, an old man flew over from the top of the mountain and shouted at him.

“I’ll go check the situation down there!”

Ba Qi immediately covered the spot where Ao Yao had penetrated and smeared a large amount of life force liquid on it. As he spoke, he directly flew down.

The old man on the mountain frowned and swept his gaze around.

“Boom!”

“Not good, someone is attacking!”

At this moment, Ba Qi’s parasitic body flew towards the mountain and he immediately shouted in alarm.

“Lao Bai!”

The old man on the mountain turned pale. When he saw the large amount of blood on Lao Bai’s body, his pupils constricted.

He stretched out his arm and directly caught Ba Qi.

“Pu!”

At this moment, the Ba Qi tore apart the parasitic body. The incomparably sharp black claw instantly pierced through the old man from the ancient rare tribe.

“Cough Cough!”

“How is this possible…”

The ancient rare tribe expert widened his eyes and was filled with astonishment.

“Buzz!”

At this moment, the formation of the Heaven Array enveloped the top of the mountain peak.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

Wang Xian and the rest flew over directly. There were also two level eight divine emperor powerhouses.
