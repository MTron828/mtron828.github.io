Chapter 865: 0866 wanted the Dragon King to be his mount

Translator: 549690339

“Ao Yao, what’s the difference between the current you and the past?”

Wang Xian stared at Ao Yao with a twinkle in his eyes. Other than the changes in his appearance, there would definitely be other changes as a light spike.

“Turn into light, Dragon King. The past me was material. But now, under the sunlight, I can temporarily enter a state of nothingness. I can maintain this state for one second. Furthermore, when I fight, my body is already in a state of concealment!”

As Ao Yao spoke, his body directly concealed itself in the void.

His arm moved, and a ray of light attacked the ground. When he attacked, his figure was still in a state of concealment.

In the past, once the strange demon launched an attack, its figure would be exposed. But now, there was no such problem at all. Even when attacking, it would conceal its figure.

This was very terrifying.

“However, in a battle, hiding is not perfect. If the opponent is of the dark attribute and is emitting demonic aura, it will make me appear. The other attributes can also see my body clearly!”

“When entering the state of nothingness, there is another supernatural ability, light penetration. It can penetrate and in an instant, it can obtain a terrifying penetrating power. It can almost ignore the defense!”

Ao Yao continued to speak to Wang Xian.

“It’s so abnormal?”

Wang Xian revealed a shocked expression.

An extraordinaire meant that he had mastered a supernatural ability. Usually, an extraordinaire who had just entered the state of extraordinaire would only be able to master one supernatural ability.

Ao Yao in the form of a strange demon had the ability of penetration. Compared to the penetration of light, there was still a huge gap between this ability and the penetration of light.

In addition, there was the state of nothingness. The most abnormal supernatural ability should be the state of nothingness.

At the instant of the assassination, if the opponent was alerted and counterattacked, the strange demon could enter the void state and directly ignore the opponent’s attack to carry out a second, even more terrifying assassination.

“The Ao Yao is already so powerful even though it is only in its incomplete form. If it has reached its complete form, wouldn’t it be even more perverse?”

Wang Xian looked at the Ao Yao and exclaimed in his heart.

Even for him, if he were to face an assassination attempt by Ao Yao, his life would be in danger.

However, once he was prepared, ao Yao would definitely not be his opponent.

He had just stepped into the first level of transcendence and already possessed eight supernatural powers. Now that Wang Xian was fighting, he did not know how strong he would be!

“...”.

“Hahaha, this is really rare. I didn’t expect that there would be experts of the transcendence level in such a small space on Earth. However, they are still too weak!”

At this moment, at the border of Huaxia, two middle-aged men and young men in luxurious armor stood in the air and laughed as they looked down at everyone in front of them.

“I, the ancient Emperor of the Sacred Glory Empire, hereby remind you that in two days, we will conquer this land in front of us. All the immortal sects will submit to us. Anyone who dares to resist will be killed!”

The middle-aged man swept his gaze across everyone in front of him. His body was emitting a terrifying aura as golden longswords spiraled above his head.

Under his feet, a golden hexagram disk was rotating. He was clad in battle armor and looked just like an ancient god!

In front of him, the grand elder of the Xuan Yuan clan was supporting a white-haired elder.

At this moment, the white-haired elder was spitting out blood. His face was extremely pale and his eyes were filled with fear.

Apart from them, there were also a group of immortal gods from the immortal sects. They looked at the two experts in front of them with terrified expressions.

“In two days, we will descend onto your land. At that time, we will kneel here to welcome our arrival. hahahaha!”

“Also, I heard that there is a dragon king in your China who can transform into a divine dragon. Tell him to come over and become our mount. Haha!”

The two laughed maniacally once again. Their bodies moved as they flew towards the west at a terrifying speed.

“So strong, so strong. In front of them, we are like ants!”

At the Wild Beast Immortal Gate, a golden lion spoke in human language. He looked at the two disappearing figures with a face full of fear. “Old Xuanyuan’s strength is already comparable to the godly king back then, but he was defeated in one move, one move!”

As he spoke, his body trembled slightly, and his voice was filled with powerlessness.

The surrounding immortal gods’eyes were also filled with intense fear. In one move, he had defeated the supreme expert of the Xuan Yuan clan who had never appeared.

This supreme expert of the Xuan Yuan clan possessed strength that was not weaker than the godly king, yet he was defeated so easily. He was so powerful that he was undefeatable.

“What should we do? Do We really have to be their subjects? Do We really have to listen to their commands and become their kings?”

The Great Hong Immortal Sect’s sect master said with an embarrassed expression.

If he said it well, he would be a subject. If he said it badly, he would be a slave. He would listen to his master’s words.

It wasn’t just them. Everyone in China had to be their slaves.

How could they be satisfied with this.

However, after seeing how powerful those two were, they had no way of resisting at all. It would be a piece of cake for them to kill their own people.

“He even dared to call the Dragon King to be their mount. I’m afraid...”

Everyone’s faces were filled with despair.

When the news of the return of the ancient gods from the west reached the east, the immortals and gods did not take it to heart.

However, in just ten days, that group of ancient gods had established the sacred glory empire, shocking everyone in China.

Establish an empire? This was simply calling themselves kings and enslaving all living beings.

What made the immortal gods in China even more fearful was the strength of this group of ancient gods.

Today, two ancient gods had directly arrived. The Xuan Yuan clan’s experts, who were comparable to godly kings, had come out of the mountains, but they had been defeated in one move.

Their powerful strength made them feel powerless.

“I never thought that one day, I would actually have to submit to others!”

An immortal God’s face was filled with bitterness. He had just become an immortal God and had become a slave. This feeling made him very uncomfortable.

“Let’s find the Dragon King. The Dragon King should have some ideas!”

An immortal God hesitated for a moment before speaking.

“The Dragon King?”

An Immortal God from the Wild Beast Immortal sect shook his head bitterly. “The other party obviously knows the Dragon King’s strength. Otherwise, they wouldn’t dare to say that the Dragon King would be their mount!”

“The Dragon King hasn’t made a move. When the Dragon Palace destroyed the Nordic god King, the Dragon King didn’t make a move either. Just one of his subordinates killed the god King effortlessly. The Dragon King’s strength must be even stronger. Maybe...” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Feng Lingtian from the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect said.

“There are twelve gods who have returned from the ancient times. Only two of them came today. Obviously, they are not the strongest among them!”

A middle-aged immortal God interrupted Feng Lingtian and said with an embarrassed expression.

Feng Lingtian pursed his lips and fell silent. He knew that the Dragon King was invincible, but... After all, the other party was an ancient god.

One person could destroy the entire Huaxia Immortal sect. could his future brother-in-law do it?

Everyone was silent.

“Dragon King? Sigh, submit!”

At this moment, the heavily injured elder of the Xuanyuan clan sighed heavily and said in despair.

When the surrounding immortals heard this, their faces were filled with despair!
