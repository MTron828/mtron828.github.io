Every powerful peak race, every heaven origin destiny realm expert.

For their own race, for the calamity, many arrangements had been made.

A long time ago, a group of heaven origin destiny realm disciples with relatively good talent from their respective races had been brought to the special place they discovered to be nurtured.

The nine origin universe wasn’t something that the sword and magic universes could compare to.

The nine-origin universe had eight Heaven’s origin creatures.

This was already quite a lot in the universe.

After all, the number of Heaven’s origin creatures in each universe was limited. For example, in the nine-origin universe, there were nine Heaven’s origin creatures in the past.

Each attribute had one.

That was, metal, wood, water, fire, Earth, wind, thunder, light, and darkness, nine attributes.

In theory, it could give birth to dual, three, and five elemental heavenly fate, but that was only in theory.

At least in the history of the nine-origin universe, there hadn’t been any experts with such attributes.

The power of the nine-origin universe also made the heavenly fate experts of the nine-origin universe stronger, and they had more trump cards.

Long ago, a batch of disciples of the Phoenix clan had been taken away by the heavenly fate of the Phoenix clan to cultivate.

This batch of Phoenixes numbered over a thousand.

Now that they had returned, they were all at least level eight universe masters.

This was cultivated by the heavenly fate to deal with the upcoming calamity battle.

The calamity battle was an extremely terrifying battle.

Originally, this group of experts would return two billion years later before the calamity erupted.

But now, because of the appearance of the tree of chaos, they were all called back by the nine-origin universe’s Heavenly Yuan destinies.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Seventh Elder, the current Dragon King of the Dragon Palace should have inherited the entire divine dragon clan and has a large number of opportunities. ”

“Most importantly, in the starry universe, our experts can not enter, while in the nine-origin universe, the Dragon Palace has long been hiding. We don’t know where they are hiding. ”

“If they dare to appear, we can easily destroy them. ”

A Phoenix spoke to the flameflame Phoenix in the center.

Although the Phoenix who spoke was only the seventh elder of the Phoenix clan, his current strength was at the peak of the entire Phoenix clan.

Before he was taken away by the Heavenly Yuan creation realm experts of the Phoenix clan, he was already the seventh elder of the clan.

However, according to his strength, only a few Phoenix kings of the Phoenix clan could be compared to him.

“Humph, we used to be polite to the divine dragon clan, but now a small dragon palace dares to be so reckless. They dare to wantonly kill our Phoenix clan’s disciples. They are simply courting death. ”

The seventh elder said with a grim expression, his eyes full of killing intent.

“Seventh elder, if we meet the Dragon Palace in the future, we will definitely destroy them! ”

Some of the Phoenixes next to him said.

They knew that the seventh elder was so angry because a descendant of the seventh elder had died in the Dragon Palace.

However, regardless of the seventh elder’s anger, if they met the Dragon Palace in the future and found the nest of the Dragon Palace, they would definitely destroy it!

The group of Phoenixes flew quickly.

Soon, an extremely large and quiet place appeared in front of them.

The entire area, mountains, rivers, and forests, was extremely quiet.

All kinds of words were carved on the rocks.

Some white cranes were flying inside.

It was filled with the aura of books.

The sacred literature field.

The sacred literature field was said to be a learning field, but in reality, it was extremely large.

It was the Holy Land of countless cultivators from the saint lineage.

This place was also the base of the saint lineage.

This time, a group of disciples from peak races and all disciples at the Universe Knight level came here. It was also the decision of a group of heavenly creation stage Great Beings!

When they arrived, the other peak races had also arrived.

Apart from that, there were also countless disciples at the Universe Knight level.

They looked around with respect.

They were filled with respect as they looked at the numerous great beings.

This time, the number of great beings disciples gathered was unprecedented.

There were all beings above the universe knight level.

How many would there be?

Especially for pinnacle races, the number of universe Knight Disciples reached millions.

The other high-level races and even the middle-level races and independent cultivators numbered in the hundreds of millions.

However, the number of over a hundred million experts wasn’t too many!

After all, the creatures of the entire universe were too vast!

The disciples of the Phoenix race looked at the center and flew straight over.

In the center, the experts of the twelve peak races had already arrived.

The Water Phoenix King, Fire Phoenix King, and Golden Phoenix King of the Phoenix race were already there.

The leaders of the angel race, the skeleton race, and the Wizard race had also arrived in the surrounding areas!

After the powerful disciples of the Phoenix race arrived, they looked around and arrived at their respective positions!

The twelve peak races had gathered.

As time passed, more and more disciples above the venerable realm arrived.

A year later, almost all the powerful disciples arrived.

“Buzz, Buzz, Buzz! ”

At this moment, figures appeared in the sky above the sacred literature field.

Phoenixes, angels, Black Tortoise, and the Netherworld race.

Each of them had a vast power, and the Heavenly Yuan creation realm experts from all races appeared.

At this moment, all the disciples’ gazes landed on the eight figures.

“Greetings, Lord Tianyuan Creation. ”

“Greetings, Lord Tianyuan Creation. ”

All the disciples immediately knelt down when they saw the eight figures.

Especially the powerful disciples from the high-level and middle-level races.

They were extremely shocked when they saw the eight figures.

This was the first time they had seen an expert of Tianyuan creation since they were born.

An existence at this level was someone they had to look up to.

This was the true overlord of their entire universe!

They were also extremely shocked by the identities of these eight figures.

From the auras of these eight figures, they could also tell which faction these eight figures came from.

The disciples of many high-level races were still very shocked by the existence of the royal family who had the heavenly fate realm.

“Stand up. All the disciples above the venerable realm in the nine-origin universe have arrived, right?”

Wearing scholar’s clothes and carrying a brush and a scroll on his back, Saint Hetian glanced around and asked indifferently!

“Saint, except for the powerful disciples of the Dragon Palace, all the other powerful disciples have arrived. ”

An old man from the saint’s faction immediately answered respectfully. “Dragon Palace? The Divine Dragon Clan has risen again?”

When the Hetian Saint heard this name, a hint of surprise flashed across his eyes as he asked!

“Yes, Saint. The Dragon Palace is not weak now, but they had some conflicts with the Angel clan and the Phoenix clan, so they didn’t come. ”

The old man didn’t hide anything and continued to report.

The Heavenly Yuan creation realm powerhouses didn’t know about this..
