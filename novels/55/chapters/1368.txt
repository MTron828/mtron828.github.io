Chapter 1369: 1369, the Dongyuan dynasty that was scared shitless

Compared to the excited citizens of the dragon and Phoenix dynasty, they were standing on the side of the battlefield.

The 40-50,000 people who had escaped from the dragon and Phoenix dynasty and those who were about to surrender were completely dumbfounded.

They had never expected that the dragon and Phoenix dynasty, which only had one city, could actually destroy the three dynasties.

These were the three great dynasties, and two of the kings had personally led their troops into battle.

There were more than forty insightful void martial artists in total, yet such power was still defeated.

This...

They could already imagine that not long from now, the dragon-phoenix Empire would rise powerfully and even take over all the cities of the three great dynasties.

At that time, the dragon-phoenix Empire would become the most powerful dynasty in the nearby domain.

As a citizen of a powerful dynasty, there were naturally many benefits.

Not to mention, the benefits within the dragon-phoenix dynasty were much better than in many places.

“If we knew that Lord Wang had such powerful strength, we wouldn’t have come out. We regret it!”

“Her Majesty the Queen obviously opened the city gates on purpose to let us leave. She knew... She knew...”

Regret appeared in their minds. Forty to fifty thousand people stood there in a daze, their faces filled with regret.

Looking at the battlefield that had already turned into a river of blood, all of their faces were extremely pale.

“Star Moon King, go to Hell!”

At this moment, in the sky that was covered by flames, Feng Luan’s cold voice sounded.

“If you want to kill me, you’ll have to pay a heavy price too!”

In front of him, the Star Moon King was in an extremely sorry state. His long golden hair was disheveled and his body was charred black.

He stared at Feng Luan with a somewhat pale face and roared ferociously.

The Star Moon King never expected that he was actually not a match for the Dragon Phoenix Queen.

The other party’s terrifying flame control caused him to suffer quite a bit.

Seeing that the Dragon Phoenix Queen was about to unleash her strongest attack, he tightly held onto his scepter.

“Twinkle, Twinkle. Flaming Starlight. I want to see who will kill who today!”

He swept his gaze below and fearfully looked at the terrifying millstone at the side. He swore to fight to the death as he roared.

“Phoenix Cry, Hundred Fire Phoenix!”

The Phoenix staff in Feng Luan’s hand was raised towards the sky. In the surroundings, densely packed flames condensed.

A phoenix that was over two thousand meters in size condensed in the void. It flapped its enormous wings and attacked the star Moon King’s Flaming Starlight.

The Fiery Starlight was located behind the star-moon king, condensing into a pattern of the fiery starry sky.

When the hundred-fire Phoenix rushed over, it was like the world-extinguishing fire Phoenix, destroying the fiery starry sky.

“AH, no!”

When the world-extinguishing fire Phoenix swallowed the starry sky, it continued to swallow the star-moon king.

“If you dare to kill me, Our Howling Wind Dynasty won’t let you go. Our king won’t Let You Heaven’s Eye Demon Beasts Go!”

At this moment, not far from the side.

Mou Zesen’s long and slender arm, which was covered in dragon scales, grabbed the howling wind dynasty lord’s arm.

“Die!”The Howling Wind dynasty Lord’s face was flushed red as he roared in terror.

“Die!”

However, Mou Zesen’s cold eyes did not have the slightest ripple as he exerted force with his palm.

Crack! Crack

The sound of breaking could be heard.

The Star Moon King and the Howling Wind Dynasty’s rank 4 void interpretation experts had fallen one after another!

“No, we surrender. Don’t Kill Us!”

“I surrender, I surrender!”

When the two kings and the Howling Wind Dynasty’s king had died completely.

Below, the soldiers of the three dynasties’armies had completely collapsed.

One by one, the soldiers threw away the weapons in their hands in fear and shouted loudly.

Some of them even knelt on the ground and started begging for mercy.

They looked at the densely packed corpses around them and their faces were extremely pale.

Every single one of them was trembling.

They had completely given up on resisting.

The current 400,000 strong army had less than 100,000 soldiers.

Some of the soldiers of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire saw them surrendering and stopped their attacks.

However, the members of the Dragon Palace did not stop. They would not stop without Wang Xian’s order. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Even if the other party gave up resisting, they continued to kill rapidly.

This caused the soldiers of the dragon and Phoenix Empire to hesitate.

“There are no captives. Kill them all!”

Feng Luan floated in the sky. Her cold eyes stared downwards as she made her final judgment.

Kill, kill them all!

Not a single one of the 400,000 strong army was left alive!

As the former empress, Feng Luan had witnessed too many massacres.

In a war, there was only killing and being killed!

If there were no Wang Xian today, what would happen to the dragon-phoenix Empire?

As they said, all the men were killed, and all the women became slaves.

Everyone was very clear about the fate of slaves!

“Kill! They are here to kill us and make us women slaves. Similarly, we will not spare a single one!”

“Not a single one alive!”

Hearing the Queen’s Order, a general roared with a ferocious expression.

All the soldiers agreed and the killing continued.

Blood flowed like a river.

400,000 corpses fell to the ground. The entire scene was spectacular.

However, the citizens of the dragon and Phoenix dynasty were not afraid.

In this world, monsters would usually attack cities with hundreds of thousands or even millions of corpses.

They didn’t feel uncomfortable about this at all.

All the citizens looked at the soldiers below as if they were looking at a hero.

The soldiers didn’t hesitate to kill the enemy either. This was their meritorious service.

Although this war was mainly dependent on Lord Wang and his subordinates, they were still able to survive.

Screams of pain rang out. The remaining less than 100,000 people were quickly killed.

“Feng, I’ll take these corpses away. They’re useful!”

When the last scream ended, Wang Xian looked at Feng Luan and said to her.

“Of course. Clean Up the battlefield. We’ll prepare for the next plan!”

Feng Luan smiled and nodded at Wang Xian.

“Reporting to your majesty. In this battle, our dragon and Phoenix dynasty only lost more than 50 people. If we kill the enemy... if we kill the enemy, it’s all thanks to Sir Wang’s subordinates!”

A group of generals flew over excitedly and reported to Feng Luan.

As they spoke, they looked at Wang Xian with respect and admiration in their eyes.

If Wang Xian and the Dragon Palace were not here, the Dragon-phoenix dynasty would definitely be destroyed.

It was also because of the powerful subordinates of the Dragon Palace that they had only lost more than 50 people.

Otherwise, if they were to lose more than 10,000 people in a battle, it would be a complete victory!

Not to mention that there were only 50 people!

As for killing the enemy, they would just follow behind and add on the damage. They didn’t dare to talk about killing the enemy!

“General of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, thank you, Sir Wang!”

Yu Cheng, Mang Hong and the rest exchanged glances and bowed to Wang Xian to express their gratitude.

“General of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, thank you, Sir Wang!”

“All the citizens of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, thank you, Sir Wang!”

“Thank you, Lord Wang!”

All the soldiers of the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty bowed and thanked him. Following that, all the people of the dragon and Phoenix dynasty bowed deeply and thanked him loudly.
