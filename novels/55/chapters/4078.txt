Translator: 549690339

Wang Xian and the rest were in the middle of the Sea of fire. They flew straight towards the center.

The closer they got to the center, the more terrifying the temperature became.

Both Wang Xian and Lin Niu possessed the fire attribute. Hence, they had a higher resistance to the fire attribute!

However, before Wang Xian and the rest could get close to the center, a violent sound suddenly came from the center!

When Wang Xian and the rest heard the sound, they were slightly stunned. A hint of shock appeared on their faces!

Boom! Boom! Boom

Boom! Boom

In the next moment, Wang Xian could feel the flames around him starting to become violent. They attacked Wang Xian and the rest directly.

Countless Flames came charging at them with a might that could threaten them!

“Boss, be careful! ”

Lin Niu’s expression changed drastically when he saw this scene. He immediately shouted at Wang Xian! “Boom! ”

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly. His body trembled as he activated the nine attributes in his body. All of them were converted into the fire attribute.

Terrifying Flames erupted from his entire body.

The power of the flames covered the area around him. A Ray of light bloomed from Lin Niu’s single horn. It enveloped him completely and was prepared to take the attack head-on.

Without seeing their opponent, they didn’t dare to launch an attack rashly!

Boom

However, what surprised Wang Xian the next second was that.

The flames that were attacking him suddenly stopped and attacked the unicorn!

When Wang Xian saw this scene, he was slightly stunned!

On the other hand, the unicorn was covered in flames.

The powerful attack force caused him to fly backward!

Lin Niu let out a low roar. His gaze swept over Wang Xian’s side and he revealed a stunned expression.

“Boss, why aren’t you being attacked? Why am I the only one being attacked?”

Lin Niu shouted loudly! “Boom! Boom! Boom!”

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Just as he finished his sentence, countless flames started to brew in the surrounding area. The even more terrifying flames were aimed at Lin Niu.

Wang Xian, who was standing at the side, felt that the surrounding flames were extremely gentle!

“Boss, the attack of these flames is too fierce! ”

When the Linniu saw this scene, his expression changed again as he shouted at Wang Xian.

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered slightly as well.

Why did this sea of Flames only attack the Linniu and not him?

“Could it be because I have the fire attribute?”

Wang Xian thought to himself. He looked at the linniu and said, “Linniu, show me your fire attribute. ”

“Fire attribute?”

When the Linniu heard Wang Xian’s words, his heart skipped a beat. Waves of fire energy burst out from his body.

The Linniu had the fire attribute, the Thunder attribute and the darkness attribute.

His three attributes were not a perfect combination.

The reason why he could have three attributes was due to his physique.

His unique physique allowed him to possess the abilities of three attributes.

It was different from what Wang Xian possessed.

Terrifying Flames erupted from the body of the unicorn ox as it charged towards the surrounding flames!

Boom! Boom! Boom

Boom! Boom

However, the surrounding flames did not stop attacking because of the flames that erupted from the body of the Unicorn Ox. Instead, they continued to cover

the Sky and earth!

When Wang Xian saw this scene, he frowned slightly.

What was going on? Was it not working?

(‘F * ck!”

When the LINNIU saw that the flames were still attacking him, he could not help but let out a low growl!

He quickly defended himself!

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom

Boom! Boom! Boom

The terrifying collision began!

At this moment, Wang Xian could feel that the temperature on this side was increasing rapidly.

He could feel a terrifying fire energy approaching from the center.

He focused his gaze.

The unicorn ox also sensed something. It looked at Wang Xian and said,

“Unicorn Ox, hide first!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and a wave of energy enveloped the unicorn ox.

The unicorn ox did not resist. Wang Xian kept it into the mother nest!

The next moment, when the unicorn ox disappeared, the Sea of fire around it stopped boiling!

It gradually regained its calmness once again!

Wang Xian floated there quietly and looked to the right.

That was the center of the Sea of fire.

He could sense that a powerful flame was approaching.

Wang Xian didn’t Dodge immediately.

The attack just now was obviously controlled by this flame. He wasn ‘t attacked. It must have triggered some special reason.

At that moment, he saw a white spark appear in his line of sight.

It was a flame that contained incomparable purity and brilliance.

White, a pale white spark!

In this world of fire, it was abnormally dazzling.

This white spark was like a real flower, extremely beautiful!

But it contained an incomparably enormous power of fire.

It seemed to be able to burn everything.

The surrounding chaotic space had been burned into a domain by it.

This white flame flower was only a hundred meters in size, but it was extremely dangerous!

“This flame flower is probably able to burn the fate of the Heaven’s origin!

His eyes were filled with vigilance.

If anything bad happened, he would be prepared to escape at any time!

This flame flower was very, very strong.

The white flame flower didn’t seem to have any intelligence. It stopped right before Wang Xian.

It seemed to have sensed that the intruder had disappeared!

Then, it continued to fly forward.

Wang Xian looked at this flame flower and sized it up carefully. Then, he followed at the side!

The flame flower treated Wang Xian as if he didn ‘t exist and continued to wreak havoc.

It bloomed.

Wang Xian flew along for a period of time. His body moved and his huge body swayed as he flew towards the back of the flame flower.

After two days, he observed the entire territory covered by the flame flower.

The entire territory was huge and vast!

However, there was nothing substantial in this territory.

The only treasure in the entire Sea of fire territory was the white flame flower. This flame flower had no intelligence and was flying aimlessly.

“If I can subdue and use this flame flower, it would be amazing!”

Wang Xian thought to himself.

However, this kind of object that had no consciousness and was releasing an unparalleled power in its original form. If he wanted to subdue it, he would have to use a powerful force to subdue it!

Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to subdue it at all!

“With my current strength, even if I add the Lin Bull, I wouldn’t be able to subdue it. Moreover, even if I subdue it, how would I be able to control it?”

Wang Xian frowned. He couldn’t handle this white flame flower!

It was too terrifying!

An object born in the chaos was really shocking!

“I can ask the Queen elf. She should know more! ”

Wang Xian thought for a moment and took out a communication device.

This was the communication device between the few of them.

Through this communication device, they could communicate with each other in the chaos as long as it wasn’t too far away!
