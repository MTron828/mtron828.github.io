“Bang!”

The huge axe emitted a thick, earthy yellow glow as it hacked heavily at Wang Xian’s body.

However, what shocked everyone was that another golden longsword was used to block the huge axe, causing everyone’s expression to change slightly.

“Another transcendent-level-7 powerhouse?”

“Hiss, it can’t be. This... There are actually two transcendent-level-7 powerhouses guarding him!”

The surrounding students of the Demon Hunters Academy looked at this scene in shock. Their faces were also slightly embarrassed.

The more powerhouses that appeared beside Wang Xian, the more time they wasted.

Zhang Fengying revealed a surprised expression. Her gaze was fixed on the golden swordfish that was defending against the two transcendent level seven powerhouses.

Her ocular arts had a very powerful ability to see through a person’s strength.

She was almost certain that before parting with Wang Xian and the rest, the Golden Swordfish’s combat strength was only at level six of the supernatural realm. There might be one that she didn’t notice, but now there was another one?

How was this possible?

“Continue!”

Wang Xian stared at snake mark with a mocking expression and said with a smile.

“What?”

Snake Mark’s face was filled with astonishment. His expression slowly turned ugly. He stared at Wang Xian coldly and gritted his teeth.

“Go to hell! How dare you be so arrogant after killing our young master!”

This time, he didn’t have to say anything. The remaining two experts from the Yun family, who were at transcendent level seven, attacked Wang Xian.

The two of them, one with a saber and one with a sword, unleashed their best attacks and slashed at Wang Xian.

“Bang! Bang!”

At the same time, two sounds of collision rang out again. Beside Wang Xian, the two golden swordfish once again blocked the attacks of the two experts from the Yun family.

“Continue!”

Wang Xian looked at snake mark calmly and said to him.

Gulp

Snake mark couldn’t help but swallow a mouthful of saliva. He had a bad premonition in his heart.

The pupils of the four experts from the Yun family, who were at transcendent level seven, contracted slightly.

They didn’t expect that there were four experts at transcendent level seven beside Wang Xian. This was completely out of their expectations.

The students of the Demon Hunters Academy behind him also shut their mouths. Their eyes were wide open and their faces were filled with shock.

Their eyes flickered and they didn’t speak again.

Even the few level seven supernatural realm experts from before didn’t speak.

Continue?

Wang Xian spoke to them. Snake Scar looked at the other three middle-aged men and the old man beside him.

“Kill them all!”

He roared with a slightly ferocious expression.

The remaining three transcendent-level rank-7 powerhouses didn’t hesitate at all. They attacked Wang Xian with the weapons in their hands.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

This time, they were still blocked. They were easily blocked.

“You... how is this possible?”

She Hen growled in a low voice. His face was filled with disbelief.

Seven underlings, seven underlings of a level seven extraordinary. How was this possible?

In the entire Donghai City, there were not many forces that could send out seven level seven extraordinary individuals.

“Is there more?”

Wang Xian raised his head slightly and stared at snake mark. He asked with a smile on his face.

“Cough, cough, cough!”

His eyes flickered as he stared at Wang Xian. He looked at the four golden swordfish beside him who had yet to make a move. He had a bad thought in his heart.

Could the other four be as well?

He didn’t dare to imagine it.

The students of the demon hunters academy behind him also realized this. All of them widened their eyes. Obviously, they had realized this as well.

There were still four people beside Wang Xian who had yet to make a move!

“If not, it’s my turn!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

Beside him, the longswords in the hands of the other four golden swordfish that didn’t make a move were emitting a faint golden glow.

“Wait, the wind-winged savage fish is coming soon. We...”

Snake mark sensed the faint threat from the other four Golden Swordfish and shouted in a hurry.

“There’s no rush. Let’s talk after I kill all of you!”

Wang Xian stared at them mockingly.

“Boom!”

In an instant, all the Golden Swordfish started to move. With terrifying strength and a powerful level seven extraordinary strength, they attacked Snake Scar and the rest.

“Dodge, Dodge!”

“Oh my God, 11 level seven extraordinary experts, this...”

“It’s over, it’s over. Who would have thought that there were 11 level seven extraordinary experts beside this freshman? There are four more than captain snake and the rest!”

Behind them, when the students saw the sudden outbreak of battle, they hurriedly dodged to the side.

Their faces were all extremely unsightly.

At this time, if a sudden outbreak of battle occurred, what would happen if the demon beasts and fierce beasts of the winged savage fish and the others chased after them?

Everyone’s faces revealed anxious expressions.

“Commander Zhang, Commander Xia Hou, let’s escape first!”

A young man could not help but say to Zhang Yitian and Xia houming.

However, the two of them did not move at all. They looked at the sudden outbreak of the battle in shock.

This made their faces extremely ugly. They could not leave, nor could they stay here.

With their strength, if they were to leave alone and were discovered by the demonic beasts, they would definitely be killed.

“Kill, Kill!” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Snake Mark’s face was filled with fear. He roared and the ten or so rank 6 transcendents behind him braced themselves and charged forward.

“Ah!”

However, just as one of the rank 6 transcendents charged forward, a golden swordfish pierced through his chest and let out a blood-curdling scream.

Snake mark could not help but retreat, his eyes looking like they were about to split open.

He had never expected that a prey that was like a lab rat in his eyes would burst out with such terrifying strength.

Even he might die here.

This caused him to be filled with fear.

“Ahhhhh!”

However, after only ten seconds, three more blood-curdling screams were heard.

A Level 6 transcendent was no match for a level 7 transcendent.

Furthermore, there were eleven level 7 transcendent experts.

“Merciless stab the heart!”

The Golden Swordfish let out a low growl and instantly cast their divine abilities in unison, attacking Snake Scar and the others.

“Axe Shield!”

“Dark slash!”

The eleven level 7 transcendent experts suddenly cast their divine abilities in unison, causing everyone’s expressions to change drastically. They hurriedly resisted.

“A unified divine ability. Could it be that they are cultivating a unified sword dao inheritance?”

Behind them, a rank seven extraordinary expert revealed a shocked expression when he saw the eleven golden swordfish using the same divine ability.

Assassin inheritance, Sword Dao inheritance, saber art inheritance...

This meant that cultivating a fixed divine ability at every stage was far more difficult for cultivators than ordinary cultivators.

However, once they cultivated a complete inheritance, their strength would be much stronger.

The Golden Swordfish had the bloodline of the Divine Dragon and cultivated the Golden Dragon transformation.

The Golden Dragon Transformation was equivalent to a complete inheritance, allowing them to comprehend the unity of the Divine Dragon.

Whether it was attack power or destructive power, they were all at the peak.

This was also one of the conditions for the golden swordfish to be able to fight above its level.
