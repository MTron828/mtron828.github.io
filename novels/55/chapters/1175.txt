Chapter 1176: On target 1177’s tomb

Translator: 5496903

“What?”

When Wang Xian made his move, it took less than a second for him to finish it.

The other seven young men from the six element sect had just reacted when they saw Xing Tian 1 landing heavily on the ground not far away and spitting out blood.

As for the Thunder leopard under his crotch, it fell to the ground without any signs of life.

All of them had shocked expressions on their faces.

Everyone around them gasped when they saw this scene.

“What powerful strength!”

“Hiss, he killed the Hulei leopard who was at level nine of the extraordinaire in an instant and severely injured the proud son of a level nine extraordinaire. His strength is so strong!”

There were at least tens of thousands of people gathered around the auction house. They looked at Wang Xian with fear in their eyes.

“He should be at the half-step void interpretation realm. He is so young and already has such great strength. He is considered a favored son of the heavens in the flowing sea region. I wonder if he can be ranked in the top ten!”

In a restaurant beside the street, an old man in white stroked his beard and said with admiration in his eyes.

“Top Ten? How can such an elite young man be in a small dragon-phoenix Empire? Master, is he a bloodline cultivator or an ordinary cultivator?”

At the side, a man and a woman looked at Wang Xian and asked the old man.

“Judging from his Qi and blood, he should be a bloodline cultivator. I just don’t know what bloodline he has!”

The old man said with a smile.

“Oh? So he’s a bloodline cultivator!”

When the man and woman heard the middle-aged man’s words, they shook their heads slowly and didn’t take him seriously.

“Hehe!”

The old man also smiled faintly and looked away.

The Orthodox cultivators instinctively looked down on bloodline cultivators.

Bloodline cultivators had the limitations of their bloodlines. Once they reached the peak of their bloodlines, they would not be able to make any progress in the future.

However, for the truly blessed and ambitious experts, bloodlines were only the path chosen by the weak.

The truly powerful ones would choose an endless great dao, and only this path would allow them to stand at the peak of the extraordinary continent.

Furthermore, in the current flowing sea region, the highest level of bloodline was the fourth level of the profound void tier.

As for those with higher bloodlines, there were none.

Although the fourth level of the profound void tier was strong, it wasn’t very high for those talented and ambitious experts.

Therefore, they instinctively disdained bloodline cultivators.

Bloodline Heaven’s favorites could not be called Heaven’s favorites.

“How dare you attack the disciples of our six element sect? I think you are courting death!”

The other seven young men from the six element sect reacted and quickly walked to Xing Tianyi’s side. Their eyes were filled with killing intent as they stared at Wang Xian.

“A place has its own rules. In the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, you have to abide by the rules of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire. You will not be able to trample on you just because you are the six element sect!”

Wang Xian stared coldly at the young men from the six elements sect.

“Young master Wang!”

“Young master Wang!”

At this moment, soldiers flew over one by one. Among them were two generals who were at the half-step void interpretation level.

They greeted Wang Xian respectfully when they saw him.

Although Wang Xian didn’t have any position in the dragon and Phoenix Empire, everyone knew that he had a close relationship with their queen.

Even Mang Hong, Yan Wenshan and the rest had to address him as young master respectfully.

“Throw them out!”

Wang Xian nodded and said to the soldiers.

“It’s young master Wang!”

More than ten soldiers nodded and stared coldly at the eight people from the six elements sect.

“Are we going to throw you out, or are you going to leave by yourselves?”

A general stared at them and said expressionlessly.

“Dragon-phoenix dynasty, good, very good!”

The eight youths from the six element sect had extremely ugly expressions. They had come all the way here to buy some weapons and medicinal pills.

In the end, they were directly chased out, wasting half a month of their time.

This caused their expressions to be extremely ugly.

Especially since the other party didn’t give the six element sect any face, it made them even angrier.

Being stared at by the experts from the Dragon and Phoenix Army, the eight people from the six elements sect looked extremely embarrassed.

They helped Xing Tianyi up and sat on the Spirit Beast. Then, they headed out with a gloomy face.

“If they want to be punished according to the rules of the city, if they don’t accept the punishment, they can leave!”

Wang Xian turned to look at the five people from the Fang clan and said with a calm face.

When the five young men from the Fang clan saw the eight people from the six elements sect being chased out, their expressions changed slightly.

They did not expect that a small dragon-phoenix Empire would actually dare to chase out the disciples of the six elements sect.

This was the powerful six elements sect. Although they were not the core disciples, they still represented the six elements sect!

“Haha, this brother is really amazing. We will accept the punishment. These ten drops of spiritual liquid will be the price we have to pay for our recklessness in the dragon-phoenix Empire!”

A young man standing in the middle suddenly laughed out loud. With a wave of his arm, the ten drops of spiritual liquid flew into Wang Xian’s hands. As he spoke, he cupped his hands at the soldiers.

“I hope everyone can abide by the rules of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire. Although the dragon and Phoenix Empire is small, it is definitely not something that can be trampled on by just anyone!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly and gestured to the soldiers.

“Of course!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The young man from the Fang clan nodded his head with a smile.

After the group of soldiers left, the five young men from the Fang clan also left with smiles on their faces.

Although the Dragon and Phoenix Empire did not give face to the Fang clan, the eight people from the six elements sect were in an even worse state.

When they thought of the eight of them, the five people from the Fang clan laughed instead.

“Brother-in-law is still the best!”

“Sir!”

Feng Lingtian and Liu Qing walked over and said to him in a fawning manner.

“Alright, cultivate well. In the future, none of you need to be afraid!”

Wang Xian said to Feng Lingtian with a smile.

“Don’t worry, brother-in-law. I cultivate all night every night. It Won’t be long before I can become a powerhouse that can shake the entire region!”

Feng Lingtian said confidently.

“Alright, you guys can continue your patrol!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile. He looked at the spiritual liquid in his hand and his eyes sparkled.

“Alright, brother-in-law!”

Feng Lingtian left with a smile.

“Lord Wang is still so domineering. Hehe, no matter what your identity is, you have to abide by the rules here when you come to our dragon and Phoenix Empire!”

“Lord Wang rarely appears in the city during this period of time. I don’t know what he is doing. It would be great if Lord Wang could become a high-ranking official in our dragon and Phoenix Empire!”

In the surroundings, some citizens of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire looked at Wang Xian’s figure and spoke respectfully.

Some people from other countries sized up Wang Xian in astonishment.

To possess such strength at such a young age was extremely rare even in their country.

At this moment, Wang Xian looked at the spiritual liquid in his hand and made a decision in his heart.

Spiritual Liquid: 700 dragon crystals can be extracted from Dragon Energy

This drop of spiritual liquid was equivalent to swallowing an extraordinary level seven aquatic creature!

It was equivalent to the dragon Spike accepting a mission to assassinate an extraordinary level five powerhouse!

Now that he needed more than 100 million dragon crystals to level up, the spiritual liquid was a good choice!
