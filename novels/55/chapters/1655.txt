Chapter 1656: In the 1656 Arena Battle of Life and death

“This is the lava lake in volcano city. The lava is very mild!”

“The center is the podium. How is it? Isn’t It Beautiful?”

In volcano city, Wang Xian was strolling around the city with Huo Luo'er.

The Little Loli brought him to the scenic spots in volcano city and bought him some special food.

It was obvious that the host was entertaining the guests.

Wang Xian followed the little loli around with great interest.

“Princess, a group of Heaven’s favorites from the Sacred Flame clan sent me to look for you. They said that they have something important to discuss with you!”

Just as Wang Xian and Huo Luo'er were strolling around the city for more than two hours, a young man suddenly walked over and said to Huo Luo'er.

“HMM? What’s the matter?”

Huo Luo'er frowned slightly and asked the young man.

“Princess, it should have happened yesterday!”

The young man also frowned slightly and replied.

“Don’t tell me they really want to set up an arena in the fire cloud forest?”

Huo Luo'er’s expression was a little ugly and angry.

“Set up an arena? What’s going on?”

Wang Xian heard their words and asked curiously.

“Big Brother Wang Xian, yesterday, we met a group of Heaven’s pride disciples from the life and Death Elixir Workshop and the Saint Item Forging Workshop on the battlefield. At that time, the strength of both parties were about the same. The Sacred Fire clan was unwilling to make a move at that time!”

“Apparently, the other party was also a little afraid of the Sacred Fire clan and didn’t make a move. After that, they said a few words about putting up an arena for the life and death battle. I didn’t expect them to really put up an arena on the battlefield!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“I can see that they are not here to help us with their full strength. They are here to test themselves and gain fame!”

Huo Luo'er said with a displeased expression.

“Setting up a life-and-death arena?”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned when he heard Huo Luo'er’s displeasure. He shook his head in amusement.

A life-and-death arena was set up for a fight between two superpowers.

It was child’s play. However, if it was a life-and-death battle, it was acceptable.

“Brother Wang Xian, let’s go and take a look!”

Huo Luo'er said as she held Wang Xian’s arm and gestured to the young man.

The two of them came to a luxurious manor. When they entered, they saw about 1,000 young men from the sacred flame clan gathered together and conversing.

“Princess Huo Luo'er, you’re here!”

Seeing Huo Luo'er’s arrival, lie Hanshan and the other youths immediately walked over with smiles on their faces.

“Lie Hanshan, why did you call me here?”

Huo Luo'er asked them with a smile.

“Regarding the battle, we’ve already made an agreement with the life and Death Pill workshop and the Sacred Item Forging Workshop’s Jiang Xingkong, life and death pill workshop’s Shui Lian Yi, Shui Lian Hun, and the others to have a life and death battle in the Arena!”

“Those under the age of 100 can enter the arena and fight to the death. How about it? Call on the elites of your fire cloud sparrow clan and we will kill their prestige together!”

Lie Hanshan said to Huo Luo'er with a smile on his face.

“That’s not too good!”

Huo Luo'er frowned slightly and said.

“How is it not too good? In the arena, a life and death battle can show their true strength!”

Lie Hanshan said confidently.

“That’s right. If we annihilate breeze, it will also be a big blow to their morale!”

Some of the Sacred Fire clan’s youths in the surroundings echoed.

When their sacred fire clan came here, everyone was very clear that they would leave after half a year.

However, they still had to participate in the war.

Now that the arena was being held, not only would they be able to perfunctorily deal with the war, they would also be able to make a name for themselves after killing the enemy.

It was killing two birds with one stone.

“We have already told the elders of your fire cloud sparrow clan about this matter. They have agreed to this matter!”

“For this arena battle, Our Holy Fire clan will set up the formation at the side. Huo Luo'er, you can call on the heaven’s favorites of Your Fire Cloud Sparrow clan!”

“Killing the enemy on the arena is also killing the enemy!”

At this moment, an old man walked over. His gaze paused on Wang Xian for a moment before he spoke.

He had a deep impression of Wang Xian. When they first entered the territory of the Fire Cloud Sparrow tribe, the fire cloud sparrow tribe directly ignored them. Instead, they received a young man.

Later on, based on their guesses, the fire cloud sparrow tribe deliberately humiliated them. This was their dissatisfaction.

This made them slightly angry.

However, they didn’t say anything. This matter was their sacred fire clan’s fault.

However, they had already decided that they could leave directly after passing through the half a year’s time that the Patriarch had mentioned.

This time, they would treat the arena as training for their sacred fire clan’s disciples.

“Alright, then I’ll Inform Our Fire Cloud Sparrow clan’s heaven’s chosen experts when the arena battle will begin!”

Huo Luo'er could only nod her head and ask.

“Tomorrow, we’ve already agreed on a time. Tomorrow’s Battle!”

Lie Hanshan looked at Huo Luo'er. “Tomorrow, I’ll let sister Huo Luo'er see my true strength!”

“We also want to see the strength of the life and Death Pill workshop and the Saint Item Forging Workshop’s Heaven’s pride expert!”

Around them, some of the sacred fire clan’s youths said proudly.

As the family of the founding general of an empire, they would definitely enter the army.

If they could become famous on this battlefield, it would be an honor for them.

“Yes, I believe that lie Hanshan will be able to massacre everyone!”

Huo Luo'er nodded at him and left with Wang Xian.

“Princess, do you want me to inform all the heaven’s favorites in our younger generation?”

After walking out of the manor, the young man who followed them said to Huo Luo'er.

“Tell brother Xu Xingcan and brother Huo Mingtu about this matter. They will organize it!”

Huo Luo'er instructed the young man.

“Yes, Princess. I will inform the two young masters immediately!”

The young man nodded and walked in another direction immediately.

“Sister Huo Luo'er, are you going to participate in the Arena Battle Tomorrow?”

Wang Xian looked at Huo Luo'er who had matured a little earlier and asked.

Compared to the naive and ignorant Huo Luo'er from three years ago, she had changed too much.

Perhaps it was because of this battle that she matured a lot earlier.

“Of course, I have to go and kill the enemy as well. I’m a powerhouse at the second level of the void interpretation stage now. Very few people of the same level are my match!”

Huo Luo'er said with determination in her eyes, “My two brothers were killed in this war. I want to avenge them!”

Wang Xian looked at her determined expression. When he heard her words, his heart was slightly moved.

He didn’t expect that the two sons of the fire lark queen had actually died in this war.

“Little sister Huo Luo'er, come, follow me!”

Wang Xian patted her head and brought her to his residence.

“Eh? Brother Wang Xian, why are you bringing me there?”

Huo Luo'er looked at him and asked curiously.

“To help you improve your strength. You are still too weak at the second level of the Void Interpretation Stage!”

Wang Xian said faintly.
