Chapter 1150: 11

Translator: 5496903

In the city Lord’s mansion, the old man in charge of the undercurrent in Bright Moon City was monitoring the array formation with a cold expression in his eyes.

From the monitoring of the array formation, they could see the hidden traces of the dragon spike, which eventually entered an ordinary courtyard.

They even saw a white light appear behind Sha Thirteen, directly killing him and putting his corpse into his interspatial ring.

“Hehe, with our city Lord’s manor assisting you, there shouldn’t be any problems with this dragon spike, right?”

Beside the old man, a middle-aged man wearing the city guard leader’s armor smiled at him and asked.

“Don’t worry, a dragon Spike wants to challenge our undercurrent assassin organization. This time, we’ll let them know the consequences!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The Old Man’s face was gloomy as he coldly said.

“This dragon spike is not simple either. There might be an even stronger existence that can assassinate your ace Assassin!”

The city guard leader said slowly.

“Don’t worry, our leader Will Come Tomorrow!”

The old man said in a deep voice. After saying that, he directly walked out.

Speaking of the undercurrent leader, the city guard leader was also slightly silent.

The Master of undercurrent was a very extreme madman.

When he had not established the undercurrent assassin organization, his reputation had already spread far and wide.

In fact, as the leader of an assassin organization, the leader of undercurrent was not as mysterious as other people thought.

On the contrary, many people knew the identity of the leader of undercurrent.

He was once the young master of a family, but his family had offended an even more powerful family.

One night, that family bribed the mayor and led everyone to kill the family of the master of undercurrent.

On that night, he saw his parents killed and his wife humiliated.

He was lucky enough to escape, but he didn’t know what happened in the next five years.

When he returned, he had the power of half-step void interpretation.

On that night, he killed all his enemies, not even sparing a single child.

He even killed all the women of that family. That scene was incomparably terrifying.

Following that, his massacre did not end. He killed the mayor of that town, killing everyone he was once unhappy with.

His form, his massacre, was no different from a madman. Anyone who dared to offend him would be directly humiliated to death.

Later on, he established the undercurrent assassin organization, causing the undercurrent’s might to shake the star-moon kingdom in an assassination attempt. It was his first son, who had been beaten to death for molesting a young lady from the insightful void family.

That night, he killed his way into that family, heavily injuring that family’s insightful void expert and killing everyone else in the family.

From then on, he became famous in a single battle and was known as the master of Undercurrent.

That was already forty years ago.

The current master of undercurrent, even if he hadn’t broken through to the second level of the profound void realm, would still be extremely terrifying.

“This is also good. Because of the matter in eastern sea city, if bright moon city interferes, the dragon Spike will definitely attack the city guards and force the city lord’s residence to not interfere in this matter. But now that the undercurrent assassin organization is in front, there’s no need to worry at all!”

The leader of the city guards revealed a smile on his face.

Let the two assassin organizations fight. All they had to do was to watch from the side.

The Sun gradually set. Wang Xian looked at the city that was still calm and revealed a smile.

“I wonder what Will Happen Tomorrow!”

He stood in front of the window and smiled.

“Dragon King, reporting to Dragon King, there’s an urgent matter!”

At this moment, Long Yi’s anxious voice came from outside.

“Come in?”

Wang Xian frowned and looked at the anxious Long Yi. “What’s going on?”

“Dragon King, something has happened to spy No. 3!”

Long Yi said with an embarrassed expression.

“What’s going on? Speak!”

Wang Xian asked him with a dark expression.

“Dragon King, Spy No. 3 was followed by an assassin from the undercurrent when he was handing over the deposit. After the strange demon dealt with the assassin, we asked him to come to a very safe place.”

“But we didn’t expect that not long ago, we couldn’t contact him. A strange demon went to check, but he was no longer there. He should have been taken away!”

Long Yi said hurriedly.

“Taken away?”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. “How did he get discovered?”

“Dragon King, I asked the strange demon who was hiding beside number three. He could guarantee that no one was following them, but... but now...”

Long Yi frowned and said with a bitter face.

A spy was still captured under such circumstances, which made them feel a sense of danger.

“With the strange demon following behind, they are still captured!”

Wang Xian was deep in thought. He was very confident in the strength of the strange demon. Unless there was a seethrough-level powerhouse following them, it was impossible for them not to be discovered.

If it was not an expert at the insightful void level, there was only one way to discover it.

The city protection formation!

The surveillance of the mayor’s residence. If it was not an expert at the insightful void level, only the mayor’s residence could do this.

Wang Xian’s face slowly sank. He looked at Feng Luan and asked, “Feng Luan, what is the relationship between the undercurrent and star-moon kingdom?”

“The undercurrent assassin organization does not accept missions related to the officials of the star-moon kingdom. Other than their leader who killed a mayor forty years ago, they have never assassinated any officials of the star-moon kingdom or even the city guards!”

Feng Luan looked at Wang Xian and hesitated for a moment. “The strength of this undercurrent is not as strong as I imagined. However, they still exist in the star-moon kingdom. They should be related to the Royal Family!”

“I got it!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. This could be explained.

The news of the undercurrent being captured was provided by the mayor’s residence.

Other than the insightful void martial artist, the mayor’s residence was the only one that was involved in this matter.

“This is troublesome!”

Wang Xian frowned. The star-moon kingdom was involved. If the star-moon kingdom were to assist the undercurrent, the dragon spike would be in a much more passive position.

“It seems like I have to get the mayor’s residence to give up on helping the undercurrent. Otherwise... the spies will be captured one by one!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. He looked at long Yi and said, “You should go back first. Let’s take a look at the situation tomorrow!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Long Yi nodded his head and walked out.

Wang Xian stood in front of the window and looked at the street outside.

The street had already turned dark. One by one, luminous pearls lit up.

The capture of a spy did not affect long CI’s mission.

The highest mission was to assassinate an extraordinary level 8 powerhouse.

There were a total of 22 missions. After tonight, long CI could be considered to have announced their arrival completely.

The only flaw was the ambush by the undercurrent assassin organization, which caused a spy to go missing.

“If you guys want to play, then I’ll play with you guys. Unless there are four to five void interpretation stage powerhouses in Bright Moon city guarding this place, Long Ci would not be afraid even if star-moon kingdom and the undercurrent assassin organization were to join forces!”

Wang Xian mumbled as a faint smile appeared on his face.
