Chapter 545: The World of Nine Cauldrons

The highest peak of Huashan was now in a mess.

The peak that was in the clouds had been shortened by more than a thousand meters while the entire mountain had a horrible-looking crack.

Back at the foot of the mountain, everyone looked in the direction of Donghua Sacred Sect in silence. As the breeze ran across their skin, it brought hair-raising chillness.

“Space was cast aside without any worldly care to gather the Spiritual Energy. It was a way to avoid the Age of Dharma Decline!”

Nie Wuya gravely continued his speech. “According to the legend, the experts from the Immortal Sects sensed the diminishing Spiritual Energy of Heaven and Earth. For the development of Immortal Sects, they used the Immortal Treasure, Nine Cauldrons, to set aside a space. This space that was guarded by Nine Cauldrons, gathering all the Spiritual Energy, has turned into the legendary Immortal Realm. I guess Sect Leader and the rest have entered the Nine Cauldrons’ Worlds!”

“The so-called Nine Cauldrons’ Worlds are separate lands of peace that are isolated by the arrays?” asked the old man beside Nie Wuya in a murmur.

“Each of the Nine Cauldrons sets aside a world, and Nine Cauldrons set aside nine worlds in total. That is to say, there are nine independent Immortal Realms within and around our country!”

Nie Wuya nodded his head slowly.

“Can’t the people from the Nine Cauldrons’ Worlds come out? Or can’t we enter into the Nine Cauldrons’ Worlds?” a Dan Realm expert from a Sacred Clan could not help but ask.

“I don’t know. I really have no idea.” Nie Wuya shook his head in bitterness.

“The Nine Cauldrons guard nine separate worlds that are namely Xuanyuan, Ji, Huang, Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Xia, and Yong Chang. As the Nine Cauldrons gather Spiritual Energy, the cultivation speed within the world is faster by four to five times as compared to the outside world. Within Nine Cauldrons’ Worlds, there are many experts, including those in the Immortal Realm. Access to these worlds has been closed since three hundred years ago. It was impossible to enter the Nine Cauldrons’ Worlds. That also marked extreme difficulties for people to come out as well. Unless you have the Immortal Treasure, along with Immortal prowess, you will not be able to walk out of Nine Cauldrons’ Worlds!” [1]

“However, the Nine Cauldrons have been suppressing the Spiritual Qi for over a thousand years. When there is insufficient energy for the Nine Cauldrons to gather, there will be a day when the Nine Cauldrons’ Worlds will emerge once again!”

Suddenly, a graceful yet haughty voice was heard, stunning everyone. All of them looked to the source of it.

A girl beside the Guild Leader of Sacred Followers Guild lifted her chin as she spoke with pride. She seemed to be flaunting her knowledge.

“Hehe, my disciple knows everything from astronomy to geography!” the Guild Leader of Sacred Followers Guild explained to everyone with a smile.

“What does a kid know?”

An Inborn Expert of Donghua Sacred Sect pouted in disbelief.

“Who is the kid here? Who said I don’t know anything? This world over here at Huashan is called Yong Chang. There are three Immortal Sects in it which are called Yong Chang Immortal Sect, Immortal Slaying Sect, and Da Hong Immortal Sect. Hmph, shut your mouth if you don’t know anything!”

Upon hearing someone challenging her, the lass was so furious that she growled at that Inborn Expert.

“You lass...”

“Dong Wen, shut up!”

Before that Inborn Expert could finish his sentence, he was cut off by Nie Wuya’s cold bellow. This caught him by surprise as he quickly kept his mouth shut and looked over.

He saw that Nie Wuya had disbelief in his eyes, staring at that little girl with glistening eyes. “Yong Chang, Immortal Slaying, and Da Hong were not fictitious sects made up by the ancient people?”

“Of course not! Not even Penglai Immortal Island. That’s the place guarded by Yu Cauldron. You bunch of ignorant fellows, what do you know?” [2]

The little girl did not give any face to Nie Wuya as she spoke with contempt in his face.

However, Nie Wuya’s emotions were stirred up, and he did not mind her rudeness. He murmured, “Little did I expect what Sect Leader told me to all be true! It’s real!”

“Immortal Sect, there are Immortal Sects in this world. What do the Nine Cauldrons’ Worlds look like?”

Some of them mumbled as they craned their necks to look up at the sky above Huashan. There lay a hidden world known as Yong Chang!

“Could the immortals who can ride on swords and kill someone from a thousand miles away, driving on a cloud and somersaulting a thousand miles...could they really exist?”

Some of the people were looking forward to it.

“Little girl, do you think our Sect Leader has a chance of coming out from the Yong Chang World?” asked Nie Wuya with a solemn expression after taking a deep breath.

“If he was not killed by that swordsman, I guess he should have a chance of coming out!”

The little girl was not very sure, so she casually mentioned it. “After all, he has already advanced to the Budding Realm and is considered to be an expert in Nine Cauldrons’ Worlds. But it is uncertain when he will come out. Maybe a few years or even more than that. It should be soon!”

“Is that so?”

Nie Wuya and all the people from Donghua Sacred Sect felt relieved. The group from Diabolism also wiped the sweat away from their foreheads.

“Looks like the Nine Cauldrons’ Worlds are not as scary as one imagined. There are supreme experts everywhere!”

“Sect Leader Nie Wushuang, Emperor Qi, Dragon King, and the middle-aged swordsman already possess daunting powers. If they are not considered experts in that world, that would be too scary.”

“Someone above the Budding Realm is known to be an Immortal. That means to say, there are Immortals and Immortal Sects in these worlds. Perhaps the Inborn Experts are everywhere, and Dan Realm Experts make up the highest number of people there.”

“That would be too crazy. Nine Cauldrons refer to nine worlds. I wonder what kind of worlds they are, and what kind of encounter Sect Leader Nie Wushuang will be met with.”

Everyone was discussing fervently as the Nine Cauldrons’ Worlds opened a new horizon for them.

“Nine Cauldrons’ Worlds are too far from us!”

Nie Wuya and the rest of the experts looked blankly at the sky above Huashan.

“Let’s postpone the battle between the orthodox sects and Diabolism. From now on, we will not cross each other’s paths. If you dare to provoke us, it will be the time when a bloodbath arises in Underworld!”

Nie Wuya paused for a few minutes as he called out while looking in the direction of Devil Corpse Palace.

“Fine. Diabolism will not attack anyone from the alliance of the orthodox sects within the next five years unless you guys attack us first. That goes without saying...”

An expert from Devil Corpse Palace pondered as he nodded while looking at all the experts of Diabolism.

Now they had a pact for five years.

“Great!”

At the same time, all the experts from the alliance of the orthodox sects and Diabolism looked toward Dragon Sect.

The reason for the peace between orthodox sects and Diabolism was because of the uncertain factor, Dragon Sect.

Now, the three forces were restraining one another. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“The day our Dragon King returns will be the day Dragon Sect fights the Underworld!”

Mo Qinglong lifted his head and spoke to them in a flat voice.

Phew!

Upon hearing Mo Qinglong, Donghua Sacred Sect and Diabolism heaved a sigh of relief.

It’s a good thing for you guys, Dragon Sect, to stop finding our troubles.

Regardless of the alliance of the orthodox sects or Diabolism, they were all wonderstruck by Dragon Sect.

The two swordsmen with Charging Sword and Return Sword had killed the former second expert in the Underworld within split seconds.

None from the Underworld could take on such formidable swordsmanship.

From then on, since Nie Wushuang, Emperor Qi, Dragon King, and the middle-aged swordsman entered the Yong Chang World through the crack in the air, the Underworld split into three forces pinned against each other.
