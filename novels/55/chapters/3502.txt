“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Numerous extremely sharp thorns covered Wang Xian.

“Crash!”

Wang Xian flapped his uninitiated holy wings. The tai chi dragon circled around him while the king of water tentacles formed a line of defense.

“Boom!”

He completely resisted his opponent’s attack. He flapped his uninitiated holy wings and attacked the Golden Hoop Sky Plant Demon Beast in the sky.

“Huh?”

The Golden Hoop Sky plant demon beast stared at Wang Xian with a cold and disdainful look. “Azure Dragon? You are courting death!”

“Crash!”

In the next moment, numerous metal-like branches attacked Wang Xian.

Wang Xian focused his gaze. Waves of energy surged into the five elements Millstone and went straight for the golden branches.

The spirit of the accompanying Elf began to strengthen it. The water touch king and his Netherspirit avatar also attacked at the same time.

“With our combined strength, we can withstand it!”

The Water Touch King roared with confidence.

Regardless of whether it was Wang Xian, the five elements millstone, or the water touch king, they could not be understood by ordinary experts of the same level.

They could easily kill existences of the same level.

All the attacks collided with the branches of the Golden Light, resulting in a violent collision.

Boom

The branches of the golden light began to melt, and so did Wang Xian’s attacks.

It was blocked!

“Huh?”

At the front, the Golden Hoop Celestial Plant Demonic Beast was full of surprise when he saw this scene.

His gaze swept across Wang Xian’s body, and his eyes sparkled.

“What is that? A companion elf? And An Abyss Ghost Avatar? How is this possible? What kind of opportunity is this?”

The Golden Hoop Celestial plant demonic beast revealed a shocked expression.

Crash

In the next moment, his eyes emitted a scorching glow as he attacked Wang Xian directly.

“Attack!”

Wang Xian growled in a low voice. The king of watertentacles with the uninitiated holy wings flew to both sides while the Abyss Ghost Avatar was in the middle!

Wang Xian, on the other hand, relied on his speed and disappeared in an instant. He arrived at a position above the king of Waterspout.

“HMPH, your speed is not bad. However, with this speed, you still want to suppress me?”

The Golden Hoop Celestial plant demonic beast snorted coldly. Numerous golden branches extended out from his body.

There were golden leaves attached to the branches.

These leaves were extremely sharp.

His attack enveloped the king of Waterspout and the Netherworld Ghost Avatar.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The sound of collision rang out once again. This time, Wang Xian’s body was sent flying backward.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

He let out a wild roar and instantly transformed into an azure dragon. With a wave of his dragon claws, he attacked Wang Xian one by one.

“Golden wild, annihilate them. TSK TSK, I really didn’t expect an azure dragon to have so many good fortune. Today, your good fortune all belongs to me!”

The Golden Hoop Sky plant demonic beast let out a wild roar and golden leaves swept towards Wang Xian and the rest.

It was like a hurricane blowing the extremely sharp leaves, cutting through the void and attacking indiscriminately.

When Wang Xian saw this attack, his expression changed slightly.

His figure flashed and he instantly arrived at the side of the five elements grinding mill. Relying on his speed, he gathered together with the water contact King’s Ghost Avatar.

“Defend!”

He growled in a low voice as layers of defense stood in front of him.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The terrifying attack landed on the ground. Wang Xian and the rest managed to defend against it.

“Divine dragon playing with beads!”

Wang Xian growled and released his strongest aspect attack.

The Shadow of a divine dragon appeared. It carried a dragon bead and attacked the golden hoop sky plant directly.

“Heaven Devouring!”

The water touch king shouted loudly. Black holes appeared in the surrounding river water. They gradually enlarged and headed straight for the Golden Hoop Sky plant.

“HMPH, a puny level two life form who is the ruler of the universe. How Dare You Provoke Me!”

The Golden Hoop Sky plant was furious when it saw that its attacks were being blocked one after another. Its body began to expand crazily.

Very soon, its body grew to a size of tens of thousands of meters. Numerous golden branches covered Wang Xian and the rest.

“Dragon King, we can’t defeat him.”

Water Touch King looked at the might of the Golden Hoop Celestial plant demonic beast and said.

It was easy to fight for a while, but it was impossible to defeat the other party.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian also understood that it was already good enough for them to fight against him when they joined forces. It was impossible for them to defeat the other party.

All he needed to do was to attract the other party.

Wang Xian flapped his uninitiated holy wings and instantly fled into the distance.

“If you want to escape, you must die. Seed of life, Soul Chase!”

When the Golden Hoop Sky plant demonic beast saw him fleeing, it waved its branches and a seed instantly shot toward Wang Xian.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian sensed this seed and his expression changed slightly. He wanted to dodge it immediately.

However, this strange seed entered his body directly.

When the seed entered his body, he didn’t feel any discomfort. Furthermore, the species disappeared instantly.

“What is this thing?”

His mind stirred. He immediately mobilized the power of the ancestral tree to search for this species.

However, the ancestral tree didn’t sense anything.

“That’s not right. This is a lock on my aura. When the seed entered my body, not only did it not have any side effects, but it allowed me to absorb it instantaneously and improve a little. However, there is a kind of energy in it. The other party can track me through this kind of energy.”

Wang Xian’s mind was filled with thoughts, and his eyes were sparkling.

“Hahaha, connect!”

At this moment, the Golden Hoop Celestial plant demonic beast let out a maniacal laugh from behind.

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly. A golden leaf appeared on his body.

This leaf seemed to have grown out from his body, causing him to frown slightly.

“Is it some kind of method to prevent me from returning to the Divine Kingdom in an instant?”

He mumbled as a hint of seriousness appeared on his face. He flapped his incipient saint wings and flew forward rapidly.

“You can’t escape. You have my mark of life on you. You Can’t escape!”

The Golden Hoop Sky plant demonic beast said coldly as he chased after Wang Xian.

His speed was no slower than Wang Xian’s.

After all, his strength was one level lower than Wang Xian’s!

Feeling the pursuit from behind, Wang Xian’s expression turned slightly ugly. Ever since he became enemies with the Holy Dragon lineage, he had been pursued several times!

“After this, I must raise my combat strength to level three as soon as possible. Only then will I be able to be unafraid of any living beings below the peak of the Universe!”

Anger welled up in Wang Xian’s heart as he quickly flew up into the sky. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The Golden Hoop Sky plant demonic beast followed closely behind him. Golden Sharp branches attacked him from time to time.

“Bang!”

After flying for 20 minutes, Wang Xian broke through the ground of the encirclement.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

At this moment, golden thorns gathered at the back and pierced through Wang Xian.

“Defend!”

He growled and a thick defense appeared behind him.

“Bang!”

The collision was heard and blood trickled out from the corner of Wang Xian’s mouth!
