Dragon Eye Lock on all corners!

A large number of chains appeared around Wang Xian. The chains covered the entire area!

Dragon Eye Lock on all corners could seal off an entire space and prevent other experts from escaping!

The entire space was instantly sealed off by him!

However, the mad demon restriction did not care about the surrounding blockade at all. His mad eyes locked onto Wang Xian and attacked him!

Riding on the Space Beast, the innate supreme treasure in his hand emitted a terrifying aura.

The body of the mad demon prohibition was filled with brutality and madness. The fighting spirit in his body had reached its peak!

An indomitable will to die made one’s heart tremble!

“Ahhhh!”

He roared crazily. With both hands holding the innate supreme treasure, he attacked Wang Xian!

“Die!”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the Space Beast and the Mad Demon Prohibition. His eyes were flashing coldly!

The strength of the space beast under him was at most comparable to two to three level three experts who were masters of the universe!

This was nothing to Wang Xian!

“Crash!”

Wang Xian flapped his incorporeal holy wings and his speed instantly reached its peak!

The Mad Demon Prohibition, which was attacking Wang Xian, stopped breathing for a moment. Its pair of forbidden eyes scanned the surroundings crazily!

“Forbidden Shadow!”

When he realized that he couldn’t see Wang Xian’s figure at all, his eyes were blood red. Behind him, a terrifying shadow slowly formed!

The entire shadow was blood red and contained a strange energy!

Boom 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

However, at this moment, Wang Xian’s figure appeared behind him!

The five elements grinding mill was attacking him directly!

Buzz

The strange figure that had just appeared formed a powerful defense!

When the five elements millstone hit it, the figure trembled violently and started to turn illusory!

“Huh?”

When Wang Xian saw this scene, he raised his eyebrows slightly!

Whoosh

The next moment, his figure disappeared again.

“Scram!”

The Mad Demon Prohibition could not keep up with Wang Xian’s speed. Although the five elements Millstone’s attack was blocked by the figure behind him, he could not lock onto Wang Xian’s figure at all!

The innate supreme treasure in his hand swept across and attacked indiscriminately!

Buzz

However, faced with the attack of the ward of madness, Wang Xian completely ignored it and charged straight in!

The defense of the Tai Chi Dragon Plate allowed him to break through the attack of the ward of madness. With the five elements millstone in his hand, he smashed it toward the top of his head again!

All kinds of powerful innate supreme treasures surrounded the entire five elements millstone.

“Roar!”

When the mad demon prohibition saw this scene, he let out a roar and his expression changed drastically!

“Boom!”

The five elements millstone smashed onto his body. The energy that was destroyed was attacking his physical body!

“Crash!”

Wang Xian moved and instantly appeared behind him. His dragon claws clawed at his chest!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

A miserable cry came out from his mouth!

The space beast beneath him trembled slightly as it felt the terrifying energy!

The earth elemental energy on its body charged towards Wang Xian!

“You’re courting death!”

Wang Xian let out a soft cry. The Tai Chi Dragon disc around his body condensed into a dragon head and attacked the space beast below!

“Awoo! Awoo!”

The Space Beast let out a miserable cry.

“Die, die, die!”

The Mad Demon restriction, which was severely injured by Wang Xian, kept roaring. However, his attacks were completely useless against Wang Xian and the five elements!

“What’s going on in this battle? has the Dragon King completely sealed off the mad demon restriction?”

“The Dragon King’s strength is somewhat heaven-defying. I feel that the mad demon restriction is no match for the Dragon King. He’s completely suppressed!”

“He’s too strong. The Dragon King is simply too strong. If it were us, we would be instantly killed!”

“The Dragon King won’t kill the Mad Hex, right? If that’s the case, then the invincible zone would be shaken!”

“It shouldn’t be. If you want to kill the Mad Hex, you have to have at least three experts who can contend against the Mad Hex. Can the Dragon King do it?”

At this moment, the dragon eye locked onto the battlefield. All the Old Monsters of the Invincible Zone looked in with surprise.

The strength that the Dragon King displayed completely shocked them!

“The seal is going to disappear!”

At this moment, they found that the Dragon Eye locked onto the battlefield was slowly disappearing.

The scene inside slowly appeared!

“This… This Is?”

However, when the scene inside appeared, everyone’s pupils contracted slightly!

In the middle, only Wang Xian’s figure was floating there!

He was holding a metal innate treasure in his hand!

After that, there was nothing else!

The figure of the mad demon restriction had disappeared!

Even his aura had completely disappeared!

Whether it was dead or alive, one could tell from the innate supreme treasure in the Dragon King’s hands!

That was the innate supreme treasure of the Mad Demon Prohibition!

The Mad Demon Prohibition, dead!

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the surroundings and held the innate supreme treasure in his hands. A hint of a smile appeared on his face!

“Where is the nest of the Taishui Demon King?”

His gaze landed on an old monster from the invincible region and asked indifferently!

The old monster’s heart tightened when Wang Xian asked him for directions. He immediately pointed in a direction.

“Sir Dragon King, we should be able to reach it by flying in that direction. The invincible zone is very big and it might take a long time to fly!”

Wang Xian looked in the direction he pointed and nodded his head slightly.

“Do you know the places where there are more desolate beasts and space behemoths in the Invincible Zone?”

He glanced at the old monsters around him and asked.

“The desolate beasts and space behemoths are in the depths of the bloody sea and the meteorite barbaric zone!”

The old monster who replied earlier continued!

“Alright, spread the word that I, the Dragon King, have entered the invincible zone. If you want to see the experts of the Invincible Zone, you can come to me directly if you have the guts!”

Wang Xian said indifferently.

After that, he flew straight into the depths.

“This… The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is so powerful. He actually asked us to spread the word!”

“Even the mad demon restriction has been killed by the Dragon King. In a one-on-one situation, unless there are other old mad demons, the rest, even if they are top-notch experts, are no match for the Dragon King!”

“After killing the mad demon restriction, the Dragon King’s strength can definitely be ranked in the top three in the invincible zone. He might even be invincible!”

“In our invincible zone, there’s probably no one who can kill him one-on-one. This… unless we work together, the Dragon King can really sweep through!”

The Old Monsters of the invincible zone were discussing in shock!

They had just stepped into their invincible zone and easily killed the mad demon seal, which made them feel shocked!

After all, the mad demon seal was the strongest Old Mad Demon in their invincible zone!

“This strength is so strong!”

At the entrance of the invincible region, the five experts of the Phoenix clan looked at each other with astonishment in their eyes!

They had received the order to go back and come here again to carry out the mission of a Lord of the Phoenix clan!

The mission to kill the Dragon King!

However, the strength displayed by the Dragon King had shocked them!
