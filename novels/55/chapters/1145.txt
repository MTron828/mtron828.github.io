Chapter 1146: The 1147 Dragon Spike came

Translator: 5496903

“PFFT!”

He stared at Wang Xian’s calm eyes. He was extremely shocked and had a bad feeling.

However, before the dagger in his hand hit Wang Xian, he felt a chill on his neck. He widened his eyes and his eyes were filled with disbelief.

How could this be? Who was the one who attacked him? Why didn’t I sense it? L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Doubts flashed across Diablo’s mind as he stared blankly at Wang Xian!

However, with his neck pierced through, he couldn’t say a word. He stared at Wang Xian and slowly lowered his raised arm.

“Half-step void interpretation level? What is the status of that young man? How could he mobilize an expert of half-step void interpretation from the undercurrent assassin organization?”

“Only the master of undercurrent should be able to mobilize an expert of half-step void interpretation from undercurrent. That young man is obviously not the master of undercurrent. could he be the son of the Master of Undercurrent?”

Wang Xian guessed in a low voice.

The fact that the undercurrent assassin organization had a half-step void interpretation expert was a little out of his expectations. Therefore, he could guess that the master of undercurrent was a void interpretation expert.

This was forcing him to become the enemy of the undercurrent assassin organization!

“We are all enemies. No matter who you are, since you have provoked me, you must die!”

“Even if you are the descendant of the master of undercurrent, Hehe, just use it as a stepping stone for the dragon Spike!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled. Whenever the dragon spike went to a place, it would announce its arrival by assassinating a powerhouse or family. This time, he would use the son of the master of undercurrent as a stepping stone!

“Ao Yao, let’s Go and give him a surprise!”

Wang Xian smiled and moved. He opened the door and walked to the room beside.

Ao Yao followed behind him with the dark corpse in her hands.

Creak

Wang Xian pushed the door open. The door was not locked.

“Uncle Diablo, you are so fast. Haha, that Kid was killed...”

The door was pushed open. Young Master Ying, who was sitting in front of the table and tasting the wine with a smile on his face, stood up happily and said.

However, when he saw clearly that it was Wang Xian who walked in, he stopped talking and revealed a shocked expression.

“Is it called Diablo?”

Wang Xian smiled and scanned his surroundings!

“Bang!”

At this moment, Ao Yao who was following behind him waved his arm and threw the corpse in his hand into the room.

“Hiss! Bang!”

When he saw the corpse on the ground, young master Ying could not help but suck in a breath of cold air. He retreated backward and crashed into the chair.

“You... you...”

He stared at Wang Xian with his eyes wide open. His eyes were filled with disbelief.

Wang Xian looked at him with a smile. “You sent people to kill me for two days in a row. Do you think I’m that easy to kill?”

As he spoke, he walked toward young master Ying with a smile on his face.

“You... Don’t...”

When he saw Wang Xian walking toward him, his facial expression changed. Suddenly, his body moved and he crashed toward the outside.

“Bang!”

However, at this moment, a black sharp weapon that looked like a sickle was placed on his neck. His body trembled as he tried to escape. His forehead was filled with cold sweat.

Fear enveloped him completely.

“I said that I will make you regret it!”

Wang Xian looked at him indifferently.

“Don’t... Don’t kill me. If you dare to kill me, my father will definitely not let you off. Don’t kill me. In the future, I will...”

“Who is your father?”

Young Master Ying’s face was filled with fear as he spoke. Wang Xian interrupted him and asked coldly.

“My father is the leader of the undercurrent. My father is the leader of the undercurrent assassin organization. If you dare to kill me, the undercurrent will not let you off. My father will not let you off either!”

Young Master Ying’s face was pale as he growled in a low voice, “Don’t kill me, don’t kill me...”

“Let me introduce myself first!”

Wang Xian wasn’t too surprised when he heard his words. He smiled and said, “I’m the leader of the dragon thorns, so...”

He smiled as he stared at Young Master Ying. This smile made young master Ying Widen his eyes. His eyes were filled with despair.

Dragon Thorns?

He was the leader of the Dragon Thorns assassin organization?

The dragon thorns that were currently in the limelight? Even his own father was filled with fear towards the dragon thorns!

How... How did this happen.

“I said you will regret it!”

Wang Xian shook his head slowly. Just as he was about to shout, Ao Yao’s scythe-like arm was placed on his neck.

“Hang his corpse on the city wall at the East Gate and announce our arrival!”

Wang Xian looked at the two corpses on the ground and said to Ao Yao who was beside him.

“It’s the Dragon King. Leave the rest to us!”

Ao Yao replied.

This was not the first time that Ao Yao had done something like this. She was now completely familiar with the situation!

“Remember to update their identities!”

Wang Xian said faintly.

“Yes!”

Ao Yao left. At the same time, there were a group of strange demons around her.

The secret was already set up. Ao Yao and the rest had obtained the addresses of all the powerful mercenary groups and families in Bright Moon City.

Just like before, the first step to awe the entire Bright Moon City had arrived!

The forty strange demons brought by Wang Xian had arranged everything in less than ten minutes.

Congratulations, death had arrived at Bright Moon City.

Bright Moon City was a big city. There were people guarding the city gate 24 hours a day.

When the sky had just brightened, there were mercenary groups and businessmen who got up.

At four o’clock in the morning, when the sky had just brightened, there were people walking out of the city.

“Let’s set off early today. We can take advantage of the day to properly hunt down the fire beetles!”

“We must return with a full load today. Alas, unfortunately, the Tian family head of the Tian family’s trading firm was assassinated by an assassin from the undercurrent, causing the price of the fire beetle shells to drop significantly!”

“Do you think the Sun family hired an assassin to kill the Tian family’s head? Recently, the Sun family’s trading company has had a huge conflict with the Tian family’s trading company!”

“Shh, Lower Your Voice. This is very possible. However, the undercurrent assassin organization is truly terrifying. They easily killed a top-tier expert at transcendent level nine!”

“It’s extremely terrifying, but I heard that there’s some dragon assassin organization in East Sea City. It’s also very powerful. I heard that even the city lord of East Sea city is helpless against it!”

“PFFT, how can it be as powerful as the undercurrent assassin organization? One must know that the undercurrent covers the entire star-moon kingdom. Even star-moon kingdom is helpless against it!”

“It must be the undercurrent assassin organization that’s awesome. The undercurrent has decades of foundation in star-moon kingdom. How can a dragon assassin compare to it!”

Early in the morning, a bleak wind blew past. A group of over ten mercenary group members walked out of the city.

The group chatted as they walked, discussing the major events that had happened in the past few days.

The biggest event was none other than the incident in the Hundred Beast City. However, a very important event had also happened last night.

It was the assassination of the head of the Tian family, a transcendent level 9 powerhouse, by the undercurrent assassin organization.

However, because the incident in the Hundred Beast City was too huge, it did not cause as much of a stir as usual.

However, those who knew about it were still extremely shocked.

Assassinating such an expert, the undercurrent, was so terrifying!
