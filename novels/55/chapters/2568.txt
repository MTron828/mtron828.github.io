2569 2569’s position had been established

“Capture them! Don’t let any of them escape!”

A furious and violent roar was heard once again. The sect master of the Ninth Grade Heaven sect flew over with a face full of fury!

An elder of the ninth grade heaven sect also rushed over. His eyes were blood-red as he roared crazily!

One-fifth of the entire ninth grade Heaven Sect’s commercial planet had been destroyed. The entire planet was in a mess!

Compared to the last time when a building was destroyed, this time was undoubtedly much more tragic!

“Retreat!”

The members of the Dragon Palace saw the Undying God King Level 7 warrior return, their faces filled with mockery!

Ao Yao’s voice entered everyone’s ears!

“Weng!”

The next moment, all the members of the dragon palace trembled and disappeared!

They all left without any injuries!

“Boom!”

The enraged ninth-grade sky sect master landed heavily on the ground, his body trembling!

“Dragon Palace!”

Looking at the destroyed areas around him, the ninth-grade sky sect master couldn’t help but roar, his eyes filled with blood red!

Behind him, the ninth-grade sky sect master’s body trembled!

This time, their million-strong army was sent back before they could enter the Dragon Star!

Now, the Dragon Palace had destroyed one-fifth of their commercial planet!

If not for the protection of the defense system, the entire planet would have been destroyed!

This time, their ninth grade Sky clan had suffered a huge loss!

“This...”

On the planet below, everyone looked at the destroyed planet with an ugly expression when they saw the Undying King leave!

“Why did the people from the Dragon Palace suddenly come here to destroy it? Didn’t the ninth grade Sky clan already kill their way over, how could they still send people over?”

The undying godly monarchs looked at the destroyed property with extremely gloomy expressions!

“Look at the AI, someone said that the ninth grade Sky clan attacked the dragon star, but they were blocked outside, all 15 battleships were destroyed, and the ninth grade Sky clan fled!”

At that moment, a scream came from not far away!

The surrounding people were stunned and immediately opened the AI!

Indeed, the AI had gone crazy!

The ninth grade sky sect gathered 80% of their strength and led their disciples to destroy the Dragon Palace and the Tiger Chaos Demon Country. They were aggressive and domineering!

However, there were fifteen warship remnants in the air!

An immortal godly monarch expert claimed that the ninth-grade sky sect had fled in panic. They had not even managed to break through the Dragon Star’s defenses!

The news shocked everyone. At first, many people did not believe it, but when someone teleported into the Dragon Palace, they realized that everything was true!

“Who would have thought that it would be like this? Holy shit, this is unbelievable. The entire ninth-grade sky did not break through the Dragon Star’s defenses!”

“Is the defense of the Dragon Star going to be heaven-defying? This is a ninth-grade celestial sect. The godly monarch-level warships were easily destroyed. The Dragon Palace and the Tiger Chaos Fey Kingdom did not even make a move!”

“Now, the ninth-grade celestial sect has lost a lot of face. They were so arrogant that they charged straight at us. In the end, all of them escaped in less than ten minutes!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The AI was Abuzz. who could have imagined such a situation?

The incredibly powerful ninth grade celestial sect had fled?

However, very quickly, the news of the ninth grade celestial sect’s commercial planet being attacked spread to the AI. It was a mess of pictures!

The videos after being destroyed spread crazily on the AI!

Once this news was out, it once again caused the entire star South star system to shake!

“This... What happened to the agreement to destroy the Dragon Palace, Tiger Country, and Demon Country? What Happened Now? Their own home was destroyed?”

“The difference is too big, it’s too ironic, a fifth of the ninth grade celestial sect’s commercial planet was destroyed by the Dragon Palace’s 500 undying fighters!”

“From the looks of it, the ninth grade celestial sect’s commercial planet is no match for the Dragon Star, the difference in defense is like heaven and earth!”

“The Dragon Star has an extremely powerful array formation master guarding it, I reckon that no force in the entire star South Galaxy can break through the Dragon Star!”

“The Dragon Star is the safest commercial planet!”

As soon as these two pieces of news were spread out, countless people started discussing!

The power of the Dragon Star shocked everyone!

Later, someone revealed that the Dragon Star had an extremely powerful array formation master guarding it. No one could break through it, and no one could cause trouble on the Dragon Star!

Once this news was spread out, the status of the dragon star rose by several levels!

Such a safe planet was the best commercial planet!

There was no need to be afraid of comparison. The difference between a commercial planet of a ninth-grade heavenly sect and Dragon Star was like the difference between heaven and earth!

Countless people were discussing on the AI!

The strength of the Dragon Palace and the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation!

...

The defense of Dragon Star!

In the end, it could be concluded that even if the dragon palace and the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation were not as strong as the four top forces, they were definitely not weaker than them!

In fact, the other four forces could not break through the dragon star at all!

However, the Dragon Palace and the Tiger Riot Demon Kingdom were able to wreak havoc on their commercial planet!

The Dragon Star was also rated as the most secure city with the strongest defense in the southern star system!

This caused many people to flood into the dragon star system and many businesses to enter the Dragon Star System!

“Wow, not long ago, I returned the house in the dragon star system. Now, it costs five times more divine stones to buy it. F * ck, are they robbing us?”

“How can you blame others for your stupidity? Did you think that they would not raise the price of the divine stones when Dragon Star was about to be destroyed? Now that Dragon Star has become the safest planet in the southern star system, will they not raise the price of the house on Dragon Star?”

“With the price of the house on Dragon Star, it will probably go up a lot. There will probably be a lot of businessmen living here in the future!”

At this moment, when everyone on Dragon Star learned that the dragon palace had easily withstood the attack of the ninth-grade celestial sect, many people rushed to Dragon Star crazily!

Especially those who had bought a house, they immediately came forward and wanted to buy the house again!

...

Unfortunately, this time, it had increased by five times. If you want to buy it, then get lost!

Today’s battle had completely established the strength and status of Dragon Star!

Now, it could be said that the dragon palace and the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation could rival the other four major forces!

And Dragon Star could surpass the other four major commercial planets!

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian stood on the planet in the sky and looked down at the Dragon Star with a smile on his face!

“Next, don’t be careless. Continue to build the safety and defense of the Dragon Star. Also, we must take revenge and lay the foundation of our Dragon Palace!”

He said to the Heaven Formation calmly!

“It’s the Dragon King. With me around, I guarantee that nothing will happen!”

The sky array replied confidently!

“Alright, let’s develop steadily for a period of time!”

Wang Xian smiled. This time, they had completely established a foothold in the southern star system!

Once their foundation was established, it would be much easier for the Dragon Palace to improve rapidly!

However, compared to the prosperity of the Dragon Star, the celebration of the Dragon Palace and the chaotic demon kingdom, which was located at the ninth-grade heaven sect, everyone’s expression was extremely ugly!

They had not fought for more than 100,000 years, but this battle had become a disgrace!
