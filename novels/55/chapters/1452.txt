Chapter 1453: The 1,453 people attacked

“All Savage Dynasty Demon Beasts, listen to my command!”

When Ao Xingmu’s voice resounded in the sky around the prodigy stage, the wind and clouds in the sky changed.

On the ground, the blood-red plants on the ground seemed to come alive.

The moment the voice ended, there was dead silence in the surroundings!

The expressions of the leaders of the Demon Scale Demon Beast clan and the bloodthirsty sea demon clan kept changing.

They also didn’t expect this scene to happen. Ao Xingmu, who had easily exterminated the Blood Barbarian Demonic Beast clan, was actually a subordinate of a human.

Moreover, that human was the supreme genius of the human-monster graveyard.

This implied that the entire demonic beast clan would listen to a human.

But if they didn’t listen, what could they do?

“We obey the emperor’s order!”

After a short second, the hundred or so demon beast leaders on the statue instantly emitted terrifying killing intent.

Demon Beasts had always regarded the strong as their emperor.

No matter what, Ao Xingmu in front of them was their emperor. They didn’t care about anything else.

Moreover, they couldn’t care about anything else.

If they wanted to live, they could only listen to the emperor’s orders.

“We obey the emperor’s orders!”

Hundreds of thousands of demonic beasts stood up, and waves of murderous aura and barbaric aura shot up into the sky.

“Kill all those from the blood flow empire!”

Ao Xingmu swept his gaze across all the demonic beasts and ordered in a deep voice.

“Yes!”

Dozens of demonic beasts roared again, and pairs of blood-red eyes looked at everyone from the blood flow empire.

“No, no, no, I’m not from the bloodshed empire. I’m not. Don’t kill me!”

“Sir Wang Xian, we’re not from the bloodshed empire. We were forced to do so just now. Don’t Kill Us!”

“I’m willing to join the bloodshed Empire Alliance. I’m willing to join. Don’t kill me!”

At this moment, the tens of millions of people behind the bloodshed empire were completely dumbfounded.

Feeling the terrifying aura of the hundreds of thousands of demon beasts and the murderous aura that caused the heaven and earth to change color, their eyes were filled with fear.

These hundreds of thousands of intelligent demon beasts were very, very few compared to the tens of millions of people. However, in terms of quality, the difference was simply too great.

In fact, a single demon beast could slaughter a thousand humans.

Not to mention, there were also over two thousand void interpretation experts?

The sounds of begging for mercy continued to ring out.

Some people even flew towards the rear of the flowing Emperor Alliance, completely opposite to the scene just now.

However, the expressions of those few forces that had just betrayed the flowing Emperor Alliance became interesting.

From Green to white, from white to black, it was very interesting.

Regret, regret, all surged into their hearts.

“You... you...”

Blood Emperor felt the aura of hundreds of thousands of beasts and his expression changed drastically. His body that was suspended in the air kept flying backward.

His expression changed drastically, and there was a trace of fear in his eyes.

Everyone in blood flow empire was also full of fear. They held their weapons tightly, and their foreheads were full of cold sweat.

“Haha, Kill, Kill!”

Meanwhile, the experts from the blood flow empire revealed excited expressions on their faces.

They raised the weapons in their hands. Their eyes were filled with intense and excited fighting spirit.

The Invincible King of Demonic Beasts was actually a subordinate of Lord Wang Xian.

This was simply unimaginable to them.

No wonder Lord Wang Xian was always so calm.

No wonder the invincible king of the wildlands would be so polite to the dragon and Phoenix Queen.

“Those who have nothing to do with this, leave this place. Kill all the people from the bloodshed empire!”

Wang Xian raised his arm slowly and a five elements millstone appeared in his hand. His cold voice rang out.

“Let’s go, let’s leave quickly!”

“Thank you, Lord Wang. Thank you, Lord Wang. Let’s leave immediately. We will join the Bloodshed Empire Alliance in the future!”

“Thank you, Lord Wang!”

When they heard Wang Xian’s words, the humans and factions who had joined the flowing blood empire immediately fled into the distance.

As they fled, they expressed their gratitude with faces full of gratitude.

“Kill!”

Ao Xingmu raised his arm. Above his head, an emerald-green tree appeared. The tree looked somewhat like an ancestral tree.

Branches were hanging down from the sky. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Roar Roar Roar!”

Hundreds of thousands of demonic beasts roared. The leaders of the demonic beast races leaped forward, directly pouncing towards the blood flow empire.

Ten Thousand Beasts roared.

They watched helplessly as hundreds of thousands of demonic beasts pounced over. Just that aura alone caused all the profound void realm experts of the blood flow empire to lose their fighting spirit.

Even if they had six to seven hundred profound void realm experts.

“Sir Ren, save us!”

When the Blood Emperor saw the demonic beast charging over, he shouted at an old man from the third trading company in the world with a face full of fear.

Below, the old man from the third trading company in the world frowned slightly when he heard the Blood Emperor’s cry for help

Everything had far exceeded their expectations.

The plan was completely messed up.

However, they were merchants. Merchants valued harmony and never participated in the power struggle.

If they acted, it would be against the rules.

“The third trading company in the world, Please Act!”

“Sir Ren, please lend a hand to the bloodshed empire!”

However, the expressions of the people from the life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop changed drastically, and they hurriedly shouted at the old man.

Since things had come to this point, they knew that they had to lend a hand to the bloodshed empire.

If they didn’t help this time, the flowing sea region would belong to the Flowing Emperor Alliance in the future.

With the dragon-phoenix Empire’s rejection of their two factions, they would lose the vast market in the flowing sea region.

This was a considerable loss for the two factions.

“Oh?”

The old man surnamed Ren frowned when he saw the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop open their mouths.

He knew very well that the third trading company in the world was far inferior to these two factions.

However, he also knew that these two factions had encountered some trouble, and no experts could come over.

However, a merchant was a merchant!

He wasn’t prepared to make a move!

“Help the bloody flow empire, and we’ll help you expand a regional market!”

At this moment, the group of people from the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop saw his hesitant expression. They looked at each other and gritted their teeth as they spoke.

“Oh? Everyone, I’m a man of my word!”

The old man widened his eyes. His eyes were filled with light as he asked with incomparable excitement.

“We’ll naturally keep our word!”

The group of people from the life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop nodded.

“Alright!”

“Boom!”

The old man shouted loudly, and a force that far surpassed a level 6 insightful void tier instantly erupted from his body.

“Everyone, why can’t we discuss anything properly? Why do we have to fight to the death!”

He moved and instantly appeared in front of the experts from the bloodshed empire. With a wave of his arm, a sky-blue light barrier appeared out of thin air in front of him.

A single person faced hundreds of thousands of demon beasts without any change in expression!

“Oh? This Is?”

“A seventh-level void interpretation expert! Another seventh-level void interpretation expert!”

“That’s an expert from the third trading company in the world. I didn’t expect that the third trading company in the world would actually have a seventh-level void interpretation expert!”

When the old man appeared in front of bloody flow empire, everyone’s expressions changed drastically.

Yet another invincible expert at the seventh rank of the profound void realm!

A hint of excitement and excitement appeared on the pale faces of the people from bloody flow empire, and they heaved a heavy sigh of relief!
