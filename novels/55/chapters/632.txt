Chapter 633: Attacking Cities and Occupying Land

“Dragon King, after days of investigation by the members of the Dragon Palace, we have decided to attack an area. However, through our investigation, this area isn’t simple!”

After reporting on the matters of the marine races leaping through the dragon gate, Prime Minister Turtle continued with a solemn face.

“Where are we attacking?” Wang Xian looked at Prime Minister Turtle and asked curiously.

“Here!”

To Wang Xian’s surprise, Prime Minister Turtle took out a map as he spoke.

The map had detailed records of the sea region in the vicinity. Prime Minister Turtle had also divided the map into several regions.

Wang Xian looked at the map and raised an eyebrow.

On the map, the white region represented the sea region with a radius of a thousand miles that the Dragon Palace was currently occupying.

Other than that, to the East of the Dragon Palace was a region marked out in black.

Other than the region demarcated in black, there were still regions demarcated in red, and blue. These three regions were clearly separated.

The black region marked out by Prime Minister Turtle seems to be the disordered region. The red region is the area near Japan and the blue area is around India.

Wang Xian looked at the map and thought to himself.

“Are we attacking the black region?” Wang Xian asked.

“Yes, Dragon King. After our investigation, the black region is a place with bountiful resources. Although it is currently occupied by a large number of marine species, we can definitely give it a try with the strength that the Dragon Palace possesses currently!”

“In this piece of sea region, we found a type of treasure called pure blood corals. Consuming these are highly beneficial for marine species!” Prime Minister Turtle explained to Wang Xian.

“Pure blood corals?”

Wang Xian raised an eyebrow. He had heard about the pure blood corals in the disordered region when he was in the sea previously.

Various forces and overseas wandering groups had gathered in that piece of sea region. Even a Sacred Sect had to be careful when entering the area.

“When are you planning to attack?” Wang Xian asked Prime Minister Turtle.

“Right away. I’m thinking of mobilizing three hundred Devil Monkeys and the Anomalocaris race. They will be led by Roving Heavens, the leader of the Anomalocaris race, Roving Girl, and Roving Lobster. Roving Sword will be stationed by the side!”

Prime Minister Turtle continued, “There might be powerful creatures or races in this piece of sea region. We might not be able to occupy it this time, making it mainly a scouting mission!”

“Powerful creatures? Could there be any creature that could match Roving Sword?”

Wang Xian raised an eyebrow.

“Dragon King, the region we are occupying is a region where marine resources are lacking. There aren’t many marine species that have gathered here. The three regions that I have demarcated are regions where there are tremendous resources and races!

“The black region has pure blood corals. Through our investigation, the red region has a deep grand canyon. There are some spiritual objects within it and various terrifying races!

“Strange seabed creatures are densely congregating in the blue region. There should be some mystical objects in that place!”

Prime Minister Turtle introduced each region to Wang Xian.

Mmm!

Wang Xian nodded his head silently. The sea was an incomparably mystical place with various races occupying different areas. “In that case, ask the dragonians to follow me over!”

“Yes, Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Turtle nodded his head.

“Qingyue, Lingxiu, Adjaya! Didn’t you say that it’s a little boring here? Let’s go out for a trip!”

Wang Xian stepped into the Royal Residence Hall and spoke to the three girls.

“Go out? What about Shuqing? Are we leaving her behind alone?” Lan Qingyue looked at Wang Xian and asked.

“Shuqing has made it passed the critical stage. I’ll get Prime Minister Turtle to take care of her. Let’s go on a trip. It won’t take long!” Wang Xian smiled and said to the girls. The girls immediately nodded their heads joyously.

They had been staying in the Dragon Palace for over twenty days. Other than the time they were on the bed making love, they had spent all their time cultivating.

This made them feel a little bored.

“I’ll go inform Xiao Yu and Elder Fang!”

Wang Xian moved and arrived at the peak of a nearby mountain.

Xiao Yu and Elder Fang had dug out a cave abode. Although it wasn’t as luxurious as the Royal Residence Hall, it wasn’t bad at all!

“It’s a great idea to get some rest outside!” Xiao Yu chuckled and followed Wang Xian to the surface of the water.

When Wang Xian boarded the yacht on the surface of the sea, Roving Heavens, the leader of the Anomalocaris race, Roving Lobster, Roving Girl, and Roving Sword had already led the five hundred Dragon Palace members to wait for Wang Xian at the bottom of the sea.

At the same time, Mo Qinglong and the other dragonians would also be following them.

Mo Qinglong had now reached Half-step to Budding Realm while the rest of the dragonians were at the Dan Realm. Overall, they were still a respectable force!

“The Dragon Palace felt more comfortable than the outside world!”

Upon boarding the yacht, Adjaya took a deep breath and frowned instantly.

“That’s to be expected. The spiritual energy in the Royal Residence Hall is several times that of the outside world!”

Wang Xian smiled and nodded his head. He took out a map and said, “We are heading to the disordered region. At the edge of the disordered region, there’s a coral island. That’s our destination and we will be playing there for a few days!”

Wang Xian pointed to an island on the map as he spoke.

“Glacier Coral Island? Great! That’s a famous tourist island. I heard that there’s a spring on the island. Taking a bath there would be great for the skin!” Xiao Yu remarked excitedly.

Wang Xian nodded his head with a smile. “Let’s head towards there then. When we reach it, you girls can play on the island for several days while the members of the Dragon Palace will head towards the disordered region!”

“Alright, let’s go!” the five girls replied with smiles.

Tourism was probably something that every girl was interested in. It was especially so for Xiao Yu. She had not been to many places and was interested to know more about the outside world.

“Put on a clean set of clothes and have some tea!”

Xiao Yu skipped to the second floor of the yacht, changed to a set of clean clothes and poured herself a cup of tea.

Initially, she didn’t have a love for tea. However, these tea leaves were brought back by Wang Xian from the Yong Chang world. Not only would one feel refreshed with just a sip, but they would also want to keep trying the tea.

It was the same for the other girls. After which, they took out their mobile phones.

After being disconnected from the world for a few days, they could finally have some fun.

Wang Xian chuckled while standing by the side. He could sense the Dragon Palace members and the dragonians below him while looking far ahead.

The disordered region spanned a radius of a thousand miles. That was a restricted region for navigation and fishing.

Some old fishermen had circulated that the place was filled with underwater sea monsters and countless ruthless pirates.

Death was almost certain for those who headed there for fishing.

The yacht moved rapidly. After five hours, an island appeared before their eyes.

“We have reached Glacier Coral Island, the island that is ranked in the top five most beautiful islands!”

Xiao Yu looked ahead with anticipation.

Glacier Coral Island was a huge island. The population of the island stood at approximately a million, and fifty percent of the population was made up of tourists.

Wang Xian looked ahead. Ten kilometers ahead of the Glacier Coral Island would be part of the disordered region. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Based on what Prime Minister Turtle said, if we can occupy this area, the Dragon Palace’s strength will increase by two times.

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. The members of the Dragon Palace were here to occupy the region below the sea while the dragonians of the Dragon Sect were here to occupy the sea surface.

The sea would be the territory of the Dragon Palace in the future.
