Chapter 544: Void Space Shattered (3)

“The outcome will be decided soon!”

“Oh gosh! The critical juncture is finally here. I wonder who will win!”

“From what the middle-aged swordsman said, Nie Wushuang isn’t a match for him. Could it be that Sect Leader Nie Wushuang is about to lose?”

“The moment that will decide the fate of the entire Underworld has arrived!”

The sky was shaking and the crowd at the bottom of the tallest peak of Huashan looked at the catastrophic final battles above them in shock.

The battles had reached the most critical moment and the outcome would be known soon.

“There’s no way our sect leader will lose. Never!”

Everyone in Dong Hua Sacred Sect mumbled to themselves as they looked up bitterly.

However, they had a bad premonition weighing over them. In the previous exchanges, that terrifying and merciless swordsman had the upper hand against their sect leader all along.

Moreover, they would probably have a good glimpse of the opponent’s strength after such a long battle.

If the invincible swordsman claimed that Nie Wushuang wasn’t a match for him, he should be at least seventy percent sure that victory was his.

This worried everyone in Dong Hua Sacred Sect.

Similarly, all the people of Diabolism looked fearfully towards the sky. Their backs were drenched in perspiration from anxiety.

“My sword will split the earth. My sword will shake the heavens. My sword will shock the world!”

“Rampaging Heaven and Earth Strike!”

All the golden hair on Nie Wushuang stood up like golden needles. The sword in his hands shook violently.

As the rings hit the blade, sounds of metal clashing reverberated.

Terrifying sword glows formed a violent storm of Heaven and Earth strikes.

The sword glow grew larger and larger to several thousand meters long.

This blade seemed capable of splitting the sky and earth.

The golden glow from the sword resonated with the metal on the ground.

“The pinnacle strike of the golden swordfish race!”

Seeing Nie Wushuang launching his strongest attack, Roving Sword was unmoved. He held on to his longsword with both hands.

Before the golden swordfish race had transformed into human form, they only knew a certain type of attack.

That was none other than lunging ahead with the terrifying bill to pierce through their opponents and enemies.

And now, Roving Sword wasn’t using the Ancient Spiritual Sword Technique.

But the attack that the golden swordfish race had used millions and millions of times.

The pinnacle strike!

Holding the longsword with both hands above his head, he turned into a longsword and charged towards Nie Wushuang with tremendous speed.

The moment he charged forward, an illusory image of a golden swordfish could be seen around Roving Sword.

Just like an ancient god fish, he released an insane sword glow.

“Rampaging Heaven and Earth Strike, Slash!”

Nie Wushuang growled loudly and his voice reverberated throughout Huashan.

“They are going to clash! The outcome will be revealed soon!”

“That’s too scary! Too scary!”

“Move back! Move back! My senses are telling me that the terrifying energy will even reach us!”

In the air, the terrifying energy of the Binary Corpses Co-genesis, Catastrophic Annihilation clashed intensely with the black flames of the Nether Skull.

The Rampaging Heaven and Earth Strike that shrouded the sky was about to crash into the blinding pinnacle strike.

Everyone’s heart was in their throat.

Boom!

An explosion erupted and reverberated across the sky. Below them, the tallest peak of Huashan seemed to be cracking from the insane energy and pressure.

“The Nether Skull is cracking! However, Emperor Qi definitely can’t withstand this strike!”

As Wang Xian saw, the Nether Skull was cracking slowly. For a Level 12 weapon to crack under pressure, one could imagine how insane the power behind that strike was.

“What?”

However, sounds of glass breaking could be heard at this moment.

To Wang Xian’s astonishment, the sky above where Emperor Qi and the Nether Skull clashed was shattering like a piece of glass.

The crack this time was much larger than the one before.

It was as though their clash had broken the limits.

Argh!

Bam! Bam!

After a terrifying cry, Wang Xian could see Emperor Qi overwhelmed by horrifying attacks. As for the Nether Skull, it had completely cracked open under a unique form of energy.

“Shit! The spirit array of the Cauldron World has been broken by us!”

At this moment, Nie Wushuang’s horrified voice resounded.

Wang Xian was alarmed and looked over immediately. At the place where Nie Wushuang clashed with Roving Sword, the void space had been split open completely.

Both of them were sucked into the crack.

Weng!

At this moment, Wang Xian felt an immense attractive force pulling him away.

It was as though he had encountered a black hole pulling his body.

Wang Xian was astonished but couldn’t put up any resistance at all. His body was sucked into the cracks of the void space directly.

This greatly surprised him.

Screech, screech, screech!

The entire sky seemed to be tumbling.

The martial artists below were all shocked and dumbfounded.

“The space was shattered! The void space was completely shattered and the four supreme experts have been sucked into a different dimension!”

“This... What is this all about? What’s the Cauldron World that Sect Leader Nie Wushuang talked about at the very end? What is that?”

“Oh gosh! The shattered space is fixing itself gradually. Could it be that Sect Leader Nie Wushuang, Emperor Qi, Dragon King and that swordsman have entered a different world?”

All the martial artists of the Underworld were shocked.

Bewilderment!

Bewilderment!

The sky was shattered like a piece of glass in the battles between the four supreme experts. Four supreme experts were sucked into it directly.

This...

This...

Before the astounded eyes of the people, the glass-like space was recovering and gradually returned to how it had been before. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The sky was clear once again.

Weng!

At this very moment, the entire world seemed to be shaking. In the vast sky, a cauldron hovered in the air.

However, it disappeared the next instant.

Everyone looked blankly at this mystical scene with their jaws dropped.

“The nine cauldrons! That’s one of the nine cauldrons that stabilized the nation in the past and have since disappeared!”

Nie Wuya looked blankly at the space that was self-repairing, the appearance and disappearance of the cauldron. His eyes widened as he mumbled to himself.

“Nine cauldrons? Sect Leader has gone missing? What kind of space is that? Where would it lead to? What could that place be?”

An old man beside Nie Wuya couldn’t contain his doubts and roared loudly.

“In the Xia Dynasty, the nine cauldrons were forged. In the past, the nine cauldrons stabilized and ensured the stability of the country. In the legends, each cauldron was a terrifying immortal item!

“However, the nine cauldrons disappeared a thousand-plus years ago. The Sect Leader once told me that it wasn’t just the nine cauldrons that disappeared. The Immortal Sects also disappeared!”

Nie Wuya mumbled and didn’t hide anything he knew. His voice resounded throughout the crowd.

“What’s an Immortal Sect? Could there really be real immortals as recorded in the legends? Could it be there’s a different world that coexists along with us?” a middle-aged man exclaimed loudly.

“An Immortal Sect wasn’t rare in ancient times. The reason why they were called Immortal Sects was because they had an Immortal. Those above the Budding Realm are known as Immortals. Based on what our Sect Leader has told me, the Immortal Sect brought along the nine cauldrons to gather spiritual energy and left behind the world to avoid the Age of Dharma Decline!”
