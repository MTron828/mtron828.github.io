Chapter 1043: 1044 the empress who lost her composure

Translator: 5496903

Feng Luan sat there muttering to herself.

There were water stains flowing out from the Teacup on the table.

This was the first time the old woman had seen such a slightly dazed state. It was also the first time she had met the two elders beside her.

Even two years ago, when she met the empress who was only at transcendent level three.

Her body still exuded nobility, determination, and pride.

It was a kind of spirit and demeanor that could look down on the kings of the world. It was the domineering aura that their empress once possessed that shook the entire world. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

It was the first time they saw the empress lose her composure like this.

The first time!

The first time in their lives!

Who was he that the empress mentioned?

Who could make the empress lose her composure like this?

“Call them over. I have something to ask them!”

Feng Luan said to the two elders.

“It’s the Empress!”

The two middle-aged men immediately walked out of the house and called Supervisor Yi and the others in.

“Sir!”

Supervisor Yi and the six others nervously called out to Feng Luan.

They didn’t know Feng Luan’s true identity, but they knew the group of people who had arrived earlier.

The four middle-aged men were all at transcendent level nine.

The four at transcendent level nine wanted to kneel down to the other party. One could imagine that the identity of the veiled woman in front of them was so noble that it was hard for them to imagine.

“Do you know anything about this immortal Phoenix?”

Feng Luan asked manager Yi and the others nervously and expectantly.

“Immortal Phoenix?”

The five shopkeepers looked at manager Yi.

Manager Yi’s expression changed slightly, not knowing how to start.

“Just say what you know. It doesn’t matter if you are certain!”

Feng Luan said directly to supervisor Yi.

“Sir, I have a deep impression of the name ‘Immortal Phoenix’because it’s the opposite of us!”

Supervisor Yi Thought for a moment and said, “About three months ago, a mercenary group appeared in Shenghai Town. It’s called the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group. The leader is a young man!”

“That young man is called Wang Xian...”

When Supervisor Yi mentioned this name, Feng Luan stood up immediately.

The chair rubbed against the ground and made an urgent sound.

The old woman and the two elders beside her had a change in expression. They looked at the Empress in shock!

Even Supervisor Yi was stunned.

“Continue!”

Feng Luan stared at him intently.

“This Wang Xian bought eight million middle-grade spirit stones in our shop at that time. Later on, he bought several tens of millions of middle-grade spirit stones in succession!”

“Furthermore, he helped us solve the crisis of the shop in Shenghai Town. I once asked him why he helped us. He said that he knew people from Feng Xian!”

“Later on, when we met again, it was in Donghai City. He bought five to six hundred million middle-grade spirit stones twice.”

Manager Yi gulped and continued. She suddenly had a premonition.

That mysterious commander Wang might be acquainted with this important figure of their immortal Phoenix.

“Is... is there anyone else beside him?”

Feng Luan’s voice suddenly trembled as she asked.

“Yes, he has eleven subordinates. All of them are middle-aged. Their expressions are very cold. Oh right, they are holding golden longswords in their hands!”

Supervisor Yi continued.

“Crack!”

The Teacup in Feng Luan’s hand was directly crushed. She closed her eyes, but her eyelashes slightly trembled. “Anything else? !”

“Anything else... anything else...”

Supervisor Yi saw Feng Luan’s reaction, after hesitating for a moment, he continued, “A few days ago, that Commander Wang came to the shop in the East District. At that time, I went to deal with the auction with the four lords. Three young ladies and a young master were in the shop. At that time, that young master chased Commander Wang Out!”

“The last time we met was when that commander Wang took out one billion middle-grade spirit stones and bought all the medicinal pills in the life and Death Pill Workshop!”

“From that day onwards, I haven’t seen that Commander Wang!”

After chief Yi finished speaking, he lowered his head.

The old woman at the side looked at the Empress with a face full of shock, her heart fluctuating.

The Empress actually lost her composure!

Why? who was that youth?

“Did you guess that this immortal Phoenix auction was held by Him?”

Feng Luan opened her eyes and asked supervisor Yi.

“Yes, that Commander Wang is very mysterious. He is able to do shocking things every time!”

Supervisor Yi nodded.

“Hu!”

Feng Luan exhaled and was slightly absent-minded.

At that moment, she was almost certain that he had arrived.

At that time, he had said that he would head to the transcendent continent soon. As expected, he had arrived.

“Come, let’s go out!”

A smile appeared on Feng Luan’s face. It was a smile that came from the bottom of her heart.

He had chosen to come to East Sea city and was prepared to develop from there. She did not know why.

It was because her heart wanted to come here.

It was because this place was very close to the passage.

Perhaps one day, when she was really tired, she could go to that world to take a look and relax!

The old woman and the two-meter-tall middle-aged elder were slightly stunned when they saw her smile.

This was the first time they had seen such a smile in the past two years.

All along, the empress had always been tense. Today, it was the first time they had seen the empress so relaxed.

“It’s Her Majesty!”

The old woman smiled and said respectfully.

“Let’s Go!”

Feng Luan smiled and walked outside.

The old woman and the two elders hurriedly followed behind.

Supervisor Yi also followed with slight astonishment.

After walking out of the auction house, Feng Luan looked at the bustling streets and didn’t know where to go.

She randomly chose a direction and walked forward.

She had the bloodline of the Divine Dragon. As long as she wasn’t too far away, she could sense his existence.

Feng Luan looked around.

The old woman following behind looked at her empress’s expression and actions. She felt that the empress seemed to be much more relaxed, which made her smile.

“It’s the evil cloud mercenary group. TSK TSK, they were directly assassinated by the dragon Spike last night. I don’t know who hired the dragon Spike to kill all the members of the evil cloud mercenary group!”

“Who knows? Every member of the evil cloud mercenary group is an old thing. It’s really satisfying to be killed!”

After walking aimlessly for more than an hour, Feng Luan heard a conversation coming from the side and looked over curiously.

When she saw the red paper of double happiness pasted on the door of the room, her face revealed a stunned expression.

“This is the symbol of the dragon assassin group. Congratulations on your death. The appearance of this red paper represents death!”

Director Yi, who was standing at the side, immediately explained when she saw Feng Luan’s curious look.

“Congratulations on your death, Hehe!”

She smiled lightly and her voice became softer. “It was clearly a wedding paper for China’s wedding on Earth, but it was made into a symbol. This guy really has a wicked sense of humor!”

“Dragon Assassin organization. It seems that in just a few short months, you’ve actually established such a powerful assassin organization. Not Bad!”

She muttered softly, stood there and looked, then continued to walk forward.
