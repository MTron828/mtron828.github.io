Translator: 5496903

F * ck you! When holy sea town was in crisis, the insightful emptiness realm expert didn’t come. Instead, he came directly because of his son’s matter. F * ck!

In the front of the Hall of Heroes, Jin Qianyuan couldn’t help but curse out loud.

This made the people around him look surprised. They looked at Mayor Jin.

They didn’t understand why Mayor Jin was so angry.

“Mayor Jin, what’s the situation?”

The president of the hiring association frowned and asked curiously.

“Mayor Lei asked me why I didn’t report to him about the matter of guarding the Holy Sea. He also asked me not to let Lord Wang Xian leave. general hai from the ocean cultivator corps will come here directly!”

Jin Qianyuan said directly with a gloomy face.

“What? Mayor Lei really said that?”

“F * ck, they are a bunch of shameless people. Star-moon kingdom has already given up on us. They want us to report to them immediately and even want to kill Lord Wang!”

“F * ck, when the Holy Sea town was in crisis, not a single void interpretation stage expert came. Now, because of the general’s son, a void interpretation stage expert came directly. They don’t even treat everyone in holy sea town as human beings!”

“Hehe, our lives are not as important as the general’s son. Mayor Jin, tell them to scram. They even want to kill Sir Wang Xian. Even if we were to fight it out with him, we wouldn’t agree to it!”

“That’s right. Our lives were given by Sir Wang Xian. What is the star-moon kingdom? I am no longer a member of the star-moon kingdom in the future!”

When the people around heard Mayor Jin’s voice, they were all enraged.

The holy sea town did not come when they needed the help of an insightful emptiness realm expert the most.

Now, because of the death of a general’s son, an insightful emptiness realm expert came directly. Moreover, the person that the general wanted to kill was the savior of their holy sea town.

This action instantly made everyone extremely furious.

If the people of Holy Sea Town were already disheartened by the fact that the star-moon kingdom did not come to save them, now that they had done such a thing, it would make them angry and even murderous.

“As long as the ocean cultivator army dares to touch Sir Wang Xian, we will fight them with swords and knives!”

An old man said with a face full of anger.

Jin Qianyuan stood there and stared at the communication stone plate. When he heard the words of the people around him, his expression changed drastically.

“In the future, all of us will no longer be people of the star-moon kingdom. F * ck, this is simply going too far!”

He raised his head with a cold expression and roared loudly.

“Fine, F * ck off to the star-moon Kingdom!”

“F * cking star-moon kingdom, let them die!”

The surrounding people roared loudly.

“HMPH!”

Jin Qianyuan snorted coldly. His gaze looked towards the communication stone plate and immediately began to reply.

“Where were you when our holy sea town was about to be destroyed and everyone was about to be killed? Abandoned the city and fled? Report to you? Who Do you think you are?”

“When our holy sea town was about to be destroyed, you didn’t send an insightful emptiness realm expert over. Now, because of the son of a general, an insightful emptiness realm expert directly came over. Hehe, you still want our benefactor to wait for you to kill him? Scram!”

“In the future, holy sea town will no longer belong to star-moon kingdom. You Don’t have the right to order me!”

Jin Qianyuan furiously spoke one after another. Following that, he directly cut off the connection with City Lord Lei.

...

“He’s rebelling! He’s rebelling!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, in the Eastern Sea City Lord’s Manor, when City Lord Lei saw the message Jin Qianyuan sent over, he stood up furiously and slammed the table heavily as he roared with a frosty expression.

The surrounding people were slightly stunned as they looked at City Lord Lei.

“What’s going on?”

Tsunami Heaven looked at him and asked in a deep voice.

“The mayor of holy sea town is so rebellious. He actually said that holy sea town will no longer belong to star-moon kingdom in the future. I think this ant wants to rebel!”

Lei Feihu roared with a cold gaze.

“Rebel!”

Everyone was slightly shocked, and their faces sank.

A small mayor actually dared to rebel?

“I’ll lead some soldiers of the ocean corps over and kill them directly!”

Tsunami Sky’s eyes were filled with killing intent.

“Alright, a bunch of ants from sacred sea town want to rebel. We’ll kill them first and report to them later!”

City Lord Lei also roared in a low voice filled with killing intent.

In order to ensure the safety of East Sea City, the city Lord and General of East Sea City were forbidden to leave the city without orders. However, they wouldn’t follow orders outside.

In a situation like this, they could kill them first and report to them later.

“I’ll bring my men and set off immediately!”

Tsunami Heaven grabbed the huge sword in front of him and strode out.

“HMPH, a bunch of fellows who are courting death!”

Castellan lei realized that he had cut off the connection with the mayor of Shenghai Town. He narrowed his eyes and muttered under his breath.

...

“Sir Wang Xian, there’s something bad!”

In the mayor’s residence, Jin Qianyuan and the experts of Shenghai town walked over and spoke to him with a bad expression.

“About the wanted poster?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and asked them.

“There’s one more thing!”

Jin Qianyuan took a deep breath and said, “Just now, Mayor Lei came to interrogate me and told me that the general of the ocean cultivators’army is coming to kill you!”

“However, I will tell you directly that the holy sea town will no longer belong to the star-moon Kingdom!”

Jin Qianyuan said with a sullen face.

“No longer belong to the star-moon kingdom?”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned. He looked at Jin Qianyuan and said, “This is treason!”

“What country? A country that even its own people are unwilling to protect. Why should we give them the tax for the Grand Competition every year?”

Jin Qianyuan said with some sarcasm.

“It’s fine if they didn’t come to save us. Now, they still want to kill you, Sir Wang. Naturally, we will not agree to it. So what if we sentence the star-moon kingdom?”

An elder beside him said with some anger.

Wang Xian looked at them. He was slightly touched. It was not in vain for him to save them.

This could also be considered as betraying the country for him!

Wang Xian smiled faintly and looked at them. “Don’t worry. I will give you a stable residence and a safe place to stay!”

“Sir Wang Xian, you don’t have to worry about anything. The strength of the array formation in our holy sea town can not be compared to that of star-moon kingdom. Even if the entire army of ocean cultivators comes, what can they do to us?”

Jin Qianyuan smiled and said with a carefree expression.

Wang Xian smiled and nodded. “We will have a result after waiting for more than ten days!”

At the same time, a wanted notice caused the entire holy sea town to be in an uproar.

Everyone knew the cause and effect. This made everyone in the entire holy sea town extremely furious.

One by one, the citizens shouted that as long as the army of ocean cultivators came, they would fight to the death against them.

At this moment, news came from the city guards. The mayor had already announced to the city lord of East Sea city that holy sea town would no longer belong to star-moon kingdom.

In the face of this act of treason, there was not the slightest expression on everyone’s faces.

Treason, then treason!

A country is not benevolent, I am not righteous!
