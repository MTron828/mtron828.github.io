Chapter 317: By Merits?

Grr grr grr!

The Devil Monkeys growled. The entire Spiritual Island trembled as their voices blasted through the air.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes briefly as he headed towards the center of the Spiritual Island.

With him was Roving Heavens. With a wooden rod measuring five to six meters resting on his shoulders, he followed alongside Wang Xian with a ferocious look.

“What’s that noise?” a voice quivered.

Just then, Inborn experts from the Lei Family, Water Separation Island, and Wind God Sect were at the Spiritual Medicine Garden, when they heard the growling of the Devil Monkeys. To which, their faces winced as they darted their eyes around hastily.

“Seems like animals growling, and in large numbers!” one panicked.

“Don’t tell me monsters have ascended on Spiritual Island?” the second guessed.

“That can’t be. How could sea monsters get on the island? They must be growling in the waters, but do not approach” another reassured.

“Those hair-raising footprints on the island...could they have come from the same monster?” a voice asked.

As it was nighttime, other than the casting of faint moonlight, they were surrounded by pitch-dark on this lone island in the middle of the sea.

Peering into the distance around them, it felt like they were situated amidst an abyss. Given such circumstances, disciples of the three forces could not help but shiver.

Especially with the growling earlier; the way it sounded and felt had petrified them all the more.

“Something’s approaching!” an Inborn expert cried out, jerking his head to the right while doing so.

“Many of them!” another Inborn expert added as he turned right as well.

“What?” the rest of the disciples behind exclaimed. Taking one deep gulp, they too looked in the same direction in utter panic.

They were not being timid. Instead, having witnessed the Yakshas around the Spiritual Island, along with the alarming footprints inland, it became too overwhelming.

They were already in fear of the creatures out at sea.

“Haha! Like I’ve said, all of you shall die. All of you!” voices laughed. It was Mo Qinglong, Mo Yuan and Mo Shiwu who were lying at a side, resting. They shot up excitedly upon hearing the growls.

Bearing with their physical pains the best they could, they swept their glance coldly across the three forces ahead.

“Shut up!” an Inborn expert snapped as he eyed the trio. With the swing of an arm, he blasted a bout of energy towards the trio.

Bam, bam!

The energy struck directly at Mo Qinglong and gang, which sent them flying seven to eight meters back, before crashing on the floor.

Had it not been for their strong constitution, they would have long been killed by the blows!

“Who are you trying to scare? Fear not, even if the sea creatures should ascend on the island. Their combat abilities would diminish greatly!” an Inborn expert assured. As he did, he raised his long sword, which was flickering with laser lights.

Inhaling deeply, the disciples crowding around clutched onto their weapons.

Grrr, grrr!

As faint, deep growls which sounded like panting approached closer by the second, they sent a faint tremor across the grounds.

Several hundred from the three forces gazed intently at the area ahead.

Boom, boom, boom!

“It has appeared!” someone announced.

“It’s coming!” another yelled.

With a murderous demeanor, all men from the three forces braced themselves. They looked ahead at the shadows, which were gradually emerging.

Swish!

Waving an arm, an Inborn expert lit up the sky ahead with a blinding flame.

Boom!

The flame also revealed what was in front of them. At the sight of the figures ahead, everyone stared with eyes wide, in shock.

Under the bright lights, a group of creepy but human-like creatures emerged from about five hundred meters ahead. They were moving towards the crowd, slowly and steadily.

They were mammoth-like in size, reaching beyond two meters in height, with the tallest standing at almost six meters. They were also surrounded by balls of black gases winding around their bodies.

“What ... what are those?” an Inborn expert muttered in a low voice, as he looked ahead with a cringing face.

There were too many of these black human-like creatures, so much so that they had way over-numbered the crowd of disciples.

“Some of them look like monkeys!” an Inborn expert commented. While he squinted at the creatures for a closer look, he gripped his weapon more tightly.

“Fear not. They’re just creatures similar to the Water Monkeys!” an Inborn expert from the Lei Family signaled to the disciples behind.

As the two sides were closing in at about two hundred meters, Wang Xian could see Mo Qinglong and gang lying by the side.

“Who is it? Who gave you the audacity to attack my men?” Wang Xian asked the group of three forces as he eyed them indifferently.

Surprised by the noise, the crowd immediately threw their gaze over in Wang Xian’s direction.

“Huh? There’s someone in there?” a voice questioned.

“To think there’s someone across, who’s controlling the group of creatures?” another asked. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Only the unknown would be feared. They were actually more relieved than not, when they realized that the group of creatures was under the control of a human.

An Inborn expert from the Lei Family swept his gaze past the group of Devil Monkeys. With eyes narrowed, he tightened his fists.

“Brother, this is Elder Lei here. I think there must be some misunderstanding between us. I seek your understanding, should we have offended you in any way!” the elder said to Wang Xian.

“I’m asking you. Who gave you guys the courage to attack my men?” Wang Xian questioned again, ignoring Elder Lei, this time in an eerily low pitch.

With a change of stance, three Devil Monkeys scrambled over to Mo Qinglong and gang, and lifted them off the ground.

“Young Master, the three forces here have made an alliance. They challenged us to take the things here away, based on merits!” Mo Qinglong reported to Wang Xian with a pale face.

“Hmph!” Wang Xian nodded in acknowledgment. This was followed by a powerful bout of the Azure Dragon’s Energy which was channeled into the trio’s bodies, healing them as it went.

“By merits, huh? If that’s the case, we’ll go by merits then!” Wang Xian concluded. He looked casually at the three forces as he nodded, and continued, “If that’s the case, we’ll play by your rules!”

“Huh?” the crowd from the three forces frowned.

An elder from Water Separation Island contemplated, while his facial expression changed in tandem with his thoughts. He trailed off, “Brother, you possess strong powers, so you’re qualified to a share of the Spiritual Treasures on this island...!”

“That’s right, we’re willing to share the Spiritual Treasures here with you!” another added.

“We acknowledge your powers, so that makes you qualified...” a few elders patronized.

“But you guys are not!” Wang Xian cut them off even before they could end their sentences. With that, he ordered swiftly, “Kill them!”

Ack, ack, ack!

Just as Wang Xian concluded his sentence, Roving Heavens lifted his head and roared towards the sky. The long rod which rested on his shoulders crashed onto the ground.

Boom!

With a low rumble, Roving Heavens stared ahead with its eyes bloodshot. Slowly but steadily, it uttered in human language, “Kill! Kill!”

All around, the Devil Monkeys complemented loud growls, followed by a gust of demonic aura purging out of their bodies.

Boom!

As they transformed into numerous black shadows, they swooped straight at the hundreds from the three forces.
