Chapter 2966: battle, Chimei Territory vs Dragon Palace

“Roar Roar Roar!”

Terrifying roars sounded in the starry sky of Chimei territory. Five enormous demon caves shuttled through the void.

Six Level 5 god Emperor Yao Xie stood at the exit of the Demon Cave. Their cold and bloodthirsty eyes stared at the void in front of them, appearing extremely irritable. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Yao Xie had reached the god Emperor realm, so they already possessed some intelligence.

!!

They knew that they lived in the region of the resplendent starry sky, and they also knew of the seven great regions.

However, because of the characteristics of the demon lair, they could be summoned to another starry sky. Therefore, many demonic beasts were summoned to another starry sky when they were not too strong. They would develop in that starry sky and increase their strength.

Once they returned, they would never be able to return to that starry sky. They could only sense other summons and go to an unfamiliar starry sky. The danger would increase drastically.

This resulted in the ordinary demonic beasts staying there if they occupied a patch of starry sky. After all, it was their territory.

The reason why they returned this time was for this supreme treasure of their chimei territory, the ghost flower.

The ghost flower had a huge effect on their demonic beasts. After devouring the mature ghost flower, it could allow the fifth level divine emperor Demonic Beasts to break through.

However, when they were fighting for the ghostly flower, a human suddenly appeared and snatched it away.

That was their hope of breaking through.

This made the six evil spirits’eyes filled with anger and rage.

Humans, destroy all humans!

According to their understanding of this starry sky, the five great demon dens immediately rushed towards the star area where humans lived.

Halfway through, they discovered that the other demon dens and evil spirits in the chimei territory had all disappeared. This made the evil spirits’leaders immediately suspect the humans!

Kill! Kill! Kill!

Cold killing intent filled the entire chimei territory, and a violent aura swept across the starry sky.

“TSK, TSK, tsk. It’s really slow, but it’s good that it’s slow. I’ll wait for the members of the Dragon Palace to improve, and when the Dragon King improves, I’ll kill you all!”

“After I kill you all, I should be able to improve, hahaha!”

In the void next to them, an lie was constantly monitoring the five demon dens, and his face was full of relief.

“Roar!”

At the same time, an excited roar sounded in the Dragon Palace.

Wang Xian turned into his dragon form and crouched in the Dragon Palace. His face was filled with excitement.

He had advanced one level!

He quickly absorbed the energy of the ghost flower. In less than a day, he had achieved a breakthrough.

Moreover, he had not even absorbed one-tenth of the energy of the ghost flower.

“Continue!”

Wang Xianlong’s eyes sparkled with excitement as he continued to absorb.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Time passed quickly. One day later, excited roars sounded from the dragon transformation pool.

From the dragon transformation pool, experts from the Dragon Palace flew out one by one. Their faces were filled with excitement.

“Hahaha, the combat strength of a level four divine emperor!”

“Awesome, so awesome!”

Excited voices sounded, and members of the Dragon Palace flew to the side of the dragon transformation pool.

“Congratulations!”

Beside the Dragon Transformation Pool, Prime Minister GUI said to the experts of the Dragon Palace with a smile.

“Hehe, Prime Minister Gui, where’s the Dragon King? With our current strength, those two demon caves can easily destroy him!”

Ba Qi flew over and asked excitedly.

“The Dragon King is improving. Great changes have taken place in the chimei domain. Now, there are three more demon caves and four level-five celestial emperor demonic leaders!”

“Now, those five demon caves are flying towards the glazed domain. I guess they want to wreak havoc on humans. We have to stop them before they fly out of the chimei domain and destroy them!”

Prime Minister Gui said.

“Oh? There are three demon caves and four fifth-level divine emperors? Prime Minister Gui, how strong are the five demon caves?”

Tian Chen immediately asked.

“There are six fifth-level divine emperors, twenty-five fourth-level divine emperors, and more than seven hundred other divine emperors.”

Prime Minister Gui replied.

“Their high-end combat strength is stronger than ours. However, we have many divine emperors in the Dragon Palace, so it’s not a big problem to fight them!”

Mo Sha and the others said.

Tian Chen and the others also nodded.

“An lie has obtained a very high-level divine herb in the chimei domain, and now the Dragon King is improving. If the Dragon King can break through to the divine emperor realm, the Dragon King can destroy all of them by himself.”

“Even if he can’t break through to the divine emperor realm, according to the Dragon King, he can have the combat strength of a fifth-level divine emperor. By then, with the Dragon King, we have a great chance to destroy all five demon caves.”

Prime Minister Gui said with a smile.

“Oh? As long as the Dragon King can break through, everything will be simple!”

Tian Chen and the others said.

“Now, let’s Get Ready. All the members of the divine emperor and the 800,000 members of the Dragon Palace will attack. This battle is to train the soldiers and sweep through the Chimei Territory!”

Prime Minister Gui ordered.

“Yes!”

All the members of the Dragon Palace answered immediately.

“Prepare in the dragon field in ten minutes!”

Prime Minister Gui waved his arm and the group of leaders immediately went to prepare.

Ten minutes later, the 800,000 members of the Dragon Palace entered the teleportation array and arrived at a planet at the border between the glazed domain and the chimei territory.

There was a dragon palace on this planet. Beside this planet was an incomparably huge devil cave.

Void God Emperor Rank Three Devil Cave.

This Devil Cave was used by an lie for teleportation, making it more convenient for him.

“Let’s control the Chi Mei region void space in front of this Devil Cave!”

Ao he said to Prime Minister Gui and the rest.

“Alright, by controlling this Devil Cave, we can make an lie come over instantly. After the Dragon King improves, he will be able to rush over as well!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded.

“Leave the rest to our devouring Dragon!”

Ao he said, turning into a devouring dragon, the other million devouring dragons crawled out from his body.

Along with the devouring dragon, 1.8 million Dragon Palace Warriors, the weakest undying level 8.

With so many resources in the Chi Mei region, the other disciples of the Dragon Palace had also risen greatly.

The current Dragon Palace was definitely very terrifying.

With these powers, even if the Dragon King did not come, they were confident in defeating the five demon caves. However, they did not have the confidence to kill the leader of the demon caves.

“Let’s Go!”

Ao crab gave an order and the demon cave flew quickly toward the chimei zone.

“Sky array, Duan Jinming, see if you can turn this demon cave into a war machine. If possible, our Dragon Palace will build one.”

Prime Minister Gui looked at the Demon Cave and asked sky array.

“I have the same idea, but it’s better to build a higher-level demon cave so that we can fly faster.”

Sky array nodded and said.

“After we destroy the chimei territory, our dragon palace will be completely stabilized. We can build some war machines to improve our strength!”

Prime Minister Gui suggested with a smile.
