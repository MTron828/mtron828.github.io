Chapter 1164: 1165 kill the prince

Translator: 5496903

“Boom!”

“Hualala!”

It was five o’clock in the morning, but today’s Dawn was much later than usual.

The light rain had turned into a heavy downpour.

The heavy rain fell from the sky, causing the dawn to arrive later today.

The streets that were originally crowded at five o’clock were now empty.

The heavy rain was when the ocean beasts were active. Usually, in this kind of weather, few mercenary groups went out to do missions.

The east gate was much calmer than before.

“Brothers, it’s raining heavily today, so we won’t go out of the city. Have a good rest for a day!”

“Okay boss, Haha, then Let’s Go to the Carpe House today and have a good time!”

“You Brat, you’re really young and impetuous. Don’t use up all your strength to kill Beasts!”

“Don’t worry boss, my body is very powerful!”

In a mercenary group base not far away from the East Gate, a group of Men’s laughter was heard at five or six o’clock.

An old man looked at the members of the mercenary group who were playing around and took out his communication stone plate, ready to look at the latest information.

“Huh? What’s the situation?”

Suddenly, the old man’s eyes focused. He looked at a message on the Bright Moon City Forum in astonishment.

The hottest topics these two days were undoubtedly undercurrent and dragon spike.

Both undercurrent and dragon Spike had published information on the forum.

Therefore, the whole bright moon city knew the names of undercurrent and dragon spike.

The old man stared at the information released by the Dragon Spike Assassin organization on the communication stone plate.

He opened it and saw only one line of words.

“Go to the east gate, there’s a surprise!”

Seven words, very simple seven words, made the old man’s face full of surprise.

“Hey, Little Bear, let’s go, let’s go to the city gate and have a look!”

The old man thought for a moment, then shouted to a middle-aged man beside him.

“Eh? Uncle Zhang, what’s the situation?”

The middle-aged man who was talking to a few young men looked at the old man with confusion.

“The Dragon Assassin organization has directly announced on the forum that they are going to the east gate. There’s a surprise. Let’s go and take a look!”

The old man said with some curiosity.

“Going to the East Gate? There’s a surprise? Sent by the Dragon Assassin Organization?”

“What is the Dragon Assassin organization doing now?”

“The East Gate? When Dragon Spike first came to Bright Moon City, he hung the corpses of the undercurrent master’s son and the undercurrent ace assassin at the East Gate. Could it be?”

In an instant, a few members of the mercenary group guessed in surprise.

“Let’s go and take a look, uncle Zhang!”

The middle-aged man said to the old man with a puzzled face and walked outside.

They were very close to the east gate.

When they walked out of the house, the sound of heavy rain came from outside. However, the heavy rain didn’t affect them very much.

The group of people walked out curiously. When they walked out, they found that there were still many people walking toward the east gate.

Obviously, they had also seen the message that dragon Spike had posted on the forum.

“Oh my God, this is crazy! The Sky is falling! Dragon Spike and the others are crazy!”

“What is dragon spike doing? Is this true? This is simply too crazy! Oh My God, are they going against the heavens?”

“The Prince, the third Prince of star-moon kingdom. I really can’t believe it. How dare dragon Spike! How dare he!”

When the group arrived at the East Gate, they heard a shocked and unbelievable voice coming from the front.

They looked forward in astonishment.

“What’s that? There’s a corpse on it!”

They looked up and widened their eyes. It was not out of their expectations that there was a corpse on the city wall.

Besides a corpse, there was a big red piece of paper beside it.

On the paper, there were a few lines of words.

Corpse: the third Prince of star-moon Kingdom!

The dragon Spike had already arrived at Bright Moon City, and darkness had already covered it. Anyone who tried to stop it would be the dragon Spike’s enemy.

City Lord Manor, you have worked together with undercurrent to use the city protection array to monitor and deal with us, the dragon spike. Since that’s the case, I’ll give you a great gift!

Today, the corpse of the third Prince of star-moon kingdom will be presented!

If the city Lord Manor and star-moon kingdom obstruct the dragon Spike’s footsteps!

We Will: Kill! Kill! Kill!

Six lines of words were written on a red piece of paper. Under the heavy rain, the ink had already scattered.

However, these words were like thick blood on the red paper under the rain, causing one’s heart to palpitate.

“This...”

Seeing the six lines of words, the group was completely stunned.

“How is this possible? Third Prince, that corpse is the third prince. This is impossible, this is impossible. How can the dragon spike be so crazy!”

A terrifying expression appeared on the faces of the group of people.

The third prince was the son of the king of star-moon kingdom, the son of the strongest person in the kingdom.

It was not an exaggeration to say that if the third prince wanted them to die, they would have to die.

Moreover, they understood the third prince a little. He wasn’t the most outstanding among the princes, but he was still quite powerful.

He was one of the most advantageous competitors for the throne.

Yet, he actually died in bright moon city, and was actually assassinated by the dragon’s Thorn.

His corpse was even hung on the city wall!

There were also a few words that threatened the city Lord’s estate and even star-moon kingdom.

Threatening the city Lord’s estate and star-moon kingdom? Wasn’t this too F * cking crazy?

“Is this dragon spike going to turn the sky upside down? He actually dares to do such a terrifying thing!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Everyone who had arrived felt their heads go numb as they looked at the corpse and the words.

The dragon Spike’s actions this time could no longer be described as arrogant.

He was a complete lunatic, a naked lunatic.

Otherwise, how could he dare to do such a thing.

Was he trying to make star-moon kingdom an enemy?

Was he trying to make star-moon kingdom angry?

He still dared to be so unbridled in star-moon kingdom’s territory!

He was simply a madman.

The master of undercurrent was called a madman, but in the past few decades, the undercurrent assassin organization had not dared to assassinate star-moon kingdom’s officials.

Although the master of undercurrent was wild and unbridled, he would not offend star-moon kingdom.

However, this dragon Spike had directly killed the prince and threatened star-moon kingdom.

This was going against the heavens!

This was no longer something that a madman could describe, but madness!

A portion of people did not dare to believe it!

“Boom Boom!”

“Boom Boom!”

At this moment, two terrifying figures flew over.

City Lord Liu and the general of the Bright Moon Army flew over.

When they heard the news, they were a little stunned. They didn’t dare to believe it at first.

They dared to kill their prince? They were simply courting death!

How could someone dare?

But when they couldn’t contact the prince, they immediately panicked!

“Your Highness, the third Prince!”

City Lord Liu, who was flying over, had an extremely unsightly expression. He looked at the corpse on the city wall.

When he saw that familiar figure, his eyes slowly reddened as he roared.

“Third Prince, Your Highness!”

The Bright Moon Army general at the side also had a face full of shock as he roared loudly!

“Weng!”

Everyone’s minds jolted.

It really was the prince!
