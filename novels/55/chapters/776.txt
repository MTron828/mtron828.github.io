“Boom!”

A life-and-death battle!

A life-and-death battle between the Dragon Gate and the Holy Medicine Immortal sect!

The conversation between the Dragon King and the Holy Medicine Immortal Sect’s sect master thoroughly stirred up all the disciples of the immortal sect in the surroundings.

“A life-and-death battle between young disciples. Is this a complete massacre? How can there be such hatred between the Dragon Gate and the Holy Medicine Immortal Sect? !”

“It’s said that the Dragon King has exterminated the clansmen of the previous two immortal sects in the real world!”

“The Dragon King is not rational. The Holy Medicine Immortal Sect and the Holy Medicine Immortal sect have been passed down for thousands of years and have an unfathomable foundation. On the surface, they already have two middle-level immortals, eight lower-level immortals, and tens of millions of disciples. How can the Dragon Gate Compare with the Holy Medicine Immortal sect and the Holy Medicine Immortal Sect? !”

“This is the dignity of immortals. If the Dragon King doesn’t express his stance, I’m afraid that the disciples of the Holy Medicine Immortal sect and the Holy Doctor Immortal sect will continue to provoke them. Then, the Dragon sect will lose a lot of face in the future!”

“I heard that in order to appear in the world, the Holy Medicine Immortal Sect and the Holy Doctor Immortal sect have taken out many precious medicinal pills. There are more than a dozen infant realm experts among the disciples under the age of forty. I heard that Hua Gujiang, the strongest disciple of the two immortal sects, has already reached the half-step immortal realm!”

The group of immortal sect disciples discussed in a low voice. Their faces were filled with astonishment.

The Dragon sect versus the Holy Doctor Immortal sect and the Holy Medicine Immortal sect was a major event in the martial arts world, especially the life-and-death battle. It was a battle that would not stop until one of them died.

“Haha, in the martial arts world, I, the Dragon King, have never been afraid of anyone. I hope that one of us will survive in the near future!”

When Wang Xian heard the arrogant laughter of the sect leader of the Holy Medicine sect, he laughed out loud as well. He stared at them fearlessly.

“Good, good!”

Upon hearing Wang Xian’s words, the faces of all the immortals from the Holy Medicine sect and the Holy Medicine sect darkened.

“I hope the Dragon King will remember what you said today!”

Their eyes were filled with a crazy killing intent as they stared at Wang Xian coldly.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian stared at them without showing any signs of weakness. His eyes were also filled with coldness.

What was there to fear from the two immortal sects!

“Hiss!”

All the disciples of the immortal sects around sucked in a breath of cold air. Even if they were not fighting together, this tit-for-tat aura still caused everyone’s scalps to go numb and their hearts to be filled with fear!

“This Dragon King is indeed the same as what was recorded in the information!”

The two supreme elders of the Xuan Yuan clan and the Yuwen clan looked at each other.

All the other immortal gods shook their heads slightly, which was exactly the same as what was recorded in the information.

No matter who the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate was, as long as he provoked him, he would never lower his head.

Many people were still very afraid of such a force.

However, the two immortal sects, Holy Medicine and holy doctor, were not among them. All the immortal gods were filled with fear, even fear, towards these two immortal sects that were closely related to each other.

Even the Xuan Yuan clan didn’t dare to say that they didn’t take them seriously.

The combined strength of these two immortal sects was definitely much more terrifying than on the surface.

“Xu Yuanjia of the True Martial Immortal Academy!”

The atmosphere was silent for a while. Then, a disciple of the true martial immortal academy moved his body and flew directly onto the arena.

He cupped his hands towards the surroundings and then stared coldly at the Strange Thorn clan.

“Does anyone from the strange thorn tribe dare to fight with me? I hope that you won’t be afraid!”

“There is a conflict between the true Martial Immortal Academy and the Strange Thorn tribe. When they first appeared in this world, there was a conflict between them, which led to a battle between Immortals!”

“The Dragon Gate and the Holy Medicine Holy Doctor sect have made a start. The real battle is about to begin!”

The True Martial Immortal Academy and the Strange Thorn tribe had a grudge against each other. The Yongchang Immortal sect and the Ji tribe had a conflict. Furthermore, there was a conflict between the immortal sects in the Yongchang region and the immortal sects in the Ji Ding region.

The life-and-death battle between Wang Xian and the sect leader of the Holy Medicine Immortal sect could be considered to have started.

Intense battles began one after another. The entire Heaven’s pride grand competition was more intense than expected, and it was still brutal.

The victorious disciples of the immortal sect cheered, mocked, and provoked.

The defeated Immortal sect could only watch with an embarrassed expression.

“This is not a heaven’s pride grand competition at all, but a game between Immortals and gods!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

On the stage, Sun Lingxiu looked at the battles below and said with a frown.

“That’s right. Immortals and gods are forbidden to fight. We have to settle our grudges somewhere else!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. He finally understood that the so-called competition between heaven’s favorites was a competition between the immortal sects.

At first, he thought of not letting the disciples of the Dragon Gate fight. But now, it seemed like... Hehe!

Since they had made a move, they would regret it a lot and let them know the outcome.

The competition went on, and the smell of gunpowder gradually subsided.

Some disciples of the Immortal Gate who had no grudges went up to fight for the 21 spots.

Those who could come out to fight were at least in the infant stage.

The disciples of the Dan stage and half-step Dan stage didn’t have the information to go up to the stage.

It was a true battle between heaven’s favorites and the core disciples of the immortal sects.

“It’s almost certain now that the Xuanyuan clan has four people in the top 21, the Yuwen Clan has two, the Wild Beast Immortal sect has three, and the Holy Medicine Holy Doctor Immortal sect has four. The powerful immortal sects occupy a lot of places, and many of the weaker immortal sect disciples can’t even make it into the top 21!”

“The first place is almost certainly in the hands of these gods!”

“Tomorrow, Longmen will have a life-and-death battle with the Holy Medicine sect. I’m really looking forward to it!”

As the sun slowly set, the surrounding disciples of the immortal sect whispered to each other. Twenty-one spots were almost certain.

In one day’s battle, three disciples of the immortal sect died in the battle, which could be said to be very intense.

Some immortal sects were also full of gunpowder. The battle was very fierce. However, what everyone was looking forward to the most was the life-and-death battle between the Dragon Gate and the Holy Medicine Holy Doctor Immortal Sect Tomorrow.

“Twenty-one spots have been created. The final battle will be held in the next two days. Today’s competition is over!”

“If you have nothing to do, you can go sightseeing in our Xuanyuan city. It will still be the same time tomorrow!”

The grand elder of the Xuanyuan clan slowly stood up and faced everyone.

“Let’s Go!”

The Immortal Gods stood up and flew directly toward their respective peaks, while the other disciples followed closely behind.

“Disciples of the Dragon Gate, don’t be a coward!”

“Haha, in the Battle Tomorrow, I, Hua Gujiang, will lead the disciples of the two great immortal sects and kill all of You!”

At this moment, the disciples of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect laughed loudly and flew away with ease behind the immortal God.

“HMPH, you’ll Be Crying Tomorrow!”

Xiao Yu couldn’t help but shout loudly.

“This is going to be interesting!”

“The Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect is at a complete advantage now. I reckon that the Dragon Gate is going to be in Danger Tomorrow!”

“The Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Sect’s Hua Gujiang has personally spoken. Among the young disciples, Hua Gujiang can be ranked in the top five. On the other hand, the Dragon Gate doesn’t have a single one. The winner will be decided immediately!”

When the surrounding disciples saw this scene, they whispered among themselves.

“Hua Gujiang? HMPH, he’s really courting death. Xiao Yu alone can wipe out all the elite disciples of their two great immortal sects!”

At the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect’s position, Feng Lingtian saw this scene and said disdainfully.

Ling Xiao, who was at the side, nodded slowly and then frowned.

“Between disciples, a single little feather can crush all the disciples of the Holy Medicine, Holy Medicine, and Immortal sect, but the dragon gate is still much weaker in terms of combat power at the immortal God level. There might be huge trouble in the future!”
