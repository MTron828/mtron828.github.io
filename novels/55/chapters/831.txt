“Dragon King, Our Dragon Palace has added another six Immortals!”

Time passed very quickly. It had been two days since the last time they killed the gods of the Garden of Eden. Prime Minister Gui came to Wang Xian’s side and said happily.

The eight corpses of the gods of the Garden of Eden were absorbed by the Dragon Pool and turned into energy. This allowed the six members of the Dragon Palace to reach the realm of immortals.

This dragon pool could be said to be a huge cheating device. As long as it absorbed energy, a large amount of dragon blood could be produced.

Now, with the addition of the eight-limbed and crab generals, the number of immortals in the Dragon Palace had reached an astonishing 42.

“It might not be long before the immortals in the Dragon Palace can overturn the entire world!”

Wang Xian revealed a confident expression. This would take four to five years at most, or even faster.

“How is the search for information about the western divine realm coming along? And about the invasion of the other seas, how are the preparations going?”

Wang Xian asked Prime Minister Gui.

“Dragon King, the strange demon has not gotten much information about the western divine realm. The divine realm is a huge formation. Once we enter, we will be discovered. We are already making preparations for the invasion of the other seas. Tomorrow, Ao Qitian will lead a group of Immortals and members of the Dragon Palace to battle. I believe that we will be able to completely control the entire sub-continent’s seas in no time!”

Prime Minister Gui replied.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. He couldn’t be the commander in chief of the expedition to the ocean. When there were no creatures of the superior immortal level, he didn’t need to take action at all.

The fastest way for the Dragon Palace to develop was to use the corpses of Immortals to nurture immortals.

This was also the reason why Wang Xian took action to kill the gods in the Garden of Eden.

It wasn’t just because their actions made him unhappy. It wasn’t just because of the matter with the puppet immortal sect.

“Brother, the grand elder of the Xuan Yuan clan asked me to inform you of something!”

At this moment, Xiao Yu’s voice came from above. Wang Xian looked up and smiled. “What is it?”

“Here, this is an envelope. The grand elder of the Xuan Yuan clan said that the ancient Greek divine realm and the Garden of Eden Divine Realm wanted to talk to us about the eight gods being killed by the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian threw an envelope over and said to him.

“Oh? I thought they would attack us directly!”

The corners of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly. He opened the envelope and read the contents.

The ancient Greek divine territory and the Garden of Eden Divine Territory invited the Dragon Palace to Wuwei Island to talk about the gods being killed in the Garden of Eden.

The eight gods were killed. Naturally, the Garden of Eden Divine Territory wanted to take revenge. However, with their current strength, they were no match for the Dragon Palace.

Moreover, even if they wanted to take revenge, they didn’t know the exact location of the Dragon Palace.

The Dragon Palace was located at the bottom of the vast ocean. Everyone knew that the Dragon Palace was located in the ocean, but no one knew the exact location.

Hence, they had this invitation letter.

“I’ve already killed them. How Do I solve this?”

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly. “I want to go over and take a look!”

He moved his body and flew out directly. he shouted coldly, “Let’s Go!”

Whoosh

In the Dragon Palace, the nine dragons moved. Behind them was a Golden Dragon Chair. Four golden swordfish celestial beings were standing on the left and right.

Wang Xian leaped lightly and landed on the Dragon Chair. He looked down at the sea with a smile on his face. “Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian felt that he was now a big shot.

He was riding on a powerful divine beast and had four bodyguards by his side.

The current battle was no longer like the past. When it came to a battle, they would fight directly. Instead, they would discuss it in advance. If they couldn’t reach an agreement, a battle might break out.

Unknowingly, the ignorant kid from a few years ago had become a peerless powerhouse who was now awe-inspiring.

Wuwei island was quite far away from here. For immortals and gods, it would take at least half an hour’s journey.

Wuwei Island was located at the junction between the east and the west, where the sub-continent and the European continent were connected.

The entire Wuwei Island was only ten kilometers in circumference.

At this moment, in the east of the island, a group of Immortals and gods were stepping on auspicious clouds or spirit swords, looking at the position in front of them.

The Xuan Yuan clan and the Yuwen clan’s supreme elder were in the center.

The two of them had a Xuan Yuan sword and an Earth fan, and their bodies were filled with an otherworldly aura.

In front of them, a group of people were riding Pegasus. In the center, a burly old man was riding a five-meter-long Black Pegasus.

The old man was holding a huge hammer in his hand, and his body was emitting a terrifying aura. His eyes were cold as he stared forward.

Next to him, a group of twelve people were standing at the very front, each of them wielding different weapons.

There were some who stood atop crows, some who rode on enormous sea beasts, and one who sat atop a levitating throne. His right hand was wielding an enormous divine staff, and on his left and right was a black crow that was two meters in size!

Each of them was emitting a terrifying aura.

Three of them had the power of a highgod.

The Yuwen clan and the Xuanyuan clan faced their group, but their faces didn’t change in the slightest.

“The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace hasn’t arrived yet?”

The muscular elder with the enormous hammer in his hand shouted coldly.

“Mad God, there’s no need to be anxious. We’ve already notified him. He’ll arrive soon!”

The supreme elder of the Yuwen clan said calmly.

“Roar Roar!”

At this moment, roars sounded one after another. Everyone looked over and their pupils constricted slightly.

Nine twenty-meter-long flood dragons soared into the air. Their enormous bodies and powerful auras caused fear to rise in people’s hearts.

Behind the nine flood dragons was a throne with a person sitting on it.

The speed of the nine flood dragons was extremely terrifying. In the blink of an eye, they had arrived in front of them.

Other than the nine terrifying dragons, the four swordsmen holding golden swords were seated on the left and right side of the throne.

“Haha, it seems that everyone has arrived so quickly!”

Wang Xian stood up and swept his gaze across the two groups of people in front of him. They should be the divine territory of the Garden of Eden and the Ancient Greek divine territory.

“What brings you here today?” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“HMPH, Dragon King, you know the answer but you still ask. Do you think that the matter of killing the eight gods of the Garden of Eden will be resolved just like that?”

The old man with the huge hammer in his hand pointed in the air. A terrifying aura was emitted.

“Mad God, let the Gods of the ancient Greek divine realm tell us why they killed the two immortals of our Huaxia sect!”

The grand elder of the Xuan Yuan clan said to him indifferently.

“How can the lives of two immortals be compared to the lives of the eight of us?”

The old man roared furiously. A huge wave that was a hundred meters high rose from the bottom of the sea.

“If you want to kill me, then kill me. If you have the guts, then kill me!”

Wang Xian’s gaze was cold as he swept his gaze across the gods of the two major celestial realms. “If you want to call me over, just tell me what you want. With that name, you, Ancient Greece, can kill two people directly. So what if I kill eight people?”

“Since you’re already dead, just tell me what you want now!”
