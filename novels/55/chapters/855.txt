Translator: 549690339

“What’s going on?”

“What’s going on? This is a god from the Nordic divine realm. Why is he so happy? What did he expect?”

“Could it be that the Nordic divine realm and the Yuwen clan have already made preparations?”

Upon hearing this loud laughter, the experts who were hiding around and waiting to watch the battle, as well as everyone who was watching the live broadcast, revealed shocked expressions once again.

As usual, the Dragon King suddenly erupted with a terrifying force and directly turned around to attack. The Scandinavian divine realm did not panic at all.

On the contrary, everything was within expectations.

This... ?

“As the wise man said, Your Dragon King’s force is not simple. You will definitely kill your way here today. Hehe, not bad, not bad, very strong, very strong strength!”

A voice that sounded like a loud bell rang throughout the entire world. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

In the depths of the Yuwen clan, white light illuminated the entire mountain peak. Four huge Pegasus soared into the sky, pulling the divine throne.

Divine King Okudin, who was emitting divine light, held a divine staff in his hand. Two huge black crows were located on the left. A metal disc above his head was emitting milky white light.

A group of gods from the Nordic celestial domain stood at the back. Behind them were a group of divine servants and warriors.

About five thousand people rose into the sky like the Sun. In their place, it was as if they formed their own domain, suppressing an entire world.

Divine King Okudin stared expressionlessly at Wang Xian’s position. His face revealed a cold expression.

Buzz

At this moment, a group of immortal gods from the Yuwen clan flew out from the side and stood beside King okeding.

There were three crystal coffins in front of them. One of the coffins was exquisitely carved and placed in the middle.

Six immortal gods held the coffins and placed them in the air.

“Dragon King, today, I will use your head as a tribute to my wife!”

A furious roar was heard. Yu Wenhua stared at Wang Xian with a ferocious expression.

Everyone was filled with killing intent. The icy-cold killing intent caused the air within a radius of dozens of kilometers to freeze.

“Seventy-eight. No, there are eighty-eight immortals from the Yuwen clan and the Northern European divine territory. There are ten more than what they announced!”

“The Northern European divine territory and the Yuwen clan seem to have predicted that the Dragon King would come, so they have been waiting here for a long time. Could there be an ambush? Eighty-eight immortals might not be a match for the Dragon King!”

The group of Immortals and experts from the immortal sects who were hiding in the surroundings watched this scene in astonishment.

The Dragon King had suddenly erupted with a powerful force. In the end, the Norse celestial realm and the Yuwen clan had long been prepared to guess that the Dragon King would come!

“Today, I’m going to exterminate all of you. I’m going to exterminate all of you. The grand wedding has already been held. Next, let’s hold a grand funeral!”

Wang Xian slowly stood up from the dragon throne. He stared coldly at the godly king, Okerding.

“Haha, Dragon King, you dare to kill my daughter. Today, I will use your blood and soul to atone for my sins. I will kill everyone in Your Dragon Palace!”

The Godly King, okerding, stood up abruptly. The white light on his body shone brightly.

He was like the Invincible Godly King of light. If he wanted the world to have light, there would be light.

“With just you guys?”

A hint of mockery appeared in Wang Xian’s eyes as he swept his gaze across all of them.

There were 88 immortals, over 4,000 experts from the celestial domain, and the experts from the Yuwen clan. There were a total of over 6,000 people.

Everyone behind the King of God was wearing divine armor and emitting a divine glow.

Many of them held a sword in one hand and a shield in the other. There were also some who held a long spear and a staff in their hands!

These were the people from the Nordic Divine Territory’s army. They were extremely powerful!

There were more than a dozen of them who were merely half-step immortal gods.

The strength of this army could definitely sweep across the entire world without the immortal gods appearing.

“We alone are enough. However... Dragon King, we will make it difficult for you to escape today!”

The Yuwen clan’s supreme elder said with a cold gaze.

After he finished speaking, divine king Okuddin raised a divine staff in his hand.

“And US. Hehe, Dragon King, the wise ones have long expected that your Dragon Palace’s strength is extraordinary, but!”

“We will still be destroyed!”

“Today is the Day Your Dragon King will die!”

“Haha, you dare to bully the people of the Roman divine realm. Today, you will die!”

“Today, we will fight for the Divine King!”

Roars rang out one after another. In the surrounding void space, many experts who were riding Pegasus, holding divine staffs, and sitting on the divine thrones gathered beside the godly monarch, Okudin.

All of them stared at Wang Xian coldly.

The killing intent spread once again.

“What? How could it be? Another 60 immortals have appeared. Oh My God, Oh my God!”

At this moment, the middle-aged streamer who was broadcasting in the distance revealed a look of astonishment.

Today was really full of twists and turns. Until the end, no one knew what the outcome would be.

Everyone thought that the Dragon King’s strength was far inferior to that of the Nordic divine realm and the Yuwen clan, but in the end, the Dragon King directly led more than 70 immortals to kill them.

The number of these 70 immortals on the surface, in addition to the immortals in the Dragon Palace who were good at hiding, was unknown.

But everyone thought that since the Dragon King dared to attack, he must have absolute confidence.

In the end, just when everyone thought that the Dragon King would win, 60 immortals suddenly appeared.

And they were all powerful immortals.

The leader of the Ancient Greek divine realm led a group of Immortals.

The leader of the Garden of Eden, Mad God, led a group of Immortals.

Although the leader of the Roman divine realm did not come, there was a god of the dead.

The God of the dead, who was second only to the king of the Roman celestial domain.

Sixty Immortals had directly increased the power of the Norse celestial king, Odin, to 148 immortals.

Close to 150 immortals, close to 150 immortals!

Seeing this terrifying power, everyone felt their scalps go numb.

“The three celestial domains actually listened to the orders of the Norse celestial king. They had long guessed that the Dragon King would lead his subordinates here. It’s over. Everything about the Dragon King is within the opponent’s expectations. The Dragon King has completely fallen!”

“I really didn’t expect this. I really didn’t expect this!”

The surrounding immortals and gods hiding in the surroundings watched this scene in shock.

To the west of the sky was the territory of the Xuan Yuan clan. All of the Immortals and gods of the Xuan Yuan clan were hiding in the sky as they watched from afar.

When they saw these two huge factions, they also sucked in a breath of cold air.

“The Dragon King is indeed invincible, but what can we do? After all, the other party is a divine realm with two to three thousand years of history!”

The grand elder of the Xuan Yuan clan slowly shook his head and sighed.

“The Dragon King has already comprehended a divine ability, and the battle that the divine king displayed that night must have also comprehended a divine ability. Unless the Dragon King is able to completely suppress the divine king, otherwise...”

A white-haired old man standing beside the supreme elder of the Xuan Yuan clan said slowly with bright eyes.

This old man stood in the center, and even the Supreme Elder was one step behind. This was a hidden supreme expert of the Xuan Yuan clan.

“The Dragon King and the Dragon Palace have fallen!”

The surrounding immortals and gods thought so, and so did the Xuan Yuan clan!

Dragon King, this is a complete fall!
