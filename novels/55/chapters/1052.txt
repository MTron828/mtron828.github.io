Chapter 1053: 1054 face could be used as an admission ticket?

Translator: 5496903

They entered?

The four middle-aged men at the door only took a glance and entered!

Zhang Yushu and the others followed behind with stunned faces. He couldn’t help but look behind them.

Each of them had an admission ticket in their hands. The four middle-aged men only entered after taking a glance.

Could it be that they could enter without a ticket?

The faces of the young man in aquamarine and Xiao Mei, who were prepared to watch them make a fool of themselves, turned stiff.

They could enter the arena?

Directly?

“Young master hai, what... What’s going on? Didn’t you ask for tickets?”

A young man whispered to the young man in aquamarine.

“Let’s go, we’ll go too!”

The expression of the young man in aquamarine changed. They didn’t hear what Wang Xian said just now.

In fact, Wang Xian sent a voice transmission directly to the four middle-aged men.

Now that Feng Xian was under everyone’s gaze, he didn’t want anyone to pay attention to him at this moment.

Therefore, from their point of view, the group of people walked straight in without even taking out their tickets.

The young man in aqua blue walked straight to the auction. A few young men and Xiao Mei immediately followed behind him.

“Tickets!”

However, just as they reached the entrance, a cold gaze landed on the young man in aqua blue and said coldly.

This made him choke, and his expression changed slightly. “They... they just entered!”

“If you don’t have tickets, then get out!”

The middle-aged man revealed a faint aura as he looked at him coldly.

“I have it, I have it!”

Sensing the middle-aged man’s aura, the young man’s expression changed slightly and he quickly took out the tickets.

The middle-aged man glanced at them and did not say anything.

The young man’s expression was extremely ugly and the other young men and Xiaomei behind him had strange expressions on their faces.

What the F * ck? How could they enter without tickets! !

At this moment, Zhang Yushu and the others who had just entered were also a little dumbfounded when they saw this scene!

What was going on?

They had walked straight in, but Hai Wen and the others had to take out their tickets to enter?

This...

“Xiaomei, come with us!”

Zhang Yushu saw Xiaomei and hurriedly said.

Zhang Fengying, who was at the side, looked at her nephew and frowned slightly.

Xiaomei, on the other hand, started to hesitate again.

“Xiaomei, let’s go to our seats. My seat is in the third row. It’s closer to the front!”

At this moment, a young man dressed in aqua blue said with an embarrassed expression.

Xiaomei hesitated for a moment before nodding her head. She looked at Zhang Yushu and said, “No, I’ll go with Hai Wen and the rest!”

“Let’s go upstairs!”

Wang Xian continued to speak to Zhang Fengying.

“Upstairs?”

Wang Xian’s words stunned everyone once again.

Upstairs was a private room.

According to what they knew, there were private rooms on two floors of the auction.

Private rooms were only prepared for insightful emptiness realm experts and families with insightful emptiness realm experts. If not, sorry, you wouldn’t be able to go up.

It was better to stay obediently in the hall.

As there were too many families that came this time, the private rooms on the second and third floors were completely insufficient.

The standard of those who were qualified to enter was raised to the insightful emptiness realm.

To be able to enter meant one’s true strength.

Zhang Yushu and the rest were stunned and quickly followed behind.

At the entrance of the private room stood a middle-aged man. He scanned the surroundings with a calm expression.

When he saw Wang Xian walking up, his expression didn’t change at all.

The group of people walked straight up.

The young man in Aqua Blue was stunned once again. Xiao Mei’s face was filled with astonishment and a hint of regret.

“Let’s go. Let’s go too. My father and his men are in the private room on the third floor!”

The expression of the young man in aqua blue changed as he spoke to the few people beside him. Then, he walked straight up the stairs.

Xiao Mei smiled when she saw him walking upstairs. He knew Hai Wen’s background.

“Admission tickets!”

However, when they reached the intersection, the middle-aged man who seemed calm said faintly.

The young man in the water-blue clothes was stunned again.

What the hell was the meaning of this?

They just walked up without asking anything. Why did I walk up and ask for admission tickets?

The youth in aqua blue took out his admission ticket with an embarrassed expression!

“Don’t you have eyes? These are the tickets for the hall. You Don’t have the right to enter!”

The middle-aged man glanced at them and said coldly.

“I. . .”

The youth in aqua blue opened his mouth and his face turned red.

What the F * ck!

They directly walked into the auction house without tickets. We want to enter!

They walked straight up to the private room. We don’t have the right to go up! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Then how could they enter the auction house?

Why didn’t you ask them for tickets?

You even said that he had no eyes!

“You...”

The young man in Aqua Blue wanted to flare up on the spot, but when he heard his father’s reminder to him today, he forcefully suppressed the anger on his face!

“This...”

Zhang Yushu and the others, who were walking on the stairs, heard their conversation and looked down in shock.

This...

They were actually stopped?

Did they just walk up?

Hai Wen’s background was very terrifying. Why didn’t he come up?

At this moment, Zhang Yushu and the others were a little dumbfounded. They quickly looked at the young man walking at the front.

This aunt Zhang Yushu’s friend was so awesome? Could his face be used as an admission ticket?

“ERM... brother, can you let one of our friends come up?”

Zhang Yushu looked at Xiaomei below and said to Wang Xian hesitantly.

“What? Aren’t you afraid that you’ll end up on the grassland in the future?”

Zhang Fengying said to Zhang Yushu coldly.

“Aunty, I...”

“What are you talking about? Let’s Go!”

Zhang Fengying said in a domineering manner. She looked at her nephew with disdain.

Zhang Yushu became timid and followed behind her with an unhappy expression.

Downstairs, Xiao Mei, the young man in aqua blue, and the rest saw them going up. Their faces were filled with embarrassment.

“Here, this room is empty!”

Wang Xian led them all the way to the third floor. When he saw that there was no one in a private room, he opened the door and said to them.

“Okay, sure!”

Zhang Fengying nodded.

“By the way, are you free tomorrow?”

Wang Xian looked at Zhang Fengying and suddenly thought of something. He asked her.

“No, what’s the matter?”

Zhang Fengying looked at him curiously with a smile on her face.

“There’s something I want to ask you. Since I didn’t manage to finish my meal last time, I’ll Treat You Tomorrow!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Alright!”

Zhang Fengying nodded. “But, I’m warning you. If you dare to be late again, don’t blame me for being impolite.”

“No, no!”

Wang Xian shook his head hurriedly. “All of you can sit here first. I still have some matters to attend to!”

“Okay!”

Zhang Fengying nodded.

Zhang Yushu and the rest stared at the empty private room with their mouths Agape.

This private room is theirs now?
