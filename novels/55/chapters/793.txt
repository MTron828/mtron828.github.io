“Brother, the Holy Doctor, Holy Medicine, and these B * stards actually announced on the Jianghu website that today is just a small lesson for us. The matter of humiliating the two immortal sects is only the beginning!”

Wang Xian, Xiao Yu, and the rest returned to their room. Xiao Yu looked furious when she saw the information on the Jianghu website.

“Is it only the beginning?”

Wang Xian revealed a cold expression as he took out his phone and started reading.

Just as Xiao Yu had said, the account of the Holy Medicine sect was directly posted on the Jianghu website. Today was just the beginning. In the future, Longmen would have no place in jianghu.

Looking at this post, Wang Xian revealed a cold expression. “Today is indeed just the beginning!”

His eyes flickered. He logged into the account of the Dragon Gate and posted a post, announcing something.

“The war has begun. If we want to stop, we must destroy all the disciples of the Dragon Gate!”

It was a very plain declaration, but it showed the determination to fight to the death.

At this moment, the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Sect’s sudden attack to destroy the Dragon Gate forging workshop had caused an uproar on the entire Internet.

Many disciples of the immortal sect had personally witnessed today’s great battle.

The experts of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect were like an army crossing the border, directly charging out a dozen people and destroying the Dragon Gate forging workshop with terrifying offensive power.

Secondly, the involvement of the strange thorn clan had exceeded everyone’s expectations.

However, thinking about how the Strange Thorn clan was a clan of assassins, they would act after giving money, so it was no longer too surprising.

When the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect and the Dragon Gate announced this on the Jianghu website, the war was completely ignited.

“No one expected that the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect would suddenly make a move today. I’m afraid that even the Dragon Gate would not have thought that they would be so swift and decisive. The moment they made a move, they directly destroyed the Dragon Gate forging workshop!”

“The Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect has started to make a move. I told you that the two immortal sects would definitely take revenge for the humiliation they had suffered. As expected, at the peak of the Dragon Gate’s glory, they directly dealt a heavy blow!”

“The crafty Thorn Clan has actually interfered. Now, the Dragon Gate will be in big trouble in the future. The Holy Medicine Holy Medicine and the crafty Thorn, just as the two immortal sects said, the jianghu might not have a place for the Dragon Gate in the future!”

“The two immortal sects are completely furious. Together with the crafty Thorn clan, the Dragon Gate will be finished in the future!”

When some people heard the news that the Dragon Gate forging workshop had been destroyed and saw the announcement made by the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect, they said with shock on their faces.

After all, they were a powerful force with a thousand-year foundation. Even if the Dragon Gate had many experts, they were still slightly weaker.

Moreover, the two immortal sects had actually invited the assassin clan’s Sly Thorn to attack. The Dragon Gate had no room to resist at all.

However, some disciples of the immortal sects felt their scalps go numb when they saw the declaration made by the Dragon Gate.

“Eighteen of the Dragon Gate’s experts were killed this time. However, if the Dragon Gate’s experts had run away at the beginning, they would definitely have been able to escape with their spiritual weapons. At most, they would have lost six or seven people. However, the members of the Dragon Gate didn’t run away. Instead, they exchanged their lives for each other’s. The Dragon Gate’s declaration this time will not rest until one of them is dead. Moreover, it might be the kind of declaration where I will slash you even if I can’t Beat You!”

“The experts of the Dragon Gate are too fierce. They don’t care about death at all. I saw it with my own eyes. The eight assassins of the secret Thorn sect fought with the four experts of the Dragon Gate, and five of them were killed by the experts of the Dragon Gate. It’s too terrifying. They exchanged injuries for injuries, and their lives for lives!”

“Next, the Dragon King might have to fight to the death!”

“The Dragon King is completely furious. This time, the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect and the Secret Thorn sect took the initiative to sneak attack the Dragon Gate, but they were killed by eleven infant realm experts. According to the Dragon King’s character, even if the Dragon Gate is destroyed, the three immortal sects will suffer heavy losses!”

The entire jianghu was in complete chaos. All the immortal sect’s martial artists were discussing the enmity between the Dragon Gate and the three great immortal sects.

Especially when the performance of the Dragon Gate’s experts was known by everyone, everyone took a deep breath.

The Dragon Gate’s experts were not afraid of death and fought to the death, which shocked everyone.

No matter what, even if the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect could win this war, they would definitely pay a heavy price!

However, on the Jianghu website, all the martial artists didn’t think that the Dragon Gate would be a match for the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect.

Especially now that they had added the treacherous Thorn clan, it was even worse.

In the Yao Ding region, when the disciples and descendants of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect saw the Dragon Gate’s reply on the Jianghu website, they clamored to destroy the Dragon Gate!

“If it wasn’t for the agreement between the Immortals and gods, your Little Dragon Gate would have already been destroyed. All the immortals and gods would have been killed. What Dragon King? We have already slaughtered the Dragon King!”

“That’s right. Today is just the beginning. Soon, Your Dragon Gate will pay the price for what happened in the past and kill all the powerhouses of Your Dragon Gate!”

“It would be great if there was no agreement between the Immortals and gods. Then, our two immortal sects would be able to directly destroy the Dragon Gate!”

The disciples of the two immortal sects were very confident in their own strength. Tens of millions of people posted mocking and disdainful posts on jianghu.

They even said that if there was no agreement between the Immortals and gods, the Dragon Gate would have been destroyed a long time ago.

The other immortal sects didn’t say anything. They just quietly watched on the internet. Next, there was no doubt that the disciples of the Dragon Gate and the two immortal sects were going to fight to the death. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“The Dragon Gate is completely no match for the two immortal sects, or even the three immortal sects. It’s a stupid move to fight to the death!”

Some immortal gods thought to themselves when they saw the Dragon Gate’s declaration.

In terms of strength, the Dragon Gate was still much weaker.

“Today, the Dragon Palace will appear. Anyone who offends us will be killed!”

“Today, the Dragon Palace will appear. Anyone who offends us will be killed!”

...

Suddenly, the immortal gods’voices resounded throughout the entire jianghu!

Seven Voices, a total of seven voices, resounded throughout the entire jianghu.

Just like when the immortal sects appeared, they used their powerful strength to spread their voices throughout the entire jianghu.

They announced their return to the world.

Today, it was the same for the Dragon Palace.

When this voice rang out, all the experts of the immortal sects in the jianghu suddenly stood up with shocked expressions on their faces.

“Seven voices, seven completely different voices, seven immortal gods!”

“Which faction is the Dragon Palace? How come I’ve never heard of it before? Seven Immortal Gods, seven immortal gods!”

All the immortal gods from the immortal sects looked into the distance with shock on their faces, their eyes shining.

“No, the Dragon Palace? The Dragon Sect? What relationship do they have?”

“Why did they say that anyone who offends us should be killed?”

At this moment, some of the immortal gods thought of what the immortal gods had said, and their eyes were filled with shock.

Dragon Palace?

Dragon Gate?

And that Dragon King!

If this was a power, then this... Was simply... Simply too shocking.

Some of the immortal sect disciples also listened to the domineering and Majestic Voices in a daze.

A terrifying power had appeared out of nowhere!
