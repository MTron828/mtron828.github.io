Chapter 3209: The 3208 heavenly dragon roared and the Xingjiang clan submitted

“The Tianhai Dragon King has possessed a physical body?”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned when he heard Ao Jin’s words. A look of astonishment appeared in his eyes.

“Dragon King, according to my memories, the Tianhai Dragon King has been scheming for billions of years. He even gave the forbidden technique to the Tianhai Dragon King. He wanted to use the Tianhai Dragon King as a chess piece so that he could bring a purebred divine dragon or a person with a mutated divine dragon bloodline.”

“However, he suffered a huge loss from you, Dragon King. Half of his dragon soul was taken away, and his control over the dragon palace was reduced to the minimum. A universe knight with level four combat strength could break through the defenses of the Dragon King Palace.”

“He might be afraid of being captured, so he took over a body. According to my guess, he must have taken over the body of the Tianhai Dragon King.”

Ao Jin guessed and said to Wang Xian.

“Took over the Heaven Dragon King? How strong is he after taking over?”

Wang Xian frowned and asked.

“With the resources left in the Dragon King’s palace and the fact that the Heaven Dragon King is a level three universe knight, he should be able to raise his strength to level four universe knight. Coupled with the acquired Supreme Treasure, Dragon Pearl, and other treasures, he should be able to become invincible at level four universe knight or even fight above his level.”

Ao Jin said.

“What a trouble!”

Wang Xian frowned slightly.

They were now almost mortal enemies with the Sky Sea Dragon King. The revival that he had been planning for billions of years had been destroyed by him.

Not only that, the Dragon Soul had already taken half of it.

In addition, other than the treasures in the Dragon King’s Palace, everything else had been taken away by him. The Sky Sea Dragon King must have wanted to kill him.

He even wanted to hide from his physical body.

An invincible fourth-level universe knight who could even fight against opponents of a higher level was a huge threat to the Dragon Palace.

Especially a dragon king who had lived for a very long time.

“Prime Minister Gui, send your disciples to the starry sky of Xingjiang to keep an eye on the situation of the Sky Sea Dragon King. Also, tell the members of the Dragon Palace not to go out and cultivate in peace for the time being.”

Wang Xian pondered for a moment and ordered immediately.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui replied immediately.

…

“Damned Dragon King, he forced me to possess this lowly body.”

“Extract half of my dragon soul. I’m going to kill you, kill you.”

At the same time, at a spot in the starry sky of Xingjiang.

An incomparably huge dragon palace was hidden in the void crack.

The Dragon Palace could not only be located in the ocean, but could also cross the void.

In the Dragon King Hall of the enormous Dragon Palace, a Golden Sky Sea Dragon King with enormous wings let out an angry roar.

Although he had regained his body, he was not happy at all.

A lowly bloodline body even made him feel humiliated.

He understood that if he had such a body, it would be too difficult for him to reach the peak.

It was all because of the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. He wanted to destroy the Dragon Palace, devour their bloodlines, and seek a breakthrough in his bloodline.

“Sky Sea Dragon King, according to the information we received, that Dragon King has the combat strength of a universe knight level four. Not long ago, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace defeated the leader of the Starriver clan. His strength is very terrifying.”

At this time, at the front, a group of great demons knelt at the front and bowed respectfully.

Ever since the Sky Sea Dragon King completely took over, he immediately shut down the Sky Sea Dragon Palace.

All the demon beasts were trapped in the Dragon Palace.

The Sky Sea Dragon King used a terrifying method to enslave all of them.

Right now, in the entire Sky Sea Dragon Palace, there were more than 100 great demons.

However, out of these 100 great demons, only one was a level 3 universe knight.

The rest were mostly level 1 universe knights.

This power wasn’t weak, it could even be said to be very strong.

But to Sky Sea Dragon King, this was still trash.

“Dragon Palace Dragon King also has the combat strength of A Level 4 universe knight? Along with that Willow Tree, Dragon Palace has at least two level 4 universe knights.”

Sky Sea Dragon King heard his subordinate’s report and roared in a low voice, his expression ugly.

Because he had lost half of his dragon soul, it was impossible for him to raise his combat power quickly.

It took a lot of resources to raise his combat power to universe knight level four.

In addition, although the true treasure in his hand could make him invincible at level four and fight against level five, it was still very unlikely for him to destroy Dragon Palace Dragon King.

After all, if the Dragon King escaped, it would be very difficult for him to keep him.

Once he couldn’t keep the Dragon King, it would be futile.

If he didn’t make a move, as long as he made a move, he would kill the Dragon King.

A fierce light flashed in his eyes, and his facial expression kept changing.

If he was asked to take revenge thousands or even tens of thousands of years later, he wouldn’t be satisfied, and he didn’t have so much time.

He wanted to improve himself as soon as possible and destroy the dragon palace as soon as possible.

“The injuries on my dragon soul haven’t recovered yet. I need some powerful divine herbs to recover.”

“The resources in the Dragon King’s palace are almost used up. I need a huge amount of resources to cultivate in the future.”

The Tianhai Dragon King murmured and glanced at all the great demons below.

“Let’s go. Follow me to the Xingjiang clan. I want to suppress the Xingjiang clan.”

The Tianhai Dragon Palace flapped its wings slowly and roared coldly.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The great demons immediately responded respectfully.

“Buzz!”

In the next moment, the entire dragon palace trembled and quickly flew toward the Xingjiang clan’s seven-colored river.

Although the Tianhai Dragon King had always been in the Tianhai Dragon Palace, he knew the situation of this starry sky like the back of his hand.

This included the Xingjiang clan, which was the most powerful clan here.

However, today, he was going to suppress and subdue the most powerful clan in this starry sky.

The Tianhai Dragon Palace sped through the starry sky. Two days later, it appeared in front of the enormous seven-colored starry river.

The Dragon Palace came out of the spatial crack and quickly flew toward the center of the seven-colored Starry River.

Right in front of the Sky Sea Dragon Palace, the Sky Sea Dragon King was lying on top of a few dragon pillars, staring at the front with a grim expression.

At the back, all the demon beasts were standing respectfully at the back.

“Who are you?”

The Star River clan had been living on both sides of the seven-colored river for generations. The powerful Sky Sea Dragon Palace flew over quickly and attracted the attention of the Star River Clan Warriors.

Two universe knights came over quickly and looked at the huge Dragon Palace in surprise.

They felt that this dragon palace was familiar.

“I am Sky Sea Dragon King. Today, I order all the people of your Starriver clan to submit to me!”

Sky Sea Dragon King looked at the two universe knights of the Starriver clan and roared with a grim face.

His voice resounded throughout the starry sky.

Some disciples of the Starriver clan were shocked when they heard his voice.

“Sky Sea Dragon King?”

The two universe knights of the Starriver clan were also shocked. They narrowed their eyes when they looked at Sky Sea Dragon King.

“Sky Dragon King, you inherited the Sky Sea Dragon Palace?”

They looked at Sky Sea Dragon King’s body with cold eyes.
