“Run, run, the enemy is very strong, let’s run!”

“Retreat, retreat immediately!”

Within the blessed land, the mechs controlled by the curse spirit village let out panicked cries.

The curse spirit village was not weak at the moment, three level 8 knight Mechs and their strange curse powers.

Their strength could be considered as a relatively strong existence at the edge of the heaven opening primal continent.

However, Wang Xian’s strength was stronger and even stranger.

When the two level eight battle mechas of universe knights were destroyed by Wang Xian, the rest of the powerhouses of the cursed spirit village fled into the distance with terrified expressions.

“Eight dragon clones, Kill!”

Wang Xian growled in a low voice. Numerous dragon clones flew out from his body and attacked the group of universe knights.

“No, no!”

The mechas sensed the energy behind them. They turned their heads and looked horrified.

“This is bad. With this mech around, we won’t be able to escape back to our divine kingdom in an instant.”

The group of people from curse spirit village looked at the terrifying attack from behind. Their faces were filled with despair.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The sounds of mecha exploding rang out one after another. Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and locked onto the level 8 Mech of a universe knight. He continued to attack.

“No, no. The people of Curse Spirit Village, run away immediately. Run away immediately. That Dragon King is too powerful. In the future, all of you must avenge me! Avenge me!”

When the people of Curse Spirit Village who was driving the level 8 Mech of a universe knight saw Wang Xian chasing after them, their faces were filled with blood-red color.

He was filled with unwillingness as he roared.

Their cursed spirit village was about to rise up and even occupied this blessed land. However, they did not expect to encounter such a strong enemy.

His eyes were filled with blood red as he reminded the people in the center of the Blessed Land.

The strength of this Dragon King was not something that the cursed spirit village could contend against!

“Damn it, that Dragon King was able to resist our curse power, and now even the Vice clan leader and the others aren’t his match. Run!”

An old man roared and ordered loudly.

“Clan leader, are we going to give up this place? We paid a huge price to occupy this place!”

In the center of the Blessed Land, a group of people stood there with unwilling faces.

To the people of Curse Spirit Village, this was their Holy Land.

In order to occupy this blessed land, they had made a huge deal with the steel union and paid a huge price.

If they gave up this place now, all their efforts would be in vain.

“Leave immediately. If we don’t give up this place, the Dragon King will kill us all!”

The cursed spirit village leader roared with a stern expression.

As he finished speaking, his figure started to flicker and slowly disappeared.

“Hong!”

At this moment, they saw the sound of an explosion outside. That powerful universe Knight Level 8 mech directly exploded.

The Third Universe Knight Level 8 Mech was destroyed.

“Run!”

At this moment, all the people from the cursed spirit village disappeared.

However, as they relied on their own curses, their Cosmos God country did not hide too much. Instead, they were directly at their village.

When they had just left, Wang Xian arrived at the center of the grotto-heaven blessed land. His gaze swept across the surroundings as his eyes revealed a cold expression.

Many castles were built at the center of the entire grotto-heaven blessed land.

At this moment, there were no longer any people from the curse spirit village.

Boom

Wang Xian waved his arm and a wave of energy swept across, turning the castles they had built into ashes.

He landed at the center of the grotto-heaven blessed land and looked around.

When he arrived at the center of the grotto-heaven blessed land, the white energy was even more powerful.

It was estimated that even if his body was cut in half, he would be able to recover instantly.

This was an exceptionally powerful grotto-heaven paradise for any race.

Just think about it. If he was severely injured, he could recover completely within a few years even if he was here for tens of thousands of years.

“There should be more than this!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and scanned his surroundings with his dragon eyes.

Buzz

At this moment, his gaze landed on a spot. His figure moved and he flew over immediately.

“This is really strange!”

Landing at the bottom of the spot, Wang Xian sized up the few things in front of him. His eyes were filled with astonishment.

In his line of sight, there were ten tombstones that were emitting light.

This tombstone was emitting a holy white light. Wang Xian placed his hand on it and a stream of information was transmitted into his mind.

The Holy Tablet of Resurrection!

“As expected, it’s just as I predicted. There are things in this blessed land that can resurrect creatures. It’s really heaven-defying. However, this resurrection shouldn’t be unlimited.”

Wang Xian mumbled as he looked at the ten holy tablets with a face full of astonishment. These ten holy tablets represented the ability to resurrect ten holy spirits.

This was simply too important to a race.

Ten experts from a race who possessed the ability to resurrect was equivalent to twenty experts!

It was just that he didn’t know if their combat ability would be weakened after resurrection or what price they would have to pay.

However, Wang Xian felt that the price might not be too great. It should be more powerful than the soul-returning wood.

“Not bad, not bad. It’s very good to be the paradise of the Dragon Palace. Furthermore, there’s no need for the Dragon Palace to engage in battle during the landing battle this time. They can just transfer the dragon palace to this side.”

A satisfied smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face.

The landing battle was a battle for the grotto-heaven blessed land.

If the Dragon Palace managed to find a new grotto-heaven blessed land without an owner, they would naturally not need to challenge other races!

It was likely that the other factions in the heaven-splitting primordial land would be extremely excited when they received the news.

After all, they would be able to heave a sigh of relief even if the Dragon Palace did not challenge them.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

At this moment, nine figures flew over.

Wang Xian turned around and looked at them. He raised his head slightly and locked onto them.

“Dragon King, please don’t misunderstand. We are only here to take a look at the situation here. Our two tribes will not compete with the Dragon Palace for this paradise!”

The old man who was the leader of the light tribe saw Wang Xian locking onto them and hurriedly cupped his hands.

“Yes, this grotto-heaven paradise will be the domain of our Dragon Palace in the future. It will also be the place where our Dragon Palace will decide on the tribe.”

Wang Xian said directly to them.

“With your strength, Dragon King, this grotto-heaven paradise should belong to your Dragon Palace. The light tribe and the nine-candle demon tribe also congratulate you. We hope that our three tribes can live in peace too!”

The expert of the light tribe expressed his goodwill.

“Alright, our Dragon Palace is also willing to make friends!”

Wang Xian smiled and cupped his hands at them.

“Then, we shall not disturb you. When the Dragon Palace enters the heaven-splitting chaotic land, we will invite you to visit us as a guest!”

The expert from the light tribe cupped his hands and said.

“Our nine-candle demon tribe will soon open up the teleportation formation to this side. When the time comes, you can travel directly through the teleportation formation on our side.”

The nine-candle demons were also expressing their goodwill.

Wang Xian nodded with a smile.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m
