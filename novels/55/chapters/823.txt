There were millions and millions of snakes in the Sea of snakes.

However, there was one thing that these snakes were of little value. They didn’t have any special abilities and couldn’t be compared to the lightning of the thunder shrimp, the swordplay of the Golden Swordfish, and the violent attacks of the demon monkeys.

“Why are there poisonous snakes on land in your sea of snakes?”

Wang Xian thought of the poisonous snakes in the Sea of snakes and asked curiously.

“Dragon King, in my territory, there are the most poisonous creatures on Earth. All the poisonous snakes and even the poisonous scorpions have been captured by me into the Sea of snakes. They are mainly used to quench the poison to increase my toxicity and help me in my cultivation. Unfortunately, the most poisonous poison now can only be used on a mid-level immortal!” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ba Qi said to Wang Xian with a smile.

“Quench the poison?”

Wang Xian looked at the poison on the arm of the Thunder Prawn. Its entire arm was pitch black. If Ao qi and the other thunder prawn had not used lightning to block the poison, the thunder prawn would have been poisoned to death!

“Hehe!”

Ba Qi looked at the Thunder prawn at the side. One of his arm turned into a poison and entered his body along his pale arm to suck out the poison.

“That’s right. I raised all kinds of poisonous snakes to be poisoned. I have developed a method to extract the poison. Even if an immortal is careless, he will be poisoned to death!”

Ba Qi said with some pride.

“Ao Yao, can you smear poison on Your Claws?”

Wang Xian looked at Ao Yao and asked him.

“As long as it’s not corrosive poison, yes!”

Ao Yao replied.

“If you apply poison on your claws, it can increase your lethality by a level. Even those who are half a step away from the level of Celestials can assassinate Celestials!”

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up.

Poison was very useful. It could be used to poison a sword, poison a weapon, poison fog, etc. . It was definitely a terrifying killing weapon in battle.

As for using poison, it wasn’t that it wasn’t fair.

In a battle between martial artists, the victor would be the king. As long as one could win, one would be the king.

The history books were written by the victors, and those who died would be the losers.

Therefore, poison was very useful.

“Why don’t the Dragon Palace set up a poison department in the future?”

In the ancient dynasties, there were not only civil servants and generals, but also some technical personnel. Technical personnel were also extremely useful.

This venomous snake clan could become technical personnel and be used to refine poisons in the future.

Wang Xian stared at Ba Qi. Seeing his gaze, Ba Qi couldn’t help but shiver.

“Swallow This!”

Wang Xian stretched out his hand and passed a drop of blood essence to Ba Qi.

Ba Qi stared at the blood essence and his breathing became heavier. The transformation of a snake into a dragon was something that all snakes dreamed of.

However, when he sensed the special energy contained within, Ba Qi’s expression changed drastically. He looked extremely embarrassed.

The submission that he wanted was not to be controlled or become a slave.

Otherwise, he would not even have the chance to regain his freedom in the future.

“One, two...”

Wang Xian stared at the eight-headed snake and counted indifferently.

“I’ll swallow, I’ll Swallow!”

The eight-headed snake’s expression changed. In the face of Life and freedom, he would naturally choose life.

The eight-headed snake gritted its teeth and absorbed the blood essence.

“Eh, something’s Not Right!”

When Wang Xian sensed that the eight-headed snake was being controlled, his expression changed slightly. “All nine of your heads are separate life forms. You’re really cunning!”

Wang Xian stared at him coldly with a cold expression on his face. “Since that’s the case, I shall kill the rest of your eight heads!”

“No, no, no!”

At this moment, his other eight heads shook their heads in horror. “Give them to us. give them to us to consume as well!”

“HMPH!”

Wang Xian snorted coldly. He finally understood why the eight-headed snake possessed such intelligence.

The nine heads were all individual lives. They shared the same thoughts, but their learning speed was nine times faster than other living creatures.

If he controlled one of them, the other eight would not be controlled.

Wang Xian squeezed out eight drops of blood essence and placed them in his mouth. They then absorbed it!

After absorbing it, the nine heads immediately lowered their heads and greeted respectfully, “Greetings, Dragon King!”

“Yes. In the future, when the Dragon Palace establishes the Poison Dragon Tribe, you will be in charge of refining all kinds of poisons!”

“Yes, Dragon King!”

The eight-headed heads bowed respectfully.

“Now, go and bring all your subordinates here. Build a nest near the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian continued to give him orders.

“Yes, Dragon King. I want to bring some of the items that I have collected over. In addition, there are still some matters that need to be dealt with on land. Please give me a few days, Dragon King!”

Ba Qi said respectfully.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded.

Once he absorbed his blood essence, he would be 100% loyal. There would definitely not be any betrayal. Therefore, Wang Xian was not worried at all.

Although this expedition did not allow him to achieve a breakthrough in his strength, it was a significant improvement for the entire Dragon Palace.

Especially Ba Qi, he would be of great use to the future development of the Dragon Palace.

“Let’s go back!”

The Dragon Palace had two new immortal God level members. Wang Xian was very satisfied with the battle this time. He moved his body and flew directly toward the Dragon Palace.

Kun, who was at the side, shook his body slightly. The gray flesh on his body that had been destroyed was wriggling slowly.

A wound that was five meters deep and ten meters wide would definitely be a devastating blow to other creatures. However, to Kun, who was more than 150 meters tall, it was just a small wound. There was not even any blood flowing out.

The strong points of the Kun were their physical defense, strong vitality, and unparalleled strength.

They didn’t possess elemental attacks, but they had an unparalleled attack method, which was to hit with strength.

They could instantly burst out a terrifying strength and hit a single point.

This was the most terrifying attack method of the Kun. When its strength reached a certain level, it could destroy everything.

Whoosh! Whoosh

Wang Xian and the members of the Dragon Palace returned to the Dragon Palace.

“Dragon King!”

Mo Qinglong came up to welcome him directly!

“HMM? How is it?”

Wang Xian asked directly.

During this period of time, Mo Qinglong was discussing the cooperation with the Garden of Eden.

“Dragon King, the Garden of Eden wants someone with weight to go over and talk to them!”

Mo Qinglong said with a slightly bitter tone. His strength had yet to reach the level of an immortal.

“Oh? We’re just telling them the conditions. What else do we need to talk about?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. He didn’t care too much about the success of this collaboration. It was just an attempt.

After all, the other party was from the western divine realm. Both parties had no understanding of each other at all!

“They directly asked for a person of importance to come over. I didn’t even meet their God!”

Mo Qinglong said bitterly.

“Contact them. I’ll go over and talk to them!”

Wang Xian thought for a moment and said.
