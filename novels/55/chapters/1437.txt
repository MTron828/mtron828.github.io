Chapter 1438: 1438 battle 1

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

“Damn it! Damn Wang Xian! Damn Nameless Sword Demon! Just you wait! I, Tang Xuewen, swear that I will tear you into pieces!”

In a palace in the bloody flow palace, the Crown Prince of the bloody flow empire slammed the items in front of the table with a furious expression. He shouted loudly with a ferocious expression.

The beautiful woman beside him had a worried look on her face. She walked over and said softly in fear, “Your Highness Crown Prince, you... Don’t be angry. The dragon-phoenix Empire and the Heaven Sword sect don’t know what’s good for them. They will regret it in the future!”

“How dare they tell me to shut up! How dare they tell me to shut up!”

Tang Xuewen clenched his fists and stood there with a cold expression. “Sixth level of the profound void martial stage. Don’t think that you can order me just because you have reached the sixth level of the profound void martial stage. Just you wait, just you wait!”

He growled and his eyes were filled with a crazy killing intent.

The beautiful woman beside him gently stroked his body to calm him down!

“Your Highness, what do the two emperors say?”

“Huff!”

Tang Xuewen took a deep breath, sitting on a seat at the side with an awkward expression. “We’ll talk about it when my father arrives!”

“However, at this juncture, it’s impossible for us to have a civil war here!”

As he spoke, an unwilling expression appeared on his face.

The beautiful woman hurriedly served tea and poured water at the side. She also understood that at this juncture, the bloodshed empire wouldn’t make a move against them.

The four forces were all the strongest forces apart from the blood flow empire.

This was especially so for the sect leader of the Heavenly Sword sect and that Wang Xian who was at level six of the Seethrough void tier. The two of them were at level six of the Seethrough Void Tier. This had exceeded the expectations of the blood flow empire.

If they really fought, it would cause some unimaginable disasters to the blood flow empire.

The two emperors had also said that everything would be discussed after the blood emperor arrived and called the emperors from the human-demon graveyard over.

The news of what happened in the imperial palace had already spread out in the afternoon.

Once this news spread out, it shook the entire blood flow imperial city.

As the imperial city of the blood flow empire, it had a history of seven to eight thousand years.

This was the most majestic and enormous city in the Liuhai region.

Those who were able to live here were all not weak.

In fact, here, even rank 5 transcendents were considered weak. This was something unimaginable in other cities.

On the streets, level seven and level eight transcendents could be seen everywhere.

“Damn, is this for real? There’s actually someone who dares to challenge our Bloodflow Empire? Let’s kill him!”

“Of course it’s real. Back then, the two emperors couldn’t do anything to the dragon-phoenix Empire and the Heaven Sword sect!”

“Who would have thought that the supreme genius Wang Xian actually had the strength of a level six Seethrough void martial artist? Oh My God, wasn’t he at level five Seethrough void martial artist two years ago?”

“Who cares about the Heaven’s Pride Supreme Wang Immortal? Who cares about the heaven’s sword sect or the Light Dragon Dynasty’s blood stream sect? If they dare to provoke our blood stream empire, kill them!”

“Kill them. As the emperor of the flowing sea region, anyone who disobeys us will die!”

“What about His Majesty the Blood Emperor? Who cares about the Monstrous Heaven’s pride? If they dare to provoke us, we will definitely destroy them!”

In the discussion forums of the various restaurants and communication stone tablets, the citizens of the blood flow Imperial City revealed furious expressions when they received this news.

As citizens of the blood flow imperial city, they had a kind of pride deep in their bones.

When they learned that a few top-tier factions were opposing their dynasty in the imperial palace, every one of their faces revealed furious expressions.

How can our dynasty be opposed by a bunch of forces like you?

In the entire imperial city, many people were discussing with furious expressions.

The crowd was furious.

“With Wang Xian and sect leader Ling, two powerhouses at level six of the void interpretation stage, the blood flow dynasty will definitely not dare to shed all pretenses of cordiality!”

“During this period, even if there are three powerhouses at level six of the void interpretation stage in the blood flow dynasty, they won’t dare to offend them. I reckon the plan will be reformulated in a few days!”

“This isn’t a good thing for us!”

In a restaurant, a few experts from a dynasty listened to the conversations of the people around them as they discussed in low voices.

Those dynasties and sects were very clear that the dragon-phoenix Dynasty and the Sky Sword sect had gained the upper hand in this game.

Time slowly passed.

What happened in the imperial palace caused a commotion in the entire imperial city.

As time passed, the people in the imperial city gradually understood that this time, the blood flow empire, who was invincible in their hearts, might really have to bow their heads! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

As for the current situation, the people gradually understood it clearly.

This caused the people of the blood flow empire to be somewhat dazed. In the future, the blood flow empire might not be the only existence standing on the mountain peak.

“Father, you’re finally here!”

On the evening of the fourth day, in a palace of the blood flow empire.

The night pearl illuminated the entire palace. The crown prince of the blood flow empire, Tang Xuewen, and three other emperors sat inside.

When the four figures outside walked in, the Crown Prince, Tang Xuewen, hurriedly went up to them and shouted with a smile on his face.

“Mm, I heard that something happened here in the Palace!”

The burly elder walked in and bowed to the emperors as he asked indifferently.

“Father, it’s the dragon-phoenix Dynasty, Sky Sword Sect, Blood Stream sect, and Light Dragon Dynasty!”

Crown Prince Tang Xuewen said with a gloomy face.

“I know. Please sit down too!”

The blood emperor nodded and gestured to the three elders beside him.

The three old men nodded, and two of the old men’s clothes had the words ‘pill’and ‘weapon’written on them!

The other old man was slightly chubby, and he had a warm smile on his face.

“Little Jun, these four forces, the matter of the two insightful void Tier 6 experts!”

An emperor looked at the blood emperor and frowned as he asked.

“Father, I’ve already heard about the matters of those four forces, and I have a matter that needs our attention!”

The Blood Emperor said to the emperor, his eyes flickering as he looked at the slightly plump old man.

“All emperors, this old man, Qian from the world’s third trading company, has come to tell you a piece of news!”

The old man stood up with a smile.

“World’s third trading company?”

The emperors were slightly surprised as they said with a smile, “Elder Qian, speak!”

“You should also know that we have been in contact with the third trading company in the world. The Demon Beast Clan wants us to help them pass on the message!”

“Their Demon Beast clan is willing to temporarily stop any battles with humans and invite everyone to participate in the Demon Beast Dynasty’s founding ceremony!”

Elder Qian said slowly.

“Oh? What?”

The emperors were slightly surprised. They frowned and immediately asked, “What’s the situation on the Demon Beast Side Now? Which Demon Beast Clan has reached the peak?”

“Blood Savage Demonic Beast. Now, The Blood Savage Demonic Beast has three demonic beasts at the sixth level of the profound void tier. They have defeated the other two top-tier demonic beast races. The Emperor of Demonic Beasts is in their race!”

Elder Qian said to them.

“Blood Savage Demonic Beast? It’s actually them who has ascended the throne. This... the situation is not optimistic. Are they going to make peace with us humans?”

The emperors frowned, their expressions changing.
