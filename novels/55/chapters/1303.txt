Chapter 1304: 1305 was tough

On the island of the Heavenly Sword sect, in the venue of the Heavenly Sword Lingyun’s meeting, the atmosphere changed a little after manager Qian appeared.

Manager Qian’s identity, the strength and background of the third trading company in the world, made everyone present extremely fearful.

Even the Heavenly Sword sect and the bloodshed empire had to treat him with respect.

Especially now, manager Qian came to speak up for the bloodshed empire at this time.

Although he said that it was not good to chase Tang Ling ‘er out, Wang Xian should apologize to Tang Ling ‘ER. In fact, what he meant was that he could not chase Tang Ling ‘er out.

He wanted Wang Xian to apologize to Tang Ling ‘ER.

As a businessman, he spoke very tactfully, but everyone knew what he meant.

Everyone looked at the smiling manager Qian and would not ignore him.

Tang Feng and Tang Yuan were obviously using this opportunity to say that the guest was the host.

The atmosphere was slightly solemn.

Shopkeeper Qian looked at Ling Jian ‘er with a smile. Tang Feng, Tang Yuan, and Tang Ling ‘er also stared at Ling Jian ‘ER with cold expressions.

“Who are you? Do you have the right to speak here? I think you should scram with them!”

Ling Jian ‘er looked at shopkeeper Qian and a cold expression flashed across her eyes. Her expression was slightly unsightly as she said directly.

“Oh?”

Ling Jian ‘ER’s words caused everyone in the surroundings to be slightly stunned as they looked at shopkeeper Qian in astonishment.

Did she do this on purpose, or did she really not know his identity? Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ling Jian ‘er did not know shopkeeper Qian’s identity in the past, but just now, from the discussions around her, she also knew that this shopkeeper Qian’s identity was extraordinary.

Perhaps, he was not someone that their heavenly sword sect could provoke.

But she pretended not to know his identity and coldly questioned him.

“You...”

When shopkeeper Qian Heard Ling Jian ‘ER’s domineering words, the smile on his face instantly disappeared. He stared at Ling Jian ‘ER with an embarrassed expression, his eyes flickering.

“Young lady, watch your words. Don’t bring undeserved disaster to your heavenly sword sect!”

As he spoke, he slowly narrowed his eyes and coldly said.

“Ling Jian ‘er, shopkeeper Qian is the person in charge of the world’s third largest trading company, flowing sea region. You’d better be careful when you speak to shopkeeper Qian. Don’t think that just because your father broke through, he can do as he pleases and not put anyone in his eyes!”

Tang Feng took two steps closer to shopkeeper Qian and coldly said.

“HMPH!”

Ling Jian ‘er coldly snorted. Her expression was somewhat unsightly as she turned her face to the side.

“Manager Qian, I’m sorry. Our miss doesn’t know your identity. Please forgive us for taking such a risk!”

The elder from the Heavenly Sword sect immediately walked over and said with an apologetic smile on his face.

“Your miss doesn’t know how to be polite. Then teach her more.”

Manager Qian looked at the elder expressionlessly and said coldly.

“Yes, yes!”

The elder from the Heavenly Sword sect didn’t dare to offend her and hurriedly said.

He looked at Ling Jian ‘er, indicating for her not to speak.

“Coming to the Heavenly Sword Lingyun Conference is giving face to Your Heavenly Sword sect. It’s not appropriate for you to treat Miss Tang Ling ‘er and the others like this. As a fair and impartial person, you can just apologize to Miss Tang Ling ‘er and the others.”

Manager Qian stood there and said indifferently.

He looked high and mighty with his head slightly raised.

Even if this was the territory of the Sky Sword sect.

However, with his background, he did have the qualifications.

“Manager Qian has stepped out to help Tang Ling er and the rest. This time, that young man is going to apologize!”

“That Wang Xian is really unlucky. With so many people protecting him, he still has to apologize. Hehe, what bad luck!”

“He deserves it. I think it would be best if he was killed. HMPH!”

When the crowd heard manager Qian’s words, a smile appeared on their faces. Some of the young men wanted to kill this fellow who was loved by the two goddesses.

“Who do you think you are? Let me apologize to them!”

However, what shocked everyone was a cold voice.

Wang Xian looked at manager Qian who was standing there proudly. A hint of killing intent flashed in his eyes.

He glanced at the two underlings beside manager Qian. They were only at the second level of the Seethrough realm.

Such strength was not weak in the demi-human graveyard, but it was definitely not invincible.

Manager Qian dared to be so unbridled and did not put the Heaven Sword sect in his eyes. It was just his background.

However, if he really provoked Wang Xian, so what if he killed him.

Moreover, he would use his identity as the nameless sword demon to kill him. No one would be able to find him.

Therefore, Wang Xian wasn’t afraid of manager Qian at all.

“What?”

“This...”

When Wang Xian had just finished speaking, everyone was slightly stunned. They looked at Wang Xian in disbelief.

Even Long Xiaotian and the elder from the Heavenly Sword sect who were standing at the side opened their mouths slightly and looked at Wang Xian in astonishment.

“Hiss, is this guy courting death with his strength?”

“This is simply courting death! does he not know the meaning of death?”

“How dare he say that to manager Qian? Who gave him the courage?”

When the crowd heard his words, they stared at Wang Xian with widened eyes and discussed in a low voice.

“Impudent! You’re courting death. I think you’re tired of living!”

Before manager Qian could speak, Tang Feng who was at the side shouted angrily at Wang Xian with a face full of killing intent.

“You’re courting death. How dare you speak to manager Qian like that? I think you don’t want to live for even a second!”

When the few princes from the Guanglong dynasty heard Wang Xian’s words, a hint of excitement flashed across their eyes. They immediately stood up and shouted.

They glared at Wang Xian with eyes filled with killing intent.

“Haha, who do I Think I am? Very good, very good. You are the first person who dares to speak to me like this since I came here!”

When manager Qian heard Wang Xian’s words, he suddenly burst into laughter.

“Kill him for me!”

All of a sudden, his laughter came to an abrupt end. He said those five words with a cold expression.

Kill him!

The two powerhouses standing beside him instantly emitted a violent murderous aura. The strength of the second level of the Seethrough realm was directly emitted.

With a move of their arms, a weapon appeared in their hands. They were ready to attack at any time.

Even if it was the territory of the Heaven’s sword sect, they didn’t have any scruples.

Seeing the two powerhouses beside manager Qian suddenly preparing to attack, everyone around them changed their expressions slightly.

“All of you, Stop!”

Ling Jian ‘ER’s expression changed slightly. She quickly stood beside Wang Xian and stared at manager Qian in embarrassment.

“There’s no need!”

Wang Xian pulled her to the side and swept his gaze across manager Qian and the two experts.

He swept his gaze across the few princes of the Dragon Dynasty, Tang Feng, Tang Ling ‘er, and the others. A hint of killing intent flashed across his eyes.

Since this group of people was trying every means to deal with him tonight, he might as well kill his way back.

At most, he would become wretched for the next period of time.

He, Wang Xian, was really not afraid of anyone.

A staff appeared in Zhang Fengying’s hand. She did not speak, but she had already expressed her determination.

Ren Xingchen narrowed his eyes slightly and fixed his gaze on shopkeeper Qian.

Even Ling Jian ‘ER’s body shimmered with a metallic luster.

Without the slightest hesitation!
