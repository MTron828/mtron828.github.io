Domineering!

Whether it was the disciples of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect.

Or the Yuwen clan’s Yuwen Hua!

Everyone stared in the direction of the Dragon Gate with a domineering air. Their eyes were filled with ice-cold battle intent. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

In particular, Yuwen Hua’s appearance shocked everyone.

“I didn’t expect that, I really didn’t expect that Yuwen Hua would actually stand up for his younger brother!”

“His younger brother was humiliated last night, and now he has become a laughing stock in the jianghu. He is known as the Arrogant Heaven’s favorite, and even the Yuwen clan has been ridiculed. Yuwen hua naturally wants to get back at them. However, you see, the immortal gods of the Yuwen clan didn’t stop him, because the Yuwen clan doesn’t think that a dragon gate can contend with them. A weak immortal gate provoking a powerful immortal gate, the consequences are obvious!”

“Now, the Dragon Gate is going to be attacked from behind. Now that the Yuwen clan wants to get back at them, the Dragon Gate will definitely be embarrassed in front of all the immortal sects!”

All the disciples of the immortal sects looked at this scene in shock.

“Humph!”

Xiao Yu looked embarrassed when she saw Yu Wenhua pointing at her. She immediately stood up and glared at Yu Wenhua angrily.

“Xiao Yu, sit down!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with killing intent. He looked at the group of Dragon Palace members who were flying over with a cold expression.

“Get Down!”

When Yu Wenhua saw Xiao Yu sitting down again, he narrowed his eyes slightly and said coldly.

Everyone held their breaths and looked at her in shock.

Yu Wenhua was qualified to fight for the first place in this competition. That girl, the sister of the Dragon King, was not a match for Yu Wenhua!

They wanted to see how the Dragon King would react?

Would he admit defeat and apologize?

The entire arena watched this scene in silence.

“Dragon King!”

“Dragon King!”

However, at this moment, a steady voice came from afar. The voice resounded throughout the entire arena.

Wang Xian stood up slowly and looked at the Holy Doctor, Holy Medicine, and Immortal sect. He shouted in a deep voice, “Get in the Arena!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

A cold and metallic voice rang out. Twenty figures flew directly toward the stage.

All the disciples of the immortal sect were stunned, including all the immortal gods of the immortal sect.

Some of the immortal gods of the immortal sect even stood up abruptly and looked at the sky with solemn faces.

In the sky, twenty young men with cold faces and golden longswords in their hands flew toward the stage.

There were two other people standing there.

No, it should be said that there was a strange old man with a turtle shell on his back and a monkey-like demonic monkey.

The two of them stood in the air as a terrifying energy churned within their bodies. Black demonic qi that seemed to have substance.

Earth energy that was as thick as the earth!

Two immortal gods. These were two immortal gods!

Everyone was shocked, and the disciples of the immortal sect revealed expressions of shock.

The strength of these two immortals was definitely not something that an ordinary lower-level immortal could compare to. They wondered if they had reached the level of a middle-level immortal!

Wang Xian waved his hand. Prime Minister Gui and Ao Qitian moved and left immediately.

His gaze swept across the area below him. He looked at the group of twenty Golden Swordfish people on the arena and turned to look at Yu Wenhua.

“After the disciples of the Dragon sect have killed the disciples of the Holy Medicine and Holy Medicine sect, I will come and kill you!”

Wang Xian said expressionlessly, he looked in the direction of the Holy Doctor and Holy Medicine immortal sect and said, “There are twenty disciples of the Dragon Gate. If you don’t have enough people, I can withdraw some of them. If you have enough people, then let’s begin. A life-and-death battle will not end until one of You is dead!”

“Hiss!”

Upon hearing Wang Xian’s voice, all the disciples of the immortal sect around sucked in a breath of cold air. Their eyes were sparkling as they looked at the twenty young men standing in the arena with swords in their hands.

First, they killed the disciples of the Holy Medicine sect.

Then, they killed Yu Wenhua.

Just the Dragon King’s words had shocked everyone.

However, the scene where the two immortal gods brought twenty disciples was simply too shocking.

Two immortal gods. Apart from the three immortal gods on the surface, two more immortal gods appeared in the Dragon Gate.

Furthermore, one of the immortal gods was a terrifying demon monkey. This...

This was the strength of the Dragon Gate?

Was this the so-called foundation of the Dragon Gate that had only been established for a few years?

Five Immortals had already appeared, and at least two gods had appeared. Could it be that there were still other immortals who hadn’t appeared?

There were also those twenty youths who had directly appeared. Although their strength couldn’t be seen, the ones that the Dragon King could bring out would definitely not be lower than the infant stage.

Was this the foundation of the Dragon Gate? This was simply too terrifying!

“That devil monkey just now was very powerful. Even if he wasn’t a mid-level immortal, he was still at the peak of the Lower Immortal Realm!”

In the Beast clan’s seat, there was also a monkey that was over two meters tall. He spoke in human language and his eyes flickered as he spoke.

The few immortal gods of the Beast clan slowly nodded their heads!

The few immortal gods of the Holy Medicine Holy Doctor Immortal sect slightly frowned. The few immortal gods exchanged glances and stared at the 20 youths below the arena. Then, they waved their hands at the 10 disciples in front of them!

“Hmph, I didn’t Expect Your Dragon sect to have such capable disciples. This is what makes it interesting. Today, I shall kill you all!”

Hua Gujiang swept his gaze across the group of Golden Swordfish below. He snorted coldly and a strong aura erupted from his body.

“Follow me. Come, Kill!”

He shouted softly and flew directly towards the stage!

“Withdraw the ten disciples!”

Wang Xian said to the golden swordfish below.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The ten nascent realm experts withdrew immediately.

On the arena, Yu Wenhua stared at the golden swordfish with a cold expression. A hint of killing intent flashed in his eyes.

“Kill me. I’ll wait. I hope you won’t disappoint me when the time comes!”

He withdrew his long saber and flew towards the direction of the Yu Wen clan.

“Boom!”

After Yuwen Hua left, the ten young disciples of the Holy Doctor Holy Medicine Immortal sect landed on the arena. In an instant, the entire arena was filled with a terrifying aura.

The dazzling green light, the blazing fire light, and the bone-piercing golden light instantly clashed head-on!

“One at a time, or... together!”

Standing in the middle, a golden swordfish expressionlessly stared at the ten disciples of the Holy Doctor Holy Medicine Immortal sect and coldly said.

“Interesting. I want to kill all of you as soon as possible. Hehe, then let’s kill all of you together. It’ll be more fun this way!”

Hua Gujiang extended his arm and pointed his emerald-green staff forward. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly and a confident expression appeared on his face.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

Beside him, the disciples of the Holy Medicine Immortal sect raised their staffs at the same time.

The fire staff and the wood staff, one red and one green!

When the disciples of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect joined hands, they would be able to display even stronger combat strength.

They even had combined combat techniques.

The ten of them coldly pointed at the Golden Swordfish and the others, their faces revealing a strong sense of confidence!

“The battle is about to begin!”

When the surrounding disciples of the immortal sect saw this scene, they felt a chill in their hearts. Their gazes were fixed on the arena below.
