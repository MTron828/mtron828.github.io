Chapter 174: A Strange Stone

“$250 million!”

Just as Lan Qingyue completed her words, the voice of the middle-aged woman sounded.

She looked at Lan Qingyue and gave a cold smirk.

“The two large jewelry companies are going against each other head-on!”

“A contest between two organizations that are worth dozens of billions each! This is going to be interesting.”

“I heard that Lingyue Sect found a gemstone vein on Linyue Mountain that produces lots of precious gemstones. The Zhou Jewelry has deep connections with Lingyue Sect. After obtaining the support of Lingyue Sect, The Zhou Jewelry has been on a frantic drive to quash Deep-sea Jewelry.”

“It was said that Deep-sea Jewelry’s billion-dollar investment in Dongqing Province failed completely a while ago and they lost everything.”

“The Zhou Jewelry has the backing of a First-class Force while Deep-sea Jewelry doesn’t have the support of any Ancient Martial Arts Forces. When competing with The Zhou Jewelry, Deep-sea Jewelry is at a deep disadvantage!”

“I heard that Deep-sea Jewelry will have a political marriage with the Liu Family of the Tyrannical Sword. I wonder if that’s true!”

The surrounding crowd was looking on in shock as they witnessed the contest of these two large organizations.

Deep-sea Jewelry and The Zhou Jewelry were ginormous organizations in the Southern Province and Dongqing Province. Their financial wealth wasn’t something that ordinary rich people could compete with.

Despite seeing the strong stance put on by the middle-aged woman, Lan Qingyue maintained her emotionless face.

“$331.53 million. If the Zhou Jewelry would like to continue bidding, the Deep-sea Jewelry will choose to give up!” Lan Qingyue said to the middle-aged woman plainly.

When the middle-aged woman heard Lan Qingyue’s bid, she was taken aback slightly as she stared at Lan Qingyue fervently. “I finally understand why the Lan Family will let a little girl like you take over the Deep-sea Jewelry. You’re indeed capable. This piece of Emerald Gemstone is worth at most $331.53 million when made into jewelry. You can choose to ignore the cost of production but if this gets too high, it will become pointless. Nonetheless, what’s important is that the Deep-sea Jewelry couldn’t afford to absorb these losses!”

“But The Zhou Jewelry can!”

The middle-aged lady revealed a faint smile and increased the bid, “$331.54 million!”

Lan Qingyue wasn’t shaken. She did not increase her bid or say a word.

“Congratulations to The Zhou Jewelry for getting a precious piece of Emerald Gemstone at the price of $331.54 million!”

The old man looked at the middle-aged woman in astonishment before glancing past Lan Qingyue.

That’s what a real businessman would look like and how a fully commercialized organization should act.

The middle-aged woman from The Zhou Jewelry was incredible but the girl from Deep-sea Jewelry wasn’t simple either.

The auction resumed.

Pieces after pieces of antiques, jewelry, painting, precious swords and various weapons and spiritual medicine were being auctioned off.

Elder Fang was able to get her hands on a Level 2 spiritual grass for Xiao Yu as she fulfilled her wish.

Wang Xian looked at the various items put up for auction but none really caught his attention.

He didn’t know how to appreciate antiques, jewelry and paintings, and had no need for weapons or spiritual medicine. He simply sat down and drank his tea.

“The next item is rather unique. One could see it as a piece of art. However, it has a faint mysterious energy signature and is indestructible. The consignor has placed this with us for sale at a starting price of $10 million!”

The auction was approaching the end. The old man took a sip of tea before announcing this to the crowd.

A piece of stone was being brought up the stage on a tray. The stone was entirely red with tiny marks on it. It was the size of a fist and looked magical and beautiful.

The crowd below the stage looked inquisitively at this unknown item.

“This piece of stone was obtained by the consignor by chance in the seas. Our Auction House wasn’t able to tell what this is. Even an Inborn expert couldn’t destroy this stone! The starting price is $10 million and the auction will begin now!

The old man continued. The fist-sized stone was projected onto the screen for everyone to take a good look.

“An unknown item being auctioned at $10 million? Isn’t this a little too expensive?”

A Martial Artist looked at the stone inquisitively.

“Even an Inborn expert couldn’t destroy it. It might be a treasure. Perhaps one could make a killing after buying it!”

“Even an Inborn expert couldn’t tell what this is. Do you think you will know? What’s the use of getting it?”

A few Martial Artists exchanged their views and the surrounding crowd nodded their heads in approval.

Since the stone had been examined by Inborn experts without results, what’s the use of getting it?

“Oh? Isn’t this stone pretty beautiful?”

The middle-aged lady from The Zhou Jewelry was interested. She hesitated for a moment before entering a bid price of $10 million.

“The Zhou Jewelry is really rich. All the jewelry sold today was bought by them and they had spent approximately $400-500 million in total. Deep-sea Jewelry isn’t able to get any piece at all!”

“The rich always have the final word. For the near future, The Zhou Jewelry might just become the largest jewelry company in the country!”

The surrounding crowd was astonished. With the support of Lingyue Sect, The Zhou Jewelry might evolve into the largest jewelry company in the future.

When the middle-aged woman heard the exclamations of the crowd, she was cockily pleased as she touched the ruby in her hand.

Hmm? That stone! Why is it giving me a strange sensation?

In a suite on the second floor, Wang Xian was taken aback when he saw that stone. He had felt a strange sensation welling up in his mind.

He felt that this piece of red stone wasn’t dead but alive.

Why would I get this feeling? VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Wang Xian frowned deeply. However, as the distance was too far, he couldn’t get any information.

“This piece of stone isn’t simple!”

Wang Xian focused and made up his mind immediately. Following which, he entered his bid: “$11 million!”

“Suite 13 has made the bid of $11 million. Is there anyone who has a higher bid?” the old man announced loudly.

The middle-aged woman hesitated for a moment before increasing the bid to $12 million.

“$13 million!”

Wang Xian didn’t up his bid immediately. Instead, he hesitated for a moment before shouting.

The middle-aged lady from The Zhou Jewelry didn’t follow and the crowd didn’t join in.

“$13 million, deal! Congratulations Suite 13 for getting this piece of mysterious stone. I hope that you will be able to unveil the mysterious aura around this stone!”

The old man congratulated him.

“Brother, what did you buy this stone for?” Xiao Yu looked at him and asked while feeling lost.

“I feel that this stone isn’t simple. I bought it to do some research on it!” Wang Xian said.

“How can a stone be so special?” Xiao Yu commented but didn’t continue further.

Wang Xian also didn’t answer. His eyes were fixed on the employee carrying the stone towards their suite.

Wang Xian realized that the closer the stone was, the stronger the feeling he had. That palpitation seemed to have triggered a response from the deepest part of his bloodline.

This stone is definitely not simple!

Wang Xian felt his heart tingle and he stood up gradually.

Creak!

The door was opened and the employee walked in with the red stone. “Sir, this is the item you have bid for.”

Wang Xian looked at that stone. His body froze immediately and his eyes were filled with shock!

Essence blood of the Suzaku!
