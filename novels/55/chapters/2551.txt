“This... The Tiger Chaos Demon Country actually teamed up with the Dragon Palace to create the 6th commercial planet, this is too shocking!”

“Creating a planet isn’t hard, however they can actually invite the star Goddess and Yin Xuan goddess to hold a large scale concert, and it’s free, are they that powerful?”

“It seems like the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King knows the star goddess, the Dragon Palace holding a battle pet sale is shocking too, they actually sold over 150 undying god King Battle Pets, 2 god Lord Level 5, over 500,000 eternal God Lord Battle Pets, are they crazy?”

“This is too crazy, over 150 pets, and look at the price, it’s much cheaper than ours, 10 to 20% cheaper than even the wizard Beast Pavilion’s!”

“Crazy, over 150 pets, Damn, can our star South Star system produce an undying god Lord Pet in 10 years?”

Three pieces of news spread out one after another, each with greater influence than the other, when everyone saw the news, their faces were filled with shock!

The star Goddess and Yin Xuan Goddess were holding a free large scale concert on Dragon Star!

The Dragon Palace was selling over 100 undyings warpets!

These pieces of news caused many people, many people’s powers to be extremely excited!

An undyings warpet, it was already good enough for one to appear in the entire star South star system in 10 years!

As for an undyings level 5 warpet, that was something that only appeared once every 10,000 years right?

This level of warpets were hard to capture, taming was even harder!

To Tame an undying level 5 warpet, what level of Beast Tamer Grandmaster could do that?

“I have to go, damn, this dragon star is too strong!”

“It’s more than strong, this is simply heaven defying. The Tiger Chaos Demon Country and Dragon Palace even said that there would be more shocking things happening on the dragon star, more shocking than 150 undying warpets?”

“There’s still a month or so before we can get through the teleportation, I can’t take it anymore!”

Some people were excited, be it the star goddess concert or the battle pets, they all attracted the attention of many people and even many powerful organizations!

“Damn, they actually built a commercial planet, the star Goddess concert, 100 over God Emperor Battle Pets!”

Within the battleship in the space above Xing Hua Planet, the warriors of the three powers gathered once again!

This time, there were 300 to 400 undying emperors gathered!

“They purposely placed the commercial planet not far from Xing Hua planet, they are taking revenge! Peng! Three Seas Gate, what you’ve Done!”

At this time, the president of the Jian Hua Group personally arrived, glaring angrily at the three seas gate leader and shouting!

The chairman of the Black Forest Group also stared at the Three Seas Gate’s group with a cold face!

“Hehe, what’s the use of blaming our three seas gate now?”

The Three Seas Gate’s leader said coldly!

“Three seas gate, everything started because of you. Dragon star will be able to enter in a month’s time. You guys handle this matter. In short, we can’t have another commercial planet in this area!”

The chairman of the Black Forest group said coldly!

“Don’t worry. A commercial planet is not that easy to establish. Just the safety aspect alone is not that easy to resolve!”

The leader of Three Seas Gate said with a face full of anger!

“Leader Ji, this commercial planet is an alliance between the Dragon Palace and the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation. We absolutely can not let them know that it was us who made the move. Otherwise, we will not be able to withstand the fury of the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation!”

The president of the Jianhua group said with a dark face!

“Don’t worry. Not only will we not let them build it, the demon Slayer sect will also not let them build it!”

The sect master of the three seas sect said coldly!

“That’s the most important thing. Otherwise, our Xing Hua planet will be finished!”

The chairman of the Black Forest group said in a deep voice!

“We don’t want to make any more mistakes in this matter!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The chairman said coldly, leaving immediately!

The Black Forest Group followed closely behind!

“Peng!”

The moment everyone left, the three seas sect leader slammed the table heavily, his body filled with a terrifying killing intent!

“Dragon Palace, Dragon King, just you wait!”

“Immediately go to Black Cloud Planet and issue a bounty, after a month, every person killed in Dragon City will be rewarded with 100,000 god Stones!”

The three seas sect leader roared with rage!

“Leader, Black Cloud Planet might not dare to accept this mission. After all, Tiger Chaos Demon Country has an undying level 7 warrior guarding it!”

An old man said softly!

“Then we’ll hire some forces from Black Cloud Planet. In any case, I don’t want that Dragon Planet to exist for a day!”

The three seas sect leader clenched his fists and said coldly!

“Yes!”

The Elders of the three seas sect answered!

Black Cloud planet was the shelter of sinners in the southern star system. The people there were all wanted by the forces of the big planets!

Many forces on black cloud planet gathered together to form a powerful force. There was no need for any force to be unwilling to offend them!

...

“The Tiger Demon Country wants to build a commercial planet? With just you? You killed so many people from the demon Slayer sect. The tiger demon country will not have a day of peace in the future!”

...

On a planet within the ninth grade sky sect’s domain, more than ten elders gathered together. Looking at the news ahead, their eyes were filled with a berserk aura!

“Send more than ten undying godly monarchs to sneak in and make that place a purgatory field!”

The demon slaying sect’s ancestor closed his eyes, his tone cold to the bone!

“Purgatory field, Hehe, make their commercial planet a joke!”

The rest roared eerily!

...

“The Dragon Palace actually teamed up with the tiger chaotic demon country to create a commercial planet? Is it because we didn’t let them enter back then?”

“Maybe, they actually managed to get over 150 undying warpets, it’s shocking, and with the star goddess creating momentum for them, their commercial planet probably has a huge chance of rising!”

On a distant planet, at the peak of the Sky Mountain Sword sect, 5 to 6 old men sat there drinking tea and chatting!

“If they really rise, it would be a huge blow to us here? If we knew that the Dragon Palace had so many warpets, we...”

An old man frowned.

...

“It’s already happened, we don’t need to worry about it, we can just ban it. The Dragon Palace and Tiger Chaos Fey country have enemies, they won’t watch it rise smoothly!”

A white-haired elder in the middle interrupted and shook his head!

“That’s true. Many talents have appeared in the past tens of millions of years, but these are the only ones left in history. Hehe!”

An elder said with a smile, “Come to Old Qin, Let’s play a game of chess!”

At this moment, all the major forces in the entire southern star system were discussing the matter of the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom and the Dragon Palace working together to build a commercial planet!

Some forces were solemn, some were embarrassed, and some did not take it to heart!

Time passed slowly. As the opening of the commercial planet of the Dragon Star was getting closer and closer, the topic of the commercial planet of the Dragon Star was also increasing!

The countdown began when the Dragon Star was officially born!
