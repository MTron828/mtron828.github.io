3350 3349 annihilated the three major forces. The world was in a state of shock

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The Divine Dragon Swayed and let out a series of roars.

“Woo Woo Woo Woo!”

In the sky, the Little Blue House also let out a terrifying howl that reverberated in the sky.

Wang Xian stared at everyone in the steel union with a cold gaze.

Beside him, Ao he and the other devouring dragon swayed their huge bodies and attacked the battleships one after another. They attacked the battleships that were more than 10,000 kilometers in size.

“This is bad!”

When the leader of the steel union saw this scene, his heart pounded violently.

Crack! Crack

He moved his arm and pressed the red button in front of him. The position of the cannon hole was aimed at Wang Xian, ao crab, and the others. His expression was abnormally ugly.

“Die!”

He pressed the attack button consecutively. The terrifying energy began to condense again.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Ao crab and the devouring dragon looked over, their eyes filled with disdain.

They raised their heads, and dark quicksand immediately spewed out from the dragon’s mouth. The dark quicksand directly met the attack.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

A terrifying collision sound rang out, and the pillar of light was destroyed by the dark quicksand. There was still a terrifying dark quicksand that attacked the battleship that was over 10,000 meters away.

“Block it!”

The leader of the Steel Union immediately roared.

Block it!

The attack released by the battleship under him just now was comparable to the destructive power of a universe knight at Level 9.

However, this battleship did not mean that it could contend with a universe knight at Level 9.

Every attack of this level required energy storage, not to mention the difference in mobility.

“Defend!”

The 28 generals looked at the dark quicksand and roared gloomily, Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Curse Spirit Village, attack the two from Dragon Palace, Quick!”

General Jin looked to the side and roared.

Now, they could only rely on curse spirit village and the two from Dragon Palace to die together.

“General Jin, we’re being held back, the Dragon Palace has cursed creatures too, their strength is terrifying!”

The Curse Spirit Village Leader roared ferociously.

He controlled his Knight Level 6 Mech, facing the black cursed dragon in front of him, his expression was extremely ugly.

This was the first time he had seen a cursed creature with such strength.

This was simply unbelievable to them.

“Damn it!”

General Jin was furious when he heard this.

At the same time, he was terrified.

The cursed spirit village had been suppressed and killed by the same cursed being from the Dragon Palace. Now they were facing the powerful defense of the Dragon King and the two level 9 knights from the Dragon Palace.

How could they fight?

How could they fight?

They were no match for them at all!

Boom! Boom! Boom

At this time, the sound of battleships exploding could be heard from the surroundings, and one ship after another fell to the ground.

“Retreat, all the disciples of the Steel Union, Retreat immediately!”

On the battleship, the leader of the Steel Union stood up immediately and ordered loudly with a gloomy expression.

Retreat!

They had lost. The siege on the Dragon Palace had been completely defeated.

The strong disciples of the Lich Kingdom and the zombie clan who had escaped were killed.

If they continued to fight, the iron and steel union would be completely finished.

The order to retreat was still a disaster for the iron and Steel Union.

Because they could only fly if they wanted to escape.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Fortunately, their orders were given and carried out with great force. When the iron and Steel Union issued the order to retreat, all the warships and spaceships quickly prepared to leave the battlefield.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The battleships that were more than 10,000 meters in size also let out a special roar as they charged up their energy and began to run at full speed.

“Is it possible to escape? Even if we manage to catch up to your iron and Steel Union’s lair this time around, we will destroy all of you!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with a violent killing intent.

“Chase after them! Don’t let any of them go!”

He immediately ordered loudly.

“Arrow Dragon, Charm Dragon, Dragon Wizard, Starwood Dragon, climb onto the body of the Little Blue House immediately and chase after them!”

Prime Minister Gui immediately ordered from behind.

“Yes!”

A group of dragon species that were good at long-range attacks and containment immediately flew onto the body of the Little Blue House.

They stood above the Little Blue House and continued to launch long-range attacks.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

Attacks were launched one after another. All kinds of explosions were heard, and the spaceship’s warframe and Warframe fell to the ground.

“Roar, Roar, Roar!”

Ao crab and the others swayed their huge bodies and flew directly toward the battleship in the center.

“Intercept!”

The leader of the Steel Union roared in a low voice. The 28 generals immediately released all kinds of attacks and attacked ao crab and the others.

At the same time, the battleship, which was over ten thousand kilometers in size, poked out countless densely packed gun holes.

The attacks of all kinds of attributes covered the rear, preventing ao crab and the others from rushing over.

Many battleship mecha and spaceships were also hovering above the main battleship. As they retreated, they launched fierce attacks at ao crab and the others.

These densely packed attacks were indeed very useful, greatly disturbing ao crab and the others.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

Ao he and the others swept their draconic tails, and a draconic tail condensed from laws directly attacked the largest battleship.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

In the next moment, countless cannonballs flew towards their draconic tails.

The sound of collision was incessant.

“Leader, all of our energy is not enough to support us to return to Steel City like this.”

A general came to the front of the leader of the steel union and growled in a low voice with an extremely embarrassed expression.

The expression of the leader of the Steel Union kept changing.

The experts of the Dragon Palace chased after them and suppressed them with huge shells. They could only last for a few days at most.

However, after a few days, after the shells were exhausted, it was time for the experts of the Dragon Palace to wreak havoc on them.

At that time, they would have no way to resist.

“Hold on for as long as you can. Get ready to abandon the warship and escape.”

The leader of the Steel Union said with a gloomy face, “As long as we return to Steel City, the Dragon Palace won’t be able to do anything to us.”

“Yes!”

The general’s face changed as he replied in a deep voice.

The situation of the battle had changed drastically.

At first, they thought that Dragon Palace was hiding in Dragon Palace, but they didn’t expect that they would be the ones running back to the base in the end.

With the defense of the Steel Union’s base, two universe Knight Level 9 warriors wouldn’t be able to break through.

However, this battle could be said to be a great defeat for them.

In the future, they wouldn’t have a good time after becoming enemies with Dragon Palace.

In the sky above the edge of the vast heaven-opening primeval continent, the battleships of the steel union were defending and escaping at the same time.

Countless battleships, spaceships, and mechs accompanied them. From time to time, they would explode and fall downwards.

Behind them, the experts of the Dragon Palace were constantly chasing after them.
