Chapter 4196: 4195 burning fruit

Translator: 549690339

“Rumble!”

“Rumble!”

The Rumble of the six universes resounded through the sky above the grassland!

An ancient god tree with a powerful aura took root in the void.

It swayed its branches.

Tianci stood below the ancient god Tree and stepped on its branches.

Endless Wood elemental energy gathered around him.

The energy in TIANCPs body was increasing crazily.

At the same time, the ancient god Tree behind him was also growing rapidly.

This ancient god Tree needed to borrow the power of the universe and the energy absorbed by Tianci’s breakthrough to reach its maturity.

The vast divine tree seemed to have stood between heaven and Earth since ancient times.

The projection turned into a real object.

Below, all the powerful disciples felt this power, and their faces were filled with reverence.

Some wood element cultivators even knelt on the ground and closed their eyes to absorb the wood element energy between heaven and earth.

Wang Xian watched this scene quietly and quietly felt the process of Tianci’s breakthrough.

The strong cultivators from the Dragon Palace also watched quietly.

Buzz

Not long after, the ancient god tree behind Tianci suddenly started to shake.

The entire tree started to grow.

Two brand new branches appeared on the top of the Tree of God, one on the left and one on the right.

One of the two branches circled around the city while the other was filled with sharp thorns!

Wang Xian looked at the two newly grown branches and his eyes flickered slightly.

Following that, in the middle of the tree, at the main trunk, fruits began to grow.

Eight fruits appeared and two of them began to ripen rapidly!

“It’s about to reach maturity! ”

Wang Xian muttered as he looked at the transformation of the divine tree, the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin.

He moved his palm and the immortal slaying calabash, which had been on the ancestral tree, flew towards the divine tree behind tianci.

Following that, Wang Xian looked at some of the branches on the ancestral tree.

The endless branches, the soul-returning branches, the parasol tree branches, the Fuchang tree branches, the Nirvana Lightning tree branches, and a black resurrection Lily all flew towards the ancient divine tree behind tianci. Each of the branches exuded a powerful and majestic aura and luster.

Each of them seemed to be a rare and extraordinary existence.

In the past, the endless parasol tree, the Fuchang tree, and the Nirvana Lightning tree were all branches at the level of a venerable.

However, because of the ancestral tree, they had evolved into the ruler realm.

The soul-returning wood and the immortal-slaying calabash were already at the ruler realm. Now, they were at the peak.

The immortal-slaying calabash was obtained by Wang Xian in the past. It was extremely powerful.

After his nurturing, the immortal sword in the immortal-slaying calabash could instantly kill a powerhouse at the peak of the ruler realm.

However, such a treasure was useless to him.

He gave it to Tianci because the ancient god Tree in Tianci’s body was an offensive heavenly yuan creation treasure.

As long as it was nurtured and rooted in the tree, the immortal-slaying Calabash’s power was only slightly weaker than the last two branches on the tree.

The other branches might not be as powerful.

As for the soul-returning wood, it was purely to increase some special methods and foundations.

One divine tree divine branch after another flew over.

The ancient God Tree extended a branch and accepted it before landing it on its own body.

The Tianyuan Destiny Supreme Treasure in Tianci’s body was very familiar with the ancestral tree in Wang Xian’s body.

Its body also had the aura of the ancestral tree.

The ancestral tree leaned towards supporting and nurturing!

The ancient god Tree in Tianci’s body was attacking!

Boom! Boom

As the ancient god Tree matured, the energy in Tianci’s body also received a huge boost.

His body gradually turned towards the Heaven’s origin creation!

Along with a boom, the shackles were broken.

Tianci, who was standing under the ancient God Tree, opened his eyes and smiled!

He looked at Wang Xian’s position.

“Hualala!”

The ancient god Tree behind him swayed its branches. The eight fruits on the trunk, one of the two that had matured, flew towards Wang Xian!

“A fruit that was born from the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin, this… ”

Around them, the spirits of the dead and the rest were staring at this fruit with burning eyes. Their breathing was a little hurried!

This was a priceless treasure!

This kind of fruit definitely had a terrifying effect!

However, they didn’t dare to snatch it!

Wang Xian stretched out his hand and grabbed the fruit to sense it.

“After consuming the burning fruit, a burst of wood elemental energy will erupt from the body to form a forest. The forest will cover a certain area. Within this area, only by destroying all the trees can one kill the person who consumed the burning fruit. ”

“Within this area, if one is injured, one can consume the trees in the forest and heal their injuries! ”

Wang Xian mumbled as he sensed the information regarding the burning fruit.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

He could not tell how strong the burning fruit was just from some information.

However, as a divine tree of Heaven’s origin, it could only bear eight fruits in its lifetime.

Its power must be extremely terrifying!

The ancient divine tree was different from the ancestral tree in terms of offensive power.

The ancestral tree could bear dozens of fruits of Heaven’s origin!

“Foster father, mother, I’ve broken through! ”

Tianci sensed the energy in his body and smiled at Wang Xian and the rest.

His body moved and he flew over immediately!

“Congratulations to nephew Mu Litianci for breaking through to the realm of Heaven’s origin! ”

The undead golden leopard sand city immediately congratulated loudly!

“Congratulations to Lord Mu Litian for breaking through to the Heavenly Yuan realm of Destiny!”

“We pay our respects to Lord Mu Litian! ”

Below, all the elite disciples immediately knelt on the ground and congratulated loudly, bowing and bowing!

“Mm, I, Mu Litian, the six beings of the universe, will definitely protect us, the people of the Universe! ”

TIANCI’s gaze focused as he swept his gaze across all the powerful disciples and said solemnly!

This was the responsibility of a heavenly Yuan creation stage powerhouse!

It was also the responsibility of a heavenly Yuan creation stage powerhouse!

(‘We worship Lord Mu Litianci as our faith. We will fight alongside Lord Mu

Litianci and protect our home! ”

Below, all the powerful disciples ‘eyes were burning as they roared loudly in their hearts!

This was the recognition of all living beings towards their own universe.

This was the unity of their beliefs towards the future before the arrival of the calamity!

“Haha, Our Six Paths Universe has gained a top-tier heavenly yuan destiny realm powerhouse. This is the great fortune of our six paths universe. Inform all the tribes to celebrate! ”

Earth Sand City laughed loudly and announced loudly!

“Yes, Sir! ”

Below, disciples immediately responded!

“Let’s go, this time, we have to celebrate properly! ”

Golden Leopard said with a smile.

The breakthrough given by the heavens was also a good thing for them.

When the apocalypse came, their pressure would be much less.

Under the circumstances where they could protect their own universe, they could also go to other universes to search for resources and opportunities.

This was the law of the apocalypse.

The strong preyed on the weak.

The weak protected their own universe, while the strong went out to plunder!

It was cruel!
