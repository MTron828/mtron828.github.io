Chapter 1527: 1,527 voices traveled across thousands of miles

“Sir, I... I really don’t have the money. I don’t have the money to treat the injuries on my body!”

A frightened voice came from the middle-aged man’s mouth as he shouted at Wang Xian loudly.

“With the strength of a half-step void interpretation, can you not have a few hundred thousand upper-grade spirit stones to treat the injuries on your body?”

Lao Hu sensed the strength of the middle-aged man and a hint of coldness appeared on his face.

“No, I have all my spirit stones...”

“Shut up!”

Wang Xian looked at the middle-aged man and a hint of darkness flashed in his eyes.

Someone was taking advantage of his good intentions. He was simply courting death.

He waved his arm and a beam of bright energy instantly slashed towards the middle-aged man’s arms.

“What?”

The middle-aged man was shocked and his eyes revealed a look of horror. He wanted to dodge in a hurry.

“Ah Ah!”

“Bang Bang!”

However, a scream came from his mouth, followed by the sound of his arm falling to the ground.

The clothes on his upper body were melted by the power of light. There was a piece of golden heart armor on his chest.

“This...”

The other nine people’s faces turned extremely pale when they saw this scene.

This priest Wang had actually... Actually cut off both of his arms.

“HMPH!”

Old Hu, who was standing at the side, was slightly stunned when he saw Wang Xian directly cut off the middle-aged man’s arms. However, when he saw the heart armor on his chest, his expression turned cold.

“To be able to wear a heart armor of the first level of the void interpretation stage, doesn’t he have hundreds of thousands of high-grade spirit stones to treat his illness?”

Old Hu walked forward, grabbed his body, and walked out.

“He actually dared to deceive Reverend Wang. He’s really courting death!”

“He wants to take advantage of Reverend Wang’s kindness and give him free treatment. This kind of person really deserves to die!”

The nine people looked at the middle-aged man who had been taken away, and their faces revealed a cold expression.

“Peng!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

At the entrance of the sacred medicine clinic, old Hu directly threw the middle-aged man’s body onto the ground at the entrance, attracting the astonished gazes of everyone around him.

“Reverend Wang only treats poor people who don’t have the financial ability. If someone pretends to be him, he will cut off both of his arms!”

Old Hu warned loudly to the thousands of people who were still queuing in front of him.

“What? Someone actually appeared. Damn it, this damn fellow!”

“Look at the heart armor on his chest. He’s at least at the first level of the profound void tier. Damn it, he has the heart armor at the first level of the profound void tier, but he doesn’t have the ability to treat patients?”

Instantly, everyone looked at the middle-aged man lying on the ground. Their eyes were filled with killing intent.

They did not have money. Some of them had been injured for a long time and had been enduring it. However, there was actually someone who had the ability to treat patients but still wanted to take advantage of them.

This caused everyone around to stare at him indignantly. If it were not for the fact that they could not make a move here, the middle-aged man on the ground would definitely have been killed.

When the middle-aged man felt the murderous gazes around him, he immediately lowered his head and fled into the distance with a face full of fear.

“Ptui, good job crippling him. Such a person should be killed!”

“That’s right. He really took priest Wang’s kindness for his own convenience!”

The people around him said with contempt.

“Your body’s condition is a little special. Stand aside first. I’ll treat them!”

On the fourth floor, Wang Xian pointed at a young man and said.

“Yes, yes, Reverend Wang... Please save me and help me remove the dark soul in my body. I don’t want to die yet!”

The young man immediately knelt on the ground with a pleading look on his face.

When the other eight people heard the young man’s words, their pupils constricted slightly. They retreated to the side with a horrified look on their faces.

“I will show you a private view later. Wait by the side!”

Wang Xian nodded his head lightly at him. He looked at the other people and rays of light immediately covered them.

“Thank you, Reverend Wang. Thank you!”

The eight people thanked him respectfully and walked out.

Wang Xian looked at the young man who was kneeling on the ground and sized him up with his pair of dragon eyes.

“Sir, I. . . I was entered by a soul of darkness. I spent all my savings but was unable to get rid of it. Please save me, Sir! Please save me!”

The young man was kneeling on the ground and kowtowing non-stop.

“Pastor Wang, once a soul of darkness enters a person’s body, it will affect a person’s rationality. Once it enters a person’s body, it will be very difficult unless one is able to suppress it with great strength...”

Old Hu reminded him in a low voice.

“Sir, I am using the light array to suppress it now. This... This is the suppression array that I bought with my last savings. Once the energy is used up, I...”

The young man immediately lifted his clothes and spoke while trembling.

“I am very interested in this soul of darkness. Don’t worry, I will do my best to Treat You!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he walked towards the young man and sized up the soul of darkness in his body.

“Thank you, sir! Thank you, Sir!”

The young man thanked him respectfully.

The entry of the Soul of darkness into his body almost caused a heaven’s favorite like him to collapse.

His strength, which was at level one of the Seethrough realm, was reduced to level eight of the extraordinary realm due to the soul of darkness.

“Is this the Soul of Darkness?”

Wang Xian had heard of the name of the darkness soul since he came to the ruins of the divine kingdom.

Now that he had seen it with his own eyes, it was truly miraculous.

“As expected of the darkness soul that made countless powerhouses tremble in fear!”

Wang Xian stared at the young man’s body. There was a ball of dark energy in his body. This dark energy was like a living creature.

It exuded a brutal and sinister aura.

In fact, the Soul of darkness had a life form. It was a life form formed from dark energy.

Wang Xian placed his arm on the young man’s body. A wave of light energy attacked the dark energy.

“Ah!”

However, at this moment, the young man let out a painful scream. A layer of cold sweat appeared on his body instantly.

Wang Xian could sense that this soul of darkness was able to fight against the light energy.

Even if it couldn’t withstand it, he could still escape to other locations.

Especially to the head.

The head was the most important vital part of a human. Once the power of light entered his head, the soul of darkness would be able to kill the young man if it resisted.

Wang Xian let go of his hand and stared at this soul of darkness with a twinkle in his eyes. He frowned slightly.

This was the most troublesome existence that Wang Xian had encountered during his treatment of over a thousand patients this year.

“It’s a little tricky. I’m not sure yet. Come to my place after five o’clock every day. I’ll think of a way to treat you!”

After studying for two hours, Wang Xian said to the young man.

“Yes, sir, yes, Sir!”

The young man was slightly disappointed, but he quickly pulled himself together. At the very least, Wang Xian had not given up on him, and he would not give up on himself.

For the next seven to eight days, Wang Xian treated everyone for free from eight to five o’clock every day. The number of people treated every day was no less than a thousand.

In just a short week, the name of priest Wang of the holy medicine shop had spread across thousands of miles in the ruins of the divine kingdom.

Every day, more than a thousand people would rush to the entrance of the Holy Medicine Shop.

Those who had been cured would look at the people around them gratefully and say how good priest Wang was and how amazing he was.

So that the holy medicine shop business is much better.

And many people call pastor Wang: Hanging Pot to help the world, benevolence!
