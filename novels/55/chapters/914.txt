Chapter 915: 0916 was killing in all directions

Translator: 549690339

“Kill!”

The area of ten kilometers in front of them was filled with densely packed golden bladefish.

There were the most golden bladefish at transcendent-level one, followed by transcendent-level two, transcendent-level three, and even transcendent-level five.

The number of Golden Bladefish was dozens of times more than the number of mercenary groups.

One by one, the mercenary groups spread out and attacked the golden bladefish below.

Wang Xian led ao Jian and the rest to attack a spot in the middle.

There were more than ten thousand people. For at least three to four hundred thousand goldfish, it was very little.

However, the strength of more than ten thousand members of the mercenary group was much stronger than the goldfish.

Among the members of the mercenary group, there was also an extraordinary level six powerhouse.

“Burn the river and boil the sea!”

Wang Xian came to the sky above the goldfish. Without any hesitation, he unleashed a terrifying fire abhijna.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

The moment he arrived, hundreds of goldfish below him waved their golden knife-like arms and slashed at him.

With a swing of the knife, a 100-meter-wide knife mark was formed.

In an instant, hundreds of knife marks were comparable to an attack of a level 2 transcendent.

“Boom!”

However, before the knife light could reach him, the terrifying flames covered an area of three to four thousand meters below him.

The terrifying flames melted the saber ray directly and landed on the ground. In an instant, it covered more than a hundred golden knife fish.

A single divine ability instantly killed more than a hundred golden knife fish, including four to five extraordinary level three golden knife fish.

“HMPH, using a divine ability as soon as you come up. You’re really courting death!”

At this moment, a cold snort came from not far away.

Wang Xian glanced at the long-haired young man and ignored him.

“Do you want to compare our killing speed, trash?”

The long-haired young man obviously held a grudge against Wang Xian’s words of trash. He mocked him coldly.

“You are not qualified!”

Wang Xian did not have a good impression of these prideful young men. He opened his mouth directly.

“HMPH, Coward!”

The long-haired young man snorted coldly. More than ten long swords appeared around him in an instant and attacked the surrounding goldfish.

Jin Liuyan, who was not far away, took a glance at this place. Water arrows were shot at the goldfish.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

More than ten long swords killed more than ten goldfish in an instant. Clearly, the long-haired young man was not weak either.

Whoosh

Wang Xian opened his mouth and spat out the fire dragon bead instantly. He attacked the goldfish one by one.

Wang Xian’s arm changed slightly and turned into a dragon claw. He landed directly in the middle of the goldfish.

“Kill!”

His face was ice-cold. He waved his dragon claw and killed a goldfish with one strike. Even if it was a level 3 transcendent, he would be killed instantly!

“HMM, so strong!”

The long-haired young man took a glance at Wang Xian and a hint of seriousness appeared in his eyes.

“10,000 swords, Slash!”

At this moment, a cold voice came from the side.

The long-haired young man quickly looked over and saw 11 middle-aged men wielding the same golden longswords on the right.

A unified move, a unified attack, and a unified divine ability.

In an instant, thousands of longswords appeared in front of each of them. The 11 of them moved and charged forward together.

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

A single charge of 3,000 meters killed 4,000 to 5,000 golden swordfish. The terrifying attack was blocked by three transcendent level four Golden Swordfish.

“Boom!”

Wang Xian rushed to the front of the few transcendent level four Golden Swordfish in a frenzy. His dragon claws enlarged by three meters and grabbed a transcendent level four golden swordfish. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Crack! Crack!”

The body of the Golden Swordfish split open and died instantly!

Ao Jian and the rest of the golden swordfish swung their longswords and slashed at the other two transcendent level four Golden Swordfish

PFFT! PFFT

Eleven terrifying sword rays flashed and killed the two golden swordfish.

“So Strong!”

The long-haired young man’s expression changed slightly. In an instant, he killed a transcendent level four Golden Swordfish. That Kid’s strength was not weaker than his.

“Kill, Kill, Kill!”

There were simply too many golden mackerel. However, this made Wang Xian extremely excited.

His body moved quickly as he killed one golden mackerel after another with his dragon claws.

In less than five minutes, Wang Xian had killed more than a thousand golden mackerel.

Ao Jian and the rest were also not slow in their killing speed. Eleven of them had killed more than two thousand golden mackerel.

A massacre!

The golden machete fish was not very strong. Wang Xian relied on his terrifying physical strength and dragon claws to kill them quickly.

A massacre. Not a single golden machete fish could withstand two of his attacks.

“What kind of supernatural power is that Claw of his? How can it be so strong?”

The long-haired young man looked at Wang Xian and the rest with a serious expression.

“Which mercenary group is this? Why haven’t I heard of it before? Its combat strength is so insane!”

This time, even Jin Liuyan was astonished.

In the few mercenary groups nearby, with the young man as the leader, the number of goldfish they killed in a short period of time exceeded the total number of four to five mercenary groups in the surrounding area!

“D * mn, they’re so violent. Their physiques are so strong?”

“Which mercenary group is that guy from, Bro! He’s too fierce, killing much faster than us!”

The other mercenary groups also looked over in shock.

The strength of their mercenary groups was not weak either, all of them were 3-4 stars silver rank.

Their leader was an extraordinary type 5 expert, but the number of kills he killed was still far from the 12 of them.

“It’s a pity that the strange demon can’t be exposed. If the strange demon attacked together, its speed would be even faster!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. With the physique of a divine dragon, the energy and physical strength in his body were dozens of times stronger than that of a human. He didn’t feel the slightest bit tired when he killed.

“D * mn, look ahead. The leader of the Sword Scar mercenary group is too abnormal. He killed over a thousand golden mackerel fish in one strike!”

“The few large mercenary groups in Shenghai town are all there. Even though they were surrounded by 70,000 to 80,000 golden knife fish, they still managed to kill everyone in all directions. Awesome!”

At this moment, exclamations could be heard from the surroundings.

Wang Xian raised his head and looked ahead. He noticed that there were terrifying attacks coming from the front.

70,000 to 80,000 golden knife fish were surrounding and attacking more than a dozen people.

These people were all the leaders of the top mercenary groups in Shenghai Town. The strongest knife marks was at level seven of the supernatural realm.

“Interesting!”

Wang Xian licked his tongue and looked towards the center of the group. He then flew towards the area where the goldfish were the most concentrated.

“D * mn, is he f * cking courting death?”

The few young men who were following the long-haired young man shouted in surprise when they saw Wang Xian suddenly charging over.

“He’s courting death!”

The long-haired young man said disdainfully.

Entering the encirclement without the strength of a transcendent-level five was simply courting death!

“Although it’s not good to expose the physique of the Divine Dragon, it shouldn’t be a problem to expose the other attributes!”

Wang Xian licked his tongue and looked at the nearly 100,000 golden mackerel fish in front of him.

He flew up high.

The wood world descended!

Spirit Enchantment!

The long-haired young man’s expression changed drastically!
