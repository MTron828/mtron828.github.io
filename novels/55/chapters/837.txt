Chapter 838: Channel 0839 opened up the spiritual energy impact

Translator: 549690339

Wait for me to step onto the peak and become the Empress!

A domineering voice echoed in the Dragon Palace as his figure disappeared.

Wang Xian looked towards the place where she disappeared. He knew where Feng Luan went, the deepest part of the ocean, 10,000 meters under the sea.

There was a passageway there. According to Feng Luan, it was a spatial passageway. It was a passageway opened up by a terrifying almighty with the power to break the heavens.

As for which mighty figure it was, she did not know. However, she was certain that the experts of the transcendent continent could not do it.

Once her strength reached the level of a transcendent, she would be able to circle the earth in half an hour. Her speed was extremely terrifying.

In a trench ten thousand meters deep under the sea, a sacred figure of flames appeared in the sky above the abyss. She looked down at the trench and spread her arms slightly.

“Chirp!”

A phoenix cry sounded and she directly dived down. The terrifying flames directly collided with a black vortex below.

“Boom!”

The strange vortex seemed to cause even space and time to tremble. The vortex slowly opened up under the powerful flames.

Feng Luan’s eyes shone brightly. Flames shot out from her eyes. She waved her arms and two huge wings appeared behind her.

The wings moved towards the vortex. The vortex slowly split open and the scene of another world appeared.

Feng Luan’s eyes revealed a look of desire.

“Not good. The spiritual energy is attacking. The spiritual energy on Earth is thin, but after opening the passage to the transcendent world, the spiritual energy from the transcendent world will rush into Earth!”

Feng Luan’s expression changed slightly. This attack was the most violent when the passage was just opened.

It was like the moment the dam opened and released water, it would cause a terrifying impact.

Under this terrifying impact, it would directly cause the death of living creatures.

And although Feng Luan’s strength was extraordinary, this was not a dam, but the impact of two worlds.

The terrifying spirit qi directly surged towards Feng Luan, causing a trace of fear to appear in her eyes.

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

Her name was called out, and the Vermilion Bird Flame emitted a terrifying radiance on her body.

“Boom!”

However, at the instant of the Spirit Qi’s impact, the flame on her body seemed to have been directly poured into a basin of water, and was almost extinguished.

“No...”

A rarely seen panic appeared in Feng Luan’s eyes. She knew that she had acted rashly. She should have opened the passageway and waited for the Spirit Qi’s impact to calm down before rushing over.

Now, she was undoubtedly courting death.

“Buzz!”

At this moment, a red light suddenly lit up at the location of her heart. The light was like a flame that covered her entire body.

“This is?”

Feng Luan was slightly stunned. A smile slowly appeared on her face. “This is the third life you’ve Saved Me!”

She looked ahead and slowly squeezed into the passage under the flame.

After Feng Luan entered, the impact of the spiritual energy did not close.

Once the passage between the two worlds was opened, it would be difficult to close it, especially under the impact of the spiritual energy.

The impact of the spiritual energy would only disappear when the spiritual energy on Earth was on par with the spiritual energy on the supernatural continent.

“Huh?”

A day later, when Wang Xian came out from the Dragon Palace, his mind suddenly stirred. His gaze was fixed on the position of the Dragon Array in the Dragon Palace, and his eyes were sparkling.

“The spiritual energy has changed. It is getting stronger every moment!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes and quietly sensed the changes in the spiritual energy.

He stayed in the Dragon Palace. The spiritual energy here was twelve times that of the outside world, so the changes in the spiritual energy were very obvious.

Now that the spiritual energy was increasing at a terrifying speed, it was unexpected that the spiritual energy in the outside world had also undergone a huge change.

His body moved and he arrived outside the Dragon Palace. He felt the fluctuation of the spiritual energy and looked towards the west.

Following the concentration of the spiritual energy, Wang Xian flew in this direction.

Hiss

When he arrived at the ten-thousand-meter-deep trench at the bottom of the sea, Wang Xian stared ahead and took a deep breath.

What a terrifying spiritual energy. I even have a feeling of not being used to it here

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and noticed that there were numerous corpses floating around.

Spiritual Energy was a great tonic for every living creature.

However, if one replenished too many good things, it could also make one die. It was just like an ordinary person who consumed a grade-8 elixir. Not only would they not improve their cultivation, but they would also die. The terrifying spiritual energy impact would kill the living creatures.

This spiritual energy impact was not like the spiritual energy waterfall when the nine cauldrons appeared.

Compared to the spiritual energy impact, the spiritual energy waterfall was like a small stream, and this was a vast ocean.

“It should be Feng Luan who opened the passage between the two worlds, allowing the spiritual energy of the transcendent world to flood into Earth.”

“According to Feng Luan, the spiritual energy of the transcendent continent is fifty times more than here!”

“In other words, the spiritual energy on Earth is equal to that of the supernatural continent!”

“And the area of the supernatural continent is 100 times larger than Earth. The territory of the Feng dynasty was equivalent to the size of Earth!”

“This is a great opportunity for Earth, and it is also a great opportunity for humans on Earth. In the future, Earth will officially transition from the era of technology to the era of cultivation!”

Wang Xian took a deep breath. The real world change was about to begin!

“The spiritual energy around here is the most terrifying. However, the effect of cultivating here will be very poor. Under the impact of the spiritual energy, it might even damage one’s body. The Dragon Palace is just right and not too far away. There is also the Dragon Palace Array. There is no need to move the Dragon Palace Here!”

“Next, we will enter the dynasty of evolution. I didn’t expect that this incident was because of the Empress!”

Wang Xian smiled. The impact of the spiritual energy this time was of great benefit to the Dragon Palace. It could shorten the gap between the Dragon Palace and the supernatural continent.

“In the next period of time, all members of the Dragon Palace, cultivate quickly!”

Wang Xian’s figure moved and returned to the Dragon Palace.

He immediately announced that all the members of the Dragon Palace had started to cultivate in seclusion.

Currently, there were aquatic creatures breaking through the Dragon Gate every day to become members of the Dragon Palace. After that, when the dragon caves in the Dragon Pool had gathered to a certain extent, the more outstanding members of the Dragon Palace would be allowed to enter the dragon pool.

They would be allowed to choose the direction of evolution.

They would be allowed to evolve into demon monkeys, strange demons, Golden Swordfish, Yakshas, and thunder prawns. This would allow the few races to continuously increase their combat strength.

The business of the Dragon Gate forging workshop was getting worse by the day. Wang Xian decided to close it down and everyone went into seclusion to cultivate.

Wang Xian even called Xiao Yu over and asked her to go into seclusion to cultivate.

The rich spiritual energy gradually covered the entire earth. This made all the forces and immortals look excited.

Even the ordinary people were excited when they heard that the spiritual energy on Earth was increasing.

The great cultivation era was coming.

The Eastern Immortal sect began to recruit disciples because they did not need to worry about resources now. The powerful spiritual energy was enough to maintain their cultivation.

In the west, the divine realm’s spirit locking array was directly opened. In the past, the divine realm was not for outsiders to obtain because it was used to seal off spiritual energy.

However, the spiritual energy in the outside world was already more abundant than the spiritual energy inside. The spirit locking array was used to counter-suppress the spiritual energy.

The true appearance of Asgard!

All the people were martial artists!
