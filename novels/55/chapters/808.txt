Chapter 809: 0810’s terrifying battle

Translator: 549690339

“Haha, What Do I Want? I want to destroy you all!”

A domineering voice sounded in the entire sky, and a terrifying killing intent instantly filled the entire sky.

Everyone was shocked, and even the faces of all the immortal gods from the flat territory, holy medicine, and medicine sects changed drastically.

In the distance, all the immortal sect experts and even the immortal gods who had been paying attention to this place heard this voice, and their pupils constricted slightly.

In the war between the immortal gods, twelve immortal gods fought eighteen. Although the Dragon Palace could be said to be on the side of absolute suppression, after the battle broke out between the two sides, even if the Dragon King could win, he would definitely lose a lot.

It was even normal to lose four or five immortal gods in this battle.

All the experts who had been paying attention to this place guessed that the Dragon King would make the Holy Doctor and Holy Medicine Immortal sect pay a huge price and then reconcile.

But no one had expected that the Dragon King would say such a thing. Even the people of the Holy Doctor Holy Medicine Immortal sect hadn’t expected it.

“Destroy us. You have to think about the consequences. Do you think you can destroy us so easily?”

Bian Jiangtu shouted with an extremely embarrassed expression. His fat face turned red as if he was a volcano that was about to erupt.

It was too sullen.

They were originally valiant and ready to head to the Dragon Gate to destroy it and shake the world.

In the end, when the oath ceremony was held at the city gate, all the disciples of the immortal sect were ignited to the extreme. The eighteen immortals of the other party directly pressed down on them.

They were suffocated by the pressure. Now, they were going to kill them. How could they not be angry?

Bian Jiangtu glared at him angrily.

“Haha, Kill!”

Wang Xian laughed out loud. He didn’t want to continue arguing with them. He came here today to destroy the life and Death Holy Medicine Immortal sect.

As for reconciliation?

There was no need.

If he didn’t have such powerful strength and influence, he would have been destroyed by the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect today.

Therefore, since they were enemies, he would fight!

“Roar! Roar!”

The moment Wang Xian gave the order, all the immortals in the Dragon Palace started to move.

Wang Xian was the first to bear the brunt. His body moved and he let out a majestic roar, “Roar!”

In an instant, Wang Xian transformed into a divine dragon. His 15-meter divine dragon body attacked the flat territory.

Beside him, three dragon balls were spinning above his head, emitting a terrifying power.

The nine flood dragons swayed their bodies and turned into green shadows, attacking forward.

The sound of thunder reverberated through the Heaven and earth, and a lightning hammer was raised.

Golden and sharp metal, graceful flowing water, terrifying demonic qi, and a huge sea-pacifying divine needle.

The attack that erupted in an instant made everyone from the Holy Doctor, Holy Medicine, and Immortal sect look terrified.

The Dragon King really dared to attack. He really wanted to exterminate them and fight to the death.

“Kill!”

Bian Jiang Tu’s expression changed drastically when he saw Wang Xian turning into the legendary divine dragon. He roared loudly and went up to meet Wang Xian.

“Kill!”

The rest of the immortal sects gritted their teeth and went up to meet him.

Behind them was their lair. There was nowhere to hide and nowhere to hide. They could only kill.

Boom! Boom! Boom

In an instant, the wind attribute, the terrifying demonic qi, the explosive fire and metal attribute, the green wood attribute, the blue water attribute, the wind and cloud attribute, and the heaven and Earth attribute changed.

“Hiss, they are really fighting. The Dragon King has turned into a divine dragon. Oh My God, this is unbelievable!”

“Dragon Palace Dragon King, so the Dragon King can turn into a divine dragon. What a terrifying pressure. It’s the legendary Divine Beast of China!”

“The battle between the immortal sects! The real battle between the immortal sects! Thirty immortals fighting against each other! Hiss!”

The spectators who were watching from ten kilometers away retreated once again. The battle between the immortals had affected a huge area. It was too terrifying!

“Boom!”

The first collision sounded. It was the prelude to the battle between the two terrifying forces!

“Ahhhh!”

At the moment of the collision, screams of pain could be heard. The more than 1,000 disciples behind the two immortal sects, except for those who were half-step immortal gods, and even those at the infant realm, were affected by the battle in an instant, they let out a series of terrified screams.

“Even if you can destroy us, I will still make you suffer a great loss!”

Bian Jiangtu’s body was emitting a monstrous flame. The entire sky above his head had turned fiery red because of him.

He held a bright red staff in his hand. With a wave of his arm, flaming meteorites were hurled at Wang Xian from the sky.

The flaming meteorites covered an area of five kilometers in front of him.

Wang Xian raised his head slightly. The water dragon pearl above his head shook slightly and formed a water curtain. The water curtain covered the sky and blocked the flaming meteorites in the sky.

Wang Xian swayed his body and flew directly towards Bian Jiangtu. A pair of dragon claws grabbed towards his body.

The terrifying dragon claws seemed to be able to tear the world apart.

Bian Jiangtu looked at Wang Xian’s approximately 15-meter-tall body and his expression was extremely solemn. He tapped the staff in his hand and a pillar of fire as thick as an arm shot towards him like an aurora.

Wang Xian opened his mouth and let out a roar. The fire pillar with a diameter of three meters went straight towards him.

“Fire and water attack at the same time!”

Bian Jiangtu’s expression changed slightly and a look of shock appeared in his eyes.

He waved his arm, and a fire shield appeared in front of him.

“Boom!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The fire shield only lasted for half a second, but by using this time, he had already moved to a position 1,000 meters away.

The terrifying dragon flames descended.

And that was the direction of the sacred city. It was covered by a green light, which was the power of the array formation.

But even with the array formation, all the disciples and family members of the two immortal sects looked terrified when they saw the battle between the immortals and gods outside.

After all, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace was too powerful, and the number of immortals and gods was completely suppressed!

“Not good!”

At this moment, everyone in the sacred city looked terrified when they saw the terrifying dragon flame attack.

“Crack! Crack! Crack!”

The Dragon Flame landed on the array formation of the sacred city, and the sound of it breaking could be heard.

The green light shone brightly, and then began to flicker.

“Bang!”

Finally, the defense of the formation was broken. Everyone in the sacred city was instantly exposed to the battle between the immortals.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

In an instant, thousands of people from the sacred city knelt on the ground.

Just the terrifying pressure alone made it difficult for them to breathe.

“Go to the sky!”

Bian Jiangtu looked extremely embarrassed when he saw that the formation was broken with a single strike. If they continued to fight here, everyone in the sacred city would be affected and die.

“Let them go to the sky!”

Wang Xian did not want to affect tens of millions of humans. The group of Immortals instantly arrived at a height of 10,000 meters.

“Ah!”

At this moment, a scream was suddenly heard.

A Holy Doctor, Holy Medicine, and Immortal God suddenly appeared behind him when he was distracted while flying into the sky.

A terrifying claw penetrated his body directly.

The first immortal God died. The battle between the Immortals continued!
