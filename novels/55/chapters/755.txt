“Grand Elder!”

The flower queen glanced at the four middle-aged men and said to a white-bearded old man who was sitting in the middle.

“Flower Queen, come here. The distinguished guests from the Holy Medicine Immortal sect are here. Come over and have a chat!”

The white-bearded old man said to the flower queen with a smile.

“Yes, Grand Elder!”

The Queen of flowers nodded with a smile.

“Oh? It’s him!”

At this moment, a middle-aged man among the dozen of people standing at the side looked at Wang Xian who was beside the Queen of Flowers. A hint of surprise flashed across his eyes.

He sized her up with his eyes that were flickering.

“Hehe, this must be the queen of flowers. She is as strong as a man. It seems that she lives up to her reputation. Who Is This?”

A green-robed elder looked at the Queen of flowers and asked with a smile. Then, his gaze landed on Wang Xian, who was shoulder to shoulder with the Queen of flowers. A hint of doubt flashed across his eyes!

“Sir, I know him. I know him!”

At this moment, before the Queen of Flowers could speak.., the middle-aged man at the side pointed at Wang Xian with a cold gaze and said, “I have seen his image. He is the Dragon King, the Dragon King who destroyed our lineage in the real world. Furthermore, there is a high possibility that my father and elder Bian were killed by him!”

The middle-aged man stared at Wang Xian with fury in his eyes. He shouted with an agitated expression.

“Dragon King? Dragon Gate?”

The green-robed elder was stunned. He narrowed his eyes and sized up Wang Xian.

Hua Hou frowned slightly and said immediately, “Grand Elder, this lord is a guest!”

“Lord?”

The eight middle-aged men and the elder were slightly shocked. A hint of solemnity flashed across the green-robed Elder’s face.

“Sorry to disturb you. Everyone from the Natural Born Immortal sect, Dragon King of the Dragon Gate, is here to pay a visit!”

Wang Xian cupped his hands at the four middle-aged men from the natural born immortal sect. When he retracted his hands, he slowly waved his arm behind him!

“Ah!”

The middle-aged man’s expression changed drastically. He stared at his arm in horror.

At this moment, his arm actually withered like a tree in an instant.

“Shut up!”

An elder beside him quickly said to the middle-aged man.

“Huff! Huff!”

The middle-aged man widened his eyes and panted heavily. He was filled with fear!

The green-robed elder narrowed his eyes slightly when he saw Wang Xian crippled one of his disciples’arm.

The three middle-aged elders beside him also looked at Wang Xian coldly.

“Dragon King of the Dragon Gate, you must have killed the disciples of the Hua family and the Bian family, right?”

The green-robed elder looked at Wang Xian and said plainly.

“A bunch of people who are looking for death just offended me!”

Wang Xian said calmly and honestly.

The power of an immortal God could not be offended.

As an immortal god, even if they signed an agreement forbidding the immortal God to attack, they were still an immortal God after all.

Anyone who dared to provoke the immortal God could be killed by the immortal God!

This was the right of a powerful immortal God!

“Hehe, let’s put aside our grudges for now. Come and have a taste of our natural born immortal sect’s wooden stem tea!”

The white-bearded old man looked at the scene and said calmly.

The Holy Medicine Immortal sect and the Holy Doctor Immortal sect were very powerful. However, the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate was also a middle-level immortal. Furthermore, their strength was unknown. Naturally, their natural born immortal sect would not offend anyone!

Wang Xian cupped his fists at the white-bearded old man and sat at the side.

The flower queen also sat beside Wang Xian.

“Grand Elder, this Lord Wang Xian is here to ask for a few wood spirit fruits!”

The flower queen whispered to the white-bearded old man.

“Yes!”

The white-bearded old man nodded his head.

“Elder Mu, this time, we are prepared to cooperate with the Holy Doctor Immortal sect in the aspect of spiritual herbs and elixirs. Your Immortal sect has the most abundant spiritual herbs in the jianghu while Our Holy Medicine Immortal sect has the best alchemy skills in the entire jianghu. If the two of US cooperate and monopolize the entire Jianghu’s elixir market, it will be a huge benefit for our immortal sect!”

The green-robed old man took a glance at Wang Xian and spoke to the white-bearded old man.

“Mutual benefits. Naturally, we naturally agree to it. We will have to discuss the details in the future!”

The white-bearded old man said with a smile.

“Haha, of course. Mutual benefits. If we can monopolize the medicinal pills in the martial arts world, our influence can be imagined!”

The green-robed elder laughed loudly, following that, he looked at the Xichang tree next to him. “The Divine Tree of the esteemed immortal sect is still emitting a rich vitality. This time, we have another matter. The tree demon that we have planted for a thousand years has already taken shape. We hope that we can use the Xichang tree to awaken our spiritual wisdom!”

“The tree demon has already taken shape?”

A hint of solemnity flashed in the white-bearded man’s eyes. “I didn’t expect that you guys could actually nurture this kind of ancient divine tree to take shape. It’s truly commendable!”

“So What? The yield tree of our immortal sect has already withered, but the service tree of Your Immortal sect is still full of vitality!”

The green-robed old man slowly shook his head.

“The vitality is only on the surface. The service tree doesn’t have much life left. Sigh!”

The white-bearded old man slowly stood up and looked at the divine tree beside him, sighing slightly.

“This kind of divine tree won’t be able to support its growth with the density of the spiritual energy here. Once it is consumed, it will wither. If we cultivate tree demons...”

The flower queen looked at Hattori Changshu and said with a frown.

“Once it is used to cultivate tree demons, Hattori Changshu will completely wither. Our Holy Doctor Immortal sect has two tree demons. If the natural born immortal sect agrees, we will use them to pay the price of Hattori Changshu!”

The green-robed elder said with a smile.

“Two tree demons!”

A bright light flashed in the white-bearded Elder’s eyes.

The eyes of the three middle-aged elders on the side also lit up. Their faces revealed an expression of being moved.

“The soon-to-wither tree will be exchanged for a tree demon. Elder Mu, how about this transaction?”

The green-robed elder looked at their reactions and said indifferently.

“Sure!”

The white-bearded elder said without hesitation.

Trading a soon-to-be-withered Changshu for a tree demon was a very worthwhile deal. It was even very profitable!

“Elder Mu, the Tree Demon is born with wisdom. It may need some more things. Elder Mu, please give it to us!”

The green-robed elder narrowed his eyes and said with a smile.

“What things? As long as we have them, we’ll try our best to satisfy elder Hua!”

The white-bearded elder said with a chuckle.

“Wood spirit fruit, we need some wood spirit fruits!”

The corner of the green-robed elder’s mouth curled up slightly as he spoke to him.

The white-bearded elder was slightly stunned. He frowned and looked at Wang Xian who was beside him.

“This wood spirit fruit is very important to us. Elder Mu, please gift it to us!”

The green-robed elder said with a smile once again. He looked at Wang Xian indifferently with a smile on his face.

When Wang Xian heard the green-robed elder’s words, his expression turned slightly awkward. A hint of coldness flashed in his eyes.

“This Dragon King, I’m really sorry. Elder Hua and the rest want the wood spirit fruit. We can only give it to him. Please forgive us!”

The white-bearded elder naturally knew how to make a choice.

The tree demon was a terrifying creature. Once it was bred with intelligence, it would possess a combat strength comparable to that of a god.

A god was extremely important to the natural gate of immortality.

It was worth it to exchange for a withering tree.
