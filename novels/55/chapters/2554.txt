2555 2555 had to give an explanation! Go

The 20 over undyings that suddenly appeared were brutal and wanted to kill!

The law light pillar that suddenly descended from the sky immediately locked them up!

The events in the stadium shocked over 100 million people!

Of course, in the end, what shocked them the most was the defense of the Dragon Star, the 20 over undyings were locked up, the Tiger Chaos Demon Country Undying Level 7 imperial tutor flew over to capture them!

This shocked many of the undyings present!

Over 20 undyings couldn’t even escape after being trapped, they were captured!

What power was this?

That law light pillar was able to make even undyings unable to escape!

The scene just now didn’t just shock everyone in the concert!

Those watching the AI live broadcast were all shocked too!

“Peng!”

“Damn it, what is this thing, it can actually trap an undying God Emperor, it failed, it actually failed!”

Above Xing Hua Planet, the three powers gathered in their battleships, seeing the scene on the AI, they instantly stood up, their expressions extremely ugly!

They stared at the disappearing beam of light, their faces dark!

“The Tiger Chaos Demon Country and Dragon Palace were prepared!”

The CEO of the Jian Hua Group clenched his fists and said solemnly!

“Our attack this time not only didn’t cause dragon star to be heavily injured, it actually made them famous. Over 20 undying emperors attacking and being imprisoned at the same time, this is the best publicity for them!”

The Black Forest chairman frowned, his expression ugly!

“The other group sent out are even stronger, they all have an undying level 5, and they are still trapped!”

An old man said with some fear!

They had failed, this time’s failure would actually make long Xing famous!

Long Xing had already proven that it had the right to become a commercial planet!

“With the Tiger Chaos Demon Country here, we can’t come out in the open, we’ll be in trouble!”

Everyone from the three major factions sat there with sullen faces, thinking of a solution!

...

“What? How is this possible! ?”

“Oh no, elder Li and the rest have been captured!”

“What is this thing? How can it imprison more than a dozen of our experts? The chaotic Tiger Demon Country definitely doesn’t have the strength!”

On a planet within the ninth grade heaven sect’s domain, the people from the demon slaying sect stood up, their eyes wide as they exclaimed in shock!

They had been enemies with the tiger chaotic demon country for tens of millions of years. Even if A Level 7 undying godly monarch appeared in the tiger chaotic demon country, the tiger chaotic demon country did not have the ability to do so!

Beams of light trapped more than twenty undying godly monarchs. If the tiger chaotic demon country was that strong, their demon slaying sect would have been defeated long ago!

“It’s that Dragon Palace. Such a terrifying sealing technique must be the Dragon Palace’s technique!”

“Everyone, we’ve investigated some information about the dragon palace during this period of time. This technique definitely came from the Dragon Palace. The terrifying array formation that the Tiger Demon Nation created last time also came from the Dragon Palace!”

An old man said with a trembling body!

The five terrifying array formations last time had caused countless casualties in the demon Slayer sect!

If not for the existence of the array formation, their fey slaying sect would not have been defeated so quickly and tragically!

They had even nearly been annihilated!

“Damn the Dragon Palace. We have no enmity with them. Why are they targeting us! ?”

A female godly monarch roared with a ferocious expression!

“Ka Ka Ka!”

“This time, we failed. Elder Li and Company were also captured. In the future...”

The sect master of the Demon Slayer sect clenched his fist and let out a crisp sound. A terrifying killing intent spread out in all directions!

This time, not only did he suffer heavy losses, he even helped the other party!

“Sect master, the future is long. We have the protection of the ninth-grade sky sect. We have plenty of time to play with them!”

“The Dragon Palace has caused us such heavy losses. Let’s add the Dragon Palace next!”

An elder roared with a sinister expression!

The Demon Slayer sect had been destroyed and countless disciples had died. They had to take revenge!

They wanted to make the Tiger Riot Demon Kingdom pay a heavy price. This time, they would add the dragon palace as well!

“Hahaha, good, good. As long as we are here, the Tiger Riot Demon Kingdom and the Dragon Palace will never have peace!”

The sect master of the Demon Slayer sect roared ferociously!

What happened at the concert infuriated the major powers!

On the other commercial planets, when the major powers received the news from the dragon star, they frowned slightly and were filled with astonishment!

No one expected that the dragon palace and the chaotic tiger demon kingdom would have such capabilities!

...

“Dragon King, they have been captured!”

In the Dragon Star, a group of experts from the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation flew over and spoke to Wang Xian! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“We know a few of them. They are from the demon Slayer sect. HMPH, they are trying to come in and cause trouble by disguising themselves!”

The leader of the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation spoke with a cold expression!

“Who are you people?”

Wang Xian looked at the other group of people with a cold smile!

“Hehehe, I didn’t expect that we would die here. If you want to kill us, kill us!”

An old man laughed miserably and said with determination!

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian looked at the old man with a mocking expression on his face!

“Soul Catcher!”

...

He moved his palm and landed directly on the head of the old man!

“Ahhhh!”

In an instant, an extremely tragic scream was heard from the old man’s mouth. His eyes gradually turned dull!

“This is?”

The pupils of the other twenty or so people who were captured by the old man shrunk slightly when they saw this scene. A hint of panic could be seen on their faces!

“The skull party from the Black Cloud Planet? What kind of force is this?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and looked at the people from the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation in surprise!

“HMM? Black Cloud Planet? It’s a dark planet where many wanted people and forces gather. I’ve heard of the skull party before. It’s a rather big force on the Black Cloud Planet!”

“They must have been hired by other forces. We have no enmity with them. It’s impossible for them to offend us!”

The old National Advisor said!

“That’s right. They were hired. They don’t know who hired them, but they can guess that it should be Xing Hua Planet!”

“Announce immediately that the people who attacked us this time were the people from the demon Slayer sect and Xing Hua Planet!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and said to the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation and Prime Minister Gui!

“Huh?”

They were slightly stunned as they looked at Wang Xian!

“Xing Hua Planet is not far from us. If they hire the forces of the Black Cloud Planet to attack us, they don’t need to exist anymore!”

“Ask the ninth-grade heaven sect for an explanation from the demon Slayer sect. If they protect our enemies, they are making an enemy out of us!”

The corner of Wang Xian’s lips curled up slightly as he continued speaking to them!

The people from the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation were slightly shocked!

“Dragon King, are you going to directly question the ninth-grade heaven sect?”

The eyes of the old king flickered as he asked in a low voice!

“With us joining hands, why should we be afraid of the ninth-grade heaven sect? If the ninth-grade heaven sect continues to protect us, they will have to pay a price!”

Wang Xian smiled sinisterly!
