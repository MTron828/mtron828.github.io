3453 3452 revenge plan

“Greetings Dragon King!”

“Dragon King will definitely be able to soar into the nine heavens in the future and rebuild the glory of the Divine Dragon Clan, standing at the peak of the Universe!”

Water Touch King surrendered. As an old fellow who had lived for God knows how many years, she understood the situation in front of her.

At the same time, she also understood what a divine tree at the Heavenly Yuan creation level represented.

It was rumored that in the universe, each attribute could only give birth to one heavenly fate.

In other words, the attributes of the heavenly fate in the universe would not be the same.

As long as there was a water attribute heavenly fate treasure, the universe would not have a second water attribute heavenly fate.

Although it was just a rumor, the possibility was very high.

That was because there were less than three known heaven origin fortunes in the universe.

The king of water tentacles had lived for so long, but she had never seen a treasure of the heaven origin fortunes level.

Now, she actually saw it here.

In addition to the fact that she was severely injured, it would take a long time for her to recover.

Submitting to the Dragon King might be of great benefit to her.

Of course, there was also a part of the reason. If she didn’t submit, she might be killed.

Wang Xian looked at the king of water tentacles and was slightly speechless.

The void Behemoth was at least a ruler of the universe, yet it could lick it so well.

It was comparable to the face of the eight-limbed demonic fiend!

“There’s vitality liquid over there. You should recover first!”

Wang Xian said to her.

“Vitality Liquid? The vitality liquid of the elf race?”

The king of water tentacles was slightly stunned. Then, he flew over with a smile. “Ancient Pond, Moon Bay. Wow, Dragon King, you’re really amazing. You even have such a treasure. However, you already have a companion elf, Dragon King. There’s no need for me to make such a fuss.”

The king of water tentacles moved and entered the Moon Bay of the ancient lake.

He had absorbed all the life force liquid that he had accumulated over the past few years.

“Roar, Roar, he is about to recover his combat strength to the first level of a universe Dominator!”

She let out a low roar and revealed an excited expression.

Wang Xian glanced at her and his eyes flickered slightly.

This king of water tentacles would be able to become a capable assistant for a long period of time.

Her bloodline and physique were not inferior to the peak races.

“When I recover to my peak, I will make the angel race pay ten times or a hundred times the price!”

King of water tentacles’Roar continued.

“Angel Race!”

Wang Xian nodded. His eyes were filled with killing intent.

However, he was tired of living to seek revenge on the angel race.

With his current strength, any ten-winged angel from the angel race would be able to destroy the Dragon Palace.

Needless to say, he would have to face those archangels.

The current Dragon Palace wasn’t even a match for the subordinate races of the Angel clan.

“Don’t even think about taking revenge on the Angel clan for the time being. However, I will teach myself a lesson this time. I have to improve my strength as soon as possible.”

Wang Xian mumbled as his eyes were filled with awe.

The fastest way for the Dragon Palace to improve their strength was through war.

By killing the enemy, they would be able to obtain resources.

The Dragon Palace would be fully involved in the war between the Holy Dragon and the ancestral dragon.

Wang Xian closed his eyes slightly. Currently, the Holy Dragon, a subsidiary race of the Angel Race, was not something the Dragon Palace could contend against.

However, he could start from the Hundred Cities Alliance!

He had already learned that four cities were involved in the war. Furthermore, the eight-limbed demonic fiend and the rest had already penetrated into the interior of the four cities.

After these few years, other than the fact that he had yet to grasp the movements of the universe masters, everything else was already under the control of the Dragon Palace.

“The Holy Dragon lineage is the lackey of the angel race, and some of the cities in the Hundred Cities Alliance are the lackeys of the holy dragon lineage. Let’s make an example out of you. One day, I will kill my way into your Angel Race.”

Wang Xian mumbled to himself. He took out the universal AI and immediately contacted the eight-limbed demon fiend.

“Dragon King, we have all the information regarding the four major cities of Heavenly Peace City, Great Marquis City, Light Guardian Dragon City, and Jil City, including their secret army. However, we don’t know where the city lords and the masters of the few cities are right now!”

Soon, the eight-limbed demonic fiend sent over information one after another.

In a few years, they had ventured deep into the four major cities. The eight-limbed demonic fiend and the other two had even taken over the bodies of the commanders of the two important armies in the two major cities.

Basically, they had obtained all the information in the cities.

“Prime Minister Gui, gather the thorned dragon species and have them all come back.”

Wang Xian immediately gave an order.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

In the Dragon Palace, Prime Minister Gui, who was handling some matters, immediately replied respectfully.

One by one, information was sent out. The thorned dragon species, who had already entered the heaven-opening primordial land for training, immediately returned to the Dragon Palace after receiving the news.

Ao Yao also returned immediately after receiving the message.

“Greetings, Dragon King.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ao Yao came to the Dragon King’s palace and greeted respectfully.

The current AO Yao had the combat strength of the pinnacle of the universe.

Other than him, there were 200,000 other dragon species.

The weakest of these 200,000 had the combat strength of a universe knight.

Among them, other than Ao Yao who was at the Pinnacle, there were two level 9 and 10 level 8.

High level combat strength wasn’t much.

After all, the thorned dragon was only one of the dragon species in the Dragon Palace.

In less than half an hour, all 200,000 thorned dragon species had gathered.

The Strange Light and darkness perfectly fused together, and their bodies were filled with a cold and gloomy aura.

“Eh? What kind of dragon species is this? What a strange aura. It feels even more strange than the strange assassins among the Dark clan and the demon race!”

“Oh, right, it should be a thorned dragon, but why are there so many of them? There are only over 1,000 thorned dragon species in the pinnacle stage of the godly dragon race, and this… There are actually 200,000 of them.”

Beside them, the well-informed water touch great demon murmured, his eyes filled with shock.

During the Battle of the destruction of the godly dragon race, she was already a space beast at the universe master level.

She knew a lot about universe pinnacle races.

There were some powerful and terrifying beings that surrounded the pinnacle races.

She knew about the thorned dragon race. The Godly Dragon race was a strange and terrifying killer that wandered between light and darkness.

But how could there be so many terrifying dragon races in this small Dragon Palace?

It was simply subversive to his understanding.

This was a pinnacle dragon race, comparable to a pinnacle race.

If he remembered correctly, the divine dragon lineage only had a million peak bloodlines, and most of them were pure-blooded divine dragons.

“This boss of mine isn’t simple.”

Water Touch King muttered. She suddenly felt that her only advantage now was that she could directly recover to the universe ruler realm.

“If the Dragon King becomes successful, the Divine Dragon will definitely roar again.”

She thought to herself.

The more he understood this dragon palace, the more shocked he was.

“All thorned dragon species, get ready. Next, you will carry out an assassination.”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across all thorned dragon species as he spoke with a hint of killing intent.
