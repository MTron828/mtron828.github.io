Chapter 1165: 1166 sacred killing token

Translator: 5496903

“Rumble!”

The torrential rain poured down as city Lord Liu and the Bright Moon Army general floated in front of the city wall.

Around them, the city guards widened their eyes in shock as they watched this scene.

Below them, the tens of thousands of people who had rushed over after hearing the news were filled with fear!

It was really the prince!

It was really the third prince!

The dragon Spike actually dared to assassinate the prince!

This caused the people who still had a trace of uncertainty in their hearts to stare blankly.

“The Dragon Spike Assassin Organization, you all deserve to die ten thousand deaths!”

City Lord Liu looked at the third Prince’s corpse in a daze. Looking at the words on the red paper beside him, his eyes turned red.

No matter what, he would have thought that the dragon spike would actually dare to be so arrogant and crazy!

Assassinating a prince of a country, this sort of thing was too crazy!

He hadn’t thought of it at all!

Picking up the third Prince’s corpse, City Lord Liu’s ghastly voice resounded throughout Bright Moon City.

Assassinating a prince of a country was no longer a slap to the face of the city Lord’s estate, but an enemy of star-moon kingdom.

“From today onwards, Bright Moon City will implement a curfew. After tonight, no one is allowed to leave the city, no one is allowed to come out!”

The Bright Moon Army general’s expression was extremely ugly. The third Prince had died in their bright moon city. As the two people in charge of Bright Moon City, they had to bear some responsibility.

At the very least, they had to destroy this dragon spike to make up for their mistake.

“Go!”

City Lord Liu’s face was gloomy as he carried the third Prince’s corpse. The red paper beside him was immediately taken back. His body moved and he flew towards the city Lord’s mansion.

The Bright Moon Army general nodded solemnly and followed closely behind.

They wanted to report this matter to the king.

“Whoosh!”

“My God, the dragon Spike isn’t just going to make an enemy out of undercurrent, it’s going to make an enemy out of the entire star-moon kingdom!”

“What benefits does the dragon spike have in doing this? Don’t tell me they want to go head-to-head with the royal family of our country?”

“The red piece of paper from the dragon Spike says that undercurrent and the city Lord’s mansion are working together to deal with them. That’s why they’re making such a crazy move!”

“Undercurrent and the city Lord’s Mansion are working together? Is... is this possible?”

“Since the dragon Spike has said it, then it’s very possible!”

After City Lord Liu and the Bright Moon Army general left, the east gate instantly erupted into an uproar.

Everyone stood in the heavy rain and sighed slightly. Some of them had contemplative expressions on their faces.

What dragon Spike said about the undercurrent joining forces with the city lord’s residence might be true.

Otherwise, dragon spike wouldn’t have done such an extreme action.

Assassinating the third prince, he would have to bear the revenge of the entire star-moon kingdom!

“No matter what, Dragon Spike is really too crazy!”

An old man slowly sighed.

The Master of Undercurrent was crazy?

But the dragon spike was crazy?

“After today, no matter what happens to the dragon spike, it will definitely leave a mark in the history of star-moon Kingdom.”

As some people spoke, they began to return.

It was too shocking.

The news of the dragon spike assassinating the third prince spread throughout the entire bright moon city in less than ten minutes.

Everyone’s heart skipped a beat as they waited for the city Lord’s mansion and star-moon kingdom’s reaction.

This matter had blown up so much that it was going to alarm the royal family of star-moon kingdom.

Even the king had to come personally. After all, the third prince was the king’s son.

The atmosphere in the entire bright moon city had undergone a huge change.

On the streets, the city guards weren’t the only ones patrolling. There were also soldiers from the Bright Moon Army.

The entire bright moon city was filled with a murderous aura.

Wang Xian watched this scene with a smile on his face. He followed the flow of people and walked towards the restaurant.

“The most dangerous time is also the safest time. The people from Ao Yao’s sect have completed all the tasks they received yesterday!”

Wang Xian returned to the restaurant and said to Ao Yao with a smile on his face.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao nodded and disappeared immediately.

...

Star-moon King City, in the huge palace.

“Your Majesty, you must avenge San Er. That assassin organization actually dared to kill San Er. You must avenge San Er. San Er is so miserable!”

In the star-moon king palace, a graceful and elegant woman was kneeling in front of a middle-aged man. Her eyes were red and swollen as she cried.

The middle-aged man was dressed in a dragon robe as he sat on the dragon throne. At this moment, the Star Moon King’s expression was extremely gloomy.

Even though he had over a hundred children under him, his third son was one of the more outstanding children.

Now, he was actually assassinated by an assassin organization. This was simply a great humiliation to the star Moon Kingdom.

To a king like him, this was a blatant slap in the face.

“My beloved concubine, don’t worry. I will repay third son’s life to him. That assassin organization, I will make sure that not even a chicken or dog is left alive!”

Star-moon king’s eyes revealed a cold glint, and a faint chill gushed out from his surroundings.

“Xuan Xing Guang Hun, Gu Dongfeng, Ling Tiankai, and Shao Wei, the four beloved ministers, present themselves!”

As he spoke, he held a writing brush and danced in the imperial edict.

One by one, sharp words with a strong killing intent condensed on the imperial edict.

The Last Word, killing intent soared to the sky.

Ordinary people holding the imperial edict were even directly killed by the killing intent on the imperial edict.

“It’s the King!”

The eunuch at the side hurriedly responded and quickly walked out.

In less than ten minutes, four terrifying figures quickly rushed toward the palace.

Four Generals, four insightful emptiness realm experts.

There were only seven insightful emptiness realm experts in the imperial city, and four of them had already been dispatched.

“Receive the sacred killing order. Four ministers, immediately head to Bright Moon City and destroy the Dragon Assassin Organization to avenge my third son!”

“Anyone related to the dragon assassin organization, Kill. I want this assassin organization to leave no one alive!”

In the star-moon King Palace, the star-moon king waved his arm.

An imperial decree filled with killing intent fell into the hands of an old man.

The sacred killing order was issued!

The strongest killing order in the star-moon kingdom!

Once such a killing order was issued, all nine clans would be exterminated. Not even a chicken or dog would be spared!

Since the establishment of the star-moon kingdom, the sacred killing order had only been issued a few times.

This was because in the star-moon kingdom, unless it was treason, the king would not issue such a sacred killing order.

However, today, the third prince had been killed. This action was even more serious than treason.

This was a provocation to the star-moon royal family and a contempt for the royal authority.

The four insightful void realm experts led the sacred killing order and quickly flew toward Bright Moon City.

At the same time, in Bright Moon City, City Lord Liu and the general of the Bright Moon Army were slightly shocked when they received the news from the palace.

“Seal Bright Moon City. No one is allowed to leave the city!”

“Anyone who dares to leave the city will be attacked. Anyone who disobeys will be killed!”

City Lord Liu shouted softly and gave another order. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Bright Moon Army, stand by. Activate the formation of Bright Moon City!”

“Activate level one battle preparations. During this period, anyone who makes a mistake will be punished tenfold!”

The Bright Moon Army general also loudly ordered his subordinates beside him.

Four insightful emptiness realm experts arrived with the holy killing order. The dragon spike must be destroyed!
