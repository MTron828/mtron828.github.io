Chapter 1459: 1459 had another breakthrough

Feng Luan shook her head when she saw Wang Xian leaving.

Rest? You are resting every day!

She was a little envious of Wang Xian, Guan Shuqing, and the other girls. They didn’t have to do anything all day long. They could cultivate, eat, drink, play, and be free!

Unlike her, she was extremely busy all day long.

Wang Xian didn’t know what Feng Luan was thinking. He walked out with an excited look on his face. There was a huge amount of resources in the interspatial ring in his hand.

The main hall was completely under his control. There were some corpses of ferocious beasts and extremely precious medicinal pills in the main hall.

All these resources added together with the resources that the Dragon Palace had obtained recently were enough for him to improve his strength.

“Xiao Xian!”

Just as he walked out of the main hall, a voice suddenly sounded.

Wang Xian was slightly stunned. He looked over and saw Ling Jian ‘er, who was dressed in white, looking at him with a face full of joy as she walked towards him.

In her eyes, she couldn’t hide her admiration.

“Eh, Ling Jian ‘Er!”

Wang Xian looked at her as she walked over with an awkward expression on his face.

After the main hall was completely under control, the base of the Liuhuang Alliance was also placed in the main hall.

Recently, Ling Jian ‘ER had been coming to look for him frequently. Everyone could see the admiration in her eyes.

As the saying goes, a woman chasing a man is separated by a layer of gauze. Every day, she would be chased by an extremely beautiful girl. It was a lie for Wang Xian to say that he was not tempted.

“Here, this is the dessert that I just learned how to make yesterday. Try it and see if it tastes good!”

Ling Jian ‘ER took out an exquisite box with a happy expression and handed it to him.

“Alright, Ling Jian ‘er, you don’t have to give me these!”

Wang Xian looked at the things that were handed over and smiled awkwardly.

Ling Jian ‘er treated him very well. He could tell that she treated him very well.

“Xiao Xian, why didn’t you tell us when you were going back? HMPH!”

At this moment, the voices of Guan Shuqing and the other girls could be heard from behind.

Upon hearing their voices, Ling Jian ‘er retreated a little cautiously and kept a distance away from Wang Xian.

“Ahem, I didn’t know that you guys were also in the main hall!”

Wang Xian looked at the few girls and said with a smile.

“Humph, you’re fooling around again!”

Guan Shuqing rolled her eyes at him and pouted. The other few girls also had hostile looks.

Wang Xian was speechless and didn’t say anything.

In the past half a year, he finally managed to get a group of girls to accept Zhang Fengying and live the life of Wei Xiaobao (seven wives)

However, because of this, a few of the girls stared at him sternly and didn’t want to flirt with him anymore.

This caused a group of girls to pay close attention to him.

“Are you guys going back to the Dragon Palace? Shall we go back together?”

Wang Xian quickly changed the topic and said to them.

“Let’s go back. Let’s go back together then!”

A few of the girls nodded their heads.

“Ling Jian ‘er, I still have some matters to attend to, so I’ll go back first. Thank you for the delicious food!”

Wang Xian waved his hand as he spoke to Ling Jian ‘ER.

Ling Jian ‘er pursed her lips and nodded with a smile on her face. She stared blankly at Wang Xian and the rest as they turned around and left.

However, very soon, she clenched her fist and stabbed it into her palm, causing a trickle of blood to flow out.

“Xiao Xian, are you still lacking a maid?”

Wang Xian, who was walking in front, suddenly heard Ling Jian ‘er’s voice from behind. His body stiffened.

Is there still a need for a maid?

Wang Xian remembered that when he was in the cemetery of demi-humans and Ling Jian ‘er confessed to him for the first time, he said, “If you want to follow me, that’s fine too. Be a maid, serve tea, pour water, wash clothes, cook, and wash your feet!”!

Now...

“This... This is not lacking, not lacking!”

Wang Xian felt a few cold gazes from beside him. He quickly shook his head, turned around, and left.

Ling Jian ‘er, who was standing at the back, had even more strength in her hands. Drops of blood fell to the ground.

She looked at Wang Xian’s figure with an extremely dejected gaze.

“If I can’t be with you, what’s the meaning of this? Heartless Sword Path... Forget About Love... Forget About Love...” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

She mumbled as a hint of deathly gray slowly appeared in her eyes.

In this deathly gray color, an extremely cold golden small sword was flashing.

Back then, not only did she obtain a golden origin, but she also obtained a sword dao inheritance that she thought was a forbidden technique.

Back then, when she saw this sword dao inheritance, she threw it into her interspatial ring. This was because no one knew how to cultivate, and no one would believe that there was such a way to cultivate sword dao.

The True Heartless Sword Dao, killing Sword Dao.

“I have to say, Ling Jian ‘ER’s desserts are really delicious. If she didn’t like Xiaoxian, we would have been friends with her!”

“It’s pretty good. It’s much better than my desserts. Xiao Xian, try it. Ling Jian ‘ER gave it to you!”

Wang Xian and the group of girls flew toward the Dragon Palace.

The few girls took the desserts skillfully. It was obviously not the first time.

The few girls had a good impression of Ling Jian ‘er. However, she was a love rival.

Naturally, they didn’t want to share Wang Xian with others. There were already enough people.

“Hehe, let me try it too!”

Wang Xian smiled and ate some. It wasn’t the first time he had tasted it. The taste was still as delicious as before.

The current Dragon Palace had been relocated to the sea area not far from the main hall.

That place used to be the lair of the blood barbarian demonic beasts. Now, the Dragon Palace had been relocated there.

When they entered the Dragon Palace, they could clearly see that there was a lot of vitality in the entire dragon palace.

Compared to before, the Dragon Palace now had a tremendous change.

First of all, the Dragon Palace no longer had more than 6,000 members, but had more than 16,000 members, an increase of 10,000 members.

The Demon Lin Demon Beast Clan had all joined the Dragon Palace, along with the sickle-tailed snake clan, the Ghost Monkey Clan, and a few other demon beast clans

The Demon Lin Demon Beast clan had over six thousand demon beasts, and the remaining four thousand.

These were all demon beasts that had passed the Dragon Gate. The remaining demon beasts, including the Bloodthirsty Sea Demon Beast Clan, hadn’t passed the Dragon Palace.

The demon Lin Demon Beast clan belonged to the Mount of the Dragon Palace.

A mount didn’t mean that their status in the Dragon Palace was low. On the contrary, their status was very high.

If they wanted to make a demon beast their mount, the other members of the Dragon Palace had to show their strength.

Without strength, the demon qilin wouldn’t let anyone ride it.

The sickle-tailed snake clan had joined the special department of the Dragon Palace, the poison making department.

The ghost monkey passed through the Dragon Pond and turned into the demon monkey of the Demon War Department.

As for the rest, they were filled with the dragon spur department, the Dragon Guard Department, the Thunder Department, and the Golden Swordfish clan!

These demonic beasts were not weak. After killing the blood flow empire and killing the surrounding beasts, the weakest members of the Dragon Palace were at least at transcendent-level 9!

Among them, there were 3,000 at the profound void realm.

It was not an exaggeration to say that the Dragon Palace’s power could sweep through all the forces in the Liuhai region, including the dragon-phoenix Empire and the Liuhuang Alliance!
