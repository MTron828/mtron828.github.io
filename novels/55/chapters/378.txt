Chapter 379: Bloodbath (5)

“Be off and die!” the young master of the Nine Lotus Sect snarled as he leaped over to attack Wang Xian in a single shift of stance.

His face darkened while the blue gloves he wore shone in sapphire rays with a lotus motif embroidered in the middle.

A lotus mirage had formed above the palm with the glove, as it emitted bouts of ominous energy.

“Ranked the fifth on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart. An Inborn expert with a bright future. Why then, are you courting doom!” Wang Xian called out as the young master of the Nine Lotus Sect lunged at him. To which, he raised his Zhan Lu Sword and slew over with ease.

“Humph, a renowned Miracle Doctor at such a young age. Why, then, are you courting doom!?” the young master shot back with an icy gaze. As he did, a sound resembling that of tidal waves crashing blasted from his body. Suddenly, the lotus in his palm ballooned.

“How dare you kill our disciples of the Nine Lotus Sect! For that, you all shall remain here!” the young master snarled.

Whoosh!

The long sword in Wang Xian’s hand went straight for the young master’s palm.

As the Zhan Lu Sword slew right above the Lotus mirage, it emitted sound which mimicked flowing water, while the aura of the young master only seemed to gain strength.

Yet, the Zhan Lu Sword sliced through the water Lotus in his hand, and continued to slay toward the blue glove.

“Such a sharp long sword!” the young master shrieked in surprise as his face flinched, although he continued his attacks using his palm.

This Lotus Glove of his was a Level 9 weapon, which feared no sabre or sword.

Blob!

However, at the very instant his palm came into contact with the long sword, the young master gasped in fear while his face contorted.

Bam!

“Ah!” a blood-curdling scream rang in the air.

This made everyone in the crowd look on with wide eyes as they stared at the young master’s palm, utterly disturbed.

The palm had been split completely, as the cut extended all the way towards the arm. It almost caused the entire arm to be mutilated into two halves, and looked utterly appalling.

“One move, one move and the Nine Lotus’ young master has been seriously injured!” one cried out.

“What sword is that? How could it be this sharp? The blue glove worn on the young master’s hand is no mediocre weapon,” another yelped.

“To think a factionless doctor’s able to take the Nine Lotus’ young master down with a single strike. How’s... How’s this possible!” the third squawked.

“To think you’ve maimed my arm. To think you’ve cut my arm up...,” the young master cried with piercing screams. Eyes wide, he looked at his right arm which had been split apart, and roared as he trembled.

“Behaving like you’re all high and almighty. Your fate was sealed the moment you injured my little sister!” Wang Xian rebuked. As he did, the movements of his arm showed no signs of stopping as the Zhan Lu sword he held slew once again, this time aiming straight for the limbs of the young master.

“You dare to...,” the young master snarled in fright. In reflex, his body shuffled backwards for retreat while his desire to escape accelerated his speed.

In the end, like the many disciples of the Nine Lotus Sect earlier, one strike of the sword was all it took.

The esteemed young master of the Nine Lotus Sect stood rooted with eyes wide, as they filled with despair.

Bam, bam, bam!

While the arms detached themselves, the legs gave way and broke; and the entire body just slumped onto the floor.

“To think you... To think you dare, dare to...,” the young master muttered. He was still in disbelief at such an outcome.

Just a minute ago, he was still the esteemed young master of the Nine Lotus Sect, one who had been placed on a pedestal.

But now, his body had been dismembered.

How does he possess such formidable prowess?

“Stop! The experts from our Sect will be coming out from the ancient tomb shortly. If you dare kill our young master, all of you will die!” several disciples from the Nine Lotus Sect warned as they circled the entrance of the ancient tomb. They shouted in fear upon seeing their dismembered young master.

Wang Xian did not heed their warnings, but instead glanced over at the young master who was now trembling violently.

The once dashing young master was now staring with hopelessness, having lost all the confidence and prestige of the strong from before.

Fresh blood gushed out of his body.

Wang Xian then raised his long sword, and turned to look at Fang Huazi who was sitting at a side. The latter was now overwhelmed with fear and shock.

“How dare you... maim the young master of the Nine Lotus Sect!?” Fang Huazi snapped as he supported his arms on the table beside him while glaring intensely at Wang Xian.

“I’ll let him live a while longer, so he can watch the wipeout of the Nine Lotus Sect!” Wang Xian replied indifferently as he looked back at Fang Huazi. “Previously, I made a mistake by not killing you. But this time, I won’t give you another chance!” he added.

“You... You dare to kill me? I’m from the Sacred Followers Guild, you dare to kill me?” Fang Huazi grimaced while he glowered at Wang Xian. “If you dare kill me, the Sacred Followers Guild won’t let this slide. No matter how powerful you are, if you dare to kill me, the Sacred Followers Guild will hunt you down and kill you!” he continued.

“So be it. I’m guessing that your master is here as well. So, I’ll let you watch your master die before I slaughter you!” Wang Xian dismissed the warnings. He then wielded his sword and struck in Fang Huazi’s direction.

“Don’t you dare!” Fang Huazi shrieked while his face contorted. His abilities were nowhere near the Inborn-level. Moreover, given his now handicapped body, his combat powers were merely that of a Level 3 to 4 Martial Artist.

With him having absolutely no means of resistance, Wang Xian went straight in and chopped off Fang Huazi’s legs!

“You... The Sacred Followers Guild won’t let you off. How dare you hurt me, the Sacred Followers Guild won’t ever let you off!” Fang Huazi let out an ear-piercing scream.

“If the Sacred Followers Guild doesn’t give me an explanation on this matter, I’ll wipe the Sacred Followers Guild out!” Wang Xian hollered with murderous intent.

“Tsk, how savage!” a voice from the crowd yelped.

“To think he said he’ll wipe the Sacred Followers Guild out. He’s simply too impudent!” another gasped.

As the crowd heard Wang Xian’s words, their hearts stirred. Annihilating the Sacred Followers Guild? Even Sacred Sects would not dare to make such frivolous comments.

To think a factionless doctor would have the guts to face the Sacred Grounds of a Medical Sect...

The hearts of Nine Lotus Sect Disciples quivered. To think the young lad standing in front of them was savage enough to talk about annihilating the Sacred Followers Guild.

Little wonder he had maimed their young master, given such unrivalled impudence.

“When the Ancestral Sect experts are out, this insolent lad will end up in a plight worse than death!” one of them scowled.

The disciples stared apathetically at the insolent lad, as they kept vigil over him.

Just then, the disciples heard an utterance coming from the insolent lad. “Kill all of them, every one of the Nine Lotus Sect disciples!” he ordered.

“What?” the crowd around screeched, utterly taken aback. There were slightly over thirty remaining disciples of the Nine Lotus Sect around. But they had not made their moves earlier, as most of their combat abilities were below Level 8.

To think that this Miracle Doctor Wang was about to begin his massacre right now!

Boom, boom!

Two bouts of daunting forces surged right at them just as they ended their words.

Immediately, the crowd snapped their heads back in horror, and looked in the direction of Mo Qinglong and Mo Yuan.

The two Inborns projected a stance that far exceeded one of an ordinary Inborn expert. Whiffs of devilish aura circled about their bodies along with their ferocity. This mortified the martial artists, and they held their breath for a split moment with apprehension in their eyes.

Mo Qinglong began to make his move. But he did not attack the disciples of Nine Lotus Sect. Instead, he arrived alongside a young man who stood further away.

Just earlier, this young man had called Wang Xian a dork, sneering with much sarcasm. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He thus deserved death!

Meanwhile, the young man nearly peed in his pants as he looked at the aggressive and sadistic Mo Qinglong.

“No, don’t kill me...,” the young man pleaded in fear, as he retreated backwards.

“Die!” Mo Qinglong hollered as he lashed his Dragon Claws, and struck directly at the young man.

“Stop right there, how dare you hurt our Mortal Sect disciples!” a voice ordered.

Everyone who had made it into the cave were from First-class forces, while this young man had belonged to the Mortal Sect. The other voice belonged to an Elder of the same sect, as he stood in the center of the rest.

The Elder possessed Inborn-level powers. He hollered when he saw Mo Qinglong blatantly slaughtering his sect disciple, striking a counter-attack with his palms at the former as he did.

Bam!

As the Elder’s palm met with Mo Qinglong’s claw, his face twitched before he receded.

“You dare block our path, then I’ll have to wipe all of you out first!” Mo Qinglong snarled as his body oozed with a murderous vibe.

Behind him, Mo Yuan lunged forth at the Mortal Sect Elder in a single leap, and began to attack.

“What? Annihilating them over a mere disagreement in exchange!” the crowd gasped.
