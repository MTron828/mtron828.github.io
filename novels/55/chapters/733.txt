“Hey, you people of the Origin Immortal sect, get lost!”

Ling Tian held his head high and shouted at the dozen or so people on the golden platform.

Although he looked like a coward in front of Xiao Yu, his strength and talent were incomparable in the entire yellow cauldron world.

The name of the EVILDOER crown prince was not given for nothing.

The younger generation of the entire yellow cauldron world was really doing whatever they wanted.

“Hehe, I was wondering who it was. So it’s the Yellow Heaven Immortal Sect’s crown prince!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

A middle-aged man looked at Feng Lingtian and said with a smile.

“Since you know it’s me, move aside immediately!”

The corner of Feng Lingtian’s mouth curled up slightly. He slowed down his footsteps and stood shoulder to shoulder with Xiao Yu. He raised his head slightly and said, “Let me tell you, my reputation as the evildoer crown prince is not for nothing. In the entire yellow cauldron region, who would not give me face?”

“Wow, you’re quite powerful!”

Xiao Yu curled his lips in disdain.

“That’s not true!”

Feng Lingtian raised his head and puffed out his chest as though he felt that this was the proper way to behave. He brought Xiao Yu towards the golden platform.

“Move aside, can’t you see that this young master is here?”

Feng Lingtian said arrogantly. With this attitude, he was definitely a silkpants.

“Hehe, since the crown prince is here, we will naturally give you some space so that you and the beauty can enjoy this beautiful scenery!”

An elder said indifferently.

“En!”

Feng Lingtian pretended to nod his head coldly in front of Xiao Yu.

“This is the best place to admire Mount Jin Ming and the Waterfall!”

The two of them walked over and the dozen of them took the initiative to open up a path!

Feng Lingtian pointed ahead and introduced the path to little feather.

“Whoosh! Whoosh!”

However, at this moment, the two elders beside them instantly moved.

A sharp longsword suddenly appeared and attacked Feng Lingtian and little feather’s vital points.

“Not good!”

The moment they attacked, little feather’s expression changed slightly and his body was instantly covered by black bone armor.

A shield appeared on his left and right, and a bone whip appeared on his right hand. He propped it up with both hands!

“PA PA!”

The sound of metal colliding could be heard.

Feng Lingtian, who was at the side, was shocked. He only reacted the moment Xiao Yu blocked the dagger.

“En, what a quick reaction!”

Two surprised voices could be heard, followed by a terrifying aura erupting from the surroundings.

A golden light surrounded the two of them!

“You dare to attack me? You’re courting death!”

Feng Lingtian felt the murderous aura around him, and his expression changed drastically. He looked at the long sword that was blocked by his side, and his forehead was full of cold sweat.

Just now, if it wasn’t for Xiao Yu helping him block, he would have been heavily injured or even killed!

“This is your so-called territory?”

Little Feather turned around and asked with a serious expression.

The two old men who attacked them were both half-step immortal gods. If she hadn’t cultivated in seclusion for a year, she wouldn’t have been able to block the attack.

“Hehe, our crown prince is really arrogant. Since this is your territory, I’ll let you be buried here forever!”

An elder revealed a mocking smile on his face.

They were not worried at all when their attack missed. Instead, they stared at them with a cold smile.

“If you dare to attack me, my father will definitely not spare your chaos origin immortal sect!”

Feng Lingtian’s expression turned cold as he stared at them warily.

“Your father? Haha, So What? Since our chaos origin immortal sect dares to attack, we are not afraid of your father’s revenge. Little Brat, you are definitely going to die today!”

An elder with a broken arm stared at Feng Lingtian mockingly. “Little Brat, do you still remember me? One of my arms was cut off by you. Today, I will chop you into pieces!”

“If you want to kill me, all of you are not qualified to do so!”

Feng Lingtian was a little angry.

Just a moment ago, he was telling Little Yu that everyone in the Yellow Cauldron region had to give him face. In the end, he was instantly slapped in the face.

If Xiao Yu hadn’t saved him, he would have been finished!

The feeling of being slapped in the face was burning hot and painful.

He wasn’t worried that he would be left here. With the shadow evasion technique, he could definitely escape.

“Aren’t you bragging now?”

Xiao Yu turned his head and looked at Ling Tian with some ridicule. He didn’t care too much about the dozen people in front of him.

Although the group of Drakonids did not follow him, there were still four strange demons around him.

With her own strength, even if she stayed behind to fight with them, she would still be able to destroy them!

“Let’s leave this place first. Wait for me to call someone over to let you see how this young master will teach them a lesson!”

Feng Lingtian’s face turned red as he gritted his teeth and said.

“Alright!”

Xiao Yu smiled and nodded.

“Keke, as expected of our crown prince. He’s still so confident at this moment. TSK TSK, with a beautiful lady accompanying him, it’s better for you not to leave today. Even if you want to leave, you won’t be able to!”

An old man with a white beard and the length of a palm laughed and said.

“Weng!”

Just as he finished speaking, a golden light suddenly flashed in the surroundings.

“Eh?”

Xiao Yu and Feng Lingtian were stunned and quickly looked around.

“Chaos Origin Formation!”

Feng Lingtian’s expression changed drastically and a trace of fear appeared in his eyes as he exclaimed.

“Since we have made a move, crown prince, do you think we will let you escape?”

The white-bearded elder laughed as he said. A dozen people slowly surrounded the two of them.

“What is Chaos Origin Formation?”

Xiao Yu saw Feng Lingtian’s expression change and asked him curiously.

“Origin Formation, a Grade 2 formation. It is the mountain protecting formation of the origin immortal sect. Once the formation is activated, even immortal level experts will find it hard to enter. Similarly, the people inside will not be able to leave.”

“The origin formation’s defense depends on the area it covers. If it only covers a radius of four to five kilometers, even a high-level immortal would not be able to break it!”

Feng Lingtian said with an ugly expression.

“The crown prince is really smart!”

The white-bearded elder beside him praised with a smile.

“Looks like you guys are really trying to kill me!”

Feng Lingtian’s expression was extremely ugly.

“Only the effect of Defense?”

Xiao Yu narrowed her eyes slightly and said to Feng Lingtian.

“Only defense!”

Feng Lingtian gritted his teeth. “Today, we are considered to have fallen here. It’s me who dragged you down!”

“Doomed my ass! Look at your cowardly face! I will protect you!”

Xiao Yu looked around with a relaxed expression.

There were a total of fifteen people, thirteen infant realm experts, and two half-step immortal realm experts.

They were ready to fight!

“Great aunt, if we can get out of here alive today, you can call me your slave in the future!”

Feng Lingtian looked around and his heart trembled slightly.

It was true that he was a demonic crown prince, but that was only when compared to the younger generation of the same level. The group of people in front of him were several times his age.

In particular, the spiritual weapon in the other party’s hand was not inferior to his at all. It was already very impressive for him to be able to fight against two infant realm experts alone.

He clearly did not believe that Xiao Yu was able to deal with two half-step immortal gods and eleven infant realm experts.

This time, the odds were against him!
