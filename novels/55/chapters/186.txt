The next morning at Flowing Water Villa.

Flowing Water Villa was a private club in Rivertown with a horse racing track, golf course and swimming pool.

This was a high-end private club. Also, a high-end banquet venue.

Lan Family, second to Qin Family in Rivertown, was indeed a billion-dollar group.

Even though the stock price of Lan Family had fallen sharply in the recent period, they still maintained their status.

No ordinary companies or groups could easily shake Lan Family’s status. Besides, they had their foundation. It would be difficult for them to fall.

Today was a rather important day for the entire Lan Family.

Lan Family would be joining hands with the Tyrannical Sword of the Liu Family from the Hailing Province. To put it bluntly, Lan Family was getting Tyrannical Sword Liu Family as their backing.

Tyrannical Sword of the Liu Family possessed formidable strength in Hailing Province. Their family assets had reached hundreds of billions.

But this was secondary. Liu Family was strong in its mighty strength.

In the entire Hailing Province, it was scarce to have someone who dared to offend the Tyrannical Sword of the Liu Family.

Hence, the political marriage of Lan Family’s future heir, Lan Qingyue, and Tyrannical Sword of the Liu Family, Little Sword Celestial, was a big deal for many people.

Early in the morning, many luxury cars were parked outside the Flowing Water Villa. All elites were well-dressed as they headed to the villa.

“Second Master Liu, hello.”

“Second Master Liu, hello!” A middle-aged man put on a smile as he stood at the entrance, greeting all the guests.

“Haha, thank you for traveling so far to attend Xiao Yun’s engagement ceremony!” Second Master Liu laughed as he greeted the guests politely.

“You’re welcome. It’s Young Master Liu’s engagement ceremony. We must be here for the celebration. It’s our honor to be here!”

“That’s right. Since Young Master Liu is of the Hailing Province, the friends from Hailing Province must join in the celebration!” the middle-aged men and elderly men quickly replied.

“Haha, thank you, everyone!” Second Master Liu cupped his fist and smiled.

Many people drove their luxurious cars with presents from Hailing Province. They were heading towards the Flowing Water Villa joyfully.

Those wealthy families, Martial Artist Families, and sects had to come and showed their support since it was a political marriage between Liu Family and Lan Family. Besides, it was the Little Sword Celestial who was getting engaged.

“That’s Magnate Guo. He’s in the top five tycoons in Hailing Province. I didn’t expect he would be here personally.”

“They are from the Hushan Sect of Hailing Province, a Second-class Sect.”

“That’s Wu Family of Hailing Province, another Second-class family.”

“Gosh, so many people actually came to support Liu Family. If this ceremony were to be held in Hailing Province, I believe there would be more people!”

“It was the right choice to have this political marriage. Liu Family’s strength in Hailing Province was too formidable!”

A few people from the Lan Family were in disbelief when they saw the stream of people who walked in.

Liu Family was simply too strong. Lan Family found themselves a strong backing with the political marriage despite making some sacrifices themselves too.

“Ah Xiu, have we sent out all our invitations?” a middle-aged man asked the woman next to him.

“Yes, we did. We sent them to all well-known people, including the Ancient Martial Artist Families in Rivertown. It’s just that I don’t think the Ancient Martial Artist Families would turn up since we have no contact with them!” The woman frowned.

Lan Family was considered to be widely known in Rivertown. They also invited many people since the future heir of the family was getting engaged.

Even though they could not compare their lineup with Liu Family, they should not lose out at the very least.

“I wonder if Qin Family will turn up!” The middle-aged man hesitated as he frowned and spoke while observing the guests from Liu Family.

“I think someone will come, it’s just that we’re not sure about that person’s status,” the woman pondered and said.

“Forget it. Let’s not think about these things. We’re still far from Liu Family. Once we finish this engagement, we will not be afraid of the Zhou and Lingyue Sect!” the middle-aged man said as cold radiance flashed in his eyes.

“The magnates from Rivertown are here. Let’s receive them!”

The middle-aged man and woman were the parents of Lan Qingyue. He looked at those magnates from Rivertown and went up to greet them with smiles.

“Director Lan, congratulations!” One by one, the Rivertown magnates greeted him with smiling faces. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, their smiles seemed to be odd and peculiar.

“‘Director Li, welcome. Thank you for attending my daughter’s engagement ceremony!” The middle-aged greeted him with smiles.

“Hehe, you’re welcome.” Director Li gave an awkward smile.

“Director Lan, congratulations!”

“Thank you, Director Lan, for inviting me!”

“I must thank all of you for attending the ceremony. Please come in.” Looking at the Rivertown magnates, Director Lan put on a smiling face and spoke fervently.

The group of Rivertown magnates chuckled and walked inside.

“Dragon King?”

Two magnates who knew each other went inside. One of them spoke softly to a middle-aged man.

The other middle-aged man nodded. “It was Dragon King’s order. Old Duan called me personally, and said he will show up too!”

“Hu Family Head asked me to come!”

“Old Qin informed me to come over!”

“All elites in the entire Rivertown came over under an order. I bet Lan Family has yet to know about this!”

“Who dares to tip them off?”

The group of magnates went inside.

“Old Qin is here personally!”

At this time, Lan Family’s people who were receiving the guests were thrilled when they saw Old Qin and other well-known magnates walking over.

“I think they are taking account of Liu Family. What a great influence for a first-class force. Old Qin actually turned up personally for our political marriage with the Liu Family!”

“Old Qin, it’s our honor for you to come here personally. Thank you very much!” The parents of Lan Qingyue quickly went up and spoke to him with smiling faces.

“Hehe, I had to come this time!” Old Qin greeted them politely with a double-edged comment.

“It’s my honor to have you attend a junior’s engagement ceremony. Old Qin, this way!” The middle-aged man and the lady welcomed him inside.

“Carry on with what you’re doing. We can go over by ourselves.” Old Qin smiled and waved them off as he led a group of people inside.

Just then, a middle-aged guy from Lan Family exclaimed, “Eh, those are the Ancient Martial Art Families, Ren Family, Xue Family, Duan Family, and Hu Family!”

“Gosh, the influence of the Liu Family is too overwhelming. All the Ancient Martial Artist Families of Rivertown are here.”

“We don’t have a Second-class Force in Rivertown, not to mention a first-class force. Hence, no one will dare to provoke us since we’re in-laws with the Liu Family. Besides, they need to give us some face, so they are here to make peace with us today!”

“Haha, you’re right. We’ll enjoy a higher status in Rivertown in the future. This engagement was the right decision to make.”
