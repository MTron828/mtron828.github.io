“There are really people who aren’t afraid of death. This is great! I can use all of your blood to nurture the merman!” said the middle-aged man.

He wore a sinister smile, lifted his arm gradually and repositioned the terrifying black spears in the sky.

Wang Xian lifted his head and stared at the middle-aged man and the fourteen people that accompanied him. He asked in an emotionless tone, “Nine Cauldron Worlds? Which world are you guys from?”

The middle-aged man who was raising his arm stiffened. He stared at Wang Xian and surprise gleamed in his eyes.

“Who are you?”

The middle-aged man lowered his arm gradually while observing Wang Xian and the group of dragonians behind him.

“I’m the Dragon King from the Dragon Sect!”

Wang Xian answered the middle-aged man before questioning him again. “May I ask which world you guys are from?”

“How did you know about the Nine Cauldron Worlds?”

The middle-aged man didn’t answer Wang Xian once again. Instead, he looked at Wang Xian with amusement and continued, “Dragon King? I heard about you some time ago. You are pretty good!”

Huh?

Seeing the middle-aged man wasn’t answering him and acting haughtily, Wang Xian found it hilarious.

“So you are the Dragon King! You are indeed as young as the rumours claimed. You even have over thirty Dan Realm experts as subordinates. That isn’t too shabby!”

Around him, the remaining dozen-odd experts of the Devil Sealing Immortal Sect were observing Wang Xian and were a little surprised by the strength he possessed.

“You are pretty strong. It would appear that I have underestimated you. Surrender to us and we won’t be stingy with our rewards to you once our Devil sealing Immortal Sect of the Xia Cauldron descends into the real world!”

A middle-aged man looked at Wang Xian, nodded his head with satisfaction and commented.

“What kind of rewards?”

Wang Xian looked at them with interest while the corner of his lips curved up slightly.

“Since you know that the Nine Cauldron Worlds will be descending into the real world soon, you would have expected a major contest soon. Do you think you could rely on your own strength to gain a foothold in the near future? Only by surrendering to us would you gain the qualification to live on. Otherwise, you are just like a mudskipper in a small pond of mud in our eyes, let alone being called the Dragon King!”

The middle-aged man standing in the middle of the group stared at Wang Xian and continued his mockeries. “Become the subordinate of our Devil Sealing Immortal Sect and you will at least have a backing!”

“You guys are truly interesting!”

Upon hearing the middle-aged man, Wang Xian’s face was filled with contempt. “Xia Cauldron world? Devil Sealing Immortal Sect? Ordering me to submit to you and be your subordinates? You guys are truly daring to dream!”

“Hehe, Senior brother. It seems like this brat is indignant to the suggestion. Let’s just kill him directly!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

A young man was staring at Wang Xian and unhappy about how Wang Xian had reacted as he spoke up with discontent.

“If he has thirty Dan Ream experts as subordinates, he must at least be at the Budding Realm. Coupled with his status in the Underworld, he’s a little more useful than the rest. Let’s keep him alive!” a lady suggested in an emotionless tone.

“He doesn’t know where he stands! Let me teach him an unforgettable lesson first!” a young man remarked with a smile as a dagger appeared in his hand suddenly.

He moved and a shadow flashed across instantly.

That incomparable and terrifying speed was on display once again. Moments ago, the young man had beheaded the plump lady with his astonishing speed.

One could easily tell how fast the group was!

The middle-aged man in the middle did not attempt to stop the young man despite seeing him striking. Instead, he simply remarked, “Just teach him a lesson and don’t go too far!”

“Haha! Alright, Senior brother!”

The voices came from different directions. Looking at the young man who was charging towards him, deep contempt flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes.

Bo!

Black light shot out from the young man’s eyes and devilish shadows appeared all around Wang Xian.

Weapons from all directions were launched towards him.

However, the young man’s body stiffened after seeing his dagger plunge into Wang Xian’s body.

With the dagger still in Wang Xian’s body, streams of water flowed out from the wound.

“All of you kneel down now and surrender!”

At this moment, Wang Xian’s chilling voice reverberated across. Soon after, to the astonishment of everyone in Devil Sealing Immortal Sect, the head of the young man flew towards them.

Bam bam!

The human head fell beside the middle-aged man standing in the middle, rolled ahead and caused knocking sounds.

“Junior brother Mei!”

The middle-aged man was astonished and shouted loudly.

Rumble!

At this moment, fear-inducing sounds of water flowing resounded.

Weng weng!

Soon after, to the horror of the group, they noticed that the sky had completely changed.

The blue water streams were able to destroy the devilish auras that were surrounding them!

The gigantic and terrifying Devil’s Doors started cracking and the entire sky was dyed blue.

Terrifying water swords formed in the sky, emitting spine-chilling penetrative force.

“We... What kind of terrifying existence have we encountered?”

At this moment, the crowd from the disordered region, who had gone down on their knees, were shivering in fear.

What kind of terrifying existence had they encountered?

They wouldn’t be a match for any of the fifteen people.

And yet, there was someone even more terrifying here who suppressed the group of fifteen alone. Listening to their conversation, they felt that this world seemed to have changed.

The disordered region was a relatively more well known place in Asia. Even the denominations in the international stage wouldn’t dare to interfere recklessly.

The truth was that those in the disordered region were all people who weren’t concerned about life and death any more.

They were people who had offended the denominations, terrified groups, or found it hard to survive in other places.

Even Budding Realm experts, who were the leaders of these Wandering Groups, were no exceptions.

Otherwise, no one would willingly be in this terrifying sea region. Although they could get precious treasures, this place was the sea after all and belonged to the marine creatures in the sea.

Incidents where even Budding Realm experts died weren’t completely an exception.

If these Budding Realm experts were to return to normal society, they would enjoy endless wealth. When placed in denominations, they would also be one of the most elite existences.

Considering the current environment, the formation of Wandering Groups by experts, who were more extreme, was generally fostered.

The Wandering Groups were referred to as Wandering Dogs by the denominations and other major forces worldwide to show how crazy they could be.

And now, the Wandering Groups of the disordered region, which were known throughout the world, were wanted by two groups of people to be their subordinates.

While undoubtedly feeling anger, they were more frightened.

The strength that these people had demonstrated was simply too strong!

Their strength had even instilled fear into these maniacs.

“What?”

The remaining fourteen experts were shocked to see their devilish auras and Devil’s Doors shattered by the terrifying streams of water.

“I’ll give you ten seconds to go on your knees or you will end up like him!”

Wang Xian took several steps forward and faced them with a gentle smile.

“YOU... Impossible! How can you possibly be so strong!? How can this be!?”

The group from Devil Sealing Immortal Sect was shivering in fear. They lifted their heads and saw a clear blue sky that was shrouded in water and the countless terrifying water swords. Their pupils constricted unconsciously.

“You have five more seconds!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly, creating a strong contrast with the exceptional bitter faces of the group from Devil Sealing Immortal Sect.

At the same time, they felt indescribable fear as they stared at Wang Xian.

It was just like moments ago when they’d put on the same front with the same might while ordering all the Wandering Groups to get on their knees.

It was just that they were now on the receiving end!

On their knees and surrendering!
