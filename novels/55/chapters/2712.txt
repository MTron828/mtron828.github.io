2713 2713, Level 1 upgrade

Within the Abyss, the Eight Point Demon Sha led a group of underlings as they wandered about.

They relied on the eight point demon Sha’s cunningness, craftiness, and meticulous thoughts to kill the various Abyss races.

As long as one was targeted by them, they wouldn’t be able to escape death.

There was nothing they could do, it was mainly because they were too crafty.

“What a pity, one undying level 9 abyss seed, 10 Undying Level 8, the rest over 800,000, it’s a pity our strength is too weak.”

Time passed day by day, at a spot of the abyss seed, Ba Qi and Mo Sha looked ahead with red eyes.

There, there was a race of the abyss.

Those were huge resources, they couldn’t wait to kill their way over.

Unfortunately, they were still not strong enough.

“Brothers, half a month’s time is up. We need to contact the Dragon King.”

Beside them, poison nine saw the red-eyed looks of Ba Qi and Mo Sha, and spoke with admiration in his heart.

“Well, take out the array compass and send a location to the Dragon King. We’ll find a suitable place for the handover.”

Ba Qi nodded and said to poison nine.

“Alright!”

Poison nine nodded immediately.

At the same time, in a remote abyss, Wang Xian was floating in the abyss as he looked at the communication stone plate in his hand.

When he saw the information and location sent from it, his body moved and he immediately flew towards the center.

After flying for an hour, Wang Xian surveyed his surroundings and confirmed the location. He then asked Ba Qi and the Demonic Fiend to come over.

After receiving the message, the eight-limbed demonic fiend and the rest immediately flew over.

“Poison nine and I have broken away from the parasitism. We will bring the corpse of the abyssal seed over. Eight-limbed demonic fiend, you stay here and guard.”

In order to prevent any special situations from occurring, they did not fly directly toward Wang Xian.

After all, it would be hard to explain if someone saw that the Dragon King was able to communicate with the abyssal seed.

“Alright!”

Ba Qi nodded.

“Let’s go.”

Mo Sha and Du Jiu immediately flew out.

“Dragon King!”

Soon, they met Wang Xian and shouted excitedly.

“How’s the harvest? There shouldn’t be any problems right?”

Wang Xian asked.

“Dragon King, there shouldn’t be any problems. Our strength is still too weak and the harvest isn’t much.”

As Mo sha spoke, he passed a few space rings to Wang Xian.

“There are six level 8 immortal god King Abyss Seeds, 19 Level 7 immortal god King Abyss Seeds, 45 level 6 abyss seeds, and about 1,000 level 8 immortal god King and above.”

Mo Sha continued.

“Not bad.”

Wang Xian heard his report and nodded his head.

These abyss seeds corpses were enough to greatly improve the entire drug production department.

They could increase the number of immortal King Level 8 members in the system department by around five.

“These abyssal seed corpses, head to the imperial court to exchange for merit points. Exchange all of your merit points into elixirs.”

Wang Xian handed the interspatial ring to them and said.

“Alright.”

Mo Sha nodded. “Du Jiu and I will head over. Dragon King, inform Ba Qi.”

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded.

Mo Sha and Du Jiu quickly flew towards the imperial court.

Their location was closer to the battlefield at the central imperial court. However, with their speed, they still needed to fly at full speed for more than a day.

“Welcome, heroes, to the Hall of Heroes.”

A Day and a half later, the two of them entered the Hall of Heroes on the planet where the teleportation formation was located. Immediately, a staff member greeted them respectfully.

“Exchange for merit points.”

Mo Sha said directly.

“Alright, please follow me. After exchanging for merit points, the two heroes will have a chance to enter the hero list. May I know your names?”

The staff member asked respectfully.

...

“Hero List? TSK TSK, just leave one, poison nine!”

Mo Sha said directly.

“Oh? Big Brother, I...”

“Alright, stop spouting nonsense. Your two big brothers don’t care about this.”

Poison nine was slightly stunned when he heard Mo Sha’s words. Before he could finish his words, Mo Sha interrupted him.

He casually handed the interspatial ring to the staff member.

“This... there are many abyssal seed corpses. Sir, please wait a moment. We will count them now.”

The staff member was slightly startled when he saw the abyssal seed corpses inside and hurriedly said.

“Exchange all the merit points into medicinal pills.”

Mo Sha opened his mouth and said.

“Yes, sir.”

...

The staff member nodded very respectfully.

After exchanging, the two directly flew out.

“Keke, little brother poison nine, take a look at your name.”

The two flew out of the hall. Mo Sha looked at the sky-reaching hero list at the side and said to poison nine.

Poison nine looked over. The sky-reaching Hero list had a hundred names.

And at the 5th name, there were two very eye catching names.

Poison nine.

This made him a little dazed.

Not long ago, he was just an undying god King warrior from an ordinary race in the Emperor Star Field. Now, his name had jumped to 5th on the hero list.

It could be said that very quickly, his name could spread throughout the entire emperor star field.

Once his name Rose, it would be known to the world!

“TSK TSK TSK, let’s go. Your name will be at the top in the future.”

Mo Sha let out a strange cry and the two of them flew back quickly.

“Dragon King, we have exchanged all the abyssal seed corpses for Elixirs.”

A Day and a half later, Mo Sha and the rest returned and handed the elixirs over.

“Call the rest of the members of the poison making department over to upgrade.”

Wang Xian looked at the elixirs and said directly.

“It’s the Dragon King!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The demonic poison nine nodded and immediately flew into the abyss.

Wang Xian took out the pill and swallowed it directly, transforming it into Dragon Qi.

Ten minutes later, five hundred members of the poison making department flew over under Ba Qi’s lead.

“Dragon King.”

The members of the Dragon Palace shouted respectfully.

“Alright, Ba Qi. You should know a little about all the resources. You can decide how much they can upgrade.”

Wang Xian said directly to Ba Qi.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ba Qi nodded.

Wang Xian waved his arm. Streams of Dragon Qi flew out from his body and landed in the sky above them.

Under the distribution of Ba Qi, Wang Xian injected the dragon qi directly into the bodies of the members of the poison making department.

The resources this time were enough for every member of the poison making department to have the combat strength of an immortal king.

Furthermore, there were more than 1,000 immortal god King Level 4 and above.

After the success of the first batch of members, Ba Qi brought the second batch of members to upgrade.

“Alright, all of them have been upgraded.”

After using up all the dragon energy from the pills, Wang Xian said to Ba Qi.

“Then, Dragon King, let’s continue to fight. This time, we can hunt even more abyss seeds.”

Ba Qi’s eyes gleamed.

This time, their poison department all had undying Emperor level battles, along with Poison 9 undying Emperor Level 8 strength reaching 6.

They could plan for even more powerful abyss species.

“Little ones, get ready for me. Let’s Go Plan for the race with undying emperor level 9 abyss species and kill them.”

The eight spirits flew back and roared with fighting spirit.
