The rarity of a dragon seed could be said to be the backbone of the entire Dragon Palace. It was where the power of the Dragon Palace lay.

However, in the system, there was no price for a dragon seed. In other words, it was not something that he could buy at the moment.

After completing the mission of ruling the Earth’s oceans, he would be able to obtain a dragon seed, the thorned dragon seed.

The thorned dragon seed was known to be the strongest dragon seed in the Dragon Palace for assassination.

“I wonder how it compares to the strange demon clan?”

Wang Xian thought to himself. In the current Dragon Palace, he felt that the Golden Swordfish clan and the strange demon clan had the greatest potential.

Especially the strange demon clan. He could definitely threaten existences of a higher level than him.

There were many formations and materials in the treasure trove, but these were not things that he could use. Wang Xian took a glance and turned them off immediately.

“Dominate the Earth’s oceans!”

Wang Xian looked ahead with his eyes shining. With the current strength of the Dragon Palace, they could completely dominate the entire Earth’s oceans.

“However, I can still wait for now!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and revealed a smile.

He could definitely wait for now. Now that the spiritual energy from the supernatural continent had just poured into earth, it was time for the creatures in the oceans to benefit.

Especially those powerful creatures, they might be able to reach the immortal level soon.

At that time, he could completely reap the harvest.

Submit, or die.

If he submitted, the Dragon Palace would gain a group of powerful subordinates.

And if he killed them, he could use their dragon blood to cultivate a group of subordinates. It was a perfect solution.

“Brother, you’ve made a breakthrough!”

“Xiao Xian, have you made a breakthrough?”

Xiao Yu, Guan Shuqing, and the other girls ran over and asked Wang Xian excitedly.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile. He swept his gaze across the girls and said, “Next, all of you have to cultivate well. Try to complete the first change as soon as possible and reach the transcendence realm. Only transcendence can truly step into cultivation!”

“Don’t worry. In a year or two at most, we will be able to break through to the transcendence realm. Let’s go and celebrate!”

Xiao Yu and the rest walked happily into the Dragon King’s bedroom.

Wang Xian smiled.

In the following period of time, Wang Xian and the rest stayed in the Dragon Palace and began to train again.

In two to three days, one member of the Dragon Palace advanced to the immortal level.

Wang Xian did not pay attention to the changes on land. During this period of time, he dealt with the situation in the Dragon Palace.

Preaching, patrolling the ocean, and cultivating.

Lan qingyue, Guan Shuqing, and a few other girls accompanied Wang Xian every day. Only Xiao Yu went out for a period of time from time to time.

Even her cultivation was abandoned.

Wang Xian smiled at this and did not stop her.

Xiao Yu was already 23 or 24 years old. Even a girl as old as her hometown had a child.

Now that he thought about it, Xiao Yu was already at the age to get married.

Time passed slowly. A year might not be long, but to the Dragon Palace and the entire earth, it was a huge change.

“Brother!”

Wang Xian was playing with Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue and the rest in the bedroom when Xiao Yu ran in and shouted at him.

“Hey, Xiao Yu is back from her date with her lover. How rare! She has been away for almost a month!”

Guan Shuqing teased Xiao Yu.

“I hate sister-in-law. It hasn’t even been a month yet. Brother, this is an invitation from the Yuwen clan. They asked me to pass it to you!”

Xiao Yu took a card and handed it to Wang Xian.

“What invitation? What’s the matter?”

Wang Xian took the invitation card. It was an invitation card and he asked curiously.

“Yu Wenhua from the Yuwen clan is getting married to the daughter of the celestial king of the Nordic Divine Realm. He is going to get married and has invited all the forces on Earth. Naturally, he will also invite you, Brother!”

Xiao Yu walked over with a smile and held Wang Xian’s arm as she said.

“A marriage alliance? I really didn’t expect that. They should all be immortals, right?”

“Yes, Yuwen Hua’s cultivation has reached the realm of immortals. Oh right, brother, your disciple, Xiao Ran, has also reached the realm of Immortals a few days ago!”

Xiao Yu introduced to Wang Xian, “Do you want to go out this time? You’ve been in the sea for a year. Go and take a look at what’s happening outside. The changes outside are very, very great!”

“Now, the eastern and Western immortal sects and the divine realm have basically merged together. This marriage alliance between the Northern European divine realm, the strongest force in the west, and the Yuwen clan is considered to be of historical significance!”

“It’s time to go out and take a look. As for whether we should go or not, we’ll see when the time comes!”

Wang Xian nodded his head slowly.

“Sister-in-law, let’s go together. Now that the spiritual energy has impacted, the Earth has changed a lot. It’s very beautiful outside!”

Xiao Yu said to Guan Shuqing and the rest.

“Alright, Xiao Yu. Should we let that Feng Lingtian come over to meet the parents? Elder brother is like a father!”

Guan Shuqing and the rest nodded with a smile.

Xiao Yu stuck out her tongue this time and didn’t refute.

“Let’s go back to Jiang City to take a look first!”

Wang Xian thought for a moment and said.

“Alright, let’s see how the world outside is changing!”

Wang Xian and the rest flew out. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Master!”

Just as they walked out of the Dragon Palace, a huge creature shouted at LAN qingyue.

Lan Qingyue flew over, touched its nose, and flew outside.

Lan Qingyue’s first Kun had already reached 400 meters in size. As for her strength, she had already reached the first stage of transcendence.

She was even stronger than Lan Qingyue.

In the current Dragon Palace, other than Wang Xian, the second person to advance to transcendence was the Hydra AO jiu. The third person was the Kun.

Secondly, in the current Dragon Palace, there were already more than 280 immortal-level members.

Among them, there were more immortal-level members in the strange demon clan. There were a total of 100 of them.

There were also 30 members in the Golden Swordfish clan.

This time, there were four of them who were with Wang Xian. Ao Jian was an upper-level immortal, and there were three middle-level golden swordfish.

As he flew toward Jiang City, Wang Xian saw the trees below. They were at least 40 to 50 meters tall and thick.

The entire sky was blue as well. The impact of the spiritual energy had changed the surrounding environment.

Earth had already switched from technology to cultivation. It was said that even the school had become an ancient martial arts academy.

Everything was because of the empress, Feng Luan. This could also be considered as indirectly helping the humans on Earth to evolve!

“Rack!”

At this moment, shouts came from the sky. A few hundred people rode their horses and galloped over.

This horse was not an ordinary horse, but a Pegasus. It was able to fly in the sky and possessed the strength of a dan stage cultivator.

The great changes in the world had benefited not only humans, but also some fierce beasts.

Dan stage cultivators could fly in the sky, so there were many people flying in the sky. Some people were even riding on beasts. They were incomparably domineering.

“Haha, the group in front is the destination. We just happened to be asking for directions!”

A soft shout rang out, and the group immediately let out a loud roar as the Pegasus charged over.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Hundreds of Pegasus gave off a feeling as if there were thousands of soldiers and horses charging over.
