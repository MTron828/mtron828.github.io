Chapter 604: Immortal Slaying Sect, Roving Sword

The deaths of fifteen Budding Realm experts shocked the entire Yong Chang City. Soon after, news on this matter also reached the three Immortal Sects.

However, this matter ended without any results.

The forces behind the elixir pill shops and weapons shops of Yong Chang City had activated spirit arrays and artificial rain when they struck.

There weren’t any traces of evidence left.

The Enforcers of Yong Chang City couldn’t find any useful information.

Coupled with the fact that the families had intentionally wanted to hide the matter, no conclusive result was obtained on the matter.

Some members of the higher management of the three Immortal Sects found this to be a little dubious. However, this incident would have far-reaching consequences and few had the abilities to investigate.

Although the entire Yong Chang City was discussing the matter, there were no conclusive results.

“So they were from these families!”

Wang Xian stood by the door and heard the discussions of the surrounding crowd. A smirk appeared on his face.

He had an additional rationale for hanging the corpses of these people on the Yong Chang Tower. That was to find information on them.

Just as he had expected, he got the information about these people from the surrounding crowd.

Wang Xian smirked and returned to the second floor of his shop.

Huh?

However, he picked up a familiar feeling at this moment. Joy beamed in Wang Xian’s eyes.

He moved to the door and looked to the East.

At the same time, several tens of kilometers away, a middle-aged man flying on his sword felt his heart skip a beat. Fervent excitement gleamed in his eyes.

The middle-aged man was expressionless and had a terrifying edge hidden within his body. It was as though he was a razor-sharp sword hidden within a scabbard.

Around him, there were several youths and middle-aged men. From time to time, this group of people would look at him with respect and fear.

“Wait for me here. I’m going to a place and will be back soon!”

The middle-aged man spoke to those around him. The next moment, he charged across the skies like a terrifying sword while disappearing from sight at an unbelievable speed.

“Mentor Ao...”

The group was taken aback when they saw the figure disappearing. They exchanged glances, stopped in their flight and waited on the spot.

“Dragon King!”

At the entrance of the small shop, Wang Xian saw the middle-aged man walking towards him.

“Come in!”

Wang Xian scrutinized Roving Sword from top to bottom while revealing a radiant smile.

“Roving Sword! Where did you come from? Were you injured when you got here?”

“Dragon King, I suffered terrifying attacks when I entered this world. I only managed to withstand them after returning to my original form. I landed in a lake by accident and joined the Immortal Slaying Sect after I recovered. Now, I’m a disciple of the Immortal Slaying Sect!”

Roving Sword followed Wang Xian into the shop and explained what had happened to him.

“Immortal Slaying Sect? It seems like you’ve had a chance encounter of your own!”

Wang Xian was slightly surprised. Feeling the edge from the body of Roving Sword, he was very satisfied.

As compared to when he was in the outside world, Roving Sword had grown a lot stronger.

“Dragon King, are we going back?” Roving Sword looked at Wang Xian and asked.

“We are definitely going back. However, now isn’t the time!”

Wang Xian walked up to the second floor and continued, “Continue staying in the Immortal Slaying Sect for the near future and wait for me to summon you. Besides that, search for the place where the spirit array is the weakest in Yong Chang world!”

“Yes, Dragon King!”

Roving Sword nodded his head immediately.

Mmm! Wang Xian nodded his head, looked at Roving Sword and asked, “How far are you from reaching Level 13 now?”

“Dragon King, I’m still about thirty million points of dragon energy away!” answered Roving Sword. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Members of the Dragon Palace required slightly less dragon energy as compared to Wang Xian.

This was because they weren’t authentic divine dragons at this moment and were required to form their own divine dragon bodies to reach the First Transformation of the Divine Dragon Transformation.

This process of metamorphosis required a large amount of dragon energy.

However, the advancement in levels for members of the Dragon Palace couldn’t rely on devouring marine animals to extract dragon energy. Other divine dragons wouldn’t be able to do so either.

This was a unique ability for the one with the divine dragon cultivation system.

In addition, the divine dragon cultivation system had another ability. That was that it allowed Wang Xian to inject dragon energy directly into Roving Sword’s body.

It was similar to imparting abilities to another person. Within the universe, this was also a relatively difficult task to achieve.

To impart personal internal energy to others, the one imparting the energy would exhaust their personal energy. If the exhaustion was too great, the one receiving might explode from the infusion of energy.

However, this wouldn’t be an issue for Wang Xian as he had the system in place.

“Over thirty million?”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes. If it was possible, he wanted to increase Roving Sword’s strength to Level 13 or, in other words, the Immortal Realm.

In that case, the Dragon Sect would have an Immortal-class existence other than him and things would be more convenient.

“Take this and return to the Immortal Slaying Sect while waiting for my summons!”

Wang Xian retrieved a piece of metal from the space ring and handed it to Roving Sword.

This was the Positive-Negative Metal. The same words would appear on one piece of metal when one wrote on the other. This was one unique way of communicating.

“Yes, Dragon King!”

Roving Sword nodded his head and left.

“Continue refining!”

Roving Sword being alive was a pleasant surprise for Wang Xian.

Looking at the metal materials around the room, he continued his refining.

Over the next few days, Wang Xian focused solely on refining spiritual equipment.

Perhaps killing fifteen Budding Realm experts the previous time had the effect of deterrence. Over the last few days, no one was sent to assassinate him.

Over this period, huge families and forces went to Wang Xian with requests to refine their elixir pulls and spiritual equipment.

After refining for five days, the materials left in the shop had increased instead of decreasing.

However, Wang Xian accepted all requests. As long as people requested for him to refine elixir pills or spiritual equipment, he wouldn’t reject them and gave a guarantee he would complete the orders within half a month.

“It’s close to the arranged timing with the Elders. Time to head to Da Hong Immortal Sect!”

At the thought that Da Hong Immortal Sect still had various elixir pills and spiritual equipment for him to refine, Wang Xian’s eyes beamed with anticipation.

Although the interest given by Da Hong Immortal Sect was even lower, the number of elixir pills and spiritual equipment that Da Hong Immortal Sect wanted to refine was astronomical.

The business of the shop can’t stop either. It seems like I have to ask the Mu Family to run it for me!

Wang Xian closed the door and thought to himself. After which, he flew rapidly towards Da Hong Immortal Sect.

“Elder Wang is here!”

When Wang Xian arrived at the main peak, the five Elders, who had been waiting for him, stepped forward to receive him.

The Great Elder examined Wang Xian curiously and no one knew what he was thinking.

“Great Elder, Second Elder...”

Wang Xian nodded his head and greeted them. “Elders, where’s the place for me to refine elixir pills and spiritual equipment. Let’s start tonight!”

“Alright! Elder Wang is truly a fanatic at refining elixir pills and spiritual equipment. It’s definitely not a fluke that you have become an alchemist master and blacksmith master!”

The Elders were also impressed with Wang Xian’s attitude.

Based on the news they had gathered, this overly young alchemist master and blacksmith master had spent close to ninety-five percent of his time on refining.

Becoming a master was definitely not a fluke!
