Chapter 1060: The competition between the three academies of 10

Translator: 5496903

Beside the army of ocean cultivators, there were many people from the mercenary groups waiting by the side.

They were all mercenary groups that had accepted the mission of the Holy Sea Town and were prepared to advance together with the Army of ocean cultivators.

Wang Xian saw that it was not time yet and stood at the East Gate and waited.

“Everyone, follow me. This time, the Demon Hunters Academy and the East Sea Academy will be heading to the holy sea town as well. As one of the three academies, the Ocean Academy, as the future elites of the army of ocean cultivators, we must not lose to them. We must hunt down fierce beasts and demonic beasts so that they can witness our prowess. When the members of the Demon Hunters Academy and the East Sea Academy see us, they will call us big brother. Haha!”

Not long after, more than 600 students walked out from the east gate. Wang Xian looked over.

They were dressed neatly, just like the army of ocean cultivators. They were dressed in sky-blue with the word “Ocean”embroidered on them.

Wang Xian smiled faintly when he heard their words.

It seemed that the competition between the three major academies was quite intense. No wonder the Dean called him over and asked him to lead the team. This was related to the honor of the academy.

If an academy were to shine during such a time of defending the city, it would undoubtedly have a great impact on the entire Donghai City.

“Captain!”

More than half an hour later, the students of the Demon Hunters Academy arrived. When they saw Wang Xian standing not far away from the east gate, they walked forward and greeted him respectfully.

“HMM, there are still more than ten minutes left. You guys wait here first!”

Wang Xian said directly to the students who had arrived.

Two hours passed slowly. The students of the Demon Hunters Academy arrived and stood quietly in front of Wang Xian.

Wang Xian looked at the time and looked at the students in front of him. “Who else hasn’t arrived?”

“Captain, the five instructors and Qian Hu haven’t arrived yet?”

Xia houming looked around and answered immediately.

“Is there any more?”

Wang Xian continued to ask.

Everyone looked left and right without saying a word.

“The five instructors and Qian Hu are here!”

At this moment, the voice of a young man was heard. Wang Xian looked towards the east entrance.

There were five instructors, three middle-aged men and two-meter-old men.

Qian Hu’s father, director Qian, was walking in the middle and conversing with the few instructors beside him.

Qian Hu was also echoing from the side.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly when he saw them walking over.

“Is everyone here?”

Director Qian saw the group of people, Wang Xian and the rest, standing in unison. He walked over and said with a smile on his face.

“Except for the few teachers, everyone else is here!”

Wang Xian looked at them and said faintly.

“Huh?”

“Huh?”

Everyone was slightly stunned as they looked at Wang Xian in astonishment.

The five mentors were also slightly stunned. They frowned and looked at Wang Xian as well.

“Hehe, the ocean cultivators army will only set off in about ten minutes. It’s not too late, it’s not too late!”

A middle-aged mentor said with a chuckle.

Although he understood the meaning behind Wang Xian’s words, he was not too angry. After all, Wang Xian’s strength was at transcendent level seven, which was the same level as him.

Even if he was a teacher, he didn’t have the right to flaunt his status in front of a powerhouse of the same level.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and spoke to everyone. Then, he walked straight to the side of the ocean cultivators’army.

“He really thinks of himself as the leader!”

Qian Hu looked at Wang Xian with dissatisfaction in his eyes. He grunted and followed behind.

When they came to the side of the ocean cultivators’army, a group of people stood there.

An old man in the front looked around and realized that they were students from the Demon Hunter College. He didn’t say anything either.

“The people from the Demon Hunter College are here!”

“I heard that this mission is the assessment mission for the Demon Hunter College’s graduates. I wonder who is their leader!”

“If it isn’t Xia houming who is the leader of the Demon Hunter College’s graduates, it must be Qian Hu. The chances of Qian Hu being here are higher!”

At the front, a group of students from Ocean Academy saw them coming. They looked at them and said softly.

“Haha, the students from Demon Hunter Academy and Ocean Academy have all come. This mission is for elite students. When the time comes, we will have a competition!”

At this moment, a loud laughter was heard. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The voice attracted many people. A long bearded old man rode a two-legged ferocious bird beast and walked over.

Behind him were three to four hundred students of East Ocean Academy.

“The flowers in the greenhouse have also come. Haha, Old Beard, I hope you won’t lose face this time!”

At Ocean Academy, an old man looked over with a faint smile on his face.

“Hehe, then we’ll see!”

The long-bearded old man riding on the bird beast narrowed his eyes slightly and said coldly.

“Don’t Disgrace Our Demon Hunter College!”

Director Qian Glanced at the two people and said to the students.

“Yes!”

The students of Demon Hunter College also said with fighting spirit.

“What are you waiting for? Let’s go. Let’s see who gets to Holy Sea Town First!”

The old man with a long beard who was riding on the bird walked forward with the others. He glanced at the students of Demon Hunter College and Ocean College and said with a laugh.

“Alright, let’s see who will arrive at Shenghai Town First!”

The old man from the Ocean College responded immediately and looked at the Demon Hunter College.

“Let’s Go!”

When the five instructors saw the situation, they immediately gave the order.

It would take a few days to get to Shenghai town from here. However, if they were to travel at full speed, they would be able to arrive within ten hours.

The last time, Wang Xian had only traveled for a few days because he had some goods with the merchant caravan.

This time, the lowest level of an extraordinaire was at level four. The demonic beasts and ferocious beasts along the way were usually at level three or four. It didn’t affect them much.

“Let’s set off. The speed of an extraordinaire at level three is sufficient. Be careful of your surroundings. From Donghai City to Shenghai town, there is a possibility of encountering an extraordinaire level seven ferocious beast!”

Wang Xian immediately gave the order and told everyone.

“Yes!”

Everyone responded immediately and dashed forward.

“Charge!”

The students of Oceanography Academy and EASTSEA Academy also rushed forward immediately.

The first competition among the three academies began.

The instructors flew in the sky and followed them.

Everything was still dominated by the students. When the captain gave the order, he was only guiding and assisting the students at the side.

The main thing was the ability of the forging students.

Wang Xian was also directly suspended in the sky while Ao Jian and the rest were guarding the surroundings.

“This group of guards of student Wang Xian are all at transcendent level seven?”

“That should be right. Although they have concealed their strength, I can sense that their explosive power is definitely not weaker than mine!”

The two instructors looked at Wang Xian who was flying at the front and spoke in a low voice.

Director Qian, who was at the side, raised his eyebrows. His gaze swept across Wang Xian and the rest, and he frowned slightly.

The speed of the group was very fast. They arrived at the region of the Wind Arrow Mountain in an hour.

“Lower Your Speed!”

Wang Xian immediately landed at the front and spoke to everyone.

Not far away, oceanography academy and EASTSEA Academy were a few thousand meters apart from them. They entered the region of the Wind Arrow Mountain separately!
