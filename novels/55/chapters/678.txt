Chapter 679: The Might Of The Dragon Palace

“This... This is...!”

Tang Yinxuan immediately took a look below her feet. That terrifying creature that was over seventy meters huge seemed to be swimming slowly ahead. However, it covered several thousand meters each second.

On the back of this monster, there was a group of terrifying creatures.

From her perspective, the weakest would be the group of dragonians whom she knew a little better!

“They are members of my Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian turned to Tang Yinxuan and remarked plainly, with no intention to hide it at all.

The Nine Cauldron Worlds were about to descend upon the real world. When the timing was right, he would also reveal the Dragon Palace to the public by announcing their existence.

“Dragon Palace?”

Tang Yinxuan was a little lost as she looked around her in disbelief.

Wu wu!

At this moment, she could hear the screeches of dolphins. She turned around, caressed the dolphin who had been carrying her and asked with a gentle voice, “Are you guys alright?”

Wu wu!

A pink bottlenose dolphin rubbed its face against Tang Yinxuan, shook its head and let out two screeches.

“You are saying they killed over a hundred of your companions?”

When Wang Xian heard the pink bottlenose dolphin, his face darkened as he asked the dolphin this.

Wu wu!

The pink bottlenose dolphin nodded its head and said, “Dragon King, those people are so cruel. Not only did they kill our companions, but they also slaughtered all the marine races around them!”

“I’ll take revenge for you!”

A light flickered in Wang Xian eyes as ruthlessness flashed across his eyes.

“You can understand them?”

Tang Yinxuan was astonished as she stood by the side and saw Wang Xian conversing with the pink bottlenose dolphin.

“You could say that they are my citizens!” Wang Xian looked towards the dolphin and smiled.

The pink bottlenose dolphin poked Tang Yinxuan with its nose as it tried to talk to her.

“On stricter terms, these dolphins are the first batch of intelligent creatures within the region of our Dragon Palace. Moreover, from the soundwaves that it emitted previously, they seem to have entered a rather unique path of cultivation!”

Prime Minister Turtle was observing the pod of dolphins while pondering about them.

“If there are intelligent species, we will impart knowledge to them. Even if they can’t make it past the Dragon Gate eventually, we still have to guide and restrict them to some extent!”

“Yes, Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Turtle nodded its head. Since the Dragon Palace would be establishing its dynasty within the sea, it would naturally have its citizens.

Ordinary marine creatures wouldn’t be considered as their citizens. Only when marine races had their intelligence manifested would they be considered citizens.

For marine races that had no intelligence, their deaths wouldn’t be significant.

However, for marine races that had intelligence, the Dragon Palace would have to step in if they were slaughtered rampantly.

In the plans that Wang Xian and Prime Minister Turtle had, the Dragon Palace would only care about the dominance of the seas in the future. Marine creatures wouldn’t step onto land and would be restricted from attacking humans.

This would result in an isolated sea civilization.

Just as the marine races were evolving rapidly, the spiritual energy waterfall would be the greatest encounter for them.

However, the marine races were being slaughtered rampantly by humans currently. The Dragon Palace couldn’t just ignore it. Not only would the Dragon Palace want to be involved, but they also wanted revenge for the marine races that had been slaughtered!

Wang Xian looked ahead and asked Tang Yinxuan, “Are there many martial artists under the spiritual energy waterfall?”

“I don’t know. When we are cultivating under the sea surface, a group of foreign martial artists dived into the water directly and started slaughtering the marine creatures around them.”

Tang Yinxuan shook her head and sorrow filled her eyes. The deaths of over a hundred dolphins had truly caused her heart to break.

From her perspective, these dolphins were even more loyal than humans.

“In that case, let’s just head there directly!”

Wang Xian didn’t question it further. He stood upright while staring coldly towards his twelve o’clock.

While standing on the Kun, his eyes flickered. In less than two minutes, the pungent scent of blood assailed his nostrils.

“Lots of marine races are dead. At least a billion of them! Although these marine races had no intelligence, they were rather gifted considering that they had arrived under the spiritual energy waterfall in advance!”

Prime Minister Turtle’s face darkened upon picking up the scent of blood from the water.

“It seems like they are pretty strong!”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes. A blue and red light flashed in his eyes as he observed his twelve o’clock vigilantly.

Balls of energy appeared in his vision. Among them, Wang Xian saw an existence with an image resembling the vast sea within his body.

That figure was seated and was absorbing the spiritual energy that had fallen into the sea at a frenzied pace.

“Immortal! There’s an Immortal Realm existence right ahead!”

Wang Xian lifted his head and looked towards the mountain peak. “It’s not just one. There are a total of three of them!”

“Dragon King, no matter how many Immortals they have, we have to take revenge for the hundred citizens of ours that were killed!” Prime Minister Turtle remarked coldly.

“Naturally!”

A faint sense of killing intent emanated from Wang Xian’s body.

Roving Heavens and Roving Sword stepped forward and stopped behind Wang Xian.

On a huge Kun, Wang Xian and the other three Immortal-class Dragon Palace members stood at the very front. Behind them was a group of powerful Dragon Palace members.

The thousand-strong group of Dragon Palace members was starting to exhibit their dominance.

The might of the Dragon Palace was now vaguely visible.

A terrifying aura shrouded forward.

Below the spiritual energy waterfall, countless sea snakes and a middle-aged man sat on the peak of the underwater mountain.

The founder of the Creepy Snake Group sat on the peak of the center mountain and had a greyish poisonous snake wrapped around his neck.

The poison snake rested its head on the old man’s head while absorbing the spiritual energy that was falling from the sky.

Weng!

“What horrifying aura!”

At this moment, Da She jerked open his eyes abruptly. A blood-red light flashed across his eyes as he looked ahead.

“What terrifying aura!”

“What’s the situation? Could there be other Immortal Realm existences heading here?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Around him, the crowd of Creepy Snake Group members opened their eyes instantly as they looked ahead in shock.

Boom!

The moment they opened their eyes, they stood up immediately.

Even Da She got on his feet as he stared intensely at the ginormous creature approaching him.

His gaze fell on the group of figures on the ginormous creature and was instantly astonished.

However, the next moment, he flicked his tongue out gradually and licked his lips. His eyes were filled with bloodlust!

Over seventy meters! That’s definitely the largest living creature on earth.

“They are the ones!”

Tang Yinxuan, who was standing by the side, was infuriated upon seeing the Creepy Snake Group members.

The pod of dolphins also screeched in anger.

“Rest assured. None of them is getting away today!”

“Dragon King, leave this to my Devil Division!”

Roving Heavens patted his ear and a golden rod appeared in his hand. He lifted the golden rod up with a strong desire for battle as he remarked.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. He turned around to face Roving Sword and Prime Minister Turtle. “Don’t let them get away!”

“Rest assured, Dragon King. After killing so many of our citizens, we would never let them escape from this place!”

“Today, we will have the blood of an Immortal for the memorial ceremony of our dead citizens of the Dragon Palace!”

The blood of an Immortal for the memorial ceremony!
