Chapter 2938: Armory’s treasure 5

Creator!

The reason why he carried the mechanical heart and fled was for the body on the throne.

The most important part of a robot was the drive, the energy source that supported the entire body’s energy.

The mechanical heart he controlled now was the only core in the armory that could allow him to erupt with the strength of a tier three divine emperor.

!!

The value of this core was far from what his body could compare to.

He could create a body, but there was only one core.

And only this core could allow him to control a rank three divine emperor body and unleash the power of a rank three divine emperor.

The creator stared at the body in front of him with fervent eyes and immediately flew over.

“Beep Beep Beep Beep! Warning! Unknown person has entered! Warning! Unknown person has entered!”

At this moment, the entire mechanical territory was filled with urgent sounds.

In the sky above the mechanical castle and the surrounding factories, a red warning light sounded.

“What?”

The Creator’s mechanical heart froze slightly and he couldn’t help but let out a low roar.

His heart moved and he quickly flew towards the body in front of him.

“Beep, beginning to fuse with the body. 1% … 2% … 3% …”

“Weng!”

The moment he entered the body, he immediately sensed the space around him.

The next moment, he saw two figures descending into the castle at a terrifying speed.

“What! How is this possible? How can they still be following us? I’ve made a precise calculation that I’m 100% certain that I won’t die. How is this possible! ?”

The creator immediately stood up. His face was filled with shock and anger. His expression kept changing.

“Bang!”

At this moment, a loud sound came from the sky above the castle. Wang Xian and the Heaven Array landed in the castle and stared at the Creator with a smile.

“Creator, it has been more than three months. You took more than three months to come back here. You are really meticulous!”

Wang Xian stared at the Creator with a smile on his face.

“Dragon King, how did you escape my detection? How did you do it?”

The creator stood up and questioned loudly.

“Your computational ability can only calculate what you already know. There are many things that you don’t know!”

Wang Xian stared at the creator and smiled faintly.

Boom

The next moment, Wang Xian’s body moved. His arm turned into a dragon claw as he grabbed at the creator.

“No!”

The creator looked at Wang Xian’s attack and felt that his mechanical heart had yet to completely fuse with his body. His expression changed drastically as he roared in fear.

Bang

Wang Xian’s Dragon Claw grabbed onto the creator’s body directly. The powerful force caused the entire body to make a sound.

“Eh? What a tough body!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly. A wave of destructive energy attacked the creator from the Dragon Claw.

“Bzzz bzzz!”

A special sound came from the creator’s body.

“Warning warning. The body is under the attack of a powerful energy. Please remove it immediately. Please remove it immediately!”

The warning sound rang in the creator’s mind. His expression was ferocious.

Now that his body had not been completely fused, he could not completely control this body.

“Roar, Dragon King!”

An angry roar came out of his mouth. His eyes were filled with killing intent as he stared at Wang Xian.

“Bang!”

“You’re courting death!”

Wang Xian stared at the creator. His other arm turned into a dragon claw and smacked heavily at the creator’s body.

At the side, the Heaven Array set up a formation.

“Isolate the space and create a new space.”

“I think the creator might need a signal if he wants to escape. If I seal this place and there’s no signal, how are you going to escape, Creator?”

The Heaven Array stared at the creator and said faintly.

“No, no. Dragon King, I’m warning you. If you dare to kill this body of mine, I will definitely not let you off. I will definitely Make Your Dragon Palace pay a heavy price!”

“I have a life backup. If you destroy this consciousness of mine, my life backup will be reactivated. Let Me Go. As long as you let me go, I will never become enemies with the Dragon Palace in the future. Otherwise, we will not rest until one of us is dead!”

The creator’s expression became even more unsightly when he heard Tian Chen’s words.

However, he was still full of malevolence and fury as he threatened. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

When Tian Chen heard his words, he frowned slightly.

“I have to say, such a powerful robot is really difficult to deal with!”

As he spoke, he shook his head helplessly.

“Hehe, I don’t care if you have a life backup or not. Restart your body. I have been chasing you for so long because of the treasures you have here!”

Wang Xian stared at the creator and said mockingly.

“Bang!”

He waved his dragon claw and streams of terrifying energy rushed into his body.

Crack Crack Crack

Waves of terrifying tearing force tore off the parts of his body one by one.

“Bang!”

He smashed open his chest forcefully and the mechanical heart was beating violently inside.

It was transmitting energy.

Wang Xian grabbed it with his dragon claw and held it in his hand as he sized it up.

“Dragon King, I will not let you off. I, the creator, will not let your Dragon Palace off!”

The Creator’s shrill roar came from within the mechanical heart.

“This energy is so strong. I wonder if ao crab and the rest can devour it!”

Wang Xian ignored the creator’s angry roar. He sized up the creator’s energy source and said faintly.

He didn’t care about the creator’s revenge at all.

Even if the creator still had the so-called life backup.

After obtaining the resources of the entire machine royal territory, how could the creator take revenge on the Dragon Palace?

“Dragon King, this should be an energy core created by the Creator with a powerful supreme treasure. To the devouring dragon, this is a huge treasure!”

Heaven array walked over, looked at the mechanical heart and said.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian smiled and held it in his hand as he scanned his surroundings.

It was a level three body of the void God realm. The entire mechanical castle was made of materials at the peak of the Immortal King Realm.

This was only a part of the creator’s trump card.

“Let’s go and take a look at the treasures in this space!”

“Let’s see if there are any more supreme treasures!”

Wang Xian spoke to the heaven array with a smile on his face as he flew towards the surrounding areas.

“Roar!”

The Creator’s mechanical heart, which was in Wang Xian’s hand, let out an indignant roar when it heard their words.

“Self-destruct and activate the life backup!”

He gave an order in despair as he stared at Wang Xian.

All the information about the creator in the mechanical heart had disappeared.

Wang Xian looked at the mechanical heart in his hand and felt a portion of the energy disappear. He smiled faintly.

“There’s a special factory here. The energy inside is very strong. It should be the creator’s treasure house!”

He sensed everything in this space and flew to the right.

“The Treasure House of the Life Experiment!”

Soon, Wang Xian arrived above the factory. He looked at the name on it curiously and flew over.
