Chapter 328: Killing Openly

“I... admit defeat!”

On the training field, Hu Qingqing mumbled out three words bitterly.

Everyone around could hear these words clearly. As she admitted her defeat, the water flow around her dissipated completely.

The surrounding disciples of the Heavenly Sound Sect were shocked as they witnessed what had happened.

Similarly, members of the higher management of the Heavenly Sound Sect were dumbfounded. They looked intensely at the Hao Zhong zither in Tang Yinxuan’s hands and took a deep breath.

“Tang Yinxuan wins and will succeed as the Saintess through her own strength. If anyone isn’t satisfied, you may step forward now!”

The Sect Leader looked across the crowd and her attention eventually fell on Tang Yinxuan and the powerful zither.

The surrounding disciples had all quieted down. No one was speaking at this moment.

The qualities and strength Tang Yinxuan had demonstrated had made these disciples speechless. In fact, she had won many over.

At this very moment, the surrounding disciples felt more embarrassment. Recalling the ridicule and mockeries that they made about her previously, they felt flushed. There’s no way they could still step forward to object to the outcome.

Puff!

Hu Qingqing took a deep breath bitterly. “I’m not convinced. The selection of the Saintess also involves influence and respect from others on top of one’s strength.

Just as she spoke, the two young men who had been standing beside her previously moved and came to Hu Qingqing.

A strong aura emanated from them.

Hu Qingqing looked at the two young men behind her and revealed a faint smile. While I was cultivating diligently for the last two years, these two Half-step to Inborn Realm experts have followed me. Moreover, they have established a Second-class Force. Currently, I can mobilize...”

As Hu Qingqing spoke, she seemed to have regained her confidence of before her defeat. She lifted her chin up and spoke loudly to the crowd.

Hua la!

However, another voice sounded from above when she was still speaking.

All the disciples of the Heavenly Sound Sect were taken aback and lifted their heads in shock.

Hu Qingqing was caught by surprise too as she turned towards the source of that voice.

The higher management of the Heavenly Sound Sect was surprised and looked coldly towards the sky.

A book flew down from the sky and towards the Sect Leader of the Heavenly Sound Sect.

At the same time, ten men in black uniforms and the Abyss Masks leapt down from the mountain peak.

When the disciples of the Heavenly Sound Sect saw the Abyss Masks, they were stunned.

These masks...?

“They are from the Abyss! They are assassins from the Abyss!”

At that instant, the same name flashed across the mind of the disciples. Some even exclaimed out loud.

“Dressed in black and wearing Abyss Masks. They are assassins from the Abyss!”

All the disciples were shocked. The Abyss was the most horrifying assassination group currently. After annihilating the Dark Conjurers, they were widely regarded by the Underworld as being closest to a Sacred Sect. In fact, many regarded them as a horrifying organization that possessed equivalent strength to a Sacred Sect.

Why would the people from the Abyss appear in the Heavenly Sound Sect?

All the disciples were alerted. They held their weapons tightly in their hands and observed the ten assassins that had landed in the training field attentively.

Rumble!

At this moment, all the members of the higher management of the Heavenly Sound Sect, who were seated at the elevated stage, stood up. Among them, there were seven Inborn experts. They immediately released horrifying aura and glowered at the ten assassins from the Abyss.

Hu Qingqing felt suffocated as she looked in horror at the ten assassins from the Abyss that were standing around her. She didn’t dare to say a word at this moment.

The two young men standing beside her were petrified. They no longer had the arrogant vibes from before and were on alert.

Pa!

The Sect Leader of the Heavenly Sound Sect caught the book that was thrown towards him and glanced at Wang Xian and his group. He squinted his eyes and coldness gleamed in them.

“Assassins from the Abyss, what are you guys here for!?” asked the Sect Leader of the Heavenly Sound Sect coldly.

“Obviously, to kill someone!”

Wang Xian looked at the Sect Leader of the Heavenly Sound Sect and didn’t attempt to hide his intention at all.

“Presumptuous! You dare to barge into the sacred grounds of the Heavenly Sound Sect to kill? The Abyss is really brazen!”

When an Elder heard Wang Xian’s brazen claims, he picked up the long flute weapon coldly and glowered at Wang Xian and the group. Murderous intent gleamed in his eyes.

“How arrogant and brazen!”

The Sect Leader of the Heavenly Sound Sect turned gloomy. He held the book and asked coldly, “What is this?”

“Take a look and you will know the person we are killing!” replied Wang Xian emotionlessly.

When his voice came through the mask, it became mechanical and cold. This made the surrounding disciples of the Heavenly Sound Sect anxious.

“Ten days ago, two of our disciples accepted a mission and were assassinated by the Dark Conjurers. The Dark Conjurers were naturally acting according to the orders of their employer. Therefore, we, the Abyss, have annihilated the Dark Conjurers and found the mastermind. Now, we are here to kill her!” Wang Xian stared right at the Sect Leader of the Heavenly Sound Sect and spoke emotionlessly.

However, his response made the surrounding disciples gasp.

Finally, they understood why the Abyss had annihilated the Dark Conjurers.

It was to take revenge against the Dark Conjurers for killing two of their disciples.

To find the mastermind, they had annihilated the Dark Conjurers.

Domineering, horrifying and unable to assess with common sense.

The Sect Leader of the Heavenly Sound Sect could feel his eyebrow twitch. Clearly, he found this answer too shocking and chilling. The Abyss was too domineering and brazen.

The remaining Inborn experts of the Heavenly Sound Sect had all picked up their musical instruments and placed them in front of them. They were all prepared to engage in battle with the imperious Abyss instantly if required.

The Sect Leader of the Heavenly Sound Sect looked at the book in his hands. After going through the information in it, his face sank gradually.

The information in the book was printed out. There wasn’t any concrete evidence.

“This couldn’t be considered as evidence and can’t prove anything!” replied the Sect Leader of the Heavenly Sound Sect after looking through the information.

“Our Abyss isn’t interested in falsifying evidence. We are just letting you take a look. We are still going to kill the mastermind!” Wang Xian remarked coldly before turning to Hu Qingqing.

Mo Qinglong, Mo Yuan and the dragonians also turned to Hu Qingqing. Their eyes were filled with killing intent.

“You deserve death for engaging the Dark Conjurers to kill two of our disciples!” Wang Xian stared at Hu Qingqing and remarked coldly. Just as he finished his words, Mo Yuan struck.

Overwhelming killing intent surrounded him. It was so dense that it appeared to have materialized.

Turning his five fingers into claws, he struck towards Hu Qingqing.

At this moment, Hu Qingqing’s face was as white as a sheet. Cold sweat covered her forehead and horror filled her eyes.

She no longer had the same flirtatious looks, arrogance and confidence as before.

When she saw the approaching Mo Yuan, she screamed in horror. “No! Why are you guys killing me?”

“How dare you kill my granddaughter! The Abyss must be courting death!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Murderous intent gleamed in the eyes of the Vice Sect Leader of the Heavenly Sound Sect. Moving his fingers across the zither, demonic aura turned into sharp edges and attacked towards Mo Yuan.

Rumble!

At this moment, Wang Xian waved his arm. A fireball flew towards the Sect Leader of the Heavenly Sound Sect and exploded.

Ka Ka Ka!

The zither broke after a single strike!
