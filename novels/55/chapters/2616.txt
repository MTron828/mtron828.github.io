2617 Under the 2617 Frost Goddess

“Kill Kill Kill!”

“Howl Howl Howl!”

Within the vast abyss, countless people were fighting, as far as the eye could see!

The thousands of planets in the north, over 10 billion cultivators were guarding the entrance of the Abyss, preventing the Abyss from expanding!

In front of a planet of the bei Chuan sect, bei Shuang and elder Gong were suppressing an undying level 7 abyss seed and fighting!

Compared to other places, the pressure here was much less!

Bei Shuang’s first move had killed over 100 undying level abyss species, reducing the pressure on their side by a lot!

“Elder Gong, I’ll freeze it, kill it!”

5 minutes later, bei Shuang coldly glanced at the frost she had created in space and said to Elder Gong!

“Alright!”

Elder Gong’s eyes gleamed, immediately shouting!

“Ice Crystal, condense!”

Bei Shuang waved her ice claw and the surrounding ice crystals immediately condensed!

“Ka Ka Ka!”

In the next moment, countless ice crystals instantly condensed together, the Undying Level 7 abyss seed in the center panicked, its claws attacking the ice crystals!

However, the ice crystals in the air were clearly prepared by bei Shuang!

The ice crystals gathered together and instantly froze the seed!

“Attack!”

She immediately shouted at Elder Gong!

Elder Gong understood and stabbed his long sword!

“Hua La!”

Wherever the long sword touched, the frozen seed automatically dispersed!

The frozen abyss seed widened its eyes, its eyes filled with fear!

“Pu!”

“Hahahaha, good, good, good!”

Elder Gong’s long sword pierced into the abyss seed, the energy within the long sword stirred, dissipating the abyss seed’s life force!

He couldn’t help but laugh out loud!

“Xiao Shuang, let’s go, we’ll go help the others!”

After taking care of an undying god King Level 7, elder Gong’s eyes were filled with excitement!

He scanned his surroundings, seeing that there weren’t any problems, he immediately flew to the side!

The bei Chuan sect occupied close to 80 planets in the north, all the Warriors and disciples of the sect guarded these 80 planets!

The abyss seeds here were no longer a threat, but the other places were still fighting!

“Alright!”

Bei Shuang nodded, her body moving, she quickly flew behind!

“Elder Gong? Did you guys finish them off so quickly?”

“Hahaha, I’ll show you how strong Xiao Shuang is. Let’s do it!”

Elder gong and bei Shuang flew over. The elder there looked over and said happily!

Elder gong and bei Shuang did not hesitate at all and charged over!

“Hiss, bei Shuang’s strength... how... how can she be so strong!”

“Is that senior bei Shuang? How can she be so strong, almost the same as the Elder!”

“This... this is our senior bei Shuang’s strength?”

Very quickly, when bei Shuang attacked, shock appeared on their faces!

Bei Shuang wasn’t even 40,000 years old, at this age, amongst undyings, it was equivalent to a 100 year old living for 2 to 3 years!

To have undying level 7 battle strength at such a young age, even in the entire resplendent greater world, he was an unbelievable existence!

The battle continued, and bei Shuang’s strength shook the entire Bei Chuan sect!

Her strength was too strong!

Especially the Ice Claw, it was powerful and majestic, filled with terrifying destructive power!

The higher ups were shocked, the disciples were shocked!

The name of the goddess of ice had also landed on bei Shuang’s body!

Her originally exquisite face, Valiant and valiant short hair, and her beautiful figure, coupled with the frost that covered her clothes, truly made her seem like a goddess!

This battle lasted for a full three hours!

Three hours later, an order came from the center of the Northern line, and everyone immediately retreated!

There were many abyss seeds, much stronger than the four factions of the Bei Chuan sect!

...

But they did not need to kill all the abyss seeds, as long as they could not make the abyss expand!

In the three hours of battle, there were countless casualties!

Just the Bei Chuan Sect, an immortal king level powerhouse, had lost more than 20! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

However, some people died, but there were also powerhouses and disciples who rose!

The most dazzling one was bei Shuang!

The heavenly daughter who had once suppressed the Great Cathedral Imperial Court had returned!

She had killed over 100 undying king level abyss seeds, 2 moves had killed 5 Level 5 and 6 undying king level abyss seeds, along with a group of elders killing 5 Level 7 undying king level abyss seeds, shocking everyone!

A Level 7 undying king warrior who had not even lived 40,000 years, the heavenly daughter who had returned!

After this battle, bei Shuang’s name instantly spread throughout the entire Northern line, and on the AI, the news of the heavenly daughter’s return caused countless people to boil!

After all, bei Shuang was as dazzling as a meteor in the entire emperor star field back then, everyone from that era knew of her existence!

And now she had appeared once again, using her undying level 7 strength to shock everyone!

...

“Shuang ER, take these abyss seed crystals and cultivate, don’t be afraid of wasting them!”

On the planet that elder bei Shuang Gong was guarding, the Bei Chuan sect leader smiled as he handed 10 undying level 7 abyss seed crystals to her, his eyes filled with excitement!

“Thank you sect leader, I’ll try my best to level up to undying level 6!”

Bei Shuang didn’t reject, she smiled as she took them. With the abyss seed crystals, her cultivation speed would be much faster!

“Haha, Good, Good!”

The leader of the Bei Chuan sect nodded his head happily. The few ancestors beside him were also smiling!

As long as bei Shuang had the combat strength of an immortal King Level 9, their Bei Chuan sect would become the Bei Chuan sect!

In the next two days, another battle broke out!

Bei Shuang used her powerful strength to make her reputation spread far and wide!

On the artificial intelligence of the Demon Island, the evaluation of the goddess of ice was getting higher and higher!

“It’s right in front of us!”

At this moment, in front of the planets in the Northern line, Wang Xian looked ahead with his eyes shining!

“The abyss here is really terrifying!”

Looking at the right side of the planets, Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a hint of shock!

The entrance to the abyss here could no longer be called an entrance. It was too big!

If the Abyss expanded again, it would be able to devour thousands of life planets!

One could not see the end of it!

In the abyss, many abyssal seeds could be seen flying inside. Their eyes were greedily staring at the world on their side!

“Master is Here!”

At this moment, in a palace on a planet, the AI on Northern Frost’s arm, which was absorbing the crystals of the abyssal seeds, was trembling!

Looking at the information of her master, a smile appeared on her face. She immediately walked out!

“Master!”

She flew out of the Northern line and soon, she saw a familiar figure. Her face lit up and she immediately flew over to Shout!

“Yes!”

Wang Xian saw bei Shuang and smiled. “Not bad, your strength has increased by another level!”
