3667 3666 driftwood winged birds

Buzz

Wu Sha began to set up the formation. Wang Xian flapped his wings and stood guard in the surroundings!

In front of them was a group of driftwood winged birds. Although their strength was strong, their own strength was only at the level of a level two overlord of the universe!

This strength was not very strong for Wang Xian. In fact, these driftwood winged birds would not be able to sense him even if he walked around the territory of the driftwood winged birds!

Time passed by minute by minute. Wu Sha was setting up spell formations one by one!

The setting up of powerful spell formations required an extremely long time. Some spell formations even required powerful materials. It was impossible to complete without materials!

Wu Sha’s Nest and her cabin in the forest were built by her after billions of years. Only then did she have the strength to fight against four to five experts of the same level.

Under normal circumstances, it would be difficult for a single Magus to set up a formation for a few days to deal with two experts of the same level!

However, it was enough to deal with these floating woodwing birds!

“Dragon King has completed two trapping formations and five killing formations!”

Four days later, Wu Sha said to Wang Xian!

“Alright, Wait Here!”

Wang Xian heard her words and nodded. His body moved and he immediately flew into the territory of the floating woodwing birds!

His speed was very fast. In the blink of an eye, he had arrived in the territory!

Unlike the surrounding forest, the trees in the territory of the floating woodwing bird were even more luxuriant. In fact, the leaves were all connected together, completely covering the top and bottom!

On these trees, there was some energy covering them, which could block Wang Xian’s ability to sense the area below!

Crash

Crack! Crack

Wang Xian flapped his primaless saint wings. The wind and thunder energy gathered on them. He aimed in one direction and launched an attack!

There were many floating wood-winged birds and they were very united. Once they encountered an attack, they would surround and attack in large numbers!

When Wang Xian’s attack landed, it was like a stone stirring up a thousand layers of waves!

Under the cover of the leaves, it was as if countless terrifying existences were awakened.

“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”

“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”

“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”

In an instant, an unusually ear-piercing sound was heard. The terrifying sound was visible to the naked eye as it condensed into waves in the void and headed towards Wang Xian!

“Huh?”

Sensing the waves, Wang Xian’s eyes focused. The tai chi dragon plate immediately floated around him!

The five elements millstone was suspended in the air. Waves of energy were protecting him!

At the same time, the inceptive sacred wings were flapping vigorously!

“What a powerful sound wave! What a terrifying attack!”

Wang Xian stared in front of him with a face full of shock!

The thousands of floating wood-winged birds were releasing this strange sound wave attack at the same time. The sound waves were completely fused together. It was equivalent to all the attacks of the floating wood-winged birds being stacked together!

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The sound wave attack came over. The defense of the outermost layer of the earth element began to distort and collapse. It continued to come towards Wang Xian’s details!

The wind element energy of the primaless saint wings resisted it, but it still managed to defeat it!

Finally, it landed on the Tai Chi Dragon Plate, causing the Tai Chi diagram of the tai chi dragon plate to slightly distort!

However, the sudden attack of the large number of floating wood-winged birds was blocked by Wang Xian!

“No Wonder Wu Sha didn’t dare to provoke these guys. If I don’t have sufficient strength to protect myself from this sudden attack, I will definitely die!”

Wang Xian stared ahead. After thousands of floating wood-winged birds attacked him, they crawled out from under the trees below!

They were green in color and had wings that looked like a fan. Their dark green eyes stared at Wang Xian as they attacked him in unison!

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

One by one, the wooden-winged birds let out a sharp cry. The trees and leaves below Wang Xian seemed to have come alive as they attacked him directly!

“Huala!”

Wang Xian looked down. He flapped his incipient saint wings and easily dodged the attacks!

“Roar Roar!”

He moved his body and immediately transformed into the body of a divine dragon, displaying the dragon body of a true dragon!

The body of a true dragon, the Fire Divine Dragon!

“Roar! Roar!”

He let out a furious roar and the flames engulfed the area below!

At the same time, Wang Xian brought along the terrifying flames and flapped his wings. His gaze was fixed on the dozens of floating wooden-winged birds that were closest to him!

“Roar! Roar!”

With a terrifying speed, he arrived above the dozens of floating wooden-winged birds in an instant. The Flames descended instantly!

“Chirp!”

A miserable shriek was heard. The dozens of wooden-winged birds were instantly killed by Wang Xian!

“Chirp! Chirp! Chirp!”

“Chirp! Chirp! Chirp! Chirp!”

However, the death of dozens of their comrades had instead provoked the anger of the entire flock of wooden-winged birds. Sharp and furious shrieks were heard!

This sound caused a huge disturbance to Wang Xian!

“Humph!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Wang Xian snorted softly. The tai chi dragon coiled around him to protect his body. He was moving swiftly in the air!

His powerful speed prevented the sound wave attacks from focusing on his body!

“Whoosh!”

“Eight Dragon Pillars!”

Wang Xian let out a low growl. Dragon pillars appeared in eight different directions instantly. A divine dragon was coiled around the dragon pillars!

“Boom!”

“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”

On top of each Dragon Pillar, the Divine Dragons launched their attacks one after another!

However, at the position below, nearly five thousand floating wooden-winged birds flew out!

They gathered together and spread their wings!

At the ground below, countless leaves floated up. They were shimmering with radiance as they returned fire at the eight-sided Dragon Pillar!

Bang! Bang! Bang

A loud sound of collision was heard. Countless leaves smashed the eight-sided dragon pillar and covered Wang Xian!

Buzz

Wang Xian moved his palm and the five-elemental millstone spun. It formed streams of destructive aura that attacked a certain area!

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”

The five thousand floating wooden-winged birds seemed to have sensed the threat of the five elements millstone and let out a shrill cry once again.

The trees flew up from the void and turned into treemen as if they had life. They met the attacks of the five elements Millstone head-on!

“Crash!”

Wang Xian took advantage of this opportunity and flapped his incipient saint wings. His powerful speed once again displayed a huge advantage!

In an instant, he arrived at the side of more than a hundred floating woodwings. His dragon claws covered them!

Boom

CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP

The terrifying dragon claws covered them, causing more than a hundred floating woodwings to let out terrified screams!

The powerful force instantly killed them!

CHIRP CHIRP

The rest of the floating woodwings swept over. Their pupils were slightly red. Their wings had transformed into tree branches!

The wings of the wooden-winged birds grew longer and intertwined together, forming a terrifying whip that swept towards Wang Xian!

Boom

The terrifying strike caused Wang Xian to dodge to the side in a hurry!

Chirp! Chirp

The remaining two thousand wooden-winged birds immediately flew into the sky and spread their wings!

Their wings were like a huge web that was intertwined together. They flew towards Wang Xian!

“This joint attack is a little abnormal!”
