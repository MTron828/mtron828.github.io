Chapter 1307: 1308 -- the despair of the Prince of the Dragon Dynasty

The thing that Long Xiaotian was most proud of was getting to know Wang Xian, his brother.

Looking at the people in front of him who were more powerful than him, he was not the least bit depressed. On the contrary, he was extremely excited.

Ling Jian ‘er was the daughter of the sect leader of the Heavenly Sword sect. In the future, her position could not even be compared to some princes of the bloodshed empire.

Now, Ling Jian ‘er was pursuing Wang Xian. No, she had been rejected twice for pursuing Wang Xian.

Dog Licking?

Although this term was inappropriate, he was naturally very happy that the woman pursuing his brother was awesome.

Not to mention he yuan.

Although he didn’t know he Yuan’s true background and he Yuan’s attitude towards him wasn’t as warm as when he was with Wang Xian, this was enough.

Because he was Wang Xian’s brother!

Wang Xian had once said that he would help him obtain the throne.

With his words, it was enough!

Long Xiaotian was laughing foolishly. At the side, his brothers looked extremely embarrassed!

The few of them sat at a table with embarrassed expressions. Their expressions kept changing.

“How is this possible? This... how is this possible? How did he know so many people with powerful backgrounds!”

Long Xiaochen and the others’expressions kept changing, and they all looked extremely embarrassed.

He had originally wanted to use all sorts of methods to get rid of that young man, but he didn’t expect that the other party had a force that was even more powerful than them.

In fact, it was an existence that they looked up to.

If he killed shopkeeper Qian without the slightest scruple, could he also kill them without the slightest scruple.

Especially the forty-second prince. His forehead was covered in cold sweat.

He was the one who arranged the seduction incident. Now, he was afraid that he would have to pay a heavy price after everything was exposed.

“It’s okay. There’s no need to be afraid. That Wang Xian is second brother’s friend. Second Brother will not let him attack us. Otherwise, father will have a problem with him!”

The sixteenth prince looked at his brothers with a gloomy face and said with a twinkle in his eyes.

“That’s right. He has a good relationship with second brother. He won’t do anything harmful to us. Furthermore, all of our subordinates are outside the Heavenly Sword Sect’s Island. Now, second brother’s influence is still not our match. We don’t have to be afraid!”

As Long Xiaochen spoke, his eyes revealed a helpless look.

Now, the five of them had to work together to be able to deal with long Xiaotian. What would they do in the future?

When they truly inherited the crown prince’s position and inherited the throne, they would be comparing their individual strength. It wasn’t the time for them to work together.

When that time came, what would they use to compare with long Xiaotian?

This caused their faces to reveal a bitter expression.

“There are still seven months left. It’s a bit too early to give up now. No one knows who will gain the power in the next seven months. HMPH!”

The 36th Prince let out a cold snort, his eyes filled with an intense desire.

“That’s right, there are still seven months left. During this period, I don’t believe that we can not defeat second brother!”

Their eyes were filled with fighting spirit as they slowly raised their wine cups and toasted each other.

There were still seven months left.

“Goddess Ling Jian ‘er, young master Wang, young master he, second prince...”

In the center of the venue, people from various powers walked towards them in an attempt to curry favor with them.

However, other than long Xiaotian’s warm hospitality towards the people around him, he yuan ignored them.

Ling Jian ‘er only nodded her head indifferently and didn’t pay too much attention to them.

“I will be returning to the Heavenly Sword sect tomorrow. Where can I find you in the future?”

Ling Jian ‘er looked at Wang Xian and asked him directly. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Erm... go to the dragon and Phoenix Empire. You will be able to find me there!”

Wang Xian smiled at her.

Ling Jian ‘er nodded her head silently.

“Oh right, brother Wang Xian, I might be returning in a few days. When are you going to the vast region to play? Come and look for me there!”

“The vast area is much bigger than the flowing sea area. It’s also much more fun than here!”

He Yuan, who was at the side, said with a smile.

“I will go to the vast area. In three to five years at most, I will come and look for you!”

Wang Xian smiled and looked at he yuan.

He would go to the vast area. He was not the only one. When the time came, he would bring along the Dragon Palace and the Divine Dragon Clan.

As well as the dragon-phoenix Empire.

When the time came, they would descend to the vast region in a powerful manner.

The few of them chatted for more than an hour.

“HMM?”

At this moment, Long Xiaotian, who was standing at the side, suddenly took out his communication stone plate. When he saw the contents on it, his eyes flickered.

He looked at Wang Xian, who was chatting with Zhang Fengying. After a moment of hesitation, he walked over.

“Brother Wang Xian, I’ve received news!”

As Long Xiaotian spoke, he handed over the communication stone plate in his hand for him to take a look.

“Is it outside? Alright, get your men to prepare. I’ll help you clear all the obstacles today!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

The framing today was definitely done by Long Xiaotian’s brothers.

The assassins from a few days ago were also hired by them.

If Wang Xian didn’t make them experience despair, they would really think that they were easy to bully.

“Alright, I’ll contact them immediately. I’ll give them a big gift today!”

Long Xiaotian’s eyes sparkled as a hint of excitement appeared on his face.

“Fengying, do me a favor!”

Wang Xian looked at Zhang Fengying at the side and asked her to help him get his two ferocious beasts over.

Zhang Fengying nodded her head.

Earlier, Wang Xian had already decided to let her leave the Divine Wind Academy. She hesitated for a moment before agreeing to it.

As for what to do next? Naturally, she would be with Wang Xian and leave this place when the time was right.

Wang Xian gave her a drop of his blood. With Zhang Fengying’s beast taming ability, she could definitely bring Ling Zilin and the rest over.

Zhang Fengying left while Ling Jian ‘er stayed by Wang Xian’s side for two hours. After that, she left and gave a simple greeting to the surrounding forces.

“Brother Wang Xian, my men are ready. My brothers are leaving!”

Night had arrived. Long Xiaotian walked to his side and said softly.

“Let’s go. Let’s go out with them!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly and walked out.

“Alright, let’s Go!”

He Yuan had already left ahead of time. There were also some people who left in the entire venue.

Wang Xian and Long Xiaotian walked out with smiles on their faces.

“Brothers, I advise you to return to the imperial city. You are no match for me!”

Long Xiaotian looked at long Xiaochen and the rest who were walking in front and said provocatively.

“Humph!”

The five princes paused and turned their heads with cold expressions.

“Don’t think that you can be so arrogant with the help of the people around you. Let me tell you, there are still seven months left. It’s uncertain who will win and who will lose!”

“But we can guarantee that you will be very miserable!”
