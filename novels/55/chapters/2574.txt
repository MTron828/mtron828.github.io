2575 2575 was the informant

“Stop! We lured them here!”

“Surround them all!”

Ao Qitian ordered all the members of the Dragon Palace around him with a brutal look in his eyes when he saw that they had taken away some of the corpses of the abyssal seeds!

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh

More than 60 members of the Dragon Palace immediately surrounded them. Among them, more than 20 strange demons were hiding in the void!

“What?”

Seeing the members of the Dragon Palace surrounding them, their faces turned cold!

Clang! Clang! Clang

Everyone immediately took out their weapons and stared at AO qitian and the others with cold faces!

“Leave the prey to us!”

Ao qitian stared at them with murderous intent in his eyes!

“Members of the Dragon Palace?”

An old man at the back glanced at them and raised his eyebrows!

“Dragon Palace?”

The old man in the lead narrowed his eyes, “We chased after this abyssal seed. You should have given us the corpses of the abyssal seed!”

“Nonsense, we attracted it with our blood. I’m warning you, give us the other corpses immediately. Otherwise, don’t blame us for being impolite!”

Ao Qitian slightly clenched his fist and stared at them coldly!

“Impolite? Humph, do you think our Sky Mountain Sword sect will be afraid of You?”

The old man in the lead had a cold look in his eyes, “I’m Warning You Dragon Palace, it’s best not to make enemies with our Sky Mountain Sword sect, or else you’ll make too many enemies and people will die!”

“I just want to ask you, hand it over, or Not!”

Ao Qitian asked with a furious look!

“So What? Do you think you can keep us here? Hehe, as long as any of our disciples are injured, Your Dragon Palace will wait for our Sky Mountain Sword Sect’s Revenge!”

The old man said with a disdainful look!

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

Just as the old man finished speaking, the figures in the surroundings flew toward them with a terrifying aura!

“Eh?”

The expressions of the people from the Sky Mountain Sword sect changed slightly. They immediately looked to their left and right!

“Oh no, it’s the other experts from the Dragon Palace!”

The expression of a middle-aged man changed slightly!

“Someone is looking for trouble?”

At the same time, at a location not far away, Wang Xian sensed the signal from AO qitian. He raised his eyebrows slightly!

His body moved and he flew over at a terrifying speed!

Wang Xian had warned ao Qitian and the rest in advance to inform them immediately if they encountered any enemies!

Buzz

Wang Xian was not too far away from Ao Qitian and the rest. When he flew over, he immediately saw ao Qitian and the rest surrounding the group!

Ao he and the rest also led people to surround them!

“Oh no, Elder, the Dragon King from the Dragon Palace is here too!”

The experts from the Tianshan Sword sect who were surrounded saw more and more members of the Dragon Palace surrounding them. When they saw the Dragon King flying over, their expressions changed drastically! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The leader of the elders also had an ugly expression on his face!

“Put away your weapons!”

He immediately said to the people beside him!

The strength of the Dragon King was not something they could contend against!

“What’s going on?”

Wang Xian looked at the people who were surrounded. He raised his eyebrows slightly and asked ao qitian!

“Dragon King, they are snatching our prey!”

Ao Qitian immediately said!

“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, I am an elder of the Sky Mountain Sword sect. We are pursuing a group of abyss seeds and were killed by your subordinates. Just tell them that the prey belongs to you!”

The elder of the Sky Mountain Sword sect cupped his hands at Wang Xian and introduced himself!

“We lured the abyss seeds here with our fresh blood. Bring out the prey!”

Wang Xian heard their words and spoke directly!

The people of the Sky Mountain Sword sect were not weak. There was a level 6 immortal King!

The prey that was chasing after them with such strength was instantly killed by AO Qitian and the rest. It was obvious that they were not strong!

Furthermore, this abyssal seed was obviously attracted by the dragon blood!

...

“Dragon King, this is the prey of our Tianshan Sword sect!”

The elder of Tianshan Sword Sect’s face darkened. He emphasized the words ‘Tianshan Sword sect’!

Clearly, he wanted to use his power to oppress them!

“No one can take away the prey of our dragon palace, not even your Tianshan Sword sect!”

Wang Xian looked at them with a hint of disdain in his eyes!

When Wang Xian stepped onto the commercial planet of the Tianshan Sword sect, the other party rejected him directly!

Obviously, he wanted to give face to the Tianshan Sword sect?

What a joke!

“You...”

Everyone from the Tianshan Sword sect had an unsightly expression!

“Here, let’s Go!”

...

The elder of the Tianshan Sword sect gritted his teeth and threw out the corpse of the abyssal seed. He growled with an unsightly expression!

Ao Qitian immediately took the corpse of the abyssal seed!

Wang Xian looked at their figures and showed a hesitant expression. In the end, he did not choose to make a move!

If he made a move, Wang Xian was confident that he could keep the other party here. However, there was no need for that. There was no great enmity, and he would not kill the other party for no reason!

“Damn it, that Dragon King did not give any face to our Tianshan Sword sect at all. We were the ones who saw those abyssal seeds first!”

“He doesn’t put our Sky Mountain Sword sect in his eyes at all!”

After flying for tens of millions of kilometers, an elder of the Sky Mountain Sword sect growled in a low voice with a gloomy expression!

“That’s right, Elder. This Dragon Palace doesn’t give any face at all. Let’s join forces with the ninth-grade sky sect to kill this arrogant guy!”

Another middle-aged man with a bad temper suggested!

“Alright, don’t say such useless words!”

The Sky Mountain Sword Sect Elder’s expression was dark too!

He didn’t expect the Dragon King to actually not put them in his eyes at all!

However, it was completely impossible to start a war with the Dragon Palace over the corpses of a few abyss seeds!

“There are hundreds of abyss seeds, over a dozen undying emperor level ones, we’ve only managed to harvest a dozen over this period of time, and only one undying emperor level!”

The few elders beside grumbled, obviously unwilling to accept this!

However, the Dragon Palace’s strength was too strong, if they weren’t strong, they would definitely dare to attack!

“Let’s go, we’ll go to another place and see if we can kill some undying emperor abyss seeds!”

The Sky Mountain Sword sect elder said with a solemn expression, flying in a direction!

“Elder, there are people over there, should we hide for a while!”

They didn’t fly for long. When they saw a group of more than 300 people not far away, an elder said in a low voice!

In the Abyss, one must be careful when encountering other people!

Because they couldn’t directly escape back to the divine kingdom, there were a lot of fights between humans in the Abyss!

There were even people who deliberately set up an ambush to snatch other people’s spoils of war!

“Eh? It seems to be an acquaintance?”

The Sky Mountain Sword sect elder looked over and his gaze swept past a few elders. He raised his eyebrows!

“Let’s go over!”

Looking at the group of people not far away, his eyes flashed with a luster. He immediately flew over!

The other experts of the Sky Mountain Sword sect were slightly surprised. When they carefully sized up the group of people, their eyes slowly lit up!

“Greetings, ninth-grade sky sect’s solitary mountain patriarch. Greetings, ninth-grade Sky sect friends!”

The elder of the Sky Mountain Sword sect flew over and cupped his hands with a smile!
