Translator: 549690339

“Haha, the experts of our immortal sect have come out. Just wait for your death!”

The hundreds of disciples in the array looked around and saw the experts of the immortal sect flying out one after another. Their faces were filled with excitement.

They raised their heads and stared coldly at Mo Qinglong and the others. Their faces were filled with pride.

“A bunch of idiots!”

Mo Yuan’s eyes revealed a trace of disdain. He stretched out his arm and directly became three meters in size.

The terrifying Devil Dragon Claw directly attacked towards the formation.

“Peng!”

The terrifying force caused waves of ripples on the formation. If an infant realm expert wanted to break it, it would at least take a few minutes.

Even if more than ten infant realm experts attacked at the same time, they would be able to hold on for more than ten seconds.

“You still dare to be arrogant? Just wait to be slaughtered by the experts of our immortal sect!”

A young man’s expression was slightly malevolent as he stared at Devil Abyss and said coldly.

“What?”

“What’s going on?”

However, at this moment, the terrified and shocked voices of his companions came from beside him.

“Peng Peng Peng!”

At the same time, the sound of heavy objects falling onto the ground was heard.

The young man turned his head around with a face full of shock, and was instantly dumbstruck.

Those peak experts of their immortal sect, terrifying existences at the infant stage, had actually landed heavily on the road.

Their bodies had already lost their vitality, and had already become corpses.

Corpses!

This caused everyone’s faces to reveal an expression of shock, and their eyes were wide open as they stared at the corpses on the ground in disbelief.

Fifty corpses were thrown neatly in the middle of the road. Their eyes were wide open as if they were filled with disbelief.

“No, this is impossible, this is impossible!”

“Elder, elder and deacon, how could this be? How could this be!”

They felt as if their scalps had exploded and their eyes were filled with fear.

Fifty infant realm experts, the most powerful existences in their immortal sect.

Yesterday, a group of deacons and elders had been lying in ambush in the surroundings, waiting for the Dragon Gate to appear.

Each infant realm expert lay in ambush at a distance of only 500 meters.

Fifty infant realm experts lay in ambush on both sides of the road. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that an area of 10 kilometers was within their control.

To the infant realm experts, they could clearly see even a mosquito.

However, the fifty infant realm experts who were lying in ambush were actually turned into corpses.

When were they killed?

They didn’t know!

They also didn’t know when they died!

However, looking at their fresh blood, they definitely hadn’t died long ago!

Just died not long ago? There were immortal gods watching this place in the sacred city. In other words, there were absolutely no immortal God level experts participating.

Without the immortal gods taking action, they actually killed fifty of their infant stage experts without anyone noticing. How terrifying was this.

“Come, continue to shout arrogantly!”

Mo Yuan looked at the over a hundred disciples of the two great immortal sects in the formation and stared at them with a face full of ridicule.

“You guys... No, no, I don’t believe it!”

The hundreds of disciples inside the formation still couldn’t believe what they were seeing. Their bodies were trembling.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

At this moment, terrifying attacks came one after another. Ripples appeared on the formation.

Soon, cracks appeared on it.

“What’s going on?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The disciples of the immortal sects who were watching the show widened their eyes and couldn’t help but exclaim.

The situation just now was obviously a trap set by the two immortal sects of the Holy Medicine and holy medicine, waiting for the arrival of the Dragon Gate.

If the powerhouses of the Dragon Gate came, they would be directly ambushed and killed. If they didn’t come, they could also kill the spirit of the Dragon Gate.

It was the best of both worlds.

However, the corpses that were thrown out one by one.

At the beginning, they were like the disciples of the two great immortal sects. They thought that the experts of the ambush were going to make a move, and then...

Then, the experts of the two great immortal sects who flew over in strange postures actually landed heavily on the ground. They were just corpses.

The experts of the Holy Medicine and Holy Medicine Immortal sect who were ambushed in the surroundings were actually killed. Moreover, there were a total of 50 infant realm experts.

This was the 50th place!

The Immortal sect that was ranked in the bottom 10 didn’t even have 50 infant realm experts. Yet, today, 50 of them died in one go!

This was too terrifying.

The Saint Medicine Immortal sect lost 50 infant realm experts. Moreover, they were ambushed in advance. This was simply a complete defeat!

“Ka Ka Ka!”

Right at this moment, the sound of the formation breaking could be heard. Along with the Sounds of terror, despair, and trembling, more than 100 disciples of the two great immortal sects could be heard.

The spectators behind them pursed their lips and widened their eyes.

Just a moment ago, these hundred or so people were arrogantly shouting for the people of the Dragon Gate to come and kill this young master. Now, it had come true.

“How can this be?”

In the sacred city, the elders and deacons of the Holy Medicine and Holy Medicine Immortal sect stared with wide eyes. Their eyes were about to pop out of their sockets as they stared at Cheng Waii in disbelief.

Just now, when they were about to fly over to support Cheng Waii, they discovered that the experts of their immortal sect had already turned into corpses.

At that moment, their bodies trembled a little.

They knew better than anyone else how secretive and safe the experts lying in ambush around were.

As long as one person was attacked, everyone else would be able to discover it immediately.

However, they were actually killed, which made them feel terrified.

The death of fifty infant realm experts would directly cause them to lose forty percent of their strength.

“Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal Sect, you dare to destroy our Dragon Gate forging workshop and kill our Dragon Gate members. Our Dragon King said that only one of us will survive. Now, you can wait to Die!”

Mo Qinglong waved his arm, and wisps of demonic qi directly controlled over 100 disciples of the two immortal sects.

Wisps of demonic qi bound their necks and suspended them in the air.

He slowly walked toward the holy city of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect. With a wave of his other hand, the bodies of the fifty infant realm experts on the road were also directly controlled into the sky.

“Save me, Elder, save us!”

“Save us, we don’t want to Die!”

More than a hundred young disciples had terrified expressions on their faces as they shouted loudly.

“Dragon Gate, all of you deserve to die!”

On the city wall, a group of fifty to sixty infant realm experts from the two great immortal gates were floating in the air. Their eyes were blood red as they roared loudly.

They stared at the corpse that was floating in the air and clenched their fists tightly.

But now, they didn’t dare to go out. They really didn’t dare to rashly charge out.

Fifty infant realm experts were directly killed, causing them to feel a chill down their spines.

“Haha, we’ve said before that this is only the beginning. Just you wait, the end result of provoking our dragon gate will be destruction!”

Mo Qinglong and the group of Drakonids fearlessly arrived a thousand meters away from the city gate and arrogantly laughed out loud.
