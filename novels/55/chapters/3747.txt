3748 3747 had a breakthrough! A breakthrough! Go

“It’s stable!”

Wang Xian was immersed in the center of the heart of fire treasure land. His eyes were filled with excitement!

He had fooled the group of Space Beasts with this method.

“Although this thing that Lin Wenluo has researched is of little value, I didn’t expect it to have such a huge effect!”

Wang Xian was a little excited.

Once this beast skin erupted with energy, the space beasts of the same race would notice that you weren’t of the same race.

However, the situation now was different.

The space beasts he simulated were located in the distance. The Space Beasts here were afraid of the Space Beasts’influence that he simulated, so they did not dare to attack him.

This allowed him to cultivate in peace here.

Wang Xian smiled. With a thought, he sank to the deepest part of the heart of fire treasure ground and started cultivating quietly.

Ever since Wang Xian obtained the system, he had been using resources to achieve breakthroughs and rarely cultivated on his own.

However, today, he felt that he could cultivate properly.

The energy here was too dense.

It was so dense that he seemed to be devouring medicinal pills at all times.

The fire attribute energy entered his body and transformed into Dragon Qi. The Dragon Qi strengthened his body and energy.

The Dragon Qi in Wang Xian’s body was increasing at a terrifying speed.

Due to the birth of a ruler-level existence in the surroundings of the hotheart treasured land, as long as one did not step into the heart of the hotheart treasured land, there would not be any attacks from the space beasts. This caused more and more experts to arrive.

The Phoenix Clan’s fire Phoenix, the Divine Tiger Clan’s fire tiger, the demon clan’s fire demon, the skeleton clan’s fire skeleton, and so on.

After the group of experts arrived, they began to cultivate on the flaming planets.

They would look at the center of the fiery heart land from time to time, their eyes filled with fervor and helplessness!

“The center of the fiery heart land is comparable to the fiery nirvana land of the Phoenix clan. However, the fiery nirvana land of the Phoenix clan only has some energy reserves at the moment

“If we can enter the center of the flame heart land to cultivate, we will have a chance to raise two or three levels. Unfortunately, the energy of the Flame Heart Land is dozens of times more than the peak of the Flame Nirvana Land, right?”

“Almost. Although those space beasts have always been in the center of the Flame Heart Land, because they don’t only have the fire attribute, they don’t absorb much of the fire energy. Perhaps their absorption ability is not as good as the Fire Phoenix at the venerable level. Sigh, unfortunately, we can’t enter!”

Outside the heart of the fire treasure ground, the fire Phoenix experts spoke with great regret.

If they could enter, they were confident that they could soar into the sky!

It wasn’t just them. The other fire attribute experts were the same.

However, they couldn’t enter!

The space beasts inside were too terrifying!

No one expected that Wang Xian had already entered to cultivate.

Time passed day by day. There was no sun or moon in his cultivation. Ten thousand years passed in the blink of an eye.

Wang Xian sat in the center of the heart of the fire treasure ground and absorbed the power of the flames crazily.

The Dragon Qi in his body was also increasing at a terrifying speed.

Buzz

On this day, he felt the energy in his body once. He hurriedly restrained the sudden burst of energy.

“Ding, congratulations to host for raising your level and breaking through to the level 9 of a universe Knight.”

Suppressing the burst of energy, the system’s voice entered Wang Xian’s mind.

He tried his best to suppress it. Fortunately, the energy did not spread out and attracted the attention of the surrounding space beasts.

Wang Xian opened his eyes and smiled.

The speed was several times faster than he expected.

He thought that he would need tens of thousands of years to break through. He did not expect that he would break through in just 10,000 years.

After breaking through, Wang Xian would have the ability to fight against the level one space beasts.

In other words, Wang Xian could also fight against the level four masters of the peak race.

In fact, he was much stronger than them. Coupled with the five elements grinding, he could easily kill him.

Currently, for the powerhouses from the nine-origin universe who had entered the starry universe, Wang Xian’s strength was already at the peak!

After all, there were no top-notch masters among the powerhouses from the peak races who had entered the starry universe.

“Continue to improve, at least one more level, so that I can truly step into the realm of a master. Once I cross the peak of the venerable realm and reach the realm of a master, then I will be able to have the strength equivalent to a level six master.”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with excitement.

Furthermore, he realized that there were no shackles for him to advance from level nine of the venerable realm to the ruler of level one.

In other words, as long as he had sufficient resources, he would be able to break through directly.

After breaking through, his strength would be equivalent to a ruler of level six!

His combat strength at this level was already extremely terrifying!

“Continue to cultivate and strive to improve once more!”

Wang Xian mumbled as a smile appeared on his face. He swept his gaze across the surroundings and continued to cultivate.

Time passed day by day and tens of thousands of years had passed.

The Starry Universe was bustling with activity due to the entry of the disciples of the powerhouses from the nine-origin universe.

More and more powerhouses entered.

However, ten thousand years later, a piece of news suddenly shocked all the powerhouses from the peak races in the nine-origin universe.

Not long after the opening of the nine-origin universe, all the top-tier masters of the top-tier races had entered the starry universe, and now, all of them were dead.

The disciples of the Masters in the starry universe had all received this news.

Because, the great being of the angel race, the eldest son of the Radiant Angel King, was chased by a terrifying space beast to the front of the entrance.

That terrifying power caused all the great being disciples who had just entered the starry universe and were near the entrance to die instantly.

They were crushed to death by that terrifying space beast energy!

This matter instantly caused the entire 9-origin universe to explode.

Within the communication stone plate, this news spread like wildfire, and all the great being disciples were discussing it.

After that, a pinnacle race revealed that the 12 pinnacle races had sent 12 universe master level 8 warriors, and they were all killed.
