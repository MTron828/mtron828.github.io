Chapter 2918: asked the Dragon Palace for help 4

“Serves him right. This kid deserves a beating!”

“Well played. This guy is too arrogant. He actually called us glazed soldiers trash in the brain of our glazed domain. I want to beat him up!”

“I want to too, but this kid has too many trump cards. Not to mention other things, he has a treasure that can resist the attacks of divine emperors!”

“Is the Dragon Palace really that strong?”? “Although their rise is very fast, our Veluriyam Capital’s foundation is so deep. Moreover, the Dragon Palace only has more than twenty God emperors. If it weren’t for our domain Lord and a group of experts guarding the border of the Machine Imperial region, we definitely wouldn’t have lost!”

“The Dragon Palace might not be as strong as us. That invincible battle technique has a good relationship with the Dragon King, which is why we have so many treasures. However, our Veluriyam capital also has a lot of supreme treasures. In the last battle, we directly took out five or six of them.”

“There are more than twenty divine emperors in the Dragon Palace. Our entire glazed domain has more than the Dragon Palace. However, the dragon palace is not much weaker than us. They have the legendary Divine Dragon.”

Hearing the screams of invincible fighter and seeing him being taken away by the deputy regimental commander, the soldiers on the fighting ring laughed at his misfortune and began to discuss.

Being provoked by invincible battle technique, they were also curious about how strong the Dragon Palace was and whether it could be comparable to their glazed domain.

However, as the soldiers of glazed domain, according to their understanding, they still thought that they were stronger.

Their own side’s foundation was also deeper.

“Grand Supreme First Elder, I’ve brought this bad disciple here.”

At the same time, in the meeting room in the center of the fighting ring, Shangshui Divine Emperor walked in with invincible battle technique and said.

“Cough cough, cough cough!”

Invincible battle technique was released. He coughed and swept his gaze across the divine emperors in front of him.

“Junior invincible battle technique greets seniors.”

He bowed and hurriedly said.

Invincible battle technique knew his limits when facing divine emperor experts.

“Hehe, Invincible, right? This time, our Liu Li has to thank you properly. Killing two divine emperors was to reduce our great trouble.”

The first Supreme Elder said with a smile and gestured for the Divine Emperor and invincible battle technique to sit down.

“Hehe, no need to thank me. Just kill me, just kill me!”

Invincible battle technique pursed his lips and sat down with a smile.

The faces of the surrounding divine emperors turned black. This kid was really shameless.

“Invincible, I called you here because I have a favor to ask of you.”

The divine emperor of Shangshui patted Wudi’s shoulder.

“Master, what favor do you want me to do? If I can do it, I will definitely go to hell!”

Wudi raised his head slightly and said righteously.

“Cut the crap. This matter concerns the fate of the glazed domain. You should know a little about the current situation in the glazed domain. We, the glazed domain, want to seek help from other forces.”

“In the bright starry sky, besides us, the strongest force is the Dragon Palace. We want to seek help from the Dragon Palace.”

Shangshui divine emperor said.

“Of course, if we ask the Dragon Palace to send experts to help us, the glazed domain will pay enough compensation. Invincible, I heard from your master that you have a good relationship with the Dragon King and can contact him. So, we called you here to ask you for a favor and ask for help from the glazed domain.”

“This is the list of treasures that our glazed domain has taken out. We are willing to pay these resources to ask the Dragon Palace to help us through this difficult time.”

“In addition, the Dragon Palace can also offer conditions or exchange for other treasures. We can consider it.”

“Invincible, this matter concerns the life and death of our glazed domain. I will trouble invincible on behalf of the glazed domain.”

The first Supreme Elder took over the words of the divine emperor of Shangshui. He stood up and passed a list to Wudi of battle tactics.

At the same time, he bowed deeply to Wudi of battle tactics.

“Ahem, first Supreme Elder, you don’t have to be so polite. I can contact the Dragon King about this, but I can’t decide on the specific situation.”

When Wudi of battle tactics saw the first supreme elder stand up, he was also shocked. He stood up and quickly said.

He knew that the first supreme elder of the glazed tile region was a second level divine emperor.

He was one of the peak experts in the entire glazed tile region.

“The situation is a little urgent now. If we were given enough time, we wouldn’t be able to contact you through invincible.”

“The current situation is very unfavorable for our glazed tile region. We have no choice but to think of a way to contact the dragon palace as soon as possible.”

The first Supreme Elder said faintly.

The current situation was indeed very urgent. They had to be prepared to get a response from the dragon palace as soon as possible.

Whether they agreed or refused, they had to be prepared in advance.

“First Supreme Elder, I can contact boss Wang Now. There should be no problem. I talked to him not long ago!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Invincible battle technique nodded immediately.

He could also sense the danger in the glazed domain.

Even the celestial emperor might fall. One could imagine the situation.

However, when he looked at the list of resources in front of him, his heart skipped a beat!

This amount of resources was really terrifying!

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

Invincible battle technique clicked his tongue slightly. He took out the communication stone plate and prepared to talk to Wang Xian.

At this moment, Wang Xian was sitting in the imperial study room of the Dragon Palace. He had just received a message from the governor of the Holy Region.

The Governor of the Holy Region sent a message. The governor of the glazed region had contacted him. He wanted the holy region to lend a helping hand to help them through this crisis.

The holy region did not reply to him for the time being.

The message from the Governor of the holy region also said that the glazed region might request for assistance from the Dragon Palace.

He was a little surprised when he saw this message.

He didn’t expect the situation in the glazed area to be so terrible that the glazed area lord had to ask for help personally.

“That kid who is invincible in combat said yesterday that he killed many demons and monsters. It seems that this kid is bragging.”

Wang Xian mumbled.

The Saint Domain Lord sent him a message mainly to see what the Dragon Palace wanted.

If the glazed domain found the Dragon Palace and the Dragon Palace was willing to help, they might agree.

If the Dragon Palace didn’t agree to help, they would also refuse.

After all, the glazed domain was several times stronger than their holy region. If they were to fall into it, the holy region would be in big trouble.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

Just as Wang Xian was thinking, the communication stone plate at the side trembled.

“Eh? Invincible in combat?”

Wang Xian took a look at the message and opened it.

“Wow, boss Wang, you’re so handsome today!”

Just as he opened the video, he heard the exaggerated voice of invincible in combat.

This made his face darken slightly.

“Spit it out!”

He said directly without saying a word.

“Hehe, boss Wang, there’s something important, and it’s a big one. However, this is related to the glazed domain.”

“Boss Wang, the seniors of glazed area want me to contact you and ask for the support of the Dragon Palace!”

Invincible said with a smile.
