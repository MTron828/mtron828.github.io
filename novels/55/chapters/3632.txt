3633 Under the improvement of the 3632 Dragon Palace

Greetings to the Dragon King, greetings to the King!

At this moment, they had completely submitted to him!

The Dragon Palace was even more terrifying than they had imagined!

This made them excited and proud!

“Everyone, stand up. Welcome to join our Dragon Palace. In the future, we will be a family. We will share the joys and sorrows, rise to the peak together, and build a glorious future together!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the strong disciples of the ancestral dragon lineage and revealed a satisfied expression on his face.

Among the six million strong disciples of the ancestral dragon lineage, there were dozens of pure-blooded divine dragons. The rest were all of the Divine Dragon lineage!

“Thank you, Dragon King!”

All the strong disciples responded excitedly!

“Now, let’s cross the Dragon Gate and enter!”

Wang Xian instructed with a smile!

After breaking through the Dragon Palace, they would truly become a member of the Dragon Palace. They would respect Wang Xian as their leader!

Wang Xian’s will was their life!

After breaking through the Dragon Gate, they would obey him 100% !

The strong disciples of the ancestral dragon lineage nodded their heads and glanced at the group of top-notch dragon species in the dragon palace with slight respect!

The strong disciples of the ancestral dragon lineage all possessed the bloodline of the Divine Dragon and had stayed in the powerful Dragon King Dragon Palace before. Breaking through the Dragon Gate was an easy task for them!

Wang Xian watched the group of people with the bloodline of the Divine Dragon enter the Dragon Gate with ease and nodded his head slightly!

“Prime Minister Gui, send Hei Yao and the rest to float the dragon palace with nine attributes above the Dragon Palace!”

Seeing the thirteen universe masters with level three combat strength passing through the Dragon Gate, Wang Xian instructed Prime Minister Gui!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded his head with a burning gaze.

Soon, under Prime Minister Gui’s orders, nine masters of the universe dragon palaces floated in the sky above the dragon palaces!

Ding! “Nine elements of metal, wood, water, fire, Earth, light, wind, and thunder have been discovered. Master of the Universe Divine Kingdom, do you wish to devour it?”

At this moment, the system’s voice rang out. Wang Xian immediately agreed in his heart! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Weng!”

Just as he finished his sentence, a terrifying vortex suddenly gushed out from the Dragon Palace below. The vortex seemed to have an endless devouring force as it sucked towards the Metal Element Dragon Palace!

The metal-elemental Dragon Palace couldn’t resist at all as it was being absorbed rapidly!

The entire dragon palace was emitting surging energy!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

A dragon’s roar suddenly sounded as a golden dragon God slowly appeared in the sky above the Dragon Palace!

The Golden Dragon God directly merged into one of the Dragon Pillars of the Dragon Palace!

The metal-elemental Dragon Palace was completely absorbed!

Then, the wood-elemental Dragon Palace was quickly swallowed by the Dragon Palace!

Every time a dragon palace was swallowed, a dragon shadow would appear and merge into the Dragon Pillar of the Dragon Palace!

…

“What… What happened to our Dragon Palace? What a terrifying dragon pressure!”

“Our Dragon Palace is evolving, evolving!”

“Great, Our Dragon Palace is finally evolving again!”

In the Dragon Palace, all the powerful disciples looked up at the sky and watched the changes of the entire Dragon Palace!

The energy of the Dragon Palace became more and more vast!

The dragon pressure also became more and more intense!

One by one, the dragon palaces with different attributes were devoured.

When the last Thunder-type Dragon Palace was absorbed, nine divine dragons soared into the sky from the Dragon Palace below!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The nine divine dragons hovered above the dragon palace, emitting waves of vast elemental energy.

The energy started to sprinkle into the Dragon Palace, making the entire dragon palace sacred, ethereal, and vast!

The nine divine dragons slowly turned into light, and the energy ember landed below!

“Ding, Congratulations host, the Dragon Palace has been upgraded to the innate Dragon Palace!”

As the system improved, Wang Xian checked the attributes in his mind and looked at the Majestic Dragon Palace in front of him. His eyes were filled with excitement.

The Dragon Palace had finally been upgraded again!

After the upgrade, the Dragon Palace was almost at its peak!

It would be extremely difficult to break through again!

Wang Xian looked at the Dragon Palace below and thought of something.

The next moment, the entire Dragon Palace underwent a change. He was expanding and expanding!

Under the control of his mind, it expanded by five times easily!

All the buildings inside were also expanded by five times!

This made the entire dragon palace look even more vast!

This was the biggest change after the upgrade of the Dragon Palace!

This energy was also called change!

Change could be big or small!

The smallest one could reach tens of thousands of kilometers, and the largest one could reach tens of billions of kilometers!

This change was very terrifying!

“Swoosh!”

“Prime Minister Gui, settle the new disciples First!”

He moved and immediately flew into the Dragon King Palace.

When he arrived at the Dragon King Palace, he immediately saw the ancestral tree that had undergone a huge change!

The ancestral tree was ten times larger than before. It was obvious that the improvement this time was very, very big!

The fruit on it was emitting a sparkling luster!
