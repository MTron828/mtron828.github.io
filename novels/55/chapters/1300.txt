Chapter 1301: 1302 was a man that even a goddess couldn’t have

Apart from the sect master of the Heavenly Sword sect using his tyrannical strength to break into the Hanhai dynasty’s imperial city, there was another matter that shocked many people.

Back then, on the day that Ling Jian ‘er was besieged, the heavenly sword sect disciples who didn’t lend a helping hand were all crippled of their cultivation.

This included a very outstanding core disciple of the Heavenly Sword sect who had a great relationship with the sect master of the Heavenly Sword sect.

Now, there were rumors among the heavenly sword sect disciples that the sect master’s breakthrough was because he had broken through the demonic barrier from more than ten years ago.

He had comprehended a powerful guardian dharma idol.

As for who the Guardian Dharma Idol was, everyone was very clear.

The Heavenly Sword sect had once sent twenty profound void martial experts to bring Ling Jian ‘er back, but in the end, she had directly rejected them, not giving them any face at all.

Later on, the sect master of the Heavenly Sword sect had come personally. Some people saw that the first time, he had been directly rejected by Ling Jian ‘ER.

Later on, the sect master of the Heavenly Sword sect used some unknown method to move his daughter, and only then did he bring her back to his side.

The entire heavenly sword sect knew what kind of status Ling Jian ‘ER currently held in the Heavenly Sword sect. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

No one could compare to her.

Looking at the beautiful Ling Jian ‘er walking over, manager Qian’s eyes lit up, revealing a heated expression.

Many of the men around him were the same. If they could get this woman, they would be able to save thousands of years of effort.

To be able to leap to become the top existence in the entire Liuhai region.

“Thank you all for being able to participate in today’s Heavenly Sword Lingyun meet. This time, we are mainly inviting the elite disciples of the younger generation. Of course, there are also experts!”

“Our Sky Sword sect has no other intentions. We just want to announce two things. First, the young miss of Our Sky Sword sect has returned. Second, Ren Xingchen will join our sky sword sect and become a core disciple of the Sky Sword sect!”

Ling Jian ‘er walked to the front and stopped. Beside him, an elder stood by her side and spoke to everyone.

Ling Jian ‘ER, who was standing beside him, did not listen to the old man. Her gaze swept across the entire venue. When she saw Wang Xian, her eyes lit up slightly.

“Visitors are guests. I will go over to thank everyone one by one in a while!”

The old man spoke for more than ten sentences before he ended the conversation.

“Even a powerhouse at level four of the Seethrough void tier of the heavenly sword sect addressed Ling Jian ‘er as miss. This position is too high!”

When everyone on the back mountain of the Heavenly Sword sect heard the old man addressing Ling Jian ‘er, their faces revealed a look of surprise.

A fourth-rank profound void martial expert was already a top-tier expert in the flowing sea region. His status was extremely noble.

Even the kings of some countries only had this level of cultivation.

Even so, for such an expert to address Ling Jian ‘ER as ‘miss’, one could imagine her status in the Heavenly Sword sect.

However, what everyone didn’t know was that Ling Jian ‘er was able to obtain her current status not only because of her father’s unlimited love.

There was also her own strength. Now, the upper echelons of the heavenly sword sect all knew that Ling Jian ‘er had obtained a terrifying opportunity.

In the future, her achievements were very likely to be above that of the sect leader.

“Miss, do you want to get acquainted with some disciples?”

After the old man finished speaking, he asked Ling Jian ‘er in a low voice.

“I’m going to meet a friend!”

Ling Jian ‘er shook her head with a smile on her face as she walked straight ahead.

“Oh?”

The old man was slightly stunned as he thought of the words of the Grand Elder. His eyes flickered and he did not bother about it anymore.

“Goddess Ling Jian ‘er, you are simply too beautiful. Can I treat you to a cup of wine?”

Ling Jian ‘er walked forward. Shopkeeper Qian, who was standing not too far away, had a fiery look in his eyes as he walked over with two cups of wine in his hands.

Some of those who knew shopkeeper Qian had a look of shock on their faces.

However, Ling Jian ‘er acted as though he did not see him as he walked past him.

This caused shopkeeper Qian’s face to instantly freeze up as his expression changed slightly.

Some of the people who noticed this were also slightly stunned. However, they soon started to laugh secretly.

Goddess Ling Jian ‘ER doesn’t know your identity as manager Qian.

Manager Qian took a deep breath and allowed his facial expression to return to normal. He looked at Ling Jian ‘ER’s figure with some displeasure.

“I’m a little late. If I had known earlier, I would have come with brother Wang Xian and Long Xiaotian!”

At this moment, a well-dressed young man who had just entered the island of the Heavenly Sword sect said plainly.

There was a hint of arrogance on his face. This temperament would make many young men feel inferior.

“Young master he, it’s not too late.”

A few insightful emptiness realm experts from the Yan clan said fawningly from the side.

The young man nodded his head indifferently, his gaze unwavering.

This was an innate nobility, not posturing.

“Goddess Ling Jian ‘er, how do you do!”

“Ling Jian ‘er, how do you do!”

In the conference hall at the Back Mountain of the island, Ling Jian ‘er walked in. Many young men looked at her beautiful figure and could not help but greet her.

Ling Jian ‘er nodded her head indifferently, her eyes never leaving the area in front of her.

“Who is Ling Jian ‘er looking for? Ren Xingchen?”

“Ren Xingchen and Ling Jian ‘er seem to have known each other not too long ago. Could it be that they...”

“This... This is really possible. A perfect match, but why is my heart broken!”

“Ah, my goddess!”

Some people saw Ling Jian ‘er walking towards Ren Xingchen without paying any attention to anyone. Their hearts ached as they guessed.

At Ren Xingchen’s side, Ling Jian ‘ER’s appearance made Tang Ling ‘er, Tang Feng, and the others no longer oppose her.

After all, they didn’t come here today to make enemies.

When they saw Ling Jian ‘er walking over, Tang Feng and Tang Yuan’s eyes flashed with astonishment.

Under everyone’s gaze, when everyone thought that Ling Jian ‘er was about to walk to Ren Xingchen’s side, in the end, she directly ignored Ren Xingchen.

Ling Jian ‘er didn’t even glance at Ren Xingchen and continued to take a few steps forward.

In the end, she stayed by Wang Xian’s side.

However, the next moment, everyone widened their eyes.

“How is it? Am I Pretty?”

They saw Ling Jian ‘er standing in front of Wang Xian. She slightly loosened her dress and revealed a happy smile on her face.

Wang Xian stood there and looked at Ling Jian ‘er who was wearing a pink dress. He was filled with surprise.

Ling Jian ‘er walked towards him. He was not surprised at all. After all, this beauty who had a problem with her brain had once confessed to him.

Furthermore, he had rejected her.

However, Ling Jian ‘ER had undergone a huge change compared to the past.

In the past, he was extremely cold. His cold appearance was like a sword.

Now, he was much more open-minded and feminine, especially with this pink dress.

“You are much prettier and more cheerful. However, I don’t want you. You shouldn’t have any other thoughts. I’m a man that you can’t have!”

Wang Xian looked at Ling Jian ‘ER’s expectant gaze and said with a serious expression.

The moment he said that, everyone’s jaws dropped!
