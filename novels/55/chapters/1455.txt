Chapter 1456: 1456 chased after them for 20,000 kilometers and slashed down

“What’s that situation? What a terrifying aura!”

“Blood Emperor? Experts from the blood flow empire? I didn’t even see their shadows!”

“The blood flow Emperor Alliance and the demon beast experts are chasing after the experts from the blood flow empire? What, what is this situation? What happened at the human-demon graveyard!”

“Oh my god, that’s our emperor. The experts of our empire are being chased!”

As both of them were at level six of the Seethrough realm, the difference in their speed was not too great.

Despite the blood emperor and the three blood emperors fleeing for their lives, they were still only able to maintain a distance of more than ten kilometers away from Wang Xian and the rest.

For a level six Seethrough realm expert, this distance of more than ten kilometers would only take about ten seconds.

One chased while the other fled.

Very quickly, they chased for more than an hour.

Along the way, they passed by many cities.

When the people in the cities felt this terrifying aura and heard the sounds that came from time to time, their expressions were extremely shocked.

Especially the cities below the blood flow empire. When they saw the blood emperor and the emperors of the Empire being chased, their eyes widened, filled with disbelief.

“The imperial city of the blood flow empire is right in front. As a seven to eight thousand year old empire, there must be some defensive and offensive means in their nest. We can’t let them enter the Imperial Palace!”

After chasing for almost twenty thousand miles, the Imperial Palace of the blood flow empire appeared in their line of sight.

Feng Luan stared with a frown and hurriedly said.

“Let’s stop them!”

On the left, the leader of the demon Lin clan and a Level 6 demon Lin Beast moved. In their humanoid form, their four limbs landed in the air and transformed into another form.

“Dharma Idol, raging flames roar!”

“Dong Dong Dong!”

They lightly roared as the flames on their bodies shot up into the sky.

The flames that were a thousand meters long were rolling around. Under their limbs, something that looked like firestorm wheels appeared.

“The four people from the blood flow empire want to escape from our pursuit? Wishful Thinking!”

The leader of the demonic scales roared. His body moved and the entire void seemed to be burning.

“Let me lend you a hand!”

Feng Luan stood on Wang Xian’s body and raised the Phoenix staff in her hand.

“Aspect: Phoenix Wings soaring into the sky!”

With a wave of her staff, her wings landed on the two demonic beasts.

“Let us boost your defense!”

The two bloodthirsty sea monsters brandished a weapon that looked like a harpoon. A water-blue light screen surrounded them.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The void roared as they flapped their wings. The speed of the two demonic beasts increased to a terrifying level.

“What’s that sound? !”

“What a terrifying sound. Is there an earthquake?”

The citizens of the blood flow imperial city, who were dozens of kilometers away, felt the terrifying roar coming from the void, and their faces were filled with shock.

“Quick, quick, enter the Imperial Palace!”

The blood emperor sensed the terrifying power coming from behind, and he gritted his teeth and roared loudly.

The other three emperors also flew with their faces flushed red.

“That’s the blood emperor’s voice!”

When the citizens in the blood flow imperial city heard this voice, their eyes widened and they raised their heads to look.

“Don’t even think about escaping!”

“Boom Boom!”

At this moment, the demon Lin Leader’s roar was heard. Following that, a meteorite that seemed to have descended from the sky rushed towards the imperial palace at a terrifying speed.

“What, what is that?”

“What’s going on?”

At this moment, all the people in the bloody flow imperial city were stunned.

“Ah, get lost!”

The blood emperor’s expression changed greatly when he saw the two demonic scales rushing toward them at a speed that was twice as fast as theirs.

The imperial palace was right in front of them, and they had to enter.

The terrifying spear stabbed toward the two demonic scales.

The other three emperors released three terrifying attacks and charged toward them.

Boom! Boom! Boom

A loud explosion sounded from the sky.

In the imperial city, some weak humans spat out blood in shock.

There were even people who died from bleeding from all seven orifices.

How terrifying!

“The emperor of the wildlands wants to kill you. You Must Die!”

After the shockwave of the explosion passed, two demonic scales floated above the imperial palace. They emitted demonic flames and their eyes were filled with killing intent.

The blue light screen and wings around their bodies had completely disappeared, but they were not injured.

They were completely unharmed!

“What?”

The Blood Emperor and the three emperors’expressions changed drastically when they saw that they were floating above the palace and blocking their path.

“Level six void interpretation demonic beasts, they actually barged into our imperial city!”

“Two level six void interpretation demonic beasts, kill them, kill them!”

“We, the Blood Emperor and three emperors, kill two level six demon beasts of the profound void tier...”

...

“Blood Emperor, where are you going to run to?”

In the imperial city, almost half of the citizens spat out blood in the aftermath of the terrifying collision. When they saw the two demon scales, they roared with killing intent.

However, just as they thought of their words, a cold voice came from not far away.

Blood Emperor, where are you going to escape to?

Escape?

In an instant, all the citizens of the blood flow empire were stunned.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

At this moment, they saw four terrifying figures flying over.

A terrifying creature that was seventy meters tall, a bloodthirsty sea demon that contained palpitating energy, and a sect master of the Sky Sword sect that they were familiar with.

“What... What happened... why is our emperor being chased and killed!”

The citizens of the Imperial City were dumbfounded.

“You Want to kill us? Even if we risk our lives, we can still drag one or two of them to die with us!”

An emperor roared with a ferocious expression when he saw Wang Xian and the rest rushing over to surround him.

“Is that so? Let’s give it a try then!”

Wang Xian revealed a cold smile on his face. He moved his body and attacked the blood emperor without any hesitation.

“Leave him to me. I’ll leave the other three to you guys!”

As he spoke, his 70-meter-long body moved and the five elements millstone appeared above his head.

Buzz

The Five Elements Millstone spun and instantly reached an area of three kilometers.

After his strength broke through, the area of the five elements millstone increased once again.

“Yes!”

The other four demonic beasts were delighted when they heard Wang Xian’s words.

If Wang Xian was going against one, they could join forces to fight against one.

“I will fight you to the death. Even if I have to die, I will drag you down with me!”

The Blood Emperor roared ferociously when he saw the five elements millstone in a three-kilometer radius above Wang Xian’s head.

“Let’s try you out. My Strength!”

A cold glint flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes. His dragon claws went straight for the negotiation.

“Ah, I am the Blood Emperor. I will kill all my enemies!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The Blood Emperor roared. He pointed the blood-red spear in his hand and attacked Wang Xian directly.

“Dragonnation in the palm!”

“Five elements great mill, annihilate!”

Wang Xian displayed the second aspect that he had mastered after his breakthrough.

Dragonnation in the palm!

In the surroundings, two demon scales were fighting against one emperor and two bloodthirsty sea monsters against the other.

The last one, sect leader Ling, was fighting alone. However, ao Yao surrounded him and was ready to assassinate him at any moment!

Below, everyone from the blood flow empire was stunned.

“Ah, I can’t accept this. I Can’t believe that I, a rank seven void interpretation expert, died here!”

Suddenly, an endless voice sounded from within the 20,000-kilometer-long human-demon graveyard!

The voice echoed within tens of thousands of kilometers!
