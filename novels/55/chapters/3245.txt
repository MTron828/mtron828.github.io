3246 In the 3245 Dragon War

“Can we do it now?”

Wang Xian sat in the Dragon Palace and looked at Prime Minister Gui’s report. A smile appeared on his face.

“There is already a universe knight level 5 being parasitized by the Ba Qi. According to the information from the Ba Qi, there is another universe Knight Level 5 being hidden by the horned seal race. There are a total of seven of them.”

“He is confident that he can kill two universe knights of the same level the moment the war breaks out.”

Prime Minister Gui said with a smile.

“That means there are still four universe knight level 5 beings, Tian Cheng, Xiao Lan, and Ao Jin. It will be easy for them to deal with the other four. To be on the safe side, I will go too.”

Wang Xian pondered for a moment and said.

With the current strength of the Dragon Palace, even if he did not make a move, it would be enough to wipe out the horned seal race and the Snake Lady Race. However, he was prepared to make a move just in case.

Going Straight to the other party’s nest, there was still a trace of risk.

As an incomparably powerful mid-level race in the universe, they had a deep foundation, and they might have treasures that could fight against knights at level 6.

However, the Dragon Palace had a strong advantage, and that was the eight points.

The eight points had already latched onto a pinnacle great being of the Horned XI clan, and they knew all the trump cards of the Horned XI clan.

With the help of the Ba Qi, everything would be much simpler.

“Order all members to prepare!”

Wang Xian stood up and said in a deep voice.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui replied immediately.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Soon, in the Dragon Field of the Dragon Palace, all the leaders and universe knight level members of the Dragon Palace were standing there and waiting.

Other than the Universe Knights of the Dragon Palace, there were only over 10,000 dragon wizards.

This was the team that the Dragon Palace sent out this time.

The ordinary members of the other combat divisions didn’t allow them to participate.

That was because there was absolutely no need.

And now, after several consecutive improvements, the number of universe knights in the Dragon Palace had reached nearly 4,000.

Such a number was not weak even among the middle-level races in the universe.

After all, the number of universe knights in the Water Dragon Palace was only around 5,000 to 6,000.

“Let’s go, we’ll rush over directly.”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across all his subordinates and revealed a satisfied expression.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Their bodies moved, and they flew to the sky above the Dragon Palace in an instant.

“Wu Wu!”

A low and muffled sound was heard. Two gigantic creatures were suspended in the air.

Xiao Lan’s current size had already reached 500 to 600 kilometers.

His strength had also broken through to the level of a universe knight level five.

On the other hand, Xiao Zhai was one level weaker, a universe knight level four.

At this time, Little Blue’s aura was abnormally terrifying.

If Little Blue’s aura was targeted at the members of the Dragon Palace, even ao Jin and the others would probably feel suppressed.

The Pinnacle inheritance of the universe, the ancient god Feeding Kun master, the Divine Dragon Phoenix and other peak bloodlines as food, kun.

Below the same level, even pure-blooded divine dragons were no match for Kun.

Only the mutated divine dragons could contend against the Kun.

Now, Xiao Lan and the small house might be the only two Kun in the universe.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian’s body moved and leaped onto Xiao Lan’s body.

The rest of the members of the Dragon Palace immediately flew onto Xiao Lan’s small house.

“Let’s go. The target is the horned seal race!”

Wang Xian patted Xiao Lan’s body and ordered faintly.

Xiao Lan possessed his own intelligence. His intelligence was very, very high.

“Woo Woo!”

Upon hearing the order, Xiao Lan let out a low growl and opened her mouth. A black hole instantly appeared in front of her.

Xiao Lan swayed her body and entered the black hole directly.

Behind her, the small house followed her into the black hole.

In the next moment, their figures disappeared instantly.

“Woo Woo!”

When they reappeared, they had already arrived at another piece of void space.

Xiao Lan let out a low growl. Another black hole appeared and they entered the space again.

Xiao Lan’s method of traveling was extremely terrifying. Even Wang Xian with the inoriginator holy wings couldn’t compare to her.

After just five hours, they arrived at the area surrounding the starry sky.

Once they arrived at the starry sky, they would often see spaceships, ships and other flying vehicles shuttling through the void.

“F * ck, what is this thing? It’s so terrifying?”

“Hiss, a space beast, this is a space beast? What grade of space beast is this, how can it be so terrifying?”

A terrifying black hole appeared out of thin air. Beside it, on a ship that looked like a dragon boat, everyone’s pupils slightly contracted when they saw the black hole.

However, when they saw the terrifying little blue fly out from the black hole, they were shocked.

Space Beasts were not rare to the people who surrounded the starry sky, but this was the first time they had seen such a huge space beast.

It was five to six hundred kilometers in size, and it was like a meteorite in the starry sky, emitting a terrifying aura.

“Hiss, what kind of space beast is this? What level is it?”

“This… This is too terrifying. Is this the space beast from the Heaven Opening Primal Continent?”

On the dragon boat, everyone looked at the huge beast in shock.

But in the next moment, Little Blue’s small house quickly disappeared from their sight.

Its speed was too terrifying!

“Oh? What a powerful space beast. What kind of beast is this?”

Xiao Lan quickly shuttled through the surrounding starry skies. When they passed through a planet, two elders were floating in the starry skies beside them. Their eyes were shining.

“Let’s go. Call the experts of our clan and follow these two space beasts. Let’s see if there’s a chance to subdue and suppress them!”

One of the elders said with a burning gaze.

They were also extremely envious of such a huge and terrifying space beast.

If they could subdue and suppress them, how domineering would their clan ride such a huge beast in the future.

Their bodies moved and immediately followed closely behind.

“Dragon King, someone is following behind us!”

At the same time, on Little Blue’s body, prime minister turtle’s gaze swept to the back and said solemnly.

Two figures followed behind them. Both of them had the strength of a level five universe knight.

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly. He glanced around and ignored them.

Xiao Lan’s body was too huge and her aura was terrifying. It was obvious that the two figures behind them did not sense their presence.

However, Wang Xian and the rest ignored them.

A black hole appeared in front of them and Xiao Lan’s figure immediately disappeared.

“HMM? They have entered the black hole and I can’t sense them?”

Seeing Xiao Lan’s small house disappearing into the black hole, it made people’s pupils contract slightly and a solemn expression appeared on their faces. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

As for the black hole, they did not dare to charge into it recklessly.

“Let’s look for it. They should be heading forward to cross the Void!”

The two were somewhat unwilling and quickly flew forward.
