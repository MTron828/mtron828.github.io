2600 Are the six major forces ready?

“Although the defense of the dragon star is very strong, they are much weaker than the six major forces. Right now, although the six major forces can’t break the defense of the Dragon Star, they can seal it

“This is also what the ninth-grade sky sect of the Sky Mountain Sword sect has no choice but to do. Besides, they have the ability to seal the Dragon Star. Who will dare to come to the dragon star in the future if they make such a statement

“Hiss. If they seal off the dragon star completely, who will dare to enter the Dragon Star in the future? They are isolating the dragon star completely. Without any resources, it will be very difficult for the Dragon Palace and the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom to develop

“It will be more than difficult. By sealing off the dragon star, they are not only sealing off other people from entering the Dragon Star. They are also sending out a message that if the disciples of the Dragon Palace and the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom enter other planets in the future, they may attack them. Who will dare to let the people of the Dragon Palace and the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom enter

“This is the way to force all the forces of the southern star system to isolate the Dragon Palace and the chaotic Tiger Demon Country and block all their development channels!”

Inside the dragon planet, some of the people who had entered frowned and discussed when they saw the news!

Sealing off the dragon planet and isolating the Dragon Palace and the chaotic Tiger Demon Country!

Even the North Gate Immortal Dynasty and the Sky Eagle Cloud Group would not dare to offend the Joint Declaration of the six forces!

After all, anyone who had any connections with the Dragon Palace would be the enemy of the six forces!

Who would dare?

“Let’s go, let’s go. If the six forces make a statement now, they will definitely make an example of the others. Anyone who dares to stay on Dragon Star at this time will definitely be attacked by the six forces!”

“Sigh, it’s a pity that dragon star has such a powerful defense and training ground!”

“The most important thing is that the Dragon Palace and the chaotic tiger demon kingdom are too weak. If they could resist the six forces with their strength, the six forces wouldn’t be able to seal the Dragon Star!”

They looked at each other, went to the teleportation array, and teleported out immediately!

They didn’t dare to violate the seal of the six forces!

“Damn it, the ninth-grade sky sect and the Sky Mountain Sword sect dare to seal us. who dares to come to the Dragon Star under their seal?”

When the disciples and experts of the tiger turmoil demon nation saw this statement, their faces turned ugly!

Once they were blocked, this would be a huge blow to them!

Their development in the future was a huge problem!

“Dragon King, after the statements of the six major forces were released, there was a problem with the teleportation formation. Furthermore, all the customers who entered Dragon Star have to leave!”

In the Dragon Palace of the Dragon Star, Prime Minister GUI reported to Wang Xian!

Just now, less than ten minutes after the statements of the six major forces were released, they sensed that the location opposite the teleportation formation had been destroyed. In other words, no planet could be directly teleported to the Dragon Star!

And the Dragon Star could forget about being teleported to other planets!

The Dragon Star was isolated and suffered great losses!

“Ignore them. Let them continue to be arrogant. Hehe!”

Wang Xian sat on the dragon throne and smiled nonchalantly!

This bunch of clowns wouldn’t be able to stay alive for long!

Up ahead, when the experts from the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation saw how relaxed Wang Xian was, they felt much more relaxed!

From the start, the Dragon King had shown them miracles one by one. As time passed, as long as the Dragon King didn’t panic, they would feel much more at ease!

“Prime Minister Gui, in the next month, send the strange demon to find out the bases of the six major forces and the positions of the level seven immortal king experts of the Sky Mountain Sword sect and the ninth-grade sky sect!”

Wang Xian sat on the dragon throne, squinted his eyes slightly and said indifferently!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded his head!

He also knew the Dragon King’s plan. In fact, the Dragon Palace now had 11 level seven immortal king experts, including the sky array!

With 11 undying king level seven experts, when the ninth-grade Sky Mountain Sword sect and the other six powers attacked, the Dragon Palace could definitely retaliate!

Other things aside, it was easy to kill hundreds of thousands of their eternal lord level disciples, even killing 400 to 500, or even 500 to 600 undying kings was very likely!

However, the Dragon Palace didn’t take any action!

The Ninth-grade Heaven Sect and Sky Mountain Sword sect had initially wanted to destroy the Dragon Palace and the Tiger Chaos Demon Country. They did not want any of them to escape!

Wang Xian had the same thought!

After the strength of all the leaders of the Dragon Palace increased, it would be the time for the Dragon Palace to take revenge!

Once the Dragon Palace took action, it would not be as simple as killing some immortal godly monarchs!

If they made a move now, the other side would be on guard!

After a month, he would make sure that none of the warriors from the 6 powers could escape!

At that time, the power of the Dragon Palace would cause the entire star south galaxy to boil!

“When will we be able to take revenge, it’s so frustrating!”

Beside, star Lady said unhappily, she and the other girls looked at the information on the AI and were extremely angry!

Now, Star Empress regarded the Dragon Palace as half a home!

“Soon, they will pay the price!”

The girls on the side said to star Empress with a smile!

Although star Empress lived in the Dragon Palace, she was not qualified to go to many core areas of the Dragon Palace. The Dragon Transformation Pool, the Dragon Cave, and the Dragon Throne were places that she could not step into!

She did not know much about the secrets of the Dragon Palace!

However, the girls knew about it, so they were not worried at all!

“Many people in the brain say that the Dragon Palace only has a stronger defense. If we can’t break through it this time, the dragon star will be destroyed sooner or later, and the Dragon Palace will be destroyed!”

...

She said!

Although the failure of the six forces to break through the defense of the Dragon Star shocked everyone, they also saw one thing clearly: the power of the Dragon Palace could not compete with the six forces!

As long as they could contend with them, the Dragon Palace wouldn’t be so passive. They wouldn’t be attacked by the six major forces as they wished. They wouldn’t be locked down as they wished!

If they were to engage in a long-term battle, the entire Dragon Palace on the dragon star might be dragged down!

“Let them make a racket first!”

Wang Xian smiled nonchalantly. He would see what would happen in a month’s time!

The six major forces failed to break through the defense of the Dragon Palace. Days passed after they announced that they were locking down the Dragon Star!

No one dared to approach the area around the Dragon Planet!

At this moment, everyone knew that they had to maintain a distance from the Dragon Palace!

A month’s time was just a snap of the fingers for this resplendent greater world!

In the Dragon Transformation Pool located in the Dragon Palace, when the last few experts of the Dragon Palace flew out, there was only a little bit of dragon blood left in the Dragon Transformation Pool!

...

Wang Xian stood there and looked ahead with a smile on his face!

There were a total of 31 members in front of him. Each of them exuded a vast aura. At the same time, there was also an intense battle intent!

All of them had the combat strength of a level seven immortal King!

Behind them were hundreds of level six immortal king members of the Dragon Palace!

“One month is very fast!”

Wang Xian glanced at his subordinates and muttered!

“The dragon palace has been defending passively. Now... I wonder if the six powers are ready?”Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
