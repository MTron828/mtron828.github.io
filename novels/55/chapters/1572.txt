Chapter 1573: 1573 on the betrayal of the Bingxin Empire

When Wang Xian cured a few powerhouses who were invaded by the soul of darkness, especially after curing the ancestors of the Bingxin Empire.

The name of the saint of Light was even more resounding.

If the name of the saint was conferred by the Wuji Empire in the beginning, it was now publicly acknowledged.

After staying in Ling Jian ‘ER’s courtyard for seven to eight days, the relationship between Wang Xian and her increased daily.

Now, they could already have some intimate little moves.

This made Wang Xian very happy.

In the past few days, the relationship between the Bingxin Empire and Wang Xian was also very good.

The king of bingxin even vaguely revealed that he could marry Ling Jian ‘er to Wang Xian.

“I’ve made a breakthrough, I’ve finally made a breakthrough!”

On the afternoon of the tenth day, Wang Xian and Ao Jian stood in the courtyard and looked at Ling Jian ‘er who was getting up.

She looked at Wang Xian with excitement and shouted happily.

After absorbing the sword heart grass and the various spiritual herbs and elixirs that Wang Xian had given her for the past ten days, her strength had broken through to the third level of the Seethrough realm.

Once she broke through to the third level of the Seethrough realm, she could kill an expert at the fourth level of the Seethrough realm.

Her strength had achieved a qualitative improvement.

It was not an exaggeration to say that Ling Jian ‘ER’s current strength and talent were unrivalled in the entire vast region.

Even Wu Qing city, Nangong Wudi, and the two heaven’s favorites from the Solitaire sect were no match for Ling Jian ‘ER.

“Congratulations to our Jian ‘er for her great increase in strength!”

Wang Xian walked over with a smile on his face and patted her head.

“HMPH, put your hand down!”

Ling Jian ‘er glared at him, but her eyes were filled with a smile. “The Emperor wants me to participate in the Solitaire Sect’s martial arts competition tomorrow. If I win, I will be able to obtain a lot of resources and become famous!”

“The unique martial arts competition organized by the unique sect? If you want to participate, just do it!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and said directly.

“Yes, my master also wants me to participate. If I can obtain good results, it will be beneficial to our Bingxin Empire!”

Ling Jian ‘er nodded.

“With your strength, Jian ‘er, you will definitely be able to suppress the entire arena. No one is your match!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Wang Xian smiled at her and said.

“HMPH, that’s right. I will definitely get first place!”

Ling Jian ‘er raised her head with a smile and said confidently.

“In the future, a swordswoman will appear in the vast region!”

Wang Xian said with a smile. He looked at the time and said, “I will go back first. I will look for you tomorrow morning!”

“Okay!”

Ling Jian ‘er nodded and watched Wang Xian leave.

The next morning, when Wang Xian arrived in front of Ling Jian ‘ER’s courtyard, he found dozens of young men from the Bingxin Empire gathered there.

“Sir Sage!”

“Sir Sage!”

When they saw Wang Xian coming over, everyone shouted at him respectfully.

Now, everyone in the Bingxin Empire knew that Wang Xian had saved the Patriarch of the Bingxin Empire.

In addition to his powerful strength, no one dared not to treat him respectfully.

Even the ninth prince, Bing Jinghuan, lowered his head with an awkward expression and greeted Wang Xian when he saw him.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded at them with a smile.

“Wang Xian!”

Ling Jian ‘er walked over and shouted at Wang Xian with a smile.

“Yes, are all of you going to participate?”

Wang Xian looked at the group of young people from the Bingxin Empire and asked with a smile.

“Some of you are going to participate. Let’s go, let’s hurry over!”

Ling Jian ‘er nodded and urged him.

“Alright, Alright!”

The Bingxin Empire had a closer relationship with the solitaire sect, and they respected the solitaire sect.

All the young people could participate in the solitaire martial arts competition. If they performed well in the competition, they would be accepted into the solitaire sect.

Every year, tens of thousands of youths would try their best to join the sect.

Once they joined such a large sect, no one would dare to offend them in the vast region.

“Priest Wang!”

When they had not gone far, a voice sounded.

Everyone from the Iceheart dynasty was slightly shocked when they heard this voice and quickly looked over.

“Your Highness the Crown Prince!”

Everyone’s expression changed slightly as they immediately shouted respectfully.

“Wu Qing City!”

Wang Xian looked over. “It seems like you have completely recovered!”

“I have to thank you, Pastor Wang. I’m here to thank you personally!”

Wu Qing City spoke with great respect. He walked over with a smile on his face.

“There’s no need to thank me. I’ve received a lot of rewards!”

Wang Xian smiled.

“It’s different, it’s different. If it weren’t for you, my life would be over. Where are you going, Pastor Wang?”

Wu Qingcheng shook his head and said.

“Jian ‘ER is participating in the exclusive martial arts competition of the Solitaire sect. That’s why I’m accompanying her!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Haha, Pastor Wang, you’re really a good man. I originally wanted to thank you today. Since that’s the case, don’t mind if I go with you guys to take a look!”

Wu Qing Cheng smiled.

“Sure!”

Wang Xian looked at Ling Jian ‘er and nodded.

“Alright!”

Wu Qing Cheng walked over with a smile and started a simple conversation with Wang Xian and Ling Jian ‘ER.

Behind him, a group of young men from the icy heart empire watched this scene in awe.

Even the crown prince of the Wu Ji Empire was so respectful to priest Wang. One could imagine his current status.

He kept walking in the direction of the Solitaire sect. Numerous mountains appeared in his line of sight.

The solitaire sect was located in a mountain peak in the base of the ruins of the divine kingdom.

“The Solitaire sect occupies the best part of the ruins of the divine kingdom. There is a powerful formation left behind by the divine kingdom, such as long-distance teleportation!”

As they approached the mountains, Wu Qing city spoke to Wang Xian.

“Long-distance teleportation. What kind of formation is this?”

Wang Xian looked at him curiously.

“Long-distance teleportation. It’s even more powerful than the teleportation of a longevity-level powerhouse. Through long-distance teleportation, one can instantly travel tens of thousands of kilometers!”

“This is a formation left behind from the ruins of the divine kingdom. Only my sect is lucky enough to occupy it!”

Wu Qing Cheng said with some envy.

“That’s the crown prince of Wu Qing city. Why is he here? !”

“Look at the young man next to him. He’s priest Wang, priest Wang of the sage. Oh My God!”

“I heard that the sage likes a princess of the Bingxin Empire. The Bingxin Empire has struck it rich this time!”

As they continued walking in, more and more people gathered.

When they saw Wang Xian and Wu Qing city, they were all shocked.

The name of the saint of light had spread across the entire vast region.

They continued to walk in and entered the valley. Around them, there were many young men who had rushed over from other places.

There were many of them, more than 100,000 of them.

However, there were only about 10,000 of them who were qualified to participate in the competition.

“It’s right in front. That’s the Supreme Stage!”

After walking for about 10 kilometers, they arrived at the center of the two mountain peaks. In front of them, there were tall stages.

On both sides of the arenas, there were two stone pillars that were five hundred meters tall.

One on the left and one on the right, each of them wrote, “In heaven and on Earth, only I am Supreme!”!
