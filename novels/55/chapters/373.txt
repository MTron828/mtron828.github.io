Chapter 374: Xiao Yu Met With A Mishap!

“Sect Leader Tang, what happened to my sister?” Wang Xian took a deep breath before asking Sect Leader Tang directly.

“Xiao Yu and her master were poisoned by strange venom. Both of them are currently unconscious. Miracle Doctor Wang, where are you? It would be best if you can come over and take a look immediately!” answered Sect Leader Tang hurriedly.

“Alright. I will return immediately and will reach you by night. Where is Xiao Yu now?” Wang Xian asked with a gloomy face.

“She is in the villa. We have asked Sui Huang for help but there’s nothing much he could do!” Sect Leader Tang sounded flustered when she spoke.

“I get it... Please take care of Xiao Yu and Elder Fang. I will head back immediately!” Wang Xian pulled a long face as he hung up the phone.

“What’s the matter, Xiao Xian? What happened to Xiao Yu? I got a phone message from Elder Fang too!” Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue walked in and asked anxiously.

They had been in the Dragon Palace over the last few days. At a depth of over a thousand meters, there was no reception at all. As such, they had left their phones on the yacht.

If it wasn’t for Lan Qingyue wanting to settle some company matters, they wouldn’t have known something had happened to Xiao Yu.

“She sparred with someone and was poisoned in the process. Elder Fang was poisoned too. The message was likely from Sect Leader Tang!”

Wang Xian’s expression turned gloomy. Poisoned while sparring? Sui Huang couldn’t do anything with the venom?

Although Sui Huang was not a miracle doctor, he was a Dan Realm expert and an experienced alchemist. His understanding of poison wouldn’t be shallow.

If there’s nothing he could do about this venom, it must be something extraordinary.

“To be severely poisoned when sparring?”

Wang Xian’s expression turned gloomier. Dense killing intent gleamed in his eyes.

Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue saw his expression. They immediately tried to comfort and calm him down.

The yacht steered swiftly towards Rivertown.

Their location was rather far from Rivertown and it would take approximately ten hours.

When the yacht arrived at the villa, it was already 8 pm.

Wang Xian leaped out of the yacht and into the villa.

“Young master!”

When Wang Xian entered the villa, Mo Yuan immediately greeted him.

Mm!

Wang Xian didn’t speak much and headed for the room directly.

“Young master, Xiao Yu is in the room on the second floor!” remarked Mo Yuan instantly.

Mm!

Wang Xian nodded his head. He didn’t take the stairs but instead jumped to the second floor directly and quickly made his way to the door.

Bam!

“Miracle Doctor Wang, you are here! Xiao Yu and her master are still unconscious!” Sect Leader Tang stood up immediately the moment he saw Wang Xian and spoke in a fatigued tone.

“Let me take a look!”

Wang Xian turned his attention to Xiao Yu and Elder Fang. Their faces were as white as chalk without any signs of blood. Around them, a deathly aura was shrouding over them.

Wang Xian reached his arm out and placed his hand on Xiao Yu solemnly. Dragon energy was injected into Xiao Yu directly.

“This is...?”

The moment the dragon energy flowed into Xiao Yu, Wang Xian had a grasp of what was happening inside Xiao Yu.

Densely packed black dots were scattered all over her body. It looked dreadful.

These black dots were slowly absorbing the life energy of Xiao Yu and seemed to have fused with her.

“Cleanse!”

Wang Xian pulled a long face and attempted to cleanse the black dots away with dragon energy.

Ugh!

As the dragon energy cleansed one of the dots, Xiao Yu grimaced in pain. Cold sweat broke out and streamed down her forehead.

Wang Xian turned gloomy. A female disciple from Thistles and Thorns Sect immediately used a tower to wipe away the sweat from Xiao Yu’s body.

“Miracle Doctor Wang, Sui Huang said Xiao Yu and her master suffered from the Black Bone Venom and the poison is now deeply rooted and fused with their bodies. Using brute strength to cleanse the poison would be equivalent to scrapping their bones with knives. The pain is still secondary. The main issue is that the Black Bone Venom has fused into their bodies and is absorbing eighty percent of their life energy. Cleansing them will kill only Xiao Yu and Elder Fang!”

Sect Leader Tang was bitter as she spoke. She knew about what Sui Huang was capable of from Elder Fang.

He was an existence that only existed in records. If an expert that was above the Inborn Realm said that they had no hope of recovering, that would almost be equivalent to...

Upon hearing Sect Leader Tang, Wang Xian pulled a long face. He slowed down and used dragon energy to inspect the venom.

Just like Sui Huang had diagnosed, Wang Xian realized how thorny the situation was after inspecting Xiao Yu’s body.

This was the first time he’d encountered venom that couldn’t be cleansed with dragon energy.

The Black Bone Venom in Xiao Yu had fused with her. Furthermore, the venom was absorbing eighty percent of her life energy.

This resulted in Xiao Yu losing consciousness. If he was to cleanse the venom, he would kill Xiao Yu in the process.

“What a sinister venom! This is equivalent to letting Xiao Yu and Elder Fang spend the rest of their lives in bed!”

Dense killing intent leaked out from Wang Xian’s body. He caressed Xiao Yu’s head and injected streams of Azure Dragon energy into her body.

When the Azure Dragon energy entered Xiao Yu’s body, Wang Xian was shocked to see the black dots absorbing the energy too.

“Sect Leader Tang, did Sui Huang give any other information on the Black Bone Venom?” Wang Xian asked with a gloomy face.

“Nothing else! The so-called Black Bone Venom is also just a name coined by Sui Huang, himself. I have been researching this venom for the last few days and haven’t come across anything,” Sect Leader Tang said in a dismal tone.

“No information?”

Wang Xian clenched his fist tightly. He looked at Xiao Yu and Elder Fang’s pale expressions and was thinking hard for a solution.

“Miracle Doctor Wang, do you have any solutions?” Sect Leader Tang looked at him and asked anxiously.

Xiao Yu was the hope of the Thistles and Thorns Sect and Elder Fang had now reached the Half-step to Inborn Realm. It would just be a matter of time before she reached the Inborn Realm.

If something were to happen to them, it would be a huge blow to Thistles and Thorns Sect.

Wang Xian did not reply. At this moment, Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue and Sun Lingxiu entered the room.

When they saw Xiao Yu and Elder Fang lying on the bed, and the gloomy Wang Xian, their hearts skipped a beat.

Sun Lingxiu was surprised to see Wang Xian’s gloomy expression. She waved her arm and dazzling rays shrouded Xiao Yu and Elder Fang.

Huh?

Sun Lingxiu’s eyebrows knitted together and she used her Light attribute energy to inspect them again.

When the Light energy shone on their bodies, it was absorbed immediately. Sensing the conditions, she frowned more deeply. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Dragon Transforming Pool! That’s the only potential option now!”

Wang Xian thought hard about this option. The Dragon Transformation Pool had the effect of cleansing one’s physical body. With the power effects of the Dragon Transformation Pool, there was a chance the Black Bone Venom could be removed from their bodies.

“Before that, let’s try to help them regain their consciousness. After that... ”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with killing intent. He was determined to find the culprit. If the culprit had the antidote, it would be best. Otherwise...

Annihilate the entire clan or sect!

Or perhaps the outcome would be the same with or without the antidote.
