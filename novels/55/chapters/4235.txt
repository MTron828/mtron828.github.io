Translator: 549690339

“Make your move. Even if we can’t get it, the Dragon King can forget about getting it. ”

The four kings of all gods in the belief universe said with killing intent on their faces.

The last time, the Dragon King had ruined their plans that had lasted for more than a billion years.

This time, they would definitely not let the Dragon King succeed.

The four of them followed the direction of the strong energy fluctuation and flew away quickly.

At the location of the battlefield, Wang Xian was completely suppressing the

Beast Emperor Qian Jiang.

Tianci had just arrived and was about to make his move. However, Wang Xian sensed something and frowned slightly.

“As expected, he’s still here! ”

He thought to himself and immediately sent a voice transmission to tianci!

“Huala! ”

At the same time, Wang Xian’s body shook and the incipient Saint Wings appeared on his body.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Boom! Boom! Boom

Waves of powerful wind and thunder energy attacked the Beast Emperor.

The power of the wind and thunder locked onto the enemy surged into the body of the Beast Emperor. “Roar! Roar! Roar!”

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Miserable screams kept coming from the Beast Emperor.

Faced with the attacks of Wang Xian and the rest, the Beast Emperor had no room to resist.

He could only use his innate ability to dodge.

He relied on his strong vitality to support himself.

Whoosh

The incorporeal holy wings turned into a shadow, and the power of wind and thunder filled Beast Emperor Qian Jiang’s body.

“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. ”

Just as Wang Xian was about to attack, an angry roar was heard.

Accompanied by a terrifying holy sword light, it slashed directly at Wang Xian’s enormous body.

“HMPH!”

“You guys who believe in the universe, you guys have hidden yourselves quite well !

Wang Xian saw the holy sword that was attacking him. He waved his arm and the Tai Chi Dragon coiled in the void and turned into a tai chi pattern to block it directly!

“Last time, you ruined our plan. This time, you want to hunt down the space behemoth? Wishful Thinking! ”

A king of Pantheon who was at the control level spoke with a face full of killing intent!

“Chant, convert! ”

As the King of Pantheon spoke, Holy Words came out from his mouth. Chanting and rumbling sounds could be heard from the surroundings.

This was a special type of energy.

The power of faith condensed into symbols and attacked Wang Xian!

The symbols were densely packed and filled with strange energy!

Once the symbols of faith entered one’s body, one’s mind would be attacked.

“Great dharma celestial phenomenon, belief in the body of the gods, exorcism! ”

The other three kings of the gods immediately displayed a series of powerful attacks.

There were strange symbols of faith.

There was a huge and majestic body condensed from the power of faith.

There was a holy temple suspended high in the sky.

There were also many bald and naked saints.

This time, the four kings of the gods had clearly used all of their strength.

They wanted to challenge Wang Xian.

They wanted to teach Wang Xian a good lesson.

Even if they couldn’t kill him, they had to make him pay the price!

“Tianci, let’s play with them! ”

When Wang Xian saw this scene, his eyes focused as he shouted with a cold expression!

“Mighty Heavenly Dragon! ”

Wang Xian growled and a gigantic dragon head appeared in the sky above him.

The dragon head spat out nine-colored rays of light and attacked them directly!

Good!

Tianci’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit.

He waved his arm and a branch appeared in his hand!

The Phantom of the divine tree appeared behind him.

He held the branch in his hand and waved it forward.

In the void, countless vines appeared. They pierced through the void and attacked a king of Pantheon who was at the control level!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Qian Jiang Beast Emperor saw waves of terrifying energy from the side.

When he saw that Wang Xian didn’t care about him, he let out a low roar in fear.

He didn’t hesitate at all and instantly used his powerful innate skill!

Splash

His gigantic body carried a terrifying and endless river as he disappeared into the void.

It was as if his body had disappeared into the sea and disappeared in an instant!

Wang Xian sensed that the beast emperor Qian Jiang had escaped and didn ‘t pay it any attention.

He swayed his humongous body and the five elements millstone floated above his dragon head.

He was wearing the tai chi dragon disc and was facing the two kings of pantheon.

Two of them were at the mastery level.

The last one who had just entered the mastery level, Hun Dun, who was at the side, rushed forward.

The battle erupted in an instant!

“Daluo Heavenly Seal! ”

The two kings of Pantheon, who were at the mastery level, saw Wang Xian charging toward them.

When they saw that their other two companions were blocked, their expressions changed slightly.

The two of them immediately unleashed numerous gigantic hand seals to meet the gigantic dragon head phantom in front of Wang Xian!

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” “Boom! Boom!”

The sound of the collision rang out.

“These two people are not as strong as me when they join forces! ”

Wang Xian’s gaze froze when he saw the collision.

There were also differences in the strength of the Heaven’s origin creation at the mastery level.

Some at the mastery level could fight against the weakest mastery level as well as the weakest beginner level.

Some at the mastery level could even fight against two at the mastery level.

Under normal circumstances, there were experts who divided the four levels of beginner control into four levels.

Beginner levels were divided into two levels.

Beginner Level One was the weakest, beginner level two could fight against two beginner level one.

Then there was control level one, control level one was the weakest, control level eight was the highest.

After control level eight was the Great Dao level.

Great Dao from level one to level twenty-six.

As for those above level twenty-six, they would be at the level of Chaos!

The specific classification was based on those who had just stepped into the Heaven’s origin realm.

Wang Xian had reached the level of Great Dao. It could be said that he was equivalent to a level nine powerhouse.

In other words, he could fight against nine existences who had just stepped into the Heaven’s origin realm.

The two king of Pantheon who believed in the universe were not the weakest masters at the level of mastery.

The combined strength of the two of them was about level seven or eight.

There was still a gap between their strength and Wang Xian’s.

Buzz

Wang Xian’s body trembled. The Void Dragon body in his body led his body to teleport!

In the next moment, Wang Xian’s figure appeared in the test of a king of the gods who believed in the universe!

He waved his dragon claw instantly.

A burst of energy attacked him.

The Dragon Claw contained nine types of energy. The collision of the nine types of energy was extremely chaotic!

“The path of belief! ”

The expression of the king of all gods who was attacked changed drastically. He waved his arm and an infinitely long path appeared in front of him.

His body arrived at the end of the path at a strange speed.

In front of him, his body had also dodged to an extremely far position.

“Be careful, he has the power of space.”

The king of all gods shouted loudly with a solemn face!

“If you don’t believe in the gods, don’t enter the cycle of reincarnation and die!

The other king of all gods had an unsightly expression. He raised the staff in his hand and a huge white circle appeared.

This white circle seemed to be a terrifying existence that could devour living beings. It directly covered Wang Xian!

“Explode! ”Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian’s dragon tail swept out and the huge white circle exploded!
