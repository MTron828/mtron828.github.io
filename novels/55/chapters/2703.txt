2704 2704 heroes meeting

“Ao Qitian, Ao Jian, the four of you go to the Abyss to investigate the situation. Don’t kill any abyssal seeds for the time being. Focus on investigating the situation.”

After chatting with the Imperial Star Lady for a while, Wang Xian instructed ao Qitian and the rest.

At the same time, he passed the mother nest to Ao Jian and the rest.

In the mother nest, the world’s end ruler was placed inside. If they were to encounter danger, Ao Jian and the rest could control the world’s end ruler.

With the Heaven’s end ruler and Ao Qitian, the two peak immortal godly monarchs, it would not be a problem for them to investigate some information.

“It’s the Dragon King.”

Ao Qitian and the rest nodded immediately.

Wang Xian sat in the room and checked some information on the artificial intelligence.

In order to attract more powerhouses to the Abyss battlefield, the Imperial Court announced a map of the distribution of abyss seeds on the artificial intelligence. There were also weaknesses that were targeted at the abyss seeds.

This time, it could be said that the imperial court did not hold back at all.

The next day, Ao Qitian, Ao Jian, and the rest came back from their investigation and reported some information. Then, Wang Xian went to the Abyss personally to investigate the situation within a radius of a few hundred million kilometers.

“The abyss seeds here are very smart. They know how to use formations and know how to join forces to attack. If our members of the Dragon Palace come to hunt, it’s also possible. However, the risk is ten times higher.”

Wang Xian, Ao Jian, AO qitian, and the rest were standing on a meteorite in the abyss.

Ao Qitian said to him.

Wang Xian, who was beside him, nodded slightly.

The abyssal species here gathered together in groups. They were hidden behind the meteorite. Once someone came, they would be attacked by the abyssal species.

Furthermore, after a whole day of investigation by Wang Xian, the abyssal species here were very smart. They would request for reinforcements.

It would be dangerous if there were other abyssal species around the abyssal species that they encountered.

They would join forces to attack.

It was indeed difficult to hunt down abyssal species that had the geographical advantage.

They could not be compared to the Demon Island at all. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

It was obvious how many powerful abyssal species there were. However, it was different here.

If they encountered powerful ones, they could only escape.

If they couldn’t escape, they would die.

“No wonder the imperial court is holding this hero’s meeting. It’s too dangerous to fight alone here.”

Wang Xian looked around and mumbled.

To fight against the abyssal seeds here, one had to check the situation around before attacking.

When attacking, one also had to prevent the other party from escaping. There was a huge requirement for humans.

“Dragon King, speaking of which, this place is not suitable for a large number of members of the Dragon Palace to come here. The danger is too high. We have investigated some battles in the central region and the death rate is very high.”

Ao Jian said from the side.

“It is indeed not suitable.”

Wang Xian nodded his head in agreement. He was slightly disappointed in his heart.

If this place was not suitable, it would be difficult for the Dragon Palace to hunt down some abyssal seeds.

“I still can’t take this risk.”

Wang Xian shook his head and made up his mind.

“Let’s go back.”

He moved his body and immediately flew towards the location outside.

Now, he understood why the imperial court had invested so much to recruit all the powerhouses in the world to come to the Abyss battlefield.

As soon as he flew out of the Abyss, Wang Xian saw a message sent to him by the celestial lady of the artificial intelligence system.

He took a glance at it and flew straight to the palace where the celestial maiden lived.

“Wang Xian, how’s the investigation going these few days? There will be a hero’s meeting tomorrow morning. Do you want to go over and take a look?”

Seeing Wang Xian flying over, the celestial maiden immediately went up to him and asked with a smile.

“HMM, sure.”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“Alright, I’ll call you tomorrow morning. Let’s go. I still have some matters to discuss with senior sister and the rest.”

Emperor Star Lady nodded her head happily, waved her hand and left.

Wang Xian nodded his head with a smile.

“Let’s stay here for a few more days before we leave.”

He mumbled and thought to himself.

“Wang Xian, let’s Go!”

The next morning, Emperor Star Lady’s voice rang out.

“So early?”

...

Wang Xian walked out and looked at Emperor Star Lady who was dressed in military attire. He sized her up.

“It’s getting late. There are already a lot of people at the hero Arena.”

Di Xing nu urged him and brought him to fly towards the planet behind the teleportation formation.

At this moment, beside the planet of the teleportation formation, there was a piece of land floating in the void.

On it, there was a huge flag with the words hero arena written on it.

On the flag, there were already millions of people gathered.

Among these millions of people, there were hundreds of thousands of immortal God kings.

The rest were all existences above level 6 or 7 of the Eternal God Lord.

“There are so many powerhouses. How many powerhouses from your imperial court are here?”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across and revealed a surprised expression.

“About one-third of them are from our imperial court.”

...

“Let’s go. A few senior sisters are waiting for me.”

As she spoke, she landed in a direction.

Wang Xian looked around. There were not only humans but also many heaven demons. There were many powerhouses.

He even saw people of immortal king level eight or nine. These people were not the powerhouses of the imperial court but outsiders.

“Star Lady.”

Emperor Star Lady and Wang Xian flew over. At the side, more than a hundred people immediately surrounded them.

“Dragon King!”

Everyone called out to Emperor Star Lady and then greeted Wang Xian respectfully.

“You guys talk to star Lady.”

Wang Xian nodded to them and said.

“Senior sister, just pretend that he doesn’t exist.”

Emperor Star Lady also smiled.

“It’s amazing that the star Lady was able to invite the Dragon King over. The Dragon Palace is very powerful now.”

“The relationship between the star Lady and the Dragon King seems to be very good.”

The people around and the people around whispered.

“Star Lady, let’s go to the front. There are the most powerful people gathered there. Let’s see if we can recruit some people. We can work with them too.”

A middle-aged lady at Level Seven Immortal King said to Emperor Star Lady.

“Alright.”

Emperor star lady nodded and looked at Wang Xian beside her. She asked, “Are you coming with us or wandering around by yourself?”

“Let’s go together. There’s nothing much to do.”

Wang Xian said and followed beside them.

“Look over there. The Heavenly Sword King is here. I didn’t expect him to participate in this hero gathering.”

“It’s not just the heavenly sword king who is here. One-armed saber is here too. He must have received an invitation from the Guardians of the imperial court. As long as he is prepared to enter the Abyss battlefield, most of the powerhouses are here.”

“We can form a team here, especially with the powerhouses of the imperial court.”

Wang Xian followed beside the imperial star Lady and the rest. There were all sorts of discussions around them.

“Heavenly Sword King, one-armed saber.”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the surroundings as he mumbled.

Heavenly Sword King and one-armed saber were both existences at the peak of Immortal King level. Furthermore, they were both lone travelers. They did not establish any factions nor joined any factions.

The two of them were legendary figures in the Emperor Star region.
