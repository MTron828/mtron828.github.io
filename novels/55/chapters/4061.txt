100,000 years passed very quickly. Lin Niu was giving a sermon while Wang Xian and the rest were listening at the side.

This was also very useful for Wang Xian and the rest in their cultivation.

For those who were at a lower level, it was even more enlightening.

Some of those below the universe knight level even broke through on the spot after listening to Lin Niu’s sermon.

Those who were lucky and had sufficient resources could raise their levels by two or three levels with one sermon.

After all, Lin Niu had been lecturing for 100,000 years.

For those with lower levels, 100,000 years was a very, very long time.

In the past, Liu Lan and hopeless sky had not been lecturing for so long.

During the last calamity, Liu Lan and hopeless sky had also been heavily injured in the battle with Agar Sky Devil God.

This was especially so when Liu Lan had yet to make a breakthrough.

Wang Xian had sustained serious injuries when he fought the Asgardian demon God alone.

It was not something that could be recovered in a short period of time since the Heaven’s origin creation was severely injured.

They had been in a deep slumber for over ten billion years just by recovering from their injuries.

They would occasionally come out in the middle.

Coupled with the fact that the Lin Niu’s sermon would mobilize the energy of the heaven and earth, the surrounding area was filled with energy that was comparable to some paradises. This allowed many strong disciples to receive a huge boost.

“Brother Wang Xian, are you going back? Why Don’t you bring US along too?”

Two years after Lin Niu’s sermon ended, Long Yinhao asked Wang Xian with a smile.

“Hehe, when you enter another universe, you will be suppressed by the other universe. Furthermore, I still have some matters to deal with. Come back when the calamity begins. ”

Wang Xian smiled at him and replied, “I still have two hostile forces in the nine-origin universe that need to be dealt with. ”VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Eh? Big Brother, you still have hostile forces in the nine-origin universe?” Long Yinhao asked with a face full of astonishment.

“Hehe, yes. Before I made a breakthrough, I provoked two powerful races. Both of them have the existence of the Heaven’s origin creation.”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile.

“Big Brother is indeed big brother. When you didn’t have the strength of the Heaven’s destiny, you dared to fight against two forces of the Heaven’s destiny. Now that you have broken through, coupled with Big Brother Lin Niu, you can easily defeat them?”

Long Yinhao flattered him.

“Hehe, it’s not as simple as you guys say. However, there’s one thing. Regarding safety, there won’t be any problems. I will leave the Void Dragon body here and continue to cultivate here. The Void Dragon body is also equivalent to myself. ”

Wang Xian replied with a smile.

“Then pay attention to your safety when you go back. ”

Long Yin reminded him.

“Don ‘t worry, nothing will happen. ”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“Brother Wang Xian, you must come when Yinhao and I have broken through to the peak of the Overlord realm and are preparing for our wedding. ”

Saintess Liuyue said with a smile. “No problem. ”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

Wang Xian chatted with them for a while.

“Help me inform senior Liu Lan and senior Wu Wangtian. I Won’t say goodbye.”

Finally, Wang Xian said something to Saintess Liu Yue.

She was from the flowing water forbidden land. It would be better for her to inform them.

Although Wang Xian’s void dragon body was still here.

After saying that, he left with Lin Niu.

When they arrived at the nine-origin universe, Wang Xian only needed to give the Heaven’s origin Jade Horn to the Unicorn Ox. The Unicorn Ox would be able to get rid of the suppression of the nine-origin universe.

However, just as Wang Xian was bringing the unicorn ox to the nine-origin universe…

It was located in the east of the nine-origin universe. This place did not belong to the nine-origin universe. Instead, it belonged to the chaotic space on the side of the nine-origin universe.

In this extremely remote and remote place, there was an incomparably huge tree growing in the chaos.

The tree was extremely lush and had countless branches.

Every branch was hundreds of millions of kilometers away.

Every branch was like an incomparably huge mountain range. It could be called a huge city territory.

This incomparably huge and vast tree supported a piece of space.

Within this space, there was a vast amount of energy.

Nine attributes, plus the space attribute, as well as other energies.

All sorts of energies opened up a space that could allow other living beings to live.

It was comparable to a powerful grotto-heaven blessed land.

“This is truly a blessing for our nine-origin universe. I didn’t expect that a primal chaos tree would actually come to a place not far from our nine-origin universe. This is truly the good fortune of our nine-origin universe. ”

Beside this enormous tree, there were a few slightly tiny figures.

However, even though these figures looked tiny, they contained an extremely terrifying might.

Moreover, the only ones who could enter the primal chaos were the existences of the Heavenly Yuan’s good fortune.

The eight figures stood there, their eyes flickering with fervor and excitement.

No one understood the tree of chaos better than them. This kind of tree appearing around a universe meant something.

In the boundless chaos, apart from the deathly stillness, there were also many mystical treasures and items.

Among them, the tree of chaos was the largest treasure in the entire chaos.

Unfortunately, even the Heavenly Yuan creator was unable to control the tree of chaos.

The Tree of Chaos opened up a chaotic space that contained a huge amount of energy.

It was comparable to a powerful grotto-heaven blessed land.

In addition, once a primal chaos tree appeared, it was very likely that all sorts of treasures would appear around it.

The Primal Chaos Tree was also known as the treasure gathering tree.

The Primal Chaos Tree moved at all times.

Not long after it moved to the 9-origin universe, it was sensed by them.

“With this primal chaos tree, during this period of time when the calamity arrives, the number of great beings in our 9-origin universe will be doubled.”

In the center, a noble woman in green clothes said faintly.

She was the elven empress, the heavenly fate of the Elven race in the nine-origin universe.

And the other seven figures around her.

They all took human forms.

There were the Phoenix race, the angel race, the Saint Race, the demon race, the dark race, the black tortoise race, and the royal race.

Yes, the eight of them were all the heavenly fate in the nine-origin universe.

Among the twelve peak clans, there were eight heavenly fate existences.

If the Divine Dragon Clan was still at its peak, then there were nine.

This was a very large number.

Moreover, no one would have thought that the weakest royal clan would have a heavenly fate existence.

On the contrary, powerful races like the skeleton clan and the Wizard clan did not have a heavenly fate.

However, the 12 ancestor Wizards of the Wizard clan were enough to fight against the heavenly fate.

When one’s cultivation reached the heavenly fate, the increase in strength would be very slow.

If one wanted to increase their strength, other than having a large amount of resources, there was another way, which was to step into the chaos.

To search for opportunities and treasures in the chaos.

But in the chaos, there were dangers..
