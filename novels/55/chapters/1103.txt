Chapter 1104: 1105 Feng Luan arrived

Translator: 5496903

Time passed day by day. Soon, three days passed by in a flash.

The group of ocean cultivators did not leave. The bloody demonic beasts were still hiding in the dark clouds in the sky.

“This ocean cultivators have such patience and ability. Why didn’t they come when the holy sea town was in danger? Hehe, what a joke!”

Wang Xian stood in a separate courtyard in the mayor’s residence and sat on the roof. He looked out of the city and thought to himself.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

At this moment, Wang Xian saw many figures flying over Shenghai town. Soon, the sky was slightly red as if flames were burning.

“Shenghai town, do you think that we can’t do anything to you just by relying on the formation? Let me tell you, if you dare to betray the country, you shall be sentenced to death. Just wait for your death!”

A loud roar covered the entire Shenghai town.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and looked at the sky.

The loud noise that resounded in the sky also caused everyone in Shenghai town to frown. They hurriedly looked at the sky.

“What happened? Why is the Sky Red?”

“It’s the formation. It must be the ocean cultivators outside who are trying to deal with us!”

“Damn it! Damn it! Those bastards! Damn them!”

“I know! I know what it is! It’s a fire mist formation! They’ve sealed our holy sea town with a formation! The fire mist formation is a Tier 8 formation! It can create a fire dance space! There’s no water element energy in this space! Quick, check the underground water! is the underground water sealed by the formation as well?”

“We can’t extract water from the ground anymore. It’s blocked by the array. This is bad. They want to cut off our water source!”

The sudden change in the sky and the majestic voice caused everyone’s expression to change drastically. They hurriedly shouted.

When someone recognized this array, their expressions changed instantly. All of them revealed furious expressions.

The fire fog array was only a transcendent level 8 array. This kind of array wasn’t very useful. It was considered a good auxiliary cultivation array for fire attribute cultivators.

In this array space, if the water energy was used up, it wouldn’t be able to condense water energy.

East Sea city had brought over a dozen fire mist arrays to completely envelop holy sea town.

Cut off the water source.

Once the water source was cut off, what awaited the humans of holy sea town was death.

With their strength, they couldn’t do without water.

“So ruthless, so ruthless. They’re destroying everyone in Holy Sea Town!”

Jin Qianyuan and the other experts looked at the fiery red sky, and their faces slowly sank.

The underground water was blocked by the array. Water-elemental cultivators could condense the surrounding water, but when the water energy in the surrounding space was used up, it would be troublesome.

“It is not necessary to destroy everyone, but it can make holy sea town fall into Panic!”

With a level eight extraordinary formation, they could dig into the ground all the way to the location of the formation and break the formation to get water.

However, it was already good enough to feed more than 10,000 people. It was impossible to supply 1.7 to 8 million people!

“Let’s report this matter to Lord Wang Xian first!”

Jin Qianyuan and the rest had solemn expressions as they immediately headed towards the holy sea town.

At this moment, at the East Gate of the Holy Sea Town, a group of people came to the city wall and glared at the Sea of cultivators in front of them.

“You bunch of despicable fellows. You Didn’t come to save us when we were in danger. Now that we have escaped, you want to kill US instead. Star-moon kingdom will be destroyed sooner or later!”

“Shameless people! You Bunch of bastards! You’ll get your comeuppance!”

Some of the people’s faces turned red as they cursed loudly.

“You Bunch of Fools! You’ll have to pay a bloody price for betraying us and violating the dignity of star-moon kingdom!”

“You Bunch of Fools! It Won’t be long before you roll out and kneel in front of us!” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“How dare you curse at our Army of ocean cultivators? Haha, Just You Wait. In half a month at most, you’ll come and beg us!”

The soldiers of the ocean cultivator corps burst into laughter.

After being scolded by the people of Holy Sea town for the past few days, they finally let out a sigh of relief today.

These damn fools, just you wait for the ocean cultivator corps to trample on them!

“Humph, I want to see how long you can hold on!”

“Pay attention to the array formation. If there is any place that is broken, immediately use spirit stones to repair it!”

Tsunami sky sneered and ordered the soldiers at the side.

“Yes, General!”

A few officers were also excited.

When they came out and the formation was removed, he would let this group of stupid people know the consequences of insulting them.

The soldiers of the ocean cultivators corps had a cold expression on their faces.

...

“Hehe, don’t worry. Calm the people down and tell them not to worry!”

Wang Xian looked at Jin Qianyuan and the rest who were looking at him with a frown. A smile appeared on his face as he said nonchalantly.

Putting aside the fact that Feng Luan would arrive a few days later, was this fire fog formation useful?

The five elements were born in harmony. Fire gave birth to Earth, Earth gave birth to gold, and gold gave birth to water.

Alright, the fire fog formation had turned the entire Shenghai town into a space of the fire element. Under the interaction of the five elements, gold gave birth to water.

This was equivalent to this formation. On the contrary, it could make fire attribute cultivators cultivate faster.

Water Shortage?

Wang Xian’s water hazard explosion could cause the water in shenghai town to reach his ankles.

When he sensed the effect of this formation, Wang Xian almost wanted to laugh.

“Hehe!”

When Wang Xian thought of this, he couldn’t help but laugh.

Jin Qianyuan and the rest were slightly stunned when they saw Wang Xian’s smile. This...

It seemed that Lord Wang had a way to deal with this!

This made all of them smile and let out a heavy sigh of relief.

“It’s good that Lord Wang has a way to deal with this. We will appease the people!”

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly.

Feng Luan should be here in six to seven days!

The turmoil in Shenghai town quickly calmed down.

When everyone knew that Lord Wang Xian had a solution, everyone in the holy sea town relaxed.

Lord Wang Xian would not lie to them. They believed his words unconditionally.

This made everyone in the holy sea town smile again.

Some of the soldiers from the sea cultivators’army wanted to see the suffering of the people in the holy sea town. However, they realized that it was completely different from what they had imagined.

This made their faces sink again.

“Humph, just hang in there. Let’s see how many days you can last!”

“At most six or seven days. At that time, your tears will be your last drop of water!”

Some soldiers said with gloomy faces.

A week had passed, but there was still no sign of water shortage in holy sea town. This made everyone in the ocean cultivator corps look terrible.

Even Tsunami Sky’s face turned dark.

“What’s going on? The array formation isn’t broken. They didn’t take water from the underground with their powerful strength. Why is there still enough water?”

Tsunami sky was surprised.

“General, more than a thousand people are coming toward holy sea town from the East!”

At this moment, a soldier flew over and reported immediately.

“Someone is coming to Shenghai Town?”

Tsunami Sky looked to the east, his eyes shining!
