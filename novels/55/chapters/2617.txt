“It’s all because of your cultivation technique, master. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to break through so quickly!”

Bei Shuang came to Wang Xian’s side respectfully and said!

“Your talent is not bad!”

Wang Xian shook his head faintly and looked at the abyss on the right. “What’s the situation in the Abyss Now?”

“Master, there are a large number of abyss seeds in the Abyss that want to expand the Abyss and devour the time on our side. Our forces are resisting. There have been three battles in the past few days. Fortunately, there aren’t any strong abyss seeds appearing yet!”

Bei Shuang replied immediately!

“How many forces are guarding this place?”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the stars and continued to ask!

“There are many forces. There are four of them that are relatively strong. One of them is at the level of a great sect. Master, follow me. I will bring you to the star that I am guarding!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Bei Shuang said with a smile. She led Wang Xian towards the location in front of them!

“Elder Shuang!”

“Elder bei Shuang!”

When bei Shuang brought Wang Xian and the rest to the planet, some of them noticed her and greeted her respectfully. At the same time, they looked at Wang Xian and the rest curiously!

“Yes!”

Bei Shuang nodded her head lightly at the group of disciples. Ever since she displayed the level 7 immortal king combat strength, she had become an elder of the Bei Chuan sect!

The youngest elder!

“Who is that young man who is following bei Shuang? could he be elder bei Shuang’s boyfriend?”

“That’s possible. After all, elder bei Shuang is not young. However, that’s not right. I’ve never heard of elder bei Shuang having a boyfriend!”

“I don’t wish for our goddess of Frost to have a boyfriend!”

Seeing bei Shuang and the rest leave, some of the disciples whispered among themselves!

“Master, please take a seat!”

Bei Shuang brought Wang Xian to a study room and poured him a cup of tea. Then, she said respectfully!

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. “Bei Shuang, do you have any information about the abyss on the Demon Island? Let me take a look!”

“Master, I’ll send someone to search it. I’ll send it over to you later!”

Bei Shuang said immediately!

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded. Then, he opened his AI to check out the situation on the Demon Island!

Bei Shuang walked out immediately and ordered her disciple to check out the situation on the Demon Island and the Abyss!

“HMM? How many people does elder bei Shuang Welcome?”

Not far from the palace, Elder Gong was curious when he heard his disciple’s report!

“Elder bei Shuang doesn’t seem to know many people. Let’s go and take a look!”

Elder Gong hesitated for a moment and walked towards bei Shuang’s Palace!

“Elder bei Shuang, I heard that you have friends here?”

After arriving at bei Shuang’s residence, a disciple reported!

Seeing bei Shuang walk out, elder Gong asked with a smile!

“My Master Is Here!”

Bei Shuang looked at elder gong and said with a smile!

“Your master? That Dragon King?”

Elder Gong was slightly stunned, asking in shock!

Bei Chuan sect naturally knew bei Shuang’s master very well, a small galaxy leader, he seemed to be called the Dragon Palace!

According to the information they got, the Dragon Palace’s strength wasn’t weak, but it wasn’t strong either, the strongest undying god King Level 7!

With such strength, in his eyes, he wasn’t worthy of being bei Shuang’s master!

However, he had given bei Shuang the training method after all, even if his strength was the same as bei Shuang’s!

“Yes, what’s the Matter Elder Gong?”

Bei Shuang looked at him curiously!

“Nothing much, I’m just curious, I wanted to come over and get to know him!”

Elder Gong smiled and said!

“Well... I’ll ask Master!”

Bei Shuang hesitated for a moment and said to Elder Gong!

“Okay!”

Elder Gong nodded, but soon, bei Shuang walked out and shook her head apologetically!

“My master has some matters to attend to, and he may not have the time now. I’m sorry, Elder Gong!”

...

Bei Shuang said to him!

Elder Gong was slightly stunned, and then he smiled embarrassedly. “Since I don’t have the time, then forget it. I’ll go back First!”

As he spoke, he nodded at bei Shuang and turned around to leave!

“If it wasn’t for bei Shuang, the leader of a small galaxy faction, would he dare to reject me?”

Elder Gong left as he muttered to himself. He was slightly displeased!

However, even if he was displeased, he couldn’t show it. He still had to give face to bei Shuang!

At this moment, Wang Xian really didn’t have the time. As he looked at the various news regarding the abyss, he was deep in thought!

Now that the Demon Island had been devoured by the abyss, this was only one part of the battlefield. There were also several other battlefields!

However, the other places were further away!

“Dragon King, we can fight against the abyssal seeds together with the various forces here. This way, the risk is not high. Furthermore, we can obtain quite a number of abyssal seeds!”

In the room, Ao Jian looked at the documents and said to Wang Xian!

...

“Yes, that is indeed the case. We can kill the abyssal seed by the side when the war breaks out. I believe the other forces would be very happy to do so!”

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly and looked at the documents in his hands!

This document was the first and second list of names of the Beichuan sect who had fought against the fallen abyssal seed!

In the first two battles, more than 70 immortal godly monarchs had fallen. This number was not a small number!

However, compared to the abyss seed crystals they had obtained, it was completely acceptable!

If the Dragon Palace could obtain such a harvest even after losing more than 70 immortal godly monarchs, it would be a huge profit for the Dragon Palace!

“All the disciples of the Bei Chuan Sect, battle immediately!”

At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded!

Bei Shuang, who was at the side, frowned slightly!

“Master!”

She shouted at Wang Xian!

“Let’s go and take a look!”

Wang Xian nodded and flew out!

When they arrived at the entrance of the abyss, bei Shuang said to Wang Xian and flew straight into the Abyss!

Some of them looked at Wang Xian and the rest who were following bei Shuang curiously!

However, they didn’t pay too much attention to the fact that the abyss seeds were gathering again!

One by one, the disciples of the Bei Chuan sect rushed into the abyss. They immediately formed a formation and prepared for battle!

Soon, the battle erupted. One after another, the immortal King Eternal God abyss seeds rushed over!

Wang Xian didn’t enter the battlefield. Instead, he watched from the back!

At the front, millions of abyss seeds were attacking!

It was a fierce battle!

Regardless of whether it was the abyssal seeds or the humans, they would die if they were not careful!

If humans were killed, they would be devoured by the abyssal seeds!

Some abyssal seeds would even devour the corpses of the abyssal seeds that were killed!

The entire battle lasted for three hours. According to Wang Xian’s observation, there were 40,000 to 50,000 humans who died!

As for the abyssal seeds that died, there were 400,000 to 500,000 of them!

After killing 400,000 to 500,000 abyssal seeds, the humans retreated!

More than half of the corpses of the abyssal seeds were not brought back. They were devoured by the other abyssal seeds!

The abyssal seeds that were devoured had an obvious improvement!

“These abyssal seeds have a feeling of using battle to nourish themselves!”

Wang Xian looked ahead and mumbled!
