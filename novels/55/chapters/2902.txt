Chapter 2903: was backed by the power of the Dragon Palace

Time passed day by day. It had been a year since Prime Minister GUI reported about the war in the glazed area.

During the year, Wang Xian received some information from time to time.

The Dragon Palace was unusually lively today.

Because it was the Chinese New Year.

The Chinese New Year was a festival for Wang Xian on Earth.

Due to the rapid development of the Dragon Palace and the war in the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian and the rest did not spend much time on the New Year.

After a long time, his younger sister, Xiao Yu, and a group of girls suddenly mentioned that Wang Xian was going to hold a new year’s day.

The entire Dragon Island, which was located in the Imperial Star Field, was bustling with activity.

The people from the imperial star field did not know what day it was today. However, they knew that the Dragon King and the rest were going to celebrate the new year.

Although they didn’t understand, it made the entire dragon island unusually prosperous.

As the location of the Dragon Palace Master’s Dragon Palace, many people from the Heaven Wizard realm came here for holidays and fun.

Even people from bhang Liu he came to the imperial star area for fun.

Because of the rule of the Dragon Palace, bhang Liu he now had his own order. If he wanted to kill people for no reason, he had to pay the price.

With the suppression of the Dragon Palace, no one dared to offend them.

“It’s been a long time since the new year. I miss it so much!”

Inside the main dragon palace, lanterns and streamers were placed everywhere. Lady Ao led a group of maids from the Dragon Palace to set up the decorations.

Beside the underwater mountains in the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian and a group of girls were chatting as they walked.

“I really didn’t expect you to rise from a small civilized planet, Dragon King.”

At the side, Hong Fengyan said to Wang Xian and the rest with a face full of surprise.

“Hehe, I also didn’t expect that I would reach this stage after obtaining the Divine Dragon’s inheritance back then.”

Wang Xian said with a face full of smiles and sighed with emotion.

“Hehe, boss Wang, this is only the beginning. In the future, boss Wang will be a great existence who will unify the Universe!”

Invincible in battle tactics said flatteringly.

Tian Xin, who was beside him, patted him speechlessly.

“Hehe, let’s go out and take a look at the fireworks. After that, let’s have a meal together!”

Wang Xian smiled. The group of friends flew out of the Dragon Palace and arrived at the sky.

“Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!”

“Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!”

It was already dark outside. Numerous fireworks rose into the sky and erupted with brilliant brilliance, illuminating the entire Dragon Island.

On the Dragon Island, countless people were looking at the fireworks with curiosity and surprise.

Fireworks didn’t exist in the Imperial Star Field.

“Cheers!”

After admiring the fireworks, everyone went to the Dragon King’s palace and raised their glasses to drink.

Wang Xian raised his glass with a smile on his face to toast everyone.

Hong Fengyan, his disciples, his master, his girlfriend, Tianxin, and the others.

There were also the experts of the Dragon Palace.

“Oh?”

During the meal, the god Emperor of Shangshui took out his communication stone plate. He was slightly surprised when he saw the message on it.

“What’s wrong, Master?”

Invincible battle technique’s expression changed drastically when he saw that his master was very happy today. He frowned slightly and asked with concern.

“Master will go to the glazed domain later for the matters in the glazed domain.”

Shangshui divine emperor closed his eyes and said slowly.

“This… master, I will go with you!”

Invincible battle technique was stunned for a moment and then said.

“Don’t go. Stay in the Dragon Palace!”

Shangshui divine emperor looked at him and said.

“How can that be? Master, you go back to your hometown. As your disciple, how can I not go with you? Invincible battle technique is not an unfilial person. Master, you know very well that I have such a great quality!”

Invincible in battle technique raised his head and said to his master.

“Good, good!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The god Emperor of Shangshui patted his shoulder with gratification, and a smile appeared on his face.

“Brother Invincible, you…”

Beside him, Tian Xin called out softly.

“It’s okay. I will accompany Master for a trip. I will be back soon.”

Invincible in battle technique said to Tian Xin with relief.

“I haven’t been back for a million years. Hehe, come and have a drink!”

The divine emperor of Shangshui sighed and raised his wine glass to his disciple.

During the entire banquet, the rest of the people did not notice the conversation between the divine emperor of Shangshui and his disciple. Everyone was having a good time.

Two hours later, the banquet ended. A group of girls went to the streets of Dragon Island to take a stroll.

Wang Xian came to the study room next to the bedroom.

“Prime Minister Gui, what do you need to report?”

Sitting on the chair in the middle, Wang Xian looked at Prime Minister Gui and asked with a smile.

“Dragon King, there’s new news from the glazed area. The situation there is a little dangerous. A Day ago, five celestial emperors died in glazed area.”

Prime Minister Gui walked over and handed a document to Wang Xian.

Now that the Dragon Palace occupied three territories in the resplendent starry sky, it was necessary to understand the situation in the rest of the starry sky.

“Five celestial thearchs were killed?”

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly. “Is it that serious?”

“More than a dozen celestial thearchs from Yao Xie’s side attacked glazed area directly. The mechanical men from the Machine Empire even sent out a terrifying mechanical army to attack.”

“In order to deal with Yaoxie’s side, one celestial thearch died while four others from the Machine Emperor Domain died. The situation is a little serious.”

Prime Minister Gui said.

“Send Ao Yao and the rest to understand the strength of Yaoxie and the Machine Emperor Domain. We have to make preparations in advance.”

Wang Xian instructed Prime Minister Gui.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded.

Machine royal territory and Chimei territory were the enemies of humans. Although they were far away, the Dragon Palace still had to make some preparations.

“Boss Wang!”

At this moment, the voice of invincible battle technique came from outside.

“HMM? Come In!”

Wang Xian looked over and said immediately.

“Boss Wang, I’m here to bid you farewell.”

Invincible battle technique walked in and said to Wang Xian.

“Say Goodbye? Where are you going?”

Wang Xian looked at him and asked curiously.

“I’m going on a long trip to the glazed domain.”

Invincible battle technique replied.

“What are you going to the glazed domain for?”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned when he heard his words. A look of astonishment appeared on his face.

“Boss Wang, you don’t know. My Master is actually a disciple of glazed domain. He has been a disciple for generations. I heard that my master seems to have a conflict with his father and his family. He hasn’t returned for a million years.”

“It seems that something has happened in the glazed domain. My master wants to go back, so I’m going there as well.”

Invincible said.

“The god Emperor of Shangshui is Liu Li’s Man?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at invincible.

“Go to the glazed domain and pay attention to your safety.”

He reminded.

“Don’t worry, boss Wang. With the dragon weapons you gave me, there won’t be any danger. Moreover, the glazed domain is very powerful. Although there is a war there, my safety is still guaranteed.”

Invincible combat technique patted his chest.

“Hehe, I’ll lend this to you for self-defense.”

Wang Xian smiled. With a wave of his arm, the immortal slaying calabash on the ancestral tree appeared in his hand. He extended his palm and spoke to invincible combat technique.
