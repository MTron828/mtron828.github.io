Chapter 1012: Nest 10

Translator: 5496903

Wang Xian led a group of members of the Dragon Palace to hunt unscrupulously in the territory of the wind-winged savage fish.

In just over ten hours, the various weapons, equipment, and materials were stored in two interspatial rings.

According to his calculations, the items in his hands were worth at least 100 million spirit stones.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Just as Wang Xian was continuing his search in the passageway, the sound of wind whistling suddenly came from the passageway.

“What is this?”

Wang Xian frowned slightly. This kind of wind whistling was known from the memory of the soul-sucking wind-winged savage fish. It was a way to contact the species of the wind-winged savage fish.

“Is there something wrong? Or did so many people enter their territory and get discovered by them?”

Wang Xian thought to himself as he looked ahead.

After walking forward for half an hour, Wang Xian actually encountered more than 20 wind-winged savage fish in the tunnel.

A thoughtful look appeared on his face as he casually destroyed them

After destroying them, Wang Xian continued to move forward.

“The wind-wing savage fish actually came out of the cave in this passage. It seems that something must have happened!”

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and saw a group of more than 10 wind-wing savage fish walking forward in a passage at the side.

He hesitated for a moment and watched them leave his sight.

“Follow them. They should be heading to the largest nest!”

Wang Xian immediately broke through the walls of the passageway and entered the passageway where the more than a dozen wind-wing savage fish were.

“Follow behind and don’t make any noise!”

Wang Xian reminded the members of the Dragon Palace. He stared ahead and locked onto the group of wind-wing savage fish.

They were traveling at a very fast speed. When they encountered a fork in the road, they would immediately make a choice.

Clearly, they were traveling with a purpose.

Wang Xian had been following behind them for 500 meters. Due to the complexity of the passage, the group of wind-wing savage fish did not notice their tracking.

After walking for more than an hour, more than 100 wind-wing savage fish appeared in his line of sight.

Among them, there were more than 10 wind-wing savage fish whose bodies were emitting a pure green glow. They were very different from the level-six extraordinary fish that he had killed.

According to Wang Xian’s senses, these were level-seven extraordinary wind-wing savage fish.

“Why are there so many wind-wing savage fish here?”

The group of wind-wing savage fish stopped. Following that, under his astonished gaze, they actually disappeared into the wall beside them.

Strange, very strange!

“What is that? Is it a formation?”

Wang Xian revealed a shocked expression.

The light and dark fire dragon eyes could not penetrate that area. Obviously, if it was a formation, its level would definitely not be lower than transcendent level eight, or even higher.

“Ao Yao, go and take a look. Be careful!”

Wang Xian withdrew his contempt for the wind-winged savage fish and ordered Ao Yao.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao nodded and walked towards the walls of the passageway ahead.

His body moved and entered the passageway directly.

“It’s really a formation. However, Ao Yao who possesses the shadowless divine ability can ignore the formation!”

Wang Xian stood there and waited quietly.

In less than ten seconds, Ao Yao’s figure returned to his side.

“Dragon King, the position in front is a formation. There are still many passageways within the formation. I didn’t see the wind-winged savage fish. They should have gone deeper.”.

“Ao Jian, all of you wait here!”

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment and said to Ao Jian.

Both he and the strange demon had the talent to ignore the formation. They wouldn’t be repelled or sensed by the formation when they entered.

“Alright, Dragon King!”

Ao Jian and the rest nodded and waited on the spot.

Wang Xian walked forward. He walked to the wall and walked straight in.

Once he entered, there was still a passageway. He immediately looked through the Dragon Eyes of light and dark fire.

“It’s really secretive. Apart from the formation, there are three more passageways!”

Wang Xian was amazed. As expected of a demonic beast that was comparable to humans in terms of intelligence. They hid themselves so that even a void interpretation stage powerhouse wouldn’t be able to find them.

He walked in carefully.

Before he entered, he saw four to five hundred wind-winged savage fish walking out. Moreover, there were over a thousand huge caracal boas around them.

Their faces were filled with violent murderous intent.

“Damn humans. How dare they step into the territory of our wind-winged savage fish and eat them!”

“There are many more humans than before. Their strength is not to be underestimated. However, they should be able to have a good meal. Roar Roar!”

Some of the wind-winged savage fish spoke the language of humans with ferocious expressions.

Among the group of wind-winged savage fish, there were about twenty pure-green demonic beasts.

Wang Xian’s gaze slowly shifted to the spot where they came out from.

“A demonic beast of supernatural level 8. That should be the wind-winged savage fish of supernatural level 8!”

A huge nest appeared in his line of sight. Wang Xian looked at the huge nest. There was a four-meter-long wind-winged savage fish lying on the high platform in the middle.

Beside it was a 14-to 15-meter-long anaconda with a ferocious aura

There were more than ten pure green wild-winged fish over there.

This cave was extremely huge. It had an area of at least three to four kilometers.

Each cave looked like a luxurious house.

At the back, there was a stone statue. The stone statue was a ten-meter-tall wild-winged fish. This stone statue was covered with a layer of green items

“This should be the lair of the windwing rampaging fish!”

A hint of excitement flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes as he sized up the place.

There was a windwing rampaging fish that was at least at transcendent level eight and thirteen windwing pomfret fish that were at transcendent level seven.

There was also a group of powerful brocade scale boas.

“That’s the leader. The treasures of the windwing rampaging fish should be here!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled.

A few hundred wind-winged savage fish were obviously dealing with some matters. This was the best time to attack!

Let’s get the treasures first

Wang Xian thought to himself. He waved his hand at Ao Yao and the rest and walked towards the huge nest of the wind-winged savage fish.

“Prepare for an assassination!”

In order to prevent further complications, Wang Xian ordered ao Yao to go in for an assassination.

He followed behind and sneaked in carefully.

“Attack!”

Standing in front of the entrance of the nest of the wind-winged savage fish, Wang Xian immediately gave the order.

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

In an instant, the sound of claws entering one’s body could be heard from inside.

“Roar! Roar! Despicable humans! I didn’t expect you humans to barge in!”

Suddenly, when Ao Yao’s attack landed on the leader of the wind-winged savage fish who was lying on a high platform, a green energy instantly formed a protective barrier around it.

The AOYAO’s claws were instantly blocked. Its crocodile-like head swiftly and fiercely attacked the aoyao.

“Humans have entered. Kill them!”

In addition, a few wind-winged savage fish that had not been attacked roared.
