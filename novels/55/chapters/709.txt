“Student Mu Zidao is obviously student Feng. Look at the school forum. Those seniors are really detestable. They actually said that someone is even more handsome than the two of you!”

In one of the classrooms in the school, the bell rang after class. The enchanting girl took her phone and ran to the two young men in front of her.

One of the young men still had his hair tied up in ancient costumes, looking like a classical Prince Charming.

The other one had his eyebrows in pieces, exuding a lazy and otherworldly aura.

The enchanting girl seemed to be fawning over them as she showed them her post.

The two of them smiled. When they saw the girls fawning over them, their vanity was greatly satisfied.

Among the disciples of the immortal sect, the two of them could only be considered as relatively talented disciples.

Compared to the true heaven’s Pride Disciples of the Immortal sect and the eldest senior brother of the immortal sect, there was still a huge gap.

However, in this place, everyone was centered around them. Those praises and admiration were not stingy as they spoke to them.

“Let me take a look!”

The long-haired Ming Feng reached out his hand to take the phone. A single action caused the enchanting girl beside him to be pleasantly surprised.

“Mu Zidao and Ming Feng, we have already spoken up for you guys on the Forum. How can that Wang Xian compare to you guys!”

“That’s right, that’s right. We, Mu Zidao and Ming Feng, can only pick the stars with one hand. How can a guy with a little money be compared to us!”

Around them, a group of girls in the classroom immediately surrounded them and chattered excitedly.

This made the two of them extremely satisfied.

“An ordinary person. There’s nothing that can compare to us!”

Ming Feng took a look and indifferently handed his phone to the enchanting girl beside him.

“Student Ming Feng, those seniors are simply too detestable. You guys should teach that Wang Xian a good lesson and let those seniors know the difference between him and you guys!”

The enchanting girl pretended to be angry as she spoke.

Mu Zidao waved his hand and raised his head slightly. “Our immortal sect has a rule that we can’t attack ordinary people. In other words, he doesn’t have the qualifications!”

“He doesn’t have the qualifications?”

“That’s right. Mu Zidao, Student Mingfeng is right. That Wang Xian doesn’t have the qualifications to be on par with all of you!”

Some of the girls around hurriedly spoke.

“Senior brother Mu, senior brother Ming!”

However, at this moment, a voice came from outside.

“Eh? Junior Brother Liang, what’s the matter?”

Mu Zidao looked behind curiously and waved his hand.

The girls around immediately dispersed.

“Senior Brothers!”

The young man walked in. He was the young man who was called Senior Brother Liang in the martial arts club.

At this moment, he walked over with a sullen face and said with an embarrassed expression, “Senior brothers, can we talk outside?”

Mu Zidao and Ming Feng saw his expression and hesitated for a moment. Then, they nodded slowly and walked out.

...

“You Mean?”

When they heard the young man’s report, the corners of their lips curled up slightly. “Interesting. Dragon King of the Dragon Gate? He used to be a force in the jianghu. If there’s a chance, we can go and meet him!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Oh right, what’s his name?”

“I think his name is Wang Xian. He’s very famous in the school!”

“Wang Xian?”

Immediately, Mu Zidao and Ming Feng were stunned. Then, a teasing expression appeared on their faces. “Interesting, really interesting!”

“Haha, I didn’t expect him to be a martial artist. Is this considered a clash between the influential figures of the new and old schools?”

Mu Zidao laughed out loud. His eyes were filled with interest as if he had found a fun game.

“We can’t disappoint those who support us!”

Obviously, Feng touched the long sword in his hand and took out a phone. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

The youth was slightly stunned when he heard the words of his two senior brothers. He didn’t understand what they meant.

However, when he saw his two senior brothers enter the classroom, he didn’t dare to ask further.

However, when he returned to the classroom and listened to the conversations of the students around him, a ferocious look of excitement appeared on his face.

“Your strength is relatively strong, but senior brother Mu Zidao and Ming Feng both have the strength of the peak of the Dan stage. This time, you will be in trouble. You are a force in the jianghu that broke through the Dragon Gate. What Dragon King? You actually dare to fight against us disciples of the immortal sect. You are simply courting death!”

His eyes were filled with ferocity and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

At this moment, a message on the school forum had caused a stir among everyone.

“I didn’t expect senior Wang Xian to be a pugilistic world martial artist. Let’s spar when we have the time!”

It was a very casual sentence, but the person who posted it was Mu Zidao.

When the students of the school saw this post, they were stunned.

Especially those students who were in their third year and fourth year, their faces were filled with anger and self-reproach.

“Mu Zidao actually wants to challenge senior Wang Xian. This... This is simply bullying!”

“He, a member of the immortal sect, actually dares to bully senior Wang Xian. This is too unfair!”

“He is too despicable. He actually, actually did such a despicable thing!”

A group of students who were in their third year and fourth year replied below. However, they were quickly met with a group of retorts!

“Your Prince Charming Wang Xian is a martial artist. Didn’t you guys say that he is the most influential person in the school? It’s a good opportunity for him to spar with our student Mu Zidao!”

“Haha, that’s right. Why are you guys so cowardly? Isn’t he the most powerful person in your hearts?”

“Hehe, our student Mu Zidao wants to teach your Prince Charming a lesson. He wants to know if you are afraid!”

Those first-year and second-year girls ridiculed them to the extreme, almost causing the third-year and fourth-year students to go berserk.

“Our student Mu Zidao can cripple that Wang Xian with a single finger!”

“Without using a single finger, our student Mu Zidao is standing there exuding the aura of a powerhouse. Maybe that Wang Xian will kneel down!”

“I hope that Wang Xian doesn’t cower and spar with our student Mu Zidao!”

Gradually, the entire forum was filled with such voices.

“F * ck! F * ck! F * ck!”

At this moment, Wang Dahai walked out of the martial arts club and noticed what was happening on the forum. His face revealed an angry expression.

“F * ck! You, Mu Zidao, want to spar with the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate? You’re simply courting death!”

“If it wasn’t for me and you, the immortal sect, I would have pasted on you long ago. F * ck!”

As he spoke, he ran towards the top of the teaching building.

“Boss, Old Wang!”

When he reached the top of the building, Wang Dahai saw Wang Xian sitting comfortably on it and immediately ran over.

“What’s wrong? Your cold senior sister asked you to come out!”

Wang Xian looked at Wang Dahai and said with a smile.

“Hey, those guys are too arrogant. They think that the disciples of the immortal sect are superior to others. What’s so great about them? They’re not as awesome as you, Old Wang!”

Wang Dahai smiled. “That senior brother Liu is even worse. He saw that you might have some prestige, so he wanted to step on you. In the end, he was simply courting death!”

“Oh right, Old Wang, there’s another guy provoking you in the school forum. He’s an elite disciple of our immortal sect, with the strength of the peak of the Dan Stage!”

“F * ck them. Let them know how powerful and terrifying the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate is. Make that Guy Tremble!”
