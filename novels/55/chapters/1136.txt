Chapter 1137: 1138 feud

Translator: 5496903

In star-moon kingdom, the current King was a peak existence at the fourth level of the void interpretation realm.

A void interpretation expert possessed a lifespan of a thousand years. As a king, he could have several hundred descendants.

The third prince was only one of them. He had over a hundred brothers and sisters.

Although their father was young now, all the princes had to think about their future.

The third Prince’s current extraordinary eighth rank cultivation was not bad among the princes, but he was still far from inheriting the throne.

At the very least, he had to break through to the profound void tier before he had the right to inherit the throne.

However, to become a profound void tier powerhouse, even if he was a prince, it would be very difficult. He might not even be able to advance to the profound void tier in his entire life.

He was not confident, but if he could obtain the frost fire civet cat’s cub, he would be able to ascend to the heavens in a single step.

In history, the strongest frost fire civet cat had reached the fifth level of the void interpretation realm. Its strength at the fifth level was already higher than his father’s.

If he obtained the frost fire civet cat, then in the future, even if he had not reached the void interpretation realm, the throne of star-moon kingdom would still belong to him.

No one had the ability to compete with him.

This was also the instant he saw the ice fire civet cat, the roar of desire and loss of self-control.

“Ice Fire Civet Cat!”

The two elders next to the third prince were slightly stunned, and then their eyes revealed a fiery expression.

They naturally knew about the ice fire civet cat, and they also knew what the ice fire civet cat was surprised by for their third prince.

Originally, the third prince was one of the advantageous competitors for the throne. They were willing to follow the third prince because they hoped that he could inherit the throne.

But now, as long as the third prince obtained the ice fire civet cat, he would be able to obtain the throne with 100% certainty.

This was extremely important to them.

“Hand over the Demon Beast Cub in your hands. Otherwise, you can forget about escaping even if you go to the heavens or the earth!”

The two old men roared coldly. Their bodies moved and they chased after them at a terrifying speed.

The third Prince’s eyes were also burning with excitement.

“F * ck, they are still chasing after us. Since I have taken it away, why would I let you guys take it back?”

Wang Xian looked at the group of people who were chasing after him at a fast speed. A hint of coldness appeared on his face.

He sped up and ran straight towards the beach.

“Fire pattern roar!”

“Arcane Art Traction!”

At this moment, two cold voices came from behind him. Wang Xian instantly felt two terrifying attacks coming towards him.

Fire patterns that were like fire snakes interweaved in the sky and attacked Wang Xian rapidly.

Under the ground, thorns emerged from the ground and twined around his body.

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly. The two half-step void interpretation stage powerhouses launched their attacks directly. Even he had to use his full strength to deal with them.

Especially in his human form, it was a little troublesome.

“Earth Dragon Shield!”

His body shook and pieces of earthy yellow dragon scales appeared faintly on his body. Following that, the dragon scales floated up and surrounded him.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The Flames and Thorns landed on the Earth Dragon Shield, causing it to tremble violently.

The Earth Dragon Shield was Wang Xian’s only defensive ability.

Crack! Crack

“This is bad. I can’t block it unless I transform into a divine dragon!”

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly. However, if he were to transform into a divine dragon, his identity would be exposed instantly.

When he was in Shenghai town, everyone knew that he could transform into a huge demonic beast. The experts from star-moon kingdom would also know about it.

Once they knew about it, they would definitely kill him.

“Damn it!”

Wang Xian’s entire body trembled. Numerous scales appeared on his body and he took the remaining attacks head-on.

“PFFT!”

A mouthful of fresh blood couldn’t help but be spat out from Wang Xian’s mouth.

“Meow!”

However, when Wang Xian spat out the fresh blood, the ice fire civet cat in his embrace revealed an excited expression. It moved its mouth slightly and sucked the fresh blood into its mouth.

“Meow!”

Its blue and fiery red eyes stared at Wang Xian’s mouth excitedly. It couldn’t help but lick its tongue.

Wang Xian was slightly speechless when he saw this scene.

“If he is still running away, kill him!”

At this moment, the third Prince’s furious roar came from behind.

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly. A hint of killing intent could be seen in his eyes.

“Since you want to die, I shall fulfill your wish!”

Wang Xian could guess that the identity of the young man was definitely not simple. It might even be related to the royal family of star-moon kingdom. However, at this moment, he was tempted to kill him.

“Go to a strange demon and kill him!”

Wang Xian ordered directly.

“Yes!”

A strange demon of transcendent level 9 responded immediately.

The third prince was only at transcendent level 8. It was more than enough for a strange demon to assassinate him.

Wang Xian moved his body and quickly dodged a ferocious beast in front of him. He continued to run forward.

Buzz

“Who, who is it? Who Dares to assassinate me? !”

In less than two seconds, a furious voice came from behind.

The third prince, who was chasing after Wang Xian, was emitting a golden glow. The glow completely enveloped his body.

At this moment, he was looking around in fear.

In the instant just now, he felt the threat of death. This caused him to be filled with fear.

If he didn’t have the protection of the void interpretation level armor on his body, he would have turned into a corpse by now.

This caused him to break out in a cold sweat. He shouted out loud in fear.

In the instant just now, he didn’t even see clearly whether the person who tried to assassinate him was a human or a ferocious beast.

“Third prince, what’s Going On?”

“Third Prince!”

The expressions of the two half-step void interpretation stage powerhouses who were chasing after Wang Xian changed drastically. They hurriedly looked behind them.

“Someone is trying to assassinate me. Don’t bother about me. Chase after him!”

The third Prince looked at the armor on his body and looked ahead. When he saw Wang Xian’s disappearing figure, his eyes turned bloodshot again as he shouted loudly.

“Oh no, he’s going to escape!”

The two elders turned their heads and looked at him with an embarrassed expression. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The third Prince’s expression changed drastically. He gritted his teeth and took out a small cyan knife from his interspatial ring.

The small knife was spinning with cyan light. The moment the small knife appeared, the surrounding space seemed to tremble.

“Go to hell! I must get the ice fire civet cat!”

The third prince ferociously attacked Wang Xian with the small green knife.

Buzz

The small green knife trembled slightly and began to rotate violently.

When the two old men saw this scene, their faces revealed a pained expression.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

The small green knife rotated and attacked Wang Xian at a terrifying speed.

The densely packed ferocious beasts that were blocking in front of them instantly revealed a look of fear.

However, before they could react, the cyan knife pierced through their bodies and continued to attack forward.

“Quick, go and bring the ice fire civet cat over. Help him collect his corpse. I want to see what he looks like!”
