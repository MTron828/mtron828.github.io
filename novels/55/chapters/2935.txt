Chapter 2936: armory region’s treasure 3

“Prime Minister Gui, the Devouring Dragon’s improvement this time is huge. Our Dragon Palace has produced many divine emperors.”

Around the battlefield of the Armory region, the Dragon Palace’s 500,000 legions were guarding the surroundings. A group of Dragon Palace’s Divine Emperors gathered together.

They looked at the devouring dragons that were crazily devouring various mechanical legions with envy as they asked Prime Minister Gui.

“The improvement this time is very terrifying. This is the accumulation of more than a billion years in the entire machine royal territory.”

!!

“But just now, the Dragon King sent me a message saying that I might not be able to contact him for the time being. The Dragon King is now following the creator. According to the Dragon King, the creator seems to have a trump card.”

Prime Minister Gui said with a smile.

“The Creator has a trump card? No Way? Does that mean that there are still a lot of resources in the Machine Royal Territory?”

Mo Sha could not help but ask.

“As an existence that has ruled this area for more than a billion years, how could he not have a special trump card? I guess the Creator has a secret base for backup.”

Prime Minister Gui nodded.

“Doesn’t that mean that ao crab and the others will get a lot of resources in the future?”

Ba Qi and the others could not help but say.

“More or less!”

Prime Minister Gui said faintly.

“Ao crab and the others are going to make a comeback!”

“When these guys improve, let them be our coolies!”

“That’s right, that’s right. Let them help us find resources. I’m really sore now!”

The Godly monarchs of the dragon palace sighed and guarded the surroundings to prevent anyone from disturbing the progress of the devouring dragon.

Meanwhile, in the center of the machine royal territory, Wang Xian continued to follow the exceptionally cautious creator with a dark expression.

Time passed day by day.

When the Dragon Palace was conquering the machine royal territory, the glazed area was prepared to launch a counterattack after two months of preparation.

Two months ago, the Dragon Palace had invaded the machine imperial region and resolved the crisis in the VELURIYAM domain.

The domain Lord had led all the soldiers back to the center of the VELURIYAM domain.

This matter had also caused a stir in the entire VELURIYAM domain.

However, during these two months, the VELURIYAM domain army had gathered together and the three divine emperors of the Holy Region had come to help.

After two months of investigation and gathering all sorts of information, the VELURIYAM domain was preparing to attack the demons of the chimei domain.

They would kill all the demonic demons that entered their glazed domain and hide in a domain that did not belong to the glazed domain.

This was not a small matter. After all, they had decided to hunt more than ten divine emperor demonic demons.

After two months of preparation, countless experts and soldiers gathered in a starry sky near the chimei domain in the glazed domain.

A battle platform that spanned tens of billions of kilometers gathered the elites of the entire glazed domain.

“This time, our goal is to destroy all of the demonic beasts in the glazed domain. Not a single one will be spared!”

In the meeting room at the center of the battle platform, including the three divine emperors of the sacred domain, there were a total of thirty-one divine emperors sitting inside.

The leader of the Domain Lords spoke to all the divine emperors with a cold expression.

The sudden invasion of the demonic beasts of the chimei domain had caught their glazed domain off guard and directly killed five divine emperors.

Moreover, there were more than ten planets where humans had encountered Yaoxie’s hunt.

This time, they were prepared to counterattack and destroy all the invading Yaoxie.

“Yes! Domain lord, if it wasn’t for the mechanical imperial region intentionally pressuring us, with our strength, we would have been able to kill the Chimei region seven times in and seven times out!”

“Kill, kill all Yaoxie and avenge brother Shangshui and the others!”

“Governor, with our strength, it will be easy to kill the invading demonic emperors. I suggest that we attack the chimei territory and kill them until they are scared out of their wits!”

“That’s right! Avenge our dead soldiers!”

The glazed domain God emperors roared with killing intent.

“Let’s finish off the demonic beasts that invaded our glazed domain first.”

The domain Lord leaned back on his chair and said indifferently.

“Domain lord, if the dragon palace can really sweep through and heavily injure the machine royal territory, I think we can kill our way into the Chi Mei territory and make those beasts pay the price!”

A god emperor from the glazed domain said with a cold expression.

“Oh right, domain lord, how’s the situation at the Dragon Palace? There hasn’t been any news for two months!”

The Grand Supreme Elder couldn’t help but ask.

“There hasn’t been any news from the Dragon Palace yet. I just sent a message to the Dragon King, but he hasn’t replied!”

The domain Lord replied, his gaze sweeping the surroundings. “This time, we will first take care of the demonic beasts in our domain and those outside. When the time comes, we will act according to the situation. After all, the chimei territory has been in great turmoil recently!”

“Order all the soldiers to prepare to set off. We will make those beasts pay with blood for this battle!”

“Yes, Governor!”

“Yes, Governor!”

The moment the governor’s order was given, all the experts and core disciples in the entire glazed domain began to move.

They charged towards demonic beasts in an imposing manner.

It was naturally easy for them to dispatch the forces of the glazed domain to deal with those demonic beasts.

In the next few days, the glazed domain received many reports of success.

In just half a month, the glazed domain had killed eight god-emperor-level demonic beasts, and there were countless demonic beasts of other levels. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Demon Caves were destroyed one by one, and not a single demonic beast escaped.

The territory occupied by the demonic beasts was quickly taken back.

However, a month later, when the glazed domain army was about to reach the border of the chimei territory, an accident suddenly happened.

When all the people of the glazed domain thought that they could sweep through the chimei territory, and when countless people and soldiers on the computer asked to kill their way into the chimei territory.

At the border of the Chimei territory, an enormous demon cave suddenly appeared.

The entire demon cave was the size of more than ten planets, dozens of times the size of an ordinary demon cave.

From time to time, terrifying roars could be heard from the Deep Demon Cave.

The warriors of the glazed domain were about to arrive at the border. However, countless demons and monsters surged out from the demon cave.

Among them, there were more than 20 god Emperor level demons and monsters.

However, this was not the most important thing. The most important thing was that there was a leader in the Demon Cave, a rank three void God Emperor leader.

That rank three void God Emperor led his demonic army and a huge battle broke out with the glazed domain.

During that huge battle, the glazed domain had the upper hand, but they were unable to defeat that demonic race.

This made everyone in the glazed domain feel extremely embarrassed.

“Who would have thought that this chimei domain is also very ferocious. There should be more than 30 demonic god emperors around. If not for the fact that we have killed about 10 of them, it would still be a huge problem. This glazed domain is too dangerous!”

One and a half months later, invincible stood on the battle platform and looked at the void in front of him.

At first, he thought that with all the strength of the glazed domain, it would be very easy to kill Yaoxie and there wouldn’t be any danger.

This made him personally go on the battlefield to kill some Yaoxie from time to time.

However, the battle yesterday made him shiver.
