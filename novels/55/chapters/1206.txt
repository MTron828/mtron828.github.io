Chapter 1207: 1208 sword King’s inheritance

Translator: 5496903

Wang Xian swung the level five sword in his hand. A hint of surprise appeared on his face.

It was a pity that with his current strength, he was unable to unleash the power of this sword. He could only use it as a weapon that surpassed the level of half-step void interpretation.

“This sword seems to have two attributes!”

Wang Xian touched it and felt the sharpness and softness of the sword ray. It should be metal and water attributes.

He looked at the corpse and took a book from his bosom.

“The inheritance of the sword King!”

Looking at the cover of the book, Wang Xian flipped it open.

“I am the Sword King Leng haocang, the sword king of the Blood Stream sect. My swordsmanship is invincible in the flowing sea region. However, I was born at the wrong time and the Blood Stream sect was in chaos. I can not suppress the blood stream. I regret being born twenty years later. Otherwise, I will suppress everything!”

Wang Xian looked at the contents of the book and curled his lips slightly. This Leng haocang was really good at acting cool.

Regardless of whether it was his deliberately mystifying voice when he just entered the door or the records on the words, there was a strong sense of acting cool.

However, when Wang Xian continued reading, he raised his eyebrows slightly and his eyes flickered.

Leng haocang was 83 years old when he died. Among the insightful emptiness realm experts, he was definitely an extremely young and demonic existence.

And the 83-year-old Leng haocang was not at the first level of the insightful emptiness realm, but had reached the fifth level of the insightful emptiness realm.

At that time, Leng Haocang was called a rare genius by the blood stream sect. He would definitely suppress the entire sky in the future.

Leng Haocang’s most terrifying aspect was not only his level, but also the attributes he cultivated, dual attributes, metal and water.

Other than that, there was also his terrifying sword arts.

The title of Sword King was not self-proclaimed.

A peerless swordsman who cultivated dual attributes at the age of 83 was at level five of the Seethrough realm. At that time, his status was only second to a few top-notch figures.

Such a peerless swordsman was harmed by demonic beasts when the blood stream sect was separated. He had no choice but to return to his sword mansion and set up it as a land of inheritance.

“Peerless Sword King, dual attributes. With the strength of level five of the Seethrough realm, he could kill a level six Seethrough realm. This Leng Haocang is truly peerless and talented!”

Wang Xian looked at the records and his eyes were filled with amazement.

If he was born 20 years earlier, he would really have the strength to suppress everything.

What could he do!

“The Golden Water Sword Principle!”

Wang Xian flipped back and saw Leng Haocang’s inherited sword techniques. They were all sword techniques.

Among them, there were many powerful sword techniques that were combined with dual attributes.

The golden water principle!

One was extremely hard and the other extremely soft. Both were hard and soft at the same time.

Wang Xian flipped through the pages and realized that Leng haocang’s metal and water sword principle was slightly different from his two attributes combination. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

To be more precise, Leng Haocang’s two attributes combination was even more exquisite.

This gave him a lot of inspiration.

“My sword principle can only be inherited by a heaven’s favorite who possesses both metal and water attributes. Without both metal and water attributes, one can not enter the sword tomb. I hope that my successor can pass down my sword principle and carry it forward!”

Looking at Leng Haocang’s last sentence, Wang Xian was slightly moved.

“Although I possess both metal and water attributes, I might not be able to carry it forward. If I have the chance to meet a genius with both metal and water attributes in sword principle, I will pass this inheritance of yours to him!”

Wang Xian sighed and walked straight into the sword mansion.

The strong were respected.

Although Wang Xian initially felt that Leng Haocang was a little pretentious, it seemed that he did have the ability to do so.

However, as a divine dragon, it was unrealistic for him to acknowledge him as his master and promote the golden water sword principle.

Wang Xian walked straight into the sword mansion. According to Leng haocang’s records, there was a sword training ground in the sword mansion that contained rich energy of the dual-elemental metal and water.

In addition, all of his treasures were stored here.

Wang Xian took a stroll around the sword mansion. The sword training ground was located in a sword training room beside the corpse.

Leng haocang left behind a few items. He was a swordsman who had almost gone crazy. There were no spiritual herbs, pets, or mounts in the sword mansion.

Even the spiritual liquid was depleted when he was severely injured.

There were only swords. There were a total of eighteen of them. They were the longswords that he had used from the beginning of his sword training until his death.

From ordinary iron swords to the third level of the Seethrough realm.

However, what pleased Wang Xian was that Leng Haocang’s interspatial ring contained a lot of metals and materials used to forge longswords.

“The harvest is not bad. If I sell the items I obtained from these four mansions, I will definitely be able to raise my strength to the ninth level of the extraordinary realm. There might even be some left over!”

Wang Xian looked at the items in his interspatial ring and grinned.

The treasures left behind by the four insightful emptiness realm experts, along with Hua Zhen’s interspatial ring and Heavenly Sword Star’s interspatial ring, were worth more than one trillion middle-grade spirit stones.

Of course, there was a prerequisite. He had to sell all the insightful emptiness realm weapons.

This included the weapons at the insightful emptiness realm.

Wang Xian was not in a hurry to leave. Instead, he came to the sword training room of the golden water sword principle.

He possessed both the metal and water attributes. He could definitely cultivate the golden water sword principle. Furthermore, from the swordsmanship of the Leng haocang Sword King, he could deepen his understanding of the combination of attributes.

When he entered the sword training room, the rich metal and water attributes flooded in. The entire sword training room was filled with two types of longswords, the metal and water, dancing in the sky.

Sometimes, when the metal and water swords collided, special changes would occur.

In this room, one had to dodge the attacks of the metal and water swords and comprehend the usage of the two types of sword techniques.

When Wang Xian entered, he immediately started to cultivate.

Sword in the water!

Gold-piercing sword!

True Sword Rain!

Gold-plated sword pursuit!

Water flooded the Golden Mountain!

After an unknown period of time, the sword techniques of the metal and water sword principle were mastered by Wang Xian.

The deeper Wang Xian cultivated, the deeper his perception towards the combination of attributes was.

“Phew!”

Wang Xian, who had stayed in the sword training room for at least half a month, walked out. He revealed a faint smile on his face. He moved a chair and sat at the entrance to rest.

“AH, I must succeed. I must avenge my family!”

At this moment, a determined roar came from outside.

Wang Xian was stunned for a moment. A look of astonishment appeared on his face. His eyes flickered as he looked outside.

A skinny young man was carrying a two-meter-long sword on his back as he walked into the sword mansion with great difficulty.

His body was filled with wounds. The terrifying sword rays that contained two types of energy — gold and water — were constantly attacking him.

The skinny young man only had the strength of a level nine extraordinary. However, the attacks that he unleashed were extremely powerful.

“Dual attributes. He has dual attributes as well. Furthermore, he has both metal and water attributes!”

Wang Xian looked at the energy fluctuation on the emaciated young man and was stunned.

The young man was only 50 meters away from the sword mansion. However, this 50 meters was like a natural moat.

“His swordsmanship skills are not enough. However, he will be able to step into the sword mansion in a few months at most!”

“What a joke of fate. If I had not come, the inheritance and everything else in the sword mansion would have belonged to this young man!”
