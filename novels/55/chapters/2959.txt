Chapter 2960: glazed tile ceremony announced to the world

“Roar Roar Roar!”

Roars sounded in the void at the border of glazed tile region and chimei region.

Nine Wind Divine Dragons flapped their huge dragon wings and flew in the void.

Behind him was a dragon sedan that was ten thousand meters in size.

!!

There was a dragon chair in front of the Dragon Sedan, and no one was sitting on it.

On the left and right of the Dragon Chair stood Prime Minister Turtle’s Heaven Array and 10 Dragon Guards.

At the back, more than 10,000 dragon guards and their leaders lined up in a row and followed behind.

There were not many people in the entire team, but they were full of power.

Wang Xian and the rest ordered an lie to bring them to the demon cave in front of the boundary of the chimei territory in an instant. From there, they rushed to the center of the glazed domain.

With the guidance of the level three immortal king, the Divine Wind Dragon, they flew toward the center of the glazed area at a terrifying speed.

“I didn’t expect that the resplendent void would become the world of our Dragon Palace in such a short period of time!”

“Hehe, who would have thought that the citizens of the Heaven Wizard region, the Imperial Star Field, and the eight desolations and six harmonies would be so shocked when they found out that the holy region and the glazed area were ruled by our Dragon Palace? The entire AI was talking about it crazily.”

“This is all thanks to Little Xian. The Dragon King is mighty and can rule the world!”

In the Dragon Sedan, a group of girls were chatting with Wang Xian. Their faces were filled with happiness.

The Dragon Palace was so powerful now. Guan Shuqing, Hua Er, Cai er, and the other girls had broken through to the celestial thearch realm not long ago after obtaining powerful resources from the Dragon Palace.

The group of girls were enjoying themselves every day.

As the Empress of the Dragon and Phoenix Divine Dynasty, they could also be said to be the spokespersons of the Dragon Palace. They were in charge of the two major regions. This time, they were specially invited to the VELURIYAM domain’s celebration to show their respect.

After all, the domain Lord and the rest knew that if anything happened in the future, they would make friends with the Dragon Queens.

One could imagine the status of the wives of the Dragon Palace in the entire resplendent starry sky.

“Hehe, I’ll let you guys have more fun!”

Wang Xian said with a smile on his face.

“When can you accompany us to have fun?”

Ling Jian ‘er asked while holding his arm.

“I’ll accompany you guys to have a good time after dealing with the demon cave in the Chimei Domain!”

Wang Xian said while stroking her head.

“I heard that the holy region of the Veluriyam Capital is a relatively peaceful and beautiful star region. When the time comes, we will come up with a tourism plan!”

The group of girls spoke in high spirits.

Wang Xian was also very comfortable as he lay there.

“That is? That seems to be the nine divine dragons from the Dragon Palace. They are pulling a dragon sedan. Is that the Dragon King?”

“What a powerful force! The nine divine dragons are holding the Dragon Sedan!”

“This time, the VELURIYAM domain is holding a celebration to thank the Dragon Palace. In the future, the VELURIYAM domain will be a subsidiary of the Dragon Palace. In the future, the Dragon Palace will be the leader and the Dragon King will be the king.”

“The Dragon King has helped us solve the crisis in the chimei domain of the machine emperor domain and saved countless of us. It is a great favor for the VELURIYAM domain. We should submit to the Dragon Palace.”

In the starry sky outside, some planets looked in awe when they saw the nine divine dragons flying.

The Divine Dragons flew quickly and arrived at the center of the glazed area after more than ten hours. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The foundation of the glazed area had been destroyed by evil this time, but now it had completely recovered.

Countless people were gathered here in the vast and prosperous center.

Tomorrow was the VELURIYAM domain’s celebration. In order to celebrate the passing of this crisis, all the experts in the entire VELURIYAM domain had gathered.

Over at the sacred domain, the sacred master and a group of Divine Emperors had all arrived.

Apart from that, a few divine emperors who had received the news from the eight desolation six directions had also rushed over.

There were even divine emperors who had received the news from the heaven punishment ancient sky domain who had rushed over.

Now, the entire resplendent starry sky knew that the glazed domain and the saint domain had to submit to the Dragon Palace, with the Dragon King as their king.

What kind of concept was this?

With the seven great domains and the eight desolations six directions, the Heaven Magus Empire’s imperial star domain’s eight desolations six directions was now directly controlled by the Dragon Palace, while the Machine Imperial region was destroyed by the Dragon Palace.

It was said that the chimei domain was also being swept away by the Dragon Palace.

The seven great domains submitted and swept away. Only the heaven punishment ancient sky domain was not swept away and submitted.

However, the Heaven’s punishment ancient heaven’s domain was not as strong as the saint domain. The Dragon Palace could send out an expert to sweep it away.

When they learned of this celebration, they naturally came to pay their respects to the Dragon King.

Furthermore, because the glazed domain was once the number one great domain, it was still the strongest existence apart from the Dragon Palace, even after the demonic invasion of the chimei domain.

During their celebration, the Divine Emperors from the holy region and the eight desolate six directions had long rushed over.

At this moment, in the glazed area, the entire void was abnormally lively.

Countless divine king experts from the glazed area and the holy region, as well as the descendants of the experts, had all rushed over. At least a few hundred billion people had gathered in this void.

In front of the glazed area, the domain Lord, Sacred Master, and the Divine Emperors stood in the void, quietly waiting.

Behind them, there were countless soldiers of the glazed tile land lined up neatly.

They looked at the void, their eyes burning.

They were all waiting for one person, the Dragon King.

They had just received news that the Dragon King would arrive soon, so the domain Lord had led everyone to wait here immediately.

And with the strength of the Dragon Palace and the position of the Dragon King, it was worth their wait.

The more than 40 celestial emperors, including the eight desolate six directions and the heavenly punishment ancient sky region, could only stand at the edge.

The Central Region Lords and sacred lords would occasionally exchange a few words.

“They’re here!”

At this moment, the first Supreme Elder’s voice sounded. Everyone’s hearts shook as they looked forward.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The Nine Wind Divine Dragons pulled the dragon palanquin and looked forward as if they were announcing their arrival.

A vast wave of dragon might rushed out in all directions.

“Nine wind divine dragons pulling the palanquin out. Who can match such might?”

All the Divine Emperors looked at the nine wind divine dragons from afar, their eyes filled with reverence.

Especially the might of the wind divine dragon with the largest body in the center, it made them feel fear.

Even the domain Lord’s pupils constricted slightly when he saw it. He could sense that it was the might of a third level divine emperor. Back then, when he was at his peak, he only had such might with the help of the seven-colored glazed stone.

“The Dragon King and the others are here!”

In the entire void and other places in the glazed land, everyone who heard this roar looked over in unison.

They saw the mythical divine dragon flying over in their direction.

The power of the Dragon Palace was so terrifying!

“Roar Roar!”

“We pay our respects to the Dragon King and welcome the Dragon King to glazed land!”

Very soon, the divine dragon arrived in front of the domain Lord and the other divine emperors and floated in the void.

The domain Lord immediately welcomed them.

The celestial thearchs followed closely and bowed to welcome them.

“Everyone, there’s no need to be so polite. Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian walked out of the Dragon sedan and looked at them as he said with a smile.

“Dragon King, there’s no need to move. Please follow us!”

The domain Lord immediately said and led the way!
