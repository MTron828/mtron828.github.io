2593 The brief silence before the storm of 25

“A large-scale riot broke out between the Sky Mountain Sword sect and the ninth-grade heaven sect. Countless disciples were killed. One planet was even destroyed!”

“I’m shocked. Almost 80% of the planets of the two top forces were in turmoil. Countless disciples were killed. This is simply a hell!”

“It’s located in a branch of the Sky Mountain Sword sect. Hundreds of thousands of disciples were killed under the cover of the strange darkness and light. It’s simply too terrifying!”

“The Dragon Palace’s Revenge has begun. The black-and-white creature is a disciple of the Dragon Palace. The Dragon Palace is taking revenge!”

The Flames of war spread to thousands of planets. Such a terrible thing shocked the entire star South Galaxy. After all, it was the time when thousands of planets were in chaos!

One planet was destroyed. Such a thing caused the entire star south galaxy to boil!

Everyone knew that this was the Dragon Palace’s Revenge!

Since the six major forces had joined forces to destroy our planet, then we would charge back!

However, what shocked everyone was that the experts of the Dragon Palace were a little terrifying!

The Sky Mountain Sword sect and the ninth-grade sky sect had obviously made some preparations, but they were still silently slaughtered by the experts of the Dragon Palace. It was obvious that the experts of the Dragon Palace weren’t simple!

“Go and help them. Quick, kill all the Assassins!”

“Kill them, kill them all. We can’t let them escape!”

The experts of the six forces were immediately summoned back to the planets where the ninth-grade sky sect was located and flew toward the planets!

Their eyes were blood-red and their faces were extremely ugly!

This time, they originally wanted to make the Dragon Palace feel fear and despair, but they didn’t expect that in the end, they would suffer huge losses!

According to the information transmitted from the various planets, countless disciples were killed or injured!

This was the foundation of the future of the two major forces, and their hearts ached at the loss of so much!

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The experts descended onto the planets one by one. When they saw the chaotic planets, they roared and directly charged over!

However, seeing the arrival of the powerful godly king, they immediately returned to the Dragon Cave in the Dragon Palace!

The whole raid only lasted for five minutes. In some places, it didn’t even last five minutes!

However, in these five minutes, hundreds of planets were thrown into chaos!

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh

In the Dragon Palace, the strange demons returned one by one!

Prime Minister Gui stood in front of the Dragon Cave and waited quietly!

“Reporting to Prime Minister Gui, all the peculiar demon disciples have returned, over a thousand of them have fallen!”

A powerful piercing dragon walked over and reported to Prime Minister Gui!

“Over a thousand disciples have fallen!”

Prime Minister Gui muttered, his expression was ugly!

It had been a long time since the Dragon Palace had lost so much!

“You guys take a rest and wait for the Order!”

“Take the soul returning wood to the planets!”

Prime Minister Gui said to A Level 5 undying god King Evil Demon and walked into the Dragon King Palace!

At the same time, he issued a warning in the name of the Dragon Palace! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“If the planet where the Dragon Palace is located is destroyed again, the Dragon Palace will assassinate everyone from the Sky Mountain Sword sect, the level 9 sky sect, and the other four forces, including everyone in the domain!”

After the information was released, he waited quietly in the Dragon King Palace!

“Hiss, is the Dragon Palace warning us?”

“I heard that the assassinations were all aimed at the disciples of the ninth-grade Sky Sect of the Sky Mountain Sword sect. If they targeted everyone in their territory, it would be terrifying. At the very least, hundreds of millions of people would be killed, and at the very most, billions of people would be killed!”

“The most important thing is that the mysterious creatures of the Dragon Palace are too good at hiding. They seem to be able to dodge the detection and defense of the planets!”

“There are so many planets in the six major forces. It’s impossible to guard against them!”

“Just now, the people of the ninth-grade sky sect and sky mountain sword sect were clamoring to kill them. Why aren’t they clamoring now?”

When the news of the Dragon Palace was released, everyone was talking about it. Some were shocked, and some were gloating!

“Bang!”

“Immediately summon them over and prepare to attack the Dragon Planet!”

On the planet where the six forces were located, the leader of the ninth-grade Sky clan slammed the table angrily with an extremely ugly expression on his face!

The assassination of that strange creature was indeed a threat to them!

If the Dragon Palace really didn’t care about the cost and continued to fight, they would also suffer countless casualties!

Moreover, it would also cause some people within the domain to go to other planets to settle down!

Now, it was impossible to destroy the base of the Dragon Palace bit by bit, making them fear and despair!

“This time, we’ll attack them directly and kill them all. We don’t need to waste time with them!”

The experts around echoed!

If they continued to waste time, they would lose 800 of their own!

“The Dragon Palace is really mad at me!”

...

The sword king wiped the blood sword in his hand with a bloodthirsty expression!

“All forces prepare to attack the dragon star in one day!”

The leader of the Ninth-grade Sky sect roared with a gloomy and cold face.

The hatred between them and the Dragon Palace had increased!

They swore to destroy the Dragon Palace and make it bleed for hundreds of millions of miles!

“Yes!”

The experts of the other forces nodded and felt lucky!

If the assassination this time was not on the planets under the ninth-grade Sky Sect and Sky Mountain Sword sect, but on them, their losses would be even more severe!

“Huh?”

At the same time, in the area where the iron-blood alliance used to be located, the experts from Sky Mountain Sword sect and the rest of them received the message and their faces instantly darkened!

“Damn it, they actually assassinated people from our planet and destroyed a planet. Let’s go back!”

...

Their faces were very ugly. They stopped what they were doing and returned immediately!

For a moment, the entire southern star system fell into a weird silence!

It was the calm before the storm!

The experts and disciples of the Dragon Palace had gone to the planets under the banner of the Sky Mountain Sword sect and the ninth-rank sky sect to assassinate so many people. Soon, the storm between the two forces would blow up!

In the Dragon Palace, Prime Minister Gui was sitting there. He was not too worried about what was going to happen next!

On a planet above the Dragon Star, the sky array was calmly lying on a high platform. He was drinking tea and playing with the AI!

The sky array did not care about the possible attacks from the six great factions!

He was the strongest array master in this resplendent greater world. He was one of the best void God emperors!

On the AI, everyone was discussing animatedly. The armies of the six major factions were also quickly gathering!

And in the Abyss, Wang Xian did not know what was happening in the outside world!

He was still more at ease with the current Dragon Palace. The main reason was that he believed in the strength of the sky array god Emperor!

The Dragon Palace and Dragon Star could not be breached without a dozen level 7 undying godly monarch experts!

“Ten Level 7 undying god King Warriors, good, good, take out your dragon blood. This time, let’s try to kill more abyss seeds!”

In front of the Abyss Seed Mountain, Wang Xian looked at the six level 7 undying god King Warriors in front of him, and a hint of excitement appeared on his face!
