“Long Xiaotian, what did you say? You’re a bad guy. Don’t snatch my pet. That’s my mount. Brother Wang gave it to me!”

Long Luo was stunned for a full two seconds when she heard long Xiaotian’s words. Then, she grabbed his arm and shouted loudly with a flushed face.

“Long Luo, Don’t be disobedient. What’s the use of a little girl like you taking this mount? If you really can’t do it, there are still some black shadow leopards at transcendent level nine. How about I give you some spirit stones and let brother Wang Xian tame them for you?”

Long Xiaotian looked at his sister who was frantically grabbing onto him and said awkwardly.

“No, no, this big black cat is mine. I asked for it first. You Can’t Bully Me. Otherwise, I will tell mother!”

Long Luo grabbed his arm and shouted loudly.

“Little girl, do you know how much a half-step void interpretation beast is worth? Do you have that many spirit stones? Furthermore, you usually stay in the palace. What use is there for you to have this mount?”

Long Xiaotian’s face turned black as he tried to coax her.

Wang Xian was stunned when he saw this scene. He didn’t expect long Xiaotian to be so shameless.

The Prince of the Radiant Dragon Empire, a half-step void interpretation expert, and his sister’s mount. This was really...

“Phew!”

Bai Qingshan and the elder exchanged a look. Their eyes were filled with shock.

“Brother Wang Xian, I didn’t expect your beast taming skills to be so strong. I would like to ask if you can tame all the other Black Shadow Leopards and listen to the commands of others?”

Bai Qingshan asked him with a face full of anticipation.

“With my help, there won’t be any problems!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

After taming the Ling Zilin last time, Wang Xian realized that his beast taming skills were a little abnormal.

With the beast taming skills of the Bai Xun Elder and the Top-notch bloodline of the Dragon God in his universe, it was extremely fast to tame ferocious beasts that were weaker than him.

Even if the Bai Xun Elder was reborn, he wouldn’t be able to reach his level.

“Really?”

Bai Qingshan’s eyes flashed with excitement and passion. “That’s great. We will buy all the Black Shadow Leopards that you have tamed. What do you think, brother Wang Xian?”

“No Problem!”

Wang Xian nodded his head with a smile.

There were more than 50 black shadow leopards that were at transcendent level seven, eight, and nine. If they were sold according to the value of the pet eggs, it would definitely be a huge income.

“Haha, That’s Great! Brother Wang Xian, I want all of these Black Shadow Leopards. You are really my lucky star. Now, help me get this leader of the Black Shadow Leopards to obey my orders!”

When Long Xiaotian heard Wang Xian’s words, excitement flashed across his eyes as he laughed out loud in excitement.

Wang Xian looked over and saw long Luo pouting and glaring at his brother with a displeased expression. A smile appeared on his face.

“Sure!”

Following that, Wang Xian ordered the leader of the Black Shadow Leopards to obey Wang Xian’s orders and tame it.

After subduing the leader of the Black Shadow Leopards and the rest of the Black Shadow Leopards, it was even easier. In less than half an hour, all the black shadow leopards were subdued.

“Prince Wang Xian, you must hold on tight to this thigh of yours!”

An hour later, the group set off again. It was different from before. Now, everyone was riding on a Black Shadow Panther.

Long Xiaotian was riding on the half-step void interpretation black shadow panther. Bai Qingshan and the old man followed beside him.

The old man looked at Wang Xian, who was in the middle, and whispered to him.

“That’s right!”

Bai Qingshan, who was at the side, nodded his head in agreement. “This brother Wang Xian is too mysterious. He definitely doesn’t come from an ordinary faction. Let’s not talk about this. Just his powerful beast taming techniques. Prince, you must cling onto this thigh of his!”

“I know!”

Long Xiaotian nodded his head. There was some excitement in his eyes as well.

Currently, it was the assessment period for him to compete with his brothers for the title of crown prince. The final assessment was mostly about the faction.

Influence represented one’s own strength and the strength of one’s subordinates.

As long as he befriended Wang Xian and asked him to help tame all kinds of ferocious beasts in the future, his influence would be doubled or even more.

For example, his brother had 100 subordinates who were at least at transcendent level six. However, as long as he had 60 subordinates who were at transcendent level six and above, together with his 60 subordinates who rode on 60 ferocious beasts above transcendent level six.., he would be able to win.

The current Wang Xian was like a huge lucky star that fell from the sky to him. He had to hug this thigh tightly.

Furthermore, Wang Xian had already done him a favor. Facing such a lucky star and such a thigh, he knew what to do in the future.

The group of them moved forward quickly. Along the way, Wang Xian helped long Xiaotian and his underlings tame the black shadow leopard.

Soon, more than 20 hours later, a gush of bloody smell came from the air.

Wang Xian, who lowered his head and continued to simulate the combination of combat techniques, was slightly shocked. He quickly looked ahead.

“This is?”

At a glance, Wang Xian’s pupils contracted slightly. His eyes revealed a look of shock.

He stared ahead and breathed in the bloody air. He was extremely shocked.

In front of him, there was an endless sea on the left, and a forest on the right.

The color of the sea was not sky blue, but red. The sea breeze did not smell of salt, but of blood.

The Red Sea water was like a terrifying pool of blood.

The forest on the right was two to three hundred meters tall and thick, with a diameter of about ten meters.

The ground of the forest was light red. Like the ocean, it was filled with the smell of blood. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Brother Wang Xian, are you not used to the air here? The cemetery of the demi-humans, the so-called cemetery, is where the bones are buried. Even if you die here, there isn’t even a corpse!”

Long Xiaotian rode on the black shadow leopard and came to his side, he said to him, “This is the biggest battlefield between the demonic beasts, Vicious Beasts, and humans. The blood-red ocean and the blood-red ground are not formed in a year or two. Instead, they have been accumulated over thousands of years!”

“The thousands of years of battles are caused by the humans and ferocious beasts that have died here. There are at least tens of billions or even hundreds of billions of them. The sea is dyed red and the ground is soaked red!”

“Let’s go. The camp of the cemetery of the human-demon race is ahead!”

Long Xiaotian pointed to the front and said, “Everyone, speed up!”

Everyone sped up. Wang Xian scanned his surroundings.

They continued to travel for about a hundred kilometers along the edge of the sea and the forest.

A place that could not be called a city appeared in their line of sight.

“Long Xiaotian said that this is a camp just now. Now, it seems that this is really the case!”

Wang Xian looked ahead and mumbled.

There was no city, no city wall, and no formation. It was a camp by the sea.

There were all kinds of buildings erected in the camp, and it looked a little messy.

In the sky, people flew at will. There were no less than hundreds of thousands of people flying in the sky!
