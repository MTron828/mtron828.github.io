Chapter 666: Get On Your Knees And Prepare To Be Killed (2)

Translator: Larbrestudio

“Elder Hua, you don’t have to do it personally just to slaughter a force from the real world. Just leave it to us!”

An old man beside Elder Hua said in a low voice, “The Martial Artists in the real world have incomplete battle techniques. Even with the strength of the Budding Realm, one is still far from us. A Half-step to Immortal? I don’t think there’s one in the real world!”

The old man spoke with radiance flickering in his eyes. “A force that possesses nine Budding Realm experts was invincible in the real world. But to us... Haha!”

His face was full of contempt.

“That’s right, Elder Hua. We have 25 Budding Realm experts with us this time. Just send any ten of them, and they could just kill them off!”

The middle-aged man spoke with a beaming face.

Having nine Budding Realm experts was indeed quite impressive. But to the people from Yao Cauldron World, annihilating them would be easy-peasy.

Moreover, this time they had brought twenty-five Budding Realm experts with them.

As for that Dragon King, who was known as a Half-step to Immortal expert, they did not really believe it. His strength was at most at Pinnacle Budding Realm.

“25... 25 Budding Realm experts? How could it be possible?”

At this time, however, the group of Martial Artists of the Underworld was horrified when they overheard their conversation.

Twenty-five Budding Realm experts? What kind of concept is this?

If twenty-five of them strike together, they could level the entire Guta Mountain Range in less than twenty minutes.

If they rage, wouldn’t they be able to massacre half the country?

“I beg to ask a question, Your Excellencies. How many such terrifying people exist in your world?”

Sect Leader Wan asked this in shock as he involuntarily wiped the beads of cold sweat from his forehead and swallowed his saliva.

The middle-aged man with short hair peered at Sect Leader Wan and replied in a monotone voice. “The mightiness of Yao Cauldron World is beyond what you can imagine! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Inborn Experts are merely average disciples while we have a few hundred Budding Realm Experts. Even better, we have Immortals who could truly whip up massive destruction to the world!”

The voice of that middle-aged man was ringing in the ears of many Martial Artists of the Underworld as they revealed horrified expressions.

Few hundred Budding Realm experts!

Immortals who could genuinely whip up massive destruction to the world!

Gosh!

“There are nine such worlds, and all of them are descending into the real world. By then, all of you will just be small fries!” the middle-aged man with short hair said with slight contempt.

“Nine!”

All the Martial Artists of the Underworld were aghast as their bodies stiffened up.

“The Nine Cauldrons have transformed into dragon veins. This will be a good opportunity for all of you. Under the cleansing of the spiritual energy waterfall, you can greatly enhance your potential and strength. If you can advance to Inborn Realm, you may join our Medical Saint Immortal Sect and Remedy Saint Immortal Sect!” said Elder Hua to the surrounding Martial Artists impassively.

“Really? Thank you, Your Excellency. We’ll work hard and contribute our efforts to the Immortal Sects!”

The group of Martial Artists hurriedly flattered him at the top of their lungs.

“Your Excellencies, the Dragon King is at Mt. Taibai because there’s one similar spiritual energy waterfall over there. You can head over, and the Dragon King will be easily at your mercy!”

“That’s right, Your Excellency. Shall we lead the way to retrieve the head of the Dragon King? We can deal with those who are related to the Dragon King!”

All the Inborn Experts of the Underworld pledged their loyalty immediately.

Mighty Yao Cauldron World of the mighty Nine Cauldron Worlds.

All these powerful worlds were going to descend into the real world. They needed to choose the correct side to stand on. Otherwise, their lives would be worse than that of a dog.

After witnessing the power of the Nine Cauldron Worlds, the Dragon King was simply nothing.

These sixty people from Yao Cauldron World could quickly annihilate the Dragon King, not to mention those real experts from the Nine Cauldron Worlds.

In the future world, the Dragon King was just a pond loach and one that was waiting to be slaughtered.

What they needed to do now was to follow these people before them!

“Oh? Such a spiritual energy waterfall has already appeared?” Elder Hua asked puzzledly.

“Yes, Your Excellency. This spiritual energy waterfall appeared at Mt. Taibai around twenty days ago!”

All the Martial Artists quickly responded to his question.

“Twenty days? Mt. Taibai? It looks like Huang Cauldron world will be the first to descend into the real world!”

With beaming eyes, Elder Hua looked to an elder beside him. “Elder Bian, you’ll take twenty Budding Realm experts with you to kill that Dragon King while I stay put and guard this place!”

“Sure. Leave that Dragon King to me. Elder Hua, you can make plans for the real world!”

Elder Bian smiled and nodded.

“Mm, Elder Bian, don’t be careless. What if that Dragon King is really a Half-step to Immortal Realm expert?”

“If he really is, we’ll join hands. That should suffice!”

“Yes, Elder Bian. Come back soon!”

“I’ll take at most a day!”

The two of them were very relaxed, talking away.

To them, they were not heading off to kill a strong enemy, but rather, an ant.

“Lead the way!” said Elder Bian in a low voice as he swept his gaze across the Martial Artists of the Underworld below.

“Your Excellency, let me take you guys there!” said a disciple beside Sect Leader Wan after he gestured to him.

“Great!”

“Hur? Someone is heading this way!”

All of a sudden, an old man spun around and looked ahead.

Close to forty figures were flying in their direction at a rapid speed.

“Hur? There are people on Guta Mountain Range. It seems like we’re not the first to arrive!”

While the group of people looked over, Wang Xian had already led a team of Dragon Sect members over.

When he saw the thousands of people below the spiritual energy waterfall, Wang Xian revealed a faint smile on his face.

Time to work on the second dragon vein.

“They are those Martial Artists of the Underworld who I chased away!”

Wang Xian looked over and chuckled without any concern.

He was not interested in who was in the mountains, practicing there.

Even if those people were the Martial Artists of the Underworld who he had chased away half a month ago, it was none of his concern as usual.

Those Martial Artists of the Underworld were nothing but ants to him.

In the near future, his real opponent would be those from the Nine Cauldron Worlds.

“Yes, Dragon King!”

“It’s him, the Dragon King of Dragon Sect!”

However, those Martial Artists let out exclamations as soon as Wang Xian and the Dragon Sect members approached.

“He’s the Dragon King of Dragon Sect?”

Elder Hua was slightly surprised.

“Yes, that’s him, the Dragon King and the experts from Dragon Sect!”

Sect Leader Wan was staring at Wang Xian and his gang with a pair of blazing eyes.

This was the first time that he dared to glare at Dragon King directly with eyes burning with fire. At the same time, it was the first time he was becoming thrilled.

He was gloating at the misfortune of others while a tinge of a sneer flashed in his eyes.

All the Martial Artists of the Underworld were excited and elated.

“Well, we don’t have to search high and low for him now. He’s sending himself over here to claim his own death!”

Elder Hua revealed a grin on his face.

“For those who are approaching here, come over, get on your knees, and prepare to die!”
