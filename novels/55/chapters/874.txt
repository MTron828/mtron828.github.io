Chapter 875: 0876 wedding celebration

Translator: 549690339

Half a year passed very quickly.

During this half a year, Wang Xian and the rest traveled to every corner of the earth, eating, drinking, and having fun.

At the same time, Sun Lingxiu was also carrying out her business. Every time she arrived in a city, she would remove the pain of all the patients in the city.

During the entire half a year, news about the Dragon King and the Dragon Queen were everywhere.

When everyone mentioned the Dragon King and the Dragon Queen, they showed respect from the bottom of their hearts.

“Brothers, sisters-in-law, you are finally back!”

The day of Xiao Yu’s wedding was approaching. Wang Xian, Guan Shuqing, and Lan Qingyue returned to the Dragon Palace.

As soon as they entered, Xiao Yu’s voice sounded. She flew over immediately and shouted at them with a smile on her face.

“Yes, I’m back. Let’s start the wedding for you!”

Wang Xian patted Xiao Yu’s head with a smile on his face. “Call Feng Lingtian and his father over. We can discuss this!”

“Alright, Brother. I’ll go and inform them!”

Xiao Yu said with a smile on her face.

“It’s a big matter, a big matter! The younger sister of the Dragon King, the eldest princess of the Dragon Palace, is getting married to Feng Lingtian from the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect in five days. The wedding will be held on the sea!”

“The wedding of the Dragon King’s sister, the only relative of the Dragon King, will be the grandest wedding on Earth!”

“The whole world will be celebrating. This wedding will probably be attended by all the Immortals and gods in the world. It will be a real feast!”

“The Yellow Heaven Immortal sect will truly become a royal relative this time. I really envy that Feng Lingtian!”

“I heard that Feng Lingtian offended the eldest princess in the past and was beaten up by her. Sigh, a gigolo, the biggest gigolo in history!”

“That’s right. Even if this Feng Lingtian is a middle-level immortal, he’s still a gigolo. I’m envious, why am I not a gigolo!”

“The entire world has the qualifications to go. I reckon they must all rush over to congratulate him!”

On the Internet, the news about the wedding of the Dragon King’s sister spread, causing a sensation all over the world.

The wedding of the Dragon King’s only relative was probably the most sensational event of the year.

Every word and action of the Dragon King had a huge impact, not to mention his sister’s marriage.

As the good day approached, the whole world was filled with jubilation.

One by one, the immortals of the immortal sects, along with their outstanding disciples, followed the people of the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect and flew toward the sea. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The Gods of the western divine realm flew toward the Dragon Palace together.

All the experts of the world were heading toward one place.

At this moment, above the Dragon Palace, a huge floating island was floating on the sea.

Around the floating island, there were all kinds of aquatic creatures.

These aquatic creatures were jumping around, making the entire sea look extremely beautiful.

Fish of all colors were formed into pictures and words, making it look breathtaking.

Around the floating island, yakshas were standing around to maintain order, just in case.

Each yaksha had the strength of a superior immortal.

Nine Dragons were circling in the sky, and each of them was already thirty meters long.

Their strength had already broken through to the extraordinary realm, and they had completed the first change of the Divine Dragon. They were already beginning to possess the might of a dragon.

Prime Minister Gui stood in the middle of the island, commanding a group of Golden Swordfish clansmen to set up the surroundings.

Some demon monkeys were jumping up and down, placing things one by one. All of them had excited smiles on their faces, just like the flower and fruit mountains on television.

“We’re here, everyone. The Dragon Palace is right in front of us!”

Ling Xiao led a group of immortal gods and disciples from the eastern immortal sects and flew over, pointing at the floating island in front of them.

“Hiss, so many creatures!”

“Look at the nine dragons circling in the sky. They’re simply too powerful!”

“The ocean takes up 70% of the Earth’s surface area. After the spiritual essence recovers, the powerful creatures in the ocean will also become stronger. Obviously, the Dragon King has a special method to make some creatures have intelligence!”

The group of immortal gods from the immortal sects looked down with shock in their eyes.

“Everyone, this way please!”

At this moment, a golden swordfish instantly appeared in front of them and said to the group of more than a thousand people.

“Good, good!”

The group of people hurriedly nodded and looked at each other with a trace of shock in their eyes.

A high-level immortal. This swordsman who had welcomed them was a powerful high-level immortal.

They didn’t fully understand the Dragon Palace’s forces.

Even when they were at the time of the god-destroying king and the Yuwen clan, the Dragon Palace hadn’t used all of its forces.

Moreover, half a year had passed, and the Dragon Palace’s strength had undergone another huge change.

The number of Immortals had reached more than 400, and there were now 20 to 30 high-level immortals in the Dragon Palace.

“Everyone, please wait here for a while. The Dragon King will be here soon!”

Prime Minister Gui walked over and greeted everyone with a smile. Then, he ordered Feng Lingtian and the others to prepare.

“Okay, okay. We’ll just take a look here!”

The immortals nodded nervously and looked around.

They could see immortal-level creatures everywhere, and there were even many existences that they felt were unfathomable.

“Look over there, it’s the ten ancient gods!”

At this moment, an immortal God suddenly looked over with a face full of shock. When he saw the invincible ten people setting up things, his eyes were filled with shock.

Even the ten ancient gods, who were so strong that they almost unified earth, had to respectfully set up things here now.

“This place is so beautiful. It’s even more beautiful than the wedding scene when the Yuwen clan and the Scandinavian God realm were united by marriage!”

“Although the wedding back then was shocking, it can’t be compared to Sister Dragon King’s wedding. Look at the densely packed aquatic creatures around you. It’s as though they possess intelligence. This scene is too shocking!”

The Ocean was originally magnificent. Now, there were all kinds of aquatic creatures around them.

The dancing dolphins, colorful fish, and beautiful sea dragons and seahorses were all magnificent.

The wedding was a modern wedding. There were not many rules. Ling Tian entered a room and was preparing.

They had already discussed the entire process.

Wang Xian came out from the underwater dragon palace and greeted everyone.

At noon, the wedding began.

All the guests sat at the table. A red carpet extended to the edge of the room.

A leader of the Western God realm came to act as the emcee because he looked kind and kind!

“Welcome, Bride!”

When the old man’s voice sounded, a huge crack appeared in the ocean beside the floating island.

Sitting on the island, one could see a towering city below, and a magnificent underwater dragon palace.

Feng Lingtian stood at the edge of the floating island and looked down.

Wang Xian held Xiao Yu’s hand and slowly walked up from the Dragon Palace!
