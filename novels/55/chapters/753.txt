“Guji Guji!”

A Cry was heard!

The excited and shrill voice of the senior sister from the Natural Born Immortal sect was heard at the same time!

Everyone was slightly stunned and looked towards the entrance.

A half-meter tall wooden tree demon was running towards them with excited eyes.

“It’s Guji, the Flower Queen’s pet!”

“The flower queen is Here!”

Everyone exclaimed when they saw the tree demon suddenly appear.

This magical tree demon was the Flower Queen’s pet and had been following behind the flower queen.

If Guji appeared, the flower queen must be behind it too.

The flower queen was an immortal-level powerhouse and the only female immortal in the entire world of the soup tripod. She was as strong as a woman and was full of dignity!

Now that a young man wanted to kill a disciple of their natural born immortal sect, the immortal could definitely kill him directly!

After all, this was the natural born immortal sect. If someone wanted to cause trouble, the immortal could directly take action!

“You’re done for, you damn thing. You actually dared to kill a disciple of our ice god Immortal sect. You’re done for!”

Bingchuan Yun also stared at Wang Xian with a ferocious expression and shouted loudly.

“Guji Guji!”

At this moment, his eyes lit up as he sensed the energy that excited him. His round eyes scanned his surroundings.

However, when he saw Wang Xian, he let out an anxious cry.

His face was filled with fear. He quickly bypassed Wang Xian and ran to the side of flower fairy. He reached out his hand and pulled her back.

Flower Fairy looked at Gu Ji with a look of astonishment.

“Pa Pa Pa!”

At this moment, the sound of footsteps could be heard.

A valiant and valiant woman walked over with an aura of motherhood. Her eyes were sparkling as she stared at the Green Dragon Bead in the sky.

“Lady Queen!”

“Sect leader of the Queen!”

The Ice God celestial sect and the girl shouted excitedly when they saw the woman walking over.

The woman turned her head and swept her gaze across them. Her gaze landed on Wang Xian as her eyes sparkled.

On the Greenwood Path, she rushed over when she saw Wang Xian walking towards the innate celestial sect.

She didn’t expect that this powerhouse, who was one level higher than her, would actually enter their celestial sect! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Master!”

Flower fairy picked up Guji and rushed to flower queen’s side.

“What’s going on?”

The Queen of Flowers asked with a twinkle in her eyes.

“Sect leader of the Queen of flowers, it’s him. He actually killed five disciples of the ice god Celestial sect in our celestial sect. Now, he wants to kill us. Sect leader of the Queen of Flowers, please make a decision for our sect and kill him!”

“Lady Queen of Flowers, please make a decision for our disciples of the Ice God Celestial sect. Kill him or hand him over to our celestial sect!”

The girl and Bingchuan Yun hurriedly shouted.

After they were done, they stared at Wang Xian with cold eyes. Their eyes were filled with excitement.

What was there to be afraid of, the celestial sect?

“Master, it’s like this...”

Fairy Flower told the Lady Queen of flowers what had happened.

“But it’s like what she said!”

When the Lady Queen of Flowers Heard Fairy Flower’s words, she asked the girl who was shrouded in green light with an expressionless face.

The girl was slightly stunned, then she immediately explained, “Sect master flower empress, a junior brother of the ice god Immortal sect only wanted to touch him, but he was instantly heavily injured by him. He attacked our immortal sect without any scruples. It’s simply contempt for our immortal sect!”

“Sect master, he still wants to kill me now. Sect Master, Please punish him!”

“He killed five of our senior and Junior Brothers. Please punish him, Lady Flower Queen!”

The girl and the group of Ice God celestial sect’s disciples said loudly.

“The power of the immortals can not be offended!”

Flower Queen said slowly.

“Did you hear that, Kid? To dare to make a move in the innate celestial sect is the greatest disrespect to the immortals. Go To Hell...”

“Sir, you can do whatever you want with them!”

Bingchuan Yun stared at Wang Xian with excitement and growled in a low voice.

However, before he could finish his sentence, he heard the Flower Queen’s faint words.

In an instant, his expression froze.

Everyone was stunned. The Disciples of the ice god Immortal sect who were surrounded by the green light, the disciples of the True Martial Immortal Academy, the Natural Born Immortal sect’s disciples, and the flower fairy all looked at the flower queen in Shock!

This lord?

The flower queen actually addressed this lord to that young man!

Normally, the Lord would only address an immortal-level powerhouse.

And the flower queen herself was an immortal-level powerhouse, yet she was addressing that young man as Lord.

That meant... His strength was even stronger than the flower queen.

That young man was an immortal-level powerhouse!

Everyone’s expression changed drastically as they looked at Wang Xian in shock. Their eyes were filled with disbelief and respect.

However, the glacier cloud that was enveloped by the green light, as well as the female student and the rest were completely stunned.

Their bodies trembled slightly and their eyes were filled with disbelief.

“The might of an immortal God must not be offended!”

Wang Xian looked at the woman and revealed a faint smile.

The might of an immortal God must not be offended!

On that path, if he was not an immortal God, Wang Xian was sure that this woman would definitely teach him a lesson.

This was the dignity of an immortal god. It was not something that others could offend.

Even if it was a disciple of his immortal sect who provoked an immortal god, he would be courting death.

No immortal sect would do such a thing to protect a disciple who deliberately provoked an immortal God!

Buzz

Wang Xian waved his arm and the green dragon bead in the sky turned into rays of light.

“No, no!”

“We were wrong. We didn’t know that you are the Immortal!”

The disciples of the glacier cloud sect saw Wang Xian waving his hand and showed despair on their faces. They quickly knelt on the ground and begged for mercy.

“Sect leader, save me!”

The girl shouted with a miserable face.

Flower Queen looked on expressionlessly. She was not an indecisive person since she had stepped into the immortal realm as a girl.

A bunch of shrimps had provoked an immortal god. The price had to be borne by herself.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

The sound of shattering could be heard.

“No, my cultivation, My Dantian!”

Bingchuan Yun shouted with a face full of despair. He was an outstanding disciple of the Ice God immortal sect, a proud Heaven’s favorite. Now, he was actually crippled!

“You guys, send them back!”

The Flower Queen’s face was expressionless when she saw this scene. She slowly said to the remaining disciples of the ice god Immortal sect who were standing there in a daze.

“Yes, yes!”

They hurriedly responded and walked towards the disciples of the immortal sect. Seeing them become crippled one by one, they rejoiced in their hearts.

Fortunately, they weren’t blinded by greed just now!

However, who would have thought that the young man was actually an immortal God, and an immortal god that was even stronger than the flower queen!

“They deserved to die this time. They provoked an immortal god and even wanted to take him away. They are simply courting death!”

The crowd of Zhenwu Celestial Academy’s disciples looked at Wang Xian with a complicated expression. Their eyes were filled with respect as they glanced at Wang Xian.

This was the prestige of an immortal God.

Even in the natural born celestial sect and Tang ding, if you deliberately provoked an immortal God, the immortal God would still be able to cripple and kill you without paying any price.

The power of the immortal, not to be offended!
