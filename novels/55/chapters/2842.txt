2843 2843, invincible in battle? Go

“Here you go. Thank you very much.”

In the pavilion, two hours later, the lady passed the holy feather to Wang Xian. She had a frown on her face as if she had comprehended something.

“HMM, I can let you comprehend for two hours here every day in the future.”

Wang Xian looked at her and smiled as he tried to persuade her.

“Alright, thank you very much!”

After the lady finished her sentence, her figure disappeared. It was obvious that she wanted to absorb the things that she had comprehended during these two hours.

“She’s quite tactful.”

Wang Xian watched her disappear as he muttered to himself. He smiled and walked into the room.

After entering the room, he continued to nurture the Holy Feather.

For the next two days, apart from staying in the pavilion for two hours every day and allowing the lady to comprehend for two hours, Wang Xian spent the rest of the time nurturing the Holy Feather.

Buzz Buzz Buzz

Five days later, the entire holy feather started to tremble violently. The faint shadow of the wind god Dragon could be seen flickering on it.

“Is it going to succeed?”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with excitement. Once he successfully nurtured the holy feather and fused it with the incipient holy wings, he would be able to gain an additional attribute.

Wind attribute!

When the time came, his strength would also increase a little.

The current holy feather had undergone a huge change from the illusion when he first obtained it.

Especially just now, the entire holy feather was slowly transforming into the appearance of a dragon scale. Although it still looked like a feather, it was very close to the appearance of a dragon scale.

The Divine Wind Dragon was rotating. Wang Xian’s mind moved and the incipient holy wings appeared behind him. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Buzz Buzz

The moment the incipient Holy Wings appeared, the Holy Feather and the Holy Wings started to tremble at the same time.

Roar Roar

A weak and inaudible dragon roar was heard. The entire holy feather shone brightly and flew directly towards the holy wings.

Crack

Buzz

The next moment, he felt that he could touch the wind attribute around him and the wind attribute laws.

He waved his arm and a wind blade law appeared, floating in front of him.

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up as the wind blade slowly condensed.

Crack

However, in the next moment, the wind blade law in front of him collapsed.

Wang Xian was stunned. However, when he sensed the position behind him, his face slowly turned dark.

The Genesis Wings was a bone wing with shiny bones on it.

However, at one corner of the bone wing, there was a holy feather floating on it. After that, there was nothing else.

There was only one holy wing. It didn’t look very eye-catching and was rather an eyesore.

“This is?”

When Wang Xian saw this situation, his face turned dark.

“This is only a holy feather!”

“There are many holy feathers on the incipient holy wings. I only found one.”

His face turned dark as he thought to himself.

In other words, there were still many holy feathers in the windless forest. He didn’t find all of them.

Only when he found all of them would the wind-elemental wings be considered complete.

This caused Wang Xian’s expression to change.

The last time he entered the windless forest, he only entered the edge of the windless forest valley.

However, even if he was at the edge, he was almost killed.

If he were to enter the center, wouldn’t he die?

“Should I go in to search after my strength has improved?”

Wang Xian frowned and revealed a helpless expression.

“That’s not right. I remember that the Heaven Formation mentioned a windless day. That woman also mentioned a windless day to her disciple.”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered slightly. With a move of his palm, the holy feather appeared in his hand.

Having completely nurtured a holy feather, Wang Xian realized that he could sense the wind attribute laws.ρ

However, if he used the wind attribute, his attack power would at most reach level two immortal king. It would be useless.

“I’ll ask that woman tomorrow.”

Wang Xian thought to himself. He laid on the bed helplessly and rested.

“EH, thank you for the tea.”

The next day, when Wang Xian arrived at the pavilion, the lady was already sitting there. Beside her was a pot of freshly brewed tea.

“No need. Since you like tea, I happen to have some here.”

The lady shook her head.

Wang Xian smiled as he sat at the side. With a move of his palm, the Holy Feather flew towards her.

“Eh?”

When she saw the Holy Feather, she was slightly taken aback as well. “It has changed?”

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded and asked, “What is the situation of the windless day? Can you tell me?”

“Eh?”

“The windless day is a special situation in the windless forest. Every ten thousand years, there will be a storm in the windless forest. At that time, the attack of the trees in the windless forest will be much weaker.”

“At that time, it will be the most exciting time for the wind attribute cultivators. The Wind Jade and the treasures in the windless forest valley will attract the attention of the celestial thearch. At that time, there will be celestial thearch coming. Some celestial thearch who is not of the wind attribute may also come.”

The woman said.

“Oh?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly. His eyes were sparkling.

“The windless day is coming soon. It will be in three months.”

The lady continued.

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly. It seemed that his luck was not bad.

“I really don’t know how you managed to obtain such a treasure with your strength. It’s your luck that you didn’t die. However, even if it’s the windless day, don’t even think about entering the windless forest valley. No matter how weak it is, it’s not something you can enter.”

The lady glanced at her and continued.

Wang Xian smiled and changed the topic. “Oh yes, is there a communication platform in the eight desolates and six harmonies that is similar to an AI?”

“There is. I will get someone to send you one later.”

The lady nodded.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded. He took a sip of tea and started to taste it.

The lady took out a communication stone plate and sent a few messages. Seeing that Wang Xian didn’t speak, she sized up the holy feather and continued to comprehend.

“Handsome Wang Xian, come here. This is what master wanted me to give you.”

Not long after, a voice entered his ears.

He looked over and saw two women and a middle-aged man in front of him. They looked at their master and spoke carefully.

The three of them were naturally ye Lui Ying and the rest.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian saw the communication stone plate in their hands and walked towards them.

“Thank you.”

He took the communication stone plate and said with a smile.

“No need. Master asked us to send it to you. This is a new eight desolation array plate. I’ve added you as a friend. If you need anything, you can look for me.”

Ye Lui Ying said enthusiastically.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded.

“Oh right, handsome Wang Xian, what have you been doing with our master these past few days?”

“Are you going to acknowledge our master as your master? I think you’re not bad. After you acknowledge our master as your master, I’ll take care of you from now on.”

Ye lui Ying’s eyes lit up as she asked.

They were extremely surprised that their master had stayed with this young man for a few consecutive days.

Such a situation had only happened to them when they had just been accepted into their master’s tutelage.

Of course, they had never thought of other situations, nor did they let their imagination run wild.

“There’s no need. I Won’t be able to stay here for long.”

Wang Xian smiled and shook his head.
