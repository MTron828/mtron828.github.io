Translator: 549690339

“The gathering of twenty-one powerful forces is simply an unprecedented event. All the heaven’s favorites are here!”

“Is that the Dragon Gate? There are so few of them. However, it is said that none of the disciples of the Dragon Gate are below the infant realm. I really didn’t expect that there would be such a terrifying force in the pugilistic world!”

“I heard that the one who blocked the city gate of the Hunyuan Immortal Gate was an expert of the Dragon Gate. It’s simply too domineering!”

“That’s Xuanyuan Fengyi from the Xuanyuan clan. Xuanyuan Fengyi has a very high chance of winning the first place in this heaven’s favorites competition. His xuanyuan spirit sword can shock the sun and the Moon!”

“Yuwen Hua from the Yuwen clan is also very powerful. He might also win the first place in this heaven’s favorites competition!”

“Look at the position of the Fengyan Immortal sect. The one standing at the front is Cheng Qingcheng. She is simply too beautiful. How nice it would be if I could get close to her!”

“Cheng Qingcheng, Xuanyuan Yun ‘er, flower fairy, flower fairy, Hua Fairy, and all the other peerless beauties have arrived. Today’s trip was not in vain!”

“In the genius competition, whoever gets the first place will be the bright moon that suppresses the same generation, the king of geniuses among the younger generation!”

“The competition hasn’t started yet. No one can be sure who is the king of geniuses, and who can suppress the same generation!”

“This is too exciting. The King of Heaven’s favorites, a genius who can suppress an era. A genius who is as bright as the moon in the sky. Who will be the winner?”

On the twenty-two platforms, all the disciples of the immortal sects were discussing excitedly.

On the twenty-two platforms of the immortal sects, the seeded participants of the immortal sects stood at the front with proud faces.

Each of the youths had a lofty and lofty head, and their bodies were exuding powerful confidence and proud expressions.

They were the most powerful existences among the current generation of disciples of the immortal sects. They were the strongest disciples of the current generation of the immortal sects, and they had the strength to be proud of themselves.

And everyone was also talking about these disciples.

Perhaps other than them, only beautiful women with peerless beauty could make the people around them talk.

However, this time, the main character was a heaven’s favorite!

Who could suppress an era? Who was the King of Heaven’s favorites?

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

At this moment, an immortal god with terrifying power flew over from the immortal platform.

“It’s Lord Immortal God and the others!”

“That’s the grand elder of the Xuanyuan clan, a high-level immortal, one of the most powerful people in the current generation!”

“That’s the grand elder of the Yuwen Clan!”

“The sect masters of the Holy Medicine Immortal sect and the Holy Doctor Immortal Sect!”

When the immortal gods that seemed to be carrying the power of a Small World flew over one after another, the immortal gods were like the shining sun, causing people to feel fear in their hearts.

The slightly noisy sounds in the battleground quickly quieted down, and the immortal sect disciples raised their heads to look at the immortal gods in awe.

Even the most outstanding disciples of the immortal sects were filled with awe and yearning.

Only by stepping into the immortal realm could one transcend from the mortal realm and truly transcend from the mortal realm.

“Dragon King of the Dragon Gate, that’s the Dragon King. He’s so young. It’s said that the Dragon King is only in his twenties!”

Suddenly, a slightly high and surprised voice was heard. The seven to eight thousand people around looked at the young man who was walking in the air.

He was dressed in black and there was a picture of a five-colored divine dragon on it.

The Dragon King, who was giving off an imposing aura, was full of endless majesty.

“He’s an immortal god in his twenties. The founder of the Dragon Gate is only in his twenties!”

“The Prodigy competition? With the Dragon King’s age, all the prodigies in the competition are probably older than the Dragon King, right? Even if a young prodigy becomes a prodigy king, he’s just an ant in front of the Dragon King, right?”

Some people suddenly whispered, and then their expressions became strange.

Prodigy king?

Suppressing the same era?

Compared to a mid-level immortal in his twenties, who was the founder of a force that could rival immortal sects, the so-called prodigy King might only be considered pretty good in his eyes!

In an instant, even the strongest disciples of immortal sects looked a little dazed!

All the immortal gods came to the sky above their respective immortal sects and looked down at all the disciples of the immortal sects.

“Today will be the first heaven’s chosen disciple competition of China’s jianghu. Every disciple who makes it onto the list represents the glory of an immortal sect. Those who make it onto the list will be rewarded by the immortal sect!”

As the grand elder of the Xuanyuan clan spoke, he waved his arm and items flew directly to a huge pillar of light in the middle.

“According to the ranking, the rewards will be selected in order. The most precious item is an immortal artifact that the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate made!”

“I now announce that the grand competition of the disciples of the Immortal Gate has officially begun!”

The voice of the grand elder of the Xuanyuan clan rang out in everyone’s ears.

The group of Immortals slowly landed on the platform of the disciples of the Immortal Gate. There were seats at the very front!

“So many treasures. The reward for being able to enter the top 21 is simply too crazy. The lowest is a grade-7 medicinal pill!”

“The most precious thing is actually an immortal god weapon. Moreover, it’s a custom-made immortal God weapon. It’s Too Rich!”

“The Dragon King is not only a middle-level immortal, but also a grandmaster of artifact refining. He can create immortal God weapons. If the first place in this grand competition is the bright moon, then the Dragon King is the radiant sun. Once the radiant sun appears, the bright moon loses its splendor!”

The disciples of the immortal sects looked at the objects in the light pillar in amazement, their eyes shining with a fiery light.

At the same time, all the disciples of the immortal sects were full of exclamations toward the dragon king.

Even the beauties on the Peerless Beauty chart all looked toward the Dragon Gate stage. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

However, when they saw the six women sitting together with the Dragon King on the stage, they were slightly stunned.

Each of the six women was more beautiful than the other. In terms of temperament and appearance, they were definitely comparable to the top five beauties on the Supreme Beauty chart, or even higher.

“At the beginning of the grand competition, there are five arenas in the arena. Except for the twenty seeded contestants, twenty-one disciples will be selected from all the disciples of the immortal sects. They will compete with the twenty seeded contestants for the twenty-one spots

“All strength is respected. There are no rules on the arenas. The winner is the king, and a life-and-death battle can be decided!”

The grand competition began. The rules stated that the winner was the king, and a life-and-death battle could be decided!

This was a heaven’s chosen competition, and it was also a battle between immortal sects. The Immortals and gods didn’t act, so the grudges had to be settled in the disciple competition.

This meant that this battle would be very bloody, and people would die in it.

The so-called genius competition was also a war between the immortal sects. The hatred could be resolved here.

The Immortal Gods were the chess players, and the disciples of the immortal sects were the chess pieces.

They controlled the Chess Pieces and played the game!

“Start the disciple competition of the immortal sects!”

A loud shout sounded out, indicating that the disciple competition of the immortal sects had begun.

In an instant, all the confident young geniuses were filled with fighting spirit.

“Among the immortal sects, My Xuan Yuan clan is the strongest. I, Xuan Yuan Hao, will be the first to appear. Who Wants to fight? !”

A disciple of the Xuan Yuan clan moved and directly jumped onto an arena in the center. He raised his head slightly and spoke arrogantly.
