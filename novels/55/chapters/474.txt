Chapter 475: Unexpected Battle

“Two Dan Realm Fire Demons!”

Wang Xian curled his lips slightly as he swept his gaze across all the treasures in the hall.

“Let’s enter!” said Wang Xian straightaway.

“We have a defensive weapon that can temporarily resist the Fire Demons. As long as we stall them for a while, my sister and I can go inside. With some luck, we could...”

“Let me test the strength of those Fire Demons!”

Before the young man could finish his words, Wang Xian leaped into the hall.

The five of them were appalled as they quickly shouted, “Bro, the Fire Demons are extremely strong. They’ll start to attack you frantically once you enter the side hall. Don’t be rash!”

“All of you stay outside!”

Without turning his head, he replied in a soft voice.

He was not being impulsive, but rather, he had no fear of those Fire Demons given his current strength.

Roar!

When Wang Xian stepped into the side hall, all the Fire Demons let out a roar. The two enormous Fire Demons which were lying in the center slowly got up.

A horrifying heatwave rushed at him as the air turned red instantly.

The entire space was covered in redness while some vague figures could be seen from the outside.

“Oh no, there’s no chance for him to survive even if he’s a Dan Realm Expert when he charged in recklessly!”

The young man had a dreadful look when he saw Wang Xian charge inside.

The girl in the center sighed without many choices. “Let’s wait over here!”

“Exterminate!”

Wang Xian scanned all the Fire Demons as soon as he entered the side hall. The Fire God Lotus was shaking in his hand, exuding blazing fiery-red lava.

The lava condensed into a lotus shape that lurched at its surroundings.

Beautiful yet, explosive.

Boom boom!

In a second, a violent explosion took place in the side hall. The flame enveloped the entire area.

Roar!

Roar!

“Hur?”

Suddenly, two enormous figures pounced onto Wang Xian. He raised his eyebrows and hurled the Fire God Lotus in his hand at them.

A tongue of flames darted at the two Dan Realm Fire Demons.

Growl!

The two Fire Demons opened their mouths at the flame and swallowed it down into their stomachs.

Wang Xian had a slight change in his expression as he slammed the Fire God Lotus at their heads.

Boom!

All of a sudden, two gigantic fiery-red hammers emerged from the two Fire Demons’ hands. They wielded the five-meter hammers at Wang Xian.

Wang Xian swung his hand as the radiance of the Fire God Lotus glowed to its maximum. A vast Flaming Lotus appeared in front of him to receive the blow from those gigantic fiery-red hammers.

“Earth-raging Flaming Lotus!”

A hoarse and violent voice cut the air abruptly while the ground under Wang Xian cracked all of a sudden. Numerous huge Flaming Lotuses that were condensed from huge flames struck at him. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Wang Xian was appalled. With a switch in his momentum, thick and heavy soil emerged. “Suppressing Earth!”

Immense Earth Dragon Energy brought peace back to the earth again as an Earth Shield blocked the attack of the Flaming Lotus.

“Flaming Sledge Hammer!”

Another bellow was heard. Wang Xian craned his neck upward and saw two mega Flaming Sledge Hammers coming down on him.

“Earth Shield!”

He raised his arm. With a quaking of the earth, bouts of soil surrounded him as the immense Earth Dragon Energy filled the air within a five-meter range around Wang Xian.

Boom!

Booming sound was heard, and the Earth Shield before Wang Xian began to crack.

“Damm, are these the Dan Realm Fire Demons?”

Wang Xian was aghast as he held the Fire God Lotus and staggered back. With a stern-looking face, he stared at the two Fire Demons.

The two Fire Demons glared at Wang Xian with pitch-black pupils and flames exploding from their sockets.

“Earth-raging Flaming Lotus and Flaming Sledge Hammers, all these are battle techniques!”

Wang Xian’s expression sank with a mixed look.

Given his current Level 8 strength of a Divine Dragon, the maximum level that he could take down was Level 12 in his human form and Level 13 in dragon form.

However, it was only pertaining to ordinary realms.

If he encountered equivalent-level existences that shared similar prestige bloodlines as him, it would be good enough to defeat them, let alone beating the higher-level ones.

Just like when he met Phoenix, Level 8 was the maximum that he could go against.

Besides, with the stronger opponents he encountered, the levels he could take down would drop.

The Fire Demons were this case as their combat power was far beyond his expectation. Two Dan Realm Fire Demons were actually on par with him.

That was to say, he could only take down maximum Level 11 when confronting Fire Demons.

In the face of Fire Demons, he was only able to take three levels higher than him, instead of the four when in human form.

If there were more formidable Fire Demons in the side hall, does that mean that I can’t defeat them even when I transform into a Divine Dragon?

“Battle techniques, battle techniques!” Wang Xian murmured to himself. The Divine Dragons had no battle techniques. In fact, they did not require one as a Divine Dragon was born to have First Divine Dragon Transformation.

As mighty as they were, all they needed was to practice Nine Divine Dragon Transformations, and naturally, they would reach the pinnacle of their race.

The time used to practice battle techniques was better used in enhancing cultivation.

However, some other creatures might be different as they had limited potential. Hence, they could only enhance their strength through various methods, including battle techniques.

With powerful battle techniques, they could gain freaky Superpowers.

“Powerful human relies on weapons to slay a dragon. If I have compelling battle techniques, I could easily exterminate these Fire Demons.”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes slightly as he swung his arm, tossing the Fire God Lotus aside.

“Even though I do not have battle techniques, I’m a Divine Dragon!”

Wang Xian’s physique had a rapid change.

An eight-meter-long Divine Dragon emerged as he suspended himself in the air, exuding a daunting vibe slowly.

Roar!

With a dragon bellow, the whole side hall quaked violently. Wang Xian slowly swung his tail left and right.

Invincible aura loomed over the Fire Demons.

Growl!

As soon as the two Fire Demons felt the terrifying aura, they trembled and let out soft roars.

“Go to hell!”

Wang Xian made a swift move and appeared on top of the Fire Demons’ heads instantly.

Growl!

The two Fire Demons raised their enormous Flaming Sledge Hammers and struck him with terror.

Boom!

Wang Xian stretched out his dragon claws and raked at the hammers.

Ka Ka Ka!

The compelling force swept the hammers aside as the dragon claws continued their downward ripping motion.

As soon as the heads of the Fire Demons were torn apart under the mighty force of the dragon claws, two fist-sized fire crystals appeared before Wang Xian’s eyes.

He revealed a smile and restored himself to his human form, grabbing the two fire crystals with his hand.

After turning into a Divine Dragon, killing the two Fire Demons was a breeze.

With a thought, he put on the pastel-blue uniform again. As Wang Xian surveyed his surroundings, he could not hide the thrill on the face.

Treasures, so many treasures!

He finally struck a fortune this time!

With an arm swing, he put the Spiritual Flame Ball on the wall.

[Lava Ball: Level 11]

“This Lava Ball is similar to the Spiritual Flame Balls, which I got previously.”

Wang Xian opened his mouth and brought out a Dragon Ball from it. The Dragon Ball immediately engulfed the Lava Ball.

He looked around and chuckled.
