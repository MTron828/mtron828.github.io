Chapter 2880: set off and swept across the entire region

“I think both of you want to Die!”

Wang Xian stood in front of the window of the Holy Tower. He stared at the two of them and said faintly.

An icy-cold murderous aura charged toward them.

“HMPH!”

The two of them could feel Wang Xian’s murderous aura. They snorted coldly and retreated backward vigilantly.

“Dragon King, wait for our revenge!”

The two of them said in a deep voice.

“You guys are talking too much nonsense. Since you guys are here today, don’t even think about leaving!”

Wang Xian looked at them. He moved slowly and arrived outside the window.

Buzz

In the next moment, the uninitiated holy wings appeared directly behind him.

“Huh?”

When they saw Wang Xian flying out, their expressions changed slightly. They were filled with vigilance.

“Dragon King, we will meet again soon. Next time, it will be on the battlefield!”

Shen Wu’s face was gloomy as he growled in a low voice.

“Let’s Go!”

The two of them looked at each other and flew backward.

As the Dragon Palace had a powerful array master, the Heaven Formation, they had to be wary of being trapped in the formation.

“The Dragon King scared them away!”

“It’s good to scare them away, HMPH!”

Some people whispered when they saw the Dragon King flying out and the two celestial thearchs preparing to leave in fear.

“Did I let you guys leave?”

At this moment, Wang Xian’s voice rang out again.

The faces of celestial thearchs Shenwu and parasol flame darkened.

It was extremely difficult to kill the other party between celestial thearchs. In a situation where they were of the same level and trapped the other party, it would require the combined efforts of three celestial thearchs to kill the other party.

Without the control of an array formation that sealed the space, the three celestial thearchs would not be able to keep a celestial thearch of the same level even if they worked together.

Even if the other party was a level two celestial thearch, the only way to kill a level one celestial thearch was to take him by surprise and kill him.

If the other party had already responded, a level one celestial thearch would be able to escape from a level two celestial thearch.

“Dragon King, don’t be arrogant!”

Upon hearing Wang Xian’s words, celestial thearch Shenwu and celestial thearch sunshade flame turned their heads and shouted at him with a slightly embarrassed expression.

At the same time, they were on high alert.

“Let’s Go!”

Without stopping for long, they sped up abruptly.

Facing the Dragon King, the leader of the Dragon Palace, they also had a hint of fear in their hearts.

“I said, if you’re here, don’t even think about leaving!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were cold when he saw them trying to escape.

His body had already disappeared halfway through his words.

In the next moment, an unexpected scene appeared.

When he finished his words, Wang Xian’s palm had already grabbed the necks of the two people.

Meanwhile, Emperor Shenwu and Emperor Parasol Flame, who were about to leave, were completely stunned. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

They did not have the time to react. They did not even sense that their necks had been grabbed by the Dragon King.

The two of them trembled and gulped. They turned their heads to look at Wang Xian with great difficulty.

“Do you know? Both of you deserve to die!”

Wang Xian looked at them and said without the slightest change in his expression.

“How… How is this possible?”

Both of their pupils constricted and their faces were filled with astonishment.

He captured them directly without any reaction?

What kind of speed was this?

They were already on high alert. Even their lord, the barren celestial emperor, or even the overlord, would find it difficult to keep them alive in a fight.

However, the Dragon King captured them in an instant.

They could not react in time to such a terrifying speed.

Wasn’t the Dragon King at the first level of the Celestial Emperor?

What was happening in front of them?

“Your… your speed, your strength…”

The Shen Wu Celestial Emperor widened his eyes. His pupils were bloodshot and filled with disbelief.

“Die, you two are courting death!”

Wang Xian moved.

Boom

The next moment, Wang Xian’s body landed at the bottom of the Holy Tower. Emperor Shenwu and Emperor Parasol Flame landed heavily on the ground.

Wang Xian stepped on their bodies with one foot.

Blood was flowing out of their seven orifices. Their eyes were still wide open.

However, there was no sign of life.

Buzz Buzz Buzz

The Sky of the Holy Nation changed drastically.

A mournful cry sounded out of thin air. Fire clouds rose into the sky and the earth trembled slightly.

Two celestial thearchs had fallen and the world had changed.

Gulp

At this moment, everyone around the sacred tower was stunned.

They widened their eyes and watched this scene in shock and horror.

From the moment Wang Xian flew out to the moment when the two celestial thearchs were about to leave in fear.

At the beginning, they were still having a discussion to vent their anger.

However, the Dragon King wanted them to stay.

In the next moment, the two of them were captured by the Dragon King. In the next moment, the bodies of the two celestial thearchs landed at the bottom of the Holy Tower and were gently stepped on by the Dragon King.

No one around them could see everything clearly.

By the time they reacted, the two celestial thearchs were already dead.

“These are celestial thearchs, two celestial thearchs!”

The bodies of the saint-level experts on the sacred tower were trembling.

They clearly knew the power of celestial emperors. This time, the Red Wind Celestial Emperor had become an emperor, and the saint-level experts were celebrating.

A Celestial Emperor was a supreme existence, an unrivaled existence.

But now, in front of them, two living celestial emperors were killed by the Dragon Palace Dragon King in an instant.

In an instant!

They couldn’t resist at all.

When everyone saw this scene, they couldn’t help but feel troubled.

The two divine emperors who had just threatened their lord, the Red Wind Divine Emperor, had died just like that!

“These are two divine emperors?”

Everyone felt very incredulous.

They had witnessed the fall of the divine emperor with their own eyes.

“How strong is this Dragon King?”

At this moment, they looked at the Calm Dragon King of the Dragon Palace in a daze.

What kind of existence was this?

He was not to be offended!

All the people from the sacred zone around them were filled with respect.

This was the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. He had risen in a short period of time. With the power of the Dragon Palace alone, he was not at a disadvantage against the imperial court and the Wizard Association. He had even chased them for billions of miles!

This was the legendary Dragon King of the Dragon Palace in the starry sky!

How terrifying!

“Hiss, this… this…”

At the top of the Holy Tower, God Emperor Shui and the others were stunned when they saw Wang Xian killing two god Emperors instantly.

Invincible battle technique widened his eyes and pointed downwards while trembling.

“This boss Wang is too heaven-defying!”

After more than ten seconds, Invincible battle technique roared with a face full of shock.

Boom

In the sky above the Holy Mother Pagoda, the Holy Masters and the four Divine Emperors of the Holy Region who had been paying attention to this place suddenly stood up when they saw Wang Xian instantly killing Emperor Shenwu and Emperor Parasol Flame.

“How is this possible!”

The holy master tightly gripped the scepter in his hand. His face was filled with shock.

Just now, he had witnessed the Dragon King’s speed.

This speed made him feel terrified.

As soon as the Dragon King made his move, he knew that he was absolutely no match for him.

Moreover, with such a terrifying speed, it was not too difficult to kill him!
