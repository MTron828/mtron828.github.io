Chapter 1420: 1420, what was a prodigy? 6

“This...”

Around the huge arena, when all the spectators saw Xiao Yue’s back being pointed at by a black spear.

Their hearts tightened, and their faces revealed embarrassed expressions.

This young man who came out to cause trouble had actually defeated Xiao Yue, the most outstanding young prodigy of their Flaming Sun Continent region.

Moreover, he had defeated him so easily, this... This...

“I actually lost...”

Xiao Yue tightly clenched her fist, her expression unsightly as she stared at Helian Hu.

“Haha, the Ten of you together might be able to make me pay a little more attention, but you alone, Hehe!”

Helian Hu laughed lightly, his gaze sweeping over the ten young prodigies of Xiao Yue, his face full of arrogance.

“This disciple of the blood stream sect, I wonder what your intention is in defeating the elites of the flaming sun continent. Are you showing off your strength?”

On the main viewing platform, the Flaming Sun City Lord slowly stood up and asked Helian Hu of the blood stream sect indifferently.

“HM? What? The Blood Stream sect?”

“That young man is from the Blood Stream sect? The Blood Stream sect is a powerful sect in the demi-human graveyard. It can be ranked in the top three among all the sects and sects!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“What are the disciples of the Blood Stream sect doing here?”

When the city lord of Flaming Sun City’s voice rang out, everyone was slightly shocked. They stared at Helian Hu with faces full of shock.

This was because flaming sun city was only about a hundred thousand kilometers away from the demi-human graveyard. It wasn’t too far away.

They were still aware of a great sect like the blood stream sect.

This was the true colossus within the demi-human graveyard. Even the current dragon and Phoenix Empire was slightly weaker.

“Haha, then let me introduce myself again. The Blood Stream sect, Helian Hu, is ranked seventeenth on the prodigy roll. I also barely made it onto the prodigy roll, unlike my senior brother, who is ranked seventh on the prodigy roll!”

As Helian Hu spoke, his gaze looked towards a remote spot on the stage.

“HM?”

His words shocked everyone once again, and they looked towards the stage with faces full of shock.

“Meng Wenbing, ranked 7th on the Prodigy Roll!”

A young man who looked somewhat old-fashioned streaked across a black shadow and directly landed beside Helian Hu.

“Ranked 17th on the prodigy roll, ranked 7th on the prodigy roll, this...”

“The Prodigy roll seems to be a ranking on the prodigy stage in the demi-human graveyard. Those who can enter the Prodigy roll are all peerless prodigies!”

Everyone in the audience stared at Helian Hu and the expressionless Meng Wenbing, their faces full of astonishment.

“What? You’re only ranked seventeenth!”

On the arena, the ten youths of the flaming sun continent stared at Helian Hu, their faces revealing an embarrassed expression.

He was only ranked seventeenth, but he was actually so terrifying?

Then, that black-clothed youth who didn’t speak at the side was ranked seventh. wasn’t he even more terrifying?

This made Xiao Yue and the others’faces extremely unsightly.

“That’s right, we are the true heaven’s favorites!”

Helian Hu saw their shocked expressions, and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly. “In your place, you can never think of becoming Heaven’s favorites!”

“Only by going to the true heaven’s favorites battlefield, to the LADYBOY graveyard, can you all become the true heaven’s favorites!”

“Just like The Prodigy competition held by the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty. Hehe, it would only make you laugh. If you really took it out, it would be a disgrace!”

His mocking voice resounded throughout the entire arena, and everyone could hear it clearly!

This caused everyone’s expressions to change slightly, and they felt somewhat embarrassed.

They all knew that the prodigy stage of the transvestite tomb was the center of the entire Liuhai region.

As long as one ascended the prodigy stage, they would become the prodigies of the entire region, the prodigies of the tens of billions of people.

The current Prodigy competition held by the Dragon and Phoenix Empire was indeed on a different level from the prodigy stage.

Now that they were directly ridiculed by a prodigy on the prodigy stage, their expressions kept changing.

“Two members of the Blood Stream sect, watch your words. If you don’t know what’s good for you, I don’t mind disciplining you elders!”

When the city lord of Flaming Sun City heard Helian Hu’s words, he spoke directly with a cold face.

“Haha, City Lord of Flaming Sun City, did the disciples of our sect say something wrong?”

A loud laughter was heard, and the other three members of the blood stream sect flew directly into the sky.

Three middle-aged old men with white hair stood in the middle. He stared at the city lord of Flaming Sun City with a face full of smiles!

A faint power was emitted from their bodies.

The three people floating in the sky suddenly appeared above everyone’s heads like a huge mountain.

This caused everyone’s breathing to stop and shock appeared on their faces.

“This power feels even more terrifying than the city Lord!”

An old man muttered.

The expression of the city lord of Flaming Sun City changed slightly. Although he didn’t know the three people from the blood stream sect, he could feel a terrifying power from their bodies.

He wasn’t a match for them.

This caused the flaming sun city Lord’s expression to become extremely grave.

“I wonder what your blood stream sect’s large sect is doing in our Flaming Sun City?”

The Flaming Sun City Lord expressionlessly asked the old man.

“I’m just casually strolling around. I just happened to run into your competition. I feel that these ten children aren’t bad!”

The old man in the middle revealed a trace of a smile. His gaze swept over the ten youths on the arena as he said with a smile.

“Oh? What do you mean?”

The Flaming Sun City Lord slightly narrowed his eyes as he stared at the three people from the blood stream sect.

“Our Blood Stream sect is currently recruiting disciples. The ten children on the stage have the qualifications to enter the blood stream sect. I wonder if you are interested?”

The old man glanced at the Flaming Sun City Lord and the ten people from the Daybreak Moon sect who landed on the stage at the end and suddenly said.

“What?”

The city lord of Flaming Sun City was slightly startled. Even the ten youths on the arena were completely stunned.

They actually wanted to recruit them into the blood stream sect!

This...

“Blood Stream sect, we are citizens of the dragon-phoenix Empire. They are the elites of our dragon-phoenix Empire. They are not people that you can recruit just because you want to!”

The city lord of Flaming Sun City growled in a low voice with a gloomy expression.

“Haha, Our Blood Stream sect is a sect. It has nothing to do with your dynasty. Moreover, our blood stream sect is a top sect in the human-demon graveyard. If you join us, we will give you more resources!”

The old man laughed and glanced at the young people of Daybreak Moon and the others. “The true chosen ones can only be born in our blood stream sect!”

“The blood stream sect actually wants to recruit Xiaoyue and the others!”

“This is the blood stream sect! I never thought that they would actually want to recruit Xiaoyue and the others!”

“This...”

In the audience stands, everyone watched this scene in astonishment.

The experts of the blood stream sect actually personally invited them to join the blood stream sect. This was the blood stream sect!

“What is a heaven’s Pride? If you stay here, you will never be able to become a heaven’s pride. Only by joining our blood stream sect and stepping onto the Heaven’s Pride Stage will you be a true heaven’s Pride!”

“Staying here is just like a frog at the bottom of a well!”

Helian Hu stared at Xiao Yue and the others with a face full of smiles and said with a smile.

Helian Hu’s words made the ten people’s faces full of emotion.

They were able to become the top ten of the flaming sun continent region at such a young age. which one of them did not have the heart of a powerhouse.

They also wanted to become a true heaven’s pride that looked down on the current generation!

They also wanted to be as powerful as Helian Hu, or even more powerful than him!

The blood stream sect was such a powerful sect’s invitation, so they were naturally extremely moved!

On the main viewing platform, the Flaming Sun City Lord saw the ten hesitant young men, and his expression changed slightly. His expression was somewhat unsightly.

The Blood Stream sect was a top-tier large sect that had personally invited them and used the name of a heaven’s pride to entice them. which young man wouldn’t be moved?

“Haha, a Heaven’s favorite? What’s a heaven’s favorite? If I say you’re a heaven’s favorite, you’re a heaven’s favorite!”

Suddenly, a proud voice resounded through the sky!
