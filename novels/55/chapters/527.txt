Chapter 528: You Are A Demon!

When the dragonians triggered the effects of the Devil Wings, all the experts from Dong Hua Sacred Sect could feel a terrifying aura approaching them from behind.

“Shit! Their wings can greatly increase their speed!”

Sensing the fast approaching dragonian behind him, the bald middle-aged man was flabbergasted. He gritted his teeth, held the Vajra tightly in his hand and turned around forcefully.

“Among the Inborn experts, I have not encountered anyone who is a match for me in Dong Hua Sacred Sect. I can still pull one of you to the grave with me!”

The bald middle-aged man grimaced in fear. The Vajra glowed dazzlingly as he swung down heavily towards a dragonian.

Weng!

“What!”

Just as the Vajra was about to land on the dragonian, an identical dragonian appeared beside him.

This took the bald middle-aged man by surprise as his actions slowed.

Tsk!

A cold snort resounded as the dragon claw of the dragonian attacked towards the bald middle-aged man.

The bald middle-aged man was astonished as he shifted the Vajra across his body.

Bam!

A dragonian and an illusory shadow attacked the bald middle-aged man with identical movements, taking the bald middle-aged man by complete surprise.

Bam!

As the dragon claw swept across the shoulder of the bald middle-aged man, a long wound was torn open instantly.

The bald middle-aged man was shocked. At this moment, the attack from the dragonian fell once again.

One strike came after another with immense force. What was most terrifying was still the speed. Within close proximity, the dragonian could shift his attack easily.

Terrifying attacks together with the distractions of the devil shadow left the bald middle-aged man with no strength to retaliate.

Argh!

In the end, the bald middle-aged man let out a desperate cry.

Argh!

At this moment, incessant cries filled the sky.

All the dragonians had the strength to challenge those who were stronger than them. Now that they had the Inborn-level Devil Shadow Masks and Devil Wings as enhancements, the experts from Dong Hua Sacred Sect wouldn’t be able to stand against them.

As for those disciples who had not reached the Inborn Realm, they were easily slaughtered.

All they saw was a devil shadow dashing toward them. The next moment, they would feel vitality quickly leaving their bodies.

“YOU... How dare you slaughter the disciples from our Dong Hua Sacred Sect!”

At this moment, Old Zhou, who had been standing in the middle. locked down by Wang Xian, had noticed the disciples around him being easily killed. He glowered at Wang Xian with blood-red eyes as he growled.

“So what if we did. Since your Dong Hua Sacred Sect dared to offend the Dragon Sect, you must have had the understanding that you guys would be killed by us!”

Wang Xian stared coldly at Old Zhou. When he finished his words, he also struck.

“In that case, I’ll see how strong the Dragon King really is!”

Seeing Wang Xian charging towards him, Old Zhou lifted his right hand and a longsword appeared in it.

The dullish-yellow longsword was incomparably fearsome as Old Zhou swung it towards Wang Xian.

Rumble!

Terrifying cracks extended as the tough floor split rapidly. The edge of the sword went for Wang Xian directly.

Wang Xian waved his arm as the cracks extending towards him were dispersed. He smirked and made an instantaneous shift towards Old Zhou.

“Today, you have to die too!”

When Old Zhou heard Wang Xian, his heart skipped a beat. He clenched onto the longsword in his hand tightly, gritted his teeth and roared, “There are only four minutes left. You can kill me? Tsk!”

“As I said, it won’t take more than a minute!”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes as he swung his dragon claws towards Old Zhou.

“Although I’m not a match for you, I’ll still be able to escape if I want to.

Hearing Wang Xian, Old Zhou was exceptionally gloomy. He moved and fled immediately.

Rumble! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

However, a huge two-meter wall rose from the ground behind him all of a sudden.

In just an instant, his escape route was sealed. This greatly surprised him.

“Escape? That’s not an option!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly as his golden claws tore across.

“How can this be. Aren’t you a fire attribute cultivator? Why are you using earth and metal attribute...?”

Seeing Wang Xian’s attack, Old Zhou was overwhelmed with fear.

He instantly tried to dodge to the side.

However, the momentary blockage by the stone wall had exhausted all the advantage he had for escaping.

The dragon claw grabbed towards Old Zhou’s head.

Old Zhou was prepared for it. He instantly swung the longsword in his hand ruthlessly towards the dragon claw.

Boom!

Shockwaves from the terrifying clash reverberated and Old Zhou pivoted off the terrifying strength to escape.

Swish swish swish!

However, the trees before him started growing and wrapping towards his body.

This frightened Old Zhou as he swung his longswords towards the surrounding trees.

Pfft!

While he was distracted from chopping the trees, a terrifying dragon claw penetrated his body.

“You... You are... You are a demon!”

Feeling his body being pierced through, Old Zhou’s eyes were filled with desperation. He turned around and looked fearfully at Wang Xian.

The source of the fear came from the bottom of his heart. He had not experienced this, even from his sect leader.

Creepy attacks and the ability to use multiple attributes. He wasn’t a human!

He was a demon!

“Nope! I’m a divine dragon!”

When Wang Xian’s final five words reached him, his vision was starting to fade.

Bam!

A Dan Realm expert and the Supreme Elder of Dong Hua Sacred Sect had fallen to the ground.

At this moment, Mo Yuan reported, “Dragon King, all the disciples of Dong Hua Sacred Sect have been killed without exception!”

Mmm!

Wang Xian nodded his head. Fifty dragonians against fifteen Inborn experts. That should have been complete domination.

In a one on one situation, a dragonian would still be able to kill an Inborn expert within a minute. The several times difference in strength would only make it quicker.

“The reinforcements of the Dong Hua Sacred Sect will probably be here in four minutes!”

Wang Xian looked around him. He had no intentions of looking for spiritual stones. He turned to Mo Yuan and said plainly, “Didn’t Dong Hua Sacred Sect upload this incident on the Underworld website. In that case, let’s add in the outcome for them!”

“Yes, Dragon King!” Mo Yuan chuckled.

He took a phone from one of the disciples of Dong Hua Sacred Sect, looked across with contempt and took several photos.

After which, he entered the Underworld website and saw the hottest thread started by that disciple of Dong Hua Sacred Sect.

[Trapped beast? Slaughtering the Dragons? Our Dragon King has made it clear that it won’t stop till one party perishes. Today’s just the beginning!]

With roughly twenty words and no further elaborations, Mo Yuan appended a few additional pictures.

Those were pictures of the corpses of disciples, Inborn experts and the Supreme Elder of Dong Hua Sacred Sect.

After posting the comment, Mo Yuan nodded his head at Wang Xian.

“Let’s go. I’ll leave this surprise for Dong Hua Sacred Sect!” Wang Xian commented plainly. Taking flight, they headed back towards Rivertown.

“Haha! Who would have expected the foolish Dragon Sect would dare to barge into the spiritual ore mine today? Even the Heavens are helping us!”

Soon after Wang Xian left with the dragonians, a peal of unruly laughter reverberated from afar.
