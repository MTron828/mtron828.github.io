Chapter 581: Saint Forge Workshop Is Indeed Trash (1)

Yong Chang would soon descend to the real world, and information about the real world had been divulged in Yong Chang Immortal Sect.

But the people and forces in Yong Chang world were not worried about the real world at all.

It was just the Age of Dharma Decline. When they arrived in the real world, they would dominate and roam around without any difficulties.

The Underworld in the real world might seem like trash, but they were more concerned about the other Immortal Sects in the rest of the Nine Cauldrons’ Worlds.

Since they were only part of the nine worlds, there would be powerful cultivators in the other eight worlds as well.

The people in Yong Chang world would need to be well-prepared to face these cultivators.

Hence, all the forces and families were making their preparation as soon as the news of Yong Chang world descending to the real world was out.

All the families and forces had converted their resources into strength to deal with the real world.

Metallic materials were converted to Spiritual Equipment, Spiritual Grass to elixir pills.

That was the reason why alchemist masters and blacksmith masters became popular figures while the elixir pills and weapons had become the top-selling items in the shops.

As the biggest workshop for refining equipment and elixir pills, various alchemist masters and blacksmith masters worked in Saint Forge Workshop, and their business was unusually hot.

Even those pre-ordered Spiritual Equipment and elixir pills could only be available months later.

For the last two days, many customers had gathered at the door of Saint Forge Workshop. At one glance, one would know that all of them came from families that possessed relatively great strength in the Yong Chang world.

“Saint Forge Workshop is pricey, and even those unknown alchemists are arrogant. Since they cannot take in that much business, we should not let some of our friends suffer while waiting in line for such an unscrupulous shop!”

The long-haired middle-aged man of Tianwen Sect drew a cold smile and murmured to himself.

“That’s right, many people do not know about that master’s shop. We should help him to promote his shop!”

The remaining four middle-aged men and elders revealed creepy smiles.

The five of them exchanged gazes as they grinned at each other. They slowed down their carriage and walked slowly toward the Saint Forge Workshop.

“I know everyone can’t wait, but you guys need to wait. It will take another one and a half months before it’s your turn!”

“Saint Forge Workshop is the biggest alchemy and blacksmith workshop in Yong Chang City. No other places are comparable to us. But you guys need to wait!”

When the five people arrived at the door, they heard the staff speaking to a few in-charges from various forces and families with arrogance.

The people from the various forces and families had twisted expressions, but they did not dare to flare up.

After all, they needed Saint Forge Workshop.

“Everyone, just queue up and that will do. All it takes is another one or two months. Don’t be anxious.”

At this time, several middle-aged men told the surrounding crowd this with a calm look.

“The weapons and elixir pills of Mt. Zhenliu are in the process of being refined now. You guys are not in a hurry, but we are!” said an old man to that middle-aged man coldly with an awful expression.

“Haha, better than not waiting in the line!”

The middle-aged man from Mt. Zhenliu chuckled softly as he spoke. Several people turned to the five men on the carriage. With lips drawn, he continued, “Unlike some forces who can’t even get in the line.”

“Hur?”

Upon hearing what the people from Mt. Zhenliu said, some of the elders at the side furrowed their brows and peered to the side when they spotted the five men from Tianwen Sect.

Mt. Zhenliu and Tianwen Sect were enemies, and everyone on the spot knew about that.

“Haha, the Tianwen Sect complained that the waiting time was too long, and said they were not going to refine anything in Saint Forge Workshop. I would like to see which other workshops can accept such a large volume of orders apart from Saint Forge Workshop!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The staff at the side peered at the five men from Tianwen Sect and issued subtle warnings to the rest of the forces.

The in-charges of the forces had a change in their expression and took in a deep breath.

“Well, we can wait. Sorry for all the trouble. These are some gifts of appreciation.”

Several of them fished out some gifts and handed them over to the staff with twisted expressions.

“Mm!”

The staff of Saint Forge Workshop nodded gently with broad smiles.

“Hur?”

At this time, the five men from Tianwen Sect, who had just arrived, overheard their conversations. All of them revealed a tinge of coldness and disdain in their eyes.

Before they could even seek trouble, the other party was already picking on them.

“Hey, Tianwen Sect, where are you heading to? Have you found a master of alchemy and blacksmithing?”

Before the five men from Tianwen Sect speak, those middle-aged men from Mt. Zhenliu ridiculed them for their misfortunes.

Mt. Zhenliu and Tianwen Sect had been going against each other for centuries. They would not miss any chance of bringing down their opponents.

“Alchemy master, blacksmith master?”

Upon hearing their sneers, a strange look surfaced on the faces of the five men from Tianwen Sect.

“Of course we did. We even got our Spiritual Equipment and elixir pills done!”

“Haha, interesting!”

Several middle-aged men from Mt. Zhenliu chuckled as they looked on, scornful of what they heard. “You guys just want to act tough!”

“Who else in the entire Yong Chang City, other than Saint Forge Workshop, has a blacksmith master and alchemy master?”

“Haha, interesting!”

The staff of Saint Forge Workshop sneered upon hearing it.

“Haha!”

The five men from Tianwen Sect also burst out laughing when they heard their sarcasm. With unbridled looks on their faces, they stared right into their eyes. “Don’t assume the Saint Forge Workshop dominates the entire Yong Chang City. You bunch of arrogant brats. Even an insignificant staff member dares to act insolently!”

“Well, when it comes to blacksmithing and alchemy, the Saint Forge Workshop is the best in Yong Chang City!”

That staff member narrowed his eyes with his usual pridefulness on his face.

“Some people are fuming with anger since they can’t find alchemy and blacksmith masters!”

The few middle-aged men from Mt. Zhenliu slightly lifted their chins, beaming, as they enjoyed the flustered looks of Tianwen Sect.

A few in-charges from other forces shook their heads slowly as they looked at Tianwen Sect.

To them, the five of them did look as though they had lost their minds out of panic.

“Is that so? You guys are really confident. Do you think Saint Forge Workshop rules the entire market of Yong Chang?”

A fiery-tempered middle-aged man stood up on the carriage immediately, revealing an insolent look.

“Brazen brats. Does Tianwen Sect need Saint Forge Workshop to forge weapons and refine pills for us? Do you think I care? The Saint Forge Workshop is just an unscrupulous shop for us!”

“Haha, I’ll show you the things we had refined by a master. If not, you guys would think that Saint Forge Workshop is the only shop in the entire Yong Chang City!”
