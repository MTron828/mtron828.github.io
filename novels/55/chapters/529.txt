Chapter 530: The Arrival Of The Golden Swordfish Race

The entire Underworld was in a frenzy after the Dragon Sect annihilated a group of experts from the Dong Hua Sacred Sect.

Everyone could only heave a sigh helplessly.

The major battle between the orthodox sects and Diabolism was just about to erupt. The Dragon King annihilating the Remains was undoubtedly an exceptional piece of good news. However, he had also killed a group of experts from Dong Hua Sacred Sect, denting the overall strength of the alliance of the orthodox sects.

“We could only pin our hopes on the battle tomorrow between the sect leader of Dong Hua Sacred Sect, Nie Wushuang, and Emperor Qi from Diabolism. This battle will dictate the fate of the entire Underworld!”

“I really hope that Sect Leader Nie Wushuang will win. In this case, Diabolism would have no choice but to go into seclusion once again!”

At night, the attention of the martial artists in the Underworld had shifted from the Dragon King of the Dragon Sect to the major battle the next day. Everyone was gloomy and feeling a little worried.

Since Emperor Qi of Diabolism had dared to challenge Sect Leader Nie Wushuang, it would only mean that Emperor Qi had a strength that was close to Nie Wushuang.

In the major battle the next day, no one could guarantee that Nie Wushuang would emerge victorious. After all, the name of Diabolism still instilled fear in the minds of many people.

[The strongest expert from the Underworld, Sect Leader Nie Wushuang from Dong Hua Sacred Sect vs the strongest expert from Diabolism, Sect Leader Nie Wushuang from Devil Corpse Palace!]

When Wang Xian arrived at Rivertown and saw the messages on the Underworld forum, he couldn’t help but show a little hesitation.

All the martial artists in the entire Underworld would likely be going to watch the life and death battle between the strongest existences.

Let’s go take a look tomorrow. A battle of this level isn’t common and I can also catch a glimpse of the strength of Diabolism! Wang Xian thought to himself. He naturally wouldn’t skip such a grand occasion.

Bzz bzz!

At this moment, Wang Xian’s phone rang. When he picked it up, he was surprised to learn that it was from Mo Qinglong.

“What happened?” Wang Xian accepted the call without hesitation.

“Dragon King, Prime Minister Turtle and the other experts have been revived!” Mo Qinglong’s voice sounded from the other end of the phone. This was a pleasant surprise for Wang Xian.

“They are revived? What is their strength level now?” Wang Xian asked in anticipation.

Considering that they were gathering energy for revival in the Dragon Transformation Pool, their strength would likely experience a substantial boost.

“Prime Minister Turtle and the other leaders have reached the Budding Realm. As for the rest, they are largely in the Dan Realm and Inborn Realm!” Mo Qinglong answered.

“Budding Realm!”

Wang Xian’s eyes beamed with excitement.

Now that Prime Minister Turtle, Roving Heavens, Roving Yaksha and the rest had reached the Budding Realm, it would mean that there were roughly a dozen-odd Budding Realm existences among the Dragon Palace members.

A dozen-odd Level 12 existences and a group of Dan Realm experts was sufficiently strong.

Wang Xian’s eyes gleamed with agitation. With this level of strength, not many forces could stand up against them, even on the international stage.

At the very least, all the forces he encountered in Dubai previously wouldn’t be a match for him.

“How did the guidance of the golden swordfish race go?” asked Wang Xian.

“Dragon King, they have no issues with interacting with humans. Moreover, they have high intelligence. It shouldn’t be a problem if you want to send them onto land!” Mo Qinglong answered.

Wang Xian nodded his head, hesitating for a moment before continuing. “You can come back now. Bring the golden swordfish race with you!”

“Yes, Dragon King. We should be able to reach Rivertown by 2 am!”

Mo Qinglong nodded his head.

Wang Xian hung up the phone and knocked on the table with his hand.

The golden swordfish race could take on human form. Wang Xian was prepared to let them handle some forces on the seas, starting from the disordered region.

Besides that, he was prepared to gather resources for the upgrade of the Dragon Palace.

Among the golden swordfish race, there was a Level 12 Budding Realm existence, five at the Dan Realm, and the rest were at the Inborn Realm. In total, there were over 150 of them.

This force was sufficiently strong.

Looking at the time, Wang Xian noticed that it was already past 10 pm. He hesitated for a moment before walking towards the villa.

When Wang Xian entered the villa, he instantly picked up Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue’s presence.

“What should we do, Sister Qingyue? Now that the foreign girl is acting like this every day, what should we do?”

“She’s trying to get on our good books every day! Tsk! She’s even a princess from Dubai!”

“However, it still feels pretty good to have a princess trying to curry favor from us!”

“What’s the matter, Shuqing? Are you going to give in?”

“How can that be possible. I would never give in. Tsk! It’s all Xiao Xian’s fault. Oh, right! This scumbag has been running out every day recently. Do you think he will bring another girl back in a few days?”

The two of them were conversing in a room. When Guan Shuqing made that statement, Wang Xian could feel both of them sitting up on the bed instantly.

“That’s a real possibility. All dragons are lustful and this is fully on display with him!”

Lan Qingyue gritted her teeth. The sounds of her teeth grinding gave Wang Xian a chill down his spine.

“If he dares to bring another girl back, we shall not talk to him. Not for eternity!” Guan Shuqing grumbled furiously.

Wang Xian, who was standing outside, couldn’t help but rub his nose. He hesitated for a moment before tip-toeing towards their room.

While the two of them were having an emotional conversation, Wang Xian appeared before the door and removed all his clothes.

“Hello, I’m back!” Wang Xian pushed opened the door, shouting while naked and pouncing onto the bed directly.

“YOU...”

Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue, who had been chatting, were stunned.

“Get out of here!”

“I’m not going to!”

“Scumbag! You are a pervert!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Yes, yes. I’m a pervert!”

“YOU...!”

Wu wu!

Wang Xian enjoyed the great feelings of being conquered.

“Scram!”

While he was reliving the excitement three hours later, he was kicked off the bed.

Looking at the two furious girls, Wang Xian walked out with a sheepish smile.

“Soon! Soon! Everything will be resolved soon! If it isn’t this time, it will be the next!” Wang Xian mumbled to himself. Returning to the floating island, he waited for Mo Qinglong’s arrival.

Currently, Wang Xian wouldn’t even feel the slightest bit of fatigue even if he did not sleep for ten full days.

2 am. A boat approached the floating island slowly.

On the island, figure after figure jumped off the boat. Over a hundred burly figures that were over two meters tall had landed on the island.

They looked around the island curiously.

“Dragon King!”

When Wang Xian walked over, everyone went on their knees and greeted him respectfully.

“You may rise!”

Wang Xian looked towards Mo Qinglong before turning to the golden swordfish race.

“Your name will be Roving Sword from here onwards. You will be responsible to lead the entire golden swordfish race.”

Wang Xian gave the leader of the golden swordfish race a name.

They were covered in a layer of golden scales and held incomparably sharp longswords in their hands.

The shape was slightly different from typical longswords. The golden glow of their bodies also felt extremely sharp.

Their longswords were connected to their arms. These were the sharp weapons they’d had on their heads previously.

The might of these longswords would differ based on their strength level. They could match weapons of a similar level and were insanely powerful.
