“Oh right, I think I saw something in the system treasury!”

Wang Xian’s heart skipped a beat. He recalled the special item he encountered when he browsed through the system treasury the last time.

He looked at the information in his mind and a smile appeared on his face.

Spiritual storage bag: 10 kilometers in circumference

It can store living things.

It requires 250,000 dragon crystals!

A spiritual storage bag that was worth 200,000 was not a small price for Wang Xian.

If it was converted into spirit stones, it would cost about 3 billion middle-grade spirit stones.

Besides being equivalent to a large-scale interspatial ring, the spiritual storage bag also had a powerful effect. It could store living things.

At that time, Wang Xian took a glance at it and gave it up because the price was too high.

Now, it was suitable to exchange for the nearly 100,000 corpses of the ferocious beasts.

Moreover, the corpses of the ferocious beasts were just the beginning. He still had to prepare for the rest of the ferocious beasts’corpses.

“Exchange!”

Wang Xian looked at his dragon energy. He still had 300,000 dragon crystals. He could buy one.

Buzz

A very small cloth bag appeared in his hand. He didn’t know what material the bag was made of, but it looked extremely soft.

Wang Xian passed the bag to the side and the bag slowly disappeared. Ao Yao kept it.

“Return to the city immediately!”

Deputy Captain Meng’s order rang out. All the soldiers immediately lined up.

“Line up!”

Wang Xian walked over. His gaze swept across the students of the demon hunter college and he shouted softly.

The students didn’t hesitate at all. They immediately lined up obediently.

After witnessing Wang Xian’s powerful scouting and commanding abilities, no one doubted Wang Xian’s abilities anymore.

In addition to his powerful abilities, even the instructors couldn’t compare to him.

“Let’s Go!”

All the soldiers of the riding wind battle team rushed towards Shenghai Town. The three academies followed them immediately.

On the ground, hundreds of thousands of corpses of water wolves and ferocious beasts were left behind.

When everyone’s figures disappeared, a white shadow appeared and stored all the bodies on the ground into the storage spiritual bag.

“We’ve made a fortune. Even if it’s only the bodies of some level two and level three ferocious beasts, they can’t withstand the huge number. A hundred thousand bodies can help the three thousand members of the Dragon Palace to advance to level two and level three of the extraordinary realm!”

When the strange demon handed the storage spiritual bag to him, Wang Xian revealed a smile on his face.

The group traveled at a speed of less than half an hour and arrived at Shenghai Town.

“Head to the resting area. Everyone, close your eyes and rest. You may not be able to sleep or rest for the next few days!”

The four instructors spoke to all the students. Director Qian looked at Wang Xian with a complicated gaze.

Initially, he had thought of using some means to get his son to be the team leader. However, it seemed like... That was impossible!

He could even command the entire riding wind battle team temporarily. Now, even if he asked his son to be the team leader, the rest of the students might not agree.

There was no way to compare. They were not on the same level.

“Yes, teacher!”

The students nodded and followed his gaze to look at Wang Xian, Xia houming, and some other students. They walked over and continued to flatter him.

The feelings of admiration were endless...

Wang Xian smiled faintly.

At the back, Hai Wen looked at Wang Xian’s figure with jealousy. His face was filled with helplessness.

When they returned to their resting place, all the students sat cross-legged on the ground to recover their exhausted energy.

“Student Wang Xian, come over here first. Let’s go to the mayor’s residence!”

Ten minutes later, a teacher suddenly rushed over and shouted at him.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian stood up and followed behind the teacher. He asked curiously, “What’s wrong, teacher? are the ferocious beasts attacking?”

“The situation is much more serious than we thought. Deputy Captain Meng asked me to call you over. It might be troublesome next!”

The teacher frowned and said with a worried expression.

“Is that so?”

Wang Xian revealed a hint of surprise as he followed behind and walked towards the mayor’s residence.

“Father, you should go back and rest. Your injuries are so serious!”

“That’s right. Mayor Jin, you should go back and rest. Leave the situation here to us!”

Just as he reached the door, Wang Xian heard voices coming from inside.

As he entered the hall, he looked over and saw deputy chief Meng sitting at the front with a solemn expression. Jin Qianyuan, who was sitting at the side, was sitting below with a pale face.

At the side, a girl was standing at the side and talking to Jin Qianyuan.

“Jin Liuyan, he is actually the daughter of the Mayor!”

Wang Xian looked over in surprise. Following that, he swept his gaze across the surroundings and realized that everyone’s expressions were not looking good.

He walked over and sat at the back.

“It’s alright. Although his injuries are more serious, it’s not a big problem for him to sit here!”

Jin Qianyuan waved his hand. Jin Liuyan had no choice but to pour him a cup of medicine.

“The Demon Beast siege this time has far exceeded our expectations. I didn’t expect that we would suffer heavy losses when dealing with the weakest Frog Skin Demon Beast Group among the Five Demon Beast groups. Two transcendent level 9 blood savage demon beasts almost left me there!”

Jin Qianyuan’s face didn’t have a trace of blood as he said worriedly.

The matter of the demon beasts attacking the city this time was a bit tricky. If it wasn’t good, the entire holy sea town would be broken through.

“There are two blood savage beasts controlling the Frog Skin Beasts, and eight rank nine transcendent blood savage beasts controlling the water wolf. During the battle, they even talked about their king. I think the king of the blood savage beasts should be half-step void interpretation!”

Vice Commander Meng’s face darkened, he said with some fear, “The weakest frog-skin beast race has two rank nine transcendent blood savage beasts controlling them, and the other three beast races have about 20 rank nine transcendent blood savage beasts!”

“20? 20 rank nine transcendent beasts, plus hundreds of thousands of beasts. Our holy sea town can’t resist them at all!”

The President of Holy Sea Town’s Demon Hunters Association had an ugly expression on his face. His voice trembled as he said, “Furthermore, according to the information we received, some of the ferocious beasts around holy sea town are planning to make a move.”

“Vice commander Meng, Can East Sea town still send experts over? Otherwise...”

He did not finish his sentence, but everyone knew what he was about to say.

Not long ago, the wind riding squad went to eliminate the Water Wolf clan, which was ranked second among the five fierce beast clans, while the group of experts from holy sea town eliminated the weakest frog-skinned fierce beast.

In the end, the mayor almost died, and holy sea town only managed to eliminate the frog-skinned fierce beast clan after suffering heavy losses.

In addition, the two blood savage beasts that controlled the frog-skinned fierce beast escaped.

This made the high-level officials of holy sea town feel some fear. There were still three fierce beast clans!

Moreover, according to deputy commander Meng’s information, there were even kings among the blood savage beasts. This made the situation even more dangerous.

In addition, the fierce beasts around Holy Sea Town were restless. This time, holy sea town was in imminent danger.

If there weren’t any experts to help, it would really be over.

A huge crisis had already enveloped holy sea town.
