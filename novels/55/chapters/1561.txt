Chapter 1562: 1,562 sages of Light 1

“Junior sister Jian ‘er, junior sister Jian ‘er!”

At night, a group of people came to Ling Jian ‘ER’s courtyard, and Bing Jing Huan’s voice sounded.

Beside Bing Jing Huan was the leader, an old man dressed in ice-white clothes. In the middle of his clothes was embroidered a dragon from the extraordinary continent.

The King of the Ice Heart Empire, as well as Bing Jing Huan and the other princes and princesses, had personally come.

Their faces carried a trace of curiosity and shock.

When they had just learned of the blood incident that had occurred because of the three iceheart grasses in Ling Jian ‘ER’s hands, the king of the Iceheart Empire had a face full of shock.

The appearance of the Sky Devil, and the killing of 25 insightful void Tier 7 experts.

This news had shaken the entire vast region, and his face was filled with shock.

25 rank 7 void interpretation experts?

There were only seven rank 7 void interpretation experts in the entire iceheart empire.

However, that Sky Demon had killed 25 of them in a short period of time.

All of this was because of the three sword heart grass.

The sword heart grass that Ling Jian ‘ER had obtained by accident in the Black Screen Garden.

When he learned that Ling Jian ‘ER had returned to his residence, the king of the Iceheart Empire immediately came over personally.

Bing Jinghuan and the other princes and princesses also came over.

Creak

In the room, Ling Jian ‘er opened her eyes. When she heard the sounds outside, she immediately stood up and walked out of the door.

“Your Majesty, the ninth Prince!”

When Ling Jian ‘er saw the monarch of the Bingxin Empire, Bing Jinghuan and the others, she immediately greeted them.

“Junior sister, Are You Alright?”

Bing jinghuan sized up Ling Jian ‘er and asked with a face full of surprise.

“I’m Fine!”

Ling Jian ‘er shook her head.

“Did the Heavenly Devil Not Harm You?” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

A prince could not help but ask.

“No, he killed that group of experts and left immediately!”

Ling Jian ‘er shook her head.

“It’s good that you’re alright. That Heavenly Devil did not kill you. It’s your good luck, Jian ‘er!”

The king of Bingxin slowly nodded his head and looked at her hesitantly. “The iceheart grass was taken away by the Heavenly Devil?”

“No!”

Ling Jian ‘er was hiding something. “After the Skyfiend killed a group of experts, he immediately left. I don’t know why he didn’t ask me for the Sword Heart Grass!”

She couldn’t possibly tell the bingxin King that the skyfiend had appeared to save her.

“This Skyfiend has a strange personality. It’s not impossible for him to ask you for the sword heart grass without asking Jian ‘er. It’s best not to provoke such a devil!”

Bingxin king said with a grave expression.

The appearance of the skyfiend and its attack after destroying the ancient devil city.

This time, it was even more shocking than destroying a million lives. With a single move, it directly killed 25 profound void tier 7 experts.

This was a total of 25.

At least 20 second-rate forces’ancestors had been killed.

Such demonic might was enough to suppress the entire region.

At that time, Skyfiend had even sent word to the experts from the three super and first-rate forces who had rushed over. Anyone who dared to provoke him would die!

One could imagine how unbridled the entire Skyfiend was.

“However, this Skyfiend came at the right time. If it wasn’t for the sudden appearance of the Skyfiend, junior sister Jian ‘Er’s sword heart grass would have been snatched away by that group of people. Her life might even be in danger!”

Bing Jing Huan said with a smile from the side.

“Jian ‘er, you have painstakingly obtained three sword heart grass. You can keep one and give the other two to father!”

The Ice Heart King said to Ling Jian ‘ER.

“En, Alright!”

Ling Jian ‘er hesitated for a moment before nodding her head. Then, she took out two sword heart grass from her interspatial ring and handed them over to the Ice Heart King!

“Alright, Alright. Jian ‘er, if you want any cultivation resources, just tell me directly!”

The bingxin King said happily. Two spiritual herbs of the eighth level of the profound void tier were also important cultivation resources for him.

Ling Jian ‘er nodded.

“Now, Jian ‘er, cultivate well. In ten days or so, the only sect will hold a competition that is all about you. At that time, you can participate in it and get to know some of the proud disciples of the only sect!”

King bingxin said with a smile on his face.

“The proud disciples of only my sect?”

Ling Jian ‘er slightly raised her eyebrows. She thought of the scene where the two proud disciples of only my sect, above and below the heavens, were violently beaten up in the mansion of Wu Qing city.

“That priest Wang is really secretive and very mysterious!”

She pursed her lips and suddenly said.

“Priest Wang?”

Ling Jian ‘ER’s words caused king bingxin to be slightly stunned, while Bing Jing Huan’s face turned slightly black.

“That priest Wang is very powerful, but they have provoked two heaven’s favorites of our sect. It Won’t be long before that fellow will be eliminated by our sect!”

Bing Jing Huan said with an unpleasant expression.

At that time, priest Wang had also slapped him in the face.

In particular, the other party wanted to pursue Ling Jian ‘er, which made him extremely angry.

“That young man is very mysterious!”

King Bing Xin frowned slightly. “However, if a young man doesn’t have any background, he still can’t be compared to the proud sons of Heaven of the only sect!”

“All of you learn from Jian ‘er and spar with each other. Father will take his leave First!”

King bingxin said a few simple words to Ling Jian ‘er before leaving to the princes and princesses.

The princes and princesses asked Ling Jian ‘er about the sky demon out of curiosity.

The group chatted for a total of an hour before leaving.

Ling Jian ‘er heaved a sigh of relief and walked into the room.

Wang Xian leaned on the roof and began to balance the light and darkness.

At night, a message was sent over.

Sect leader Ling had arrived with AO Jian and Ao Yao.

After taking a look at Ling Jian ‘ER in the room, Wang Xian’s figure moved and flew directly towards the entrance of the ruins of the divine kingdom.

“Dragon King!”

“Dragon King!”

When Wang Xian arrived, Ao Jian, Ao Yao, and the rest immediately greeted him respectfully.

“Reporting to Dragon King, this is the temporary residence we found beside the ruins of the Divine Kingdom!”

Two civil officials from the Dragon Palace walked over and reported to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian nodded and looked at sect leader Ling. “Sorry to trouble you, sect leader Ling!”

“No trouble, no trouble. Little brother Wang Xian, Jian ‘er, now?”

Sect leader Ling shook his head and asked immediately.

“Jian ‘ER is fine now. I’m confident that I can bring her back very soon!”

Wang Xian smiled at sect leader Ling.

“That’s good, that’s Good!”

Sect leader Ling nodded with a smile.

“Next, we will set our base here at the ruins of the divine kingdom. Send someone to investigate and see how we can get more resources!”

Wang Xian said to Ao Jian and Ao Yao as well as the two civil officials of the Dragon Palace.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Everyone nodded.

“Ao Yao, go and protect Jian ‘er. Secretly protect her safety. Report to me immediately if anything happens!”

Wang Xian said to Ao Yao.

With Ao Yao’s arrival, he didn’t have to follow Ling Jian ‘ER at all times. He just had to go and take a look every morning.

Next, he had to set up a plan to establish a foothold in the Dragon Palace and the Dragon and Phoenix Empire in the future!
