“Did it succeed?”

“It’s fine. These bloodlines are enough to cast a tracing spell. Their god countries should be placed in the same location. If we can find one, we might be able to find all of them.”

On a planet within the territory of the righteous God race, more than ten liches were chatting with smiles on their faces.

“Let’s go. We have to act as soon as possible. Although we ordered them not to say anything, there are too many people. It’s impossible for us not to leak the news. We have to act as soon as possible.”

More than ten figures immediately came to a place in the void. They placed the blood of the righteous God race members in the void and used witchcraft to guide them to the Cosmos God Kingdom of the Righteous God race experts.

At the same time, on the planet where they left.

There were more than five billion righteous God race members on the planet. There were too many people on this planet, so someone would leak some information.

Moreover, the experts of the Lich race didn’t dare to silence them.

Therefore, a day later, the situation on this planet was exposed.

At the beginning, it didn’t attract much attention, but as time passed, more and more people paid attention to it.

Most importantly, because the disciples of the righteous God race were exposed, not only did people buy their bloodlines, but some people also inquired about the situation.

Paper could not cover fire. At first, it was fine, but as more and more people came, it attracted more and more attention.

“It seems that many experts have entered the territory of the Righteous God race. Every expert is extremely terrifying. They seem to be looking for the Cosmos God Kingdom of the righteous god race’s experts.”

“With the orders of the Dragon Palace, who would dare to covet the spoils of war belonging to the Dragon Palace? Are they courting death? Are they making an enemy out of the Dragon Palace?”

“The forces and experts surrounding Lu Xing Kong might not dare to do so, but it is said that on a planet, there is a strange expert who bought a large number of bloodlines. He is suspected to be using witchcraft to search for the Cosmos God Country.”

“Not the experts surrounding Lu Xing Kong?”? “Then there are only the experts from the heaven opening primal continent. The treasures of the ancient sea race might not be able to attract the experts from the heaven opening primal continent, but the treasures of the righteous God race have a fatal attraction!”

“They are definitely the experts from the heaven-splitting chaotic continent. However, the strength of the dragon palace is not weaker than some of the forces in the heaven-splitting chaotic continent. Are they trying to offend the Dragon Palace?”

As time passed, more and more people started to talk. The experts from the heaven-splitting chaotic continent had entered the territory of the Righteous God race, which had attracted a lot of attention.

“Dragon King, there is bad news!”

“It seems that many experts from the heaven-splitting primordial land have entered the territory of the Righteous God race. They seem to be searching for the treasures of the Righteous God Race!”

At the same time, the Dragon Palace also received the news two days after the incident. Prime Minister Gui entered the Dragon King’s palace and reported with a grim expression.

“Huh?”

When Wang Xian received the news, he frowned slightly. A cold expression appeared on his face as he stood up immediately.

He asked with a sullen face.

The Righteous God race was exterminated by their Dragon Palace. This was the spoils of war that belonged to the Dragon Palace.

Anyone who wanted to snatch the food from the dragon’s mouth would have to pay a price.

“It has been confirmed that more than a dozen experts who know witchcraft came to a planet belonging to the righteous God race and bought a large number of bloodlines. They should be trying to use witchcraft to search for the universe God nation. It has already been two days.”

Prime Minister Gui said in a deep voice. His expression did not look good either.

This time, it was the mistake of the Dragon Palace. They did not expect that the experts and powers from the Heaven Opening Primal Continent would covet the treasures of the Righteous God race.

However, with their strength, they were qualified to snatch the dragon’s mouth for food.

“You are courting death!”

Killing intent appeared in Wang Xian’s eyes. “Call an lie and the heaven formation over immediately!”

“It’s the Dragon King, Dragon King. The Heaven Array is undergoing an upgrade in the dragon transformation pool. Do you want me to interrupt him?”

Prime Minister Gui asked. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Interrupt him directly and tell the Heaven Array to come over immediately.”

Chu Xian nodded.

“Yes!”

Prime Minister Gui retreated. Soon, an lie and the Heaven Array arrived at the Dragon Palace.

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

The two of them immediately bowed respectfully.

“An lie, go to the territory of the Righteous God race and bring us there as fast as you can!”

Wang Xian immediately instructed an lie.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

An lie immediately replied.

“Dragon King, which faction wants to snatch the spoils of war from our Dragon Palace?”

Tian Zhen’s face darkened. He had been absorbing the spiritual energy in the dragon transformation pool for the past few days in order to upgrade his combat strength to a level seven universe knight. He only knew a little about the current situation.

“I don’t know for the time being. I would like to see who dares to snatch the spoils of war from our Dragon Palace and the forces from the heaven splitting chaotic land? Hehe!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with coldness as he sat on the Dragon Throne and waited quietly.

An Lie’s speed was very fast. Now that he had the combat strength of a level five universe knight, the distance of his teleportation had improved tremendously.

If he relied on an lie to travel, he would be able to reach the territory of the Righteous God race in twenty minutes.

Initially, Wang Xian didn’t rush over in this way because he was too careless.

He thought that no one would dare to touch the treasures of the Righteous God race.

Secondly, it was also because the divine kingdom of the righteous God race’s experts was very secretive.

If the forces and experts surrounding Lu Xing Kong were to search for this place, they might not be able to find it for decades or even centuries.

However, he had forgotten about the experts and forces in the heaven-splitting primordial land.

“If that treasure is really snatched away, I will make you pay no matter which force it is. HMPH!”

Wang Xian felt a chill in his heart.

Twenty minutes passed quickly and an Lie’s figure appeared in the Dragon Palace.

“Dragon King!”

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian’s heaven formation and the rest arrived in front of an lie. A force enveloped them, causing them to instantly arrive at the starry sky of the Righteous God race.

“If an lie can teleport the entire Dragon Palace, that would be amazing.”

Looking at the unfamiliar phantom around him, he thought to himself.

“Let’s go to the place where the righteous God race hides their divine kingdoms.”

The incipient sacred wings appeared behind Wang Xian. He enveloped the heaven formation and brought him flying in a certain direction.

He had absorbed the memories of the two ancestors of the righteous God race and knew where the divine kingdoms were located.

He didn’t need an lie here because he didn’t know where he was.

This time, he had brought the Heaven Array to search through the array formation. He wanted to see which faction dared to snatch their treasures.

“Hahaha, hahaha, I really didn’t expect that the treasures of the entire righteous God race would be hidden here. All the divine kingdoms are here.”

At the same time, in a desolate starry sky, there were all sorts of abandoned items and the air was filled with poison.

This was an ancient battlefield, an ancient battlefield where the technological races once fought.

The spiritual energy here was thin, and the activity here was at the level of some divine kings and emperors.

And in a remote place in this ancient battlefield, more than ten liches were floating in the sky, looking forward with excited faces.
