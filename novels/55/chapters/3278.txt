3279 3278 breakthrough to create the Tai Chi Dragon Disc!

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

In the Dragon Palace in the starry sky of xingjiang, all the members of the Dragon Palace were undergoing their training.

In the Dragon King’s Hall, Wang Xian was also devouring a large number of elixirs and godly herbs.

One by one, the elixirs entered his stomach and were rapidly converted into Dragon Qi.

Time passed little by little.

The Dragon Qi in Wang Xian’s body was also increasing rapidly.

His dragon body was also growing slowly.

That huge dragon body was gradually increasing to about 70,000 meters.

Every single dragon scale was emitting a dazzling light and a huge amount of dragon might.

“Ding! Congratulations to host for increasing your level and breaking through to the second level of a universe Knight.”

“Ding! Congratulations to host for increasing your level to the second level of a Universe Knight and comprehending the law aspect: Eight Dragon Clones.”

When Wang Xian’s aura reached a critical point, a terrifying dragon aura swept across the surroundings.

The system’s voice could be heard at any time.

He had broken through!

Looking at the attributes in his mind, he smiled.

Universe Knight Level 2, after this upgrade, he would have the Combat Power of a universe Knight Level 8.

“There are still quite a number of divine herbs and elixirs. The harvest this time is really huge!”

Wang Xian looked at the remaining resources in front of him and his eyes sparkled.

After the breakthrough, there were still half of the divine herbs and elixirs.

One could imagine how huge the harvest this time was. However, the remaining resources were not enough for him to upgrade.

“Next, I have to upgrade the five elements millstone first.”

He moved his palm, and the five elements millstone appeared in his hand. One after another, the acquired true treasures floated above the five elements millstone.

The five elements millstone revolved and began to absorb the acquired true treasures quickly.

Thirteen acquired true treasures with five elements attributes. This time, the five elements millstone should be able to level up by one or two levels.

After the five elements millstone swallowed them on its own, he took the ancient demon pool, the angel wings, and the light attribute Holy Lotus.

This was the holy prose clan’s Supreme Treasure, a light attribute treasure.

Other than these, there were two devil dragon beads, a skull, and a darkness attribute armor.

“Whoosh! Whoosh!”

At this moment, two figures flew over quickly.

These were his light and darkness attribute clones.

Back on Earth, because of the Dragon Bloodline, Dragon Blood, and the great changes in the world, he had formed nine clones.

They were divided into nine attributes.

The five clones were located on the five elements grinding mill. The two clones were located within the incipient saint wings. There were also the last two clones.

“I’ll give it a try. I hope I can succeed. If I can succeed, I’ll have another powerful technique.”

He muttered to himself. The two clones immediately transformed into light and dark divine dragons. They coiled together and formed a tai chi shape.

Whoosh! Whoosh

Wang Xian waved his arm and tossed the Holy Light Lotus and a demonic dragon bead over.

He took a look. The two acquired Supreme Treasures landed on the two clones without any reaction. The clones were also unable to refine the powerful acquired supreme treasures.

Wang Xian was not too surprised by this scene.

“Roar! Roar!”

He let out a low roar and slowly opened his mouth. A beating heart slowly flew out.

The heart of Light and darkness.

It was the heart of the light and Darkness Dragon King, who used to be the best among the divine dragons.

This heart was also the reason why Wang Xian could control the light and darkness attributes.

The Light and darkness on the heart fused perfectly.

Wang Xian’s heart moved and the heart of light and darkness started to revolve slowly.

He moved his palm and threw the Holy Light Lotus and the Demonic Dragon Pearl onto the heart of Light and darkness.

The heart of Light and darkness was flowing while the light and darkness were rotating non-stop.

“Success or failure depends on this one move!”

Wang Xian’s gaze focused as he stared at the two doppelgangers who were shooting out the powers of light and darkness.

They formed a yin-yang tai chi pattern.

Buzz

Above the heart of Light and darkness, the acquired Supreme Treasure that was suddenly added in was crushed due to the circulation of the terrifying powers of light and darkness.

Crack! Crack! Crack

The sound of crumbling could be heard. The two huge acquired supreme treasures were actually slowly collapsing and were slowly converted into the origin of Light and darkness.

Roar! Roar

The two doppelgangers immediately surrounded the heart of light and darkness. The energy of Light and darkness converted from the acquired Supreme Treasure surged into the doppelgangers’bodies.

This made the aura of the two doppelgangers become stronger and stronger.

When Wang Xian saw this scene, a look of surprise and joy appeared in his eyes. He had succeeded.

With the help of the energy of the heart of Light and darkness, he destroyed the acquired supreme treasure and allowed the powers of the acquired Supreme Treasure to surge into the body of the light and darkness doppelgangers.

“This heart of Light and darkness is at least at the level of an innate supreme treasure.”

Wang Xian mumbled as excitement appeared in his eyes.

The two acquired Supreme Treasures were slowly destroyed and absorbed by the doppelgangers. Wang Xian continued to place the other acquired Supreme Treasures of darkness attribute on top of them.

The energy of the two clones was getting stronger and stronger. Due to the energy of the acquired Supreme Treasures, their bodies were slowly condensing into the shape of a yin-yang tai chi.

The two clones also took the initiative to leave their bodies and formed an existence that was like a weapon spirit. They were in charge of the power of the Tai Chi Dragon Disc.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Two days later, when Wang Xian had destroyed all five acquired Supreme Treasures, a tai chi dragon disc that was 10,000 meters in size was suspended in the sky above the Dragon King Hall.

The Light and Darkness Dragons stood at the position of the Yin-yang Eye of the Tai Chi Dragon Disc and let out a roar.

“Universe knight level five or so. The power of the Tai Chi Dragon disc is around level five universe knight level. However, the Tai Chi Dragon Disc’s main defense is even more terrifying in terms of defense.”

Wang Xian felt the power of the Tai Chi Dragon disc and his eyes sparkled. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Continue!”

“Next, I don’t need the help of the heart of Light and darkness. With the power of the Tai Chi Dragon Disc and the power of the light and Darkness Avatar, I can use the tai chi dragon disc to destroy the treasures of the light and darkness attributes and absorb them.”

He mumbled and placed his gaze on the wings of the angel.

The wings of the Angel of light, which was on the level of the ruler of the universe, was comparable to a weak innate spiritual treasure.

By absorbing it, the Tai Chi Dragon Disc would receive a huge improvement.

Buzz

Wang Xian waved his arm and placed the wings of the Angel on the Tai Chi Dragon Disc. The Tai Chi Dragon disc rotated and began to absorb energy.

Hence, a shocking scene appeared in the Dragon King’s palace.

One was the five elements grinding machine and the other was the Tai Chi Dragon Disc. They were absorbing powerful treasures one by one and were evolving rapidly.
