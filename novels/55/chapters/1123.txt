Looking at the thousands of corpses on the battlefield, everyone sucked in a breath of cold air.

“What terrifying archery skills, an arrow actually pierced through so many people!”

“This is simply too terrifying, is this our Queen’s Trump Card? This is too powerful!”

“What Kind of demonic beast race is that, what formidable strength, what terrifying archery skills!”

In Dragon and Phoenix city, everyone looked at the cyan-colored figures flying towards them in shock.

Their slender bodies and arms, as well as their cyan-colored skin, gave off a different kind of coldness.

Mu Zesen’s gaze was like a torch. His cyan-colored pupils scanned the surroundings. His gaze landed on Wang Xian and flew towards him.

A group of more than 500 strong people from the Wind Eye clan was emitting a cyan glow. They arrived in front of the East Gate of Dragon and Phoenix city in an instant.

Compared to six to seven days ago, the current wind eye clan had undergone a huge change.

After cultivating the wind attribute divine dragon transformation, their bloodline had undergone a huge transformation. Even though they had only stayed in the Dragon Palace for six to seven days.

However, with the spiritual energy in the Dragon Cave, one day of cultivation was equivalent to sixteen days outside. Six to seven days of cultivation was equivalent to more than three months of continuous cultivation without sleep!

The transformed Wind Eye clan was even more powerful.

This was also the first time Wang Xian saw the archery skills of the Wind Eye clan. Back then, Mou Zesen only shot one arrow and landed on Xiao Lan.

As a kun, the most powerful thing was its defense. At that time, Xiao Lan was not injured at all.

After that, she became a member of the Dragon Palace under the threat of Prime Minister Gui.

Now, the Wind Arrow clan of the Dragon Palace.

The weakest among them was at level six of the extraordinary realm. Now that they had undergone a metamorphosis, their strength had been raised to a whole new level.

There were more than 300 members of the Wind Eye clan. The weakest among them could even fight against a level seven of the extraordinary realm.

The Wind Eye clan, which was already quite strong, was now even more terrifying.

Today, they could be considered to have completely displayed the strength of the Wind Eye clan.

“King!”

Mou Zesen flew to the front of Wang Xian and greeted him respectfully.

In front of the others, Wang Xian did not reveal his identity as the Dragon King to avoid causing unnecessary trouble.

“King!”

The members of the wind-eye clan behind him also greeted Wang Xian respectfully.

“Assist them!”

Wang Xian did not say much and ordered Mou Zesen directly.

“Yes!”

Mou Zesen nodded and flew into the sky.

A group of people from the Wind Eye clan lined up in a row. Mou Zesen, who was standing at the front, had no emotion in his eyes.

“Boom!”

“Damn, it’s Lord Wang’s subordinate!”

“Haha, Lord Wang has called people over. Oh My God, that cool creature in the center seems to be a void interpretation level powerhouse.”

“It’s too powerful. Their archery skills are so strong. Now that Lord Wang has called people over to help, we are not afraid of them at all!”

“This... What is Lord Wang’s identity? Even void interpretation experts call him King!”

The people of dragon-phoenix City who were not far away heard the words of Mou Zesen and the others and looked at them in shock.

Looking at the same line of the Wind Eye clan, they were excited.

That cloud piercing arrow just now killed thousands of people. It was simply too cool!

“This...”

Feng Luan’s eyes flickered. Her eyes were also filled with shock.

He was very clear about the strength of the Dragon Palace. When he left, there was not a single person at the first level of the extraordinary realm.

However, now, there was actually a subordinate at the insightful void realm leading a group of powerful subordinates.

She knew that the increase in Wang Xian’s strength was very terrifying. However, this speed... Wasn’t it too fast?

He stared at Wang Xian in disbelief.

What greeted him was Wang Xian raising his head slightly proudly, which made her feel amused.

“Where did this demonic beast come from? How could it be so strong?”

“The one standing at the front is an expert at the insightful void tier. I can’t tell his actual strength!”

Meanwhile, Xing Guang and the other five people in the sky saw the sudden appearance of the Wind Eye clan and their faces immediately darkened.

Especially when they saw a profound void tier powerhouse appear out of nowhere, their expressions became somewhat solemn.

“They actually have the help of the Demon Beast Clan!”

Lei Feihu’s face was also filled with shock, and his gaze flickered as he stared at Mu Zesen.

Up until now, the Queen of the Dragon-phoenix kingdom had yet to appear. Instead, another profound void tier powerhouse had appeared, which made their hearts even more vigilant.

“This demon beast race is somewhat familiar!”

The Heavenly Moon Sect’s heavenly moon star flower looked at the wind-eyed race with a contemplative expression.

However, while the group of profound void tier experts were conversing, the battle below continued.

“Archery, what kind of Demon Beast is this? It actually wants to compete with us in archery?”

At the Heavenly Moon soul-chaser’s position, a group of five hundred people stared at the members of the wind-eyed race in the sky from afar. Their faces revealed an icy expression!

“No matter what kind of demonic beasts they are, since they want to compete with us in archery skills, let’s show these beasts our strength, Hehe!”

A middle-aged man from Skymoon Soul Chaser laughed with confidence. He moved his arm and took out a special arrow!

“Shoot them all down!”

Another old man shouted and instantly pulled the bowstring to its maximum.

“Tornado Arrow!”

In the Wind Eye clan, an old man from the Wind Eye clan ordered in a deep voice.

“Buzz!”

In an instant, all the members of the Wind Eye clan drew the bows in their hands. Their arms lit up with a green light.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

In an instant, the attack of the Wind Eye clan was launched while the members of the Heavenly Moon Chasing Soul clan were preparing to attack.

A Green Arrow was spinning rapidly at the tip of the arrow, as if it was about to tear through the air and attack Skymoon Soul Chaser’s five hundred men.

“Damn, what speed!”

Skymoon Soul Chaser’s members’expressions changed slightly. If the opponent’s attack was launched, they had to dodge or shoot down the arrow.

No matter which one it was, it would cause them to lose the initiative.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

They directly released the arrows in their hands and shot at the tornado arrows.

“Boom!”

The arrows collided one after another, causing the arrows of both sides to lose their direction. Meanwhile, the arrows of over a hundred Skymoon Soul Chaser experts who were not attacked continued to attack the Wind Eye clan.

“Buzz!”

Over a hundred members of the Wind Eye clan waved their arms, drew their bows and arrows, and shot them out casually.

After the arrows were shot out, they turned into shields under everyone’s astonished gazes.

When Heavenly Moon Chasing Soul’s arrows landed on the shields, they instantly lost most of their power.

“What? The Arrows are being released to freely transform. What kind of archery technique is this?”

When they saw that the arrows shot out by the Wind Eye clan actually turned into shields, heavenly moon chasing soul and the others’expressions changed slightly, and they revealed shocked expressions.

“This... This seems to be the wind eye illusion arrow. Wherever the arrow reaches, there will be a myriad of changes. Killing comes first. That’s right, it’s the wind eye illusion Arrow!”

Suddenly, the Heavenly Moon Sect’s vice sect master, Tian Yue Xing Hua, who was standing in the void, saw this scene and thought of a legendary demonic beast race. His face revealed a shocked expression.
