Chapter 1629: The five elements above 1629’s head ground his feet on the yin and yang poles

“What kind of enemy has our dragon-phoenix Empire Provoked?”

In the north of the dragon-phoenix Imperial City, tens of millions of people were standing at the back.

Hundreds of thousands of soldiers of the imperial city were staring at the void in front of them.

There was no enemy in the void, but that terrifying aura and killing intent had already charged at them from dozens of kilometers away.

This caused everyone in the dragon and Phoenix Empire to reveal extremely grave and shocked expressions.

Even Feng Luan, Lan Qingyue, and the others watched with grave expressions.

“Wu Wu!”

At this moment, a whistling sound was heard. Little Blue’s incomparably huge body slowly flew over.

On Little Blue’s body stood many disciples of the Dragon Palace.

The Heavenly Eye Arrow Division, the Starwood Dragon Seed, the Thunder Division, the Dragon Guard...

The disciples of the Dragon Palace stared at the sky in the north with sharp eyes.

“The experts of the Dragon Palace are here too.”

“With the experts of the Dragon Palace here, we have nothing to worry about!”

“Not necessarily. Even the experts of the Dragon Palace are here. The enemy must be very powerful!”

Everyone in the imperial city was discussing in shock when they saw the giant beast and the members of the Dragon Palace.

Everyone in the dragon-phoenix Empire knew that the Dragon Palace was much more powerful than the entire dragon-phoenix Empire.

They felt a chill in their hearts as they let out a sigh of relief.

The enemy that could make the experts of the Dragon Palace come here was definitely not weak.

“Roar!”

“Hahaha, dragon-phoenix Empire, run? Do you think you can escape? Today, even if you cross the region, I will destroy you completely!”

At this moment, the roars of fierce beasts and demonic beasts came from the north.

Then, a domineering voice came and figures appeared faintly.

“What’s That?”

Upon hearing these voices, the expressions of everyone in the dragon and Phoenix Imperial City changed drastically as they stared fixedly at the north.

Figures slowly appeared. First, six old men who were riding on terrifying demonic beasts appeared in everyone’s line of sight.

Following closely behind them were a group of experts who were exuding a terrifying aura and had arrogant expressions on their faces.

From the moment they entered the flowing sea region and passed by a few cities, all the experts in the vast region discovered that the flowing sea region was such trash.

In the entire city, they could easily pull out a void interpretation expert and a few transcendents to destroy them.

They were on completely different levels.

All of them were filled with strong confidence towards this cross-region battle.

“All disciples of the vast region, Listen Up!”

An elder of the Wuji Empire rode on the shadow lion and lightly shouted!

“Yes!”

The 120,000 experts of the vast region responded loudly.

“Kill... The Enemy!”

The supreme headmaster roared, his face filled with a ferocious killing intent.

“Kill!”

An earth-shaking roar came from the mouth of the 120,000 experts of the vast region.

The 120,000 people quickly flew towards the dragon-phoenix imperial city. The powerful aura that each of them carried directly swarmed forward.

Over 10,000 insightful void martial experts, the lowest rank 9 extraordinary experts, charged over with a terrifying killing intent.

The entire sky underwent a terrifying transformation, and the clouds in the sky directly scattered.

An invisible and suffocating aura condensed in front of them.

An even more powerful aura directly charged over like a fierce wind and tsunami.

“Get Ready!”

All the generals of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire saw the charging aura and their faces changed drastically as they immediately shouted loudly.

“Yes!”

Hundreds of thousands of soldiers stared at the front and shouted loudly.

“Oh no!”

Feng Luan’s expression slightly changed when she saw the charging aura.

“Buzz!”

A staff appeared in her hand instantly. She spread out her arm and blocked the terrifying aura in front of her.

“Boom!”

The two auras collided, and the terrifying aura was directly blocked by half by Feng Luan.

However, this was after all the aura of the strongest army in the vast area. The remaining aura directly swept towards the back.

“Not good, what kind of power is this?”

“Oh my God, what a terrifying pressure!”

The hundreds of thousands of soldiers felt the aura coming towards them. It was as if death was pressing down on their necks.

“Ahhhh!”

All the soldiers below transcendent level 9 all retreated backwards, their legs trembling as they fell to the ground.

“What?”

“This... this... just the impact of the aura, how can it be so terrifying?”

“Who are these people, how can they be so strong! ?”

The tens of millions of people in the imperial city behind watched this scene in shock.

Just the impact of the aura, more than half of the dragon and Phoenix Empire’s most elite army actually collapsed to the ground.

How could they fight?

This was just the impact of the Aura!

Everyone’s faces were filled with terror.

“Only my sect, southern royal family, and Wuji Empire, the three major forces of the vast region have all arrived!”

When those generals saw this scene, their faces all became unsightly.

They stared at the 120,000 troops in front of them with some fear in their hearts.

When Feng Luan saw this scene, her face also became gloomy.

In terms of pure strength, if the Dragon Palace wasn’t present, the current Dragon and Phoenix Empire wouldn’t even be a match for the only sect.

Even if they had the Dragon Palace, they wouldn’t be a match for the Wuji Empire.

“Haha, the trash in the Liuhai area. We can kill more than half of them with just one charge!”

“The trash area is the trash area. They dare to start a war in our vast area. Today, we will destroy them!”

“After being arrogant in our vast area, they still want to escape?” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The 120,000 strong army flew five kilometers ahead. They were flying in the sky, and when they saw that the army had fallen with a single attack from them, their faces revealed an arrogant expression.

The mocking words were said without restraint, and everyone’s faces revealed disdainful expressions.

“Hehe!”

The six ninth level profound void tier experts also laughed coldly.

“Everyone from the dragon and Phoenix Empire, kneel down and bow your heads. We will give you all a complete corpse!”

An ancestor from the Wuji Empire held a dark magic staff in his hand as he spoke from above.

“Wuji Empire, you bunch of hypocrites, do you really think that we are afraid of You! ?”

Lan qingyue stared at them as she spoke with an icy expression.

“Barbarian goddess, do you really think that our vast region is afraid of Your Little Liuhai Empire?”

A patriarch of Wuji Empire said indifferently.

“Dragon-phoenix Empire, you entered our vast region to stir up trouble and harm our disciples!”

“Our vast region, the three super forces, led all the experts in the vast region to come and kill you!”

“Today will be the day you die!”

Wuji King said to the Dragon and Phoenix Empire with a righteous expression.

“Blood must be repaid in blood. Dragon and Phoenix Empire, go and reunite with the Sky Devil!”

The Supreme Patriarch raised his hand with a grim expression.

Everyone from the southern royal family also raised their weapons with hatred.
