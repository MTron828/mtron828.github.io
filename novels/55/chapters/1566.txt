Chapter 1567: 1567 saint of Light 6

“Experts from Wuji Empire, your invitation is really something new!”

Wang Xian’s voice covered the front of Wuji Empire’s palace.

When Wuji Empire and all the priests heard this voice, everyone was stunned.

The voice was so arrogant!

This short sentence carried a hint of mockery.

This priest Wang actually dared to mock the Wuji Empire.

Everyone looked towards the sky at the same time.

It was a plain figure. He didn’t have a dazzling brilliance nor did he have a powerful aura.

He was dressed in pure white and was walking towards them slowly.

There wasn’t a hint of fear, respect, and respect in his eyes.

“He Yuan, this brother of yours is really...” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The old man standing beside he yuan looked at Wang Xian’s figure and whispered to he yuan in a speechless manner.

His eyes sparkled and were filled with shock.

This young man... No, this sky demon really didn’t put anyone in his eyes!

He Yuan looked at Wang Xian with a pained expression.

He already had a slight understanding of this brother of his.

He was a pushover. When he was tough, he didn’t care whether he was from the solipsistic sect or the Wuji Empire.

This was especially the case when the sky demon killed 25 powerhouses at the seventh level of the Seethrough realm not long ago. With such terrifying combat strength, this brother of his had already reached the eighth level of the Seethrough realm.

It was shocking!

When the entire he clan heard this news, everyone was shocked beyond words.

It was the eighth level of the Seethrough void tier. It was comparable to the top-notch combat strength of the He clan!

Even the ancestor of the He clan felt a little dazed!

Ling Jian ‘er saw that Wang Xian rushed over just because a powerhouse from the Wuji Empire shouted his name. His face was filled with a strange expression.

A special emotion was born in her heart.

This kind of emotion was something she had never experienced before.

“Impudent! Wuji Empire had ordered all the radiant priests to come over just now. Why didn’t you come? Do You Know Your Crime?”

Tian Qingguang’s eyes were filled with anger when he saw Wang Xian. He shouted with a cold face.

“Arrogant and arrogant! Why aren’t you here to apologize?”

The head of the Divine Light Medical Center also looked at Wang Xian and shouted in a deep voice.

The group of experts from the Wuji Empire also raised their eyebrows and stared at Wang Xian.

A faint murderous aura emanated from the few experts!

In the vast region, no one dared to ignore the Wuji Empire, not even the other two superpowers!

Wang Xian glanced at the two clowns who spoke.

He looked at he yuan and nodded at him faintly. Finally, his gaze landed on Ling Jian ‘er and he smiled at her.

“Hey, Arrogant Fellow. I told you to come over and take a look at my brother’s injuries. Don’t be too arrogant!”

Wu Qingyan’s face turned a little dark when she saw Wang Xian’s attitude. She shouted directly.

“Has the crown prince of Wuqing City been possessed by the Soul of Darkness?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and swept his gaze across the experts of Wuji Empire. His gaze landed on the bald elder with black eyes in the middle.

His eyes revealed a solemn look. With his current strength, although he had made a breakthrough, he was still far from being able to contend against such an existence.

At most, he would be able to survive in the hands of this elder.

Of course, being able to survive was already a very good thing. This was also the reason why Wang Xian dared to mock the Wuji Empire.

Because he wasn’t afraid!

“Senior, let me take a look at the injuries of the Crown Prince of Wuqing City!”

Not being afraid didn’t mean that he could provoke the Wuji Empire.

Wang Xian cupped his hands and said to Patriarch of dark eye.

“Young man, if you have the strength, you have the capital. However, you have to keep a low profile sometimes!”

Patriarch of dark eye reminded Wang Xian indifferently.

“I understand!”

Wang Xian cupped his hands and nodded. “I will do my best!”

“Alright. If You Can Cure Qing city, we will try our best to satisfy you!”

Patriarch of dark eye said to Wang Xian calmly.

When Wang Xian heard his words, a glint flashed across his eyes. His heart skipped a beat.

“Thank you, senior. Let me take a look at the situation of the Crown Prince of Wu Qing City First!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and walked towards Wu Qing city immediately.

“Young man, you are indeed arrogant. However, you must have a certain attitude when it comes to your strength. You must understand the importance of respect and inferiority!”

As Wang Xian approached, Patriarch of Dawn Light, who was standing beside the Crown Prince of Wuqing City, shot a glance at Wang Xian and warned him in a lecturing manner.

“This old man is right. Strength is not related to age!”

Wang Xian looked at Patriarch of dawn light indifferently and said with a smile.

“HMPH!”

When forefather Chenguang heard Wang Xian’s sarcastic words, his eyes revealed a hint of coldness. “I was the one who opened up the path of the radiant priest. Junior, you should know how to be grateful!”

“You don’t know respect and inferiority, and you don’t know how to be grateful!”

Tian qingguang spat out coldly from the side.

“You don’t have the right to speak in front of me!”

Wang Xian glanced at Tian Qingguang and didn’t take him seriously at all.

Upon hearing his words, Tian Qingguang almost exploded in anger. His eyes were filled with fury.

“Haha, I’m the daughter of light and the son of light. I don’t know what qualifications you have to call them trash. Today, after I treat the crown prince of Wuqing City, I need you to give me an explanation. Otherwise...”

Forefather Chenguang stared at Wang Xian and narrowed his eyes slightly.

“Let’s wait and see!”

When Wang Xian heard his words, the corners of his mouth curled up slightly. His pair of eyes looked at the Floating Wuqing city in the void.

“You have the same cultivation level as us. I don’t know how you have the courage to be so arrogant!”

“I called you over just for a glimmer of hope. Do you really think that you can be compared to our patriarch?”

“Hehe, what a sad, laughable, and lamentable story!”

When the radiant priests behind forefather Chenguang heard his words, they stared at him coldly.

Behind him, the radiant priests also stared at Wang Xian coldly and mocked him in a low voice.

Even Wu Qingyan looked at Wang Xian with displeasure.

Did he really think that he had to go through so much trouble to call you over just to rely on you to heal him?

This was merely because the one who was injured was his brother. He would not let go of any opportunity to heal him.

“It’s a little troublesome to be invaded by 17 Darkness Souls!”

Forefather Chenguang swept a cold glance at Wang Xian before turning his gaze to Wu Qing Cheng. His expression gradually turned solemn.

He moved his arm and a resplendent staff appeared in his hand. On the head of the staff was the image of a winged figure that resembled an angel.

The angels trembled slightly as the 17 little angels slowly descended into Wu Qing Cheng’s body.

“Seventeen Darkness Souls. Patriarch’s strength has increased by another step. He can definitely expel them easily!”

“These are the angels of light. Each angel contains boundless light and can expel all darkness!”

Everyone in the surroundings and even at the back looked astonished when they saw the attack of the Morning Light Patriarch.

Seventeen angels of light. Each angel of light contained energy no lower than the Darkness Souls!

Seventeen angels of light could expel seventeen souls of darkness from the body of the Crown Prince of Wuqing City.
