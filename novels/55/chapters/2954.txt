Chapter 2955: King 5 of the 2955 bright starry skies

“The Dragon King is leading experts into the chimei territory? My goodness, now that the machine royal territory has been destroyed by the Dragon Palace, entering the chimei territory will definitely allow us to sweep through the chimei territory. The two great threats of our glazed domain can be eliminated!”

“The Dragon Palace’s strength is too heaven-defying. They rose up in the imperial star domain’s Dragon Palace and destroyed the imperial court. After that, they swept through the Heaven Magus region and swept through all corners of the world. Now, they are helping our glazed domain regain its territory. After destroying the machine royal territory, it is very likely that they will destroy the chimei territory. This is completely sweeping through the entire bright starry skies!”

When the godly monarchs heard the governor’s words, their faces were filled with shock.

In the past few years, the Dragon Palace had risen up and swept across the entire starry sky.

!!

The Dragon Palace had used its powerful strength to create a throne in the starry sky.

An invincible throne.

With such strength, who wouldn’t be convinced?

“The four great devil dens that invaded our glazed domain have all been destroyed. There shouldn’t be any powerful devil dens in our glazed domain. If there are a few experts from the Dragon Palace following us, we can go back now!”

The governor stood there and said with sparkling eyes.

“It should be safe now. No matter how abnormal the chimei domain is, it’s impossible for there to be any powerful Yaoxie.”

The god Emperor beside him said.

“Inform the Dragon Palace to help us destroy all Yaoxie and let us return home. In the future, the glazed domain will respect the dragon palace and the Dragon Palace will be the king.”

“The members of the Dragon Palace will be the benefactors of our Veluriyam Domain.”

The domain Lord immediately said to the godly monarchs.

“It’s the domain Lord!”

The godly monarchs replied and immediately began to organize all the citizens of the Veluriyam Domain to return.

“The Dragon Palace has solved a huge crisis for the VELURIYAM domain. Doesn’t that mean that it has solved a huge crisis for our sacred domain? Announce that today, the sacred domain will be ruled by the Dragon Palace and the Dragon Palace will be the King!”

“In the future, the Dragon King will be the ruler of everyone in the starry sky!”

The Holy Lord stood at the side and gave an order with a smile on his face.

The Dragon Palace was too powerful now!

It was so powerful that if the Dragon Palace wanted to destroy them, they could easily send an expert from the Dragon Palace.

Why wouldn’t they submit to such a force?

“Fortunately, Xiao Yan has a good relationship with the Dragon Palace. In the future, the Dragon Palace will provide a lot of resources to the Dragon Palace every year, and the Dragon Palace will also protect the Holy Region.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Moreover, the Dragon Palace doesn’t care about the affairs of the domain. This doesn’t have any negative effects on the saint realm.”

The Saint Lord rejoiced in his heart.

“The Dragon King has already led the experts of the Dragon Palace to help us destroy the four great devil dens of the glazed area. We can now return. This is great, this is great!”

“Our Domain Lord and the godly monarchs have personally issued an order. In order to thank the Dragon King and the Dragon Palace for their help, our glazed area will respect the Dragon Palace and make the Dragon King Our King!”

“It’s only right for the Dragon Palace to respect the Dragon King as their king. The Dragon King has saved all of us, but he has allowed us to return to the VELURIYAM domain. They are our benefactors who have saved our lives.”

The news quickly spread to everyone in the Veluriyam Domain.

When they received the news, they immediately became excited.

Return to their homes!

As for the Dragon Palace to respect and the Dragon King to be their king, this was something that they felt was only right.

The Dragon Palace was powerful, and they had saved all their lives. They helped them take back their homes, and the Dragon King was their king.

Who Wasn’t convinced?

It was the same for the Holy Region.

The Dragon Palace suppressed everything with its powerful strength.

“Let’s go, let’s return to the glazed area!”

“The governor said that we should celebrate when we return to the glazed area and invite the Dragon King over. Thank you, Dragon King!”

“Although the glazed area suffered heavy losses this time, the threat of the machine royal territory and the Chimei territory has been dealt with by the Dragon Palace. We will recover soon!”

“Roar! The Dragon Palace is invincible! The Dragon King is invincible!”

On the stars in the sky, all the citizens of the glazed area who had survived the disaster and returned to their homes looked excited.

They cheered and celebrated.

In the end, the words ‘Invincible Dragon Palace’and ‘Invincible Dragon King’resounded throughout the void.

The people of the glazed domain began their journey home. At the border of the chimei domain, two enormous demon caves appeared at the edge of the chimei domain.

The demon caves stopped. It was not an order from Wang Xian, but an accident.

“Dragon King, an lie is delirious. He has been completely assimilated!”

The Heaven Array brought an lie, who had all sorts of blood-red lines all over his body, over. His expression changed as he spoke.

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly when he saw an lie’s expression.

“An lie is someone who has leaped over the dragon gate. How could he have been assimilated? Now, he doesn’t even have a consciousness?”

He frowned and was filled with astonishment.

“Dragon King, I realized that the altar isn’t simple. It should be a special treasure. This altar has the characteristic of void teleportation. It’s like a black hole in the universe.”

“Under the condition of teleportation, it can shrink the object being teleported!”

The Heaven Array said.

“Shrink the object being teleported?”

Wang Xian was slightly surprised.

“Yes, Dragon King. In other words, that thousand-meter-wide altar can cause the entire demon cave to be teleported. All the creatures in the demon cave can be teleported as well.”

“It is also because of this characteristic that the demonic beasts can be summoned to other void spaces.”

The Heaven Array said.

Wang Xian nodded. He looked at an lie and patted his shoulder.

“Roar Roar!”

A low roar came from his mouth. He looked at Wang Xian with fear and obedience.

Although his consciousness had disappeared, he was still 100% obedient to Wang Xian.

“Let’s see if taking a normal fetus can help him recover!”

Wang Xian moved his palm and a normal fetus appeared in his hand.

Taking a normal fetus was an ultimate treasure that was at the peak of the universe.

The ordinary fetus could give birth to sentience in an instant on a withered grass. It could enhance the comprehension and spirituality of any living creature. It was extremely powerful.

Taking out the ordinary fetus, Wang Xian placed it directly into an Lie’s mouth.

Buzz

The ordinary fetus entered his stomach and was digested rapidly. An Lie’s eyes appeared to be somewhat clear.

“Only recovered a Little?”

Wang Xian frowned slightly. He continued to take out the ordinary fetus and placed it into his mouth.

There were more than a hundred normal fetus in the Dragon Palace, so it could be wasted.

One, two, three… A total of ten normal fetus were put into an Lie’s mouth. His body began to change slowly.

The blood-red lines on his body changed.

His body also changed slightly.

“This is?”

The Heaven Array stared at the lines on an Lie’s body. His eyes were shining.

“Dragon King, the lines on his body are exactly the same as the lines on the altar. How did this happen?”

He couldn’t help but exclaim as he stared at the lines carefully.

“Wow, Dragon King, I’ve finally recovered. I don’t want to be a guinea pig anymore!”

At this moment, an lie opened his mouth and said with a miserable expression.

“HMM? You’ve recovered?”

Wang Xian looked at him and asked.
