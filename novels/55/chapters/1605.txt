Chapter 1606: 1606 Battle of Madness 5

“Rumble!”

The 10,000-meter tall mountain collapsed. Looking from afar, it gave people a terrifying visual impact.

Especially the terrifying divine dragon in the sky that was 10,000 meters tall.

“The power of this body is too terrifying. Only the mountain peaks in my mountain range can leave a mark on it. Now, it has collapsed directly!”

“A body of 10,000 meters. The heavenly demon can actually transform into a body of 10,000 meters. I wonder which is more powerful, him or the goddess of desolation!”

“The physical strength of the heavenly demon is very terrifying. However, I still feel that the goddess of desolation is more powerful. The strength of the giant beast of the goddess of desolation is the true destruction of the world. Also, the terrifying means of the goddess of desolation should be stronger than the heavenly demon!”

The various forces in the distance looked at Wang Xian’s figure with shock on their faces.

This 10,000-meter-long body made everyone think of the goddess of desolation and the Giant Beast under her command.

They were the same 10,000-meter-long giant beast. The two of them made a comparison.

Most of the experts still felt that the goddess of desolation was stronger. The means of the goddess of desolation were much stronger than the Sky Demon.

“Apocalyptic Gale!”

“Apocalyptic Gale!”

An angry voice came out from the mouth of the supreme headmaster and Patriarch Fengchi at the same time.

Within a radius of more than ten kilometers, terrifying wind blades descended from the sky and attacked Wang Xian’s 10,000-meter-tall body.

“Five elements millstone, Defend!”

The five elements millstone above his head spun rapidly. A cloud of earth-like fog formed in the sky and completely covered the wind blades in the sky.

“Kill!”

Wang Xian opened his gigantic mouth. A wave of destructive energy shot forward directly.

At the same time, his gigantic body collided with the supreme headmaster and Patriarch Fengchi.

The supreme headmaster and Patriarch Fengchi were wind attribute cultivators. Their speed was already extremely terrifying.

However, compared to Wang Xian who moved 10,000 meters lightly, there was still a huge gap.

“Wind spear!”

The two of them had a slight change in expression. They hurriedly avoided the range of the destructive energy attack. A five-thousand-meter-long sharp wind spear pierced straight at Wang Xian.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The destructive energy continued to attack forward. Behind them, the mountain peaks in the Solitaire Mountains collapsed.

PFFT! PFFT

However, the two five-thousand-meter-long wind spears pierced straight into Wang Xian’s body, bringing with them a large amount of blood.

The appearance of a 100-meter wound was not a serious injury to Wang Xian.

“Bzzz bzzz!”

However, what shocked the supreme headmaster and Patriarch Fengchi was that the open wound was melting rapidly.

The flesh and blood were melting and entering Wang Xian’s body, turning into the purest energy.

“He seems to have consumed a forbidden elixir that uses the consumption of his body to increase his strength. Kill him, we can kill him!”

Patriarch Fengchi was the first to react. His eyes were filled with radiance as he roared.

“Kill!”

A hint of coldness flashed across the Supreme Headmaster’s face. He waved the staff in his hand and gusts of wind lances shot towards Wang Xian.

Patriarch Fengchi held the huge fan with both hands and waved it forward.

“Roar! Roar!”

Faced with the attacks from the two of them, Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with fury and viciousness. He completely ignored the attacks from the two of them. His huge body collided with them directly.

“This is bad. He wants to exchange injuries with us!”

The Supreme Headmaster’s face changed drastically when he saw Wang Xian charging forward fearlessly.

However, it was extremely difficult for them to dodge the attacks from his 10,000-meter-long body.

The wind spear landed on Wang Xian’s body, causing blood to splatter in all directions. Blood rained down onto the ground.

“Bang!”

The huge force collided with the supreme headmaster and Patriarch Fengchi.

The two of them were like flies. Their faces turned extremely pale as they charged backward.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

After crashing through more than ten ten ten-thousand-meter-tall mountains, they finally stopped and spat out a mouthful of blood.

“Damn it, this fellow is fighting with us. He is using up his life force. Let’s Hide!”

Patriarch Fengchi’s eyes flashed with a green light as he reminded the supreme headmaster.

“Yes!”

The supreme headmaster nodded his head. His expression changed slightly as he looked at Wang Xian who was charging towards them.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

The two of them moved and dodged to the left and right respectively.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The sound of collision rang out again. The mountain peaks within the mountain range were smashed into pieces.

“Go to hell!”

More than a dozen mountain peaks were smashed into pieces. The supreme headmaster and Patriarch Fengchi brandished their weapons.

The huge spear landed on Wang Xian’s body once again.

It was a hundred meters deep and fresh blood splattered everywhere.

“Roar, Roar, Dodge? Then I will attack the disciples of your sect!”

Wang Xian roared with a brutal look on his face. He swept his gaze across the area and attacked with the five elements grinding mill.

He knew that he was definitely not a match for the supreme sect leader and Patriarch Fengchi. After consuming the explosive blood pill, he could only kill a few more people before he died.

“Damn it, all disciples of the Solitaire sect, run. Run far away. Today, we will definitely kill the skyfiend!”

The Supreme Sect Master roared and warned all the disciples of the Solitaire sect within a radius of dozens of kilometers.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

“Ahhhh!”

However, when a river of obliteration appeared, it directly attacked the disciples of the Solitaire sect who had no time to dodge.

The energy of the obliteration line killed thousands of disciples of the Solitaire sect.

The rest of the disciples of the Solitaire sect fled into the distance quickly.

“What’s going on? The skyfiend seems to be risking his life. Patriarch Fengchi said that he took a forbidden pill and that he was consuming his life force!”

“The Skyfiend didn’t seem to have such terrifying strength when he was in the Iceheart dynasty. He might have used another method to reach such a level in such a short time!”

“Look, the flesh and blood inside the sky demon’s injuries are burning. The Sky Demon is using his life force to increase his strength!”

Everyone in the surroundings was staring at this battle, especially Wang Xian and the lone faction.

Looking at the condition inside the sky demon’s body, everyone was extremely astonished.

The Sky Demon’s strength seemed to have been forcefully increased through a forbidden method.

“No wonder the supreme sect leader and Patriarch Fengchi of our sect are confident in killing the sky demon. So that’s the reason!”

The elder from the Wuji Empire and the group of experts at level eight of the Seethrough realm had already seen through the clues and whispered.

“However, I’m afraid that our sect will suffer a huge loss during this period!”

Some of the experts said the same thing.

“Interfere with him. We can’t let him destroy our sect!”

The supreme headmaster shouted loudly. He flew to the back of Wang Xian and slashed at the terrifying wind blades.

“If you want to tie me down, trap me!”

Wang Xian saw the supreme headmaster flying to the back and set his eyes on Patriarch Fengchi.

The five elements grinding mill revolved rapidly and flew towards Patriarch Fengchi.

The five elements revolved and the strongest binding force landed directly on Patriarch Fengchi.
