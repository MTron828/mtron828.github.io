Chapter 1471: 1471 was not a dragon that could cross the river

In front of the towering sky sword sect, the three elders of the towering sky sword sect attacked, and the three Golden Swordfish went up to meet them, stunning everyone.

This was the territory of the towering sky sword sect, and behind it was the territory of the towering sky sword sect.

To attack the elders of the towering sky sword sect in this place, wasn’t that courting death?

“Courting death, let me show you what Real Sword Arts are!”

Elder qi and the other two saw the three golden swordfish coming toward them, and their eyes were filled with killing intent.

They didn’t ask the sect for help, because the other party had only sent three people.

As sword arts practitioners, the towering sky sword sect, which had inherited sword arts, was famous in the entire vast region, they weren’t afraid of anyone when facing enemies with swords.

In fact, they were confident that they could defeat swordsmen of the same level.

This was the confidence that came from their foundation.

“Clang, Clang, Clang!”

In the instant that they collided, the three elders held their longswords and collided with the three golden swordfish hundreds of times in an instant.

The sound of sharp swords colliding continuously rang out. They were both metal-elemental fifth-level void interpretation experts, and the center of the battle was like a dazzling sun.

Ten thousand golden sword rays scattered in all directions.

The terrifying sword Qi made everyone around panic and scatter in all directions.

“What exquisite sword techniques!”

In the instant of the collision, the three elders of the towering sky sword sect were instantly at a disadvantage, causing their expressions to change slightly.

“Aspect: Three Talents Sword Formation!”

“Aspect: Three Talents Sword Formation!”

“Aspect: Three Talents Sword Formation!”

At this moment, the three elders shouted in unison, and three dazzling metal greatswords instantly appeared in front of them.

Dharma Idol, three talents sword formation, was a dharma idol evolved from the inherited divine ability of the towering sky sword sect.

Each of the three greatswords was only 100 meters in size, but these three swords could attack together.

Among the Dharma Idols, one of the more exquisite dharma idols was extremely powerful.

“Attack!”

The three of them shouted in unison again, and the three longswords attacked the three golden swordfish.

“Dharma Idols, Wuwei Sword!”

The three golden swordfish didn’t hesitate at all. They shook the longswords in their hands and also used their dharma idols.

A longsword that was only ten meters long appeared in front of them. Each sword was emitting a dazzling golden light.

The golden light covered an area of 1,000 meters. In the area covered by the golden light, outsiders could not even see the long sword inside.

“Kill!”

The three Golden Swordfish did not show any expression on their faces. Their figures moved and directly disappeared into the golden light.

“Be careful!”

Elder qi and the other two were slightly shocked when they saw this strange dharma idol attack, and they reminded in a low voice.

“The strength of those three swordsmen is so terrifying!”

“What sharp sword techniques. It seems that they are also from the same sword sect!”

When the surrounding families and families saw the six people fighting together, they were shocked.

“Which force is this? They are actually evenly matched with our elders!”

A disciple of the towering sky sword sect looked at them in shock.

“The battle has just begun. No one is a match for our towering sky sword sect in terms of swordsmanship, let alone a faction from a small place!”

The eldest senior brother of the towering sky sword sect stared at them with a twinkle in his eyes. When his gaze swept past Wang Xian and the rest, he looked at the Deacons at the side and said, “Deacons, should we seek help from the experts of the sect?”

“No need. Let’s wait and see. They won’t dare to do anything!”

The few middle-aged men waved their hands and didn’t put Wang Xian and the rest in their eyes at all.

Even if they had three strong practitioners at the fifth level of the Seethrough void stage who were fighting against their elders.

If they were to seek help now and the strong practitioners of the sect were to be mobilized, it wouldn’t be embarrassing enough if the opponents were just these dead fishes and shrimps!

“Ah!”

“Elder, save us! Save Us!”

At this moment, a scream for help suddenly came from below.

Everyone’s expression changed slightly as they hurriedly looked in the direction of the song clan below.

They saw Ren Xingchen standing on the ship with a long sword in his hand. In front of him, more than ten corpses lay on the side.

Song Wan stared at Ren Xingchen with a terrified expression as she screamed loudly.

“Ren Xingchen, if you dare to kill us, the towering sky sword sect will not let you off. Stop, Stop!”

As she spoke, she pointed at Ren Xingchen and shouted with a stern expression.

Ren Xingchen stared at Song Wan without any expression on his face.

“Stop, our towering Sky Sword sect is warning you. If you dare to kill our people and go against our will, none of you will be able to leave this place today!”

A deacon saw Ren Xingchen slaughtering people from the song clan. His expression changed slightly as he shouted coldly.

“Stupid!”

When Wang Xian saw the deacon’s words, a faint sneer appeared on his face.

He raised his head and looked at the sky.

The area covered by the golden radiance covered all three elders of the Atlas Sword sect.

At this moment, he smiled and looked at the three figures that were gradually becoming clearer!

“Look... that... that is...”

In the surrounding area, a profound void martial artist on a ship suddenly stared at the sky in shock. He pointed at the three figures that had faintly appeared and shouted loudly.

The three figures quickly descended towards the area below.

Everyone raised their heads and looked towards the sky. They looked at the three figures who were wearing golden clothing and had a mountain peak pattern on their backs.

“It’s elder qi and the others... they...”

All the disciples and deacons of the towering sky sword sect looked over as well. Their pupils dilated and their mouths opened slightly.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

The sound of collision could be heard. The Three Corpses fell directly onto the ship of the song clan.

Song Wan, who was pointing at Ren Xingchen, froze.

The surroundings instantly fell silent. Only the sound of waves could be heard.

Cold Sweat appeared on the faces of everyone from the song clan.

“Elder qi and the rest have been killed!”

“They... they actually... really dared to kill elder qi and the rest!”

Everyone was stunned. Looking at the bodies of elder Qi and the rest, they muttered to themselves.

They actually dared to kill the elders of the Atlas Sword sect at the entrance of the Atlas Sword sect.

Were they going to attack the towering sky sword sect?

Everyone looked at Wang Xian and the 200 or so people behind him.

Were these people courting death? or...

“An enemy has invaded. Three elders have been killed. An enemy has invaded!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Request for reinforcements from the sect!”

At this moment, the disciples and deacons who were floating in the sky revealed a look of fear.

The deacons who had said that everything was fine roared in fear.

The roar resounded throughout the entire sea area.

“Eh?”

The terrified voice resounded throughout the entire towering sky sword sect, causing all the disciples and experts to be slightly stunned.

“Someone has invaded. which death-seeking bastard dares to attack our towering sky sword sect!”

“Three elders have been killed? Death-seeking? Cut them into a thousand pieces!”

Inside the towering Sky Sword Peak, a group of experts and disciples looked out with cold killing intent in their eyes.

“An ant killed a disciple of our sword sect at the gate of our sword sect!”

“Pa!”

At the peak of the towering Sky Sword Peak, two people wearing golden clothes and golden crowns were sitting in front of the chess board.

He glanced down through the layers of clouds and said calmly.

“HMM, here!”

The old man on the other side said calmly as he stared at the chess board and gently placed the Chess Pieces down!
