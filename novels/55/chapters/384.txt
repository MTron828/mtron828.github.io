Chapter 385: Sacred Enforcers (1)

Birds were flying in the sky above an island with viridescent trees, and a kind of captivating flower grew on the island.

The beach was enchanting with a group of vintage-looking buildings in the middle.

The entire island was like a wonderland.

At this time, a group of young men was lying before a wooden house on the beach. There were babes by the side, snuggling affectionately beside these young men.

“Hur? Something big happened in the Underworld!”

Just then, a young man exclaimed with astonishment while he was looking at his phone.

“Things happen in the Underworld every day. Why? What caught your eyes?”

A young man in a black swimming suit was caressing the babe beside him as he spoke with a smile.

“Hai Long, you’re no longer the first on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart. Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown, aged 20, has annihilated Nine Lotus Sect and slew an elder from Sacred Followers Guild.”

That young man was appalled as he scrolled through the thread posts.

“What? Someone replaced Hai Long and took over the No.1 in the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart?”

Several young men sat up around him as they cast their attention to that young man.

Only one young man, who was wearing a yellow robe with a golden dragon embroidered on it, did not sit up. He squinted his eyes slightly.

“It’s true. He went up against four Inborn Experts alone and killed all of them. What... what a great strength he has!”

“The Outstanding Young Heroes Chart reviewed him as the 20-year-old demon-like genius. He killed four Inborn Experts with a sword. The formidable results landed him the first position on this chart.”

Several young men exclaimed in shock. He killed four Inborn Experts at the age of 20. Just like what the Underworld’s critic said of him: a demon-like genius.

“Let me take a look!”

The young man in a yellow golden dragon robe stretched out his hand and spoke to the other young guy at the side.

“Look, Brother Hai Long!”

That man quickly walked over and handed his phone to him.

“With Inborn Spiritual Weapon, he slew four Inborn Experts alone!”

When the young man read the story on the phone, he drew his lips and said, “Perhaps I have not made my move for a long time...”

As he spoke, he returned the phone back to that young guy and sat in his chair without taking this to heart.

“Brother Hai Long, your strength is...?”

When the group of young men heard his casual tone, their eyes narrowed as they tried to sniff out some information.

“If my dad contains his strength at Inborn Realm, I can exchange over ten strokes with him!” Hai Long said nonchalantly.

“What?”

The group of young men was stunned, with disbelief on their faces.

The ability to exchange more than ten strokes with his father was extremely fearsome.

Hai Long’s father was ranked second on the Outstanding Experts Chart. He was the true-blue peerless expert and an unrivaled existence.

Once, his father killed an Inborn Expert with just one finger, shocking everyone in the Underworld.

Yet, Hai Long was able to exchange more than ten strokes with his father even though he had controlled his level to be the same as his son.

“Brother Hai Long is invincible among the young generation. When that Wang Xian meets you, he will find out what a real outstanding young hero is!”

“That’s right, Brother Hai Long. If he bumps into you, he’ll pale into insignificance in comparison!”

Every one of them began their bootlicking.

“Hehe, isn’t the competition for the young heroes going to start soon? I’ll go and have some fun this year,” Hai Long said with a beaming smile as he looked off, exuding immense confidence and superiority from within.

...

“Outstanding Young Heroes Chart? The charts in the Underworld are all jokes. Killing four Inborn Experts just by yourself at the age of 20? Your strength is quite formidable!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“But, I’ll defeat you if I have an Inborn Spiritual Weapon!”

In a quaint house among the towering mountains, a young man drew his lips as he read the message sent by his subordinate.

...

“Amitabha. All martial arts in the world originated from the Ancient Temple. Finally, I have the chance to go out after staying in this monastery for more than 30 years.”

Back at an ancient temple, a young monk received an order from his master to make his way out of the mountain. As such, he was smiling from ear to ear.

He stroked his bald head and said, “What a wonderful and attractive world outside. Oh, I have to make a name for myself. Recently, the Underworld has been quite bustling! Hehe!”

The young monk looked greasy on his face with cloudy eyes, and didn’t look like a monk at all.

...

The Underworld was experiencing turbulent times with the appearance of a demon-like genius. Everyone was shocked. At the same time, some prideful talents were unconvinced.

The top five rankings on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart were all at the Inborn Realm.

This was a known fact. Many sects and schools also hid their gifted disciples for their safety.

As such, more hidden talents remained unknown.

After all, there was more than a billion people within the country. The probability of a demon-like genius appearing was extremely high.

Back at a vast space surrounded by a dense bamboo forest in a grassland.

There was a palace sitting in the middle of the bamboo forest.

The palace was huge, spanning an area of ten thousand square meters. The entire region was filled with the scent of medicine.

If any ordinary people were to stay in this place, they could comfortably live up to a hundred years old.

There was quite a large amount of herbs planted around the palace. It was incredibly picturesque with the palace pavilions within it.

The signboard titled ‘Sacred Followers Guild’ was hung on one of the main buildings located at the center of the palace.

“This matter obviously arises because Elder Feng crippled Miracle Doctor Wang’s sister with venom. Hence, Miracle Doctor Wang had his killing spree. I think we should plan our moves properly.”

“Elder Yan She, our elder of the Sacred Followers Guild has been killed. What plan do we need?”

“Everyone in the Underworld is waiting to see our response. If we don’t react to it, I’m sure everyone will think that we’re weaklings. We cannot allow this precedent. So what if he is known as the demon-like genius?”

“We should kill him. Since he killed Old Feng, he must die. This is the Sacred Followers Guild’s dignity!”

A group of more than thirty fearsome elders were sitting within the hall.

They all shared the same mightiness of a supreme leader as they quarreled within the hall.

However, the chairperson’s seat was empty as the Guild Leader of the Sacred Followers Guild was not present.

Yan She swept his gaze across everyone sitting in front of him with a frown as he said, “The objective of the Sacred Followers Guild is to help each other, ensuring the safety of every Miracle Doctor. No one will provoke us if we don’t do it first. Now, Elder Feng has been killed because of his own doings. Do we have to take revenge for someone who creates troubles?”

“Hmph, Yan She. Shut up. Old Feng is dead, and it hasn’t been that long. He’s one of our elders in the Sacred Followers Guild. Aren’t we avenging him for when he was killed by someone else?”
