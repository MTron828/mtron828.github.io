Chapter 1602: 1602 Battle of Madness 1

“Roar Roar Roar!”

Roars came from Mo Sha’s demonic qi. The roars were like a dragon’s roar, majestic and terrifying.

The two terrifying demonic qi turned into ferocious dragon heads and attacked the nine Lotus sect and the dust gate respectively.

Mo sha spread his arms and looked like an awakened demon.

“What? This aura!”

“This... this... My God!”

“This aura is definitely not something that can be emitted by an eighth level profound void martial artist!”

The Devil Qi swept out in all directions, and the Devil Dragon swept out. It was filled with a brutal murderous aura.

When the nine Lotus sect’s patriarch and the Dust Gate’s patriarch sensed this terrifying aura, their expressions changed drastically, and their foreheads were covered in cold sweat.

“No... No...”

However, in the nine Lotus sect’s and the dust sect’s positions, there were a total of four to five hundred sect disciples.

Those who were able to attend this banquet today were all core disciples of the sect.

When they felt the attack that was filled with a destructive aura approaching, their faces revealed expressions of fear.

This aura was too strong!

Level nine void interpretation, 100% level nine void interpretation.

Everyone’s faces were filled with despair.

“Boom!”

The disciples and experts of the two great sects didn’t have the slightest reaction. The terrifying attack instantly killed him.

Moreover, Mo sha clearly used an extremely cruel method to make his flesh and blood fly everywhere.

Blood splattered everywhere!

Not a single one was left!

“Ninth level void interpretation stage!”

“Since when did our vast region have an expert at the ninth level Void Interpretation Stage!”

The elder from the Wuji Empire roared in a low voice. Nangong Jianghe’s gaze stared at Mo Sha as his eyes flickered with a luster. Similarly, he spoke directly.

“Ninth level void interpretation stage?”

These four words caused all the people from the various factions to gulp as they stared at Mo Sha in disbelief.

“Keke, these two small fries actually dare to court death. Don’t be anxious. After I leave today, I will make your nine Lotus sect and dust sect vanish into thin air!”

Mo sha ignored the exclamations and shocked gazes around him. His gaze swept past the nine Lotus sect and dust sect’s patriarchs as he laughed heartily with a face full of smiles.

In the eyes of the nine Lotus sect and Dust Sect’s two patriarchs, his smile was like that of an abyss demon.

The bodies of the two could not help but tremble. They looked at the position of their sect in a daze.

All of them were killed. Not a single one was left alive.

They did not have the slightest doubt about Mo Sha’s words.

They could already imagine the fate of their sect after provoking a demon of the ninth level of the profound void tier along with the Sky Demon.

“Why is it like this?”

Their eyes were filled with endless regret.

In their opinion, the Sky Demon was doomed to die today. They only wanted to curry favor with the lone sect. How could they expect to end up like this?

“Level nine of the profound void tier, are you going to be our lone sect’s enemy?”

The lone sovereign sect master stared at Mo Sha with a cold expression and clenched his fists.

An expert of the same level was already able to make their sect treat him seriously!

In fact, they even had to deal with him carefully.

After all, there were only two experts of level nine of the Seethrough realm in their sect.

If they could not make an enemy out of him completely, it would be the best choice.

As the supreme headmaster spoke, his face was no longer as arrogant as before. He looked a little embarrassed.

“Send Jian ‘er over!”

Without waiting for Mo sha to reply, Wang Xian’s cold voice rang out.

This sentence made everyone from the supreme headmaster look extremely embarrassed.

Sending Ling Jian ‘er over was equivalent to snatching the marriage. Furthermore, it was snatching the marriage of the young master of the Supreme Headmaster.

Once Ling Jian ‘er left with him, the supreme headmaster would lose a lot of face!

“You’re wishful thinking, just based on you...”

Ao Tian’s face was filled with anger as he stared at Wang Xian with blood-red eyes and roared.

“It’s best if you send my boss Tian Mo’s wife over. Otherwise, for the next few thousand years, I will play well with the only sect. Keke!”

“Unless you can kill me, you will have to hide in the only mountains forever. Keke!”

However, before he could finish his sentence, Mo Sha’s faint voice was heard. As he spoke, his figure moved and came to Wang Xian’s side.

The two of them were facing solitaire sect, one of the three major forces in the vast region.

Mo Sha’s face was filled with arrogance.

At this moment, Mo Sha felt that his body was abnormally strong, especially the position of his heart. An endless stream of demonic energy was providing him with energy.

He felt as if he was going to blow up the sky.

He, who was originally arrogant, now had a domineering aura that showed that he didn’t put the people in the world in his eyes.

This domineering aura was even stronger than the current supreme sect leader.

“Hiss, that old man actually called Sky Demon boss, this...”

“A level nine profound void martial artist, Sky Demon also has a level nine profound void martial artist by his side. Now, it will be difficult for the sect to destroy Sky Demon!”

“This time, the only sect has truly encountered a tough opponent!”

All the surrounding factions were extremely shocked when they saw the sudden appearance of the ninth level profound void martial stage expert.

They had never imagined that the old man by the Sky Demon’s side would actually be such a terrifying existence.

The ninth level of the profound void martial stage was invincible in the vast region.

The gazes of the various factions swept past the nine Lotus sect and the dust gate, revealing mocking expressions.

These two first-rate forces were going to be finished.

“You... you...”

Young lord ao Tian’s expression changed drastically when he heard Mo Sha’s words.

Even the supreme headmaster’s expression was extremely ugly. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“No one dares to threaten our only sect!”

At this moment, an angry voice came from the sky.

An old man holding a dragon-headed walking stick was sitting on a green dragon chair floating in the air.

“Patriarch Fengchi, it’s Patriarch Fengchi of the Solitaire sect!”

Seeing the figure suddenly appear, everyone was slightly shocked and immediately looked up.

“Keke, so what if I threaten the solitaire sect? With just the two of you, can you stop me, Mo Sha?”

“Old Geezer, today I leisurely came to the Solitaire Sect’s land. I can also leisurely walk out. So what if I threaten you?”

Mo sha arrogantly shouted at everyone in only me sect.

When the surrounding people saw the incomparably arrogant mo sha, they were slightly stunned and quietly watched.

Mo Sha’s arrogance had its own right to be arrogant.

Although only me sect had two experts at the ninth level of the profound void tier, it was extremely difficult to really leave Mo sha here.

“Ka Ka Ka Ka Ka!”

The supreme headmaster looked at the incomparably arrogant Mo Sha, tightly clenching his arm and emitting crisp sounds. His eyes flickered with a crazy killing intent.

Patriarch Fengchi also slowly stood up and locked onto Mo Sha.

“Don’t glare at me. Come and F * ck me if you have the guts. If you don’t have the guts, immediately send boss Mo’s wife over!”

Mo Sha’s face was filled with laughter as he glanced at the supreme headmaster and Patriarch Fengchi!

Light as the wind and light as the clouds!
