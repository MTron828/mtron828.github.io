3675 3674 instantly went mad

“Eh?”

The Mad Demon quickly flew towards the battlefield.

Soon, the scene in front of him appeared in his sight!

When he saw this scene, his eyes slightly focused!

The other experts also saw the scene in front of them!

The huge corpse of the lava space beast floated in the void. The Dragon King’s aura was much weaker, and there was a wound on his body from the Lava Space Beast’s Attack!

“Oh? What fast speed. The Dragon King actually killed the lava space beast so quickly? That’s Amazing!”

“The lava space beast was killed by him, but he was also injured. This is a huge opportunity for us!”

“He must have used some powerful trump card. Our Chance is here!”

The experts in the Magic Breaker Circle looked ahead, their eyes filled with joy.

“Attack!”

Jin Yu squinted his eyes slightly and immediately gave the order to attack!

At this moment, the Dragon King was injured. It was the right time for them to attack!

Buzz, Whoosh

Without any hesitation, the Gold Mountain in Jin Yu’s hand flew up. The flowing water on it erupted with golden and blue rays.

A water tornado was formed instantly. In the middle of the water tornado, there was a terrifying gold mountain!

It charged straight at Wang Xian!

“Water demon palm!”

“Celestial Nation, suppress!”

“Godly Tiger Roar, Roar Roar Roar!”

From the left and right, a series of extremely terrifying attacks instantly charged at Wang Xian!

“What?”

When Wang Xian saw them charging at him, he pretended to be surprised and growled, “You guys are courting death!”

As he spoke, he did not hesitate at all. He kept the lava space beast and dodged to the back!

“Haha, Are We Courting Death? Dragon King, you are the one who is courting death. Today is the day you die for stealing our Demon Breaker’s Space Beast!”

“Escape? Dragon King, don’t even think about escaping. Didn’t you say that you were going to sweep through our invincible region? Why are you still running away now?”

Seeing Wang Xian instantly hiding behind him to the right, the more than 150 experts in the demon breaker circle revealed excited looks in their eyes. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

They roared loudly!

The Dragon King did not fight them and fled immediately. This meant that the Dragon King must have been seriously injured!

Moreover, in order to kill the lava space behemoth, he might have already unleashed a powerful technique.

The current technique could not be used for the time being!

Swoosh

Wang Xian’s figure moved and fled to the back at a rapid speed!

“Give chase!”

The Mad Demon Jin Gui roared loudly and suddenly increased his speed!

As long as he could temporarily restrain the Dragon King, he would be able to surround the Dragon King.

Once he surrounded the dragon king, he had the confidence to suppress it!

“Hehe, we’re here!”

Wang Xian continued to fly deeper. When he stepped into this territory, a smile appeared on his face!

However, he did not stop. The experts from the demon breaker circle behind him continued to pursue him!

“Wu Sha, lock onto that guy who looks like a bee-man. I want to kill him instantly!”

Wang Xian immediately ordered Wu Sha!

“It’s the Dragon King. He is Jin Yu, and he is also an expert at the level of a crazy demon. The other water man is a water demon, and he is also a crazy demon. However, that water man is merely a powerful water clone of the water demon!”

Wu Sha’s voice was heard as she spoke to Wang Xian!

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly.

Wu Sha had already discovered Jin Xu and the water demon when they arrived!

Their arrival must be a conspiracy!

Wang Xian had already made preparations!

One was a mad demon at the peak while the other was a powerful mad demon clone. Furthermore, he could sense that there were two more powerful old monsters among them!

If he could kill one of them in an instant, Wang Xian would be able to capture them all in one go and kill them all!

“The first one, let’s start with that Mad Demon Jin Tao. Let’s see who’s courting death!”

Wang Xian flapped his divine wings. The five elements grinding mill and the Tai Chi Dragon Plate were glowing!

In front of him, the shadows of the Netherworld Ghosts were faintly appearing!

“Dragon King, it’s Here!”

Wu Sha’s voice was heard. At the back, Jin Tao was the fastest. He was the first to step into the area covered by Wu Sha’s spell formation!

At this moment, Wu Sha’s spell formation was fully activated. Her target was Jin Tao, an expert!

Four spell formations, trapping spell formation and killing spell formation, were activated at the same time!

At this moment, Wang Xian’s uninitiated holy wings were flapping violently. The power of wind and thunder was circulating rapidly on it!

He turned around swiftly and his netherspirit avatar appeared on his left and right!

“Roar!”

Wang Xian let out a low roar and transformed into the body of a divine dragon. The tai chi dragon coiled around him while the five elements millstone hovered above his head!

The figure of the spirit appeared beside Wang Xian as well. Various augmentation abilities landed on Wang Xian’s body!

At this moment, he unleashed all his energy and trump cards!

Whoosh

The dragon’s body flickered and disappeared instantly!

“Not good!”

“Not good, there’s an ambush!”

When Jin Tao sensed the energy of the formation around him, he suddenly had a bad premonition!

Especially when he sensed the huge change in the Dragon King’s aura in front of him, his expression changed drastically!

He waved his arm and the Golden Mountain flew towards him. In an instant, it arrived above his head.

Golden light enveloped the water and poured down!

He was in the middle and was completely enveloped by the golden light and water!

“What terrifying speed. This Dragon King doesn’t seem to be injured at all. Could it be that he already knew about our attack in advance? What’s with this array formation?”

At this moment, many doubts surged in his heart!

“Not good, there’s an ambush. It’s an array formation!”

At the rear, more than 150 experts saw the sudden surge of power, and their expressions were stunned as they roared loudly!

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

At the instant they discovered it, the terrifying four formations had already fallen towards Jin Yu!

Crazy Demon Jin Yu’s strength was very strong.

But unfortunately, he was facing the invincible region’s strongest magus, the old witch.

Under her unprepared attacks, he could only use his innate supreme treasure to block!

However, he was caught off guard by the old witch’s well-prepared attack. The terrifying formation landed on top of it, causing the entire innate supreme treasure golden mountain to tremble violently!

The flow of water on top of it also stopped instantly!

The huge Golden Mountain flew backward!

At this moment, Wang Xian appeared in front of him!

The terrifying five elements millstone came to the top of his head. The five divine dragons revolved rapidly, and streams of destructive power of the five elements charged at him!

The power of the Tai Chi Dragon, coiling light and dark divine dragons, covered the dragon’s claws and clawed at him rapidly!

Four netherspirit avatars were also charging at him from the left and right!

“No, no, no!”

Crazy Demon Jin Yan looked at this incomparably terrifying attack and his body trembled violently.

If the attack of the formation caught him off guard and was enough to injure him!

That Wang Xian’s attack, already can make him fatal!

He could clearly sense the threat of death, the deadly attack!

“Poof!”

However, with the speed of Wang Xian, he simply can not resist!

The destructive power of the five elements penetrated his body, the dragon claw directly in the hand!

Twinkle!
