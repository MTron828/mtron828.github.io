Chapter 1098: 1099, I’ll give you a city

Translator: 5496903

The Blood Barbaric Demon Beast clan controlled the fierce beasts and went to the human towns to massacre the cities in order to obtain a large amount of fresh blood.

They managed to control eight or nine fierce beast clans with great difficulty and broke into Xilai town. In the end, they were not prepared enough for the first time, and more than half of the humans escaped.

This made their harvest not very satisfactory, and the leader of the Blood Barbaric Demon Beast was also unable to break through to the insightful emptiness realm.

Now that they had made a perfect plan to attack holy sea town, a human had suddenly appeared and led a group of Strange Demon Beasts to kill most of their clansmen.

Under the circumstances, they could only devour their own kind in order to evolve.

In order to kill the guy who had obstructed them and devour more than a million people of holy sea town.

However, he had not expected this situation. Moreover, what made him most furious was that the corpses of the fierce beasts were also gone.

These dead ferocious beasts were also a huge source of energy for the Blood Barbarian Demon Beast. However, even the final corpses were gone.

This made its eyes extremely red.

It could not accept this outcome!

Wang Xian laughed mockingly when he heard the words of the Blood Barbarian Demon Beast. Earlier on, he had asked Ao Yao to bring the corpses of the ferocious beasts in the spirit storage bag.

The main reason why he came here was for these corpses.

There were hundreds of thousands of corpses on the ground. Some of them were at the half-step void interpretation realm, and there were also dozens of those at the level of level nine of transcendence. This was simply a huge amount of resources.

Wang Xian did not dare to imagine what level more than 3,000 members of the Dragon Palace would be able to reach if these corpses were converted into dragon blood in the Dragon Transformation Pool!

At the very least, they would be able to reach the level of level four or five of transcendence, right?

It would be easy for them to nurture a few transcendent level seven or eight! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Blood Barbarian Demon Beast, go to Hell. You still want to kill Lord Wang? Dream On!”

“Beast, go to Hell. You will never be able to enter and never be able to kill us!”

The words of the blood barbarian demon beast displeased everyone in Shenghai Town. Damn it, he actually dared to say that he wanted to kill our savior. He was simply courting death.

No, although we can’t beat you, but you can’t come in. We can scold you!

The people of Holy Sea town immediately turned into big haters and cursed at the Blood Barbarian Demon Beast.

While cursing at them, they were secretly happy. Cursing at the Demon Beast of the profound void tier was still very enjoyable!

“Roar!”

Finally, the Blood Barbarian Demon Beast roared and flew into the sky.

“Die, die, die, die, all of you have to die. I don’t believe that all of you won’t come out!”

The leader of the Blood Barbarian Demonic Beast hid in the dark clouds. He stared at Shenghai town with a ferocious and twisted expression.

He wanted to wait here. Once someone came out, he would eat them up!

“Everyone, settle your own matters!”

Wang Xian glanced at the blood barbarian demonic beast hiding in the sky and shouted loudly.

“Yes, Sir!”

Everyone below hurriedly responded.

“Everyone, settle your own matters. Everyone, do not leave the city for the time being!”

Jin Qianyuan roared loudly in the sky once again and the news spread throughout the entire Shenghai town.

Everyone walked towards their respective residences with the joy of having survived a calamity. Meanwhile, the citizens who had fled from Xilai town returned to their temporary residences with smiles on their faces.

“Sir Wang Xian, that demonic beast might not have left yet. It will be troublesome if it keeps guarding here!”

Jin Qianyuan looked at Wang Xian and walked over.

Now, even he addressed Wang Xian as Sir.

“Just Call Me Wang Xian. If it wants to wait for us in the vicinity, let it wait. I will take care of it in the future!”

Wang Xian smiled and said nonchalantly.

“Alright, I will go and settle some matters in the city first. I will let Liuyan bring you back to the mayor’s residence first!”

Jin Qianyuan smiled and said.

“Alright, you can go and do your work first!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. With a move of his body, he and Jin Liuyan flew towards the mayor’s residence.

After fighting for so long, even he felt a little tired.

“It seems like I will have to ask Feng Luan to deal with the Blood Barbarian Demonic Beast in the sky!”

Wang Xian came to the mayor’s residence and took a look at the leader of the Bloody Savage Demonic Beast in the sky. He thought to himself.

“Wang Xian, I’ll pour you some tea!”

Jin Liuyan looked at Wang Xian and walked into the room to prepare some hot tea with a face full of admiration.

“Thank you!”

Wang Xian smiled and took out his communication stone plate to contact Feng Luan.

He and Feng Luan had only been separated for a few days. However, with the strength of the old lady, they should have returned to the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan.

“When are you coming to star-moon kingdom? When are you going to attack Donghai City?”

Wang Xian sat on a chair and sent a message through the communication stone plate.

The internal part of the communication stone plate was a formation. Unless there was a special place to block the formation, they could communicate directly.

After sending the message, Wang Xian saw Jin Liuyan handing him a cup of tea.

“Take a break, our unrivaled hero!”

She said with a smile.

“Thank you!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly.

However, at this moment, in the fiery cloud mountain range, there was an extremely huge volcanic mountain range.

It was a volcano that was hundreds of kilometers long. Many of the volcanoes were still emitting flames and the temperature could reach up to a hundred degrees Celsius.

This was the Holy Land of the fire lark tribe.

At this moment, in the middle of a volcano that was tens of thousands of meters tall, there was a holy palace.

In a room in the Fire Cloud Sparrow Sacred Hall, Feng Luan frowned as she looked at the information in front of her.

“Is the information accurate?”

Her expression was somewhat unsightly as she slowly asked.

“Empress, there can’t be any mistakes. The king of star-moon kingdom broke through to the fourth level of the profound void realm not long ago. Star-moon kingdom has been hiding this information all along!”

The old woman nodded and said affirmatively. After hesitating for a moment, she looked at her. “Empress, why don’t we wait a few years? After a few years, even if we occupy a city in star-moon kingdom, we can still resist the star-moon kingdom’s Army!”

“A few years?”

Feng Luan was slightly helpless. She originally wanted to directly take down East Sea city and use it as a foundation to slowly develop.

However, there were some problems now. The star-moon kingdom’s King’s strength had broken through and reached the fourth rank of the profound void realm.

The Fire Cloud Sparrow clan absolutely could not make a move against her current subordinates because once they revealed any traces, they would be in danger.

Besides the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan, he also had three subordinates with decent strength.

Two were at the second level of the void interpretation realm, and one was at the third level of the void interpretation realm!

Originally, star-moon kingdom’s King was only an expert at the third level of the void interpretation realm. After taking down East Sea city, even if star-moon kingdom’s army came to attack, they would still be able to resist!

But now, star-moon kingdom’s King had broken through. If the king personally led the expedition, then they would be completely unable to resist.

After all, star-moon kingdom only had ten cities. It was impossible for star-moon kingdom to give up one city just because they wanted to.

Secondly, there was the issue of the People’s hearts. Although this world was a world of experts, if one wanted to develop a kingdom and allow it to develop rapidly, there was a very important issue.

That was the People’s hearts.

The People’s hearts were blood that flowed endlessly. If one lost the People’s hearts, even if experts appeared, they would not be loyal to the kingdom. What use would that be?

The second point was a big problem for her. She did not expect that even the first point was a huge problem!

She could not take down East Sea City!
