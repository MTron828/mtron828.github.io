Chapter 1064: 1065 made his move

“Boom!”

The five instructors attacked, including an expert at transcendent-level rank 8.

With one strike, the group of imperial crocodiles that were chasing stopped instantly. Seven to eight transcendent-level rank 6 imperial crocodiles died under director Qian’s attack.

“Five instructors blocked the imperial crocodiles that were charging over!”

Some students heard the sound of the attack and turned their heads to look. Their faces revealed pleasant surprise.

“Roar!”

However, at this moment, a muffled roar was heard. It caused everyone’s hearts to tremble involuntarily.

“It’s a transcendent level 8 Emperor Crocodile Beast!”

A student who was escaping had a pale face. His lips were trembling slightly.

“Not good!”

At this moment, the faces of the five teachers who were left behind to defend against the Beast also changed slightly. Their faces revealed an embarrassed expression.

An extraordinary level eight ferocious beast was in big trouble!

“No wonder the leader of the freshmen said that it’s dangerous ahead...”

One of the instructors thought of Wang Xian’s words and his face darkened.

At that time, they should have listened to him. Even if they didn’t listen, they would have gone ahead to investigate for their safety.

That way, they wouldn’t have encountered such a situation.

It was dangerous. It was extremely dangerous. Even for them, they might lose their lives in the face of such a ferocious beast!

“Hold on for a few more minutes, then escape!”

Director Qian gripped the long blade in his hand tightly, his gaze cold as he stared at the transcendent rank 8 Imperial Croc that was running towards them, his expression ugly as he growled in a low voice.

“Alright!”

The other four looked at each other, their faces solemn as they instantly launched large scale attacks.

Their divine abilities directly attacked the Imperial Crocs.

“Roar!”

Suddenly, a low roar was heard. The faces of the four teachers changed drastically as they looked at the top of their heads.

Five mountain-like earth peaks smashed towards them, and a terrifying attractive force came from the ground.

They hurriedly looked forward, and their faces darkened.

The five imperial crocodiles, which were more than ten meters in size, stared coldly at the four of them.

“Gulp!”

“Five rank seven transcendents!”

The four of them broke out in cold sweat. They gritted their teeth and roared, “Kill!”

Kill!

With a slash, they slashed towards the mountain peak in the sky.

However, this Earth Peak was a divine ability of the Croc.

The Croc’s strength was definitely at the top among those of the same level.

Under their attacks, only two of the five earth peaks were destroyed. The four of them hurriedly dodged into the distance.

“Boom!”

The earth peaks landed on the ground, and with a loud sound, the ground caved in.

“Roar Roar!”

At this moment, director Qian was also fighting with a transcendent level 8 beast.

However, the group of transcendent level 6 and level 5 Emperor Crocodiles chased after the group of students in front.

The speed of a transcendent level 6 was not something that those transcendent level 4 students could compare to.

“Ah!”

The more than 500 students who were fleeing in front heard the sound from behind, and their faces were filled with shock.

The last few students couldn’t help but look behind them, and let out a sound of fear.

“Pu Pu Pu!”

In an instant, huge earth spikes suddenly shot out from the ground, and the earth spikes directly pierced into the bodies of the five students. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Ah Ah Ah Ah!”

The sound of screams rang out, causing everyone’s hearts to beat violently and their faces to turn pale.

“The fierce beasts have caught up, caught up, more than a dozen transcendent level 6 monarch crocodiles!”

A girl shouted with a face full of fear.

“Ah, save me, save me!”

As she ran, she suddenly felt her footsteps become heavy. Her expression changed drastically and was filled with fear.

Panic. All the students were panicking.

There were more than ten transcendent level 6 imperial crocodiles behind her, and there was a group of fierce beasts chasing after them.

They had no chance of resisting at all.

“Go to the direction of the captain. Find the captain. He can deal with this group of Fierce Beasts!”

A student suddenly shouted loudly and fled to the left.

“Yes, yes. The Captain has eleven transcendent level 7 experts under him. As long as we find the captain, we will be safe!”

“Quick, change direction. Go to the left, go to the left!”

The students shouted in fear.

When Qian Hu, who was at the front, heard the students’words, his expression changed drastically. He gritted his teeth and also fled to the left.

They were filled with regret now. If they had followed the captain, if they had followed the captain, they would not have encountered so many fierce beasts!

“Ah, Ah, save me, save me!”

Hearing the screams coming from behind, everyone’s expression turned even uglier.

...

“Captain, did you hear anything?”

At this moment, at a spot not far away from them, Xia houming heard the sounds coming from afar. His expression changed slightly as he spoke to Wang Xian.

The rest of the people were also listening attentively with a look of surprise on their faces.

“I heard it!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and looked in the direction of the voice. He said faintly, “It’s the other students. They are being chased by ferocious beasts!”

“Huh? How is this possible? There are five instructors following them... could it be...”

Xia houming and the rest were slightly stunned. They looked astonished. “Could it be that they are in trouble?”

“It’s not just trouble. They are simply courting death!”

Wang Xian looked ahead with a cold look in his eyes. He gestured to Ao Jian and the rest.

“Get ready to attack!”

“Yes!”

Ao Jian and the rest nodded their heads.

“Ahhh!”

In less than a minute, a group of people appeared in the sight of Wang Xian and the rest. They were accompanied by screams.

Boom

An extraordinary level six alligator jumped to the front and blocked everyone’s path.

Qian Hu’s expression changed drastically. He moved his body and flew directly from the sky.

“Captain Qian Hu, save us!”

A few young men shouted in horror when they saw this scene.

However, Qian Hu, who was running away, did not care at all. He did not even turn his head.

“Make your move. If we were any later, we might all be dead!”

Wang Xian said to Ao Jian and the rest.

“Yes, leader!”

The eleven Golden Swordfish moved and instantly appeared more than a kilometer in front of them.

“Sword Thrust!”

The strength of the golden swordfish could be comparable to a level 8 supernatural realm expert. It was easy for them to deal with this group of level 6 overlord crocodiles.

“Roar! Roar!”

Streaks of sword rays flashed by. The dozen level six supernatural realm ferocious beasts that were chasing after them were instantly killed.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

One by one, the crocodiles fell to the ground.

“They are the subordinates of Captain Wang Xian!”

“We’re saved! We’re saved!”

“It’s too dangerous! It’s simply too dangerous!”

When the students saw the crocodiles that were lying heavily on the ground, they shouted loudly after surviving the calamity.

Wang Xian, Xia houming, and the rest walked over slowly.

Their eyes swept across the crowd. There were less than 500 people, and at least 60 to 70 of them had died.

They were in an extremely sorry state. There were also a few young men who were injured.

The crowd was filled with fear. Some of them even collapsed on the ground.

When they encountered a group of level eight, level seven, and level six extraordinary alligator king, they, the students from the Demon Hunter College, could not resist at all.
