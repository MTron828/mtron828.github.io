Chapter 591: Vendetta

With skin that was as fair as snow, and a sword that was as cold as frost, Piao Lingxue was the goddess in the current era of the entire Da Hong Immortal Sect within Yong Chang world.

The only one that could be compared with her was a female disciple from Yong Chang Immortal Sect.

It was not an overstatement to say that Piao Lingxue was the dream girl of all the disciples of Da Hong Immortal Sect.

Her prestige was on par with the top-ranking disciple, Hong Tianda.

Around Piao Lingxue stood the group of Mt. Xue’s female disciples, which consisted of the top twenty disciples like Yao Beibei, Feng Beiling...

All of them enjoyed a great reputation in the entire Da Hong Immortal Sect.

The appearance of Piao Lingxue and the female disciples of Mt. Xue drew the attention of all men as they observed them with glistening eyes.

Wang Xian looked over, revealing a smile on his face, as he saw all familiar faces.

“Senior brother Ao Shuwen is here too!”

“Senior brothers Ao Shuwen, Feng Haosi, Tong Xiuping, Ming Ziyu, Lin Xingjian are here!”

“They are ranked third, sixth, ninth, eleventh and fourteenth respectively. These five senior brothers were on very good terms with Senior brother Ao Shuwen as the lead. They are the ones who had the greatest strength in the entire Da Hong Immortal Sect!”

“All geniuses are always together. When will we have the chance to enter their circle?”

“Unless you can make it to the top twenty of the Da Hong Immortal Sect disciples, you can forget about entering their circle!”

At this time, exclamations of surprise kept coming with the arrival of those five disciples. The level of attention they got was not any less than Piao Lingxue or Hong Tianda.

That was because five of them were the young supreme talents of the Da Hong Immortal Sect.

“Hur? Another familiar face?”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes as a tinge of coolness flashed in his eyes while he peered at the quintet.

The five people before him were those five young men whom he had met at Saint Forge Workshop before.

Enemies are bound to meet.

Wang Xian took the teacup in front of him and took a sip without any expression.

Hong Tianda, Piao Lingxue, and the quintet took seats around them.

They possessed self-contempt as they looked nowhere, and sat down with cold arrogance.

“I did not expect her to be a proud goddess!”

Looking at Piao Lingxue, who appeared almost as a proud swan in the sky, Wang Xian could only give a faint smile.

Compared to the Piao Lingxue who he had known previously, the current one was more superior and aloof.

The spiritual tea session once again quieted down after the disciples walked in.

One by one, they sipped the tea, digested it, and converted it into energy.

Pak!

“Lengyan, watch your mouth!”

After about ten minutes, the sharp sound of the breaking of a tea set was heard along with the voice of Mentor Yu.

Everyone was startled as they looked ahead.

“Why, Qianmei? I can’t even talk about it? Hmph!”

Bam!

When everyone craned and looked up, they were shocked to see Mentor Yu and Lengyan engaging in a fight above their heads.

“Sigh, not again!”

Some of them sighed as several elders stood in the air, watching the two of them with helpless faces.

“The grudge between Mentor Yu and Mentor Leng will never be resolved for the rest of their entire lives!”

“How could it be resolved? Back then, Leng Aofeng killed Emperor Yu and the top-notch disciples of Mt. Fengyu with the use of unorthodox combat methods, including Level 13 Spiritual Equipment and an array. Even though Leng Aofeng had his limbs hacked off, he was only imprisoned for ten years because of God Leng. This grudge is not easy to resolve unless one of them is totally defeated!”

At this time, some of the disciples were whispering.

Wang Xian looked over and saw Yu Ling’er standing up in rage. Some of the disciples of Mt. Fengyu were also glowering at Lengyan in the sky with furious looks.

This was obviously not the first time that the surrounding disciples witnessed the fight between Mentor Yu and Mentor Leng.

“There were right and wrong back then. Leng Aofeng might be a descendant of God Leng, but Emperor Yu was, after all, the unofficial disciple of God Yin. He also felt guilty towards Emperor Yu. Hence, he would never let Mentor Yu and his daughter come into harm’s way!”

“Yes, such a grudge cannot be resolved. Luckily, they stop after each fight.”

Some of the surrounding disciples continued to exchange conversations in whispers.

Wang Xian was listening to the story that some of the disciples were talking about as he looked up to the sky. Both Mentor Yu and Lengyan were withholding a daunting sense of murderous intent.

However, the members of higher management of Da Hong Immortal Sect was watching, and thus, no one would get killed.

“Yu Qianmei, don’t assume that you have an extraordinary disciple in your mountain sect. Hmph. To me, he’s just a little worthless brat. Those outstanding disciples that Mt. Fengyu once had are gone by now!”

Lengyan’s sarcastic, cold voice came from the sky as she wanted to irritate Mentor Yu.

“If not for that despicable Leng Aofeng, how would Mt. Fengyu have come to such a state? Mt. Leng has only insidious villains!”

Mentor Yu’s voice in the sky was filled with killing intent as she confronted her.

“Hmph, it was obvious that Mt. Fengyu lost to us. Now you smeared our name by saying we’re despicable. How shameless!”

Suddenly, a scornful voice was heard not far away from Mt. Fengyu’s side.

“You...”

Upon hearing their words, Mt. Fengyu’s disciples immediately spun around with anger.

“What is it?”

Seeing the Mt. Fengyu disciples turning around to look at them, the disciples of Mt. Leng revealed sarcastic faces. “A bunch of trash from Mt. Fengyu. If you’re not convinced, we can go to the arena and cripple you guys!”

They glared at them disdainfully.

Mt. Leng was currently the third mountain sect in the ranking of Da Hong Immortal Sects. They had over two hundred disciples, which was ten times more than Mt. Fengyu.

“A few pieces of trash are not qualified to take part in a spiritual tea session!”

“Any disciples we pull from our mountain sect could easily annihilate the insignificant Mt. Fengyu!”

Several Mt. Leng disciples exuded a surge of domineering aura.

The group of Mt. Fengyu disciples paled instantly, revealing dreadful expressions.

Comparing the Inborn disciples of Mt. Fengyu and the lowest level, Half-Step to Dan Realm, of Mt. Leng...the difference was too huge.

It was not a fight within the same league.

“Senior brother Su Fa, that’s the so-called Dragon King!”

At this time, the almond-shaped-eyed girl beside a young man pointed at Wang Xian.

“Really? Dragon King? Hehe, I’ve long wanted to meet him in person!”

The young man by the name of Su Fa looked at Wang Xian before he swept his gaze across the Mt. Fengyu disciples. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Mt. Fengyu? Dragon King? They are just some trash that are not even worthy of carrying the shoes of Mt. Leng’s disciples.”

Su Fa sneered with a cold smile.

Since the mentors from Mt. Fengyu and Mt. Leng shared a vendetta, naturally, the disciples from the two mountain sects would not be on good terms.

But Mt. Fengyu was too weak to be compared with Mt. Leng. If not for that Dragon King, Mt. Fengyu would not have been ranked in the tenth position.

Disciples of Mt. Leng could not be bothered as they totally disregarded the opponent that looked like trash to them!
