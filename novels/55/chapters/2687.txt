2688 2088 Dragon Peak vs Tianya

“To block Tianya Chi’s attack, wishful thinking. When Tianya Chi goes all out, it’s no weaker than a pinnacle undying god King Warrior’s Attack!”

On Tianya Chi, Tianya sect master saw a thorny monster sweep towards Tianya Chi’s attack, his face revealing a cold expression.

“HMPH!”

In the sky, the sky horizon elder holding the axe slowly raised the axe in his hand and also released a terrifying attack.

“Splitting the heavens and earth!”

He roared softly, an earthen yellow energy instantly tore apart the space in a radius of 400-500 million km, this grey axe shaped energy slashed towards Dragon Peak.

Two Peak Undying God king level energies attacked.

“Not good, it’s hard for the Dragon Palace to defend!”

Seeing this scene, the warriors and disciples from the great sect from last month, who had rushed over from behind, were all shocked.

However against a peak undying emperor level attack, they were helpless.

“Rumble!”

However at this moment, the Thorn Monster’s Thorn had already landed on the energy of the world’s end ruler.

A terrifying collision sound rang out as boundless energy charged towards the surroundings.

“Eh? What!”

When the experts from the various factions saw this collision, they quickly cried out in alarm.

“He blocked it. How is this possible! ?”

The Heaven’s end sect master stood on the Heaven’s end ruler and stared straight ahead. His face also revealed a shocked expression.

Blocking it, the Thorn Monster’s attack actually blocked the sky horizon ruler’s attack.

Rumble

At this time, another terrifying clash resounded. In the air, the huge God Axe formed from the laws also slowly crumbled under the Thorn Monster’s attack.

“What!”

“Both attacks were blocked by the Dragon Palace, this is an attack from a pinnacle undying Emperor.”

“This...”

Around, the two ancestors, the rest of the Warriors, as well as the Warriors from the other forces saw this scene, their pupils dilated.

Blocking the attack of the world’s end ruler was already very surprising, but the attack of the world’s end ancestor was also blocked, this meant that the Dragon Palace could fight against a pinnacle undying fighter.

“HM? No wonder you dared to kill our world’s end elder. It turns out that your Dragon Palace also has a pinnacle undying fighter. No wonder.”

The expressions of the two world’s end patriarchs changed when they saw this scene.

“However, do you think that you can fight against US JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE PINNACLE undying fighter strength?”

“Kill!”

The unmoving pinnacle undying fighter’s face was filled with killing intent. A pagoda appeared in his hand. With a wave of his arm, the pagoda instantly released terrifying flames that expanded to millions of kilometers in size.

He flew above the pagoda, with a wave of his arm, the 1st level of the pagoda released many flame flowers, countless flame flowers covered an area of over 100 million km, blasting towards Dragon Peak.

Hua La La

At this time, the world margin sect’s Patriarch’s attacks, the three brambles immediately moved, meeting their attacks.

The brambles waved, similarly enveloping an area of over 100 million km ahead.

Two locked onto the two World Margin Sect’s patriarchs, one locked onto the world margin ruler.

“Rumble Rumble!”

Terrifying energy undulations, the vast war instantly erupted.

“Retreat, immediately retreat backwards.”

The surrounding powers, even the large sects, immediately retreated backwards.

The aftershocks of a pinnacle undying killing wasn’t something anyone could withstand.

“Ah Ah Ah Ah!”

At this time, a series of screams came from the surroundings. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

It was very sudden!

The screams made the hearts of the surrounding disciples tense.

Everyone was shocked, quickly looking towards the source of the scream, the left side of Dragon Peak.

“That is?”

“Not good, elder Mu!”

The Scream attracted many people’s attention, when the people from the world margin sect looked over, their expressions changed.

On the left side, elder Mu led a group of world margin disciples to block the arrows from Dragon Peak.

When Elder MU solemnly blocked an undying level 9 Archer’s arrow, a black and white silhouette appeared behind him.

The moment elder Mu unleashed his powerful attack, his sharp claws pierced into his body.

The scythe like claws even sliced off half of elder Mu’s head.

In the surroundings, there were also strange black and white creatures, using the same method to pierce through the warriors of the world margin sect.

...

An elder, 10 deacons, and 10,000 god King Warriors of the world margin great sect on the left.

“This is?”

When they saw this scene, be it the Warriors and disciples of the world margin, or nine heavens breaking moon and the other forces, they all felt troubled.

The war had just begun, and the Archers of the Dragon Palace were engaging in a few rounds of attacks with the disciples of the world margin.

However, all of a sudden, over 10,000 undying fighters were killed.

This terrifying scene shocked even the two patriarchs of Jiu Xiao.

“Howl!”

“Dragon Palace, you’re courting death!”

In front of them, when the two patriarchs saw the scene on the left, their eyes instantly turned blood red.

They let out bestial roars.

Over 10,000 undyings and an elder were killed in an instant, what did that mean?

...

There were only 80,000 to 90,000 undyings in the entire world, 1/89 of them had been killed.

Most importantly, another elder had been killed.

This was an undying level 9, a top warrior of the sect.

Including this elder, a total of 6 elders had died at the hands of the Dragon Palace.

More than one-third of the rank nine experts in the world.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Patriarch Horizon’s roar didn’t have any effect. In front of them, the Thorn Monster’s attack had already arrived.

“Break!”

Patriarch Horizon, who was holding the axe in his hands, raised the axe in his hands and slashed at the thorn in front of him.

“Bang!”

A terrifying collision sound was heard. In the next second, Patriarch Horizon, who was holding the axe, flew backward.

“How is this possible!”

He could not help but let out a low roar.

At the side, the Heaven’s end patriarch who was standing in the sky above the flaming pagoda was surrounded by thorns. The Flames landed on the thorns, but they did not break through their defense.

This...

His expression changed drastically. Suddenly, he had a bad premonition.

“All members of the Dragon Palace, Attack! Kill!”

When Wang Xian saw this scene, a cold look appeared in his eyes.

With a wave of his arm, the five elements millstone floated above the Dragon Peak and attacked all the strong disciples of the world margin sect who surrounded them.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

In the Dragon Peak, the rest of the Starwood Dragon species flew out instantly. The 60,000 immortal king powerhouses of the Dragon Palace all attacked!
