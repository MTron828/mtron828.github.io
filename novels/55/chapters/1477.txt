Chapter 1478: 1478 headed to the He clan

“I can’t believe that Lord Wang Xian is actually here to look for a girl!”

“It seems like Lord Wang Xian has a close relationship with that girl. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have found our vast region from the flowing sea region!”

“The Heartless Sword Dao sect is preparing to recruit disciples in ten days. Should we send some disciples over to participate in the assessment?”

At night, a group of forces came out of the Heartless Sword Dao sect and discussed in low voices.

Today’s banquet was beyond everyone’s expectations.

They had never expected that the invitation was only to ask them to help find a woman.

“After we go back tonight, we’ll immediately mobilize all our forces to find her!”

The leaders of the forces thought to themselves. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

They couldn’t slacken off just because the heartless sword path sect’s attitude was better.

On the contrary, they had to take to heart a terrifying faction that could destroy the towering sky sword sect in a short period of time.

If they could really help that Lord find her, it would be of great benefit to their entire faction.

After the various factions returned, they mobilized all their forces to start searching.

In a short period of time, every city within a thousand kilometer radius, and even the wilderness, was filled with people searching for a woman.

Even the portrait was pasted at the entrance of the city. Once someone discovered it, they would receive a terrifying reward.

This reward was comparable to the reward for completing the hiring of a diamond grade item.

Once there was a clue, they would also receive a huge reward.

This caused everyone within a thousand kilometers to go crazy. A grand search for Ling Jian ‘ER began.

One by one, the news spread to the location of the heartless sword sect.

Half a month later, Wang Xian sat in the lowest part of the ocean with a helpless look on his face. He looked at the information in front of him and sighed helplessly.

According to the information sent by the various major forces, Ling Jian ‘ER had indeed come to the vast area and appeared in the surroundings.

However, there was no one around now. After half a month of searching, the entire area could be said to have been dug three feet deep.

There were only two possibilities. One was that Ling Jian ‘er was in a sealed area, and the other was that she was no longer here!

Wang Xian closed his eyes and waited quietly.

Ling Jian ‘ER’s matter had become a worry in his heart. If he didn’t find her, he wouldn’t be able to sleep and eat in peace.

Time flew by and another half a month passed. He had been in the vast region for an entire month.

There was still no news after a month.

“Phew, I can’t wait any longer!”

Wang Xian exhaled. He stood on the peak and looked down.

There were now 100 more disciples below. These were the disciples recruited by the Heartless Sword Path sect.

Each one of them was outstanding, and a few golden swordfish taught them the heartless sword principle.

Of course, this heartless sword principle was not the complete version, but a very crude heartless sword principle.

The power of the heartless sword principle lay in the fact that when they fought, they were cold and heartless. They did not have seven emotions and six desires, but only fought against their enemies.

This made their understanding of heaven and earth, and the use and condensation of their sword techniques, more than ten times that of ordinary people.

In addition, they had tempered their sword heart, making it the strongest way of killing.

The Golden Swordfish and the rest mainly taught them how to control their emotions and desires. Although they could not reach the true level of heartless swordsmanship.

It could also greatly increase their attack power.

“Ao Jian, ao Yao!”

Wang Xian flew down from the peak and said to the people below.

“I’m Here!”

Two figures appeared in front of Wang Xian and bowed respectfully.

“I’ll leave the matters here to you guys. I have to go somewhere else. I Won’t be back anytime soon!”

Wang Xian said to them, “I’ll leave the matters here to you guys and the two civil officials!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The two of them nodded.

Wang Xian didn’t say anything more. He flew out of the Heartless Sword Dao sect and headed east.

He was very relieved to leave the matters here to Ao Jianao and the two civil officials.

They knew what to do next.

They flew east and soon, a piece of land appeared in front of them. Wang Xian took out a map and looked at the information on it.

“The He clan is located in the ancient wood forest. They are 500,000 kilometers away from here. Even if they fly at full speed without rest, it would take them 20 days.”

“With the strength of the He clan, apart from the three superpowers, they have people in other places. If I ask them to help me find them, it would be much better than looking for them myself!”

Wang Xian looked at the map and continued to fly towards the east.

The entire vast area was too huge. If he were to search slowly, he might not be able to find it in his lifetime.

It was much better to have the help of the He clan than to search by himself.

As Wang Xian spoke, he increased his speed and flew at a high speed.

After flying for more than a thousand kilometers, they entered the vast wilderness.

Compared to the flowing sea region, the wilderness in the vast area was more dangerous.

The strength of the wild beasts was very high, and each of the void interpretation level beasts occupied a territory.

The resources in the vast sea region were incomparable to those in the flowing sea region.

For example, within a radius of 1,000 kilometers around the heartless sword path sect, there were two relatively famous territories.

There, one could obtain treasures that were useful for cultivation, and their value was not lower than transcendent level 7 or 8 pills, or even higher.

The trees in the entire vast area were also taller. Giant trees that were five to six hundred meters tall could be seen everywhere.

There were fewer humans in the wild. Even though Wang Xian was ten thousand meters high in the sky, no one could see him.

In order to make time, Wang Xian did not stop halfway. He used all of his time to travel.

After more than ten days, he had already traveled more than three hundred thousand kilometers. In front of him was a city belonging to the subsidiary forces of the He clan. Wang Xian did not hesitate and flew straight there.

“There are airships heading to the ancient wood forest in the subsidiary forces of the He clan. Riding on the airships will help me avoid detours!”

Wang Xian thought for a moment and came to the city gate. He walked straight into the city.

The airships originated from a legendary God of the nine gods empire. It was an item created by a formation.

Large airships could carry thousands of people while small ones could carry hundreds of people.

The value of airships was very high. Fortunately, the airships would be guarded by strong people to prevent attacks from demonic beasts and ferocious beasts.

In the vast region, most people would choose airships when traveling at a distance.

It was safe and the speed was not slow.

Wang Xian came to the only seat in the city that was taking the airships. He paid a generous sum of spirit stones and waited at the side.

Just like the airplanes on Earth, the airship had a fixed time to take off.

“I really didn’t expect that young master he’s birthday party would be so big this time. He invited all the heaven’s favored disciples of the He clan and all the subsidiary forces of the He clan.”

“I heard that it was young master he who organized it to celebrate his birthday and his cultivation to the second level of the Profound Void Stage!”

At this moment, a voice that piqued Wang Xian’s interest came from a seat not far away.
