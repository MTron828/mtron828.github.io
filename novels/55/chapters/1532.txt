Chapter 1533: Who the hell is the son of Light? Get Down

On the fourth floor of the Holy Medicine Clinic, the group of people who were treating Wang Xian heard the sound coming from outside. When they saw the cold expression on Wang Xian’s face, they were slightly shocked and quickly looked behind them.

At the entrance, the receptionist girl rolled down the stairs and stopped. Her face was filled with fear.

She stared at the group of young men and women in front of her with fear.

However, the group of people did not even look at her as they walked inside.

The Prince of light held the staff of light in his hand. His white clothes were full of holiness and pride.

He looked like the son of heaven as he scanned the room on the fourth floor. The corner of his mouth curled up slightly as he walked inside.

He completely ignored the astonished expressions of everyone in the room.

“Who is pastor Wang?”

The son of light prince swept his gaze across the people in the room. His gaze landed on Wang Xian and a faint smile appeared on his face.

“Son of light!”

In the room, the 20 people who were treating the illness were shocked. They didn’t dare to look at them directly.

When Old Hu saw them, he was also slightly shocked. He revealed a nervous expression on his face.

“My lord son of Light, May I know why you are here to look for Reverend Wang?”

Old Hu saw the cold expression on the son of Light’s face. He quickly walked out carefully and said respectfully to them.

“You must be that Reverend Wang!”

The Prince of the son of light completely ignored old Hu. He looked straight at Wang Xian who was sitting behind him and asked indifferently.

“What are you guys here for?”

Wang Xian stood up and looked at the son of light and the rest with displeasure. He asked coldly.

“Kid, be careful of your identity when you speak to our Prince!”

A lady’s thin lips curled up slightly as she warned Wang Xian.

“He is indeed a very arrogant fellow. Does he think that he is powerful just because he is known as a benevolent person?”

The Prince of light raised the staff in his hand and gestured to the person behind him. He sized up Wang Xian indifferently.

“Push our receptionist down the stairs and give me an explanation!”

Wang Xian glared at the Prince of Light and asked with a frosty expression. He completely ignored the question he had just asked.

Old Hu, who was at the side, revealed a bitter smile. The person in front of him was the son of light!

If a prince of the Divine Light Empire offended this person, how would he be able to survive in the world of radiant priests in the future?

Radiant priests originated from the Divine Light Empire.

It was not an exaggeration to say that a single sentence from the Divine Light Empire could seal Wang Xian’s life.

They could even kill him in secret.

“Why?”

When the son of light prince heard that Wang Xian did not care about him at all and even questioned him, his face instantly turned gloomy.

“I heard that priest Wang’s art of light is powerful. I am prepared to come here today to learn from you. Since you are not giving me face, don’t blame me for not giving you face!”

As he spoke, he slowly raised the scepter in his hand.

“On the path of the priest of light, I, Tian Qingguang, am the son of light. In the same generation, other than the daughter of light, everyone else is trash in my eyes. Today, I will use my art of light to teach you a lesson!”

“I will also let you know that you should not be arrogant and know your place!”

As the son of Light, Tian Qingguang, spoke, he raised his head slightly and pointed at Wang Xian.

“Hand of divine light!”

He shouted softly. The Hand of divine light, a dharma idol of the first level of the void interpretation stage, emitted an incomparably resplendent light power and pointed it at Wang Xian.

“The son of light actually wants to challenge priest Wang. This... is over!”

When the people who came to see the son of light, Tian Qingguang, made his move, their expressions became extremely ugly.

The Shadow of a man’s famous tree!

The title of son of light and daughter of light wasn’t something that could be casually called.

It was conferred by the most powerful radiant priest of the current radiant priest, the Patriarch of the Divine Light Dynasty.

Those who could be called the son of light were extremely powerful existences in the entire radiant priest generation, not to mention in the same generation.

Although priest Wang was very famous, he was still far from being called the son of light.

They lowered their heads helplessly. Even if they were displeased with this son of light, they didn’t dare to make a sound.

“Teach me a lesson?”

Wang Xian looked at the hand of divine light that was attacking him. His eyes revealed a hint of coldness.

The three people who came yesterday also wanted to teach him a lesson. Their statuses were much higher than this son of light. However, they still fled dejectedly.

“In the future, I will definitely let you see me and kneel down respectfully!”

The son of light, Tian Qingguang, stared at Wang Xian arrogantly. The Hand of divine light that he was controlling shone brightly.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian looked at the hand of divine light and laughed coldly.

His voice was directed at the hand of divine light that was only one meter away from him.

The entire hand of divine light collapsed and dissipated in an instant.

“Crash!”

At this moment, the curtains on the balcony behind Wang Xian were opened.

He extended his hand slowly and clenched it in the air toward the son of light, Tian Qingguang, and the people behind him!

“Buzz!”

One by one, the hands of light appeared directly on their necks.

“What?”

The son of Light, Tian Qingguang, was slightly shocked. He looked at the hand of light that was grabbing his neck with a face full of astonishment.

The group of young men and women behind him were also shocked. Horror appeared on their faces.

“Who does the son of light think he is?”

Wang Xian waved his arm slightly behind him. The hand of light grabbed their necks tightly and threw them out of the window.

“Break!”

Tian qingguang, the son of light, was horrified. The light on his body grew brighter. One by one, the protective armor and formation protecting his body were activated.

However, what shocked him was that the level four or five void interpretation spell formations on his body had no effect on the light palm on his neck.

In an instant, he felt the wind blowing on his face. He widened his eyes and saw that the person controlling his body was falling heavily down the stairs!

“How is this possible?”

He could not believe it. Both of his hands were desperately striking the light palm on his body.

“Bang Bang Bang!”

However, at this moment, the palm brought their bodies and slammed them heavily onto the ground. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The powerful impact caused the son of light, Tian Qingguang, to spit out blood.

“Ah Ah!”

Beside him, another group of young men and women also spat out blood. Their faces were pale.

“What son of Light, daughter of Light? In My Eyes, she’s trash. Don’t come looking for trouble in the future. Otherwise, it won’t be so simple!”

At this moment, a deep voice came from above.

When the son of light, Tian Qingguang, who was lying on the ground, heard this, his face changed drastically. His face turned from green to white!

In the surrounding area, there were thousands of people lining up in the Holy Medicine Clinic, as well as a group of passers-by.

When they saw the young man and woman who were lying on the ground in a sorry state and heard the voice from above, they were completely stunned.

“My God, what’s going on? What happened to the son of light just now? How did he get thrown down?”
