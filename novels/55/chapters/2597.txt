2598 2598’s indestructible defense

“The six forces have gathered in the sky above the dragon star and are preparing to attack the Dragon Star. The Dragon Star is doomed!”

“What? The six forces have gathered on the Dragon Star? Why... why is there no news from the brain? It seems that they want to wipe out the dragon palace in one fell swoop!”

“The Dragon Palace sent people to the ninth-grade sky sect and the Sky Mountain Sword Sect’s planets to kill wantonly. The two forces are completely furious and want to destroy the Dragon Palace!”

“It’s over. The Dragon Palace is doomed. The Dragon King is courting death. He offended a ninth-grade sky sect and the Sky Mountain Sword sect!”

“Which force can resist the joint attack of the two forces?”

Hundreds of people on the Dragon Star hadn’t escaped yet for various reasons. When they saw the six forces gathering above the Dragon Star and preparing to attack, they immediately fled through the teleportation formation!

Very quickly, news of the 6 powers attacking the planet spread throughout the entire AI!

This time, everyone could see that the 6 powers had hidden the news and used a very secret method to enter the surroundings of the planet. They wanted to capture the entire Dragon Palace in one go!

This caused the entire star South Galaxy to shake. However, it was a pity that they didn’t know the exact situation on the planet!

“Break for this blade emperor!”

“Break for me!”

“Break break break!”

At the same time, above Dragon Star, Blade Emperor and his group of Undying Level 7 warriors immediately flew into the sky!

Their powerful god weapons, their bodies filled with terrifying law energy!

Around him, space itself was torn apart!

Terrifying attacks headed straight for Dragon Star!

The attacks of the 9 undying emperors tore a terrifying crack in the space!

“Piercing Star Sword, Pierce!”

Below, a Sky Mountain Sword sect warrior roared, his hand landing heavily on the piercing star sword!

“Weng Weng Weng!”

The piercing star sword trembled, similarly piercing forward at a terrifying speed, as though it wanted to tear everything apart!

“Attack!”

The star vultures in the surroundings roared, and the storm of laws charged forward!

All the archers above drew their bowstrings and instantly pierced through the void, falling toward the dragon star in front of them!

The dense, vast, and even terrifying attacks covered the entire world in front of them!

This scene was even more terrifying than the arrival of the Apocalypse!

With such an attack, a star could instantly turn into dust!

“Hahaha, I want to see how your array formation can withstand such an attack!”

The sect master of the Three Seas sect roared with a savage expression!

Boundless, terrifying nomological might shot forward, blotting out the sky and covering the sun!

“Hiss, can this... be withstood?”

“How... how can this attack be withstood! ?”

The disciples of the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom on the nine planets of the Dragon Star turned pale when they saw the terrifying attack in front of them. Some of the heavenly demons even showed a hint of despair in their hearts!

This attack was simply impossible to withstand!

“This attack is still not enough!”

The Heavenly Array Formation stood in the sky above a planet and calmly faced the attack that covered a radius of billions of kilometers in front of him!

“Weng!”

He took out the formation compass and moved it lightly!

The sound of wind blowing leaves could be heard in the surrounding void. A towering tree instantly appeared in the void, its enormous branches and leaves enveloping the entire world!

The towering tree seemed to be corporeal, protecting an area!

“Humph!”

The group of ninth grade Sky sect experts from the Sky Mountain Sword sect snorted coldly when they saw the appearance of the towering tree!

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

In the next moment, countless attacks landed on the tree, causing it to tremble slightly!

“This... It’s blocked! This array formation actually blocked it!”

Below, when the disciples of the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom saw that all the attacks were blocked outside, their faces were filled with shock!

“What?”

“How is this possible!”

Above them, the experts of the ninth-grade Heaven’s sect, Tianshan Sword sect, saw that their attacks were slowly dissipating. When they saw that the towering tree did not change at all, their faces were filled with shock and embarrassment!

The full-strength attack of millions of them was actually unable to break through!

This made them feel that it was somewhat inconceivable!

“Continue to attack!”

When the sword king saw that the attack was blocked and saw that the star-piercing sword was in front of the towering tree, his expression changed as he roared loudly!

...

“Continue to attack!”

The experts from the ninth grade heavenly sect also roared with a solemn expression! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Last time, they had already witnessed the powerful defense of this dragon star. However, this time, the attack power had increased by several times and was unable to break through. This caused them to have a bad premonition in their hearts!

However, they did not give up!

The formation needed to expend a huge amount of energy to block their attacks!

Not being able to break through once did not mean that they would not be able to break through the second and third time!

“Attack!”

“Boom Boom Boom!”

In the next moment, another terrifying attack that blotted out the sky and covered the Sun struck forward!

A violent sound rang out, but there was not the slightest change from the previous time!

The towering tree shook, not a single crack appeared, all the attacks were blocked once again!

...

“Continue!”

The three seas sect leader gritted his teeth and his expression was savage, “I don’t believe that they can withstand our dozens or hundreds of attacks!”!

“Rumble Rumble Rumble!”

After he roared, he unleashed all of his strength, his laws condensed into a sword and continued to attack the Dragon Star!

“Rumble Rumble Rumble!”

Following which, continuous sounds rang out. Undying Level 7 warriors attacked one after another, but the towering tree still didn’t have a single crack!

“Attack one point at a Time!”

Two minutes later, an undying Level 7 ancestor roared coldly, waving his arm, his law energy condensed into a spear, attacking forward!

Beside him, the other 8 undying level 7 warriors also condensed their law energy into long spears, attacking a spot!

“Peng Peng Peng Peng!”

The sounds of collision resounded, cracks appeared on the spots that were attacked!

“Damn it, to break a spot, at least a dozen undying level 7 warriors would have to attack a spot at the same time!”

Seeing the cracks quickly recovering, the Warriors from the Ninth Grade Sky Mountain Sword sect had ugly expressions!

Millions of them rushed over, vowing to destroy everyone in the Dragon Palace, to make their blood flow for hundreds of millions of miles!

In the end, they couldn’t even break through the opponent’s defense!

This...

Was simply a slap in the face!

“No need to attack anymore, it’s useless!”

The group of undying god King Level 7 warriors noticed this problem and ordered the surrounding disciples with dark expressions!

“What defense is this, how can it be so strong!”

“This defense is too terrifying, there are so many of us attacking, yet it’s completely useless!”

Looking at the defense in front, the group of undyings all opened their mouths slightly, their faces filled with shock!

So many warriors, yet they couldn’t break through the opponent’s defense!

Then how could they destroy the opponent?
