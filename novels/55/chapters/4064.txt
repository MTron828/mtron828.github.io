Chapter 4065 - 4065: The fate of the 4064 Dragon Palace!

Translator: 549690339

As long as it wasn’t a war between the peak races, it wouldn’t disturb the Heavenly Yuan creation-level powerhouses.

Although the battle between the Dragon Palace, the Phoenix clan, and the Angel clan was so fierce.

In fact, even the heavenly yuan creation-level powerhouses of the Phoenix clan and the Angel clan didn’t know about this.

This was because their war was fought in the starry universe.

Moreover, other than the accidental deaths of two peak ruler realm experts, there weren’t many casualties among the top experts of the Phoenix clan and

Angel clan.

Therefore, none of the heavenly yuan fortunes knew about this.

“Oh? The Divine Dragon clan was extremely powerful back then, but for some reason, they perished together with the insect clan. Now, they’ve actually risen so quickly. They really have a deep trump card! ”

When the Hetian Saint heard this, he also sighed.

The Divine Dragon Clan had been born several eons earlier than the saint clan!

The Saint clan had only risen after the last calamity!

At their peak, the Divine Dragon clan was much stronger than the saint clan.

“Although the Divine Dragon Clan has perished, Shuiyun must have made some arrangements before the divine dragon clan was annihilated. It’s impossible for the Divine Dragon clan to completely extinguish their heritage. This newly risen dragon palace is not weak. ”

In the sky, the Elven empress spoke up!

Wang Xian had been to the Elven clan’s lair. She had met him before.

She was very appreciative of Wang Xian.

In addition, the relationship between the Divine Dragon Clan and the Elf clan was pretty good. Therefore, the relationship between the Elf clan and the Dragon Palace was pretty good.

“Oh? In just a few hundred million years, the strength of the Dragon Palace is pretty good?”

On the side, the Emperor of the Phoenix clan, the heavenly creation-level fire Phoenix, raised his eyebrows and asked.

“Emperor of the Phoenix clan, the power of the Dragon Palace is not weak. According to our understanding, there should be 200,000 to 300,000 disciples who are masters of the universe. Although their realms are not high, they have great potential! ”

The Elven queen cupped her hands and reported.

“Oh? Their strength is not bad. When the Apocalypse comes in the future, they will be quite powerful! ”

The Black Tortoise clan’s heavenly creation said.

“The Apocalypse is coming. Our nine-origin universe should not engage in internal strife. It is time to calm down and prepare for the Apocalypse. ”

The Elven empress spoke as she looked at the other heavenly fate experts!

“Elven empress, that Dragon Palace killed a peak-stage ruler of our Phoenix race. He also killed tens of thousands of pure-blooded phoenixes. Our Phoenix race can not afford not to take revenge! ”

Below, the Fire Phoenix King of the Phoenix race cupped his hands and replied to the elven empress!

“That’s right, Lady Elven empress. The peak-stage overlord of our Angel clan was also killed by that Wang Immortal. A large number of our angels were massacred by him. Furthermore, he drove us out of the starry universe and caused us to suffer heavy losses. Our Angel clan will seek revenge for this.

Please understand, Lady Elven Empress! ”

On the side of the Angel clan, the Radiant Angel King cupped his hands and spoke to the elven empress!

As they spoke, the eyes of the Emperor of angels and the Emperor of Phoenixes shifted slightly!

“There is no hatred that can not be resolved! ”

The Hetian saint looked at them and frowned slightly. He said, “We are all beings from the nine-origin universe. Our only target is enemies from other universes!”

“How about this? Let the Dragon Palace expert who killed our Angel race pay with his life and give him some compensation. This matter will be over! ” The Emperor of angels glanced at his own disciple and spoke!

He didn’t care too much about the enmity between the Angel clan and the Dragon Palace.

Let the Dragon Palace pay a price and this matter can be resolved!

“Let me say, there is a very simple way. It is a good choice to use all the divine dragons of the Dragon Palace as mounts. ”

The Phoenix Emperor’s eyes flashed with a cold light as he spoke!

He knew more than anyone else about the destruction of the Divine Dragon Clan!

Someone had obtained the inheritance of the divine dragon, so this grudge might continue.

He didn’t allow this to happen.

However, there were seven other heaven origin creation existences around, so he couldn’t directly act.

“The Divine Dragon Race is a top-tier race in our nine-origin universe, after all. Shuiyun once fought alongside us.”

The elder from the demon race said.

He was obviously refuting the Emperor of the Phoenix!

Shuiyun was an old-fashioned heaven origin creation after all.

These old-fashioned heaven origin creations had fought together during the calamity for the nine-origin universe.

Although they had fallen, there was still some friendship!

Some of the heavenly yuan fortunes wouldn’t allow the Dragon Palace’s divine dragon to be reduced to a mount!

“Then kill all the disciples of the Dragon Palace who killed the Phoenix clan and the Angel clan. Also, after the calamity, the disciples of the Dragon Palace will be the first line of Defense! ”

The emperor of the Phoenix said directly.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Yes, there will be a price to pay. The lives of the disciples of the Angel clan are also lives! ”

As soon as the emperor of the Phoenix said that, the emperor of the Angels nodded in agreement!

Their words made the other six heavenly Yuan creation realm powerhouses

frown slightly. However, they didn’t refute!

That was the best they could do!

After all, the heaven origin creation realm of the Divine Dragon Clan had already fallen.

The Heaven origin creation realm of the Phoenix clan and the Angel clan still existed.

It would not be good for them to directly offend the Phoenix clan and the Angel clan for the sake of the Divine Dragon Clan!

It was not worth it!

Especially since the upcoming calamity was about to erupt. At this time, the Peace of the nine origin universe was even more important!

The decision of the two heaven origin creation realm experts.

Below them, all the disciples were shocked when they heard what they said!

“Doesn’t this mean that the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is going to be sentenced to death?”

“Absolutely. The decision of the two Heavenly Yuan creators of the Phoenix clan and the Angel clan is to announce the death penalty for the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace! ”

“The other Heavenly Yuan creators have already spoken for the Dragon Palace, but they can’t completely offend the Phoenix clan and the Angel clan. The Dragon King and the others are completely finished!”

“The Dragon Palace is currently hiding somewhere. Can they find the Dragon Palace? Perhaps the Dragon Palace is already in the starry universe! ”

“Now, the Dragon King is completely finished. Both the Angel and Phoenix clans have Heavenly Yuan creator realm experts. For such a terrifying existence to not destroy the Dragon Palace is already a great fortune for the Dragon Palace! ”

Below, all the strong disciples heard the decision of the two strong cultivators in the Heavenly Yuan Destiny Realm.

Hearing their conversation, their faces were full of shock..
