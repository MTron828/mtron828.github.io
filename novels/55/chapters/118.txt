Chapter 119: Devil Flowers

“Dragon King!”

Wang Xian stood on the summit of a mountain in the dark and gloomy sea. He was pleased with the bunch of Devil Monkeys before him.

Roving Heavens knelt in the center while holding onto his unknown metal rod.

The rod was so hard that it was beyond Wang Xian’s imagination. During the combat just now, Wang Xian’s claw and Dragon Ball did not do any harm to it at all.

Divine Dragons did not need to fight with celestial weapons. The only celestial weapon that he had was the Dragon Ball.

Hence, Divine Dragons did not know how to make weapons. But in the list of Dragon Palace’s constructing materials, there was a pillar known as the Dinghai Divine Rod.

Dinghai Divine Rod not only made a strong pillar, but it could also be used as a weapon.

When Roving Heavens refined the rod in his hand to Dinghai Divine Rod, his combat power would be extremely domineering in the future.

Wang Xian could already imagine the imposing fighting demeanor of a Devil Monkey blazing in devilish flames with a Dinghai Divine Rod.

Behind Roving Heavens stood a bunch of Devil Monkeys. Among these monkeys, there was only one Level-nine, which is the highest level among all. The rest were level eight and below, while most of them were level five.

There was a total number of 800 monkeys.

All the Devil Monkeys bowed on the seafloor respectfully as they worshipped their new king.

The Devil Monkeys were born with intelligence. As they cultivated, their intelligence would improve. Wang Xian did not need to activate their Spiritual Intelligence at all.

He swung his arm and drops of blood essence entered the Devil Monkeys. Subsequently, he imparted the Divine Dragon Transformation to all the monkeys.

Consuming more than 800 drops of blood essence in one go had no impact on Wang Xian.

Blood essence was related to Dragon Energy. He could use Dragon Energy to restore his blood essence.

“Thank you, Dragon King!”

The bunch of Devil Monkeys thanked him in synchronized voices.

“Roving Heavens, you’ll lead them from now on. Get them to do their cultivation and listen to your orders. All of you will be part of the first division, Devil Division of the Dragon Palace!” said Wang Xian to Roving Heavens.

“Yes, Dragon King,” everyone replied loudly.

“Let’s go. Follow me for a search of the nearby waters. We need to find sunken boats and a variety of resources!” Wang Xian said to them.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian took the lead and swam ahead with Roving Girl and Roving Lobster beside him. Prime Minister Turtle was swimming at the bottom of the sea while Roving Heavens, with a few subordinates, were following behind Wang Xian.

Compared to the time when they had just came, they had undoubtedly built up a massive lineup.

Wang Xian had many followers after subduing the Devil Monkeys, but there was one weakness.

Most of the Devil Monkeys were moving too slowly and could not keep up with their speed.

Wang Xian could only slow down the speed without much choice.

The ocean was vast, magnificent, and extremely mysterious.

Occupying 70 percent of the Earth, humans had yet to explore many regions of the ocean.

The terrain of the ocean was much more complicated than the land. Some areas were covered by seaweed, some were barren and desolate. Some had towering seamounts on the bed of the ocean.

Wang Xian stormed the ocean with a group of subordinates. In the shallow waters, all the marine animals fled in fright when they met them.

“There is a Chinese Bahaba fish ahead. Seize it!”

He commanded those at the back. As they wandered around in the sea, Wang Xian was observing the surroundings before he saw a meter-long Chinese Bahaba fish.

A Devil Monkey lurched as it seized the Chinese Bahaba fish.

The Devil Monkeys could leap as far as eight meters in the sea. Hence, their speed was much faster than ordinary fish. The Devil Monkey caught the Chinese Bahaba fish easily and returned.

Dozens of Devil Monkeys caught Chinese Bahaba fish, Giant Yellow Croaker and other precious fish. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian was catching the fish conveniently to replenish the top-quality ingredients in the First-grade Restaurant.

“Dragon King, there’s a sinking ship ahead!”

At this time, a Devil Monkey who was running all over the place reported to Wang Xian.

“A sinking ship?” Wang Xian’s eyes gleamed with excitement. “Let’s go over there.”

A sinking ship was the biggest treasure in the ocean.

According to records, the gold and silver found in the sea were enough to buy over a developed country.

The treasure in the ocean was beyond anyone’s imagination.

With a jerk, Wang Xian swam rapidly to the sinking ship.

“Sure enough!”

After he swam for about 2,000 meters, a sinking ship came into his sight. It was a modern ship.

The ship was about 30-meters long with the front and back of the ship separated in different directions. The center portion of the vessel was covered in sludge.

Wang Xian observed the sinking ship, and he was slightly disappointed.

The ship was too small to cross the ocean; likely to be a fishing boat.

Wang Xian exhaled a dull-yellow dragon breath, revealing the entire ship buried under the earth.

“Hur?”

When Wang Xian looked over, he spotted some chests in the ship. He opened immediately.

“Gold. It’s gold! Five chests of golds!”

Wang Xian’s eyes gleamed as he saw the shining gold.

“We found a ton of gold, ten tons of steel. Do we collect them for the construction of the Dragon Palace?”

“Eh...”

Wang Xian was looking bitter on his face. A ton of gold was worth more than 300 million. If he sold them away, he would instantly become a billionaire.

Besides, these golds were more or less one percent of what he required for constructing the Dragon Palace.

“Collect them!”

Wang Xian made a decision, and the gold, even the steel on the vessel before him disappeared. Only some wood structures were left.

“Sigh!”

Wang Xian shook his head and continued hunting in the ocean.

If he persisted, the Bohai Sea was too shallow. Wang Xian was considering whether to proceed to other water regions.

As they went deeper into the sea, more fantastic living creatures and treasures could be found.

But the sea was too vast. It would be a waste of time if he continued to search. He thought he could send the Devil Monkeys to explore the ocean for resources when the Devil Monkeys hit level ten.

“Dragon King, there’s an aqua plant forest ahead. It’s very magical and beautiful!” said Roving Girl, pointing one direction after traveling for half an hour.

Wang Xian looked over. A huge and magical underwater region was seen on the right.

The entire underwater region was in a myriad of colors, full of fantasy just like how it was on TV and in movies.

Many jellyfish were floating around, giving off all kinds of radiances.

“The underwater wonderland!”

This was the first time Wang Xian had encountered such a beautiful underwater world with various coral reefs and aquatic plants that exuded different radiances.

“Let’s check it out!”

Wang Xian swam over with a group of subordinates behind him.

“We must make our Dragon Palace look as beautiful as this place in the future!”

Wang Xian swam over and observed the surroundings. Some of the jellyfish gave way to them when they sensed the imposing aura from them.

The surrounding plants gently swayed, looking beautiful at the bottom of the sea.

“Hur? What’s that?”

At this time, a pure red coral drew his attention as he looked ahead.

Blood coral, the world’s most precious gemstone, worth more than diamonds.

That blood coral was worth over tens of millions or even hundreds of millions.

The blood coral was located on top of a reef, looking beautiful with a few flowers of a size of one meter surrounding it.

Wang Xian swam next to the blood coral. He was full of surprise as he reached out to grab the blood coral.

Just then, the bright-colored flower below him suddenly moved!
