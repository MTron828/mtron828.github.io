3378 In the midst of the shock of the 2277 thunder race disciples

Crack! Crack

Within the Thunder Clouds, a dense thunder net was located in the surroundings. Twenty-four thunder horses were guarding a fruit.

The Thunder race disciples immediately surrounded and attacked.

Wang Xian stood at the back. With a wave of his arm, five Thunder Dragons flew forward.

The speed of the Thunder Dragons was very fast. It was no slower than third senior sister’s speed!

They were divided into five directions and surrounded the group of thunder horses.

Behind them, there were a large number of thunder chains.

When the chains collided with each other, a clattering sound was produced.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

When the disciples of the Thunder Race rushed over, the group of thunder horses noticed them instantly. They stood up and stared at them coldly.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

Roars came out from the Heavenly Thunder Horses’mouths as bolts of lightning struck towards them.

“Thunder Light!”

When third senior sister saw that the group of Heavenly Thunder Horses didn’t escape, she immediately released her law projection and rushed towards the Heavenly Thunder horses at the fastest speed.

“Roar Roar!”

However, when the group of Heavenly Thunder Horses saw that third senior sister had directly broken through their attack, the leading Heavenly Thunder Horse raised its head and let out a low roar, ordering its companions to immediately flee.

“Roar!”

The group of thunder horses did not hesitate and immediately fled.

“Roar! Roar!”

However, at this time, three Thunder Dragons had already arrived behind them. Their tails carried the thunder chains and directly attacked them.

“Roar! Roar!”

The two thunder horses with the Combat Power of Level 6 universe knights roared. Their pair of Thunder Wings released powerful Thunder Energy and directly attacked the Thunder Dragons.

“Crash!”

“Roar! Roar!”

The two thunder horses let out a terrified roar. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The surrounding thunder horses saw it and fled in a frenzy!

“Control!”

At this moment, the Thunder wings on Wang Xian’s back flashed with lightning. The Five Thunder Dragons released streaks of lightning and attacked all the Thunder horses.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The lightning landed on the Thunder horses and numbed them instantly.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The Thunder Dragons roared and chains were sent towards the Thunder horses.

“Roar! Roar!”

The Thunder Horses wanted to escape but were completely restrained by the lightning chains.

Twenty Thunder horses were all restrained.

“This…”

All the disciples were shocked when they saw this scene. They looked at all the Thunder horses that were suppressed in disbelief.

Twenty-four thunder horses were suppressed just like that?

They hadn’t even gotten close yet!

“Senior brother Wang Xian’s strength is definitely not only at level six of the Universe Knights!”

A middle-aged man opened his mouth and said with a face full of shock.

Crash

At this moment, Wang Xian pulled his arm and all the Thunder Dragons flew back. The Thunder horses that were restrained also flew over.

“Alright, you guys suppress them!”

Wang Xian said to the shocked disciples of the Thunder Ray race with a smile.

“Wow, senior brother Wang Xian, you are too powerful.”

At the side, Lei Zhengyun exclaimed in surprise.

“Wang Xian, you… you have a breakthrough in your strength?”

Third senior sister flew over and stared at him in shock.

How Old was Wang Xian Now? He already possessed such terrifying strength.

He could easily suppress a group of heavenly thunder horses. This strength was definitely the combat strength of a level seven universe knight.

“Yes, the first elder gave those thunder feathers to me, which improved my strength.”

Wang Xian nodded. There was nothing to hide.

“Oh my God, you made a breakthrough again? Among the disciples of our Thunder Ray race, the only ones with the combat strength of A Level Seven Universe Knight are eldest senior brother, second senior brother, and third senior sister!”

Lei Zhengyun widened his eyes and stared at Wang Xian in disbelief.

The combat strength of a universe knight at level seven could be ranked in the top four among the disciples of the Thunder Ray race.

“Is this the talent of the Divine Dragon? It’s too heaven-defying!”

A girl murmured.

“Even the disciples of the peak races are not so heaven-defying, right? It’s because senior brother Wang Xian is too powerful. He might be able to become an existence at the level of the universe’s ruler in the future!”

Senior brother Ying Sighed.

“Wang Xian, your strength might not be weaker than mine now. Let’s have a spar when we return. If you win, you will be our third senior brother!”

Third senior sister looked at Wang Xian and said with a face full of shock.

Wang Xian smiled and didn’t mind. “You guys should suppress these heavenly thunder horses.”

“This… If senior brother Wang Xian doesn’t want them, we will bring them back to the clan and let the elders deal with them. The elders will also remember your contribution!”

A middle-aged man said.

The rest of the people nodded in agreement.

“Up to you!”

Wang Xian said casually.

“Quick, quick, Haha. With senior brother Wang Xian around this time, we have gained too much.”

The group of disciples said excitedly.

“Suppress these heavenly thunder horses well. We will return after searching for a few months!”

Third senior sister said with a smile.

“Haha, Alright. With senior brother Wang Xian around, we will definitely have a great harvest!”

“That’s right, that’s right. Senior brother Wang Xian is simply too amazing!”

The disciples said in a good mood.

After suppressing the Heavenly Thunder horses, the group of disciples kept them and continued searching.

In the next two months, their luck was not good. They only encountered four desolate beasts and were all easily suppressed by Wang Xian.

This made the disciples realize that their senior brother Wang Xian’s lightning speed was slightly faster than third senior sister’s.

There was a high possibility that senior brother Wang Xian’s strength was slightly stronger than third senior sister’s.

“Alright, we have gained enough this time. Let’s go back.”

Two months later, third senior sister said to them.

“Alright!”

Although the disciples wanted more, they didn’t reject her. After all, this time, it was all Wang Xian’s credit. They didn’t want to trouble him for too long!

“Senior brother Wang Xian, are you going back too?”

Lei Zhengyun asked Wang Xian.

“Yes, let’s go back!”

Wang Xian nodded. Over the past two months, he had been following them and honing his thunder technique. He was about to reach the peak.

His strength would soon be comparable to a peak universe knight.

“Alright, let’s go then!”

Third senior sister nodded. With a wave of his arm, a thunder mirror appeared under his body and enlarged. The rest of the disciples immediately flew over.

Wang Xian also stood on it.

The distance was not short. They had flown a long distance during this period of time. It would take them more than two months to return to the Lightning race.

They did not return to their own divine kingdom in an instant because they could try to capture dire beasts along the way.

The group of disciples chatted on the Thunder Mirror. It was lively with many people.

After flying for more than a month, Wang Xian became familiar with them.

On this day, Wang Xian sat on the thunder mirror and ate the delicacies given to him by the disciples of the Lightning race. He was at ease.

In the surrounding area, the group of disciples were also drinking and eating. As they would arrive at the territory of the Lightning race in a few days, they let down their guard a little.

“Huh?”

All of a sudden, Wang Xian’s gaze froze.

“Be careful!”

He shouted softly and stood up immediately!
