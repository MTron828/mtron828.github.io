“The nameless prodigy is going to challenge the fourth-ranked Tang Feng!”

“The challenge continues. Haha, Tang Feng has already lost to Ren Xingchen and Ling Jian ‘ER. I think he will lose to the nameless prodigy as well!”

“Obviously, Tang Feng is definitely not a match for the nameless prodigy. However, Ren Xingchen and Ling Jian ‘ER’s strength is really surprising. They can actually defeat Tang Feng!”

The Sun Hung High in the sky. In front of the Prodigy stage, a young man dressed in blood-red clothes slowly walked towards the direction of the arena.

Beside him, there were more than ten young men. Among them, Tang Yuan, who was currently ranked seventh, and Tang Ling ‘er, who was ranked thirteenth.

They accompanied the young man dressed in blood-red clothes.

The young man was Tang Feng. He was once the Prodigy ranked second on the prodigy roll. He was only one step away from reaching the profound void martial stage.

However, at this moment, Tang Feng’s expression was extremely gloomy. As he listened to the discussions of the people around him, his gaze was cold and filled with killing intent.

On this day, he lost consecutively to Ren Xingchen and Ling Jian ‘ER.

Now, he faced the challenge of the nameless prodigy once again!

He knew that he wasn’t a match for that nameless prodigy.

Although he understood everything, when he heard the discussions of the people around him, his expression was still extremely unsightly. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

He was a prince of the blood flow empire, a proud son of heaven who had almost reached the peak in a single step. Being defeated consecutively made him feel extremely uncomfortable.

Now, a 26 year old fellow was challenging him, and he wasn’t even a match for him. This made his expression even more unsightly.

“Hu!”

He lightly exhaled, his eyes flickering.

“Hmph, this nameless son of heaven is really arrogant. There’s also Ren Xingchen and Ling Jian ‘ER. Each of them is simply disgusting!”

Tang Ling ‘er, who was beside him, revealed an angry expression and coldly snorted.

“They are also true prodigies!”

Tang Yuan, who was at the side, slightly furrowed his brows and could not help but say in admiration.

“What prodigies? When the experts of the Hanhai dynasty arrive, Ling Jian ‘er and Ren Xingchen might both be killed!”

Tang Ling ‘er curled her lips and her face was filled with disdain.

“Enough!”

In the middle, Tang Feng’s eyes revealed a trace of impatience as he said coldly.

When Tang Ling ‘er saw her brother’s angry look, she hurriedly shut her mouth.

“Let’s Go!”

The group directly flew towards the peak of the Heaven’s pride stage.

“Let’s go, let’s go and take a look. I don’t know if Tang Feng will fight or directly surrender!”

“I think he should surrender, because there’s no need to fight anymore!”

“It’s hard to say. After all, he’s the Prince of blood flow empire. How could he just admit defeat?”

Some people around saw Tang Feng and the rest flying over and followed closely behind.

When Tang Feng and the rest arrived in front of the Fourth Heaven’s pride stage, they saw three people already standing there.

Wang Xian, who was wearing a mask and a black robe, was standing there. Ren Xingchen and Ling Jian ‘er were standing behind him.

The three of them didn’t say anything.

When he saw Tang Feng and the rest flying over, Wang Xian turned around and looked at them. “Are you going to admit defeat or accept the challenge?”

He spoke to Tang Feng bluntly.

“HMPH, don’t be so arrogant!”

When Tang Ling ‘er heard Wang Xian’s words, she shouted with a cold expression.

“You are not a match for them!”

However, Ling Jian ‘er, who was standing at the side, responded coldly.

Tang Ling ‘er choked and glared at Ling Jian ‘er, her expression constantly changing.

Tang Feng’s expression was also not very good. With a cold expression, he directly walked into the arena.

“Buzz!”

Very quickly, Tang Feng walked out with a cold expression and flew into the distance with an expressionless face.

Tang Ling ‘er and the others hurriedly followed behind.

Meanwhile, those who had just flown up looked at Tang Feng who had left in astonishment.

“Has he admitted defeat?”

“He should have admitted defeat directly!”

“Hiss, Tang Feng admitted defeat directly. What’s next? Does he want to continue challenging Ling Jian ‘Er and Ren Xingchen?”

Everyone immediately looked forward and looked at Wang Xian, Ling Jian ‘er, and Ren Xingchen.

“Next, it’s Your Turn!”

When Wang Xian saw Tang Feng admitting defeat directly, a smile appeared on his face as he spoke to Ling Jian ‘er and Ren Xingchen directly.

“I admit defeat!”

Ren Xingchen said without hesitation.

What a joke. His golden water sword principle was given by Wang Xian and his life was saved by him. How could he not admit defeat.

“I admit defeat too!”

Ling Jian ‘er looked at Wang Xian and replied indifferently.

“Haha, Let’s leave after I take out the spiritual liquid!”

Wang Xian laughed out loud and entered the fourth arena. He took out the spiritual liquid and flew toward the higher arena.

Very quickly, the name of the Nameless Heaven’s pride expert rose rapidly on the Heaven’s pride roll.

Fourth, third, second!

He had always been locked in second place.

“The Nameless Heaven’s pride expert is challenging the first-ranked Qian Ye!”

“Only the first-ranked Qian ye is left. The Nameless Heaven’s pride expert will ascend to the top of the Heaven’s pride roll. This will be the first 26-year-old heaven’s pride expert in history. Oh My God!”

“Since the establishment of the Prodigy stage, the nameless prodigy is definitely the most powerful existence. Just one more step, just one more step!”

“It took him less than five days to reach the second place. This is crazy. He was just short of the final battle with Qian Ye. He won this battle. After all, his name shook the entire Liuhai Region!”

When the crowd on the prodigy stage saw Wang Xian challenging the final prodigy stage, they were all excited.

The final battle of the Top Heaven’s Pride Stage!

Without a doubt, the victor would be able to overlook all the younger generation in the Liuhai region.

He would be the king of the younger generation and would represent the strongest person in an era.

This was especially so for the Nameless Heaven’s pride stage. He was only 26 years old. If he could reach the peak, he would definitely become a legend.

The entire Heaven’s pride stage was in an uproar. Everyone was looking forward to the final battle on the Heaven’s Pride Stage!

Would it be the heaven-defying prodigy who reached the top without a name and created a legend.

Or would it be Qian ye who stood at the top of the rankings and looked down on all heroes.

No matter which victory he won, he would definitely become the most famous prodigy in the entire Liuhai region.

Wang Xian ignored the craziness below. He stayed in the cultivation room on the heaven’s pride stage and continued to comprehend the combination of the four attributes.

“At noon tomorrow, Qian Ye will meet the battle on Time!”

In less than two hours, a piece of shocking news was sent over, causing the entire heaven’s pride stage to be in an uproar.

“At noon tomorrow, Qian Ye will meet the challenge. It’s a battle that everyone has their eyes on. Whoever wins will be the champion of the younger generation in the flowing sea region!”

“Haha, this is too exciting. I guess the Nameless Heaven’s Pride will definitely win tomorrow!”

“I also feel that the Nameless Heaven’s pride has a higher chance of winning. Two years ago, Qian ye narrowly defeated Tang Feng with a few moves and obtained victory. Now that there are so many heaven’s pride talents, Qian ye might become the stepping stone for the Nameless One!”

“Bullshit! Our senior Qian Ye has made great progress in the past two years. That nameless is definitely not a match for him!”

“Don’t Brag about your divine wind academy. Why Don’t you all take a look at the strength of the nameless prodigy? Tomorrow, Your Senior Qian Ye will definitely receive an explosive blow!”
