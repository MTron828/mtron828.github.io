“Alright, I have transferred $700k over. Please check your online banking account.”

A middle-aged man spoke to Wang Xian in front of the goldfish fair after completing the fund transfer.

“Alright, I have received it.” Wang Xian revealed a smile on his face. After he noticed the crowd in front of him, he shouted loudly, “There are three more top-grade Redcap Brown Oranda selling for $350k each. No restock after these are sold. In addition, there’s a top-grade Chilli Red Arowana selling for three million dollars. Feel free to come and take a look.”

“Give me one.” After seeing someone else had purchased it, more people in the crowd were tempted, considering the fact that the price was cheaper than those in the goldfish fair by eighty thousand dollars.

At such a cheap price, they might even be able to earn several tens of thousands by flipping it.

“Alright.” Wang Xian nodded his head with a smile. He immediately placed the Redcap Brown Oranda into a fishbowl and handed it to that old man.

With another $350k transferred into his account, Wang Xian was getting a little agitated. He had $1.05 million in his account now!

“There are two more Redcap Brown Oranda and a Chilli Red Arowana.” Wang Xian shouted towards the crowd that had grown to close to a hundred people.

At this very moment, Director Zhao, who was at the service counter for the organizing party, looked at the exhibition hall in doubt.

“Why are there so few people?”

Several middle-aged and old men at the side frowned slightly and seconded, “Yeah, where did everybody go?”

“Director Zhao, Director Lian,” shouted an employee as he ran towards them.

“What’s the matter? Why are you so flustered?” Director Zhao looked at the young man, frowned and asked.

“Director Zhao, something bad has happened. There’s a guy who set up a stall at the entrance selling Redcap Brown Oranda at the price of $350k each. He has already sold a total of three fish.” The young man replied anxiously.

“What? There’s someone selling Redcap Brown Oranda? At $350k each?” Director Zhao looked at the young man with a face of disbelief.

“Yes, Director Zhao. $350k each. There are over a hundred people who have gathered at that place currently.” The young man nodded his head immediately.

“$350k each and he has already sold three.” Director Zhao was a little displeased. He stood up immediately and headed out.

When he was at the entrance, he saw a group of people crowding the entrance.

“I’ll take the last two Redcap Brown Oranda.”

At this moment, Director Zhao heard a guy beside him shout loudly.

“Excuse me.” The middle-aged man said to the people in front of him as he tried to make his way forward.

Director Zhao looked around and squeezed forward behind the man with displeasure.

“Alright, these are the last two Redcap Brown Oranda.” After hearing the man, Wang Xian replied with a faint smile.

“Bank transfer.” The middle-aged man said and nodded his head in satisfaction after walking forward and seeing the two Redcap Brown Oranda.

“Alright.” Wang Xian nodded his head.

Director Zhao, who was following behind, felt embarrassed instantly. He took a glance at the two Redcap Brown Oranda and the styrofoam box at the side. His mouth started twitching uncontrollably.

“Damn it. Did he keep the goldfish that are worth several million in a styrofoam box? Playing dumb to take advantage of others!”

Director Zhao was clearly displeased. After this brat sold Redcap Brown Oranda at $350k each, it would be impossible for him to sell his Redcap Brown Oranda in the goldfish fair at $430k. In fact, he might not be able to sell them even if he reduced the price to $350k.

Wang Xian noticed Director Zhao but didn’t pay much attention to him. He continued, “There’s one last top-grade Chilli Red Arowana left. You can take it for just three million.”

“This Arowana is really beautiful but the price is too high.”

“This top-grade chili red Arowana is definitely worth three million dollars. However, that’s three million! Who could afford it?”

“Yeah, yeah. It’s too expensive. However, if I had the money, I would definitely buy it. This chili red Arowana is simply too beautiful. ”

The surrounding crowd was discussing and commenting. An Arowana that cost three million dollars was indeed not easy to sell.

Wang Xian heard the conversation of the people in the crowd and frowned slightly. Arowana that cost several million was indeed not so easy to sell. There weren’t many people who could afford it.

However, what made him the most disappointed was that there was no one who bought the chili red Arowana.

The crowd of customers simply left after admiring it for some time.

“Damn it. If I had known about it, I wouldn’t have upgraded such an expensive Arowana.” Wang Xian looked at the time and it was already three o’clock in the afternoon. Yet, the Arowana was still not sold.

Although there was always a huge crowd looking at it, there weren’t many who could have afforded it.

Just like what they had commented, it was too expensive.

“Phew!”

Wang Xian waited all the way to five o’clock and hadn’t even had his lunch.

“Forget it, I’m not selling it anymore. I have $1.75 million in my hands now and it should be sufficient.”

Wang Xian was a man who was easily contented. Although he couldn’t sell this Arowana, it didn’t really affect his mood.

After all, he had still been working hard for several hundreds of dollars a few days ago.

After placing the Arowana into the styrofoam box, Wang Xian rode his Harley towards the school.

He put the Arowana in his dormitory room and headed directly for the First-grade Seafood Restaurant.

With more than $1.7 million in his account, he wouldn’t be lacking money in the short term.

“Let’s head to the ocean tomorrow and see if I can raise my own level.”

Wang Xian made the decision in his mind.

Rivertown was a town that was beside the sea and in the vicinity of Bohai Sea.

Bohai Sea was one of the four main seas in the country. At the same time, it was the only inland sea.

The size of Bohai Sea was the smallest among the four seas. At the same time, it has the shallowest seabed.

“Just perfect for myself.”

The next morning, Wang Xian rode his heavy-duty motorcycle and headed towards the sea.

He took a look at his attributes. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Name: Wang Xian

Race: Human (Ability to transform into a Dragon)

Level: 1

Dragon Energy: 25/1,000

Superpower: Dominate the marine animals (Ability to rule any marine animals that are lower than your own level)

Devour any form of marine animals (For extraction of dragon energy)

Art of Cultivation: Divine Dragon Transformation

I’m still not powerful enough at the moment and can only move around in the shallows region of Bohai Sea. If I encounter marine animals like sharks, I’ll probably be devoured by them. Luckily, sharks are few in the vicinity of the Bohai Sea.

Wang Xian thought to himself and he soon arrived at the seaside.

The areas of Rivertown along the sea had become tourist and vacation hotspots after the last few years of development.

In this vicinity, the environment was great and it was a rather famous tourist beach.

Wang Xian parked his heavy-duty motorcycle in a parking slot before heading to a rather deserted position.

After ensuring that there wasn’t anyone in the surrounding area, Wang Xian turned his vision to the sea in front of him.

The sea was boundless and the waves came one after another. Looking at the sea, Wang Xian was suddenly filled with enthusiasm.

“Dragon coasting through the seas!”

Wang Xian removed his clothes and entered the sea gradually.

The weather in August was extremely hot. The water didn’t feel cold at all as he entered into the sea.

Wang Xian was exhilarated. Leaping forward, he dived into the sea directly.

“Turn into a dragon.”

He was ebullient!

Swish!

Wriggling his tail slightly, Wang Xian turned into a divine dragon the size of a human’s palm.

While in the seas, his speed was really fast. In just a move, he was able to cover four to five meters.

“Haha, this is where I truly belong. Oh the great seas, here I come.”

Wang Xian wiggled his tail excitedly as he swam towards the sea.
