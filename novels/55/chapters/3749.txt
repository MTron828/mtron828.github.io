3750 3749 on the death of the Skyfire Patriarch

Wang Xian was very satisfied with the improvement of the disciples of the Dragon Palace.

Over a hundred thousand years, there were more than a dozen rulers. This was not a small number!

However, the disciples of the Dragon Palace did not obtain any great opportunities!

The more than a dozen disciples were all at the peak of the venerable realm. It was a normal breakthrough.

“However, if I can bring the fire element disciples of the Dragon Palace here, it will definitely be able to bring a huge improvement to the Dragon Palace.”

Wang Xian mumbled to himself and immediately informed all the fire-type experts of the Dragon Palace. Then, he instructed an lie.

He asked an lie to bring the fire-type disciples of the Dragon Palace here.

With the beast skin supporting a space, if the disciples of the Dragon Palace could cultivate in this space, they would receive a huge improvement.

However, he didn’t know if he could succeed!

“There shouldn’t be a problem, right?”

He thought to himself. His current strength was already very strong. The three space beasts closest to him were only at the third level of the Overlord realm.

Wang Xian could completely use his energy to block the situation on his side so that the space beasts wouldn’t be able to sense him!

As long as the disciples of the Dragon Palace came over safely, he could cultivate slowly in this space!

He scanned his surroundings and soon, an lie sent him a message.

Everything was ready!

Wang Xian shielded a space under his body and placed the demonic spirit altar below.

Buzz

Soon, an lie and a fire god Dragon from the Dragon Palace came over.

The Fire God Dragon was in human form and he was concealing all his aura!

Furthermore, with Wang Xian’s concealment, no one noticed the sudden arrival of an lie and the rest!

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

An lie and the disciples of the Dragon Palace immediately transmitted their voices respectfully.

“Yes, you are currently cultivating in seclusion here. Be careful, you must restrain yourself. Otherwise, if anything goes wrong, you will be destroyed!”

Wang Xian reminded him solemnly.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The disciple of the Dragon Palace replied immediately.

He sat cross-legged at the seat below and began to cultivate immediately!

Due to the body of Wang Xian, the space beast, blocking his view, the space beast could not see him.

As long as he did not display the might of the divine dragon, it would not be a problem!

He took a look at the surrounding movements and revealed a smile.

“An lie, continue. Bring another 1,000 fire element disciples of the Dragon Palace over.”

Seeing that nothing unexpected had happened, Wang Xian ordered immediately.

“It’s the Dragon King!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

An lie immediately replied. Not long after, 1,000 Dragon Palace disciples sat cross-legged at Wang Xian’s position.

Waves of fire element energy surged into their bodies, increasing their strength rapidly.

This place was a paradise for fire element powerhouses to cultivate.

To the dragon palace fire element disciples who had yet to reach the overlord level, it was a holy land for rapid transformation.

“Phew, it’s not a big problem!”

Wang Xian looked at the group of disciples who were cultivating and revealed a smile.

There were seven to eight species of space beasts in the center of the Fiery Heart Treasure Land. They each occupied a spot and would not disturb each other.

In the past 100,000 years, Wang Xian could also sense that space beasts had made a breakthrough. The commotion was huge.

However, the space beasts in the surroundings also took a glance and continued to make a breakthrough.

One should never cross paths with another.

“It will take me millions of years to break through again. There is no need for me to stay here for the time being. I can go to other places to look for opportunities!”

At this moment, Wang Xian had the idea of leaving.

Although this was a treasure land for cultivation, there were many resources in the starry universe. With the increase in his strength, he was already able to hunt and kill a level three ruler Realm Space Beast!

He could go and find other opportunities.

Even if he killed a level 3 ruler realm space beast, it could increase the number of disciples of the Dragon Palace by 1,000 peak venerables. It was much more suitable than cultivating here!

He thought to himself, taking out some robots he got from Lin Wenluo to support this beast skin!

“An lie, bring me out. Also, you will stay here for the rest of the time. Once there are any strange movements from the surrounding space beasts, bring them out immediately!”

Wang Xian immediately instructed an lie!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

An lie nodded.

Buzz

Soon, an lie set up a demonic altar not far away. Their figures moved and brought Wang Xian out immediately!

Boom

After flying out from the surroundings of the hotheart treasured land, Wang Xian could not help but stretch his body. Waves of terrifying energy surged into the surroundings.

In the center of the hotheart treasured land, he needed to constantly suppress his energy to prevent it from spreading out. Now, there was no need for that at all!

At this moment, he was standing in a remote corner of a fiery planet in the surrounding hotheart treasured land.

He moved his body and looked around.

“Eh, there are more and more strong disciples here. They even set up a teleportation formation here!”

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings with a look of surprise.

“It seems like a huge change has occurred in this place after being in seclusion for more than 100,000 years!”

He took out the communication stone plate and checked the situation that had happened over the past 100,000 years.

When he saw all kinds of information on the communication stone plate, his eyes lit up!

“So many things have happened over the past 100,000 years. I already know that more than 20 experts from high-level races have broken through to the Overlord realm. However, the most important news is the news of a group of experts from the peak races being killed.”

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up.

The news of a group of experts from the peak races who were the overlords of level eight and above being killed was very important to him.

What did this mean?

This meant that in the starry universe, the strongest person among the top-notch races was only an existence at level seven.

As for Wang Xian, he was an existence at level six. With the speed of the Netherspirit Avatar and the incorporeal holy wings, he was able to escape from the hands of a level seven overlord.

“If the Five Elements Millstone and the tai chi dragon plate can keep up with my strength, then I will be able to have the strength to fight against a level seven overlord. In the starry universe, I will no longer have to fear the top-notch races and I will have a chance to obtain more resources!”

Wang Xian’s heart was burning with excitement.

This piece of news was a huge piece of good news for him!

He looked around and checked the communication stone plate again.

There were more and more cultivators gathered at the fiery heart treasure land. It was still a huge risk to gather here.

If there were violent cosmic beasts attacking the surrounding strong disciples, they would be in big trouble!

Therefore, as time passed, teleportation formations were built here.

Even if the space beasts were to suddenly erupt, they could escape immediately through the teleportation formations!

“I’ll go to the storm continent first. It’s been over a hundred thousand years. I should have accumulated quite a lot of metal!”

Wang Xian mumbled as he flew towards a lively flaming planet.

There was a teleportation formation that could teleport one a distance away. It could save one a distance!

Just as Wang Xian was about to fly over, a burst of energy suddenly erupted from a flaming planet not far away.
