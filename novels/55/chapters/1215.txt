Chapter 1216: The name of the 1217 Sword Demon

Translator: 5496903

In front of the Sword Mansion, a mysterious young man stood in the void with a black longsword in his hand.

Below him, there were more than 200 corpses lying on the ground, including two half-step void interpretation level corpses.

In the middle, a young man was kneeling there.

Around him were more than 1,000 people with shocked expressions.

Wang Xian was floating in the sky. His gaze swept around and looked at the young man kneeling below him. Upon hearing his words, his expression didn’t change at all.

Take him in as a disciple?

Be an ox or a horse?

Wang Xian moved his body and landed on the ground slowly. He swept his cold gaze across the corpses around him. With a move of his arm, he kept all of them into his interspatial ring.

“Master, please take me in as a disciple. Please let me serve you by your side. I beg you!”

Ren Xingchen saw Wang Xian flying below and ignoring him. He knelt on the ground and shouted loudly again with an excited expression.

As he spoke, he kowtowed to Wang Xian.

When everyone around saw this scene, they were shocked.

Wang Xian looked at Ren Xingchen and shook his head lightly. “I will not take you in as my disciple!”

“What? That young man wants to acknowledge this mysterious person as his master, but he refused. You have to know that this young man is a Peerless Heaven’s favorite with both metal and water attributes. Who wouldn’t want to have such a monstrous disciple? He actually rejected it!”

“He even refused? This young man in shabby clothes has such monstrous talent, yet he still refused. You have to know that if this young man doesn’t perish, he will definitely be a mighty powerhouse in the future!”

When the surrounding people saw Wang Xian’s direct and indifferent rejection, they were shocked. They whispered in disbelief.

Such a monstrous heaven’s favorite. If he were to say that he wanted to find a master, there would definitely be a fourth or fifth level void interpretation stage powerhouse who would be willing to take him in as a disciple.

Who would reject such a disciple with unlimited potential?

However, Wang Xian would reject it without even the slightest hesitation.

He would not accept Ren Xingchen as his disciple, nor would he let him be a slave.

He was merely a disciple at the ninth level of the transcendence realm. So what if he was a dual-attributed genius?

To accept such a disciple and still have to be responsible for him, it would only cause more trouble.

He did not even bring Ao Yao with him this time around. How could he accept a burden. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

To him, a Peerless Heaven’s favorite with dual attributes was merely so-so.

At the very least, Ao Yao could instantly kill Ren Xingchen. Even if Ren Xingchen became a powerhouse in the future, Ao Yao would still be able to kill him instantly.

“Master, I... Beg You!”

Ren Xingchen gritted his teeth when he heard his rejection. He kowtowed heavily once again.

“Alright, since you said that I won’t take you in as my disciple, I won’t take you in. It’s just that we are fated to be together!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and said coldly. He turned around and walked straight to the edge of the tomb of the demi-human.

“A man should strengthen himself. Strength is the foundation. I can save you twice, but it’s impossible for me to save you three times!”

As Wang Xian walked, he relaxed his eyebrows and reminded him lightly.

After that, his figure flashed and he flew out quickly.

“A man should be strong...”

Ren Xingchen’s face was filled with disappointment when he saw Wang Xian leaving. However, a determined look appeared on his face soon after.

He raised his head abruptly and shouted with determination, “Senior, can you leave a name for me? Where can I find you?”

“When I become stronger, when I become a strong person, I want to find you!”

“We are fated to meet, but not fated to meet!”

However, Wang Xian’s answer was bound to disappoint him.

A dispirited look appeared on his face. His eyes flickered as he looked at Wang Xian’s figure until he disappeared.

“Even such a proud son of Heaven doesn’t know. This mysterious person is really arrogant. I’m afraid he is also a strong person with dual attributes. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to fight against two people by himself and kill all of them!”

In the surroundings, an old man at the first level of the profound void tier muttered. He looked at Ren Xingchen, wishing that he could take him in as a disciple.

Unfortunately, he didn’t have the qualifications!

“Clang!”

Right at this moment, the sound of a sword rang out from the center.

Everyone was slightly stunned and hurriedly looked over. Their faces slowly revealed a stunned expression.

They saw Ren Xingchen, who was holding a large sword in his hand, slowly stand up.

His gaze was filled with determination and fighting spirit. He stared at Zhou Yanmei and walked over step by step with determination.

“What is he trying to do?”

When the surrounding people saw this scene, their faces revealed a shocked expression.

Zhou Yanmei’s expression also changed slightly. When she saw Ren Xingchen walking over, she could not help but take two steps back.

She squeezed out a smile on her face. “You... Congratulations. I knew that you... you would be able to survive.”

Zhou Yanmei’s expression was extremely ugly as she said this.

“Although senior did not take me as his disciple, I will remember his words in my heart!”

“A man should strengthen himself. Only strength is the foundation. Only strength. If others provoke me, Ren Xingchen, I can kill them. If you don’t have strength, then you have to strengthen yourself and make yourself stronger!”

Ren Xingchen walked towards him, step by step, his face full of determination.

“You... What do you want to Do?”

Zhou Yanmei looked at his determined eyes, her eyes filled with panic as she asked hesitantly.

“I’ll kill you!”

Ren Xingchen did not hide anything. He raised the large sword in his hand and directly attacked her.

He directly released his strongest attack, the piercing golden sword!

“No... Don’t!”

Zhou Yanmei’s face revealed a terrified expression, wanting to flee into the distance.

Even the old woman beside him had a shocked expression.

The old woman’s strength was only at the 9th rank of the ascended realm. Facing a peerless genius that could kill a half-step void interpretation realm expert, she didn’t have the strength to resist.

“Ah!”

A scream ended Zhou Yanmei’s life.

Ren Xingchen didn’t hesitate and flew into the distance. He wanted to leave this place and find a place to become stronger.

“Hiss, dual attributes, dual attributes. He is truly a peerless genius!”

“This Ren Xingchen is simply too powerful. He has the strength to kill a half-step void interpretation expert at the level of transcendent level 9. That sword technique is too powerful. He is simply the King of sword cultivators, the Sword King!”

“He can’t be called the sword king yet. It is not an exaggeration to call the mysterious youth who exterminated the Meng clan the Sword King. His strength is so terrifying!”

“I can take up the title of Little Sword King. However, I feel that the mysterious expert should be called the sword demon. Oh My God, with a wave of his long sword, black gas filled the air!”

“The terrifying and deep black space killed more than 200 people in one move. Two experts at the first level of the void interpretation realm. The name of the sword demon lives up to its name!”

Little Sword King Ren Xingchen!

The mysterious sword demon was able to slash the void interpretation realm!

When Ren Xingchen and Wang Xian left the surroundings, the people around the sword mansion began to discuss among themselves.

Ren Xingchen, who had both metal and water attributes, was known as the Little Sword King for his ability to kill people of a higher level than him.

The mysterious young man should not be very old either. He killed more than 200 people in a single battle and was known as the sword demon.

The appearance of two such freakish people would definitely cause a stir in the human-demon graveyard in the next few days.
