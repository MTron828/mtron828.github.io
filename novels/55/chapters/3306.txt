3307 On the 3306 scorpion destruction imperial city

“There are strange creatures invading the Scorpion Emperor’s Cave.”

“Who dares to court death? How dare they barge into the Scorpion Emperor’s Cave!”

The corrosive energy prevented Wang Xian from entering the Scorpion Emperor’s cave. Following that, from the inside of the Scorpion Emperor’s Cave, one figure after another flew over.

They carried a powerful poisonous gas on their bodies. The substance-like poisonous gas charged directly at Wang Xian.

“HMPH, since I can’t go in to investigate, I’ll just kill my way in.”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with violent killing intent.

He wasn’t here for fun. He was here to destroy the scorpion imperial city and attack the Lich Kingdom.

Since he had been discovered, there was no need to hide.

Furthermore, according to what he knew, there were 12 main cities in the Lich Kingdom. Each main city only had one level 8 universe knight, The Lich City Lord.

Wang Xian was confident that he could kill a level 8 universe knight within 10 seconds.

“Hong!”

His body shook, and a terrifying force rushed out in all directions.

His body moved, and he charged directly into the Scorpion Emperor Grotto-heaven.

“Peng!”

The defense of the Scorpion Emperor Grotto-heaven was directly broken through by him.

The moment he entered, he saw over 1,000 liches attacking him.

Each of the liches had a combat strength that was no less than a level 5 universe knight.

“Haha, as long as there are more liches from the liches’countries, we can make up for the loss of the Righteous God Race!”

Wang Xian laughed out loud. He waved his arm and turned it into a dragon claw.

The Dragon Claw tore straight ahead.

The terrifying power contained in the dragon claw caused the expressions of the thousands of liches who were charging at him to change drastically.

“This is bad. The strength of the intruders is extremely terrifying.”

Among the thousands of liches, there were liches who possessed extremely powerful senses and sharp perception of danger.

“Can you escape? All of you shall die!”

Killing intent appeared in Wang Xian’s eyes. He waved his dragon claw and attacked them directly.

“We can’t escape. Attack!”

A lich powerhouse’s eyes turned red as he roared coldly.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

In an instant, all kinds of attacks were launched at Wang Xian.

Some liches had densely packed eyeballs. Every eyeball was emitting a blood-red glow.

Some liches had their chests split open as a large amount of poisonous gas rushed forward.

All kinds of strange attacks.

“Die!”

However, their strength was still not enough for Wang Xian.

The strongest level seven universe Knight Lich could not withstand Wang Xian’s attack.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

“Awoo, fight, fight, there’s a strong enemy invasion!”

The sounds of collision and misery rang out. In an instant, nearly 1,000 liches were killed by Wang Xian. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

However, there were still a few liches who managed to dodge this fatal blow and roared downwards.

At the bottom of the scorpion emperor grotto-heaven was a poisonous pond.

The entire poisonous pond was emitting a black-green light.

Within this light, there were many figures hidden.

“Not good, it’s a universe knight level 8 powerhouse. Our Scorpion Claw City Lord isn’t Here!”

A lich with a huge vertical eye said with a solemn expression.

“Immediately inform the city leader to use the grotto-heaven to defend against the enemy!”

Beside him, there was a slender figure with a beautiful head, but the head was densely packed with countless poisonous snakes.

The strangest thing was that this talking lich only had this strange and beautiful head and no other body.

“Kill!”

He spat out a cold killing intent and his body shook.

“Kill, anyone who dares to invade our Scorpion Emperor City, die!”

“Sky Miasma, Rise!”

A few liches roared.

The Aura they gave off were all at Universe Knight Level 7.

Hua La

In the poison pool below them, a green scorpion flew out.

“Whoever dares to invade our Scorpion Emperor’s grotto-heaven will die!”

A dense voice that sounded like countless overlapping voices came from the Scorpion’s body.

The Scorpion was about a thousand meters in size. Cracks appeared in the void around it.

He stared at Wang Xian who was in the sky and charged forward in an instant.

The five lich powerhouses around them exchanged glances and followed the scorpion.

“HMM? This scorpion doesn’t seem to be a known powerhouse in the Lich Kingdom. No, this creature is a little special!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and stared at the scorpion that was attacking him.

The green scorpion with black spots emitted a terrifying aura.

The strangest thing was that there were thousands of faces on the Scorpion’s head.

Each face was extremely ferocious as they stared at Wang Xian with bloodthirsty eyes.

“It is said that every force that enters the heaven-splitting primordial land is able to occupy a blessed land. Each blessed land has a different effect.”

“This scorpion should be a guardian monster created by the Lich Kingdom using a special method. This monster can not leave the Scorpion Emperor’s blessed land, but it can unleash terrifying strength.”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly. The heaven-splitting primordial land was the first continent in the universe, and it was also the most central existence. It had nurtured countless races, and naturally, it also possessed a very mystical place.

“PFFT!”

At this moment, the scorpion heads that flew over opened their mouths one by one. Poison threads attacked Wang Xian instantly.

Wang Xian focused his gaze and waved his arm. A destructive force of the five elements covered the poison threads.

“Pu, Pu, Pu!”

However, what surprised him was that the poison threads penetrated his destructive force instantly.

“He is not an ordinary universe knight with level eight combat strength!”

Wang Xian muttered. In the next moment, the five elements grinding mill appeared around him. The Yin-yang dragon coiled around him.

“Kill!”

His eyes were filled with a sinister look as he attacked the poisonous scorpion.

“Bang!”

The dragon claws formed from his arms clawed at the poisonous scorpion.

The poisonous scorpion also extended its claws, which were flowing with black-green poisonous water, to meet Wang Xian’s dragon claws.

“Bang!”

The sound of a collision was heard. Wang Xian felt the dragon claws stiffen slightly as all sorts of toxins entered his body.

The Yin-yang dragon coiled around him and immediately expelled the toxins.

“Bang!”

In the sky, the five elements Millstone had transformed into a gray divine dragon shadow that swooped down from the sky.

Around this Divine Dragon Shadow were the sun, Coffin, Pagoda, Ice Sword, fire saber, and ropes.

“Boom!”

The terrifying attack from the five elements millstone landed on the scorpion.

“Ahhhh!”

On the scorpion’s body, screams of pain could be heard. More than half of the faces on the Scorpion’s head were disintegrated in an instant and were corroded rapidly.

It looked extremely bloody.

“HMPH!”

“Dragon Eye Lock!”

Wang Xian grunted coldly as chains flew towards it.

“The opponent is very strong. Attack!”

Below, the Universe Knights of Scorpion Imperial City, Level 7 masters, saw this scene and their expressions changed slightly. Their pupils constricted as they roared.
