Chapter 1314: 1315 land of five elements

“Eh? What kind of ferocious beast is that? What a huge body! What a terrifying figure!”

“Be careful. It might be someone who ran out from the main hall. He must be at least at level three of the Void Interpretation Stage!”

In the main hall, in the Sea of the demonic beast clan, some of the demonic beasts were shocked when they saw Wang Xian speeding away.

The third level of the Seethrough realm was considered a top-notch expert in the human-demon graveyard.

No one would attack such an expert recklessly.

“Wang, we’re here. It’s the building in front of us!”

When they were about ten kilometers away, the Demon Soul Stared at a demonic beast that was only two to three hundred meters in size.

“Over there?”

Wang Xian looked over and flew down directly.

“There are demonic beasts inside!”

When Wang Xian got closer, he sensed that there were demonic beasts inside. His body moved and he flew straight in with his demonic soul.

“Roar! Roar!”

Before he got close, two demonic qilin demonic beasts came out from inside. They were six to seven meters in size and their bodies were emitting light-like flames.

“Not good!”

When they saw Wang Xian flying over, the two demonic qilin demonic beasts didn’t hesitate at all and fled into the distance.

“Die!”

Without Wang Xian taking action, the demonic souls at the side launched a fatal attack.

“What? Sir, why are you attacking us!”

“We are of the same race, you...”

The two demonic beasts saw the demonic souls suddenly taking action and their eyes revealed fear as they roared loudly.

“Roar! Roar!”

However, before they could finish their words, the attacks landed on them.

Wang Xian waved his dragon claw and kept the corpses of the two demonic beasts into his interspatial ring.

“Go in!”

Wang Xian swayed his body and entered the cave directly.

The spiritual energy in the cave was more abundant than in the outside world. He looked around and didn’t find any entrance.

“Wang, the entrance is here. It’s very secretive. I entered it by chance back then.”

The Demonic Lin entered the dimension sundering cave and came to a corner.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian looked over with his dragon eyes and didn’t find anything strange.

Buzz Buzz Buzz

Following that, under his astonished gaze, the demonic soul attacked that direction heavily. Its front hooves sank into it directly.

“Roar!”

It let out a cry and drilled its head into it directly.

Wang Xian followed closely behind and drilled into the ground.

As soon as he entered, a chaotic aura rushed over.

“It’s really magical!”

Wang Xian turned his head around and realized that the place where they had entered was already sealed. They were in a long passageway.

“Wang, the energy here is very chaotic, especially in that place. The energy of the five attributes is filled. It’s impossible to cultivate in there. It’s very uncomfortable to stay in there!”

Yao Lin walked in front and spoke to Wang Xian with an unpleasant expression.

“Increase the speed!”

At this moment, Wang Xian’s huge dragon eyes were emitting a scorching glow.

The five elements origin in his body was starting to stir.

He took a deep breath and a rich energy entered his body, making him feel extremely comfortable.

“The chaotic five elements energy is actually a great tonic for me. Cultivating here is even more than ten times better than cultivating in the Dragon Palace!”

“The Demon Soul said that the chaotic energy of the five elements in the deepest part of the tunnel is almost like liquid. If that’s the case!”

His eyes were burning with excitement. He moved his body and headed into the tunnel at an even faster speed.

The entire tunnel was at least more than ten kilometers long. The deeper he went in, the denser the energy of the five elements became.

At the back, it almost formed a fog.

“King, we’re here. It’s the space in front of us!”

The voice of the Demon Soul was heard. Wang Xian looked over and saw a huge stone chamber inside.

The entire stone chamber was as if it was in a liquid. It was misty and even Wang Xian couldn’t see very far.

The Demon Soul could only see things ten meters away from here.

Wang Xian’s swaying body entered the stone chamber directly. The entire stone chamber was about two kilometers in circumference.

He came to the center of the stone chamber where there were ten cultivation cattails. His huge eyes were staring at the bottom, and his eyes were sparkling.

“This place should be the center of the spirit vein. The ancient blood stream sect was built on top of a huge spirit vein. The spirit mines in other places have already been dug out. However, the spirit mines in the main hall are sealed by a formation and can not be dug out!”

“This is also the reason why the main hall can stand for so long!”

Wang Xian placed his dragon claw next to the Futon and a rich energy was transmitted over.

“Eh!”

At this moment, Wang Xian saw a line of human words on the wall of the other party.

“Heaven-defying prodigy plan, cultivating the five elements and mastering the supernatural ability, standing at the peak of transcendence!”

When Wang Xian saw the line of words on the wall, his face was slightly shocked.

“Cultivate the five elements, grasp the supernatural power, is this going to...”

Wang Xian was astonished. This ancient blood flow sect actually wanted to cultivate a peerless genius who cultivated the five elements at the same time, defying the heavens.

This was simply too shocking.

To cultivate the five elements at the same time, this difficulty was tantamount to defying the heavens.

“The No. 1 seed of heaven-defying prodigy, 100 years, cultivation to level eight of transcendence!”

“No. 2 seed of Heaven’s favorite, 80 years, cultivation level to transcendent level 6!”

“No. 3 seed of Heaven’s favorite, 75 years, cultivation level to transcendent level 5!”

There were messages carved on the wall. There were a total of 10 seeds of Heaven’s favorite, with the highest cultivation level being transcendent level 8.

“Cultivation of the five elements, difficult and difficult. It’s harder than ascending to the blue sky. Blood Stream sect’s heaven-defying plan has failed!”

Finally, there was a line of words written on the wall. Wang Xian raised his eyebrows.

“It’s not just difficult to cultivate all five elements at the same time. If I didn’t obtain the Divine Dragon’s inheritance and possess the five elements origin, it would be extremely difficult to improve myself!”

“However, this land of five elements is a huge treasure trove to me!”

“I can completely convert the energy of the five elements into Dragon Qi. Furthermore, this liquid-like five elements can allow me to comprehend the combination of the elements even faster!”

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up. If he were to cultivate here, he would be able to achieve a breakthrough in less than half a year.

“I’m really lucky to have met this fellow Demon Soul!”

The Demon Soul had obtained the five elements spirit Pearl by chance. This place was useless to him. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

However, to him, even the dragon palace could not compare to it.

“I’ll cultivate. I’ll go to the main hall when my strength has improved!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled as his huge body lay in the stone chamber.

Invisible Energy surged wildly into his body and rapidly converted into Dragon Qi.

He opened his mouth slightly and spat out the five elemental spirit pearl. During this period of time, the Spirit Pearl had yet to form into a dragon pearl.

Now, under the majestic five elemental energy, the growth of the Dragon Pearl was accelerated.

In the huge stone chamber, the crouching dragon was hiding inside and absorbing the power of the five elements.

The resplendent scales were emitting all kinds of colorful radiance and looked extremely mystical.

Five fist-sized spirit pearls were floating above his head.

Wang Xian began his cultivation and evolution, a qualitative transformation.
