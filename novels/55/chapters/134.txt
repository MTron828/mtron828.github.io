Arrogant!

With his dragon-head walking stick in his hand, Yan Gukong swept his overbearing gazes across everyone.

The crowd next to Yan Gukong overlooked the rest of the people, exuding powerful aura.

“Old Yan, aren’t you a bully? We’re just a small family. You don’t have to be so pushy. I have been in the underworld for more than ten years, and I still have some connections. The Hu Family just wants to stay out of this!” Hu Fei said to Yan Gukong and his clique sullenly.

His purpose here this time was not to fight for any status. He just wanted to ensure the safety of the Hu Family.

He had seen situations like what happened tonight in the Yan Family throughout his dozen years of underworld experience.

When a powerful family rises, the rest of the families either submit to it or be destroyed. This was the norm in the underworld.

Hence, he was here to protect the Hu Family!

“Oh? Is that so?”

Yan Gukong remained silent. But the young man next to him looked at Hu Fei with a teasing look.

“The Whirling Blade Hu Fei. I have heard of your name. It’s just that I’m not sure if you have what it takes to be a legend!”

As the young man spoke, he slowly walked down from the table.

Hu Fei frowned as he glared disgruntledly at that young man. “I’m talking to Old Yan. You’re not fit to talk to me yet.”

“Is that so?”

The young man swung his arms, and a belt sword appeared creepily in his hand. He lifted his chin slightly and said, “Sacred Seas of Swords, Yan Feng. I want a taste of your blade!”

“What? Sacred Seas of Swords!”

Hu Fei was stunned by Yan Feng and he looked shocked. His eyes narrowed. “You’re from the Sacred Seas of Swords?”

“Heh, you can test me. Aren’t you a Level-nine Martial Artist?”

Yan Feng put on a smiling face and looked as though he was someone charming. “Oh, you said you have many friends. Just nice. I have friends too!”

“Haha, good to have friends around the world!”

At the same time, a gentle and feminine voice was heard. Subsequently, a fair-looking young man stood from the back of the row.

The young man made a leap and presented himself in front of the Yan Family at an unbelievable speed.

He sat down on an empty seat there with a smile. “It’s a better seat here. What a broad vision!”

“He’s formidable.”

“He’s fast! This young man is at least a Level-nine Martial Artist.”

“Gosh, this young man is actually from Sacred Seas of Swords. Sacred Seas of Swords!”

“Gone. I did not expect that young man to be someone from the Sacred Seas of Swords. The Yan Family is unstoppable!”

The Martial Artists were differentiated by levels, as were the families and clans.

In the underworld, the families and clans were split into Third-class Force and Saint-class Force.

According to this classification, the Yan Family was considered to be the second class, while the First-class Force would already have Inborn Experts.

As for the Saint-class Forces, it meant the families or clans possessed daunting influence and strength with over ten Inborn Experts.

Sacred Followers Guild, Medical Saint Sect, and Sacred Seas of Swords were colossuses.

Even Yan Feng was a member of the Saint-class force, and no average families or sects could afford to get into his bad books.

Hu Fei glared at Yan Feng with a dreadful expression. He did not expect that the young man before him was a disciple of the Sacred Seas of Swords.

The Sacred Seas of Swords headquarters was located on an island in the sea. That island was one of the sacred lands of swordsmanship.

The young man who was recruited by the Sacred Seas of Swords must be a rare talent.

“The sword vs. the saber. Show me your skill. If you can defeat me, I’ll let the Hu Family leave this place. Otherwise...!”

Yan Feng lifted his chin and wielded his Belt Sword like an agile snake. The sharp edge of the sword gave off a cold radiance.

“Haha, my grandson has made himself clear. Show us what you’ve got so that we know if you’re qualified to defy the Yan Family!”

Yan Gukong looked at his grandson and laughed out loud.

It was a great blessing to the Yan Family that this grandson of his was a disciple of the Sacred Seas of Swords.

With his grandson around, they could suppress the entire Rivertown even without him making his moves.

“Fine!” Hu Fei curled his fingers tightly and took out a sharp machete from his back. His impassive eyes were focusing on Yan Feng.

“I’m going to attack!”

Yan Feng drew his lips into a faint smile. His body made a quick move and attacked Hu Fei like a ghostly soul.

“His move is creepy. Indeed, the disciple of the Sacred Seas of Swords!”

Hu Fei narrowed his pupils and held his machete tight as he brought it down in front of him.

The blade brought a whirling gust of wind.

Piak

But when his machete came into contact with the sword, the belt sword wrapped it like an agile snake. It went for Hu Fei’s hand and stabbed it.

“What a creepy sword!”

Hu Fei was appalled. He quickly drew his machete back, but even so, his palm got a wound that cut into his bone.

The victory was determined within a stroke.

“What a daunting young man. He possesses a Level-nine strength at such a young age. In the future, he can definitely be an Inborn Expert!”

“Too dominating! He’s only in his twenties, he is capable of defeating Hu Fei! This...”

“Unbelievable. Absolutely unbelievable. How can we resist the Yan Family?”

Everyone was dumbfounded by the scene.

“Ah!”

At the same time, Hu Fei, who had exchanged more than ten strokes, was horrified. All of a sudden, Yan Feng had another transparent soft sword in his hand. The sword went through Hu Fei’s shoulder, and his face paled after this.

“You can exchange more than twenty strokes with me. Not bad!”

Yan Feng gave Hu Fei praise.

Hu Fei’s face was ashen. He stared at Yan Feng in disbelief with his body trembling.

He was already a famous Level-nine expert!

“Hu Fei!” the leader of the Hu Family, was panicked as he ran over, “We admit our loss. We lost!”

What the leader of the Hu Family said made everyone shudder.

It’s over.

It’s completely over.

The Yan Family is unstoppable!

“Bi Family is willing to follow the lead of the Yan Family.”

“Gu Family is willing to join hands and fight along with the Yan Family!”

“I, Gu Xinghe, am willing to join the Yan Family...”

All of a sudden, some of the families and Martial Artists made their pledge to Yan Family.

The Yan Family was too strong. They were so strong that they could easily suppress everyone.

“Since the sparring has begun, let’s do a few more rounds to make those who refused to submit to us surrender!”

Suddenly, Yan Zhongyuan, who was standing in front, made his speech.

He walked out slowly and swept his cold gazes across a few people.

“He’s trying to...get rid of all his enemies!”

“Beat the dog before the lion. The Yan Family is eliminating those who have offended them!”

Everyone’s face was pale when they saw Yan Zhongyuan approaching them. They were praying that he would not look for them.

Old Xue and Old Duan saw Yan Zhongyuan looking over, and their faces were washed-out.

Both of them had grudges!
