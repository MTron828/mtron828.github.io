Chapter 863: 0864, a person from the supernatural continent

Translator: 549690339

“Wandering between light and darkness, the Walker of Light and darkness, the Reaper of slaughter.”

This was the description of the thorned dragon. Coupled with the image of the thorned dragon in his mind, Wang Xian was shocked.

“Light and darkness have two attributes at the same time. Furthermore, they are two attributes that repel each other!”

Wang Xian’s face was filled with astonishment. No wonder it could be called the strongest dragon species in assassination. When it grew up, it was able to assassinate the powerful existence of the Divine Dragon.

Just these two attributes of light and darkness represented the formidable power and potential of the thorned dragon.

It was a true king of assassination that wandered between light and darkness!

“When I completely obtained the inheritance, the strongest among the divine dragons in my mind was a five-elemental divine dragon. The rest were divine dragons with two attributes!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“There was one five elemental dragon, four or five dragons with two attributes, and the rest were all single-attribute dragons. As the strongest assassination dragon nurtured by the Dragon Palace, the Thorned Dragon could assassinate single-attribute dragons. Even two-attribute dragons have to be careful when facing thorned dragons!”

The thorned dragon only had a dozen subordinates in the five Elemental Dragon Palace.

That was because the group of Dragon Gods and Dragon Kings at that time did not obtain the insect clan’s ultimate treasure, the mother nest.

After they perished together, the group of dragon gods used their last bit of vitality to create the invincible divine dragon system and sent the mother nest into the dragon pool.

In the entire universe, only Wang Xian’s dragon pool possessed the ability of the mother nest.

“Obtaining the thorned dragon seed at this time is a huge help to me in conquering the supernatural continent. Thorned dragon seed, the most powerful assassination dragon seed. Let me see your power!”

Wang Xian smiled and said to Xiao Yu, Guan Shuqing, and the rest, “I’m going to the Dragon Pool to cultivate a member of the Dragon Palace!”

He went straight to the dragon pool and swept his gaze across the dragon pool below.

At this moment, the dragon pool contained more than 50 million dragon blood. This dragon blood could allow an ordinary member of the Dragon Palace to instantly advance to the immortal level.

“To advance to the level of a dragon seed, I need to use a member of the Dragon Clan as a carrier. Let Ao Yao give it a try. Ao Yao has already reached the first level of transcendence. I wonder how strong she will be after she advances to the level of a prickling dragon seed!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. With a thought, a bright shadow instantly appeared beside him.

The bright and eerie demon exuded a terrifying aura as it stood respectfully behind him. “Dragon King!”

“Okay, you enter the Dragon Pool!”

Wang Xian ordered Ao Yao.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao moved and entered the center of the Dragon Pool.

“Cultivate a thorny dragon seed!”

Wang Xian had a thought and immediately gave the order.

Ding! “Check the energy and attributes. Insufficient energy and insufficient attributes. Unable to cultivate a thorny dragon seed!”

“System notification. The detected attributes and energy can cultivate a thorny light dragon seed. With sufficient energy, you can cultivate a thorny dark dragon seed. Use the thorny light and thorny dark dragon seeds as treasures to cultivate a thorny dragon seed!”

Instantly, the system’s voice entered his mind, causing him to frown immediately.

“I can’t believe it can’t be cultivated yet. But that’s true. If we can cultivate a large number of dragon-prickling dragon species, that would be too insane!”

Wang Xian mumbled, “Cultivate the light-prickling dragon species!”

“Cultivate the light-prickling dragon species. Start cultivating!”

The system’s voice rang out. In an instant, the nine divine dragons on the few pillars around the dragon pool were emitting bright energy.

Rays of bright energy shot out from the dragon’s mouth.

This energy was extremely gentle. When the nine rays of light gathered together, a drop of milky-white liquid appeared at the intersection.

The liquid was like fresh blood. When this drop of white blood appeared, the light disappeared and the fresh blood slowly landed on the strange demon’s body.

“The light-pricking dragon seed should be much stronger than the strange demon’s dragon seed, right?”

Wang Xian frowned and thought to himself.

As the top dragon seed in the group of Dragon Gods, even if it was only a half-finished product, it should not be too weak.

Buzz

The moment the white blood entered Ao Yao’s body, 50 million dragon blood in the dragon pool gushed into Ao Yao’s body frantically.

A ball of milky-white energy surrounded Ao Yao.

“It will take ten days?”

Wang Xian looked at the progress and frowned slightly. Then, he could only wait.

After absorbing 50 million dragon blood in an instant, he did not know how strong the ao Yao would be after being nurtured.

...

“What is this place? Why is there another grotto-heaven behind a small cave?”

“Could it be that we encountered a fortuitous encounter? Is this the treasure vault of an ultimate powerhouse?”

“Haha, there’s Always Good fortune after surviving a great disaster. We’ve been fleeing for so long, and the opportunity that belongs to us has arrived. Wait until we obtain the invincible divine technique and treasure, then we’ll go back and suppress everything!”

At this moment, in the depths of the ocean, in front of the passage that had once been opened by the Empress Feng Luan, more than ten figures suddenly appeared. They nervously looked around and then shouted excitedly.

They had originally been chased and fled to the sea and were chased by sea beasts. They had originally thought that it would be so, but they didn’t expect to come here.

It was a completely different world!

“Haha, the Heavens have treated us well!”

In the middle, a burly middle-aged man whose upper body was naked and covered in blood scars revealed an excited expression as he shouted loudly.

“Be careful, the treasure isn’t so easy to obtain. With our strength, the possibility of dying here is very high!”

A youth with a cold expression reminded them softly.

“Who is it?”

Just as they were talking, a two meter tall creature holding a fork with a cold expression suddenly swam over and warned them.

“Oh? What Creature?”

“So weak!”

“What is it saying?”

More than ten people stared at the strange aquatic creature in front of them in surprise.

“Activate the voice of the Soul!”

The cold-looking young man reminded them.

The hearts of the surrounding people were stirred as a glimmer of light flashed across their eyes.

“We are from the transcendence continent, the radiant saint mercenary group. What is this place?”

The cold-looking young man stared at the strange creature in front of him with a twinkle in his eyes!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

At this moment, more and more of these strange creatures came over. These creatures were naturally the yakshas.

This place was the entrance to the extraordinary world. Wang Xian had sent over a dozen yakshas to patrol this place.

Over a dozen yakshas were all immortals.

“The Extraordinary World?”

When the Yakshas heard their words, they were slightly shocked.

The civil officials in the Dragon Palace had told them some things about the extraordinary world. Naturally, they knew about it.

The Yakshas didn’t expect that the other party was actually from the extraordinary continent, and their eyes were full of vigilance.

“They should be just some small water tribe. Kill them. After all, we are outsiders, and the water area is under the control of the Dragon tribe. They are not very friendly to us humans!”

A middle-aged man among the dozen or so people suddenly said.

The surrounding people hesitated slightly, and the middle-aged man in the middle hesitated for a moment. “We’ll talk after we extract a confession!”

He said, with a wave of his arm, directly toward the Yaksha to grab.
