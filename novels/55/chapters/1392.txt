Chapter 1393: What could 1393 compare with? Let’s go

In front of the Gilded Gold clan’s mansion, Duan Jinming bowed respectfully.

Standing in front of the mansion, the Gilded Gold clan’s patriarch and the Gilded Gold clan’s people revealed satisfied expressions.

Although the fire hammer clan didn’t have a good background in the past, this couldn’t conceal the fact that Duan Jinming was a profound void martial stage expert.

For a profound void martial stage expert to come here so respectfully to propose marriage, his sincerity was enough.

“Haha, Good, good. You Don’t have to be so courteous, nephew. I have long seen your imposing manner in the past. You will definitely become a great talent in the future. I didn’t expect that you would be able to change my opinion of you in just a few days. Good, good!”

The leader of the gilded gold tribe shouted in satisfaction when he saw how respectful Duan Jinming was.

“Let’s go, my friends from the Fire Hammer tribe. Let’s talk inside. Let’s talk inside!”

He invited them with a loud laugh. His eyes sparkled as he looked at Wang Xian and the rest in the middle.

“Alright, Bring the gifts. Let’s Go!”

The Fire Hammer clan leader was full of smiles when he saw this scene. He shouted at the clansmen behind him.

“It seems like the marriage between the Fire Hammer clan and the Gilded Gold clan is going to be a success!”

“100% success. The Fire Hammer clan is no longer the fire hammer clan of the past!”

“Those humans in the middle should be from the dragon-phoenix Dynasty!”

When the surrounding people saw this scene, they all looked on with smiles on their faces.

“Lady Gilded Gold, your gilded gold clan is so lively today!”

At this moment, a slightly shrill voice was heard, causing everyone to be slightly stunned.

“Eh? That? Liu clan’s people, Liu clan’s Patriarch’s wife!”

“Liu clan’s people, and there are many of them. What are they doing here?”

Everyone looked over and were slightly stunned.

Even everyone from the gilded gold clan looked over in astonishment. When they saw dozens of Liu clan’s people walking over, their faces were filled with astonishment.

The leader was Liu clan’s Patriarch’s wife. Beside him was Liu clan’s eldest young master, Liu clan’s second master.

“Mrs. Liu, second master Liu, what are you doing here?”

The head of the gilded gold family immediately smiled and walked over respectfully.

The Liu family of Xiaoyao city was a top family in the weapons district. There was a fourth-level profound void martial stage powerhouse in the family. The head of the family and second master Liu were both third-level profound void martial stage powerhouses!

The power of the Liu family was completely incomparable to the gilded gold family.

“Patriarch Gilded Gold, what are you doing?”

Madam Liu looked around with a smile and asked indifferently.

“Hehe, the fire hammer family has come to our gilded gold family to propose marriage!”

Seeing Madam Liu’s cold eyes, patriarch gilded gold frowned and said quickly.

“Propose marriage? That lowly race of the fire hammer family has actually proposed marriage to you. We can’t agree to it!”

When madam Liu heard his words, she slightly raised her eyebrows and her sharp voice continued to ring out in the surroundings.

“HMM?”

Her words caused everyone in the surroundings to be slightly stunned.

The faces of the members of the Fire Hammer clan were somewhat embarrassed, and they were incomparably furious in their hearts.

“Hehe, you can’t say that. Duan Jinming, this young fellow, has advanced to the profound void stage and is also an expert. If he came to propose marriage... Hehe!”

The leader of the gilded gold tribe said with an apologetic smile. In his heart, he was a little puzzled as to why the Liu tribe was targeting the fire hammer tribe!

“Aiya, Madam Liu, I don’t know why you have brought so many people to our gilded gold mansion. If you have something to say, please ask your sister. I will go to the Liu mansion to look for you!”

At the back, Madam Gilded Gold saw this scene and frowned. She quickly said with an apologetic smile.

“It’s nothing. It’s just that your third miss is really in demand!”

Mrs. Liu looked at Mrs. Gilded Gold and said with a deep meaning.

“Mrs. Liu, what do you mean?”

Mrs. Gilded Gold asked with a smile on her face.

“Mrs. Gilded Gold told me a few days ago. After my shaohua and I considered it, we agreed to it. Today, we came to propose marriage to you. I didn’t expect that someone would come to propose marriage to you!”

Mrs. Liu stared at Mrs. Gilded Gold with a smile on her face.

“What? Mrs. Liu, what do you mean?”

Mrs. Gilded Gold was slightly stunned. She showed a surprised look and slowly frowned.

“Mrs. Gilded Gold told me not long ago about your third miss and our Shaohua. She Won’t go back on her words, right? We are here to propose marriage today!”

Madam Liu said indifferently with a smile on her face.

Madam Liu’s words caused everyone around to be slightly stunned.

“This... The Liu family is also here to propose a marriage, this...”

“No Way, the Liu family is also here to propose a marriage. Then... What about the fire hammer family? The fire hammer family is far inferior to the Liu Family!”

The people gathered around looked at the Liu family members in astonishment, then looked at the fire hammer family members.

At this moment, all the members of the Fire Hammer family looked extremely embarrassed. Duan Jinming clenched his fists tightly.

“This...”

Lady Gilded Gold also frowned. They had just accepted the fire hammer family. Most importantly, her daughter liked that kid from the fire hammer family.

However, compared to the fire hammer family, the Liu family was undoubtedly more powerful. They also had an extremely high status in Xiaoyao city.

Lady Gilded Gold looked at her husband.

The Gilded Gold clan leader also slightly frowned. They never expected that Lady Liu, who had obviously not agreed to this marriage a few days ago, would actually directly propose the marriage today!

This caught them somewhat unprepared.

“Lady Gilded Gold, you won’t go back on your words, right? You Won’t play tricks on people, right?”

Mrs Liu saw them furrowing their brows and faintly forced them.

Playing tricks on their Liu clan, the consequences were clear to everyone.

“Gilded Gold clan leader, Mrs Gilded Gold, Miss Yan Yan is incomparably beautiful. I want to marry her as a concubine. Today, I beg my mother to come and propose marriage to the Gilded Gold clan. I hope uncle and aunt will agree!”

Liu Shaohua, who was standing at the side, slightly raised the corners of his mouth. He took a step forward and faintly said.

“As a concubine?”

Liu Shaohua’s words caused the expressions of the gilded gold tribe leader and Madam to slightly change.

He was actually marrying her as a concubine and not as a wife.

“Don’t worry, Gilded Gold tribe leader. Our Liu family will not mistreat Yanyan. Yanyan is a good girl. No matter how you look at it, Yanyan is my son’s first legitimate wife!”

Madam Liu said with a smile on her face.

“Father, mother, I want to marry Brother Jinming. I don’t want to...”

At the back, Yanyan anxiously walked over and said in a low voice. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Not long ago, she knew that her parents wanted her to marry the eldest son of the Liu family. However, the other party did not seem to agree at first.

This made her sigh in relief. However, she did not expect that the other party would actually come to propose marriage today.

“HMM? Yan Yan, don’t be deceived at such a young age. What right does a lowly demonic beast race have to be compared to our Liu Family? Compared to our youth, you are still young and insensible!”

Madam Liu’s eyes were filled with displeasure when she heard Gilded Yan’s words. She said coldly.

“Gilded Yan, you should be happy that I’m marrying you as a concubine. Today, I and the people of our Liu family came to propose marriage personally. Your Gilded Gold family will not reject US and agree to a lowly demonic beast race, right?”

Liu Shaohua’s lips curled up slightly at the side.

He swept a disdainful glance at Duan Jinming, the fire hammer clan, and even Wang Xian!
