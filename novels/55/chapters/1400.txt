Chapter 1401: 1401 members of the Dragon Palace came to pick up the brothers and bring them home

“What? Father, destroy the dragon-phoenix dynasty?”

Everyone was stunned, including the young city Lord.

Destroying an entire dynasty? His father was too domineering!

“Although our Xiaoyao city has always been neutral, we can’t offend just any faction. In the past hundred years, our Xiaoyao City has never interfered with the matters of any dynasty or sect!”

“We also adhere to this principle. However, not taking action does not mean that we are easy to bully. Since the Xiaoyao Order has been issued, let’s destroy the dragon-phoenix Dynasty!”

The city lord of Xiaoyao City said with a calm expression.

It was as if destroying an incomparably powerful dragon-phoenix dynasty was as easy as killing an ant.

“Damn, the city lord of Xiaoyao city is simply too domineering. He opened his mouth and wanted to destroy the dragon-phoenix Dynasty!”

“This is a true overlord. Destroying the dragon-phoenix dynasty is such an understatement!”

“Powerful, powerful, as expected of the city lord of Xiaoyao City. He is a peerless expert within a 100,000-kilometer radius!”

“The dragon-phoenix dynasty is the strongest dynasty within a 100,000-kilometer radius. I didn’t expect the city lord of Xiaoyao City to destroy it so easily!”

Everyone looked at the city lord of Xiaoyao city with admiration and respect, their eyes shining.

“If the dragon-phoenix dynasty is destroyed...”

The eyes of some of the dynasty’s experts and even the dynasty’s kings were shining.

“Lord City Lord of Xiaoyao City, the dragon-phoenix Dynasty has offended the young city lord. Our Jinliang dynasty is willing to lead troops for Xiaoyao City!”

“Just take it as avenging the son-in-law of the young city lord. I also hope that my daughter and the young city Lord will be happy in the future!”

At this moment, not far from the young city Lord, a middle-aged man suddenly bowed and said loudly with a smile on his face.

Beside the middle-aged man was a woman. That woman was the princess who had been following the young city lord for the past few days.

And the middle-aged man was the king of the Jin Liang dynasty.

“Hehe, good!”

Hearing the words of the king of the Jin Liang Dynasty, the Xiaoyao City Lord revealed a smile on his face and nodded slowly.

Leading troops to destroy the dragon-phoenix dynasty together with Xiaoyao City was a great thing.

Xiaoyao city was neutral and did not establish a state. The destroyed city of the dragon-phoenix dynasty naturally became ownerless.

If the Jin Liang dynasty followed Xiaoyao City, the city of the dragon-phoenix dynasty would naturally belong to Xiaoyao City!

“Thank you, Father-in-law!”

The young city Lord said to the Jinliang dynasty’s king with a smile.

“Haha, no need, no need! Family, Family!”

King Jinliang laughed happily.

“Xiaoyao City Lord, our nine Heavens Dynasty is willing to fight for Xiaoyao city and destroy the ungrateful dragon-phoenix Dynasty!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Xiaoyao City Lord, our Black Phoenix dynasty is willing to fight for Xiaoyao City and destroy the dragon-phoenix Dynasty!”

“Our ice map empire is also willing to fight for Xiaoyao City and destroy the dragon-phoenix Empire!”

“Haha, Xiaoyao City Lord, there’s no need for your Xiaoyao City to make a move. If our empires join forces, we can destroy the dragon-phoenix Empire!”

Seeing the Jin Liang Empire make a move, the eyes of all the empires lit up as they said loudly.

The dragon-phoenix Empire was the most powerful empire within a hundred thousand kilometers. They had just destroyed four empires, and they could be said to be extremely rich.

From the king’s auction this time, it could be seen that they would spend trillions of middle-grade spirit stones without even blinking!

Now that Xiaoyao City wanted to destroy the dragon-phoenix dynasty, the Dragon-phoenix dynasty would naturally die.

If they could use this opportunity to obtain a few cities, it would be a huge profit.

Building a city would at least cost trillions of middle-grade spirit stones.

Seeing that the Jinliang dynasty had joined in, they naturally wanted a share.

In an instant, eight to nine dynasties wanted a share!

“These bastards, each one more shrewd than the last!”

King Jinliang’s face turned dark as he coldly swept his gaze across the dynasties that had spoken. He was extremely furious.

“Haha, Good, good. Then our Xiaoyao City will continue to transcend the mortal world. I will send a few people. This time, the Jinliang dynasty will be the main force!”

The Xiaoyao City Lord laughed heartily and nodded his head in satisfaction.

“Yes, yes!”

The experts from the various dynasties looked at each other and revealed a smile.

King Jinliang’s expression became slightly better.

“Is this the city Lord’s prestige? The powerful dragon-phoenix dynasty. Xiaoyao city might not even need to make a move to have a bunch of dynasties agree and be sentenced to death!”

“The city Lord merely said that he wanted to destroy the Dragon and Phoenix Empire. Without the need for Xiaoyao city to make a move, a bunch of empires are already willing to step out and destroy it. How terrifying!”

Exclamations came from the surroundings. Regardless of whether it was the people from the outside or the people in Xiaoyao city, all of them were filled with shock.

This was the city lord of Xiaoyao City, a peerless expert!

“Haha, everything will be according to Father’s decision!”

The young mayor also laughed out loud with excitement.

He slowly narrowed his eyes and looked at Wang Xian and the rest.

“If that’s the case, then everyone from the Dragon and Phoenix Empire Shall Die!”

“That despicable race of the fire hammer clan shall be exterminated!”

“After killing them, the entire dragon and Phoenix Empire shall be exterminated!”

“This is the final judgment!”

The young mayor slowly took a few steps forward and growled in a low voice.

“Get Ready, leave no one alive!”

“Exterminate this lowly race, the Fire Hammer clan!”

One after another, weapons appeared in the hands of the insightful emptiness realm experts.

“Weng!”

Nearly sixty insightful emptiness realm experts from the carefree city directly flew into the sky, emitting a terrifying killing intent.

“It’s over, it’s over, this girl, Yanyan!”

At the position of the Gilded Gold Clan, Lady Gilded Gold’s body was trembling as she looked at her stubborn daughter, covering her face as she cried.

“Mother, don’t be sad. It’s all third sister’s fault for being obsessed. If it wasn’t for her, this wouldn’t have happened!”

“That’s right. In the future, our gilded gold family will have a hard time in Xiaoyao city. It’s all third sister’s fault. Seriously!”

On the side, Gilded Gold’s eldest sister and second brother comforted their mother. They glared angrily at Gilded Gold’s pale face in the center.

“Brother Jin Ming, it’s all my fault. It’s all my fault. It’s all my fault!”

In the middle, Jin Jin Yan’s face was pale. Tears were streaming down his face as he grabbed his clothes and whispered.

“Let’s fight it out with them!”

“That’s right. Let’s fight it out with them. None of us from the Fire Hammer Clan are afraid of Death!”

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

More than 2,000 members of the Fire Hammer clan saw nearly 60 terrifying powerhouses staring at them with murderous intent.

Their bodies trembled as they surrounded Wang Xian and the rest in the center and shouted loudly.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian looked around when he saw this scene. His eyes were filled with satisfaction and endless coldness.

“Dragon King, the members of the Dragon Palace are here!”

At this moment, a strange voice came from the side.

“Perfect. Since we are here, let’s begin the trial!”

Wang Xian stood there and stared coldly at the mayor of Xiaoyao City who was in the sky.

“HMPH, what a despicable race. They sure have guts. Kill them all!”

The young mayor stood in the middle and raised his head slightly. His face was filled with disdain and contempt as he looked at everyone from the Fire Hammer clan.

Each and every one of them was at the fourth or fifth level of transcendence. In his eyes, they were like trash.

How dare they resist? They didn’t even know death!

“Yes, kill those lowlifes from the fire hammer clan, and then kill those people from the dragon-phoenix dynasty who are looking for death!”

The fourth rank of the profound void realm expert from the Liu clan shouted.

“Members of the Dragon Palace, come and take our brothers home!”

Take Our Brothers Home!

However, at this moment, a cold voice suddenly sounded!
