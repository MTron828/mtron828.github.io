Chapter 1472: 1472 was not a dragon but a river

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

When the deacon’s terrified voice resounded through the sky high sword sect, the entire sword sect was filled with experts flying over.

All of them were dressed in golden clothes. Some were flying on swords while others were flying in the air.

They held long swords in their hands and their bodies were filled with sword qi.

At this moment, it was as if tens of thousands of long swords were shooting towards them.

“Hiss! There might be a battle coming up, let’s retreat quickly!”

“It should be a massacre. The sect master of the towering Sky Sword sect is here, and there are also a group of experts!”

“More than ten thousand elite disciples and more than a thousand insightful void realm experts are all here!”

“Other than the two sword masters, the entire towering sky sword sect should be mobilized. After all, this is the entrance of the towering sky sword sect. If someone dares to cause trouble at their entrance, they will naturally all be mobilized!”

“I’m afraid that it will be a massacre!”

When the surrounding aristocratic families saw the dense crowd of experts and disciples flying out of the towering sky sword peak, their faces were filled with shock.

As the only second-rate force within a radius of a thousand miles, the strength of the towering sky sword sect was unquestionable.

In the entire vast region, there weren’t many forces that could challenge the towering sky sword sect, let alone a force that came from the flowing sea region!

“Who are you? How dare you kill an elder of our sect in front of the towering sky sword sect? State your name and we will erect a tombstone for you!”

A sonorous and cold voice came from the mouth of an elder in the middle.

Two three-meter-long giant swords were suspended above the head of the Elder. He looked at Wang Xian and the rest with murderous intent.

“Reporting to sect master, it’s them. They are the ones who killed elder qi and the other two. They are in cahoots!”

A middle-aged deacon heaved a sigh of relief when he saw everyone from the sect. He quickly pointed at the three golden swordfish, Wang Xian, and the rest.

The three elders were killed, catching everyone off guard.

Their elders were actually killed by a swordsman of the same level in less than two minutes.

One had to know that their sky high sword sect was a great sword sect with a complete heritage. There were few who could match up to a swordsman of the same level.

Furthermore, they were fighting against swordsmen of the same level.

However, the strength displayed by the other party shocked them.

“It’s all of you...”

“Shut up. Kill three elders of our sky high sword sect. Kill them all!”

Just as Wang Xian was about to speak, the sect master of Sky High Sword Sect, who was standing in the middle, shouted coldly.

“Kill!”

“Those who offend our towering Sky Sword sect will die!”

“Kill!”

Behind the sect master of the towering Sky Sword sect, more than 1,000 insightful emptiness realm experts roared in a low voice. Behind them, more than 10,000 disciples roared with murderous intent.

Those who dared to kill the elders of the towering sky sword sect would only end up dead.

They didn’t need to understand anything else and didn’t listen to any explanations.

“Report your forces. Not only do we have to kill you, but your sects and dynasties will also have to pay the price!”

An elder at level six of the Seethrough Void took a step forward and roared at Wang Xian and the rest with a grim expression.

“Dead people, there’s no need to know too much!”

Wang Xian looked at the extremely powerful towering sky sword sect and his expression turned cold. He raised his head slightly and swept his gaze across the tens of thousands of them.

“Kill!”

An order was given!

Kill!

Since all of you are so overbearing, let’s see the truth in the slaughter!

“Kill!”

Ao Jian and the golden swordfish behind him shouted with an expressionless face.

Their voice was like a sharp sword that was unsheathed. The Aura on their bodies was greatly boosted as they attacked the tens of thousands of people from towering sky sword sect.

There was no fear in their eyes. Their eyes were extremely cold.

Kill!

“What?”

All the people of the towering sky sword sect were also stunned when they saw Ao Jian and his group of two hundred charging over.

They felt the icy cold aura and the cold sword ray, and their expressions changed slightly.

“Two hundred insightful void realm experts!”

An elder of the towering sky sword sect felt the aura charging over from the front, and a trace of solemnity appeared on his face.

“Sect master, they are the forces of the Liuhai Region!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The deacon beside him roared loudly.

“The forces of the flowing sea region dare to be so arrogant? Kill them all! Kill them all!”

“Leave no one alive!”

The sect master of the towering Sky Sword sect had an ugly expression on his face when he saw Ao Jian and the others charging straight at them.

They dared to attack them arrogantly with only 200 people. They simply did not put the towering sky sword sect in their eyes.

“Kill, kill this group of frogs at the bottom of the well!”

“Trash from the flowing sea region, how dare they challenge our Sky High Sword sect. Kill them all!”

The sky high sword sect elders shouted with cold faces.

“Kill!”

A great battle was about to break out!

“My God, those two hundred expressionless swordsmen are all insightful emptiness realm experts!”

“Two hundred, it’s actually two hundred insightful emptiness realm experts, but Atlas sect has a thousand!”

When all the surrounding aristocratic families saw the sudden outbreak of war, their expressions changed drastically, and they quickly led their clansmen to retreat.

This motherf * cker, Atlas Sword Sect’s sect master was incomparably domineering, he did not even ask for a reason and directly ordered the execution.

However, the other party was not to be trifled with, he directly ordered the execution.

From the moment everyone from the towering sky sword sect came out to attack, less than 30 seconds had passed.

“Dharma Idol: Bloodless Sword!”

Ao Jian and 200 others rushed toward the towering sky sword sect. They did not hesitate at all and used their dharma idol instantly.

Out of the 200 golden swordfish, the weakest one could kill a level 3 profound void martial artist, while the strongest ao Jian could kill a level 6 profound void martial artist.

This power was definitely not weak.

Not counting the rank 5 and rank 6 insightful void martial artists, the towering Sky Sword sect was no match at all.

Although they had 1,000 insightful void martial artists, more than 900 of them were rank 1 and rank 2 insightful void martial artists, while the rest were only rank 3 and above.

When the dazzling golden hiltless sword instantly appeared in front of the group of Golden Swordfish.

Each sword was 1,000 meters long, but only as wide as an arm.

The terrifying sharpness directly charged toward the towering sky sword sect.

“What?”

The sect master of the towering Sky Sword sect looked at the two hundred identical dharma images and felt the bone-piercing sword light on them. His expression finally changed drastically.

“Disciples of the towering sky sword sect, be careful. The opponent’s strength is at least at the third level of the Profound Void Stage!”

“His strength has not reached the profound void stage yet. Retreat!”

He hurriedly shouted loudly. Two hundred experts at least at the third level of the profound void stage. In a battle of this level, those below the profound void stage could not interfere at all!

“The lowest level is the third level of the profound void Martial Stage!”

Hearing the sect master’s words, the expressions of all the disciples changed greatly, and even the pupils of some profound void martial stage experts shrunk slightly.

“Defend!”

However, at this time, there was no time for them to think. Facing those peculiar bloodless swords, the group of experts from the towering Sky Sword sect hurriedly roared, brandished their resplendent attacks, and directly welcomed them.

However, it was too late for them to escape.

The bloodless swords covered everyone in the towering sky sword sect.

“Aspect, sword edge protection!”

“Aspect, sword edge protection!”

The expressions of the ten rank 6 profound void martial artists in the towering Sky Sword sect turned cold as they shouted in unison.

Aspect, sword edge protection.

A protective aspect comprehended at rank 6 profound void martial artist!

Ten Dharma idols enveloped everyone in the sword sect!

With ten guardian Dharma Idols, the sect master of the towering sky sword sect was confident that he could block the attacks of 200 dharma idols at rank 3 profound void martial stage.

“Pa! PA! Pa!”

However, the moment the sword edge protection was formed, the sound of shattering was immediately heard.

A black and white cross easily pierced through the moment the Dharma Idol was formed!

Many people didn’t even see the black and white cross.

“Oh no, there’s an expert!”

“Lord Sword Master, Save Me!”

The Sky High Sword Sect’s sect master’s expression changed drastically as he shouted loudly!
