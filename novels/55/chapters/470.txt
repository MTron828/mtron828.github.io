Chapter 471: Fire Demons

Fire God’s Graveyard was situated at the top of an active Fire Spirit Volcano.

Nearing this area, one could feel the immense heat coming from there.

Five people stood at the deck of the vessel without a word. Wang Xian cast a look at them. Somehow, he felt that there was something queer about them.

It was as though they were going in for the last fighting chance.

Five of them dressed in oversized clothes with a rain hat on them, and it was hard to distinguish the genders.

But that did not bother Wang Xian. He joined the team to hunt for treasures and the fire-attributed Art of Cultivation. Since they had the map and experience, it would be a lot easier.

“Who’s there?”

A loud cry was heard when the yacht arrived at the Fire Spirit Island.

A dozen young men in local attire glared at them coldly.

They had weapons that were not the usual firearms. The gun muzzle was about half a centimeter, which looked threatening.

“We’re going in!”

The five people tossed the tokens one by one, while a middle-aged man gestured as soon as he saw the tokens.

“Let’s go!”

The five of them called out to Wang Xian and leaped off to the ground. They went ahead with a clear sense of direction.

One side of the island was well presented in front of them as soon as they arrived at the island.

The ground was pitch-black in color with terrifying magma rocks at the side. The temperature over here was at least seventy to eighty degrees.

There was no way for ordinary people to stay here.

“This is...?”

When Wang Xian came to the nearest volcano, he was taken aback by what he saw.

There were ten volcanoes on the entire Fire Spirit Island, and the streams of lava flowing through each of them were connected.

On the mountain before them was written three blazing words: ‘Fire God Palace.’ The words were burning, and thus, looked extremely impressive.

The entrance was twenty meters wide and twenty meters tall.

Part of it had collapsed.

Five of them went ahead with a blue glow being exuded from their bodies to fend off the scorching heat.

Wang Xian followed along until nine huge entrances appeared before them.

Before the entrance stood over thirty people in different attires, looking at the nine separate entrances.

“Another few are here to die!”

“A bunch of weak trashes are hoping to go in with a fancy dream about taking the Fire God legacy, huh!”

Several Martial Artists in white outfits with a black flame on them scoffed at Wang Xian and the gang coldly.

“Let’s go!”

As Wang Xian turned to them, the five people quickly instructed him and entered into one of the caves.

The cave entrance was five meters wide. Upon their entering, the temperature shot up to ten times higher to a temperature of at least seven hundred degrees.

Martial Artists below Level 9 would definitely die if they entered this place.

“Don’t provoke the other eight forces. Otherwise, they can just kill you straight away.”

“The Fire God’s Graveyard was the former Fire God Palace. The palace was divided into nine halls with a main hall that spanned a fifteen-kilometer surface area. It was two times bigger than what the rumors said. Apart from this, the palace had two stories.”

“One of the entrances will lead to the side hall, and thereafter the main hall. Each side hall has treasures. But to date, none of the forces have ever made it to the main hall, not even the side ones either!”

The five young people removed their rain hats and tossed them aside.

The rain hat immediately burst into flames, being reduced to ashes. They took off their oversized clothes, revealing pastel blue uniforms. On their uniforms, there were dots of glows.

The only girl among them wore a pastel blue face veil.

“Here!”

The young man in the middle handed something to Wang Xian. He received and took a look.

“Hur?”

[Aqua Star: Level 10]

“This is a precious item from our family. If we can leave this place, you have to return this to us. This is Aqua Star, aka a Hexa-star!”

As the young man spoke, he took out another one as well. All five of them had one each.

“When the six of us stand in a hexagon, the water-energy will be connected, and we can explode Half-Step to Dan Realm’s strength. On top of that, if any one of us is in danger, this will allow us to support each other instantaneously.”

“In the Fire God Palace, there are countless Fire Demons. These Fire Demons are similar to any ferocious beasts with a mighty strength. As a place for God, some existences are one level lower than him. Every side hall has two Dan Realm Fire Demons!”

“Oh? Two Dan Realms? If there are only two Dan Realms, why couldn’t those powerful forces enter till now?” asked Wang Xian with his eyebrow raised.

“Apart from the Dan Realm Fire Demons, there are many, close to eighty Inborn Fire Demons around. These Fire Demons could be comparable to Dan Realm Experts already. Besides, it is extremely difficult to exterminate the Fire Demons in the palace. Hence, two Inborn Experts are required to suppress one Fire Demon. After all, this is the Fire God Palace. Fire Demons in here will have a huge boost to their strength!” the young man explained to Wang Xian.

“Has anyone taken any treasures from the Fire God Palace before?” asked Wang Xian, with his curiosity piqued.

“Yes, this is a palace of the Fire God with many treasures in it. Someone even obtained Spiritual Flame Ball, Fire Spiritual Grass, and even Heavenly Flame before. As a result, this place attracted eight supreme-class forces from Asia within a day!”

The young man continued, “Later, we will have to depend on our own strength for the treasures. Of course, we can divide out those that are easily obtained. I have a map here that states the distribution of those Fire Demons. Follow us!”

“Sure!” Wang Xian nodded, took the Aqua Star, and stood in his position.

The rest of them also remained at their specific positions with that girl in the middle.

Om!

Wang Xian injected the energy of the Water Dragon. At once, the Aqua Stars connected together. He could sense the ability to mobilize the compelling energies from the other five people.

What an amazing Aqua Star. It can allow an Inborn Expert to explode with Half-Step to Dan Realm strength!

Wang Xian pondered to himself.

“Let’s go, and keep in the hexagon position, or else it will be ineffective!”

The young man beckoned to Wang Xian, and the group moved forward.

These people are quite good.

Wang Xian remained in the last position, where he did not have to deal with first-hand dangers.

“Be careful. It’s the pool of lava ahead. There could be Fire Demons sprouting out from there.”

They continued forward where it got spacious at about fifty meters ahead.

A space of about a one kilometer radius, which was twenty meters tall at the ceiling, emerged. Below that spot was rumbling lava that was bubbling with terrifying heat.

Some rocks lined up as steps in the middle.

Wang Xian noticed a Fire Demon bubbling out from the left of the lava pool.

Its body was made up of lava rocks with a pair of pitch-black eyes, exuding a daunting temperature.

Beside the Fire Demon was a fiery-red lotus flower. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“That’s the Fire Demon. This pool of lava should be the spiritual medicine garden with fire-attributed Spiritual Grass growing in it. That fiery-red lotus flower is known as the Flaming Lotus, a Level 5 Spiritual Grass!”
