“So Strong!”

“So terrifying!”

“Instantly killing a level 8 abyss seed!”

When the Undying Level 8 abyss seed was killed, it was at the back!

The Beichuan sect members were the first to rush out because of the Dragon Palace and Dragon Mountain, they hadn’t clashed with the abyss seed yet!

Right now, the group of undying with better eyesight saw the terrifying attack from the Dragon Palace, it landed directly on the Undying Level 8 abyss seed!

Two attacks, along with the strange black and White Shadow, instantly killed it!

The undying level 8 seed was instantly killed, this power was truly terrifying!

Even with all the warriors of the North River sect gathered, it was hard to do!

“Sou Sou Sou!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

However very quickly, they saw terrifying arrows flying towards the countless seeds!

“Pu Pu Pu!”

The next moment, they saw countless powerful arrows piercing through the powerful abyss species!

Just one round of attacks, at least hundreds of thousands of abyss species were killed!

Also, the Bei Chuan clan elders realized that in that round of arrows, over 200 undying god King level abyss species were killed!

This level of strength?

“Hiss, this dragon palace is even stronger than the last time, how can our bei Chuan clan compare?”

Some of the bei Chuan clan warriors stared blankly!

“Sou Sou Sou!”

The second round of attacks began, countless arrows pierced through the abyss seeds!

There were 2,000 undying god King level warriors in the Sky Eye Arrows, with rounds after rounds of attacks, even the undying god King Abyss seeds couldn’t block them!

The arrows were reaping the lives of the Immortal King Abyss seed!

At the side, the level 8 immortal King Abyss seed was terrified when it saw the terrifying attack power of the Dragon Peak!

It let out a low roar in panic and immediately fled into the distance!

“They escaped?”

Wang Xian, who was standing on the command platform, frowned slightly when he saw this scene!

“Strange Demons, move out! Don’t let them all escape!”

Wang Xian pondered for a moment before giving an order!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

A voice was heard. The thorned dragon immediately flew out of the Dragon Peak and headed outside to kill the abyssal seeds that were trying to escape!

“There are 13 level 7 immortal god King abyssal seeds. We can’t let them escape!”

The Heaven Array mumbled and controlled the Dragon Peak to fly into the abyssal seeds!

“This... is so powerful!”

Bei Shuang, who was standing beside Wang Xian, was shocked when she saw this scene!

She didn’t expect the Dragon Palace to be so powerful!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Roar Roar Roar!”

When the Dragon Palace rushed straight towards the densely packed abyssal seeds, it triggered the fury of countless abyssal seeds!

They charged straight towards the Dragon Peak. If there were one to two million of them just now, then there were five to six million of them attacking at the same time!

Above and below, close to 70% of the undying god Emperor Abyss species attacked!

“Very good!”

Tian Chen saw most of the abyss species attacking them, smiling!

“Fire Hammer clan, prepare to attack!”

“Sky Eye Arrow Division, kill the undying God Emperor Abyss species First!”

Tian Chen immediately ordered!

“Sou Sou Sou!”

The next moment, the Fire Hammer clan’s 1,000 fiery gold blades that were comparable to an undying god Emperor level were immediately activated!

The Heavenly Eye Arrow Division was led by Mou Zesen to lock onto the undying God Emperor Warriors!

With him, an undying level 8 warrior, killing the abyss seeds that were weaker than him was too easy!

Without being able to return to his god country in an instant, he killed one undying level 7 seed with a single arrow!

Following which, the abyssal seeds were being slaughtered at a terrifying speed!

Facing the Dragon Palace warriors within the Dragon Mountain, the abyssal seeds in this area had no way of resisting!

“Too strong, there’s no need for us to do anything!”

...

“It’s very strong, we... we basically don’t need to do anything!”

At the back, the Bei Chuan sect disciples were stunned when they saw the Dragon Mountain blocking most of the abyssal seeds!

In particular, half of the abyssal seeds that came to attack had been killed in just a few minutes!

This strength was somewhat heaven-defying!

“So powerful! We don’t need to guard this place at all!”

The bei Chuan Sect Elder’s face was full of shock. He hesitated for a moment and reported the situation to the rest of the sect!

If other places needed support, they could go over!

“HM? is the Dragon Palace that strong? They actually blocked the abyss seed on Planet Xingwen and massacred it?”

At the same time, in front of a planet near the center of the Northern Line, an elder from the Beichuan sect saw this information and was pleasantly surprised!

He looked at the battle in front of him, the sect leader and the three ancestors all attacked, fighting against the 7 undying level 8 abyss seeds!

“Elder bei, if you can help, immediately bring warriors to the center to help, we have too many abyss seeds here!”

...

The elder immediately sent a message to Elder bei!

“Leave a quarter of the disciples here to guard, the rest follow me to the center!”

After receiving the message, elder Bei looked at the Dragon Palace and Dragon Peak in front of him and immediately said to the surrounding disciples!

“Yes!”

The group of people moved and immediately rushed in another direction!

They were no longer needed here!

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

“Puff! Puff! Puff!”

Around the Dragon Peak, the members of the Dragon Palace were rapidly hunting abyssal seeds one by one!

After the strange demon moved out, its hunting speed became even more terrifying!

5 to 6 million abyss seeds might seem like a lot, but the heavenly eye arrow division could shoot up to a thousand arrows in a second, even if they killed one every second, 35,000 Heavenly Eye Arrow Division members could kill close to 2 million in a minute!

“Hehehe, after obtaining these resources, the Dragon Palace will be able to madly raise its strength again!”

The speed of the Dragon Palace’s improvement was even more terrifying!

Just the corpses in front of them could increase the combat strength of two immortal King Level 8 warriors!

As for the rest, there was no need to mention it!

In the next five minutes, the Dragon Palace destroyed seven to eight million abyss seeds!

The corpses were kept by strange demon and the rest!

“Now that it’s done, we can go to other places!”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across and squinted his eyes slightly!

“Bei Shuang, ask Bei Chuan sect which side has more abyss seeds. We will go there immediately!”

He looked at bei Shuang who was beside him and said with a smile!

“Yes, Master!”

Bei Shuang nodded and felt a little grateful in her heart!

The help from the Dragon Palace was a huge help to the bei Chuan sect!

Otherwise, who knows how many disciples of the Bei Chuan sect would have died here alone!

“Master? The center of our Beichuan sect is in danger. There are seven immortal king level eight Abyss Seeds!”

Soon, bei Shuang said to Wang Xian with a serious expression!
