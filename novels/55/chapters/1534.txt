Chapter 1535: 1535 news from Ling Jian ‘ER

The Black Curtain Garden was a treasure land in the ruins of the divine kingdom, a place of the divine kingdom’s medicinal garden.

Every time it opened, it attracted countless people to come.

The Black Curtain Garden had a special feature, forbidding cultivators above profound void tier 4 from entering.

The ruins of the divine kingdom was created by a longevity realm expert, and the order inside was set by that peerless expert.

In order to protect the spiritual herbs inside, cultivators above profound void tier 4 were forbidden to enter.

Moreover, the black curtain garden only opened once every hundred years. Every time it opened, it would attract countless people.

The once-in-a-hundred-year opportunity was naturally not missed by the outstanding disciples of the various large factions in the vast region.

Wu Qingyan and Wu Qingyan were chatting.

In the outside world, in the Divine Light Medical Hall, many people were still discussing the matter of priest Wang, the son of light, and the daughter of light.

However, the son of light, Tian Qingguang, did not immediately take revenge. In this place, the three strongest factions had set the rules.

If one wanted to fight, they had to reach ten thousand meters in the sky. They could not affect the surrounding buildings.

Other than themselves, no one dared to disobey the orders given by the three large factions.

Since Wu Qingyan didn’t make a move, Tian Qingguang naturally didn’t dare to bring anyone along.

However, due to Tian Qingguang and Wu Qingyan’s identities, all the other radiant priests loudly criticized priest Wang for being too arrogant and arrogant.

Wang Xian didn’t care about the matters in the outside world at all. He still treated patients for free during the day.

The light and darkness had already maintained a balance. At night, he would study the blending of light and darkness.

In a flash, more than ten days had passed.

Furthermore, Wang Xian had a month to treat everyone for free.

In an entire month, nearly 100,000 people had been cured by Wang Xian.

Defeating the son of light and curing nearly 100,000 people for free. In the ruins of the divine kingdom, Wang Xian’s reputation could be said to be at its peak.

However, in the world of radiant priests, priest Wang’s reputation was not that good.

“Phew, the blending of light and darkness is simple in theory, but it’s still a little difficult to do. The power of the light and Darkness Dragon Balls has yet to reach a balance!”

In the afternoon, Wang Xian sat on the balcony.

In front of him, two palm-sized divine dragons, one black and one white, were circling around.

He had been here for a month. Today, there were not many patients who needed free treatment outside.

This also made him completely free. From time to time, he would treat one or two customers who paid to see him.

Taking a sip of tea, Wang Xian kept the two light and dark divine dragons into the heart of light and dark.

At this moment, the heart of light and dark was in the shape of Tai Chi. However, what was missing were the two black and white marks.

His gaze swept across the sculptures of the girls around him and he was slightly lost in thought.

“Eh?”

Suddenly, a familiar aura appeared, causing Wang Xian to be slightly stunned.

He stood up hurriedly and swept his gaze downwards.

“That is?”

He was slightly stunned as he looked at the middle-aged man who was holding a golden longsword. A glint flashed across his eyes.

“Uncle Hu, we won’t be receiving any guests today!”

Wang Xian spoke to the outside and his figure disappeared instantly. He appeared on the street below.

Looking at the slightly tired middle-aged man in front of him, he walked over slowly.

“Sect leader Ling!”

He called out to the middle-aged man softly.

Sect leader Ling, Ling Jian ‘ER’s father.

Since Ling Jian ‘ER left, it didn’t take long for sect leader Ling to embark on the journey to find his daughter alone. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Looking at him, Wang Xian sighed silently in his heart.

Perhaps, he didn’t know yet!

“HMM?”

Sect leader Ling, who was walking on the road, heard Wang Xian’s voice and was slightly stunned. He raised his head to look at Wang Xian. Clearly, he was very stunned.

“Little brother Wang Xian!”

He walked over quickly with a face full of surprise and joy.

“Sect leader Ling, Let’s go to the teahouse to Chat!”

Wang Xian looked at sect leader Ling, who was a little travel-worn, and thought of Ling Jian ‘er. He felt a little sad and said to him.

“Good, good. I didn’t expect to meet little brother Wang Xian here. Let’s Go!”

Sect leader Ling revealed a look of surprise and joy. The two of them walked towards a teahouse at the side.

The tea was served and some side dishes were served. Wang Xian looked at the surprised sect leader Ling and didn’t know what to say?

Tell him that Ling Jian ‘Er was dead? Perhaps he would be very sad!

“I really didn’t expect you to come to the ruins of the divine kingdom, little brother Wang Xian!”

Sect leader Ling poured him a cup of tea and said with a smile.

“I was looking for Ling Jian ‘er. I came here by accident!”

Wang Xian smiled bitterly and said.

“Sigh!”

Sect leader Ling sighed heavily when he heard his words.

Wang Xian looked at him and smiled bitterly.

“I’ve found Jian ‘er!”

“What?”

At this moment, sect leader Ling’s sudden words made Wang Xian stand up in disbelief.

“Sect leader Ling, you... You’ve found her? Didn’t she already... already...”

Wang Xian stared at sect leader Ling in excitement.

“Eh? What’s wrong, little brother Wang Xian? Jian ‘ER is fine now. It’s just that she has completely forgotten about me. It’s the merciless way of the sword. Break your feelings, have feelings, and then break your feelings!”

Sect leader Ling stared at Wang Xian in astonishment and asked.

“I thought... I thought she was dead. where is she now? where is she?”

Wang Xian asked sect leader Ling in excitement.

“Jian ‘ER is fine. When I met her, she was in the Bingxin Empire and was taken in as a disciple by an expert from the Bingxin Empire!”

“When I found her, I wanted to take her away. However, she seemed to be resisting me and didn’t recognize me at all. She had completely forgotten about me as her father!”

As sect leader Ling spoke, she took a sip of tea helplessly and looked at Wang Xian. “I met little brother Wang Xian here. Perhaps, Jian ‘er still remembers you!”

“Phew!”

Wang Xian exhaled heavily. “Where is she now?”

“I don’t know either. Jian ‘er followed the experts from the Bingxin Empire to the ruins of the divine kingdom. Now, the Bingxin Empire doesn’t allow me to get close to her. However, I guess Jian ‘er should be in the base area of the Bingxin Empire’s ruins!”

Sect leader Ling said to Wang Xian.

“Don’t worry, sect leader Ling. I will bring Ling Jian ‘er back. I will let her remember everything from the past!”

Wang Xian took a deep breath and said solemnly.

“Okay!”

Sect leader Ling looked at him and nodded.

“I will go and ask about the Bingxin Empire’s base area in the ruins of the Divine Kingdom!”

As Wang Xian spoke, his figure disappeared.

Sect leader Ling saw him leave and revealed a smile. He heaved a sigh of relief.

“Sect leader Ling, I’ll get someone to arrange a place for you. I’ll bring Jian er back!”

A moment later, sect leader Ling heard Wang Xian’s voice.

At this moment, Wang Xian was heading towards the Bingxin Empire.

The bingxin empire was only 500 kilometers away from the ruins of the divine kingdom. It was very close.

And the Bingxin dynasty also had a base here in the ruins of the Kingdom of God.

After getting the news from Lao Hu, he immediately rushed over.
