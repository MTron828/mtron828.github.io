Chapter 486: Business Convention

“Why are you thinking of dragging me to a business convention?”

Wang Xian felt speechless when he received a phone call from that little brat in the afternoon.

“I’m doing this for you! I’m afraid you will be bored at night when you’re alone. Alright, alright. You can stop here. Just tell me your room number and I will go look for you when the time is right. My mum is still thinking of inviting you over for dinner to thank you for saving Sister Lingling and I. After the business convention has ended, we can all have dinner together!”

The little brat rattled on. Wang Xian thought about it for some time before agreeing.

Since he was touring around, it didn’t matter where he toured.

“Let’s go! Let’s go!”

Slightly before 6 pm, the doorbell rang. When Wang Xian opened the door of his room, he saw the brat in a lovely dress.

“Let’s go. It’s on the seventeenth floor of the hotel. I’m bringing you to see beautiful ladies!”

The little brat pulled his hands and spoke with a smile.

“Wait a minute. Let me change into different attire.”

Wang Xian put on his shoes, put on his jacket and asked, “What kind of business convention is this? What are we doing there? I hope it won’t be boring.”

“It should be fine. All the food and drinks are free. Moreover, the hotel has great facilities. Let’s go, let’s go! Stop asking!”

The little brat hurried him and said, “There will be lots of people coming today. Just the beautiful ladies you will see today will be worth the trip!”

“Let me say this in advance. If it isn’t interesting, I’m going to come back and sleep!”

Wang Xian chuckled before following her to the main banquet hall of the business convention.

Tsk!

The little brat pouted in dissatisfaction at Wang Xian. “This is a large scale business convention and all the people who are here are businessmen from all over the world and have invested in Dubai. It isn’t a particularly formal occasion and could be seen as a platform for interaction. There are also lots of wealthy families and members of the noble races from Dubai attending it!”

Mu Xiaowan was born into a family with great conditions. Although she might seem playful, she still knew a lot after being immersed in the environment.

While wearing the white dress, she looked more demure and could be considered to be a pretty girl.

Mu Xiaowan entered the place with her invitation card. When they entered, they noticed that there were lots of people who had arrived before them.

This was slightly different from the banquet back at home. In this place, most of the guys had a female companion with them.

It was so for this business convention. All the middle-aged and old men here had young female companions beside them.

There were people from Euramerica and also from Asia.

“How is it? Aren’t there lots of beautiful ladies here?” Mu Xiaowan said softly to Wang Xian.

“I’m not here to look at girls!”

Wang Xian looked around. It was a boring banquet but there was lots of food.

There were also all kinds of beverages available.

“Let’s go. Let me bring you to see my mum. My mum was still talking about thanking you personally last night!”

Mu Xiaowan pulled Wang Xian along as they walked deeper into the hall.

At that place, seven to eight middle-aged and old men sat around and were conversing happily.

“Mom, this is the uncle that saved us previously!”

Mu Xiaowan walked towards a rather slim but capable-looking lady as she shouted. The lady had short hair.

Huh?

Mu Xiaowan’s mother was taken aback and stood up immediately. After which, she explained to the rest.

“Xiaowan, this is the uncle you spoke about? He’s at most a few years older than you!”

When Mu Xiaowan’s mother saw Wang Xian, she looked him in the eyes and extended her hand with a smile. “Thank you, son, for saving my daughter previously. Since you are in Dubai, just ask Xiaowan to bring you around. If you are free, drop by and I’ll make some home-cooked food for you!”

Mu Xiaowan’s mother was an intelligent lady. She thanked Wang Xian politely with a radiant smile.

After exchanging some words, Mu Xiaowan brought Wang Xian to a rather empty corner.

“Let’s wait for Sister Lingling and the rest here.”

Mu Xiaowan brought some fruits with her. “If you want alcohol, you have to get it yourself. My mum doesn’t allow me to drink alcohol yet!”

The little brat looked more like a demure lady while sitting here as she spoke to Wang Xian.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. Soon after, more and more people entered the hotel.

Standing near the glass windows, they could see the seaview of the country. Although some were discussing some collaborations, this group of businessmen was still appreciative of the scenery.

Moreover, those who were here were the cream of the crop. Those with less than a billion in assets or even ten billion in assets would probably not be qualified to enter this place.

“Sister Lingling and the rest are here!”

Mu Xiaowan waved her hands towards the entrance. There were four guys and two girls. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Other than Tang Lingling and her boyfriend, the rather well-known star also came with a female companion.

“Look! That’s Yang Ze’s girlfriend. She’s also a star but isn’t well-known in the country. Don’t be rude!” Mu Xiaowan reminded Wang Xian.

“I don’t recognize them!”

Wang Xian took a glance and spoke with contempt.

“Are you those who intentionally spread rumors about stars?”

Seeing how Wang Xian had reacted, Mu Xiaowan joked with him.

“It’s really boring here. I might as well go back and sleep!”

“YOU...”

Mu Xiaowan gave him a glare. “Let me get Yang Ze to introduce you to a few small stars!”

“Forget about small stars. Even if they are superstars, I’m not interested!” Wang Xian chuckled. Teasing this little brat from time to time was also rather interesting.

“Xiao Wan, you guys are rather early!”

The group of young men walked over and sat beside them. They smiled as they observed Wang Xian and Mu Xiaowan.

“It’s you guys that are late!”

Mu Xiaowan asked Tang Lingling to sit beside him. Turning her attention to Yang Ze, she asked, “Superstar Yang Ze, why didn’t you bring a few more beautiful female stars along. I could have introduced them to this uncle!”

“Hehe! I don’t know many female stars!”

That young man smiled at Mu Xiaowan before turning to Wang Xian. With a cold smirk, he said, “Moreover, these stars aren’t people anyone can hope to get into contact with!”

“If you can find such a beautiful sister, our uncle wouldn’t do any worse. Uncle is much better looking than you!”

Mu Xiaowan was direct and didn’t hold back her words like a child.

“Hey, sister, you can’t just look at the appearance for a guy. You have to consider his manners, upbringing, and other things. The reason why Yang Ze has so many fans is also because of his personality!” the beautiful girl that was with Yang Ze commented.

Mu Xiaowan smiled, patted Wang Xian’s shoulders and said, “I’ll find you a first-class female star to be your girlfriend in the future!”

Wang Xian chuckled. “What’s the use of a star! A princess would be better!”

“Alright then. I’ll get you a little princess!” Mu Xiaowan chuckled.

“Pfft! Hey brother, there should be a limit to boasting! May I ask what business your family is in?’

The young man with short hair looked at Wang Xian with contempt as he questioned him.

“You gotta find a pretty princess for me. I’m a picky person!”

Wang Xian didn’t pay attention to the young man with short hair at all as he continued joking with Mu Xiaowan.

This made the young man with short hair extremely gloomy as he smiled, embarrassed.
