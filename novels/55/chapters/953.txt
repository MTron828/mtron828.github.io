Chapter 954: 0955. Someone is courting death

Translator: 549690339

The people in charge of the surrounding chambers of commerce kept talking to Father Zhou.

For a small chamber of commerce to be able to obtain the corpses of 100,000 fierce beasts from the mayor’s office made them feel very unfair.

Why did you get it?

At this time, they were even working together to get the Zhou Chamber of Commerce to take out the corpses of fierce beasts to feed the carrion crows.

Only then would they feel more at ease.

“Alright, Alright, everyone, quiet down!”

At this moment, the person in charge of the Ivy Chamber of Commerce waved his hand with a smile on his face, telling them not to speak.

The rest of the people in charge of the Chamber of Commerce immediately shut their mouths, waiting for his decision.

“Little Zhou, right? Since everyone wants your Zhou Chamber of Commerce to give more, then you should give more. Just as President Song said, if you give more, the road in the future will be wider. Your Zhou Chamber of Commerce has just started, it’s a good thing to give more!”

Director du of the Ivy Chamber of Commerce said with a smile.

Father Zhou’s face changed when he heard director Du’s words, and he clenched his fists tightly.

“What if we don’t agree?”

Zhou Han, who was standing at the side, almost exploded in anger as she said angrily.

“Our entire caravan must unite together. If we don’t agree, as long as most of the Chamber of Commerce doesn’t agree, you will be eliminated!”

As soon as Zhou Han finished her words, elder Xiao of the Xiao Chamber of Commerce said indifferently.

“Haha, that’s right. You have to think carefully. If you are kicked out of the Blackwater Swamp, it will be impossible for you to walk out of Here!”

“That’s right. President Zhou, you have to think carefully. Your Life is more important, or... Hehe!”

Several people in charge of the Chamber of Commerce said mockingly.

“You guys...”

Father Zhou’s face was extremely ugly. Zhou Han and Jin Liuyan’s bodies slightly trembled at their actions.

How could there be such a group of people in such a short time?

“Okay, I’ll pay!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Father Zhou said in a low voice with an ugly expression.

This was simply trying to force them into a desperate situation!

“Then pay 50% , and the rest of the Chamber of Commerce will split it equally!”

Supervisor du of the Ivy Chamber of Commerce said faintly.

“I...”

50% . Previously, it was 30% . Now, it had increased to 50% . Father Zhou’s eyes were slightly red.

“Let’s go. We can leave even if we don’t follow the Caravan!”

At this moment, Wang Xian, who was standing at the side, swept his gaze across them coldly and patted father Zhou’s shoulder.

“This...”

Father Zhou was stunned as he looked at Wang Xian in astonishment.

Zhou Han and Jin Liuyan were also slightly stunned. However, Jin Liuyan followed closely behind with a smile on her face. “Alright, we’ll leave by ourselves. Don’t they want to be eliminated? You guys can take care of the beasts yourselves. We’ll leave by ourselves!”

“That’s right, we’ll leave by ourselves!”

Zhou Han also tugged at her father.

“Leaving by ourselves? Are you guys courting death?”

The words of the two girls made the faces of the people in charge of the Chamber of Commerce turn ugly instantly.

“You don’t need to worry about that. You Go, we go, we go! Humph!”

Zhou Hanhan snorted and dragged her father to the back.

The managers of the Chamber of Commerce looked at each other. Their eyes were wide open, and their faces kept changing.

“This...”

The manager of the Chamber of Commerce looked very embarrassed. If the Zhou Chamber of Commerce really went their own way, then wouldn’t the beasts feeding the rotten crows be divided among them?

Moreover, if there was one less chamber of Commerce, they would have to share even more!

“Are you going to die?”

Supervisor du of the Ivy Chamber of Commerce and elder Xiao of the Xiao Chamber of Commerce also slowly looked embarrassed as they stared at them.

“It’s none of your business. If you want us to take out 30% or 50% , don’t even think about it. Humph, you go, we go, we go, we go!”

Zhou Hanhan turned her head and mocked them coldly.

“Alright, Alright!”

Supervisor du stared at them coldly.

“This damn kid!”

Elder Xiao’s gaze was on Wang Xian. If it wasn’t for that Kid from the mercenary group, the Zhou Chamber of Commerce would have agreed even if they were to give them 50% !

“Hanhan, if we leave alone, we will be eaten by the ferocious beasts before we reach Donghai City!”

Father Zhou looked at his daughter, who was holding his arm, and said with an embarrassed expression.

“Dad, with the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group here, don’t Worry!”

“Yes, uncle. Since commander Wang has spoken, we won’t have any problems from now on!”

The two girls said in succession.

A mercenary group that could destroy a transcendent-level rank 7 expert, with a transcendent-level rank 8 array formation. Speaking of which, with the protection of the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group, it was safer than following them.

“Are you sure? Without a level seven supernatural realm expert, it would be hard to return to Donghai city if we are unlucky!”

Father Zhou’s expression changed as he said with a worried expression.

“Don’t worry. We won’t risk our lives either!”

Wang Xian looked at him and said faintly.

“This... Alright!”

Father Zhou gritted his teeth. He could only trust his daughter and Wang Xian. He nodded his head heavily.

When they returned to the front of the carriage, Father Zhou explained to the few coachmen. Under their worried expressions, he gritted his teeth and nodded his head.

They could only follow the boss’s decision.

Furthermore, the boss would not joke about his own life.

“Damn it, damn it. That Bastard Brat. Now that they are separated from us, what should we do next?”

Supervisor du of the Green Vine Chamber of Commerce said with an embarrassed expression.

“Then we should do it as soon as possible. The sky will turn dark soon. In a few hours, they won’t be too far away from us!”

Elder Xiao also said with a gloomy expression.

“What’s Wrong?”

Deputy Commander Ling said with a frown when he saw the two people walking toward them with an unpleasant expression.

“The prey wants to leave us and return to the Eastern Sea Alone!”

Supervisor du said with a sullen face.

“Leaving us is simply courting death!”

Deputy Regiment Commander Ling’s eyes were cold as he said.

“Let’s Make a move tonight!”

Elder Xiao and supervisor du whispered to Deputy Regiment Commander Ling.

“We can kill them at any time. It’s very easy to kill them!”

Deputy Regiment Commander Ling grinned, his eyes revealing a cold expression.

“What? Someone isn’t following the caravan?”

“Courting death! Which Caravan is courting death? Why aren’t they following the caravan in the Blackwater Swamp? !”

“It’s those fellows at the back who are courting death. If they don’t follow our chamber of Commerce, they will soon become the food of the Crocodile Emperor!”

At this moment, when the mercenary groups heard the words of the person in charge of the Chamber of Commerce, they turned their heads in surprise. When they saw that there were only twenty or so of them, they sneered.

“How dare you leave the caravan? Just wait for your death, you bunch of Idiots!”

The leader of the mercenary group who was in front of the Zhou Chamber of Commerce’s carriage gave Wang Xian and the rest a middle finger in disdain.

Initially, they didn’t need to be at the back. Now that they needed to be at the back, they were naturally in a bad mood!

“If someone wants to die, we don’t need to care!”

A sarcastic reply came from the front.

However, when the seven to eight mercenary groups from Shenghai Town saw Wang Xian and the rest, they were slightly stunned. Their eyes were filled with astonishment.

The Immortal Phoenix mercenary group had actually left the group!

This was not good news.

However, they did not say anything. A portion of the mercenary groups here came from Donghai City. The strength of this group of mercenary groups was much stronger than them.

They did not have much say here. They kept silent!
