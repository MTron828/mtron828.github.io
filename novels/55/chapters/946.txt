“The harvest in bridge forest town this time is much more than that in Shenghai Town!”

Two days later, when Wang Xian learned that the new mayor was coming, he led the members of the Dragon Palace and left bridge forest town.

The harvest in bridge forest town these few days was not something that Shenghai town could compare to.

He assassinated two extraordinary level eight powerhouses. One of them was the Lin family of the Bridge Forest Business Association, the biggest force in bridge forest town.

The other one was the most powerful person in bridge forest town, the mayor.

These two powerhouses were notorious and had plundered a lot of money.

In their interspatial rings, Wang Xian had obtained more than 200 million middle-grade spirit stones. The other resources were worth 40 to 50 million middle-grade spirit stones.

The harvest this time was far beyond Wang Xian’s imagination.

“The fastest way to earn money is to kill and Rob. Although the dragon Spike is an assassin organization, it is somewhat similar!”

Wang Xian smiled.

All the money of Qiao Lin Town’s mayor, Lin Xiao, was stored in his interspatial ring. To a strong person, the interspatial ring on his hand was the safest place.

“With so many spiritual stones, if I were to buy elixirs and exchange them for dragon crystals, 10 million spiritual stones could be exchanged for about 7,000 dragon crystals. 100 million would be 70,000!”

“If it’s more than 200 million, at least 160,000 dragon crystals would be able to raise one’s strength to transcendent-level five. It would be able to raise all the strange demons and Golden Swordfish to transcendent-level four. It would even be able to raise one or two strange demons to transcendent-level five!”

Wang Xian calculated in his heart.

After this upgrade, his strength had increased tremendously.

This was especially so for the strange demons. In the future, even the weakest of them would be able to assassinate a transcendent level six powerhouse.

“After improving my strength, it’s time for me to head to Donghai City. The Demon Hunters Academy is about to start. With my strength, there’s nothing left for me to learn. However, some of the information there should be of great use to me!”

Wang Xian thought to himself.

When he returned, Wang Xian still took the Bridge Forest Beast Park route. The speed of his return was even faster than when he came.

In just a day’s time, Wang Xian and the rest arrived at the holy sea town.

Wang Xian headed straight for the Phoenix Elixir and weapons workshop.

Shopkeeper Liu sat in the shop while a group of customers were buying elixirs.

After the knife scar mercenary group was eliminated by Wang Xian and the rest, the life and Death Elixir Workshop and the holy item forging workshop had no way to deal with Phoenix Immortal.

Furthermore, they didn’t dare to suppress them anymore.

In fact, they were a little worried that Feng Xian would join hands with the immortal Phoenix mercenary group to suppress them.

“Captain Wang!”

When Wang Xian stepped into the shop, the waiter immediately recognized him and greeted him respectfully.

“Captain Wang, you’re here. Are you here to buy some elixirs?”

Manager Liu was excited when he saw Wang Xian. He quickly asked.

“Yes, I bought a little too much this time!”

Wang Xian walked over and said with a smile.

“A little too much?”

Manager Liu was stunned. His pupils couldn’t help but contract.

Previously, when Wang Xian came to buy elixirs, he didn’t say much even when he spent eight million middle-grade spirit stones.

Could it be this time?

A hint of excitement flashed in his eyes. “Captain Wang, please come in!”

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded and went to a living room in the shop.

Manager Liu quickly brewed a cup of tea for Wang Xian. “Leader Wang, how many spirit stones of elixirs do you want this time?”

“200 million middle-grade spirit stones of elixirs, as usual!”

Wang Xian took a sip with a smile and said.

“What?”

Manager Liu’s body trembled and his face turned red instantly. He stared at Wang Xian excitedly. “Leader Wang, how much do you want?”

“200 million middle-grade spirit stones!”

Wang Xian replied again.

“This... Alright, leader Wang. You have so many spirit stones, but we don’t have so many elixirs. Even Donghai city might not have so many. I will report this to the headquarters immediately. Please wait a moment, wait a moment!”

Manager Liu looked at Wang Xian excitedly and immediately took out his communication stone plate to contact manager Yi on the spot.

When manager Yi learned that Wang Xian was going to purchase 200 million middle-grade spirit stones for the medicinal pills, his eyes widened.

200 million middle-grade spirit stones! That was enough to purchase a few transcendent ninth-grade medicinal pills.

This was insane. This was simply insane.

However, manager Yi quickly reacted and immediately contacted his superiors.

The Phoenix Immortal medicinal pills and weapons workshop was not as powerful as the DRAKONIDS had described.

At present, they only had a firm foothold in the five kingdoms, and they hadn’t even stepped into the empire.

Compared to the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop, there was still a huge gap.

However, the Phoenix Immortal’s background was very strong, and it was established by the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan.

The Fire Cloud Sparrow didn’t belong to humans, but to the Demon Beast clan.

Demon Beasts possessed intelligence, and some demon beasts even lived with humans, and they also followed the laws of humans.

The Fire Cloud Sparrow was once the most loyal Demon Beast Tribe of the Phoenix Empire’s empress.

After the empress died, the Phoenix Empire changed its dynasty and a group of the Empress’s loyal subordinates were stripped of their rights.

After the empress died, the Fire Cloud Sparrow tribe returned to the fire cloud mountain range and lived in seclusion.

Two years ago, they suddenly appeared and established the Phoenix Immortal Pill and weapons workshop.

The current Phoenix Empire was ranked in the top three in the empire. The Fire Cloud Sparrow tribe still had some connections in the Phoenix Empire.

In addition, the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan was also very powerful. This resulted in the rapid development of the Phoenix Immortal Pill and weapons workshop.

In just over two years, it had covered the five great kingdoms. The speed was already very fast.

Wang Xian had taken out 200 million middle-grade spirit stones to buy the pills in one go. This surprised the Phoenix immortal greatly.

To be able to take out more than 200 million spirit stones in one town was very terrifying.

“Captain Wang, it just so happens that someone from our headquarters is here to buy some carcasses of ferocious beasts. The pills will be delivered within two days. Please wait a moment!”

Very soon, manager Liu replied to Wang Xian.

“Sure, just inform me directly through the communication stone plate when the time comes!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and said to them.

“Yes, yes!”

Manager Liu nodded his head respectfully.

Buying elixirs with a wave of his hand for 200 million spirit stones, this... Spending money like gold. He was just a small shopkeeper of Shenghai town, and he managed to sell over 200 million middle-grade spirit stones for elixirs in a short period of time. It was estimated that the headquarters would give him a promotion and raise his salary soon!

After shopkeeper Liu sent him out of the shop respectfully, Wang Xian walked towards his residence.

In the next two days, Wang Xian was preparing to return to the Dragon Palace.

In Qiao Lin Town, Ao Yao and the rest did not only obtain huge resources.

There were also corpses.

There were two corpses of level eight transcendents, two of level seven transcendents, more than a dozen of level six transcendents, and more than 20 of level five transcendents.

Most of them were from the Lin family.

With so many corpses, it was sufficient for an AO yao of level five transcendents to evolve once again.

After evolving, the Ao Yao would reach rank 6 transcendent. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

With the Dragonspur, he would have the strength to assassinate a rank 9 transcendent.

He could be considered a peak existence below the insightful void realm.

With the Ao Yao around, he would be safer on the transcendent continent!
