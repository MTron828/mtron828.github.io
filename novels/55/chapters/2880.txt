2881 2881 swept across the entire region

“What terrifying strength!”

At the top of the Holy Mother Holy Tower, the four first level divine emperors of the holy region stared wide-eyed at the scene.

The Divine Parasol Flame Divine Emperor was an existence on the same level as them.

However, in front of the Dragon King, he didn’t even have the strength to resist.

This caused them to be extremely shocked.

If the Dragon Dynasty attacked, they would most likely be waiting for death.

No, they would be killed before they could even react.

They had terrifying strength and speed.

“Let’s Go!”

The sacred Lord’s expression changed. He moved and flew towards the child sacred tower.

Not to mention the Dragon King’s terrifying strength, they wanted to go and take a look even if the imperial court and eight desolates had died.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

The Celestial Emperors of the Holy Region flew over quickly.

“You brought this upon yourself!”

Wang Xian looked at the two corpses and put them away.

“Dragon King, this…”

Hong Fengyan and the rest flew down. When they saw Wang Xian putting away the corpses, they were a little stunned and didn’t know what to say.

“It’s alright. I’ll just kill them. After I return this time, I’ll bring some people to the Heaven Wizard region to destroy the imperial court and the Witch Formation Association First.”

Wang Xian shook his head. He didn’t take this matter to heart at all.

Buzz

He was going to destroy the Witch Formation Association and the Imperial Court this time?

This… was such a bold statement.

However, after witnessing the Dragon King’s strength, they had a sliver of faith in him.

“Saint Lord!”

When Hong Fengyan and the rest saw the saint lord walking over, they cupped their hands and greeted him.

“This must be the Dragon King. I’ve heard so much about you. It’s a pleasure to meet you!”

The Saint Lord nodded at Hong Fengyan and looked at Wang Xian. He cupped his hands and greeted him.

“Saint Lord, it’s a pleasure to meet you!”

Wang Xian looked at the old man and cupped his hands with a smile. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“I didn’t expect the Dragon King to be so strong.”

The Saint Lord Sighed and gestured with his hand with a smile. “Since the Dragon King is here, let’s have a seat together!”

“Alright!”

Wang Xian looked at Hong Fengyan and nodded with a smile.

“Please!”

The Saint Lord extended his hand and invited him.

Wang Xian nodded and flew to the location of the Holy Mother Pagoda.

Hong Fengyan, the water god Emperor, and the rest followed behind.

Invincible in combat arts also followed behind excitedly.

“Boom!”

“Is this the strength of the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace? This is simply heaven-defying!”

“Hiss, did you hear what the Dragon King said at the end? This time, when he goes back, he will bring his men to the Heaven Magus region to exterminate the Cheng Sorcerer Association and the imperial court. His tone and Aura are unparalleled in the world!”

“How domineering! Two celestial thearchs killed him instantly. Those two celestial thearchs even threatened God Emperor Hong Feng, but the Dragon King didn’t say much and directly exterminated him. This is simply too domineering!”

“This is the aura of the leader of a faction at the peak of the resplendent starry sky. He killed him on the spot and even the celestial thearchs have to die!”

“D * mn, this is simply too domineering. His blood is boiling!”

When they saw their Saint Lord leading Wang Xian and the rest away, everyone in the surrounding holy region was in an uproar.

At this moment, they were secretly delighted.

The ascension of the Red Wind Celestial Emperor was a joyous occasion for the entire holy region. The imperial court and the eight barrens celestial emperor came to threaten them, but they were still extremely displeased.

As a result, they were also somewhat displeased with the Dragon King.

Now that they saw the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace being so powerful and awesome, it was as though they had vented their anger!

In fact, if the Dragon Palace could really destroy the imperial court and the Witch Association, the good relationship between the Red Wind Celestial Emperor and the Dragon King was actually a good thing for the holy region.

“Dragon King, your strength is truly admirable.”

At the same time, on the top floor of the Holy Mother Pagoda, the Saint Lord spoke to Wang Xian with a hint of surprise.

“I was just lucky and got some opportunities. I really admire you, Saint Lord. In this resplendent starry sky, the Holy Region is the most peaceful!”

When Wang Xian heard the Saint Lord’s praise, he also replied.

“Hehe, sometimes peace may not be a good thing. There won’t be a peerless powerhouse like you, Dragon King.”

The Holy Lord smiled and replied.

“Then you really think too highly of me, Holy Lord!”

Wang Xian smiled and shook his head. The two of them complimented each other!

“Dragon King, to be honest, I don’t think much of Your Dragon Palace since bhang and the imperial court have joined forces with the Witch Formation Association. However, now that I’ve seen your strength, it’s hard to say!”

The Holy Lord said slowly.

“I’m indeed surprised that bhang has joined the imperial court and the Witch Formation Association. However, my Dragon Palace really doesn’t put them in our eyes. If nothing goes wrong, I’ll get rid of their troubles very soon.”

Wang Xian said very calmly.

He had the confidence to say this.

After the three wind divine dragons were upgraded half a month later, the five level two divine emperors of the imperial court wouldn’t be afraid of the three major forces joining forces.

Wang Xian had even decided that he would head out to the Heaven Magus region after he returned.

At that time, Wang Xian wanted to let everyone in this resplendent starry sky know the consequences of becoming enemies with the Dragon Palace.

Wang Xian’s words stunned the Holy Master in front of him. The four divine emperors of the holy region could not help but suck in a breath of cold air.

If it was in the past, they might think that the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace was bragging when they heard his words. However, after witnessing the strength of the Dragon King, it was really possible.

They also knew that the Dragon Palace already had a rank two void God emperor existence.

According to the information they received, the Dragon Palace only had a rank two void God emperor existence in the past, and it was not the Dragon King.

Five years ago, the Dragon Palace was able to defeat the imperial court and the Wizard Association alone. Now, with the addition of the Dragon King’s powerful strength?

Furthermore, from the tone of the Dragon King, the three great factions were not afraid even if they joined forces with the Dragon Palace. This meant that the Dragon Palace might still have a rank two void God emperor existence.

When they thought of this, they felt that the dragon palace was a little terrifying.

“Boss Wang, the strength of the Dragon Palace… isn’t it too terrifying?”

Beside him, invincible battle technique clicked his tongue slightly. His face was filled with shock.

“Shut up!”

The god Emperor of Shangshui glared at him when he heard his disciple’s frightened voice.

Invincible battle technique twitched his mouth.

“Boss Wang, bring me along if you are going to conquer the Heaven Magus region!”

He quickly said that and covered his mouth.

“Dragon King, the combined strength of the three major forces is not weak. The Dragon Palace must be careful too!”

The god Emperor of Shangshui glared at invincible battle technique again and turned to Wang Xian with a smile.

“I am confident.”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“It’s good that you’re confident, Dragon King. Our holy region advocates peace. It’s inconvenient for us to participate in some matters. If Xiao Yan wants to participate, we won’t stop her. I also hope that the Dragon Palace can shake the starry sky.”

The Holy Lord pondered for a moment before saying with a smile.

At the same time, he also conveyed the goodwill of the holy region.
