Chapter 1217: 1218 saving Ling Jian ‘er

Translator: 5496903

Wang Xian walked in the air. His strength had increased so much that he was no longer sprinting on land like before.

With his current strength, he could kill a powerhouse at the first level of the Seethrough realm in his human form. If he were to transform into a divine dragon, his strength would increase again.

According to his estimation, although he could not defeat a powerhouse at the second level of the Seethrough realm in his divine dragon form, he would definitely be able to escape from the hands of a powerhouse at the second level of the Seethrough realm.

However, what he did not know was that after he left, he had another name.

The mysterious man, the Sword Demon!

Even if he knew, Wang Xian could only smile.

He could not walk the path of swordsmanship. The sword was just to display the offensive techniques of the golden water sword principle.

When Wang Xian had completely integrated the combined attacks of his attributes, he would be able to display all the attacks of the golden water sword principle without using his sword.

He was not a pure swordsman.

Wang Xian flew quickly to where he was staying and arrived at the pine and poplar forest in less than an hour.

“Awoo!”

When he opened the door, the cry of the spirit purple qilin could be heard from inside. It stood up and walked over with its huge body. It was obvious that it had not seen Wang Xian for a month and even missed him.

Wang Xian rubbed its head and took out the corpses of a few ferocious beasts from his interspatial ring.

“Awoo!”

It let out an excited cry and swallowed it directly. After all, it had not eaten for a month.

“I’ve found a few playmates for you!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he moved his Na Ling Bag and five little golden monkeys came out from it.

The Demonic Beast Cub, the Little Yan monkey, was obtained from the Blackcloud Fort.

However, other than the Little Yan monkey, there were a few other living creatures that came out from within.

It was a tortoise, a tortoise with a blood-red shell. It had a blood-red head and looked extremely ferocious.

It was a void interpretation first level dire beast, the blood fiend tortoise!

It had a three-meter-long body and its shell was filled with sharp spikes.

When this tortoise came out, six more tortoises came out. However, this time, it was not the blood fiend tortoise, but the blood-traced tortoise!

The blood-traced turtle was a ferocious beast two levels lower than the blood-traced turtle. The strength of the six turtles was only at transcendent level nine.

Wang Xian obtained these turtles from the Blood Spirit Cave. This was also because he had stayed in the blood spirit cave for a few hours.

The owner of the blood spirit cave had obviously kept many ferocious beasts and pets. All of them were corpses.

Only a few turtles with relatively strong vitality survived.

Wang Xian spent some time to subdue all of them.

“Don’t leave this courtyard!”

Wang Xian ordered the group of ferocious beasts and walked into the room.

Apart from the blood evil turtle and the Spirit Purple Unicorn, Wang Xian was prepared to sell all of these ferocious beasts.

Especially the Five Little Yan monkeys. They would definitely fetch a good price.

“Let’s tidy up our harvest!”

Wang Xian walked into the room and took out the interspatial rings of the Meng clan’s people. He checked the treasures inside.

“TSK Tsk, my harvest this time should be close to two trillion middle-grade spiritual stones, right?”

Wang Xian’s face was filled with excitement. The spiritual liquid, elixirs, and spiritual herbs only took up a portion.

For example, weapons, armor, formations, Demonic Beast Cubs, ferocious beast pets, pet eggs, and two half-step void interpretation ferocious beast bloodlines. There were almost all kinds of things.

In addition to the items he obtained from over 200 people of the Meng clan, all of them were above transcendent level six. He could have whatever he wanted.

“I’ll first consume these spiritual herbs, pills, and spiritual liquid!”

Wang Xian sorted out all the items one by one and looked at the items that could directly increase his dragon energy.

Without any hesitation, he consumed them directly and transformed them into dragon energy.

The dragon energy that was difficult to increase was increasing at a terrifying speed.

“Close to 30 million, an increase of 30 million dragon crystals!”

After Wang Xian swallowed all the spiritual herbs, pills, and spiritual liquid, together with the energy he obtained from Long Xiaotian, the amount of energy he needed to level up had reached one-third.

“Selling the remaining resources will definitely increase my level!”

Wang Xian grinned.

There were the most materials for crafting, and many of them were at the void interpretation level.

Other than that, there were weapons and armors that had been crafted.

There were seven to eight formations that were obtained from the sword mansion. The highest grade formation was the sword formation at the second level of the insightful void tier. It was extremely powerful.

“Other than refining the materials into weapons and armors, I have to think of a way to get rid of all these items!”

Wang Xian was deep in thought. He couldn’t buy them from Long Xiaotian, but he should be able to help sell them.

However, he hesitated for a moment before shaking his head. There were too many items and the value was too high. It might take a long time for him to help deal with them. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Is there an auction house here? Should I go and take a look?”

Wang Xian thought about it. He only went to the hiring association once and didn’t take a good look at the surroundings of the hiring association. It seemed that he would have to stroll around here and find a way to convert the resources into his own strength as soon as possible.

“Let’s Rest for a while First!”

However, Wang Xian didn’t go out immediately. He hadn’t rested for more than a month and was lying comfortably in his room.

“Roar, Roar, Roar!”

Wang Xian didn’t know how long he had slept. He felt that he had slept for at least more than ten hours.

A roar came from outside and woke him up.

He frowned slightly, put on his clothes, and walked into the courtyard.

The moment he came out, he saw Ling Zilin, blood evil turtle, and the rest of the demonic beasts staring fiercely at Xiao Ha who was standing on the wall.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

This Xiao Ha cried out with a pitiful face full of anxiety. When it saw Wang Xian coming out, it suddenly shrunk its head and cried out immediately.

“Save me...”

The human voice that came out of his mouth surprised Wang Xian slightly.

He waved his hand and ordered Ling Zilin and the rest to stop shouting. He stared at Xiao Ha and asked directly, “What did you say?”

“Save, save, Jian ‘er, CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”

Xiao Ha stood on the wall and cried out anxiously. However, as he was a cub, he didn’t know many languages.

As he spoke, he was anxious. He extended his hand and pointed to the other side of the wall.

“Are you asking me to go with you?”

Wang Xian looked at the anxious little fellow curiously and asked with a look of surprise on his face.

“Awoo!”

Xiao ha nodded his head vigorously and gestured once again.

“Alright, I’ll go over!”

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment before nodding his head. He flew straight to the wall.

Xiao Ha turned his head and brought him to a courtyard at the side.

“Huh?”

When Wang Xian came to the wall of another courtyard, he saw a woman lying in the courtyard.
