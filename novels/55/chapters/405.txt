Chapter 406: Gathering Of The Super Rich (2)

“It’s a little inappropriate. Cousin, there’s still some time. Bring your classmate to change into a set of formal attire. How can he be dressed so casually on such an important occasion? He will only make others feel that he isn’t showing them respect!”

The voice of Wang Dahai’s cousin came across. The young man sitting next to her cousin looked across at Wang Xian with contempt.

“A person’s qualities, upbringing, attire and language can show a person’s wealth. There are things that a man, who suddenly got rich, can’t display. It takes three generations to nurture a noble family.”

The young man had his arm across Wang Dahai’s cousin’s waist. He stared at Wang Xian with a face of smiles but was clearly looking down on him.

Several other young men who were sitting beside Wang Xian smirked and were clearly despising Wang Xian.

A man who suddenly got rich often looked down on the poor while a person from a noble family often looked down on those who got rich suddenly.

For a man who got rich suddenly to become a noble family, it would take at least three generations.

The first generation would provide the capital potential, to hold properties and gain knowledge.

The second generation would hold material capital and would possess the ability to create wealth over sustained periods.

The third generation was when the mental capital was generated.

In their eyes, the young man that came to the banquet dressed so casually wouldn’t even have reached the level of the first generation.

In the field, those who were here were all from the richest families, ancient martial arts families or those with extremely wide influence in their cities. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

They had an exceptional upbringing and family backgrounds. Without exaggerating, one could call them noble families.

Wang Xian was taken aback upon hearing Wang Dahai’s cousin. He took a glance at this outfit and chuckled to himself.

At the only two banquets he had ever attended, people commented about his attire.

However, it was just like they had said. Wang Xian wasn’t part of the so-called nobles. He didn’t pay much attention to that and simply wore what he preferred to wear.

In his perspective, the so-called nobles were just a joke.

Noble race?

The strong had never been restricted by the customs of the world. Moreover, ordinary people would only look up to the experts with fear and respect. They wouldn’t criticize them for their attire.

This was because they weren’t qualified to give their comments.

Wang Xian looked across the group and shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly before picking up the cup of fruit juice Wang Dahai had brought for him.

Wang Dahai smiled bitterly when he saw how Wang Xian reacted. He asked softly, “Old Wang, do you want to change into formal attire?”

“I’m good. That’s too troublesome.” Wang Xian shook his head and replied apathetically.

“This... isn’t very appropriate!”

Wang Dahai was hesitant. This brother of his was exceptionally mysterious with strong influence in Rivertown.

He could even donate several tens of millions to the school on a whim. However, this banquet was a gathering of the most super-rich in the entire Southern Province.

Rivertown was just a small city in the Southern Province. Moreover, this was a gathering hosted by the richest man in the Southern Province.

Dressing too casually might give one the impression that he was rude.

Wang Xian smiled and shook his head. He looked to the side and saw two old men walking towards the main hall in ordinary Chinese tunic suits. He asked, “Aren’t they in ordinary attire too?”

Pfft!

“Haha! You are really interesting. Really...!~”

“Haha, you are comparing yourself to Old Wu and Old Li? Do you know who they are? They are the family heads of a second-class ancient martial arts family. What gives you the guts to even say that?”

The moment Wang Xian completed his words, the group of young men by the side chuckled and looked at him as though they were looking at a retard.

Wang Dahai’s cousin was also taken aback and was speechless.

Initially, she had thought the classmate of her cousin to be a gifted person. She had not expected him to be that dumb as she wondered how Wang Xian had even gotten in here.

“Oh, friend, do you have an invitation card?” Wang Dahai’s cousin looked at Wang Xian and asked coldly.

“I came in with my friends!”

Hearing their ridicule and seeing their eyes filled with contempt and looking at him, Wang Xian replied to the lady.

“So that’s how it is!”

Wang Dahai’s cousin displayed an “as I expected” expression. Clearly, he wasn’t qualified to receive an invitation from Mogul Sun.

“Dahai, keep a distance from this classmate of yours. Otherwise, grandpa will be getting some unnecessary criticisms!” Wang Dahai’s cousin said softly to him.

“Cousin... I...”

Wang Dahai was taken aback and was shocked. He had not expected his cousin to say such words.

This embarrassed him as his expression turned solemn.

“Dahai, listen to your cousin. Don’t bring unnecessary troubles to your grandpa!” the young man beside Wang Dahai’s cousin said softly to him.

“Tsk! Cousin, just leave us alone,” Wang Dahai replied with a stern face.

“You... I’m not trying to control you. I’m doing this for grandpa... You...” Wang Dahai’s cousin stared furiously at him.

“Let’s go take a seat by the side.”

Wang Dahai pulled Wang Xian along by the sleeves and went to the side.

Wang Xian smiled faintly and shook his head. He followed behind Wang Dahai to a seat by the side.

“Old Wang, please don’t take it to heart. My cousin can be quite mean,” Wang Dahai apologized to Wang Xian.

“It’s alright. I won’t be bothered by them. They even claim to be from the noble race,” Wang Xian chuckled.

He walked to the side and took two cups of red wine. After giving Wang Dahai a toast, he smiled and said, “It seems like your standing in the family is a little low!”

“Hehe, that’s not entirely right. Although I, your brother, am not as incredible as you, I still can inherit a substantial amount of wealth in the future.

Wang Dahai raised an eyebrow and continued agitatedly, “Several of my uncles don’t have a son and my grandfather sees me as his grandson. Although my grandfather didn’t like my father, he is still pretty fond of me. Otherwise, my grandfather wouldn’t have brought me here!” [1]

“So, you are a future tycoon!” Wang Xian looked at Wang Dahai, feeling a little shocked.

“I guess I’m doing fine... I should still be getting at least a few million. Because of that, my cousin isn’t very fond of me.” Wang Dahai broke into laughter and didn’t seem to be too concerned.

After all, he rarely interacted with his cousins. His grandfather had only brought him along this time and didn’t bring along his cousins. His cousin had tagged along with her boyfriend this time.

“Xiao You, your cousin is really...”

At one side, Wang Dahai’s cousin was unhappy to see Wang Dahai pulling his friend to the side.

“Tsk! His father came from a village. At that time, my grandfather was against their marriage. Now, he is just acting like his father. Those that they knew are all inferior people!”

Wang Dahai’s cousin shook his head disdainfully. She felt embarrassed and therefore changed the topic and chatted about other topics with the rest.

Wang Dahai talked about the happenings in the school with Wang Xian. Gradually, more and more people arrived at the main hall.

The entire hall was segregated into different tiers. The older generation would sit at the front, the middle-aged generation sat in the middle while the youngest generation would sit at the back.

The younger generation wasn’t fond of moving forward either, as they had fewer things to look out for when chatting with people similar to their age.

Soon, a huge crowd of young men and ladies from the entire Southern Province had gathered.
