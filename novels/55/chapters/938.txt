Chapter 939: Darkness was approaching

“Call all the spies of the dragon spike in qiaoling town over. Get Them Ready Tonight!”

Wang Xian walked towards the location of the Demon Hunters Association in qiaoling town and said to Long Yi who was following him with a cold gaze.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Long Yi nodded his head respectfully.

“Qiaoling Business Association?”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly. A hint of coldness flashed across his eyes.

This was the first time the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group had accepted a escort mission. However, they didn’t expect to be rejected by someone. Furthermore, they were so arrogant.

Their territory?

Wang Xian’s face turned cold and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

Long Ci was just about to enter bridgeforest town. He would use the bridgeforest business association to make his move and shake the entire town.

He descended into bridgeforest town in an invincible manner.

A cold smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face. He went to the hiring association and accepted the reward for this mission.

Six million middle-grade spirit stones. Although it was not a small sum, he was still slightly displeased.

This was not a problem of spirit stones, but a problem of their attitude.

After receiving the reward, Wang Xian found a restaurant and sat down. He ordered a table full of dishes.

“I heard that there was a monster siege in Shenghai town. Many mercenary groups have made a fortune this time!”

“Danger and opportunity coexist. The scale of the monster siege this time is not very large. Shenghai town managed to defend it easily!”

“The main reason is that the mayor of Shenghai town is relatively strong. He is a top-notch expert at transcendent level nine. I heard from a friend that Shenghai town is quite chaotic recently!”

“It seems to be because of an assassin organization. That assassin organization is very powerful!”

“Damn it. If only I had the money, I would hire an assassin to destroy the Bridgewood Chamber of Commerce. Their Chamber of Commerce monopolizes the food supply in Bridgewood town. As a result, many people can’t even eat!”

“The Bridgewood Chamber of Commerce is too bloodthirsty. Moreover, the mayor doesn’t care about it. Damn it!”

While Wang Xian was eating, a few voices of discussion came from the side. Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and ate some food before walking out.

In the center of Qiao Lin Town, there were four big pill and weapon workshops, the life and Death Pill Workshop, the Holy Item Forging Workshop, the Phoenix Immortal, and the Qiao Lin Pill and Weapon Workshop.

However, the Phoenix Immortal Pill and weapon workshop was completely empty. No martial artists entered.

Obviously, they had suffered a huge blow.

“Dragon King, the people have been called over!”

Not long after, Long Yi walked over and whispered to him.

Wang Xian nodded and found a secret place to develop the ten of them into dragonmen one by one.

They would receive a fixed monthly bonus that was sufficient to survive.

It was late at night. Wang Xian was staying in a restaurant at the center of Qiao Lin Town.

When he opened the window, he could see a huge mansion in the distance.

That was the mansion of the Lin family of the Qiao Lin Business Association.

In Qiao Lin Town, the Lin family’s influence was unparalleled.

At night, the Lin family was brightly lit. One could vaguely see that there were guards patrolling inside.

In the center, there was an array formation in Wang Xian’s line of sight. It was an extraordinary level seven array formation.

A family that could come up with such an array formation was definitely not simple.

According to Wang Xian’s understanding at night, the strength of the Bridgewood business association was somewhat beyond his expectations.

As the greatest strength of Bridgewood Town, the Lin family had one level eight extraordinaire and two level seven extraordinaires.

Six level six extraordinaires and more than a dozen level five extraordinaires.

This strength completely crushed all the families in Shenghai Town.

This was also the reason why the BRIDGEFOREST Business Association didn’t put Wang Xian and the rest of the golden mercenary group in their eyes at all tonight.

“You will pay a heavy price!”

Wang Xian opened the window and looked at the Lin family’s mansion with a twinkle in his eyes.

Ao Yao led all the strange demons and rushed over.

“I wonder if I can kill all the powerhouses of the BRIDGEFOREST Business Association!”

Wang Xian mumbled as he stood there and waited quietly.

“Roar, there’s an assassin!”

There weren’t many people on the streets of Qiao Lin Town in the early morning.

Even in the center of the town, there weren’t many people left.

However, at this moment, a loud roar came from the Lin family’s residence.

“What’s going on? What Happened?”

“It’s old master Lin’s voice. Quick, quick, there’s an assassin!”

“Not good, president Lin has been killed. Oh My God!”

“There’s an assassin, there’s an assassin!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Following that, a chaotic sound came from the Lin family mansion. The light instantly lit up the entire Lin family mansion.

In the middle of the night, that loud roar spread across half of Qiao Lin Town, causing everyone who was sleeping to be slightly startled.

Following that, the surrounding rooms lit up one by one, and they all looked towards the Lin family mansion with faces full of shock.

“What happened?”

“It seems to be the sound coming from the Lin family mansion. There’s an assassin? Could it be that there’s an assassin assassinating the Lin family members?”

“Impossible, right? Could it be an assassin from the undercurrent? But who has so much money to hire an assassin to assassinate the Lin family’s experts?”

“In Qiao Lin Town, who would dare to assassinate a member of the Lin Family?”

The windows in the restaurant had already been opened one by one. Some of the customers were talking in astonishment.

Wang Xian frowned. “It didn’t work? That’s not good!”

His eyes flickered as he saw Ao Yao and the rest flying towards him with his dark fire dragon eyes.

“Dragon King!”

A group of 21 strange demons arrived and greeted Wang Xian respectfully.

“What happened? Did you fail?”

Wang Xian frowned and asked.

“Dragon King, I was discovered when I was trying to assassinate that level eight supernatural realm expert!”

The strange demon said with an unpleasant expression, “Fortunately, I managed to assassinate him at the very last moment!”

“Thirteen level five supernatural realm experts were assassinated, five level six supernatural realm experts were assassinated, and two level seven supernatural realm experts were not assassinated!”

Ao Yao continued to speak to Wang Xian.

“There are still two level-seven transcendents and one level-six transcendents. It doesn’t matter. Have you guys been discovered?”

Wang Xian was more satisfied with this assassination and asked.

“No, we left immediately because we were afraid of being discovered by others. The remaining two level-seven transcendents, do you want to...”

Ao Yao shook her head and said.

“No, we don’t have to do anything today. We will do it tomorrow. Hehe, let them enjoy the fear!”

Wang Xian smiled coldly. He was very satisfied with the assassination this time.

Seventy percent of the experts in the Bridgewood business association had been killed, especially the death of a level eight extraordinaire. It was enough to shake the strongest family in Bridgewood town.

The remaining two extraordinary level seven experts could be killed at any time.

“Send out the contact information of our dragon spike mercenary group. We will liven up the entire Bridgewood Town Tomorrow!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao and the rest nodded and disappeared quickly.

Wang Xian took the interspatial ring that Ao Yao gave him and looked at them one by one. His eyes were filled with ecstasy.

“It seems that I have made the right decision to come here. The items in the interspatial ring alone are worth more than a hundred million middle-grade spirit stones!”
