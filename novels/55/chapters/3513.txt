3514 3513 alliance of 100 cities

“Hahaha, this is awesome!”

Inside the Dragon Palace, the eight-limbed demon demon and the others shouted excitedly.

This time, they had let out a heavy sigh of relief.

Although they had been attacking the alliance of 100 cities for the past few years, it had greatly affected them.

However, the Dragon Palace still had to be careful outside.

Now that they had destroyed fifteen cities in a domineering manner, they were extremely pleased!

Now, the Dragon Palace had the capital to confront the Hundred Cities Alliance head-on!

“Are there any injuries?”

Wang Xian looked at them with a smile and asked.

“Dragon King, although one of my subordinates has escaped back to the Dragon Palace, he was still killed by the curse.”

Ao crab said.

“HMM? He was killed in the Dragon Palace?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. With a move of his palm, an image appeared in front of him.

In the image, it was the scene of the devouring dragon being killed.

The death was very strange.

“Eh? Is this the technique of the alliance leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance? It’s So Strange!”

Ba Qi and the rest looked over and revealed an astonished expression.

“It is indeed a little strange. This should be the technique of a cursed wizard. The alliance leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance is a powerful wizard.”

Tian Chen looked over and his eyes flickered slightly.

“Only their alliance leader has the combat strength of a level three universe dominator. With our Dragon King’s strength, we can totally defeat him!”

Mo Sha said with a smile.

“It’s hard to say. It depends on the opponent’s defense and foundation.”

Wang Xian said faintly.

The Alliance Master of the Hundred Cities Alliance was a wizard. The Wizard’s methods had always been unpredictable.

Apart from that, it also depended on whether he had any treasures. Currently, Wang Xian’s speed was extremely terrifying, but his attack power was only at the level of a level three universe dominator.

If the opponent had a defensive treasure, he wouldn’t be able to do anything about it.

Apart from that, he also had to see if his opponent’s treasure was powerful.

The five elements millstone in Wang Xian’s hands was still at the level of a level two universe dominator.

The same was true for the Tai Chi Dragon Plate.

Currently, Wang Xian wasn’t 100% confident of defeating and killing the alliance leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance.

Unless the Five Elements Millstone, the Tai Chi Dragon Plate, and the water touch king made another breakthrough, he would have the confidence to do so.

“It’s a pity that we didn’t manage to get the treasures in the cities this time.”

Ba Qi said.

“Ba Qi Mo Sha, the two of you go and plan your next attack. Shorten the target to five cities.”

Wang Xian instructed them.

This attack was just the beginning. Wang Xian wouldn’t stop.

He just didn’t know what preparations the Hundred Cities Alliance would make next.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The eight-limbed demonic fiend and the rest replied immediately.

“Shui Chui, how’s the harvest this time?”

Wang Xian asked her.

“Boss, the harvest is alright. It’s just that… the water-type treasures have been swallowed by me.”

The king of Shui Chui said with a smile.

“Hand the remaining treasures to Prime Minister Gui. How much more do you need to recover to the level-three combat strength of a universe dominator?”

Wang Xian asked him.

“There’s still a long way to go. We need at least ten more cities like that for the resources of the cities just now.”

King Aqua Tentacle said.

This caused Wang Xian to shake his head slightly.

Daming city was the city with the strongest resources among the cities they attacked.

Ten more cities with such resources?

That was too many!

Wang Xian went to the location of the dragon transformation pool and threw the corpses of two universe masters with level-two combat strength and three universe masters with level-one combat strength aside. He informed Prime Minister Gui and asked him to send the disciples of the Dragon Palace to carry out a breakthrough.

This battle would allow the Dragon Palace to add two more universe masters with level-two combat strength.

Now, it was too easy for him to kill an expert of this level in an instant!

“Let’s continue to move forward and find an opportunity to bump into the alliance leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance!”

Wang Xian mumbled.

He was uncertain about the strength of the alliance leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance. If he could suppress or even kill him, Wang Xian could attack without restraint!

…

“Alliance leader, what should we do now? The fifteen cities of Daming City have almost all turned into ruins. The Dragon Palace has a level three universe master with combat strength. What should we do in the future?”

“I’m Sorry, Alliance leader. In the future, Our Sky City will withdraw from the Hundred City Alliance and become a truly neutral city!”

“Your Hundred City Alliance has already gone against its original intention and will not participate in any power struggles. We, FA Xiang City, will withdraw from the Hundred City Alliance!”

“We haven’t gained any benefits. We don’t know when they will be destroyed. We will withdraw as well!”

At this moment, in the headquarters of the Hundred Cities Alliance, all the City Lords had gathered together on this day.

The tallest mountain peak in the center was a little noisy.

The Hundred Cities Alliance’s Alliance Master sat in the front seat, his cold gaze sweeping over them without the slightest fluctuation!

In the arena, over ten city lords directly expressed their intention to withdraw from the Hundred Cities Alliance.

If they did not withdraw now, they might never be able to do so in the future!

That was because they had already been destroyed! 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

15 cities had been attacked, and even great Ming city had been destroyed. Great Ming City’s City lords and the others had fallen!

This time, the power displayed by Dragon Palace made them tremble.

Especially since Dragon Palace now had a universe ruler level 3 great being with Combat Power.

With such a great being, what could they do?

What could the Hundred City Alliance do to resist?

That great being from Dragon Palace came to their city and massacred them wantonly. Before the help of the Hundred City Alliance arrived, they might be annihilated!

Most importantly, if the help came, would it be able to save them?

Therefore, more than ten city lords directly announced that they would quit the Hundred City Alliance!

“Withdraw? Do you think there’s still a way out? Do you really think that the ancestral dragon lineage doesn’t know that our Hundred Cities Alliance is participating in their war? Can you really guarantee that you won’t be exterminated once you withdraw from the Dragon Palace? Take over your resources?”

The Hundred Cities Alliance’s Alliance master didn’t say anything. An old man below him spoke coldly.

His words caused the expressions of everyone present to sink!

They changed drastically.

It was indeed a little too late for them to retreat now.

“Then I wonder if alliance leader has any good ideas?”

A universe master with level-two Combat Power, one city master, looked at the Alliance leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance and asked.

“At this point in time, the flaws of the Hundred Cities Alliance are too obvious and too lax!”

The Alliance Master of the Hundred Cities Alliance said coldly.

“Eh? What do you mean, Alliance Master?”

All the city lords were slightly stunned and their eyes flickered.

“The Hundred Cities Alliance is too loose, and it’s quite troublesome to mobilize its power. It will be broken down by the Dragon Palace one by one. The Hundred Cities Alliance will be united to form the Hundred Cities Alliance!”

The Alliance Master of the Hundred Cities Alliance said faintly.

“What? The Hundred Cities Alliance will be completely united?”

The alliance master’s words caused all the city masters to be slightly startled.
