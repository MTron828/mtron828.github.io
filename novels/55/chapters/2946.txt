Chapter 2947: easily swept through the glazed domain’s tremor 5

“The Dragon King and the others are here. That’s great. We should be able to make it in time!”

“Alright, Alright. Let’s hurry over and welcome them!”

Upon receiving the news of the Dragon King and the others’arrival, the domain Lord, Sacred Master, and the other divine emperors revealed expressions of extreme joy. They immediately stood up and said.

“They should have arrived by now!”

!!

As the sacred master spoke, he immediately flew toward a planet behind them.

They were currently on the battlefront in the void. There was no teleportation array here.

“They’re here!”

When they were halfway through their flight, they immediately saw ten figures flying toward them from the void ahead.

“Oh?”

However, the sacred master and the domain Lord soon frowned slightly.

The ten figures that flew over didn’t have the Dragon King.

The Dragon King didn’t come?

This made their expressions change slightly, and they thought in their hearts that this wasn’t good.

Could it be that the Dragon King only sent a few members of the Dragon Palace because he knew that the demons of the Chimei region were too strong?

Their hearts sank when they thought of this.

“Domain Lord, Sacred Lord!”

Prime Minister Gui led the six devouring dragons and the eight-limbed demonic fiend and immediately called out when they saw the domain Lord and sacred lord flying over.

“Prime Minister Gui, Where’s Your Dragon King?”

The domain Lord’s gaze swept over Prime Minister Gui and the others. He pursed his lips and immediately asked.

“The Dragon King should still be at the mechanical imperial region. It’s enough for the Dragon King to send us over!”

Prime Minister Gui looked at them and said with a smile.

“Enough?”

When they heard Prime Minister Gui’s words, the sacred Lord and the domain Lord were slightly stunned.

“It’s enough to destroy some of the demonic beasts. Brother Devouring, show us your strength!”

When eight points saw their stunned expressions, he patted the devouring dragon beside him.

“We are enough to destroy some of the evildoers!”

The Devouring Dragon said indifferently. A third level God emperor aura charged towards the domain Lord and Sacred Master.

The terrifying aura swept over, causing the injured domain Lord and sacred master, who was only at the second level void God Emperor realm, to turn pale. They felt their breathing become sluggish!

The Devouring Dragon was dissatisfied with the belittling of the domain Lord Sacred Master. Hence, he did not have any scruples.

“Gulu!”

“This is!”

The domain Lord revealed an excited expression.

“I’m sorry, we did not know who Mount Tai was. I did not expect the dragon palace to have such an expert!”

He cupped his hands. His heart was filled with excitement and shock.

A third rank God Emperor. It seemed that the Dragon Palace did not only have this realm, there were also members who had it.

“Our Dragon King said that the VELURIYAM domain is in a crisis, so he asked us to help you solve it. Let’s Go!”

Prime Minister Gui said with a smile.

The current strength of the Dragon Palace was no longer comparable to that of the veluriyam domain and the saint realm.

It didn’t matter if the Dragon Palace was a little arrogant.

“Good, good. Thank you, Dragon King, for your help!”

“Prime Minister Gui, we may need to rush forward immediately. A large number of people in the glazed domain are still on the run. Once we are caught by the demon cave behind us, the consequences will be unimaginable!”

The governor said quickly.

“Okay, we will go there immediately!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded.

“Let’s Go!”

The governor and the grand elders didn’t dare to delay and immediately flew forward.

“The experts of the Dragon Palace have come to support us. Don’t worry, we will immediately go to support the people behind us!”

When the domain Lord and the others flew to the sky above the battle line, they glanced at the soldiers, disciples, and people with worried faces and immediately said.

Their voices echoed throughout the sky!

“What?”

Everyone who was covered in fear suddenly heard the domain Lord’s words and looked stunned.

Then, their faces were full of surprise.

“The experts from the Dragon Palace came to support us? The Dragon Palace came back from their expedition to the machine royal territory? Did they succeed?”

“They should have succeeded. If they didn’t succeed, how could they come to help us?”

“Great, Great. If the Dragon Palace has the strength to invade the machine royal territory, as long as they come to help us, we will be able to survive this crisis!”

“Now, our governor and the experts of the Dragon Palace are heading forward to rescue the others of the glazed domain. I hope we can succeed!”

“Hahaha, with the experts of the Dragon Palace taking action, don’t ask. A group of demons will be killed instantly!”

Countless people were discussing. At this time, an extremely arrogant voice sounded.

The voice was naturally invincible in battle.

Some of the soldiers and experts smiled when they heard his words.

They didn’t hope that the Dragon Palace could destroy the demonic beasts in the demon cave. They only hoped that they could resist the invasion of the demonic beasts. They were satisfied as long as they could save the rest of the people!

As for the others, they didn’t dare to think about them.

This time, the power of the demonic beasts made their hearts tremble.

“It’s fortunate that the Dragon Palace is willing to help. The Dragon Palace has done their best by coming here at this time!”

Everyone in the VELURIYAM domain felt grateful. Even their dissatisfaction towards the invincibility of their battle techniques had lessened.

“Domain Lord, I’ve already contacted a divine emperor in the void. According to the location he teleported over, we’ll be able to arrive in a day. The Devil Den shouldn’t be able to catch up to them!”

In the Void, the first Supreme Elder held the communication stone plate and said.

“Good, good. We can make it in time. I’ll trouble this brother of the Dragon Palace later!” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The governor nodded and said to the devouring dragon.

“We will do as the Dragon King ordered!”

The devouring dragon nodded.

The governor and the others smiled. They glanced at the middle-aged men beside the devouring dragon with doubt in their eyes.

Why were their auras similar?

However, they didn’t ask too much because of the aura they emitted.

They quickly flew in the air.

“The experts from the Dragon Palace have come to support us. The domain Lord and the others are heading our way. Don’t worry, the domain Lord and the experts from the Dragon Palace will arrive in a day!”

At this moment, tens of thousands of life planets and huge divine kingdoms were flying in the void in front of them.

The faces of countless people from the glazed domain turned pale. Many of them even prayed together.

At this moment, the voice of a god Emperor sounded, causing everyone to be slightly stunned. Soon, they revealed excited and hopeful expressions.

“The domain Lord said that the experts from the Dragon Palace have arrived. We will be able to tide over this crisis. If we are bored, we can chat on the AI. There is no need to be too nervous!”

The god Emperors also revealed smiles as they said.

“Many thanks to the Dragon Palace and Dragon King!”

The countless citizens of the glazed domain said gratefully as they relaxed a little.

Time slowly passed. A Day passed very quickly in the void.

“Domain Lord, we have seen them! We have seen them!”

A day later, the domain Lord Sacred Lord and the members of the Dragon Palace also met up with the escaping army of the glazed domain.

Seeing the vast number of people, they smiled and heaved a heavy sigh of relief.

“The domain Lord and the others are here. The experts of the Dragon Palace are here too!”

At this moment, a divine emperor in front of them also noticed them and shouted excitedly.
