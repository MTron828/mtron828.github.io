Chapter 575: Space Ring

“Hey, trash, take a look at this. Level 5 elixir pill, the Channels Cleansing Pill!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian’s cold and disdainful voice rang in Ye Feng’s ears.

“Oh my God! It is the Level 5 Channels Cleansing Pill. All four of them were refined in such a short time. This is simply amazing!”

“Incredible! This handsome master is simply incredible! In just a matter of a few minutes, he was able to refine four Level 5 elixir pills without any failures. He is so cool!”

“Alchemy master! He is the real deal. Oh gosh, I think I have fallen in love with him. He is truly a genius blacksmith and alchemist like no other!”

“The handsome master must be the brightest genius in the entire Yong Chang world. I have just made up my mind to court him forever!”

At the same time, the voices of a group of infatuated and passionate Mt. Xue female disciples could be heard in the distance.

They gawked at Wang Xian with excitement as if they were obsessed fans of a popular idol.

Ye Feng stared at the four elixir pills in front of him and listened to the astonished voices of the Mt. Xue disciples. His face turned painfully gloomy.

He suddenly felt as if his world had been turned upside down.

A blacksmith and alchemy master at the young tender age of his twenties.

Two master-level skills in one person!

Is he even human?

How is that even possible?

How could he believe that this was humanly possible?

He was known as the genius that was favored by the gods. But in the face of this man, he was nothing.

This was a huge upset for the arrogant and haughty Ye Feng.

In front of such a genius, they simply weren’t in the same league!

“If you are not making any other requests for refining weapons or elixir pills, please leave now. My shop is too small to accommodate you!”

Wang Xian spoke coldly to the absent-minded Ye Feng.

“You...”

Ye Feng stared at Wang Xian with his face twisted with anger.

Yet he also felt a sense of despair as he wrote the mixed emotions on his face.

“Let’s go, Senior Ye Feng! We still have unsettled business to take care of tonight,” the disciples of Yong Chang Immortal Sect who had been standing aside quickly said to the embarrassed Ye Feng.

With a sullen face, Ye Feng turned and left silently.

“Hmph!”

Mu Wanbai sneered at Ye Feng’s departing figure.

“I guess the handsome master has dealt Ye Feng such a huge blow that he lost all his senses!”

“I think he is a narrow-minded guy putting on a high and mighty front. How dare he even scream at our Sister Wanbai!? Hmph!”

“Ye Feng is just feeling jealous. Compared to this handsome master here, he is simply garbage. No, I mean the handsome master is just too powerful for everyone. His ability is truly unparalleled!”

“Both blacksmith and alchemy master in one! Do you have a girlfriend yet, handsome master?”

“Can I be your girlfriend? I don’t mind if you already have one!”

“Xiao Qing, are you sexually aroused already? Ignore her, handsome master. Choose me as your girlfriend instead. I have bigger boobs than the rest of them!”

After the disciples of Yong Chang Immortal Sect had left, the female disciples of Mt. Xue started to misbehave and flirt with Wang Xian.

But Wang Xian was just so outstanding that it was hard to fault these ladies for throwing themselves at him. If anyone could land themselves such a husband, it would be the pinnacle of their lives!

Even Piao Lingxue, who had been standing quietly aside, was slightly moved by Wang Xian.

With such good looks and incredible refining skills, there was no other man like him in the entire Yong Chang.

“Sorry to disappoint everyone, but I do not have the intention of getting a girlfriend yet. Now, may I request that everybody please leaves their spiritual grass and refinery materials behind and make a note of your request? Do drop by tomorrow again to collect your elixir pills and spiritual equipment!”

Wang Xian quickly spoke to the crowd of passionate female disciples with a faint smile.

“I am serious, handsome master!” one of the female disciples from Mt. Xue shouted at Wang Xian with an earnest look on her face.

“I am closing my shop soon. Please leave your things behind!” Wang Xian laughed and shook his head.

“Stop your nonsense, girls. Just leave your materials and go!” Piao Lingxue yelled at the group of Mt. Xue disciples who had lost their usual reserved demure.

“Okay, Great Senior sister!”

Seeing that their Great Senior sister had raised her voice, the female disciples of Mt. Xue ended their teasing of Wang Xian. One by one, they left their refinery materials and spiritual grass in front of Wang Xian.

“Fifteen requests to refine spiritual pills, among which, one request for a Level 6 spiritual pill!”

As Wang Xian watched the female disciples leaving their heaps of spiritual grass, his eyes lit up.

These spiritual grasses constituted a great source of dragon energy for him.

After they were done placing their spiritual grasses, the Mt. Xue female disciples happily bid Wang Xian goodbye.

Their sweet and lovable looks were so seductive.

The onlooking youths who had crowded over to watch the scene were full of envy of Wang Xian.

But when they thought about how powerful Wang Xian was with his refining skills, they shook their heads helplessly.

How were they even qualified to pit themselves against a competitor like this?

“How many spiritual stones do we owe you?” Piao Lingxue asked Wang Xian gently after the disciples were done with putting down their materials.

“Just give me whatever spiritual stones you have with you!”

Wang Xian was obviously in good spirits at the sight of the spiritual grasses. He moved his arm, took out six small Bo Yu swords and tossed them towards Piao Lingxue.

Piao Lingxue was pleasantly surprised. With a swift gesture, she took out her larger Bo Yu sword and put the small swords into the hilt of the larger one.

“These are all the spiritual stones that I have!”

As Piao Lingxue spoke, she lifted her arm, and pieces of spiritual stones started to appear out of nowhere, dropping onto the table!

“Hmm?”

Wang Xian witnessed how the spiritual stones appeared out of thin air. A sign of disbelief flashed briefly across his face, and a thought formed in his mind that made him burn with passion.

Space item!

“Is that a space ring that you are holding?” Wang Xian asked with his eyes fixed on the ring in her hand.

“Yes, this is a space ring indeed!” Piao Lingxue nodded.

“Where can I buy a space ring? Or rather, where can I get a space ring?”

Wang Xian stared at Piao Lingxue and asked this hastily.

A space ring was a Spiritual Equipment that consists of storage space.

It was what Wang Xian had always wanted.

With it, he could enjoy the utmost convenience.

He would be able to store all the Spiritual Equipment and elixir pills in it.

Moreover, he would need to transport all the resources that he had gotten from Yong Chang world to the real world. With a space item to store the resources, it would save him a lot of trouble.

What a surprise to see the existence of a space ring in the Yong Chang world. I must have such a treasure! Wang Xian thought while staring hard at the ring in Piao Lingxue’s hand.

“Oh, this space ring? This is what I got as a reward for coming in second at the Da Hong Immortal Sect’s Outstanding young disciples ranking. They will also appear occasionally at auctions for bidding at a cost of roughly thirty to fifty thousand spiritual stones. If you ever come across a Nether Space Stone, you can refine one yourself as well!” Piao Lingxue replied earnestly, seeing how Wang Xian treated the ring with such importance.

“I see. Well then, Miss Piao, if you ever come across any news on space rings or Nether Space stones, please kindly let me know!”

Wang Xian nodded to Piao Lingxue.

“Don’t worry. I will let you know if I come across any news about them. Thanks for the Bo Yu sword,” said Piao Lingxue to Wang Xian gratefully.
