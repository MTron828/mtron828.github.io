Chapter 668: Six Feet Under

Translator: Larbrestudio

A sarcastic voice came from Wang Xian, ringing in the ears of everyone around him.

Wang Xian slowly moved the spiritual sword in his hand.

The weapons that belonged to the Dragon Sect disciples around him had penetrated every single one of the Yao Cauldron World experts.

All twenty-five Budding Realm experts were hit with fatal strikes.

“Elder Hua...”

“Oh no!”

The other twenty-odd Dan Realm experts, who were not being attacked, quickly spun around. They were shocked to see the Immortal Sect level experts being struck in their vital points.

“This...this cannot be! It is impossible!”

“I don’t believe this! How did they suddenly appear behind all of us? This is unbelievable.”

The group of martial artists of the Underworld was completely devastated after witnessing what had just happened.

They could not accept what had just unfolded in front of their very eyes.

Twenty-five Budding Realm experts from the strongest Immortal Sects who were their future rulers of the world.

And Elder Hua, who could always easily put up a tough fight against the strongest opponents...

All of them were killed in an instant!

As they watched the sharp weapons penetrating the bodies of the experts, the surrounding group of martial artists of the Underworld was frightened out of their wits.

Especially Sect Leader Wan from Qingfeng Sect, the people from the Song Clan and all the other experts who had just mocked Wang Xian moments ago.

They felt tremendous fear.

Even those who had not spoken a word just now were also secretly gloating over the misfortune of Wang Xian and his men.

And now, their supporting pillars were gone!

What awaited them was the consequences of their actions.

“Tsk tsk, these are all very fine spiritual weapons. And this, a Level 13 spiritual weapon fit for use by the immortals!” Wang Xian said, marveling as he held Elder Hua’s emerald truncheon in his hand.

Most of the Budding Realm experts were wealthy enough to arm themselves with Level 12 spiritual weapons.

Inlaid on top of Elder Hua’s emerald truncheon was the most precious Wood Spiritual Bead that Wang Xian had ever seen.

A Level 13 Wood Spiritual Bead!

The other Level 12 spiritual weapons were also embedded with all kinds of rare Wood and Fire Spiritual Beads. Wang Xian beamed at the sight of them.

These precious spiritual beads were perfect resources that he needed to cultivate two Level 13 Inferno and Wood Dragon Balls!

“You...urgh...”

Looking down blankly at the spiritual sword that was on his chest, Elder Hua was barely opening his mouth to speak. Instead of words, he coughed out a mouthful of blood.

However, the experts from the Budding Realm had astonishing vitality. Even as their hearts were being punctured, they were still able to hold on very long to their last breath.

But right now, what Elder Hua felt was not pain, but terror.

“You are not from the Budding Realm, or the Half-step immortal... You are an Immortal!” he said as he turned his stiff neck to face Wang Xian, still coughing up blood uncontrollably.

“It is too late to know how strong your opponent is now, don’t you think?”

Wang Xian looked at him mockingly.

Sss!

Upon hearing Wang Xian admitting his status as an Immortal, the remaining Yao Cauldron experts gasped with terror in their eyes.

In particular, the middle-aged man with short hair. He was still in a state of shock and disbelief.

The Dragon King is an Immortal!

To think that they were still plotting to kill an Immortal and eliminate his bloodline!

“Heh Heh... There are also many Immortal experts in our Yao Cauldron world. By killing us today, they will not let you off, even if you are an Immortal!” Elder Hua said as he stared at Wang Xian with slackened eyes. His voice had started to croak.

“Don’t worry. Nobody from your Yao Cauldron World can kill me. Rest in peace; the rest of these people will accompany you shortly!”

Wang Xian smiled as he slowly pulled out his spiritual sword.

“To think that I, Hua Qiudao, a high and mighty elder in the Yao Cauldron world, would end this way in this small Underworld!” said Elder Hua, refusing to resign to his demise.

It was his misfortune and ill fate to make enemies with the Immortal Dragon King.

“What I detest most is beings like you who think you are above everyone else. Displaying such an attitude in front of me will only make me bury you six feet under!”

Wang Xian’s words rung in Elder Hua’s ears as he stared coldly in return.

“You are ultimately not a God. You do not overlook our life and death!”

Wang Xian unsheathed his spiritual sword. The dragonians around him had drawn their spiritual weapons as well.

Bam! Bam! Bam! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

One by one, the experts fell to the ground. Wang Xian did not bother looking at them and instead flew to a mountain peak beneath the spiritual energy waterfall.

“The second dragon vein!”

Wang Xian looked down at the peak with excitement.

“Heh heh... Such arrogance from the Nine Cauldron Worlds. You are not the first person from those worlds to be killed by our Dragon King, and most likely won’t be the last either!”

Dragon Kid spoke with an ear-piercing voice. He surveyed the surroundings with his bloodshot eyes, smacked his tongue, and gradually raised his spiritual blade.

Mo Qinglong did not stop the dragonians.

Anyone who tried to deal with the Dragon King and harm him deserved to die!

“Argh!”

The shrill cries of death made the hearts of the Martial Artists of the Underworld pound rapidly.

Fear was looming in their hearts.

The Dragon King was an Immortal!

Elder Hua, who they had regarded as invincible, had mentioned an Immortal expert and this was it. A true Immortal expert before them.

They did not know how incredibly powerful an Immortal was. But they had an idea of how strong the twenty-five Budding Realm experts were.

And now, none of those experts from the Budding Realm and Yao Cauldron World were spared from death!

“Ah, the taste of blood is so delicious. What a waste that it could not be used to irrigate the pure blood corals. Oh well. Kill!”

One of the dragonians talked to himself as he licked the blood off his spiritual sword. With a turn of his body, he attacked the group of onlooking Martial Artists of the Underworld

“No...they are going to kill us...”

The massacre party was just getting started!

Wang Xian’s face lit up with a smile as he heard the wails of the dying masses, seeing the blood essence flowing into the dragon vein.

“Done! Now we wait for the birth of the dragon vein!”

“It’s time to return home!”

“Let’s go!”

Wang Xian left without looking at the dead silent aftermath of the bloodshed. His memories brought him back to the time when the Dragon Palace had been established and the killings that took place.

The scenes of countless lives being lost resurfaced in front of him.

For many rulers, the path to victory was paved by endless corpses.

Those who win get to have their noses up in the air, while those who lose will have their bodies buried six feet under.

“Haha, I found the spiritual energy waterfall!”

In less than half an hour, another group of martial artists was seen approaching the spiritual energy waterfall. As they looked at the waterfall, far-off in mid-air, their eyes became filled with anticipation.

They quickened their pace and moved swiftly towards the waterfall.

When they finally reached the foot of the mountain, their faces turned pale.

They stared at the horrifying scene and broke out in a cold sweat as terror struck them.

The place was filled with lifeless corpses!

At the same time, another group of menacing-looking experts was spotted in the air.

There were about thirty of them, each emitting an aura of terror and might.

They had no intention of hiding that they were a bunch of bashful and overbearing beings.

“Up ahead is the Yao Cauldron World. I wonder if any of the experts have arrived early.”

“Start occupying the spiritual energy waterfall and move according to plan!”

As the booming voices sounded in the skies, another Nine Cauldron World’s experts appeared.

The heyday of the Nine Cauldron Worlds was about to begin!
