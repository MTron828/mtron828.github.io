Chapter 1315: 1316 great grinding of the five elements

Time passed quickly. Wang Xian lay in a mysterious stone room in the main hall and absorbed the energy of the five elements in a frenzy.

Around him, the liquid-like energy of the five elements intersected chaotically. It came to Wang Xian’s side and slowly flowed in.

His body was 30 to 40 meters long. Every part of his body was absorbing the energy. As he inhaled and exhaled, the majestic energy was converted into Dragon Qi.

The five elemental spirit pearl above his head was getting brighter and brighter. There was a divine dragon rotating slowly on it.

The five elemental spirit Pearl was slowly converted into a dragon pearl.

“The five elements are mutually reinforcing and restraining each other. The energy that the five elements are mutually reinforcing represents destruction

“The energy that the five elements are mutually reinforcing represents good fortune

“Destruction and good fortune, destruction and creation!”

As he absorbed the five elemental attributes and immersed himself in the chaotic energy of the five elemental attributes around him, Wang Xian suddenly felt something in his heart.

He slowly opened his eyes. His left eye was blue while his right eye was red.

Following that, the dragon scales on his body began to emit different colors of light.

The five colors represented by the five types of energy -- metal, wood, water, fire, and earth -- slowly changed from the head all the way to the position of the dragon’s tail.

Following that, the position of the dragon’s tail changed to the position of the dragon’s head.

Back and forth, back and forth. It was unknown how much time had passed.

“Gold crack void!”

After an unknown period of time, Wang Xian suddenly opened his eyes. He felt something in his heart. The divine ability, gold crack void, was formed above his head.

“Wood crack void!”

After a few seconds, Wang Xian had a thought. Gold Crack Void was transformed into wood crack void.

The metal attribute was transformed into wood attribute.

“Ding! Congratulations to host for comprehending the wood attribute divine ability: wood crack void!”

At this moment, the system’s voice suddenly rang in Wang Xian’s mind. He ignored it and did not show any fluctuations.

“Water splitting void!”

“Fire splitting void!”

“Earth splitting void!”

Wang Xian stared at this divine ability. His heart moved again and changed rapidly.

The transformation of attributes and divine ability.

The system’s voice rang one after another. Wang Xian did not pay any attention to it.

Gradually, the Dragon Balls flew in front of him one by one and collided with each other.

Some of the collisions would cause explosions in the surroundings while some of the collisions would make one of the attributes stronger.

Whenever the two dragon balls collided, the sound of the system would appear in Wang Xian’s mind.

At the beginning, there were two types of dragon balls colliding. Later on, there were three types of dragon balls.

After the three types of dragon balls, there were four more types.

With each collision of the Dragon Balls, there would be destruction and creation energy.

Destruction that countered each other.

Creation that complemented each other.

Small green trees appeared out of thin air and grew rapidly.

Small trees could turn into gold trees, wood trees, water trees, fire trees, and earth trees!

There was a glow that was emitted after the collision of the Dragon Balls, and it was filled with deathly stillness.

The light produced by the collision of the Dragon Balls was filled with vitality.

Buzz

“The five types of energy are like a millstone when they are gathered together. In an instant, they represent vitality. Counter-clockwise, they represent destruction!”

“The combination of attributes is like the operation of a Millstone!”

After an unknown period of time, Wang Xian suddenly felt something in his heart.

Since coming to the demi-human graveyard for more than half a year, Wang Xian had spent at least half of his time comprehending the combination of attributes.

Not long ago, he had already comprehended the combination of four attributes and was about to have a breakthrough.

However, in this land of five elements, when the five elemental spirit pearl transformed into the Dragon Pearl, all kinds of comprehensions of the combination of five elements entered his mind.

In just half a month, the system notifications in his mind had never stopped.

During this period, he had comprehended 30 to 40 supernatural powers.

However, at this moment, Wang Xian had a new understanding of the five elements.

Life and destruction!

“The five elements are mutually reinforcing, the five elements are mutually reinforcing, the Five Elements Millstone, the five elements Millstone!”

He opened his eyes and stared at the dragon bead in front of him as he muttered!

“The five elements millstone, condense!”

Wang Xian’s gaze focused as he let out a soft shout. The endless five elements energy in the surroundings suddenly surged crazily into the five elements dragon bead.

The five dragon balls began to revolve rapidly. Liquid-like energy gathered around the five elemental dragon balls and slowly condensed.

Soon, a one-meter-wide water-quality millstone appeared.

However, this did not stop. Everything had just begun.

In the stone chamber, the terrifying liquid-like energy surged into the five elemental millstone once again.

The water-quality millstone began to solidify.

“Roar!”

Wang Xian let out a soft roar. In the middle of his body, the five elements origin stone plate that he had obtained on Earth flew out slowly and entered the five elements millstone.

Buzz

When the energy from the origin entered the millstone, the absorption speed of the five elements became even more terrifying.

The five elements energy in the stone chamber began to thin out at a terrifying speed.

Crack! Crack! Crack

After a day, the ground began to collapse and a large amount of five elements energy surged into the stone chamber from below.

Wang Xian looked at the five elements Millstone quietly.

This was his natal artifact that he had unintentionally created by comprehending the Five Elements with the help of the five elemental dragon pearl.

Five Elements Millstone!

The energy of the five elements gradually dried up.

There was no more energy in the stone chamber.

A two-meter-long millstone was suspended in the sky. The millstone was emitting five-colored rays of light.

Yao Lin, who was at the side, looked at this scene with a shocked expression. His body was trembling on the ground.

Wang Xian raised his dragon head slightly and the two-meter-long millstone of the five elements entered his body directly.

Crack! Crack! Crack

“Hiss!”

A tearing pain suddenly came from his body. The Five Elements Millstone began to operate on his body.

“Ding! Congratulations to host for comprehending the five elements divine ability, the five elements Millstone!”

“Ding! The Five Elements Millstone has destroyed the other five elements!”

“Hiss, I didn’t expect to be able to completely control the five elements. The changes are so huge. All the supernatural abilities of the five elements have been obliterated, leaving only the great grinding of the five elements!”

Wang Xian swayed his body as he looked at his body that was more dazzling and corporeal than before. He felt that his strength had at least doubled.

Apart from that, the recovery of energy had also increased by a lot.

In his mind, the usage of the five elements had reached a terrifying level.

“Five elements grindstone!”

His body moved and a huge grindstone that occupied the entire stone room appeared out of thin air.

On this millstone, five 50-meter-long divine dragons were binding it with five elemental chains.

As long as Wang Xian had a thought, the five metal, wood, water, fire, and earth divine dragons would be able to pull this huge millstone.

When the five elemental millstone was activated, it would either bring about a dense life force or a terrifying destruction!
