2684 2684 experts from the horizon great sect who had disappeared

“Sirs, what’s the matter?”

The six looked at the four elders from the horizon great sect and asked somewhat nervously.

The elders from the horizon great sect were experts on the same level as their forefathers.

“Have you seen an elder from our horizon great sect and more than 60 godly monarch experts?”

An elder in the middle asked again with a frown.

“An elder of the world margin great sect? No, we have not met the elder of the world margin great sect.”

The six experts of last month’s great sect immediately shook their heads.

“Are there no experts of our world margin great sect here?”

The four elders of the world margin great sect frowned slightly and confirmed again.

“Sirs, we can confirm that there are no elder experts of the world margin great sect here.”

“However, if the warriors from the world margin sect are hiding, we don’t know.”

The six shook their heads again.

“No?”

The four elders looked at each other, they could feel that everything they said was true.

As for elder Yao and the others hiding, that was obviously impossible.

“What do you think of the Dragon Palace’s strength? Can they instantly kill an undying level 9 warrior?”

One of the elders suddenly asked.

“HM?”

The six heard their words and were stunned, their expressions changing.

“Speak!”

The elder saw their hesitation and frowned, shouting softly.

A terrifying pressure instantly enveloped them, causing them to be in a daze.

“It should be possible. The Dragon King and the others should be able to do it.”

“The Dragon Palace has an extremely powerful assassin. I think it can be done.”

The six of them were emotionally unstable, and they couldn’t help but say this under the pressure.

“Okay!”

The four elders of the world margin sect said faintly. They looked around and returned the way they came.

“Huff, Huff, Huff!”

The powerhouse from last month, who had been freed from the pressure of the four elders of the world margin sect, panted heavily, and his face revealed a frightened expression.

“What’s going on?”

“I don’t know. Let’s go. We’ll report this to the patriarch and the others!”

The six people’s expressions changed and they immediately flew toward the patriarch and the others.

“We can’t contact the old demon now. If he didn’t go to the side of last month’s great sect, then he must be at the Dragon Palace. One of the two sides is lying!”

In front of the Abyss, an elder from the world margin sect said with a twinkle in his eyes.

“Does the dragon palace dare to Offend Our World Margin?”

An elder beside him frowned and asked again.

Did they dare?

Even though the Dragon Palace was strong in their eyes, there was still a huge gap between them and the world margin.

If the Dragon Palace really dared to kill their world margin elder, that would be no different from courting death.

“The 6 from the great sect last month couldn’t lie, and the Dragon Palace has the ability to kill an undying level 9 warrior in an instant, let’s go test them again!”

One of the elders said.

The other three nodded slightly.

Very soon, they came to the front of Dragon Peak again. The four of them did not hesitate and flew directly to the commanding platform of Dragon Peak.

“Everyone, what are you doing here again?”

Wang Xian raised his head slightly when he saw the four of them flying over again.

“Dragon King, do you know what the consequences will be if you dare to kill the elders of our world margin sect?”

The four of them were about 100 kilometers away from the dragon peak this time. They stared at Wang Xian from afar and probed him coldly.

“Oh? What do you mean?”

Wang Xian smiled slightly and looked at the sky array beside him.

“The elder of our world margin sect led a group of powerhouses to your side. There’s no news of him now. I’m afraid only you guys can make an immortal king level nine powerhouse disappear without any news, right?”

Another elder of the world margin sect said coldly.

“I have a question. During the battle just now, why did the elder of your world margin sect come to our hunting territory?”

Wang Xian did not answer them. He narrowed his eyes slightly and asked.

...

“Dragon King, we are asking you now. where is the elder of our World Margin Sect Now? Or... has he been killed by you guys!”

The four elders of the world margin sect stared at Wang Xian with a grim expression.

The Dragon King’s attitude towards the four of them could make them sense that the Dragon King did not put them in his eyes.

This made their guesses more certain.

Perhaps, elder Yao was really killed by the Dragon Palace.

The four of them were filled with killing intent. At the same time, they were also staring at their surroundings vigilantly.

This was also the reason why they were directly facing each other from a distance of 100 kilometers away, unlike the previous time when they were two thousand meters away.

“It’s the people from the world’s end sect who are courting death!”

Wang Xian said slowly.

“What? It’s really the Dragon Palace who did it!”

“Courting Death!”

“Dragon Palace, you are courting death!”

When the four of them heard Wang Xian’s words, their expressions changed. In the next moment, an extremely terrifying aura burst out from their bodies.

Buzz

However, at this moment, the entire world suddenly underwent a terrifying change.

Black holes appeared out of thin air in the surrounding void. This strange space was not very large, and it just happened to envelop the four members of the world margin sect.

The black holes disturbed the space, and it came from the formation personally set up by the Heaven Formation.

“What? Dragon King, what are you trying to do?”

When the four elders of the world margin sect saw the strange space that suddenly appeared, a bad premonition shrouded their hearts. They shouted sternly.

Boom! Boom! Boom

At this moment, two monsters formed from Thorns appeared on the left and right of the Dragon Peak. They locked onto the three of them completely.

“What are you trying to do? Of course, I’m trying to destroy all of you. The people of the world margin sect are really arrogant. You came directly to our Dragon Palace’s territory to hunt down the abyssal seeds. You Don’t even put us in your eyes!”

Wang Xian replied coldly.

“For the sake of some abyssal seeds, your dragon palace dares to make an enemy out of the Heaven’s end sect?”

The four elders of the Heaven’s end sect stood together and asked as they sensed their surroundings. They were prepared to break through to this strange space.

“Of course, it’s not just that. If there’s anything to blame, it’s all your fault for hunting down Qing Yue and Lingxiu a few years ago!”

“Kill them!”

As Wang Xian spoke, a violent killing intent surged from his body as he roared immediately.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Two monsters formed from Thorns instantly appeared in front of them.

“Dragon King, you are seeking your own destruction!”

The four World Margin Elders roared sternly. Faced with the attacks of the Dragon Palace, they did not feel much fear. Instead, they felt more anger.

A small Dragon Palace dared to kill the experts of the world margin great sect. They were seeking destruction.

“Block them. As long as they can hold on for a few minutes, the patriarch and the others will come and kill everyone from the Dragon Palace. Leave No one alive!”

An elder of the world margin great sect roared furiously.

“Boom!”

Their bodies moved, and layers of laws appeared in front of them.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

“Crack! Crack! Crack!”

However, the next moment, when the thorns landed on their defense, the four of them were completely stunned!
