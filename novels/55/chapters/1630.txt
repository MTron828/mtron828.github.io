Chapter 1631: Above 1631’s head, the five elements were grinding against each other

“Are you looking for death in this vast area?”

Two huge pupils flew over. One was black and the other was white, and the five elements were surrounding them.

Seeing these pupils, everyone couldn’t help but feel slightly shocked.

These pupils were too strange.

However, what shocked everyone even more was that the dragon pupils actually made a sound.

The two dragon eyes were suspended in the air for a thousand meters, and they were filled with killing intent as they stared at everyone in the vast area.

“What are these things?”

The three ancestors of the Wuji Empire who were about to make a move were slightly stunned as they stared at the two enormous dragon eyes with some vigilance.

“What are those? What Strange Pupils!”

All the soldiers and citizens of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire looked over with faces filled with shock, and their eyes were filled with doubt.

Two vivid pupils floated in the sky, as if they were monitoring the heavens.

Under the gaze of these pupils, everyone felt their hearts palpitate.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

“It’s Xiaoxian, Xiaoxian has been resurrected!”

All the disciples of the Dragon Palace, Guan Shuqing, and the others looked excited when they saw this pair of pupils and the familiar aura.

“I’m asking you, are you here to die?”

Another cold voice filled with killing intent was heard.

This cold voice didn’t come from that pair of strange and mysterious eyes, but from the east.

Everyone had already stopped what they were doing and looked to the east in unison.

A figure, a figure 150 meters tall.

Everyone was extremely familiar with this figure.

Because this figure had stirred up the wind and clouds in the entire vast area.

Compared to the monstrous demonic qi or the figure that covered the sky and covered the sun, the figure in the east was only 150 meters tall.

However, the five elements millstone that was floating in the sky had a circumference of 10 kilometers.

It was also the Yin-yang tai chi that was floating below.

The five elements millstone was above his head while he was standing on the yin-yang Tai Chi.

The Five Elements Millstone was spinning while the yin-yang tai chi was spinning.

Wang Xian was suspended in the middle as he stared coldly at everyone in the vast area.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

“Haha, it’s The Dragon King. The Dragon King is here. This is so cool!”

“Is the Dragon King a God? What is that thing that looks like a millstone in the sky? What is that light and darkness thing beneath him? It’s simply the descent of a God!”

“The Dragon King is here. As long as the Dragon King is here, what do we have to fear in the vast region?”

Before the members of the Dragon Palace could get excited, all the citizens of the dragon-phoenix Imperial City cheered excitedly.

In the eyes of the people of the dragon-phoenix Empire, the Dragon King had long become an invincible God.

From the establishment of the dragon-phoenix Empire to the unification of the flowing sea region by the dragon-phoenix Empire, it had only been less than three years.

Every time the dragon and Phoenix Empire faced a crisis, the Dragon King would be able to resolve it easily.

The People’s trust in the Dragon King had reached the level of blind worship.

Upon seeing Wang Xian’s appearance, everyone’s faces were filled with excitement and excitement.

“Phew, Little Xian’s strength seems to be much stronger than before!”

Feng Luan heaved a sigh of relief when she saw Wang Xian flying over in a domineering manner.

Once she transformed into a fire phoenix, she would really be on a path of no return.

“What? This... This is the Sky Demon?”

“This is the Sky Demon? Isn’t the Sky Demon already dead? How is this possible?”

“What a terrifying aura. Who... who is he?”

However, at this moment, everyone in the vast region was stunned.

The Wang Xian who flew over was exactly the same as the sky demon they saw back then. Even his voice was the same. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

However, wasn’t the heavenly demon already dead?

How could he still appear.

“Heavenly Demon, I didn’t expect you to Still Be Alive!”

The supreme headmaster was the first to recognize Wang Xian’s aura. When he saw Wang Xian who was exuding a powerful aura, his eyes were filled with brutal killing intent.

The Heavenly Demon was actually alive.

“Wuji Empire, I didn’t expect you guys to get involved as well!”

Wang Xian completely ignored the supreme sect leader. The current him could completely disregard the solipsistic sect.

He stared at the three patriarchs of Wuji Empire and swept his gaze across everyone in Wuji Empire. There was no emotion in his eyes.

“I didn’t expect Reverend Wang to Still Be Alive!”

When Patriarch Dark Eye saw Wang Xian’s sudden appearance, he frowned slightly.

Priest Wang, the name of the Saint of Light, was conferred by Patriarch Dark Eye back then.

“Let me introduce myself. Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian. Anyone who dares to offend the Dragon Palace or the Dragon Phoenix Empire will be executed!”

The killing intent on Wang Xian’s body gathered rapidly as his figure moved.

Carrying the five elements great mill and Yin-yang tai chi, he attacked the three patriarchs of the Wuji Empire directly.

“Arrogant! So what if you are a Sky Demon? Do you think you can fight against our Wuji Empire? !”

The patriarch of dark patterns, who had just advanced to the ninth level of the Seethrough void tier, shouted coldly when he saw Wang Xian coming at him.

He waved his arm and numerous dark spears that were a thousand meters in size directly attacked Wang Xian.

“Since you have provoked our Wuji Empire, we will let you die again!”

The other patriarch of the Wuji Empire stared at Wang Xian with murderous intent.

One by one, the Dark Lions attacked Wang Xian.

“The Wuji Empire is not something you can invade!”

Patriarch of the dark eye sighed softly.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian smiled when he saw the three patriarchs of the Wuji Empire attacking him.

“I’ll use you guys to test my strength!”

“Yin-yang dual polarity, activate!”

Buzz

Yin-yang dual polarity, light and darkness enveloped the area. The shadow of yin and Yang Taiji appeared around Wang Xian.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

The long spears, the Berserk Beasts, and the ghostly shadows landed on Wang Xian’s body and were easily deflected by the yin-yang dual polarity.

“Eh?”

When the three patriarchs of Dark Eye clan saw how easily Wang Xian deflected their attacks, they were slightly shocked.

“Yin and yang concealment!”

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a hint of coldness. His gaze landed on the weakest patriarch of Dark Mark clan, and his figure moved.

Boom

On the Yin and Yang Extremes, the light instantly rippled in the surroundings. Everything within a radius of ten kilometers was instantly covered by the light.

“Disappear!”

The three patriarchs of the Wuji Empire felt the light around them and their bodies shook.

The monstrous devil flames quickly chased away the light around them.

“Pu!”

“Ahhhhh!”

Suddenly, a scream came out of nowhere.

“Dark Mark!”

The faces of Patriarch Dark Eye and the other patriarch changed drastically when they heard the voice. They quickly turned around.

“Wuji Empire, no matter what your reason is, if you dare to invade the dragon-phoenix Empire, we will fight to the death in the future!”

“Today, I want to see how many of you can escape from the flowing sea region!”

A cold voice came from afar.

Dark eye patriarch and the other Patriarch’s eyes instantly turned blood-red. They stared at the dark mark that was directly cut off by the Dragon Claw.

An expert at level nine of the Seethrough realm was actually killed in an instant.

Moreover, this was in a one-on-three situation.

“All the disciples of the Dragon Palace and all the generals of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, Listen Up! Kill! !”

Wang Xian’s voice covered the entire sky!
