Chapter 3018: 3017 killed his way out, intimidating the others

“Dragon King, this is the work of a rank eight divine emperor and a wizard. He erased all traces of this place!”

Somewhere on the nine obliteration planet, Tian Chen looked ahead and frowned.

After finishing off the two experts of the brain spirit race, they continued to search for traces.

This time, they received even worse news.

There were level eight divine emperor Magi who came to investigate.

A race that could casually send out a level eight divine emperor powerhouse should be considered relatively strong among the domain level.

“Let’s continue!”

They continued to search. One by one, the people who entered the planet were found by the Heaven Formation. These people were all people who captured a citizen of the planet and threatened him. After threatening him, none of them survived.

In three hours, Wang Xian and the rest found more than ten people from different races.

“HMPH, how dare a few races act so arrogantly in our Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a cold expression.

“Dragon King, this is the information that we have already found. There are still some information that we have yet to find out.”

The heaven’s formation said with a twinkle in his eyes.

These were only some people who had entered the planet. There were also many people who had yet to enter the planet.

Based on a rough estimation, there were at least 20 powerhouses from different forces who had arrived in the resplendent starry sky.

Among them, 13 of them were infected by the poisonous horned dragon species.

“Since they are attacking us and coveting us, we don’t have to be afraid. An lie, search the universe’s AI for the demonic wind tribe, the living soul tribe, and the thousand-hand tribe. Head to their lair. How dare a few small tribes Covet Our Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian said with a face full of killing intent.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

An lie nodded immediately.

“Since they want to kill us, let’s kill our way there in advance!”

“Just in time. We can kill our way out!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were shining.

Using the blood of the races in the center of the universe to increase the strength of the Dragon Palace.

An lie searched immediately. It was easy to search the lair of some tribes. When he found a star map, an Lie’s figure disappeared immediately.

With an Lie’s speed, it was hundreds of times faster than the speed of light. It was not an exaggeration to say that an lie’s second was equivalent to one light year.

With the star map, he could reach the nests of those tribes in less than half an hour.

With such great mobility, he could visit all the tribes in the center of the universe within a day.

“Dragon King!”

After more than an hour, an lie appeared in front of Wang Xian.

“I’ve already investigated the demon wind race!”

An lie reported respectfully.

“Oh? The Demon Wind Race has been investigated? Bring Ao Yao and the rest back to the Dragon Palace and prepare for the hunt!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and said to an lie.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

An lie cracked a smile. With a move, he disappeared instantly.

After returning to the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian brought Ao Yao and the rest of the twenty strongest thorny dragons along with him.

Then, they appeared in the sky above a planet.

“Dragon King, this is one of the main planets of the demonic wind tribe. According to the information I received, there are a few blessed lands of the demonic wind tribe below!”

An lie immediately reported.

“Sky Formation, check the strongest combat strength on this planet!”

Wang Xian immediately instructed the sky array.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The sky array nodded and took out a compass to scan the area in front of him.

“One level eight divine emperor!”

The sky array immediately said.

“Let’s go and start the hunt!”

“Sky Array, pass ao Yao and the rest the location. We will assassinate them!”

Wang Xian said coldly.

The sky array nodded.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Wang Xian and the group of thorned dragon species flew towards the planet below.

Their speed was very fast. This time, they were all the strongest elites of the Dragon Palace.

Wang Xian flew straight towards the center.

“An lie, investigate the exact location of the level eight divine emperor!”

Wang Xian instructed an lie.

“Yes, Dragon King. I can already sense the level eight celestial thearch the moment I appeared!”

An lie replied.

“It’s alright. It’s fine to lure him out. I’ll launch a fatal attack immediately!”

Wang Xian replied.

“Yes!”

An lie nodded.

The two of them landed on a planet.

The level eight celestial thearch lived in a blessed land with mountains and rivers. They were within a range of 100 kilometers.

Wang Xian looked at an lie.

An lie nodded his head and disappeared instantly.

“Who is it?”

Very soon, an extremely cold shout was heard. Following that, a powerful force was transmitted from a cave.

A ten-meter-tall figure that was enveloped by a hurricane flew out. He stared at an lie with a face full of killing intent.

“This is the time!”

When he saw the level eight celestial thearch who flew out, a cold killing intent appeared in Wang Xian’s eyes.

The incipient Saint Wings instantly appeared behind him. His dragon eyes locked onto him directly.

“Hualala.”

The chains appeared out of thin air and completely sealed off the level eight celestial thearch of the demonic wind race.

“Die!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with killing intent. The Five Elements Dragon Claws attacked him.

“What?”

The strong practitioner of the demonic wind tribe who was suddenly attacked sensed the changes in his surroundings and his expression changed drastically.

He turned around hurriedly. The strong practitioner of the wind attribute of the demonic wind tribe was very fast.

However, he was still far from being able to match up to the inceptive sage wings.

“PFFT!”

The five elements dragon claws penetrated his body directly as the grayish death energy enveloped him.

“Cough Cough Cough Cough!”

“Who are you?”

He widened his eyes and turned his head in shock. His body trembled as he growled in a low voice.

“Dragon Palace, Dragon King!”

Wang Xian replied indifferently without any sense.

Boom

He waved his dragon claws and absorbed all of his life force into the mother nest.

“Deputy clan leader!”

“Deputy clan leader!”

At this moment, exclamations were heard. More than a dozen experts from the demonic wind clan who had sensed the commotion over here flew over.

There were two level seven celestial thearch experts while the rest were all level six celestial thearch experts.

Boom! Boom! Boom

However, before they could react, Wang Xian flew over and killed them instantly.

They didn’t even have the ability to resist and were killed without any reason.

This was how cruel the vast universe was.

After killing the experts of the demonic wind tribe in an instant, the situation over here didn’t cause any commotion.

Wang Xian waved his arm and left the words ‘Dragon Palace’on the ground.

“Mighty Dragon King, Invincible Dragon King!”

An lie teleported over and flattered him.

“Let’s wait. Ao Yao and the others should be able to get rid of them soon!”

Wang Xian smiled.

“Hehe, Dragon King, I’ll take action too. Leave those guys below level five of the Celestial Thearch to me!”

An lie smiled as he spoke. He took out an array compass and disappeared in an instant.

An Lie’s assassination was even more terrifying than the hydralisk. With his current rank three divine emperor strength, he could instantly kill a rank four divine emperor.

Furthermore, a rank four divine emperor expert could not react at all. A rank five divine emperor expert would not be able to.

However, this was already terrifying enough.
