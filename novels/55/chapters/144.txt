Chapter 145: Selection of Disciples

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

The Thistles And Thorns Sect was an influential second-class sect in the province. They had a Half-step to Inborn Expert and dozens of Level-nine Martial Artists in the sect.

There were three sects in the southern province. One was the third-class sect, Green Lotus Sword Sect. Another one was also a second-class sect, Northern Summit Sect.

Of course, not including some substandard sects.

These three sects were recruiting disciples in the entire southern province. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

However, a few sects came to Rivertown for recruitment because there were no sects in the Rivertown, except for those Martial Art families.

But the families never released their Art of Cultivation to outsiders. This meant that there was a chance of finding many talented people in Rivertown.

On top of that, the Yan Family was said to be exterminated by a mysterious expert. These sects got outrageous since the Rivertown suffered a loss in strength.

“Looks like there isn’t many powerful sects or families in the entire southern province!” Wang Xian looked at the information he got and grinned.

Tomorrow, I shall check them out with Xiao Yu! Wang Xian thought to himself. He then shut down his computer and walked towards his dormitory.

The next morning, Wang Xian received a notification from Xiao Yu that her master agreed to let him come along.

At about 6 pm, Wang Xian arrived at the school entrance.

When he reached it, he spotted Xiao Yu waiting with a woman.

Wang Xian looked at her.

Referring to her as a woman sounded a little too old for her.

She should be a young woman, as she looked to be about 30 years old with a perfect figure.

This was the best figure Wang Xian had ever seen, wearing quaint clothes.

Her hair was bunned up, and she had fair and flawless skin. Her watery and bright eyes looked very beautiful.

In comparison, even Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue lost out to her as their charms were lacking.

“Xiaoyu!” Wang Xian put on a smiling face as he shouted.

“Brother!” Xiao Yu beamed as she waved her hand. She immediately turned to the woman and said, “Master, he’s my elder brother!”

“Okay!” That woman nodded as she fixed her gaze on Wang Xian and began to observe him before shifting her eyes away again.

“Brother, this is my master!” Xiao Yu introduced softly.

“Hello.” Wang Xian greeted the woman.

“Mmm. Follow me. It’s getting late!” the woman said to them with a nod.

“Yes, Master!” Xiao Yu stuck out her tongue and beckoned Wang Xian as they followed her master to a Mercedes car.

“Elder Fang.” A middle-aged driver greeted the woman respectfully in the car.

“Let’s go!” said the woman.

“Yes!” The driver nodded and started the car immediately.

“Brother, my master wanted me to remind you not to speak or walk around when you’re there. Just keep still and watch. There should be a lot of people tonight,” Xiao Yu whispered a reminder to Wang Xian in the back of the car.

“Don’t worry!” Wang Xian smiled and patted her head.

The car drove out of the city for an hour before they came to the cross-border between Rivertown and Pengzhou.

Pengzhou was Wang Xian’s hometown, but they were still far from his home.

The car stopped in a somewhat remote area, where there was a small neighborhood.

When the car entered, Wang Xian realized that this district was not as simple as it seemed.

The environment in this district was pleasant. But in this neighborhood, someone could jump up to a stone platform that was as high as three to four meters.

Many weapons like machetes, spears, and rods were found in the surroundings, which seemed a little out of the world.

This must be a branch of the Thistles And Thorns Sect, or their headquarter!

Wang Xian pondered to himself when the car was parked in a parking lot.

Wang Xian looked around and realized many branded cars were parked over here.

There were a total of forty to fifty cars with Pengzhou and Rivertown’s car plates around.

“Follow me!” the woman said coldly, leading them from the front.

They came to somewhere at the back with a training ground in front. But a crystal-like thing was placed in the middle of it.

The crystal was a hexagon shape, emitting a special glow that looked extraordinary, with tall and huge poplars surrounding it.

At this time, hundreds of people were standing in the field.

There was a middle-aged man in a suit with a juvenile beside him, and a well-dressed old man with his grandchild.

Based on their dressing, it was easy to tell that they were rich people.

“Both of you wait here and don’t run around. The sect will begin the test later. I’ll be leaving to settle some stuff now.”

Xiao Yu’s master reminded them of this before she walked to a room.

Xiao Yu nodded and looked around with curiosity.

“So many people? At least dozens of them want to join the Thistles And Thorns Sect!” Wang Xian observed the surrounding with a curious look on his face.

“Brother, not every one of them can enter the sect. Most of them will be eliminated,” Xiao Yu said to him with pride on her face, “But my master said that I just need to go through the process. After that, I can join the Thistles And Thorns Sect for sure!”

“You’re amazing!” Wang Xian smiled and said to Xiao Yu.

“Of course. I’m definitely awesome!” Xiao Yu raised her chin slightly and said in a cute voice.

“Sigh, I wonder if my child can make it into the Thistles and Thorns Sect!”

“Certainly, Director Zhao. Your son is suave and charming. He must be a talent!”

“I hope so. Director Wang, your son has an eighty percent chance. I heard he was praised by an expert!”

“Hehe, well, my son did not let me down. That expert said my son has high hopes!”

“This time, it is a rare opportunity in the last ten years for Thistles and Thorns Sect to recruit disciples in the open. I hope my son or daughter can get in!”

The discussions around Wang Xian made him understand something.

The Thistles and Thorns Sect not only sent their men to recruit disciples. Some people with resources brought their children to join too.

It would just depend on their endowment to join the sect.

“Hey, excuse me.”

Just then, a voice that was louder than the discussion was heard.

Everyone was discussing at a soft volume, as they did not dare to raise their voice.

Apparently, this person did not care about it.

All the people frowned slightly and looked over with a displeased look.

“That is the Song Family!”

“It’s the Song Family. I heard that someone from the Song Family joined the Thistles and Thorns Sect a few decades ago. Now, he’s the elder of the sect. Each time, a member of the Song Family can join the Thistles and Thorns Sect directly!”

“Song Family of Pengzhou. They are the colossal existence in Pengzhou. No wonder they dare to raise their voice here!”

“That juvenile is Song Aowen. I heard he was selected by that elder in the Song Family when he was a child. That elder taught him cultivation art. Now, he’s only eighteen, and he is already a Level-four Martial Artist with astonishing talents. He almost can join the Thistles and Thorns Sect straightaway!”

“One that is favored by God! This is the supreme talent!”

One by one, they spun around to look at the incoming person with amazed looks on their faces.

Xiao Yu also looked over with her curiosity piqued. An imposing juvenile in white had his chin up, and a haughty look on his face.

“A Level-four Martial Artist. He’s awesome!” Xiao Yu exclaimed softly with a face full of envy!

“You will soon become one too. Don’t worry.” Wang Xian smiled. Given Xiao Yu’s Inborn Constitution now, she could easily hit level four.

“Heh, do you think it’s that easy to become a Level-four Martial Artist?”

At this time, a contemptuous voice was heard!
