“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

In the Void, a rumbling sound was heard. The sky formation was suspended in the void, and vast energy was emitted from his body!

He stood on the planet in the center, and the nine life planets around him were easily moved by him like dolls!

Law that could be seen by the naked eye connected the nine life planets in a straight line. From Afar, it was filled with a shocking power!

He was able to control the nine planets by himself!

“This is?”

In the Void, Chaos Tiger Monarch and the others who were following behind after hearing the news had shocked expressions on their faces when they saw this scene!

“That figure, his strength...”

Chaos Tiger Monarch and Imperial Preceptor’s pupils constricted slightly as they looked at the sky array that stood on a planet. Their faces were filled with shock!

“So powerful, this power is not inferior to Grandpa!”

The expression of the imperial preceptor changed as he looked at the vast figure in shock!

“He is much stronger than us. Also, he is an array master, an extremely powerful array master!”

At this moment, the old Imperial Preceptor’s figure appeared at the side as he looked forward with a twinkle in his eyes!

“What? Stronger Than You, Old Nation Master. How... how could the dragon palace have such a terrifying existence! ?”

Chaotic Tiger Nation Master’s mouth was slightly agape. He felt that it was somewhat inconceivable!

“The Dragon Palace is somewhat inconceivable!”

The old nation master muttered!

“Weng!”

At this moment, the void trembled. In the sky, nine stars revolved around a planet in the center. A vast wave of energy poured from these nine planets into the planet in the center!

“This is? Drawing the energy from the 9 life planets to pour into the planet in the center, what array is this? How terrifying!”

The old imperial tutor stared wide eyed, shocked!

Even though he had already reached undying god King Level 7, he was still shocked by the scene in front of him!

The sky locking array was formed 5 hours later, the sky array moved and stepped into the planet in the center, changing the world!

For half a month, the heaven-locking formation was transforming the entire planet. Buildings were erected one after another!

The most important training ground took nearly ten days!

Later on, Wang Xian joined in to transform the planet!

Half a month later, a brand new planet appeared. Wang Xian floated in the void and looked down with a smile on his face!

The planet was in a mystical style. There were no metal buildings!

However, due to the existence of various special formations, the planet was filled with fantasy!

Boom

At this moment, the nine planets around them trembled and the law beams slowly disappeared!

“Very good!”

Wang Xian revealed a satisfied expression and nodded his head slightly!

“Dragon King, these nine life planets can only last for fifty years before they wither. When the time comes, we need to change the planets!”

The sky array flew over with a satisfied look on its face!

“It’s enough!”

Wang Xian nodded his head!

“Dragon King, who is this?”

At this moment, the old imperial preceptor of the chaotic tiger nation flew over. He looked at the sky array with fear and respect in his eyes!

“A member of the Dragon Palace, Dragon Witch!”

Wang Xian looked at the sky array and spoke directly!

The sky array cupped its hands at them!

“I really didn’t expect the Dragon Palace to have such an expert!”

The old national advisor cupped his hands at the sky array and sighed slightly!

“The planet has been built and is ready to open for business at a certain time. In addition, all the unique and valuable items in your chaotic Tiger Demon Nation will be sold on the Planet!”

Wang Xian said to the old national advisor and the rest!

“Alright, we will prepare!”

The old National Master nodded his head!

“Let’s Find a place to discuss about the business planet!”

Wang Xian said to them with a smile!

Although the business planet was densely packed with formations, there was a need for law enforcement and deterrence!

There was also a need for many talents and staff to manage a planet!

All of this would be handled by the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation!

...

The other issue was the split. After a series of discussions, the Dragon Palace would be the sole owner of the training grounds while the rest would be split 60-40!

Six from the Dragon Palace and four from the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation!

This split was given by Wang Xian. In his opinion, 40% from the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation was already quite a lot! Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

After all, the most important thing on a commercial planet was the entire formation!

“Get the staff ready as soon as possible. We will set the opening time. Set up the teleportation formation now!”

Wang Xian said to the upper echelons of the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation!

“Don’t worry, Dragon King. Leave this to us!”

The old National Master of the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation and the rest nodded immediately!

“Alright, I’ll head back First!”

Wang Xian smiled and flew towards the Dragon Star immediately!

The Dragon Star was the commercial planet that they had built!

...

After entering the ocean of the Dragon Star, Wang Xian was immediately teleported to the Dragon Palace in the Tianze continent!

“Prime Minister Gui, how many desolate beasts have ao Qitian and the rest captured during this period of time?”

Wang Xian immediately came to the Dragon King Palace and asked Prime Minister Gui!

“Dragon Palace, in two months, they captured 500,000 eternal god Lord Desolate Beasts, more than 150 immortal king desolate beasts, 20 immortal king level 4 beasts, and one immortal King Level 5 Beast!”

Prime Minister GUI reported with a Smile!

With the space locking array, they did not need to use bait to capture beasts like before. As long as they found desolate beasts, they could immediately seal off the surrounding space to prevent escape!

This time, the Dragon Palace had sent out the fire hammer clan, Ao Qitian and the rest of the berserk dragon species, and the strange demon clan!

With over 100,000 members working together, it took them two months to capture such a god King desolate beast in the Lorman Desolate Beast Park!

This was an extremely terrifying income!

“Bring it over immediately. I’ll tame some of them first!”

With so many war pets, it would take Wang Xian at least a few months to tame all of them!

However, Wang Xian did not plan to sell all of them at once!

One of the reasons for selling war pets was to exchange for resources. Another reason was to increase the popularity of commercial planets!

He was prepared to take out some of them and sell a fixed number of them every day in order to attract more people to the commercial planet of Dragon Star!

“Handsome Wang Xian, how is the commercial planet? Do you need my help?”

At this moment, the Imperial Star Lady ran over with a face full of hospitality and said to him!

“Yes, of course I need the help of our superstar. When the time comes, you and Yinxuan will hold a concert!”

Wang Xian immediately smiled and nodded his head!

“Don’t worry, leave this small matter to me. I will definitely do it beautifully!”

The Celestial Queen raised her head and patted her chest!

“So Obedient!”

Wang Xian couldn’t help but take a look and said with a smile!

“Hehe, of course I’m obedient. I will hug the Dragon King’s thigh tightly in the future!”

The celestial queen said without the slightest bit of anger!

If it was in the past, she would have rolled her eyes at them!

There was nothing she could do. Ever since she learned that the god of Heaven’s formation had joined the Dragon Palace and became the Dragon King’s subordinate, she had been prepared!

She wanted to hug Wang Xian’s thigh tightly!

“Alright, Alright. I have nothing better to do. I have to get busy. You can discuss the concert with Yin Xuan and the rest!”

Wang Xian said with a smile!
