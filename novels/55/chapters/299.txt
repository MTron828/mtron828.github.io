Chapter 300: Call Daddy! (2)

As Xiao Yu, Guan Shuqing and the group rejected them, Ling Yi and the young man beside her instantly showed their displeasure.

“Hi, beautiful ladies, can you do your idol a favor?”

Ling Yi frowned and asked this to Xiao Yu, Guan Shuqing and the group.

Huh? Ling Yi’s response made the girls feel speechless and they found it hilarious.

Xiao Yu and Guan Shuqing shook their heads and replied, “We aren’t overzealous fangirls. We are sorry, we’re going back to our rooms.”

As they finished their words, they took their room cards from the front counter and prepared to head towards their rooms.

Ling Yi was shocked and embarrassed by the actions of these two fans.

“Wait a minute!”

At this moment, the young men standing by the side got serious. He tilted his chin up slightly, looked at Xiao Yu and the girls and said, “The rooms aren’t yours yet!”

After commenting, he took out his phone and made a call.

“Let’s go back and sleep!”

Wang Xian had been standing by the side, watching them silently. He found the whole incident hilarious and shook his head as he spoke to the girls.

Carrying their trophies of the day in his hand, Wang Xian and the group walked towards the elevator.

“I said, stand right there!”

Seeing that the group had totally ignored him, the young man’s face turned gloomy. “I’m calling the manager of this hotel. If you wish to be chased out of your room, feel free to go up right now.”

Wang Xian stopped in his tracks, turned to the young man and remarked, “Are you a dumbass? Embarrassing yourself over a room?”

He couldn’t understand how this young man thought. Perhaps he felt he was a notch above others and must stay in the best room!

“What did you say?”

The hand of the young man holding the phone stiffened as he glared coldly at Wang Xian.

“I’m calling you a dumbass. Is there something wrong with your ears?”

Xiao Yu pouted, looked at this young man and was speechless about his conduct.

“Haha! You dare to reprimand me in Shang Jing?” The young man was so angry that he laughed instead. With a sinister smile, he pointed at Wang Xian and shouted loudly.

“Indeed, he’s just another brat who is too used to being arrogant in Shang Jing!” commented Wang Xian as he looked at the young man.

“Arrogant? Let your daddy tell you this. In Shang Jing, your daddy can be as arrogant as he wants!”

The young man glowered at Wang Xian before looking across the crowd and saying, “These few girls are rather pretty. I’ll give you a way out now. Get out of here or... Your daddy will show you what is meant by arrogant!” He pointed at the group.

“Young Master Yuan, Young Master Yuan. Who is the one who has offended you...?”

Suddenly, a voice broke the standoff. A few middle-aged men walked in through the entrance of the hotel. From the group, a middle-aged man in a suit was shocked to see what was happening in the hotel as he dashed forward and shouted. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Manager Sun, the service of this place is getting worse and worse. I can’t even get a presidential suite here.”

Seeing Manager Sun running towards him, the young man remarked harshly.

“How can this be? How can this be? As long as you want it, we will definitely reserve a room for you unless all the rooms are sold. Otherwise, we would definitely not hold them back or not give them to you.”

Manager Sun ran forward with a smile to please the young man.

“Is it so? In that case, why did your guys give the presidential suites to others when we arrived at the same time? Could it be that this card you gave me is useless?”

Young Master Yuan looked at Manager Sun and the corner of his lips curved into a smirk.

“How can this be? How can this be? We will give it to Young Master Yuan even if it means not letting anyone else stay in it!”

Manager Sun put on a pleasing smile once again. Following which, he turned around, stared at the front desk attendants and shouted, “What are you guys doing? Can’t you handle something so simple? If Young Master Yuan wants the presidential suite, give it to him then! Do you guys still want your job?”

“Manager... We...” The two attendants stammered and felt bitter. However, they could only swallow their pride as they lowered their heads.

“Did you see this? Get out of here now!” the young man chided with contempt, looking at Wang Xian and the group.

“Scram! Since Young Master Yuan wants you to scram, you guys better scram!” seconded Manager Sun.

“YOU... You guys...”

Xiao Yu, Guan Shuqing and the girls stared furiously at the young man and Manager Sun beside him.

They had not expected the manager of the hotel to give away the rooms they had booked to others.

Wang Xian’s eyebrows knitted together. Mo Qinglong, who was standing by the side, stared at them coldly and clenched his fist lightly.

“Good evening, Sirs and ladies!”

Just as Mo Qinglong was about to strike, a rather desolate figure saw Wang Xian and the group. He was shocked and stunned for a few seconds. After which, he immediately rushed ahead.

Deep fear gleamed in his eyes.

Huh?

When the voice of the middle-aged man sounded and he appeared in front of the crowd, the crowd was taken aback. Manager Sun’s eyes popped wide open and he was flabbergasted.

“It’s you!” Guan Shuqing looked at the middle-aged man and exclaimed.

The middle-aged man looked decadent just like how he had appeared beside the plane in the day.

“Miss, good... Good evening!”

The middle-aged man greeted her in fear once again and looked at Guan Shuqing respectfully.

He was still on tenterhooks about what had happened on the plane earlier in the day. After recalling the entire incident, all he felt was fear.

His enemies had taken advantage of his easily angered personality as they forced him to strike on the plane. In the end, he almost lost all his rationality as he was shrouded in the desire for vengeance.

Subsequently, that horrifying old man, Sui Huang, appeared and killed his arch enemies with a single strike. Those were four Inborn experts!

As for him, he was still awaiting judgement from the old man after he broke the rules on the plane by fighting.

Whether he lived or died fell solely on the words of that old man.

With a whole afternoon to calm down, fear started welling up. If he was dead, what would be the outcome for his family and disciples?

They probably would be killed by his past opponents.

However, just as he was pondering how he could ask the old man to spare his life, he happened to meet this girl.

When they alighted from the plane, his mental state was dishevelled. Nonetheless, he still remembered clearly how that old man had looked at this girl dotingly.

He even called her his disciple.

She’s the disciple of that old man and that old man had not taken in any disciple for several dozens of years.

If he could convince the disciple of that old man to put in a word for him, his life might be spared.

He greeted Guan Shuqing anxiously and bowed sincerely.

“What? Good evening, Director Zhou!” Manager Sun looked at this boss in shock.

To his astonishment, the boss was bowing down to one of the girls that he had just tried to chase out of the hotel a while ago...

Bam!

The middle-aged man swung a slap over and chided, “You better watch your words closely next time. This is my last warning for you!”

“I... Yes! Yes, Director Zhou!” Manager Sun staggered back a few steps. His face swelled up instantly as he answered in horror.

“And you guys! Get out of my hotel and you are banned from entering in the future!”

The middle-aged man looked coldly at Young Master Yuan.

“Hehe! You guys deserve it!”

When Guan Shuqing, Xiao Yu and the group saw the situation, they smiled.
