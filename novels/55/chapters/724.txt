“Sorry, I’m Late!”

As the voice rang out, Wang Xian walked towards the banquet hall with a smile on his face.

At this moment, Wang Xian had a warm smile on his face. After advancing to Celestial Being, his aura was completely restrained.

In the past, there was a domineering and majestic aura coming from him. There was even a hint of murderous aura coming from him. Now, he looked like an ordinary person.

Upon hearing Wang Xian’s voice, everyone was slightly stunned. They looked towards the entrance in astonishment.

When they saw Wang Xian walking in wearing casual clothes with a smile on his face, a hint of astonishment appeared in the eyes of the martial artists of River City.

“The Dragon King’s aura has changed. He is no longer as lofty and domineering as before. He doesn’t put the world in his eyes anymore!”

“That’s because the Dragon King in the past was unrivaled in jianghu. But now, he is not stupid. He knows how to control himself!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Hehe, if the Dragon King still dares to be as arrogant as before, he will probably be killed by the immortal sect!”

Some of the martial artists saw Wang Xian’s genial expression and relaxed the tension in their eyes. A faint smile appeared on their faces.

“It’s fine, it’s fine. We’re just nagging. The celestial sect still has some matters to settle, so... Hehe!”

The fat middle-aged man was still standing there with a smile on his face as he spoke to Wang Xian cheerfully.

“Congratulations on the Dragon King’s return. May I know why the Dragon King invited us to a banquet?”

The old man who was slapping the table took a sip of his wine and asked Wang Xian.

The other four to five hundred martial artists looked at Wang Xian with a hint of curiosity in their eyes.

“It’s nothing. I just wanted to let everyone know that I’m Back!”

Wang Xian walked to the front of the banquet and turned his head slowly.

“Hehe!”

As soon as he finished his sentence, the fat middle-aged man and a few middle-aged men smirked.

The rest of the martial artists from Jiang City looked at Wang Xian indifferently and didn’t say a word.

Wang Xian wasn’t too surprised when he saw this scene. “I’m inviting everyone to a banquet today. The main point is to let everyone know that in Jiang City, it’s fine as long as you don’t disturb me. I don’t want to be troubled by some trivial matters!”

As he spoke, he raised a glass of red wine in front of the table lightly and gestured to everyone.

All the Warriors realized that the Dragon King of Dragon Gate, who was standing in front of them, had become much weaker. He was no longer as domineering as before.

This made everyone guess that the Dragon King of Dragon Gate was afraid of the immortal sect.

Some warriors immediately raised their wine glasses, while others did not move.

With their backs against the immortal sect, they could ignore the Dragon King!

“Dragon King, we will naturally not trouble you. However, this is the territory of the Mingwang Immortal sect and the puppet immortal sect. We Are Disciples of the immortal sect. We will listen to the orders of the immortal sect!”

A middle-aged man raised his wine cup and said to Wang Xian with a smile.

“Oh!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. A drakonid behind him moved.

“Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!”

In an instant, violent sounds were heard.

Among the people present, the strongest one was only at the Dan stage. No one could see the figure of the DRAKONID clearly.

“Crash!”

Under everyone’s stunned gaze, the middle-aged man who raised his wine cup flew out. He smashed through the glass of the hotel and spat out a mouthful of blood.

His Dantian was crippled and he flew down from the fifteenth floor.

Everyone in the banquet hall was stunned. Following that, a look of horror appeared on their faces.

“Impudent! How dare you attack a disciple of the Ming Wang Immortal Sect? Dragon King, you...”

The fat middle-aged man’s expression changed drastically. He pointed at Wang Xian and looked embarrassed.

Crack! Crack

“Ah, you guys actually crippled my Dantian. My daughter married an elite disciple of the immortal sect. You guys...”

Before the fat middle-aged man could finish his words, he felt his body suffer a terrifying attack.

His Dantian was directly shattered, and large mouthfuls of blood sprayed out.

His body also broke through the glass and fell down.

With their physiques, they would not die, but in the future, their path of martial arts would also be cut off.

Another person flew out.

Everyone’s faces changed greatly, and they looked at the young man standing in front with a smile on his face.

“He hasn’t changed. He still hasn’t changed!”

Everyone in the banquet hall trembled slightly and their foreheads were covered in cold sweat.

The Dragon King was not afraid of their identity as disciples of the immortal sect.

Those warriors who did not pick up their wine glasses shook their arms and quickly picked up the red wine in front of them. They looked at Wang Xian in shock.

The entire banquet hall fell silent in an instant. Only the sound of heavy breathing could be heard.

They were shocked. The Dragon King actually disregarded their status as disciples of the immortal sect and directly crippled the two of them.

Wang Xian raised his wine cup and gestured, “You don’t have any objections, right?”

This time, all the martial artists in Jiang City hurriedly drank all the wine in their wine cups.

“No, no. How would we dare to provoke you, Dragon King?”

An old man said hurriedly.

“That’s right, that’s right. In the future in Jiang City, Dragon King, if you have any instructions, just tell us directly!”

Another middle-aged man followed suit.

The current Dragon King with a smile was exactly the same as before!

He was still so unbridled!

“Interesting. He came uninvited!”

At this moment, Wang Xian turned his head and looked outside.

Warriors wearing thick metal clothes flew over directly. Apart from a metal object, there was also something that was flying in the sky like a sailboat.

There were ten young men sitting on the sailboat.

“Boom!”

The group broke through the glass and entered the banquet hall.

At the same time, figures emitting pure white light flew towards them in the dark night.

There were a total of seven figures flying towards them at a terrifying speed.

A middle-aged man with white hair. His white hair was not white. It was emitting a faint light.

Other than the middle-aged man, the rest of them were all young men. One of them was a girl.

The old man who was wearing the dark golden puppet armor bowed to the middle-aged man with white hair. Then, he turned around and looked around.

“Why? Do you guys still have to follow his orders in the future?”

The old man in the dark golden puppet armor clearly heard the voices here. His gaze swept across the warriors from the aristocratic families in Jiang city.

Beside him, the seven people who were emitting a faint light energy swept their gaze across the surroundings. Finally, their gaze landed on Wang Xian.

Two of the young men’s eyes were filled with killing intent.

“Deacon Zhang, it can’t be, it can’t be. We... We were forced by him too...”

The expressions of the Warriors from the immortal puppet sect changed slightly as they hurriedly spoke to the old man.

They heaved a sigh of relief when the deacon from the immortal sect arrived.

“Elder Ming!”

When the other group of martial artists from the Ming Wang Immortal sect saw the white-haired middle-aged man, a hint of shock flashed across their eyes as they hurriedly spoke respectfully.

“Yes!”

The middle-aged man nodded his head coldly as he stared at Wang Xian.

“Dragon King of the Dragon Gate? Do you know what this place is?”

“You called us disciples of the immortal sect over and even dared to cripple us disciples of the puppet immortal sect. Now, give us an explanation!”

Deacon Zhang stared at Wang Xian and said slowly.
