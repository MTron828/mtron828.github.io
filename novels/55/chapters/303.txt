Chapter 304: Crawl On Your Knees Over And Pay Respect To Great Martial Nanny (3)

An old man with a walking stick walked at the back of the pack. When he walked to Sui Ao, his body shivered a little as he glowered at him.

“Grandpa, what happened...?” asked Sui Ao cautiously. At this moment, the experts of the Sui Family of his grandpa appeared with him.

“What happened?” the old man growled while trying to keep his anger in check.

To the astonishment of the crowd, he waved his walking stick ruthlessly toward Sui Ao’s legs.

Bam!

Crack crack!

Without holding back at all, the walking stick swung heavily on Sui Ao’s legs. Sounds of his bones snapping instantly propagated throughout the lobby.

“Argh... Grandpa...”

Sui Ao shrieked in pain. However, the physical pain he felt from the body wasn’t what he was most concerned with right now as he looked in horror at the grandpa who had always doted on him dearly.

To his surprise, the old man with the walking stick didn’t even pay attention to him after hitting him and simply walked past him.

“This..”

The surrounding group of young men held their breath and they were terrified.

The current clan leader of the Sui Family and every member who held considerable influence in the clan were all here. These twenty people represented the Sacred Clan, Sui Family.

Moreover, they were the ones with speaking rights in the Sui Family currently.

Every single one of them had extremely large authority and influence. Sui Ao was just one of many grandsons when compared to these true big shots in the Sui Family.

Regardless of seniority or standing, Sui Ao was nowhere close.

However, the crowd was soon stunned and horrified by what was to come.

The clan leader of Sui Family and the third generation of Sui Family walked towards the girl that made the call directly and lowered their heads respectfully.

“Greetings, Martial Senior Aunt!”

“Greetings, Martial Senior Aunt!”

...

“Martial Senior Aunt! The clan leader of the Sui Family and the third generation of the Sui Family are addressing that girl as their Martial Senior Aunt!”

“Oh gosh... This... This...”

“The clan leader and a member of the upper management of Sui Family are calling that girl their Martial Senior Aunt. She... She... What’s her real identity?” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The surrounding group of young men looked on in horror and disbelief.

When Sui Ao saw his grandpa and the clan leader lowering their heads in front of the girl, his body couldn’t help but shiver in fear.

“Martial Senior Aunt... Martial Senior Aunt... Martial Senior Aunt...” He was in a daze as he mumbled. Slowly, fear and horror gripped him.

If that girl was the Martial Senior Aunt of his grandpa, wouldn’t that make her the disciple that his great great grandfather was taking in?

Oh gosh! His great great grandfather was an immortal-like existence in Sui Family and the true sole pillar of the Sui Family.

That phone call from before...

At the thought of this, his body started shivering violently. He didn’t dare to think about the consequences.

“It’s over, it’s over!”

At this point, Guan Shuqing was once again embarrassed by the group of old people addressing her as their Martial Senior Aunt. The age differences between them were too huge.

“That... Guys... Get up now! You don’t have to be so courteous!”

“It’s our fault that Martial Senior Aunt had to suffer such grievances in Shang Jing!”

The clan leader of the Sui Family continued deferentially. The disciple of their grandfather was deserving of them acting deferentially towards her.

The old men with the walking stick turned around, glared coldly at Sui Ao and demanded, “Crawl here on your knees and pay respect to Great Martial Nanny!”

“Yes, yes!”

When Sui Ao heard his grandpa’s voice, he immediately crawled over. His forehead was covered in cold sweat.

“Great Martial Nanny, this is all my fault. I failed to recognize you. It’s my fault. Please give me another chance!”

Sui Ao had completely lost his pride and arrogance as he kneeled there, apologizing constantly.

The group of young men behind him was paralyzed with fear.

Yuan Fei felt his whole body go numb as he lost all control of it and collapsed onto the floor. After which, he quickly went on his knees.

“I was wrong. I was wrong!”

When the group saw Yuan Fei go down on his knees, they also kneeled down in horror.

Sui Ao was the leader of this group. Now that even Sui Ao had to kneel down, they could only do the same in front of the Sui Family.

Tsk!

Guan Shuqing sneered at Sui Ao who was horrified and lost.

You were still so arrogant a while ago! Why are you acting like a wimp now?

“Martial Senior Aunt, grandpa instructed us to handle this matter. We will definitely give you a satisfactory answer!”

Seeing that Guan Shuqing was clearly still displeased, the clan leader of Sui Family spoke immediately.

“Hmm. In that case, I leave this to you. Thank you for rushing here at this hour!”

Seeing the group of old men being so respectful to her, Guan Shuqing spoke gently as she would feel bad if she continued to be demanding.

“It’s alright, it’s alright. Martial Senior Aunt, do you want to return with us to have a good rest?” the clan leader of the Sui Family asked, revealing a smile.

“No, thank you. I’ll just stay here for the night. I’ll see you guys tomorrow!”

“Alright. In that case, we shall not disturb Martial Senior Aunt!” said the clan leader of the Sui Family. After which, he looked to the group of old men that had come with him.

“Grandpa is dissatisfied with the current state of Sui Family. Aren’t some of our disciples from Sui Family getting too arrogant outside? It’s time to teach them a lesson.”

“Perhaps some of these juniors have forgotten about the sweat and tears our grandfathers and fathers shed to give us what we have today. It’s time we do something!”

As Sui Ao heard what the few old men said, his face turned as white as a sheet.

“Clan disciple Sui Ao has offended his senior and broken the rules of the clan. Your identity as a core disciple of the clan will be taken away and so will the benefits bestowed upon you. You shall now be deployed to manage the company!” The clan leader of the Sui Family gave his orders immediately.

Upon hearing this, Sui Ao felt desolated.

With all his rights as a disciple of Sui Family taken away from him, he could only be an ordinary member of the Sui Family and would have to work for the family. His future might end up even worse than ordinary Sui Family’s disciples.

All the young men around him were shocked and horrified.

Sui Ao was the most gifted in the current generation of the Sui Family. He was also ranked tenth on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart.

Yet, everything would be taken away from him as he would be shifted from the core of the family to the fringe businesses.

It would likely be difficult for him to make a comeback even if he made it to the Inborn Realm.

Or rather, without the resources provided to him by the Sui Family, how could he possibly reach the Inborn Realm?

His magnificent life could now be declared as completely finished.

Guan Shuqing looked plainly at Sui Ao. After bidding goodbye to the group of old men from the Sui Family, she followed Wang Xian and the group back to their rooms.

The clan leader of Sui Family looked at the middle-aged men standing beside their Martial Senior Aunt.

“We have investigated the matter in the day. If you do it again, our Sui Family will come and annihilate you!”

“Yes, yes! Thank you! Thank you, Clan Leader Sui!”

When Zhou Qingkong heard Clan Leader Sui, he was thrilled.

His meager life had finally been kept.

His gaze fell on the desolated Sui Ao as he couldn’t help but sigh.

You must be too eager to die. As a junior in the Sui Family, you stood up for others and humiliated the disciple of your great great grandfather. If this isn’t courting your own death, what else is?
