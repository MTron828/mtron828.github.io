Chapter 642: Kneel Down And Surrender (1)

“Senior brother, this merman is like the leader of the peculiar marine creatures. After awakening, it might be a peerless talent mermaid that could control water current!”

“That’s right. This foreign creature exists only in the vast ocean and was recorded as the Spiritual Beast. It’s my first time seeing this. Haha, guess our luck is good!”

The middle-aged man stared fervently at the merman and chuckled, “If we gave it good training, it would be a huge support to us. Unfortunately, none of us practice water-attributed skills!”

“Hur?”

The surrounding crowd that overheard their conversations revealed a surprised look.

Upon hearing what they said, the old dwarf’s eyes twinkled as he squinted and looked at them. “How much blood are you exchanging it for?”

“Idiot!” The plump lady beside swept at the group of fifteen. “You raise the price on your own. What a fool!”

“Bro, we, Raging Sea Wandering Group, practice water-attributed skills. This creature seems to have more affinity with us. I wonder what’s so special about this merman?”

An old man holding onto a longsword asked with a beaming face while a water snake was coiling itself on his longsword.

The middle-aged man slowly cast his gaze on the plump lady. With a broad smile, he stared at the merman in the middle. “A merman is priceless to water practitioners. But I want it. How much blood do you want?” the middle-aged man asked the old dwarf plainly.

“Dumbass!”

“What a fool to say this. Isn’t this giving a chance to Heavenly Spirits for them to quote any high price they want?”

“Which wandering group does this bunch of people belong to? I have never seen them before?”

“Newcomers, perhaps. But given this intelligence, they can’t live for long!”

Upon hearing what the middle-aged man said, everyone was watching with scornful looks.

“Such a creature is, of course, priceless. I want the fresh blood of fifty Inborn-level creatures, or five Dan Realm, or a Budding Realm expert. Haha!”

The old dwarf laughed out loud at the middle-aged man’s words.

“Heavenly Spirits, you really dare to quote such a high price!”

The old person with the longsword spoke with a darkened expression when he heard what the old dwarf said.

“Haha, it’s a divine creature. Of course, the value is relatively higher!”

The old dwarf looked at the middle-aged man and asked impassively, “If you can afford it, we can deal immediately!”

“No problem!”

The middle-aged man nodded with an unconcerned look.

His words brightened the mood of the old dwarf who was still slightly upset for quoting the low price.

Everyone just looked at the middle-aged man with astonishment.

“A Budding Realm expert is sufficient?” a young man beside the middle-aged man murmured.

As soon as his voice stopped, he vanished into thin air.

Ah!

Just then, a horrifying scream that lasted for one second was heard before it came to an abrupt end.

“Budding Realm blood. For you!”

While all the surrounding Martial Artists of the Wandering Groups were watching, that young man lifted the head of that plump woman and tossed it to the old dwarf.

“You...”

Bam, Bam, Bam!

All the people staggered back in trepidation as they fixed their eyes on the fifteen men with a mixed expression.

“Hey, what are you trying to do?”

The old dwarf glared at the gang with vigilance and fear.

“Who are you people? How dare you create trouble on the disordered island!”

The old man who had a tattooed face held out his weapon and stared at the middle-aged man with wariness.

All the surrounding experts of the Wandering Groups fixed their cold gazes at the group, exuding daunting aura from their bodies.

There was solemness in their eyes. That plump lady who had spoken just now was a strong Budding Realm expert. Her strength was not weaker than the leader of Devil Kid. Yet she was beheaded in a split second!

There were eight Budding Realm experts on the spot!

“HA HA!”

The middle-aged man let out a clap of hysterical laughter. “What are we trying to do? We are here to subdue all of you. Be honored that you can be recruited under Devil Sealing Immortal Sect!”

“Tsk, surrender to us now!”

The young man who just struck was looking thrilled. As he swept his gaze around all the people, domineering demonic aura rose from his body.

“Surrender!”

“Get down on your knees!”

Two young men exclaimed together with their demonic aura surging frantically.

Subsequently, the demonic aura rushed to the air, looming over the entire area with their demonic oppression.

The domineering oppression coagulated to form many Devil’s Doors with one exceptionally huge one in the air.

On those Devil’s Doors were huge malevolent demon patterns.

The area with a radius of a few kilometers was cordoned off by the demonic aura.

“What?”

In the face of such sudden change, all the wandering groups were shivering in their boots.

“What compelling strength! There are fifteen Budding Realm experts!”

The leader of Devil Kid, known as the Lord of the disordered region, was slightly trembling with the weapon in his hand.

When that young man beheaded the snake lady in an instant, he was already taken aback by surprise.

She was a Budding Realm expert. Killing her without a moment of pause despite it being a surprise strike already indicated the domineering skill of the young man.

However, the remaining fourteen were equally daunting.

Bang, bang, bang!

Those Martial Artists who were below the Dan Realm had a drastic change in their expressions. Their bodies seemed to be being suppressed by mountains. All of them gritted their teeth as they knelt down with eyes full of consternation. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“You have ten seconds. If you do not kneel and surrender, you’ll suffer the same consequences as that plump lady. Of course, you guys can also challenge us!” said the middle-aged man with a broad smile as he walked to the center and lifted his chin to look at all the people.

Gulp!

All the wandering groups were aghast as they looked around with fear.

“Who are you people?” the leader of Devil Kid asked, quivering slightly.

“You have no right to ask me!”

The middle-aged man smiled as he stared at Devil Kid. “Five more seconds!”

As he spoke, he overlooked all the people.

Ka Ka Ka!

At this time, the Devil’s Doors slowly opened with a ferocious demonic shadow coagulating into black spears.

“What kind of attack is this? How terrifying!”

The old dwarf from Heavenly Spirits was aghast as he sensed the ferocity in the air. His body trembled as he slowly went down on his knees!

Bam!

Upon seeing their leader kneeling down, the rest of the members from Heavenly Spirits followed suit.

The demonic oppression was unstoppable!

Bam, Bam, Bam!

Since the leader of Heavenly Spirits knelt down, the leader of Devil Kid went down on his knees, looking dreadful.

These fifteen daunting Budding Realm experts were not people who they could go against.

The remaining leaders of the wandering groups all fell on their knees with quivering bodies.

The demonic oppression was unstoppable!

“Hehe!”

Watching them falling on their knees, one by one, the middle-aged man revealed a faint smile. Eventually, he looked at the thirty-odd people who were standing by the side.

“There are really people who aren’t afraid of death. This is great! I can use all of your blood to nurture the merman!”
