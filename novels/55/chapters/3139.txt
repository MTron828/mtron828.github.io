Chapter 3140: 3139 nine swords came to support

The sky-reaching formation descended into darkness.

The mountain range became a huge mountain beast.

When the Dragon Palace attacked, the dragon race unleashed their strongest defense.

As a race that had been established for billions of years, their treasures were extremely powerful.

Whether it was the sky-reaching formation or the terrifying mountain beast, they all had the strength to fight against a level 2 knight.

Furthermore, within the sky-reaching array, the great beings of the dragon race could unleash even more power.

“Break the array!”

Above, when prime minister turtle saw the terrifying array rise, he immediately shouted.

“Break!”

“Break the array!”

Ao qitian, Ao Qi, and a dozen universe knights directly attacked the black screen array.

They waved their weapons and charged forward.

Rumble

The entire black screen formation was torn apart.

However, in other places, the black screen formation was still rising.

“Kill, Kill, kill everyone in the Dragon Palace, kill those who dare to invade us.”

Below, countless roars of the dragon race could be heard.

Their eyes were filled with violent killing intent.

Although the secret army of the dragon-descendant race had been destroyed by the Dragon Palace, the secret army only accounted for 30-40% of the entire race.

They still had many experts.

Especially in their base camp, Dragon Peak.

The moment the dragon-descendant race was attacked, all the core disciples immediately rushed back after receiving the news. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Tens of millions of elites attacked the 500,000 members of the Dragon Palace.

“Arrow dragon-descendant, show these guys how powerful we are!”

Prime Minister Gui’s eyes were cold when he saw the countless experts of the dragon-descendant race.

He waved his arm.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

In an instant, countless arrows covered the ground. The terrifying arrows gathered the power of wind and thunder and turned into a huge divine dragon that shot down.

Hong! Hong! Hong

A terrifying explosion sounded.

“Defend, defend immediately!”

Below, a great being of the Dragon Race roared loudly.

“Peng! Peng! Peng!”

In the sky, a powerful door of darkness appeared. The arrows landed on it and caused the door of darkness to quickly collapse.

“Brothers, Charge!”

A Universe Knight level mad dragon roared and charged downwards.

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

Starwood Dragon, Sky Thunder Earth Fire Dragon Phoenix, imperial dragon and other dragon species were the first to charge forward.

Among the 500,000 members of the Dragon Palace, none of them were weaker than a universe Knight Level 4.

Among them, there were more than 50 Pinnacle Emperors of the Dragon Palace.

“War Machine, Dragon Cannon!”

A loud roar came from below.

Crack! Crack! Crack

Then, huge black cannons appeared on the mountains below.

The head of the cannons was like the head of a divine dragon, and a terrifying energy was brewing on it.

The strength of a race was not only the strength of their disciples, but also the strength of their war machine.

The dragon cannons were specially prepared for war.

One shot could destroy a planet.

There were more than a thousand dragon cannons aimed at all the members of the Dragon Palace.

Boom! Boom! Boom

A terrifying explosion sounded.

“Dragon-controlling species, defend!”

Seeing the terrifying attack of the Dragon Cannon, Prime Minister Gui frowned slightly and ordered immediately.

“Dragon-controlling World!”

“Dragon-controlling World!”

All the dragon-controlling species roared and yellow dragon gates rose up to block the front.

Hong Hong Hong

The sound of explosions rang out, and the entire world changed color.

Defend against the enemy

A knight-level imperial dragon saw that the defense they released was quickly destroyed, and his gaze focused.

An earthy yellow dragon left a mark, leaving behind a solid defense.

However, even so, his defense slowly cracked and collapsed.

More than 1,000 dragon cannons were enough to kill a Level 1 universe knight.

This was the foundation of the Dragon Race.

“As expected of a force that has stood for billions of years. It is indeed extraordinary.”

Wang Xian looked over, his eyes shining.

After killing six universe knights of the Dragon Race and the nine swords race, the combat strength of the Dragon Palace’s knight level had reached 33.

Even if he, prime minister turtle, and Xiao Lan didn’t make a move, there were still more than 20 universe knights.

More than 20 universe knights couldn’t defeat the dragon-born race in an instant. One could imagine how deep their foundations were.

“The headquarters of every race is built extremely sturdy.”

Prime Minister Turtle echoed from the side and scanned the surroundings. “However, their destruction is only a matter of time.”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly.

What? .

“What? ! The Dragon Tribe sent a message of support. The Dragon Palace has invaded the Dragon tribe.”

At this moment, in the faraway land of the nine swords tribe.

The leader of the nine swords tribe looked at the message sent by the leader of the Dragon tribe with a face full of shock.

The Dragon Palace had actually gone to attack the Dragon tribe.

This…

“Nine blade race sword team, prepare to follow the leader to support the dragon race.”

A figure quickly spread throughout the nine blade race land.

Hearing this voice, everyone’s expression changed.

The remaining universe knight immediately flew into the palace, his expression grave.

“Leader, the Dragon Race…”

As he spoke, the clan leader of the nine-blade race nodded and looked extremely embarrassed.

“Search, search, search!”

At this time, Great Beings from the nine-blade race flew over from the front of the palace.

After the nine-blade race and the Dragon Race joined forces, they established an army and were ready for any preparations.

The Sword Group was a powerful army formed by the nine-blade race in advance. After the two secret armies were destroyed, the sword group was the strongest fighting army of the nine-blade race.

“Let’s go, we’ll head to the dragon-descendant clan immediately.”

The nine swords clan leader swept his gaze across all the disciples and shouted in a deep voice.

Now that the dragon-descendant clan was under attack, once the Dragon-descendant clan was destroyed, it would be their turn.

At this time, he had no choice but to go and support them.

The group of people moved and immediately flew towards the teleportation array.

Now that the teleportation array of the two clans had been opened, they could be directly teleported to the inner regions of the dragon-descendant clan.

“The dragon-descendant race has been invaded by the Dragon Palace. This… this…”

In the land of the nine swords race, everyone was shocked when they saw their clan leader leading a group of experts to support the dragon-descendant race.

The Dragon Palace had invaded the dragon-descendant race.

“Nine swords, come and support us!”

At the same time, the clan leader of the nine swords race led a million disciples to rush out from the inner part of the dragon-descendant race.

They swept across the battlefield and shouted in a deep voice.
