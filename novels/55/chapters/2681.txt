2682 2682 powerhouses from the Heaven’s end sect who had disappeared

A few years ago, the Empress told him that Qing Yue and Lingxiu were hunted down by the Heaven’s end sect.

Wang Xian wanted to verify why the heaven’s end sect was hunting Qing Yue and Lingxiu.

Where were Qing Yue and Lingxiu now.

“Dragon King, I advise you not to start a war between the heaven’s end sect and the Dragon Palace just because of a small matter.”

“There are two powerhouses at the peak of the Godly King Realm in the Heaven’s end sect. If you dare to kill all of us, our patriarch will definitely not let you off.”

In front of the command platform of the Dragon Palace, the elder of the Heaven’s end sect was terrified and wanted to break free from the restraints on his body. He kept shouting at Wang Xian.

“You have indeed chased after Qing Yue and the rest!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

At this moment, Wang Xian opened his eyes and stared at the elder of the Heaven’s end sect with a face full of killing intent. He growled in a low voice.

“What?”

Sensing the killing intent coming from Wang Xian and hearing his words, the elder of the world margin sect trembled and shouted in shock.

“It’s nothing. You will die too. Your World Margin sect will perish in the future too!”

Wang Xian looked at him and said without any expression.

He raised his arm slowly.

“No, no, no. Don’t kill me. Don’t kill me. I was wrong. We shouldn’t have come...”

Buzz

The elder of the world margin sect roared desperately, wanting to live.

However, the soul-absorbing power landed on him, causing his eyes to slowly lose their spirit.

Waves of information entered Wang Xian’s mind again.

“Huh?”

A few minutes later, he slowly opened his eyes and revealed a puzzled expression.

“According to the information from the elder of the world margin sect, they are indeed after Qing Yue and the rest. However, the order to kill them was given by their ancestor. Why would their ancestor want to kill Qing Yue and the rest? Is it because of Xiao Lan?”

Wang Xian frowned slightly and revealed a puzzled expression.

“But no matter what, the world margin sect...”

He mumbled and his eyes were filled with killing intent.

Wang Xian waved his arm and kept the bodies of the elders of the world margin sect.

According to the memories of the elders of the world margin sect, the world margin sect had two experts at the peak of the Immortal King Realm and possessed the ultimate treasure, the world margin ruler.

Under the control of the sect leader and the two elders, the world margin sect could unleash the power of a peak undying godly king.

It could be said that the world margin sect had three peak undying godly king warriors.

And the world margin sect had 15 level 9 godly King Warriors, not including the sect leader and the two elders, there were 12 more.

This power was very strong, far from what the great sect could compare to last month.

“With the current strength of the Dragon Palace, it will still be a little difficult to destroy the great sect. However, with the overall strength, the Dragon Palace is still stronger.”

Wang Xian mumbled as he stood on the command platform and scanned his surroundings.

Last month, the elders of the great sect and the rest were killed by Wang Xian. In the abyss, more than half of all the abyss seeds were also killed.

Two level 9 immortal King Abyss seeds were entangled by a thorny monster and would be killed soon.

As expected, after a few minutes, all the abyss seeds on this side could be killed.

While the Dragon Palace was hunting rapidly, the situation was similar elsewhere.

Especially in the central area. Other than the two peak immortal King Abyss seeds that gave them some pressure, the other abyss seeds were not enough for the powerhouses of the two great sects to kill.

In less than 10 minutes, all the abyss seeds were killed.

“Dragon King, all of them have been killed.”

In less than 10 minutes, all the abyss seeds on the Dragon Palace’s side were killed.

Seven to eight million abyss seeds. Even though Wang Xian was not very satisfied with the number, it was still not bad.

Including the bodies of the elder of the World Horizon Sect, three level 9 undying god King Corpses and 13 level 8 undying god King corpses.

This was no small feat for the improvement of the Dragon Palace.

“Return to the side and wait for the news!”

Wang Xian stood on the Dragon Peak and spoke to the sky array.

The Dragon Peak drove back to the edge of the abyss.

“Hahaha, die for me!”

“Roar Roar Roar!”

Ten minutes after Wang Xian and the rest left the Abyss, an excited roar came from the center.

Following that, the abyss seed cried out in pain.

“Has a peak king god Abyss seed been killed?”

Wang Xian looked over and mumbled.

“Hahaha, our forefather and the rest killed that peak king god Abyss seed. Our forefather is invincible!”

...

“HMPH, an abyss seed like this dares to invade our demon island. He is really courting death.”

“Haha, the ancestor destroyed The Pinnacle God King Abyss Seed, our side’s abyss seeds have all been destroyed!”

“Not enjoying it, really not enjoying it at all, the battle hasn’t even been unleashed yet and it’s already over, these abyss seeds are really useless.”

“I only got one abyss seed crystal, Sigh, what a loss!”

“The two of US only got one, and it’s one level lower than mine, that’s too little.”

At the same time, in the central region where the world margin sect was located, a group of warriors and disciples saw the patriarch and the others killing the peak undying godly monarch abyss seed, they all began to discuss.

Some cheered the patriarch and the others’strength, while others were speechless as they chatted.

Many people were very dissatisfied with their gains this time.

More Wolves, less meat.

“All expert disciples, withdraw from the Abyss and return.”

On the horizon ruler, the patriarch and sect master of the horizon great sect were smiling as they looked at the peak-stage godly monarch abyss seed crystals in front of them. They said faintly to all the disciples.

...

“It’s the Patriarch!”

“It’s the Patriarch!”

One expert disciple after another flew out. When the horizon ruler flew out, a group of disciples flew in.

“Sect master, Patriarch, this battle is really boring. We haven’t even stretched out our arms and legs yet, and the gains are even more pitiful.”

The powerful disciples also flew towards the horizon ruler. Some elders and deacons smiled as they surrounded the patriarch and the others, and said with slight displeasure.

“Hehe, there should be a few more battles in the next period of time. There’s no need to rush.”

A patriarch said in a good mood.

“There weren’t any casualties in this battle, right?”

Sect Master Tian Ya asked the elders.

“How could there be any casualties? Only some unlucky disciples were seriously injured. There shouldn’t be any deaths.”

An elder beside him said with a smile.

“Eh? Oh right, where’s the old demon? Why didn’t I see him during this battle?”

However, at this moment, an elder from the great sect of the world margin looked around in puzzlement and asked.

There were more than ten elders from the great sect of the world margin, and everyone was very familiar with each elder. One of them wasn’t around, so they were quickly discovered.

“Right, I don’t seem to have seen elder Yao. Where did he go?”

An old woman at the side also looked around in surprise.

“Sect master, Elder, it doesn’t seem to be just elder Yao. Deacon song and the others who followed elder Yao also disappeared.”

A deacon at the back looked around and said.

“Oh? Look for Old Yao.”

Sect master horizon frowned slightly and ordered.
