2571 Abyss 25

Time passed day by day. Since the ninth rank celestial sect had attacked the Dragon Star, the commercial planet of the ninth rank celestial sect had been destroyed!

A year had passed since the ninth rank celestial sect, Demon Slayer sect, Three Seas Gate, Black Forest Group, and Jianhua Group had announced their alliance!

During this year, nothing special had happened in the southern star system, and there were no more battles or killings!

Everything was calm and peaceful!

The Dragon Palace completely sank within this year, laying a solid foundation, every day, the members of the Dragon Palace rose rapidly!

Within a year, the Dragon Palace had added close to 400 undying emperor warriors, there was basically one person a day!

And with the stability of the Dragon Star and the sale of all the war pets, the rise in the Dragon Palace’s strength also slowed down!

However, one immortal king per day was still achievable!

For a year, the training grounds of the Dragon Star and Dragon Star had been full!

Just by relying on the training grounds of the Dragon Star, the Dragon Palace could obtain a large amount of resources every day!

“Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!”

A year later, the sound of tongue swallowing could be heard from the Dragon Palace!

“Alright, I’ve helped you to advance to immortal king level five. I’m a man of my word!”

On the Dragon Palace planet, Wang Xian looked at the towering snake in front of him and said to the Empress Star Lady With a smile on his face!

“HMPH, you promised to help me level up in two years. It’s been more than two years now. There’s no sincerity!”

The Empress Star Lady, who was standing in front of the towering snake, had a look of excitement in her eyes. However, she still rolled her eyes at Wang Xian!

“Hehe, I was still asking you to be the bait for me for two years. It’s all because I’m Kind!”

Wang Xian smiled and bickered with her!

In the past year, Wang Xian had become much more relaxed. He accompanied a group of girls to have fun every day. There was also the Imperial Star Lady singing for him. He didn’t want his days to be too comfortable!

“Alright, I have something to take care of. Cultivate well. Look at you. You’re only at level nine of the Eternal Celestial Master. Sigh!”

When Wang Xian saw Prime Minister Gui walking over, he teased the Emperor Star Lady and left immediately!

“HMPH, with my level nine strength of the Eternal Celestial Master, I can scare the others to death when I return to the imperial court. However...”

The Emperor Star Lady Glared at him. However, when she recalled the strength of Yin Xuan and Shu Qing, her face fell!

All of them had the combat strength of level three or four immortal king. Compared to them, she was like a younger sister!

“Dragon King, the investigation is almost done!”

Prime Minister Gui said directly when he saw Wang Xian walking over!

“Okay, let’s make a plan!”

Wang Xian nodded his head!

The Dragon Palace had been settling down for a year. If it continued to develop like this, the speed would be maintained at the current situation!

This situation was extremely heaven-defying for any other faction. However, in Wang Xian’s opinion, it was too slow!

Yes, it was too slow!

Although the Dragon Palace could add an immortal king every day, it was much more difficult for those above the immortal king level to improve further!

This would take a few months or even a month to raise the combat strength of an immortal King Level 1 to Level 2!

Such a slow improvement was naturally not what Wang Xian wanted to see!

“This is some information about the abyss. There is a lot of information about the abyss on the AI, but we need to use the search function to check!”

“Strange demon and the rest went to check it out. If we can kill a large number of abyss species, we can help the Dragon Palace improve quickly!”

Prime Minister Gui handed over a piece of information and Wang Xian took it to read!

In this bright and vast world, humans were not the rulers of this place!

The star South Galaxy was considered a relatively safe and Pure Land. However, a galaxy beside the star South Galaxy and even the Demon Island, one of the three big and small islands in the Imperial Star Field, were all under threat!

In the entire Imperial Star Lady, the greatest threat was a type of abyssal seed!

The so-called abyssal seed was a monster that lived in a crack in space!

In the starry sky of the Demon Island, the spatial fluctuations were very strong. There was another world in the crack!

The demon species were the products of that world, they were extremely brutal, they had powerful hunting instincts!

At least 10 million human life planets were under the threat of the Abyss!

Many warriors entered the space around the Demon Island, entering the abyss to hunt the Abyss species!

The demon species had a pure law core within, it was extremely beneficial to the Undying Emperor’s training!

The Dragon Palace’s target this time was these abyss seeds!

However, entering the Abyss was not 100% safe. The greatest enemy of the humans in the entire imperial star field was these abyss seeds!

In other words, there was a terrifying abyss seed like the void God Emperor in the Abyss!

“I can go over and take a look first. The sky array is guarding Dragon Star!”

Wang Xian looked at the information on it and said to Prime Minister Gui!

“Dragon King, there’s one more thing. Recently, the Heaven Formation discovered that someone is monitoring our Dragon Palace’s every move!”

Prime Minister Gui frowned slightly. “It should be the forces of the ninth-grade Heaven Sect!”

...

“Furthermore, not long ago, a group of experts from the Tiger Chaos Demon Nation took their disciples out for training and never returned. From the looks of their divine kingdom, they were killed!”

Prime Minister GUI added!

“They are prepared to fight a long battle with us. They are prepared to restrict us in this area!”

Wang Xian smiled coldly. “Ignore them. When our Dragon Palace’s strength is strong enough, it will be time for them to be destroyed!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded his head!

Currently, the combat strength of the Dragon Palace’s immortal King Level had reached 2,000. However, there were only two immortal King Level 7 combat strength!

When the Dragon Palace produced enough immortal King Level 7 combat strength, it was time for them to be destroyed!

“I’ll head to the Abyss to investigate first. You can decide some things about the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian said to Prime Minister GUI before informing the girls!

Looking at the map on the AI, he moved and immediately teleported through the teleportation formation!

With his current level seven immortal king level combat strength, he could do whatever he wanted in the star Southern Galaxy!

...

Therefore, Wang Xian did not hide anything at all!

“Dragon King, come out and leave the territories of the Dragon Palace and the Tiger Chaos Demon Country through the teleportation formation!”

When Wang Xian left, a message was sent to a planet in the ninth-grade sky sect’s territory!

“Dragon King is heading to a planet at the edge of the Demon Island. He should be heading to the Abyss!”

Very soon, information was being transmitted over one by one!

Wang Xian was not bothered by the fact that he was being followed. Without five to six level seven immortal king powerhouses, he would not be able to hold him back!

“Is the abyss ahead?”

At this moment, Wang Xian was flying in the air as he looked at the world ahead!

In front of him was an extremely deep darkness!

In the darkness, there were many continental plates floating above!

On top of this continental plate, a figure walked out!

And right beside the continental plate, there was an obvious spatial crack. The crack could not be seen to the end and the edge could not be seen!Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
