Chapter 4230: 4229 mantis stalks cicadas

Translator: 549690339

The strength of the belief universe in this calamity far exceeded that of the previous calamity.

Because of the previous calamity, they had conquered a universe.

This allowed their strength to receive a terrifying increase.

The power of faith was a very special energy.

The power of faith had become a supreme God, a saint of creation. It had nothing to do with the quota of the universe.

As long as they had enough power of faith and enough believers, they would be able to unleash the might of a heaven origin blessed powerhouse.

They did not need a quota for their breakthrough!

Everything depended on faith. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Everything depended on believers.

This could be said to be the power of numbers.

Of course, in order to become a saint through faith, the number and quality of believers was a huge number.

If they had enough believers, they would need the strength of the believers.

The stronger they were, the more power of faith they would produce.

It was obvious that the experts who believed in the universe now had their eyes on the space beast.

The Space Beast’s strength was terrifying. One believer was equivalent to ten billion!

In addition, the improvement of the space beast was relatively easy.

They only needed to kill a heaven origin creation level Space Beast and its flesh and blood would be able to greatly increase the believers they had subdued.

In addition, they could make the beast kings they had just subdued break through.

Of course, they would still consider whether they should break through or not.

This was because they were still worried that a heaven origin creation level space beast might break through their power of faith.

They could regain their self-awareness.

However, no matter what, as long as they destroyed this space beast, they would be able to obtain far too many benefits!

For this, they had already planned for more than a billion years!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

“Roar! Roar! ”

At this moment, Nine Corpse Beast Emperor, who was surrounded and attacked by a group of universe gods from the Faith Universe.

Faced with the endless attacks from the faith energy, his eyes became redder and redder.

The energy on his body also became more and more violent!

At this moment, one of his arms suddenly broke off from his body.

The corrosive arm turned into a black light and wanted to break through their defense.

“Prepare to defend. Even a drop of the Nine Corpse Beast Emperor’s blood can’t let him escape. Don’t be stingy with your trump cards. If you need to use your trump cards, we’ll share the burden! ”

A Heaven origin creation realm expert who believed in the universe shouted loudly.

The other two heaven origin creation realm experts nodded.

They naturally understood.

In order to deal with the Heaven Origin Creation Realm Space Beast, they even called their followers over.

Hundreds of thousands of followers of the gods used a beginner-level heaven origin creation realm expert to set up a powerful belief chain.

The belief chain sealed all energy.

They had prepared a lot for this hunt.

Naturally, they couldn’t let the Space Beast escape.

Even a drop of blood.

Once the space beast escaped, even a drop of blood could revive it.

Even a bit of hair could revive it!

This couldn’t be allowed!

They wanted the corpse of the Space Beast, and the spot to break through to the universe, they wanted it too.

Boom

A master-level king of all gods of faith waved his arm. The power of faith condensed into a mountain and headed straight for the unparalleled arm of the Nine Corpse Beast Emperor!

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

The Terrifying Mountain of faith pressed down on the arm of the Nine Corpse Beast Emperor. The sound of corrosion rang out continuously.

Faced with the suppression of this mountain, the arm of the Nine Corpse Beast Emperor was completely helpless. It was directly suppressed to the side and floated in the void.

From a distance, Wang Xian watched this scene quietly. His eyes flickered slightly.

“This time, the belief universe has invested a lot. With three existences at the control level and such meticulous arrangements, it shouldn’t be too much of a problem to kill the Nine Corpse Beast Emperor.”

Wang Xian thought to himself. His gaze landed on two figures.

One of them was sitting cross-legged and had just entered the Heaven’s origin realm. He believed in the king of all gods.

The other one was a master-level king of all gods.

To Wang Xian, these two were acquaintances!

And they were also the two existences who coveted the sword and the magic universe.

However, their target had shifted very quickly this time!

“With the Nine Corpse Beast Emperor’s condition, it should be able to hold on for more than ten days!”

Wang Xian looked at the position of the Nine Corpse Beast Emperor in the middle.

Although the nine-corpse Beast Emperor was severely injured, the most serious injury was only the arm that was suppressed!

“It’s hard to say who this nine-corpse beast emperor belongs to! ”

Wang Xian mumbled as he watched quietly.

As time passed, the injuries on the nine-corpse Beast Emperor became more and more serious.

The nine-corpse Beast Emperor also became more and more violent.

He wanted to escape.

Streams of terrifying energy attacked the attacks and defenses of the belief universe’s king of gods.

The corrosive flesh turned into zombie-like creatures, constantly breaking through.

But unfortunately, the belief universe’s king of gods prepared too perfectly, not giving the Nine Corpse Beast Emperor a chance.

This Nine Corpse Beast Emperor was, after all, an existence at the beginner level of knowledge.

If it wasn’t a space beast, its vitality would be extremely tenacious.

If it was an ordinary heaven origin creation realm expert, they would have killed it within five minutes!

It didn’t have the ability to resist at all.

But now, killing this space beast at the beginner level would require more than ten days!

The difference was huge!

As time passed day by day, the Nine Corpse Beast Emperor’s body became smaller and smaller.

The severe injuries and the consumption of a large amount of energy also caused his body to shrink.

Buzz

Wang Xian immediately contacted an lie and asked him to bring Tianci over.

“Hun Dun, return to the starry universe first. I will tell you the time of the death of the Nine Corpse Beast Emperor. When the time comes, seize the opportunity and make a breakthrough! ”

Wang Xian looked at the situation in front of him and instructed Hun Dun!

“Yes. ”

Hun Dun nodded and replied respectfully.

“Feilian, Gong Ya, yayu, Xu Hao and the other three have been brainwashed. If there is an opportunity this time, I will kill them. If they are resurrected in the starry universe, you can take care of them.”

“Also, if their subordinates are confirmed to have been brainwashed, you can destroy them after you make a breakthrough! ”

Wang Xian looked at Hun Dun and continued to speak!

“It’s the Dragon King. Sigh, they have already lost their sense of self. ”

A pained expression appeared in Hun Dun’s eyes.

Feilian, centipede, Yayu, and Xu Hao. Although they were not brothers, they had a deep friendship.

But now, they had changed.

They were no longer the same person as before!

Chaos was not an indecisive beast king.

He also knew that Feilian, Gong Fu, Yayu, and Xu Hao were better off dead.

A life form without self was worse than a void beast without intelligence.

Chaos Glanced angrily at the king of gods who believed in the universe, then turned and flew into the void!
