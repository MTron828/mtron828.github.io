“He asked us to leave you alone? To accept the mission from the Thunder Island?”

“The mission from the Thunder Island. Did he also accept the mission from the Thunder Island?”

When the group of girls from the amethyst mercenary group heard Wang Xian’s words, their eyes sparkled as they stared at him.

Wang Xian didn’t pay attention to the gazes of the group of girls behind him. He took back his mercenary badge and turned around to leave.

“Hehe, what a coincidence. We are going to the Thunder Island too. When the time comes, don’t let us meet you. Otherwise, although I won’t kill you, I will teach you a good lesson!”

“That’s right. You’d better pray that you won’t meet us on the Thunder Island!”

A few girls glared at Wang Xian angrily when they saw him leaving with an expressionless face.

“When the time comes, I hope all of you can still say such things!”

Wang Xian paused for a moment and looked at them mockingly.

“Before long, I will defeat you and make you apologize to my younger brother!”

Qin Qing gritted her teeth and said firmly to Wang Xian.

He smiled faintly and walked out directly.

Earlier, he used his dark fire dragon eyes to check their good and evil points. All of them were considered good people and Wang Xian couldn’t be bothered to argue with them.

“HMPH, Kid, just you wait!”

“What’s there to be proud of? It’ll be easy for us to take care of you!”

“That’s right, that’s right. If our vice leader makes a move, he’ll be able to beat you down easily!”

The group of girls from the amethyst mercenary group behind them spoke with slight disdain when they saw Wang Xian leaving immediately.

The burly girl who was standing in the middle smiled faintly and didn’t say anything.

“Looks like that freshman Wang Xian really offended the amethyst mercenary group!”

“That’s right. The amethyst mercenary group is famous for their unity. It’s just that I didn’t expect that Wang Xian would actually accept the mission from the Thunder Island. Does he have the ability to do so?”

In the hall, the students of the demon hunters academy who witnessed this scene were discussing curiously.

“That kid is leaving the city for a mission at this time. I think he’s courting death. He’s too stupid!”

In a corner, a young man suddenly whispered to his companions.

“Huh? What do you mean?”

His companions looked at him in surprise.

“Look, the amethyst mercenary group clearly wanted to teach him a lesson just now!”

“Besides the purple gold mercenary group, there’s also the young master mercenary group!”

He looked around and his gaze fell on a skinny young man. Finally, he added, “That kid has been targeted. He’s probably going to die!”

“Finished?”

The gazes of the youths froze, and they fell silent.

The Demon Hunter Academy was a very special academy.

It didn’t belong to star-moon kingdom, nor did it belong to any faction. It was only a place to nurture mercenary groups.

In fact, the founder of the Demon Hunter Academy was a mercenary group.

Other than being isolated and being taught by instructors, the Demon Hunter Academy was no different from a mercenary group in the outside world.

If you died while you were in school, the academy would not care about it.

Even if the academy knew who killed you in the wild, the academy would not avenge you.

That was because this was a place to train mercenary groups.

That was the rule of the mercenary group world.

Therefore, in the Demon Hunters Academy, it was not uncommon for people to kill each other for revenge. Some of them were even public.

For example, the hundred source mercenary group, who was ranked ninth, and the black wind mercenary group, who was ranked twelfth, were mortal enemies.

When these two mercenary groups met in the wild, they basically risked their lives and even found an opportunity to ambush each other.

In the battle between the two mercenary groups, dozens of people died. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

This was something that was made public in the academy, but the Demon Hunters Academy would not care about it.

As long as they followed the rules in the academy, it would be fine. Other than the academy, no one would ask if they were dead or alive.

Obviously, if that young man went to the Thunder Island for a mission at this time, the young master’s mercenary group would definitely not let go of this good opportunity!

...

Wang Xian came out from the mission office and walked straight to the library.

He was going to search for information about the Thunder Island to prepare for his trip to the Thunder Island in two days.

“I want to search for information!”

Wang Xian walked to the staff and asked him directly.

“What information do you want to search for?”

The staff asked him.

“Information about the Thunder Island and the thunderstorm region!”

Wang Xian replied directly.

“There are a lot of information about the thunderstorm region. If you want to search freely, you need 500,000 points!”

The staff said to Wang Xian directly.

“That much? How do you exchange points and Spirit Stones?”

“100 middle-grade spirit stones, one point!”

“That’s really expensive!”

Wang Xian took a deep breath and exchanged 10,000 points.

This method of buying points was rarely done. It was too expensive and was an unfair trade.

However, this was the rule of the Demon Hunters Academy. Without points, one could not check the information.

10,000 points. Although one could not check the information of the entire thunderstorm district, they could check the information of the vicinity of the Thunder Island.

However, just as Wang Xian was checking the information, something happened at the position of the young master’s mercenary group.

“Deputy leader, are we really going to send the information to the Academy’s Forum?”

A young man from the young master’s mercenary group frowned slightly and asked.

“Yes, that kid provoked us so much. We must let everyone know the consequences of provoking us!”

The young man holding the communication stone plate smiled faintly.

“The academy won’t ask about it anyway. I also want to see if that kid is a coward. We have plenty of time!”

A fat young man beside him said with a smile.

Everyone laughed and chatted. Ten minutes later, a post from the demon hunters academy caused a huge sensation.

“Wang Xian, let’s meet on Thunder Island!”

It was a very short line of words. The message that was posted showed Yun Hanhai!

Almost everyone in the Demon Hunters Academy knew the name Yun Hanhai. He was the deputy leader of the young master’s mercenary group.

He was the young master of the Yun family, a famous bloodline family in eastern sea city.

The Yun family was a family with a level nine extraordinary bloodline. They were members of the family and could successfully reach level nine extraordinary after activating all their bloodlines.

Yun Hanhai’s current strength had reached level six extraordinary. He was a top-notch expert in the demon Hunter College.

His words could represent the young master’s mercenary group!

This short line of words also meant that the young master’s mercenary group would make a move against Wang Xian on the Thunder Island.

This was a blatant threat and warning.

“What the F * ck, that freshman Wang Xian is going to the Thunder Island for a Mission?”

“Haha, I saw a group of goddesses from the Purple Gold mercenary group at the Mission Office wanting to teach this Wang Xian a good lesson on the Thunder Island. I didn’t expect the young master’s mercenary group to make a move as well!”

“If the young master’s mercenary group announced it directly, would Wang Xian still dare to go?”

“A new student who just arrived should keep a low profile. Now, he’s doomed. Moreover, with his strength, he can go to the Thunder Island? Can he complete the mission?”

One by one, replies appeared below. When a new student provoked the young master’s mercenary group, everyone knew that this new student was going to be unlucky.

Moreover, this time’s misfortune was very likely to be death!
