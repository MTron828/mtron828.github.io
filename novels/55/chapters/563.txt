Chapter 564: Opened Shop

The reason why Wang Xian had chosen to apply to be an alchemist was mainly because he wanted to increase his level.

With the immense energy within elixir pills, he could increase his level to Level 9.

“Freelance alchemist? Hey kid, you sure are confident of yourself!”

Master Qingming looked at Wang Xian in shock and said, “It’s really rare to see an alchemist as young as you are!”

Wang Xian smiled in response but didn’t say a word.

When Master Qingming witnessed Wang Xian’s composure, he got ready to give him an assessment.

“He is...”

“Eh? Isn’t this the Dragon King from Mt Fengyu?”

At this moment, an exclamation sounded from the side. Wang Xian was surprised too and turned his head to look to the side.

A young man was observing him inquisitively.

“He really is!”

Seeing Wang Xian looking over, the young man’s lips curved into a smile. He scrutinized Wang Xian from top to bottom, rubbed his chin and remarked, “I don’t see any deer horns or dragon whiskers. It would seem that he’s not living up to his name.”

“Haha! Xingjian, you are really hilarious. Deer horns and dragon whiskers? Should he also have a tail?” another young man joked and laughed out loud.

“Retards!”

Upon hearing their conversation, a cold light flashed in Wang Xian’s eyes as he remarked coldly.

Huh?

Huh?

The group of young men were stunned, including the one who was holding his longsword in his hand.

Retard?

He just called Xingjian and the rest retards?

At that instant, the smile on the two young men stiffened as their eyes went cold.

Wang Xian looked away and didn’t pay attention to them. People like them would have been crippled by him if they were in the Underworld.

“Hey kid! Do you have the guts to repeat yourself!?”

Xingjian pulled a long face and glowered at Wang Xian.

Wang Xian didn’t bother at all. He turned to Master Qingming and asked, “Master, can we start the assessment now?”

“Assessment? Sure!”

Master Qingming glanced at Wang Xian and nodded his head.

“Really arrogant!”

Ruthlessness gleamed in the eyes of Xingjian and the other young man. They exchanged glances and their lips curved into a smirk.

“Brother Ao, you will have to stand up for us!”

The two of them turned around and spoke with a smile to the young man holding the sword.

“You guys are my brothers!”

The young man with the Level 12 spiritual equipment spoke plainly before turning to Master Xuanhuo.

“Master Xuanhuo, these two are my brothers. Can you do me a small favor?” the young man asked Master Xuanhuo with a faint smile.

“Haha! Since Young Master Ao has spoken, this is just a small matter!”

Master Xuanhuo naturally knew what the young man was hinting at. He waved his hand nonchalantly, looked to Master Qingming and said, “Old Ming, we are not accepting this alchemist!”

“Alright! Since Young Master Ao has spoken, it’s only natural that we show him face!”

Master Qingming had no hesitation at all. He smiled, looked at Wang Xian and said plainly, “Kid, as you have seen, you have offended those who you shouldn’t have!”

Huh?

Wang Xian’s eyes squinted together and killing intent gleamed in his eyes.

“Your name is Dragon King? They have asked you to scram! Why are you still here?”

Xingjian looked at Wang Xian with ridicule. He walked towards Wang Xian before continuing, “Let me tell you this! You can forget about joining the Saint Forge Workshop in this lifetime. Moreover, I can guarantee that no alchemist workshop will accept you. If you don’t believe it, you can give it a try!”

“You are the first person who has dared to scold us. Therefore, you will have to pay a price you never would have expected!”

The other young man crossed his arms before his chest while staring at Wang Xian.

“Alright. I’ll remember this.”

Wang Xian looked at them emotionlessly. He looked plainly across the five of them, Master Qingming and the rest before heading out.

“Tsk! How ignorant!”

“When we get back, it’s time to investigate the background of this Dragon King. Interesting! He actually dares to scold us!”

“This kid probably didn’t know who we are. However, ignorance doesn’t equate to bliss in our place. If he wishes to find a job as an alchemist, I’ll make sure he won’t find one in the entire Yong Chang City!”

“Haha! Just leave this to me! I have connections with basically all the alchemists in Yong Chang City!”

The group of young men wasn’t trying to hide their conversation at all.

Fighting is restricted in Yong Chang City. If I want to kill them, I can only do so in the arena!

When Wang Xian heard their conversation while heading out, he recalled some of the rules of Yong Chang City.

“It seems like I have to raise my level to Level 9 soon!”

Dense killing intent shimmered in Wang Xian’s eyes. “Even if I can’t reach Level 9, before I leave this world, I have to...”

He had etched this incident into his mind.

Walking out from the Saint Forge Workshop, Wang Xian frowned. He looked to the surrounding weapons shops and elixir pills shops!

There were also many shops recruiting alchemists and blacksmiths.

However, Wang Xian frowned upon recalling what that alchemist master and blacksmith master had said.

Wang Xian had never expected to encounter hurdles in looking for a job as an alchemist and blacksmith. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, he felt a little annoyed.

Creak!

“Move aside. Move aside!”

Just as Wang Xian was walking forward aimlessly, he heard a shop closing up.

Wang Xian lifted his head and looked over. A middle-aged man was putting up a notice on the doors of the shop.

Shop for rent! A hundred spiritual stones for a month!

Wang Xian was taken aback and an idea struck him. He sank into deep thought and soon mumbled, “This might work too!”

“Let’s give it a try!”

Wang Xian made up his mind, looked at the middle-aged man and asked, “Hello, is your shop for rent?”

“Huh? Yeah! Didn’t you see it?”

The middle-aged man was surprised by Wang Xian and pointed to the notice on the door.

“Can I have a look at the shop?” Wang Xian replied directly.

“You are interested?” The middle-aged man scrutinized Wang Xian with doubts.

Wang Xian nodded his head and answered, “If it’s suitable, I’ll be renting it!”

“Alright, come in and take a look then!”

The middle-aged man seemed to find Wang Xian a little too young. He hesitated for a moment before nodding his head and opening up the door.

“Have a look around. This shop has three levels and each level is around twenty-five square meters. The area isn’t big but this shop is within the most central region of Yong Chang City. A hundred spiritual stones for a month is completely reasonable!”

The middle-aged man opened the door and continued his explanation. “There are some tables inside. The highest floor is a bedroom and the bed and cabinets are new!”

Wang Xian looked around and nodded his head with satisfaction.

“I’m taking this shop!”

“You really are taking it?”

“I can pay now!”

“Great. Give me a moment. Let’s go through the procedures right away!”

The middle-aged man had not expected the shop to be rented out so easily. Brimming with excitement, he said, “You have to pay three months of rent first!”

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. After selling the Inborn Spiritual Weapon he got from Kong Guanglin, he paid the rent.
