2851 2851 second Holy Feather

In the windless forest, everyone was stunned as they looked at Wang Xian and invincible battle technique.

It wasn’t just ye Lui Ying and the rest who were shocked. Even the people who came with invincible battle technique were shocked as well.

More than 20 immortal King Level 6 wind jades were nothing to invincible battle technique.

However, these wind jades were a gift from invincible battle technique to please tianxin.

Under normal circumstances, invincible in battle techniques wouldn’t give up these wind jades so easily.

!!

After all, the narcissistic invincible in battle techniques would be dominated by Tian Xin.

Now, invincible in battle techniques agreed without hesitation.

Calling him boss!

And this was the invincible in battle techniques they knew?

“This… Invincible in battle techniques, you’re just giving these wind jades to them?”

Among Tianxin’s group, a few middle-aged men saw invincible in battle techniques giving up Feng Yu with cupped fists, and they were slightly displeased.

Although they respected invincible in battle techniques’strength and background, they were also slightly jealous of invincible in battle techniques.

Especially when invincible in battle techniques wanted to pursue their cousin, this made them somewhat displeased.

“Come come come, Tianxin, let me introduce you!”

“I, invincible in battle techniques, will never be convinced by anyone in my life. Only boss Wang, my invincible boss in battle techniques!”

Invincible in battle techniques ignored the middle-aged men and said to the woman in the middle.

“Hello, brother Wang.”

Tianxin sized up Wang Xian with her gaze filled with curiosity.

He was naturally very clear about invincible in battle techniques. She was also extremely curious about someone who could make invincible in battle techniques call him boss.

“Hello!”

Wang Xian looked at the lady and looked at the invincibility of battle techniques at the side. He smiled and nodded.

“Tianxin, I’m telling you. Back then, when I joined hands with boss Wang, we swept the entire world. My godly king level battle pet was captured by boss Wang for me.”

Invincibility of battle techniques said to Tianxin in an exaggerated manner.

“AH? So Brother Wang is a Beast Tamer Grandmaster!”

“You can say that!”

Wang Xian nodded his head lightly.

“Boss Wang is being modest. The Number One Beast Tamer in the universe belongs to him. In the future universe, it will definitely be boss Wang, my second brother.”

Invincible battle technique said with a chuckle, his eyes lit up as he stared at Wang Xian. “Boss Wang, since we meet again, let’s do what we do best. I know where there are desolate beasts. When the time comes, just help me tame a level 7 or 8 immortal King Level Battle Pet!”

“I don’t have time now. I still have some matters to settle. Let’s talk about it when I have time!”

As he spoke, he patted invincible battle technique’s shoulder.

“Alright, Alright!”

Invincible battle technique nodded with a smile.

“I still have some matters to settle. When I’m done, I’ll look for you!”

Wang Xian looked towards the depths of the windless forest and realized that it was almost time. He said to him.

“Do you have anything important to take care of? Boss Wang, can I help?”

Invincible battle technique immediately asked.

“No.”

Wang Xian shook his head and looked at Ye lui Ying and the rest. “I have something to take care of. Let’s part ways here.”

“Ah, Wang Xian, you…”

“Be careful, brother Wang Xian.”

Ye Lui Ying opened her mouth to ask some questions, but her fifth senior brother interrupted her and cupped his hands at Wang Xian.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded and patted invincible’s shoulder. “See you in a few days!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

After he finished speaking, he flew straight into the depths of the windless forest.

“Boss Wang, give me your contact information!”

Invincible shouted from behind, but Wang Xian ignored him.

“Boss Wang is really a busy man. It’s not easy to meet him, but it’s been eight or nine years!”

Invincible said with a sigh.

“Invincible, is this boss Wang really so powerful?”

Tianxin asked curiously.

“Of course. He’s my invincible boss.”

Invincible nodded heavily.

“Hey, by the way, how do you know boss Wang?”

He looked at Ye Lui Ying and the others and asked curiously.

“US?”

Ye Lu Ying and the rest were stunned for a moment before revealing some things.

“In that case, isn’t that young man very strong?”

Hearing their words, a middle aged man behind Tian Xin raised his eyebrows and said.

“Brother Wang Xian is very mysterious!”

Fifth Brother looked at the middle aged man and said.

Initially, their master said that his strength was at Immortal King level six, but they had not witnessed it.

However, they knew that Wang Xian might not be that simple from the fact that he had led them to obtain so many wind jades.

Upon hearing fifth senior brother’s words, the middle-aged men curled their lips in slight disdain.

“Let’s split these wind jades in half!”

Fourth senior sister walked over and said to Invincible Heaven’s heart and the rest.

“There’s no need. I’ve already told boss Wang to give it to you. That means I’ll give it all to you.”

However, her words were immediately rejected by invincible battle tactics.

“Tianxin, let’s go. I’ll bring you to look for more Fengyu.”

…

After not seeing invincible battle tactics for eight to nine years, Wang Xian wanted to have a good reunion with him. However, he bumped into him here.

A windless day came once every 10,000 years. It was impossible for Wang Xian to miss this opportunity.

After separating from ye Lui Ying and the rest, Wang Xian immediately flew into the windless forest valley.

His speed was very fast, and he arrived in front of the windless forest valley in no time.

He looked ahead and saw that the hurricane had already entered the windless forest valley.

It wouldn’t be long before the trees in the windless forest valley reduced their attack power significantly.

“Let’s go in and investigate First!”

As Wang Xian spoke, his figure moved and entered the windless forest valley directly.

As the trees in the windless forest valley had yet to reduce their attack power, the group of celestial emperors had yet to arrive. They were waiting.

Wang Xian was the first to enter the windless forest valley.

With the help of the primaless saint wings, as long as he did not touch these trees, he would not be attacked.

After passing through the valley, Wang Xian quickly arrived at the place where he came the last time.

The Dragon Eyes of the Yin-yang and five elements scanned his surroundings. His body moved and he flew toward the depths of the windless forest valley.

At the entrance, all the wind jades had been taken away by him. There was only one holy feather.

After obtaining the Holy Feather, Wang Xian could sense more clearly that there was another holy feather inside.

This sense was exceptionally strong.

He flew rapidly towards the interior.

The area of the windless forest valley was not very big. However, it would take Wang Xian a few hours to travel through it.

After flying for a short while, Wang Xian saw many wind jades on the surrounding trees.

Among them, there were wind jades in the form of birds.

“TSK TSK, as long as the attacks from the trees here decrease, these treasures will be mine!”

Wang Xian scanned the wind jades one by one with some enthusiasm.

He did not linger and immediately flew forward.

Under his senses, there was a holy feather in front of him.

“The second one!”

Soon, a smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face as he stared at the holy feather at the root of a tree in front of him.
