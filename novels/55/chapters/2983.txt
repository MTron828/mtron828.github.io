Chapter 2984: The Vanguard Army of the 1984 two large clans

“Keke Keke!”

A sinister and terrifying voice resounded around the teleportation array.

Over 10,000 venomous horned dragons turned into black shadows and charged towards the group of people from the four-armed clan ahead. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Their huge mouths, ferocious faces, and terrifying auras caused the faces of everyone from the four-armed clan ahead to turn pale.

The suppressive might instantly suppressed the five rank four divine emperor realm experts. At this moment, a wave of panic enveloped their hearts.

“Boom!”

At the next moment, over 10,000 venomous horned dragon species flew in front of them, piercing through their bodies.

“Keke Keke!”

Some horrifying cries seemed to appear in their minds, and the four-armed race members widened their eyes.

“Scram! Scram!”

Their bodies immediately released a terrifying might as they attacked the poisonous horned dragons.

However, under the absolute suppression and the characteristic of the poisonous horned dragons as hosts, their attacks were completely useless.

The poisonous horned dragons easily entered their bodies.

The poisonous horned dragons did not host the four-armed race members. Instead, their bodies swam within their bodies.

“Ah Ah Ah Ah!”

Agonizing screams rang out as more than 10,000 experts from the four-armed race let out agonizing screams.

They rolled on the ground in excruciating pain as blood seeped out of their bodies.

The shrill cries made everyone’s scalps go numb.

The battle had ended before it had even begun!

They were existences on completely different levels.

“This… this… This is a powerhouse from the race at the center of the Universe?”

Some people around the teleportation array, including the ruler of this planet, the god Emperor, watched this scene in disbelief.

Weren’t those four-armed humans powerhouses from the universe?

Didn’t they want to destroy the Dragon Palace and tame the Divine Dragon?

How could this be?

The Dragon Palace had only sent 10,000 members, and they had annihilated all the so-called powerhouses from the race at the center of the Universe!

They didn’t even have the power to resist!

Who was the center of the Universe? The Gap was too big!

“Gulp!”

Yang Xiaohun and all the experts and disciples from the eight barrens were all stunned.

They looked at the people from the four-armed race with cold sweat and their faces turned pale.

What was going on?

The scene before them was real?

How could the Dragon Palace be so strong?

Many thoughts appeared in their minds, causing their minds to be in a mess.

Especially the disciples of the eight desolation, the eight desolation God Emperor, Emperor Lord and the rest, their heads were buzzing.

Didn’t they say that the strongest dragon emperor in the Dragon Palace was a void God Emperor Level 4?

Didn’t they say that the Dragon Palace had at most 100 god Emperors?

What was the situation now?

The Dragon Palace had casually sent 10,000 people, sending an army of 10,000 that had yet to be revealed in the resplendent starry skies. The weakest was at undying god King Level 9.

Over 30 god Emperors.

This was only a small part of the Dragon Palace’s strength!

“Weng Weng!”

A god Emperor looked at the screaming and despairing four arm race members with a terrified expression. His figure flashed slightly, wanting to escape.

Suddenly, his illusory figure gradually solidified, causing his expression to change drastically.

“Lord desolate godly monarch, our space has been sealed. We can not return to our divine kingdom!”

His voice trembled as he spoke.

When the desolate godly monarch heard his words, his pupils constricted as cold sweat slowly dripped down.

He knew that the Dragon Palace had the sky array godly monarch, a top array master in the resplendent starry sky.

“Sir, are you… are you a match for the people from the Dragon Palace?”

He asked Yang Xiaohun with a trembling voice.

“Didn’t you say that the Dragon Palace has at most a hundred God emperors and the strongest is a fourth level God Emperor?”

Yang Xiaohun came back to his senses when he heard the desolate god Emperor’s words. He gritted his teeth and shouted in a low voice.

At this moment, his face was full of panic.

“We… We didn’t expect it either.”

The desolate divine emperor said with despair.

They did not expect the current Dragon Palace to be so powerful!

It was so powerful that even the experts from the race at the center of the universe could not handle it.

“Stop fooling around. There’s still a group of people by the side. Kill them!”

The screams continued for a few minutes. Ba Qi opened his mouth and waved his arm. The five divine Emperor Level 4 experts who had been tortured by him were immediately bound and thrown to his side.

Later on, they still needed to obtain some information from these people.

They could kill the rest after leaving behind the strongest ones!

“It’s boss!”

The group of venomous horned dragons immediately responded and quickly killed the members of the four-armed race that they were dealing with.

Their gazes slowly turned towards Yang Xiao Hun and the others from the eight barrens.

“It’s your turn. Should I torture you all to death, or do you want to commit suicide?”

Mo Sha looked at them, the corners of his mouth slightly curled up as he walked towards them.

“Run!”

Yang Xiaohun sensed mo sha and the others’gazes and his face was filled with fear. He turned around and fled into the distance.

At the same time, the four wolf beasts beside him bent down and covered his escape.

“Escape? Where can you escape from my array formation?”

Sky Array looked at Yang Xiaohun who was trying to escape and sneered. He waved his arm.

“Sou Sou Sou!”

A large net appeared around him and surrounded him.

“Oh no!”

Yang Xiaohun’s expression changed drastically. He sensed the surrounding space and knew that he could not escape back to his divine kingdom in an instant.

“That old man is a rank five divine Emperor Magus!”

He cursed inwardly. His heart was filled with despair.

“Whoosh!”

The large net directly wrapped around him. He did not even have the chance to escape.

“Don’t… Don’t kill me, don’t kill me!”

Yang Xiaohun shouted in fear.

“Keke Keke, didn’t you say that you wanted to tame our members of the Dragon Palace? Do you want to destroy us?”

Mosha stared at Yang Xiaohun, his face filled with ridicule.

“Don’t kill me, or our three-eyed race will not let you go. We are just small figures of the three-eyed race. Your Dragon Palace can’t withstand the arrival of our clan leader and elders. Let Me Go, let me go!”

Yang Xiaohun roared in fear.

“Three-eyed race? Jie Jie, are you really afraid of Our Dragon Palace?”

Ba Qi said coldly, his eyes sweeping over everyone in the desolate land.

“Send them to their deaths!”

He waved his hand and ordered all the members of the poisonous horned dragon species.

“Yes, Boss!”

“You want to destroy our Dragon Palace? You Bunch of death-seeking bastards, Die!”

With Ba Qi’s order, all the poisonous horned dragon species immediately attacked everyone in the eight barrens.

“Not good!”

“It’s over, it’s over!”

The eyes of the tens of thousands of experts in the eight barrens were filled with despair. Even the experts from the four-armed race were easily killed by them.

Let alone them?

And what happened next was just as they had expected.

The Heaven Array Formation sealed off this space. Death descended, and miserable screams rang out once again!
