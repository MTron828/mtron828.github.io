2856 2,856. We, the eight desolates, must kill him! 1

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

In the windless forest, more than a dozen experts from the eight desolates surrounded Wang Xian.

The leader of the group was an elder who was hovering in the sky and locked onto Wang Xian. He was also an elder from the eight desolates, a level 9 immortal king expert.

The strength of the eight desolates used to be ranked in the top three in the entire starry sky. Now, it was ranked fourth.

Bhang’s strength was much stronger than the imperial court’s, and he was even stronger than the Shamans Association.

!!

“Elder lie, over twenty disciples have all been killed. They’re completely dead!”

A middle-aged man landed on the corpses of the disciples and said with an embarrassed expression as he sensed with his mind.

It was very difficult to kill a god King level powerhouse. If they were in danger, they could just run away.

However, they had all died here.

This made them extremely astonished.

Elder bhang lie stared at Wang Xian with a gloomy face. He then looked at the corpses around him and swept his gaze across the huge pit at the side.

“Elder, our disciple might have had a fight with him. However, this space should have been sealed by treasures or a formation.”

“He only managed to break the formation before he died.”

An elder took a glance at the surroundings and made a guess. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

At the same time, he was holding a confinement ring in his hand. If the young man wanted to escape, he would use the confinement ring to do so.

“It was you who killed our disciples of the eight desolates!”

Elder lie stared at Wang Xian with a face full of killing intent.

The corpse below, the injuries on Wang Xian’s body, and the huge pit at the side made them think that they had experienced a battle and that their disciples of the eight desolates had been killed.

Wang Xian looked at the elders from the eight barrens and revealed a faint smile.

“He’s just someone who wants to die!”

He said with contempt.

Boom

As soon as he finished speaking, waves of terrifying killing intent were transmitted over.

“Hahaha, good, good, good. He dares to kill our people from the eight barrens. I want to see who is the one who wants to die!”

“What happened? Is there a wind jade?”

“It should be. Otherwise, why would the people from the desolate wildlands use signal flares to call for help!”

At this moment, voices came from not far away, and figures flew over quickly.

Such an eye-catching signal for help could be seen clearly by everyone within a radius of a billion kilometers.

There was only one reason to use the signal flare in the windless forest, and that was to fight for Feng Yu.

All the people who entered the windless forest came for Feng Yu. Seeing this signal flare, some experts naturally came over to take a look.

To see if they could get a share!

“Eh!”

Seven or eight people flew over, and their eyes flashed with a luster.

“Someone’s dead!”

“The disciples of the eight barrens have been killed!”

Their eyes swept across the area in front of them, and their pupils contracted as they whispered.

“This is the business of the eight barrens. Everyone, get lost!”

Seeing that someone was flying over, elder lie shouted with an ice-cold expression.

The death of the eight barrens’disciples was a major event.

When the seven to eight people who flew over heard elder eight barrens’ice-cold shout, they didn’t dare to provoke him. They retreated a little and watched in surprise.

Buzz

Elder lie saw them retreating. He waved his arm and a confinement ring appeared in his hand.

“Kid, I want to know what kind of background you have to dare to kill my disciples!”

He stared at Wang Xian coldly and asked.

To kill their disciples, not only did they want to destroy this young man in front of them, but they also wanted to make the faction behind him pay a heavy price.

How could it be so easy to kill the disciples of a faction at the peak of the starry sky?

As long as they dared to kill them, not only would they have to pay the price with their lives, even the faction behind them would have to pay the price as well.

The reason why he didn’t attack Wang Xian right away was because he wanted to know the faction behind him.

“Oh? Hehe!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and revealed a sneer in his eyes.

“You’re courting death. Even if you don’t tell us, we can dig it out from the barren lands!”

Elder lie let out a low growl with a ghastly expression. The imprisonment ring in his hand was locked onto Wang Xian.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

“Elder lie, what happened? !”

The imprisonment ring was attacking Wang Xian. Wang Xian stood there without moving. He watched quietly as the imprisonment ring locked onto him.

At this moment, another person flew over. It was just an expert from the eight barrens.

“Elder Zhou, someone killed our disciple!”

Elder lie swept his gaze over and said.

A group of more than ten people was led by an elder from the eight barrens.

The windless forest was a treasured land. During the windless days, the eight barrens would naturally send people over. Moreover, they would send quite a number of people.

They were only a part of it.

“What! Someone Dares to kill our eight desolates’Disciples!”

When the burly elder who flew over heard elder Lie’s words, a murderous look appeared on his face. He swept his gaze across the surroundings with a ghastly expression.

His gaze finally landed on Wang Xian.

“Killing our eight desolates’disciples is too easy for him. capture him and let him enjoy the pain of the suppression of the eight desolates Mountain!”

Elder Zhou roared with rage.

“That’s right, he dared to kill our disciples, let them know the consequences!”

The surrounding warriors all shouted coldly.

“That youth is going to be unlucky, I don’t know why he wants to kill the disciples of the eight desolate mountain!”

“However that youth doesn’t look like a warrior, among the dead were undying level 7 warriors.”

“Look at the injuries on his body, he must have fought with the disciples for a long time, maybe he has a trump card!”

The 7 to 8 people around looked ahead and discussed.

“Little Junior Sister, why are we here to join in the fun!”

“Aiya, come take a look, it’s hard to get wind jade anyway, let’s see what’s happening here!”

Just as the seven or eight people were discussing, a voice came from behind.

The seven or eight people who came first took a glance and ignored it.

“Eh?”

“Eh? That’s Wang Xian. It’s him. What’s going on?”

The group of people who came were ye Lui Ying and the rest. They had been looking for the wind jade here for the past two days.

Unfortunately, ever since Wang Xian left and more and more people came here, they didn’t have much to gain.

Ye Lui Ying, who loved to join in the fun, wanted to come over. However, she didn’t expect that the figure in front would be Wang Xian.

The fourth senior sister, who was the strongest, recognized him at a glance. Her gaze swept across the surroundings and their expressions changed slightly.

“Let’s go over!”

The fourth senior sister hesitated for a moment. Her expression changed and she immediately said.

“Huh?”

Seeing the young man whom the four of them knew as the enemy of bhang, the seven to eight people who were watching the fun looked over in astonishment.

At the front, when the two elders heard the voice, they narrowed their eyes slightly.

Those who dared to kill their disciples had to pay a price, not only for the young man in front, but also for the faction he belonged to.

Now, his companion had come!

The eyes of the experts from the eight barrens revealed a ghastly expression.
