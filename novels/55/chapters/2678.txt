2679 2679? Let’s go

“Dragon King, it’s time to set off!”

The next day, the Great Teacher of last month came over to inform them.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian looked at the Dragon Peak and said with a smile.

Boom! Boom

The Dragon Peak was activated and soon, they arrived at the land plate that the great teacher of last month had taught them.

The land plate with a radius of tens of millions of kilometers was densely packed with people.

These were the powerhouses from the northern front.

“I hope I can get a good harvest this time.”

Wang Xian mumbled as a smile appeared on his face.

This time, there were 60,000 disciples of the Dragon Palace in Dragon Peak. Out of the 60,000 people, all of them were immortal king powerhouses.

The 35,000 members of the Heavenly Eye Arrow Division all possessed the combat strength of Immortal King powerhouses.

The other 12,000 immortal king level demonic beasts and 10,000 immortal king level Starwood Dragon species.

The rest were the fire hammer warriors.

Such strength was definitely comparable to the two sects.

“That Dragon Mountain is the strength of the Dragon Palace? The entire Dragon Mountain is so powerful!”

“It is very powerful, that Dragon Mountain is a war machine of the Dragon Palace, extremely powerful, I heard it can trap 3 undying level 9 beings.”

“No matter how strong it is, it can be stronger than our sky edge ruler, one inch sky edge God destroyer demon.”

“Of course, it can’t be compared to the world’s end ruler, but this dragon peak is also very powerful!”

As the Dragon Peak advanced forward, there were also quite a few factions at the side.

The disciples and experts of each faction were standing on large aircraft.

There was an entire planet advancing forward, and there was a void ocean crossing the void.

There were also technological warships that were thousands of kilometers in size.

The most eye-catching one was a powerful treasure that looked like a ruler. The ruler was not very long, only about 10,000 meters long. However, there were tens of millions of people standing on the ruler. Those people looked very small, like ants.

The world’s end ruler had the space of a short distance. The entire ruler was also an incomparably powerful treasure.

It was a sect-guarding treasure that belonged to the world’s end great sect.

The experts and disciples from the various factions scanned their surroundings and began to discuss among themselves.

They were especially curious about the Dragon Palace, which had become famous in the northern front recently.

“Dragon King, the journey will take five days. Five Days is just enough to completely build the Dragon Peak!”

Tian Chen stood on the command platform and said with a smile.

“That’s even better.”

Wang Xian smiled at the side and swept his gaze across the surrounding factions.

As the powerhouses from the two major factions, Jiu Xiao and Duan Tian, were located in the eastern abyss, the surrounding factions were all the central factions of the Demon Island.

The strongest faction was naturally the horizon sect.

There were five other factions of the same level as the Beichuan sect, as well as over a hundred weaker factions.

There were about a few hundred million people who went this time, and there were also many war machines. Therefore, the various factions did not choose to go through the teleportation formation.

“That horizon ruler is very strong.”

Wang Xian looked over and said faintly.

“It’s a pretty good weapon. With an expert controlling it, it can match the combat strength of a peak immortal king.”

The sky array nodded.

In the next few days, the various factions rushed towards the abyss in the east of the Demon Island.

As two-fifths of the Demon Island had been devoured by the abyss, especially the eastern and northern regions, Wang Xian and the rest arrived at the front of the Abyss five days later.

Similar to the northern front, there was a bustling area at the front of the battle line. There were at least tens of thousands of life planets around it. This was an area that was even more prosperous than the northern front.

However, similar to the northern front, everyone was in a hurry with a murderous aura.

“Everyone is here. Let’s discuss about the attack!”

In the sky, dozens of figures appeared and spoke to Wang Xian and the rest of the forces.

“Haha, good. Let’s slaughter these beasts!”

In the large-scale war machines, the experts from the forces flew out one by one.

“Let’s go over too!”

Wang Xian spoke to the heaven formation. He flew out from the Dragon Peak and headed towards the abyss.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

Many top-notch experts were floating in the air as they looked ahead.

From here, one could see a part of the abyss.

...

“Two Peak Immortal King Level Abyss Seeds.”

Wang Xian looked towards the center and saw two powerful abyss seeds being guarded by his subordinates.

“We will deal with the central area with Jiu Xiao. You guys can divide the rest among yourselves.”

At the side, the Patriarch of the world margin sect said without a doubt.

“Leave the right side of the central area to us. We don’t need any reinforcements!”

The sect master of the heaven-severing sect looked at the sect masters of last month and said directly.

“Then leave the right side to last month and the rest of the forces.”

Patriarch of the world margin looked at the sect master of last month, Wang Xian, and the rest and said faintly.

The encirclement this time around was not too difficult for the forces of the Demon Island.

It could be said that the abyssal seeds in the Abyss ahead were a huge amount of resources.

There was no danger and they could obtain countless abyssal crystals. Naturally, the forces would fight for it.

...

This was especially so for the great sect. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The abyssal crystals were a very powerful cultivation treasure.

“Last month, we were close to the center with the Dragon Palace on the left side. The rest of you will be allocated.”

Last month, the sect leader frowned slightly. However, this was the only choice he could make.

Tian Ya and Jiu Xiao were stronger than them. Since the heaven-cleaving sect was the host of this place, they could only choose the remaining ones.

“The harvest this time might be less than satisfactory.”

Wang Xian mumbled.

“Alright, we will be done with the distribution in ten minutes. All the disciples of the sects will gather in front of the Abyss in ten minutes. We will attack together. Don’t let these beasts escape.”

Patriarch Jiu Xiao said coldly.

“Yes!”

The leaders of the sects responded and started to prepare immediately.

“Bring the Dragon Peak Here!”

Wang Xian said to the Heaven Array.

The Heaven Array nodded. With a move, he returned to the Dragon Peak quickly. Soon, the huge dragon peak arrived in front of the abyss.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Soon, the surrounding factions gathered.

A group of powerhouses and disciples from the great sect from last month also flew over. There were more than 10 million people. They were the elites of the great sect from last month.

“Dragon King, we are clearing the abyss seeds in this area. There are two immortal King Level 9 existences. Old Feng’s strength has not fully recovered yet. These two will be handed over to the Dragon Palace. We will clear the ones 100 million kilometers away.”

The sect leader and the Patriarch flew over last month and said to Wang Xian.

“HM? Then thank you for letting US pass!”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned and said to them.

“Haha, compared to the help from the Dragon Palace, this is a small matter.”

The sect leader and the rest smiled and didn’t care about it at all.

A Level 9 abyss seed crystal was extremely precious to them. There was even a powerful immortal king level 8 powerhouse who made a breakthrough because of a level 9 abyss seed crystal.

The three undying level 9 seeds that came last month were enough to kill one.
