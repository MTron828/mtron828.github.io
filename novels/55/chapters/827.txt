Chapter 828: 0829 was not from his race

Wang Xian hated being used by others.

Cooperation was cooperation. There was no need to get involved in other things. If both parties were sincere, he would help the other party even if the other party did not ask for his help.

However, the cooperation was not completely confirmed yet. To ask for his help was asking for too much.

Furthermore, because of the puppet immortal sect, Wang Xian was extremely unhappy with the western divine realm!

“Hehe!”

Upon hearing Wang Xian’s words, the immortals from the four great immortal sects heaved a sigh of relief. They looked at Wang Xian gratefully before turning to the five elders from the nine snakes association. A cold smile appeared on their faces.

“Garden of Eden, this is a matter of the east. It’s best for the western divine realm not to interfere!”

The elder from the Berserk Beast Immortal sect stared coldly at the Okra Angel as he spoke.

“What do you mean by meddling in your affairs? The Nine Snakes Association is an ally of the Garden of Eden. If you want to destroy them, we will naturally take action!”

Okra said with an embarrassed expression.

“Huaxia Immortal Sect, don’t think that we nine snakes will be afraid of you. A superior immortal. Our Invincible Lord is also a superior immortal. We are not afraid of You!”

Seeing that Wang Xian was ignoring the Garden of Eden, the frail elder growled in a low voice with an embarrassed expression.

“Hehe, let us give it a try. Today, we are only here to warn you. Choose to live or choose to die. This time, the four immortal sects are here. Next time, it might not be just the four immortal sects!”

The elder from the Wild Beast Immortal sect stared at them without any fear. His gaze swept across the gods in the Garden of Eden. “It is best for Your Garden of Eden not to interfere. The four immortal sects are not afraid of your divine realm!”

“Not afraid? Then are we afraid of You?”

The okra angel lightly patted the table and looked at the thin and frail elder. “Tell Your Excellency, with all the powers of the Nine Snakes Association and our Garden of Eden, are you afraid of the four immortal sects?”

“The okra angel, even if we don’t include you, we are not afraid of them at all. HMPH, Our Excellency will not submit to any power. Our Excellency is the strongest existence in the world!”

The thin and frail old man’s eyes were filled with a fiery glow as he shouted coldly.

“Is your lord an octahedron?”

When Wang Xian heard their words, he could not help but ask with a smile.

“That’s right. The omnipotent octahedron god, the god with endless lifespan and wisdom, the strongest existence in the world!”

The thin and frail old man looked at Wang Xian and swept his gaze across Wang Xian with pride.

“The eight-limbed God of a superior immortal is indeed very strong.”

Wang Xian said faintly.

“HMPH, of course!”

The thin and frail elder snorted coldly and said with pride.

“Dragon King, since you know that the nine snakes association is very strong, you might as well form an alliance with us. The cooperation between US can continue.”

The okra Angel looked at Wang Xian and said with a solemn face.

“No, I don’t trust you guys now. That’s why I won’t cooperate with you guys!”

Wang Xian shook his head and said with a smile on his face.

The faces of the gods in the Garden of Eden changed, a cold expression appeared on his face. “Since we won’t cooperate, Our Garden of Eden doesn’t care about it at all. Do you really think that we want to cooperate with the Dragon Palace? If you guys didn’t come looking for us back then, we wouldn’t have cooperated with you guys. Now...”. Hehe, Dragon King, you are really interesting!”

Wang Xian smiled, he stood up slowly and said, “If we can cooperate, we will cooperate. If we can’t cooperate, we won’t cooperate. Don’t think too highly of yourselves. This is a matter of mutual benefit. Moreover, I don’t believe in the credibility of your divine realm!”

“Hehe, Dragon King, don’t make so many excuses if you don’t want to cooperate!”

Upon hearing Wang Xian’s last sentence, an icy look appeared in the eyes of the Okra Angel as she spoke coldly.

“That’s right. Do you really think that the Garden of Eden is begging to cooperate with you? Do you really think that you are someone? In the eyes of the Divine Realm, you, Dragon King, are nothing more than this!”

The god of flowers, who was beside him, spoke coldly.

“HMM?”

Upon hearing her words, a hint of coldness appeared in Wang Xian’s eyes as he stared coldly at the god of flowers.

“What’s wrong, Dragon King? Don’t tell me you still want to make a move!”

The Flower God stared at Wang Xian fearlessly.

The gods in the Garden of Eden stared at him fearlessly. “Your Dragon Palace’s strength is only similar to our garden of Eden. If we add in our allies, the ancient Greek divine realm and the nine snakes association, we wouldn’t be afraid of Your Dragon Palace at all!”

“Are you guys on good terms with the ancient Greek divine realm?”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled when he heard their words.

“Alright, we don’t have any time to chat with you guys today. Today, the divine realm of the Garden of Eden will tell you Chinese gods that the nine snakes association is our ally. If you guys dare to make a move, consider the consequences!”

The angel of Okra stood up and swept his gaze across Wang Xian and the people from the four great immortal sects. His tone was filled with a strong warning.

“The puppet immortal sect is my friend!”

Just as OCRA’s Angel finished her sentence, Wang Xian suddenly said something out of the blue.

“Why? Could it be that the Dragon King still wants to avenge the people from the puppet immortal sect?”

OCRA stared at Wang Xian and said with a cold smile.

“Although we are not close friends, we have a good relationship. We will investigate it thoroughly. If it was intentional killing, we will consider avenging them!”

Wang Xian said faintly.

“Then, Dragon King, you might not have the ability to do so!”

OCRA’s Angel said with a cold smile.

“There is something fishy about the killing of two immortals from the puppet immortal sect. The grand elder of the Xuan Yuan clan is even planning to investigate this matter!”

The elder from the Wild Beast Immortal sect said from the side.

“So what if they are dead? So what if they are found out?”

Okra said coldly.

“That’s right. He’s already dead. So what if he’s found out?”

Wang Xian sighed slightly. “Let’s collect some interest first!”

“Clang! Clang!”

As he finished speaking, Ao Jian and another immortal god from the Golden Swordfish clan beside him drew their longswords. Their bodies were instantly filled with killing intent.

“Huh?”

All the immortal sects in the hall were slightly stunned. Their faces were filled with astonishment.

The immortal gods in the Garden of Eden were also filled with astonishment. They stared at Ao Jian and the other two people beside Wang Xian in disbelief.

Even the ten immortal gods and the core disciples of the Wild Beast Immortal sect were filled with astonishment. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“The two immortal gods from the puppet immortal sect can be considered my friends!”

Wang Xian walked slowly to the center of the hall. “They were killed by the gods of the Ancient Greek divine realm. Regardless of the reason, just kill them!”

“However, I’m still a little unhappy. This makes my thoughts a little illogical!”

“You guys have a better relationship with the ancient Greek divine realm. Coincidentally, the puppet immortal sect and the Ancient Greek divine realm were killed because of business cooperation.”

“We didn’t have a good agreement because of business cooperation and business matters. In that case, I’ll kill all of you to make me feel better!”
