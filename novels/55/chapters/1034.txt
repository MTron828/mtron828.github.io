Chapter 1035: 1036 dead silence in Donghai City (3/10)

Translator: 5496903

A gust of cold wind blew through the dark sky.

Everyone around couldn’t help but wrap their clothes around themselves.

“Gulp!”

At this moment, the only two city guards standing there had cold sweat on their foreheads. They widened their eyes and looked at the eight colleagues who had fallen beside them. They felt numb all over!

“How did they die?”

“Who saw it? Who Saw It? Why did blood suddenly appear on their necks and then fall to the ground in an instant!”

“Could it be a transcendent level 9 powerhouse? But there wasn’t even a shadow. Even a transcendent level 9 powerhouse wouldn’t be so fast!”

The shocked voices of the passersby rang out in the surroundings.

The sound of swallowing saliva was also very clear.

Everyone widened their eyes and looked at the surroundings. Eight corpses fell to the ground again.

“How can this be? Ghosts? Ghosts?”

The two who were standing crouched down with their bodies trembling. One of them took out his communication stone plate in panic.

They felt as if they had brushed past the grim reaper.

“En, over there!”

However, at this moment, Lei Feihu and city Lord Lei, who were standing ten thousand meters high in the sky and overlooking the entire area, suddenly had a change in expression as they looked down.

He was flying towards them at a terrifying speed.

“Boom!”

When the figure of a void interpretation expert appeared here, even if it was just overflowing with a trace of aura, everyone around felt that it was like a huge mountain peak flying over.

When the people in the surroundings saw this figure, their breathing stopped.

It was the city Lord!

City Lord Lei!

“City Lord Lei... we...”

When the two city guards who were still alive saw the city Lord arrive, their bodies could not help but directly kneel on the ground, their faces filled with terror.

Lei Feihu did not speak. He walked over and looked at the city guards who had already lost their vitality, tightly clenching his fists.

He looked down at the entire area and used all his strength to sense everything below. He actually did not discover how they died!

One had to know that he was a peak insightful emptiness realm expert!

“Crackle crackle!”

Lei Feihu’s expression was solemn. In the sky, a terrifying lightning suddenly lit up.

The Lightning reached the top of Lei Feihu’s head and disappeared.

“Ah!”

When everyone saw this scene, they could not help but retreat. Some of the timid girls let out a cry of surprise.

“Get up and bring the corpses back!”

Lei Feihu’s face was as gloomy as the sky as he roared in a low voice.

“Yes, it’s the city Lord!”

The two city guards hurriedly stood up and brought the eight corpses away, walking towards the city Lord’s mansion.

Lei Feihu did not say a word, and directly flew towards the city Lord’s mansion.

This time, he did not discover anything, which also meant that he had failed to supervise the city!

The dragon Spike could kill people right under his nose.

Or, he could discover the assassin of the dragon Spike at close range.

But the Eastern Sea city was so big? How could the dragon spike be so stupid as to kill people beside him?

This made him extremely furious, but at the same time, he also felt a little powerless.

However, not long after, at the western and northern regions, another 12 city guards were killed.

The level 9 transcendent of the city surveillance brought the corpses back to the city Lord’s mansion with fear in his eyes.

They were completely defeated. Both they and the city Lord were completely defeated.

This dragon Spike assassin organization was too powerful!

The 20 corpses were placed in the city Lord’s mansion, and the entire hall was deathly silent.

Lei Feihu sat there with a solemn expression and did not say a word.

The other six did not even dare to say a word!

“It’s too terrifying. The Dragon Assassin organization is simply too terrifying. They killed twenty city guards without making a sound. Moreover, it was under the gaze of tens of thousands of people. Even a rank 6 transcendent expert could not see that someone had taken action!”

“After the Dragon Assassin assassinated twenty city guards, City Lord Lei and the city Lord’s Mansion’s managers directly flew over from the sky. What does this mean?”? “This means that city lord lei personally monitored the entire eastern sea city today, but still did not find the killer!”

“This dragon spike is too terrifying. My God, even City Lord Lei himself did not manage to capture the killer. Then in the future, in Eastern Sea City, who else can not be assassinated by the dragon Spike?”

“I didn’t expect, I really didn’t expect that the confrontation between the city Lord’s Mansion and the dragon Spike would actually result in the city Lord’s mansion being completely defeated. You did not see at that time that a bolt of heavenly lightning descended from the sky. You can imagine how furious City Lord Lei was!”

The atmosphere in eastern sea city was a bit strange. If it was a ball of fire in the early morning, it was already a bit dead silent now!

This kind of atmosphere was like watching a ghost movie and listening to a ghost story.

The scene today was indeed like watching a horror movie for many people.

A group of city guards were assassinated under the gaze of thousands of people. There was no trace of the assassin. It was as if the ghost was the devil making a move.

Some people even guessed that the Dragon Assassin Group was established by the Ghost?

Was it established by the Devil?

Otherwise, how could it be so strange. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

But soon, some busybodies discovered that the three city guards who were assassinated, those who did not die, had better reputations.

The city guards with Kinder Hearts.

And those who died were those who had done bad things and had bad reputations.

This made everyone think of the rules of the Dragon Assassin organization.

Don’t kill good people!

“Be it ghosts or devils, at least this dragon assassin organization has its own bottom line and rules. It’s much better than many assassin organizations!”

Some people let out a sigh of relief.

Dark clouds were pressing down on the city. At this moment, everyone’s mood was similar to today’s weather.

The dragon assassin organization suddenly pressed down on many people until they couldn’t breathe.

“The dragon assassin organization actually sent out a message that they’re accepting a mission from now on!”

Suddenly, a deep-water bomb was thrown over, igniting the strange atmosphere in eastern sea city once again.

“The dragon assassin organization actually started accepting missions? Don’t tell me they’re not afraid of being besieged by the city Lord’s Mansion?”

“Two consecutive days of threats and warnings. This time, the dragon spike is testing the city Lord’s Mansion’s attitude. I can guarantee that with the dragon Spike’s personality, if the city Lord’s mansion dares to deal with their spies today, even more people might die tomorrow!”

“Even the Thunder City Lord can’t do anything about it. Are we going to continue to go against the dragon Spike?”

Everyone spoke one after another, and the entire eastern sea city became lively once again.

There were tens of thousands of messages in the forum every second, and all of them were discussing.

However, at this moment, when the tens of thousands of city guards of Eastern Sea city saw this message, their expressions instantly became unsightly.

With City Lord Lei’s personality, he wouldn’t give up so easily after being slapped in the face.

And once city Lord Lei didn’t give up, the dragon Spike would assassinate them.

They did not dare to guarantee that they were truly a good person, and the dragon Spike would not kill them!

Seeing this news, the city guards were a little silent, and started to whisper among themselves.

They did not want to die, and they did not want to be killed without anyone knowing.

Facing the dragon spike, the city guards had completely lost their fighting spirit!
