Chapter 1439: 1439 war 2

The blood barbarian demon beasts had always been bloodthirsty and were mortal enemies with the humans.

Now that the blood barbarian demon beasts had ascended to the throne, this was definitely not good news for the humans.

Even if the blood barbarian demon beasts wanted to stop the war with the humans, they still couldn’t believe it.

After all, the blood barbarian demon beasts were such a cruel race. Their words couldn’t be trusted.

“Did the blood barbaric demon beasts know that we humans are trying to stop them from establishing the Demon Beast Empire, so they decided to stop the war?”

An emperor frowned and asked.

“Yes, but not all of them are related. Ever since we opened up the trade with the Demon Beast Race, the Demon Beast Race knows the benefits of interacting with humans!”

“Moreover, the third trading company, the life and Death Pill Workshop, and the holy item forging workshop are the witnesses to this truce. They don’t dare to violate the agreement!”

Elder Qian shook his head and said to them.

“Oh? The Life and Death Pill Workshop? The holy item forging workshop?”

The emperors looked at the other two elders.

“Hehe, emperors, if the Demon Beast clan establishes an imperial dynasty and has good relations with humans, we can do business with the Demon Beast Clan. We naturally look forward to your peace!”

The two elders said indifferently.

“If the Demonic Beast clan establishes an empire, it might not be long before their strength completely surpasses ours!”

One of the Lords glanced at the blood emperor and said in deep thought.

“There’s a very high possibility that once the Empire is established, the Demonic Beast Empire will be much stronger than us!”

The blood emperor also frowned. “Originally, I wouldn’t have agreed, but the appearance of the dragon-phoenix Empire, the Heavenly Sword sect, and the two rank six experts of the profound void realm...”

As he spoke, he looked at the few emperors. “If we continue to make enemies with the Demon Beast clan, our blood flow dynasty will suffer great losses!”

“But if we make peace with them, then we will still be the rulers of the flowing sea region. Our blood flow dynasty controls the humans in the flowing sea region, and the Demon Beast dynasty controls the demon beasts in the flowing sea region!”

As the blood emperor spoke, a cold expression slowly appeared in his eyes.

“Little Jun, what do you mean?”

The few emperors raised their brows slightly, their eyes flickering.

“What I mean is, anyone who dares to offend our blood flow empire will die, even if the other party has a level 6 profound void martial artist!”

As the blood emperor spoke, his face revealed an icy cold smile.

The few emperors slowly stood up and looked at each other.

“As long as the Demon Beast Empire doesn’t interfere with our human affairs, then we won’t stop them from establishing the Empire!”

The few emperors nodded.

The establishment of the Demon Beast Empire would definitely have a great impact on the human race in the future.

Take the Blood Savage Demon Beast as an example. After they became the emperor of the Demon Beasts, there was a high possibility that they would secretly devour human blood in the future.

However, this didn’t matter. As long as it didn’t affect the overall situation of the blood flow empire, it was fine.

Secondly, there was the guarantee from the world’s third trading company, the life and Death Pill Workshop, and the holy item forging workshop that they didn’t have to worry about the Demon Beast Empire suddenly breaking the treaty.

“Then right now, our first priority is...”

When Crown Prince Tang Xuewen heard his father and the other emperors’decision, his eyes revealed an excited expression.

He had vaguely guessed what would happen next.

“Anyone who dares to challenge our blood flow empire will die!”

The Blood Emperor stood there with a cold smile on his face.

“Haha, Good, good. Then the dragon-phoenix Empire will ask everyone from the blood flow empire to help solve it!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The two elders from the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop laughed loudly and said.

“Don’t worry. Even if you don’t say it, we’ll destroy them this time!”

The Blood Emperor’s face revealed a cold expression.

“Since that’s the case, let’s make a move immediately. These past few days, all the dynasties and sects in the Liuhai region really thought that we were afraid of them!”

“Even the citizens of our Imperial City thought that we had to lower our heads to them. Hehe!”

One of the emperors said with a face full of killing intent.

“Haha, it’s been a long time since any faction dared to provoke our blood flow empire. This time, we’ll let all the factions in the flowing sea region see the consequences of offending us!”

“It’s been a long time since we’ve made a move. Today is a good time to move!”

The other emperor laughed loudly. With a wave of his hand, a large saber appeared in his hand.

Four level six insightful void martial artists against two level six insightful void martial artists. They were confident that they could keep their opponents here.

They were also confident that the upcoming battle would not affect the imperial city.

As the emperor of the blood flow empire, they had this confidence.

“Gather all the insightful void martial artists in our blood flow imperial city, and gather all the forces of the subordinate dynasties!”

The Blood Emperor immediately gave the order.

“It’s father!”

Crown Prince Tang Xuewen replied loudly with excitement.

A ferocious expression appeared on his face.

He had never thought that he would be able to see that the kid’s body had been damaged in the blood flow imperial city so quickly.

The night in the blood flow imperial city was even livelier than during the day.

Especially around the imperial palace, in the center, there was not much space between the entire street and the day.

The night pearls were inlaid on both sides of the door, looking exceptionally beautiful.

“Eh? The Blood Emperor’s order!”

“The Blood Emperor has arrived. He wants all of us to go to the Palace!”

“What’s going on? Is it because of the dragon-phoenix dynasty and the Heaven’s sword sect?”

“Is it because they want to make a new plan?”

When the subordinate forces received the Blood Emperor’s order from the blood flow dynasty, they were all astonished.

However, they were not the dragon-phoenix Empire’s Sky Sword sect. They did not dare to resist the blood flow empire’s order at all.

The subordinate forces immediately rushed toward the imperial palace.

When they arrived at the Imperial Palace, all the subordinate forces had shocked expressions on their faces as they stood in front of a hall.

The burly blood emperor wore blood-red armor that covered his entire body. He was riding a dragon horse at the fourth level of the profound void tier.

The dragon horse was covered in scales of Sword Shadows. Its tail was five to six meters long.

It had a huge mouth full of densely packed sharp teeth.

And behind the blood emperor, there were two more... No, no, they were emperors who were also wearing blood-red clothes.

They were also riding on dragon horses of various kinds, their faces filled with killing intent.

They were all dressed in military uniforms and riding dragon horses!

What was going on?

Especially behind the blood emperor and the emperor, the crown prince and over 100 insightful void tier experts of the blood flow empire were all standing behind them, fully armed.

This formation caused the people from the subordinate forces to be filled with shock.

“Everyone follow behind and listen to the orders. Kill those who seek death!”

The Blood Emperor looked at the 156 insightful void martial artists from the 20-plus forces and ordered coldly.

“Yes, it’s the Blood Emperor!”

Everyone was slightly shocked and quickly stood on both sides.

“Let’s Go!”

The Blood Emperor stood in the center and shouted coldly.

“Roar!”

The dragon horse roared and dashed out of the Dragon Palace.

The experts of the affiliated forces were all shocked.

They were going to destroy the dragon-phoenix dynasty, the Heavenly Sword sect, the Light Dragon Dynasty, and the Blood Stream sect!
