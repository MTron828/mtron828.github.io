Chapter 1510: 1510. If I become a demon, there will be no demons in the world

The millions of living beings have all been annihilated!

Ancient Demon City, the ancient demon city with a fierce reputation in the vast region.

An ancient demon city that even first-rate forces did not dare to casually provoke,

at this moment, it had completely turned into ruins.

The entire city, more than a million people, had all died. Apart from the seven demon lords, not a single one survived.

This was more than a million people, especially since they were all extremely vicious and powerful.

More than a million people, along with a towering city, had completely sunk into the abyss when the sun set.

“My God, this... This is too terrifying, too terrifying!”

“Seven insightful void Tier 7 experts were unable to stop him. What terrifying strength, what crazy actions!”

“This is simply an existence that can destroy the world!”

In the distance, everyone from the He clan looked at this scene with faces full of shock. Everyone could not help but swallow a mouthful of saliva.

Even the white-haired elder at the eighth rank of the profound void martial stage looked at the ancient demon city that had completely turned into ruins. He looked at the millions of people that had been killed and his brows jumped.

It was too brutal!

It was simply too brutal!

It was rare for one person to kill a city and over a million people.

Especially under the siege of a rank 7 insightful void realm expert.

“Kill! Kill him! I want to cut him into pieces and skin him alive!”

On the ruins of the ancient Devil City, the seven devil masters were trembling when they saw this scene.

The ancient demon city had turned into ruins. All their subordinates had been killed!

However, they didn’t stop them. They could only watch helplessly.

They never expected that the combined attacks of the seven of them and the fourteen dharma idols couldn’t stop him.

“Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The seven of them let out a beast-like roar and attacked Wang Xian directly.

At this moment, Wang Xian, who was lying on the ruins of the ancient demon city, was covered in wounds. A few of them were even fatal.

The Sun had completely set and the darkness had completely descended.

Wang Xian looked at the seven demon lords who were attacking him and felt the extremely serious injuries on his body.

His consciousness had finally recovered a little.

Looking at the scene that he had done around him, a hint of bitterness appeared on his face. He was really too crazy.

“I’m afraid that my body is going to be damaged here!”

He looked at his broken body and sighed helplessly.

“The night has just fallen and the eternity has just begun. How Can You Die? Kill, Kill, Kill!”

At this moment, a violent sound came from the location of his heart.

Dong Dong Dong

Along with this sound, Wang Xian’s chest suddenly started to throb violently. At the location of his heart, waves of extremely dense dark energy spread throughout his body.

His injuries were healing at an insane rate. His strength was rapidly filling up his entire body.

“If darkness doesn’t come out, how can there be light?”

At this moment, another voice was heard from the location of his heart.

The voice was extremely calm, making one feel as though they were bathing in the spring breeze. It was an extreme contrast to the violent and brutal scene just now.

Wang Xian was stunned. He looked at the location of his heart. The heart of Light and darkness had replaced the heart that was crushed by him.

However, at this moment, the heart of light and darkness was completely engulfed by darkness.

“If darkness doesn’t come out, how can there be light?”

“Then today, I will transform into darkness and see the light after I break through!”

A terrifying light shot out from Wang Xian’s eyes. At this moment, his eyes were extremely dark and deep while the light was as bright as the sun.

He had some understanding of this heart of light and darkness.

He transformed into darkness! He stood up after breaking through and saw the light!

“Go to hell!”

At this moment, terrifying attacks came at him one after another.

Seven attacks that covered a radius of seven to eight kilometers directly submerged his body. Waves of terrifying energy charged at him.

“Is he dead?”

The Seven Devil Masters looked at the terrifying energy fluctuation caused by the explosion at the center. The ground had sunk into a huge pit that was at least tens of meters deep. There was no sound at all.

“Brother Wang Xian wouldn’t...”

In the distance, he Yuan’s face was slightly red as he stared at the center of the explosion. Slowly, he became embarrassed.

Everyone from the He clan looked on in silence.

“The injuries on his body are too severe. He should have been killed!”

The white-haired old man said slowly and shook his head slightly.

“Roar!”

However, just as he finished his sentence, a terrifying roar was heard from the ruins of the ancient Devil City.

It stunned him slightly.

“Roar! Roar!”

Two more violent and brutal roars were heard. A terrifying black demonic dragon charged into the sky once again.

“All of You Must Die!”

Wang Xian’s emotionless voice rang out. His violent body attacked the seven demon lords in the sky with a ferocious look.

“What?”

The seven demon masters who were floating in the sky felt Wang Xian’s even more terrifying aura. The injuries on their bodies had already recovered, and their faces were filled with shock.

“Chop off his head!”

The expression of the old man with the two-headed demon master changed as he shouted loudly.

“Chop him into eight pieces! I want to see how he will recover!”

The other old man who was holding a long blood-red saber emitted a murderous aura as he slashed at Wang Xian.

“Roar!”

Facing three powerhouses at level seven of the Seethrough realm, Wang Xian was not afraid at all. His entire body was shrouded in darkness.

His consciousness became blurry again, and his desire to kill grew stronger.

“Boom!”

He raised his arm, and it turned into a radius of three kilometers. He went straight for the Devil Master who was holding the blood-red long saber.

The Gigantic Dragon Claw was attacking a human. It was like a human crushing an ant.

“Break!”

When the blood-colored long saber demon master saw the gigantic Dragon Claw, he was not afraid at all. Instead, a thousand-meter-long blade mark collided with it.

Crack! Crack! Crack

However, the blade mark collapsed instantly, causing the expression of the demon master to change drastically.

Earlier on, Wang Xian had been avoiding their attacks. The group of Demon Masters did not feel the terror. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

When the three-thousand-meter-long Dragon Claw fell, the terrifying devil aura on it easily destroyed his knife marks.

It was like a devil claw that descended from the sky, clawing straight at him.

“Destroy it!”

The other seven Devil Masters saw the blood-colored long knife devil master being attacked. The skulls, staffs, scythes, and blood swords in their hands attacked Wang Xian one after another.

“Heavenly Devil Dragon Gate!”

Sensing the attacks around him, the dragon scales on Wang Xian’s body trembled slightly. Four incomparably huge dragon gates appeared around him.

On each Dragon Gate, there was a devil dragon rolling around, blocking the attacks one after another.

His dragon claws continued to attack the blood-colored long saber devil master in front of him.

The terrifying power of darkness and the Indestructible Dragon Claws made the devil master reveal a horrified expression.

“Not good, what terrifying power!”

His expression changed drastically, wanting to dodge the incomparably huge dragon claws. However, the dragon claws were too big.

“Ah!”

When the Dragon Claws landed on his body, the terrifying power and darkness corrosion caused his eyes to widen, filled with despair.

In front of such tyrannical and terrifying darkness energy, he felt that he deserved to be called the demon lord.

The other side is!
