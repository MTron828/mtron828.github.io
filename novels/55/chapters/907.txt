Chapter 908: 0909, someone was courting death

Translator: 549690339

At the edge of the Black Sea, it was usually an extraordinary level one or level two jellyfish.

The more central it was, the stronger the jellyfish was.

There was not even a single sea bird in the sky above the entire sea area. It seemed a little desolate.

“There are ten bronze-level missions and seven silver-level missions!”

Wang Xian looked at the entire Black Sea and revealed a smile.

Ten bronze-level missions, five four-star bronze-level missions, and five five-star bronze-level missions. If they could complete them, the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group would be able to attain five-star bronze-level missions.

In addition to the seven silver-level missions, they would be able to attain two-star silver-level and three-star silver-level missions after completing all of them.

Such an improvement speed was absolutely terrifying.

“Let’s go in!”

Wang Xian ignored the group of people who had been following behind them and entered the Black Sea directly.

“Captain, they entered the Black Sea as well. What a coincidence!”

At this moment, when they saw Wang Xian and the rest entering the Black Sea, they paused in the air and said with smiles on their faces.

“That’s right. What a coincidence. Manager Qian got us some detoxifying pills from the life and Death Elixir Workshop today. It’s perfect. Let’s complete a few missions and then play with them!”

The middle-aged man said with a smile on his face. He moved his body and dived into the sea. “Let’s Go!”

“The poison in the sea has yet to reach the supernatural realm. One will die immediately if they enter the sea!”

Wang Xian entered the sea and felt the poison inside. He thought to himself.

However, as a divine dragon, the poison posed no threat to him.

It didn’t even pose any threat to the golden swordfish and the rest.

In the water, their combat ability would be even stronger.

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he looked around.

“This is? The Devil’s nest at the bottom of the sea?”

Wang Xian looked down. The entire area was more than 20,000 meters deep. There seemed to be many mountain ranges below.

Many of the mountain ranges at the bottom of the sea had huge holes that looked like the Devil’s nest at the bottom of the sea.

“The Devil’s nest at the bottom of the sea is the nest of the jellyfish. Some of the devil’s nests are connected together!”

“The celestial star grass and the heaven waves grass live in these nests. The celestial star grass grows above the nest while the heaven waves grass lives inside!”

Wang Xian recalled the information about the Black Sea and looked at the nests below.

The jellyfish lived in these nests that were like demon caves. If they wanted to gain something, they had to enter the demon caves.

Or they could lure the jellyfish out.

The mercenary group determined the strength of the jellyfish based on the size of the Devil’s lair.

Wang Xian moved his body and flew straight down. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

When he arrived at this mountain range that was in the middle of the ocean, Wang Xian scanned the surrounding Devil’s lair.

“Let’s Go!”

Without any hesitation, he flew straight to the nearest Devil’s lair.

When he arrived in front of the demon cave, the entrance of the cave was two meters wide. According to the records, it should be a level two extraordinary jellyfish.

Wang Xian swept his gaze over and his eyes sparkled.

“No!”

Not every demon cave had jellyfish. Some of the jellyfish might have been killed and there were no jellyfish living in the nest.

With a move, Wang Xian arrived in front of another mountain peak. He looked at the one-meter-wide demon cave.

His gaze swept across the demon cave. Ten meters away from the demon cave, a jellyfish with six claws and a gigantic head was lying inside.

It was almost one meter in size and looked like an armor. Its entire head was covered with densely packed teeth.

“Boom!”

Wang Xian’s body shook and a wave of divine dragon’s pressure covered him directly.

“Ji Ji!”

A terrifying sound came from inside. Wang Xian’s heart skipped a beat and the jellyfish immediately appeared in front of him.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian smiled. The control of the dragon’s pressure was a complete suppression to the water tribe members who were weaker than him.

When his strength reached a certain level, the dragons in this world would be able to be controlled directly.

“You guys go around and hunt the jellyfish. Be careful!”

Wang Xian looked around and said to the members of the Dragon Palace.

In the area of the Black Sea, the most powerful jellyfish was only at transcendent level five. The members of the Dragon Palace could easily deal with it.

“One!”

Wang Xian controlled the jellyfish and immediately flew towards the other demon lair.

His speed was very fast. With a sweep of his gaze, he could see if there were any jellyfish inside.

Most of the jellyfish at the edge were at the first or second level of the supernatural realm.

He unleashed his dragon’s might and directly controlled them.

Soon, dozens of jellyfish gathered behind Wang Xian.

In the surroundings, Golden Swordfish and strange demons were also killing the jellyfish one by one.

With their strength, they were not much slower than Wang Xian.

“HMM? Why are there no signs of the jellyfish in the caves? The detoxification pills have been cut off recently, so there shouldn’t be so few jellyfish. Could it be that there are experts here?”

“Also, why did the young man and the rest who entered the water earlier disappear as well?”

At this moment, the Mirage Sea mercenary group, who was at the back, looked around and asked with an embarrassed expression.

“They must have realized that there are no jellyfish beasts in the surrounding caves, so they went to the front. Let’s Speed Up!”

The middle-aged captain pondered and said. He immediately quickened his pace.

Boom

At this moment, Wang Xian waved his arm a thousand meters in front of them. A ball of seawater surrounded an extraordinary level three jellyfish.

The terrifying water energy entered its body directly. Wang Xian moved his body and turned into a divine dragon to devour it.

Ding! “Devouring the jellyfish. Extracting 9 Dragon Crystals!”

The system’s voice rang out. Wang Xian shook his head slowly.

Upgrading required 10,000 dragon crystals. A level 3 transcendent could only provide 9 dragon crystals. He needed to devour more than 1,000 level 3 aquatic creatures before he could reach level 4 transcendent.

After Wang Xian devoured the jellyfish, he immediately entered the nest of the jellyfish.

When a jellyfish reached extraordinary level three, the things secreted from its body would be able to grow the heaven star grass and Heaven Billow grass.

Wang Xian entered the nest but did not discover anything. He immediately came out.

“Continue!”

His body moved and continued to advance forward. The surrounding members of the Dragon Palace were also advancing forward rapidly.

One by one, the jellyfish were killed quickly. Some of the members of the Dragon Palace found some heaven star grass and heaven billow grass inside.

Boom

Wang Xian waved his arm and a huge dragon claw condensed in the sea water. He killed an extraordinary level three jellyfish.

He had a thought and kept it into his interspatial ring. He entered the ring and saw a heaven billow grass in the depths of the ring. He smiled.

“The Black Sea area with a radius of 70 to 80 kilometers can be easily defeated!”

Wang Xian revealed a confident expression.

“Haha, you’re Quite Fast, huh? HMM? It seems like you’ve made some gains?”

At this moment, a voice came from the side. Wang Xian quickly looked over.

“You’re really courting death!”
