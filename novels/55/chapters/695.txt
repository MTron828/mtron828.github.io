Chapter 696: 0697 order: overturn the heavens and Earth 5(second watch!)

Translator: 549690339

The six immortals immediately flew around, two of them guarding the weakest part of the array to prevent them from escaping.

The Snow Demon Blood Arrow, the devilish youth, and the bewitching woman all flew in one direction.

Below them, more than a million people from the six islands began to search.

“More than a thousand of Netherkill’s members were killed in one night. It’s too terrifying. That’s more than a thousand of the most powerful people in our Ding Yu world. Every one of them is an expert with rich combat experience. Every one of them has killed more than a thousand enemies!”

“Now that Ding Yu is about to appear in the world, more than a thousand of the most powerful people in our world have been killed. After the world appears, our Ding Yu world is probably going to decline!”

“That’s right. I heard that the immortals from the real world came to our world to take revenge. Immortals, please let us look for the immortals. If they hide, we won’t be able to find them. If we find them, it will be our death!”

Everyone from the Jade Hand Immortal sect and corpse Chief Dao felt a chill in their hearts. If they were asked to look for the murderer of the experts from Yu Ding world, even if they found him, the consequences would be obvious.

However, if they didn’t look for him, the immortal gods in the immortal sect wouldn’t let them off either.

Over a million people began to search the six islands.

At the same time, the Snow Demon, Blood Arrow, the demonic youth, and the bewitching woman were also looking at the islands in the sky, using their powerful energy to sense them.

The torrential rain was still falling, making their search a little more difficult.

The four people’s expressions were extremely ugly, but it was impossible for them not to continue their search.

The murderer was still in their world. If they were allowed to assassinate him, it might not be long before the two immortal sect disciples were all killed.

An immortal God level expert would lower his status to kill a core stage disciple. It was simply a wave of his hand that annihilated a large number of them.

“The snow demon and blood arrow are really troublemakers. They’ve ruined the future of the entire immortal sect. If we still can’t catch those two immortal gods, the losses would be too great!”

The devilish youth swept his gaze downwards with a gloomy expression. With a flick of his finger, three puppets appeared in front of him.

Two old men and a young girl. Their faces were incomparably pale. Their bodies were covered in white fur, and their eyes were blood red.

“Search for them. As long as there’s someone’s scent, report immediately!”

The devilish youth ordered the three puppets.

“It’s Master!”

They spoke emotionlessly. They sniffed slightly and entered the ocean.

In the other direction, the black strange birds that blotted out the sky and covered the earth emitted quacking sounds. Under the control of the devilish woman, they entered the ocean directly.

“They’re here!”

At the same time, at the bottom of the ocean, a devilish person sent a message. A hint of a smile flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes.

“An immortal God is here. Get Ready!”

Wang Xian held a jade plate in his hand. This was an array formation.

Concealment Array Formation: Level 1

A Level 1 array formation. Back in the Yongchang world, when the experts from the spirit tools and Elixir Shops came to assassinate him, they used the concealment array formation to cover the entire sky.

In the space of the concealment array formation, the sound of the battle would be completely concealed.

However, this concealment formation was a grade-1 formation after all. Furthermore, it was not a trapping formation or a killing formation. Immortals could easily get out of the formation.

However, this was sufficient.

Wang Xian placed the jade plate of the concealment formation in the hands of the four infant stage strange demons. He instructed them to activate it in the surroundings at any time.

The torrential rain fell on the surface of the sea with a series of sounds.

The three puppets were in the middle of the sea, searching the bottom of the sea.

The devilish young man in the sky was staring downwards with a hint of vigilance in his eyes.

The other party had two immortals. Although they could not kill him in an instant, they might be severely injured by a sneak attack.

Being vigilant, he would not put himself in any danger.

“The first one is really vigilant!”

The figure of a devilish young man appeared in Wang Xian’s line of sight. He narrowed his eyes slightly.

After calculating the direction of the devilish young man’s movement, Wang Xian immediately gestured to the surrounding devilish demons.

The four nascent soul stage devilish demons brought along the concealment formation and slowly swam up to the surface of the sea.

Their speed was very slow and they occupied four positions.

With the four devilish demons’movement, even Wang Xian could not see or sense their existence.

In the sky, the demonic young man slowly looked at the flying figures in front of him. His gaze was also scanning the surroundings.

“Now!”

When the three puppets were only two thousand meters away from Wang Xian and the rest, Wang Xian had a thought. At the same time, he gave an order to Ao Jian, AO qitian, and the four strange demons.

Boom

In an instant, they burst out with a terrifying speed and attacked the demonic young man in the sky.

“Huh?”

The devilish young man instantly looked in the direction of Wang Xian and the rest. His expression changed slightly.

“We’ve discovered them. Come quickly!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

He let out a wild roar. This sound would definitely be able to spread throughout the entire Yu Ding world.

Buzz

However, at this instant, he felt that his voice was blocked by an energy!

“Formation!”

The devilish young man’s expression changed slightly.

“Die!”

At this moment, Wang Xian let out a cold shout from below. Five spiritual swords stabbed towards the demonic young man.

Whoosh! Whoosh

At this moment, Ao Jian’s Longsword and Ao Qitian’s ocean-pacifying divine needle also attacked the demonic young man directly.

“Three Immortals!”

The demonic young man’s expression changed slightly. With a wave of his arm, a puppet clad in grade-13 metal appeared in front of him. The puppet met Wang Xian and the other two directly.

“Eat my stick!”

Ao qitian shouted excitedly. The ocean-pacifying divine needle in his hand suddenly became ten meters long and half a meter thick.

Boom

A terrifying force landed on the puppet, causing it to fall down instantly.

The devilish young man’s expression did not change. Two blood-red daggers were thrown directly at Wang Xian and Ao Jian.

The daggers collided with Wang Xian and Ao Jian’s spiritual swords.

“You actually ambushed me? Do you think I’m so easy to ambush? HMPH, three immortals dared to barge into the Ding of Yu world and assassinate our underlings. We will bury you here forever!”

The devilish young man waved his arm. Instantly, the entire concealment formation was filled with demonic aura.

“Just you wait!”

The devilish young man let out a sinister voice and fled outside at a terrifying speed.

“Puchi!”

Just as he turned to flee, a terrifying snow-white arm suddenly appeared.

A sharp claw directly pierced through the devilish youth’s chest.

With a pull of the long arm, a large chunk of flesh was instantly grabbed out.

“What... No No... There’s actually... There’s actually...”

In an instant, the devilish youth revealed a terrified expression.

Beside him, a terrifying immortal killer appeared out of thin air.

Just now, he actually didn’t discover the other party’s existence.

This made him feel somewhat incredulous. He was an immortal God level expert, and his specialty was assassination.

An assassination King was assassinated!

“Just now, their attack was a feint. The real assassination was here!”

The bewitching youth’s eyes were filled with despair.

Yu Ding World, the first immortal God had fallen! 1
