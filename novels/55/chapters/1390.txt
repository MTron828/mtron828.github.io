Chapter 1391: 1391 proposed

“Congratulations to the young master of the dragon-phoenix Empire for bidding 75 billion for the elixirs of the third level of the Void Interpretation Stage!”

“Congratulations to the young master of the dragon-phoenix Empire for purchasing 100 elixirs of the half-step void interpretation stage with 130 billion!”

“Congratulations to the young master of the dragon-phoenix Empire for purchasing two fourth level void interpretation stage spirit trees with 250 billion!”

“Congratulations to the dragon-phoenix Empire...”

The auction continued. As long as there were elixirs and spiritual herbs that could enhance the dragon energy, Wang Xian would buy all of them.

“This... The young man from the dragon-phoenix Empire has bought at least two trillion middle-grade spirit stones over the past Half Day!”

“What a big deal, what a big deal. All the elixirs and spiritual herbs have been auctioned off by him. This dragon-phoenix Empire is simply too rich!”

“Elixirs and spiritual herbs that are worth trillions of middle-grade spiritual stones are really tempting!”

The day’s auction was about to end. Five to six hundred items were auctioned off in a day. However, Wang Xian alone had bought over 20,000,000,000,000 middle-grade spiritual stones.

Some of the forces looked at Wang Xian with envy. There was an indescribable look in their eyes.

With so many elixirs and spiritual herbs, many people were willing to take the risk.

A few trillion. The entire imperial treasury of their dynasty only had so many items!

Wang Xian saw the hidden greed in the eyes of the people around him. A faint smile appeared on his face.

“Today’s auction ends here. Thank you to all the friends who have come to support us. Our next large-scale auction will be in five years!”

At seven or eight o’clock in the evening, the king’s auction ended.

“Young master, this is the item you sent for auction. After deducting the spiritual stones you spent and the service fees, the rest of the spiritual stones are all here!”

A staff member walked over and handed the item to Wang Xian. He said with a smile on his face.

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly and checked the spiritual stones inside.

“That’s great. Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian said to Ao Jian, Duan Jinming, and the rest. Then, he walked out with a smile on his face.

His harvest today was not bad!

“I didn’t expect this guy to have so many spiritual stones. Help me check what he has done in the two days since he came to Xiaoyao City!”

At the back, an old man stood beside the cold-faced young castellan. He stared at Wang Xian’s figure with a twinkle in his eyes and said softly.

“It’s the young castellan. I will send all the information to you soon!”

The old man nodded respectfully.

Under the watchful eyes of some people, Wang Xian and the rest rode the carriage towards the weapons area.

Along the way, he swallowed all the elixirs and gained about 500 million dragon crystals.

“Duan Jinming, I will raise your strength by another level!”

Halfway through, Wang Xian raised Duan Jinming’s strength by another level.

Now that Duan Jinming had the strength of a second-level void interpretation, he could definitely fight against a third-level void interpretation.

Even though he wasn’t a dragon that was good at fighting, it was still easy for him to fight against a dragon that was a level higher.

This made Duan Jinming very excited.

When he returned to his residence, it was already dark. Wang Xian returned to his room and continued to rest.

The next day, he didn’t go out. The members of the Fire Hammer clan were dealing with weapons one by one.

At the same time, they used the spirit stones they earned to purchase some metals to forge weapons and continue to sell them.

With the fire hammer clan’s smithing ability, it was a complete windfall.

In these two consecutive days, the fire hammer clan made a name for themselves in the weapons district.

On the first day, a mercenary group was causing trouble at the entrance of the fire hammer shop, and Duan Jinming happened to see them.

He used his powerful presence to suppress the troublemakers.

The strength that Duan Jinming displayed at the insightful void tier shocked everyone.

The sudden appearance of a insightful void tier powerhouse from a lowly demonic beast clan shocked many people.

A faction with a profound void stage expert and a faction without a profound void stage expert were two completely different concepts.

Even if the fire hammer clan only had one profound void stage expert, Duan Jinming, it could still be considered a pretty good demonic beast race.

Those who dared to look down on the fire hammer clan would have to consider it carefully!

The formidable strength displayed by Duan Jinming caused the fire hammer shop to become popular.

One after another, they received a few big orders. It could be said that they had made quite a name for themselves in the entire weapons district.

“Dragon King, Ao Qitian and the rest will arrive at Xiaoyao city in a few hours!”

On the fourth day, ao Yao appeared beside Wang Xian and spoke to him. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Are they here?”

Wang Xian nodded his head slowly. “Let’s go to the location of the shop!”

As he spoke, he walked straight to the location of the fire hammer shop.

It was time to leave after settling the matter with Duan Jinming and the rest.

“I really didn’t expect the Fire Hammer Demonic Beast clan to be able to reach such a level in just a few days!”

“The business of the various big shops in the weapons district isn’t better than theirs, right?”

“I heard that the Fire Hammer Demonic Beast Clan has a powerful force supporting them!”

When Wang Xian arrived at the fire hammer shop, he heard exclamations coming from the surroundings.

This kind of voice was completely different from the first day when the shop opened.

In front of the shop, a few members of the Fire Hammer clan received customers one after another happily.

“Dragon King!”

Duan Jinming and the Fire Hammer clan leader, who were in the shop, walked over with smiles on their faces.

“Close the shop and get ready. I will bring Jin Ming to propose a marriage. After that, we will leave this place!”

Wang Xian said to Duan Jinming with a smile on his face.

“Propose a marriage?”

Duan Jinming was slightly taken aback. Soon after, an excited expression appeared on his face. “Dragon King, shall we... Shall we go now?”

“Duan Yan Lie, have you prepared everything that I asked you to prepare yesterday?”

Wang Xian smiled and looked at the chief of the Fire Hammer tribe.

“Dragon King, everything has been prepared. It is placed at the back of the shop. Are We Going Now?”

The chief of the Fire Hammer tribe was slightly taken aback as well. He said with a smile on his face.

“Yes. I will bring all of you out of Xiaoyao city in the next two days. Settle the matter regarding Jin Ming first. We must do it in a glorious manner!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“Thank you, Dragon King. Thank you, Dragon King. I will tell my clansmen to prepare now!”

“This time, our fire hammer clan will be leaving soon. Before we leave, we must do it in a glorious manner!”

The Fire Hammer clan leader said excitedly as he walked to the side.

“Dragon King, I will go and prepare as well!”

Duan Jinming also walked to the side excitedly.

“Hey, what’s going on? Why are the fire hammer clan’s shops closed?”

“Yes, what’s going on?”

“Well? Why did they bring these festive carriages?”

In less than ten minutes, some people around them said in surprise. They looked at the weapons shop of the Fire Hammer clan, which had closed in the morning, and frowned slightly.

“Members of the Fire Hammer clan, what are you going to do? Why is the shop closed?”

A customer frowned and asked a member of the Fire Hammer clan.

“It’s closed. Today, the future chief of the Fire Hammer clan will go to the gilded gold clan to propose marriage!”

The member of the Fire Hammer clan said with a smile.

“What? Propose marriage? Go to the Gilded Gold clan to propose marriage?”

Everyone around was slightly stunned!
