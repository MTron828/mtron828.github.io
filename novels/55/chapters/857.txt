Translator: 549690339

“Dragon King, come and fight with me. I will take your head within 100 moves!”

The Godly King moved and flew down from his throne. He stood in the air and faced all the powerhouses of the Dragon Palace with a cold gaze.

The light from his body filled a radius of more than 10 kilometers. He shouted at Wang Xian with an invincible aura.

When they saw the godly king’s aura, everyone’s expression changed slightly. This aura had the qualifications to suppress the gods.

“Fight! Even if we don’t have as many people as you, the gods of the divine territory have nothing to fear! Haha!”

“Kill! With the godly king around, so what if their number doubles? Haha, Fight!”

When they saw the godly king being so domineering and facing the immortals of the Dragon Palace with his aura alone, the surrounding gods and the immortals of the Yuwen clan had their fighting spirit ignited as they roared loudly.

“Fight, fight, Fight!”

“Kill, Kill, Kill!”

Behind them, the experts who had not reached the immortal God realm roared loudly with killing intent

The godly monarch had ignited the flames of war for everyone single-handedly!

In terms of aura, he far surpassed the members of the Dragon Palace.

“He’s too domineering! The godly monarch is indeed the godly monarch!”

“With such spirit, there’s a high possibility of him defeating the strong even if he’s weaker!”

“No wonder the western God realm is willing to bow down to us!”

Through the live broadcast, many martial artists were shocked by the mighty and domineering aura of the Godly King. The Flames of war between the god realm and the Yuwen clan had been ignited. They could even unleash 150 points of combat strength.

“Haha, Fight With Me?”

Wang Xian looked at the opponent in front of him who was surging with spirit and excitement. He laughed out loud and his face was filled with sarcasm. “You are not qualified yet!”

You are not qualified yet!

Wang Xian’s cold voice reverberated within a radius of dozens of kilometers.

“TSK TSK, TSK TSK. A little piece of trash wants to challenge our Dragon King. You are really not qualified!”

Just as Wang Xian finished his words, Ba Qi moved and came to the front of the center. He had nine heads and stared at the godly king with an evil look. “You dare to call yourself the Godly King and Challenge Our Dragon King? Hehe?”

His sarcastic voice resounded throughout the world. As Ba Qi stood in the center, a viscous demonic aura was emitted from his body.

With a slight movement of his palm, a skeleton staff appeared. It was filled with evil demonic aura and charged directly at the light energy in front of him.

“There are a total of 148 celestials and disciples of the Dragon Palace. Send out 148 of them to train the troops. Begin!”

Prime Minister Gui stood beside the Immortal Dragon Throne and said to everyone in the Dragon Palace in a soft voice.

There was no domineering declaration, nor was there an invincible aura. His calm voice stunned everyone around him.

The Dragon Palace only sent 148 immortals to fight one-on-one!

The Godly King was not qualified to challenge the Dragon King. The Dragon King did not make a move!

Training, begin!

This... The Dragon King simply did not put the Nordic divine realm and the Yuwen clan in his eyes.

The godly monarch challenged the Dragon King. In the end, one of his underlings came up to fight the godly monarch. Furthermore, judging from his aura, he was completely capable of contending with the godly monarch.

What the F * ck, what the F * ck!

The appearance of the octahedron and Prime Minister Gui’s words instantly made the faces of the Nordic divine realm and the Yuwen clan extremely ugly.

“Kill!”

But at this moment, Prime Minister Gui’s words rang out once again.

In an instant, Ba Qi moved. His nine mouths opened, and black snake-like tongues attacked the godly monarch.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Behind him, a group of demon monkeys roared. A few immortal God level demon monkeys held the sea-pacifying divine needles and smashed forward.

The thunder shrimp clan of the Thunder tribe, Ao crab, and a group of killer crabs!

More than a hundred golden swordfish clan members charged forward in an instant.

“Hiss, retreat, quickly retreat!”

The great battle broke out in an instant, causing the immortal gods hiding in the surroundings to hurriedly retreat.

They did not stop until they were dozens of kilometers away.

Three hundred immortal gods were fighting, and two immortal kings were fighting.

“The Dragon King really did not make a move. There are still a group of Immortals and gods beside the Dragon King who did not make a move. It seems that the Dragon King does not put the Nordic divine realm and the Yuwen clan in his eyes at all!”

Everyone around looked at the explosion of the battle in shock.

The Godly King’s aura was overwhelming, but in the Dragon King’s eyes, everything was a joke. Even the Dragon King did not make a move!

This kind of confidence was not what the godly monarch was talking about.

“Boom!”

In the sky, the nine tongues were like giant snakes. In an instant, they became 1,000 meters long and landed on the light shield in front of the godly monarch.

“You bastard! You’re courting death!”

The godly monarch Oakden’s face was filled with anger and rage. “The radiance of the gods!”

He raised his divine staff, and 10,000 rays of white light in the sky shot toward the octahedron. The white light was filled with the power of judgment.

“Jie Jie, the radiance of the gods? Old Man, what is a God? Gods are only powerful cultivators. They can only deceive all living beings and judge me. You are not qualified enough!”

Ba Qi laughed maniacally and retracted his tongue. The head in the middle grew longer and in an instant, it became more than 100 meters long. “You are only an existence at the first level of transcendence. You Want to judge me?”

“Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!”

He opened his mouth and the poisonous substances in the sky welcomed the 10,000 white rays of light. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Bzzz! bzzz!”

The sounds of corrosion in the sky, the battle between light and darkness, the godly monarch vs Ba Qi.

“Beast, today I represent the light and will send you to hell!”

The godly monarch’s expression changed slightly when he heard Ba Qi’s words. He waved his arm and the eyes of the two huge crows on the throne emitted a dazzling white light. Their bodies grew dozens of meters in size and they bit towards Ba Qi’s body.

“I hate that you’re so high and mighty, so I’m going to kill you!”

A cold expression flashed in Ba Qi’s eyes. He was a creature that would always seek revenge for his flaws. He would make anyone who dared to insult him miserable.

The so-called godly monarch was only so-so!

“Boom Boom Boom!”

“Caw Caw!”

In an instant, Ba Qi returned to his full form. His nine heads, nine tails, and 150-meter-long body floated in the air.

A terrifying demonic qi shot into the sky.

The two crows were instantly swallowed by the two heads.

“Nine inferno hell!”

His nine huge mouths opened and a terrifying demonic flame shot towards God King Okudin!

“Holy Light Protection!”

God King Okudin’s expression changed slightly. His eyes revealed a serious expression and a trace of panic flashed across his eyes.

He did not expect that one of the Dragon King’s subordinates actually had a strength that was on par with his.

Then how strong would this Dragon King be?

Thinking of this, he glanced at the Dragon King who was sitting on the dragon throne and looking at him with a smile on his face. A trace of fear flashed across his eyes.

The Dragon King had not made a move yet. If he did?

“You dare to be distracted while fighting with me?”

Ba Qi Jiu’s eyes were filled with coldness and viciousness. A huge tail swept out.

“Not good!”

God King Okudin’s expression changed drastically. He roared, “God King’s body!”

“Boom!”

Ba Qi Jiu’s terrifying tail swept across god King Okudin’s body, causing him to fly thousands of meters away.
