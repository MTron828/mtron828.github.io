Chapter 70: First-grade Restaurant vs Longxuan Restaurant (2)

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“Let’s have a toast to eating well, drinking well and having a good time today! From tomorrow onwards, our Longxuan Restaurant will start its operations officially and mark a new page of history for Longxuan Restaurant in Rivertown.”

“In the future, people will definitely speak of us when discussing restaurants in Rivertown. As for that First-grade Restaurant, it will become history soon!”

“That’s right, Director Xie! With Director Xie’s capabilities and the publicity we have done over the last few days, First-grade Restaurant is nothing to us. They will just be a part of history soon!”

In the evening, the boss of Longxuan Restaurant brought all his employees to a luxury hotel for a “starting work” feast.

Longxuan Restaurant would be opening the next day. In other words, they were having a celebratory feast today!

They were celebrating the upcoming success of Longxuan Restaurant and for the name of Longxuan Restaurant spreading throughout Rivertown!

“That’s certain. With the ingredients that we have prepared, it will definitely shock the entire Rivertown. I have never seen First-grade Restaurant as a threat to us!” Director Xie revealed an arrogant and cocky expression.

“First-grade Restaurant hasn’t been doing any publicity recently. Could it be that they are so arrogant to believe that their reputation alone is enough to compete with us? That’s really naive!”

A plump middle-aged man that looked like the chef chuckled.

“First-grade Restaurant naturally has to pay for its arrogance. As I have said, I’ll make that brat regret!”

Recalling the arrogant Wang Xian, Director Xie revealed a cold look.

“Come, let’s have a toast to the success of Longxuan Restaurant!” Director Xie stood up and said to the crowd around him.

“Cheers. Our Longxuan Restaurant will definitely shoot to stardom tomorrow!”

“Haha, shoot to stardom!”

Just as the people of Longxuan Restaurant were having the celebratory feast, what they didn’t know was that there was a commotion that broke out in First-grade Restaurant!

“Welcome!”

A group of five people walked into the restaurant in the evening.

“Wow, you guys have made some changes to the entrance!”

A middle-aged regular patron noticed there was a new setup the moment he stepped into the restaurant. He looked at it inquisitively while asking the greeter at the side.

“Yes, Sir.” The greeter smiled.

“However, the changes aren’t significant. It’s just changing the arrangement of some of the things.” The middle-aged man looked around and shook his head slightly. “This won’t do it. Longxuan Restaurant will be opening right beside tomorrow with a 50% discount on everything. Moreover, they have a wider variety of seafood than First-grade Restaurant. I heard that you have a new boss. If this isn’t handled well, your business will be snatched away by Longxuan Restaurant.”

“Sir, we will also be having a 50% discount on all items tomorrow,” the greeter replied with a smile.

“Just having discounts isn’t enough. Do you know the range of seafood that they have? Longxuan Restaurant will be having Atlantic Bluefin Marlin sashimi, precious sea cucumber and many other types of deep sea fish. I heard that there will be an unlimited amount of Australian lobsters and King Crabs.” The middle-aged man shook his head as he spoke. He looked to the group of people with him and continued, “Let’s go try the food of Longxuan Restaurant tomorrow. Their publicity has been really strong recently.”

“I have also heard about Longxuan Restaurant. From their publicity, it seems that it is indeed better than First-grade Restaurant and has lots of top-quality seafood.” Another middle-aged man by the side smiled and commented.

When the greeter heard the words of the middle-aged man, she revealed a faint smile. “Sir, Longxuan Restaurant is still a far cry from us. We have a new boss and it’s only natural that we have made improvements. Sirs, please take a look inside.”

“Alright, let’s go and take a look.” The middle-aged man nodded his head initially but smiled and shook his head soon after. “But I still feel that as compared to Longxuan Restaurant, you guys are a little inferior...”

However, before he could finish his sentence, he saw the nearest display platform to him.

There were 10 yellow croaker fish that weighed about three to four catties each on the display platform. Looking at the colors and the gloss of their bodies, it was clear that they were wild yellow croaker fish!

The middle-aged man was taken aback and commented in shock, “Wild Giant Yellow Croaker! And there’re 10 of them! I would never have expected you guys to be able to get your hands on 10 Wild Giant Yellow Croaker fish!”

“Sirs, feel free to take a look. All the top-end seafood on our 4 display platform are for sale. You could choose from them and we would cook for you on the spot!” a beautiful female waitress standing by the platform said to them.

“These 10 wild giant yellow croaker fish are really precious. Who would have thought that First-grade restaurants would be able to get ten of these...”

This time, he did not complete his sentence. This was because just a short distance away, he saw a whole Atlantic Bluefin Marlin.

It was a 3-meters long Atlantic Bluefin Marlin! His eyes stared wide-open as he said, “Oh my gosh! What a move by First-grade restaurant. Just this Atlantic Bluefin Marlin alone would be comparable to Longxuan Restaurant!”

The waitress at the side simply smiled and didn’t comment.

“Old Liu, take a look at this. Oh my god! Chinese Bahaba Fish! It’s a whole Chinese Bahaba Fish!”

“This is still the first time I have seen a Chinese Bahaba fish. This fish alone is worth several million. These are fish gelatine! Fish gelatine from the Chinese Bahaba fish is the most precious of all fish gelatine. The gelatine alone would fetch several hundreds of thousands!”

“Don’t just look at the Chinese Bahaba fish! Take a look at these! Oh my gosh! I have never seen abalones that are so large. This is just like a dream!”

“One-headed abalone! And there’re 2 of them. There’re also 10 two-headed abalones. Since when are one-headed and two-headed abalones so common? Each one of these is worth over a million!”

“This is crazy! 2 one-headed abalones and 10 two-headed abalones. These are worth close to $10 million. Furthermore, those are Atlantic Bluefin Marlin, Chinese Bahaba fish and Wild Giant Yellow Croaker fish. All these together are worth close to $20 million!”

“First-grade Restaurant is too awesome. This is just like a dreamland!”

“Wow! Mr. Liu, welcome!” At this moment, Manager Huang saw them the moment he stepped out of the office. He smiled and immediately walked over.

“Manager Huang, these Atlantic Bluefin Marlin, Chinese Bahaba and abalones are for sale?” the dumbfounded middle-aged man asked Manager Huang.

“Of course. If Mr. Liu would like to have some, feel free to choose from them. Our chefs would cook for you immediately. These are definitely the most premium food in the world.” Manager Huang smiled and replied. “Moreover, we will be having a grand sale tomorrow. Everything will be sold at 50% of the original price. This would naturally include what you have seen here.”

“In other words, if one would like to have a one-headed abalone, he would just need $1.2 million and could save half of the original cost!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The five middle-aged men were dumbfounded. What the hell! An abalone still costs $1.2 million after a 50% discount?

Gulp! As the middle-aged man looked at the top-quality seafood around him, he couldn’t help but swallow his saliva. “Manager Huang, you guys are really having a showdown with Longxuan Restaurant!”

A showdown? Manager Huang smiled and said with indifference, “Mr. Liu, what do you think of our First-grade Restaurant relative to Longxuan Restaurant?”

“Manager Huang, your new boss is truly awesome to be able to get these world-class top-quality ingredients.”

The middle-aged man smiled and continued, “This isn’t even a contest with Longxuan Restaurant anymore. You guys are simply holding them down and rubbing their faces against the floor! Too awesome!”

Rub rub!
