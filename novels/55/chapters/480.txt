Chapter 481: Four Wives

“Run now! The Fire God is infuriated!”

“All the Fire Demons in the side halls are raging. They are not supposed to come out of the side halls, but now, they are rushing out from them. On top of that, there are even more terrifying Fire Demons!”

“I guess we have disturbed the spirit of the Fire God for the past few days such that all the Fire Demons in the Fire God’s Graveyard are on a riot!”

The entire Fire Spirit Island was seething with all the eight Denominations who had entered Fire God Palace rushing out in terror in the middle of the night.

All the Fire Demons in the Fire God Palace were rampaging as they killed anyone they saw. It was utterly terrifying.

There were more than thousands of Fire Demons, over twenty Dan Realm Fire Demons, and a ten-meter horrifying existence.

With such a strength, it simply overwhelmed all eight forces on the spot. All these Fire Demons were so frightening that they surpassed all the eight denominations as a whole.

“God dammit, why do these Fire Demons keep chasing us? Why?”

All the Nether Flame Experts were appalled at the spot that Nether Flame Denomination occupied.

Four Dan Realm Experts with over forty Inborn Experts, marking half the strength of the denomination, were over there.

Nether Flame Denomination originated from Korea before it developed to a supreme-class existence of Asia.

Yet, they were facing eight Dan Realm Fire Demons’ assaults with horrifying looks.

These Dan Realm Fire Demons were extremely scary. Not only did they possess domineering defenses, but they also had the compelling Flaming Sledge Hammers which were daunting battle techniques. One Fire Demon could single out three to four Dan Realm experts.

Yet, they were wanted by at least seven Dan Realm Fire Demons and hundreds of Inborn Fire Demons.

Desperation and fear shrouded them.

Growl!

While the group from Nether Flame fled desperately, the ground in front of them began to crack.

Two daunting Dan Realm Fire Demons wriggled out from the underground lava, staring at them with murderous intent.

“Die!”

They let out a human voice and lurched at the Nether Flame gang.

“No...”

All of them let out agonizing shrieks.

They were the first to discover Fire God’s Graveyard. Yet, none of them had expected that they would be wiped out at this place.

The entire Nether Flame’s strength was cut in half.

“Run, get out of here now!”

At the same time, the other seven denominations were making their escapes in horror. They frantically scampered out of this hazardous land.

“After all, this is the grave of a God. We have interrupted his sleep and angered him. None of the average men can resist the rage of a God.”

One by one, the various forces fled out. They hovered in the air as they watched the Fire Spirit Island, giving off a red glow while cold sweat broke out on their foreheads.

“Such compelling Fire Demons!”

When all the Fire Demons sprouted out of the entire Fire God Palace, Wang Xian could not help but gasp.

Thousands of Fire Demons with Inborn strength, more than twenty Dan Realm Fire Demons, plus one Budding Realm Fire Demon.

Such domineering strength was much more compelling than Dragon Sect.

Wang Xian stared at those Fire Demons with flickering eyes before he turned to the girl who was surrounded by lava.

Her fiery-red hair was over her shoulder, forming a ravishing profile.

Unfortunately, her perfect figure was wrapped in the scorching lava.

Wang Xian rotated his pupils with flashing red and blue radiance.

“Hur?”

He sensed a death stare darting at him. Wang Xian blinked his eyes as he did not expect that she could sense his gaze.

“Help me gather my treasures. I’m taking a rest, and I’ll be back tomorrow to collect it.”

Wang Xian smiled at her as he made his way to the exit.

The girl gazed at Wang Xian blankly as she let out a sigh.

“So many experts around!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

When Wang Xian stepped out of the Fire God Palace, he scanned the surrounding experts that were hovering in the air. Surprise took over his eyes.

There were about four hundred experts, of which over a score of them were flitting in the air a thousand meters above sea level.

That marked the existence of the Dan Realm.

“Given the strength of Dragon Sect, we could only be ranked as second-tier if we compare ourselves to the foreign supreme-class forces.”

The Dragon Sect that had brought upheaval to the Underworld only had fifty Inborn Experts.

Besides Wang Xian and the other girls, the most powerful, Mo Qinglong, had yet to advance to the Dan Realm.

Compared to the Fire Demons in the Fire God Palace, they were still a far cry away.

Back at the renowned hotel in Dubai, Wang Xian was lying on his soft and comfortable bed.

He had no worries about Fire God Palace since the life of that girl, who was the successor of Fire God, was now in his control.

Hence, none of the treasures would go missing.

“Sister, you...you actually obtained the Fire God’s legacy!”

At this point in time, four young men looked at the girl with disbelief as they came into the main hall in the Fire God Palace.

“Brother, the Fire God Palace was the legacy of the Fire God right from the start. But the condition to inherit it was quite stringent!”

The girl looked at her brother and forced a smile on her face.

“Great, it’s the Fire God Palace! Our reputation and power in Dubai will be greatly enhanced. No one in all of Asia will dare to provoke us!” said the young man with shortness of breath and eager eyes.

“The Fire Demon will obey my commands, but I...”

As the girl spoke, she touched the Hexa-stars at her belly and hesitated.

“What’s wrong, sister? Oh, where is that powerful senior?”

The young man was looking around elatedly, failing to notice the strange look on his sister’s face.

“He... he went back. He should be coming back tomorrow!” The girl hesitated before she replied. “Apart from the Holy Water Scripture, all the treasures in this place belong to him.”

“This... All for him?” The young man looked around and nodded with heartache.

The next morning, Wang Xian woke up and headed to the hotel restaurant in high spirits when a middle-aged man dressed in white odd-looking attire walked over.

“Sir, this is for you!”

The middle-aged man must have been a Dubai native, as only the natives would wear such an outfit.

Curiosity piqued as Wang Xian looked at the slim book that the middle-aged man handed over.

“Who gave this to me?”

Wang Xian took it over and had a look.

“By order, it’s a secret!”

The middle-aged man shook his head slightly, bowed, and took his leave.

Wang Xian took the white-colored book to the restaurant, found a seat near the window, and ordered his food.

“What is this shit? Dubai women prohibiting intimate contact with men as chastity is very important. The beauty of the girl can only be revealed in front of her most beloved person. The girls in Dubai are extremely loyal, while men can have four wives...”

Looking at the introduction of the book, Wang Xian was speechless with the nonsense.

He flipped to the end of the book and discovered a signature.

Sign off, Hertha Mohakaben Cesid Al Adjaya.

The signature was even written in Chinese characters.
