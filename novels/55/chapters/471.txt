Chapter 472: Fire Crystal

Fire Demon: Level 10

Flaming Lotus: Level 5

Wang Xian was astonished to see the Fire Demon and Flaming Lotus in the tumbling lava.

“How deep is this pool of lava?”

Wang Xian looked at the pool of lava that appeared as bottomless as an abyss. From it, he could feel terrifying heat.

He squinted his eyes and looked into the pool of lava.

A red and blue glow flashed in his eyes and the situation of the pool of lava appeared before his eyes. However, layer after layer of fire demons masked his vision and made it impossible for him to see the bottom.

The five of them were shocked by what Wang Xian said. They shook their heads immediately and replied, “We don’t know. No one has entered it before.”

“An expert from the Fire God Denomination entered into the pool of lava previously. However, he returned with severe injuries. As to what is inside, we have no idea at all!”

“Let’s continue our journey forward and get to the side hall as soon as possible!” the young man continued and said to Wang Xian.

“Let’s go. For now, let’s fly over and avoid the fire demons below us. Once a fight is started, there will be more fire demons appearing!” the young man reminded the group solemnly before taking flight.

Wang Xian followed behind the group.

Grrr!

Just as they entered the air space of the pool of lava, that fire demon turned around and stared at them with his bright and black eyes. At the same time, he let out a growl.

“Be careful. If he moves, we have to kill it instantly!” the young man at the front of the group was worried as he charged ahead rapidly.

Grrr!

At this moment, the fire demon charged towards the girl in the middle. In the process, he brought waves of scorching hot lava with him.

“Kill!”

The young man at the front of the group was stunned. He activated the aqua stars and arrows were shot towards the fire demon.

Boom!

Countless water arrows shot through it and scattered the fire demon into countless pieces.

“Hurry! We’ve got to move. Fire demons are very sensitive to water attributes,” the young man shouted loudly and charged towards the opposite shore.

Blop! Blop!

At this moment, bubbles were rising from the pool of lava. Several heads emerged from the pool one after another.

Their heads were the size of a basketball and they were staring at Wang Xian and the group with their clear and black eyes.

“Let’s go!”

The six of them were unmoved. With their speed, they could definitely reach the opposite shore before the attacks of the fire demons reached them.

Puff!

However, a gust of hot wind blew towards them with sparks of fire. The group of youths were instantly shocked.

“Shit! That’s flaming wind. We can’t get there now!”

The young man was flabbergasted and shouted, “Defend! Withstand the attacks of the flaming wind and the fire demons!”

Huh? There’s wind blowing here?

Wang Xian looked ahead of him and was shocked to see the strong gust of wind carrying sparks of fire.

The color of the sparks was even darker than the lava.

Boom!

At this moment, the shape of a hexa-star appeared around them and glowed in a blue light.

Bam! Bam! Bam!

The sparks of the flaming wind fell on it, making clashing sounds. Below them, fire demon after fire demon raised their fists and attacked them.

“Hang in there! All we have to do is to hang in there till the flaming wind is gone!” the young man shouted loudly once again. As he waved his arm, he retrieved the longsword that was hanging behind him and slashed down at the fire demon below him.

There was a total of eighteen fire demons and every one had the strength of an Inborn expert.

Bam bam bam!

However, with the increment of the aqua stars, the battle strength of the five of them could reach the level of a Half-Step to Dan Realm expert.

The girl with a veil carried a blue bow in her hands. Streams of water were flowing on the bow.

As she drew back the bow, the water formed an arrow and shot out directly.

“It seems like I don’t have to do a thing!”

Wang Xian looked across before looking down.

Eh?

At this moment, Wang Xian saw five roughly three-meter-long fire demons emerging from the pool of lava and glowering at the six of them.

Rumble!

Each of them carried a huge lava stone and they threw them towards the sky.

When the two-meter lava stones fell on them, the defense of the hexa-star trembled.

“Shit! Those fire demons have the strength of Half-Step to Dan Realm experts!” The young man turned even gloomier after seeing the three huge fire demons in the pool of lava.

“There’s something in the heads of the fire demons. Those must be treasures!”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes and saw a fiery-red crystal in the head of the fire demon after it had been smashed into pieces.

“You guys are too weak. Just stand aside and leave this to me!”

Seeing their attacks, Wang Xian chuckled nonchalantly as he charged towards the sea of fire demons.

“Don’t break away from the area of the hexa-star!”

When the young man saw Wang Xian attacking the area below them, his face instantly sank.

The other four were also exceptionally bitter.

Once Wang Xian left, their strength would also be weakened substantially.

However, Wang Xian didn’t pay any attention to them. Although the five Inborn experts could be considered immensely incredible among all martial artists, they were still weak in his eyes.

He swung his arm and ropes formed from water streams wrapped towards the fire demons.

Pa pa pa!

As the water rope went around their necks, one could hear the sounds of water sizzling. Wang Xian pulled the rope in an explosive move.

The heads of the fire demons were ripped apart instantly and flew towards Wang Xian.

“What?”

The other five were astonished to witness what had just happened.

The eyes of the girl in the middle flickered as she stared at Wang Xian in disbelief.

“He’s so strong to kill those fire demons in a single strike!”

Bam! Bam! Bam!

Wang Xian cracked open the skulls of these fire demons casually. Soon, several fiery-red fire crystals fell into his hands.

[Fire crystal: Level 10]

Inborn-level material! I can use them to forge weapons or aid in cultivation.

Wang Xian squinted his eyes. Each fire crystal was the size of a fist and was emitting heat.

Sss!

The five of them looked at Wang Xian in shock and gasped.

“This is a fire crystal, the essence of the fire demon. It is also the core of the fire demon. Fire crystals possess spirituality and can turn into fire demons!”

Seeing Wang Xian observing the fire crystals, the young man explained this to Wang Xian while feeling complicated.

“Hmm! These are really useful!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and looked to the pool of lava below him.

“We did not expect your strength to be so strong. You probably could rank among the top Half-Step to Dan Realm experts. Now that the flaming wind has subsided, let’s get over quickly,” the young man took a deep breath and said.

“Wait for me at the opposite shore. I want to take a look under the pool of lava.”

Wang Xian looked at the pool of lava and jumped into it directly.

“Brother, it’s exceptionally dangerous in the pool of lava. Even an Inborn expert would suffer if he entered it...”

Bam!

Just before he could complete his words, Wang Xian was already completely submerged in the pool of lava. This infuriated the young man a little. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“He is really strong but... too reckless!”

The girl in the middle frowned as she looked at the spot where Wang Xian had dived into.

“His strength has completely exceeded our expectations. However, he likes to act tough and believes he is really strong. I wonder if it will turn out to be a good or bad thing to call him along!” the young man remarked as he stared bitterly at the pool of lava.

Haiz!

A sigh came from the girl.
