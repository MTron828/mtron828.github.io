Chapter 1440: War in 14403

The incomparably prosperous imperial city of bloodshed had undergone seven to eight thousand years of history.

The power of the dynasty had caused this imperial city to not have experienced war for thousands of years.

Powerful, harmonious!

When it was past seven o’clock in the evening, the Sun had already set, and the entire Imperial City entered a lively night.

In the huge square in front of the imperial palace, many citizens of the imperial city of bloodshed were here to rest and have fun.

It was a beautiful scene!

“Pa Pa Pa!”

At this moment, muffled and loud sounds suddenly came from within the imperial palace, causing everyone to be slightly stunned.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

When the main gate of the imperial palace opened, everyone’s faces were filled with shock as they looked at the group of people walking out.

The Blood Emperor and the three emperors were riding side by side on their dragon horses. They were all dressed in military attire as they rode towards the outside.

Behind them, there were many insightful emptiness realm experts.

These experts were all familiar to the surrounding citizens.

Other than the insightful emptiness realm experts from the blood flow empire, there were also a group of kings and sect masters from the affiliated forces.

At the very back, there were over a thousand blood-armored guards wearing blood-red armor that covered their entire bodies!

“This... That’s our emperor, the blood emperor. The few beside him are the great emperors. The former emperor, oh my God, what are the Blood Emperor and the others trying to do?”

“Three emperors? Don’t we only have two in the blood flow empire? Why is there another one? Is it the level 6 insightful void martial artist who has been hiding all this time?”

“Oh my God, they are all dressed in military uniforms. Look, the blood emperor and the emperor are all dressed in military uniforms. They are going on a war. What are they doing leading so many experts?”

“Did something happen to the Demonic Beast Clan? The Blood Emperor and the three emperors are all on the move. Has a war broken out?”

Everyone in the front of the palace widened their eyes and discussed in shock when they saw the blood emperor and the others coming out of the palace in military attire.

“Blood emperor, according to the information we received, the dragon-phoenix dynasty, the blood stream sect, and the Light Dragon Dynasty are all at the Sky Sword sect!”

An elder reported to the blood emperor at the front.

“Lead the way!”

There was no expression on the blood emperor’s face.

“Yes!”

The elder nodded and respectfully led them to the right.

“Oh? It’s in that direction. The Blood Emperor and the others are not leaving the city. What is this?”

When everyone saw the blood emperor and the others heading to the right, they were slightly stunned.

On the right, that was obviously not the direction to leave the city.

“That direction, I remember now. The Heavenly Sword sect, Dragon-phoenix dynasty, and the others seem to be heading in that direction. The Blood Emperor is going to destroy the dragon-phoenix dynasty and the others!”

A citizen suddenly exclaimed with his eyes wide open.

“Destroy the dragon-phoenix dynasty, the Heavenly Sword sect, the Light Dragon Dynasty, and the blood stream sect. Haha, The Blood Emperor Is Mighty!”

“I knew it. No one dares to be arrogant in our blood stream dynasty. As long as he dares to be arrogant, we will destroy him!”

“I thought our dynasty would bow down to them. Now it seems that the blood emperor is still domineering!”

“A few days ago, they could only be arrogant when the blood emperor was not here. Now that he is here, it is time for them to die!”

“The Blood Emperor is mighty. Our Blood Stream dynasty is the strongest!”

Excited and excited voices came from the surrounding areas.

In the past few days, the things that came out from the imperial palace made the people of blood flow empire feel aggrieved.

Those four forces actually slapped the faces of their blood flow empire!

Now, their doomsday had arrived!

This caused the people of blood flow empire to take a deep breath. Their eyes shone as they stared at the strongest team of their empire.

“In the flowing sea region, we are the emperor. No one can offend us!”

When Crown Prince Tang Xuewen heard the discussions of the people around him, he raised his head slightly. A proud expression appeared on his face.

He shouted softly and his voice entered everyone’s mind.

“Haha, it’s true. The Blood Emperor and the others are really going to destroy the four forces of the dragon-phoenix Empire and the Sky Sword Sect!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The eyes of all the surrounding citizens lit up as they hurriedly followed behind.

Very soon, the news of the Blood Emperor and the three emperors personally leading a group of insightful emptiness realm experts to kill the four forces of the dragon-phoenix Empire and the sky sword sect spread throughout the entire imperial city.

When the people from the other dynasties and sects received the news, their faces revealed a shocked expression.

In their opinion, the blood flow empire would definitely lower their heads and compromise this time.

However, they never expected that the blood flow empire would actually go over and destroy them!

This was simply too overbearing!

They hurriedly walked towards the castle where the Heaven Sword sect was staying.

When they arrived, they discovered that there were already tens of thousands of people gathered in front of the temporary castle where the Heaven Sword sect was staying.

In front of the castle, the blood emperor and three emperors were standing at the front on their dragon horses. They stared at the castle in front of them with cold faces.

“Three emperors. It turns out that the blood flow empire has been hiding one emperor and four of them are at level six of the Seethrough realm. It’s more than enough to fight against the sect master and Wang Xian of the Heaven Sword sect. There’s a high chance of killing them!”

“Hiss, why would the blood flow empire choose to take action at this time? This... This is too overbearing!”

“Hehe, perhaps the dragon-phoenix Empire and the Heaven Sword sect didn’t expect that the blood flow empire would be so domineering. Even if they had two people at level six of the Seethrough realm, they would still take action!”

Some of the experts from the empire’s sects looked from afar.

“Activate the formation. Don’t let any of you go. Everyone around, retreat. Don’t accidentally injure all of you!”

The Blood Emperor rode his dragon horse in front of the castle and shouted loudly.

His gaze stared at the castle in front of him, and an icy light shot out from his eyes. “Dragon-phoenix Empire, Sky Sword Sect, blood flow sect, and Light Dragon Empire, the people from the four factions, come out and accept your death!”

Come Out and face your death!

The cold voice covered the entire castle.

All the people of Blood Stream Empire retreated, staring at the castle.

“It’s over, it’s over. I didn’t expect Blood Stream Empire to destroy us. I didn’t expect them to have three sixth level profound void martial experts!”

“How could it be? Why would they attack us at this time? This...”

At this moment, in the castle of the Heavenly Sword sect, Hierarch Yi’s forehead was covered in cold sweat. He stood there and said with a pale face.

Before the Blood Emperor’s voice could be heard, they had already learned of this matter. Unfortunately, it was already too late for them to escape!

Even as a top sect in the Liuhai region, facing such a situation made him feel a little flustered.

The blood emperor of the blood flow empire and the three emperors, who were dressed in military attire, had charged over directly. This was something that they had never expected.

At the side, the king of the Guanglong Kingdom was also extremely embarrassed. Even his arms were trembling.

His gaze was fixed on the sect leader of the Spirit Sword sect and Wang Xian, waiting for them to speak.

“Get out. I want to see if they dare to fight in the blood flow Imperial City!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled. He was very surprised that the blood emperor of the blood flow empire had brought three emperors and a group of powerhouses to kill them.

However, he was not afraid!
