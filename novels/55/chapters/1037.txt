Chapter 1038: 1039 Feng Luan (6/10)

Translator: 5496903

A half-step void interpretation pet egg was a huge treasure to some families.

Take all the powerful families in East Sea city as an example. If they could raise a half-step void interpretation pet, they would have a half-step void interpretation master.

They could become the most powerful family in East Sea city.

This was the attraction of a half-step void interpretation pet.

As for void interpretation weapons and armor, they were extremely attractive to experts below the void interpretation level and even to void interpretation experts.

Supervisor Yi and the five shopkeepers were very interested. Just these two items were enough to make Feng Xian’s auction this time completely overpower the auction jointly held by the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop.

Even families from other cities and star-moon city would rush over to buy pet eggs and hollow-level weapons.

They could already imagine the scene of the Phoenix Immortal auction with a huge crowd.

As for the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop’s auction, the number of people might not even reach half of this place.

The group walked towards the central area and came to a street with the largest traffic in the central area.

The group walked into a luxurious four-story red building.

The red building looked extremely luxurious and was one story higher than many of the surrounding buildings.

It occupied a huge area, and when they entered, they saw a huge hall.

“My Lords, we rented this in advance. It’s the largest auction house in East Sea city. The entire hall, including the two floors above, can seat five thousand people. It’s enough to hold an auction here!”

Supervisor Yi said to the veiled woman and the others behind him, “You can live on the fourth floor of the top floor. We have already prepared it for you, My Lords!”

“Okay, I’ll help you!”

The red-haired middle-aged man waved at them.

“Yes, yes!”

Supervisor Yi and the others immediately left.

“Empress, are you planning to start from East Sea City?”

Supervisor Yi and the rest left. The old woman who had not spoken all this while looked at the veiled woman and said softly.

The old woman who spoke was the grand supreme of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan.

He had lived for more than 4,000 years.

He had once accompanied the first empress to battle and was the leader of the fire cloud personal guards.

No one knew how strong she was, but she was definitely not someone that a void interpretation expert could compare to.

At this moment, she looked at the woman beside her, her eyes filled with respect.

At the same time, her heart was filled with flames of anger.

“Star-moon kingdom is a small country affiliated to the Phoenix Dynasty. This place is backed by the ocean, and is the best place to start!”

The veiled woman walked up the stairs lightly, her gaze sizing up her surroundings.

“It’s a pity that our fire cloud sparrow clan can not follow the Queen to establish a new dynasty!”

The old woman tightly gripped the red crutch in her hand as she spoke in a deep voice.

“Yun, we don’t Need Your Fire Cloud Sparrow clan now, but in the future, the fire cloud personal guards will eventually return!”

The veiled woman spoke to the old woman.

“One day, I will once again conquer the world for the Empress and destroy that group of traitors from the Phoenix Dynasty!”

When the old woman heard the Veiled Woman’s words, she was so excited that she directly knelt on the ground.

“Our Fire Cloud Sparrow clan will follow the great empress to the death!”

The other two clan elders, the little girl, and the four middle-aged and four young men hurriedly knelt on the ground and shouted with a resolute expression.

“Alright, Get Up!”

The veiled woman helped the old woman up. “It’s almost two thousand years. There’s no need to rush for a hundred years!”

She continued walking upwards. The Fire Cloud Sparrow clan was very powerful. It could be said that they were a powerful race on the transcendent continent.

With their strength, it would be very easy for them to destroy star-moon kingdom.

However, they could not make a move. They could not help openly.

Once the Phoenix Dynasty knew that the Great Empress of a thousand years ago, the first great empress of all time, was still alive, the Phoenix Dynasty would definitely not allow her to grow up. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

If the group of people who betrayed the Phoenix Dynasty knew that she was still alive, they would not be able to sleep through the night.

If she wanted to rise again, she could only rely on the resources of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan to develop her own force and build the kingdom step by step.

Then she would walk the path of revenge and overthrow the Phoenix dynasty.

She would recreate the grace of the one and only empress, Empress Feng Luan!

“Give me a copy of the information on East Sea City!”

Feng Luan said to them.

“It’s the Empress!”

The middle-aged man at the back took out a copy of the information from his interspatial ring and handed it over.

On it was the strength of all the aristocratic families and all the powerful mercenary groups in East Sea city.

There was also the strength of the city Lord’s mansion and the Army of ocean cultivators.

Everything was recorded in great detail on it.

Feng Luan returned to the room in the middle of the fourth floor. The entire room was extremely luxurious.

The old woman walked in and lit up a stalk of vanilla. A concentrated fragrance instantly spread throughout the entire room.

If an alchemist were to see this stalk of vanilla, he would definitely be dumbfounded.

A profound void tier herb.

A stalk of it was priceless!

“Don’t waste it like this!”

Feng Luan took a glance at it and shook her head before extinguishing it.

The old woman smiled bitterly. The strength and resources required for revenge were completely unimaginable by others.

In order to possess a strength that could contend against one of the five great empires of the transcendent continent, there were far too many things required.

Feng Luan sat there with the information in her hands and started reading. The old woman stood to the side and poured tea, like a maid.

“Sister Feng, you read the information the moment you came here. It’s our first time in East Sea city. Why Don’t we go shopping together and try the special snacks here?”

The little girl who had been following Feng Luan all along saw that Feng Luan had just arrived and was busy, so she came over and said to her.

“No, Xiao Hong, you go play. Just remember to bring me some delicious food!”

Feng Luan smiled faintly at the girl and said to her.

“What’s the point of that!”

The little girl pouted and the old woman at the side stroked her head.

The little girl was obviously very afraid of the old woman. She stuck out her tongue and directly ran out.

“Come, take me to the most delicious place in East Sea City!”

The little girl ran out and said to the four young men standing at the door.

“Little Princess, come, we’ll take you there!”

“You can’t Call Me Princess Outside!”

“Okay, okay, then we’ll call you big miss, Okay, Princess?”

“Yes, okay. Let’s go. It’s not easy to come out once!”

The little girl ran out with a happy face.

The three girls and the young man from the source of fire immediately followed behind.

The four middle-aged men also followed behind to prevent danger.

...

At this moment, another shocking thing happened in East Sea city.

Just now, Feng Xian announced something through the East Sea City Forum, as well as the stores in the east, west, south, north, and central regions.

Six days later, Feng Xian held an auction. There would be hollow-level weapons and armor being auctioned.

In addition, there was also a half-step hollow-level pet egg being auctioned.

As soon as this news came out, it instantly blew up the entire city.
