Chapter 390: Since You Are Here, Don’t Bother Leaving (2)

“Just commit suicide now! You are courting death by killing an Elder from the Sacred Followers Guild!”

“That’s right! Get on your knees and commit suicide! A Sacred Sect isn’t someone a factionless doctor like you can afford to offend!”

“Demon-like genius? Number one on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart? So what if you are? If you offend us, even a genius will be sent into his coffin!”

Feeling the stifling and horrifying aura from the group of experts of the Sacred Followers Guild, the thirty-odd young men who had followed behind were exhilarated and started ridiculing Wang Xian loudly!

“Commit suicide!? Sacred Followers Guild is indeed brazen! Asking me, Wang Xian, to commit suicide?”

Wang Xian stood there and looked at the crowd before him. His expression turned cold as he lifted his head. “An Elder from the Sacred Followers Guild poisoned my sister. I promised a senior that I would only look for you guys five days later. It appears now that my decision then was wrong!”

“Today, every single one of you can forget about leaving!” said Wang Xian. At the same time, he curled his fingers slightly into a claw.

“Haha, you are still thinking of resisting? Fine! Today, I shall kill every single one of you in the name of punishment of the Sacred Followers Guild!”

The burly Elder broke into laughter upon seeing Wang Xian’s reactions. He pulled out a longsword from his waist as he waved his arm. “I, Hu Fu, shall behead you personally to avenge Old Feng and in a memorial to his spirits!”

“Haha! The Sacred Followers Guild wants to punish me? Since you guys are here, don’t bother leaving!”

As Wang Xian completed his sentence, he charged towards the group of Elders from the Sacred Followers Guild.

“Haha, you are indeed worthy of your name. This kind of arrogance is incomparable!”

Seeing Wang Xian charging forward, the burly Elder laughed brazenly. “I shall claim your life!”

“Kill!” The burly Elder struck and the other Elders behind him shouted coldly in unison.

In an instant, the seven Inborn experts from the Sacred Followers Guild moved. The twenty-odd Half-step to Inborn experts who were wielding weapons also launched their attacks at Wang Xian.

The solemn atmosphere instantly turned into a savage one. The expressions of the group of young men instantly changed upon sensing the intense killing intent masked in the atmosphere.

“The genius is about to die!”

“The show has begun!”

“Haha. That Miracle Doctor Wang is indeed brazen. He is the first person I’ve seen who is so arrogant! It will be against all expectations if he survives after acting so brazenly in front of a Sacred Sect!”

The group of young men took several steps back and watched in anticipation. They were waiting anxiously for the demon-like genius to be slain!

“Kill!”

At this moment, Mo Qinglong snorted coldly upon seeing the Sacred Followers Guild attacking.

Rumble!

Instantly, terrifying auras could be felt emanating from the seven of them.

Devilish aura circulated around the six of them. As for the remaining middle-aged man, he wielded a longsword and the killing intent from him was even stronger.

“Show no mercy!”

Mo Qinglong’s voice sounded again. The group of seven charged towards the Sacred Enforcers.

Huh?

The aura that the group of seven emitted shocked the experts from the Sacred Followers Guild.

“Inborn! Seven Inborn experts!” The burly Elder was astonished and his pupils dilated!

“What? There are seven Inborn experts? Those four young men are also Inborn experts?”

The Elders beside him were also stunned. They looked at the seven of them and were aghast.

These four young men looked like they were at most thirty years old. They would never have expected these four young men to be Inborn experts.

A thirty-year-old Inborn expert would have made it to the top five in the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart.

Even a Sacred Sect would find it hard to nurture this kind of prodigy. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yet, the four young men before them were all Inborn experts!

“Those who oppose us, the Sacred Followers Guild, will be hunted and annihilated! This includes your families and sects!” the burly Elder shouted gloomily.

Seven Inborn experts had definitely exceeded their expectations!

In their opinion, even though Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown had good connections, he could at most call up three or four Inborn experts.

However, this was under normal circumstances. Considering that he was facing the Sacred Followers Guild, who would be willing to risk offending a Sacred Sect to help him?

The Sacred Followers Guild had been certain after considering Miracle Doctor Wang’s connections. It would be a safe estimate to say that only a maximum of one-third of them would help him.

However, seven Inborn experts appeared suddenly. This completely exceeded their expectations.

A force with seven Inborn experts would be considered very strong within the Underworld.

For this enforcement mission, only seven Inborn experts were deployed.

“Kill! Leave no man alive!”

Ruthlessness flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes. The next instant, he moved and appeared beside the burly Elder.

His fingers bent like a dragon claw and were packed with dreadful powers.

Argh!

However, before Wang Xian’s attack connected, pitiful cries erupted from the surroundings.

The four dragonians who had just reached the Inborn Realm had charged into the group of twenty-odd Half-step to Inborn experts.

Complete domination! With the strong bloodline and powers, the dragonians could be considered as above average among Inborn experts despite just having reached the Inborn Realm.

The dragonians could easily kill these experts who were just at the Half-step to Inborn Realm.

“What? Seven Inborn experts! This... How could this be possible?”

“How could this be possible? How could he summon seven Inborn experts? Moreover, they have no qualms with killing the Sacred Enforcers of the Sacred Followers Guild? Are they all willing to make a Sacred Sect their enemy?”

“Seven Inborn experts! Seven Inborn experts! How did he call upon so many experts? Furthermore, these experts are willing to stand up against the Sacred Followers Guild!”

The surrounding group of young men was astonished when they saw the seven Inborn experts.

No one would have expected that the people who stood beside the young man were seven Inborn experts!

“Those four men were at most in their thirties. How could they be Inborn experts? Where did these Inborn experts come from?”

Jiang Yuan’s looked in fear at these Inborn experts that had appeared suddenly.

“The Miracle Doctor did not escape because he was confident in his strength. He didn’t mind making the Sacred Followers Guild his enemy!”

The young man in a suit was stunned as he mumbled.

Around him, the other young men were all dumbfounded.

The sudden appearance of seven Inborn experts together with Miracle Doctor Wang who was ranked number one on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart... This force...

“Sacred Followers Guild can’t kill him!” remarked one of the young men with a gloomy expression.

Argh!

“Old Hu!”

“Elder Hu!”

Suddenly, a wretched scream propagated throughout the villa.

The group of young men was taken aback and immediately turned towards the direction of the scream.

“What?”

As they looked over, their eyes widened and were slowly filled with horror!

At this moment, the burly Elder had a huge wound in his chest area.

His eyes widened and stared in fear at the young man before him.

Bam!
