Chapter 36: Buying First-grade Restaurant

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Bzz Bzz!

Wang Xian rode his heavy-duty motorcycle towards First-grade Restaurant.

What he didn’t know was that his casual rejection previously had a huge impact on a cold and noble lady.

“Welcome.”

When he entered First-grade Restaurant, the two greeters at the entrance spoke passionately.

“Table for?” a waitress walked over and asked.

“I’m waiting for a friend,” Wang Xian said to the waitress.

“In that case, please wait here at the moment. I’ll get you some tea.”

The waitress was well-trained and pointed to the sofa at the waiting area. After which, she went to get a cup of water.

Wang Xian nodded his head and sat to the side. He took out his mobile phone and started playing while waiting for Guan Shuqing to arrive.

Clap clap, clap clap!

“Where’s Director Li?”

At this moment, a group of people appeared at the entrance. A young man asked his question with a smile and a cigarette in his mouth.

“You guys are? Do you have an appointment with Director Li?” The greeters at the entrance looked curiously at the group of four men who walked over.

“Director Li was the one who asked us over. Where is he?” the young man replied. He scrutinized the two greeters and commented flirtatiously, “Pretty, beautiful.”

The two greeters frowned.

“Director Zhou! Your guys are here! The office is a little small, shall we sit here?”

At this moment, the slightly plump Director Li walked out from a small room beside the cashier. There was a middle-aged man following beside him.

Upon hearing Director Li’s voice, the edge of Wang Xian’s mouth arched up. He turned his attention over.

At this moment, Director Li was no longer looking as rosy as he had been in the morning. In fact, he looked a little pale and seemed to be fatigued.

The middle-aged man beside him wasn’t looking pleased either.

“Oh Director Li, you aren’t looking too well. Hehe.” The young man looked at Director Li and it was clear that he was mocking him.

“I caught the flu in the morning and am not feeling too well.” Director Li walked over with a straight face and invited him into the restaurant.

“Hehe.” The young man smiled. Together with the three other men who came with him, they headed directly to the sofa in the waiting area. Sitting upright, he looked at Director Li and said, “I’m really surprised to have received Director Li’s call. Just a month ago, I invited you over for a sumptuous banquet and requested to acquire your restaurant. However, you rejected it. What’s the matter now? Did you change your mind?”

“Yeah, I’ve changed my mind. I have a better business plan to execute and therefore am preparing to sell First-grade Restaurant.”

Director Li sat at the side, lifted the teacup served by the waiter and squeezed out a faint smile.

“Oh, is it? In that case, how much is Director Li looking to sell it to me for?” The edge of the young man’s mouth arched upwards. He leaned back on the sofa and seemed to be seeing this as a joke.

“Let’s go with Director Zhou’s previous offer, $23 million!” Director Li looked at him and said.

“What? $23 million?” The young man pretended to be shocked. “Director Li, the $23 million offer was when I came to you and offered to buy. Now that you have come to me to sell, how could it still be $23 million?”

“Moreover...” The young man paused and looked coldly at Director Li. “I wanted to buy this place but Director Li wasn’t willing to sell in the past. I just purchased a restaurant just a stone’s throw away from here and am renovating it. I am still intending to compete with you directly in the future!”

Upon hearing the young man, Director Li’s expression turned ghastly. He replied resolutely, “My First-grade Restaurant has been around for five to six years and its reputation has already spread throughout Rivertown. Even if you would like to compete with me directly, we will not be afraid. As long as my First-grade Restaurant is still around, your restaurant would also be greatly and negatively affected!”

“Director Li...what you are saying is that I shouldn’t open the restaurant that I have already spent over $10 million on, and should spend more money to purchase yours?” The young man looked at him with contempt.

“It’s over $10 million because you bought the building with it. I believe that simply losing some renovation costs to guarantee your business would be a great deal!” Director Li replied with a frown.

“Hehe.” The young man laughed again. He stared at Director Li and replied, “Director Li, since I have decided to do it, I’m not afraid of your First-grade Restaurant. It’s still uncertain who will win in the end but I can guarantee that your losses will be severe.”

“Now that you would like to sell First-grade Restaurant... Great! $13 million. If you would like to sell, I’ll buy. If you aren’t willing, we shall see how it goes.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“$13 million? Impossible. Just the building alone is worth close to $10 million. To ask me to sell my restaurant to you for $3 million?” When Director Li heard his reply, he raised his voice and his face turned dark.

“At most $15 million. If you want to sell, then sell. If you will not, you can just sell to others.” The young man sat there confidently. “With Longxuan Restaurant’s publicity and strength currently, this would be the most you could get from any other buyer.”

Upon hearing what he said, Director Li had an embarrassed look.

Just as the young man had said, the profit of his restaurant each year was only four to five million over the last few years. The asking price of over $20 million wasn’t high at all.

However, there was a strong competitor coming up along this street.

The young master of Rivertown Distant Sea Fishing Group would be entering this business. His family business was in distant water fishing and had ample resources. He would also be able to basically obtain all kinds of seafood.

Seeing how this young man in front of him was willing to spend and was daring, it was hard for him to tell who would emerge victorious in their future competition.

It would be impossible for him to sell his restaurant for over $20 million. In fact, it was still uncertain if he could even sell it for $17-18 million.

Despite his considerations, he knew he would be filled with indignance if he had to sell to him for $15 million.

Director Li’s expression was changing constantly. He was considering all his options, and this incident today was a lethal blow to him.

All the fish in his entire fish farm had disappeared without a reason. Fish that were worth several tens of million had just vanished into the air!

At this moment, he had to return the bank loan as soon as possible. Otherwise, his mortgaged home might be taken over by the bank.

The only option he had was to sell First-grade Restaurant.

He was out of other options!

The young man sat there confidently and said to Director Li, “I can give you cash. As long as you are willing to sell, $15 million will be transferred to your account immediately. You should know that there aren’t many people who can come out with so much cash at one time to invest at this moment.”

“Director Li, it’s better if you sell First-grade Restaurant. Those who are slightly capable would know that buying First-grade Restaurant at the moment might not be profitable. In fact, my brother might even lose from this investment. There aren’t many people who can bear this.” The 18-19 years old juvenile, who was sitting beside the young man, remarked excitedly.

He lifted one of his legs and rested it on the other leg in a cocky manner. Looking at Wang Xian, who had been listening to their conversation, he laughed, “Don’t you agree with me, pal? Will you buy this place if you have $15 million?”

The juvenile was exhilarated. He would be in his freshman year when the school reopened and was an incoming student to the University of Rivertown. With his brother’s restaurant right here and it being the most luxurious in the vicinity, it would be a fantastic experience for him when he brought his classmates over to show off to them.

Just thinking about it made him a little excited.

“I will buy.”

The three words that sounded suddenly from the side shocked the juvenile. He saw Wang Xian had a serious look to him and was instantly stunned. Following which, he burst into laughter, “Haha, my friend. You will buy? Can you even afford it? All you could do is to fantasize about it! Wake up!”

“Director Li, do consider the offer price of $16 million.”

Wang Xian looked nonchalantly at the juvenile and took out a platinum card from the Agricultural Bank of China. One had to have over $5 million deposited in order to get such a card.

Although this card might not have $16 million on it, it was still a symbol of one’s strength.

Capitalism!
