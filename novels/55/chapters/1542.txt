Chapter 1543: 1543 suppressing all the heaven’s favorites 6

“Brother Wang Xian, it’s really you, it’s really you!”

He Yuan was stunned for a few seconds. Looking at the warm smile on Wang Xian’s face and his bright and warm expression, he finally came to his senses.

He walked over excitedly and extended his arm to hug him.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly and patted his shoulder.

However, when all the elite disciples from the empires, families, and sects saw he yuan hugging that priest Wang, everyone was slightly stunned.

Even the eighth Prince of the divine light empire, Tian Qingyuan, and the ninth Prince of the Bingxin Empire, Bing Jinghuan, were slightly stunned. They frowned slowly.

“Young master Wang, I didn’t expect to see you here!”

Lin Yaoyao walked over as well. Her eyes were sparkling as she looked at Wang Xian. She didn’t expect that Wang Xian had changed so much.

“Cough, cough, cough!”

However, at the back, he suiwen saw he yuan walking over. When he heard their words, cold sweat broke out on his forehead.

He couldn’t help but cough twice. His face was filled with disbelief.

“This... this... sister, little sister, is he that Wang Xian? That Sky Demon?”

He suiwen felt the corner of his mouth twitching as he asked.

“Yes, it’s him. It’s definitely him!”

He suiqing also opened her mouth slightly. When she saw that Wang Xian was filled with shock, she immediately walked over.

“Young master Wang, we meet again. It’s great that you’re Alright!”

He suiqing walked over and suppressed the shock in her heart. She said with a smile on her face.

Wang Xian nodded at her. “I’m fine. I’m Fine Now!”

“My Goodness!”

He suiwen, who was standing at the back, looked at Wang Xian’s smiling face. Even when he spoke, he felt as though he was bathing in the spring breeze. He felt a little dazed.

Was this the sky demon that his sister had told him about?

Was this the peerless demon that slaughtered millions of lives in a single night?

Was he the peerless demon that claimed that there were no demons in the world?

How the hell was that possible.

“How... How does that priest Wang know young master he Yuan of the He clan? Moreover, he seems to be very familiar with him. What is this priest Wang’s background?”

At this moment, a surprised voice came from the surroundings.

When he suiwen heard this, his eyes widened again.

‘priest Wang?’?

He had heard of this name before. He was now a very famous priest of light in the vast region.

He treated the patients for a month for free and saved nearly 100,000 people!

He was known as the hanging urn salvation, benevolence!

“Crazy, crazy, Hanging Urn Salvation? Benevolence?”

“A sky demon is actually called benevolence?”

He felt that his worldview was somewhat collapsing and swallowed a mouthful of saliva.

However, when he thought of what he had just said, the corners of his mouth could not help but Twitch.

He was prepared to watch from the side with a mocking expression just now. What if he hated him to the core and killed him at night?

Obviously, this heavenly demon could not be measured by common sense!

Although the He Suiwen family was extremely powerful, they would definitely not provoke a demon who dared to slaughter millions of lives in one night for no reason.

“Ahem, brother Wang Xian, I’m really sorry... I didn’t recognize you just now. Please don’t mind it!”

He suiwen squeezed out a thick smile and walked forward. He spoke politely to Wang Xian.

As he spoke, he even touched his sister with his arm.

He suiqing rolled her eyes at him and looked at Wang Xian. “Young master Wang, this is my brother, he suiwen. My brother is not a proper person. You Don’t have to pay attention to him!”

“Hello!”

Wang Xian nodded at he suiwen.

“Hello, Hello!”

He suiwen quickly replied with a smile.

“Brother Wang Xian, why are you here? Why are you dressed like this?”

He yuan sized up Wang Xian with a smile and asked with a smile.

“I came here while walking. This place is not bad either!”

Wang Xian smiled and did not say much.

However, while Wang Xian and he yuan were chatting and laughing, Bing Jinghuan, Tian Qing, Yuan Tian, Qing Guang, and the rest who were at the side looked embarrassed.

They didn’t expect that priest Wang actually knew he yuan from the He clan.

Moreover, even he suiwen was chatting with him with a smile on his face.

This made them look at each other with embarrassed expressions.

“Young Master Wen, young master he, please move aside. There are some matters that we haven’t resolved yet!”

Bing Jinghuan’s face was solemn as he spoke coldly to he suiwen, he yuan, and the rest in the middle.

“Resolved? What matters do we have to resolve together?”

When he yuan heard Bing Jinghuan’s words, the corners of his mouth curled up slightly as he stared at him coldly.

He stood in front of Wang Xian to express his attitude!

“Haha, Bing Jinghuan, Tian Qingyuan, you want to get rid of brother Wang Xian? Don’t you know what you are capable of?”

“Just the two of you? I’m not the one who said it, but it’s not certain who will get rid of who!”

“I’m not saying that you are all trash in front of brother Wang Xian!”

He suiwen raised his head slightly and swept his gaze across Bing Jinghuan and Tian Qingyuan. He did not give them any face and spoke directly.

In one sentence, everyone present was trash in front of Wang Xian and his brother!

He did not put anyone in his eyes at all.

He Suiwen’s words clearly had the intention of fawning over Wang Xian. It was to atone for what he had said at the beginning.

However, there was also a part of it that was his truth.

The incident of the ancient demon city being destroyed by the sky demon more than a month ago shocked the entire vast region.

He Suiwen was also shocked. When he found out that his sister was at the scene, he learned about it from her in detail.

An evil sky demon who was less than 30 years old, an existence who single-handedly killed seven demon masters.

An expert who shocked even the patriarch of the He clan.

Such a person stood here. In the entire vast region of the same generation, all of them were trash in front of Wang Xian.

Even those below the eighth level of the Seethrough realm were trash in front of Wang Xian.

This was the capital brought by strength.

“Hiss!”

“This... He Suiwen’s words are too arrogant!”

“Everyone here is trash. Didn’t he count himself in? He even included young master he yuan? is that priest Wang really that strong?”

When everyone heard he suiwen’s words, they were slightly shocked.

This was simply putting on airs for that priest Wang!

Moreover, he yuan was also standing beside that priest Wang. It was obvious that he was also supporting him.

The He clan’s forces could be ranked in the top five in the vast region. To be precise, they were ranked fourth.

Excluding the three super forces, the He clan was next. It wasn’t the He clan’s overall strength, but the existence of the holy tree.

With the He clan backing the holy tree, even the superpowers couldn’t stand it!

The He clan and he Sui clan’s strength was much stronger than the divine light empire’s Bing Xin Empire’s.

Looking at the He Yuan and he Sui Wen’s attitude, Bing Jing Huan and Tian Qing Yuan’s expressions were somewhat awkward.

“Oh? What such big words, to actually say that everyone here is trash?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

At this time, a voice suddenly came.
