Chapter 1612: 1612 entered the vast region

“Keke, I’ve finally recovered. I’ve finally been free. It’s been more than a thousand years, a whole thousand years!”

“I came here from the empire. I originally wanted to find a way to break through the longevity realm, but I’ve been trapped here for more than a thousand years!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Keke, but my efforts have not let me down. Although I’ve been thinking about how to get the heart these past few days and haven’t found a way, I’ve found a way to cultivate from within!”

“Keke, relying on that Heart’s understanding of darkness, I have at least increased by dozens of times. Long life can be extended, long life can be extended!”

In the vast and boundless void, Mo Sha saw the huge beast leave. His face revealed an excited expression as he laughed wildly.

More than a thousand years of pain, in exchange for his strength rising to another level. It was completely worth it.

“Keke, Next, I will stand at the peak of the extraordinary continent!”

He flew into the distance with excitement.

In the vast void of the vast continent, little blue led Lan Qingyue and the others as they quickly headed towards the flowing sea region.

Every ten seconds, they would travel tens of thousands of kilometers. A journey of hundreds of thousands of kilometers did not require too much time for them.

In fact, if they kept using it, they would be able to arrive in a few minutes.

However, Xiao Lan’s ability could not be used consecutively.

It would take a few hours to recover after using it ten times.

At this moment, when Wang Xian was injured, the entire dragon palace could sense it completely.

The expressions of all the members of the Dragon Palace changed drastically. Guan Shuqing, Xiao Yu, and the other girls gathered in the Dragon King Hall with anxious expressions. They looked at a fruit on the soul-returning wood with a worried expression.

The fruit was in the shape of a dragon, and it was emitting a powerful energy.

All the leaders of the Dragon Palace were gathered in front.

“Prime Minister Gui, what should we do now? Quickly resurrect Xiaoxian!”

The girls said to Prime Minister Gui with anxious expressions.

“Reporting to the Dragon Queen, according to my investigation, the Dragon King has reached the fourth level of the profound void martial stage, and is comparable to an expert at the eighth level of the profound void Martial Stage!”

“The energy required to resurrect the Dragon King is too huge. There is not enough energy in the Dragon Pool to support His Majesty the Dragon King’s Rebirth!”

Prime Minister Gui said with a slightly embarrassed expression.

“Then what should we do? Let’s go look for sister Feng Luan. She should have a lot of resources in her hands!”

“I have already informed sister Feng Luan. She is rushing over quickly!”

A few girls said anxiously.

“My sisters, what happened to Wang Xian?”

At this moment, Feng Luan, who was wearing a fiery red phoenix robe and a crown on her head, flew over quickly. She asked anxiously.

“Sister Feng Luan, Xiao Xian has fallen outside. She needs a huge amount of resources to revive!”

Guan Shuqing and the other girls walked over immediately and said with slightly red eyes.

“Fallen?”

Feng Luan’s expression changed slightly and a hint of anger flashed in her eyes.

“How many resources do you need? I’ll use the resources of the entire Dragon and Phoenix Empire to revive Wang Xian as soon as possible!”

Feng Luan said immediately.

Swoosh

Just as they were conversing, the heart of light and darkness suddenly flew into the Dragon Palace.

The heart came to the top of the dragon pool at a terrifying speed and floated quietly on it.

“What’s That?”

Everyone in the Dragon Palace was slightly shocked and quickly looked at the heart of Light and darkness.

“There’s the aura of a little immortal on it!”

The girls sensed and exclaimed.

“The heart, that should be the Dragon King’s heart. We should gather resources now and prepare for the Dragon King’s Resurrection!”

Prime Minister Gui immediately said.

Feng Luan didn’t hesitate and immediately notified him.

In an instant, the entire dragon and Phoenix Empire started to operate.

The current flowing sea region, which was more than 200,000 kilometers wide, was completely ruled by the Dragon and Phoenix Empire.

A single order from Feng Luan could decide the life and death of tens of billions of people.

“Buzz!”

“Reporting to the Dragon Queen, reporting to Prime Minister Gui, a terrifying giant beast has suddenly appeared!”

“There’s a familiar aura on it!”

Two hours later, the Yaksha’s anxious voice sounded.

“Sisters!”

Lan Qingyue’s voice sounded.

“It’s the Dragon Queen. Put away your weapons!”

“Greetings, Dragon Queen!”

The Yaksha’s voice came from the sea.

“It’s qingyue!”

“Qingyue is back!”

The girls in the Dragon Palace were surprised and immediately looked up.

“What a huge body. Is this Xiao Lan?”

A huge figure appeared in the sky above the Dragon Palace.

The girls looked at Xiao Lan with shock on their faces.

“This aura?”

Feng Luan’s pupils constricted slightly as she stared at Xiao Lan with a serious face.

“Ninth level of the void interpretation realm. I didn’t expect Xiao Lan to reach the ninth level of the void interpretation realm less than three years after sister Qing Yue left!”

She took a deep breath and looked shocked.

Because of the Dragon Pond, Feng Luan had already reached seventh level void interpretation. After transforming into a phoenix, she could fight against ninth level void interpretation.

But she had reincarnated and recultivated.

“Eh? Miss Jian ‘er and sect Master Ling, Ao Yao and Ao Jian are also here!”

Prime Minister Gui looked over and showed a trace of surprise.

“Sisters, let’s catch up later. Xiao Xian has already prepared the resources that he needs to be resurrected before he dies!”

“I have also collected her body!”

Lan Qingyue entered the Dragon Palace and immediately walked towards the Dragon Pool.

“That’s great! Let’s go there immediately!”

The group of girls immediately walked towards the Dragon Pool.

Ao Jian and Ao Yao flew over and placed all the resources in front of the Dragon Pool to be absorbed.

At the same time, Prime Minister Gui plucked Wang Xian’s soul-returning fruit and placed it into the dragon pool.

Dragon Blood, soul-returning fruit, heart of light and darkness, five elements crown.

Finally, Wang Xian’s dragon body was placed into the dragon pool.

Buzz

In an instant, a strong energy gathered in the dragon pool.

Five Elements Power, Light and darkness power.

“Phew, these resources should be enough for little immortal to recover completely!”

Lan qingyue heaved a heavy sigh of relief.

“Other than the five elemental powers, why does Wang Xian have the powers of light and darkness?”

“What exactly happened? With Wang Xian’s current strength, he should be a top-notch expert even in the vast region!”

Feng Luan stood at the side and said with a frown.

“I don’t know much. It was purely an accident that I met Little Xian!”

Lan qingyue shook her head and looked at Ao Jian.

“Dragon Queen...”

Ao jian cupped his hands and told her everything he knew.

“The southern Royal Family of my sect?”

Anger appeared in the girls’eyes when they heard Ao Jian’s words.

“It seems that it’s time to march into the vast area!”

Feng Luan murmured with a hint of killing intent in her eyes.

“The Dragon Palace’s development speed in the flowing sea area has slowed down. The vast area is a good choice.”

Prime Minister Gui narrowed his eyes and glanced at all the leaders of the Dragon Palace and the Dragon Queens.

With the blue-green Moon Dragon Queen and the Phoenix Emperor, their arrival in the vast area was intimidating.
