Chapter 789: 0790 Dragon Gate Auction 3

Translator: 549690339

At 9:30 am, five to six thousand people crowded around the three shops on the floating island.

The items from the three shops, medicinal pills, spirit tools, and earth star fish, were basically swept clean.

The auction house opened punctually at this time, and people swarmed in. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

There were only three thousand seats in the auction house, and almost half of the people had to stand at the back.

However, many martial artists did not have much objections. After all, 90% of them were not here to auction items, but to watch this grand auction.

The Immortals had their own private rooms on the second and third floors.

“Peng, everyone, quiet down!”

Mo Qinglong stood on the auction stage and shouted softly. He held a hammer in his hand and his voice resonated in everyone’s hearts.

Wang Xian, Xiao Yu, Guan Shuqing, and the rest of the girls were in a private room on the third floor. They were all looking down with smiles on their faces.

A half-step immortal powerhouse was still very intimidating. Sensing Mo Qinglong’s faint aura, the entire auction house instantly quieted down.

“Thank you all for coming to participate in the first auction held by our Dragon Gate auction house. The highest bidder will get the item and can pay with elixirs and spirit stones. Without further ado, the first item to be auctioned is a grade-13 spiritual artifact, the artifact of the Immortal!”

Mo Qinglong waved his arm, and a sharp longsword flew out from behind him. The spiritual sword emitted a dazzling sword light, and the entire sword was incomparably sharp. Some half-step infant realm experts even felt a bone-piercing sword light.

It caused fear in their hearts.

“Hiss!”

All the auctioneers who came to participate in the auction had shocked expressions on their faces, and all the disciples of the immortal sect who were wielding swords stared at the spiritual sword floating on the auction stage with fervent eyes.

It was an immortal artifact, a spirit artifact that even immortals were interested in. It was actually the first one to be put up for auction.

Currently, there was no price on the market for the immortal artifact because no one was selling the immortal artifact.

“The starting price is 800,000 spirit stones, or an equivalent medicinal pill!”

Mo Qinglong swept his gaze across everyone and said with a smile on his face.

800,000.

After hearing this price, everyone sucked in a breath of cold air.

“800,000. In terms of the value of the immortal God weapon, it’s not very expensive. However, other than the immortal gods, who can afford 800,000!”

“I wonder who will get the first immortal God weapon. Just now, I saw a total of 12 immortal gods enter the private rooms on the second and third floors!”

“An infant stage expert holding an immortal God weapon can compete with a half-step immortal God expert!”

The disciples of the immortal sect looked at him with burning eyes.

“Eight hundred thousand!”

A young man sitting in the hall raised his hand arrogantly and shouted.

“Seventh place in this heaven’s pride competition, the descendant of an immortal god of the path of the beheading immortal, he’s really too rich!”

“Eight hundred thousand spirit stones, my goodness!”

The disciples of the immortal sect stared at the young man with envious faces.

“850,000!”

At this moment, an old man’s voice sounded, shocking everyone in the auction once again.

“It’s the grand elder of the upper nine immortal sects, an existence at the half-step immortal God realm!”

Everyone looked over and said with sparkling eyes.

“900,000!”

In less than ten seconds, another voice sounded.

All the disciples looked over and saw the Ji character on his clothes, and their hearts trembled.

It was another top-tier expert who was half a step away from the immortal God realm.

“One hundred!”

Everyone was shocked for more than ten seconds when a dignified voice came from the second floor.

The Immortal God had made his move!

Everyone looked up, their eyes shining.

The Immortal God’s weapon was the most top-tier spirit weapon in the world. There were about one hundred known immortal gods in all the immortal sects in the jianghu.

Among the one hundred immortals and gods, more than half of them didn’t have an artifact of Immortals and gods.

Only warriors who cultivated the water and fire attributes could refine artifacts.

Among all the immortal sects, the ones who could refine artifacts were the Yongchang immortal sect, the Great Flood Immortal sect, the upper nine immortal sects, the True Martial Immortal sect, and the Holy Medicine Immortal sect.

Compared to the other immortal sects, these four immortal sects were better at refining spirit artifacts.

The other puppet immortal sects, the Yuwen clan, and the Xuanyuan clan also had some disciples who specialized in the fire element to learn the art of refining weapons.

However, it was extremely difficult for them to refine immortal god weapons.

In the entire jianghu, there were no more than five great artifact masters who could refine immortal god weapons.

However, if an ordinary great artifact master wanted to refine a spirit weapon, not only did they need enough materials, but they also needed a long time.

Refining an immortal spiritual tool might take a few months, and there was a high chance of failure.

Immortal spiritual tools were different from ordinary spirit tools. They needed to engrave arrays, or runes.

In terms of complexity, they were dozens of times more complicated than ordinary spirit tools.

Moreover, there was another very important point. If one wanted to master the array runes, the array runes were very rare.

Some artifact masters could only master the formation runes of the staff, so they could only forge the staff. Swords and sabers could not be forged.

If Wang Xian did not obtain many formation runes from Feng Luan, it would be very difficult for him to forge an immortal artifact.

For an ordinary artifact master, it was already impressive to have five to six formation runes.

Only the empress of the extraordinary continent, Feng Luan, had forty to fifty formation runes.

At present, many celestial artifacts were passed down from the previous immortal sects.

The value of celestial artifacts far exceeded Wang Xian’s imagination.

“1,100,000!”

Another celestial artifact made a move, causing the group of immortal sect disciples sitting in the Hall to fall silent. They could only watch as the big shots fought over them.

“Haha, I didn’t expect that a celestial artifact could be sold for so much money. With this, I can complete the first transformation within half a year at most!”

Wang Xian looked at the auction below and revealed an excited expression.

“A celestial artifact that hasn’t even reached the level of a broken weapon is actually sold for more than a million low-grade spirit stones. There are so many idiots!”

A cold and disdainful voice came from the side.

Wang Xian turned his head and saw Feng Luan occupying Guan Shuqing’s body. The corner of his mouth curled up slightly as he asked curiously, “Low-grade spirit stones? There are middle-grade and upper-grade spirit stones in your transcendence continent? How do you forge a celestial artifact?”

“Your strength is too weak!”

Feng Luan said coldly and arrogantly with an expressionless face.

Wang Xian pursed his lips. The five girls at the side were already used to seeing Guan Shuqing suddenly transforming into a person.

“When you and I reach the transcendence realm, I will tell you. At that time, I want you to help me rebuild my body!”

Feng Luan’s cold expression eased up a little as she said to Wang Xian.

“Alright, of course there’s no problem!”

Wang Xian smiled and nodded his head. He continued to look downwards.

Helping Feng Luan rebuild her physical body would naturally help Shu Qing recover as well.

Right now, both of their souls occupied the same physical body. Other times, it was fine. However, when they were clapping lovingly on the bed, both of their souls would change from time to time. 1

One second, it was still Guan Shu Qing. The next second, it was Feng Luan.

However, Wang Xian felt a strange excitement towards this situation.

The Empress!

Ga Ga!
