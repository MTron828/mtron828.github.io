“Bang!”

The body of the devilish young man fell into the sea and landed at the bottom of the sea.

Wang Xian moved his body and entered the sea. The surrounding monsters disappeared and Ao Qitian and Ao Jian followed closely into the sea.

“It’s a pity that it’s not one of the two devilish middle-aged men!”

Wang Xian stood at the bottom of the sea and looked at the body. He was slightly disappointed.

“However, there’s no rush. With AO Yaoyao around, the ambush and assassination can be almost a hundred percent successful, even if the opponent is a middle-level immortal!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and the interspatial ring in the devilish young man’s hand flew into his hand.

“There are really a lot of treasures.”

Wang Xian was slightly surprised. There were a total of three blood-red daggers. Including the two that were thrown out just now, there were a total of five daggers.

All five of them were grade-13 daggers and were extremely sharp.

After the collision with their spirit swords, a gap appeared on his five spirit swords.

Apart from the five grade-13 daggers, there were also many metal materials. All of them were grade-13.

There were very few elixirs and the like. There were only some healing spiritual herbs.

In this world, it was obvious that there were more materials for spirit tools while various types of spiritual herbs were rarer.

There were not even a single medicinal pill. There were no alchemists in this world.

“Let’s go. Let’s change positions.”

Wang Xian kept the corpse into his interspatial ring and said to Ao Jian and AO qitian.

“Yes!”

Ao Jian and AO qitian nodded.

“I’m afraid that they will know about the disappearance of the demonic young man very soon. I don’t know when that time comes...”

Wang Xian mumbled as his eyes revealed a hint of coldness.

The disappearance of an immortal God would definitely cause them to feel fear.

After all, it was better to lose an immortal God than to lose 1,000 infant stage warriors.

“They should be moving together next. It will be troublesome to assassinate them again. Let’s kill another one before they discover us!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he looked around.

“Time is of the essence. The most obvious spot is on the left. There is an immortal god among the black birds in the sky. It’s a pity that it’s not the two demonic middle-aged men. However, it’s too much of a waste of time to search for the two demonic middle-aged men. Moreover, accidents might happen!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly. He moved his body and flew towards the left.

He stopped when he was ten kilometers away from the immortal.

The senses of an immortal were extremely terrifying. They could sense any unusual movements within a ten-kilometer radius unless they had concealed themselves beforehand.

However, there were more than ten thousand black birds in the sky. The probability of being discovered was rather high.

“Set up an ambush at the place that she has searched. With the vigilance of the people in the Ding Yu world, they will definitely choose the safest route to return after learning that the demonic young man was killed!”

“The route that she took just now is definitely the safest route in her eyes. Set up an ambush when she returns. Although there is only a 50% chance, we can give it a try!”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the area that the demonic woman passed by in the sky. He slowly came to the bottom of the sea and waited quietly.

He waited for the woman to return.

He wasn’t sure if the woman would take this path, but he could only take a gamble.

The Ding of Yu world wasn’t very big. With the speed of an immortal god, once he was discovered, it would take less than a minute for all the immortal gods to rush over.

Within a minute, Wang Xian was confident that he could assassinate one immortal God, but he would definitely be targeted by the other four immortal gods.

Currently, with the strength of the two middle-aged men, even if it was four against four, they did not have the slightest chance of winning.

The two middle-aged men were gods. Ao Jian and AO qitian had to join forces to barely be able to fight against them. It was obvious that Ao Yao could not deal with two of them.

In a four-on-four situation, they might be killed.

He could not take the risk. He would only take action when he was fully prepared.

“All of you, be prepared in the surroundings. Once you enter our range, activate the formation. If you are a little far away from us, give up!”

Wang Xian reminded the surrounding strange demons.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The four strange demons holding the formation jade disc nodded. They came to the surface of the sea and waited quietly.

“It’s too difficult to kill an immortal-level existence!”

Wang Xian sighed slightly. He stood in the middle of the sea and calmed his mind.

Time passed slowly. The immortals from all directions were searching carefully.

The range of their search was very wide and fast. With the puppets and the strange black birds, they could search an area of nearly 20 kilometers in one go.

“You can find any clues!”

Two hours later, a voice suddenly came from the north. The voice echoed throughout the entire Yu Ding world.

“No!”

“No!”

A cold and charming voice sounded. They frowned and scanned their surroundings.

The Yu Ding world was not big, but it was not small either. Even if they were immortals and gods, it would be difficult for them to search every corner.

“Young Demon, what about you?”

At this moment, at the northern end of the world of the cauldron of Yu, Blood Arrow heard that there was no response from young demon. He frowned and shouted again.

His voice sounded once again in the entire world of the cauldron of Yu.

The snow demon and the bewitching woman also raised their brows. Their eyes flickered as they stood on the spot.

“Young Demon!”

After more than ten seconds, there was still no reply. This made blood arrow slightly stunned. He growled in a deep voice and shouted again.

“Not good, let’s return to the island and gather!”

There was still no reply. The Snow Demon’s expression changed as she shouted loudly.

“Go!”

The bewitching woman also felt her scalp go numb.

The young demon had actually lost contact and lost contact. The result was very likely that he had been killed.

“That old pervert, the young demon, is even stronger than me!”

The bewitching woman’s eyes flickered as her eyes were filled with vigilance.

Her figure moved and she returned to her original path at a terrifying speed. She didn’t even bring along the strange black cries around her.

Boom! Boom

She waved her arm and the human skull staff appeared in her hand. The demonic aura around her body condensed into a powerful defense.

With her vigilance, she didn’t step into the area that she hadn’t searched earlier. Instead, she returned to her original path.

“She’s Here!”

When Wang Xian heard the voice, he held his breath. When he saw the woman who was full of vigilance and had even set up a defense around him, a glint flashed across his eyes.

“She’s really vigilant. However, it’s also because of your vigilance that she took your life!”

Wang Xian looked at the woman who was flying over quietly and shouted softly, “Do it!”

Buzz

In an instant, the woman’s figure appeared above them.

At this instant, the concealment formation was activated.

Wang Xian and Ao Jian and Ao Qitian attacked at the same time.

Everything happened in an instant.

The terrifying attacks of the three of them caused the expression of the woman in the sky to change drastically.

“Oh no, they are lying in wait for me. Hurry over!”
