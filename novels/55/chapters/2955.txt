Chapter 2956: On the mutation of an lie

“Dragon King, I have recovered. I felt like I was dead just now!”

An lie looked at Wang Xian and said with a miserable face.

As he spoke, he looked at his own body. He had the urge to vomit blood.

“My extremely handsome face. How did it become like this? !”

!!

He shouted mournfully.

“Do You Feel Anything Now?”

Wang Xian asked him with a dark face.

“HMM? Feeling?”

An lie touched his body and examined it from top to bottom. Then, he looked into the depths of the demon cave.

“Dragon King, I feel that the depths of the demon cave has a strong attraction to me!”

He spoke.

“Is that so? Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian moved his body and flew into the demon cave with an lie.

Tian Cheng followed behind him with a thoughtful look on his face. His eyes were sparkling.

“Dragon King, that altar gives me a strong attractive force.”

An lie spoke as he was close to the depths of the devil lair.

Wang Xian released him and looked at an lie.

An Lie’s eyes were fixed on the altar. His body moved and he came to the sky above the altar. He looked down.

“Buzz!”

At this moment, the entire altar emitted a mysterious energy. The energy surged towards an lie.

An lie sensed this energy and slowly opened his arms.

Waves of black energy mixed with blood-red energy surged into his body.

The patterns on the altar below quickly disappeared.

Five minutes later, the entire altar seemed to have disappeared.

The blood-red patterns on an Lie’s body emitted a strange luster.

It was as if he had turned into an altar.

“This is?”

An lie widened his eyes and stared at his body in shock.

“What’s the situation?”

Wang Xian stared at an lie and asked.

“Dragon King, I have a special ability.”

An lie gulped and said.

“What ability?”

Wang Xian asked immediately. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Dragon King, Look!”

As an lie spoke, his figure appeared on the right side of Wang Xian.

This caused his pupils to constrict slightly as a look of shock appeared in his eyes.

Instantaneous movement. It was a real instantaneous movement.

As if time had not happened, an lie teleported directly from him to his side.

Buzz

In the next moment, an lie disappeared instantly and came to the side of the Heaven Formation.

“Dragon King, don’t resist!”

As an lie spoke, Wang Xian felt a surge of energy enveloping him. In the next moment, he realized that he had arrived at another demon cave.

“What a fast teleportation, this…”

The Heaven Formation widened its eyes and its face was filled with shock.

“How is it, Dragon King? Haha, it’s amazing. Teleportation, that special ability of the altar!”

An lie roared in excitement.

“Tell me more about it!”

Wang Xian said with a twinkle in his eyes.

“Dragon King, I don’t know the reason either. All I know is that I can teleport. As long as my mind can react to this teleportation, I can teleport to another place. It doesn’t require any time.”

“There’s one more thing that’s terrifying. It’s not blocked by objects.”

An lie was extremely excited. He almost wanted to roar.

“Not blocked by objects?”

The Heaven Array was shocked. With a wave of his arm, an array enveloped an lie directly.

Buzz

An lie was enveloped by the array. However, in the next moment, he teleported out instantly.

Wang Xian and the heaven’s formation looked at each other and couldn’t help but swallow a mouthful of saliva.

The formation that the heaven’s formation used earlier was a trapping formation. Even a first level celestial thearch wouldn’t be able to escape from it.

However, an lie, a ninth level celestial thearch, was actually able to escape in an instant.

Was this because he wasn’t obstructed by any objects?

He wasn’t obstructed by anything!

“This ability is too abnormal. It ignores the formation and the instantaneous movement of objects. Unless it’s a special attack, it’s very difficult to kill him.”

“It will be even more terrifying after the increase in strength!”

Heaven’s formation could not help but speak.

“Furthermore, he can bring others to teleport. Is there a limit to the number of people you can bring?”

Wang Xian stared at an lie and asked.

“I don’t know, Dragon King. I don’t know what the limit is either. However, bringing people to teleport is not as simple as you think, Dragon King!”

An lie said.

“HMM?”

Wang Xian’s heaven array looked at him.

“Dragon King, there is one condition to bring someone to teleport. That is, that place has this altar!”

“I can only bring someone to the side of this altar.”

An lie said.

“Altar!”

Wang Xian and heaven array were deep in thought.

“The changes that an lie is going through now seems to have become the carrier of the altar. However, the altar itself does not have any energy. It only has the ability to teleport. An lie was infected by the aura of the altar and he was saved because he was born in a fetus. Be it the energy of the altar or the energy of the fetus, they are both very special!”

“These two special energies have formed his special constitution. He possesses this special ability and can teleport on his own initiative!”

“His essence is still the altar. He can make people teleport. There are conditions for the teleportation, which is the location of the other altar.”

The sky array spoke.

“An lie, tell me about the method to summon yaoxie. I have an experiment!”

Wang Xian nodded his head in deep thought and said to him.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

An lie nodded his head and immediately passed the method to Wang Xian.

To summon Yao Xie, one had to build an altar first. The altar was the same as the one in the demon lair.

The difference was that there was no need for special materials. One only needed to contain energy.

Once the altar was built, fresh blood would be dripped. The stronger the blood, the stronger the Yao Xie could be summoned.

However, it didn’t mean that the evildoer could be summoned every time. Even a hundred times might not be successful.

This was because evildoers could choose whether they wanted to be summoned or not.

Evildoers were summoned to conquer a piece of the starry sky. If the summoner was too strong, they wouldn’t go over.

Wang Xian simply built an altar and looked at an lie.

“Dragon King, I can sense this altar. Although it’s weak, I can teleport people over!”

An lie said immediately.

“If that’s the case, I can catch them off guard!”

Wang Xian mumbled.

“This ability is very perverse. For example, entering a powerful treasure land. If there’s a defensive formation around it, it won’t be of any use to an lie. An lie can also teleport over and set up an altar before bringing people over.”

“Moreover, this kind of teleportation is much faster than returning to the divine kingdom. With a thought, he can teleport to another place.”

“If we set up an altar in the Dragon Palace, even if we encounter danger and are trapped by the array, an lie can instantly bring us back to the Dragon Palace and ignore any obstacles!”

Tian Cheng’s eyes flickered as he said.

“That should be the case!”

An lie said with a smile from the side.

“It’s indeed very perverse!”

Wang Xian nodded his head heavily.
