“Very good, you guys actually found a life-preserving planet!”

Three hours later, on a planet not far from the Northern line, Wang Xian smiled as he looked at the ocean!

By establishing a dragon palace here, he would be able to travel to and from the southern star system quickly. He wouldn’t need to fly for a few days anymore!

Buzz

Soon, with the ability of the system, a dragon palace was built quickly!

In the next moment, Wang Xian returned to the main dragon palace through the teleportation formation!

“Prime Minister Gui, how are the preparations going?”

Wang Xian returned to the Dragon Palace and asked Prime Minister Gui directly!

“HMM? Dragon King, you’re back so soon? Everyone is ready. This time, we’ll send a group of members from the Dragon Palace, led by Mu Zesen and the rest of the Heaven Formation, to drive the dragon peak directly to the Demon Island!”

Prime Minister Gui immediately replied when he saw Wang Xian!

“Alright, send more experts. The battle on the Demon Island will not end in a short period of time. It will be a great opportunity for us!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. “We can send some over first. Ao Yao and the rest have obtained a life planet on the Demon Island. We can head there directly from the teleportation formation!”

“Good Dragon King. I will follow you there later to take a look at the situation there before we deploy!”

Prime Minister Gui said!

Wang Xian nodded his head and came to the sky above the Dragon Palace! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Very soon, the towering Dragon Peak in the sky began to move. It was heading towards the Demon Island at a terrifying speed!

The Dragon Peak was huge and its speed was terrifying. When it was operating at full speed, it was no slower than the flying speed of an immortal king level 8 powerhouse!

At this speed, they would reach the northern line of the Demon Island in three days!

Wang Xian smiled when he saw the Dragon Peak setting off!

“With the power of the Dragon Peak, other than the great sect from last month, the other four forces at the Northern line could not break through the defense of the Dragon Peak. They could even destroy them with the help of the Dragon Peak!”

Wang Xian mumbled and teleported to the Demon Island!

Wang Xian moved the planet directly to the northern front, which was in front of the Abyss!

The experts on the planet at the edge of the Northern River sect were stunned when they saw someone moving the planet over!

At this moment, many forces were moving the planet further away. Now that they were moving it here, this...

“Master, the sect leader and the rest allowed me to enter the Bei Chuan Sect’s secret realm to increase my strength. The sect leader and the rest said that once I enter the secret realm, I will be able to break through to immortal king level six very quickly!”

On the second day, bei Shuang found Wang Xian and said to him!

“Oh? Your sect allowed you to enter the secret manual? That’s a good thing!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and said with a smile!

“Yes, master might not be able to contact me for the next one to two days. I’ll come and look for you after I break through!”

Bei Shuang said with a smile!

“Alright, I’ll be on this planet!”

Wang Xian nodded his head!

After bei Shuang said that, he left immediately!

“One to two days can help bei Shuang advance by one level. Is this the foundation of a powerful sect?”

Wang Xian looked at bei Shuang’s departing figure and mumbled!

Bei Shuang had just broken through to immortal king level five. According to his estimation, even if there were sufficient resources, it would still take a few years for her to break through!

However, to be able to break through in one or two days, this bei Chuan Sect’s secret realm must be very powerful!

“Shuang ‘er, come out immediately after breaking through into the secret realm. The energy consumption of this secret realm is too huge. It has been tens of millions of years since this secret realm has been activated!”

In front of a cave on the planet of the Bei Chuan Sect, the sect leader ordered bei Shuang with a serious expression!

“It’s the sect leader!”

Bei Shuang nodded, to be able to make the sect leader say that it consumed too much energy, it must have consumed a terrifying amount!

And this secret region, even she didn’t know about it, there probably weren’t many within the sect who knew about it!

“After Shuang er enters, she’ll be able to reach undying level 6, when that time comes, her battle power won’t be any weaker than mine, Haha!”

Bei Chuan Leader said excitedly!

An undying level 8 warrior who was less than 40,000 years old, shocking through the ages!

Bei Chuan Sect’s future depended on her!

Rumble

However, just a day later, bei Shuang’s silhouette walked out of the secret region!

Her entire body was covered in frost, on her head, there was an ice cap, the ice cap dragon coiled around!

She walked out of the secret realm with a powerful aura!

“Hahaha, good, good, good. In just one day, Shuang ‘er broke through and came out of the secret realm. God Bless Our bei Chuan sect, Hahaha!”

At the entrance, Bei Chuan sect master looked at bei Shuang walking out of the secret realm in shock, and then her face was filled with excitement!

To advance one level in one day after entering the secret realm, this talent was too terrifying!

...

“Hu, thank you sect leader for your training!”

Bei Shuang cupped his hands and thanked him!

“Hahaha, Shuang er, the Bei Chuan Sect has trained you, the future Bei Chuan sect will also depend on you to lead, we’ll depend on you to take a step further, let’s go, we’ll head to the Northern Line and announce this matter, Hahaha!”

The sect leader was extremely excited, he continued, “Shuang er, how’s your battle strength now, if you breakthrough again, how long will it take?”

“I can totally fight against an undying level 8 warrior now, if I break through again, it will take a few years!”

Bei Shuang said happily too!

When she smiled, it was like the Frost had thawed, it was like a spring breeze!

“A few years!”

Beichuan sect leader’s breathing was hurried, he looked at her passionately, clenching his fists!

“Let’s Go!”

His face was full of smiles as he flew towards the teleportation formation!

...

“Eh? Has the battle erupted again? Sect leader, let’s Go!”

When bei Shuang and the others arrived at the Northern line planet, they immediately discovered that the abyssal seed was currently erupting in battle!

Bei Shuang clenched his fist and smiled as he spoke to the sect leader!

“Alright, let me see Shuang ‘ER’s strength!”

“Let’s also let the Bei Chuan sect and everyone on the demon island see Shuang ‘er’s strength!”

The bei Chuan sect leader’s eyes flickered as he spoke!

“Alright!”

Bei Shuang’s figure moved, and a pair of frost wings instantly appeared on her back as she flew straight into the Abyss!

The battlefield here was closer to the central region, and the number of abyss seeds were even more numerous and stronger!

When the Frost entered the abyss, she wore a frost crown on her head, and her entire person was like a fairy from the nine heavens!

With such grace, even the daughters of the large sects were too far away from him!

“Yin, Ice Dragon Claw!”

Bei Shuang rushed into the battlefield, her gaze locked onto a few level 7 undyings, her dragon claw attacking them!

“Howl Howl Howl!”

The three level 7 undyings felt bei Shuang’s power, revealing a trace of fear as they roared!

“Howl Howl Howl!”

Behind them, an undying level 8 seed looked at her, its eyes filled with bloodlust as it charged forward!

“Shuang er, let’s kill him!”

Bei Chuan Leader saw the undying level 8 seed appear, he immediately moved and roared!

Ahead, the three undying level 7 seeds felt it.
