Chapter 456: The Battle Of The Ages (2)

“They are just a small Dragon Sect after all led by an arrogant kid who thinks he can act as such with just fifty Inborn level disciples. Tomorrow, we will crush them easily together with the Medical Saint Sect!”

At this very moment, within Qiao Clan in Nanjing, a crude and bad-tempered old man sat in the middle. Before him, there were seven to eight hundred people.

Among which, several Inborn experts with terrifying auras stood in two lines to his left and right. All of them had cold expressions.

“Laozu, that brat from Dragon Sect has fifty Inborn experts. Moreover, all of them are very young. He probably obtained some incredible treasures. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to rise up so rapidly.”

Before him, an old man in yellow uniform commented solemnly.

He wasn’t wearing the outfit of the Qiao Clan. Moreover, most of the people here weren’t wearing the outfit of the Qiao Clan. Instead, they were from other families.

The old man that spoke was from the Wu Family. As for the others, they were from the other six families.

The Qiao Clan had gathered the other seven first-class forces.

In the field, there was a total of fifty Inborn experts! Although they weren’t releasing their aura, ordinary people would still feel suffocated in their presence.

“A twenty-year-old brat possesses such insane strength and influence. If one says he did not have any mysterious encounter, no one would believe. Regardless, we will know tomorrow!”

Laozu revealed a faint smirk and continued, “They must be courting death to kill the disciples of my Qiao Clan and challenge two Saint-class forces at the same time.”

“That’s right. That Dragon King is too full of himself. With the Qiao Clan and the Supreme Elders from the Medical Saint Sect tomorrow, annihilating a Dragon Sect will be a walk in the park!” Below the stage, the sect leaders from various sects chuckled.

Initially, the sudden appearance of the Sacred Sect, Dragon Sect, had made them feel hopeless.

They had offended a Sacred Clan. Moreover, it was a terrifying existence with fifty Inborn experts. If the Dragon Sect wanted to take revenge on these first-class forces, it would be a simple task.

However, that brazen Dragon King announced he wanted to kill all of them, including the Medical Saint Sect and the Qiao Clan. He even added that on the day of the pilgrimage, he would be awaiting their arrival.

Absolute arrogance!

Looking at the Laozu and the powerful disciples of the Qiao Clan, they were relieved and excited.

There were already fifty Inborn experts gathered here. Moreover, they had existences that were above the Inborn Realm.

Although the fifty of them might not be a match for the fifty Inborn experts from the Dragon Sect, they still had Medical Saint Sect with them.

The Qiao Clan had clearly contacted the Medical Saint Sect but they had no idea of the exact strength of the Medical Saint Sect.

Nonetheless, they were certain that the Medical Saint Sect would be stronger than the Qiao Clan.

With their fifty Inborn experts together with thirty to forty Inborn experts from the Medical Saint Sect, the Dragon Sect would still be slaughtered even if they had hidden their full strength.

Furthermore, they clearly had more experts that were above the Inborn Realm.

The Dragon Sect must be annihilated and the Dragon King must die!

Everyone was feeling extremely confident.

Today, countless martial artists from the Underworld headed towards Rivertown. They came to the beach enthusiastically and looked at the island a long distance away.

“There! The Dragon King will be holding his pilgrimage on that island!”

“It’s too far. We can only wait for the outcome here.”

“It will only begin tomorrow. We have to come early the next day!”

“There are some people who have started a thread on the Underworld forum. The Wu Family and the other seven forces have gone to the Qiao Clan. The battle of the ages is about to start!”

Some martial artists were discussing.

More and more martial artists arrived at Rivertown. Almost everyone in the Underworld had their attention focused on this place.

Focus on the pilgrimage of the Dragon Sect!

“Is everything in order?” Wang Xian arrived at the floating island and asked Mo Qinglong with a smile.

“It shouldn’t be a problem to hold five thousand people,” answered Mo Qingling with a smile.

Hmm!

Wang Xian saw the decorations of the floating island. It was prepared for two days later.

As for welcoming the Medical Saint Sect, Qiao Clan and the other forces, it would be on the other island beside it. That would be their burial site!

Two ordinary Inborn experts wouldn’t be a match for a single dragonian. Moreover, he had Xiao Yu, Elder Fang, Sun Lingxiu and the girls with him. The crux was Lan Qingyue!

Wang Xian smiled to himself and wasn’t worried about the huge battle that would be happening the next day.

Even if they had even stronger experts, he would still be around. The Dragon King of the Dragon Sect!

Standing on the training field built on the floating island, Wang Xian looked to the boundless sea. From him, an aura of invincibility was emitted.

This aura was even above the Dan Realm.

Rivertown was a place with frequent rain. The next morning, the sky was overcast. At about eight in the morning, ominous clouds had gathered and rain seemed imminent.

However, crowds of martial artists had been gathered at the beach of Rivertown since early in the morning. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Are the Medical Saint Sect, Qiao Clan and the other forces here?”

“I don’t know. However, since the Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan have made their statements, they will definitely be here today!”

“This is too darned exhilarating. Life and death battle of the Sacred Sects! The loser will probably be erased from the Underworld!”

“News from Nanjing yesterday reported that the twenty-odd Inborn experts from the seven forces have gone to the Qiao Clan. Wu Family and the other forces have mobilized all they could gather!”

“The Wu Family and the other forces can’t be passive in this. If they can’t annihilate the Dragon Sect today, they will be annihilated in the future!”

“The seven forces are mobilizing twenty-odd Inborn experts. Together with those from the Qiao Clan and Medical Saint Sect, won’t the number of Inborn experts reach seventy or even eighty?”

“The strength of the Dragon Sect is too far from the strength of Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan!”

“They are here! Those are the people from the Qiao Clan! They are here!”

At this juncture, a light drizzle started to fall. A group of people was approaching the island with a vengeance.

They had eight hundred or so people. A crude and rowdy old man was leading the group and he was wearing the outfit of the Qiao Clan. From him, one could feel his imposing will without him getting angry.

Behind the old man, all the experts from the Qiao Clan were following, and they had faint smiles on their faces.

The Wu Family and the other forces stood to the left and right of the Qiao Clan.

A strong aura swept forward. Even though they had not released their aura, the terrifying demeanor still shocked those who had gathered at the beach as they quickly moved aside and opened up a lane.

“Sss. That’s Qiao Longchuan from the Qiao Clan, a Half-Step to Dan Realm expert. If he’s standing behind the old man, that old man must be the Laozu of the Qiao Clan!”

“Indeed! Even the Laozu of the Qiao Clan is here. The vibes from this group of people are too terrifying. Even when I’m several thousand meters away from them, I can still feel a faint pressure!”

“The weakest among them are Level 8 martial artists. In fact, almost everyone at the front is an Inborn expert!”

“About fifty Inborn experts. This... Just considering the strength of Qiao Clan and the other seven forces, they have already gathered fifty Inborn experts. That’s the same as the strength of the Dragon Sect!”

The crowd looked at Qiao Clan and the other seven forces in shock.

Just the Qiao Clan and the other seven forces had gathered fifty Inborn experts. Moreover, they were led by the Laozu of the Qiao Clan.

If they considered the even stronger Medical Saint Sect, wouldn’t it be...!

“The Dragon King of the Dragon Sect is too arrogant. The Dragon Sect will definitely be annihilated this time!”

“A meteoric rise will eventually end in a gruesome way because of his arrogance!”
