Chapter 40: Taking Over the First-Grade Restaurant (1)

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

The atmosphere was a little heavy within the private lounge of the First-grade Restaurant.

Guan Shuqing felt a little awkward while sitting there and eating.

At this point, she could already sense the animosity Director Zhou and the surrounding colleagues had towards Wang Xian.

He could also sense that Director Zhou had other thoughts about her.

This made her unable to help feeling remorseful for not rejecting the invitation to today’s gathering.

Bzz Bzz.

At this moment, Director Zhou’s phone rang. He took out his phone and looked at it. “It’s a phone call from the manager here. It should be about sending the food over.”

He smiled and accepted the call after explaining.

“What? No more? Not a single bit is left?” When Director Zhou received the call, he asked in shock.

“I’m really sorry, Director Zhou. We don’t have any caviar left in First-grade Seafood Restaurant as they have been ordered by some distinguished customer,” Manager Huang explained over the phone. “I will definitely reserve a serving for Director Zhou for your next visit!”

“Forget it then. If it’s sold out, so be it!” Director Zhou shook his head slightly and hung up the phone.

“We probably won’t get the chance this time. Manager Huang said that all the caviar has sold out.”

He shrugged his shoulders and said to Guan Shuqing, “This time we didn’t get it, next time I’ll bring you along to get some.”

Guan Shuqing smiled and didn’t reply as she didn’t know how to.

Bzz Bzz.

At this moment, Wang Xian’s phone also rang. He took out his phone and saw a phone call from Director Li. He accepted it immediately.

“Brother Wang Xian, which private lounge number are you in?”

“203. Is there anything Director Li has for me?”

“Oh, nothing! I’ll just come and disturb you for a moment.”

Just as Director Li finished his sentence, someone knocked on the door of the private lounge. Following which, the waitress opened the door.

“Sorry for the interruption, Brother Wang Xian. I’m here to serve you a speciality delicacy of our restaurant.”

Director Li stood at the entrance of the door as he smiled and spoke to Wang Xian.

Behind him was Manager Huang with the plates in his hand. As they walked in, Manager Huang looked towards Wang Xian and put on a radiant smile.

“Director Wang, this is the speciality caviar of our restaurant. There are five servings in the kitchen and I have brought all of them here for you and your guests. Director Wang, you can call me Xiao Huang. I’m the manager of First-grade Seafood Restaurant currently.” [1]

The middle-aged Manager Huang kept a very low profile. He carried the plates and placed the servings of caviar on the table in front of Wang Xian.

Wang Xian was slightly shocked but quickly smiled and nodded his head. He looked at Director Li and said, “Thank you for your kind intentions, Director Li.”

“Please enjoy yourself, brother Wang Xian. I shall not be interrupting you any further.” Director Li smiled at him.

“Thank you.” Wang Xian nodded his head.

“Director Wang, please enjoy yourself. Feel free to ask for me if there’s anything.”

Manager Huang bowed down. From the very beginning to the end, he didn’t look at others and had his attention fixed on Wang Xian.

Even as he left, he lowered his stance before turning around and walking out of the room.

Director Zhou was dumbfounded and his eyes were opened widely. Just as he was about to say something, he noted that Manager Huang had not even looked over at all during the whole process. Suddenly, he felt a little embarrassed.

As for the other young men and women, they were also shocked by what they had just seen.

What’s the situation?

Who were those two people previously?

That guy who served the caviar said that he is the manager of this place and Wang Xian could just call him Xiao Huang? Is he the same Manager Huang that Director Zhou had mentioned?

They quickly turned their heads over and looked at Wang Xian.

They saw five bowls of caviar beside him with each serving costing $4,000 and a total of $20,000.

Moreover, this was something that even money might not be able to get.

Even their Director Zhou had failed to order any despite giving Manager Huang a call.

Yet, the manager sent over five bowls with profound reverence.

This...

How can this be possible? Isn’t he just a student?

Guan Shuqing, who was just beside Wang Xian, also looked at him with astonishment. She noticed that she had more and more things that she couldn’t understand about him.

He was a poor student that had to work part-time frequently to earn his school fees and living expenses in the past.

Currently, he rode a heavy-duty motorcycle and the clothes he wore weren’t cheap either.

However, this wasn’t the most surprising thing to her. What really shocked her was the manager’s attitude previously and the free food that was worth $20,000.

“Wang Xian... You... You...” Guan Shuqing looked at Wang Xian and had a huge basket of questions to ask him. However, she did not know where to start asking.

“Let’s eat. Let’s see how the limited caviar of First-grade Seafood Restaurant will taste.” Wang Xian smiled and passed over a bowl to her.

“Wang Xian... This... Why would the manager of this place bring these over...” Guan Shuqing looked at the caviar Wang Xian placed in front of her and asked blankly.

“I bought this place.” Wang Xian looked at her and continued, “Director Li, who came in previously, is the previous owner of First-grade Seafood Restaurant. We have reached a preliminary agreement and I’ll be the boss of First-grade Seafood Restaurant at this time tomorrow. Therefore...”

Wang Xian smiled. As for Guan Shuqing, she was staring at Wang Xian with her eyes opened widely and filled with surprise.

“First-grade Seafood Restaurant... You bought it?” She asked again in disbelief.

“Yeah!” Wang Xian smiled and nodded his head. “If you have something you would like to eat in the future, you can look for me. I’ll just treat you to it.”

“This...” Guan Shuqing was a little dumbfounded.

“How can this be possible?”

At this point, a young man sitting by the side couldn’t contain his surprise and showed his disbelief.

This student sitting right here bought First-grade Seafood Restaurant? This is First-grade Seafood Restaurant! How much will he need?

$10 million or $20 million?

This is First-grade Seafood Restaurant! How can anyone buy this place with just $10 million?

The other young men and women around also showed their disbelief.

They recalled what they had said to him previously: I’m afraid you might not have the chance to try it again after this. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Thinking back now, they felt a surge of heat over their face. This was a tight slap to their faces!

Not only could he try it again, he even bought the whole restaurant.

Their attention turned slowly to Director Zhou ad they realized that Director Zhou’s expression was even more dramatic.

His face was twitching constantly and his body was trembling slightly as he looked to Wang Xian.

Playing a sucker and acting poor? What an obnoxious person!

Director Zhou stared at Wang Xian and had various phrases surfacing in his mind. He gritted his teeth tightly.

To be able to buy First-grade Seafood Restaurant, he definitely had several dozens of millions in assets. As for his family, they only had $50-$60 million in assets.

Moreover, these were all under his father.

Wang Xian glanced faintly at Director Zhou before saying directly to Guan Shuqing, “I’ll be taking over this place tomorrow. I wouldn’t make changes to the manpower of this place but I might need a reliable person to manage the accounts of this place. I couldn’t possibly be cooping myself up in this place. Will you come and help me out?”

“I... I...” When Guan Shuqing heard his words, her eyes flickered. She glanced at Director Zhou beside her and remarked, “But I’ve already...”

However when she looked at Wang Xian once again, she still nodded her head in hesitation. “Alright, since you have asked, how could I reject your invitation?”

“Hehe, great. With you helping me out, I’ll be saving myself a lot of trouble.”

Wang Xian smiled.

As for Director Zhou who was just beside her, his eyebrows twitched violently and he clenched his fist tightly upon seeing Guan Shuqing being poached away right in front of him.

However, he couldn’t just flare up. This young man in front of him was able to buy First-grade Seafood Restaurant directly. He might have a strong backing.

Damn his answer of having only a sister! Who is he trying to fool!

[1] Literal translation of “Xiao” is little. Manager Huang added “Xiao” to his surname to make Wang Xian feel less distant to him. At the same time, it’s to show deference to someone more senior or with more authority.
