Translator: 549690339

From the sacred literature field to the tree of chaos, there was a teleportation array set up by the 12 ancestral magi.

After a year of preparation, a group of powerful disciples from the peak races were about to step into the domain of the tree of Chaos! “All powerful disciples, start the teleportation!”

A voice sounded in the sky above the sacred literature field.

Following that, the powerful disciples in the sacred literature field stepped into the teleportation array with faces full of anticipation!

“Buzz Buzz Buzz! ”

“Buzz Buzz Buzz! ”

One figure after another began to disappear quickly!

After the last disciple was teleported, there were only three peak-stage rulers guarding the teleportation array in the sacred literature field!

The other hundreds of millions of powerful disciples had all entered!

“The tree of Chaos is a treasure land, and it will be of great benefit to us.

However, the luckiest ones this time are the water-elemental cultivators. The eight Heavenly Fate Masters said that in the last two billion years, it would be best to cultivate a water-elemental heavenly fate. Unfortunately, we are not water-elemental! ”

At the teleportation array, when all the experts and disciples entered the teleportation array.

An elder from the saint’s side said indifferently!

“The Water Phoenix King of the Phoenix race, the Floating Water Queen of the immortal nation, and the scholars from your saint’s side. The three of them have the best chance of entering the Heavenly Yuan creation realm. ”

At the side, an expert from the black tortoise race who was at the peak of the ruler realm said!

“That’s true. Many people are envious of the position that the Divine Dragon tribe has vacated. ”

The elder from the Saint tribe nodded. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

As soon as he finished speaking, the three peak-stage rulers looked toward the right.

The peak-stage ruler of the Saint tribe waved his arm, and an image appeared in his line of sight!

The three experts narrowed their eyes when they saw the image.

“The Dragon Palace is here. It’s so fast. There are seven or eight million experts from the Dragon Palace, right? All of them are at least at the supreme-being level. This number is terrifying!”

“There are at least 200,000 to 300,000 at the supreme-being level and above! ” A great elf at the peak-stage ruler realm from the Elf clan said.

“The number of experts is terrifying. The Dragon Palace is developing too quickly. It seems that the Divine Dragon Clan made many arrangements before their fall. ”

The elder from the saint’s side exclaimed.

The number of venerables and ruler realm experts was already more than the saint’s side.

Was this the foundation of the Divine Dragon Clan?

Even if the Divine Dragon clan fell, they still rose up in such a short period of time.

They still gave birth to so many powerhouses in such a short period of time.

One had to know that the Saint Clan had developed for more than 20 billion years.

20 billion years was not as good as the development of the Dragon Palace for hundreds of millions of years.

Of course, leaving aside the top-level battle strength of the rulers!

“Yes, this speed of development is really terrifying. Unfortunately, the Dragon

King of the Dragon Palace is too arrogant. He shouldn’t have offended the

Phoenix clan and the Angel clan like this. ”

“He lost a heavenly Yuan blessed realm expert and offended the two peak races of the Phoenix and Angel clan so badly. It will be difficult for the Divine Dragon Clan to return to its peak in the future. At the very least, the Dragon Palace will lose the Lord of the Heavenly Yuan blessed realm in the future! ”

The Black Tortoise clan’s peak ruler said!

The Great Elf beside him also shook his head.

The Elf clan could not help with this matter!

After all, the Elf clan could not be enemies with the Phoenix clan’s Angel clan!

The three peak ruler realm experts were talking.

Soon, the figure of the Dragon Palace appeared in their line of sight!

“Roar! Roar! ”

The three peak-level rulers looked over and were shocked.

“Peak-level dragon species, so many peak-level dragon species. There are more of them than when the Divine Dragon clan was at their peak, right?”

“In addition, there are more than 90,000 pure-blooded divine dragons, and there are a few mutated divine dragons among them! ”

The Big Elf of the Elf clan said in slight shock!

Although the Elf clan had a good relationship with the Dragon Palace, it was his first time seeing all the forces of the Dragon Palace.

The number of peak-level dragon species and mutated divine dragons shocked them!

“It seems that the Divine Dragon Clan received some benefits from the insect clan before they perished! ”

The Black Tortoise clan’s powerhouse mumbled!

“What a pity! ”

The elder from the saint lineage shook his head, his gaze landed on Wang Xian. “Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, right? You should head straight to the tree of chaos through the teleportation formation. When you reach there, the Lord of Heaven’s origin will carry out some judgment on all of you! ”

“Oh? Hehe!”

Wang Xian was sitting on the dragon throne in front of them! He smiled when he heard the voices coming from below.

“Alright! ”

Wang Xian didn’t say anything else. The nine divine dragons carried him and flew towards the teleportation formation!

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

When they arrived at the teleportation formation, the teleportation formation was activated!

“Let’s go inside. That’s the tree of Chaos.” The Great Elves spoke to Wang Xian and the rest!

“Alright! ”

Wang Xian nodded his head and gestured to the group of Divine Dragons!

Buzz! Buzz

Roar! Roar

They let out a low roar and entered the teleportation formation!

Under the guidance of the three masters at the peak of the Dominator realm, they entered the teleportation formation!

In the next instant, the scene before them changed!

A majestic energy was transmitted over!

Wang Xian sensed this vast energy and revealed a surprised expression!

This energy was comparable to a top-notch grotto-heaven blessed land!

The Heaven’s origin creation in the nine-origin universe must have brought a large number of powerhouses here because the energy here was more abundant.

Under such circumstances, if one cultivated here for more than two billion years until the arrival of the catastrophe,.

One would definitely be able to increase the strength of the nine-origin universe by a huge margin!

“This tree is truly enormous. It’s simply boundless. Is this the towering tree that lives in the primal chaos?”

“What terrifying energy. If I can cultivate here for tens of millions of years, I’ll definitely be able to break through. If I can cultivate here for a billion years, I might be able to step into the peak ruler realm! ”

“Are there any other treasures here?”

At this moment, exclamations could be heard from the front.

A group of 9-origin universe great disciples, who had just entered, were looking around in shock.

This place was like a new world!

However, at this moment, some of the great disciples felt the power coming from behind them, and they were slightly shocked.

They immediately looked toward the teleportation array!

“The Dragon Palace is coming! ” “The Dragon King is coming! “
