“Ring, Ring, Ring!”

Wang Xian, who was standing in the middle of the Dragon Palace, scanned his surroundings. Suddenly, he heard a beautiful voice.

This voice was transmitted directly to the depths of his heart, causing him to feel an involuntary sense of happiness.

Wang Xian was slightly stunned. He stood there and listened to the voice slowly. Suddenly, he felt as though his mind had been brought into it.

Wang Xian was alert and immediately came out from this state.

“What is this? How can it infect a person’s mind so easily?”

Wang Xian had a look of astonishment on his face. At this moment, he realized that they were in front of a mountain peak not far away.

Hundreds of dolphins were lying there and making the same sound in their bodies at the same time.

Although it was not as amusing as the sound that came from the Dragon King’s Palace, the sound could still stir up people’s emotions.

“Dragon King, this is the special energy of Miss Tang Yinxuan and the Dolphins. They are able to attack with their voices, and they are also able to stir up emotions with their voices. It’s a very powerful technique!”

At this moment, Prime Minister Gui came to Wang Xian’s side and explained to him.

“No Wonder!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. No wonder Xiao Yu, Lan Qingyue, and the rest weren’t excited or happy when he entered. Instead, they asked him not to speak.

He shook his head speechlessly.

“The energy of these dolphins has a very good effect. The water tribe can not calm down. After hearing the sounds of the Dolphins, they can enter the training quickly. Miss Tang Yinxuan can even guide them to cultivate with her voice!”

Prime Minister Gui continued.

“It’s so magical?”

Wang Xian was astonished.

“Yes, Dragon King. Miss Tang Yinxuan saved our lives. Now, she is of great use to the development of the Water Tribe of the Dragon Palace. I suggest that you leave her in the Dragon Palace!”

Prime Minister Gui suggested.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded. “Go and organize the water tribe for a second sermon. Also, the effect of the star induction plate can only last for a year. Let all the members of the Dragon Palace cultivate in seclusion for a year!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister GUI nodded and went to organize the sermon immediately.

Wang Xian moved and came to the bedroom of the Dragon Palace. When he saw the six girls who were chattering, he smiled.

“Brother!”

Xiao Yu walked over and hugged his shoulder with a smile.

“You’re awake. Thank you for your reminder last time!”

Wang Xian patted Xiao Yu’s head and looked at Tang Yinxuan.

“No Need!”

Tang Yinxuan smiled faintly.

“Have you settled everything?”

Lan Qingyue walked to Wang Xian’s side and asked him.

“Everything is settled. I obtained a treasure outside and I’m cultivating in the Dragon Palace. The effect is only slightly worse than the spiritual energy waterfall. It can last for a year. If you guys don’t take care of things, I’m prepared to cultivate in seclusion in the Dragon Palace for a year!”

Wang Xian said to them.

“Cultivate in seclusion for a year?”

Lan Qingyue and the rest nodded slowly. “Sure, Xiao Xian. Great changes are happening in the Huaxia World Now. The arrival of the Nine Cauldrons world will have a huge impact on the real world!”

“HMM, it will probably be chaotic for a period of time. It has nothing to do with US anyway. Let’s just focus on our cultivation!”

Wang Xian smiled and went to the dragon throne with Lan Qingyue and the rest. He looked at Guan Shuqing who was still unconscious.

“Xiao Xian, yinxuan said that there might be some problems with Shuqing’s soul. Her soul is too weak to support her when she wakes up. We can find some spiritual herbs and elixirs that can strengthen her soul to help her wake up quickly. Another option is to wait for a long time and see if her soul can repair and grow on its own.”

Sun Lingxiu looked at Guan Shuqing’s body and said to Wang Xian.

“Yes, we’ll wait for another year. If she doesn’t wake up in a year, we’ll bring her to seek medical treatment!”

Wang Xian nodded slowly.

“Alright, we’ll cultivate here. I don’t know if we’ll be able to step into the immortal realm in a year’s time!”

Lan Qingyue and the rest said with a smile.

“I’ll organize a sermon soon. I’ll start cultivating after the sermon!”

Wang Xian said.

After resting for half a day in the Dragon Palace, Prime Minister Gui informed Wang Xian that all the water tribe members had arrived.

Wang Xian walked out of the bedroom and scanned his surroundings. He looked at the billions of water tribe members.

Compared to the last time, these water tribe members seemed to be more agile, powerful, and ferocious.

They exuded a spirituality.

However, when they saw Wang Xian coming out, all of them were extremely docile in an instant. They looked at him in the sky devoutly.

Wang Xian transformed into a divine dragon and began his second sermon.

The cultivation method and cultivation technique entered the minds of billions of water tribe members directly.

At the location of the Dragon King’s Palace, six girls were looking at his figure with admiration.

The sermon lasted for two hours. After that, Wang Xian returned to the Dragon Palace and began his closed-door cultivation.

Lan qingyue, Xiao Yu, and the rest of the girls also began their closed-door cultivation.

A heaven-defying cultivation-supporting treasure like the star guiding disc could not be wasted.

The entire Dragon Palace fell into silence. In the Dragon King’s Palace, Wang Xian and the six beauties were cultivating. In other places, all the members of the Dragon Palace were cultivating.

Even Prime Minister Gui and Ao Jian.

The nine Hui were entrenched in the Dragon Cave. With the help of the star guiding disc, they might be able to advance to level-13 in one to two years.

At that time, the Dragon Palace would have nine more immortals. Even in the world of the nine cauldrons, they would be able to occupy a place. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

In addition, the matter of stealing the dragon vein had been arranged before they went into closed-door cultivation.

Time passed slowly, and the whole world underwent great changes.

Two months later, the Nine Cauldrons World appeared, and countless warriors of the Nine Cauldrons World entered the jianghu.

The immortal sects ruled the world, and the twenty immortal sects stood on top of the jianghu, raising the power of the jianghu to a terrifying level.

The jianghu was in constant strife, and there was a battle between the immortal sects and the immortal sects.

The collision between geniuses and geniuses.

The impact between the real world and the Nine Cauldrons World.

The combination of martial arts and reality.

Everything was going on, and even the battle between the Immortals and gods had broken out. The Sky and Earth were dark, and the sun and Moon were dim.

All of this had nothing to do with the Dragon Palace, which was far away from the conflict.

Time passed very quickly. There was no sun or moon in cultivation. A year passed in the blink of an eye.

“Brother, are we going out?”

A year later, when the energy of the star ushers dissipated, Xiao Yu hugged Wang Xian’s arm excitedly and asked.

“It’s time to go out and take a look. Qingyue, Lingxiu, yinxuan, Qinglan, are you guys going out?”

Qinglan was elder fan’s name. His original name was Fan Qinglan.

“It’s time to go home and take a look!”

Lan Qingyue and the rest nodded their heads.

“Alright, let’s go then.”

Wang Xian smiled and looked to the side. “Ao Yao!”

“I’m Here!”

Ao Yao’s figure instantly left the Dragon King’s palace.

“Call 16 infant stage strange demons to follow me out. You Follow Me Out Too!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao nodded.

“Devil Azure Dragon!” 1

“I’m Here!”

“Call all the members of the Dragon Gate. Let’s go out!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”
