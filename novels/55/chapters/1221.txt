Chapter 1222: 1223 dragon and Phoenix grocery store

Translator: 5496903

A cold voice came out of his mouth, causing the faces of the fat young man and the rest to turn cold instantly.

“Kid, this is our organ restaurant, in the territory of our nine stars dynasty. If you don’t pay the safety fee, you can forget about opening this store. In fact, you might even be robbed!”

The old man beside the fat young man stared at Wang Xian coldly and threatened him faintly.

“Why are you still talking nonsense with him? How dare he act so arrogantly in our shop? Tear down his entire shop!”

The fat young man stared at Wang Xian ferociously and shouted loudly.

“Haha, I agree with this. Since they don’t give face to the organ restaurant, then tear it down this time. The Things Here...”

A young man beside him laughed out loud and squinted his eyes in agreement. A greedy look appeared in his eyes.

“This is the shop that I bought. Do I still need to pay a safety fee like you guys? I finally understand that you guys are a bunch of self-righteous bandits!”

Wang Xian stood up slowly. A faint killing intent surged from his body. “The nine stars dynasty? Hehe, since you guys don’t want to get lost, I can only send you guys away!”

As he spoke, two terrifying elemental energies condensed in his palms.

“You brought this upon yourself!”

When the old man saw the energy in Wang Xian’s hands, a killing intent surged from his body. A large saber appeared in his hands.

“Kill him!”

The Fat Young Man’s face, which was filled with muscles, appeared a little ferocious. He growled at the old man beside him.

“HMPH, you’re courting death!”

The energy in Wang Xian’s hands didn’t hesitate at all.

The combined combat technique, Jin Liu, was sent straight at the old man.

“Slash!”

The old man’s saber glow was amplified as he slashed directly at Jin Liu!

“Not good!”

However, when the saber in his hand landed on Jin Liu, the level nine extraordinary saber in the old man’s hand actually broke apart.

This caused him to be filled with extreme fear.

“Retreat, Little Prince, retreat immediately!”

Without any hesitation, his body trembled as a circular energy armor floated around him.

The first-tier profound void tier armor that he had spent half his life savings on exploded. He pulled the fat young man’s body and directly fled outside.

The other five young men and women were slightly stunned. Shock appeared on their faces, and they fled outside in fear.

The old man was the shopkeeper of the organ restaurant. He had the strength of a half-step profound void tier expert. However, he knew that he was no match for the other party with just one strike.

One could imagine that the young man’s strength was not something that they could deal with.

Wang Xian saw that they had escaped from the shop. He frowned slightly and did not chase after them.

He waved his arm and the golden flow dissipated immediately.

In the shop, he did not dare to release too much strength. Otherwise, the entire shop would not be able to withstand it.

“I hope that all of you know your limits. If you still dare to come, don’t blame me for being impolite!”

A cold glint flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes as he looked at the spirit purple qilin and the blood evil turtle behind him.

“Zi Ling, blood evil, lie on the left and right side of the door. If anyone dares to cause trouble, kill them immediately!”

Wang Xian ordered the two beasts that were lying in the innermost part of the door.

“Roar Roar!”

The two beasts let out a low roar and immediately came to the two sides of the door.

As long as they entered the door, they would be able to see the two big fellows standing on both sides.

If there were any troublemakers, they would have to go through the Ling Zilin and the vicious turtle first.

“This tomb of the humans and demons is really chaotic!”

Wang Xian sighed slightly. It was extremely chaotic in the battlefield of the tomb of the humans and demons. It was also extremely chaotic in the place where the humans gathered.

There was no order to speak of. There were only forces holding down the forces one by one, forming a chaotic region.

“I have to increase my strength as soon as possible!”

He thought to himself. As long as his strength increased by one level, he would be able to fight or even kill a powerhouse at the second level of the Seethrough Void Tier.

Buzz

At this moment, a terrifying energy attacked the dragon and Phoenix grocery store.

Wang Xian, who was sitting in the store, had a slight change in expression.

“Roar!”

The blood evil turtle, who was lying by the door, raised its head. A violent aura was revealed in its eyes.

Its cumbersome turtle shell moved slightly and an earthy yellow energy surrounded the entire store.

“Boom!”

The terrifying sound of an explosion was heard. Wang Xian could clearly feel that the entire store was trembling.

If not for the blood evil Turtle’s defense, the entire store would have been turned into ruins.

Wang Xian moved and appeared at the entrance. He looked at the sky coldly.

“Damn you, come and face your death!”

In the sky, more than 20 people were floating in front of the shop. An old man was standing in the middle.

The Fat Young Man was standing at the side. His fat face was staring at him coldly.

The old man from earlier was standing at the other side.

Wang Xian looked at the old man in the middle. His eyes were filled with killing intent as he slowly swept his gaze across the chubby young man and the rest.

“I spared your dog lives just now. Don’t even think about it this time!”

“Shut up, you yellow-mouthed brat. How dare you attack the people of my nine stars Empire? Who gave you the guts? !”

The old man in the middle didn’t make a move again. He took a deep look at the shop and sized up Wang Xian.

In the tomb of the demi-human, there were as many experts as the clouds and as many as the rain. Even an expert of the Seethrough void couldn’t be arrogant here.

The strength of the nine-star dynasty wasn’t weak, but it wasn’t too strong either. Many dynasties and sects with deep foundations were stronger than them.

After his attack was easily blocked, he became cautious.

This shop might not be simple.

“Uncle Qin, kill this reckless brat and let them know the consequences of provoking our nine stars Empire!”

Before Wang Xian could speak, the fat young man’s voice filled with killing intent was heard.

“Yes, General Qin. Kill him and tear down his shop!”

“We must not let him off!”

A few other young men beside him echoed.

When the old man heard the voices of the family disciples beside him, he frowned slightly and stared coldly at Wang Xian.

“I’m opening a shop here, yet the trash from your nine stars Empire still wants to collect safety fees. What a joke!”

Wang Xian stood in front of the shop and raised his head slightly. Killing intent surged in his heart.

“Eh? What’s going on? Is there a commotion again?”

“The people from the nine-star dynasty and the people from that shop seem to be from the nine-star dynasty who went to that young man to collect protection fees. In the end, they were beaten up!”

“What kind of background does this kid have? How dare he go against the nine-star Dynasty?”

“If he wants to open a shop in the graveyard of demi-humans without the ability, he can only seek protection from the powerful ones. Otherwise, he would be easily robbed. This young man is obviously in the same situation!”

Around the streets, there were at least tens of thousands of people looking over. All of them were smiling as they watched the commotion.

Such a situation would be discovered after staying in the cemetery of demi-humans for a long time. It was not strange at all.

“Looks like this kid is going to be done for. What an unlucky kid!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Some of them looked at the insightful emptiness realm expert in the sky and then looked at Wang Xian who was alone below. They shook their heads slightly.
