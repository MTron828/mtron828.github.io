Chapter 1468: The destruction of 1468 second-rate force 2

“The three elders of the Sky High Sword sect!”

“The sky high sword sect actually came out. That woman has already been accepted as a disciple by Elder Qi!”

“That woman is a disciple of the sky high sword sect. The Sky High Sword sect can’t possibly watch her be killed!”

When elder Qi’s voice sounded, everyone’s faces were filled with astonishment.

“Elders!”

“Elders!”

However, very quickly, all the surrounding aristocratic families hurriedly greeted the three elders of the towering sky sword sect respectfully.

“En!”

The three elders of the towering sky sword sect slowly nodded their heads and looked at Ren Xingchen.

“Elder Qi!”

Song Wan saw Elder Qi and the group of elders and experts of the towering sky sword sect coming over. Her face revealed an excited expression as she hurriedly shouted.

Elder Qi glanced at her and slowly nodded his head. His gaze continued to look at Ren Xingchen.

“You want to stop me from taking revenge?”

Ren Xingchen’s expression changed slightly when he saw the group of experts flying over. He stared at them with a dark expression.

“This little brother is taking revenge. Naturally, we won’t stop you. May I ask if little brother has joined any other factions?”

Elder Qi asked Ren Xingchen with a smile.

“What? What does the towering sky sword sect mean?”

“They want to recruit this young man!”

“F * ck! If this young man really joins the towering sky sword sect and he exterminates the Wu clan today, he will definitely be famous everywhere!”

When the surrounding people heard elder Qi’s words, they were shocked and stared at Ren Xingchen.

“I have a sect!”

Ren Xingchen hesitated for a moment and said expressionlessly.

“A sect!”

His words caused the three elders of the towering sky sword sect to frown slightly and feel a little disappointed.

“I wonder what kind of sect is able to nurture such an outstanding disciple. It must be one of the big forces in the vast region!”

An elder beside him slowly asked.

“It’s not convenient to tell!”

Ren Xingchen looked at them, furrowing his brows without leaving a trace.

“You... didn’t you escape to the Flowing Sea Region? Why did you join a large faction!”

At the side, when Song Wan heard his words, her expression fluctuated as she loudly shouted.

“It has nothing to do with a dying person like you!”

When Ren Xingchen heard her shout, his eyes were filled with killing intent as he roared.

“Flowing sea region?”

However, Song Wan’s words caused the sky high sword sect and the surrounding aristocratic families to be slightly stunned.

“Flowing sea region, that tiny place? It seems like the sixth level of the profound void tier is the strongest there. Is this little brother joining the forces in flowing sea region?”

An Elder’s eyes revealed a glimmer as he asked with a smile.

Ren Xingchen glanced at them but didn’t say anything.

His silence made the three elders, who had lived for more than a thousand years, even more certain.

“Little brother, a small place is not a place for a heaven’s favorite like you. Staying there will only limit your advancement!”

“Why don’t you join our Atlas Sword Sect? At that time, with your talent, our sect master will personally guide you. How about it?”

Elder Qi said to Ren Xingchen with a smile on his face.

“No need. I Won’t betray my sect!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Ren Xingchen replied expressionlessly.

“Little brother, if you stay in the flowing sea region, it will be very difficult for you to reach the sixth or seventh level of the profound void tier in your lifetime. However, it will be different in the vast region!”

“You can swim freely in the vast sea, fly freely in the sky, and join the Atlas Sword sect. With the guidance of a seventh level of the profound void tier expert, this is your stage!”

The Patriarch of a nearby clan tried to persuade Ren Xingchen.

“Everyone, please don’t Stop Me from taking revenge!”

Ren Xingchen did not answer the patriarch. He raised the sharp sword in his hand again and said indifferently.

Seeing Ren Xingchen’s determined look, the three elders frowned slightly.

“Ren Xingchen, how dare you! Elder, elder Qi, I beg you, I beg you to Save Our Song clan!”

Song Wan saw Ren Xingchen raise the sharp sword in his hand and immediately knelt down towards elder Qi with a terrified expression on her face as she pleaded loudly.

All the people and powers in the surroundings looked over with flickering eyes.

“Little brother, Song Wan is a disciple of our towering sky sword sect. You Can’t kill her!”

“You’ve already killed the enemy of your clan. You’re not sure if the song clan is involved. Give our towering sky sword sect some face and let it go just like that!”

Elder Qi glanced around and said to Ren Xingchen calmly.

“See this? This is the benefit of joining the towering Sky Sword sect. Son, you must join!”

“The song family is really lucky. A daughter of the song family was accepted as a disciple by Elder Qi in advance, and now she has saved their entire family’s life!”

“The towering Sky Sword sect is famous for being protective of their disciples. This is also the reason why so many people are risking their lives to join the towering Sky Sword sect!”

When the surrounding aristocratic families heard elder Qi’s words, their faces were filled with smiles.

The reason why the towering Sky Sword sect was able to attract so many aristocratic families to join the sect was not only because they were relatively powerful.

There was also another reason for them to be protective of their disciples.

If you became a disciple of the Atlas Sword Sect, you would not have to fear anyone within a 1,000-kilometer radius.

Even if you made a mistake or even killed someone outside, only the Atlas Sword sect would be able to judge you. Even the local city Lord would not be qualified.

You would feel a sense of belonging when you entered!

Although the Atlas Sword sect had many arrogant and despotic disciples, this made many people yearn for it.

“You want to stop me from taking revenge?”

When Ren Xingchen heard her words, her face was slightly embarrassed.

“We only made a fair judgment!”

Elder Qi said indifferently.

“Judgment? My entire clan was exterminated, do I Need You to make a judgment?”

Ren Xingchen’s body was slightly trembling, and her face was somewhat malevolent as she asked.

“What’s wrong? Whatever our elders say, it’s the same!”

At this moment, a dignified-looking young man stood out from behind the three elders and stared coldly at Ren Xingchen.

As the eldest senior brother of the young generation of the towering Sky Sword sect, the most outstanding disciple, and a disciple that the sect had specially nurtured.

When he saw the three elders so politely recruiting a young man who was even more monstrous than him, his expression turned ugly.

If Ren Xingchen really joined the Atlas Sword sect, then his eldest senior brother’s position would be lost.

Fortunately, the other party did not agree.

Now it seemed that he actually dared to question the elders. He had long been displeased, so he directly stood out.

“Our elders see that you are a talent that can be molded, so we are so polite to talk to you. Do you really think that you are a peerless expert?”

He continued to speak to Ren Xingchen.

“Alright, Alright!”

Ren Xingchen saw the young man’s mockery. He held the longsword in his hand tightly and swept his gaze across the entire Qingtian Sword sect and the song clan with a gloomy expression.

“What? You still want to include our Qingtian Sword sect with such a strong killing intent?”

The young man saw Wang Xian’s gloomy expression and said mockingly.

“Phew, I will remember what happened today. There will be plenty of time in the future!”

Ren Xingchen took a deep breath, put his longsword back into its scabbard, and turned around to leave.

“Kid, Our Atlas Sword sect doesn’t like threats from others!”

At this moment, an elder’s cold voice came from behind!
