Chapter 299: Call Daddy! (1)

“Haha, this is nice. Shuqing, try this. This is not bad!”

“Sister-in-law, this is not bad either!”

“Master, have a try!”

Shang Jing, the richest city with the most robust foundation in the country had the most lively nightlife.

Wang Xian was left without a choice except watching the four of them buying snacks from various stalls non-stop. They looked happy as they chatted.

Yet, they drew attention from countless people along the way.

Four beauties who were the top-notch existences.

Xiao Yu, Lan Qingyue, Guan Shuqing, and Elder Fang were all Martial Artists with perfect figures.

The four of them were rather tall, and they gave off a unique vibe. Even in Shang Jing, a city never short of pretty babes, the four of them could easily overtake any one of them when they walked in a row.

“Let’s go shopping.”

When the four of them arrived at a renowned shopping center in Shang Jing, they went in with excitement.

Shopping and taking care of their own looks were women’s innate tendencies. Even the female Inborn Experts would not lose this born ability.

Finally, they unleashed their born ability by exhibiting an endless amount of energy in shopping.

Clothes, accessories, bags, one after another.

Soon, Wang Xian and Mo Qinglong were following behind with hands full of bags. They were like henchmen, tagging behind the four babes.

Wang Xian shook his head. Imagine him and Mo Qinglong being the dignified experts...and they were downgraded to people who carried shopping bags for others for now.

The four of them shopped til 11 pm before they finally had no choice but to stop. They even agreed to go to another shopping mall the next morning for more shopping.

Wang Xian, who was behind them, stumbled as he almost fell to the ground.

Not that he was feeling tired, but it was too boring for him.

He could not understand this kind of pleasure.

“Here, Xiao Xian. Wear this watch tomorrow. Men must have a watch of their own!”

Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue took out one thing that they bought for him as they spoke with beaming faces.

“Sure.”

Wang Xian took it over with a smile. The two of them had bought a nice and luxurious watch that cost over two million.

But he really had no love for the watch. You could imagine that he had to remove his clothes every time he transformed into a dragon. Now, he had another watch that hindered him.

If he forgot to take off his watch, that watch would be gone as soon as he transformed.

However, he could not turn them down.

“Let me find a hotel!”

Xiao Yu fished out her phone and searched for hotels.

The hotels in Shang Jing were quite popular. By this time, some of the hotels might have been fully booked.

The group went into three hotels before they found one on the street.

“Hur? This is the street with the famous pubs of Shang Jing!”

Xiao Yu was puzzled as she looked ahead. This street was the most lively place in Shang Jing during the night.

Women in sexy dresses with pretty and exquisite makeup were all over the street.

Sports cars were parked on each side of the road. The rich people in Shang Jing were far superior to those in Rivertown.

Not even ten Rivertowns could compare with one Shang Jing city.

“Let’s go back to our room and sleep!”

Xiao Yu swept a glance around and headed to the hotel ahead without much interest.

It was a five-star hotel which was also rather well-known.

Wang Xian and the gang walked in. As they neared the entrance, Xiao Yu suddenly came to a halt. She looked at the person who stepped out of the sports car with astonishment.

“Hur?” What’s wrong, Xiao Yu?” asked Wang Xian in surprise.

“She’s Ling Yi. Ling Yi!”

A reply that sounded surprised. Wang Xian was slightly stunned as he turned his attention over and saw a pretty girl. She was surrounded by another three young men and babes as they walked into the hotel.

“She’s really Ling Yi. I love her song, “Flying.” It’s motivating!”

Guan Shuqing and the girls spoke with amazement after they saw her.

“You shouldn’t be too surprised if you see some actors and singers. After all, the best art academy is situated here.”

Wang Xian smiled.

“I love her songs!” Xiao Yu smiled as she looked at the pretty girl.

Wang Xian chuckled as he nodded. “Are you going on a star hunt? Let’s go. We better get back to our room and sleep. It’s late!”

“Fine!”

Xiao Yu nodded, but she could not stop looking at that pretty girl with curiosity.

That singer, Ling Yi, also overheard Xiao Yu’s conversation. She exhibited a faint smile as she spoke while leaning on a young man affectionately.

“Two presidential suites!”

Mo Qinglong came to the reception and spoke to the front desk staff.

“I’m sorry, Sir. We’re only left with one presidential suite!”

“Just one? Then just nice. The girls can take the room. Hehe. Both of you can stay in standard rooms!”

Xiao Yu chuckled as she spoke to Wang Xian.

“Hmm, actually I think I can squeeze in!”

Wang Xian said with a slight contemplation.

“Fat chance!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Lan Qingyue and Guan Shuqing blushed as they spoke to him.

“One presidential suite and two suites!” Mo Qinglong told the front desk staff.

“Sure, Sir. That will be a total of $130,000!” the staff said with a smile. Mo Qinglong handed his card over immediately.

“No more presidential suite?”

Just then, a young man’s voice was heard.

“Sorry, Sir. The last one has just been booked,” the receptionist said with a smile.

“Oh, really?” The young man raised his eyebrow as he pulled out a card and placed it on the reception counter. “The diamond membership card of your hotel. The diamond members have priority over others when the room is booked at the same time!”

The young man spoke indifferently as he smiled at the people beside him.

Wang Xian and the gang were stunned as they spun around and looked at the young man.

He was around thirty years old. Beside him was the pretty singer, Ling Yi, whom Xiao Yu had mentioned just now. They were the people who had come into the hotel at the same time as them.

“This...” The front desk staff was placed in a difficult position. Apologetically, she said to the young man, “Sorry, Sir. I have already swiped their card. So, I’m really sorry!”

“Hur?” That young man was taken aback with a grumpy look on his face.

“Babes, can you let us have your room? I can agree to some of your requests, such as autographs and taking photographs.”

Ling Yi knit her eyebrows slightly as she peered at Xiao Yu, Guan Shuqing and the rest.

Xiao Yu also frowned. She looked at Guan Shuqing and shook her head slowly. “I’m sorry, Ling Yi. We have already booked our room.”

Ling Yi was slightly caught by surprise as bewilderment flashed in her eyes.

“I can pay for your room as long as you let us have this one!”

The young man by the side continued to speak.

“Sorry!” Guan Shuqing and the girls shook their heads at the side.
