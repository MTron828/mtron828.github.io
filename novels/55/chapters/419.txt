Chapter 420: Don’t Oppress Me Just Because I’m Young (1)

“Xiao Ran, kill all of them!”

Wang Xian contorted his lips upwards and spoke plainly to Xiao Ran who was beside him.

“Yes, master!”

Xiao Ran held the hilt of the Ancient Spiritual Sword tightly in his hand as he stared harshly at the thirteen people surrounding him. Hatred gleamed strongly in his eyes.

It was also this batch of people who had killed his mother and forced them into a life of running desperately.

Killing intent flashed in his eyes as he walked resolutely towards them.

After being pursued for over a year, Xiao Ran felt no fear and trepidation towards killing. All he felt was the desire to slay all his enemies one day.

Today, he was finally going to take the first step towards achieving his goal.

“Kill him as quickly as possible and get back!” The fat old man squinted his eyes as he instructed his men lazily.

“Hehe! Who would have expected a brat like you to recover in two days? However, we have two Inborn experts with us today. There’s no way for you to escape even if you had wings!”

Xiao Shisan stared harshly at Xiao Ran as he drew his longsword gradually.

“I won’t run again from today onwards. I’m going to kill every single one of you as revenge for my mother!”

Xiao Ran didn’t draw his sword. He was reserving it for the two Inborn experts and the rest weren’t qualified for him to use it.

“Hehe! Die now! Insolent brat!” Xiao Shisan and the crowd shouted coldly as they charged towards Xiao Ran with their weapons.

“I’m no longer the same kid as a year ago. Don’t oppress me just because I’m young!”

Xiao Ran’s expression was eerily cold. Looking at the thirteen people approaching him, a tinge of blue flames flashed across his eyes.

“Haha! Insolent brat! Don’t assume you can act brazenly just because you have some strength. No matter how gifted you are, you are going to meet your end today!”

Xiao Shisan and a few other men laughed hysterically. Piercing glow flashed on the surface of their swords as they lunged towards Xiao Ran. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Tsk!

Xiao Ran looked at them. Moving both of his hands, a circle of Tranquil Blue Heavenly Flames appeared on his palm. The Tranquil Blue Heavenly Flames were swaying and seemed eager to set the air ablaze.

“Die!” he shouted loudly as he swept the Tranquil Blue Heavenly Flame towards the thirteen people.

“Be careful! That blue flame is really powerful!” Xiao Shisan turned solemn and reminded the group loudly.

“Heavenly Flame! Oh gosh! It’s a Heavenly Flame!”

In one corner, the fat old man was exhilarated upon seeing the Heavenly Flame.

The skinny old man beside him had his eyes opened widely as he smiled radiantly. “Haha! After we kill that kid, the Heavenly Flame will belong to us.”

“Break!”

Xiao Shisan and the group slashed down on the Tranquil Blue Heavenly Flames that were flying towards them.

“Die!”

Seeing them still trying to withstand with their weapons, a cold flash beamed from Xiao Ran’s eyes.

The current him wasn’t the same as two days ago.

Boom!

He waved his hand and the circle of blue flames raged violently the moment they contacted their weapons.

To their astonishment, the Tranquil Blue Flames grew to over a meter in size and shrouded towards them.

“Shit!”

Xiao Shisan was taken by surprise. The Tranquil Blue Flame was different from previous times. The flames they had seen just a while ago were highly concentrated flames.

Argh!

Instantly, the eight Level 9 martial artists cried out pitifully.

When they saw the blue flames raging on one arm, they immediately tried to put them out by patting it with their other hand.

However, they hit nothing as they waved their other hand down.

Their arm had been reduced to dust before their astonished eyes. Moreover, the flames were spreading quickly towards their bodies.

It was as though they could no longer feel the temperature of the flames as they were reduced to dust like paper.

“How can this be possible...?”

Xiao Shisan was devastated as he looked at the spreading Tranquil Blue Heavenly Flame on his arm.

When the flames had landed on the Level 9 martial artists previously, the worse it could get was to torch the person. Yet, they were reduced to dust directly this time.

He patted towards his arm rapidly. However, to his astonishment, he hit nothing.

His arm and his body were disappearing rapidly.

His brain didn’t register any pain or misery. However, all these things were incomparably frightening.

Argh!

Pitiful cries reverberated. All thirteen people had disappeared creepily.

With a single strike, five Half-step to Inborn experts and eight Level 9 martial artists were reduced to dust.

Incomparably terrifying.

“What?”

The fat and skinny old men who had stayed behind looked on with disbelief.

That fat old man was fully alerted now as he shed his laziness from before. His eyes widened and were filled with confusion.

“It’s your turn now!”

Xiao Ran grabbed the Ancient Spiritual Sword by his waist and said, “Now, I’m going to kill both of you. After which, I’ll head to Xiao Clan to demand an explanation!”

“Annihilating thirteen experts in a single strike! How can this be? You aren’t at the Half-step to Inborn Realm! You have reached the Inborn Realm! A fifteen-year-old Inborn expert!”

The jaw of the skinny old man dropped and his eyes were filled with disbelief. He had completely lost his calm demeanor from before.

“How can this be possible? What kind of chance encounter did you have? Two days ago, you were still a Half-step to Inborn expert. Yet, you have reached the Inborn Realm today and even have a terrifying Heavenly Flame!”

The old man turned serious.

The Heavenly Flame was much stronger than ordinary flames and could substantially increase one’s strength.

“Because I have a powerful master!”

Xiao Ran lifted his head proudly while staring harshly at them.

“Master?”

The skinny and old man’s attention fell on Wang Xian and the group who had stayed behind through the developments.

“Kid, don’t assume you are a match for us after just reaching the Inborn Realm...,” the fat old man remarked coldly. He exchanged glances with the skinny old man and attacked Xiao Ran suddenly before completing his sentence.

They were going for the ambush!

They weren’t ashamed of ambushing a fifteen-year-old kid. With Xiao Ran possessing the powerful Heavenly Flame, it was worthwhile for them to be unscrupulous.

Huh?

Xiao Ran was taken aback slightly. He had not expected the two Inborn experts to attack suddenly. Therefore, his expression changed slightly as he retreated instantly.

“Kid, die now!”

Blue and red light shot out from the eyes of the two old men respectively. At the same instant, four needle-like hidden weapons shot towards Xiao Ran’s forehead and throat.

“This is bad!”

Xiao Ran was taken by surprise. He had not expected the other party to resort to hidden weapons after ambushing him. There’s no way he could guard against them.

Dang!

Xiao Ran retreated immediately and rapidly drew out the Ancient Spiritual Sword.

“Icy Flame Devil Needles aren’t something your small longsword could stop. No matter how demon-like your talents are, you are still going to die by our hands! Hehe!”

Excitement gleamed in the eyes of the skinny old man.

No matter how talented this kid was and how strong he was, his battling experiences were far lacking.

Pa Pa!

However, the moment Xiao Ran drew the Ancient Spiritual Sword, the face of the skinny old man stiffened instantly. His eyes opened widely as he said, “Inborn Spiritual Weapon! Oh gosh! You... Who is your master? Who could have afforded to give you an Inborn Spiritual Weapon?”

“My master?”

Xiao Ran revealed a chilling and proud smirk, glowered at them and shouted, “Remember this! My master is Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown! Now you guys can die!”

“What?”

The fat and skinny old men were completely stunned. Bitterness gleamed in their eyes and they gritted their teeth.

“So what if he is Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown? Even without the Xiao Clan, the Liang Family could suppress him!”
