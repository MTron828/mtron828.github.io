Chapter 1464: 1464, revenge

“Bang!”

In the North Current Sea, Wang Xian and 200 golden swordfish, two civil officials of the Dragon Palace, emerged from the bottom of the sea and floated on the surface of the sea.

The 200 strange demons were hiding in the surrounding areas.

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and noticed that there were humans flying past in the distant sky.

“They are just ahead!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. With a move of his body, he continued flying forward. The group of Golden Swordfish and the rest were like dead people with no heartbeat. They were extremely cold.

If Wang Xian didn’t know them, he wouldn’t be able to sense their life force and strength.

“Eh? What’s ahead?”

After flying for more than ten kilometers, Wang Xian saw a huge mountain peak piercing into the ocean.

The entire mountain peak was golden in color. It was like an incomparably huge sharp sword that pierced into the sky for two kilometers.

There were many ships docked at the front. Every ship was extremely luxurious.

Other than the ships, there were also many people sitting on strange airships.

The airships were floating in the sky. They were emitting a strange luster. Such airships were not found in the Liuhai region.

Wang Xian swept his gaze across and revealed a curious expression.

“Interesting. It seems that the vast area is much more interesting than the Liuhai region!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the airships indifferently and flew straight to the front.

“Stop right there. If you want to queue up, go to the front. No one is allowed to pass through here!”

Just as Wang Xian was approaching the Sword Mountain, a cold voice was heard.

Wang Xian looked over and saw two young men holding golden longswords shouting at them arrogantly.

He took a glance and circled around the area, preparing to continue flying towards the land.

“I hope I can pass the examination of the Atlas Sword sect this time and join the Atlas Sword sect. If I fail this time, I won’t have a chance in the future!”

“Only by joining the Atlas Sword sect will I be able to soar to the skies. This time, I will definitely be able to enter!”

As he passed by, the bustling voices entered Wang Xian’s ears.

“Atlas Sword Sect?”

He swept his gaze around curiously and noticed that there were quite a number of experts on the ships.

Among them, there were quite a number of fourth and fifth-level profound void martial artists.

There were at least two to three hundred profound void martial artists on the hundreds of ships in the surroundings.

It could be seen that this towering sky sword sect was not simple.

I should first go to the land and understand some of the situation first

Wang Xian thought to himself as he continued to fly forward.

“Dragon King, there’s an acquaintance there!”

Suddenly, ao Jian’s voice sounded.

“Acquaintance?”

Wang Xian was slightly taken aback. How could he meet an acquaintance here.

He looked at the location ao Jian was pointing at and was slightly taken aback.

Ren Xingchen was Ren Xingchen.

“If I remember correctly, this guy was chased by someone and escaped to the Liuhai region. I didn’t expect him to be back now!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he looked at Ren Xingchen who was wiping his sword with his head.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment before he moved and flew towards the ship Ren Xingchen was on.

“Eh? Who are those people? Are they here to participate in the Qingtian Sword Sect’s assessment?”

“These two hundred people don’t look like they are here. They are wearing the same outfit. They might be from other forces!”

When Wang Xian led ao Jian and the rest to fly over, some curious voices came from the surroundings.

Some people on the airship in the sky glanced over and didn’t pay much attention to them.

“Eh? That is?”

Ren Xingchen raised his head and took a look. When he saw Wang Xian and the rest flying over to him, he was slightly stunned.

“Sir!”

He quickly went up and greeted Wang Xian respectfully.

“Why are you here?”

Wang Xian looked at Ren Xingchen and asked him.

“Sir, I’m here for Revenge!”

Ren Xingchen did not hide anything and said to Wang Xian.

“Revenge? Your enemy is from this Atlas Sword Sect?”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the huge sword mountain and frowned slightly.

“No, it’s the Wu clan from ancient Dharma City. Back then, our Ren family had a business dispute with them. They plotted to annihilate more than a thousand members of our Ren family. I was the only one who escaped!”

Ren Xingchen shook his head and looked at a ship on the right. His eyes were filled with hatred and killing intent.

Wang Xian looked over. It was a blue ship that was about a thousand meters in size.

On the side of the ship, there was a huge Wu character.

There were over 400 people standing on the ship. In the middle of the ship was an old man.

The old man was dressed in a green robe. The huge Wu character was located on his chest.

“Third level of the Void Interpretation Stage!”

Wang Xian mumbled as he looked at Ren Xingchen. “Are you confident?”

“If it wasn’t for the fact that I would be attacked by the mayor’s residence if I were to kill people in the city, I would have destroyed them long ago!”

Ren Xingchen gritted his teeth. “I’m confident that I can destroy them all by myself!”

“Are you prepared to make a move here?”

Wang Xian asked.

Ren Xingchen nodded and looked behind him. He said coldly, “I’m waiting. I’m waiting for the arrival of a family to inquire about some things!”

“Have you made a plan?”

Wang Xian asked Ren Xingchen.

“I have made a plan. This is my only chance for more than half a month. I Can’t let them live anymore!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“As long as it’s not a battle on the towering Sky Sword Mountain, the towering sky sword sect will not interfere!”

Ren Xingchen nodded his head heavily.

“Alright, you’ll have to depend on yourself!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly and flew towards the ship that Ren Xingchen was flying towards.

“If you want to step onto the ship, each of you will get 1,000 middle-grade spirit stones!”

Wang Xian landed and a middle-aged man walked over and said coldly.

The civil official of the Dragon Palace waved his arm and passed all the spirit stones to the ship owner.

Ren Xingchen jumped onto the ship and stood at the side. He held the sword without saying a word and kept wiping it.

The sword was the golden water heaven-raising sword that Wang Xian gifted him back then. Its name was quite related to the heaven-raising sword sect.

“Let’s change to another weapon. This sword doesn’t match your strength anymore!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and a third level void interpretation sword of the golden water attribute landed gently beside Ren Xingchen.

“Thank you, Sir!”

Ren Xingchen was slightly taken aback. He nodded respectfully at Wang Xian and opened the sword that Wang Xian had given him again. There was gratitude and passion in his eyes.

“I will use this sword to kill the enemy!”

Ren Xingchen smiled coldly.

Wang Xian took a glance at Ren Xingchen and shifted his gaze to the side.

Time passed slowly.

Clang

At this moment, Wang Xian heard the sound of a sharp sword being unsheathed. He looked over.

He looked at Ren Xingchen’s slightly red eyes as he stared at a ship that was approaching slowly.

The ship and the ship of the Wu clan were close together.

The people on the two ships were laughing and chatting.

“It’s here. I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time. Day and night, I’ve been waiting for this day!”

Ren Xingchen held the long sword in his hand tightly as he paced in the air and slowly walked towards the two ships.
