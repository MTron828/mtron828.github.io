Chapter 2901: intimidated everyone

“Dragon King, I can’t find their aura. I can’t find where they are hiding now!”

The Heaven Array flew to the front of the Dragon sedan and reported to Wang Xian with a grim expression.

With his current strength, he was confident that the other party couldn’t escape his detection. However, he couldn’t find any information at the moment.

Over a million godly monarchs and a group of godly monarchs vanished just like that.

There were no traces at all.

“Since bhang has become such a huge force, they must have their own trump cards. If they can’t find them, then so be it!”

Wang Xian frowned slightly and said.

“Dragon King, this base of bhang is a blessed land of bhang. I think we can build a dragon palace here.”

“I don’t believe that there aren’t any traces of the eight barrens and the rest. I don’t believe that they would give up the base that they have been building for a long time!”

A cold expression flashed in the eyes of the Heaven Array.

“Okay.”

Wang Xian nodded his head. It would be much more convenient to build a dragon palace here in the future. He could teleport to the eight barrens and six directions instantly.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

At this moment, figures flew over one by one.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian looked over and swept his gaze across them.

“Hehe, boss Wang, Tianxin is here. She came with her father. My master is here too!”

At this moment, invincible battlemage was holding a communication stone plate. He said excitedly when he saw a figure flying over.

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

Soon, a group of people flew to the front and greeted Wang Xian respectfully. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

They were led by six old men. Each of them had the strength of a divine emperor.

Behind them were a group of disciples and descendants.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across them and nodded slightly at them.

“Invincible!”

At this moment, behind an old man, Tian Xin, who was a lover of invincible battle technique, shouted at invincible battle technique.

“Hehe, Tian Xin!”

Invincible battle technique immediately flew over and cracked a smile. “How is it, Tian Xin? I came here on a palanquin pulled by nine divine dragons. Isn’t It Cool?”

“In the future, no one will dare to bully us in the entire resplendent starry sky. If anyone dares to bully us, I will let boss Wang kill them!”

“Those cowards from the eight desolate have all escaped. I don’t know where they have gone. In the future, the Dragon Palace will build a dragon palace here!”

As invincible said this, he slightly raised his head and his face was full of pride.

The current him was even more arrogant than the previous him.

In the past, he only had the teacher of the divine emperor as his backer. Now, the Dragon Palace was his backer. With the strength of the Dragon Palace, the divine emperor didn’t dare to provoke him!

“Kid, if you don’t behave yourself in the future, Don’t blame me for being rude.”

The divine emperor of Shangshui flew over from the side and heavily patted the head of invincible in battle techniques.

Obviously, he was somewhat dissatisfied with his disciple running directly to the woman’s side and not coming to his side.

“Hehe, Brother Shangshui, you’ve taken in a good disciple!”

Beside Tianxin, the old man said with a smile on his face. The more he looked at the invincible battle techniques, the more satisfied he became.

This kid was not only talented but also had a terrifying background!

This time, when they learned that the Dragon King had come, they, the unspecialized celestial thearch, came to pay a visit to the Dragon King.

At the very least, they had to express their goodwill.

“Haha, if it wasn’t for this kid’s good talent and likability, with his behavior, I would have broken his legs!”

The god Emperor of Shangshui laughed out loud and said with a smile on his face.

Now, he could be considered to be able to bask in the glory of his disciple.

“Everyone, we will build the Dragon Palace here and take over the territory of the eight barrens. Please give us your guidance in the future!”

At this moment, Wang Xian cupped his hands toward the group of God emperors and said faintly.

“If the Dragon King needs anything in the future, you can tell us directly!”

The Divine Emperors immediately replied.

They looked at the desolate grotto-heaven that was empty below and sighed slightly in their hearts.

They wondered where the desolate had escaped to?

…

“The Dragon King and the rest have already arrived at our desolate grotto-heaven!”

At the same time, in the depths of the desolate grotto-heaven, there was a very special mystic realm with millions of people living around it.

At the front, the fourteen divine emperors of the eight desolates stood there with embarrassed expressions.

At the side, the monarch of the imperial court looked around with an expressionless face.

“When we leave this time, the Dragon King and the others will definitely occupy our place. That is a blessed land that can be ranked high in the dazzling starry sky. They will not give up!”

“Once they occupy our place…”

A divine emperor said with an embarrassed expression. He did not finish his words, but everyone around him understood.

“Lord desolate divine emperor, are we going to hide here forever? Like rats crossing the street?”

A divine emperor said directly with an embarrassed expression.

“How is the concealment effect here? The Heaven Array is the most powerful array master in the resplendent starry skies. Once we are found, everyone will die.”

Before the desolate divine emperor could reply, the monarch asked him.

“This is a secret realm of a powerful race. No matter how strong the Heaven Array is, it will not be able to find us. Even if they can find us, they won’t be able to enter without a key.”

The desolate divine emperor said with a dark expression.

“Now, once we leave, we will die.”

Hearing his response, the Emperor Lord nodded and said to the other eight barrens divine emperor.

“Then… then we will stay here for tens of millions of years and stay here for the rest of Our Lives?”

A divine emperor growled angrily.

“Unless the Dragon Palace is destroyed in the starry sky, we will not be able to return!”

The Emperor Lord said expressionlessly and raised his head slightly. “They are too strong and their improvement speed is too fast. I am sure that they will become stronger after taking over the resources of the Wizard Association!”

When the experts from the eight barrens heard the monarch’s words, they clenched their fists tightly and their bodies trembled slightly.

They did not doubt the monarch’s words. The monarch was the only one left in the imperial court.

If not for his conviction of revenge supporting him, he would have risked his life against the Dragon Palace!

“Staying here for a lifetime is worse than death!”

A God emperor roared in a low voice.

“There’s another method. It’s to go deep into the eight desolates. With our understanding and investigation of the eight desolates, the eight desolates is the race battlefield at the center of the Universe!”

“Go through the eight desolates. The other side is the center of the universe.”

Desolate god Emperor said slowly.

“Go through the eight desolates?”

His words made the god Emperors turn pale. Go through the eight desolates?

“Lord desolate, this is a narrow escape!”

A God emperor roared softly.

“I once met an expert from the other side in the depths of the eight desolations and six harmonies, but he ignored me.”

At this moment, the desolate god Emperor suddenly said.

“Oh?”

A luster bloomed in front of the god Emperor’s eyes as he stared at him.
