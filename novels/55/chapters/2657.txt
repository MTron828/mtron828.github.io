2658 Under empress 2,6

“I am friends with Star Lady.”

Wang Xian smiled when he heard the Old Guardian’s words!

“Empress!”

“The Guardian addressed Empress as Empress. This means...”

“Isn’t this normal? Holy Shit, the space beast towering snake battle pet is at Immortal King Level 5. Furthermore, the Guardian has tested it earlier. The battle pet is completely loyal to its owner. Such strength is heaven-defying.”

“The empress is indeed worthy of her name, just the Empress’s strength far surpasses the other disciples, not to mention her trump cards, a space beast battle pet, not to mention the same generation, look up there, 7 or 8 generations above, are there any opponents for the Empress?”

“As for the powers, there’s no need to compete at all, not to mention the Dragon King, the Empress only relies on her space beast towering snake, a group of geniuses surrounding her, they might not even be a match for the Space Beast.”

“It’s not just the celestial maiden. The number one of this generation has also come out. There’s no comparison at all. She’s completely crushed. She’s completely crushed.”

When everyone around heard the Guardian’s words, they all had shocked expressions on their faces.

The Guardian’s words meant that the celestial maiden of this generation had already been decided!

However, everyone also understood that with such strength, wasn’t she still the celestial maiden? It was no exaggeration to say that she was the number one person of this generation.

She was probably the first person in the history of the imperial court to rely solely on the war pet, the space behemoth.

“What is the relationship between the Dragon King and the Empress? The Space Behemoth? Such a war pet is given to the Empress?”

“This space behemoth seems to be able to grow to the peak of the Godly King realm at its peak, right? This is a terrifying existence at the level of a Guardian!”

Soon, some people looked at Wang Xian who was standing on the viewing stairs. Their eyes sparkled as they were filled with shock.

Such a space beast battle pet could be given to the daughter of Emperor Star. Even her own father couldn’t bear to give it to her.

Could it be her godfather?

Some of the young people were thinking about it.

“Hiss, this can’t be compared at all.”

In the square, Di Suyi, Di hunge, and the rest looked at him in a daze. Their faces were filled with helplessness.

They were not on the same level.

Di Qingshan’s expression was unsightly as he stood there, his expression uncertain.

“Luckily she didn’t know that she had targeted her back then.”

At this moment, di Qingshan felt a sense of relief in his heart.

“Big Brother, this is yours... Yours...”

At the side of the crowd, di Haofang stared blankly at the shining girl in the plaza. He opened his mouth and spoke to his big brother at the side.

Di Haofang’s body trembled slightly. His expression was abnormally ugly.

This was his daughter, the daughter who didn’t acknowledge him as her father.

He knew a little about the space beast Chu snake. It could grow to the peak of the godly monarch realm.

Such an existence, as long as it didn’t die midway, was a peak godly monarch existence.

He himself didn’t even dare to be sure that he could become a peak godly monarch expert.

“Alright, the Empress is the Empress Star. The first place in this generation’s disciple competition is also the Empress Star. You Don’t have to participate in the following matches. You can just watch from the side.”

“Next, we will select the emperor and rank him.”

At this moment, the old Protector announced with a smile on his face.

Di Hun Ge, Di Suyi, and the rest didn’t have any objections.

The Empress Star couldn’t help but reveal a happy smile on her face at this moment. She kept the towering snake and flew directly toward her mother and Wang Xian.

“Mom, I’ve become the Empress.”

Di Xingnu hugged her mother and said excitedly.

“Good, good. Good job, Xingnu.”

Tears welled up in the woman’s eyes as she patted her back happily.

“Xingnu, you have to thank Dragon King and young master Wang Xian.”

The woman looked at her daughter’s face and instructed.

“I know.”

The Empress Star nodded her head and looked at Wang Xian.

Wang Xian raised his head slightly and looked down on her.

The Empress Star couldn’t help but laugh when she saw him like this.

“After I become the empress, I will have a lot of power. Furthermore, the strength that I displayed will be valued by the imperial court. You can stay in the imperial court for a few days. I will treat my benefactor well.”

The empress whispered to Wang Xian.

“Forget it this time. There are still some matters to settle on the Demon Island. Aren’t you going to enter the mystic realm after becoming the Empress? Come to the Dragon Palace to thank me when you have the time.”

Wang Xian smiled.

Following that, Wang Xian and the rest treated him as an audience and watched the competition between the other nineteen disciples.

After a few hours of competition, the Emperor was selected. Di Hun Ge had a battle pet at the peak of the master God level. Under the cover of the vines, his strength was also comparable to the peak of the master God level. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

In addition, Emperor Soul Song’s power was also relatively strong. After considering it all, Emperor Soul song was the emperor of this generation.

...

Similarly, he was also the second in this generation.

If it wasn’t for the Emperor Star Lady’s extremely powerful talent and that terrifying space beast battle pet, Emperor Soul Song would definitely be the most dazzling existence of this generation.

Unfortunately, with the Emperor Star Lady, Emperor Soul Song, who had extraordinary talent and strength, appeared somewhat mediocre.

“The Celestial Emperor’s daughter will be allocated a side hall to live in in the imperial court palace. She can bring three relatives to live in it.”

“Tomorrow, the top 100 disciples will enter the merit shop. The top 10 disciples will enter the mystic realm to cultivate for a month.”

“The Abyss is coming, and the war is about to begin. In a month, all of you disciples will go to the Abyss battlefield. One is to train, and the other is to accumulate merits. At that time, your forces will follow you into the Abyss Battlefield!”

After the ranking ended, a group of disciples stood in the square. The Old Protector spoke with a solemn expression.

“It seems that the abyss this time is actually threatening the entire imperial court. Even the disciples of the imperial court are going to battle.”

When Wang Xian heard the words of the old protector, his eyes flickered with a luster.

For the war to affect the imperial court, there must be an existence at the level of the void God Emperor in the abyss. Otherwise, the disciples like the Imperial Star Lady should not have been sent to the battlefield.

“Alright, all the disciples will head to the Merit Shop Tomorrow.”

...

After the old Protector announced the end, the group of disciples immediately dispersed.

“Mom, Wang Xian!”

The Empress flew over happily.

“Congratulations to the Empress. She is truly the best of the current generation!”

“Haha, it’s fortunate that she is not in the same generation as the empress. Otherwise, she would have been suppressed. Congratulations.”

However, before Wang Xian and the rest could have a good chat with the celestial maiden, many people flew towards her.

The Celestial Maiden was slightly taken aback when she saw everyone congratulating her. A smile appeared on her face as she replied immediately.

At her age, she was considered a junior in the imperial court. She didn’t dare to put on airs when it came to congratulating her elders.

Furthermore, there were also many former princes and princesses who came to congratulate and befriend her. She didn’t dare to not respond.

Even though she had great potential.

Wang Xian took a look and a smile appeared on his face.

Since the matter of the imperial star daughter had been resolved, it was time for him to return.

He had also received a signal from the imperial court that a great war was about to break out.

Meanwhile, the Dragon Palace had to improve as soon as possible and complete its transformation in this great war!
