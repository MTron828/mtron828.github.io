“Boom!”

“Did you guys know that the Yun family was destroyed by the dragon spike? The Yun family was actually destroyed by the dragon Spike!”

“Of course we heard about it. The Yun family, the head of the Yun family is a transcendent level 9 powerhouse. I heard that even their corpse has not been found yet!”

“The dragon spike, it’s the dragon spike. The dragon spike was actually able to destroy the Yun family. This is simply inconceivable!”

“The Yun family’s strength can be ranked in the top ten of our Eastern Sea city, yet it was actually destroyed by the dragon spike in a single night. No one discovered it.”

“The Yun family head’s younger sister married the Thunder City Lord. Could it be that the dragon Spike is taking revenge on the Thunder City Lord Again!”

“It’s very possible. Yesterday, the dragon Spike no longer accepted the mission, but he destroyed the Yun family at night. This must be a warning to the Thunder City Lord!”

“If it can even destroy the Yun family’s dragon spike, which family in East Sea city can not be dealt with by the dragon spike?”

It was crazy!

It was boiling!

It was shocking!

When the Yun family’s door was affixed with a large red piece of paper congratulating them on their death, when this news spread out.

In the quiet morning of East Sea city, there was no doubt that a ferocious giant dragon had been placed in the city.

The entire city was shocked. What happened today was far more shocking than what happened yesterday.

The Yun family was one of the top ten families in the Eastern Sea city.

If such a family was destroyed, then wouldn’t the dragon Spike be invincible in the Eastern Sea city.

Perhaps only the city Lord’s mansion didn’t have the strength to charge in.

But although the dragon spike didn’t dare to enter, he wasn’t afraid at all. He even provoked them one after another.

Yesterday, it assassinated ten city guards on the street.

Today, it destroyed the family of the Thunder City Lord’s second son.

This... this...

This was simply too violent!

“Dragon Spike, Dragon Spike, Dragon Spike!”

“Boom!”

Within the city Lord’s Mansion, Lei Feihu roared three times in a row. The table beside him instantly turned into black powder.

A group of eastern sea city officials trembled as they stood in front of him. They lowered their heads and didn’t dare to speak.

“Did you find any traces?”

Lei Feihu widened his eyes. His entire body was like a ball of lightning, as if it could explode at any moment.

Everyone felt as if they were about to die at any moment.

“Reporting to the city lord, the array surveillance only saw a black shadow. There were no other traces!”

An old man braced himself and said in a low voice, “My guess is that this demonic beast race should have a powerful concealment ability, and they can also perfectly crack the array!”

“No traces? No Traces?”

Lei Feihu glared over, his face extremely gloomy.

“City Lord, this opponent is too cunning, we have no way to deal with him!”

The old man felt Lei Feihu’s pressure and said with a trembling voice.

If the dragon Spike could assassinate the Yun family, it might be able to assassinate them.

“Today, I will personally supervise the city. I don’t believe that they can kill people right under my nose!”

Lei Feihu’s gaze was cold. His body moved and he instantly appeared in the air.

A large hole was directly opened on the roof of the city Lord’s Manor.

They could faintly see that the city lord was coldly scanning his surroundings from 10,000 meters up in the air.

Personally supervising the city!

The city Lord personally supervising the city. One could imagine how furious he was.

“Let’s go. We will follow. The city lord can only monitor an area of about 80 kilometers. Leave the rest to us!”

An old man gritted his teeth and said to the people around him.

“Alright!”

The group of six nodded.

They were all extraordinary ninth rank experts, and they could monitor an area of about 10 kilometers while floating in the air.

It was enough to make up for the city Lord’s blind spot.

The group of people with the most authority in East Sea city all flew into the sky. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

They were personally supervising the city.

If the people in Donghai City knew about this, they would be dumbfounded.

“Eh? This Yun family actually has such a relationship with the city lord. I really didn’t know about this!”

In the morning, Wang Xian, who had been refining pills and weapons for more than ten hours, walked into a restaurant and ordered some dishes.

When he heard the discussion of the people around him, he revealed a stunned expression.

He didn’t expect the Yun family to have such a relationship with the city lord.

Furthermore, it had caused such a huge misunderstanding.

This was beyond his expectations.

“However, this is a good thing!”

The corners of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly. He ate some food and heard the discussion of the people around him.

An hour later, he returned to his residence with a relaxed expression.

“Ao Yao, there are twenty city guards today!”

“Long Yi, in the afternoon, the dragon Spike will begin accepting the mission!”

Wang Xian ordered Ao Yao and the DRAKONID.

In the morning, he would assassinate another twenty city guards and in the afternoon, he would accept the mission.

If the mayor’s residence still dared to deal with the dragon spike, that would be great. Tomorrow, there would be forty or even eighty city guards!

Ao Yao could choose to assassinate the city guards.

Ao Yao was now a complete species of thorned dragons. She could tell if a person was good or bad.

For this assassination, Wang Xian would not implicate innocent good people.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao and the DRAKONID immediately nodded respectfully.

The weather today was a little gloomy.

In fact, due to the proximity to the ocean, there was a lot of rain in Donghai City.

The weather today was a little gloomy, but it did not rain heavily.

“I heard that the Pang family and the Jiang family are negotiating in the ancient mountain restaurant today? In the future, both sides are not allowed to interfere with each other’s business. Both sides are not allowed to hire the dragon assassin organization!”

“It’s not just the Pang family and the Jiang family. Even the Zhu family and the Wang family are negotiating too!”

“The Yun family has been wiped out. Who can not be wiped out by the Dragon Assassin organization? Now, if both sides have a grudge, there are only two ways to resolve it. One is to reconcile, and the other is to contact the dragon assassin organization as soon as possible in the future and kill the opponent!”

“It’s hard to say now. Maybe the city Lord will destroy the dragon spike. Some families are still waiting to see what will happen!”

At a stall on the side of the street, a few people were talking unscrupulously.

Around them, a small team of ten city guards was looking around vigilantly.

At this moment, it was as if someone was ambushing them, looking around vigilantly.

When the surrounding people saw this scene, they felt that it was very funny.

However, they did not dare to ridicule and could only hold it in.

This also caused many people to sigh. An assassin organization actually forced a city Lord’s mansion to such an extent. It was rarely seen since ancient times!

“F * ck!”

However, very quickly, no one could laugh. All of their faces revealed terrified expressions.

Eight out of the ten city guards suddenly fell to the ground. There was a bloody mark on their necks.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

The surroundings instantly fell silent. Each and every one of them seemed to be frozen as they looked over in a daze.

They had suddenly died!

There were no signs at all!

This time was different from yesterday. This time, because the ten city guards were more vigilant, everyone was secretly watching.

However, under the watchful eyes of the crowd, eight city guards fell to the ground.

Death!

Strange!

Strange!

Everyone felt a chill on their backs!
