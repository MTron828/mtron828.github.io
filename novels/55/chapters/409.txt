Chapter 410: The Son Of The Richest Man

“That... That guy is... Oh gosh...”

Young Master Feng, Young Master Luan and Young Master Nan, who were sitting by the side, were astonished to see Lan Qingyue holding onto the arm of Wang Xian.

“I would never have expected him to be Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown.”

“We should have thought about it sooner. Maniac Ji doesn’t have any friends. Among those he knows, only Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown could possibly give out Level 2 and Level 3 elixir pills as gifts casually!”

“That guy is Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown! If we knew, we should have...”

The three of them exchanged glances before looking in the direction of Ji Xiang and subsequently Wang Dahai. They hesitated for a moment before walking towards Wang Dahai.

“Hey brother, how are you?”

The three of them smiled radiantly and sat beside Wang Dahai courteously. From their tones, one could tell that they were trying to get on the good books of Wang Dahai.

Wang Dahai was taken aback. He could vaguely hear the conversation of the surrounding crowd. Now that he saw three young men with powerful backgrounds walking towards him and sitting beside him, he felt a little overwhelmed and didn’t know how to respond.

“Hello, hello... I’m Wang Dahai!”

...

“What did you say?”

At the other corner of the banquet hall, Wang Dahai’s cousin, Xiao You, sat before an old man. She had just illustrated what happened previously to the old man. The old man was astonished and his expressions were changing rapidly.

However, they rushed into the entrance of the banquet hall after hearing the conversations around them.

Xiao You also looked across with doubts and was soon overwhelmed with surprise and shock.

“Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown! Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown!”

The old man repeated himself. He looked to his granddaughter, took a deep breath and said, “Tell me exactly how you have offended him previously! Don’t leave out any details!”

“Grandpa, we... We didn’t know that he is Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown! We really didn’t!”

Xiao You shook her head in horror and repeated in detail the developments of the whole incident.

The old man’s expression changed rapidly. He looked towards where his grandson was and was taken aback once again.

He saw the successors to the three elite families of Flow City conversing with his grandson joyously, smiles never leaving their faces.

“Dahai and Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown are classmates?” The old man regained his composure and asked his granddaughter this.

“Yeah. They seem to be on really good terms too. Grandpa, can you ask cousin to put in a word with Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown and ask him to let Jingshan off...?”

“Don’t talk about this anymore.”

The old man interrupted her directly and stared harshly at his granddaughter. “Don’t even think about this again. The one you guys have offended is Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown. It’s over for you guys. You should be fine, as you are the cousin of Dahai. As for Jingshan and the other young men, they wouldn’t be able to escape. If their families knew about this, they would know to handle it as such. Tsk! Who asked you guys to be so full of yourselves and look down on others?”

“Who gives you guys the guts to criticize Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown about his attire. A character like him isn’t someone we can comment on. You can return home now.”

“What? Grandpa! You...!”

Wang Dahai’s cousin was breaking down and looked at her grandfather in fear.

“Just return home for now. If it wasn’t for your cousin, you would be in deep trouble too!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The old man glanced at his granddaughter and was a little disappointed. He then looked towards his grandson as excitement gleamed in his eyes.

“Who would have expected this kid to know Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown? He’s much better than that poor father of his!” The old man smiled contentedly as he mumbled to himself.

...

“It’s over. We are totally finished!”

When the group of young men saw the young man they had mocked previously at the entrance of the banquet hall, and heard the exclaims and conversation of the surrounding crowd, their faces were filled with despair.

This time, no one could possibly save them.

Recalling how they were criticizing Wang Xian’s attire previously, commenting on what made one more superior to others and also demanding him to get lost, the group couldn’t help but feel great remorse over their actions.

Even if Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown didn’t attempt to do anything to them, with his current strength and status, the outcome would be the same. There would be others who would teach them a lesson.

Their futures were bleak.

“Xiao Xian, you are pretty early. Let’s find a place to sit down!” Lan Qingyue held onto Wang Xian’s arm as they walked in.

Wang Xian waved in the direction of Ji Xiang and Wang Dahai as he walked in.

Wang Dahai was exhilarated and walked over in a hurry. His plump face was flushed from the sudden “intense exercise.”

At this moment, he finally realized how incredible his brother was.

He was simply incredible.

Young Master Feng and his friends followed behind shamelessly and walked towards Wang Xian.

“Qingyue, Miracle Doctor Wang. Are you guys going in?”

Beside them, Lan Qingyue’s uncle pointed to a private suite in the banquet hall and asked them this.

“We will give it a pass. Uncle, you can go. We would like to stay here for a while!” answered Lan Qingyue as she shook her head.

Lan Qingyue’s uncle smiled and nodded his head. With Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown around, Lan Qingyue wouldn’t have to actively engage the guests.

“Miss Lan, Miracle Doctor Wang, please take a seat!”

The moment Wang Xian and Lan Qingyue arrived at the forefront, several elders stood up and spoke.

“Thank you!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and didn’t stand on ceremony. He found a seat and sat down.

“You’re welcome. You’re welcome.” The few elders waved their hands instantly.

The attention of the entire banquet hall had all gathered on Wang Xian. This was still the first time the majority of the people here had caught a glimpse of Wang Xian.

Considering his achievements, he wasn’t just the king of Rivertown currently. He was the king of the entire Southern Province.

Within the Southern Province, no one was a match for him.

Even Mogul Sun was miles away from him.

Wang Xian, Lan Qingyue and Wang Dahai sat and chatted casually.

Haha!

Soon, a peal of hearty laughter reverberated from the private suite in the banquet hall. Following which, three young men walked out from it.

The leader of the three young men had blonde hair and looked like he had parents with different geographical origins. The other two young men to his sides were rather slim. They looked alike and were conversing energetically with the young man in the middle.

“That’s the son of Mogul Sun. I heard he has just returned from overseas.”

“Some rumors have it that the son of Mogul Sun has joined a powerful ancestral sect. I wonder if it’s true!”

“It’s a rare occasion to see the son of Mogul Sun. I had not expected him to return this year!”

The surrounding crowd looked at the mixed-blood young man and discussed softly.

Wang Xian looked over curiously and his gaze fell on the three young men.

“Eh? All of them are martial artists?”

When looking across them, he could feel strong energies from their bodies.

The three of them were all exceptionally powerful.

The son of Mogul Sun was at most twenty-three or twenty-four years old. However, he already had the strength of a Half-step to Inborn expert. His talents were comparable to some Saints and Saintesses of Sacred Sects.

As for the other two young men, they were roughly thirty-three years old. Both of them had reached the Inborn Realm and their talents could be considered to be terrifying.

I wonder which Sacred Sect they are from...

Wang Xian scrutinized the three young men. Considering their talents, they were definitely outstanding disciples raised by Sacred Sects. The only question would be which Sacred Sect they had come from.
