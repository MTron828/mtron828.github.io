Chapter 906: 8,0907,000,000 medium-grade spirit stones!

Translator: 549690339

There were no more than twenty extraordinary sixth-grade experts in the entire holy sea town.

However, these extraordinary sixth-grade experts would definitely fight for a transcendent sixth-grade medicinal pill.

8,000,000 medium-grade spirit stones was equivalent to the annual turnover of the three largest shops, the life and Death Pill Workshop, the Saint Item Forging Workshop, and the Immortal Phoenix Pill and Weapon Workshop.

Eight million middle-grade spirit stones wasn’t a lot in the entire holy sea town.

However, this young man had taken out eight million middle-grade spirit stones in one go.

A poor kid?

A foolish fellow?

Looking at the eight million middle-grade spirit stones that were flickering with light, everyone’s minds were in a daze.

Most of the people in the surroundings had seen the most spirit stones in their entire lives, and these were probably the ones before their eyes.

If they were not in the city, everyone would have gone crazy to snatch them.

“Cough cough, cough cough!”

Shopkeeper Liu suddenly coughed violently. There was a flash of passion in his eyes as he said, “Young... young master, are you really going to use all of them to buy elixirs?”

“Do you think I’m joking with You?”

Wang Xian smiled faintly.

“No, no, no. How could this be? Young master, we will immediately prepare whatever elixirs you want to buy. If there isn’t enough in the shop, we will immediately go to other shops to get them!”

Shopkeeper Liu waved his hand quickly and walked up to him with a face full of enthusiasm.

He was afraid that Wang Xian was teasing him.

F * ck, there were so many spirit stones. As long as he could get this business, it would be equivalent to two to three years of Feng Xian’s turnover.

So what if he was being ostracized by the other two major forces?

In two to three years, he would have a way to tide over this crisis.

Shopkeeper Liu looked at him with excitement and anticipation.

Wang Xian waved his arm and kept all the spiritual stones into his interspatial ring. Then, he threw the interspatial ring directly to shopkeeper Liu.

“Go in and get the elixirs!”

When shopkeeper Liu saw that Wang Xian had thrown the interspatial ring that contained eight million spiritual stones over, his arm trembled as he hurriedly took it.

“Alright, Alright. Young master, what kind of elixirs do you want? We will prepare them for you!”

Shopkeeper Liu’s face was flushed red. Damn it, the other party actually gave him the interspatial ring directly. This business was 100% successful!

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly.

It wasn’t that he trusted shopkeeper Liu, but rather, he trusted Feng Luan.

Something had happened in Feng Xian’s elixir and weapons workshop. He would help as much as he could.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly.

“This, this, this...”

However, shopkeeper Qing of the life and Death Elixir Workshop, the shopkeeper of the holy item forging workshop, Dao Hen and the rest were completely dumbfounded.

They were still ridiculing shopkeeper Liu earlier on.

They even said that the kid was a poor kid who could only buy two extraordinary first level elixirs at most.

In an instant, it was a slap in the face!

Moreover, it was so loud and clear.

Their mockery seemed to be mocking themselves in front of the eight million spiritual stones.

This caused everyone’s expressions to change drastically.

“The real person doesn’t show his face. Who would have thought that he, he, he... actually has so many spirit stones!”

“Oh my God, I really can’t believe it. He’s Too Rich!”

“F * ck, after this Feng Xian completes this business, she can completely close the shop for two to three years!”

The eyes of everyone around flashed with shock. They looked at Shopkeeper Dao Hen Qing and the others, their expressions somewhat mocking.

That’s right, they were mocking.

Shopkeeper Qing and the others’expressions slowly became ugly. She looked at Dao Hen at the side.

Dao Hen’s one eye flashed with a luster. “I said, whoever dares to buy things from the Phoenix Immortal is not giving me face, Kid...”

“Dao Hen, I’m warning you. If you dare to threaten our customers, the life and death medicinal pill workshop will definitely not be able to protect you!”

Shopkeeper Liu was instantly enraged when he heard Dao Hen’s voice. He turned his head and stared at him coldly. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Dao Hen’s expression changed slightly when he heard shopkeeper Liu’s angry threat.

If he were to say that he had so arrogantly ruined Feng Xian’s eight million middle grade spirit stones business, he did not dare to guarantee that the forces behind Feng Xian would directly send experts to eliminate him.

That was because the benefits this time were too great!

“Young master, don’t worry. If anyone dares to threaten you, I will immediately report this matter to the headquarters. I believe that the headquarters will definitely send experts to eliminate the person who threatened you!”

Shopkeeper Liu assured Wang Xian forcefully.

“I believe!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly and walked straight into the shop.

He was not afraid of Dao Hen or the mirage sea mercenary group at all.

Ao Yao’s current strength was stronger than Wang Xian’s. She could definitely fight against Dao Hen.

“Alright, what kind of pills do you want to buy, Young Master?”

Shopkeeper Liu asked respectfully. Someone who could take out eight million middle-grade spirit stones in one go must be extraordinary.

“Bring all the elixirs in your shop that can improve your cultivation!”

Wang Xian said to manager Liu directly.

“All the elixirs that can improve your cultivation? Good, good!”

Manager Liu was slightly surprised. However, he nodded immediately and led him to the back.

The elixirs that could improve one’s cultivation contained a lot more dragon crystals than those that could detoxify the poison!

Eight million spirit stones to buy these elixirs could be exchanged for five to six thousand dragon crystals according to Wang Xian’s estimation.

Five to six thousand dragon crystals was not enough to upgrade Wang Xian, but it was enough to upgrade the group of thorned dragons.

At the very least, it would be able to nurture another transcendent level four light spike.

The rest of them would be able to upgrade to transcendent level three without any problems.

“Young man, you have bought so many of our pills. I can make the decision and give you the cheapest price. I can make the decision by giving you a 10% discount!”

Shopkeeper Liu said to Wang Xian, “If this young master wants to buy pills, you can come to me. I will definitely give you the cheapest price!”

“Alright!”

Wang Xian took the bottles of pills and placed them into his interspatial ring. Then, he had an idea and asked, “Shopkeeper Liu, may I know what kind of mission your Feng Xian has issued in the hiring association?”

“Mission?”

Manager Liu’s face was filled with astonishment. “We didn’t issue many missions either. There were only three. Among them, the mission to find the Heaven Billow grass has the highest level. It’s a five-star silver mission. The remaining one is a four-star bronze mission and a five-star bronze mission!”

As manager Liu spoke, he took out a mission stone plate, pointing at it, he said, “These three missions were issued by US. However, these three missions were also issued by the life and Death Elixir workshop and other small pharmacies. Therefore, we will give them some rewards after we have completed the mission. It’s also for them to give us the mission items!”

Wang Xian nodded his head slowly. “Alright, Goodbye!”

As he spoke, he walked straight out.

“Young master, if you need anything in the future, you can come and look for me!”

Shopkeeper Liu said hurriedly.

“Don’t worry, we will meet soon!”

Wang Xian waved his hand and walked out.

At the entrance, Shopkeeper Dao Hen Qing and the people from the holy item forging workshop had not left yet.

When they saw Wang Xian coming out, they looked extremely embarrassed.

It was a business of eight million middle-grade spirit stones!

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly and left in a carefree manner.
