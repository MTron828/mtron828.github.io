Chapter 957: In the Panic of the 0958 Caravan

Translator: 549690339

“Leader Wang is really a young hero. Even in East Sea city, the younger generation is considered the top heaven’s favorites!”

In the Blackwater Swamp, Father Zhou passed Wang Xian a piece of roasted ferocious beast meat with a smile on his face as he said in a fawning manner.

“Heaven’s favorites?”

Wang Xian smiled faintly. When he came to the extraordinary mainland, he was not competing with the heaven’s favorites of this world. Instead, he was competing with the overlords of this world!

“With leader Wang’s strength, he is also very outstanding in the entire transcendence continent!”

Jin Liuyan said to him with a smile on her face.

As everyone was eating and chatting, Wang Xian smiled calmly at his praise.

“Leader, have we surrounded them or are we going to attack them directly?”

“Of course we are going to attack them directly. Why waste too much time!”

“Hehe, they won’t be able to escape in the Blackwater Swamp. Let’s finish them off as soon as possible!”

In the pitch-black darkness, the members of the Spirit Beast mercenary group were floating in mid-air. They stared at a spot a thousand meters away and said softly.

“We are already a thousand meters away. They have yet to realize that this immortal Phoenix mercenary group is also trash!”

Deputy Leader Ling looked over with a face full of mockery. He waved his hand and slowly flew toward Wang Xian and the rest.

“Dragon King!”

Wang Xian, who was eating, suddenly sensed the message sent by Ao Yao. He was slightly stunned and slowly stood up.

“Leader Wang, What’s Wrong?”

Father Zhou saw Wang Xian suddenly standing up and asked with a face full of surprise.

“Nothing. I’m taking care of a few pieces of trash. You guys can continue eating!”

Wang Xian shook his head and walked directly toward the Spirit Beast mercenary group.

“Huh?”

Father Zhou and the rest looked at Wang Xian in astonishment.

Trash?

“We’ve been discovered!”

When they were within a thousand meters of Wang Xian and the rest, an extraordinary level six powerhouse saw Wang Xian staring at them coldly. He raised his eyebrows slightly.

“So what if we’ve been discovered? Let’s get ready then!”

Deputy Captain Ling smiled and landed on the ground without a care. He took out his weapon from his interspatial ring.

The rest of the mercenaries also took out their weapons and walked towards Wang Xian and the rest proudly.

“It’s actually them? What are they here for?”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he looked at the group of people from the Spirit Beast mercenary group. A hint of coldness appeared on his face.

“Deputy Leader Ling, May I know why you are here?”

Wang Xian didn’t make a move directly. The group of people from the opposite spirit beast mercenary group walked over with a mocking look on their faces.

Both parties stopped when they were a hundred meters away. Wang Xian looked at them and asked calmly.

“Haha, it’s just a small matter!”

Deputy Leader Ling laughed and sized up Wang Xian, Ao Jian, and the rest with a smile on his face.

“May I know what’s the matter?”

Wang Xian continued to ask with an expressionless face.

“HMM, it’s not a big matter!”

Deputy Leader Ling grinned. “It’s just... killing all of you!”

He smiled with a calm expression. It was as if to him, this was an insignificant matter.

“Oh!”

Wang Xian nodded with a calm expression. “It’s indeed not a big deal!”

“Huh?”

When the people from the Spirit Beast mercenary group saw Wang Xian’s calm expression, a hint of astonishment appeared on their faces.

“Kid, it seems like you are prepared to die!”

Vice-leader ling narrowed his eyes slightly as a terrifying killing intent emanated from his body.

“He really doesn’t know death!”

Wang Xian said calmly.

“How can this kid be so calm?”

An elder from the spirit beast mercenary group saw how calm Wang Xian was and suddenly had a bad premonition. He said softly.

“Do it!”

Vice-captain Ling’s eyes flickered as he looked at the calm Wang Xian. He no longer tried to act cool. He shouted coldly and gave the order.

“PFFFT! PFFFT! PFFFT!”

The order sounded. However, his order seemed to be a death order.

As soon as he finished his sentence, a bone-piercing sound came from beside him.

He was very familiar with this sound. It was the same sound when the sharp knife entered the body of the ferocious beast.

Buzz

At the same time, at this moment, he felt a terrifying murderous aura.

Deputy Captain Ling’s expression changed drastically. An earthen yellow defense instantly appeared on his body.

PFFT

However, the armor of a transcendent level seven was easily penetrated like thin paper.

He widened his eyes in disbelief as he looked at the sharp claws that penetrated his body. Then, he slowly raised his head.

“I can easily destroy a mercenary group like yours!”

Wang Xian looked at vice-leader Ling who was in disbelief and said calmly.

“How... How is this possible?”

Vice-leader Ling opened his mouth and a hoarse voice came from his mouth.

Wang Xian shook his head slowly. There was no fluctuation in his eyes as he walked over directly.

“More than ten corpses. Not Bad!”

Wang Xian said nonchalantly. Under vice-leader Ling’s widened eyes, his subordinates were kept into his interspatial ring.

“How... how is it so strong... how is this possible?”

Vice-leader Ling couldn’t believe the ending before his eyes.

A mercenary group from Shenghai Town and a mercenary group led by a kid could actually destroy them in an instant.

In fact, that Kid didn’t even make a move!

This...

The vision in front of them gradually blurred, and their vitality slowly dissipated!

Wang Xian walked over and took off the mercenary group badges on their chests.

He looked ahead and revealed a faint smile.

“Send the badges of these mercenary groups to them later!”

Wang Xian said to a strange demon.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

A strange demon nodded, put away all the badges and disappeared!

Wang Xian turned around and left calmly.

A dozen people from the Spirit Beast mercenary group wanted to kill them?

They were really reckless!

“Leader Wang, what happened?”

Father Zhou and the rest asked with concern when they saw Wang Xian return.

“It’s nothing. Some people who are courting death have been dealt with!”

Wang Xian shook his head lightly.

“Huh?”

Father Zhou and the rest were slightly taken aback. Their faces were filled with astonishment.

When they saw Wang Xian sitting down and continuing to eat, they hesitated for a moment and did not ask further.

...

“Elder Xiao, what’s going on? It’s been almost twenty minutes. Why is vice-leader Ling and the rest still not back yet?”

At this moment, at the position of the merchant group, supervisor du frowned and whispered to elder Xiao. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“It should be delayed by something. With Vice Commander Ling and the others’strength, there shouldn’t be any problems!”

Elder Xiao also frowned and looked behind him from time to time.

“Supervisor Du, elder Xiao, it’s been half an hour. Should we continue to set off?”

Another ten minutes passed. The group of people in charge of the caravan who had rested well asked supervisor du and elder Xiao loudly.

“Wait a moment, we’ll leave immediately!”

Supervisor du had a bad premonition in his heart, and he said to them while looking at the back with a burning gaze.

“Sou Sou Sou!”

At this moment, sounds like hidden weapons were heard!
