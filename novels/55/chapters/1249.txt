Translator: 5496903

“Thousand Shadow mercenary group? Aren’t they a very low-profile mercenary group? Why are they so high-profile this time, and there are so many people?”

“So they are from the Thousand Shadow mercenary group. This thousand shadow is not weak. The entire mercenary group has three experts at the first level of the profound void tier. The leader of the mercenary group is extremely mysterious!”

“Eh? The two vice leaders of the Thousand Shadows mercenary group are here, and even the leader who rarely appears in the center is here. What are they trying to do?”

When everyone looked to the right, the Thousand Shadows mercenary group appeared in their line of sight. They were floating in the sky and wore black clothes. They gave off a murderous aura.

The Thousand Shadows mercenary group was a relatively famous mercenary group in the Ladyboy graveyard.

A three-star diamond mercenary group had three rank one void interpretation experts, and their leader was extremely mysterious.

The thousand shadow mercenary group might not seem very powerful in the various dynasties and sects, but it was definitely ranked in the top five in the demi-human graveyard.

The Thousand Shadow mercenary group had completed more than ten diamond rank missions and killed two rank one void interpretation demon beasts.

Their battle records were among the best among the mercenary groups.

Many factions wanted to rope in the thousand shadow mercenary group, but they were all rejected.

The thousand shadow mercenary group usually kept a low profile, but no faction dared to ignore them. After all, they were three profound void tier experts!

Everyone looked at the high-profile thousand shadow mercenary group in surprise, and their gazes swept over them.

That Beast Roar came from the Mount of the Thousand Shadow mercenary group’s leader, who was covered in a black robe.

It was a rhinoceros shadow beast, a half-step void interpretation rhinoceros shadow beast.

Seeing everyone looking over, the thousand shadow mercenary group slightly raised their heads and slowly walked into the arena.

All of them had a faint smile on their faces. Two middle-aged men, one on the left and the other on the right, had proud expressions on their faces.

They looked like kings as they looked around.

“HMM, who are they?”

“Could it be that Qian ye is a member of the Thousand Shadows Mercenary Group?”

Seeing them walking in with such a high profile, some of them raised their eyebrows and guessed.

Wang Xian stood in the arena and looked at the members of the Thousand Shadows mercenary group. His eyes were sparkling.

When the members of the Thousand Shadows mercenary group entered the arena, the leader of the Thousand Shadows mercenary group, who was riding on the Rhinoceros Shadow Beast, flew down from the beast.

He took a few steps forward.

At this moment, he slowly lifted the hood that covered his face, revealing a young face.

When his face was revealed in front of everyone, around the entire arena, more than 200,000 people widened their eyes, and a shocked expression slowly appeared on their faces.

“I, thousand leaves!”

As he spoke, he slightly raised his head, and an intense confidence appeared on his face. The corners of his mouth slightly curled up, and his gaze swept over the 200,000 people around the arena.

I, Qian Ye!

These three words were filled with dominance and confidence!

It was filled with an aura that transcended everything!

“The leader of the Thousand Shadow Mercenary Group!”

The following words struck heavily on everyone’s hearts.

The leader of the Thousand Shadow mercenary group!

This was his identity!

When these two domineering words spread throughout the entire heaven’s pride stage, one could hear a pin drop!

“Boom!”

But this lasted only two seconds.

Two seconds later, the top of the talent list, the pinnacle of the ring around, burst out like a tsunami-like sound. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“I carelessly carelessly carelessly carelessly... Chiba, leader of the Thousand Shadows mercenary group, Oh My God!”

“Insightful emptiness, insightful emptiness first order strong person, this is insightful emptiness first order strong person!”

“My God, Qian ye is actually the leader of the Thousand Shadows mercenary group, an expert at the first level of the insightful void realm!”

“This is not the most terrifying part. The most terrifying part is that Qian ye has such a terrifying force, the thousand shadows mercenary group. Two insightful void realm experts are willing to work for him!”

“Haha, our Senior Qian Ye is an expert at the insightful void realm. Our Senior Qian ye is the leader of the Thousand Shadows mercenary group. That nobody has no right to compare with our senior Qian Ying!”

“Long live senior Qian Ye, Long live senior Qian Ye, Senior Qian Ye is invincible!”

“A 49-year-old profound void realm expert, hiss, too terrifying. Such talent, only the sect leader of the Heavenly Sword sect more than a hundred years ago could reach it, and the current sect leader of the Sword Whisper sect is already one of the top experts in the flowing sea region!”

“Shocking, too shocking. My God, who would have thought that Qian ye is the leader of the Thousand Shadows mercenary group? Who would have thought that he has already stepped into the profound void realm!”

Everyone’s faces were filled with shock as they looked at Qian Ye, who was floating in front of them. Their eyes were filled with disbelief.

The students of the Divine Wind Academy were even crazily roaring. Their faces were filled with excitement.

Qian ye’s strength and Qian Ye’s identity caused everyone to be shocked.

“Haha, just a moment ago, all of you were still shouting that nameless was invincible. You even said that nameless could crush our senior Qian Ye. What about now? All of you continue to be arrogant!”

“That’s right, those bunch of dog-licking dogs who support nameless, are you all going to F * cking bark again? Haha, isn’t this a slap in the face? A slap in the face!”

“A mere nobody still wants to compete with our senior thousand leaves. This is simply the light of a grain of rice vying for the splendor of the Bright Moon, Haha!”

At this moment, the students of the Divine Wind Academy thought of the humiliation they had suffered in the past two days, and all of them raised their heads and shouted at the youths around them.

They had vented their anger!

After seeing senior Qian Ye’s strength and influence, they could only use the light of a grain of rice to compare with the radiance of the Bright Moon.

Even if the nameless prodigy was extremely monstrous, at the moment, at least, he did not have the qualifications to be compared to their senior Qian Ye.

When the rest of the people saw the arrogant expressions of the students of the Divine Wind Academy, their expressions changed. When they saw that figure, they could not help but exclaim in their hearts.

They had misjudged Qian Ye. They had not expected Qian ye to be so terrifying.

“Qian Ye, the King of Heaven’s Pride!”

“Qian Ye, the King of Heaven’s Pride!”

A student from the divine wind academy shouted loudly. The rest of the students echoed in agreement.

Very quickly, the entire arena was filled with this voice.

It was even louder than the nameless voice that had shouted earlier.

When Qian ye saw this scene, a faint smile appeared on his face. This was the effect he wanted.

Under everyone’s gaze, he waved his hand indifferently, indicating for the shouting to stop.

And when the person who shouted saw this action of his, he also took the initiative to stop. Each and every one of them looked at him with respect and shock.

“This time, i, Qian Ye, am not here to accept the challenge. I want to announce that our thousand shadow mercenary group will be recruiting elite members for the next period of time!”

“We need stronger companions. Here, I sincerely invite every elite warrior to join our thousand shadow mercenary group!”

As Qian ye said this, a faint smile appeared on his face.

He directly said that he wasn’t here to accept the challenge!

He didn’t put the top ranker of the prodigy roll in his eyes at all!

He also didn’t put nameless in his eyes!
