3823 Under the improvement of the 3822 demonic dragon species

“If this place can help the demonic dragon species improve rapidly, the strength of the middle level of the dragon palace will be replenished!”

Lan qingyue smiled as she looked at the leader of the demonic dragon species who was improving rapidly.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

The improvement of the demonic dragon species was very important to the Dragon Palace.

“I plan to stay here for the next period of time. Qingyue, you should stay here as well. We will continue to explore after the Tai Chi Dragon Disc has recovered and the succubus dragon seed has received a huge improvement.”

Wang Xian said to Lan Qingyue.

The Tai Chi Dragon Disc was broken. It would take a long time to recover!

He needed to recover.

Besides, they couldn’t just leave the charm dragon seed here and leave.

Once they left, the group of Charm Dragon Seeds wouldn’t be able to withstand the attacks of the space beasts! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Therefore, Wang Xian had to stay here.

“Alright!”

Lan qingyue nodded with a smile.

“All the charm dragon seeds, first absorb and fuse all the space beasts that are bred here. Then, upgrade the position where the space beasts are bred. In addition, for those with the Black Resurrection Lily, place the resurrection Lily beside you and allow it to absorb energy as well!”

Wang Xian immediately gave the order!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The 1,000 charming dragon species responded immediately!

They immediately absorbed and fused the space beasts that were being bred in this domain!

Boom

Not long after, a wave of power came from the leader of the charming dragon species!

Wang Xian looked over and smiled.

“The speed of the breakthrough is really terrifying!”

He couldn’t help but sigh.

This time, their luck was pretty good.

They encountered this area.

“Xiao Xian, the energy in this area is very similar to the energy in the body of the spirit red bone.”

At this moment, Lan Qingyue suddenly spoke.

“HMM? Now that you mention it, it’s indeed so. It’s somewhat similar!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows.

Ling Honggu possessed the inheritance of the Scarlet Queen. Her body contained two attributes, fire and darkness.

When these two attributes were fused together, it was indeed similar to the energy in Ling Honggu’s body.

“I’ll contact her and ask if she can come over!”

Wang Xian looked at Lan Qingyue and said to her.

“You can just contact her. Hehe, Miss Ling Honggu is pretty good. She has also helped our Dragon Palace before. In addition, she has great potential. Shu Qing and the rest will not object if she can come to our Dragon Palace!”

“Besides, Our Dragon King has been much more obedient in the past few million years!”

Lan qingyue teased him.

Compared to the past when Wang Xian brought along a dragon queen from time to time, it was indeed much better than the past!

Wang Xian smiled embarrassedly. He took out his communication stone plate and sent a message to Ling Honggu.

“If Honggu comes over, I will go and pick her up. It’s still rather dangerous here!”

Lan Qingyue added.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“HMM?”

At the same time, in a corner of the starry universe, a group of skeleton clan’s powerhouses had gathered together.

With the appearance of the belief universe, the skeleton clan had also established a hunting squad.

This hunting squad had the strength of at least a master of level two and above. The leader of the squad was three skeleton clan’s masters of Level Seven!

The entire squad had 200 experts at the ruler realm.

Among the peak races, there were more experts at the ruler realm in the skeleton clan.

These experts at the ruler realm, in addition to their skeleton army, were a terrifying force.

Ling Honggu was also selected as a member of the hunting squad!

Initially, she didn’t want to join, but since her grandfather’s king was chosen, she could only follow him.

The sudden news of Wang Xian surprised Ling Honggu. When he saw it, his eyes flickered.

“Grandfather, Wang Xian said that they have found a powerful treasure land. It will be of great help to my advancement. He asked me if I should go there!”

Ling Honggu spoke to the Black Vulture King!

“HMM? The Dragon King contacted you on his own accord? He found a treasure land?”

The black vulture king was slightly taken aback, followed by an excited look in his eyes.

“Of course I agree. To be able to make the Dragon King call it a treasure land, it’s definitely not simple.”

The black vulture king immediately said, “I’ll inform the injured King about the hunt. He won’t reject it!”

“Yes, Great Grandpa!”

Ling honggu nodded and replied to Wang Xian.

“The Azure Moon Dragon Queen of the Dragon Palace will come to pick me up in a while!”

Ling honggu read the message and replied again!

“Oh? The Azure Moon Dragon Queen, the ancient god who feeds the Kun master, the Azure Moon Dragon Queen?”

The black vulture king was slightly shocked and his eyes glowed.

The ancient god who feeds the Kun master, the Azure Moon Dragon Queen, was now a well-known figure in the nine-origin universe!

It had three Kun masters and could easily kill a group of angels and Phoenixes who were at level seven.

Together with the ancient inheritance of the kun-level masters, he would definitely be one of the most terrifying existences below the heavenly Yuan realm.

Such a person came to pick up his granddaughter, which made the black vulture king even more excited!

“Yes, I spent some time with Qing Yue and the other Dragon Queens.”

Ling Honggu nodded with a smile on his face.

“Right now, in the universe, the Dragon Palace is the strongest. The grotto-heaven they occupy is definitely much stronger than the other peak races. You should cultivate there and improve quickly.”

The black vulture king said excitedly.

He moved and came to the front of a level seven master of the skeleton race and told them about this.

The Skeleton King called the injury king looked at the red spirit bone in surprise and naturally didn’t stop him.

They knew that the relationship between the red spirit bone and the Black Vulture King was good!

However, this relationship was better than what they had imagined!

Shang Wang congratulated the black vulture king and immediately agreed.

…

“Xiao Xian, Miss Honggu is here!”

A year later, Lan Qingyue brought Ling Honggu over and said to him with a smile.

“She’s here, Honggu. Come and see if the energy here can be absorbed.”

Wang Xian looked at Ling Honggu and said with a smile.

“HMM, the energy here is indeed similar to the energy in my body!”

Ling honggu nodded with a smile. Then, he came to the location of a deep pit and sensed it.

“It’s indeed possible. I can feel a terrifying energy gushing into my body from below and converting it into my own energy. The speed of my improvement here can be improved tremendously.”

Ling Honggu said excitedly.

“Then, you can cultivate here. There is enough energy here.”

Wang Xian smiled.

The Dragon Palace could only absorb the energy of the charming dragon species. Basically, it would be difficult to exhaust it.

In the following period of time, Wang Xian and the rest stayed here.

What surprised Wang Xian was that in just a few years, all 1,000 charming dragon species had broken through to the Dominator realm.

This improvement could be described as terrifying!

Of course, this was also related to the fact that all the species of charming dragons had reached the peak of the venerable realm.
