Chapter 1561: The 1561 heavenly demon appeared 7

“Ahhhh!”

At this moment, a scream was heard from the center.

“I’m not willing, I’m not willing. Why did you kill them all? !”

A voice filled with unwillingness and fear came from within. In the center of the huge chain, the terrifying dragon claws and dragon heads attacked the fire giants, light giants, and the terrifying dark shadow.

Every strike was destructive.

With the Black Dragon Pearl of the eighth level of the Seethrough, Wang Xian’s strength was equivalent to a weaker Seethrough eighth level powerhouse.

Facing more than 20 Seethrough seventh level powerhouses, he could totally crush them.

In fact, they didn’t even have the chance to escape.

Screams of pain rang out as the Seethrough seventh level powerhouses fell one after another.

Seventh-level insightful void martial artists, seventh-level insightful void martial artists who could establish a second-rate force.

Now, they actually fell one by one.

In the past few hundred years, there hadn’t been so many seventh-level insightful void martial artists who had fallen.

All of this was because of the three sword spirit herbs.

If they said it out loud, everyone might not believe it.

But he was a sky demon, so it was possible.

Because this was the most powerful and terrifying devil in the vast region.

Ling Jian ‘er stood in a daze as she watched the battle from afar. Every death of a seventh level profound void tier expert caused her heart to beat violently.

Her eyes flickered with a special light as she looked at that terrifying and majestic creature.

She knew that he wasn’t doing it for the sword spirit grass in her hands. He was doing it to save her.

“Who is he? What is his relationship with that priest Wang? Why are the two figures so familiar?”

Questions popped up in Ling Jian ‘ER’s mind. She thought of the first time she met that priest Wang.

She thought of the statue that appeared at her door every day.

Her eyes were a little lost.

Bing Jian ‘er? Ling Jian ‘er? Father? Wang Xian?

Names flashed across her mind one by one.

“Ah!”

At this moment, the last scream was heard. The 25th expert of the seventh level of the Seethrough realm had died.

Wang Xian’s dragon eyes scanned the corpses below him coldly without any emotion.

He moved his body and transformed into a human. With a wave of his arm, he kept all the corpses into his interspatial ring.

Wang Xian looked to the left and stared at the experts from the various forces in the vast area.

“Those who provoke me will die!”

He said faintly. His figure flashed and disappeared into the void.

“This sky demon is really arrogant!”

When the old man from the solipsistic sect heard Wang Xian’s words, a hint of coldness appeared on his face.

“Go Back!”

However, he didn’t say anything. The solipsistic sect wasn’t willing to provoke such a crazy person for no reason.

The rest of the powerhouses from the other factions also went back in silence and reported what happened here.

“Hiss, it’s too terrifying. That person is simply too terrifying. Oh My God...”

“He killed our clan elder just because of a disagreement. This...”

“That person is too brutal and bloody. He didn’t leave a single one alive. He actually didn’t leave a single one alive!”

Seeing Wang Xian’s figure disappear, everyone who was more than 20 kilometers away was filled with astonishment.

Just because of three pieces of sword heart grass, 25 decision-makers at the seventh level of the Seethrough realm had died!

This was too bloody and violent!

Ling Jian ‘ER stood in the air in a daze. Her body moved and she flew out quickly.

Everyone around was still in shock. They did not realize that Ling Jian ‘er had left unscathed from the beginning to the end.

“Phew, a single battle actually caused the light and dark to lose their balance by 20% !”

Wang Xian, who was hiding in the void and following Ling Jian ‘er, shook his head slowly. It would take at least half a month for the light and dark to regain their balance.

“However, my level can already be raised!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with excitement.

After destroying the ancient demon city, the spiritual herbs he obtained from the Black Curtain Garden, as well as the resources in the interspatial rings of these twenty-five level seven insightful void martial artists, were enough to level up his level by one level.

There were even quite a few remaining resources.

He followed Ling Jian ‘er all the way to the courtyard where she lived. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Are you still around?”

All of a sudden, Ling Jian ‘er looked around and shouted softly.

When Wang Xian saw Ling Jian ‘er calling out to him, he was slightly stunned. A look of hesitation appeared on his face.

“I... I’m really Ling Jian ‘er? Why don’t I remember anything?”

Ling Jian ‘er revealed a look of confusion and continued to shout to the surroundings.

Wang Xian was delighted. However, he hesitated for a moment and still didn’t show himself.

He couldn’t let Ling Jian ‘er think that he was a voyeur. Moreover, given Ling Jian ‘ER’s current stage of forgetfulness, it wouldn’t be so easy for her to be in love again.

He had to wait for a while and appear when Ling Jian ‘ER’s emotions were at their peak.

Then, Hehe!

Wang Xian smiled and moved his body, leaning against the dark corner of the roof.

Ling Jian ‘er stood there for a while and returned to her room immediately after waiting for no reply.

She looked at the sword heart grass in her interspatial ring and was in a daze.

“It’s time to raise my level!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he took out the spiritual herbs and pills from his interspatial ring and threw them into his mouth.

One by one, the spiritual herbs and pills were immediately converted into dragon qi.

The number that required a huge amount of dragon qi was increasing at a terrifying speed.

“Ding! Congratulations to host for breaking through in your level. As you have comprehended the strongest aspect of the five elements, the five elements grinding has further strengthened and strengthened your dragon body!”

“Ding, congratulations to the host for understanding the dharma aspect, dragon body of ten thousand Li!”

“Ding! Congratulations to the host for understanding the aspect, Abyssal Dragon!”

There was a cracking sound coming from Wang Xian’s body, and a powerful energy was coming from his body.

He was lying on the roof with his eyes closed as he sensed the information about his upgrade. A faint smile appeared on his face.

“With the upgrade of my level, I can definitely fight against or even kill a powerhouse at level eight of the Seethrough Realm!”

“Also, is that Abyss demonic dragon a summoning-type Dharma Idol?”

Wang Xian thought to himself as a smile appeared on his face.

He was confident that he would be able to resolve Ling Jian ‘ER’s matter very soon.

It wouldn’t take long for the light and dark to blend together. Coupled with the increase in his strength, he was in a good mood.

In the room, Ling Jian ‘er took out the sword heart grass and began to absorb it slowly.

A spiritual grass of the eighth level of the void interpretation was equivalent to a medicinal pill of the seventh level of the void interpretation. to a cultivator of the second level of the void interpretation, it was a treasure that could increase one’s strength.

Cultivating the heartless sword principle was equivalent to Ling Jian ‘ER who had a complete inheritance. It would be very easy for her to break through.
