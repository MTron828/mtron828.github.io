Chapter 2974: , under the race at the center of the universe

“I once entered a study room here and found some books with the words at the center of the universe on them.”

“Presumably, these words have always been used by the center of the universe. However, I don’t know whether it’s a good thing or a bad thing for us to come into contact with the Great Beings at the center of the Universe!”

Desolation God Emperor glanced at the surrounding God emperors and said.

“There’s nothing worse than our current situation!”

The emperor master looked at the desolate god Emperor and said.

“Okay!”

The desolate god Emperor nodded. He was very clear about it.

However, he was a little hesitant to communicate with the great beings in the center of the universe.

He waved his arm and immediately wrote a line of words in the void.

“Oh? Brother Yang Feng, those people wrote a line of words here, asking us to break the array?”

On the opposite side, the universe race’s three eyed race’s deacon Yang Xiao Hun said to the middle-aged man beside him.

“This is the border of the Mo Han clan’s race. There aren’t many people here, so how can there be humans on the other side? It looks like their strength isn’t too strong!”

The three eyed race’s deacon Yang Feng frowned as he looked at the desolate god Emperor and the others.

“It might be the humans from the star field that the Mohan clan used to belong to, a star field at the edge of the universe.”

Yang Xiao Hun muttered.

“The humans on the other side? They are so weak and they are in a remote area of the Mohan clan. They shouldn’t have any treasures. Don’t bother about them!”

Yang Feng said and turned around to leave.

“Desolate god Emperor, those two experts want to leave. Don’t let them leave. Don’t let them leave!”

On the opposite side, the Emperor Master saw the two three-eyed race experts wanting to leave and shouted anxiously.

“How can we make them not leave?”

Desolate god Emperor was also somewhat anxious.

“The Divine Dragon said that we have a divine dragon that has just grown here. The Divine Dragon is considered a peak race in the universe void space. If they knew that we have a divine dragon here, they would definitely be moved.”

The emperor master immediately said.

Three years ago, he had already thought of how to talk to the races in the center of the universe.

Godly Dragon, a pinnacle race in the universe.

As long as they said that they had a godly dragon here, and it was a weak godly dragon, no great being would not be curious and not be moved.

“Good, good!”

Desolate god Emperor’s eyes also flashed with a glimmer of light, and he immediately wrote a line of words in front of him.

“Oh?”

At this moment, Yang Xiaohun, who was still looking over, was slightly stunned when he saw this line of words. Shock appeared in his eyes.

“Brother Yang, quickly look. Quickly look!”

Yang Xiaohun cried out involuntarily to Yang Feng as he pointed at the line of words written by the desolate divine emperor within the array.

“What? Divine Dragon?”

Yang Feng’s pupils shrunk slightly when he saw this line of words. His expression changed drastically.

On the opposite side, the desolate divine emperor saw their expressions change, and he revealed an excited expression.

“Weng!”

The desolate divine emperor immediately waved his arm and drew a picture of the wind god Dragon in front of him. He then continued to write a line of words.

“In our area, there is the legendary wind god Dragon. Their strength is only at the second or third level of the Divine Emperor Realm. They want to kill us. Please save us!”

“The wind god Dragon is one of the top races in the universe. I know that he is very important to all of you.”

A line of words floated in front of them.

“That is?”

Yang Feng and Yang Xiao Hun glanced at the line of words. Their eyes were fixed on the picture of the Wind God Dragon. Their eyes were shining.

As the center of the universe, they were very clear about the dominant races.

They were also very clear about the Battle of destruction between the Divine Dragon and the bug race a few hundred million years ago.

At the center of the universe, there were very clear records of the Divine Dragon Race.

They also knew all the divine dragons.

That pattern was the wind divine dragon of the Divine Dragon Race.

Even if it wasn’t a purebred divine dragon, it still belonged to the Divine Dragon.

They were very, very clear about the power of the Divine Dragon.

In fact, in the center of the universe, there were still dragon gods, and there were currently nine more famous dragon God races.

The Strongest Dragon God race had already reached the level of the universe’s primary race.

In the center of the universe, there was a place where tens of thousands of races stood, a place where tens of thousands of races competed for hegemony.

Here, each race was divided into six levels according to their strength.

Races, domain level races, universe primary races, universe intermediate races, universe high-level races, Universe Overlord races.

Races were unrated races, like the three-eyed race.

There were many races, more than tens of thousands of them?

They were at the lowest level in the center of the universe.

And the Dragon God race was once a universe overlord race, also known as The Pinnacle Race.

There were very, very few dominant races.

Hundreds of millions of years ago, the Dragon God and the bug race ended in a battle, and all the pure-blooded dragons died in battle. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

But there were still some living beings with the Dragon God bloodline.

They experienced great opportunities, purified their bloodline, carried out atavism, and gradually became pure-blooded dragons.

The Dragon God’s figure slowly appeared again on the stage in the center of the universe.

However, according to what they knew, the Divine Dragon was now divided into nine great races. Each race did not submit to the other, and there was even a war.

Moreover, because of the fall of the Divine Dragon Clan’s powerhouses, even if the current Divine Dragon Clan was a pure-blooded divine dragon, they did not have the inheritance of the Divine Dragon. This resulted in some of the Dragons with the Divine Dragon bloodline.., or perhaps the dragons that had accidentally reverted back to their ancestors and evolved into pure-blooded divine dragons became the mounts of some powerhouses.

Dragon Knights, when the Divine Dragon Clan was still alive, there were also existences of this level.

Every Dragon Knight was a powerful being that shook the entire universe.

However, at that time, if one wanted to become a purebred divine Dragon Dragon Dragon Knight, there was only one way, and that was for the divine dragon to voluntarily become your steed.

If you had the favor of that Divine Dragon, the divine dragon would repay the favor and become your steed.

Otherwise, forcing the Dragon God to become your mount would be courting death. No powerhouse in the universe would dare to force it.

Now, it was different. Many Dragon Knights had appeared.

Although everyone understood that they weren’t True Dragon Knights, having a dragon god Mount and a dragon God bloodline mount was also a symbol of strength and status.

And the group of people opposite them actually said that there was a dragon God in their space.

How could Yang Feng and Yang Xiao Hun of the three-eyed race not be shocked.

Even if it wasn’t a purebred divine dragon, it still made their hearts burn.

If it could be used as a mount…

However, they quickly gave up on the idea of being a mount. If other experts were to find out, they would definitely kill and snatch the mount.

Secondly, a dragon with the Divine Dragon bloodline was stronger than their three-eyed race no matter how weak it was.

The three-eyed race only belonged to the race.

However, they had now received news about the Divine Dragon.

The two of them looked at each other, and their breathing was slightly hurried.

“Do you really have a divine dragon there? Do you know the consequences of deceiving us?”

Yang Feng waved his arm, and a line of words immediately appeared in front of him.

“They responded, they responded!”

Seeing this sentence, the barren divine emperor and the others showed an extremely excited look.
