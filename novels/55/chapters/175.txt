Chapter 176: Heart-Shaped Blood Coral

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“Brother, aren’t you going to auction some items? If you are, hurry up!”

Xiao Yu reminded Wang Xian as he saw him pondering. There had been five to six people who had gone up to trade their items.

Hmm!

After Wang Xian recovered, he looked forward as a well-suited magnate walked down the auction stage

Just as he was about to stand up, Liu Feiyun from Table 8 stood up before him.

It was obvious that he did not get anything he wanted from the auction previously, evident from his bleak expression

As Liu Feiyun walked up to the stage, he looked at Lan Qingyue before looking around. His gaze eventually stopped at Lingyue Sect and The Zhou Jewelry.

He took out an exquisite box from his pocket and opened it

“I believe all of you can guess what the item I’ll be trading away is. Yes, this is one of the petals from the Ethereal Flower. Its value can match that of a Level 3 spiritual medicine. I want to trade this for any jewelry. Any type of jewelry will do as long as its value matches that of this petal. Those from The Zhou Jewelry and Lingyue Sect, do you want to trade?”

As Liu Feiyun spoke, he started to grin, and a slight sense of domination could be felt from him.

“Ke Ke, I did not expect that Liu’s Family to come up with such a precious item to support Deep-sea Jewelry. It seems like we will be facing off against them directly in the near future.” A middle-aged man from Lingyue spoke indifferently as he looked at Liu Feiyun with a smile.

Liu Feiyun looked towards Lingyue and replied calmly, “Now that the Deep Sea Jewelry has the support from our Liu’s Family, no one can take advantage of them easily.”

“Haha. Great. In that case, we will like to give it a try! Liu Family of the Tyrannical Sword? Tsk!” The middle-aged man from Lingyue Sect snorted.

There was tension in the air.

Liu Feiyun was undaunted. At this moment, he seemed domineering and indeed lived up to his name of the Little Sword Celestial.

“Everyone, I’ll be trading Level 3 Spiritual Medicine for jewelry of equivalent value, if you have such jewelry, you may come forward to trade. If you don’t have it now, you can come to the Liu Family in the future for trade.

Liu Feiyun repeated himself before turning to Lan Qingyue. After which, he left the stage with a delighted expression

He believed that his actions would definitely move Lan Qingyue.

“Lingyue Sect is supporting The Zhou Jewelry and now, the Liu Family is supporting Deep-sea Jewelry. This is going to be interesting.”

“The Zhou Jewelry has the support from a First-class Force. Deep-sea Jewelry has to react and find a strong cooperation partner. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be a match at all!”

“Trading Spiritual Herbs for Jewelry, from what is seems, Liu’s Family is giving great support for Deep-sea Jewelry, in the future, they might just have a chance against Zhou’s Family Jewelry!”

Wang Xian pondered as he overheard these conversations of the crowd. It seems that the Lan’s Family might have run into some crisis.

After Liu Feiyun exited, Wang Xian stood up immediately and walked towards the auction stage.

Everyone’s attention was on him as they waited in anticipation to see what he would be taking out for trade.

Below the stage, Lan Qingyue was staring at Wang Xian blankly.

Liu Feiyun looked at Wang Xian with a heavy expression on his face. Glimmers flashed in his eyes.

“I’m selling a few things.”

Wang Xian smiled as he spoke, he then took out four exquisite Blood Corals.

“Blood Corals, a type of precious gemstones from the seas. There are four of them here and one of them is...”

As Wang Xian spoke, he lifted one of them to show it to the crowd. “A heart-shaped blood coral that is formed naturally. I believe that the value of this would be very high. I’m selling all of these and accepting only cash!”

“Wow, these Blood Coral are so stunning!”

“Four blood corals with two of them likely weighing four to five catties. These are valuable!”

“Naturally-formed heart-shaped blood coral! That blood coral is simply breath-taking. It also has a branch that looks just like a red line. It’s beautiful!” [1]

“Blood corals are often regarded as precious gems that aren’t inferior to diamonds. These four blood corals would likely be worth more than $300-400 million!”

Below the stage, the crowd exclaimed.

Bang!

At this moment, a middle-aged woman from The Zhou Jewelry stood up with eyes beaming with desire as she stared at the heart-shaped blood coral.

Heart-shaped Blood Coral and one that is formed naturally!

Using just this as a marketing gimmick would be enough to bring huge fame for The Zhou Jewelry.

In fact, if the publicity was done well, the heart-shaped blood coral would enable The Zhou Jewelry to make its way to the top rankings of jewelry companies in the entire world.

Naturally formed blood corals that had auspicious symbolism weren’t something that emerald gemstone could compete.

Lan Qingyue also stared fervently at the heart-shaped blood coral in Wang Xian hands. She clenched her fist tightly.

“$400 million. The Zhou Jewelry will be taking all these blood corals!”

The middle-aged lady from The Zhou Jewelry shouted as she stared at the Blood Corals on the stage

“$420 million!” Lan Qingyue shouted without any hesitation

“$450 million!” The middle-aged woman had no hesitation either.

“Give us those blood corals and our Liu Family will ensure you a life of wealth and fame!” Liu Feiyun said to Wang Xian as he saw the competition that involved Lan Qingyue.

“Do he need the Liu Family to give him a life of wealth and fame?” A middle-aged man from Lingyue Sect stood up immediately and continued, “Sell them to us and you will get the friendship of Lingyue Sect.”

“I’ll forgive you for offending me previously. You can also use these blood corals to exchange for Level 3 spiritual medicine from the Liu Family. I’ll give you five petals of the Ethereal Flower!”

Liu Feiyun ignored the middle-aged man and remarked coldly.

“My friend, you’ve got to think this through. Sell it to us and the Lingyue Sect will ensure your safety. You won’t have to worry about others taking revenge on you!”

Sensing the aggression towards Wang Xian from Lingyue Sect and Liu Feiyun, Lan Qingyue frowned slightly and said to Liu Feiyun, “Young Master Liu, I can compete for this on my own. I don’t need the Liu Family to help me!”

“It’s alright, Qingyue, leave this to me. I will definitely get those blood corals for you!” Liu Feiyun replied confidently.

Lan Qingyue frowned further as she looked at Wang Xian. She increased her bid once again, “$500 million.”

The value of these blood corals has exceeded my expectations!

Wang Xian was slightly shocked at the development. He turned his gaze to Lingyue Sect and Liu Feiyun and a cold light flashed in his eyes.

An auction is an auction. Trying to threaten me?

“We have a deal!” Wang Xian said as he looked at Lan Qingyue.

Lan Qingyue was stunned but revealed a faint smile.

“Haha. You are a smart person. This is a wise decision.” Liu Feiyun laughed heartily and remarked as he saw Wang Xian selling these blood corals to them.

He then looked at Lingyue Sect with a taunting expression.

“Hmmpf!” The middle-aged man from Lingyue snorted as he looked at Wang Xian.

“Haha, you are interested in Level 3 spiritual medicine?” Liu Feiyun looked arrogantly at Wang Xian and asked.

“I didn’t say I was selling them to you. Furthermore, what use do I have for those five petals? To rear bees?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

When Wang Xian saw the arrogant looks of Liu Feiyun, he wasn’t pleased at all. He didn’t know why he always found him extremely annoying.

Wang Xian’s words shocked the surrounding crowd. What just happened?

“Brat, what are you saying? Level 3 spiritual medicine! Do you know the value of Level 3 spiritual medicine? Insolent brat!”

When Liu Feiyun heard him, his face darkened instantly.
