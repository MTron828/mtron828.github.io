“This young man is not simple!”

Long Xiaotian and the rest did not stay in Wang Xian’s courtyard for long. When they walked out, the white-haired old man in the middle turned his head to take a look and said faintly.

“Brother Wang Xian is very mysterious and his beast taming skills are also very powerful. I feel that his strength should not be weaker than the first level of the Seethrough Void Stage!”

Long Xiaotian nodded with a smile and continued, “Second Grandpa, this is not considered a violation of the rules, right? It is not considered borrowing other powers, right?”

“Hehe, it doesn’t count, it doesn’t count!”

The white-haired old man shook his head with a smile. “You are lucky to be able to know this friend of yours.”

After he finished speaking, he was silent for a few seconds before he continued, “There is a high chance for you to seize this opportunity!”

“Yes, Second Grandpa. I will definitely do it!”

When Long Xiaotian heard the white-haired old man’s words, a hint of excitement flashed across his eyes. His gaze was firm as he hurriedly said.

“Haha, Work Hard. Your other brothers aren’t bad either!”

The white-haired old man laughed loudly and patted his shoulder. He said earnestly, “If you can bring that young man to your side, your assessment this time is basically stable!”

“Even if he doesn’t follow you, with his help, you have a very high chance!”

The surrounding middle-aged elders were extremely excited when they saw what the white-haired old man said to Long Xiaotian.

The white-haired old man was one of the few decision makers in the selection of the crown prince.

They were all experts of the light dragon royal family’s older generation. Even the king had to call the old man uncle when he saw him.

The older generation formed a fair and impartial jury to monitor the fairness of all the Princes’assessments.

With them monitoring, nothing would go wrong. The princes could forget about borrowing other powers.

This time, Long Xiaotian wanted to get his mother’s family to buy all the weapons and armor in Wang Xian’s hands.

However, this matter was related to his mother’s family. He called over this white-haired elder, who was also his second grandpa.

“Xiaotian, work hard!”

The other four middle-aged elders were from long Xiaotian’s mother’s family. His mother’s family was also one of the best in the Luminous Dragon Empire.

If Long Xiaotian could reach the top, his mother’s family would also receive huge benefits.

“Okay!”

Long Xiaotian nodded his head heavily.

...

“The energy contained in the body of a fourth-level void interpretation expert is really terrifying. I’m definitely not a match for that old man!”

Wang Xian watched as long Xiaotian and the rest left. His eyes flickered.

“If I can master the combination of the five elements and become a divine dragon, I should be able to defeat him!”

With this thought in his mind, Wang Xian took out some food and fed it to Ling Zilin and the blood evil turtle.

“Awoo!”

At this moment, a familiar cry was heard. Wang Xian raised his head and looked at the wall.

As expected, Ling Jian ‘er, who was dressed in white, was hugging Xiao Ha who was trying to break free. She looked at him.

“Hey Beauty, you can just knock on the door. It’s very impolite for you to stand on the wall!”

Wang Xian looked at her and said in a slightly speechless manner.

Ling Jian ‘ER’s eyelashes fluttered when she heard her words.

“Here, this is the remaining spiritual liquid. I Don’t Owe You Anymore!”

With a cold expression, she threw a bottle of spiritual liquid and said to him.

“Huh? Didn’t you say you don’t want it? Return it to me?” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Wang Xian looked at her and said in astonishment.

However, the Cold Ling Jian ‘er ignored him and turned around to leave.

“Hehe, you really have a personality!”

Wang Xian looked at the spiritual liquid in his hand and kept it. He would be a fool not to keep it.

“Let’s return to the Heaven’s pride stage. Let’s quickly break through the heaven’s pride roll and think of a way to continue earning spiritual liquid!”

Wang Xian’s figure moved and flew out.

“Eh?”

However, when Wang Xian flew out, he bumped into Ling Jian ‘ER.

“Awoo!”

Xiao Ha also saw Wang Xian and shouted at him.

Ling Jian ‘er turned her head and a hint of doubt flashed in her eyes.

“Are you going to the Heaven’s Pride Stage?”

Wang Xian looked at her and greeted her.

“Yes!”

She nodded coldly and remained silent for a while. “Are you going there too?”

“Yes, I heard that the Heaven’s pride bridge will appear there and there will be a selection for the supreme talents. I’m going there to watch the Show!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“With your strength, if you ascend to The Prodigy stage, you will be able to obtain a good ranking!”

Ling Jian ‘ER’s eyes sparkled as she looked at him.

“Me? I Can’t. I heard that the competition on the prodigy roll is very intense now. A 26-year-old young man is ranked 13th. He’s really amazing. He’s simply too handsome!”

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly as he said shamelessly.

“Really? You Can’t do it?”

Wang Xian didn’t notice that Ling Jian ‘ER’s eyes were filled with disdain when she heard his words.

She was already certain that this fellow was sword demon.

He could kill two powerhouses at the first level of the Seethrough Void Tier, yet he still said that he couldn’t do it?

Men were really shameless!

“No, no, I’m just going to join in the fun. Ling Jian ‘ER is a beauty. She’s actually ranked fourth on the prodigy roll. TSK, TSK, I’m envious!”

Since he had nothing to do, Wang Xian was full of nonsense.

“HMPH!”

Ling Jian ‘er snorted. He didn’t expect that the extremely cold sword demon in front of the sword mansion would be so shameless.

The two of them flew towards the Heaven’s pride stage. Wang Xian and Ling Jian ‘ER would occasionally exchange a few words. Although it wasn’t nutritious, it was still much better than walking alone.

When they arrived at the Heaven’s pride stage, Wang Xian informed Ling Jian ‘er before he left and flew towards the Heaven’s Pride Pavilion.

The tea leaves in the heaven’s pride pavilion were not bad. He was prepared to buy some and drink them in the room where he took them back to the Heaven’s pride stage.

Ling Jian ‘er watched as he left and looked at the Heaven’s Pride Roll!

“Nameless?”

She looked at the name ranked 13th and mumbled, her face revealing a thoughtful expression.

“Ling Jian ‘er, you really made it easy for me to find you!”

At this moment, a cold voice suddenly sounded from the side.

Ling Jian ‘er turned her head around coldly and saw more than 30 people walking towards him. Her eyes flickered with a cold luster.

Walking in the middle was Han Mingshan, who was dressed in blue. Beside him was Han Ming Qing, who was ranked seventh on the prodigy roll!

Around them were a group of elite disciples from the Hanhai dynasty.

Among the thirty over people, the weakest was at the seventh level of the transcendent realm, while the ninth level of the transcendent realm was around ten.

Han Mingshan held a water spirit pearl that contained a powerful energy in his hand and played with it.

“So it’s a bunch of trash from the Hanhai Dynasty!”

Ling Jian ‘ER’s gaze swept across the crowd as she spoke directly with a face full of disdain.

“Hehe, Ling Jian ‘er, you’re too arrogant. A few days ago, you killed over a dozen disciples of our Hanhai dynasty. Today, I’ll make you pay a heavy price!”

Han Mingshan’s expression turned cold as he stared at Ling Jian ‘er as he spoke with a flickering gaze.

“The heavy price, with just you?”

Ling Jian ‘er looked at them all, there was no trace of fear on his face.
