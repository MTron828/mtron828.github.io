Chapter 1432: The 1432 factions gathered

The name of the Supreme Genius, Wang Xian, was known by everyone in the entire demi-human graveyard.

He had the ability to kill a level five seeping void martial artist, a peerless genius.

When the few people in the main hall heard this name, they were slightly shocked.

“Yes, sir. That Supreme Genius, Wang Xian, is with the dragon and Phoenix Empire!”

The middle-aged man who came to report said respectfully.

“This...”

The middle-aged men frowned slightly. They knew very well that the dragon and Phoenix Empire had two powerhouses at level five of the Seethrough void tier.

However, they did not expect that the other person, Lord Wang, who was at level five of the Seethrough Void Tier, was actually a supreme prodigy. Furthermore, he had followed them here this time.

Wouldn’t that mean that the two powerhouses at level five of the Seethrough Void tier from the Dragon and Phoenix Empire were here.

This would be a little difficult to deal with!

“Supreme prodigy, I’m really envious. I used more than 400 years to reach the fifth level of the profound void tier, and the other party reached it before the age of 30, TSK TSK!”

The middle-aged man in the middle of the blood-red clothes sipped his tea and said.

“Your Highness, in My Heart, you are the most powerful. Hehe, what do you mean by ‘Prodigy’? Strength is strength. Our Highness is not weaker than that brat!”

Beside the middle-aged man in blood-red clothes, a beautiful woman leaned against the middle-aged man with a smile on her face as she spoke.

“Haha, but no matter what, that kid is already a very powerful expert!”

The middle-aged man in blood-red clothes smiled as his gaze swept past the people from the life and Death Pill and holy item forging workshop on both sides.

“Your Highness, even if it’s an additional fifth level void interpretation expert, it shouldn’t be too much of a problem for your blood flow empire, right?”

An old man said with a frown.

“One or two, even if it’s three or four, it won’t have much of an impact!”

The middle-aged man in blood-red clothing smiled indifferently.

“Then your highness, tonight’s words...”

The old man hurriedly opened his mouth and looked at him.

“Directly assassinating, this kind of method is simply too low-end. Before the dragon-phoenix Empire dies, we can still make use of it. Don’t be anxious!”

The middle-aged man in blood-red clothes said with a smile.

“Oh? Your Highness, the Blood Emperor and our two chief supervisors have already gone to the vast region. This matter is entirely under your control. Do you have a better method?”

An old man’s eyes flickered as he asked.

“Everyone will naturally know tomorrow. Everyone, don’t worry. The matter that our blood flow dynasty has promised will definitely be accomplished!”

The middle-aged man in the blood-red costume kept them guessing and said with a smile.

“That’s good. We will wait for the good news from the crown prince. We will take our leave First!”

A few middle-aged men cupped their hands and walked out directly.

“I didn’t expect that the king of the dragon-phoenix dynasty was actually a woman!”

After the few of them left, the beautiful woman in the main hall stood up and sat beside the middle-aged man. She spoke with some surprise.

“Other than Mei Juan, she is the second queen of the Liuhai Region!”

The young man in the blood-red attire hugged the gorgeous woman’s body and squinted his eyes. “That Wang Xian is not simple. He has many subordinates at the insightful void tier!”

“Huh?”

The gorgeous woman was slightly taken aback. “I heard that there are more than 300 powerhouses in the dragon and Phoenix Empire!”

“The number of insightful void tier powerhouses in the dragon and Phoenix Empire, along with the subordinates of that Wang Xian, is not much less than our bloody flow empire!”

The middle-aged man in blood-red clothes shook the tea beside him and said slowly.

“What? How is this possible? How can there be so many experts?”

The gorgeous woman said with a face full of disbelief.

“This is the information that our blood flow empire received. It is absolutely true. However, there is still a huge gap between our overall strength and the blood flow empire!”

The middle-aged man in blood-red clothes said with a smile.

“That is not the case. Just the blood flow empire has 10 to 20 subordinate dynasties and forces. How can a small empire compare to them!”

The alluring woman said in a fawning manner.

“Hehe!”

The middle-aged man in blood-red clothes smiled, his eyes flashing with a luster.

He was the current crown prince of the blood flow empire. Now, he had the strength of a fifth-level void interpretation. When he reached the sixth-level void interpretation, it would be the time for him to ascend to the throne.

In the current empire, he was in charge of many matters, big and small.

This time, he was also the one who presided over the command of the blood flow empire.

It could be said that he was announcing to the world that this was the future blood emperor!

“Everyone from the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, please head to the Imperial Palace!”

Early in the morning the next day, a middle-aged man came to the castle and said to all of them.

“Alright, bring us there then!”

Feng Luan nodded. Everyone followed behind the middle-aged man and headed towards the imperial palace.

After entering the huge imperial palace, they rode on horse carriages and headed inside.

The entire imperial palace was like a different world, beautiful and magnificent.

“Everyone, please alight from the carriage!”

When they arrived at the front of a large hall, the sedan driver spoke to them.

Wang Xian, Feng Luan, and the rest walked down and looked ahead.

“What a huge palace!”

Looking at the huge palace in front of him, Wang Xian was slightly surprised.

The name of the palace was the dragon gathering palace. It was the place where the blood flow royal family held all kinds of huge banquets. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The surrounding forces were holding a flag just like them. They scanned their surroundings in surprise and walked inside.

“Dragon-phoenix Empire, isn’t this a newly rising powerful empire? I heard that the Empire is a queen and is extremely powerful!”

“This dragon-phoenix Empire has risen rapidly in just two short years. If it has more than 200 cities, its strength would be comparable to the Hanhai Empire and Light Dragon Empire!”

“I heard that this empire is extremely belligerent and is expanding crazily!”

The surrounding factions walked into the hall one by one. When they saw the flag of the dragon and Phoenix dynasty beside Wang Xian and Feng Luan, they were discussing in low voices.

Wang Xian and Feng Luan swept their gaze across the area. There were at least 20 to 30 factions walking into the hall.

There were more than 40 dynasties in the Liuhai region. However, there were also other sects, sects, and powerful families.

The number of these factions was not much less than the dynasty.

Each of them gave off the aura of a high-ranking person as they strolled inside.

There were at least a thousand people, but they were not noisy at all.

They were all people of status!

After entering the hall, there were already about a thousand people inside. Each of them sat in a separate area.

In each area, there was a banner. It was the banner of the dynasty and the various factions.

“The dragon and Phoenix Dynasty, please follow us!”

A eunuch walked over and led them to the front with an expressionless face.

“This is your position!”

The eunuch pointed to a few tables and said.

Everyone nodded.

Wang Xian looked around and realized that the Hanhai dynasty was beside them.

The Light Dragon dynasty was not too far away from them. They were in a position near the front!

“This should be divided according to the strength of each dynasty!”

Feng Luan noticed that they were in a relatively high position. She also glanced around and said.
