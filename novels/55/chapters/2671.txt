2672 2,672 immortal king level abyss seeds

“Quickly get rid of these two immortal king level abyss seeds.”

Wang Xian said with a smile when he saw ao Yao killing the seriously injured level nine abyss seed.

“Alright.”

The eyes of the sect leader and the rest lit up last month. They nodded excitedly.

The Abyss crisis this time might be resolved.

Their eyes flickered as they surrounded the other two abyss seeds.

Last month, there were three people from the sect, Wang Xian and the other five, eight against two, as well as assassins like Ao Yao who were hiding in the void.

The other two abyss seeds were dealt with in just two minutes.

“Another three from here should be enough.”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and put away the two corpses with a smile on his face.

“Thank you, Dragon King. After getting rid of those three abyssal seeds, the Battle of the Abyss might be coming to an end this time.”

The Chief of last month and the rest said gratefully.

“Now is not the time to talk. Let’s do it.”

Wang Xian smiled and moved his body. He immediately attacked the three immortal king level nine abyssal seeds that were trapped by the Thorn Monster.

Ao Xingmu and the rest immediately followed behind.

Last month’s sect master and the rest were naturally not careless. They immediately rushed over. At this moment, they felt extremely relaxed.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Roar Roar Roar!”

When Wang Xian and the rest rushed over, the eyes of the three level 9 undying godly monarch abyss species revealed panic and fear.

They suddenly looked at each other and raised their heads to let out a roar that was even louder than usual.

The Roar reverberated across the sky of the Northern Abyss.

“Hehe, let out your last roar. Soon, all of You B * stards will be dead!”

The sect master and the rest from last month had an extremely sinister look on their faces. They were the first to attack the three level nine abyssal seeds.

“Kill!”

Wang Xian also let out a soft shout. It was 11 against three. There was no danger at all.

“Hahaha, let’s start killing too. Kill all these beasts. Victory belongs to us!”

“Roar, we are about to win. With the help of the powerhouses from the Dragon Palace, we are about to win. We are going to massacre the last abyssal seed.”

Below them, the powerhouses and disciples from all the factions also had an extremely excited look in their eyes.

There were still three powerful abyssal seeds left. Moreover, they were soon destroyed.

Below them, with the help of the members of the Dragon Palace, they were also massacring.

Seeing the end of the battle, they were filled with fighting spirit and excitement.

Some warriors couldn’t help but Roar in celebration.

All of this was because of the Dragon Palace!

“Hahaha, they’re dead, all the beasts are dead.”

The battle lasted for 5 minutes, when the last undying level 9 abyssal seed was killed, the leader and the other two couldn’t help but roar.

Even they were almost killed in this battle. Seeing that the threat had been dealt with, they could not help but feel excited.

“Sect leader, all the abyssal seeds below have been killed too, hahaha!”

At this moment, there was good news from below. An elder from last month reported happily.

Wang Xian and the rest looked down at the densely packed corpses of the abyssal seeds.

Some of the disciples of the Dragon Palace were collecting the corpses of the abyssal seeds that they had hunted.

“Victory! We have won on the Northern Front!”

The sect leader of last month raised his arm in excitement.

“Victory! We have won!”

All the experts and disciples could not help but cheer.

The sect leader of last month and the other three patriarchs exchanged a glance before moving to the position below.

They glanced at the experts and disciples of all the forces.

“This time, we won the northern front because of the Dragon Palace and the Dragon King. It can be said that the Dragon Palace is our benefactor and the Dragon King is our benefactor!”

“The people of the northern front are not ungrateful people. Thank you, Dragon King. What happens to the Dragon Palace in the future will happen to the northern front!”

“Thank you, Dragon Palace, thank you, Dragon King. The northern front will never forget you!”

The hierarch stood in front of hundreds of millions of people last month and said loudly.

“Thank you, Dragon Palace, thank you, Dragon King. The northern front will never forget you!”

...

“Thank you, Dragon Palace, thank you, Dragon King. The northern front will never forget you!”

...

Earth-shattering roars came from everyone’s mouth. They looked at Wang Xian and the others in the sky and bowed sincerely to express their gratitude.

The voice reverberated in the vast abyss.

All the factions and people in the northern front understood that without the dragon palace, it was already considered good enough for one-tenth of the people present to survive.

“I was still dissatisfied with the Dragon Palace back then. I’m really ashamed.”

An elder from the great sect of the last month shook his head slightly and knelt down in the void. He kowtowed to atone for his sins.

The Moon and Starlight, who had a trace of resentment toward Wang Xian, knelt down with a flushed face.

“Everyone, you don’t have to be so polite. Please tidy up. Our Dragon Palace will only take the corpses of the abyssal seeds that we have killed. You can take the rest!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across them and said faintly.

This was also the first time that the Dragon Palace had gained the support of all the forces in an area.

...

In the past, they had always fought their way to a throne.

Now, they were convinced.

“Our disciples will collect the corpses of our companions and bury them properly in the future. We will also collect the corpses of these abyssal seeds and give them all to the Dragon Palace later.”

Last month, the sect master turned around and gave an order to everyone.

The rest of the factions, powerhouses, and disciples naturally agreed with him.

Then, everyone began to clean up the battlefield. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Wang Xian watched this scene with a smile on his face. This great battle could be said to be a survival of the fittest for the northern front.

“Huh?”

However, at this moment, the heaven array in dragon peak frowned slightly and immediately looked at the screen in front of him.

This array had been upgraded the last time and was able to detect a radius of 20 billion kilometers.

Once there was a creature that could threaten the dragon palace, it would display black dots.

At this moment, two black dots appeared at the edge of the screen.

Furthermore, these two black dots were flying towards them at a terrifying speed.

It was estimated that they would arrive in a few dozen seconds.

“Such speed. Is this a peak immortal King Abyss Seed?”

His expression changed drastically.

“Dragon King!”

He moved and appeared in front of Wang Xian in an instant.

“Dragon King, we’re in trouble. There’s an existence at the peak of the Immortal King realm flying towards us from the abyss. It should be an abyss seed!”

Tian Chen immediately said.

“What?”

Wang Xian was shocked.

“Estimated time of 40 to 50 seconds!”

Tian Chen continued.

“Flying towards us? Oh No!”

Wang Xian had a grave expression on his face.

“All members of the Dragon Palace, put away the corpses and get into the dragon peak immediately.”

“Chief last month, everyone else, pay attention. There’s a peak immortal king level being flying towards us from the abyss. It might be a peak immortal king level abyss seed. Get Out of the Abyss immediately!”

He immediately shouted at everyone.
