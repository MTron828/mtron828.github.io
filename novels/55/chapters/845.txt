“Dragon King?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The expressions on their faces changed, and then became interesting.

They had never met the Dragon King, nor had they met the people from the Dragon Palace.

They had only become immortals in the last year.

But they also knew the name of the Dragon King, the only person who dared to directly kill the eight gods of the divine realm.

The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!

The eight gods of the Garden of Eden had been killed, and it had once caused a great commotion in the west. However, in the end, what surprised everyone in the divine realm was that the matter was finally settled.

In the end, the people of the divine realm learned that the Dragon Palace was the most powerful force in the east.

They had once dispatched eighteen immortal gods to destroy two terrifying immortal sects.

At that time, they had dispatched two high-level immortals to kill one of the other high-level immortals.

When this news came out, it shocked all the divine realms. Two high-level immortals and eighteen immortal gods. There were not many people who could rival this power.

Later, it was said that the Dragon King had subdued another high-level immortal, which shocked all the other forces again!

With such terrifying strength, perhaps only the Nordic divine realm could suppress the Dragon Palace.

They did not expect that they had provoked the most powerful force in the east, which made them feel terrified.

“Dragon King!”

At this moment, another wave came before the peace.

The situation here attracted the attention of many people. A group of more than 20 immortals walked over with some of their children.

In the middle, there was a burly old man. The old man stared at Wang Xian coldly, his eyes filled with killing intent.

“Mad God!”

“It’s Mad God, the leader of all the gods in the Garden of Eden, Mad God!”

“Hiss, I didn’t expect Mad God of the Garden of Eden to come here personally!”

“Not only the divine realm of the Garden of Eden, there are also the gods of the ancient Greek divine realm!”

Everyone was slightly shocked again. Mad God, the leader of the gods in the Garden of Eden, was also one of the top experts of today.

Seeing them staring at the Dragon King coldly, everyone understood!

The Dragon King had killed eight gods in the Garden of Eden back then.

“If you don’t want to die, don’t bother me!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across all of them and said indifferently.

“Hiss!”

The corner of the mouth of the Mad God and all the surrounding gods could not help but Twitch.

Domineering, as domineering as ever!

Even someone as strong as the Mad God did not dare to say anything. The current Garden of Eden was far inferior to the Dragon Palace.

They would only be able to fight against the Dragon Palace if they joined forces with the ancient Greeks.

“Everyone, today is the joyous day of our Yuwen clan and the Northern European divine realm. I hope that everyone can give us some face!”

A few immortals from the Yuwen clan saw the situation here and hurriedly walked over with cupped fists.

The two middle-aged men looked at the Dragon King and cupped their fists to express their gratitude. “Hehe, thank you, Dragon King, for being able to attend our nephew’s wedding despite your busy schedule!”

“No Need!”

Wang Xian shook his head lightly. It was not appropriate for him to cause trouble at someone else’s wedding venue, even though there were a few people who were courting death.

He walked to the place where he handed in the gifts and delivered them.

Ling Xiao also delivered a celestial artifact that he had prepared.

After delivering the gifts, Wang Xian and the rest walked out.

At this moment, he felt something and looked to the side.

When he looked over, he met a gaze that was filled with hatred.

Wang Xian pondered for a moment and thought of this young man’s name. It was Yu Wenyue, Yu Wenhua’s younger brother.

“I didn’t expect to meet so many people who have grudges against me!”

Wang Xian smiled gently. He didn’t think much of it and sat down at the side.

At this moment, Yuwen Yue was standing beside the two young divine sons and goddesses of the Roman divine territory.

“Brother Yue, What’s wrong? Do you have a grudge with the Dragon King?”

The young divine son asked with a slightly embarrassed expression.

“Irreconcilable!”

Yuwen Yue’s face was filled with grief and indignation, and her eyes were filled with frost.

“My fiancée was killed by the Dragon King’s Men!”

Yuwen Yue realized that she was too emotional. She took a deep breath and added.

“Huh?”

The young divine son and Goddess were slightly stunned and said with a sullen face, “It’s a pity that the Dragon King is too powerful. Not long ago, he cut off the arms of all of us in the Roman divine realm. I’m really not reconciled to this grudge!”

“Okay, sister-in-law asked me to call everyone over to gather.”

Yuwen Yue calmed her mind and said to them.

Then, she called over the young divine sons and goddesses from the Garden of Eden Divine Realm, Ancient Greek divine realm, and other divine realms.

The array was connected to a mountain peak in the middle of the east.

This mountain peak was the tallest one around. One was surrounded by flowers and thorns, and there was a cave entrance in the middle.

In a moment, the bride and groom would come out from this cave.

The group entered the cave. The entire cave was abnormally wide, and it was filled with the divine sons and goddesses of God’s domain.

“Miranda, Amy!”

The group entered the cave. In the middle of the cave, a western beauty wearing eastern clothing waved at the group of people who entered with a smile on her face.

“Amy, you’re late. Everyone else came two or three days ago!”

The western beauty looked at the goddess and said with a smile.

“I encountered a small matter!”

The goddess from the Roman celestial domain squeezed out a smile. “Philomena, I’m really sorry!”

“It’s okay, it’s okay. Why do you look a little pale!”

Philomena, who was good at observing people’s expressions, looked at the few divine sons and Goddesses and said with a bad expression.

“We met the Dragon King, so...”

The few divine sons and goddesses from Ancient Greece and the Garden of Eden said with slight embarrassment. They then looked at the divine sons and goddesses from the Roman celestial domain.

“Amy and the others had an unintentional collision with the Dragon King not long ago, and one of their arms was directly cut off, so they went back!”

A few divine sons and goddesses added.

“Sigh, forget it. We admit defeat!”

When the young divine son learned that it was the Dragon King, he said without the slightest bit of temper.

“Brother, if there’s a chance in the future, I’ll definitely cut off his head with my own hands!”

Yu Wenyue, who was silent at the side, suddenly whispered to Yu Wenhua.

Yu Wenhua heavily patted his shoulder. “Forget it. I’ll ask your sister-in-law to find you another one in the future!”

“Eh? What’s wrong with Xiaoyue?”

Philomena, who was at the side, saw that Yu Wenhua’s expression was not good and asked curiously.

“It’s okay. Today is our wedding day. Don’t mention anything else!”

Yu Wenhua hugged Philomena’s shoulder and whispered.

“Just say it. I Won’t be affected by these things. Don’t worry, I’m very happy today!”

Philomena held onto Yu Wenhua’s arm and said.

“Originally, Xiaoyue was prepared to get engaged to a girl. In the end, that girl’s power was destroyed by the Dragon King!”

As Yu Wenhua said this, his gaze turned slightly cold.

The relationship between the two brothers was very deep. It could be seen from the time when Yu Wenyue was beaten up and Yu Wenhua directly challenged the Dragon Palace.

Moreover, that challenge had also become a black spot in his life.

“HMM? It seems that this dragon king is really annoying!”
