Chapter 1514: 1514 priest of light

Stepping on the light, seeking the balance between light and darkness!

Ever since Wang Xian left the ancient demon city, he walked aimlessly for two days. Finally, he arrived at the Divine Light Imperial City of the Divine Light Empire.

The Divine Light Empire was an empire that mainly cultivated the light attribute. It was considered to be one of the top powers in the entire vast region.

Wang Xian came here to find the path of light.

After staying here for seven days, other than peace, he didn’t gain much.

However, the power of light at the location of his heart had obviously increased a little. Although it wasn’t much, there was still 5% of it.

Wang Xian followed the crowd and headed towards the location of the Employment Association.

The Employment Association in the Divine Light Imperial City wasn’t located in the center of the Imperial City. Instead, it was located not far from the four city gates in the east, west, south, and north.

“A priest is required to head to the ruins of the divine kingdom. The main support and treatment are required. The required cultivation level is above level eight of the extraordinaire!”

“A warrior of light is required to head to the forest of the divine kingdom. The required cultivation level is above level five of the extraordinaire. Those who are not required to go, come and register immediately!”

When Wang Xian arrived at the hiring association at the North Gate, voices were heard.

As a hiring association in the Imperial City, the entire association was extremely luxurious. Tens of thousands of people were gathered here.

Some of them were accepting missions while others were looking for team members.

The entire association was bustling with activity.

Wang Xian looked at the missions listed on the mission list with a smile on his face.

“This is the mission for the Holy Medicine Clinic!”

He swept his gaze around and found a mission that suited him. Immediately, he walked to the front desk to accept the mission.

“Take the mission token and go to the holy medicine clinic not far away to accept the mission assessment!”

The staff member handed him the token and spoke to him faintly.

Wang Xian nodded and walked out immediately.

The Holy Medicine Clinic was just like its name. It was a clinic.

The clinic was the most famous place in the Divine Light Empire.

There was no such thing as a clinic in the Liuhai region. However, due to the existence of the ruins of the divine kingdom, the Divine Light Empire had given birth to a clinic.

The Divine Light Empire mainly focused on the light attribute. The light attribute was on par with the wood attribute when it came to healing and support.

It was slightly higher than the water attribute.

However, due to the existence of the ruins of God’s kingdom, the Divine Light Empire’s medical center had flourished.

It also gave birth to a special support class for the Divine Light Empire.

Radiant priest!

Radiant priest was a purely support class that focused on healing and dispelling.

Although their combat abilities were not strong, their support and healing abilities were extremely powerful.

They were very popular in the ruins of the divine kingdom.

“In order to balance the light and darkness, one must first maintain one’s heart and second, one must temper the light. The job of a priest of light is suitable for one. There’s no need to fight, just to calm one’s emotions!”

Wang Xian walked towards the Holy Medicine Clinic with a smile on his face.

Not far away from the Employment Association was the Holy Medicine Clinic. It was not a very big clinic, and it was barely reputable in the divine light empire.

“Hello, I have accepted the mission from your clinic!”

When Wang Xian arrived at the front of the clinic, he found more than 20 young men, women, middle-aged men, and even elders standing at the entrance.

There were a few horse carriages at the entrance, and they were about to set off.

“HMM? has someone accepted the mission again? It’s still a young man. We are about to set off now. Can you set off with US immediately? If It’s a commission, I’ll give you some more!”

An old woman who was emitting a faint light looked at Wang Xian and asked him directly.

“Eh? Don’t we need to take the assessment?”

Wang Xian was slightly surprised and asked with a smile.

“Do you have the strength of an extraordinary level five? If you do, we will set off once we get in the car. We are in urgent need of manpower now!”

The old woman looked at Wang Xian and wanted to check his strength. However, she couldn’t sense it and asked.

“Yes, we can set off now!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“That’s good. Come, come, help these ladies carry the things!”

The old lady smiled and said to him immediately.

Wang Xian nodded his head and walked over immediately.

“Handsome, help me put this in the car. You’re just a boy. How did you become a radiant priest?”

A woman handed him a radiant spiritual herb that was planted in a pot and asked.

“Why can’t a man become a priest of Light?”

Wang Xian smiled and looked around. He realized that there were more women.

Among them, there were only a few middle-aged men holding longswords.

They stood there with a proud look on their faces. They didn’t move and didn’t come to help.

Looking at the badges on their chests, they were from a mercenary group.

“Men usually choose warriors of the light. There are very few priests, but it’s not like there aren’t any!”

The woman smiled at him.

“Only a coward man would choose a priest of the light!”

At this moment, a young man with his arms crossed looked at Wang Xian with slight disdain and said faintly.

“Li Si, stop talking!”

The middle-aged man glared at him.

Wang Xian smiled faintly and didn’t say anything.

“We are heading to the Holy Medicine Clinic in the ruins of the divine kingdom. The journey of 30,000 miles will take four days. In the middle, we have to cross a corner of the Forest of the Divine Kingdom. Let’s Go!”

At this moment, the old woman walked over and said to Wang Xian and the rest.

“All priests, enter the central carriage. We will escort you with the judicial mercenary group. We will ensure your safe arrival!”

An old man said with confidence. His body moved and he rode on a fierce beast!

“Let’s go, priests and beauties. Let me know if you need anything!”

The young man named Li Si looked at the female priests with a smile.

“Okay, handsome!”

A girl squinted her eyes and said sweetly.

“Haha!”

Li Si smiled and sat on a fierce beast with her chest raised. She was handsome and unrestrained!

The old woman spoke to the members of the judgement mercenary group. Then, she beckoned to all the radiant priests!

Wang Xian followed behind them and walked towards the car in the middle.

The holy medicine clinic wasn’t very strong. The strongest person behind it was only at level three of the Seethrough realm. He didn’t have the ability to buy an airship and fly there directly.

As he entered the car, a fragrance was immediately emitted. He swept his gaze over and saw that there were a total of nine people inside. Other than an old man with a broken leg, the rest were all women.

There were four young girls, three middle-aged women, and the old woman. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Hello, young man. Please sit beside me!”

The old man with a broken leg patted the seat beside him and said with a smile.

“Thank you, Uncle!”

Wang Xian nodded and sat beside the old man.

The old man only had one leg and was holding a scepter of light. There was a long wound on his face and he looked a little ferocious.

“What’s Your Name, young man? Let me introduce you. I’m the Priest of the Holy Light Clinic and the person-in-charge of your clinic!”

The old woman asked Wang Xian with a smile.

“My Name Is Wang Xian!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile.
