Chapter 1613: 1613 entered the vast area

“Prime Minister Gui, how is the strength of the Dragon Palace Now? If the Dragon Phoenix Empire and the Dragon Palace join forces, can we establish a foothold?”

In front of the Dragon Pond, all the leaders of the Dragon Palace were standing around.

Feng Luan glanced at all the disciples of the Dragon Palace and asked Prime Minister Gui.

“In the Dragon Palace, there are three people with rank eight void interpretation, seven with rank seven void interpretation, twenty with rank six void interpretation, thirty with rank five void interpretation, fifty with rank four void interpretation, two thousand with rank three void interpretation, and about five thousand with rank two void interpretation!”

Prime Minister Gui said.

The current Dragon Palace had more than 17,000 members. After ruling the Flowing Sea region, the demonic Lin clan joined and turned into the Fire Phoenix Dragon Seed, adding many experts to the Dragon Palace.

The two leaders of the Fire Phoenix Dragon Seed, in particular, had a cultivation base of level six of the profound void tier. Now that they had broken through to level seven of the profound void tier, they had the combat strength of level eight of the profound void tier.

With the current strength of the Dragon Palace, including Lan Qingyue, they were definitely a super force in the vast area.

Especially the number of experts at the profound void martial stage in the Dragon Palace had reached more than seven thousand.

There were only five to six thousand experts at the profound void martial stage in the lone sect, the Wuji Empire, and the southern royal family.

“There are four to five thousand experts at the profound void martial stage in the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, but there aren’t any at rank eight of the profound void martial stage yet. There are only one or two at rank seven of the profound void martial stage including me!”

Feng Luan said to Prime Minister Gui.

There were so many profound void realm experts in the current dragon and Phoenix Empire, and most of them came from the Demon Beast clan.

The entire flowing sea region, including the sea region, had an area of more than 300,000 kilometers. Four to five thousand profound void realm experts weren’t a lot.

Moreover, only about half of these four to five thousand profound void realm experts belonged to the Dragon and Phoenix Empire.

The rest belonged to the various great clans and sects.

Because the period of rule was too short, there was no guarantee that they would have 100% loyalty.

“It’s enough. Let’s first form the vanguard battle team!”

Prime Minister GUI nodded and said thoughtfully, “According to the information in the vast area, the Dragon King once destroyed an empire in the vast area. At this time, that empire has not been occupied by anyone!”

“We can temporarily occupy that empire and use it as a base to prepare for ruling the entire vast area!”

Feng Luan nodded when she heard Prime Minister Gui’s words. “If we want to occupy that place, we might need sister Qingyue’s help!”

“Yes, only with the Dragon Queen’s help can we smoothly occupy it and intimidate the other forces!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded and looked at Lan Qingyue.

“Okay.”

Lan Qingyue looked at them and nodded. Then she turned to the Dragon Pond. “I wonder when Little Xian will be able to resurrect?”

“The resurrection of the Dragon King may take a few months. During this time, we should make some preparations. It’s best if we march into the vast area after the Dragon King resurrects!”

Feng Luan also looked at the Dragon Pool. She sighed and said slowly.

Prime Minister Gui also nodded his head.

The Dragon King was the backbone of the entire Dragon Palace. Although Prime Minister Gui had great authority, there were still some matters that required the Dragon King’s presence.

Even now, Feng Luan had unknowingly treated Wang Xian as a pillar of support and backbone.

All the leaders of the Dragon Palace were standing in front of the dragon pool, waiting for the resurrection of the Dragon King.

Guan Shuqing and the rest had been chatting with Ling Jian ‘ER.

They talked about Ling Jian ‘ER’s past and how Wang Xian had set foot in the vast region in order to find her.

Although Ling Jian ‘ER had completely forgotten about everyone, she gradually understood that she had forgotten about her past because she had cultivated the heartless sword principle.

She began to accept everything and her father.

When Guan Shuqing and the rest saw Ling Jian ‘er’s appearance, they heaved a sigh of relief.

“HMM? I’ve fallen. Am I being resurrected in the Dragon Pool Now?”

Time passed slowly. A month later, Wang Xian’s soul gradually fluctuated.

He sensed the energy around him and heaved a sigh of relief.

It took him a month to recover a little from his fall this time.

The stronger he was, the longer it would take for him to resurrect.

His soul sensed something and he immediately began to condense his body.

“Buzz Buzz!”

“Buzz Buzz!”

At this moment, he felt three items move in the Dragon Pool.

One was the five elements crown, one was the light and Dark Dragon Pearl, and the other was the heart of light and dark. Especially the heart of light and dark, it came directly to his heart.

“The light and dark on the heart of light and dark has reached a balance. This is a good opportunity to merge them!”

Wang Xian sensed the two dragon pearls, the heart of light and dark, and moved slightly.

As the saying goes, if one does not break, one will not stand. If one breaks, one will stand. This death was actually an opportunity for him.

“Once the heart of light and dark is completely merged, I will be able to master the five elements and the power of light and dark. When that time comes, my strength will be able to rise another level!”

Wang Xian thought to himself.

With seven attributes in his body, with his cultivation of the fourth level of the Seethrough realm, he would be able to kill the ninth level of the Seethrough realm.

Fighting someone who was five levels above him was definitely a terrifying existence.

Even the Five Elements Dragon King and the light and Darkness Dragon King of the Divine Dragon Clan back then did not have the strength of Wang Xian, who was able to fight someone who was five levels above him.

Thinking about how his strength could increase again, Wang Xian immediately fused the heart of light and darkness.

Time flew by quickly. A month passed once again.

“What’s going on? Two months have passed. Why hasn’t Xiao Xian formed her dragon body yet?”

Around the Dragon Pool, Guan Shuqing, Lan Sunling, and the rest were looking at the dragon pool anxiously. They were frowning.

“Reporting to the Dragon King, the Dragon King should be fusing with the heart of light and darkness. Therefore, it took a long time!”

Ao Yao had a better understanding of the heart of light and darkness, so he reported to them.

“Then... how long will it take to fuse?”

The group of girls frowned and asked.

“Please rest assured, Dragon Queen, the Dragon King will not be in danger. As for when he can be completely resurrected, Ao Yao doesn’t know!”

Ao Yao shook his head.

“Prime Minister Gui, the resurrection of little immortal should take at least half a year or more. Let’s go into the vast region first. Without Little Immortal, we can also make the southern Royal Family of Solitaire sect pay the price!”

Feng Luan frowned and said to Prime Minister Gui.

“Dragon Queens, what do you think?” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Prime Minister Gui looked at Lan Qingyue, Guan Shuqing, and the others and asked.

Such a big matter still needed the Dragon Queens’approval.

“Okay, we can’t rely on Little Immortal for everything. Now that Qingyue’s strength has greatly increased, we are not weak either!”

“During the time when Little Immortal is resurrected, we will take revenge for Little Immortal!”

The group of girls nodded their heads with frosty expressions without any hesitation.

“Alright, then our Dragon Palace will send out a batch of forces and head to the vast area tomorrow!”

Prime Minister Gui immediately gave the order.

While the Dragon Palace and the Dragon and Phoenix Empire were preparing to march into the vast area, Wang Xian was resurrected in the Dragon Pool.

However, great changes had also taken place on Earth.
