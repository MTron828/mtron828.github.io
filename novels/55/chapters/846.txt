Chapter 847: 0848 openly targeted him

Philomena slightly raised her eyebrows when she heard the words of the divine sons and goddesses of the western divine realm and Yuwen Hua’s words.

He naturally knew the dragon king very well. He was the most powerful force in the east and the Master of the Dragon Palace.

However, Philomena did not put the Dragon King in her eyes.

She was the only daughter of the god King of the Nordic Divine Realm.

There was only one god King in all the God realms at the moment, and that was the god King of the Scandinavian God realm, the king of all gods.

This was the publicly recognized God King, and his strength was unfathomable.

After the burst of spiritual energy, the Scandinavian god realm became even more powerful, and the Scandinavian god realm was faintly revered in the entire west.

Before the burst of spiritual energy, the number of immortals and gods in the Scandinavian God realm had reached about thirty, far surpassing the number of Immortals and gods in the Dragon Palace by about twenty.

Now, she was even more confident that the Nordic region’s strength was not something that the Dragon Palace could match.

And her husband’s Yuwen clan was also a force that could not be underestimated. Now that they had a marriage alliance, they were definitely the most powerful force on Earth.

From this wedding, it could be seen that all the western regions’divine domains had arrived. There were even leaders of the divine domains who had brought the gods to congratulate them.

“They are incomparably arrogant. They are relying on their own strength to not put anyone in their eyes!”

Yuwen Yue said with an embarrassed expression.

“HMPH, they still think that they are invincible on Earth. If this Dragon King dares to provoke me, I will teach them a lesson!”

Philomena pouted and snorted coldly.

Yuwen Hua smiled. “This time, the Dragon King has come because of the invitation of our Yuwen clan. This Dragon King can be considered as giving face and personally attending!”

“Currently, the Scandinavian divine realm and the Yuwen clan can be said to be the most powerful forces on Earth. This dragon king naturally has to come and curry favor with them!”

“That’s right. I’ve heard of the Dragon King’s reputation. He’s very powerful, but he’s still incomparable to the Scandinavian divine realm, not to mention the alliance between the two of you!”

“This Dragon King also knows his own limits. He will only provoke those who are stronger than him, and he won’t provoke you. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have come personally today. It’s clearly a show of goodwill!”

Some of the divine sons and goddesses of the divine realm said with some flattery.

Philomena raised her head slightly with a proud face. As the daughter of the Divine King, even the leader of the divine realm had to treat her as an equal.

This was the power of the Nordic divine realm.

“The auspicious time has come. Young master, Young Lady, it’s time to pay respects!”

At this moment, a voice came from outside.

It was time for the ceremony.

The wedding continued in the Chinese style. Compared to the modern style, it was more complicated.

At the wedding venue, everyone sat at the tables and watched the bride and groom walk out.

Boom! Boom! Boom

At this moment, a brilliant light appeared in the sky.

There were places in China where the wedding was at noon, and there were places where it was at night. The Yuwen clan’s tradition was that it was at night.

However, even at night, the entire wedding venue was decorated as if it was a white night.

The Sun had just set when multicolored rays of light appeared in the sky.

“This is too awesome! Using a fire attributed infant realm expert to release fireworks. The Red Flames in the center are even at the immortal God level. Moreover, they even found some experts who possess heaven and Earth Heavenly Flames!”

“What a big spending! As expected of the marriage alliance between the Yuwen clan and the Northern European God Domain. It’s simply too powerful!”

“There are quite a few people from the northern European God’s domain. There are 20 immortals here. Oh My God, this northern European God’s domain is really powerful.”

“Their god King didn’t come over, but the god Queen did!”

When the bride and groom walked out, the Flames released by the fire attribute experts soared into the sky.

The surrounding people discussed in whispers.

“It’s simply too beautiful!”

Xiao Yu looked at the fireworks in the sky and the beautiful scenes around her with an infatuated look.

The wedding scene this time was indeed rather grand.

Wang Xian was watching from the side with a smile on his face. There were some people looking over from time to time, but they quickly shifted their gazes over.

Heaven and earth, parents.

One by one, the process was completed in half an hour.

After the process was completed, it was time for dinner. The bride and groom would come out to toast.

“Ling Tian, and brother, have you learned anything? When you organize a wedding and help me organize a wedding, don’t be too shabby!”

On the table, Xiao Yu, Wang Xian, Ling Xiao, and the rest were sitting at the same table. They were all smiling as they spoke to them.

“Alright, Alright. I will definitely let you get married in a glorious manner in the future!”

Wang Xian smiled as he spoke to Xiao Yu.

“If I don’t get married, brother, you can build me a big house in the Dragon Palace. In the future, I can bring Ling Tian to live in the Dragon Palace!”

Xiao Yu giggled as she spoke.

“Alright, Alright!”

Wang Xian smiled as he nodded. “You can live wherever you want in the future!”

“The bride and groom are here to toast to our family and friends!”

At this moment, a voice came from the side.

There were about 50 tables present. Among them, there were two to three immortal-level powerhouses at each table.

There were no less than 150 immortal-level powerhouses present.

According to the rules, the bride and groom came over to give a toast one table at a time. This was a form of wedding etiquette.

“Thank you for chasing away the sect leader of the Origin Immortal sect. Thank you so much!”

“Haha, Congratulations! Congratulations on marrying such a beautiful wife. Come, let me toast to all of You!”

A polite voice came from the table next to them.

Ling Xiao and the others from the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect looked over and immediately filled their wine cups.

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across them. The bride and groom were toasting one by one. Beside them was a friend of the bride, Yu Wenhua. Yu Wenyue was also pouring wine beside them.

“They’re here!”

Ling Xiao whispered. The Yellow Heaven Immortal sect was not powerful and could not be compared to the Yu Wen clan, much less the big dipper divine territory. Therefore, he attached great importance to them. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Uncles and uncles, thank you for attending our nephew’s wedding!”

Yu Wenhua walked over and said to them with a smile on his face.

Ling Xiao and the rest immediately stood up with smiles on their faces.

When in Rome, do as the Romans do. Wang Xian also stood up. At the very least, he had to be polite.

“You are the Dragon King!”

At this moment, a clear and cold voice was heard.

Wang Xian turned around and saw the bride sizing him up coldly. He could see some hostility in her eyes.

“Yes!”

The corners of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly as he nodded his head faintly.

“Oh, I’ve long heard that the Dragon King is extremely arrogant. I hope that you will give me some face when you meet people from the western divine realm in the future!”

The corner of Philomena’s mouth also curled up slightly as she said faintly.

“Hehe, it’s not about giving face. It’s about fighting for it. It’s about strength!”

Wang Xian said faintly.

“Hehe, that’s true. Therefore, I don’t need to give you any face at all!”

Philomena nodded with a smile on her face. She turned to Yu Wenhua and said, “Let’s go. Let’s go to the next table!”

Yu Wenhua was slightly taken aback. However, he quickly smiled and said, “Yes, Madam!”

“Hehe!”

Yu Wenyue revealed a mocking smile on her face.
