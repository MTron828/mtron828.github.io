Chapter 2870: The price was 2870

“Hiss, look up, there are more than ten divine emperors from the eight barrens.”

“Many disciples from the eight barrens have also come. This is obviously a test to ask the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King and the others!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“The Dragon King and the others are divine emperors. It might be difficult to keep the Dragon King and the others.”

“I wonder if the Dragon King and the others will appear.”

In the sky above the Blue Moon Star, twelve towering figures were suspended in the sky, staring coldly at the position below.

Behind them were tens of thousands of experts from the eight barrens. They were a unified divine king expert. Their bodies were also emitting a cold aura.

They were suspended in the sky. A suffocating pressure was heading towards the Blue Moon Planet.

At this moment, everyone raised their heads in unison and looked towards the sky with respect.

As people from the eight barrens, they knew how powerful the eight barrens were.

Buzz

Wang Xian looked at the people of the eight desolates calmly from below.

His figure flashed and appeared directly in the sky above them.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

The Heaven Array’s eight qi and the others stood behind him.

“The Dragon King Is Here!”

The twelve celestial emperors of the eight desolates narrowed their eyes slightly when they saw this figure in the sky.

“Look, the Dragon King is going over!”

“The Dragon King has indeed gone over. Hiss, is there going to be a battle?”

From below, everyone was astonished when they saw Wang Xian and the rest flying over.

“May I know why the people of the eight barren divine emperors are looking for me?”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the twelve barren divine emperors. Both of them were floating in mid-air as they looked at each other from afar.

He was the first to open his mouth and ask indifferently.

“Dragon King, why do you still ask when you already know the answer?”

An eight barrens divine emperor in the middle said coldly.

“TSK TSK TSK, we really don’t know about this. If there’s nothing else, don’t disturb us.”

Ba Qi, who was at the side, stared at the eight barrens divine emperor and said with a smile.

“HMPH, you were the ones who killed Feng Mie!”

A divine emperor shrouded in flames questioned furiously.

“He’s courting death.”

Wang Xian said calmly.

“He’s courting death. Does the Dragon King know that he’s the Celestial Emperor of the eight barrens?”

A middle-aged celestial emperor stared at Wang Xian and the rest with a cold look in his eyes.

“So what if he knows? Your Disciples of the eight barrens want to kill our Dragon King. What a joke. It’s already good that we didn’t cause you any trouble.”

The sky array swept over all of them with disdain.

“The Dragon Palace is so powerful!”

“This… I have a bad feeling about this.”

On the Blue Moon Planet, everyone heard their conversation and their pupils constricted slightly. Their faces revealed a look of surprise.

The Dragon Palace was too powerful. There were no divine emperors and experts from the eight barrens.

“So, you’re saying that our eight barrens divine emperor was killed and you won’t give us an explanation?”

The aura of the eight desolation celestial thearch rose slowly as he asked expressionlessly.

“What kind of explanation do you want?”

The corners of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly as he looked at them.

“What price? Take out five first level celestial thearch treasures. No one from Your Dragon Palace will ever be allowed to enter the eight desolation six harmonies.”

An eight desolation celestial thearch spoke coldly.

“If the Dragon King does not agree, we can only use our own methods to make the Dragon Palace pay the price. I’m afraid that you guys can not afford this price.”

As soon as one of the Celestial Emperors finished his sentence, the celestial emperor beside him didn’t want to talk too much with him and said directly.

“Haha, Our Dragon Palace can’t afford it. I wonder what price it is?”

Wang Xian smiled and asked them calmly as usual.

“Dragon King, don’t be too arrogant and don’t anger too many people. If the Dragon Palace doesn’t give us a satisfactory explanation for the destruction of the wind, it won’t be so easy to bully us.”

“If Your Dragon Palace doesn’t mind having another enemy like the imperial court of Witchcraft Association, our eight desolation won’t mind either.”

The eight Desolation Celestial Emperor in the middle said coldly.

“If we kill the Wind Annihilation Celestial Emperor, Our Dragon Palace will kill him. As for whether or not we have another enemy, I really don’t care. I really don’t mind!”

“I’ve said it before. If your eight desolation wants to fight, our Dragon Palace will accept it.”

Wang Xian stared at them and retracted the smile on his face.

“Hehe, bhang, do you really think that our Dragon Palace is afraid of You? I was able to sweep through all of you by myself thousands of years ago. Even though I haven’t recovered to my peak, I still don’t put you in my eyes.”

“Our Dragon Palace doesn’t put you in our eyes either. The price? I want to see who will bear the heavy price in the end!”

Tian Chen stood by the side and shouted at them with disdain.

“Hahaha, good, good, good. Since the Dragon Palace doesn’t put us in their eyes, let’s see the strength of the Dragon Palace.”

“Let’s see what the Dragon Palace doesn’t put us in their eyes.”

Boom! Boom! Boom

Upon hearing the words of Wang Xian and Tian Chen, an emperor of the eight barrens laughed maniacally.

At the same time, an extremely powerful aura shot out from his body. An unconcealed killing intent swept over.

“Since we are enemies, then Dragon King, Heaven Array, get out of the eight desolation six directions immediately. Otherwise, we will leave all of you here completely. Scram!”

A huge axe appeared in the hands of one of the eight desolation celestial thearch. He raised his battle axe and attacked Wang Xian and the rest directly.

In the surroundings, weapons appeared in the hands of the other eleven celestial thearchs. They were filled with violent killing intent.

“Get lost!”

They let out a furious roar and launched a series of mighty attacks at Wang Xian and the rest.

“Get out of our eight desolation and six harmonies!”

Behind them, a group of celestial thearchs from the eight desolation also let out a loud roar with a murderous look on their faces. An overwhelming amount of energy was directed towards where Wang Xian and the rest were.

“Humph!”

“Go Back!”

When Wang Xian saw their attack, he narrowed his eyes slightly and his figure disappeared slowly.

“TSK TSK tsk, wash your dog heads well. It Won’t be long before we are beheaded by you!”

The eight-limbed demon duo laughed out loud and disappeared soon after.

Hong Fengyan, who was far away, frowned slightly and disappeared instantly.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Streams of terrifying energy blasted towards the spot where Wang Xian and the rest had disappeared. The mighty energy caused the blue moon planet below to tremble slightly.

“Hiss, the Dragon Palace and bhang have completely fallen out!”

“The Dragon Palace is too arrogant. They don’t put bhang in their eyes at all.”

“The Dragon King and the rest have left and returned to the Imperial Star Field.”

“The Divine Emperors of the Dragon Palace are really arrogant. They actually made us bhang clean our heads. HMPH, they have so many enemies. They will be destroyed sooner or later.”

Many people in the Blue Star Moon spoke coldly.

“From today onwards, everyone from the Dragon Palace is prohibited from entering the bhang six directions. Once they enter, all the disciples of the bhang six directions will be killed without mercy!”

Seeing Wang Xian and the rest leave, the divine emperors of the bhang eight directions scanned their surroundings with a cold gaze.

One of the Celestial Emperors ordered loudly.

“Disciples of the Dragon Palace, kill without mercy!”

The disciples of the eight barren shouted loudly.
