Chapter 37: I’m the Boss (1)

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

When the juvenile saw Wang Xian take out a bank card, he was stunned, as his eyes were filled with disbelief.

All the people around, including Director Li, looked at Wang Xian with astonishment.

“The money on the card is sufficient to fork over $16 million. I’ll buy First-grade Restaurant. What do you think, Director Li?” Wang Xian asked Director Li with a smiling face.

When they were talking just now, Wang Xian’s attention was drawn when he overheard Director Li was going to sell away the First-grade Restaurant.

At present, he had some money obtained through special ways, but he had no stable source of income.

If he bought the First-grade Restaurant, he could manage the restaurant in the future.

Moreover, he had a great advantage of catching his own seafood if he took over the restaurant.

Perhaps it might be a waste of time for him to catch his own, but he could get his subordinates from the Dragon Palace to do it. Till then, his procurement of seafood would be at zero cost.

The restaurant just had to pay off the staff wages and the necessary expenses.

The business would not lose out. It’s 100% profitable.

Wang Xian wanted to wait until they left before he discussed with Director Li. Who knew the juvenile beside him would lend him a helping hand? What a kind person he was.

“$16 million, are...you really going to take over?” The juvenile pointed at Wang Xian in disbelief and asked with a shaky voice.

The boy before him was just as young as him. Yet, he could actually fork over $16 million to buy the restaurant. How... could this be possible?

Wang Xian looked at the juvenile before he fixed his gaze on Director Li.

“You...” Director Li saw Wang Xian and recognized him. With a mixed expression, he asked, “Are you really buying the restaurant?”

“Of course, I will not joke around when it concerns millions of dollars. $16 million. Are you selling or not? If you are selling, we can sign the contract and make the payment tomorrow.” Wang Xian nodded with a solemn face.

Director Li had a change in his expression before he cast his gaze to the young man at the side.

At this time, the young man fixed his gaze on Wang Xian, “Young chap, are you sure you want to buy the First-grade Restaurant? Think it over again.”

“Depends on the price. If it’s too expensive, I’ll not buy it. I’m offering $16 million. Aren’t you going to counteroffer?” Wang Xian smiled at the young man.

Bang!

Suddenly, the young man banged his hand on the table. “Think again. If you are buying over the restaurant, be prepared to challenge Longxuan Restaurant. When the time comes, don’t lose your pants and go bankrupt.”

Sensing the threat from him, Wang Xian picked up the teacup slowly from the table and said indifferently, “I love challenges. If you want to fight it out, I’m all in for it. But who will lose his pants? Hehe, it’ll not be me. ”

“Fine!”

The young man stood up straight away, “I can do without the First-grade Restaurant. Since you want to have a game, let’s do it. Lad, you’re still an amateur.”

“If I take over here,” Wang Xian stood up slowly, “You will not be my match!”

A tit for tat.

He displayed the shining edge of a Divine Dragon against his opponents and gave off an invisible imposing demeanor.

The young man felt embarrassed by the faint oppression.

“Fine, fine. You’re ridiculous. We’ll wait and see!” The young man glared at him with a ferocious look in his eyes.

“Anytime.” Wang Xian looked at the young man with a smile on his face.

“Hmph, I’ll make sure you lose big time.”

The young man left after he made those harsh remarks as he stared at Director Li coldly.

“You... you’re doomed!” said the juvenile as he jumped up and pointed at Wang Xian with an angry face after he saw his elder brother had left.

Wang Xian threw him a nonchalant look and ignored him before he turned to Director Li.

People like the juvenile were not qualified to speak to him, except for his brother.

“Young lad, are you really buying the First-grade Restaurant with $16 million?”

Director Li did not look at those young people who left. Instead, he questioned Wang Xian again.

“100% positive.”

Wang Xian nodded.

“Hmph!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Upon seeing Wang Xian ignoring him, the juvenile walked out, feeling embarrassed.

“Brother, that fellow was extremely haughty just now. We cannot let him off just like this.”

The juvenile caught up with the young man with an infuriated look on his face after he walked out of the First-grade Restaurant.

“Okay, I got it.” The young man brushed him off without any patience. If his younger brother had not provoked that guy, he would not have expressed his interest in buying the First-grade Restaurant.

If he could take over the restaurant at $15 million, it would be the best choice for him. There was no risk, and it was a profitable business.

Now, he would have to fight it out.

“Anyway, Longxuan Restaurant has completed the renovation. We can open for business soon. Till then...”

The young man darkened his expression as he thought of that fellow’s haughty look just now.

“Just wait and see. I’ll let you have a taste of regret for offending me.”

...

“We’ll discuss the transfer of ownership at 9 AM tomorrow.”

Back at the First-grade Restaurant, Director Li was smiling at Wang Xian.

He was already content to sell the restaurant at $16 million.

“Sure, 9 tomorrow.” Wang Xian nodded.

“I’ll get the things prepared first. Let’s have dinner together.” Director Li said as he stood up.

“No, it’s fine. I’m meeting my friends.” Wang Xian shook his head with a smile. Apart from this business deal, he had nothing to chat with Director Li about.

“Sure, enjoy your dinner. This place will be yours tomorrow!”

As soon as Director Li finished his words, he looked at his restaurant and sighed as he was unsure if he could make a comeback in the future after selling the restaurant.

He walked into the office at the side with low spirits. He would probably never find out that the person who landed him into his current plight was right in front of him.

Everything was to blame on his arrogance.

Buzz.

Wang Xian’s phone rang after waiting in the waiting area for 10 minutes or so.

“Hello? I’m here, in the waiting area,” Wang Xian received the call and told Guan Shuqing.

“Wang Xian.”

As his voice trailed off, he heard Guan Shuqing’s voice at the door.

She waved at him and walked towards him.

Wang Xian gleamed and walked forward to greet her before he saw a group of people behind her.

The one leading the group of youngsters was a 28 or 29 years-old young man who was wearing a trendy summer clothes series from Armani. He was 1.8 meters tall and rather good-looking.

When Wang Xian was looking at him, the young man was observing him too.

A guy wearing Versace on him. His family should be quite well-to-do.

Director Zhou narrowed his eyes and observed Wang Xian from head to toe. He raised his eyebrows, but he was not bothered by him at all.

In his opinion, Wang Xian was still inexperienced.

“Shuqing, is this your friend? Hello, I’m Zhou Yuanhao.”

Zhou Yuanhao walked over and extended his hand to introduce himself with a face full of smiles.

Wang Xian looked at him inquisitively. “Hello, I’m Wang Xian!”
