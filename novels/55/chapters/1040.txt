The auction houses were the places that caused the most trouble.

It was the same for the auction houses in the Western District.

Long Yi stood on top and shouted, immediately attracting the attention of the passersby. Some of them looked over curiously.

There were also some who had nothing better to do and came over.

“Here, our immortal Phoenix auction has something to announce. Three days later, our immortal Phoenix will hold an auction!”

Long Yi saw the gazes of the surrounding people looking over and said loudly.

“An auction will be held in three days?”

“Immortal Phoenix Auction? What’s that? An auction will be held in three days?”

When the surrounding people who passed by heard his words, their faces revealed a stunned expression.

“Hey, this brother, are you joking? An auction will be held in three days?”

When a young man heard his words, a mocking and mocking expression appeared on his face as he shouted on the spot.

“Haha, I think he’s here to joke!”

“Is he going to challenge the record of zero customers in the auction? Haha!”

After the young man’s words, a few other people said with faces full of laughter.

The auction would be held in three days. Wasn’t this courting death?

The battle between the Phoenix Immortal, the life and death, and the holy item was so intense that running out at this time was simply showing off one’s IQ.

Let’s see whose IQ is lower?

Everyone in the surroundings looked over with amusement.

Long Yi looked at the reactions of the people around him. He was not angry at all, but still had a smile on his face.

“Everyone, don’t be in a hurry to leave. Now, allow us to introduce the final item of this immortal Phoenix Auction!”

Long Yi continued to speak loudly.

“Then quickly take it out and let us have a look. Don’t tremble so much!”

“That’s right. Let us see if it’s more precious than a half-step void interpretation demonic beast cub or a half-step void interpretation pet egg. Haha!”

“To dare to hold an auction three days later, it must be a peerless divine artifact, right?”

“Maybe the auctioned item is IQ!”

The crowd below shouted at Long Yi with a face full of mockery.

After these few shouts, there were already five to six hundred people watching this side. They wanted to see what kind of tricks this guy could play.

“Okay!”

Long Yi slightly raised his chest, and the corners of his mouth slightly curled up.

“Then everyone, you have to open your eyes wide. We will only display it for twenty seconds!”

Long Yi revealed a confident expression, his eyes filled with excitement.

“Demon Beast Bloodline, half-step Void Interpretation Level Demon Beast Bloodline!”

Long Yi directly roared out these words, spreading out for a few thousand meters. If this was seen by the city guards, they would be punished with spirit stones.

However, Long Yi didn’t care at this moment.

After he finished shouting, the auction door directly opened.

A pure and transparent pond filled with green liquid was displayed in front of everyone.

Everyone was slightly stunned as they looked at the green liquid.

“What is this? Demonic Beast bloodline, this is a F * cking pool...”

“What a rich bloodline, what a high-grade bloodline, it’s a half-step void interpretation, it’s a half-step void interpretation!”

A young man looked at the pool of green liquid with a face full of disbelief. What kind of Demonic Beast bloodline was this?

However, before he could finish his words, an excited voice suddenly came from the side.

He was slightly stunned and turned his head to look in astonishment.

A demonic beast, that’s right, it was a demonic beast. It held a fork in its hand. Its upper body was similar to a human, but its lower body was a fish tail.

Its head looked a little ferocious.

At this moment, its gaze was burning as it stared at the green liquid, and its body was slightly trembling.

Everyone who was about to mock it was completely stunned. Their eyes slowly widened, and their shock slowly turned into shock.

“It seems that this demon beast is very knowledgeable. That’s right, it is an invincible treasure that can allow humans to obtain the Demon Beast Bloodline. A half-step void interpretation demon beast bloodline. As long as you fuse with this bloodline, you will be able to become a half-step void interpretation expert!”

“I’ll be able to establish a powerful bloodline family. I’ll be able to nurture many half-step void interpretation level heirs. I’ll be able to stand at the peak of East Sea city and establish a family that will last for ten thousand years!”

Bloodline, a half-step void interpretation bloodline.

There wasn’t a single half-step void interpretation bloodline family in the entire East Sea city.

“It’s a half-step void interpretation demon beast bloodline. A complete bloodline inheritance, my God!”

The demonic beast’s body trembled slightly, and its eyes were filled with an intense desire.

For a moment, it wasn’t just them, even the eyes of everyone in the surroundings slowly turned red.

They knew this demonic beast who spoke. He was an extraordinary seventh rank expert, and could be considered quite famous in eastern sea city.

His words shouldn’t be wrong!

This caused everyone’s breathing to quicken!

This was the bloodline of a half-step void interpretation demonic beast. As long as he obtained the bloodline inheritance, as long as he had the resources, he would be able to cultivate to the half-step void interpretation realm.

He didn’t need to comprehend any divine abilities, and he didn’t have any restrictions!

He could directly cultivate to the half-step void interpretation realm.

A half-step void interpretation realm expert was an invincible existence in east sea city, apart from the city Lord and the commander of the ocean cultivator corps.

A half-step void interpretation expert’s descendants would also have a high chance of inheriting the bloodline.

Generation after generation, experts came in an endless stream. There was a high chance that they would establish a clan that had been around for thousands or even tens of thousands of years.

A half-step void interpretation expert was one of the top experts in star-moon kingdom.

“Twenty seconds are up!”

Seeing the red eyes of the crowd, long yi shouted.

“Peng!”

The door to the auction closed.

“Don’t think about snatching it. If we can put it up for auction, we won’t be afraid of people snatching it!”

Long Yi said with a smile, “Apart from a half-step void interpretation realm bloodline, there will also be tier 6 and tier 7 transcendent weapons and armor sets!”

“There will be a transcendent level 9 pill, and four transcendent level 9 weapons and armor sets. A large number of treasures will definitely be able to satisfy the difference...”

“This is crazy, a half-step cave level bloodline. Oh My God, this is the real peerless treasure!”

“Demon Beast Bloodline, this is the first time I’ve seen a Demon Beast bloodline. This is a peerless treasure that can make one ascend to the heavens in one step!”

“Compared to this demon beast bloodline, those pet eggs and demon beast cubs are nothing but trash!”

“To establish a bloodline family, a top-tier bloodline family, how precious is This Demon Beast Bloodline? Ten billion middle-grade spirit stones? or more?”

“This motherf * cker is selling such a terrifying demon beast bloodline. What’s the origin of this immortal Phoenix?”

“Is this the face-smacking immortal Phoenix and the holy item of life and death? Crushing, completely crushing!”

“It is not an exaggeration to say that as long as it is a top-tier family, they would all want to fight for this Demon Beast Bloodline. Even those insightful emptiness realm experts would be tempted!”

However, as Long Yi spoke, his voice was completely covered by the exclamations around him.

He knew that just taking out one Demon Beast bloodline was enough. He did not need to introduce anything else.

Just as they said, the half-step Void Interpretation Demon Beast bloodline crushed the Phoenix Immortal, Life and death, and the holy item!

The battle between the Phoenix Immortal and the life and death holy item was a joke in front of the half-step void interpretation bloodline!
