Chapter 672: You Can’t Have Your Will When You’re In The Underworld

“There are things you can’t control while being in the Underworld!”

After Jin Kunming finished, Jin Huiao beside him drew his lips. He sized those people up, including Xiao Yu and Lan Qingyue, with an unknown glimmer in his eyes.

“How many Budding Realm experts are there in Dragon Sect? Regardless of the number of Budding Realm experts you have, do you have any Immortals?

“If you don’t have Immortal experts, any non-Immortal Sects will be just ants after the Nine Cauldron worlds descend into the real world. Any Immortal Sect could annihilate you guys with just a lift of a finger!

“Hence, your best choice is to join Primeval Chaos Immortal Sect!”

As he spoke, he swept his gaze across those Martial Artists of the Underworld. “Those who have advanced to Inborn Realm are qualified to join Primeval Chaos Immortal Sect. Those who are not can become menial disciples.”

“That’s right, this is not an invitation, but...”

Jin Kunming opened his mouth while his hand took out a little golden bell. The bell slowly grew larger in size in his palm.

Boom!

The sound of the bell echoed, just like a clap of thunder.

“It’s the Emperor’s Bell!”

Feng Jinqing, at one side, revealed a shocked expression while he let out an exclamation involuntarily.

“Emperor’s Bell. Little did I expect them to bring the Emperor’s Bell of Primeval Chaos Immortal Sect here.”

“The Emperor’s Bell is a compelling Spiritual Weapon of Immortal-class level. It can grow in size and emit golden radiance for a complete wipeout. Be it besieging or killing people, its strength is extremely daunting.”

The disciples of Yellow Sky Immortal Sect were looking all stern as they stared at the golden bell with a surprised look!

Om!

The Emperor’s Bell rose to the air, and grew to a size of a hundred meters, exuding domineering mightiness.

“From today onwards, the Dragon Sect members will join our Primeval Chaos Immortal Sect. Any objections?”

“You, Martial Artists of the Underworld, will join Primeval Chaos Immortal Sect. Any objections?”

The bright and clear voice reverberated across over a radius of ten kilometers, striking terror into every Martial Artist.

All of them had the impulse to worship the Emperor’s Bell in the air.

“What a mighty power!”

“They are not even the strongest among the Immortal Sects. How scary could the Immortals they mentioned be such that we are ants if we don’t join the Immortal Sect?”

“Is that the strength of an Immortal Sect? Can Dragon Sect resist it? This golden bell is too domineering. What a mighty power!”

The group of Martial Artists of the Underworld was aghast as they lifted their heads with difficulties. Their legs were even trembling. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Even an Inborn Expert could not directly gaze at that golden bell.

You can’t have your will when you’re in the Underworld!

All the experts of the Underworld had mixed expressions. If the nine powerful worlds were going to descend into the real world, they were only left with joining the Immortal Sect.

Staying out was impossible, as this was the Underworld!

“This is our first time being forced to join the Immortal Sect.”

Lan Qingyue cast a gaze at the Emperor’s Bell in the air before she turned to look at Jin Kunming with a slightly stern look.

“We have no choice!” Jin Kunming revealed a faint smile. “Before all the Immortal Sects arrive in the real world, we came out in advance to set our ground. Controlling some of the Underworld forces in the real world is our best choice!

“You can’t have your will when you’re in the Underworld, not even for the Immortal Sects. Thus, surrender to our Immortal Sect!”

After Jin Kunming finished his overbearing speech, all the experts from Primeval Chaos Immortal Sect moved under the Emperor’s Bell.

Close to thirty domineering Budding Realms were shrouded under the dazzling golden radiance of the Emperor’s Bell. As they exuded their god-like mightiness, they looked as though they were the golden guards and generals from Heaven.

Under the Emperor’s Bell, their strength received a significant boost.

“We’re too late!”

Feng Jinqing was looking dreadful at one side.

Their most wicked disciple in the Immortal Sect had lost to a girl, undermining the reputation of the Yellow Sky Immortal Sect.

And now, the Primeval Chaos Immortal Sect had established an invincible prestige with the help of the mighty Emperor’s Bell.

The Dragon Sect might just join the Primeval Chaos Immortal Sect too!

“Lass, join the Yellow Sky Immortal Sect, and you’ll get enough benefits!”

Feng Lingtian darkened his expression once he realized the problem. Thus, he growled at Xiao Yu with a low voice.

“Join a loser like you?”

Xiao Yu slightly lifted her head and sneered at Feng Lingtian.

“You...”

Seeing her expression, Feng Lingtian almost wanted to vomit blood!

“It’s true that you can’t have your will in the Underworld. But dragons can roar through the sky in the Underworld!” said Lan Qingyue as she stared at the old man with a broad smile.

“Hur? So you’re saying you want to rule the world?”

Jin Kunming narrowed his eyes as he stared at Lan Qingyue.

Those Budding Realm experts from Primeval Chaos Immortal Sect on the top glared at Lan Qingyue. A domineering god-like mightiness enveloped her immediately.

With a change in her expression, grey energy rose from Lan Qingyue.

“I’ll give you one last chance!”

Jin Kunming continued to fix his expressionless eyes on Lan Qingyue.

If the Dragon Sect agreed to join, that would be the best. Otherwise, it did not matter. They wanted to build their prestige and god-like reputation.

It was not a bad idea to use them as an example to forewarn the rest.

Sss...

All the experts below revealed stern looks.

All of them could tell what Jin Kunming was trying to do. Their expressions were extremely complicated.

“I don’t think Dragon King could beat the mightiness exuded by the huge golden bell in the air!”

“Plus thirty domineering Budding Realm experts. I guess the Dragon Sect is in trouble this time...”

At this time, all the Martial Artists of the Underworld had cold feet.

These people before them were invincible!

Lan Qingyue, Sun Lingxiu, Adjaya, Xiao Yu, and Elder Fang were looking dreadful.

Without the presence of that terrifying Emperor’s Bell, they would have had the confidence of breaking through the siege. But that Emperor’s Bell of Level 13 was much scarier than the Level 13 truncheon in Adjaya’s hand.

“Hur?”

At this time, Xiao Yu sensed something. She quickly gazed off and exhibited a smile, “Brother is back!”

“Hur?”

Lan Qingyue and the rest were slightly stunned as they spun around and heaved a sigh of relief. Smiles surfaced on their faces.

“Oh really? More and more people came from the Nine Cauldron Worlds!”

Wang Xian had rushed over here from Guta Mountain Range. Seeing the Emperor’s Bell that was emitting god-like mightiness above Mt. Taibai, he let out a sigh. Cold radiance flashed in his eyes.

“I have never provoked anyone from the Nine Cauldrons’ Worlds. But if people from these worlds provoke me, don’t blame me for it!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were getting colder as he hovered to Lan Qingyue and Xiao Yu at a rapid speed.

“Who are you?” Jin Kunming shouted coldly when he saw Wang Xian and a group of dragonians flying over. He narrowed his eyes slightly.

Wang Xian took a glance at him and ignored him. Seeing that Lan Qingyue was shrouded within the mightiness of the golden bell, murderous intent flashed in his eyes.

“A really good saying you’ve got. You can’t have your will when you’re in the Underworld. I don’t wish to kill, but people just want to dig their own graves!

“I’m killing you guys!”

Wang Xian’s cold voice echoed!
