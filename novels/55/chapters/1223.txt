Translator: 5496903

“This second prince is really overbearing!”

“Who told the people of the nine-star dynasty to be so unscrupulous? They actually attacked a newly opened store, but unexpectedly, they kicked an iron plate!”

“That fat young man’s identity shouldn’t be simple. However, as long as he isn’t an important prince of the nine-star dynasty, he will die today!”

When the crowd heard long Xiaotian’s words, they whispered among themselves and looked at him with interest.

“Your Highness the second Prince, don’t you have a choice? We are willing to...”

“Shut up. You have five seconds to choose. Do you want to make a move or let me do it myself!”

The nine Star Dynasty’s insightful emptiness realm expert’s expression kept changing as he spoke.

However, before he could finish speaking, he was directly interrupted.

This caused him to clench his fists tightly, his eyes filled with helplessness.

The other party’s background was much stronger than theirs, and even his strength was stronger than theirs.

He turned his head and stared at the fat youth with a stiff expression.

At this moment, the fat youth’s body was drenched in cold sweat, and his eyes were filled with endless fear.

He had never thought that he would encounter such a thing in less than two days.

He had offended the second prince of the Light Dragon Dynasty, and with his current status, he would definitely become a sacrifice.

His heart was filled with fear and despair.

The five young men and women standing behind him were shivering, feeling extremely lucky.

Fortunately, it was not him who was going to be killed.

“Haha, Second Brother, aren’t you being too overbearing? No matter what, the other party is a nine star dynasty. It’s not good for you to make enemies for our Light Dragon Dynasty!”

At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded, causing the surrounding people to be stunned once again.

Even the people from the nine Star dynasty were stunned as they hurriedly looked to the side.

On the left side of the street, more than a hundred people were walking towards them.

A young man was walking in front. He was thin and weak. He had long hair, red hair, and a pink face. He held a folding fan in his hand and looked like a scholar.

Beside him stood a middle-aged man. The middle-aged man crossed his arms and scanned his surroundings with his sharp eyes.

Behind him, Yin Xianfeng was staring at Wang Xian with hatred in his eyes.

Behind him, the strength of more than a hundred people was not weak either. This was especially so since there were more than ten young men from the six elements sect. This made the entire faction much stronger.

However, compared to Long Xiaotian who possessed the Black Shadow Panther, it was still a little lacking.

“This is? The eighth Prince of the Radiant Dragon Dynasty!”

“It’s the eighth prince. He’s now the eighth Prince of the Radiant Dragon Dynasty!”

“In the entire Radiant Dragon Dynasty, the first prince, second prince, eighth prince, sixteenth prince, and thirty-third prince are all strong contenders for the throne. Now that the second prince is faintly surpassing them, some of the princes might be getting anxious!”

The people who were watching the show whispered when they saw the eighth prince leading his subordinates.

“Eighth brother, why do you have the time to come here if you don’t develop properly?”

Long Xiaotian’s eyes revealed a trace of coldness when he saw his younger brother arrive, and he said coldly.

As rivals for the throne, the relationship between the princes was not good.

Even if they were brothers, they were not mothers.

Otherwise, he would not be only five years younger than the thirty-third prince.

“I came out to take a walk and saw you here, second brother. As a brother, I naturally want to take a look!”

The eighth Prince looked at Long Xiaotian with a face full of spring breeze and said with a smile.

After he finished speaking, he looked at the people of the Nine Star dynasty and said indifferently, “Everyone, how did you offend my second brother and make him so angry?”

“Your Highness the eighth Prince!”

The Nine Star Dynasty’s void interpretation expert was slightly stunned when he heard the eighth Prince’s words. He hurriedly cupped his hands, and a glimmer of light flashed in his eyes.

A hint of life appeared on the face of the fat young man standing at the side.

“This friend of the second prince had some friction with us, but we didn’t know that he was the second Prince’s friend, so we somewhat offended him!”

The nine-star Dynasty’s insightful emptiness realm expert immediately said.

“Huh? Just because of a small matter?”

The eighth prince pretended to be surprised and said.

“Yes, because of this matter, we wanted to use other ways to save it, but the second prince didn’t agree!”

The insightful emptiness realm expert immediately replied.

“Second brother, this is your fault. The Friends of the nine-star dynasty offended you just because they didn’t know the other party was your friend, but you killed them directly. Isn’t that a bit too much! ?”

“As the princes of the Radiant Dragon Dynasty, we can’t make enemies for the kingdom everywhere!”

The eighth Prince looked at Long Xiaotian and glanced at Wang Xian who was beside him. He said with a smile. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Huh?”

The words of the eighth prince stunned the people of the nine stars dynasty. Following that, a glint flashed in their eyes.

When the people around saw this scene, they narrowed their eyes slightly.

“The princes of the Light Dragon Dynasty are starting a game!”

“Although the second prince is stronger, the eighth prince isn’t too far behind!”

“A game between the two princes. There will be a good show today!”

When the crowd saw this scene, they understood.

The game between the two princes had begun!

“Eighth brother, do I need your guidance on what I want to Do?”

Long Xiaotian stared at him coldly and said with slight disdain.

“Naturally, I don’t have the right to guide second brother on what he wants to do, but the people of the nine Star Dynasty are my friends. I Can’t just watch my friends get killed, right?”

The eighth prince stared at Long Xiaotian in a tit-for-tat manner.

“Your Highness, Eighth Prince, Thank You, Your Highness. In the future, if the eighth prince has any orders, I, Jiuquan Liang, will definitely not refuse!”

When the fat young man standing at the side heard the eighth Prince’s words, his eyes revealed an excited expression. He hurriedly opened his mouth to express his attitude, filled with respect.

“Thank you, Eighth Prince, for helping us to stand up for ourselves!”

That insightful void martial expert also spoke to the eighth Prince with gratitude, his eyes flickering.

The battle between the two princes was actually a good thing for them.

“Eighth brother, it seems like you’re determined to go against me today!”

Long Xiaotian stared at the eighth prince, his eyes flickering as he asked.

“You help your friend, I help my friend. I’m not going against second brother!”

The eighth prince shook his head, but soon after, his expression also darkened. “But if you want to go against my friend, I absolutely won’t allow it!”

When he finished speaking, the atmosphere around them froze, and a murderous aura formed between them.

“Hehe, you and I both know very well that it’s not a waste of time to talk so much nonsense. In the future, don’t be so weird in front of me. Just say what you want to say!”

“Otherwise, I will treat you as just a weird trash!”

Long Xiaotian’s eyes were filled with disdain when he heard his words. He did not hide his disdain at all.

His words caused the eighth prince, who had been smiling, to change his expression drastically.
