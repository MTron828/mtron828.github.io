Chapter 139: He’s the King of Rivertown (1)

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Twists and turns, one after another.

The eventful twists in the Ancient Martial Arts World of Rivertown stunned everyone.

First, Yan Family declared a strong return as a King and oppressed the entire Ancient Martial Arts world in Rivertown.

Next, a mysterious young man led his Dragon Sect to challenge the Yan Family.

Everyone opened their eyes to a new world when they saw two Half-step to Inborn Experts fighting at the stage of the training ground.

But they were all waiting since their fates were closely linked to the victorious party.

All the people from the Yan Family were looking gloomy as they observed the showdown. Their arrogance and egotism were long gone.

“Too fast. We can’t see their moves clearly!”

“Is this the Half-step to Inborn Experts’ combat? It’s horrifying!”

All the Martial Artists retreated to the edge of the field as they watched the battle in horror.

All they could see were two figures exchanging hands at a fast speed, but they could not see their strokes clearly.

Yan Feng held his belt sword tightly as he stared at the field.

“Is this the best the Yan Family can do?”

Just then, Mo Yuan’s voice cut through the battle: “How dare you be arrogant when you just became a Half-step to Inborn?”

“You’re gone!”

As Mo Yuan’s cold bellow passed through again, the two entangled figures separated themselves.

Puke!

Yan Gukong’s figure kept going back with his hand clasping at the dragon-head walking stick.

Ka Ka Ka!

Puke!

Yan Gukong’s cheeks were flushed with redness as the dragon-head walking stick slowly cracked by itself. He spat a mouthful of blood and stared at Mo Yuan with an ashen face.

“What?”

Everyone was dumbfounded by what they saw. He was defeated. Yan Gukong from the Yan Family was defeated!

“The Yan Family is defeated. Rivertown is going to change hands again. That middle-aged man is incredibly powerful!”

“Gone. No one thought that the day that the King returns would be the day they would be defeated.”

The surrounding Martial Artists had mixed expressions.

“Old Yan.”

“Brother!”

The people from the Yan Family held their breath as they ran towards Yan Gukong. All of them stared at Mo Yuan with an icy cold look.

Yan Gukong was panting as he glared at Mo Yuan with a gloomy look. He gritted his teeth. “I’ve lost!”

“I think you can still go on!”

Mo Yuan walked towards Yan Gukong slowly with a sarcastic smile on his face.

“We admitted our loss. What else do you want?” an old man from the Yan Family asked Mo Yuan with an awful look.

“Just now, my friend was defeated. Didn’t you cripple him?”

Wang Xian looked at the people from the Yan Family with a mocking expression.

He cast a look at Yan Feng. With a nonchalant face, he asked, “Now you know the consequences for threatening me.”

“You...” Yan Feng stared coldly at Wang Xian without all his calmness and arrogance. “I’m the disciple of the Sacred Seas of Swords. My Master is an Inborn Expert. If you dare to lay a finger on the Yan Family, all of you will die!”

“Haha, Inborn Expert!”

Claps of thunderous laughter were heard. “Get your Inborn Expert from the Yan Family out then. Otherwise, I’ll be too bored. Haha!”

Suddenly, the laughter took over the entire training ground.

Everyone was surprised as they quickly located the source of the sound.

An old man who had been standing in front of the fifty people walked out slowly.

His hair was swaying even without the moving air as he exuded immense black aura from his body.

The demonic aura lingered. Within a range of ten meters in the sky, a demonic dragon roar could be heard vaguely.

Gulps!

“Inborn... He’s an Inborn!”

“An Inborn showed up. That old man is actually an Inborn...”

“Gosh, the Yan Family is finished! That old man is an Inborn Expert!”

“Indeed, just as Zhian said, he’s an Inborn, and he’s even more daunting than those whom I’ve met. That imposing deposition was invincible!”

All the people around shuddered as they sensed the imposing demeanor of Mo Qinglong, the Inborn Expert with mighty and powerful oppression.

The oppression made them tremble in their boots!

“Inborn Realm, would anyone from the Yan Family like to fight with me?!”

Mo Qinglong stood beside Wang Xian and swept his cold gaze across all the members of the Yan Family as he yelled.

“Inborn!”

Yan Gukong was shaking violently as despair flashed across his eyes.

Everyone from the Yan Family glanced at Mo Qinglong with fear and hopelessness.

Just now, they were acting like they were invincible to all the Martial Artists in Rivertown just like this Inborn Expert was doing now.

But at this moment, they were like those Martial Artists from before, feeling frightened against this group of people.

They had a deeper sense of despair and fear.

“I heard that the Yan Family was full of experts. The Dragon Sect would like to challenge them!” Mo Yuan exuded his imposing aura and strolled behind Wang Xian.

At the same time, the fifty Dragonians released their magnificent fighting spirit and disposition.

Demonic aura lingered around the fifty Dragonians. As the aura gathered, they looked like an army of demons.

“Gosh... They...”

Everybody stared at Mo Yuan and the fifty Dragonians. All of them had fear in their eyes.

“All of them possessed a similar demeanor to Mo Shisan.”

“Where did this Dragon Sect come from? How could they be so terrifying? How can it be?!”

“Over fifty people who could crush Yan Zhongyuan. Hehe. The Yan Family is finished!”

“How could it be? How could it be!” Yan Gukong could not believe his eyes when he saw the demeanor displayed by the Dragonians.

Yan Feng had an extremely awful look on his face. More than fifty powerful existences with a Half-step to Inborn and an Inborn Expert.

Things had gone beyond his expectations.

“What do you want?” Yan Gukong asked in a low voice with a dreadful look.

Now, he did not even dare to raise his voice. He was no different from those families and Martial Artists just now.

“You were the one who invited me here. What do you think?”

Wang Xian looked at Yan Gukong, then turned to Yan Zhongyuan, who was on the floor, and Yan Feng. He asked playfully, “All of you said there will be another corpse in the Bohai Sea if I offended the Yan Family. You all even asked me to think of my friends. Haha!”

Wang Xian chuckled and stared at Yan Gukong. His expression turned cold. “You tell me what I should do!”

His words caused embarrassment to the Yan Family. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

If anyone dared to speak to the Yan Family like this, there would be no doubt about the consequence–extermination!

When they thought about it, all of them trembled.

“I’m the disciple of the Sacred Seas of Swords. They have dozens of Inborn Experts. But this time, the Yan Family lost,” Yan Feng said slowly as his body shook and he stared at Wang Xian.

His words hinted a warning and a plead.

He mentioned Sacred Seas of Swords because he wanted to protect the Yan Family!

“Why are you admitting defeat now?!” Wang Xian stared at Yan Feng and said sarcastically. “Didn’t you want me to submit to the Yan Family, and think about my friends?”

“Besides, do you think I’ll let you off when you mention Sacred Seas of Swords?”
