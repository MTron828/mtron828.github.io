“Eh? That is...?”

“Aren’t they the siblings, Wang Xian and Wang Yu?”

“Yea, it’s really them! This... How can this be possible? They even had trouble gathering the school fees previously? How can they afford to drive such a good car now?”

“Although these sibling are poor, they are pretty good in studies and have qualified for the first-tier university.”

“Did they engage in illegal dealings? Otherwise, how can they afford such a good car?”

“I believe they borrowed it from others!”

The people of the current era were no longer as pure and honest. They had a serious mentality comparing with others.

Comparing their cars, comparing the results of their kids and comparing the conditions of the family.

Wang Xian and Wang Yu’s family was the poorest among the 70-80 families in this area.

When their grandmother was still alive, she couldn’t do much because of her old age. They were barely able to make ends meets by doing some farming and receiving aid from their neighbour, Uncle Zhang.

When the people tried to educate their kids, they always liked to use Wang Xian and Wang Yu as examples. Look at you! Take a look at Wang Xian and Wang Yu. Their results are so good even though they barely get enough food. What about you? You get to eat well and live in a comfortable environment and yet your results are so bad!

Although they were complimenting Wang Xian and Wang Yu for doing well in their studies, they were also commenting on their family background.

They were really poor!

When Wang Xian heard the exclamations and doubts from his neighbour, he wasn’t bothered.

Among the surrounding 70-80 families, only Uncle Zhang had been kind to them from the bottom of his heart.

As for the other families, Wang Xian didn’t want to comment.

He could still remember the incident when his neighbour, who had a relatively good relationship with them, hired Xiao Yu to give tutoring to their daughter.

After giving tutoring for over a month, they only gave Xiao Yu $300.

Each session lasted three to four hours and she was giving their daughter tutoring every day. Yet, they only paid her $300. This left him speechless and helpless at those moments.

They knew clearly that Wang Xian’s family wasn’t doing well and took advantage of them. This made Wang Xian and Xiao Yu disappointed.

However, they were both young at that time and didn’t speak up about it.

Since then, he finally got a clear view of the kind of people they were.

Wang Xian took out the key and opened the door.

It was a small house and it didn’t have many things in it.

Other than a simple sofa and a few stools, the left and right rooms were Xiao Yu’s and his bedroom respectively. As Xiao Yu had cleaned the place before he went to Rivertown for her studies, the house wasn’t very dirty.

“Take out the presents! Let’s go to Uncle Zhang’s house!” Wang Xian said to Xiao Yu as he walked to the back of the car and took out some gifts.

Wang Xian had personally bought these gifts. Uncle Zhang liked to drink tea and therefore Wang Xian bought him some tea leaves.

Pu’er tea leaves from the 1980s! Each catty would cost $120,000 and Wang Xian bought two boxes for Uncle Zhang.

Five sticks of premium cigarettes from “Huang Helou” and “Supreme Ruler” which cost $18,000 in total.

Uncle Zhang didn’t drink and therefore Wang Xian did not buy alcohol for him. He also bought Aunt Zhang some cosmetics and accessories which cost a bomb too.

As for Sister Li, he bought her a watch that cost over a hundred thousand.

“Let’s go!” Wang Xian carried the gifts and said to Xiao Yu.

“Alright, brother!”

The two of them headed out of their house. However, when they reached the door, they saw three housewives, a middle-aged man and an old man walking towards their house. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Eh. Xiao Xian, Xiao Yu? Did you guys... strike the lottery?”

The crowd at the door looked over inquisitively. They noticed the gifts in Wang Xian’s hands and asked their question curiously.

“We did make some money!” Seeing that they were their neighbours and seniors, Wang Xian smiled and nodded his head.

“Where are you guys going?” Seeing Wang Xian carrying the gifts, the middle-aged man smiled and asked.

“We are going to Uncle Zhang’s house. We got him some gifts.” Wang Xian said plainly before continuing. “We’ll be going over now.”

“Eh, what are you carrying? Huang Helou? Supreme Ruler? Pu’er Tea?”

That middle-aged man was surprised by the gifts in Wang Xian’s hands.

“Just some small tokens,” Wang Xian said plainly before heading to a nearby house with Xiao Yu.

“What’s Huang Helou? What’s Supreme Ruler?” the housewives standing by the side asked the middle-aged man inquisitively.

“Cigarettes.” The middle-aged man’s eyes were still fixed on Wang Xian’s gifts. His eyes were full of shock.

“How valuable could cigarettes be?” The group of housewives sneered.

“One stick costs approximately $1,800. He had 10 sticks with him and so those are close to $20,000.”

The middle-aged man lit a cigarette from the cigarette pack that cost $10 as he spoke.

“$1,800 for a stick? So expensive?”

“Oh my gosh. Can it be that the Wang siblings have really gotten rich?”

“Let’s go take a look!”

The crowd followed behind curiously as they headed towards Uncle Zhang’s house.

When Wang Xian and Xiao Yu arrived at the doorstep, a land rover, which cost approximately two to three million dollars, drove out from Uncle Zhang’s house.

Wang Xian was taken aback. Through the car window, he could see that it was a young man who was driving the car.

Uncle Zhang and his family did not send him off and this made Wang Xian a little suspicious.

“Have the wedding matters been settled?”

“Who knows? Xiao Li is marrying into a rich family but this might not be a good thing after all.”

“That’s true. I heard that she’s getting married only because she is pregnant! Hehe!”

“Yeah. I heard rumors that the groom’s family wasn’t agreeable to this wedding.”

Comments from the housewives sounded from behind Wang Xian and Xiao Yu.

Wang Xian frowned. After seeing that the land rover had driven off, he walked through the main door.

Once he was in the yard, he could see Uncle Zhang and his family sitting in the living room. Uncle Zhang was smoking and was clearly not looking pleased.

“Uncle Zhang!” Wang Xian shouted.

Uncle Zhang was taken aback. When he saw Wang Xian and Xiao Yu, he immediately extinguished the cigarette in his hand and revealed a smile. “Wang Xian and Xiao Yu, you guys are finally on break!”

Uncle Zhang had taken great care of Wang Xian and this might be because he did not have a son.

“Yeah, we got back once the school break started. We bought you some gifts too!” Wang Xian replied and walked towards the house.

“Why did you even bring gifts over? Are you rich now? Take them away, take them away!”

Seeing Wang Xian carrying bags of gifts with him, he reprimanded Wang Xian fiercely.

“Hehe, I really am a little rich now!”

Wang Xian chuckled as he walked in and placed the gifts on the table.

He had been to Uncle Zhang’s house for meals frequently. Therefore, both Wang Xian and Xiao Yu were familiar with the place.

“Why did you go to the expense of buying gifts? Just make sure you guys can take care of yourself!” Aunt Zhang stood up and grumbled. “Take them away, take them away.”

Wang Xian felt warmth from their actions. He smiled and replied, “We have already bought them and can’t get a refund on these.”

“You kids!”

“Old Zhang, take a look at what Xiao Xian got for you! Xiao Xian and Xiao Yu came in a luxury car just a while ago. That car is worth at least several million!”

Behind them, the neighbour who followed Wang Xian toward Uncle Zhang’s family commented curiously.

“Luxury car?” Uncle Zhang was stunned. He then looked at the gifts in the bags.

10 sticks of cigarettes. These were the kind that he had never smoked before. In addition, there were two boxes of tea leaves which were his favourites.

“Huang Helou, Supreme Leader and ‘8582 brand Pu’er Tea Leaves.’”

Sister Li, who had been standing by the table, suddenly revealed a surprised look after taking a look at the gifts.

“I heard that Huang Helou and Supreme Ruler both cost $1,800 a stick. My box of cigarettes only cost me slightly over $100. A single stick is enough for me to get 10 boxes of cigarettes!” a middle-aged man commented with envy.

“So expensive?” Uncle Zhang was shocked.

“Dad, these cigarettes are cheap in comparison. 8582 Pu’er Tea leaves are the really expensive ones. A box will cost at least a few hundred thousand,” Sister Li commented.

“What?”
