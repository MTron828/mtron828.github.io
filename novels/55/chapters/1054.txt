“21 billion!”

“22 billion!”

“24 billion!”

...

Inside the Phoenix Immortal auction house, the entire auction hall was extremely quiet. No one dared to speak.

Four to five thousand people sat quietly on their chairs. They raised their heads and looked up at the private rooms on the second and third floors.

Over there, the voices of bids rang out one after another. Each bid caused the hearts of everyone in the hall to tremble uncontrollably.

Over 20 billion! Not to mention 20 billion, even 200 million was a huge fortune for many people.

Even if the vast majority of their strength was not lower than transcendent sixth rank.

However, 20 billion was a number that many people would never dare to imagine in their entire lives.

“Only those top-tier chambers of commerce and those large clans that possess profound void martial experts would be able to fork out 20 billion!”

Everyone thought to themselves.

“30 billion middle-grade spirit stones, is there anyone else who wants to raise the price? !”

In less than five minutes, the price had reached 30 billion middle-grade spirit stones, and everyone sucked in a breath of cold air.

“31 billion!”

Right at this moment, a voice that was more familiar to the people of Eastern Sea city sounded.

“It’s City Lord Lei!”

“I didn’t Expect City Lord Lei to make a move!”

“Oh my God, 31 billion middle-grade spirit stones!”

City Lord Lei started to compete, causing some people in the hall to start discussing in low voices.

Even City Lord Lei started to compete. One could imagine the allure of this half-step void interpretation demonic beast bloodline.

The city lord of star-moon kingdom was a top-tier existence in the entire kingdom. After all, there were only ten cities in the entire kingdom.

“32 billion!”

“33 billion!”

“34 billion!”

However, City Lord Lei’s Bid didn’t cause any ripples to the people in the private room.

No one who could sit in the private room was weak.

After all, the city lord was only a city lord. He couldn’t compare to those large business groups and large clans that had accumulated wealth for thousands of years.

Very quickly, the price reached 40 billion.

“Sigh, this time, a few thousand-year-old clans have come. Their foundations are too deep!”

City Lord Lei clenched his fists with a face full of unwillingness. Even if he was the city lord, he could not compete with these large clans.

After all, their Lei clan rose up because of him.

The other high-level officials in the room did not dare to say anything.

This kind of auction was not something they could participate in.

“Oh my God, it’s 40 billion already. It’s the sound coming from the private room next to us!”

At this moment, Zhang Yushu and the rest who were sitting in the private room on the third floor widened their eyes and looked at the auction in astonishment.

They were actually sitting in a private room of the same level as a group of big shots.

This... was a little sour!

“It’s 40 billion already, Haha!”

At this moment, Wang Xian, who was on the fourth floor, revealed an excited expression. It was 40 billion already and the price was still rising.

With this 40 billion, his strength could be directly raised by two levels.

He looked down with excitement.

Feng Luan, who was behind him, laughed in amusement.

“51 billion, 51 billion. Is there anyone else who has a higher price than this?”

After a few minutes, the price of the auction came to 51 billion.

After reaching more than 40 billion, there weren’t many people bidding. Only three people were competing.

When the price reached 47 billion, one person stopped bidding, and only two people were competing.

“51 billion going once, 51 billion going twice!”

“Peng, Deal. Congratulations to the customers in Room 203, congratulations on obtaining the half-step void interpretation level wind wing Savage Fish Bloodline!”

After a stifling competition, the price of the half-step Void Interpretation Demonic Beast bloodline finally stopped at 51 billion, a price that made everyone feel crazy. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

51 billion mid-grade spirit stones, a void interpretation expert killing more than ten void interpretation demonic beasts, couldn’t even be sold for such a price.

The entire Eastern Sea city’s annual tax revenue was only this number.

“If this 50 billion is given to me, I feel like I can live for a thousand years!”

“F * ck, this is simply too crazy, which family bought this!”

“Hiss, I can finally speak. I don’t even dare to utter a fart with the voices of those big shots just now!”

After the deal was done, everyone looked at the seat of box 203 with envy, their faces full of respect.

At this moment, the seven or eight people in box 203 wiped the cold sweat on their faces, followed by excited expressions.

They had succeeded!

With their resources and this half-step void interpretation demonic beast bloodline, they could definitely build a powerful family.

For a half-step void interpretation demonic beast bloodline family, 51 billion was worth it!

And now, the person who was the most excited was none other than Wang Xian!

A half-step void interpretation demonic beast bloodline could earn so much money. If he were to take out his divine dragon bloodline, wouldn’t the entire world go crazy.

Of course, Wang Xian wouldn’t sell his divine dragon bloodline unless he wanted to die!

The auction continued. After the sale of the half-step Void Interpretation Demonic Beast bloodline, there was another treasure that was worth competing for.

That was the half-step void interpretation pet egg.

The lifespan of a ferocious beast was similar to that of a human. A half-step void interpretation pet could live for at least 500 years.

Having a half-step void interpretation beast as a guardian in the family could at least preserve the family’s glory for 500 years.

Many items were auctioned off one by one. This was especially so for the weapon set that Wang Xian had personally refined. Many people were fighting over it.

The weapon that Feng Xian had prepared was also auctioned off by many people.

In the end, when the final item, the half-step void interpretation pet egg, was auctioned off with 8.5 billion middle-grade spirit stones, the entire auction ended.

“51 billion, plus all the other items, a total of 54.3 billion middle-grade spirit stones!”

After the auction ended, Wang Xian began to calculate on the fourth floor. His eyes were burning with passion.

“You’re Rich?”

Feng Luan, who was at the side, asked him with a smile.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile and said directly, “How many pills do you have? Give them all to Me First!”

“Alright, I’ll be going back tomorrow morning. There’s no need to send me off. I should be back in a month’s time. Contact me on the communication stone plate!”

Feng Luan said to Wang Xian.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded.

The auction had ended. Wang Xian took the pills worth more than 30 billion from Feng Luan and immediately went to his residence.

These pills included the pills that the customers used to exchange for Spirit Stones Tonight, as well as the pills that Feng Luan had transferred from other cities in advance.

Now that Wang Xian’s cultivation base was at transcendent level five, to advance to transcendent level six, he would need elixirs that were worth more than one billion middle-grade spirit stones.

To advance to transcendent level seven, he would need elixirs that were worth more than ten billion middle-grade spirit stones.

Next would be the advancement of the group of strange demons and Golden Swordfish.

The remaining twenty billion would be sufficient to elevate them to the peak level below the insightful emptiness realm.

When Wang Xian returned to his residence, he immediately swallowed all the elixirs in his mouth!
