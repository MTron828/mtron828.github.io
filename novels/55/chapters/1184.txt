“Hiss, is that an expert at the void interpretation level? He actually has a mount at the void interpretation level. Furthermore, he should be the one who released the healing ability just now. What a powerful strength!”

“He killed two half-step void interpretation level blood barbaric demonic beasts instantly when he attacked just now. He should be an existence at the void interpretation level!”

“That’s great. A top-notch expert actually passed by. Haha, Our Home Is Saved!”

At the position of the city wall of wind salt town, everyone’s eyes were filled with excitement when they saw Wang Xian who had suddenly appeared.

No matter what, they had never expected that such a terrifying expert would suddenly appear when they were in despair and save all of them.

Their eyes were filled with respect as they looked at Wang Xian who was floating in the sky.

“My Luck is really good!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The young man looked at Wang Xian with a hint of excitement in his eyes. Looking at Wang Xian’s figure, he was a little hesitant.

“Thank you, brother, for your help!”

At this moment, the white-robed middle-aged man who was fighting against the Void Interpretation Level Blood Barbarian demonic beast swept his gaze across the battlefield. When he saw the spirit purple qilin who was crazily devouring the demonic beast, his pupils contracted slightly as he flew towards Wang Xian, he cupped his hands respectfully.

“You’re welcome!”

Wang Xian shook his head and said plainly, “It was a coincidence. I saw everyone fighting with their lives on the line and decided to lend a helping hand!”

“Thank you for your help, Senior!”

At this moment, the young man below flew towards the sky and looked at Wang Xian curiously. He bowed and thanked him.

At the city wall, the old man and the young girl were also flying over with excited faces.

The two of them looked at Wang Xian and thanked him as well.

“I’m not a senior!”

Wang Xian smiled and shook his head.

“HMM? This brother, you haven’t reached the insightful void stage yet?”

The middle-aged man in White was slightly taken aback. He looked at Wang Xian with a surprised expression and sized him up from head to toe.

Wang Xian smiled and nodded his head.

The middle-aged man in White was slightly taken aback. His eyes were filled with astonishment. Even the young man at the side had a look of shock on his face.

To have a void interpretation level mount before breaking through to the void interpretation stage?

To be able to instantly kill two half-step void interpretation bloody savage beasts before reaching the void interpretation stage?

This...

Even the top ten heaven’s favorites in the Liuhai region might not be able to do it.

Especially the healing divine ability that Wang Xian displayed just now. It was simply heaven-defying!

The young man and the white-robed middle-aged man looked at each other and saw the shock in each other’s eyes.

“I am Long Xiaotian, the second Prince of the Radiant Dragon Dynasty. Thank you for saving my life, brother. May I know how I should address you?”

Long Xiaotian looked at Wang Xian and cupped his hands enthusiastically once again.

“Wang Xian!”

Wang Xian looked at the young man and was slightly surprised. He had never heard of the Radiant Dragon Dynasty. However, there were records of the Radiant Dragon Dynasty on the map.

The Radiant Dragon Dynasty occupied a rather large area. It was a very powerful dynasty.

“I wonder where brother Wang Xian is going. If you are not in a hurry, you can rest in my windsalt town. We would like to thank brother Wang Xian for saving our lives!”

Long Xiaotian asked Wang Xian.

“I am preparing to head to the cemetery of the human and demon. This is my first time here. I don’t know the exact location of the cemetery of the human and demon. I wonder if Brother Long Xiaotian knows the direction of the cemetery of the human and Demon!”

Wang Xian asked with a smile.

“Cemetery of humans and demons?”

Long Xiaotian was slightly stunned before a look of pleasant surprise appeared in his eyes. “Brother Wang Xian, you’re going to the cemetery of humans and demons? The cemetery of humans and demons isn’t too far away from here!”

“I’m also going to the cemetery of humans and demons for training in a few days. Brother Wang Xian, why don’t you wait for two days and we’ll head there together?”

When Wang Xian heard his words, a hint of hesitation appeared on his face.

“Brother Wang Xian, you are not familiar with the place in the tomb of the demi-human. I know it very well. Furthermore, there are people from the royal family there. It will be more convenient for you if we go together!”

Long Xiaotian saw that Wang Xian was moved and said hurriedly.

“HMM, that’s good!”

Wang Xian pondered for a moment and nodded slowly. “Sorry to Disturb You Then!”

“No, no, no. I, Long Xiaotian, would like to thank brother Wang Xian for your help this time!”

Long Xiaotian said happily.

Wang Xian nodded his head with a smile.

“Roar!”

At this moment, the low roar of the spirit purple unicorn could be heard. It grinned and flew towards Wang Xian with a smile.

“Clean up the blood in your mouth!”

Wang Xian looked at the blood in its mouth and said to it.

“Roar!”

Ling Zilin responded. With a jolt of the Lightning in its mouth, the blood and minced meat disappeared.

Long Xiaotian and the rest were shocked when they saw Ling Zilin being so obedient.

“Brother Wang Xian, your pet is so strong and obedient!”

Long Xiaotian looked at Ling Zilin’s ferocious beast with envy.

He, a prince of the Radiant Dragon Dynasty, was not qualified to have a pet of the insightful void tier.

“I’m a Beast Tamer!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly.

“Beast Tamer?”

Wang Xian’s words shocked long Xiaotian and the rest once again. An inexplicable look appeared in their eyes.

“Brother Wang Xian, let’s talk in the town!”

Long Xiaotian did not ask further. He suppressed the curiosity in his heart and invited Wang Xian.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded. He dared to fly into the town beside Long Xiaotian and the rest.

“Brother Wang Xian, Please!”

Below, everyone in wind salt town looked at Wang Xian with gratitude. Then, they looked at the spiritual purple qilin who was flying in the air behind him. Their eyes were filled with respect.

Long Xiaotian instructed the elder beside him about some matters in the town and led Wang Xian into the mayor’s residence.

“Brother Wang Xian, please take a seat!”

When they arrived at the mayor’s residence, Long Xiaotian gestured to Wang Xian, following that, he took out a jade bottle from his interspatial ring and said, “Brother Wang Xian, you have saved the entire windy salt city. I, Long Xiaotian, am truly unable to repay you. Please accept this small gift, brother!”

“HMM?”

Wang Xian saw the jade bottle that he handed over. There were three pills in the jade bottle.

Each of the pills that were half-step void interpretation could extract more than 200,000 dragon crystals. After hesitating for a moment, he took it over with a smile.

“Then we are even!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly.

“Haha, Wang Xian saved our entire wind salt town. How can a few pills be enough to make us even!”

Long Xiaotian smiled happily. “It’s already late. Wang Xian didn’t have a good meal even after traveling for such a long time, right? I’ll get someone to prepare some of the special delicacies of wind salt town. Let’s have a good drink!”

“That would be troublesome!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile.

It was already late at night. Long Xiaotian had prepared a table full of dishes for them.

Apart from them, there was also a white-robed middle-aged man who was a powerhouse at the first level of the insightful emptiness realm and a young girl.

From their conversation, Wang Xian learned that he was the second prince of the Guanglong dynasty. Being the mayor of wind and salt town was purely a test for the princes.

The most outstanding prince would become the Crown Prince and have the right to inherit the throne.

The next test would be at the tomb of the transvestite.
