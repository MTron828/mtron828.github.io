Chapter 391: Since You Are Here, Don’t Bother Leaving (3)

Bam!

The burly Elder fell flat onto the ground while all vitals from his body disappeared in a flash.

Within a short few seconds, another Elder from the Sacred Followers Guild had been taken down, making everyone shudder in utter shock.

This had been an Elder from a Sacred Sect which made him one powerful Elder to think he had been taken down with one strike.

This time, all the young men could see that the young man had not resorted to using any Inborn Spiritual Weapons.

Many within the underworld had rumored that it was because of the Inborn Spiritual Weapon that the young man could defeat Inborn Experts easily.

Yet, the young man had not used any weapons right now.

Nonetheless, he had killed an Elder from the Sacred Followers Guild under such circumstances.

Horror of horrors!

“Young lad, off to hell you go. Otherwise, we, the Sacred Followers Guild, will never rest till one of us dies!” an Elder from the Sect hollered with a contorted look. As he shouted, he aimed for Wang Xian’s head with the sharp knife in his hand.

“Never rest till one of us dies? Then all of you from the Sacred Followers Guild shall perish today!” Wang Xian retorted coolly as the Energy of the Metal Dragon made him shimmer in golden.

Under the gloomy weather, the glow made Wang Xian shine like a glorious and powerful monarch.

As he arched his claws, he slashed four other Elders of the Sacred Followers Guild who were standing at a side.

Tsk, tsk, tsk!

As his arm swung past, the frightening golden claws lashed at the quartet. The Energy of the Metal Dragon made the four Elders flinch.

“Buzz off!” one of the Elders shouted as his eye twitched in trepidation.

The seemingly ordinary attacks from this young man had made him sense an impending danger of death.

The golden scratch marks appeared as though they could tear his body apart, causing him to resist them instinctively out of fear.

Wang Xian watched with an apathetic look. Given his current powers, getting rid of an Inborn was an easy feat.

As he saw his claws being restrained by the four Elders, Wang Xian shuffled them about and turned to strike at the Elder who stood in the center of the group.

“Scram!” the Elder barked as he saw Wang Xian’s claws coming for him while he attempted to block them by smacking his long sword in front of him.

Creak, crack!

“Ah!” the Elder let out a cry.

Yet, the terrifying claws cut right through the precious sword and stabbed the Elder’s chest.

As the piercing scream rang in the air, the hearts of everyone around palpitated.

“You’re not of the Inborn level. You’re definitely not!” the Elders gasped.

At the sight of how easily Wang Xian had taken down their comrade, the remaining three Elders of the Sacred Followers Guild shrieked with contorted faces, while one of them growled with wide eyes.

“An Inborn expert can’t be this powerful. Even if you’re Half-Step to Dan Realm, you can’t be this strong either!” another Elder exclaimed. As he spoke, he stopped his attacks and retreated several steps back involuntarily before looking at Wang Xian in disbelief.

He seemed very relaxed after killing one of their Elders with a single strike.

Such a formidable feat could not have been achieved by an Inborn expert.

In fact, not even a Half-step to Dan Realm.

While they also had Half-step to Dan Realms within the Sacred Sect, none of them could match up to the prowess of this young man!

As two Elders had been killed, the remaining three from the Sacred Followers Guild shuddered as they looked on with fear.

Just what sort of person had they offended?

“Haha! Did you really assume that I, Wang Xian, fear your Sacred Followers Guild?” Wang Xian snorted as he took a glance at the bodies which lay beneath him. With a shift of stance, he lunged straight at the last three Elders for attack.

“Like I said, all of you will have to die!” Wang Xian howled.

“You...” The trio shook at the sight of Wang Xian coming for them. Their haughtiness and confidence of the past were now replaced with trepidation.

From the looks of it, the mention of “self-termination” earlier...

Ah! Ah!

Just then, a series of piercing screams rang out continuously, drawing the attention of the three Elders from the Scared Followers Guild.

They saw the leader of the Sacred Enforcers crying out in despair, as one of the middle-aged men from Wang Xian’s gang seared right through his body.

They also saw the numerous members of the Sacred Enforcers getting slayed by the other five Inborn experts.

One by one, one move at a time.

Just how could that young man be this powerful?

“Little wonder why you’d dare to wait for our arrival here, and why you’d dare to pit against us Sacred Followers Guild!” one of the Elders choked with his fists tightened while his face seemed very pale.

“How’s this possible... This is impossible... Absolutely impossible!” the group of young men who had come in hopes of a good show shrieked with eyes wide. They looked on at the sight in front of them in disbelief.

To think that powerful experts of the Sacred Followers Guild had been massacred without the slightest resistance.

Within a short two minutes, three Inborn experts had been slayed, while the remaining three had no means to resist at all.

“Before this... the Elder of the Sacred Followers Guild had mentioned that he was not Inborn. So that... that means...” One of the youths gulped as he watched in stupefaction.

“Realm above Inborn. He must be at the realm above Inborn, being able to slay an Inborn expert with such ease. He’s definitely a legendary Immortal of the Land!” he continued.

“What? How’s this possible, he’s only twenty years old. How can a twenty-year-old be this powerful!?” the group of young men stared with wide eyes while their legs nearly gave way due to the thorough shock.

“It’s doomed. All experts of the Sacred Followers Guild are doomed!”

“So it turns... turns out that he had no need to fear the Sacred Followers Guild at all, given such formidable prowess. Little wonder why he didn’t run away!”

“Slaying all experts of the Sacred Followers Guild without the slightest reservation. He’s out to become their nemesis!”

Standing in a daze, the young men shook at the sight of the massacre.

They had come to witness the slaughter of the demon-like genius, Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown.

But, little had they expected such an outcome!

A reputable Sacred Sect ended up crushed, slayed with such ease.

Ah, ah, ah!

The blood-curdling screams rang through the air once again. All the young men looked on bleakly as they watched the final three Elders of the Sacred Followers Guild being taken down.

Bam, bam, bam!

The corpses lay on the ground, as though the thunder from the sky had blasted right through their hearts.

As the screams dissipated, another twenty-plus corpses were added onto the ground. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Subconsciously, the young men receded several steps back. In awe and with fear, they gazed at the young man who remained standing amidst the chaos while not a trace of blood could be seen on him.

The young man remained as before, without the slightest stir of emotions, as he appeared calm as still water.

But the crowd had witnessed otherwise, how this young man had taken down five Inborn experts within a mere few minutes.

Where the five were Elders from a Sacred Sect.

Blob, blob!

One of the youths gulped. As his legs began to turn to jelly, he turned around in an attempt to get out of the villa.

He wanted to get as far as he possibly could, away from this hellish place as his heart surged with an outburst of regret and trepidation.

He would never have come here, had he expected such an outcome!

Shaken, the rest of the petrified crowd also tried desperately to make their escape, upon the sight of someone leaving.

“Like I said. Since you’re here, don’t bother leaving!”

Right then, a satanic voice lingered in their ears.
