Chapter 963: 0964, a heavy price to pay

Translator: 549690339

The green-armored old man had the surname of Xia. He was the deputy dean of the Demon Hunter College, an expert at transcendent level eight.

Jin Liuyan and Zhou Hanhan, who were at the side, widened their eyes when they heard the conversation between Dean Xia and Wang Xian.

To a freshman who had yet to enroll in the Demon Hunter College who wanted him to stay in the college after graduation?

The college would gift him a house directly?

He could even come to the college directly if he needed anything!

Each of these conditions was something that all the students of the Demon Hunters Academy yearned for.

Which student of the Demon Hunters Academy didn’t wish to stay in the academy and enjoy an extremely high salary, social status, and background.

However, the vice dean of the academy had promised these conditions to a new student. If others were to find out, they would definitely be envious.

However, with Wang Xian’s talent, strength, and potential, he was definitely qualified to enjoy these resources.

At the side, everyone in the merchant caravan who saw this scene had shocked expressions on their faces. They stared at this scene with their mouths Agape.

Elder Xiao and supervisor Du’s expressions were even more embarrassed and desperate. They stood at the side nervously. Their expressions kept changing and they were filled with worry!

“Student Wang Xian, we still have an urgent mission to complete. We Won’t disturb you anymore. The Demon Hunters Academy will officially start its semester in two days. I’ll bring you to meet the other higher-ups of our Academy!”

Vice President Xia said to Wang Xian.

“Alright, See You Then!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile.

“Then we’ll take our leave First!”

Vice-principal Xia and the rest stood up and cupped their fists at Wang Xian.

With this attitude, they didn’t treat Wang Xian as a student of the Demon Hunters Academy.

After all, Wang Xian was too strong. They didn’t dare to raise their status.

Especially the middle-aged instructor who was controlled by Wang Xian. His face was filled with bitterness.

Being beaten up by a student, he was the first in the Demon Hunters Academy.

“Goodbye!”

Wang Xian smiled and waved his hand.

Vice Principal Xia and the other thirteen people moved and flew towards the back.

When the members of the caravan saw them leaving, their expressions changed drastically.

“My Lords, without you guys, how... how are we going to go back?”

An old man shouted at them in panic.

However, vice principal Xia did not pay any attention to them.

“What... What should we do?”

In an instant, everyone was terrified. With their abilities, it was extremely difficult for them to cross the Wind Arrow Mountain.

If it was like the last time, all of them would die here.

“Elder Xiao, supervisor du, please give us an explanation!”

At this moment, Wang Xian’s voice rang out.

Everyone looked at Wang Xian, who was sitting there and calmly tasting the ghost-faced crab meat.

In the end, everyone’s gaze was focused on the green vine chamber of Commerce and the Xiao Family Chamber of Commerce.

Elder Xiao and supervisor du’s expressions changed drastically. They lowered their heads slowly and did not speak.

“Green Vine Chamber of Commerce, Xiao Family Chamber of Commerce, you guys are really cunning and cunning. You actually ordered the Spirit Beast mercenary group to assassinate the Zhou Family Chamber of Commerce. You want to murder them for money. Now, hurry up and compensate them!”

“That’s right. Elder Xiao, supervisor Du, I didn’t expect you guys to do such a thing. Leader Wang, what they did has nothing to do with us. We are willing to give you guys a sum of money. We hope that you guys can bring us along!”

“We will use all the resources that the Green Vine Chamber of Commerce and the Xiao Chamber of Commerce sent this time to make up for their mistakes. Leader Wang, please let us follow you guys!”

The people in charge of the Chamber of Commerce suddenly spoke up.

They looked at Old Xiao and old du in disgust as they tried to curry favor with Wang Xian.

“You... You Bunch of bastards!”

Upon hearing the words of the members of the Chamber of Commerce around them, manager Du and old Xiao glared at them angrily and shouted loudly.

“Manager Du, Old Xiao, you guys better shut up. If it wasn’t for you guys, we would have been able to get to this stage. You guys are cunning and vicious. Humph, people like you guys should be thrown into the Wilderness!”

“That’s right. A perfectly fine caravan almost killed all of us because of you!”

The group of people in charge of the Chamber of Commerce said sharply.

“You still dare to talk about me? who was the one who said that we should kill the Zhou Chamber of Commerce and take them away...”

“You’d better shut up. We Aren’t as despicable as you to send the Spirit Beast mercenary group to assassinate them. In the end, it was fortunate that Commander Wang was here. Otherwise, you bunch of scoundrels would have succeeded!”

“All of you... all of you...”

Supervisor du and elder Xiao’s bodies trembled as they argued with the people in charge of the Chamber of Commerce. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian, who was standing at the side, listened to their words coldly.

“Take out all the spirit stones and resources in your hands. I will bring all of you back to Donghai City!”

He spoke to all the chambers of Commerce and the mercenary group indifferently.

As soon as Wang Xian finished his words, everyone stopped shouting and looked at him one by one.

“Green Vine Chamber of Commerce and Xiao Chamber of Commerce, leave behind all the valuable items and leave on your own!”

Wang Xian added indifferently.

“Alright, I’ll pay. My life is more important. We can earn more if we run out of Spirit Stones!”

A middle-aged man gritted his teeth and said in a low voice, “Captain Wang, as long as you can bring us to Donghai City, we’ll give you all our money!”

“I’ll give it to you too!”

The people in charge of the Chamber of Commerce agreed with an embarrassed expression.

They had been forced into a desperate situation. Their lives were more important than money.

“Come here!”

A few people from the mercenary group looked at each other. They instantly walked to supervisor du and elder Xiao’s side and directly grabbed them.

“Come, find all the valuable things on their bodies and send them to Commander Wang!”

“You... What are you doing? I’m warning you, our Ivy and Xiao Chambers of commerce will not let you off!”

“Shut up!”

A few mercenary groups tore their clothes and took their interspatial rings and all the valuable items.

“Commander Wang, all the goods of the caravan are yours. Please take us back to East Sea City!”

A few people in charge of the mercenary group and the Chamber of Commerce walked over and said with an awkward expression.

“Hehe, Alright!”

Wang Xian smiled expressionlessly and looked at Father Zhou. “I’ll have to trouble president Zhou to come to Donghai City and help me sell all the goods!”

“Also, if you guys want to seek revenge, you can look for me at the Demon Hunters Academy. My name is Wang Xian!”

Wang Xian stood up and said to everyone with an unpleasant expression.

“No, no, no!”

Everyone said hurriedly.

They really didn’t dare to. After learning that the 13 people were the higher-ups of the Demon Hunters Academy, they knew that this young man in front of them was definitely not someone they could provoke.

To dare to be enemies with the demon Hunters Academy was simply courting death.

Wang Xian didn’t bother with them. He was about to enter Donghai City anyway.

The Dragon Assassin organization was also about to enter Donghai city. It wouldn’t be long before the dragon assassin organization stirred up another storm of blood!
