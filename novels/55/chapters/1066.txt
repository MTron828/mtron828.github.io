“You...”

When Hai Wen heard Wang Xian’s words, he shut his mouth. His face darkened instantly as he glared at Wang Xian with a cold expression.

“We will naturally be able to tell if you have the ability to carry out the next mission. Director Qian, if Your Demon Hunter Academy still loses so much in the future, it would be embarrassing!”

The old man in front interrupted Hai Wen’s words and said to director Qian with a smile on his face.

Director Qian’s face turned black, and the three instructors beside him didn’t look good either.

It was indeed very embarrassing that they had lost so much before the mission had even begun.

However, this time it had nothing to do with the leader of their demon Hunter Academy.

But they couldn’t say that it was their problem. If the other party knew about this, wouldn’t it be even more mocking.

“Sirs, please enter!”

At this moment, the old man leading the way pointed ahead and said.

The teachers of the three academies became serious. They nodded and walked inside.

After entering, they saw a large hall with seven or eight people sitting inside.

The leader wasn’t the mayor of Holy Sea Town, Jin Qianyuan. Instead, it was an old man wearing sky-blue armor. The old man had a strong back and a strong waist. He looked extremely rough.

There was a long knife mark on his arm, and his body was emitting a murderous aura.

On the chest of the old man was the symbol of the army of ocean cultivators, which represented his identity. He was the vice-captain of the Army of ocean cultivators, a half-step void interpretation expert.

Below him were the mayor, Jin Qianyuan, the President of the demon-hunting mercenary association, and several experts of the army of ocean cultivators.

“Vice commander Meng, Mayor Jin!”

A group of teachers walked in and bowed respectfully to the old man and Mayor Jin who were sitting in the middle!

“Everyone from the three academies, thank you for coming!”

Jin Qianyuan quickly stood up and thanked them.

“Sit down, the situation is urgent!”

Vice Commander Meng said indifferently. When he looked at Hai Wen, a smile appeared on his face and he nodded at him.

Hai Wen also responded with a smile.

In the hall, everyone saw this scene clearly. They looked at Hai Wen with a thoughtful expression.

“Take out the map!”

Deputy Regiment Commander Meng said to Jin Qianyuan.

“Yes!”

Jin Qianyuan waved his hand. An old man immediately waved his arm, and the map immediately floated in front.

“According to our scouts, there are five groups of demon beasts coming toward us from Xilai town. Each group of demon beasts is controlled by Demon Beasts!”

The old man pointed at the map. “Right now, the five groups of beasts are only fifty kilometers away from us. Fortunately, they have temporarily stopped here. However, if they were to head to our holy sea town, they would only need an hour.”

“The five groups of beasts are the water wolves, the bone scarabs, the scarlet fish workers, the green heron fire, and the Frog Skin Beasts. There are a total of five species of beasts, and each of them has more than a hundred thousand beasts. The strongest scarlet fish workers have a large number of terrifying existences at the seventh or eighth level of the extraordinary realm!”

As the old man spoke, he pointed at the locations of the fierce beast races, with a solemn expression, he said, “As for the strength of the demon beasts behind the five fierce beast races, it is still unknown for now. But they are definitely above the eighth level of the transcendent realm, and definitely not just one or two. If not for the arrival of the Lords, our holy sea town would not have been able to defend it at all!”

“If all the fierce beasts of these five races were to gather at holy sea town, it would be very difficult for our holy sea town to defend it, even with the help of the seven to eight hundred thousand people who escaped from West Arrival Town!”

Jin Qianyuan added, looking at vice commander Meng who was sitting in the middle.

“We need to destroy at least two of the Beast races before holy sea town can resist the invasion of the other three beast races!”

Vice commander Meng said thoughtfully, “Moreover, we must not do it before they gather. Otherwise, it will be very troublesome if they join forces!”

“Even if we can’t destroy two, we must destroy one of the races. Otherwise...” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Jin Qianyuan said with some worry.

“The water wolf fierce beasts are ranked second among the five fierce beast races, and the frog skin fierce beasts are ranked last. We can deal with these two fierce beast races!”

Vice Commander Meng stood up, his gaze swept through the surroundings. “With our strength, we are more than enough to deal with these two fierce beast races. The frog skin fierce beast race will be handed over to your holy sea town, and the water wolf will be handed over to our ocean cultivator corps and the members of the three great academies!”

“Okay, listen to vice commander Meng’s orders!”

Jin Qianyuan immediately nodded.

“Okay, let’s set off immediately. Keep in contact at all times!”

Vice Commander Meng nodded and said loudly.

“Yes!”

Everyone immediately responded loudly.

“Get ready immediately. We’ll gather at the East Gate in ten minutes!”

After saying this, vice commander Meng immediately walked out.

“Let’s go. Call all the students. The mission is starting!”

A few instructors walked towards the manor quickly.

“Everyone, set off immediately!”

After entering the manor, Wang Xian swept his gaze across everyone and said immediately.

“Yes!”

Everyone responded immediately.

“They set off so quickly. It seems like the situation is very dangerous!”

“But it shouldn’t be a big problem. With the group of powerhouses from the ocean cultivator army and the half-step void interpretation deputy captain Meng, we will definitely be able to solve this mission easily!”

“We are not the main combat force. We just need to support the ocean cultivator army!”

The group of people hurriedly followed behind and walked towards the east gate.

At this moment, they saw a dense group of people gathered at the back.

Many of their clothes were tattered and they didn’t look good either.

“They should be from Xilai Town!”

Wang Xian looked over and shook his head. The town had been destroyed and they had no home to return to.

“Everyone, stand properly!”

When they arrived at the east gate, they saw the soldiers of the ocean cultivator army standing neatly at the city gate. It was the ocean cultivator army’s riding wind battle team.

A group of soldiers stood there and gave off a strong impact.

The students from the three major academies stood aside hurriedly.

“Next, we will be facing a group of fierce beasts. The number of fierce beasts is over 100,000. Everyone, get ready and set off!”

Vice Regiment Commander Meng didn’t say anything and directly ordered.

“Yes!”

The soldiers of the riding wind battle team shouted loudly and immediately followed behind Vice Regiment Commander Meng, rushing towards the north.

“When we collide with the fierce beasts later, the people of the three great academies will follow on the left side to deal with some fish that escaped the net!”

An officer riding a wind-horned horse came to the front of them and said to everyone from the three academies.

“Don’t worry, we will organize the students well!”

The teachers from the three academies quickly echoed.

“Yes!”

The Legion nodded.

The wind-horned horse galloped, raising pieces of sand, and the five thousand cavalrymen galloped forward quickly.

The students of the three academies followed behind. Many people’s eyes revealed an excited expression.

For all the students of the three academies, this kind of charge of a few thousand people and hunting fierce beasts together was the first time.

It made the blood of a group of Youths Boil!
