2577 Hunter 2577 and his prey

“Hahaha, Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, you call us trash. Let’s see where you can escape to this time!”

In the Abyss, an extremely excited voice came from the leader of the three seas sect!

He stood on the body of the ninth-grade Heaven Sect’s patriarch and stared at Wang Xian and the rest with a ferocious expression!

This time, they had finally grasped the opportunity!

He wanted to make the Dragon Palace pay a heavy price!

“Hehe!”

When the rest of the people heard Wang Xian’s words, their eyes revealed a cold expression as well!

Their eyes swept across the group of powerhouses from the Dragon Palace one by one as murderous intent flickered in their eyes!

The 140-odd members of the Dragon Palace were all immortal godly monarchs. On their side, there were a total of 300 immortal godly monarchs, including five level six immortal godly monarchs!

Compared to the Dragon Palace, they were much stronger!

This made all of them extremely excited. This time, they were able to kill more than 100 immortal godly monarchs of the Dragon Palace!

“Hehe, I really didn’t expect you guys to find us!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and stared coldly at the ninth-grade sky sect members!

He didn’t expect to bump into them in the vast abyss!

However, this wasn’t a bad thing for the Dragon Palace!

“Haha, Dragon King, there are many things that you didn’t expect. However, I can remind you that the one who told us that we are here is the Sky Mountain Sword sect!”

The ninth-grade sky sect elder laughed out loud and said directly to him

“Oh?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows as his eyes sparkled. “Are you trying to sow discord? The Sky Mountain Sword sect doesn’t know?”

“I should be able to guess whether I’ve incited the Dragon King or Not!”

The corners of the ninth-grade celestial sect’s patriarch’s mouth curled up slightly!

The Sky Mountain Sword sect wanted to use their hands to attack and even kill the Dragon King and his people!

Although they were here to hunt down the people from the Dragon Palace, the ninth-grade celestial sect’s patriarch was more than willing to drag the Sky Mountain Sword sect down with him!

The more forces the Dragon Palace offended, the happier they would be!

“Dragon King, let’s have a fight. I want to see what you can do as the newly-risen king of leaders!”

As the ninth-grade celestial sect’s patriarch spoke, his body slowly emitted a fierce aura!

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and stared at him!

“Haha, Take This!”

The ninth-grade celestial sect’s patriarch laughed maniacally. Lightning instantly covered his body and a lightning hammer appeared in his hand!

Holding the Lightning Hammer in his hand, he slashed it directly at Wang Xian!

“Let’s see what you’re capable of!”!

Wang Xian moved his body, and the five elements millstone appeared in his hand. He easily blocked the power of the Lightning!

His body shook, and he flew directly into the sky!

“Hahaha, good, good, good. Leave this Dragon King to me. The rest is up to you guys. Kill all of them. Don’t let any of them escape!”

The ninth-grade celestial sect’s patriarch laughed out loud when he saw the Dragon King flying towards the sky!

Creating a battlefield with the Dragon Palace alone was exactly what he wanted!

In this way, the rest of them would be able to surround and kill more than a hundred immortal godly kings from the Dragon Palace!

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian looked at the ninth-grade celestial sect’s patriarch who was flying towards him. His eyes shone brightly!

His thoughts were the same as the ninth-grade celestial sect’s patriarch!

“Leave no one alive!”

Wang Xian also let out a wild roar. His arm instantly turned into a dragon claw and attacked the ninth-grade celestial sect’s patriarch

“Myriad thunderstorms!”

The ninth-grade celestial sect’s Patriarch’s eyes shot out lightning rays, as if Thunder had descended from the heavens!

“Boom!”

In an instant, the battle between Wang Xian and the ninth-grade celestial sect’s patriarch erupted!

“Kill, Kill, kill! Hahaha, kill all the experts in the Dragon Palace. Don’t let any of them escape!”

The battle above erupted, below, the three seas sect leader roared ferociously!

“Don’t let any of them escape!”

Ao Qitian and the others stared at the group of godly monarchs surrounding them, their eyes filled with killing intent as they said!

“Alright, don’t let any of them escape!”

Ao he smiled sinisterly!

Against the 5 undying level 6 warriors, among them, Ao he himself, Ao Qitian, Ao Qi, strange demon, Duan Jinming, along with the swallowing dragon, there were also 6 undying level 6 warriors!

...

However, ao Yao had the ability to instantly kill those of the same level!

Along with the swallowing dragons in his body...

“Kill!”

“Howl Howl Howl!”

Without waiting for their opponent to make a move, the Berserk Ao qi tian and Ao qi brandished their weapons and attacked the three seas sect leader and the grade 9 Sky sect elder!

At the same time, their bodies instantly transformed into a berserk battle form, two different types of berserk dragons with the same aura!

“Courting death, Attack!”

“Surround them, surround them!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

On the other side, the three hundred undyings from the five powers roared madly and attacked!

“Howl Howl Howl, surround us?”

Ao he howled madly, his eyes filled with mockery!

...

“Children, come out and fight!”

He immediately turned into a 20,000 m swallowing dragon and roared!

“Howl Howl Howl!”

The next moment, ao he seemed to have turned into a black hole, roaring from within!

“Howl Howl Howl!”

Following which, swallowing dragons flew out from his body!

One of them even had the same body size as AO he, giving off a terrifying energy!

“Howl Howl Howl!”

Over 500 undying emperor level swallowing dragons flew out, their faces filled with rage and malevolence, instantly attacking the surrounding 500 over undyings!

“Shit!”

Seeing the sudden appearance of the 500 over undyings, the expressions of all the warriors from the 5 powers changed!

“Damn it, they actually hid 500 over undyings!”

The three seas sect leader saw this scene, his expression instantly darkened as he roared angrily!

The Dragon Palace had actually been hiding over 500 undying emperors since arriving at the Abyss!

This...

Did they know that they were here?

At this moment, the Five Great Powers and the group of Undying Emperors felt as though they had fallen into a trap!

“Ah!”

Suddenly, a terrified scream sounded!

When the five major factions heard this voice, their hearts trembled violently as they hurriedly looked to the side!

On the left side, a Fey Slayer sect patriarch stared wide eyed as he raised his head, his face filled with fear as he stood in the air, trembling!

On his chest, a claw had pierced through his chest!

A black and white shadow was attached to his back, causing his life force to quickly dissipate!

“Hiss, this... this...”

When everyone saw the black and white shadow and the demon slaying sect patriarch who was about to die, an undying godking level 6 expert, their hearts turned cold!

“Ah Ah Ah!”

At the same time, screams rang out one after another!

At this moment, everyone’s expressions changed drastically as they immediately scanned their surroundings vigilantly!

“Be careful of the surroundings, there’s an ambush!”

The ninth-grade sky sect elder immediately shouted!

Their foreheads were covered in cold sweat as they looked around vigilantly!

“Surround them!”

At this moment, Duan Jinming’s voice sounded. The 700-plus godly kings of the Dragon Palace immediately surrounded the 300-plus experts!

At this moment, the position of the hunter and the prey completely changed!
