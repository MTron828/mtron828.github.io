“This immortal slaying gourd can only be used by undying level 5 and above, the weak can not withstand its power!”

“Such a treasure can be used as a powerful trump card and killing move!”

On the stage, the elder reminded!

A powerful weapon could not be controlled by the weak!

“The starting bid will start at 30,000 cubes of God Stones, the highest bidder will get it, all warriors, you can start your bids!”

The bidding for the immortal slaying gourd began!

“31,000 cubes!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

As soon as the words left his mouth, someone immediately started bidding!

“32,000 cubes!”

“33,000 cubes!”

“35,000 cubes!”

Voices came from the surrounding private rooms. Such a treasure was definitely a killing weapon for those below Peak Immortal King Realm!

As the experts started bidding, many of them looked like they were determined to get it!

“36,000 cubes!”

Wang Xian sat in the private room and narrowed his eyes slightly. He also started to bid!

Ever since he obtained the ancestral tree and learned about its effects, Wang Xian had been very interested in this plant-based treasure!

The fact that this immortal-slaying calabash could produce sword rays was indeed extraordinary!

The Calabash was a kind of plant. It was located in front of the ancestral tree. Could it evolve and improve?

If it had the destructive power of a godly king, it would be even stronger!

Since it did not improve, this immortal slaying calabash could also be used as a trump card!

“40,000 divine stones!”

After Wang Xian called out the price, a voice came from a private room in front!

“Hao Fang, not bad. Looks like you got quite a number of divine stones from the Immortal God Nation!”

“Hehe, you sure are rich!”

In a private room in front, over 10 middle aged men sat there, looking at one of the bids, they were slightly shocked!

“Haha, I’m Just Lucky, since I don’t have any life saving trump cards, I’ll definitely take this immortal slaying gourd!”

The middle aged man smiled, full of confidence!

“Hao Fang, you’re quite confident!”

An old man looked at him and asked indifferently!

“Hehe, the main thing is that this thing is useless to you protectors. Without a few protectors competing for it, I should be able to buy it!”

The middle-aged man looked at the old man and said respectfully!

“A few protectors shouldn’t compete with you!”

The old man smiled faintly!

“41,000 cubic meters!”

However, at this moment, a voice sounded. The middle-aged man raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at the box behind him!

“44,000 cubic meters!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the voice continued to sound!

“45,000 cubic meters!”

The middle-aged man frowned slightly!

“46,000 cubic meters!”

The other side immediately followed!

“48,000 cubic meters!”

The middle-aged man’s expression was somewhat solemn as he followed!

“Eh? Who’s in that private room? It looks like you’ve met your match, Hao Fang!”

A middle-aged man in the private room looked over and said with a smile!

“50,000!”

After the middle-aged man called Hao Fang shouted, the voice from the other side continued to ring!

“Any higher and it won’t Be Worth It!”

In the private room, the protector who spoke earlier said indifferently!

The middle-aged man’s expression changed slightly as he gritted his teeth, “52,000!”

“53,000!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the other party immediately followed. This caused the middle-aged man’s expression to become somewhat awkward. He shook his head slightly and looked towards the private room!

“Which elder is in that private room? Is He so rich?”

...

He frowned and said!

“No, it’s two disciples who look relatively young. Interesting!”

The old protector looked over, his eyes slightly flashing!

“Two young disciples? How can a young disciple have so many god stones?”

The middle-aged man was slightly stunned, his face full of surprise!

“The price is already too high, it’s not suitable to continue the competition!”

The old protector lightly reminded!

The middle-aged man nodded, slightly unwilling to accept it!

“I think there will be many old guys competing for the next item!”

The old guardian straightened his body slightly and mumbled!

“What a rich man!”

...

In the private room where Wang Xian and the rest were, the queen of Emperor Star saw that Wang Xian had won the bid for the immortal slaying Calabash and said with a little envy!

“The divine stones that were used to sell the vitality elixir are all gone. I’m relying on the last item to recoup my losses!”

Wang Xian smiled gently!

The last item was also the last ultimate treasure that was being auctioned today!

The ultimate life-saving treasure was the dream of all the powerhouses!

The soul-returning elixir was the second life-saving treasure!

When the auction for the soul-returning elixir started, there weren’t many bidders. There were only four old men!

As the four old men spoke, the rest of the people in the auction were watching quietly!

These were the four protectors. Each of them was a true big shot of the imperial court. They were the strongest existences below the celestial emperor!

The speed of the auction was very fast. The auction ended in less than a minute!

The final price was 93,000 cubic god stones!

When Wang Xian saw this number, his eyes revealed an excited expression!

After his upgrade this time, he could even increase the combat strength of six to seven immortal King Level 9 immortal kings in the Dragon Palace!

It was the right decision to come to the imperial court this time!

If he were to bring something like the soul returning embryo fruit over, the void God Emperor would probably come over!

Of course, Wang Xian didn’t dare to bring out such an item!

“Young master, this is the immortal slaying Calabash for you to bid for. This is the remaining resources that you sent over from the auction. I have already exchanged it for medicinal pills for you!”

After the auction ended, a staff member came to the private room and handed the treasures and resources to Wang Xian!

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and took it with a twinkle in his eyes!

He held the immortal slaying calabash that was the size of two fists and injected the wood attribute into it!

Buzz

In an instant, Wang Xian felt the green immortal slaying calabash tremble slightly!

“This is a treasure!”

A fiery glow flashed in Wang Xian’s eyes. With a move of his palm, the immortal slaying calabash vanished instantly!

At the same time, a green calabash appeared on top of the ancestral tree!

It was not located below the ancestral tree, but above it. It was on par with the eternal wood and the soul-returning wood!

What surprised Wang Xian even more was that the eternal wood and the branches of the Nirvana lightning tree were gently twining around it!

A stream of Sword Qi came out from the immortal-slaying calabash and swirled around the calabash!

“Let’s Go!”

Just as Wang Xian was still sensing the magical powers of the immortal-slaying calabash, Di Xingnu’s voice rang out beside him!

“Alright!”

The corners of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly. He snapped out of his daze and followed her out of the room!

When he walked out of the private room, he noticed a few pairs of eyes looking in their direction!

Wang Xian took a glance and didn’t pay too much attention to it. Instead, he walked straight out!

“Hey Haofang, there are indeed two young men in that private room. Are they disciples of our imperial court? That woman looks familiar!”

A few middle-aged men walked out from the private room in front. One of them raised his eyebrows and asked in surprise!

“She’s my niece. As for the young man next to her, let’s get to know him!”

As the middle-aged man spoke, his body moved and he immediately flew up into the sky!

“HMM?”

In an instant, a figure suddenly appeared in front of Wang Xian, Emperor Star Lady and the rest!

Emperor Star Lady looked at the middle-aged man who appeared and revealed a look of surprise!
