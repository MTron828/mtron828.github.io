Chapter 1076: 1077 Zhang Yushu’s crisis

Translator: 5496903

“Continue, continue!”

“With Commander Wang around, it won’t be long before we can clear out the entire seamount region. It can also be considered to be a hidden threat to our holy sea town!”

“This time, we have to thank Commander Wang. Speaking of the last time when the monsters attacked the city, commander Wang also massacred everywhere. The Immortal Phoenix mercenary group became even more famous after one battle!”

“Commander Wang and his subordinates seem to have become even stronger.”

Over a hundred squads continued to advance forward. Some of the experts from the holy sea town were chatting in low voices.

The students from the three major academies were also discussing among themselves. Not long ago, Wang Xian had managed to destroy the Direwolf and the commander this time. It could be said that Wang Xian was in the limelight.

It was not an exaggeration to call him the number one person in the three major academies.

His unparalleled strength, terrifying insight, and powerful commanding ability made the genius students from the three major academies pale in comparison.

“Suppressing all the prodigies from the three major academies? HMPH!”

Hai Wen heard the conversation of the people around him and his face turned gloomy. He snorted coldly.

As a genius with a powerful background, he was now being suppressed by someone of the same age. This filled him with jealousy.

Moreover, this fellow had embarrassed him time and time again. This made him, who had always been proud, extremely angry.

“A fellow with a bloodline. When he cultivates to the peak of the bloodline, I’ll see how arrogant you are. Just wait and see!”

Hai Wen comforted himself in his heart. As he looked at the few teams under his control, his mood slightly improved.

However, when he thought of that fellow commanding all of them, he felt uncomfortable again.

They kept pushing forward. After passing by the group of eight-clawed ferocious beasts that they had just encountered, there were no ferocious beasts that had gathered together.

The push was still going on. More than two thousand people were searching the mountain peaks and killing the eight-clawed ferocious beasts one by one.

“Young master hai, young master hai, there are treasures, treasures!”

In front of a mountain peak at the bottom of the sea, an excited voice shouted at Hai Wen.

“What treasure?”

Hai Wen impatiently looked at the young man in front of him.

In the Ocean Academy, the most famous name was Hai Wen’s name.

Most of the students in the academy called him young master Hai.

“Green vine fruit, it’s green vine fruit, young master Hai!”

The young man pointed to the sky, lowered his voice and shouted excitedly.

“What? Green Vine Fruit?”

Hai Wen’s body trembled, and his face revealed an excited expression as he flew over.

“Young master hai, there are a few eight-clawed fierce beasts guarding it. There’s a hole there, and a powerful aura is coming from it. I suspect that there might be a transcendent rank 6 eight-eyed Eel Demon Beast Inside!”

The young man pointed at a spot about five hundred meters above and said to him. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“All treasures have powerful beasts guarding them!”

Hai Wen stared at the green vine fruit, his eyes slowly burning, “However, even if there are transcendent rank 6 beasts, with our strength, we don’t have to be afraid!”

His eyes flickered as he looked at the three transcendent rank 5 beasts surrounding the green vine fruit, then looked at the cave entrance.

“Zhang Yushu, your squad, come over here!”

Hai Wen narrowed his eyes as he looked at Zhang Yushu and his men.

Zhang Yushu had the strength of a transcendent rank 5 and led a squad. The people who followed him were all on good terms with him.

The two young men who went to the auction together with him were also beside him.

“Why did that Guy Hai Wen call us over!”

One of the young men saw Hai Wen calling them over and asked Zhang Yushu with a sullen face.

“I don’t know. He’s our company leader. Let’s go over and take a look!”

Zhang Yushu hesitated for a moment. He looked at his team members and walked towards Hai Wen.

“You two teams, come with me and kill those three fierce beasts!”

Hai Wen saw them walking over and pointed at the three eight-clawed fierce beasts that were attached to the mountain peak.

“Oh? That is? Green vine fruit!”

Zhang Yushu looked up and saw the fruit beside the three ferocious beasts. He was stunned.

“That’s right, green vine fruit. Go and tie down those three ferocious beasts!”

Hai Wen smiled and the corners of his mouth curled up.

“There is a hole beside the green vine fruit. There might be a demon beast, eight-eyed eel, in it. Let’s just...”.

“Shut up. Even if there is one, it’s at transcendent level six. With my strength, it’s enough to deal with it!”

Zhang Yushu looked up and frowned as he spoke. Before he could finish, he was interrupted by Hai Wen.

He stared coldly at Zhang Yushu. “Obey the order, go up...”

“But, the commander-in-chief has said that if you encounter a Demon Beast, you must immediately report it!”

Zhang Yushu’s expression was somewhat unsightly as he spoke.

“Which eye of yours saw a demonic beast? Zhang Yushu, you will enter the ocean cultivator corps in the future. The most important thing in the corps is to obey orders. You are disobeying orders, and you still want to enter the ocean cultivator corps?”

Hai Wen stared at Zhang Yushu with a cold expression.

Zhang Yushu and the others’expressions changed slightly. Now that they were on a mission, they wouldn’t be worried at all if someone else used this matter as an excuse.

However, if Hai Wen said these words, if he intentionally used this matter to cause some trouble to the ocean cultivator corps, it would definitely be a fatal blow to their future.

The most ideal way for the students of Shanghai Ocean Academy was to enter the ocean cultivator corps.

“Alright, but if there are demonic beasts inside, we will immediately report it!”

Zhang Yushu and the others looked at each other and said with a dark expression.

“Just do your own thing!”

Hai Wen said to them with a mocking expression.

He liked the feeling of controlling others the most.

“Let’s go. There are three transcendent level 5 beasts. We need two teams to work together!”

Zhang Yushu looked at the team leader beside Hai Wen and said in a deep voice.

“Alright!”

The young man who had just started reporting nodded. The group of twenty moved and immediately flew towards the location of the green vine fruit.

“Be careful. There might be even more powerful demonic beasts in that cave!”

Zhang Yushu reminded in a low voice as he looked at Hai Wen who was following beside him.

The surrounding people nodded.

Hai Wen licked his tongue as he held a defensive spirit tool in his hand. He stared at the green vine fruit with a burning gaze.

“Attack!”

When they were a hundred meters away, three eight-clawed ferocious beasts with a huge head had already discovered them.

Zhang Yushu gave a light shout as the weapon in his hand emitted a green light as he directly attacked a transcendent rank 5 ferocious beast.

Hai Wen and the rest of the group also unleashed their attacks.

The terrifying blade light and attribute attacks covered the bodies of the 38-clawed beasts.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

When the attacks landed on the mountain peak, a muffled sound rang out.

“Hiss!”

One of the 8-clawed beasts had four of its claws sliced off, as it let out a terrifying sound.

“Whoosh!”

However, right at this moment, eight terrifying white eyes suddenly popped out from the black hole beside the green vine fruit, and they stared coldly at them.
