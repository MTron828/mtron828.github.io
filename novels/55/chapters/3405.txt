3406 3405 killed the eldest senior brother of the Thunder Ray race

“Teleport!”

After flying for two months, Wang Xian arrived at a city teleportation formation and teleported immediately.

The next moment, he arrived at a city in the Thunder Cloud Domain.

Clay city was the name of this city. The city lord of Clay City was also one of the famous experts in the Thunder Cloud Domain.

He had the combat strength of a peak universe knight and had a large number of subordinates under him. He could be ranked among the top ten cities in the Thunder Cloud Domain.

“Teleport to the Lightning race!”

Without any hesitation, Wang Xian flew to another teleportation formation and spoke to the staff at the side.

“HMM?”

“You want to teleport to the Lightning Race?”

The staff was stunned for a moment. Then, he took two steps back and asked Wang Xian with a twinkle in his eyes.

“Yes, time is of the Essence!”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes slightly and nodded his head in response.

It had been a few days since the war between the Thunder Ray race and Wang Xian needed to rush over immediately.

“Who are you from the Thunder Ray Race?”

The staff member looked at Wang Xian and moved his palm. A red ball appeared and he asked Wang Xian.

“Your Clay City is also involved in this?”

Wang Xian looked at the staff member and swept his gaze across the surroundings. He asked faintly.

The surroundings of the teleportation formation were a little deserted. The atmosphere was a little tense. It was obvious that something special had happened.

In addition to the information that he had received, he had a guess in his heart.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

At this moment, figures flew over quickly.

There were more than a hundred people. The one in the lead was a young man and an old man.

“Eh? This Is?”

“The eldest senior brother of the Lightning Race?”

The eyes of the young man in the lead sparkled. He couldn’t help but lick his lips!

“Oh? It’s really him?”

The old man at the side locked his gaze on Wang Xian. A smile appeared on his face.

“It’s actually the eldest senior brother of the Thunder Ray race, the young city lord. He is a purebred divine dragon!”

“Purebred divine dragon, the bloodline of the peak of the universe. Furthermore, he is a thunder dragon. Young city lord, if we can get him to…”

The eyes of the powerful disciples of Clare City behind him instantly turned heated.

“Activate the formation!”

The young city Lord’s eyes revealed an excited look as he roared in a low voice!

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

As soon as he finished his sentence, a formation enveloped the surroundings and enveloped everyone in an instant.

This formation was able to prevent people from escaping back to their divine kingdom in an instant.

Wang Xian was slightly taken aback when he saw this scene. Soon after, he smiled.

“Looks like your Clare City is in cahoots with the Great Thunderclap Academy!”

Wang Xian said faintly.

“Hahaha, it’s Your Thunder race who is courting death. You guys are occupying such a good place and don’t know how to share some with us. You have to pay the price if you want to keep it all to yourself. This time, your thunder race will pay an extremely tragic price!”

The young castellan of Clare City laughed out loud when he heard Wang Xian’s words.

“Haha, a Purebred Thunder Dragon. The entire body of a divine dragon is a treasure Trove.”

As he continued to speak, his eyes were blazing with killing intent.

The entire body of a purebred divine dragon was a treasure trove, especially since the opponent was a lightning dragon. After killing him, he might be able to obtain some things that would allow him to improve tremendously.

“Oh? With just you guys? You still want to kill me?”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the few hundred of them. His eyes revealed a cold expression.

“Eldest senior brother of the Thunder Ray race, you are indeed very strong. However, your life is doomed today!”

A mocking look appeared in the eyes of the old man beside the young castellan of Clare City.

As he spoke, he slowly opened up a space to the side.

Boom! Boom! Boom

“Hahaha, I really didn’t expect that just as we were about to send out our troops, eldest senior brother of the Thunder Ray race actually came to seek his own death. In that case, we can only accept his life with a Smile!”

All of a sudden, a loud laughter was heard. A figure slowly appeared beside the old man.

The figure held Torretta in his hand as he sat on a thunder throne. His entire person was incomparably tall and mighty.

A majestic aura surged out from his body.

The moment he appeared, a large number of figures appeared around the formation that enveloped Wang Xian and the rest.

They were arranged into an army formation, and their bodies were filled with killing intent.

The million-strong army stared at them coldly.

The leading group of experts from Clare City had a mocking expression on their faces.

They did not expect that just as they were about to follow the city lord out, the eldest senior brother of the Thunder Ray tribe would actually walk right into the trap.

In Clare City, many people had seen the eldest senior brother of the Thunder Ray tribe. They were also very impressed by his strength.

However, what made them even more interested was the dragon body of a purebred divine dragon.

The corpse of a peak race was priceless.

“Greetings, City Lord!”

“Father!”

When the young city lord of Clare City saw the figure on the throne, he smiled and bowed.

“Hehe!”

The city lord of Clare City smiled. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly as his gaze landed on Wang Xian.

“You have endless potential. It’s a pity that you made a mistake by joining the Lightning Race!”

He said faintly.

“Hehe, aren’t you people from Clare City Afraid of the Lightning race taking revenge in the future?”

Upon hearing his words, Wang Xian also smiled faintly and asked.

“Let’s talk about it after the lightning race can get through this difficulty.”

The castellan of Clare City said calmly as he slowly lifted the Thunder Pagoda in his hand. “All Heaven’s favorites are weaklings before they grow up. You Won’t lose out if you die in my hands!”

Buzz

As he spoke, the Thunder Tower in his hand slowly rose and emitted a terrifying aura.

“Hehe, what a pity. The eldest senior brother of the Lightning race was only killed by my father in one strike!”

The young castellan of Clare City watched this scene with a smile on his face.

“Very good. I declare the destruction of your Clare City!”

Killing intent slowly appeared in Wang Xian’s eyes. The five elements millstone slowly appeared in his hand.

“Arrogant, in My Clare City, you can’t even escape!”

The castellan of Clare City said coldly. With a wave of his arm, the Thunder Tower headed straight for Wang Xian to suppress him.

He had seen Wang Xian make a move before, and he also knew Wang Xian’s strength.

At most, he could fight a level nine universe knight.

Such an expert could be killed with a single strike when he was trapped!

“Haha!”

Wang Xian saw that the Lightning Pagoda was attacking him. He laughed out loud and waved the five elements grinding mill in his hand. Then, he attacked the Lightning Pagoda directly.

“Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!”

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

At the same time, an incomparably huge figure slowly appeared beneath him.

The purple lightning snake’s ferocious body was displayed in front of everyone.

The innate numinous treasure level lightning horn was shining behind Wang Xian.

Wang Xian stood on top of the Purple Lightning Snake’s head with a cold smile on his face.

“Kill them all! Leave No one alive!”

He ordered coldly.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The purple lightning snake roared. Without any hesitation, it charged forward.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m
