Chapter 938: 0939, this is our territory

Translator: 549690339

The old man looked at the flaming flowers one by one and his expression turned ugly.

If these flaming flowers didn’t die, the Bridgeforest Business Association would definitely be able to make a huge profit.

“If some of them die, so be it. There should still be some profit!”

The middle-aged man said with some heartache.

“Everyone, can we settle the Commission for our mercenary group First?”

Wang Xian watched as they conversed. No one came to talk about the commission with them. He walked straight to the four middle-aged men and asked directly.

“Commission?”

The four middle-aged men didn’t look too good when they saw the death of the blazing flame flower.

The death of the blazing flame flower meant that all their rewards were gone.

Seeing Wang Xian coming over to ask for the commission, the middle-aged man walked toward the young man with a sullen face.

“Young master, the members of the mercenary group are asking for the Commission!”

“Commission?”

The young man, who was already extremely embarrassed, looked even worse. “Just bring them to the mercenary group to claim their commission!”

“The mercenary group only has a commission of six million middle-grade spirit stones. They are still one million short!”

Wang Xian walked over with a smile on his face and said to the young man.

“HMM? A commission of 7,000,000 middle-grade Spirit Stones?”

The middle-aged man beside him frowned and asked.

“That’s right. The commission of 6,000,000 middle-grade spirit stones was raised to 7,000,000 after crossing the Bridge Forest Beast Park. They understand very well!”

Wang Xian nodded and said.

“We understand, but what did your hiring association do along the way?”

The young man gritted his teeth and said coldly to Wang Xian, “Along the way, you guys didn’t even keep a lookout. If it wasn’t for our good luck, how could we have crossed the Bridge Forest Beast Park?”

“That’s right. Your mission this time is no different from picking up money. You guys didn’t encounter any ferocious beasts along the way and got six million middle-grade spirit stones for nothing. Be Content!”

When the middle-aged man heard the young man’s words, he immediately said coldly.

“I’m really envious of you guys. We worked our asses off and didn’t get anything, yet you guys picked up six million middle-grade spirit stones for nothing!”

The other middle-aged man also said with some ridicule.

“What’s going on?”

The middle-aged man saw his son and the other two employees’words and asked the young man.

The young man immediately told the middle-aged man the details of the mission.

The middle-aged man raised his eyebrows and looked at Wang Xian who was beside him. “Young man, don’t be too greedy if you haven’t done anything. Go and get the Six Million Commission from the Hiring Association!”

“Does this mean that you don’t intend to pay the remaining one million commission?”

When Wang Xian heard their words, his eyes turned cold immediately. A faint chill gushed out from his body.

“There was no one who paid the one million commission in the first place. Why wouldn’t I Pay It?”

The corner of the middle-aged man’s mouth curled up slightly. He felt the aura from Wang Xian and said with some sarcasm.

“The money from our Celestial Phoenix mercenary group is not something to be greedy for. I’m warning you guys, don’t do anything stupid!”

Wang Xian’s gaze turned cold and a hint of killing intent flashed in his eyes. “Since we have completed the mission, all of you should give us the promised reward!”

This mission seemed to be very easy, but this was because of Ao Yao and the rest.

One had to know that they had encountered a ferocious beast of supernatural seventh level this time.

If it were any other golden mercenary group, they might have failed this mission. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

However, the probability of all of them dying was very high.

Now, they actually dared to take the 1,000,000 middle-grade spirit stones. This was not something that Wang Xian could tolerate.

Although they did not know the dangers along the way, this was not the reason why they did not give them a commission.

“What’s the matter, Kid? You’re not satisfied with the 6,000,000 commission? Do you want more?”

The middle-aged man stared at Wang Xian with a very strong gaze.

“Then, your bridgeforest business association is going to make an enemy out of us, the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group. One million middle-grade spirit stones is not worth offending a gold mercenary group!”

Wang Xian said coldly.

“Haha, Kid, are you threatening us?”

The middle-aged man suddenly burst into laughter. He stared at Wang Xian with a cold expression and a hint of coldness flashed in his eyes. “Kid, why don’t you take a look at whose territory this is? How dare you threaten our BRIDGEFOREST Business Association?”

“This is the territory of our Bridgewood Chamber of Commerce. The Six Million Commission is already a compliment to all of you. We shouldn’t have given a single cent to a trashy mercenary group like you. Damn it, we didn’t do anything and took six million for nothing!”

The young man said with disdain. If he hadn’t given the six million to the mercenary group, he wouldn’t have wanted to give it to them.

“Alright, Alright!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly. “Let’s wait and see then. I will make all of you regret this one million!”

“Kid, I’m warning you. Don’t spout nonsense. The Golden Hiring Association is very powerful, but we, the Bridgewood Business Association, don’t take them seriously!”

The old man beside him said coldly.

“President Lin, what’s going on?”

At this moment, a mercenary group walked in from the entrance. More than 20 people were covered in blood, and they were filled with a strong murderous aura and confidence.

“It’s nothing. A mercenary group from Shenghai town is greedy for more revenge!”

The middle-aged man said to the old man who walked in with a faint smile on his face.

“The mercenary group from Shenghai town dares to look for trouble with us? Are they courting death?”

The old man walked over with great strides. He stood in front of Wang Xian and the rest and stared at him with a domineering gaze.

“The golden mercenary group seems to be quite strong. However, you guys are still not at the stage where you can act impudently here. Be careful, you won’t be able to leave Qiaolin Town!”

Wang Xian looked at the domineering old man and swept his gaze across the people from the QIAOLIN Business Association. A hint of coldness appeared in his eyes.

Suddenly, Wang Xian revealed a faint smile on his face. “I don’t know if you know about the dragon thorns. The Dragon Thorns have arrived at your bridgeforest town!”

“What Dragon Thorns and dog thorns? Kid, if you still dare to cause trouble here, I will make you regret it!”

President Lin of the BRIDGEFOREST Business Association said coldly.

“Hehe, it doesn’t matter if you don’t know about it. You will know about it tonight!”

Wang Xian smiled as he turned around and walked towards the center of the town.

“Hmph, those guys don’t know what’s good for them. They got six million for nothing!”

The young man looked at the figures of Wang Xian and the rest with an embarrassed expression.

“Alright, let’s go back. There’s nothing to be afraid of for a mercenary group from Shenghai Town. They should know what to do after they know our strength!”

The middle-aged man patted the young man’s shoulder and said nonchalantly.

The Bridge Forest Business Association was the largest business association in Bridge Forest Town. It was the most powerful business association in the entire town.

The mayor of Bridge Forest Town was an expert at transcendent-level rank-8. His strength was on par with the founder of the Bridge Forest Business Association.

Moreover, the mayor of bridge forest town had a very good relationship with the bridge forest business association.

With such a background, the bridge forest business association did not fear anyone in bridge forest town.

“The good and evil value has reached negative 300. It seems that they have killed many people!”

“Your territory? Hehe, Tonight, darkness has arrived!”
