“I’ve leveled up, and I’ve leveled up two levels in a row. I’ve comprehended three supernatural powers!”

At the residence next to the Demon Hunters Academy, Wang Xian revealed a smile.

His strength had increased by two levels, reaching transcendent level 7. When he transformed into a divine dragon, he could fight against experts who were half a step beyond the void interpretation realm.

It could be said that the current Wang Xian was invincible below the void interpretation realm.

“The next upgrade will require 10 million dragon crystals, which is equivalent to more than 100 billion middle-grade spirit stones. It will be much more difficult!”

“I still have more than two million dragon crystals. I will use them to upgrade the strange demon and the rest first!”

A smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face.

Ao Yao and his strength had reached level seven of the supernatural realm. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The group of Golden Swordfish was only at level six of the supernatural realm.

The group of strange demons were even weaker.

With over two million dragon crystals now, it was sufficient for them to reach the peak.

“Ao Jian, Ao Yao, call all your subordinates over!”

Wang Xian shouted softly and the 32 subordinates who followed him over all came into the room.

Ao Yao’s strength had already reached the peak. Wang Xian did not continue to increase it. Instead, he increased the group of Strange Demons’strength.

The amount of dragon qi consumed by the group of strange demons could not be compared to Wang Xian’s.

The increase of one level by Wang Xian was enough for more than ten strange demons to increase their strength once.

Boom! Boom! Boom

For a moment, the strength of the group of strange demons in the room was increasing at a terrifying speed.

Transcendence level 6, transcendence level 7.

When more than one million dragon Qi was consumed, the group of strange demons’strength had already increased to transcendence level 7.

Level seven of the supernatural realm can assassinate level nine of the supernatural realm. There are still more than 900,000 Dragon Energy left

Wang Xian thought to himself as he raised the strength of the Golden Swordfish once again.

By raising the group of Golden Swordfish to level seven of the supernatural realm, they would have the combat strength of level eight of the supernatural realm.

“There are still about 200,000 Dragon Energy left!”

Wang Xian looked at the last bit of Dragon Energy left and smiled.

“Do you want to buy some weapons?”

Wang Xian looked at the remaining 200,000 dragon energy he had for a long time and hesitated.

Now, there was a shopping mall in the system. It was filled with treasures collected by the Divine Dragons in the past.

He could exchange for them with Dragon Energy.

However, after thinking about it, he dismissed the idea.

His strength had improved too quickly. Even the dragon balls he cultivated could not keep up with the speed of improvement.

“Feng Luan still has more than 20 billion middle-grade spirit stones, which is equivalent to more than two million dragon crystals. When the time comes, I will use them to increase the strength of the other members of the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian pondered in his heart. What he needed to do next was to move the dragon palace to the transcendence continent.

Crack! Crack! Crack

The next morning, when Wang Xian woke up, a crisp sound was emitted from his body. A powerful force filled his entire body.

A smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face. The current him, even in his human form, could still match the strength of an extraordinary level nine.

After breakfast, he sent a message to Zhang Fengying and went to the restaurant he went to the last time to wait for her.

What made Wang Xian speechless was that Zhang Fengying only arrived after waiting for two hours.

She still had that perfect figure. However, her hair was disheveled today and she looked very feminine.

“Sorry, I’m Late!”

Zhang Fengying sat down and said with a smile.

“You must be doing this on purpose!”

Wang Xian pursed his lips. She must be taking revenge for being late in the past.

“Hehe, why? You’re only allowed to be late. I’m not allowed to be late!”

Zhang Fengying rolled her eyes at him and sat directly opposite him.

“Okay, okay. Come, Pretty Lady, let’s have dinner!”

Wang Xian smiled and said immediately.

“If you are trying to please me for no reason, you must be up to no good. Tell me, what do you need help with?”

Zhang Fengying asked him directly.

“Hehe, there is indeed something that I need your help with!”

As Wang Xian spoke, a smile appeared on his face.

Indeed, he had something very important that he needed Zhang Fengying’s help with.

Zhang Fengying’s family was an aristocratic family of mercenary groups. She was undoubtedly the one who knew the area around Donghai City the best.

Wang Xian needed her help to find the most ideal place to house the Dragon Palace.

When the Dragon Palace moved to the transcendence continent, they had to find a perfect location. Only then would it be beneficial for the future development of the Dragon Palace.

As an aristocratic family of mercenary groups that were more familiar with the vicinity of Donghai City, they knew more than ten times more information than Wang Xian.

“A secret undersea that few people go to?”

Zhang Fengying pondered for a moment. “The east of Donghai city is filled with the ocean. No one knows how far it is. If we are talking about the secret seabed, there are a few places with a harsh environment. There aren’t many resources there, so basically, no one will go there!”

A thoughtful look appeared on her face. “I’m not sure about the details either. Let me check some information to confirm it before I tell you!”

“Alright, thank you very much!”

Wang Xian nodded immediately.

He didn’t have any friends in the transcendence continent. The only person who could help him was Zhang Fengying.

“This guy didn’t know that he was here to send someone off. So he’s with a beauty!”

After chatting with Zhang Fengying for more than an hour, Wang Xian and Zhang Fengying were walking on the street.

Not far away from them, a dissatisfied gaze looked over and snorted.

“Let’s Go!”

She said to the old woman beside her.

The old woman glanced over and nodded. The group of people instantly disappeared.

“Something has happened. Something big has happened. I heard that the west arrival town below has been broken through by demonic beasts. Hundreds of thousands of people have died!”

“I also heard that a group of demonic beasts has broken through the west arrival town and is now attacking holy sea town. This morning, more than a thousand people rushed over from the West Arrival Town!”

“Xilai town has been directly broken through. Can Shenghai town withstand it? If not, all the refugees will rush into Donghai City!”

Just as the two of them were conversing on the street, sounds of conversation suddenly came from the front. A few of them looked at the dozens of martial artists with injuries on their bodies and said.

Wang Xian looked over and revealed a surprised expression.

A group of dozens of people with injuries all over their bodies were in an extremely sorry state. It was obvious that they were not the mercenaries or residents of Donghai city.

Xilai town had been breached?

Was Shenghai town in danger?
