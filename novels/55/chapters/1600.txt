Chapter 1601: 1601 domineering and Crazy 5

“Yes!”

After the supreme chief had judged he suiqing, an elder from the solipsistic sect cupped his hands and accepted the order.

His gaze swept over he suiqing and he yuan without any emotion on his face.

“I wonder if there will be anyone who will stop us!”

A cold smile appeared on the Elder’s face. He glanced at Wang Xian with disdain and walked straight ahead.

He suiqing looked at the enforcers of the supreme sect who were walking towards him. His face was pale as he held he Yuan’s arm tightly.

“Supreme sect leader, aren’t you guys too overbearing!”

He Yuan stared at the supreme sect leader and shouted with an extremely embarrassed expression.

“You don’t have the right to speak to our sect leader. Go To Hell. I want to see who else dares to stop you!”

A cold expression appeared on the elder’s face. With a wave of his arm, a powerful energy directly attacked he yuan and he suiqing.

He Yuan’s body trembled. Everyone from the He clan and he suiqing closed their eyes and lowered their heads.

“Too overbearing!”

“Hmph, blame the sky demon for killing so many disciples of the sect. After all, many core disciples of the sect have been killed in the ruins of the divine kingdom. There are at least tens of thousands of them!”

“Now, the revenge of the lone sect is only the beginning!”

The surrounding factions whispered when they saw the powerful lone sect.

“Keke, I’ll give it a try too!”

At that moment, a sinister and terrifying voice sounded.

“Explode!”

“Boom!”

The sound of an explosion sounded once again. Just like the last time, blood splattered everywhere.

At this moment, all the surrounding factions were stunned. The supreme sect leader’s cold aura that looked down on the world was completely frozen as well.

“The only sect is only so-so!”

“Could it be that villains die because they talk too much? Keke!”

A mocking voice rang out, causing the expressions of all the surrounding factions to become exceptionally interesting. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

It was the second time!

The first time, the sky demon attacked and killed a deacon of the only sect.

Now, the hunchbacked old man who had followed the Sky Demon had also killed one of the Deacons of the lone sect.

Blood splattered everywhere.

For the first time, it was understandable if the supreme headmaster was too arrogant and did not react.

But this time?

Two consecutive times, it was a slap to the face!

Even the experts of some forces twitched their mouths.

“He is indeed peerless. One Sky Demon is at the peak of the eighth rank of the profound void martial stage, and the other one is not weak either!”

“It seems that I have to make a move today!”

The Supreme Headmaster’s eyes jumped, and his face darkened.

“Headmaster, leave it to our Supreme Guardian Group!”

At this time, seven elders slowly walked out from below and asked the supreme headmaster for instructions!

“Lord Supreme Headmaster, please let me chop off the head of the Sky Demon with my own hands and pay tribute to the millions of heroic spirits of our Bingxin Dynasty!”

Bing FA Wu jumped down and bowed respectfully to the supreme headmaster.

“Our sect must be serious!”

“The Supreme Guardian group is made up of seven experts at the eighth rank of the profound void tier. Each guardian group is very powerful. Under normal circumstances, they will not act unless the sect is in danger. The heavenly demon is already very powerful to force the Supreme Guardian Group to Act!”

“This is the end of the matter!”

Some people took a deep breath when they saw the seven experts at the eighth rank of the Profound Void Tier and Bing FA Wu of the Bingxin Empire walk out in an instant.

The foundations of the three super forces were too strong.

It was already very powerful for a first-rate force to have two experts at the eighth rank of the profound void tier. However, our sect could easily have seven or eight.

This was also the reason why the He clan and the He Sui clan did not dare to resist.

“Supreme sect leader, our nine Lotus sect is willing to help the lone sect!”

An old man’s voice suddenly came from behind.

The old man had an arm that was about two meters long. His face was full of muscles, and his entire body was filled with a murderous aura.

“Supreme sect leader, our dust sect is willing to kill enemies for the lone sect!”

Just as the long-armed elder of the nine Lotus sect finished speaking, another sect’s patriarch stepped forward and respectfully requested for instructions.

“Hiss, the nine Lotus sect and the dust sect, two first-rate forces have also stepped forward!”

“This is clearly an opportunity to gain the favor of our sect by stepping out and doing odd jobs. Why Not? Unfortunately, we are only a second-rate force and don’t even have the qualifications to do odd jobs!”

The eyes of all the surrounding forces flickered.

This was an opportunity to curry favor with the cult of Solitaire. However, they were not qualified to do so.

“Let’s settle this as soon as possible!”

The supreme sect leader, who had wanted to establish his authority, was also a little angry after the two deacons were killed. He gave the order directly.

“It’s the supreme sect leader!”

The group of ten Seethrough Void Tier 8 powerhouses cupped their hands. Instantly, their bodies emitted a terrifying pressure.

They turned their heads and looked at Wang Xian and Mo Sha.

10 against 2. Among those of the same level, no matter how powerful they were, they would be able to kill them.

In the surroundings, everyone could not help but take a few steps back.

Their eyes were fixed on the death of the first-generation Sky Demon.

“His head, I hope everyone can let me, Bing FA Wu, cut it off!”

Bing FA Wu stared at Wang Xian with hatred and growled.

“Haha, sure, sure. In a while, we will create an opportunity for brother Bing Fa Wu!”

The two patriarchs of the nine Lotus sect and dust sect said with smiles on their faces.

Ten people at the eighth level of the Seethrough void tier killed two of them. They did not dare to guarantee that they would be able to kill them in one move. However, they could still take them down within ten moves under the siege.

“Sister Jian ‘er, watch carefully!”

Ao Tian looked at Ling Jian ‘er and said indifferently.

Ling Jian ‘ER’s eyes turned red. She closed them slowly and a tear fell.

“Haha, Die, Die, die!”

Bing Jing Huan roared with a ferocious face.

He wanted to see his ancestor behead the Sky Demon and avenge his father and all his family.

“Do it!”

The Supreme Protector Group and Bing Fa Wu of the only sect, who were at rank eight of the profound void martial stage, let out a light shout as resplendent weapons appeared in their hands.

“Hehehe, it’s about to start!”

“That’s what makes it interesting. I hate trash the most, so let’s clean up the two trash first!”

Mo Sha laughed maniacally when he saw the ten profound void martial stage experts facing them.

Strands of demonic qi slowly rose, and his turbid eyes began to turn pure black.

“Boom!”

Demonic Qi erupted, and the black clouds in the sky instantly churned. An invincible aura rushed out in all directions.

“Trash, Go to hell!”

Mo Sha waved his arms to the two sides. Strands of demonic qi were like ferocious and terrifying demonic dragons, directly crushing towards the nine Lotus sect and the dust gate.

“What!”

A Cry of surprise came from the supreme headmaster and Nangong Jianghe.

Their pupils constricted slightly.

Wang Xian, who was trapped in the wind prison, slowly extended his arms. When his hands touched the wind prison, it dissipated immediately.

The five elements crown on his head was sparkling.
