Chapter 967: 968, don’t be pretentious if you don’t have the strength

Translator: 549690339

Move aside. Move aside for you bunch of trash?

He actually said such words to the five people from the young master’s mercenary group.

Not to mention that the five of them were the famous young master’s mercenary group in the demon hunters mercenary group, even if they weren’t, they were still senior students of the Demon Hunters Academy.

You, a freshman, dared to say such words to a senior student. You are clearly courting death!

Wang Xian’s words stunned all the freshmen around him. All of them stared at him in astonishment.

However, his words caused the faces of the five young men from the young master’s mercenary group to darken instantly.

Their faces were almost bleeding.

Calling them trash?

Furthermore, it was a freshman in front of all the freshmen. This was simply too embarrassing.

If some people in the demon Hunters Academy knew about this, wouldn’t they mock them to death?

To be called trash by a freshman who had yet to enter the Academy!

The young man with Golden Hoop was also looking at Wang Xian in astonishment. A mocking expression slowly appeared on his face.

“Hehe, very good. No one in the demon hunters academy dares to speak to us like this, especially the freshmen. You are the first one!”

A hint of viciousness flashed across the eyes of the young man in the middle of the five of them. He held the fan in his right hand and said, “Let me help you get out of the way!”

The fan in his right hand flashed with a green light as it smacked towards Wang Xian’s body.

“Trash!”

Wang Xian saw their arrogant looks and a hint of mockery appeared in his eyes. He moved his arm.

In Wang Xian’s opinion, a young man who was at transcendent level three could be easily crushed to death.

He moved his right hand and did not release any attributes. He merely relied on his powerful strength to land heavily on the fan.

“Boom!”

“Crash!”

A terrifying force landed. The powerful force caused the fan in the young man’s hand to collapse.

“Bang!”

The powerful force landed on the young man’s body, causing his expression to change drastically. He flew backward and landed heavily on the ground.

“What?”

Everyone’s expression changed slightly as they looked at the young man who was lying on the ground in disbelief.

This was a senior. However, a member of the young master’s mercenary group was actually knocked down by a freshman.

“With such strength, you still want to show off? What a joke!”

Wang Xian looked at the young man who was lying on the ground in disdain.

“You... you...”

In an instant, the expressions of the five of them changed drastically.

It was true that they were not strong. They were at level three extraordinary, but they were not too weak either.

However, they did not expect to be knocked down by a young man.

This was a huge humiliation.

They were mocked by a freshman and now they were defeated. This made them lose all their face in front of the freshmen.

“This... that student’s strength is so strong!”

“This student’s strength should be considered top-notch here, but the strength of the five of them seems to be a little weak!”

“This young master’s mercenary group is at least one of the top ten mercenary groups in our academy. How could their strength be...”

When the surrounding freshmen saw this scene, their eyes widened and their faces were filled with shock as they discussed.

Hearing the discussions of the surrounding freshmen, the expressions of the five members of the young master’s mercenary group became even more unsightly.

Their strength was already considered relatively weak within the mercenary group. However, being defeated by a freshman was still extremely humiliating.

“This... a freshman actually defeated Liang Chuan of the young master’s mercenary group!”

“His strength isn’t bad, but that freshman is in Big Trouble!”

“It’s not just trouble. I reckon he will drop out of school soon, or else he will be played to death. His actions this time have embarrassed the entire young master’s mercenary group!”

“That Kid’s strength is not bad, but he is showing off a little. Provoking young master’s mercenary group is simply courting death!”

In a corner of the square in front of the Demon Hunters Academy, forty to fifty people stood there.

They were members of some mercenary groups in the Demon Hunter College.

According to their rules, they had to show their faces to the new students one by one.

It wasn’t their turn yet.

When they saw that Wang Xian had defeated Liang Chuan from the young master’s mercenary group, they shook their heads in surprise.

To be able to defeat Liang Chuan, they were definitely ranked among the new students. However, it was a pity that what he had done just now had completely offended the young master’s mercenary group.

The young master’s mercenary group would definitely seek revenge and establish its prestige among the freshmen.

“Kid, just you wait. If there is a place for you in the demon hunting mercenary group in the future, our young master’s mercenary group will have wasted our time!”

Liang Chuan got up with an embarrassed expression. He stared at Wang Xian with a dark gaze and said fiercely.

“Young Master’s mercenary group? Hehe, trash, you guys better not embarrass yourselves here!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The corners of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly. He glanced at them with disdain and ignored them.

“Good, very good. Let’s just wait and see then!”

Liang Chuan’s face revealed a hint of malevolence. He flung the fan in his hand angrily and walked straight ahead.

“Shh!”

Some students who were not too clear about the young master’s mercenary group in the surroundings hissed, causing the five of them to look even more embarrassed.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly and looked at Hua Fenghua who was beside him!

Hua Fenghua stood to the left of Wang Xian. Her expression kept changing as she said, “Just you wait!”

After saying that, she immediately returned to her original position with a dejected expression.

Wang Xian ignored her and stood there waiting.

“Brother, you have to be more careful in the future. If you offend the young master’s mercenary group, you will be in big trouble in the future!”

At this moment, a young man in front took a step back and turned around to remind Wang Xian in a low voice.

“Yes, thank you for your reminder!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and didn’t pay too much attention to it.

“Sigh!”

The young man in front shook his head when he saw Wang Xian’s appearance and didn’t say anything else.

He was from Donghai City and had a better understanding of the young master’s mercenary group. The young man behind him was going to be done for.

“Boom! Boom!”

One by one, the students from the Demon Hunters Academy’s mercenary group walked over to introduce themselves. Half an hour later, the gate of the Demon Hunters Academy opened with a loud bang.

Twenty middle-aged men walked over in unison.

They were wearing uniform black armor with the word “Hunting”written on their chests.

A group of twenty people walked over like an army.

The hearts of the new students were slightly shaken. They stood up in a hurry and the sounds of their conversation quickly disappeared.

“Eh?”

Wang Xian swept his gaze over and discovered two familiar figures.

One was a middle-aged man whom he had grabbed with his palm, and the other was a white-haired old man.

Wang Xian remembered that this white-bearded old man was the dean of the Order Department. He had the strength of a transcendent level seven.

Vice Dean Xia was not among them.

“I am one of the four vice presidents of the Demon Hunter Academy, Vice Dean Zhao. Now, all new students, take out your admission notices and enter the academy. The academy will randomly assign you ten learning grounds!”

“Each learning ground will have two teachers to teach you. Before you enter the academy, Worship the heroes of the Demon Hunter mercenary group!”

The old man wearing a black hat in the middle looked straight ahead and said indifferently.
