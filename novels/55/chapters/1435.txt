Chapter 1436: Why would 1436 need to explain to you? Go

“I’ll give you three seconds. Kneel down or Die!”

An incomparably tyrannical voice came from the mouth of an emperor.

He stood up. His burly body stared coldly at Phoenix Phoenix and the rest.

Why would he need to explain to you? It explained the invincible stance of the blood flow empire.

In the entire hall, when that Emperor stood up and spoke, traces of power filled the entire hall. Everyone held their breaths and looked at him with incomparably grave expressions.

“Hehe, why do you have to explain to us? You are really domineering, Haha!”

When Wang Xian heard the words of the emperor, he sneered and stood up with a loud laugh.

“Do you guys still have the qualifications to say such words?”

He narrowed his eyes slightly and swept his gaze across the two emperors. A faint sneer appeared on his face.

“Huh?”

Seeing Wang Xian standing up with a cold laugh, everyone was slightly taken aback. An incredulous look appeared on their faces.

He was really courting death!

“Bang!”

The emperor from the bloodshed empire was evidently stunned as well. His calm face revealed a look of anger.

He gently placed the scepter in his hand on the ground. A muffled sound rang out.

An invisible aura directly charged forward.

“The blood flow empire is indeed a little overbearing. This isn’t your world, and we aren’t your chess pieces either!”

Suddenly, a faint voice sounded from the heavenly sword sect.

Sect leader Ling sat there and looked at the two emperors above, his eyes flickering.

“Oh?”

“This...”

“Sect leader Ling of the Heavenly Sword sect, he... he actually also...”

When everyone’s gaze landed on sect leader Ling, they were all extremely shocked.

Sect leader Ling of the Heavenly Sword sect also opened his mouth to speak, what did this mean?

Was he also expressing his dissatisfaction towards the blood flow empire?

The sect leader of the Heavenly Sword sect was a sixth level void interpretation expert, an existence that could match the strongest fighting strength of the blood flow empire.

“Ling Xiaoyun of the Heaven Sword sect, do you really think that you can become an enemy of our blood flow empire just because you’ve broken through to the sixth level of the profound void tier? !”

Standing on the stage, the blood flow prince’s pupils constricted slightly. He looked at Sect Master Ling’s position with an embarrassed expression.

“It seems that there are still quite a number of people who have objections against our blood flow empire. Haha, Good, good. Our blood flow empire has not made a move for over a thousand years!”

“Some people really think that they can challenge our blood flow empire’s prestige just by breaking through to the sixth rank of the profound void tier. Anyone who disobeys our orders, all of you, stand out!”

“Boom!”

Another emperor slowly opened his eyes. He stood up and looked at the sect master of the Heavenly Sword Sect, sweeping his gaze across all the factions in the hall.

The might of a sixth rank profound void tier expert was directly emitted. The terrifying aura caused even the profound void tier experts present to feel their breathing slow!

“Emperor, please calm down. We don’t Dare!”

“Emperor, please calm down. We have no objections!”

The expressions of the blood flow empire’s family forces and subordinate forces changed drastically. They hurriedly stood up and bowed.

Their gazes glanced at the sky sword sect and the dragon-phoenix Empire. Their eyes were somewhat cold.

The other forces also hurriedly stood up and bowed.

When the Emperor was angry, blood would flow for thousands of miles!

They simply didn’t have the ability to resist.

“The Sky Sword sect and the dragon-phoenix Empire aren’t satisfied, right?”

The emperor placed the scepter in front of him and placed his palms on it as he asked coldly.

“Just as the dragon-phoenix Queen said, this world isn’t your blood flow empire’s!”

Just as he finished asking, the Light Dragon King slowly stood up and said expressionlessly.

“Our Blood Stream sect is not a chess piece of your blood stream empire!”

Sect Master Yi of the Blood Stream sect also stood up and said with a smile on his face.

“What?”

“The Light Dragon Empire and the blood stream sect also stood up against the Blood Stream Empire. Could it be that they have long been prepared, or... ?”

“My God, the Sky Sword sect, the Light Dragon Empire’s blood stream sect, and the dragon-phoenix Empire are among the most powerful forces now. The four of them actually don’t give face to the Blood Stream Empire!”

When the sect masters of the Light Dragon Dynasty and the blood stream sect stood up, the entire hall was in an uproar.

They looked at the four top-tier forces in astonishment.

All of them gulped.

What did they want to do?

“Are you... are you going to rebel?”

Prince Blood Stream’s expression changed slightly when he saw the two top-tier forces stand up and he asked in a stern voice.

“We don’t belong to your bloodflow empire to begin with. Why would we go against you? Do you really think that we are your subjects?”

Feng Luan stared at Prince Bloodflow and said indifferently.

“Haha, Good, good. Among the four top-tier forces, our Bloodflow Empire still has the same words. Kneel down now and spare your lives. Otherwise, you will die!”

“The rest of you, listen to my orders!”

“Buzz!”

An emperor laughed out loud with a cold expression. His domineering voice entered everyone’s ears. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

His gaze swept across the dragon-phoenix Empire, Sky Sword Sect, Light Dragon Empire and the Bloodflow sect as he shouted at everyone around him.

At the last moment, he raised the scepter in his hand. A terrifying aura gathered on it.

“Kneel down or Die!”

The people from the families and subordinate dynasties in the bloodshed empire stood up immediately. A weapon appeared in front of them. A murderous aura emanated from their bodies as they roared loudly!

The expressions of the other factions changed drastically. They stood there without saying a word.

“Kneel down or Die? Old Man, do you really think that you can kill whoever you want? Let’s give it a try then!”

Wang Xian looked at the two old men who seemed to have the power of life and death in their hands. A hint of mockery appeared on his face as he stared at them and said coldly.

At the same time, an aura charged directly at one of the old men.

“Haha, We Really Need to give it a try to find out!”

Sect Master Ling also laughed out loud. His body trembled slightly and a terrifying metallic radiance charged directly at the other emperor!

“You’re courting death!”

When the Emperor felt the impact of Wang Xian’s aura, his expression changed slightly.

He waved the scepter in his hand and a blood-red radiance charged towards Wang Xian.

The moment he made his move, he wanted to kill him.

“Hehe!”

A destructive aura gathered in Wang Xian’s palm.

“Buzz!”

He waved his arm to the left. The terrifying blood-red radiance charged towards the side.

“Not good!”

“Block, Block!”

The expressions of the blood flow empire’s forces on the left changed drastically, and they hurriedly shouted.

“Thick Earth Shield!”

An Elder’s expression changed drastically, and an earthen-yellow shield appeared in front of him as he shouted loudly.

The two-meter-tall shield blocked in front of him.

However, the blood-red light easily pierced through the shield.

“Ah!”

Screams sounded.

The emperor’s attack instantly killed three or four insightful void martial artists.

“The nameless sword demon is a level 6 insightful void martial artist!”

A shocked voice sounded from the surroundings.
