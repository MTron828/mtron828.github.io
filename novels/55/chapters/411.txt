Chapter 412: Too Trash

A young man couldn’t contain his excitement and asked, “Excuse me, Sect Leader Sun. Could you clarify the requirements to join the Mechanic Sect?”

This was a sect established by the son of the richest man in Southern Province. He also had the strength of a Half-step to Inborn expert and two Saints from Sacred Sects as Honorary Elders.

Despite the recent establishment, this sect wouldn’t be weak.

Moreover, with the wealth of the son of the richest man, the sect wouldn’t be lacking in resources.

“I’ll let Saint Qi and Saint Wen hold the assessment in a while. If your talents are great or you are above Level 5 martial artists, you can join directly. Level 9 martial artists can join as an Elder directly. The resources you get to enjoy in our ancestral sect will be beyond everyone’s expectations!” Sun Longxuan looked at that young man and answered with a smile.

The threshold of Level 5 martial artist to join wasn’t particularly high. Moreover, Sun Longxuan mentioned the resources of the new sect. This tempted many people.

Many martial artists in the hall were moved. Even some first-class and second-class families had the intentions to join the Mechanic Sect.

Joining a first-class force with a strong background could be greatly beneficial for them.

Considering that Mechanic Sect had just been established, joining now might make them the core of the sect in the future.

“I hope I can make it through the assessment!”

“Wow! The Mechanic Sect has just been established. This is the best time to join them. I definitely must get in.”

Seeing the crowd being moved, Sun Longxuan was filled with anticipation and satisfaction. He placed both of his hands behind his back and said, “The Mechanic Sect has a complete cultivation legacy directly to the Inborn Realm and even higher!”

“Hehe. Let me assess your talents!”

A young man beside Sun Longxuan stepped forward and looked at the crowd. He opened up his palm and revealed a round ball.

The round ball was densely packed with small holes.

He threw it lightly into the air and the round ball suspended above the banquet hall.

Swish swish swish!

At this moment, countless metal beads flew downward.

The round beads didn’t fly down without order. Instead, it was as though they had targets in mind as they landed on selected people.

Two round beads flew towards Wang Xian and Lan Qingyue.

Wang Xian and Lan Qingyue were taken aback. They reached out and caught the round metal beads, feeling a tinge of unexplainable attraction from them.

“This is likely a unique method to assess one’s talents. Some cultivation arts require unique cultivation talents!”

Wang Xian looked at the round beads in his hand and explained to Lan Qingyue.

“This Mechanic Sect is really interesting. They are using things like those in sci-fi movies!” chuckled Lan Qingyue.

Eh?

As the round beads fell onto various martial artists in the hall, Sun Longxuan’s gaze followed and landed in the direction where the first two beads flew to.

These beads were made from special metals and could sense if one had an affinity to the metal attribute.

The first few beads would go for those with the best talents.

When he saw Wang Xian and Lan Qingyue, he was taken aback slightly.

His attention fell on Lan Qingyue and he was impressed by her beauty. Soon, his eyebrows knitted together and he walked towards her.

“Hey, beautiful girl, the first assessment round bead has fallen into your hand. It would appear you have great talents and are destined to be with my Mechanic Sect!”

Sun Longxuan walked to Lan Qingyue. At a closer distance, he was even more attracted and in awe as he spoke to her.

“Would this beautiful girl be interested in joining an ancestral sect?”

“Nope!” Lan Qingyue shook her head, placed the round bead on the table and gave a friendly smile.

“Oh? That’s fine. Join our Mechanic Sect and you will be our first disciple. I would provide you with a large amount of resources and groom you to be an expert. What do you think?”

Excitement gleamed in his eyes as he made his proposal. Not only was he able to get a talented disciple but he would also be able to get a breathtakingly beautiful girl.

“I’m sorry. I’m not interested!” Lan Qingyue shook her head and answered apologetically.

Huh?

Upon hearing Lan Qingyue, Sun Longxuan’s face stiffened and his smile was forced.

Rejection! She actually rejected me?

He was the son of the richest man in Southern Province and a Half-step to Inborn expert. Moreover, he had even called upon two Saints from a Sacred Sect, who were both Inborn experts, to prop up his sect.

Any of these three reasons would be an overwhelming attraction against any family or sect in Southern Province. He was certain that no one could possibly reject his personal invitation.

Yet, he was rejected for his very first invitation. This embarrassed him.

Sun Longxuan raised an eyebrow and discontent gleamed in his eyes. “Hey, beautiful girl, are you looking down on the ancestral sect that I, Sun Longxuan, am establishing? Do you think a first-class force isn’t attractive at all?”

“This...”

As Sun Longxuan walked towards Wang Xian and Lan Qingyue, the entire banquet hall had gone silent. Everyone looked on in shock at the development.

“Sss... This... Will this end up in a fight?”

“Why do I have a bad premonition about this!”

“Does she need a reason for not joining?”

Sun Longxuan was overly confident and direct to the point of arrogance. Lan Qingyue looked at him with ridicule gleaming in her eyes.

“Haha, of course. I, Sun Longxuan, like to get to the roots of all things. I can say that in the entire Southern Province, not a single force would be stronger than my Mechanic Sect!”

Sun Longxuan contorted his lips into a smile proudly as he stared coldly at Lan Qingyue.

Pa!

“Because your Mechanic Sect is too trash!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Seeing this brat questioning Lan Qingyue, Wang Xian revealed a smirk, threw the round bead in his hand on the table and answered on her behalf plainly.

Huh?

Upon hearing Wang Xian’s response, Sun Longxuan’s expression instantly turned gloomy. He turned around, glowered at him and remarked harshly, “Brat, I dare you to repeat what you’ve just said!”

“Getting to the roots of all things might not be a good thing. Let me say this again: Your Mechanic Sect is too trash!”

Wang Xian stared right back at Sun Longxuan and repeated himself with contempt.

Hahahaha!

Sun Longxuan broke into hysterical laughter. He glowered at Wang Xian with killing intent gleaming in his eyes. He raised an eyebrow and continued, “You dare to call the sect that I, Sun Longxuan, am establishing trash? Come! Tell me about your family or sect. We can have a life and death battle to see who will be annihilated first. Rising through the ranks while stepping on your sect would be a great idea!”

“This..”

“This son of Mogul Sun is... Simply...”

“Is this confidence or arrogance? He’s going to cause the downfall of his father!”

“Stepping on Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown to rise in ranks and to establish his authority? Is he going to create a sacred sect?”

Everyone in the banquet hall had turned solemn upon seeing how things had developed. The son of Mogul Sun was pretty strong and had an incredible background. However, why was he so ignorant?

In the entire banquet hall, you could offend anyone but Lan Qingyue and Miracle Doctor Wang. Yet, he chose to do so.

“I don’t belong to any sect!” Wang Xian looked straight at Sun Longxuan and answered plainly.

“Haha! Factionless and yet you dare to be so brazen?”

Sun Longxuan looked at Wang Xian with contempt before lifting his head proudly and turning to the entire banquet hall.

“Those who have received the round beads are all qualified to join my Mechanic Sect. Those who wish to join the Mechanic Sect can all come forward right now. Let the sect teach this brat who dares to insult our Mechanic Sect. We will let him know the strength of our Mechanic Sect!”
