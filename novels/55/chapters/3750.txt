3751 In the midst of the death of the 3750 Skyfire Patriarch

Boom! Boom! Boom

A surge of energy suddenly rose up and attracted the attention of all the strong disciples around.

Wang Xian flew into the air and looked over curiously.

On a flaming planet on the right, an enormous sun suddenly rose up in the sky.

Beneath the Sun, there was a majestic shadow!

“What’s going on? What Happened?”

“Is there a treasure coming out? Let’s go, Let’s go and take a look!”

“Quick, there might be a treasure coming out!”

On the surrounding flaming planet, the experts looked over. Their eyes glowed and they immediately flew over.

Wang Xian swept his gaze over and narrowed his eyes. He had a surprised expression on his face.

“Is there an expert who has broken through to the second stage of the Universe Overlord Realm? An expert from a peak race?”

He mumbled to himself and hesitated for a moment. Then, his body moved and flew over as well!

“Hahaha, there are no treasures here. There’s only your flame Lord!”

“Congratulations, Patriarch, for your breakthrough again!”

“Congratulations, Patriarch, for your breakthrough again!”

At that moment, wild, excited laughter rang out, accompanied by respectful shouts.

These voices caused the surrounding experts to pause for a moment.

“What? Patriarch Skyfire made another breakthrough?”

“Patriarch Skyfire made another breakthrough? Patriarch Skyfire? How is this possible? It’s only been a hundred thousand years, and Patriarch Skyfire made another breakthrough?”

“Hiss, Patriarch Skyfire has made another breakthrough. Doesn’t that mean that he now has the strength of a ruler at the second stage? This… just how big of an opportunity did Patriarch Skyfire obtain last time?”

The experts flying over narrowed their eyes slightly, and their faces revealed an incomparably shocked expression!

Patriarch Skyfire was the first known existence to break through to the ruler realm in the starry cosmos.

He was also the first expert to discover the fiery heart land.

However, he had broken through again in just a hundred thousand years?

This made them feel a little incredulous.

How long had it been?

He had advanced from the first level of ruler realm to the second level of ruler realm?

“It’s really terrifying. The Skyfire sect has already advanced to the peak race. Now that Patriarch Skyfire has advanced again, the Skyfire sect has once again experienced tremendous development!”

“It’s hard to imagine what kind of treasure the Skyfire Patriarch has obtained to be able to advance so quickly. It’s too heaven-defying!”

“The Skyfire Patriarch should be the one who has obtained the greatest opportunity out of all the experts.”

The surrounding discussions and shock continued to ring out.

“Haha, Our Skyfire sect is recruiting fire attribute experts to join us. I will personally guide those who have reached the peak of the venerate realm!”

At this moment, the shadow of the Sun above the fiery planet slowly solidified. Terrifying Flames enveloped it, making it look extremely terrifying!

The sun above his head had risen two levels in a row. In this place, he was worthy of being called the Flame Sovereign King!

Even on the fiery planet occupied by the distant fire Phoenix, there were experts looking over with sparkling eyes.

“This sky fire ancestor has definitely obtained an extremely powerful treasure. He has broken through to the ruler realm in such a short period of time and rose another level. He has a treasure in his hands!”

One of the fire phoenixes looked over, and his expression changed slightly.

He flapped his wings slightly, and a thoughtful expression appeared on his face.

“100% . This rate of improvement is too terrifying. He definitely has an extremely valuable treasure in his hands!”

The eyes of one of the fire phoenixes next to him were also slightly burning!

This rate of improvement was too heaven-defying!

It was so heaven-defying that they were somewhat jealous.

“Why don’t we…”

A fire Phoenix’s eyes flashed as he looked at his companion beside him. A trace of killing intent flashed in his eyes.

“If we attack, it might not be a good influence.”

The fire Phoenix beside him turned into human form and frowned slightly.

“Not a good influence? Our Phoenix clan doesn’t need to care about the opinions of ants. The calamity is still a few billion years away. We have to increase our strength as soon as possible!”

The Fire Phoenix spoke!

“If our clan’s Lord finds out about this, he might blame us!”

The other fire Phoenix was still hesitant!

“My Grandfather is an elder. It’s fine. If we can obtain a supreme treasure, it’ll be worth it!”

The fire Phoenix’s eyes slowly revealed a look of determination. He looked at his companion beside him and said, “If you don’t make a move, then I’ll make a move!”

“Alright, if he really has a powerful supreme treasure in his hands, then it’s worth it to make a move!”

The hesitant fire phoenix gritted his teeth and his eyes revealed killing intent.

They looked at each other before their bodies moved and immediately flew forward! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Huh?”

At a position not far from them, several fire phoenixes noticed their actions and their eyes flickered slightly.

“If I knew this would happen, I would have made the first move!”

One of the fire phoenixes mumbled as he looked at them indifferently!

“Eh?”

Wang Xian was floating in front of the flaming star. Looking at the mighty Phoenix tribe in front of him, his eyes sparkled.

However, at this moment, he felt something and looked to the side.

Two fire phoenixes were flying towards them at a rapid speed.

According to Wang Xian’s senses, they had the strength of a level three universe overlord.

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

“Hehe, flame sovereign king, who dares to call themselves flame sovereign king in front of us fire phoenixes? What arrogance!”

Suddenly, a Phoenix cry was heard along with a voice.

“Huh?”

In the sky above the blazing planet in front, Skyfire Patriarch, who was under the sun, looked over and his expression froze.

“Oh? Fire Phoenixes? The two fire phoenixes? What are they doing?”

“Are they dissatisfied with the Skyfire Patriarch? Calling themselves the flame monarch in front of the Fire Phoenixes?”

“It should be that this title has angered the Fire Phoenixes.”

When the surrounding disciples saw this, they were slightly shocked as they transmitted their voices in a low voice!

“Sirs, I was boasting shamelessly just now and offended the two fire phoenixes. Please forgive me!”

The Skyfire Patriarch hurriedly explained when he saw the two fire phoenixes fly over.

He lowered his attitude very, very low!

Although he had broken through to the second stage of the ruler realm, he didn’t dare to be arrogant in front of the Phoenixes!

After all, they were a powerful peak race, and there was still a huge gap between him and them!

“Peak races are not to be offended. Anyone who dares to offend a peak race will have to pay a terrible price!”

A fire phoenix stared at him and coldly said. A faint aura surged out from him!

His words caused Patriarch Skyfire’s expression to change dramatically, and a solemn and embarrassed expression appeared in his eyes!

“Milord, I was wrong just now. I spoke too much. If you want to punish me, Punish Me!”

At this moment, a middle-aged man was kneeling on the ground and shouting in fear!

“Patriarch Skyfire, come with us!”

The two fire phoenixes frowned slightly when they saw this. Their gazes landed on Patriarch Skyfire as they coldly ordered!

Their words caused Patriarch Skyfire’s heart to tighten once again!
