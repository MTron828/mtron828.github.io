“Dragon King, it’s done.”

“We’ve killed all of them, none of them escaped.”

Just as Ao Qitian broke out of the formation, Ao Jian and Ao Yao also broke out from the black holes.

Ao Jian, an undying level 9 Dragon Guard and an undying level 9 mad dragon immediately used the world end ruler to attack, easily killing everyone from the world end sect.

Ao Yao led a few hundred subordinates to launch an assassination attack. After killing elder world’s end in an instant, the rest were easily killed as well.

There was no need to mention the position at the front. Elder world’s end was parasitized and easily annihilated the rest.

“AO qitian, what happened on your side?”

Wang Xian stood at the position outside. When he saw the members of the Dragon Palace coming out, he glanced at the surrounding corpses and looked at AO qitian in puzzlement.

Ao Qitian was at the peak of the Immortal King Realm. There shouldn’t be any accidents on his side.

“I’m not too sure either. When I killed a deacon from the world’s end, a red light suddenly flew out from his body. After the red light flew out, it disappeared immediately. I wonder what this red light is.”

Ao Qitian said with a slight frown.

The universe was so big that there were all kinds of treasures. There were also all kinds of life-saving treasures.

Take Wang Xian’s soul-returning fluid for example. Even though it was completely destroyed, it could still be resurrected and rebuilt.

Other people might also obtain such heaven-defying treasures.

Hence, when Ao Qitian saw the red light, he felt a little strange.

“Dragon King, I also sensed a special energy that penetrated through the array formation and disappeared instantly.”

At the side, Heaven Array said with a frown.

“It’s very likely that Deacon Tian Ya obtained a powerful treasure and escaped with his life.”

Wang Xian was deep in thought.

Under such a strange situation, he must have escaped after obtaining the treasure.

If he could obtain the treasure, others could too.

“Dragon King, once someone escapes, our hunt for the world margin sect might be exposed.”

“Why don’t I get my men to stop and kill the guy who escaped?”

Ba Qi said from the side.

There were only three elders of the world margin sect now, and all three of them were parasitized. They were all on the same side.

“Yeah, it’s best if we can stop the person who escaped. If we can’t, then forget it. What can they do even if they know?”

Wang Xian nodded at Ba Qi.

“I’ll inform them immediately.”

Ba Qi immediately took out his AI and gave an order to his three subordinates.

...

“The Dragon Palace is actually ambushing us. Have they been following us? They’re dead. The elders and the rest are all dead.”

“If I didn’t obtain the worldly treasure back then, I would be dead by now.”

“Dragon Palace, Dragon King, you all deserve to die, you all deserve to die, I will tell this to the sect leader, the forefather, the elders, destroy the Dragon Palace, destroy the Dragon Palace.”

At this time, within an undying country within the space crack, a red blood image floated within.

His face was filled with excitement, waving his arm, a backup communication stone plate appeared before him.

This was the backup communication method of the top experts of the world margin sect. It was able to contact the experts of the world margin sect.

Without any hesitation, he sent the news to the elders, the hierarch, and the Patriarch.

At the same time, when the patriarch and the Hierarch of the World Margin Sect received the news, their faces changed dramatically, and they immediately flew toward his position.

“Dragon King, it’s too late to stop them. The news is about to be leaked.”

At the front of the Abyss, when the patriarch, the sect master, and the elders of the world margin sect flew over, the news was also transmitted over.

“So what if you know? Even if the world margin sect does something next, they won’t be able to hide it from us.”

“We can still use some means to slowly hunt them down.”

Wang Xian smiled. He did not mind that the world margin sect knew that the Dragon Palace was trying to assassinate them.

Currently, there were only six undying godly monarch level 9 and above in the world margin sect.

The three elders were on the same side. Once the world margin sect made a move, they would definitely not hide it from the Dragon Palace.

Their actions were just sending themselves to their deaths.

“Jie Jie, I’ll get Mo Sha to work hard and get me six undying godly monarch level 9 abyssal seed corpses. In a few days, I’ll head to the world margin sect to become the sect leader.”

Ba Qi laughed sinisterly.

“Ka Ka Ka!”

At this time, in front of the universe, the two forefathers, the sect leader and the three elders of the world margin sect floated in the air with gloomy expressions.

With a wave of their arms, the space in front of them immediately tore apart.

In their sight, an undying country appeared in front of them.

The six of them moved and instantly arrived within the god country.

... CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Forefather! Forefather!”

The group had just entered when a shrill voice resounded.

Within the god country, a red blood thread silhouette floated there, it was extremely excited when it saw the group.

“Little Yu, what exactly happened?”

Tian Ya saw the miserable state of Deacon Tian Ya, he asked coldly.

“Forefather, we along with elder an and elder Zhao searched for news of our disciples, they were all covered by an array midway.”

“A Pinnacle Undying Emperor from the Dragon Palace attacked and killed all of us. I had a chance of survival because I obtained a treasure before.”

“Forefather, the elders are all dead. You have to avenge them, avenge them!”

Deacon Tian Ya shouted excitedly.

“The Dragon Palace ambushed you midway? All the elders were killed?”

His words made the two forefathers of the world margin sect reveal a brutal expression.

...

“Yes, I don’t know if the others escaped.”

Deacon Tian Ya shook his head and said angrily.

“Did you see clearly the pinnacle undying god King warrior that the Dragon Palace attacked?”

Sect Master Tian Ya’s expression changed as he asked.

“No, I didn’t see who attacked, but I’m 100% sure it was the Dragon Palace.”

Deacon Tian Ya shook his head.

“Patriarch, elder an, elder Zhao, and the others are all dead. We must avenge them!”

An elder on the side shouted with a trembling body.

“Patriarch, give the order. We will fight the Dragon Palace to the death!”

“We will fight to the death!”

Sect Master Tian ya shouted while the three elders on the side responded in unison.

“Hahaha, you’ve killed so many experts of the horizon sect, and you’re still carrying out assassinations. If we don’t take revenge, then what’s the point of us living? The Horizon sect has been established for nearly a hundred million years, and we’ve never feared anyone.”

“This time, even if we die, we’ll make the Dragon Palace pay a terrible price!”

A patriarch laughed wildly and roared crazily.

“Kill, Kill, Kill!”

A patriarch next to him shouted the word “Kill”one after another. His body trembled as he looked around at the top level of the world margin sect.

“If the Dragon Palace wants to assassinate us, we must find Protector Emperor first. Whether Protector Emperor helps us or not, we must be prepared to fight to the death.”
