“Everyone, take a Devil’s Skeletal Pill each and swallow it now!”

Wang Xian looked at his Dragonians with satisfaction.

Dragonians were 100 percent loyal and die-hard fans, and that was the advantage. They would not have the slightest hesitation, even if Wang Xian asked them to commit suicide.

In their eyes, he was God.

“Thank you, Dragon King!”

When Dragonians opened their eyes, a virtual image of a Devil Dragon flashed in their eyes as they had one knee down, shouting out respectfully.

Wang Xian swung his arm, suspending the Devil’s Skeletal Pills in the air before them.

After the Dragonians consumed the pills, they closed their eyes immediately and absorbed it.

Kacha, kacha!

Soon, a bone-cracking sound came from their bodies as a virtual image of a Skeletal Dragon slowly surfaced above their heads.

The Skeletal Dragon hovered over their heads before slowly entering their bodies.

Their bones had undergone terrifying change. On their skin, the faint dragon scales that surfaced turned into boney scales that looked like some daunting armor.

Their five fingers grew longer, exuding a touch of black radiance.

“Using the blood of the Skeletal Dragon for the production of elixir pills seemed to have had a special effect!”

The Devil’s Arts that Mo Qinglong was cultivating came with dark attributes, while the Skeletal Dragon was considered to be the mutation of those dark attributes. As a result, it had strengthened their bones, which turned them into something more powerful.

“Fifty Dragonians. Considering those who had just advanced to Inborn Realm, they could even match up to Pinnacle Inborn. That’s how strong the bloodline is!”

Wang Xian smiled as he watched those Dragonians with rapid ascension in their strength.

With the strength of fifty Dragonians enhanced at the same time, their black energies slowly gathered together, forming a Skeletal Dragon.

As the Skeletal Dragon crouched above them, the imposing stance could strike fear into anyone, including experts of the Dan Realm.

...

“That lad escaped. That lad actually ran away!”

“How could he have such domineering strength? This is impossible. It hasn’t been long since we last saw him and he has already advanced to Half-step to Inborn.”

“That brat was too gifted. No wonder Madam had to take the risk to kill him!”

“He’s only fifteen, and he is already a Half-step to Inborn. It’s almost a 100 percent chance for him to advance to Inborn Realm or an even higher level. If he grows up, it will be troublesome!”

“I wonder what kind of fortuitous encounter he had to become so powerful, especially with that petrifying sapphire flame!”

At this moment, five people were discussing and standing along a remote road in Rivertown with cold perspiration all over their bodies.

There were charred bodies scattered around on the floor, looking unusually scary.

Spots of fresh blood were spilled around while the ground had several cracks in it. Apparently, a ferocious battle had broken out here.

A fifteen-year-old Half-step to Inborn sounded horrifying.

“If Madam learned about this, she wouldn’t be able to sleep from now on!”

Several middle-aged men exchanged gazes with each other. Amongst them, two were Half-step to Inborn, Level 9 Martial Artists. Those lying on the ground were all Level 9 Martial Artists.

Ever since the group of people who were chasing that brat had disappeared, Madam sent an even more powerful bunch of people to kill that brat.

This time, they learned about the news of that brat from the Omniscient Group. Hence, they rushed over just to kill him off. At first, they thought it would be an easy job. But none of them expected that he could slaughter five Level 9 Martial Artists all by himself.

At the same time, he fled from their hands.

“We must report to Madam immediately!”

A middle-aged man suppressed the horror within himself and took out a communication device immediately.

“Xiao Shisan, is everything settled?”

Soon, a wealthy-looking lady appeared in the video call. She was standing in a training field and was not looking into the camera. Instead, she was gazing at something ahead of her, wearing a smile.

“Madam, we are in trouble!”

Xiao Shisan took a deep breath before he lowered his head and answered with a grimace.

“Hur? You let that brat escape again?”

Eyes turned cold as the wealthy-looking lady stared at Xiao Shisan on the screen.

“Madam!”

Through the screen, Xiao Shisan could sense the imposing bearing. His voice was shaking. “We tried to stop him half-way, but he killed five of our people!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“What? Someone is protecting that brat?”

That wealthy-looking lady raised her eyebrows as vexation became caught in between her locked brows.

“No... not that. He killed five of our people alone. He’s now a Half-step to Inborn, a Half-step to Inborn!”

“What did you say?” that wealthy-looking lady shrieked, ruining all her nobility.

“Half-step to Inborn. I don’t know what kind of fortuitous encounter he had, but he possesses the strength of Half-step to Inborn. And...And, he’s got a terrifying flame!”

Xiao Shisan was shaken as he answered. Such a gifted talent would shine in the sky, causing everything to pale in comparison.

“Half-step to Inborn. A fifteen-year-old Half-step to Inborn? Are you sure you’re not talking nonsense?!”

The wealthy-looking lady was in total disbelief as she grasped the device, staring into the screen.

“We’re sure. We’re 100 percent sure. That brat has a domineering gift!”

Xiao Shisan nodded his head with force.

“Half-step to Inborn. A Half-step to Inborn at age fifteen!”

The wealthy-looking lady was stupefied as she looked at her son in the training field before her.

Her son was eighteen, and he had only become a Half-step to Inborn after he was given a vast amount of resources for his cultivation.

Even so, a son who was a Half-step to Inborn enjoyed a supreme status in the entire Sacred Clan. The word ‘genius’ was insufficient to describe him.

Even the Laozu of the clan was full of praises for him. He was only eighteen, and everyone already recognized him as the next successor for the Xiao Family.

He was, no doubt, the next successor of the Sacred Clan.

Yet, that brat... that bastard had actually advanced to Half-step to Inborn.

“No way. Absolutely no way. If anyone finds out that he has such domineering gifts and strength, the elders in the clan will be grooming him with everything they have. Till then, Fan’er’s status and that hatred from that boy...”

Radiance flashed in that wealthy-looking lady’s eyes as she slowly revealed her craziness. “We must stop that brat from growing up. We cannot let him live!”

“You guys will wait there. I’ll send an Inborn Expert over!” that wealthy-looking lady commanded Xiao Shisan coldly.

“Yes, yes!”

When Xiao Shisan saw the murderous intent in Madam’s eyes, fear took over him as he hurriedly nodded his head.

After they hung up, the wealthy-looking lady was clenching her fist tightly.

At this time, a dashing and handsome juvenile in the training field held his prideful chin up and asked that wealthy-looking lady, “Mum, how was it? Given my current strength, I’m sure I can be in the top ten on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart. Till then, I’ll be the youngest hero!”

“That’s true. Fan’er, you’re the most remarkable one. No one at your age can compare to you. You’re the brightest moon in the sky. The rest are only insignificant starlight!”

The wealthy-looking lady had glittering eyes as she looked at her son with a beaming face.

“Of course. I wonder where Xiao Ran, his mother, and his sister fleed to. They have been on the run for a year. If I see him again, I’ll cripple him with one hand. Haha!”
