Chapter 1240: Battle 1241 Prodigy

Translator: 5496903

Boom! Boom! Boom

In the sky, numerous golden swords attacked Zhou Yanjun continuously. The terrifying penetrating force caused his expression to change drastically.

“I admit defeat!”

With just this move, Zhou Yanjun could feel the terror of Wang Xian.

Facing Wang Xian, he felt as though he was facing an insightful emptiness realm expert.

After receiving this move, Zhou Yanjun said hurriedly and turned around to retreat outside.

Wang Xian nodded his head indifferently and didn’t continue to attack. He had no enmity with Zhou Yanjun and wouldn’t kill him for no reason.

“Hiss, so fast. Zhou Yanjun only received one move and admitted defeat!”

“Zhou Yanjun may have sensed the difference between him and his opponent. Didn’t you see Zhou Yanjun’s face turn slightly red just now when he received the next move?”

When the surrounding people saw Zhou Yanjun quickly admitting defeat, they were all surprised.

However, most of them didn’t show much surprise. With the strength of the Nameless Heaven’s pride expert, there was basically no opponent in the bottom 20.

“With his strength, I feel that he can at least be ranked in the top five!”

Zhou Yanjun took a deep look at Wang Xian and thought to himself. He directly entered the arena that was ranked 20th.

The winner went up and the loser went down. This was the rule of the Heaven’s favorites arena.

Wang Xian revealed a smile. His body moved and he went straight to a room at the side.

There was an additional porcelain bottle in the room which contained 600 bottles of spiritual liquid.

The entire Heaven’s favorites arena was a huge formation that was operating. As long as there was energy, it would be able to operate continuously.

The energy came from the spiritual liquid. Every time a heaven’s favorites arena battle was fought, one would receive one bottle of spiritual liquid to enter and watch it.

Every time a prodigy battle took place, there would be tens of thousands of people watching, and this array received ten thousand spirit liquid every time.

The array had its own rules. The reward for defeating the 19th place was only six hundred spirit liquid, which was not much. But when it was the top five, it would be the time to truly earn spirit liquid.

Five people defeating the fourth place would receive five thousand spirit liquid.

The reward for defeating the third place was 10,000 spiritual liquid.

The reward for defeating the second place was 20,000 spiritual liquid.

The reward for defeating the first place was 40,000 spiritual liquid.

If Wang Xian could defeat the first place from the 20th place, he would be able to obtain about 90,000 spiritual liquid in total.

As for the 90,000 spiritual liquid, it was about 63 million dragon crystals. Although there was still a huge gap between them and one billion dragon crystals, the speed was fast!

At most, they would reach the top in a dozen days. If everything went smoothly, they would be able to obtain 90,000 spiritual liquid in a day.

“Continue!”

Without any hesitation, Wang Xian directly challenged the 18th place.

To Wang Xian’s surprise, the 18th place young man on the Heaven’s pride roll was cultivating in his cultivation room. He accepted the challenge on the spot.

Following that, the crushing began.

“Quick, look at The Prodigy roll. The strength of the nameless prodigy is increasing rapidly. Oh My God, he was only ranked 20th just now. Now, he’s already ranked 13th!”

“The speed of his improvement is too fast. He’s on par with that Mu Yuan!”

“Mu Yuan has already risen to eighth place. I wonder if the nameless prodigy and Mu Yuan will clash. I wonder which of these two dark horses is stronger!”

At this moment, the people around the heaven’s favorite arena who did not enter the arena were shocked when they saw the rankings on the Heaven’s favorite ranking.

The speed of the advancement was simply too fast. In less than half a day, he had risen from the 20th place to the 13th place. One could imagine his strength.

“It’s a pity that the 12th Heaven’s favorite young man is not here!”

When Wang Xian came to the 200-meter-tall 12th arena, he shook his head slightly.

The 12th-ranked Heaven’s pride young man was a woman, Tang Ling ‘er, the Princess of bloodshed empire.

Wang Xian did not care about her identity. After issuing the challenge, he returned to his own arena.

The 13th-ranked Heaven’s pride young man was cultivating on the arena. The increase of spiritual energy had reached four times. To many people, it was considered a pretty good paradise.

Just as Wang Xian was about to continue comprehending the combination of the four attributes, the communication stone plate received long Xiaotian’s message.

“Are you here?”

Wang Xian saw the message and stood up with a smile on his face. His body moved and he flew towards his residence.

He still had some void interpretation level weapons and armor in his hands. There were a total of six of them and none of them had been sold. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Six of them were all above the first level of the void interpretation level. Each of them was worth at least 50 to 60 billion mid-grade spirit stones.

Six of them were worth at least 300 billion mid-grade spirit stones.

Long Xiaotian said that he would help him sell all of these weapons and armors.

He knew that Long Xiaotian wanted to rope him in, so he did not reject him.

He had already considered long Xiaotian as a friend. If he helped him, he would naturally help him as well.

After Wang Xian left the heaven’s pride stage, he took off his mask and black robe. Then, he quickly flew towards his residence.

When he arrived at the pine and Poplar Forest, there were five to six middle-aged elders standing in front of his residence.

Other than the familiar Bai qingsong, Wang Xian had never seen the other five people.

However, Wang Xian could feel a strong energy from them.

This was especially so for the white-haired old man in the middle.

When Wang Xian looked at the old man, the old man was also sizing him up. His eyes were sparkling.

“Brother Wang Xian!”

Long Xiaotian smiled when he saw Wang Xian. He shouted immediately.

Wang Xian nodded with a smile. “Brother Xiaotian, who are these?”

“These are the people from the Guanglong Kingdom. They are some of my elders!”

Long Xiaotian did not introduce them in detail. Wang Xian nodded at the middle-aged elders.

“Come in, everyone. Since brother Xiaotian is the one who introduced me, I will sell the last six weapons and armor to you at a 10% discount on the market price!”

Wang Xian opened the door and said with a smile.

“Haha, Little Brother is really loyal. No Wonder Xiaotian is able to become friends with you!”

An elder laughed out loud as he looked at Wang Xian with a friendly gaze.

“I only make friends with the right people. Brother Xiaotian, you are a good person!”

Wang Xian responded with a smile and led them into the courtyard.

Long Xiaotian was delighted when he heard Wang Xian’s words. He gestured to the elders and followed them in.

“Roar! Roar!”

Seeing Wang Xian’s arrival, Ling Zilin and the blood evil turtle let out low roars and walked over one by one as if they were trying to curry favor with him.

Wang Xian patted their heads and took out their weapons and armor before handing them over to Long Xiaotian.

“Show these weapons to the seniors!”

“Alright!”

Long Xiaotian took them over and passed them to a few middle-aged and old men.

The few of them held them in their hands and looked at them. Satisfaction appeared on their faces.

“Not bad, Xiaotian. pass the spiritual liquid directly to your brother!”

The white-haired old man in the middle looked at it. A satisfied expression appeared on his face and he nodded his head immediately.

“Alright!”

Long Xiaotian smiled and nodded his head. He passed the bottles of spiritual liquid to Wang Xian one by one.
