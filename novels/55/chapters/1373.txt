Chapter 1374: 1374 swept through the four kingdoms

“Impossible, with the strength of the dragon-phoenix dynasty, it’s not on the same level as the three great dynasties, not to mention the Dongyuan dynasty!”

“That’s... That’s the dragon-phoenix Queen, that’s really the dragon-phoenix queen, all the generals of the dragon-phoenix dynasty are here!”

“And that young man... this... could it be, could it be that the young man saved...”

In the manor, Wei chibing’s body was trembling as he looked at the sky.

The familiar figures and their terrifying auras caused disbelief to appear on their faces.

“Kneel down, are you courting death?”

“Boom!”

The generals of the dragon-phoenix Empire looked at the stunned citizens below and revealed an extremely cold expression.

With a wave of their arms, they directly attacked a place below.

Boom

A terrifying explosion sounded out, and the powerful destructive force destroyed everything within a kilometer.

“Kneel down! Hurry up and kneel down!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Plop! Plop! Plop

“Looks like it’s true. Our dynasty went to destroy the dragon and Phoenix dynasty, and in the end, all of our legions were wiped out. Oh My God, we’ve lost!”

“It has nothing to do with us. It has nothing to do with us. Don’t Kill Us!”

The entire Eastern Sea city fell into complete chaos. The citizens immediately knelt down on the ground, their faces filled with terror. Some of them begged for mercy loudly.

“The stewards of the city Lord’s Mansion and the army in Eastern Sea City, come here!”

The cold voice of a general once again covered the entire eastern sea city.

“If you call us again, we...”

Within the manor, the two old men looked at each other and swallowed a mouthful of saliva. Their eyes were filled with terror.

“You have three seconds. If you don’t come out, I’ll kill you!”

The cold voice sounded again, causing the two stewards of the city Lord’s mansion and the ocean cultivator corps to tremble.

“Sir, sir, we’re here, we’re here!”

The two didn’t dare to hide anymore. With their status, they would know after asking around.

They stood up and shouted with trembling voices.

“Eh?”

All the soldiers of the dragon and Phoenix dynasty floated in the sky and looked in that direction.

However, when they saw a familiar figure, they were slightly stunned.

A middle-aged man was still sitting there, and his face looked a little uncertain.

“It’s that traitor, Wei chibing!”

A general looked there in astonishment.

“Wei chibing?”

All the generals and soldiers looked over at the same time.

Mang Hong licked his tongue as he stared at Wei chibing with killing intent in his eyes.

“Boom!”

He didn’t hesitate at all as the huge axe in his hand slashed downwards.

A five meter long dazzling huge axe was aimed at Wei chibing.

“Bastard, I told you to kneel down. Didn’t you hear me? Do You Want to Die?”

A voice filled with killing intent charged towards Wei chibing.

“What?”

Wei chibing’s face was filled with shock as he hurriedly dodged to the side.

“Bang!”

The resplendent huge axe descended, directly creating a huge crater within a hundred meter radius.

“Whoosh!”

However, just as he dodged the huge Axe’s attack, Mang Hong’s figure rushed over. His burly body held the huge axe in his hand as he pointed it at Wei chibing.

“Lord Mang, I kneel, I kneel. Don’t do it, don’t do it!”

Wei chibing knelt on the ground with a face full of fear and begged for mercy loudly.

“Your Majesty, I, Wei chibing, am guilty. I am guilty. Please give me a Chance!”

He raised his head in horror and looked at Feng Luan with an extremely ugly expression.

He never expected that the dragon and Phoenix dynasty would actually destroy all the invaders and counterattack.

“Your Majesty, such a traitor should be killed directly!”

“That’s right. Her Majesty guided him in cultivation and gave him a lot of resources. Now that our dynasty is in trouble, this traitor actually escaped and took a lot of things with him. We absolutely can not let him go!”

Several generals bowed to Feng Luan with cold faces and pleaded.

“Cripple his strength and strip him of all his assets!”

Feng Luan judged him coldly.

“It’s the Queen!”

Below, Mang Hong heard the Queen’s words and stared coldly at Wei chibing. A terrifying killing intent directly covered him.

“No, no... Your Majesty, you can’t do this...”

His terrified voice resounded throughout the entire eastern sea city.

Within the manor, the great nobles of eastern sea city trembled as they looked at Wei chibing in front of them.

This was an expert at the second level of the profound void tier. Right now, he was like an ant that had all of his strength crippled and all of his finances stripped away.

Now that the Star Moon King had been killed and his army destroyed, it meant that the entire dynasty would be taken over by the dragon-phoenix dynasty.

Who would dare to approach a fellow that had been crippled by Her Majesty’s Order in the future?

Not only would he not get close, he might even be killed by someone!

That was because this place would belong to the dragon and Phoenix dynasty in the future!

“No, no...”

Wei chibing’s miserable cry rang out. He felt his strength in despair. His entire body was crippled, completely crippled by Mang Hong.

He regretted it, he regretted it!

If he knew of this ending, he would definitely not betray the dragon and Phoenix dynasty.

If he had not betrayed them and the dragon and Phoenix Dynasty had defeated the four kingdoms, he would have been the hero of a rising dynasty.

He would rule one or even two or three cities, high and mighty...

But now...

His body trembled and he fainted.

Falling from high and mighty to the ground was hard for him to accept.

“The two of you will temporarily take over East Sea city. In ten days, when Her Majesty suppresses the four kingdoms, you will take charge of the city. Everything in the city will remain the same for the time being!”

Feng Luan placed a tinder on the manager of the city Lord’s Mansion and the current leader of the ocean cultivators corps. Yu Chengzi, who was at the side, gave them an order.

“Yes, yes, yes, sir. It’s Her Majesty. We will definitely manage East Sea city well. We don’t dare to have any second thoughts!”

When the Tinder landed in their minds, the two of them were completely under control. Feng Luan sent dozens of soldiers to guard the city before continuing on to the next city!

To avoid any accidents, Wang Xian went with them. One city after another, one dynasty after another.

Those who dared to resist would be suppressed by force.

There were four dynasties and more than 60 cities. The only one who encountered some resistance was the Wind Howl dynasty.

Since the Wind Howl King was not dead, the imperial city had quite a lot of power.

However, with Wang Xian around, the wind howl imperial city was easily captured.

There were large amounts of resources and treasures in the four dynasties.

“Wang Xian, I need to tidy up the land and cities now. I need to be busy for a period of time. In ten days, all the city lords and powerful families in the dragon and Phoenix Dynasty will come to Dragon and Phoenix Imperial city to pay their respects. When the time comes, you can come over if you have nothing to do!”

“I happen to have many treasures for you!”

After sweeping through all the cities in the four nations, Feng Luan could not hide her excitement as she said to Wang Xian.

“Alright, I have to return to the Dragon Palace as well. I have gained a lot this time!”

Wang Xian nodded at Feng Luan with a smile on his face.

“Alright, I will see you in ten days!”

Feng Luan nodded happily.

“Return to the Palace!”

Wang Xian also ordered the nine dragons with a smile.

Destroying the four kingdoms and the corpses of the fifty-five armies and the huge resources in the four kingdoms would allow the strength of the Dragon Palace to increase tremendously!
