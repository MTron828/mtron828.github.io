Translator: 5496903

Ling Jian ‘er was even more astonished when she saw Xiao ha rubbing her head against Wang Xian’s body reluctantly.

A hint of displeasure appeared on her face. After all, Xiao Ha was her pet and her most intimate little guy.

“Xiao Ha, come over quickly!”

Ling Jian ‘er shouted again with an unhappy expression.

“Awoo!”

Xiao ha shouted and ran towards Ling Jian ‘ER.

“HMPH!”

Seeing it running over, Ling Jian ‘er pinched its face with displeasure. She looked at Wang Xian curiously and asked with a straight face, “Why is Xiao Ha so close to you?”

“HMM?”

Wang Xian raised his head and looked at Ling Jian ‘er. He smiled faintly and said, “Because I am a beast tamer. If I want to, I can even make your pet obey my orders!”

“You...”

Ling Jian ‘ER’s expression changed slightly when she heard his words. She frowned and glared at Wang Xian. “Don’t use your beast taming skills on Xiao Ha. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being impolite!”

“I’m Your Savior. Moreover, do you think you’re my opponent?”

Wang Xian smiled nonchalantly when he heard her words.

“Roar!”

“Roar Roar!”

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

Just as Wang Xian finished his sentence, the group of ferocious beasts and demonic beasts in the courtyard started to chirp and looked at her.

Ling Jian ‘er felt waves of aura and her expression changed slightly. Her gaze swept across the group of ferocious beasts and demonic beasts.

Compared to the last time, there were many more ferocious beasts and demonic beasts.

This was especially so for the three-meter-long bloody evil turtle that was filled with a bloody evil aura.

“It’s at the void interpretation level again...”

Her pupils constricted.

“Awoo, awoo!”

Xiao Ha, who was on her shoulder, instead barked at the group of Demonic Beasts.

“Ji Ji, Ji Ji!”

A few little Yan monkeys jumped to the bottom of the wall and barked at Xiao Ha. Their golden eyes stared at it.

“Little Yan monkeys with half-step void interpretation bloodline!”

She looked at these monkeys and was slightly surprised.

“Eh?”

When she looked at the demonic beasts and ferocious beasts in the courtyard, her eyes suddenly lit up. She stared at the one-meter-sized small tree beside Wang Xian.

The small tree was one meter-sized and had golden leaves. The entire small tree emitted a strong metal attribute.

It emitted a golden glow and covered an area of two to three meters.

“Golden Lotus tree! It’s actually a golden lotus tree!”

Her eyes flickered as she recalled the precious inheritance she had obtained. “Are you selling that Golden Lotus Tree of yours?”

She hesitated for a moment before asking Wang Xian.

“Come in and tell me if you have something to say. Don’t stand on the wall of my house. If you don’t know, I would think that you’re a thief!”

Wang Xian glanced at her and said indifferently.

Ling Jian ‘ER’s expression changed slightly. She moved and landed coldly in the courtyard. She stared at the golden lotus tree and asked, “Are you selling it?”

“Yes, I’m selling everything in the entire courtyard, except for the spiritual Zilin and the blood evil Turtle!”

Wang Xian looked at her and gestured to the chair at the side.

Ling Jian ‘er stood there without moving. “How much spiritual liquid? Name a price.”

“I haven’t thought about it yet. When my grocery store is open for business, I’ll list the price then!”

Wang Xian smiled. Looking at the signboard that he had made, a satisfied expression appeared on his face.

“Grocery store?”

Ling Jian ‘er looked at him in confusion.

“Yes, grocery store. It’s my store. I need to make some arrangements now. If you want to buy it, you can go to my store tomorrow. There might be things you need in there!”

Wang Xian stood up and said to her directly.

“Where is your grocery store?”

Ling Jian ‘er quickly asked.

“I can’t really describe the exact location. It’s the first day of business tomorrow. I need to go and arrange it now!”

Wang Xian thought for a moment and shook his head. He kept the signboard and some metal materials into his space.

“Keep the Golden Lotus Tree for me. I’ll go and Buy It Tomorrow!”

Ling Jian ‘er said to Wang Xian.

“Sure!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“Okay!”

She took a glance at Wang Xian and flew back to her own place.

“Hehe, a golden lotus tree at the first level of the void interpretation realm can be sold at a good price. This girl is a rich lady!”

Wang Xian watched her disappear and revealed a smile on his face. He put away all the items and placed the group of demonic beasts into his storage spiritual bag. Then, he flew directly to the shop.

When he arrived at the shop, there were a lot of people around him even at night.

Wang Xian looked at the shop’s door and waved his arm. He placed the brand of the Dragon and Phoenix grocery store on it. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

His shop was not eye-catching. It was even more insignificant when placed in the middle of the bustling human cemetery.

The words “Grocery store”seemed to be of a lower class as well.

Wang Xian did not pay much attention to it and walked straight into the shop.

The entire shop was extremely clean and tidy. For an expert, all he needed to do was to use a little energy to clean up all the dirt.

“Set up a beast pen here to sell pets. Sell weapons here, armor here, hidden weapons here, and so on. As for the formation here, there are also a few pet eggs.”

Wang Xian sorted out the items one by one. On the second floor, he sold items of the insightful void tier.

When Wang Xian displayed the items in his interspatial ring one by one, the entire shop became even more chaotic.

A few demonic beasts and ferocious beasts were shouting.

Weapons, spears, clubs, and weapons were hanging haphazardly.

“Forget it, let’s just leave it at that. I still have a lot of metal materials in my hands. I’ll forge some weapons and armor sets!”

Wang Xian took a look around and walked to the back. He placed the blood evil turtle and the spirit purple qilin in the storage spiritual bag at the back and treated them as divine beasts.

If someone came to cause trouble, he could just let the two of them go.

Wang Xian thought about it and came to the third floor. The third floor was a place that he specially used to forge weapons and armor.

He took out the materials one by one and started to forge them immediately.

The night passed quickly. The Sky was bright. Wang Xian took a look at the weapons, armor, and battle boots that he had crafted. He took them downstairs and placed them on the floor.

“Open for business!”

He revealed a faint smile and opened the door of the shop.

“Senior brother Yin, look... it’s him, it’s that guy!”

When Wang Xian opened the door of the shop, a young man pointed at Wang Xian at a spot not far from the street. He quickly said to Yin Xianfeng who was beside him.

“I’ve been looking for this fellow for half a month. I’ve finally found him. I’ve finally found him!”

Yin Xianfeng turned his head and looked over. His eyes were filled with killing intent as he clenched his fists tightly.

His severed arm had already recovered. His eyes were filled with hatred and killing intent.

“Senior brother Yin, don’t be rash. His strength... His strength...”

The young man beside Yin Xianfeng hurriedly reminded him. They knew very well that the other party’s strength was not something they could provoke.

“I know!”

Yin Xianfeng calmed down slightly. He looked at the shop and slowly opened his mouth.

“Back then, you crippled my arm and embarrassed me. In order to take revenge, I sacrificed a lot. Next, I will let you know the consequences of provoking me!”

His eyes flickered with a cold light as he flew directly towards the island of the Light Dragon Dynasty.
