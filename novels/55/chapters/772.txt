Translator: 549690339

“Brother, are there any disciples from the Dragon Gate participating in this prodigy competition? If the Golden Swordfish clan were to participate, they would definitely be able to sweep through all the immortal sects!”

On a single mountain peak, ancient buildings were built on top of the mountain peak. They were filled with an immortal aura.

This was the welcoming peak of the Xuanyuan clan. It was specially prepared for the people from the immortal sects.

Xiao Yu looked around and asked Wang Xian with a smile.

“No, there’s no need to earn these things. If you want to participate in the competition, I can directly report your name.”

“It’s a little difficult for the Golden Swordfish clan to sweep the competition.”

Wang Xian smiled and shook his head. He wasn’t planning to send his disciples to participate. It wasn’t meaningful to the Dragon Gate.

During the competition, he would lead a group of Dragon Gate members to watch the competition from the viewing platform of the immortal gate.

At that time, their strength would naturally be seen by all the immortal sects. Naturally, they would be able to serve as a deterrent.

There was no need for the Dragon Gate members to participate in the competition.

Furthermore, among the Dragon Gate members, those under the age of forty were at the infant stage. It would be difficult for them to get first place or even the top three.

The disciples of the immortal gate were not jealous, especially the most talented ones.

Take Feng Lingtian for example. His strength was not bad. When Xiao Yu had not reached the half-step immortal God realm, it was difficult for him to defeat him.

The current members of the Dragon Gate were not as strong as Xiao Yu.

After all, the strength of the bone dragon was not something that the DRAKONIDS could match.

Unless Wang Xian called the Golden Swordfish clan over.

Participating in the Prodigy competition would be an age test. Using the array compass, one would be able to determine how long a person had lived. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The lifespan of the Golden Swordfish was mostly 20 to 30 years. Even ao Jian was only over 50 years old.

The Golden Swordfish clan had two half-step immortal deity disciples and 68 infant realm experts.

If they were to come, they could not guarantee that they could sweep all the prodigies. However, it should not be a problem to sweep 90% of them.

However, there was no need for them to come. It was better to let them cultivate in the dragon palace

“I’m not going to participate. At most, I’ll be a little stronger than Feng Lingtian. Going there is simply a torture for Noobs!”

Xiao Yu curled her lips and said with some disdain.

Now, her strength was almost comparable to that of an immortal god. None of the Heaven’s favorites would be a match for her.

“Let’s just take a look at the strength of the immortal sect and the Heaven’s favorites. Let’s just treat it as a vacation.”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Xuanyuan Qingyuan from the Xuanyuan clan. Xuanyuan Fenghua is here to pay a visit to the Dragon King!”

At this moment, a middle-aged voice came from outside.

Wang Xian’s heart skipped a beat. Sensing the two immortals outside, he smiled and said, “Brothers, please come in.”

“Haha, Dragon King, we have brought some spirit wine that is unique to the Xuan Yuan clan. Let’s have a drink with you!”

The two immortals from the Xuan Yuan clan were the two who came to deliver the invitation last time.

They had received some benefits from Wang Xian. It was only right for them to come over to entertain him this time.

Wang Xian smiled and welcomed them into the hall.

The few of them sat at the table and started chatting with some spirit dishes and the immortal wine that was unique to the Xuan Yuan clan.

After having a meal with them, Wang Xian had a more detailed understanding of the twenty immortal sects.

Currently, the Xuan Yuan clan was acknowledged to be the strongest, followed by the Yuwen clan, followed by the Wild Beast Immortal sect.

After that, the two immortal sects, Holy Medicine and holy doctor, would join forces. This was because these two immortal sects were basically indistinguishable from each other.

Behind them were the true Martial Immortal Academy and the Strange Thorn clan.

However, this was only the ranking on the surface. This was because the two immortal sects, Holy Medicine and holy doctor, occupied the same cauldron.

If they hid their strength, no one else would know.

It was also unknown whether the other immortal sects had hidden their strength.

Currently, there were three upper gods in the immortal sects on the surface. It was unknown whether they would still exist in the dark.

Xuanyuan Qingyuan and the others would also not tell Wang Xian about their immortal sect’s trump card.

After a meal, they gained some understanding of the strength of the twenty immortal sects.

For the Heaven’s favorites of the immortal sects, this competition was a chance to show off their strength and make a name for themselves.

For the Immortals, it was a chance to learn more about the strength of the other immortal sects as well as the potential of their disciples.

It was also a chance to show off the strength of their disciples.

After all, the immortals forbade fighting now. The strength of the disciples of the immortal sects was the key combat strength of an immortal sect.

“Dragon King, the selection of the disciples of the immortal sects will begin at nine o’clock tomorrow. The competition will last for three days, and the final day will decide the winner!”

“This time, not only twenty disciples of the immortal sects will participate in the competition. In every world of the tripod, there are not only the immortal sects, but also some small forces and small clans. If the disciples of those small forces and small clans are outstanding, the immortal sects can throw out an olive branch!”

“Tomorrow at Nine o’clock, all the immortals from the immortal sects will come to Xuanyuan peak of the Xuan Yuan clan to hand over the reward items to us first. We will place them on the Heaven’s pride stage. In addition, we can also meet them in advance!”

Before leaving, Xuanyuan Qingyuan and Xuanyuan Fenghua reminded Wang Xian.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded and sent them off.

“I will meet the immortals from the immortal sects tomorrow!”

After sending the two of them away, the corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly.

Among the twenty immortal sects, there should be no less than forty immortals coming this time.

They were practically the pillars of the entire jianghu and were the strongest.

Outside, the immortal sects came to their respective mountain peaks. For this grand competition, not a single immortal sect would be absent.

Some of the disciples from the immortal sects came in the thousands, at least four to five hundred people.

The Dragon Gate was considered a very small number.

However, in terms of the number of powerhouses, the infant stage powerhouses from the Dragon Gate could definitely be ranked in the top three.

Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue, and Xiaoyu, the six girls, stood on the peak and read the posts gossiping about the heaven’s favorites from the immortal sects. They were chatting very enthusiastically.

Wang Xian walked up and smiled faintly. He looked around.

Heaven’s favorite disciple?

A genius that only appears once in ten thousand years?

The strongest person among the disciples of the immortal sects?

In front of him, he was already Yun Yan. He was already standing at an even higher position. Those Heaven’s favorites who were older than him were merely a junior.

Their heights were no longer the same. Wang Xian no longer had the towering presence that he had when competing with the Heaven’s favorites.

“Dong Dong Dong!”

The next morning, around 8:40 am, the bell rang.

“Please follow me to the battleground, Dragon Gate disciples. Please follow me to Xuanyuan Peak!”

A disciple of the Xuanyuan clan came to the foot of the mountain peak and said loudly.

“Xiao Yu, Qing Yue, Ling Xiu, you guys go to the Battleground First!”

“Shu Qing, Ao Jian, let’s go to Xuanyuan Peak!”

Wang Xian said to them. The five girls nodded and led a group of Dragon Gate members to follow the Xuanyuan clan disciples to the battleground.

Wang Xian and Guan Shuqing ao Jian flew towards the Xuan Yuan Peak.

The Xuan Yuan Peak was the largest peak of the Xuan Yuan clan. The peak towered into the clouds and reached four to five thousand meters tall.

The peak of the Xuan Yuan Peak was called the immortal stage. It was located in the Clouds and mist and was mysterious and ethereal.

“Ming Wang Immortal Sect!”

“Holy Medicine Immortal Sect, Holy Doctor Immortal Sect!”

“True Martial Immortal Academy!”

In mid-air, Wang Xian heard voices coming from the immortal stage.

Wang Xian raised his head slightly and a faint aura emanated from his body.

“Dragon Gate!”
