Chapter 1086: 1087 guarded the city by himself

Translator: 5496903

“Since the Thorn Wood Devil has been destroyed, everyone should return to the bottom of the city wall to rest. Consume the pills immediately. All the support that can alleviate fatigue should be given to the Warriors!”

“The ferocious beasts are approaching from behind. Everyone, be prepared. Don’t let your guard down!”

“The further you go, the stronger the ferocious beasts are and the faster their attack speed will be. It will be much more difficult for me to save all of you. No one can let their guard down. Otherwise, death will await all of You!”

Wang Xian stood in the sky and looked at the thorny wood demon who was about to be killed. He told everyone.

“Yes!”

The group of people who were fighting in front of them had an excited look on their faces.

After witnessing Wang Xian’s strength, all of them responded respectfully. They immediately came to the bottom of the city wall and started to recover.

A group of people who were supporting them released water energy, light energy, and wood energy to relieve their fatigue and help them recover.

In addition, with the help of elixirs, the group of people who had only fought for more than ten minutes could recover very quickly.

However, Wang Xian was not optimistic. The Impala Demon was just the beginning.

Looking into the distance, Wang Xian narrowed his eyes.

A group of blood-red figures appeared in the distance. Their blood-red bodies were slightly decomposed, and one could see fresh blood flowing outside.

Wang Xian revealed an astonished expression.

“Blood Shadow Walker!”

His pupils constricted slightly.

Wang Xian only found out about blood shadow Walker after he had a better understanding of blood barbarian demonic beasts.

Blood Shadow Walker was equivalent to weaker blood barbarian demonic beasts. These blood shadow walkers could absorb fresh blood to greatly enhance their strength.

In other words, when they fought in pools of blood, they could greatly enhance their recovery ability and were extremely difficult to deal with.

However, these blood shadow walkers were extremely rare. Unexpectedly, there were about 70,000 to 80,000 of them on the battlefield.

“Behind them, there are blood savage beasts controlling them. One, two, three... five of them. All of them are at transcendent level nine!”

Wang Xian looked over and mumbled, “Other than the five blood savage beasts at transcendent level nine, there should be more than ten blood shadow walkers at transcendent level eight!”

There were also 20 to 30 level seven blood shadow walkers, and hundreds of level six blood shadow walkers.

Their strength was too terrifying!

“If it weren’t for me, it would be impossible to defend with the strength of Shenghai Town. However, the position of the north gate is not the main battlefield. The most aggressive one is the east gate. What kind of terrifying ferocious beasts and demonic beasts would be at the East Gate?”

Wang Xian thought to himself. However, he shook his head immediately. His main objective was to hunt for ferocious beasts. If he could collect all the corpses of these blood shadow walkers, he would have profited greatly this time.

“The people who came to attack the city this time will be very strong. There will be nine transcendents at level five, 15 at level eight, 31 at level seven, and more than 200 at level six!”

Wang Xian’s voice spread across a radius of a few kilometers.

When everyone heard this number, their faces turned pale.

Even Jin Qianyuan was slightly stunned. A look of despair appeared on his face.

“No... No Way. This is clearly not the main battlefield. How could there be such a terrifying ferocious beast here!”

“It’s over, it’s over. Oh My God, our holy sea town is completely finished!”

In an instant, everyone’s faces were filled with panic and despair.

Those ordinary people in holy sea town who hadn’t even reached the transcendence level instantly felt their vision go black and their hearts were filled with fear.

Their strength hadn’t reached the transcendence level yet. It would be difficult for them to escape.

“We can fight!”

When Wang Xian sensed the despair on the faces of the people behind him, he raised his eyebrows slightly and spoke with fighting spirit.

We can fight!

It was only two words, but his tone was filled with strong confidence.

Everyone was slightly stunned. They looked at Wang Xian hurriedly with excitement in their eyes.

Wang Xian held the lightning strike wood in his hand. An azure dragon slowly emerged from the lightning strike wood and circled around his body.

In everyone’s eyes, this scene was akin to a god descending to save them!

“We can fight! Commander Wang said we can fight!”

“Fight! Commander Wang could have escaped, but he still stayed here. If he said he can fight, he will definitely fight!”

“Fight, fight, Fight!”

Everyone had excited expressions on their faces as they roared loudly.

For a moment, everyone on the city wall roared loudly with their faces flushed red.

Stand in battle formation!

Their voices resounded throughout the world!

This was the power that Wang Xian had brought them!

“The Blood Shadow Walker has arrived. This time, the opponent is very strong. Everyone, don’t split up. Look after each other and cooperate with each other. This time, I Can’t save all of you anymore!”

“Next, I will launch the first wave of attacks. All of you follow closely behind!”

Wang Xian shouted softly and moved his body. He floated thousands of meters in front of him and stood there.

Eleven Golden Swordfish stood at the side, waiting for the arrival of the blood shadow walkers.

“Get Ready!”

Jin Qianyuan’s eyes revealed a determined look. He moved his body and flew down.

“Mayor, your injuries haven’t healed yet!”

The President of the hiring association saw Jin Qianyuan flying over. His expression changed slightly and he said hurriedly.

“If we don’t fight now, when Will We Wait?”

Jin Qianyuan’s face was filled with fighting spirit. He stood in front of the group of warriors and shouted, “Fight!”

“Fight!”

The people of Holy Sea town behind him were also filled with excitement. They knew that the mayor was severely injured. Now that he was able to fight alongside them, everyone was touched.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian, who was floating in the sky, smiled faintly. If they couldn’t expose the dragon thorns, they would be able to kill all the 70,000 to 80,000 blood shadow walkers by themselves.

“However, even if the strange demon doesn’t make a move, they can still fight!”

Wang Xian revealed a confident expression. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The blood shadow walkers let out roars that shook the sky. Coupled with their terrifying bodies, everyone felt a chill in their hearts.

At the back, five blood savage demonic beasts were hiding among them, controlling them.

Seventy to eighty thousand blood shadow strollers stared coldly in the direction of holy sea town, carrying the smell of blood as they quickly walked over.

They stepped on the thorny wood devil’s corpse and blood, which made them even more excited.

At this moment, everyone on the city wall held their breaths, staring at the fierce beasts charging at them.

Everyone clenched their teeth and held their weapons tightly.

“The wood world has descended!”

“Spirit Enchantment!”

At this moment, Wang Xian’s voice rang out.

The lightning struck wood in his hand emitted a dazzling bluish-green glow. The glow enveloped the dark sky.

Buzz

He unleashed his full strength. Within a radius of 2,000 meters, trees that were a hundred meters tall appeared out of thin air.

There were over 1,000 trees, and every one of them was a towering tree.

Under everyone’s gazes, those trees seemed to open their eyes and come to life.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

They released a terrifying might as they directly faced 70,000 to 80,000 blood shadow strollers.

“What kind of divine ability is this? It’s so terrifying!”

“Commander Wang is trying to block an army of 10,000 horses by himself!”

“Block an entire city by himself!”
