“Dragon King, we have received news that the floating island was taken away by the celestial sect of puppets!”

In Jiang City University, Wang Xian walked towards the first-grade pavilion after school at noon. Beside him, Mo Qinglong reported to him.

“Okay, I’ll go and get it back tomorrow!”

Wang Xian nodded. He went to the shop and looked around. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The first-grade pavilion was no longer open for business today. As for manager Huang, he had handed him over to Elder Qin to handle. As for ordinary people, he had to go through legal means.

With the conclusive evidence, one could imagine the consequences.

In addition, the employees of the first-grade pavilion were all sent back after giving them a sum of money.

Wang Xian got devil azure dragon to start modifying the first-grade pavilion and turning it into the Divine Dragon Smelting Workshop.

“Dragon King, this is the information of all the martial artists from the aristocratic families in the martial arts world.”

In the afternoon, Mo Qinglong handed over another set of information. Wang Xian sized it up.

“Okay, call all the Dragonmen. Ao Jian, Ao Yao, and the rest of them will come as well!”

Wang Xian looked at the time and headed towards the Xianyang Hotel in advance.

The entire hotel had been cleared out today. When he arrived, Elder Qin and elder Xue were waiting at the door.

“Little brother Wang Xian, please come in!”

The two of them welcomed Wang Xian in with smiles on their faces. The three of them headed upstairs.

“Things have changed, but people have changed!”

The three of them sat in front of a table and sighed slightly.

Back then, Wang Xian and elder Qin and elder Xue had formed an alliance. Now, nearly two years had passed, and everything had undergone a huge change.

“Little brother Wang Xian, your return will definitely stir up a storm!”

Old Xue said to Wang Xian with a smile on his face.

“The Sea of jianghu is much bigger and much deeper. Old Xue and Old Qin, are you sure that I can stir it up?”

Wang Xian was full of smiles as he spoke to them with a deeper meaning in his words.

“In our opinion, there is no sea that the dragon king can not stir up. Come, come, welcome the Dragon King back to the sea!”

Old Qin and Old Xue laughed out loud as they raised the wine glasses in their hands.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian understood what they meant and felt a little relieved.

It seemed that there were still people who believed in him in Jiang city.

“It has been more than a year and many things have changed. Little brother Wang Xian, you must be mentally prepared for today’s Banquet!”

Elder Qin said to Wang Xian slowly.

“Don’t worry. I want to see how much Jiang city has changed!”

Wang Xian smiled nonchalantly.

Time passed slowly. Now that elder Xue and his son and grandson had joined the Ming Wang Immortal Sect, elder Xue came over to express his stance.

Wang Xian also knew that the world had changed. The martial artists of the aristocratic families in Jiang city belonged to the Ming Wang Immortal sect and the puppet immortal sect.

It was obviously impossible for them to betray the immortal sect and submit to him with a wave of his hand.

The reason why Wang Xian set up the Dragon Gate banquet today was not because he wanted everyone in Jiang City to regard him as their king.

Instead, he wanted to announce that he was back.

No matter whose territory Jiang city was in the future, do not provoke me.

Wang Xian did not have any intention of contending for hegemony in the martial arts world. His territory was the sea. As long as he developed the sea well, he did not place much importance on a piece of land.

He was a little annoyed to see people from the Mingwang Immortal sect and the puppet immortal sect jumping around in front of him one after another.

Although they were just ants, it was annoying to have too many ants.

Today was a rather lively day for the entire Jiang City.

The Dragon King Banquet!

The Dragon King was back.

At the Xianyang Hotel, luxurious cars were parked at the entrance at about seven o’clock in the evening.

A warrior with a high status in Jiang City walked into the Xianyang Hotel.

He walked into the hall, looked around at some familiar people, greeted each other, and then surrounded them.

“I didn’t expect the Dragon King to come back after more than a year!”

“Dragon Gate banquet. I don’t know what this Dragon King is going to do. Now we have all joined the immortal sect!”

“Who knows? He is hosting a banquet for all the martial artists in Jiang City. I wonder what kind of lawsuit the Dragon King is trying to sell!”

“I heard yesterday that the Dragon King humiliated Mu Zidao and Ming Feng of our immortal sect. They are core disciples of the immortal sect. This Dragon King is as fearless as ever!”

“The Dragon sect is also a powerful force. Although it is not an immortal sect, it is not something we can provoke. Let’s just watch today!”

“I say that the dragon king provoked the core disciples of the Ming Wang Immortal Gate as soon as he returned to Jiang City. He’s obviously looking for trouble. Things are different now. This Dragon King is too arrogant!”

Some warriors whispered to each other as they rode the stairs and headed upstairs.

The world had changed. The Dragon King, who had once made everyone in the jianghu submit to him, had completely lost his reverence with the appearance of the immortal gate.

Some people even mocked the dragon king, while some people’s eyes sparkled and were filled with coldness.

In the jianghu, there had been many warriors who hated the Dragon King for chasing them out of the spiritual waterfall.

A group of people walked inside. The warriors from the aristocratic families who were familiar with each other gathered together with the warriors from the gate of immortality and came to the banquet hall.

Tables and chairs were placed in the hall. The warriors from the aristocratic families of Jiang City looked around and found that the members of the Dragon Gate and the Dragon King had not arrived.

They found a seat and sat down.

At half past seven, all the Warriors of Jiang City had arrived, and the hall was almost full.

At first, they sat there in silence and waited, but as time passed, some people began to talk in low voices.

At eight o’clock, the members of the Dragon Gate and the Dragon King still had not appeared.

This made some people look impatient.

“Where’s the Dragon King? He asked us to come at seven thirty. It’s already eight o’clock. Why isn’t he here yet?”

“Yeah, we’ve been waiting here for half an hour. Why isn’t he here yet?”

The two middle-aged men frowned and said in a deep voice.

His voice was not soft, so everyone could hear him clearly.

“Are you deliberately ignoring us? It’s been half an hour, and you still haven’t come over. We are not the subordinates of the Dragon Gate, and we are not the Dragon King’s World Now!”

A middle-aged man suddenly stood up and said loudly.

“If you still don’t come out, we will leave. Do you want to put on airs or show us your might? The Dragon King and the Dragon Gate are quite powerful, but no matter how powerful they are, they can’t control us. We came here today to give him face and really take ourselves seriously!”

An old man gently patted the table.

“That’s right. If he doesn’t come soon, we’ll leave. The Immortal sect still has a mission to deal with!”

A fat middle-aged man said with a smile.

Although their strength was only at the Xiantian realm, they were really not afraid of the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate now. With the immortal sect behind them, what could the Dragon King do to them?

Some of the other martial artists also showed a hint of impatience in their eyes.

“Sorry, I’m Late!”

At this moment, Wang Xian, who had been in another room, came to the entrance of the banquet hall. Behind him were a group of Dragon Gate Disciples!
