Chapter 341: The Appalling Yellow River

“How is this possible!”

As the middle-aged man in uniform left with Wang Xian, Bian Yaoquan stood in the same spot with full and round eyes. Those eyes were filled with utter disbelief as he stared at their backs.

He clenched his fist. To think he was the most talented and outstanding disciple of Medical Saint Sect; a Level 3 alchemist at age 30. He had been told that he was a rare genius.

His parents had even told him that he would be the most attention-grabbing genius as soon as he walked out of Medical Saint Sect. He was unrivaled in the younger generation.

Yet, he had received blows one after another today.

In particular from someone who actually knew Art of Refining Elixir Pills, and was so proficient in it. His incredible refining speed and one hundred percent success rate were totally unbelievable.

How could a factionless doctor be so dominating?

Bian Yaoquan was totally stupefied. This blow was extremely harsh for someone who was prideful.

“Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown must have met a good opportunity. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to achieve such a formidable stage at age 20 with proficient medical skills and Art of Refining Elixir Pills!” an Inborn Expert could not help but exclaim.

“A Miracle Doctor who is only 20, ranked ninth on the chart. This is already shocking. Who could have thought that he is such a powerful alchemist? Miracle Doctor Wang has unlimited potential!”

“He’s great. No wonder I heard that Miracle Doctor Wang is strong in his networking with several Inborn Experts helping him. He’s actually a powerful alchemist!”

A few experts were discussing in whispers. Some of the surrounding young men and middle-aged men were looking at Wang Xian with faces full of envy.

How could someone be so outstanding?

“Good opportunity?”

The elder from Sacred Followers Guild stood by the side with radiance flickering in his eyes. He squinted his eyes slightly with a glimmer of greed flashing in them.

At the same time, a few experts were deep in thought.

“Young Master!”

The Poison Duo walked to Bian Yaoquan and called out softly. The three of them headed out.

An innocent man gets into trouble because of his wealth.

Wang Xian, a rogue cultivator, did not know that people speculated he could have obtained a great possession because of his performance just now.

Somebody was up to no good now.

“Phew, it’s all done!”

Wang Xian had finally refined a total of 330 pills at night.

There was an extra thirty pills.

“Chief, here!”

Wang Xian walked out of the tent and saw the middle-aged man in uniform waiting for him at the door. He smiled and tossed the bag of elixir pills to him.

“Here’s 300 of them. I’m keeping some of the extras,” Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Hur?” The middle-aged man was slightly taken aback, but soon, he was thrilled. He cast a glance at the elixir pills in the bottle with excitement in his eyes.

“300 was already beyond our expectations. We would be satisfied even if you gave us 200!”

The middle-aged man in uniform smiled, but he was hesitant as he looked at Wang Xian. With a grin, he asked, “Miracle Doctor Wang, are you interested in joining us? I guarantee you that the remuneration would be more than you expect!”

“Sorry, I’m used to being solo.”

Wang Xian shook his head and declined.

“If that’s the case, we’ll not insist on it. I hope we can work together again in the future!”

The middle-aged man in uniform stretched out his hand and replied with a smile.

“Sure!” Wang Xian beamed. Working with the state would benefit him greatly, after all.

“Miracle Doctor Wang, let me take you to your resting place. We’ll be entering the zone tomorrow morning,” said the middle-aged man in uniform as he looked ahead.

The pitch-black darkness in front looked like an enormous devouring monster at night.

Wang Xian cast his gaze and narrowed his eyes slightly.

When he was back in the tent that he was residing place, someone sent food over. Not long later, Sun Lingxiu and Miracle Doctor Blood Man walked in.

“Xiao Xian!”

Sun Lingxiu sat beside him with a beaming face.

“How did it go, Lingxiu? Did you make any discoveries?” asked Wang Xian to Sun Lingxiu.

“No, I don’t specialize in this!”

Sun Lingxiu shook her head slowly as she turned to Miracle Doctor Blood Man.

“Master, there is an appalling bloodline power in them. We must watch our back tomorrow!” Miracle Doctor Blood Man answered with a stern-looking face.

Upon hearing his words, Wang Xian was even more certain about his speculation. “Yes, let’s be careful. There must be some domineering things inside. But of course, there’s a chance that it’s dead. Otherwise, the other creatures would not have mutated!”

Wang Xian guessed that the domineering existence with a daunting bloodline must be dead. When other living creatures fed on its body and blood, they mutated and evolved.

“Okay!”

Sun Lingxiu nodded. They went on to chat a little longer before they turned in.

Wang Xian walked out of his tent and gazed ahead. He hesitated and called off the idea of scouting alone at night.

The next morning, everyone gathered at the same place after breakfast.

Approximately 150 people gathered with 20 Inborn Experts, the weakest ones being Level 8 Martial Artists.

“Today we’re going to investigate the situation inside the zone. It’s going to be dangerous. Please watch out. Before that, please have a Blood Cleansing Pill each!”

The middle-aged man in uniform from yesterday stood in front of the group and spoke while looking at them.

They nodded and took a Blood Cleansing Pill from the soldiers.

Glances were cast at Wang Xian as he had really refined 300 elixir pills. His Art of Refining Elixir Pills was formidable. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Let’s go. If you meet any danger, stay united and work together!” said the middle-aged man in uniform as he led the group inside.

The group followed behind him, passing through the electric fence.

They came to flat land at this time. One could look far in just a glance with houses vaguely visible in the distance.

There was nothing unusual around the grassland. Everyone was looking around without looking tense.

Given the strength of this group, it was almost comparable to a weak Sacred Sect. Hence, it was a piece of cake having to deal with some Level 7 or 8 creatures.

The group sped up as they continued walking. According to the investigation done by the middle-aged man in uniform, those mutated creatures were likely coming from the Yellow River.

The first thing they had to do was to check the tributary, spanning ten kilometers long and 1,000 meters wide.

The soil was not swampy, but the grass was almost up to their knees.

“Watch your step!” an Inborn Expert suddenly shouted.

All of them were surprised to see a daunting leech heading toward a Miracle Doctor for a bite with its enormous teeth.

Swish!

A sword came in a flash, slaying the leech and cutting it in half.

“Be careful. They can remain hidden in the grass very well with their small sizes. Those who are not Inborn Experts yet must pay extra attention.”

The middle-aged man in uniform made a reminder again.

In the past, he had already lost thousands of soldiers in this patch of grassland.

However, it should be slightly easier with all these experts around.

Croak!

Just then, a rapid and coarse croaking sound was heard from far off, stunning everyone!
