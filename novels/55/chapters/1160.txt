Chapter 1161: 1162. Let’s see who goes crazy

Translator: 5496903

“Bright Moon City, isn’t it that I can do whatever I want?”

In the pavilion of Tingxie Lake, the third prince looked at the people around him who stood up and angrily criticized him. He suddenly laughed.

He smiled and swept his gaze across everyone with a ferocious expression.

“Let me tell you, in Bright Moon City, I can do whatever I want. I’m warning you, do you believe that I will kill all of you? !”

He swept his gaze over everyone with some arrogance as he roared arrogantly.

He indeed had the capital and qualifications to do so.

As the third Prince of star-moon kingdom, the entire star-moon kingdom belonged to their royal family. Bright Moon City also belonged to their family.

In Bright Moon City, not to mention how many people he had killed, even if he had killed hundreds or thousands of people, no one would be able to do anything to him?

“Arrogant, simply arrogant to the extreme!”

“I don’t believe that you, even in Bright Moon City, don’t care about the rules of star-moon kingdom. If you dare to be presumptuous again, even if you have a great background, you won’t be able to save yourself!”

When the crowd saw his arrogant appearance, they became even more furious.

This was too arrogant. He actually dared to say that he could do whatever he wanted in bright moon city.

Even if your father was a void interpretation expert, he couldn’t be so arrogant, right.

Even if your father was the city lord, he still had to take into consideration.

After all, this was Bright Moon City, Star Moon Kingdom, and not your world.

“Shut up. If you dare to utter another word of nonsense in front of the third Prince’s Palace, all of you, including your family members, will die!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

At this moment, the aura of the middle-aged man trembled. In an instant, the aura of a rank 9 transcendent enveloped everyone around him.

“What? What a terrifying aura!”

“Third Prince? Third Prince?”

“This... how can this be, he... Third Prince?”

When everyone heard the middle-aged man’s words and felt his aura, their faces changed drastically and turned pale.

Their eyes widened, and they were filled with disbelief. Traces of cold sweat appeared on their foreheads.

Everyone had terrified expressions on their faces as they stared blankly at the third prince.

“HMPH, a bunch of lowly peasants. They’re really courting death!”

The third prince looked at the surrounding people’s expressions and raised his head in disdain as he spoke arrogantly.

“Your... Your Highness, it’s our fault. We were blind. We Beg you to let us off!”

A young man’s face was extremely pale. With a plop, he knelt on the ground and begged for mercy loudly.

“Plop!”

“Plop!”

...

Following that, the sounds of kneeling could be heard. Everyone’s faces were extremely pale.

They had never imagined that this young man would actually be a prince.

This was a prince!

In this world where the strong ruled, a single word from the royal family of star-moon kingdom could decide the life and death of countless people.

Although they were considered pretty good in bright moon city, as long as the third Prince said a word, they would be immediately killed, and even their families would be destroyed.

They finally understood why he was so arrogant, daring to say that he could do whatever he wanted in Bright Moon City!

Indeed, Bright Moon city was like the back garden of the royal family. The third prince was equivalent to their young master, their young master!

Everyone’s faces were pale as they begged for mercy in fear.

“All of you, Scram! I’m so annoyed to see all of you!”

The third Prince said directly with a face full of impatience.

“Yes, yes!”

Everyone in the surroundings heaved a sigh of relief and quickly stood up one by one.

“I said get lost, who told you to stand up!”

At this moment, the third Prince’s voice suddenly rang out. Upon hearing his words, everyone’s expression changed slightly.

Get lost. They were rolling out instead of walking out.

“Yes, yes!”

They didn’t dare to resist at all. All of them lowered their heads and rolled out. It was the same even for the girls.

“Eh? Why aren’t you sending this damn beast to the kitchen? Make a dish for me!”

At this moment, the third prince turned his head and saw Wang Xian and Feng Luan still sitting there. He shouted coldly with a sullen face.

“Let’s go back!”

Wang Xian looked at Feng Luan expressionlessly and said to her.

“Alright!”

Feng Luan nodded her head and picked up the ice fire civet cat. The two of them ignored the third prince.

“You’re courting death!”

When the third prince saw that Wang Xian and Feng Luan were ignoring him, his eyes were filled with killing intent. He moved his arm and a golden sword ray slashed towards them.

“HMPH!”

Feng Luan snorted coldly and the sword ray that was attacking them collapsed in the air.

“Your Highness, be careful!”

When the middle-aged man saw this scene, his expression changed drastically. He immediately stood in front of the third prince and stared at Feng Luan with a grave expression.

The third Prince’s expression changed slightly as well. He was also extremely surprised when Feng Luan’s cold snort broke his attack.

After all, he was the third Prince and had a good education. The reason why he was in a bad mood these few days was mainly because the throne that he had obtained had slipped away from his eyes. This made him extremely unwilling.

He stared at Feng Luan in bewilderment.

“Your Highness, I’m kind enough to remind you not to be too arrogant. If you provoke too many people, you might be hired by assassins to assassinate you!”

Wang Xian reminded the third prince indifferently from the side.

“Assassinate me? who has the guts to do so? Hehe, undercurrent? Or is it that dragon spike? It’s just a small dragon spike. It Won’t take long for it to be destroyed!”

When the third prince heard Wang Xian’s words, his eyes were extremely cold. He narrowed his eyes and stared at them. “I don’t know who you are. How dare you disrespect me!”

“We are not from your star-moon kingdom, Hehe!”

Feng Luan gave him an indifferent glance and walked out directly.

Wang Xian followed by the side. He gave the third prince a deep look and followed by the side.

“Damn it, Xing Yi. Investigate the identities of these two people for me. Tonight, kidnap them and bring them here. I want to play with them properly!”

The third prince saw that Feng Luan and Wang Xian didn’t put him in their eyes at all. He growled in a low and cold voice.

“It’s Your Highness, the third prince. These two people are from other kingdoms and are passing by Bright Moon City. However, they are in our territory. It’s easy to kill them. If they dare to offend the third prince, they will die!”

The middle-aged man hurriedly replied.

“HMPH, that woman should have the strength of a half-step void interpretation realm expert. I really didn’t expect that I haven’t tasted a half-step void interpretation realm woman before. Today, I will torture them properly!”

As the third Prince spoke, he licked his tongue.

His body was filled with unbridled recklessness!

“What are you thinking about? How is the loss of the dragon Spike?”

Walking out of the Pavilion Lake, Feng Luan looked at Wang Xian who was holding an umbrella for her and asked softly.

“I lost four spies. I’m thinking that the Master of undercurrent is really crazy. Also, that city Lord’s Mansion wants to destroy our dragon Spike!”

Wang Xian said faintly.

Feng Luan nodded her head slowly.

“So I’ve decided that since the master of undercurrent is so crazy, I’ll accompany him and let them see who is crazier!”
