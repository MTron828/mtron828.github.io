The snow-white-robed woman walked out, and the rest of the women began to discuss!

They could be said to be the core of the current generation of women in the imperial court. They had the best resources and the best background!

Back then, the sudden rise of the Imperial Star Lady and her becoming the hottest celebrity in the entire Imperial Star Field had attracted their attention!

They naturally looked down on a lady who raised desolate beasts and was born to a lady who did not have any status in the imperial court!

However, her rise had attracted the attention of many people!

Many women were extremely jealous of the Emperor Star Lady!

After all, there were many famous youths who liked her!

“Ladies, why are you looking for me?”

At this moment, a voice came from outside the door. A young man dressed in cyan clothes walked in with a face full of arrogance and said with a smile!

“Qingshan, you’re here. We have something to ask you. What exactly is the power that the imperial star Lady is relying on?”

The three ladies immediately asked when they saw the young man walking over!

“Huh?”

The young man’s face darkened when he heard their words!

“What’s Wrong?”

He asked with a twinkle in his eyes!

“The Emperor Star Girl is very powerful now. It’s very likely that she has already reached the eighth or ninth rank of the god Lord Realm!”

The three women said in a low voice!

Their words made the young man’s face change again. He walked to the side with a gloomy face!

“The power that the Emperor Star Lady is currently relying on is called the Dragon Palace, their strength is very strong as a first rate power!”

The youth sat on the chair and said expressionlessly!

“First rate power, which first rate power will listen to the Emperor Star Lady’s Orders?”

Within the hall, everyone’s expression changed!

“It’s impossible to order, but even if we can order an undying level 7 warrior, in our generation of disciples, there are very few who can compare!”

The youth clenched his fist! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

When the Emperor Star Lady was close to that organization, he had thought of ways to destroy the Dragon Palace, but it was a pity that he didn’t succeed!

And in just a few short years, the Dragon Palace had somehow risen to a shocking level!

Such an organization wasn’t something the younger generation could compare to!

“Doesn’t that mean that the imperial star lady has the qualifications to fight for the Imperial Star Lady?”

In the hall, the expressions of all the women changed slightly!

The young man sat there without saying a word, and his expression was not too good either!

Back then, pursuing the Imperial Star Lady had embarrassed him in public. He had once bluntly said that if he couldn’t get it, he would destroy it. Now...

“Perhaps everyone needs to change their attitude towards the imperial star Lady. In any case, I don’t have any interactions with the imperial star Lady. By the way, are you interested in going to the auction tomorrow? When the time comes, let’s go together.”

“Oh right, have you heard? This Morning, a lady challenged many of our seniors consecutively...”

At this moment, one of the ladies changed the topic. The other lady also spoke up immediately. Clearly, she did not want to talk about the Celestial Emperor Lady Anymore!

Time passed very quickly. Wang Xian looked at the rich information on the AI. A Day had passed!

“Let’s go, let’s go. The auction will be held at noon!”

The next morning, the empress came to the courtyard where Wang Xian was staying and shouted into it!

“He’s Here!”

Wang Xian walked out immediately with a smile on his face!

After the auction ended, the resources obtained would definitely allow him to advance another level!

Once he advanced, he would possess the combat strength of a level nine immortal King!

With such strength, he was considered a warrior in the Emperor Palace!

No matter how strong the Emperor Palace was, there were at most a few hundred people above level 9!

Furthermore, he had originally only planned to sell the soul returning liquid, now he had sold a few more drops, the remaining resources could probably increase the strength of 4 to 5 undying level 9 warriors in the Dragon Palace!

“Let’s Go!”

Emperor Star Lady stood on the crane and waved at him!

“When the auction begins, there will be something that you like. I will pay for it for you!”

Wang Xian was in a good mood and said directly!

“Did you say that?”

Di Xingnu didn’t show any courtesy and squinted her eyes slightly!

“Of course!”

Wang Xian smiled and nodded his head!

“Hehe, at least you’re still a human!”

...

Di Xingnu couldn’t help but laugh!

“Eh? Why are there so many people and so many experts?”

When Wang Xian and the rest arrived above the auction house, Di Xingnu exclaimed with a face full of surprise!

The auction didn’t take a long time, but this time, the number of people was obviously much higher. Furthermore, there were many experts from the imperial court!

“It’s better to have more people and experts!”

Wang Xian smiled. The more powerhouses there were, the higher the price of the soul-returning liquid would be!

The two of them moved and immediately jumped down from the top. They landed at the Auction Hall!

“Di Tianyao, you’re here too!”

“Haha, Grandmaster di said that there are a few precious treasures here. Naturally, he wants to come and take a look!”

“The items this time are very precious. I heard that some elders and guardians are here. The chances of us getting them are quite low!”

“How can we not fight for such a life-saving treasure? Furthermore, there is more than one Supreme Treasure!”

...

“However, the appearance of the supreme treasure this time has caused the auction house to no longer have private rooms. We can only stay in the hall outside!”

“Haha, it’s not just you. There might be many seniors in the Hall!”

The two of them had just landed when they heard the discussions around them. Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and revealed a faint smile on his face!

He didn’t expect that so many people were here for his treasures!

“You’re going to be rich!”

Di Xingnu, who was at the side, looked at Wang Xian and said softly!

“Hehe, it’s alright. Let’s go to our private room!”

Wang Xian smiled and took out a signboard!

This was given to him by Grandmaster Di, a sect that had private rooms!

As the auctioneer of a few treasures, it was only right for him to get a private room!

“Okay!”

Di Xingnu nodded her head and the two of them walked to the side!

“We’ve met some familiar faces again!”

When Wang Xian and the rest walked towards the private room, he saw a group of dozens of girls walking towards them!

The leader was a girl dressed in snow-white clothes. Beside her were three familiar figures. They were the three girls that Di Xingnu had taught a lesson to last time!

The Imperial Star Lady looked over, her eyes flickering. Her aura was not weak at all as she looked over!

The group of girls in front also noticed the imperial star Lady. They did not move aside, and the imperial star Lady did not Dodge either!

The leader’s snow-white eyes landed on the imperial star lady, sizing her up slightly!

When they met, the imperial star Lady’s figure stopped, unmoved!

“Celestial Emperor, I heard that you are very strong. I hope you won’t Disappoint Me Tomorrow!”

The woman dressed in snow-white clothes stared at Celestial Emperor and said indifferently!

“I Will!”

Celestial Emperor also looked at the woman dressed in snow-white clothes and nodded

“Aren’t you going to make way?”

As soon as Celestial Emperor finished her words, one of the three women who had been taught a lesson by her said with a gloomy face!

“I might have to trouble you to move aside. Our private room is next to you!”

Empress Star slightly raised her head and said indifferently!
