Chapter 1678: 1678 knelt down at a terrifying speed

“Patriarch Fengyun, we want to leave this place. It’s not that we don’t want to help you, but with the current situation, even our patriarch can’t do anything about it!”

Within the fire cloud mountain range, the voice of the Sacred Fire clan elder suddenly rang out.

The eyes of the four elders flickered. They knew that this was the opportunity that the clan elder had spoken to them about!

With the current situation, the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan was completely hopeless!

Under the attack of the Demon God tribe, the four longevity experts would besiege the fire cloud sparrow clan. The Fire Cloud Sparrow clan would disappear from the stage of the continent today.

Under the current situation, they had every reason to withdraw from this war.

In this way, the others would not say that their sacred fire clan was ungrateful. They had done what they had to do.

On the mountain peaks, everyone’s gaze fell on the Sacred Fire clan.

The fire cloud sparrow disciples and experts’eyes were filled with contempt and disdain.

Everyone knew how their patriarch had treated the sacred fire clan back then.

They also knew how the Sacred Fire clan had treated them now.

“Go back and tell your patriarch that the thing I, Feng Yun, regret the most is saving her life and saving your Sacred Fire clan!”

“Ungrateful clan, get lost!”

Feng Yun’s gaze turned towards everyone from the Sacred Fire clan. His face was incomparably cold as he directly opened his mouth to speak.

When everyone from the Sacred Fire clan heard his words, their expressions changed slightly and their hearts were somewhat angry.

“Go!”

An elder from the sacred fire clan expressionlessly said to all the disciples.

“Lord Medicine Master, Lord Weapon Master, our Sacred Fire clan has no enmity with you. Please let us leave!”

The Sacred Fire clan directly flew towards the outside. Seeing the four incomparably terrifying figures and the 200,000 strong army in front, an elder respectfully said.

“Hahaha, don’t worry. We Won’t attack you. Our two great factions have no enmity with the Sacred Fire clan!”

The medicine master looked at the Sacred Fire clan’s 2000 plus people and laughed loudly as he directly said. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Their two great factions had long since negotiated with the Sacred Fire clan. Naturally, they would not offend the Sacred Fire clan.

“Thank you, Medicine Master!”

Everyone from the sacred fire clan heaved a sigh of relief. They immediately flew out and passed through the Fire Cloud Mountain Range’s fire defense.

“Ungrateful thing, I Wish Your Race to be exterminated!”

“The most shameless person in the entire continent is your sacred fire clan!”

Seeing the sacred fire race leave, the fire cloud sparrow race’s experts and disciples cursed loudly from behind with ugly expressions.

Each and every ugly word caused the sacred fire race’s disciples’expressions to change drastically.

“HMPH, calling us shameless, isn’t it even more shameless to betray the Phoenix Dynasty!”

“That’s right, a race that is about to be exterminated, do you really think that they are the famous and powerful fire cloud personal guards of the past?”

“A race that is about to disappear, shut your mouths!”

The Sacred Fire clan members flew dozens of kilometers away. Some of the disciples were a little angry as they directly cursed at the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan.

Each sentence made the fire cloud sparrow disciples even angrier.

“HMPH, a fire cloud sparrow that is about to disappear, and you still want us to risk our lives for you!”

The four elders did not stop them, mumbling as they stood at the side and watched coldly.

Feng Yun did not take another look after she left the sacred fire tribe. She could only blame herself for being blind to this ungrateful tribe.

“Young master Wang, take your men and leave. You must not get into any trouble. From now on, our fire lark tribe will deal with it ourselves!”

Feng Yun turned her head and looked at Wang Xian who was beside her.

At this moment, the situation was no longer something that Wang Xian could change.

At this moment, even if another longevity expert came, he might not be able to stop the fire cloud sparrow clan from being exterminated.

“Young master Wang, you can leave as soon as possible. You can take revenge for us in the future. We believe that young master Wang has the ability to do so!”

“Young master Wang, you should leave quickly!”

The Queen of Fire Cloud and the clan elders also spoke hurriedly.

Wang Xian stood there motionlessly. He didn’t say anything either. His eyes were sparkling as he stared at the figure in the darkness ahead.

“Young master Wang, please leave quickly. Otherwise...”

The Queen of firecloud urged him again.

However, Wang Xian didn’t say anything. He continued to stand there!

“Young master Wang, what kind of relationship do you have with our firecloud Sparrow clan? At this moment, our matriarch, the queen, and the clan elders asked him to leave but he didn’t leave!”

“That’s right. A friend like young master Wang is a true friend. A friend in need is a friend Indeed!”

“Compared to young master Wang, the Holy Fire clan is nothing!”

When everyone from the fire Lark clan saw Wang Xian standing there firmly, their faces were filled with respect and admiration.

Compared to young master Wang, the difference between the Holy Fire clan and the Holy Fire clan was simply too great.

“Young master Wang...”

“No need, I know what to do!”

At this moment, Feng Yun spoke again anxiously.

However, her words were interrupted by Wang Xian once again.

At this moment, a faint smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face as the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

“Haha, if you want to escape, none of you fire larks will be able to escape today!”

The weapon master’s cold voice came from the front.

He slowly raised the giant hammer in his hand. The Flames on it began to burn and his entire body was completely surrounded by the flames.

The flames spread and covered the surroundings.

“Today, all members of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan will die!”

The medicine master raised the staff in his hand. His surroundings were covered by azure-colored water energy.

The black-scaled elder took two steps forward. The dark energy on his body was activated.

“Haha, Let’s exterminate the entire race, Fire Cloud Sparrow!”

“Leave no one alive!”

Below, the 200,000-STRONG Army of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop were holding their weapons tightly as they waited for the Elder’s orders.

They were ready to start a war. It could erupt at any time.

The might of the longevity experts and the might of the 200,000-strong army charged towards the fire cloud sparrow.

This made everyone’s breathing quicken!

“Mo Sha!”

At this moment, Wang Xian, who was standing on the fire cloud mountain range, suddenly shouted two words.

His voice reverberated across the sky and everyone heard it clearly.

When these two words were heard, the black-scaled elder was slightly stunned.

The Demon God, who was lying leisurely in the sedan chair in the darkness, froze and immediately sat up.

Upon hearing this voice, he immediately knew who the owner was!

He cursed inwardly that he had seen a ghost, but he didn’t panic too much.

After all, the current him was not under the control of that fellow. Furthermore, with his strength, it was a piece of cake for him to kill that fellow.

“Hehe!”

A chuckle rang out from Wang Xian’s mouth. He looked at the figure who didn’t react after sitting up and gently touched the location of his heart.

“You used my heart to create blood, strengthen your bloodline, and even comprehend darkness. You are a little disobedient!”

“Back then, I told you not to have any devious ideas, but you didn’t listen to me. Hehe!”

Wang Xian said with a smile. His heart of Light and darkness moved slightly.

At this moment, the figure who sat up trembled.

He felt that the blood in his body was out of control. A wave of pressure came from his bloodline!
