Chapter 1141: 1142 Beast Tamer’s inheritance

Translator: 5496903

Entering the body of the flying bird through the hole at the tail of the sculpture was the only way to obtain the complete bloodline of the ferocious beast.

The Bai Xun Elder used a series of special methods to store the bloodline of the ferocious Beast and demonic beast in the sculpture. Once the sculpture was broken, the bloodline inside would dissipate immediately.

He didn’t understand why the Bai Xun Elder did this. However, he could tell that this fellow had a strong taste.

Pervert!

Wang Xian smiled. He actually liked the perverted taste of the old man.

A void interpretation expert would definitely not enter the body of a ferocious beast from this place.

Not to mention a void interpretation expert, even Wang Xian wouldn’t enter the body of a ferocious beast if it wasn’t for the light and Dark Fire Dragon Eyes.

A powerful expert wouldn’t do such a thing.

However, it was also because of this reason that it was a very beneficial thing for Wang Xian now.

He kept the bloodline of the flying bird into his spirit pouch. Then, he moved his body and came out directly.

“Hehe, little guy, which faction are you and that guy from?”

An expert from the star-moon kingdom asked when he saw Wang Xian coming out with empty hands and a mocking look in his eyes.

“I can’t Tell You That!”

Wang Xian looked at the middle-aged man and said with a smile. Then, he turned his head to look at the sculptures at the side.

“HMPH!”

When the old man saw that Wang Xian didn’t reply, a cold smile appeared on his face.

He waved his arm at the sculptures in front of him and directly shattered more than a dozen of them.

In the entire main hall, hundreds of sculptures had been destroyed consecutively. There was nothing inside. This caused the rest of the insightful emptiness realm experts to look surprised. Three of them began to check the ground and other locations.

When Wang Xian saw this situation, he was slightly delighted. His Dragon Eyes of light and dark fire scanned through the sculptures quickly. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“This is the bloodline of a demonic beast of extraordinary level nine!”

After checking dozens of sculptures consecutively, he was delighted. When he looked over, he heaved a sigh of relief. This was a demonic beast sculpture that resembled an ape.

Only a wide-opened mouth could enter.

“It seems that this old man is not so perverted that he is beyond redemption!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. He flew into the sky and took a look. Then, he pretended to enter the mouth of the sculpture and entered it directly.

This time, no one paid attention to Wang Xian anymore.

These two actions of Wang Xian had long been regarded as a fool by the few insightful emptiness realm experts.

Of course, this was also the disdain that the insightful emptiness realm experts had for him.

This was because they also knew that even a transcendent level nine expert would have to exert force to break the sculpture.

The continuous breaking was obviously not as convenient as Wang Xian’s direct penetration into the sculpture.

Obviously, they would not have thought that the dried blood would be intact before the sculpture was broken.

“Got it!”

Wang Xian directly broke the sculpture when he entered and transmitted it from the position beside his stomach.

“Why isn’t there anything?”

Wang Xian mumbled on purpose as he continued to search for the other sculpture.

“Sigh, what a waste!”

Wang Xian looked at the position beside him. There was a large chunk of dried blood around the six insightful emptiness realm experts. This blood was the inheritance of a bloodline!

Even if it was the bloodline of an extraordinary level 8 ferocious beast, it was still very valuable. Furthermore, there might even be one at the insightful emptiness realm.

“I have to speed up!”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the sculptures and started searching rapidly.

Although his speed was not as fast as the rest of the experts, it was not too slow either.

Most importantly, after the six void interpretation experts and Feng Luan destroyed the sculptures one by one, they went to other places to search.

Half of the sculptures in the hall were destroyed and there was nothing left. Therefore, the chances of finding treasures in the sculptures were reduced by a lot.

Even Feng Luan was suspecting if there was another world in this main hall.

“Hahaha, I’ve finally encountered the bloodline of an insightful emptiness realm ferocious beast. I’m Rich, I’m Rich, Haha!”

Five minutes later, when Wang Xian entered the body of a ferocious beast sculpture from the tail, he looked at the blue blood that was emitting a strong vitality. His eyes were burning with excitement.

“Could it be that the old man of Bai Xun is in the body of one of the sculptures?”

Suddenly, Wang Xian recalled the words of the two void interpretation ferocious beasts that were guarding outside. His face revealed an excited expression.

If he was really in the sculpture, there was a high possibility that he could obtain the heritage and treasures of the old man of Bai Xun.

This was a peerless expert at level six of the Void interpretation realm. He was an existence that could suppress an entire region by himself.

After coming out from the body of this ferocious beast sculpture, Wang Xian continued to examine the sculptures one by one.

Now, he was praying that this sculpture would not be destroyed by Feng Luan and the other Seethrough realm experts.

After obtaining two more ferocious beast bloodlines in a row, Wang Xian stopped in front of a demonic beast.

His eyes revealed a burning look.

This was a red demonic beast sculpture. Its shape was very strange, and it was lying on the ground like a pool of liquid.

It had a long and thin mouth. Its mouth was not sharp at all and it looked very ugly.

In the entire main hall, the ugliness of this demonic beast could definitely be ranked in the top ten.

This demonic beast sculpture was only four meters in size and was considered relatively small in the entire main hall.

However, in Wang Xian’s line of sight, there was a pool of liquid inside. The liquid formed densely packed words that were flashing with a luster.

He entered directly from the mouth of the demonic beast sculpture.

The moment he entered, he suddenly activated an array formation inside.

The liquid words floated up instantly and came before him, forming a sentence.

“Congratulations, junior. Congratulations on obtaining my hundred rounds of Beast Taming inheritance. To be able to enter this place, I believe that your strength is not weak either!”

“The path of beast taming is broad and profound. However, if you want to become a Great Beast Tamer, you must first understand them. You must go deep into them. You must become one with them and become their king!”

“Be it ferocious beasts or demonic beasts, they all have feelings. Only by treating them well will they support you...”

Lines of words appeared in front of Wang Xian’s eyes. When he saw the first few lines, Wang Xian revealed a hint of surprise. He finally understood why the bloodline of the ferocious beasts and demonic beasts would dry up after destroying them.

Old Man Bai Xun was looking for a qualified inheritor.

Only by taking care of these ferocious beasts and demonic beasts’sculptures and entering the interior without destroying the sculptures would one be able to obtain the inheritance.

This was also the reason why many ferocious beasts and demonic beasts’sculptures only had holes and tails. This was because it was a disguised test.

As long as one did not hold grudges against the ferocious beasts and demonic beasts, one could only become a powerful Beast Tamer with such a loving and communicative heart.

“As expected of the most amazing expert in the flowing sea region. His intelligence and talent are really incomparable to others!”

Wang Xian said with a sigh. The success of every expert was definitely not a coincidence.
