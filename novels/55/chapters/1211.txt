Chapter 1212: 1213 the name of the Sword Demon

Translator: 5496903

Wang Xian had a good impression of the young man in tattered clothes.

Back then, he had given Leng Haocang’s golden water sword principle to him and saved his life. He had knelt in the direction of the sword mansion for a whole hour.

He could feel the nature of this young man.

In addition, he had promised Leng Haocang to find a successor for him so that this successor could bring the golden water sword principle to greater heights.

Even though Leng haocang was a dead man.

After all these, Wang Xian decided to make his move.

With a slight movement of his palm, a long sword appeared in his hand. It was a black long sword.

The long sword was extremely deep. This long sword was a non-attributed long sword. Among those of the same level, this long sword was the least valuable.

However, this long sword was the most suitable for Wang Xian.

The name of the sword was demon-free. It was forged from demon-free stones. It was a long sword of the second level of the Seethrough realm that Wang Xian obtained from the sword mansion.

“You want to escape? I want to see where you are going to run to.”

Meng Shaoqin was excited when he saw the clan elder blocking the escape path of the young man in tattered clothes. He shouted coldly.

“Shaoqin, what’s going on?”

The middle-aged man who was standing on the thousand-meter-long terrifying wind sword glanced at the young man in tattered clothes and asked.

“Clan elder, this fellow killed our Meng clan’s clansmen. Even half-step void interpretation and three rank 9 transcendents died at his hands!”

“The weapon in his hands is a void interpretation level weapon, and he’s also a golden water dual-attributed rank 9 transcendent cultivator. Clan Elder, we must not let him escape!”

Meng Shaoqin bowed to the middle-aged man and hurriedly said.

As he spoke, the Meng clan’s over 200 people directly surrounded him in the center.

“What? A dual-element cultivator has reached level nine transcendent!”

Meng Shaoqin’s words caused even the Meng clan elder to reveal a surprised expression. His eyes were filled with shock as he stared at the young man in tattered clothes.

This was the first time he had met such a monstrous genius.

This talent was definitely worthy of being called a chosen.

“No matter how monstrous his talent is, no matter how peerless his magnificence is, before he grows up, he will be courting death if he dares to provoke our Meng clan!”

An icy voice rang out from behind. An old man slowly flew over, his aura locked onto the tattered young man in the middle.

“He dares to kill a member of our Meng clan. No matter what genius he is, he will die!”

“That’s right. He must die today. He must die no matter what. No one can save him!”

The surrounding Meng clan youths glared at the tattered youth with killing intent.

“No matter how monstrous your talent is, how peerless your magnificence is, or how outstanding your talent is, as long as you don’t Grow Up, you’ll still be a weakling!”

Zhou Yan Mei’s eyes were cold as she stared at him, muttering to herself. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Everyone around them sighed when they saw this scene.

Geniuses and prodigies could not be called powerhouses before they grew up.

The young man in the middle, whose clothes were tattered, was filled with bitterness and helplessness. Slowly, a determined expression appeared on his face.

He gripped the large sword in his hands tightly. He did not speak and remained silent.

This was a kind of resolution.

“Let me personally kill a Peerless Heaven’s favorite!”

The middle-aged man standing on the Thousand Meter Greatsword said slowly. The greatsword beneath him disappeared, and a green longsword appeared in his hand.

“To be able to die under my sword after killing you with one strike is also an honor for you!”

He stared calmly at the shabby-clothed youth.

“Hehe, isn’t it a bit too much for a clan to bully an unlucky fellow! ?”

Just as the elder of the Meng clan was about to make his move!

Just as his clothes were in tatters and he was about to defend himself at the last minute!

A voice suddenly resounded throughout the entire area.

The sudden voice caused everyone to be slightly stunned. A look of astonishment appeared on their faces.

Even the two experts at the first level of the Seethrough realm were also astonished.

At this moment, who would dare to say such words?

Furthermore, the voice sounded so young. Was it some kid who didn’t know what was good for him?

However, the few young men beside Wang Xian stared at him in shock.

Wang Xian had a smile on his face. The people around him could not see his smile. They could only see the black mask that he had created to cover his face.

He slowly walked towards the center. He held the demon-free sword in his hand and swept his gaze across everyone in the Meng clan.

“Where did this reckless fellow come from?”

A half-step void interpretation expert from the Meng clan looked at Wang Xian coldly. His eyes were flashing with killing intent.

“The reckless person might not be me!”

Wang Xian continued to speak indifferently. He continued to walk forward in a carefree manner.

When the young man who was surrounded by the Green Mountain in the center heard Wang Xian’s voice, his body could not help but tremble.

He widened his eyes and stared at Wang Xian with an excited expression.

This figure slowly overlapped with a shadow in his mind.

“It’s... It’s senior, it’s...”

He mumbled with an excited expression.

When Wang Xian heard his soft voice, he swept his gaze across the entire Meng clan.

“I will protect his life!”

His calm and unquestionable voice entered everyone’s ears once again.

“Who do you think you are? You’re just playing tricks!”

When Meng Shaoqin heard Wang Xian’s words, he stared at him with an embarrassed expression.

Everyone in the Meng clan’s face also darkened slowly as they stared at Wang Xian who was wearing a mask.

“Who is this? He actually wants to protect that young man!”

“Judging from his voice, he sounds so young. If he wants to protect that young man, he must have the strength to deal with the two first level void interpretation stage powerhouses in the Meng clan. Clearly, it’s impossible for him to have such a young voice!”

When the crowd saw Wang Xian walking over calmly, they were discussing in a low voice with astonished faces.

“I think you want to die together with him!”

The middle-aged elder of the Meng clan drew the green longsword in his hand lightly and let out a gust of wind. He stared at Wang Xian coldly.

“Haha, Let’s Give It a try then!”

Wang Xian looked at the crowd of the Meng clan and laughed out loud. “Then let’s kill him!”

Kill!

The moment Wang Xian finished his last word, the demon-free sword in his hand was swung directly at the two experts of the first level of the Seethrough realm.

Water Sword!

Gold-piercing sword!

The powerful gold-water sword principle instantly attacked them.

“You’re courting death!”

The eyes of the two Meng clan experts of the first level of the Seethrough realm revealed killing intent. The longswords in their hands went up to meet the attack directly.

At the instant when they attacked, Wang Xian’s attack did not stop.

True Sword Rain!

True Sword Rain, an area-of-effect attack!

The demon-free sword in Wang Xian’s hand pointed toward the sky. In an instant, Strange Golden and blue clouds gathered in the sky.

“Clang, Clang, Clang!”

Within the strange clouds that covered a radius of two kilometers, a sword rain shot out directly and concentrated on the group of people from the Meng clan.

“What? He actually dared to go against so many strong people from the Meng clan!”

“His attack is very strong. Retreat, let’s retreat quickly!”

The huge cloud had already covered many people in the surroundings. While they were shocked that Wang Xian actually dared to go against the Meng clan, they were also afraid of the strange cloud in the sky.

Everyone quickly hid into the distance.

What was going to happen next might be a battle between the insightful emptiness realm experts!
