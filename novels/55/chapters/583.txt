Chapter 584: Famous Throughout Yong Chang (1)

When the alchemist and employees of Saint Forge Workshop walked out bitterly from the shop, they were a little out of sorts.

As an alchemist of the Saint Forge Workshop, his standing in Yong Chang City wasn’t any inferior to a Half-Step to Budding Realm expert.

Yet, they were chided moments ago.

And they were calling Saint Forge Workshop trash?

Facing the confrontational group who wasn’t willing to show him any respect, the alchemist of Saint Forge Workshop walked back to Saint Forge Workshop with a long face.

“Tsk! Arrogant scumbags. Do they really think we could get our spiritual equipment and elixir pills refined without your Saint Forge Workshop?”

An old man snorted coldly. He looked at the middle-aged man beside him and said, “Let’s go back now and get our family to prepare the materials for the master to refine!”

“We’ve got to get back too and ask our families to prepare the materials!”

“Go!”

The in-charges of several forces returned to their families and sects rapidly.

They were burning with excitement and wanted to bring the materials over as soon as they could.

Considering the favorable prices the master was charging, the entire Yong Chang City might flood here if other forces learned about it.

They had to get their materials to the master before the rest so they could get their products as soon as possible.

Hehe!

When the group from Tianwen Sect saw them leaving in a hurry, their lips curved into a smile. They smirked at the group from Mt. Zhenliu and commented, “A bunch of dimwits!”

As they finished their words, they boarded their horse carriage and headed back towards their sects with greatly improved moods.

The few middle-aged men from Mt. Zhenliu were completely stunned. They looked at the group of forces that had left with astonishment as their expressions changed rapidly.

“What just happened? What’s happening?”

“A small shop like this... Could it be... Could it be...”

The group of middle-aged men from Mt. Zhenliu stared at the shop before their eyes and were hesitating.

“Why don’t we go in and ask?”

A middle-aged man hesitated for a moment before saying this to the other few men.

“Go. Let’s get in!”

The few middle-aged men walked into the small shop with lots of questions. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“F*ck! F*ck that dirty Saint Forge Workshop. As compared to this master, they are overcharging too much! They are trash!”

However, the few middle-aged men walked out of the shop furiously in less than ten minutes.

They were still feeling a little shock but anger was overwhelming them.

“I finally understand why those forces are saying Saint Forge Workshop is trash! As compared to this master, they are seriously overcharging us!”

“Oh gosh! We have lost... We have lost so much...”

The group of middle-aged men were shivering with anger. They were indeed closer to Saint Forge Workshop.

However, they didn’t get any preferential price for refining spiritual equipment or elixir pills this time despite having better relationships.

Instead, they even forked over forty thousand spiritual stones to bribe the two masters of Saint Forge Workshop.

This allowed their orders to be fulfilled first and pushed Tianwen Sect all the way to the back.

Yet, they would have never expected the prices of this small shop to be so cheap.

“If... If we had asked this master to refine our spiritual equipment and elixir pills, we would have saved at least several hundreds of thousands of spiritual stones. F*ck! we are talking about several hundreds of thousands here!”

The face of a middle-aged man was contorted from anger.

“Why don’t we bring our materials over and cancel our order from Saint Forge Workshop?”

“Cancel our order from Saint Forge Workshop? But we have given the two masters forty thousand spiritual stones! Moreover, if we do this, would it be...”

“There’s nothing to feel bad about. Those two blood-suckers! We have a good relationship with them because we have been offering gifts to them from time to time. As long as we have spiritual stones, we don’t have to worry about not finding an alchemist master or blacksmith master!”

“Yeah, you are right. Let’s go and bring our materials over. Even if we can’t get our forty thousand spiritual stones back, we could still save a hundred thousand spiritual stones!”

The group from Mt. Zhenliu exchanged glances and made their way towards Saint Forge Workshop immediately.

Several middle-aged men arrived at the backyard of Saint Forge Workshop. They looked around and saw several forces and customers collecting their spiritual equipment and elixir pills or delivering materials.

At this moment, that alchemist was conversing softly with that employee and Master Xuanhuo.

Master Xuanhuo frowned.

“We don’t have to pay attention to him. In the entire Yong Chang City, none of the forge workshops or elixir refining shops are a match for our Saint Forge Workshop. Tsk! If those forces aren’t going to refine their items here, ask them to get lost. Our Saint Forge Workshop isn’t lacking their business!” Master Xuanhuo said to them domineeringly. He looked across the few forces in the courtyard with a sense of superiority.

“Yes, master. Those few forces are really courting their own demise. In the future, we will reject all their requests to refine elixir pills and spiritual equipment!”

Recalling the attitude from the in-charges of those forces, the alchemist remarked coldly.

Master Xuanhuo waved his hand, lifted his head proudly and didn’t say another word.

“Master Xuanhuo!”

At this moment, the group of middle-aged men from Mt. Zhenliu shouted.

Huh?

Master Xuanhuo turned around, saw the group and showed a faint smile.

Mt. Zhenliu was a respectable sect and this group of middle-aged men knew how to maintain relationships by sending gifts.

“Hi, guys, we have received the materials from Mt. Zhenliu. Rest assured. In half a month, we will be done with your request!” Master Xuanhuo said to the few middle-aged men with a smile.

“Master Xuanhuo, we would like to apologize to you,” a middle-aged man from Mt. Zhenliu said coldly upon seeing the smile on Master Xuanhuo’s face.

This was the first time he was so cold to a master.

“Master Xuanhuo, we have changed our minds suddenly and would like to take back our materials. Master Xuanhuo, can you guys refund us our fees for workmanship?”

Huh?

Master Xuanhuo was shocked to hear him. He frowned and asked, “What does Mt. Zhenliu mean by this?”

“Our Mt. Zhenliu encountered some issues and will have to take back the materials. Please refund the workmanship fees of seventy thousand spiritual stones. As for the rest, we aren’t going to pursue it!”

The middle-aged man from Mt. Zhenliu spoke again.

Master Xuanhuo was clearly displeased by what he heard from the middle-aged man. He said, “To rush your spiritual equipment and elixir pills, we have lost substantial business. Now that you guys are saying you want a refund, this isn’t too appropriate, right?”

Master Xuanhuo had thought that the previous few forces had left out of anger as they had to wait too long.

“Master Xuanhuo, we understand our request is a little unreasonable but I hope you will agree!”

The group of middle-aged men wouldn’t want to offend the Saint Forge Workshop and thus spoke in a conciliatory tone.

“Our losses have to be compensated after all. We can return the materials to you but you won’t be getting back the fees for workmanship!”

Master Xuanhuo shook his head as he answered.

Upon hearing Master Xuanhuo’s reply, the group of middle-aged men from Mt. Zhenliu instantly turned solemn. “Master, we are already foregoing the forty thousand spiritual stones we have given you guys!”
