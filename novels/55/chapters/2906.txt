Chapter 2907: had the power of the Dragon Palace on his back

The atmosphere in the clan land was a little strange. He scanned his surroundings with his invincible battle skills.

He found that there were people around him who were staring at his master angrily.

There were also people who were looking at him with complicated eyes.

He followed behind the god Emperor of Shangshui and didn’t dare to speak. He walked forward.

“Qingshan of Shangshui, how Dare You Come Back!”

Just as the divine emperor of Shangshui was about to walk forward, a woman walked out and glared at him with a face full of anger. She pointed at him and shouted.

“Why don’t I dare to come back?”

The divine emperor of Shangshui looked at the woman who was pointing at him and asked expressionlessly.

“You…”

“Sister-in-law, it has been a million years. Father died in battle and Second Brother Came!”

Beside the woman, a woman who looked somewhat similar to the divine emperor of Shangshui said to her.

“What happened a million years ago is over. Qingshan, pay your respects to your father. Your father will be very happy if he knows that you’ve broken through to the Divine Emperor.”

An elder in the center said.

“That’s right. You should have come back after you became the divine emperor. What happened back then was just a tragic coincidence.”

Another old man said.

“It’s second grandpa, uncle, and uncle!”

The godly monarch of Shangshui looked at the old men and nodded. Then, he walked toward the front, took out a stick of incense, and kneeled down directly.

Invincible combat method and the others followed behind him and kneeled down to worship him.

The Godly monarch of Shangshui kneeled in front of him and kowtowed a few times, his eyes slightly red.

“The fact that Green Mountain is able to come back at this time proves that he is filial and has not forgotten that he is a glazed person. Let’s not talk about the past anymore.”

An old man said as he looked at Shangshui divine emperor, who was kneeling and worshipping.

His gaze fell on the group of women who had berated him earlier.

The expression on the woman’s face changed when she heard the Elder’s words. She turned her head around and didn’t say anything.

The others did not say anything either.

After all, the current Shangshui Qingshan had already become a divine emperor. Furthermore, he had rushed over under such a dangerous situation. This was enough to prove his filial piety and loyalty.

“Second brother, get up.”

The shangshui divine emperor knelt there for over ten minutes. A woman beside him walked over and supported his arm.

“Third Sister!”

The god-emperor of Shangshui looked at his sister with slightly red eyes. He could not help but reach out his arm to hug her.

“Second brother, Father has already forgiven you for what happened back then. Father also knows that he did something wrong.”

“Let’s just let bygones be bygones. Let’s live well here in the future!”

“After all, this is your home, second brother!”

The woman said to the god Emperor of Shangshui.

The god Emperor of Shangshui nodded silently.

“This is hard to deal with!”

Invincible battle technique saw this scene and muttered in his heart. The current glazed domain was not safe.

“Grand Elders, this is an urgent matter. The domain Lord and the others have invited us!”

At this moment, an elder suddenly flew over and said to all of them.

“Oh?”

“Let’s Go!”

An old man frowned and said immediately.

“Second brother, the war is urgent now. We only have some time to pay our respects to father and the others.”

The woman said to the god Emperor of Shangshui.

“Let’s go. Since father died in the war, I will take over his position!”

A cold expression appeared on the god Emperor of Shangshui’s face.

“Alright, Alright. Qingshan, follow us!”

A few supreme elders heard his words and looked towards him. The group of people flew straight ahead.

Invincible in combat arts followed closely behind.

Soon, the group of people arrived in a large hall.

There were already over ten thousand people standing in the large hall. The weakest among them were all divine king experts.

There were four old men sitting at the front.

“Governor, Qingshan has returned. Let him take over the position of the Old Academy.”

A group of people from invincible battle technique flew over, and the five supreme elders in the lead said directly.

“We’ve received the news. It’s our Liu Li’s fortune that Qingshan can come back at this time. Welcome back. You can take over your father’s position from now on!”

The governor sitting in the center had obviously known of the arrival of the Shangshui divine emperor, and said with a smile on his face.

“It’s the Governor!”

The shangshui divine emperor nodded.

“These few are your disciples, right? Join me, Liu Li, in the future.”

The governor looked at the invincible battle techniques behind the Shangshui Divine Emperor and said.

“Let them join Liu Li after the war is over.”

The divine emperor of Shangshui said to the governor.

The governor was slightly taken aback, and then he nodded with a smile. “Alright, then Green Mountain, you can make the decision yourself!”

“Yes!”

The divine emperor of Shangshui nodded.

He was Liu Li’s man. Now that the Liu Li region was in danger, even the divine emperor might die in battle.

He could die in battle for his homeland, but he didn’t want his disciple to be involved in it.

Once the time came, he wouldn’t retreat, but he would order his disciple to retreat.

The governor clearly understood what he meant.

“Alright, we’re all here. The matter is urgent. The war in the machine imperial territory has already broken out. We, the ten glazed divine emperors, are guarding the border.”

“The Chimei territory has another demonic god Emperor level demonic god. Those demonic god Emperors aren’t afraid of death. We, the six glazed divine armies, are guarding the border.”

“Four divine emperors of the Sixth Legion of the third Legion have died in battle. Qingshan has taken over the position of Deputy Legion commander of the Third Legion. Grand Supreme Fourth Elder, you will take over the position of Legion Commander…”

“Set off immediately!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The governor ordered everyone. At the last moment, he stood up and ordered loudly.

The situation was urgent. If it were any other time, the return of the divine emperor of Shangshui would have been a celebration.

After all, he was a divine emperor.

But now that the border was in danger and the Divine Emperor had fallen, he did not have the time to do anything else.

Now, all the Divine Emperors headed straight for the battlefield.

“Let’s Go!”

The divine emperor of Shangshui waved his arm and brought his martial brothers, who were invincible in battle, to follow the grand supreme elders and sit at the teleportation formation.

“Grand Supreme Fourth Elder, how is the situation over at Chimei territory? Why did four divine emperors die in one go?”

Divine Emperor Shangshui followed beside the Grand Supreme Fourth Elder and asked with a frown.

“No one knows what went wrong with the monsters in the chimei territory. More than ten divine emperors and demonic beasts led countless subordinates and attacked without fear of death.”

“We didn’t react well for a moment. We fought with all our might and killed eight demonic beasts, but five divine emperors died because of this.”

“Now, according to the latest news, more than ten god-emperors have appeared in the chimei territory. The machine emperor territory has seized this opportunity to pin down a large number of our experts. Sigh, this group of Damnable Fellows!”

The Grand Supreme Fourth Elder roared angrily.

“Then why didn’t Grand Master and the others escape back to their own void God nation when they were in danger?”

Invincible battle technique stood at the side and could not help but ask.

“We can not retreat because behind us are billions of experts from our glazed domain and countless citizens. If our God emperor were to retreat, they would die.”

The fourth Supreme Elder looked at invincible battle technique and said.

Around them, some middle-aged men also looked at invincible battle technique. Clearly, from their point of view, invincible battle technique was an idiotic problem.
