Chapter 596: Here For Your Death (2)

“Wang Xian, you aren’t a match for Ao Shuwen and his group. Come, let’s go back!”

Mentor Yu frowned while looking at Wang Xian. Clearly, she didn’t believe he would be a match for Ao Shuwen and the other five youths.

On the other end, a flash of ruthlessness beamed in the eyes of Mentor Leng upon seeing how flustered Mentor Yu was. She looked to Ao Shuwen and made a hidden gesture.

So Shuwen nodded his head, looked towards Su Fa, Tong Xiuwen and the rest and said, “Go! Let him remain here forever!”

A cold and ruthless voice came from Ao Shuwen.

He didn’t make a move himself and simply stared harshly from the side.

A Dragon King still wasn’t deserving of him taking action personally.

“Alright, Senior brother Ao. I’ll be able to kill that brat myself!”

Su Fa nodded his head and bloodlust gleamed in his eyes.

“Finish him together so nothing could go wrong. We cannot let anyone hear him admitting his defeat!” Mentor Leng remarked from the sideline.

“Yes, Mentor Leng!”

After receiving the orders from Mentor Leng and Ao Shuwen, killing intent flashed in the eyes of Su Fa, Tong Xiuwen and the rest. They moved and appeared before Wang Xian instantly.

The five of them stood there and glared harshly at Wang Xian.

“Come. I’m going to slay the Dragon today! Hehe!”

Ruthlessness gleaned in the eyes of Su Fa as he looked down on Wang Xian.

“Mentor Yu, move away right now! Are you choosing to break the rules?” Mentor Leng shrieked with a smile.

“Mentor Yu, don’t worry!”

Wang Xian looked at Mentor Yu who was right beside him. He moved the space ring on his finger and a huge sword appeared in the next instant.

The huge sword was two meters long, half a meter wide, had a bulging blade and was wrapped in a white cloth.

“Let me test out your sword!”

Wang Xian rested the huge sword on his shoulders, looked at Hong Tianda and spoke with a smile.

Huh?

Mentor Yu was taken aback as she looked at the space ring on Wang Xian’s finger and eventually at the huge sword.

“This...?”

She was pleasantly surprised and hesitated for a moment before retreating a hundred meters away.

Hong Tianda wasn’t pleased to see Wang Xian taking out his sword.

This was something he had looked forward to and yet could only have it the next day.

“Senior brother Hong, that is...?”

When Piao Lingxue saw the huge sword in Wang Xian’s hand, doubt surfaced in her mind as she asked Hong Toanda softly.

“Yeah!”

After a single word, he stopped.

“Hehe! It would appear that he didn’t show Senior brother Hong any face either!”

At the thought of Hong Tianda tossing a space ring to Wang Xian previously, Piao Lingxue grinned.

Hong Tianda didn’t respond to her.

“Dragon King, you don’t have to worry. I’ll be enough to handle you and I’ll be the only one attacking!”

When Su Fa saw Wang Xian retrieving the huge sword, he grinned and continued. “Do you think you will be as incredible as Senior brother Hong Tianda just because you are using his sword?”

“In that case, Senior brother Su Fa, you can go first. We will stay around him and prevent him from admitting his defeat!”

Tong Xiuwen and the rest spoke with a smile and had no regard for Wang Xian at all.

“Go! Yu Qianmei, I’ll show you how the most outstanding disciple of Mt. Fengyu shall fall!”

Mentor Leng stared at Mentor Yu with ecstasy.

Mentor Yu didn’t respond to her taunts and simply stood by the side and watched.

“Aren’t you coming too? Oh well, let me collect some interest from the other five first!”

Wang Xian lowered the huge sword to the ground and looked across the five of them before him.

“Just another brat that is going to die soon!”

Su Fa stared at Wang Xian with smiles and drew his longsword slowly.

The other four also drew their swords. The next moment, they swung their swords and formed an isolation ring.

Weng!

A Sword Cloud was formed in the sky and streams of water shrouded an area that spanned over a thousand meters.

“Someone is going to lose his life here!”

“Sealing the entire space? In other words, even if one were to admit his defeat, no one outside the space could hear!”

“Sss. It has been several months since a disciple of Da Hong Immortal Sect lost his life in an arena match. It seems like someone is going down today!”

“The Dragon King is almost certain to die! What gives him the guts to challenge Su Fa, Tong Xiuwen, and the other four disciples. His brain must be wrecked! That’s simply courting his own death!”

“Boorish fellow! He’s too rash!”

When the surrounding disciples witnessed what happened, they exclaimed and discussed softly among themselves.

Several higher management members of Da Hong Immortal Sect frowned slightly. They looked at the region shrouded in a Water Veil but didn’t say a word.

Once one got into an arena, he had to bear the consequences.

“Haha! Yu Qianmei! Take a look with your own eyes! Witness how the most outstanding disciple of Mt. Fengyu is killed right before you!”

Mentor Leng was exhilarated and appeared hideous while laughing hysterically.

Piao Lingxue looked plainly across Mentor Leng and her lips curved into a smirk.

Hong Tianda looked across the group and his eyes beamed with contempt.

“I’m going to slaughter you today!”

At this moment, a blinding light shot out from Su Fa’s eyes. He shouted, waved his arm and a ten-meter-long by three-meter-wide water sword was formed instantly.

The water sword lunged towards Wang Xian at incredible speed.

When the crowd saw it, they were astonished.

“This is... Sword Explosion! It’s so quick and fast. He formed a ten-meter-long sword in the blink of an eye!”

“Sss. It’s not a fluke that he is ranked fifth among disciples in Da Hong Immortal Sect. He’s too strong!”

“He won’t need the help from the other four at all. Senior brother Su Fa could easily kill the Dragon King by himself!”

The sudden explosion of the attack shocked the surrounding disciples.

They were all elite disciples of Da Hong Immortal Sect. With a single look, they were able to tell the horrifying strength Su Fa had displayed.

“Great! Not too bad!”

Mentor Leng was satisfied with what she saw as she smirked. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

On the other hand, Mentor Yu was anxious and stared fervently at the battle.

“Sword Explosion?”

Seeing the huge water sword charging towards him, Wang Xian revealed a cold smirk.

He moved his arm and the white cloth that covered the Serpent Sword exploded away, revealing the real appearance of the sword.

The sword had an entirely black body and had terrifying Scale Stones embedded in it.

The entire Serpent Sword resembled a monster.

“Sword Explosion!”

Wang Xian used the same attack and a water sword was formed instantly.

The Water Sword was exceptionally gruesome and had identical looks to the Serpent in his hand.

In an instant, the Water Sword grew to over thirty meters.

“Explode!”

The moment the Water Sword was formed, Su Fa shouted.

That huge ten meter Water Sword exploded into countless small swords as they flew towards Wang Xian.

“Explode!” Wang Xian shouted coldly.

Grrr!

Just as his voice sounded, that huge Water Serpent Sword also exploded.

In addition to the explosion, a terrifying growl reverberated across.

Soon after, ravaging Serpent swords shot towards Su Fa and the other four youths who had their arms crossed and were watching from the side.

“What?”

“How can this be possible...?”

“Shit! The Dragon King is terrifyingly strong!”

When the thirty-meter Serpent Sword was formed with water energy and exploded, the surrounding crowd could feel a chill running down their spines. At that instant, they were horrified!
