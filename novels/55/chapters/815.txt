Chapter 816: 0817 western celestial domain

Translator: 549690339

“Dragon King, Mo Qinglong requests an audience!”

After Xiao Yu left, Ao Shi walked into the Dragon King’s Hall and greeted him respectfully.

“Enter!”

Wang Xian waved his hand and Mo Qinglong immediately walked in.

“Dragon King, I have something to report!”

“Speak!”

“Regarding the western celestial domain two months ago, according to the information we received, the Western Celestial Domain’s celestials frequently appeared in search of resources. Now, they are cooperating with the Huaxia Celestial sect. The other party has a huge demand for medicinal pills. Currently, we are in contact with them. Hopefully, we can reach an agreement!”

Mo Qinglong reported to Wang Xian.

The Eastern Immortal sect and the western domain of the gods were the two largest cultivation systems on earth. At the same time, they were also the two most powerful forces on Earth.

In the past, the east and the West occupied half of Earth. The two forces were evenly matched.

The powerful forces in the world were known as the divine sects, which also continued the name of the Western continent.

However, there was still a big gap between the divine sects in the world and the real divine domains.

The reason why the divine sects were called the divine sects was because they were a sect.

And the divine domains were a domain. In this domain, there was not only one God.

If the divine domains entered the vision of the Huaxia immortal sects, it was still related to the Dragon Palace.

Half a year ago, the Great War between the Dragon Palace and the Holy Medicine Immortal sect had completely shaken the entire earth. The experts of the Celestial Domain had come to inquire about the news. Since then, it was the first time that the immortals and the celestial domain had come into contact with each other.

In the following period of time, the immortal sects and the celestial domain would occasionally contact each other. It was only half a month ago that the puppet immortal sect and the Greek ancient celestial domain had completed a cooperation.

The Greek ancient celestial domain had ordered a batch of puppet items from the puppet immortal sect. The western celestial domain could be considered to have completely entered the eyes of the immortal sects.

In the past two months, the western divine realm had been in frequent contact with the celestial sect.

There were cooperation and disputes between the two major powers. However, there were not many disputes and no celestial immortals were involved.

“HMM, let’s give it a try. If we can form some cooperation with the Garden of Eden Divine Realm, it will be very beneficial to us!”

Wang Xian nodded.

“There’s another matter. The Huaxia sect and the western divine realm are cleaning up the powerful factions one by one!”

Mo Qinglong continued to report to Wang Xian.

“Oh? Cleaning up the factions? What factions?”

Wang Xian asked in surprise.

“A group of immortal sects are preparing to clean up the other powerful factions in the sub-continent’s domain. Meanwhile, the western powerhouses are cleaning up the non-mainland factions and plundering resources. At the same time, they are also dividing up the territories and reestablishing the faction from a thousand years ago!”

Mo Qinglong’s eyes flickered as he spoke.

“Reestablishing the faction from a thousand years ago?”

Wang Xian was deep in thought.

In the past, the immortal sects controlled a large portion of the sub-continent’s domain while the divine domain controlled a portion of the European continent’s domain.

The two major factions knew about the existence of each other. However, they did not interfere in each other’s affairs.

Now that the immortal sects had been reclusive for a thousand years, it was time for them to rule this continent once again. Furthermore, by wiping out the other factions, they would be able to obtain a huge amount of resources.

The various immortal sects wanted to use war to raise their strength quickly.

“Don’t worry about them. We can just expand the sea area!”

Wang Xian smiled slowly. In order to develop, the various immortal sects wanted to conquer other powers in the world. Meanwhile, the Dragon Palace wanted to expand their territory in other sea areas as well.

After Mo Qinglong’s report, Wang Xian returned to the Dragon King’s bedroom.

“Xiao Xian, we are planning to go to sister Agaya’s place for a few days tomorrow!”

Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue, and the other girls said when they saw him walking in.

“Alright, you guys go ahead and have fun. Coincidentally, I have some matters to take care of!”

After staying in the Dragon Palace for half a year, the girls were also a little bored.

Wang Xian was very relieved when they went out. With Guan Shuqing around, even a superior immortal could easily suppress her.

Feng Luan’s strength was even more terrifying. After absorbing the blood essence of Bian Jiang Tu, even Wang Xian was no match for her when she took control of her body.

“However, before I leave, Hehe!”

Wang Xian laughed and pounced on her.

“Can’t you be a little more shameless!”

Elder fan and Tang Yinxuan rolled their eyes at Wang Xian. They exchanged glances and walked out of the Dragon King Palace immediately.

Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue, and the others were also speechless.

The next morning, Wang Xian arrived at the East Gate of the Dragon Palace in front of the group of girls.

Behind him were Ao Qitian, Ao Qi, Ao Yao, Prime Minister Gui, and Ao Jian, the nine dragons,

at the same time, there were a group of immortals in their clan. Apart from Wang Xian, there were a total of 22 immortals.

Apart from the group of immortal gods, there were also powerful members of the Dragon Palace, 500 nascent realm and 40 half-step immortal gods.

“Today, we will occupy the sea area in the East!”

Wang Xian moved and jumped onto a dragon carriage at the side.

The so-called Dragon Carriage was made of beast bones and grade-12 metal materials.

There was a dragon chair on it, and Wang Xian sat on it.

The nine dragons moved and came to the front. Their bodies moved and formed nine green ropes that were pulled on the dragon carriage.

The Imperial Emperor personally led the expedition!

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian shouted softly and the nine dragons rushed to the front.

A group of members from the Dragon Palace followed behind and headed toward the sea area near the island nation. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The sea area under the control of the Dragon Palace was about 500 kilometers in radius. After conquering that sea area, the Dragon Palace’s territory would increase by about 200 kilometers.

The nine dragons were riding.

In the Dragon Palace’s territory, the aquatic creatures saw them and immediately respectfully made way for them.

This was their king, and all the aquatic creatures had to obey him.

This was the first thing they needed to understand after they had gained intelligence.

It was also the first thing the civil officials of the Dragon Palace taught them.

Wang Xian and the rest of them moved very fast. The nine dragons swayed their bodies while more than 500 creatures followed closely behind. They were riding on the dragon carriage and were extremely domineering.

“The Dragon King has arrived. The sea area is right in front of us!”

Ao Yaoyao’s voice sounded after half an hour. He pointed to the front and said respectfully.

Wang Xian nodded his head and looked around. The speed of the nine dragons had completely slowed down.

“There is a special energy in this sea area!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly and sensed the surrounding sea water with a puzzled expression.

This energy was filled with corrosive and radioactive properties. Some weak creatures would undergo some changes if they stayed here for a long period of time.

“Prime Minister Gui said that this was due to the nuclear radiation, causing some changes in this sea area. However, the radiation energy is corresponding. Some creatures will die under the radiation energy, but some will evolve. This is also one of the reasons why the creatures in this sea area are stronger!”

“There are two species here. One is the snake species, the Hydra Domain. There are two immortal-level existences in the Hydra Domain, one is a hydra, and the other is a five-headed snake!”

“The second species is a killer crab, a 15-meter-long killer crab!”

Ao Yao looked at Prime Minister Gui and said to Wang Xian.
