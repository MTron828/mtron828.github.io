“Bang Bang!”

A violent collision sound was heard.

The water-blue array trembled as if it could disappear at any time.

The members of the amethyst mercenary group stood inside with pale faces, looking at the group of thunderfish in front of them in fear.

Some of the girls looked at the figure standing on the left in shock.

The two thunderfish slowly walked towards him with a playful expression.

“It’s over, it’s over, that freshman is going to die!”

One of the girls from the amethyst mercenary group said with a pale face.

“Ignore him for now, we’re going to die soon!”

“Crackle!”

“AH, the array is about to crack!”

As the girls said this, a few rank 6 extraordinary thunderfish suddenly released lightning and attacked the array.

In an instant, all the girls turned their heads and stared nervously at the surrounding array formation.

The water-blue array formation rippled, and a small crack slowly appeared above it.

Seeing this scene, everyone in the amethyst mercenary group looked extremely embarrassed.

“Later, I and the two captains will stop them. You guys run First!”

Vice-captain Xiao gritted his teeth, looked at the two women beside him, and said resolutely.

“No, vice-leader, let’s fight together!”

“Yes, vice-leader, we won’t run. We want to fight together with you!”

The amethyst mercenary group’s girls heard vice-leader Xiao’s words and bit their lips with reddened eyes.

“Stop talking. We will fight together if we can escape!”

Vice-leader Xiao glanced at them and said sternly.

“We’re the ones holding you back. If you want to escape, then you should be the ones escaping!”

A girl said with a choked voice.

“Shut up and obey the Order!”

Deputy Commander Xiao shouted coldly, tightly holding the long saber in his hand.

“Bang Bang Bang!”

At this moment, three transcendent level 5 thunderfish crashed heavily into the array formation.

The water-blue formation shook violently, and the crack in the sky grew bigger and bigger.

All the girls in the amethyst mercenary group looked at the thunderfish in front of them.

On the left, two level five extraordinary thunderfish were walking slowly towards Wang Xian.

They were walking in a playful manner and staring at him with a cold gaze. Soon, they were ten meters away from him.

“COO COO, Coo Coo!”

The two extraordinary level five Thunderfish looked at each other and sped up abruptly. They pounced directly at Wang Xian.

“You two are courting death!”

Wang Xian’s entire body was in a mess. He looked extremely miserable.

However, it was still very easy for him to deal with some extraordinary level five ferocious beasts.

He raised his head and looked at the two thunderfish pouncing at him expressionlessly. He slowly raised the lightning strike wood in his hand.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

When the distance between the two of them was only one meter, two blue-green spears shot out from the Lightning Strike Wood in Wang Xian’s hand.

The Spears easily penetrated the heads of the two thunderfish.

Bang! Bang! Bang

The two thunderfish landed heavily on the ground.

Boom! Boom! Boom

At this moment, an even louder sound came from the side. Wang Xian raised his head and looked over. He saw more than ten thunderfish attacking the formation at the same time.

Crack! Crack! Crack

The formation surged violently and the cracks began to expand rapidly.

Crack! Crack

Another thunderbolt that covered a radius of 1,000 meters landed on the formation. The formation trembled for a moment before it slowly disappeared.

“Listen to my orders. I and the two captains will defend against them. You guys should escape quickly!”

The moment the formation was broken, deputy captain Xiao who was standing at the front and the two women beside him roared loudly.

A 2000-meter-long blade light.

A ball of exploding flames.

Sand fell from the sky.

Three powerful divine abilities attacked the dozen or so thunderfish.

“COO COO! COO COO!”

However, the thunderfish seemed to have been prepared. The three rank 6 transcendents’bodies lit up, and the scales formed by lightning met the three divine abilities.

The rest of the thunderfish attacked them.

“Not good, run!”

When deputy commander Xiao saw this situation, a look of despair appeared on his face. He shouted at the girls behind him.

“Deputy commander, we want to fight with you!”

“That’s right, even if we die, we won’t Run!”

Behind him, the girls from the mercenary group gritted their teeth and shouted with bloodshot eyes.

“Crackle!”

“Oh no!”

There was a sound of thunder and lightning. Deputy Commander Xiao raised his head and immediately raised the long saber in his hand.

“You can’t escape now if you want to!”

The Thunder and lightning landed on the long saber and transmitted to his body, causing him to feel numb and spit out large chunks of black blood.

She said with a face full of despair.

“Roar Roar!”

Deputy Commander Xiao fell heavily to the ground. The group of thunderfish let out excited roars and quickly attacked them. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“I’ll fight it out with you!”

The two rank 6 extraordinary women saw that deputy commander Xiao was injured, and their faces were filled with determination as they faced the five rank 6 extraordinary thunderfish.

“Bang Bang!”

However, in just an instant, the two of them were swept to the ground by the tail of the fish and were heavily injured.

“COO COO, Coo Coo!”

When the group of Thunderfish saw the three strongest of them fall to the ground, they let out an excited cry and stopped attacking.

They slowly walked forward as if they were looking at their prey.

“Vice leader, leader!”

The group of amethyst mercenary group girls behind them ran to their side with faces full of despair.

“Cough cough, I hope that we can still be sisters in our next lives!”

Vice leader Xiao looked at them and smiled bitterly with a pale face.

“Vice leader, it’s our fault. We’re too weak and dragged you down!”

A girl cried out.

“We don’t want to be born in the same year and month, but we want to die in the same year and month. We can still be sisters in the next life!”

The girls from the amethyst mercenary group said sorrowfully.

Around them, a group of thunderfish walked over slowly and were prepared to enjoy a sumptuous dinner.

Wang Xian, who was standing at the side, watched quietly. When he saw his mercenary group in despair, he raised his eyebrows slightly!

“Sigh, how touching!”

Wang Xian was full of surprise at their performance in the midst of life and death. He hesitated for a moment and said softly.

His sudden voice resonated in the surroundings, causing the girls in the amethyst mercenary group to be completely stunned.

Even the group of Thunderfish turned their heads to see who was the one who wanted to die and interrupted their meal.

“Wang... Wang Xian!”

“That freshman, he... He didn’t die?”

“What is he trying to do? If he didn’t die, why isn’t he running away?”

The group of girls from the amethyst mercenary group looked over and revealed a shocked expression.

A tearful little face stared at him with widened eyes.

“What a touching friendship!”

When Wang Xian saw them looking over, a faint smile appeared on his face.

This made everyone in the amethyst mercenary group a little dumbfounded. What was he trying to do?

“COO COO! COO COO!”

“Pilipala!”

A Guy who appeared out of nowhere was showing off in front of them. It was obvious that the group of thunderfish would not let him get away with it.

Thunder and lightning instantly attacked Wang Xian!
