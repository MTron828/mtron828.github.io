Chapter 1263: 1264 prodigy King vs Demon Soul King Beast

Translator: 5496903

In front of the training ground, all the humans were shocked!

A Level 2 insightful void Tier Demon Beast under the age of 50, what kind of concept was this?

This was completely out of the human race.

Since ancient times, in the human-demon graveyard, the demon beasts under the age of 50 had reached level 2 insightful void tier, and this demon beast was definitely the first.

“No wonder, no wonder, a demon beast at the second level of the insightful void tier could easily kill a peak-stage insightful void tier expert who used a secret technique. Hu Hu!”

“The second level of the insightful void tier, it’s already very rare for us humans to have a first level of the insightful void tier. It only appears once every hundred years, and then there’s a second level of the insightful void tier among the demon beasts. It’s too terrifying!”

“I originally thought that the nameless sword demon would be able to obtain the supreme prodigy this year and spread the might of us humans. I didn’t expect the demon race to be even more terrifying!”

“Yeah, I was still thinking that the nameless sword demon would be able to kill the supreme prodigy King Beast. Now it seems...”

Everyone’s faces revealed bitter expressions.

Everyone knew the nameless sword demon’s strength. He was definitely at the peak of the first level of the insight void tier. However, no one believed that the nameless sword demon possessed the strength of the second level of the insight void tier.

That was because the nameless sword demon had taken a long time to kill two experts at the first rank of the void interpretation realm in front of the sword mansion.

If he was at the second rank of the void interpretation realm, he could easily kill a first rank of the void interpretation realm.

Therefore, everyone was certain that the nameless sword demon had the strength of the first rank of the void interpretation realm.

Even if he was at the peak of the first rank of the void interpretation realm, he was not at the strength of a second rank of the Void Interpretation Realm Demon Beast!

“Sigh, looks like this year’s supreme prodigy is still at the level of Demonic Beasts!”

A young man shook his head helplessly.

“Big Brother, what... What should we do now?”

Tang Yuan looked at Tang Feng beside him and asked with an embarrassed expression.

“Report to father. Hu, the losses are so great...”

His expression was also extremely embarrassed.

This time, he took out so much spiritual liquid and blood essence, as well as the second level profound void tier killing array. Originally, he wanted to kill that demonic beast and obtain the reward of 100,000 spiritual liquid from the mercenary association.

In addition, they would kill some fierce beasts and demonic beasts in the training ground to obtain more resources.

This was a profitable business for the blood flow empire, but the result was out of everyone’s expectations.

The Heaven’s Pride King Beast was actually an existence of the second rank of the profound void tier.

Regarding this, the blood flow empire had no way to deal with it.

“Let’s Go!”

The blood flow empire’s Tang Feng and the others walked into the distance with an unsightly expression.

They suffered heavy losses.

Outside the trial ground, everyone was discussing the powerful demonic beast with unsightly expressions. No one dared to enter.

In fact, in the next few days, no one dared to enter the trial ground.

And while everyone thought that the nameless sword demon was no match for that powerful demonic beast, what they didn’t know was that there was a huge battle happening inside the trial ground.

The owner of the huge battle was the nameless sword demon that they were talking about.

“Star Explosion!”

Wang Xian moved his body and unleashed a terrifying combination of metal, earth, and fire attributes towards the demonic soul.

“Demon Flame Churn!”

The demonic soul’s gaze was ice-cold. The terrifying flames were directed towards the star explosion.

“What?”

However, when its supernatural power collided with Wang Xian’s attack.

The result of the battle between it and Tang Lingwen was completely different.

The demonic flame was directly shattered by the power of the star explosion. The terrifying aftershock continued to rush towards it.

“You are also a powerhouse at the second level of the Seethrough Void Tier. You despicable human. You actually entered this place in a special direction. Damn it, damn it. Do you think that I can’t kill you just like that?”

The Demon Soul revealed a look of surprise. He moved his body and the flames on his body condensed into sharp scales. He charged directly at Wang Xian.

“HMPH, if you don’t become my mount today, I can only kill you!”

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a cold expression. As he watched the demon soul that was like a volcano charging at him, the demon-free sword in his hand began to tremble.

“Spirit Poison!”

The demon-free sword contained a terrifying amount of energy. He stabbed directly at the demon soul that was seven to eight meters in size.

“Despicable human, go to hell!”

The Demon Soul raised its claws. The fiery red scales caused its sharp claws to become seven to eight meters in size as it clawed at Wang Xian.

“Hehe!”

A cold look flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes as he stabbed the demon-free sword directly.

The combination of spiritual poison, water, fire, and wood was the only combat skill that Wang Xian could use to defend against an attack with a strong defense.

Spiritual poison could penetrate through a strong defense and strike the enemy’s body directly.

It would form a fire poison in the enemy’s body.

“Bang!”

The moment the demon free sword collided with the claws of the demon soul, the spiritual poison exploded instantly. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Ah!”

A painful cry sounded. The Demon Soul’s expression changed drastically, and it hurriedly waved its front hooves.

“Damn it, damn it!”

Its front hooves were slightly black, and the intense pain stimulated its soul.

If it wasn’t for the fact that it was a fire attribute demon beast, the power of the spirit poison could have even crippled its front hooves.

Even so, it was still slightly injured.

“Hmph, I’ve said it. Either you become my mount or you die!”

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a cold expression. His entire body trembled slightly as an even more terrifying attack gathered.

“Golden fire cleansing!”

He waved the demon-free sword in his hand forward. A three-elemental divine ability attacked the demonic soul directly.

“What? How can your attack be so strong?”

The Demon Soul felt this terrifying light, and its expression changed drastically. It immediately opened its huge mouth.

“Demon Flame Shield!”

With a loud roar, the Demon Flame Shield directly collided with the Golden Flames.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

However, at the moment of collision, the Demon Flame Shield was directly shattered.

Its expression changed drastically.

“Damn it, damn it, damn it!”

Seeing this situation, the demon soul roared in exasperation, and its body hurriedly dodged into the distance.

“What? The Demon Soul King is no match for that human!”

“That is a human expert. He used a special method to enter the training ground. They broke the rules and deserve to die. Our Demon Soul King is only forty-nine years old. This human might have cultivated for hundreds of years!”

“Oh no, we should run too, run!”

Behind them, more than ten demon soul clan’s demon beasts had terrified expressions on their faces as they hurriedly fled into the distance.

“Boom!”

“Hiss... Damn, despicable human, you human youths aren’t my match. Using such despicable methods to deal with me, Damn Old Thing!”

The Demon Soul King Beast hurriedly dodged the golden fire cleansing attack, but the terrifying divine ability still struck the position of its buttocks.

The near-destructive attack caused its eyes to reveal fear.

The opponent was already so powerful even before he had released his dharma idol. Once he released his Dharma Idol, he would definitely not be a match for him.

The King Beast of the demonic soul was somewhat indignant and angry.

The young generation of the human race was not a match for it, yet they used such a method. They were indeed despicable humans.

However, when Wang Xian heard its words, a smile appeared on his face.
