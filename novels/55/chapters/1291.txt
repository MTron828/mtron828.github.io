Chapter 1292: 1293. He had six wives

“The mission over there failed. What a piece of trash!”

“It was the devil realm who was careless. That Kid opened a grocery store that even sold a level 2 profound void formation array. The assassins they sent were obviously discovered by the array and killed!”

“This kid is very tricky to deal with. When second brother saw us coming together, he also put all his subordinates on the island of the Light Dragon Dynasty. We can’t drag this on any longer. If we drag this on any longer, even if second brother cowers now, we won’t be his match in the future!”

On the back mountain of the Heavenly Sword Sect’s Island, the first prince, the sixteenth prince, the twenty-second prince, the thirty-sixth prince, and the forty-second Prince of the Radiant Dragon Empire were sitting at a table. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Beside them, there were seven to eight young men. All of them were disciples of aristocratic families and favored sons of heaven.

When the five princes saw long Xiaotian and Wang Xian arriving, a cold look flashed across their eyes.

A few days ago, they paid a huge price to hire a devil realm assassin organization to assassinate The Young Beast Tamer. In the end, what they didn’t expect was to fail the mission.

The three assassins disappeared immediately, causing them to look extremely embarrassed.

Yesterday, they received news that Long Xiaotian had obtained more than a hundred powerful ferocious beast mounts, which shocked them greatly.

If this continued, even if long Xiaotian stopped developing, they would still not be a match for him.

This made every prince’s expression extremely awkward.

“A bloodline cultivator from a small country. He is actually a powerful Beast Tamer. HMPH!”

Xu Wenling, who was sitting at the side, followed the gazes of the five princes. When he saw Wang Xian, his eyes were filled with dissatisfaction and jealousy.

Initially, he was prepared to seek refuge with the second prince. However, due to the appearance of Wang Xian, he was displeased and did not seek refuge with the second prince.

Instead, he sought refuge under the first prince, who was also a heaven’s favorite.

Under the first prince, he was indeed more valued and had a high status among the subordinates of the first prince.

However, when he saw the second prince’s powerful strength, he felt a strong sense of dissatisfaction.

It was all because of that young man.

“Hehe, you can look down on bloodline cultivators, but you can’t look down on Beast Tamers!”

Xu Wenling’s words caused a young man on the opposite side to retort lightly.

“Big Brother Jiang Chuan, I heard that a powerful and beautiful Beast Tamer teacher came to your academy. Is that true?”

A young man asked with a smile.

Jiang Chuan picked up the wine cup on the table and took a deep breath. His eyes flashed with a trace of heat, and he nodded with a smile.

“Brother Jiang, have you considered the matter of the Young Beast Tamer?”

The thirty-sixth Prince looked at Jiang Chuan and asked with a smile.

The other princes, Long Xiaochen and the others, also looked at him with smiles.

“Hehe, I won’t participate in the competition between the princes of the Light Dragon Dynasty. It Won’t benefit me at all!”

Jiang Chuan looked at them and shook his head lightly.

“Brother Jiang Chuan, you only need to deal with that kid, not my brother. The reward in the future is negotiable!”

Long Xiaochen frowned and asked Jiang Chuan.

“You can’t even get rid of that kid even if you invite the demon realm. How can I have the ability?”

Jiang Chuan smiled and shook his head.

This made Long Xiaochen and the others’faces turn ugly.

The thirty-sixth prince was on good terms with Jiang Chuan, but Jiang Chuan didn’t want to get involved in this kind of thing.

After all, it involved the competition for the throne of the Light Dragon Dynasty. If the second prince, Long Xiao, was naive enough to ascend the throne in the future, then he would make enemies with him and might suffer revenge in the future.

Long Xiaochen and the other princes’faces turned ugly. They had used an assassin once and paid a huge price.

If they continued to hire assassins, they wouldn’t be able to afford the spirit stones and spirit liquids they needed.

Besides assassins, there weren’t many people who could help them kill two experts of the first rank of the profound void tier.

To kill him, they would need to use experts of the second rank of the profound void tier at the very least.

As for experts of the second rank of the profound void tier, they didn’t have any. When the other forces saw that the other party was the second Prince’s man, they didn’t dare to offend him.

This was because they were afraid that long Xiaotian would take revenge on them after he ascended the throne.

Jiang Chuan had the ability to do so because he was the great-grandson of the current principal of the Divine Wind Academy. He was a descendant of the principal.

Moreover, Jiang Chuan was deeply loved by the principal. He was able to mobilize experts at the second level of the void interpretation realm, but he did not want to get involved.

This made them very helpless.

The five princes looked at each other and frowned while drinking wine. They were thinking about how to deal with long Xiaotian and Wang Xian.

“This must be the second Prince’s good brother, brother Wang Xian. I’ve heard a Lot About You!”

On the other side, when Wang Xian and Long Xiaotian arrived, many people came to greet them.

Many of them also greeted Wang Xian.

Now, some of them knew that he had a deep relationship with long Xiaotian.

Furthermore, they also knew about Wang Xian killing the eighth Prince’s subordinates with the two ferocious beasts.

Wang Xian replied politely as well.

“HMM?”

At this moment, his expression suddenly froze. He stared straight ahead and his expression changed slightly.

“Why is she here? I didn’t expect her to be here!”

Wang Xian sighed slightly. Looking at the figure, he hesitated for a moment before standing up and walking over.

“Eh? Where are you going, brother Wang Xian?”

Long Xiaotian saw Wang Xian leaving and asked hurriedly.

“I met an acquaintance!”

Wang Xian waved his hand without turning his head and walked straight towards the figure.

Long Xiaotian looked over curiously. When he saw Wang Xian in front of him, he was slightly taken aback. His expression was a little strange. “Brother Wang Xian’s old lover?”

“Zhang Fengying!”

Wang Xian looked at the tall and graceful figure standing together with a girl. A smile appeared on his face as he shouted directly.

“Meow!”

A cute kitten squeezed out from her exaggerated clothes and looked at Wang Xian.

Zhang Fengying, who was chatting with the girl next to her, froze slightly. She turned around and looked at him in astonishment.

“What a coincidence. I didn’t expect you to be here!”

Wang Xian smiled and continued.

Zhang Fengying was slightly stunned when she saw Wang Xian’s face. She pursed her lips and her eyes flickered.

“Eh? Fengying? Who Is This?”

The lady at the side looked at Wang Xian and looked at him in astonishment.

“A friend!”

Zhang Fengying suddenly smiled and looked at the lady. “Xiao Ya, talk to your friend first. I still have something to do!”

As she spoke, she looked at Wang Xian with a smile and walked over.

Wang Xian took a wine cup from the side and walked to her before handing it to her.

“Why are you here?”

Wang Xian looked at her and asked.

“To improve my strength and ability. That’s why I’m here.”

Zhang Fengying looked at Wang Xian with a smile on her face. “I didn’t expect to meet you here.”.

“Haha, this Might Be Fate!”

Wang Xian smiled and sized her up. “It seems like you are much skinnier than before!”
