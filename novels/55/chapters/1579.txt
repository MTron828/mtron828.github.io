Chapter 1580: 1,580 dragons had reverse scale 3

“Oh my God, instant kill! She actually killed young noble Tian in a single move! Just how strong is Bing Jian ‘er? !”

“This is too terrifying! She defeated the most outstanding disciple of our sect in a single move! How heaven-defying!”

“She is definitely not only at the third level of the profound void martial stage. Her battle prowess should have reached the fourth level of the profound void martial stage. Otherwise, it would be impossible for her to kill Young Noble Tian in a single move!”

Everyone was stunned. At this moment, in the arena surrounding the venue, when everyone saw Ling Jian ‘er defeating young noble Tian in a single move...

After a few seconds of silence, the entire venue was in an uproar.

“With such monstrous talent, even the crown prince of Wuqing City and Young Master Nangong Wudi are far from it!”

“The number one lady in the vast region. After today, Bing Jian ‘er will definitely be famous throughout the vast region!”!

The shocked voice caused the entire venue to become extremely noisy. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

In the middle of the arena, young master Tian stared blankly at the ice-cold Ling Jian ‘ER in front of him. He swallowed a mouthful of saliva and his eyes were filled with shock.

He was the Top-notch Heaven’s pride disciple in the vast region!

He was actually instantly killed by a female!

How was this possible!

“Hiss!”

At the front, all the disciples of the Solitaire sect sucked in a breath of cold air, their eyes filled with shock.

The deacons and elders were also filled with shock.

The strongest disciple they had nurtured was actually instantly killed by a woman.

“Haha, good, Good, good!”

The patriarch and monarch of the Iceheart Empire were slightly stunned before they shouted out with a face full of laughter.

Their faces were filled with excitement. The Stronger Ling Jian ‘ER was, the more benefits they would receive.

“She is actually, actually so outstanding. As expected of the lady that I, Ao Tian, have taken a fancy to. Haha!”

Ao Tian also stood up with a face full of excitement as he stared at Ling Jian ‘ER with eyes full of possessiveness.

“Weng!”

At this moment, a hexagram suddenly appeared in the middle of the arena.

Following that, a scroll that looked like an imperial edict appeared and floated in the air.

“It’s the teleportation array of the only sect!”

“Ancient array, long-distance teleportation!”

Some people were slightly shocked when they saw the hexagram that suddenly lit up and exclaimed.

“The Scroll of the supreme sect leader!”

In the center, two green-robed elders waved their arms when they saw the scroll that suddenly appeared.

The scroll that looked like an imperial edict flew towards them.

“Grand Elders, what did my father say?”

Ao Tian immediately walked over with a smile on his face.

One of the green-robed elders opened the scroll and scanned the words on it with a smile.

“Ao Tian, it’s the supreme headmaster announcing your marriage!”

The green-robed elder smiled and glanced at the two patriarchs of the Iceheart dynasty.

“Grand Elders, what does the supreme headmaster say?”

The white-haired elder and the long-haired Elder’s eyes flashed with anticipation as they immediately asked.

“The supreme headmaster is very satisfied. Let’s proceed with the competition first. We will announce it when Bing Jian ‘er receives her reward!”

The green-robed elder smiled.

Although it was not the disciples of their sect who had won the first place this time, the supreme headmaster was even happier.

“The strongest person has been chosen for this competition. Bing Jian ‘er, please step onto the Heaven’s pride stage in the Center!”

The two green-robed elders stood up and their voices covered the entire venue.

Everyone who was discussing immediately quieted down and looked at Ling Jian ‘er.

Everyone’s gaze was focused on Ling Jian ‘ER.

Wang Xian and sect leader Ling looked at Ling Jian ‘er who was dressed in golden clothes and holding a golden longsword. Her beauty was stunning and her face was full of smiles.

She flew to the Prodigy stage and stood there quietly like a noble fairy.

She turned her head to look at Wang Xian and revealed a faint smile.

“Bing Jian ‘ER has won the young prodigy competition of our sect. She has become the first woman to win the competition ever since the establishment of our sect!”

“The supreme headmaster has personally conferred Bing Jian ‘er the title of unparalleled in the world, the only daughter of our sect, the most favored daughter of the heavens, Bing Jian ‘er!”

The green-robed elder looked at Ling Jian ‘er on the prodigy stage and announced.

“What? The supreme headmaster has personally conferred Bing Jian ‘er!”

“Unparalleled in the world, the only daughter of our sect!”

“I didn’t expect that the supreme headmaster would actually pay attention to this battle and personally confer the title. Oh My God!”

When the surrounding people heard the green-robed Elder’s words, their faces were filled with shock.

Everyone looked at Ling Jian ‘er with envy.

When Ling Jian ‘er heard the words of the Supreme Elder, she was also slightly stunned, and a faint smile appeared on her face.

“In addition, the supreme headmaster will personally meet Bing Jian ‘er and give her an even more generous reward!”

The green-robed elder continued.

Their words once again filled the surrounding people with envy.

“Thank You Supreme Headmaster for Your Love!”

Ling Jian ‘er held her sword and bowed.

“Haha, Congratulations, Sister Jian ‘er!”

At this moment, a loud laughter came from Ao Tian’s mouth.

His figure moved and flew towards the position beside Ling Jian ‘ER.

Ling Jian ‘er was stunned when she saw ao tian flying towards her. She nodded her head politely.

Ao Tian did not mind her coldness and the corner of his mouth curled up.

He stood beside Ling Jian ‘er and looked towards the people from the Ice Heart Empire.

Ling Jian ‘er frowned and looked at him curiously. She did not understand why he was standing beside her.

Everyone around also looked at young lord ao Tian in surprise.

“Jian ‘er, father said that once the competition is over, he will give you a big surprise!”

The king of Bingxin Kingdom looked at Ling Jian ‘er and said with a smile.

“After my discussion with the old ancestor, I will betroth you to young lord ao Tian!”

The king of Bingxin Kingdom shouted the last four words.

His voice resounded in everyone’s mind.

It also shook everyone around, and they all widened their eyes slightly.

“Marriage, parents’orders, Matchmaker’s words. Master, I’ll find you the most outstanding youth in the vast region!”

The long-haired elder from Bingxin dynasty continued with a smile on his face.

“What?”

However, Ling Jian ‘ER’s expression changed drastically when she immediately reacted.

“What... What’s going on? The Icy Heart Empire actually betrothed Bing Jian ‘er to young master ao Tian!”

“Oh my God, Bing Jian ‘er is going to marry young master ao Tian. Judging from Young Master Ao Tian’s appearance, he already knows!”

“Isn’t Bing Jian ‘er very close to priest Wang? What’s going on?”

“This Bing Jian ‘er is actually going to marry young master ao Tian. She has soared to the sky. In the future, she might become the most powerful woman in the vast region!”

Very soon, everyone around was also roaring in a low voice with faces full of shock.

They had never expected that at this moment, the Bing Xin Empire would actually Betroth Ling Jian ‘er to the young master of Ao Tian.

Some people were shocked. Wasn’t Ling Jian ‘er and priest Wang a couple?

There were also people with faces full of envy. Ling Jian ‘ER had soared into the sky in one go!

However, Wang Xian, who was standing on the spectator stand, instantly shot out a terrifying killing intent from his eyes!

Dragons have reverse scales!
