It was very dangerous outside the city in the dark of the supernatural continent.

Wang Xian asked the group of drakonids to find a safe place to hide on the Mermaid Island.

He and Ao Yao flew carefully toward the location of the passageway between Earth and the supernatural continent.

Wang Xian arrived at the bottom of the sea smoothly with the eye of the Heavenly Dragon and entered the Dragon Palace directly.

Wang Xian’s arrival surprised the members of the Dragon Palace. When he found out that Guan Shuqing and the rest were cultivating in seclusion, he did not disturb them.

“Call the ten strongest members of the Ao Jian Golden tribe over. Also, call the twenty strongest deviant demons over!”

Wang Xian ordered Prime Minister Gui directly.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui quickly instructed.

Wang Xian came to the dragon pool. The corpses in his interspatial ring were thrown aside and were quickly absorbed.

“Hualala!”

Nine divine dragons coiled around the dragon pillars. Thick dragon blood flowed out from their mouths.

There were more than 600 Level 1 transcendent corpses!

There were about 100 level 2 transcendent corpses!

There were 14 level 3 transcendent corpses!

One level 4 transcendent corpse!

The last level 4 transcendent corpse belonged to the assassin!

The dragon holes formed by the corpses of experts were not measured by size, but by quality.

With so many corpses, the amount of dragon blood in the dragon pool increased rapidly.

The quality of the dragon blood far exceeded that of the past.

“Basically, two level 1 transcendent corpses can allow a peak upper immortal member of the Dragon Palace to step into Level 1 transcendent!”

“However, the strength of level one is obviously not enough. They must have at least the strength of level two or even level three extraordinary!”

“With so much dragon blood, they should be able to pile up ten level three and twenty level two extraordinary individuals!”

Wang Xian calculated in his heart with an expressionless face.

“Dragon King!”

At this moment, a group of Dragon Palace members behind him came over and shouted respectfully.

“Enter and raise your cultivation base to at least transcendent-level two before you come out!”

The lowest cultivation base of the group of members from the Dragon Palace was an upper-level immortal.

Among the strange demons, there were two to three who had already entered the transcendence realm.

Currently, the combined strength of the strange demons was the strongest in the Dragon Palace.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

All the Golden Swordfish and strange demons, including Ao Jian and Ao Yao, entered the Dragon Pool.

“The strange demons have been nurtured into the light-pricking dragon species!”

Wang Xian thought to himself immediately.

In an instant, the dragons that were entrenched on the nine pillars spat out resplendent dragon blood. It landed on the heads of the strange demons and slowly sank into the dragon pool.

“Eh? Why is it so fast this time?”

Just as Wang Xian was about to return to his bedroom to rest, he suddenly realized that the strange demons in the Dragon Pool were changing very quickly.

The last time ao Yao evolved into a light-pricking dragon, it took a total of seven days.

“It must be because the quality of the dragon blood is higher this time!”

Wang Xian did not leave. He stood quietly beside the dragon pool, waiting for them to become stronger.

Time passed slowly. Ten hours. In just ten hours, the dragon blood in the dragon pool was completely depleted.

One by one, powerful figures appeared in the Dragon Pool.

“Dragon King!”

Ao Yao and Ao Jian came directly to Wang Xian’s side and greeted him respectfully.

“Very good!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were sparkling. Transcendent level 3. Both of them had reached transcendent level 3.

Apart from them, three golden swordfish had reached transcendent level 3 while seven strange demons had reached transcendent level 3.

The rest were all at transcendent-level rank-2.

With so many resources, Wang Xian was very satisfied that he was able to nurture twelve transcendent-level rank-3 and twenty transcendent-level rank-2.

“This is the strength of the Dragon Palace. As long as there are resources, they will be able to unleash unlimited explosive force. This is also the mother nest that the group of dragon gods obtained from the insect race back then!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with radiance. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Twelve transcendent-level Rank-3 and twenty transcendent-level rank-2. This force was not strong.

It was not strong even in Shenghai town.

However, Wang Xian was not in a hurry. He used these thirty-two members of the Dragon Palace as the foundation to feed the Dragon Palace.

“Let’s go back!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. Without any hesitation, he led the group of members of the Dragon Palace to the transcendence continent.

Now, Prime Minister Gui had already instructed Wen Chen to teach them the language of the transcendence continent and some basic things. Therefore, there was no problem for the group of members of the Dragon Palace to follow them.

They arrived at the sea of the supernatural mainland through the passage and flew out of the seabed quickly.

At this moment, after more than ten hours, it was already daytime on the supernatural mainland.

With a thought, he called the group of Drakonids on the Mermaid Island. Wang Xian and the rest quickly flew towards holy sea town.

“Trash, trash, you actually let him escape. You guys are really trash!”

However, at this moment, at the eastern entrance of Holy Sea Town, the vice commander of the horned shark mercenary group roared angrily at his subordinates.

“Vice commander, undercurrent has failed. Moreover, the people we were monitoring have also disappeared. This, this...”

Wu Dazhuang, who was standing beside the vice commander of the horned shark mercenary group, said with a worried expression.

“If we let them escape, how can we avenge my daughter? How Can I, Ao Kuang, still have the face to stay in Holy Sea Town!”

Ao Kuang’s face was filled with malevolence as he growled in a low and distorted voice.

Bei Qianjun and Qing Guya’s faces were also gloomy and they were almost bleeding. The murderer who killed their son had actually escaped.

The pedestrians around the city gate were also slightly stunned when they heard their words.

“The murderer who killed their children has actually escaped!”

“I really didn’t expect that kid to be able to escape. He really has some ability!”

“Keep your voice down. Right now, vice commander shark and Bei Qianjun’s Qing Guya are in a rage!”

“That kid is really lucky. Otherwise, he would have died if he had stayed in Holy Sea Town!”

“If we leave the city now to look for that young man, we won’t be able to find him. He’s not that stupid!”

The surrounding people whispered amongst themselves. This matter had caused a huge commotion in holy sea town and many people knew about it.

However, the Kid was able to escape today, which was out of everyone’s expectations.

“Hey, that young man, that young man!”

At this moment, a middle-aged man selling goods suddenly opened his eyes wide, pointed at the entrance, and shouted in disbelief.

“It’s him, it’s that young man. Why? Why is he back?”

The surrounding people were slightly stunned, and quickly looked at the entrance.

Vice leader of the Dogfish clan and the rest who were walking out of the city froze when they saw the group of people who came in.

“Why did he come back after escaping? Is he courting death?”

An old man couldn’t help but exclaim.

At the city gate, Wang Xian walked in with a smile on his face. Coincidentally, he met vice leader of the Dogfish clan and the rest.

In an instant, the atmosphere around them froze.

Wang Xian brought the group of DRAKONIDS and the members of the Dragon Palace to a stop slowly.

He happened to be standing in front of the vice leader of the Dogfish clan, bei Qianjun, Qing Guya, and the rest.

“Are you looking for me? Don’t worry, I, Wang Xian, will not run away from Shenghai town with my tail between my legs!”

“If I want to leave, I will do so openly!”

Wang Xian looked at them and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly!
