Chapter 31: Level Three and the Despairing Director Li

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“Fish? They already converted to Dragon Energy. You would have never expect to pay such a hefty price for snatching my buns away.”

Wang Xian overheard their conversations in the sea with a faint smile on his face.

He looked around him. Currently, only one school of fish from the fish farm was left, controlled by him.

Wang Xian opened his mouth wide. He swung his tail slightly and darted out like a sharp arrow.

A few hundred fish were devoured by him easily as he passed through them.

“Extracted 0.09 Dragon Energy.”

“10,000 Dragon Energy completed. Evolved to Divine Dragon Level Three.”

At the same time, Wang Xian sensed an immense Dragon Energy charging and strengthening his body.

The dragon scales, amid golden glow, were even more firm and secure.

His pair of dragon claws were stronger and tougher. Every single strike of the claws contained a daunting amount of destructive power.

His body weighed even more with two imposing dragon beards at the side.

Level Three. With my current physical body, I guess even a bullet would not hurt me. But according to my research, my human form is much weaker than my dragon form, Wang Xian thought to himself.

He did a demonstration last night. He tried to knock himself against a boulder, and the dragon scales on him were unscathed.

But his human form was weaker than his dragon form by two times.

Wang Xian’s current physical body could take a bullet from a handgun or even some guns that are more powerful.

“I still left with the last few thousand fish. I will devour them all and leave nothing here.”

Wang Xian moved his body at an extremely high speed. Within five minutes, the remaining fish left in the fishery were all devoured.

The entire fishery was left with no fish. All of them were exterminated.

Director Li was on tenterhooks as he stood on the fishing boat. His body was shuddering, and his voice was shaking. “Carry on with the search. Carry on! How could the fish be missing?!”

“Yes, boss!” The worker on the boat wiped the cold sweat off his forehead.

He had cast over 20 nets just now, and none of them caught any fish. This was extremely peculiar.

How could the fish be missing out of the blue from a fishery with at least 300,000 kilograms of fish goods?

Voila!

The fishnet was cast into the sea, and the same thing happened again.

An empty net was pulled out from it.

Director Li was getting the creeps when he saw the same thing happening all over again.

“Director Li, didn’t you say you have 300,000 kilograms of fish in your fishery? Where are they now?”

“Yes, Director Li. For both parties to establish a partnership, we need to see your fish. But now?”

At this time, a group of foreigners on the fishing boat frowned as they looked at Director Li in dismay.

Without fish, how are they going to establish the partnership?

Upon hearing what they said, Director Li darkened his expression as his heart was racing in fear.

The fishery had cost him $20 million to set up.

$20 million was invested in the rental and manpower down to the setup, fry and the fish food.

Now, he was ready to use the fish goods in the fishery to recover that sum of money.

But, all the fish goods in the entire fishery had vanished.

Vanished!

No doubt, this had impacted him significantly, and he was at risk of bankruptcy.

“Use a bigger net and pull them out. I don’t believe 300,000 kilograms of fish can disappear without reason.”

Director Li called out to his worker with a sullen face instead of answering to those foreigners.

As the worker on the boat observed the expression on his boss’s face, his blood ran cold. Immediately, he called upon all the other workers to harvest for fish with the purse seine.

Three fishing boats reached the center of the fishery and deployed large purse seine to encircle the school with the net.

Time passed quickly, and the blazing hot sun was hanging in the sky.

Sweat was breaking on Director Li’s forehead while the middle-aged man at the side handed a piece of tissue to him gingerly.

The group of foreigners stood at the side, watching impassively.

The three fishing boats began to harvest the fish, and the net was drawn up quickly.

However, nothing. There were no fish at all. The entire fishery seemed to be completely empty without a single fish fry left. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Let’s go. We wasted a few days of our time.”

“Yes, what a disappointing trip. Next time, we will not be cooperating with a fishery without any credential.”

The foreigners who stood at the side of the fishery shook their heads as they stared at Director Li coldly. One by one, they turned and walked out.

“Why? Why?!”

Director Li’s eyes opened wide as he murmured to himself while looking at the sea in the fishery. There was only despair left.

He seemed to be in a trance-like state as he stumbled and fell on the ground.

“Director Li, Director Li.” The middle-aged man exclaimed as he held Director Li up.

“It’s all over.” Director Li sat on the floor with mixed expressions.

“Director Li, we can start all over again. Don’t give up.” The middle-aged man consoled him.

“It’s over. All over. I need to pay back $20 million loans this year. Unless I sell away all my assets, otherwise... otherwise...”

Director Li was dazed as he sat there with his eyes empty.

The middle-aged man was stunned for a moment and lost his tongue.

“Don’t blame me for being ruthless. Blame it on yourself.”

Wang Xian glared at Director Li, who was sitting on the shore with cold eyes.

He rocked his body and swam towards the sea speedily.

The two-meter long body gave off a mighty and imposing vibe. When he reached the steel wire mesh at the exit, Wang Xian stuck out his dragon claws and ripped the wire mesh into a large hole such that he could dive out from it.

His speed in the sea was so fast that even the sharks were slower than him.

In the sea, the marlins and the swordfish were the only two types of fish that could swim faster than him.

“At first, I thought I would need more than 10 days to advance to Level Three. This is totally a surprise. Now it’s only 2 pm. I shall catch some seafood and do some outdoor cooking back at school.”

Wang Xian was feeling chirpy. Level advancement and the $10 million in his bank cheered him up.

The only thing that was not going well for him was his empty stomach.

He swam back to the sea and caught three lobsters and some swimming crabs before he came back to the shore.
