Wang Xian’s body trembled again. His dragon whiskers collapsed and dissipated. His dragon head had almost turned into a skull.

The terrifying flames landed directly on the emerald-green longsword. The Longsword was emitting a brilliant glow. In an instant, the emerald-green longsword turned into a flaming longsword!

Wood makes fire!

Buzz

Wang Xian took another while. The dragon scales on his body dissipated immediately. An earthy-yellow energy covered the flaming longsword directly.

Fire generates earth!

Buzz

The Dragon Claws disappeared quickly. The rich gold landed on the Earth Sword!

Earth generates gold!

Buzz

Finally, Wang Xian’s tail turned into an azure-blue light and entered the golden sword directly.

Gold generates water.

It was a water sword, an azure-blue water sword. The water sword was still about a hundred meters long.

However, this azure-blue radiance seemed to carry the entire ocean.

It was as though the entire space had this azure-blue longsword as the center of the world. It was as though there was only this resplendent azure-blue water sword in the entire world.

The extreme blue flashed past.

“Not good!”

Wood begets fire, fire begets Earth, Earth begets gold, and gold begets water.

The five attributes were mutually reinforcing. When Wang Xian used all the Dragon Qi in his body to unleash his attacks, he would be able to use all the Dragon Qi in his body.

Under the circumstance of mutually reinforcing, he would be able to obtain a terrifying upgrade.

“Whoosh! Whoosh!”

The terrifying blue longsword pointed at the starry sky and disappeared into the horizon.

“Ah!”

“Damn it!”

Two agonizing screams were heard. In the sky, the two demonic middle-aged men were cut in half by the lazy waist. They stuck the two halves of their bodies together in horror.

Both of their faces were filled with fear.

“Damn it, damn it, damn the Divine Dragon!”

The demonic middle-aged man in black clothes let out a ferocious roar.

“Xiao Xian!”

“Brother!”

From below, the miserable cries of Xiao Yu, Lan Qingyue, and the others could be heard.

Seeing Wang Xian’s miserable state, tears instantly flowed out of his eyes.

“Dragon King!”

The furious roars of the members of the Dragon Palace could be heard from the surroundings.

Ao qitian, Ao Jian, and Prime Minister Gui came out of the sea. They stared at the two people in the sky with blood-red eyes and attacked them without any hesitation.

“Damn Girls, Damn Divine Dragons!”

The two demonic middle-aged men roared indignantly when they saw ao Qitian and Prime Minister Gui attacking them.

“Just you wait! Just you wait! When the Yu Ding appears, we will take your bodies and make you our slaves!”

The two demonic middle-aged men roared ferociously. Their bodies moved and entered the crack in the void.

“Just you wait for me. We will take your corpses very soon!”

The fearful roars came from another world.

Wang Xian only had a sliver of life left in his dragonbone body. He stared coldly at the void and said, “Very soon, I will look for you!”

Very soon, I will look for you.

Crack! Crack! Crack

The void fissure closed.

“Roar!”

Ao Qitian looked ahead and revealed a furious expression. His terrifying claws clawed at the void.

The void fissure appeared again.

“Qitian, stop. Let’s see the Dragon King First!”

Prime Minister Gui shouted at Ao Qitian with a pale face.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Ao qitian thumped his chest and looked at their Dragon King.

“Bang!”

“Xiao Xian!”

“Brother!”

Wang Xian’s body fell into the sea. He was only left with his bones and had lost all signs of life.

Lan Qingyue and the rest flew over and caught Wang Xian’s huge dragon bones. Their faces were filled with tears.

“Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui and the rest of the members of the Dragon Palace also had a drastic change in expression.

Prime Minister Gui waved his arm and a five-colored origin stone appeared in his hand. Three Dragon Balls slowly flew out from Wang Xian’s body.

“Return to the Dragon Palace immediately. The Dragon King can still be resurrected!”

Prime Minister Gui quickly said.

“Yes, yes. The soul-returning wood. With the soul-returning wood, little immortal can still be resurrected!”

Lan Qingyue and the rest quickly came to their senses. They wiped the tears from their faces and said anxiously.

“Woo Woo, Woo Woo!”

However, sorrowful sounds came from the side.

Ao Qitian was hugging Wang Xian’s dragon bone. They turned around and saw two to three hundred dolphins gathered around. In the middle, Tang Yinxuan’s body was being lifted up.

Streams of sound waves entered Tang Yinxuan’s chest.

There, there was a hole the size of a bowl.

The terrifying black energy instantly penetrated her chest, and a large piece of her flesh disappeared.

Tang Yinxuan was only at the Xiantian level. Such a terrifying injury was enough to kill her instantly.

Buzz, Buzz, Buzz

At this moment, the four pink-nosed dolphins surrounding Tang Yinxuan suddenly emitted a special sound wave.

The four pink-nosed dolphins were emitting a pink light, which gradually entered Tang Yinxuan’s body.

The pink color on the four pink-nosed dolphins slowly disappeared and turned into the same color as the ordinary dolphins!

“Huh?”

Prime Minister Gui revealed a surprised expression. “Bring this lady and these dolphins.”

“Dragon Queen, we have to rush back immediately!”

“Yes, we have to go back immediately and take the three immortal gods’bodies with us!”

Lan Qingyue and the others nodded quickly.

“Occupy this place!”

Prime Minister Gui ordered Ao Yecha of the Dragon Protection Department. The others did not ride on the Kun. Instead, Prime Minister Gui brought them to the Dragon Palace with the power of the immortal gods.

In less than five minutes, they arrived at the Dragon Palace.

“Put the Dragon King’s dragon bone into the Dragon Pool!”

Prime Minister Gui said to Ao Qitian immediately.

“Yes!”

Ao Qitian held the dragon bone and put it into the dragon pool.

At this moment, there was not much dragon blood in the Dragon Pool. The revival of the group of Drakonids and the Golden Swordfish clan had consumed a lot of dragon blood.

The dragon blood in the Dragon Pool did not support the revival of Wang Xian at all. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Throw the corpses of the three immortals into the Dragon Pool!”

Prime Minister Gui stood beside the Dragon Pool and said with a solemn face.

“Yes!”

The corpses of the snake-masked elder and the two-headed woman were placed beside the Dragon Pool!

“Hualala!”

The corpses of the three immortals were slowly absorbed by the Dragon Pool. Golden Dragon blood that emitted a terrifying energy flowed out from the mouths of the nine divine dragon pillars.

Prime Minister Gui waved his arm and threw the five elements origin stone into the Dragon Pool.

“Buzz, Buzz, Buzz!”

At the Dragon Throne, the soul-returning wood emitted a gray light as a dragon-shaped soul fruit slowly condensed.

“Prime Minister Gui, can the little immortal be resurrected like this?”

Lan Qingyue and the other girls stood at the side and did not dare to disturb him. When they saw that the arrangement was done, they asked anxiously.

“Dragon Queen, as long as we have enough energy, the Dragon King can be resurrected!”

“It’s US who failed to protect the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui said as he knelt down in front of Lan Qingyue and the others. Ao Jian and AO qitian also knelt down.

“With the soul-returning wood, the Dragon King can be resurrected. However, the Dragon King has condensed thousands of dragon qi. It will take a lot of energy to resurrect him. I wonder if the energy of the three immortals can resurrect the Dragon King!”

“Also, I don’t know how long it will take for the Dragon King to be resurrected. We need to gather energy for the Dragon King Now!”
