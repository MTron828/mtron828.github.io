Chapter 1427: In 1427’s layout

“Oh my God, what is this?”

“This is the Dragon Palace, the Palace of this force? This... This is simply too majestic!”

“In the flowing sea region, there is actually a palace that is even more magnificent and majestic than the human-demon graveyard!”

When all the members of the multicolored algae Demon Beast race came to the front of the Dragon Palace, all of their clansmen widened their eyes and stared at the building in front of them in disbelief.

The building was five to six hundred meters tall and the Dragon Gate was enormous.

The energy was terrifying.

The area of this towering building was more than a hundred kilometers.

The main hall of the human-demon graveyard was not so big and magnificent.

“Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui, who had rushed here after hearing the news, was full of smiles.

He glanced at the more than one thousand prisoners and the smile on his face grew wider.

“Hello, everybody. Allow me to introduce myself. I Am the head butler of the Dragon Palace, Prime Minister Gui. The one on the Dragon Chair is our Dragon King

“As you can see, this place is our Dragon Palace. It covers an area of 150 kilometers

“There are dragon caves in the Dragon Palace that are 30 times more habitable than those in the outside world. Every member of the Dragon Palace can have a dragon cave

“In addition, there is a dragon field that can improve one’s comprehension by sixteen times. It is enough for a hundred thousand members of the Dragon Palace to cultivate together

“Right now, there are more than six thousand members of the Dragon Palace, of which about one thousand and five hundred are at the profound void level

“First of all, I would like to invite you to join the Dragon Palace and become a member of the Dragon Palace. Of course, you all know what will happen if you don’t join!”

Prime Minister Gui Glanced at all the members of the colorful algae Demon Beast clan and said with a smile.

“What? Thirty-two times the cultivation speed? Sixteen times the comprehension speed? How is this possible? Even some important places in the human-demon graveyard don’t have such a perverse effect!”

“Impossible! How can there be such a perverse place? How cunning! They want to deceive us!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The colorful algae demon beasts roared in disbelief when they heard Prime Minister Gui’s words.

“There’s no need for me to deceive you. Leaders, what do you think?”

Prime Minister Gui looked at the two colorful algae demon beasts with a smile.

“Do we still have a choice?”

The two colorful algae demon beasts looked at each other and said helplessly.

They were completely defeated this time. They didn’t want to die just like that!

“Alright, everyone, let’s start to break through the Dragon Gate. It’s not easy to join our Dragon Palace. Only by breaking through the Dragon Gate can you guess that you are qualified to be a member of our Dragon Palace!”

Prime Minister Gui said with a smile.

“What? Break through the Dragon Gate?”

The members of the colorful algae demon beasts were stunned. Then, they looked at the huge entrance of the Dragon Gate.

“OK, I’ll go first!”

The leader of the colorful algae demon beast swayed his body and flew toward the entrance of the Dragon Palace.

Buzz

When he rushed into the Dragon Gate, he instantly felt a huge impact.

His face changed slightly. He gritted his teeth and rushed over.

When he entered, he was stunned!

“OK, the future subjects of the Dragon Palace, come in!”

Seeing their leader enter the palace, Prime Minister Gui said with a smile on his face.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

“My God, the spiritual energy is so dense. I feel like I am completely bathed in the spiritual energy!”

“Wow, what level of heavenly paradises is this? I. . .”

When the colorful algae demon beasts entered the palace, they finally understood what the real fragrance was!

It was a warning of true fragrance!

All of them stared blankly at the majestic interior of the Dragon Palace and felt the spiritual energy inside.

“Dragon King!”

Wang Xian walked in with a smile on his face. The group of colorful algae demonic beasts immediately knelt on the ground and shouted.

Once they entered the Dragon Palace, they would be imprinted with the imprint of the Dragon Palace. The Dragon King would be the main one!

“Dragon King, these are all the treasures of our colorful algae demonic beasts!”

At this moment, the leader of the multi-colored algae demonic beasts walked to Wang Xian’s side and handed over more than a dozen interspatial rings.

Wang Xian took them and looked inside.

“Huh?”

“Spiritual liquid, so much spiritual liquid!”

When he saw the huge vat of spiritual liquid in one of the interspatial rings, his eyes widened slightly.

This spiritual liquid could be converted into at least ten billion dragon crystals, at least ten billion!

Now, he needed 100 billion dragon crystals to upgrade his level. Now, there was 10% of it!

This made Wang Xian’s eyes filled with surprise.

“Dragon King, this is the treasure that our colorful algae demonic beasts have been storing for 5,000 to 6,000 years!”

The leader of the colorful algae demonic beasts replied respectfully to Wang Xian.

“Prime Minister Gui, how much dragon blood is left in the Dragon Pool?”

Wang Xian asked Prime Minister Gui.

“There are still some spare parts. They can totally upgrade the ten members of the Dragon Palace to the insightful emptiness realm!”

Prime Minister Gui replied.

“The reward will be given to the multi-colored algae demonic beasts. In the future, according to your abilities, you will be divided into a separate combat division!”

Wang Xian said to them.

“Thank you, Dragon King!”

The leader of the multi-colored algae demonic beasts thanked him immediately.

“Follow me!”

Wang Xian nodded and led the multi-colored algae demonic beasts towards the Dragon Pond.

However, when more than 1,500 members of the multi-colored algae demonic beasts entered the Dragon King’s Hall, their bodies froze.

Following that, more than 1,000 pairs of eyes looked towards the dragon throne.

“That... that is... Dragon King, why do I feel like we have encountered a treasure that is very precious to us? We can feel a huge attraction coming from ahead!”

The leader of the colorful algae-like demonic beasts said to Wang Xian with a trembling body.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the area. The colorful algae-like demonic beasts seemed to be possessed.

He looked at the position of the Dragon throne above the Dragon King’s palace. His gaze landed on the ancestral tree that he had obtained on Earth.

The mysterious ancestral tree.

In the past, the ancestral tree was only the size of a palm and had entered his heart. Ever since the Dragon Palace was established, it had been rooted at the position of the Dragon Throne.

Now, the ancestral tree was more than ten meters tall, and there were a few more bright branches on it.

Endless Wood Branches!

Soul-returning Wood Branches!

Evergreen Tree Branches!

Each of these branches had powerful abilities.

As for the effects of the mysterious ancestral tree, it was still unknown!

The colorful algae demon beasts belonged to the wood element, and the ancestral tree was the strongest treasure in the world to them.

“Dragon King, can you let us get closer?”

The leader of the multi-colored algae demonic beasts asked with a hint of longing.

“Sure!”

Wang Xian looked at all the members of the multi-colored algae demonic beasts with a little surprise and nodded his head.

“Thank you, Dragon King!”

The leader of the multi-colored algae demonic beasts nodded his head slowly. His face revealed a look of worship.

He walked forward step by step while the rest of his clansmen followed behind him.

When he was two hundred meters away from the dragon throne, the colorful algae demonic beast trembled and knelt on the ground.

All the clansmen of the colorful algae demonic beast clan knelt down and worshipped the ancestral tree devoutly.

Buzz

Under Wang Xian’s shocked gaze, the main trunk of the ancestral tree shook slightly. Waves of energy filled with vitality flew towards them.

Rustle

Following that, the endless wood on the ancestral tree trembled slightly.

The beautiful sparks also flew towards the colorful algae demonic beasts!
