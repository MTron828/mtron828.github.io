Chapter 1676: 1676 Jie Jie, I’m Coming! I’m Coming

Scarlet Flames covered the sky!

Azure light intersected with each other!

One on the left and one on the right, two longevity-level experts stepped on the light and appeared in front of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan.

The two experts seemed to occupy half of the sky.

The 200,000 experts behind each emitted an intense killing intent as they stared at the front with ferocious expressions.

The domineering aura of the Medicine Master and the weapon master contained an unquestionable voice that resounded throughout the entire sky.

Extinguishing the fire cloud sparrow clan!

The medicine master and the weapon master stared over with icy cold eyes. They floated in the sky above volcano city as their gazes landed on Feng Yun, who was at the very center.

“Hehe, if you want to exterminate my fire cloud sparrow clan, you don’t have the strength to do so!”

“No matter how declining our Fire Cloud Sparrow clan is, it’s not something that can be easily exterminated by just a few people!”

Feng Yun’s eyes emitted a scorching light as he slowly raised the Phoenix staff in his hand.

“Feng Yun, in the past few years, you have been making enemies with our life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop. Do you think that we are easy to bully?”

“Do you still think that you are the famous fire cloud personal guard from back then?”

The medicine master stared at Feng Yun as he coldly shouted from afar.

“Personal guard of Fire Cloud, how can you hide in the fire cloud mountain range and not dare to come out? Hehe!”

The weapon master sneered and mocked.

“Today, I will make you disappear like the city under your feet on this continent!”

As the weapon master spoke, a fiery red giant hammer that was emitting light appeared in his hand.

He gently hammered down!

“Boom!”

An invisible energy charged down, and streaks of fiery light seemed to cause an earthquake.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

Following that, a terrifying tremor and the sound of collapsing could be heard.

From Afar, all the buildings within a hundred kilometer radius quickly collapsed.

With a single strike, the entire city turned into nothingness.

“Hiss, what terrifying strength. Is this the Wanshou Master?”

“He’s too powerful. He destroyed a city with a single strike. This... This is simply too powerful!”

Everyone was shocked when they saw the weapon master destroying a city with a single strike.

Even Wang Xian had a hint of shock in his eyes.

He could only flee when he encountered a Wanshou Master!

“Haha, Weapon Master, don’t be so cocky. Even if you and the medicine master attack together today, I, Feng Yun, am not afraid of You!”

“I want to see if the two of you can defeat me together!”

At this moment, Feng Yun, who was standing on the Central Mountain Peak, laughed out loud.

There was not the slightest fear on her face. Waves of powerful aura caused the flames in the sky to condense into a fire cloud.

One person against two opponents of the same level, there was not the slightest fear.

“Fight, Our Fire Cloud Sparrow clan is not afraid of the two great factions!”

“That’s right, so what if it’s two big forces!”

When the fire cloud sparrow disciples saw the domineering patriarch, their faces were filled with endless fighting spirit.

They had patriarch Phoenix Cloud, the powerful and mysterious young master Wang, and the assassin organization.

So what if it was two big forces?

What was there to be afraid of?

If they were strong, they would have exterminated their fire cloud sparrow long ago. They wouldn’t have waited until now.

All the disciples raised the weapons in their hands and roared loudly.

“All members of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan, today is the Day You Die!”

“Disciples of the life and Death Pill Workshop, prepare to kill the enemy!”

“Disciples of the Holy Item Forging workshop, prepare to kill the enemy!”

When the disciples of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop heard the voices of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan, they immediately roared ferociously.

“Kill!”

The 200,000 disciples’earth-shaking killing cries rang out!

“After today, there will be no more fire cloud sparrow clan!”

The medicine master’s face revealed a cold expression. He waved the scepter in his hand, and an enormous sea beast instantly condensed in the sky.

The Azure Colored Water Energy Beast’s body had reached a radius of 10 kilometers, and it directly attacked in front.

“HMPH, fire clouds are in the sky. No one can extinguish our flames!”

Feng Yun’s expression was ice-cold. He waved the scepter in his hand, and an incomparably huge fire Phoenix directly attacked the Azure Beast.

“Zi Zi Zi!”

The sound of melting was heard, and the Azure Beast quickly disappeared.

“This is the fire cloud sparrow clan’s home ground. Standing inside, their strength can increase by a lot!”

The weapon master saw that the medicine master’s attack was easily blocked, and said indifferently.

“I don’t know where you get your courage from. You want to destroy our fire cloud sparrow with just your strength? Wishful Thinking!”

Feng Yun took two steps forward and the staff in her hand heavily landed on the mountain peak.

“Is that so? Then I want to give it a try too!”

The weapon master looked at the medicine master and the two nodded.

“Dharma Idol, Blazing Flame Hammer!”

“Dharma Idol, Sky Sea!”

The two shouted, and the giant flaming hammer in the weapon master’s hand swung toward the fire cloud sparrow clan.

The magic staff in the medicine master’s hand pointed in the air, and an enormous ocean appeared.

The two attacks directly attacked the fire cloud mountain range.

“Double Phoenix spread wings!”

Feng Yun waved the magic staff in his hand, and the fire light around the fire cloud mountain range condensed into two enormous wings.

The clear wings and enormous wings directly met the two attacks.

“Boom! Boom!”

An earth-shaking sound rang out once again. The attacks of the medicine master and the weapon master were once again blocked.

“Blocked! Our ancestor blocked it again!”

“Haha, the Fire Cloud Mountain Range is our territory. Once the array formation is activated, our ancestor’s strength will increase by a lot. With their strength, it’s impossible for them to charge in!”

When the members of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan saw this scene, excitement appeared on their faces.

When the disciples of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop saw this scene, they frowned slightly. Their expressions were somewhat unsightly.

If they couldn’t break through the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan’s defenses this time, then they would lose a lot of face.

They went out in full force, but in the end, they left dejectedly.

“After all, the fire cloud personal guards are the fire cloud personal guards. The fire cloud mountain range was once personally modified by the great empress. Once the formation is activated, the wind cloud forefather alone inside can completely block the attacks of two longevity experts!”

“Even if the great empress isn’t here and the firecloud personal guard has retreated, the firecloud Sparrow clan is still not something that can be easily destroyed. Without two or more longevity experts, don’t even think about breaking through the firecloud mountain range’s defenses!”

At this moment, several spies from other factions were hiding in the void several hundred kilometers around the firecloud mountain range.

The Life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop had all come out to exterminate the firecloud Sparrow clan. This had attracted the attention of all the factions.

The five great empires and other factions had all sent people to watch this battle.

They used some arrays to look at the location of the battlefield.

When they saw that patriarch Feng Yun had easily withstood the attacks of the two great factions, they discussed amongst themselves.

“Keke, it’s not good to peep here!”

Just as the people from the various factions were discussing, a voice suddenly sounded in their ears.

The scouts from all the factions trembled slightly, and their faces were instantly filled with cold sweat. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Keke, I’m Coming!”

The sky instantly darkened, and the dawn sky seemed to instantly turn dark.

An arrogant and unruly smile sounded in the sky!
