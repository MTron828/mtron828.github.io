Chapter 2969: , in the starry sky

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The roar was heard and the entire chimei territory seemed to be in an uproar.

The members of the Dragon Palace had a full-scale collision with Yaoxie.

The five leaders of Yaoxie did not hesitate at all when they saw Wang Xian killing an existence on the same level as them. They immediately surrounded and attacked him.

However, very soon, the 40 members of the Dragon Palace with the combat strength of a celestial thearch level four flew behind Wang Xian.

King to King!

General to General!

“Kill!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with excitement. He moved his body and met with a leader of the demonic beasts.

Wang Xian, who had improved by two levels, had now grown to 40,000 meters in size.

40,000 meters was equivalent to 40 kilometers. He was definitely a behemoth.

The five leaders of the demonic beasts were at most 10,000 meters in size.

However, their size did not represent their strength.

Having a huge size had its pros and cons.

“Roar!”

Wang Xian’s speed was very fast. The Tai Chi Dragon disc around him was spinning rapidly.

It locked onto a level five celestial thearch demonic beast. Its huge dragon tail swept across.

“Roar! Roar!”

The leader of the demonic beasts was not a pushover either. He had two huge claws.

With a wave of his claws, golden cracks covered Wang Xian directly.

“Roar!”

Wang Xian let out a low roar. His figure flashed and he dodged the attack instantly. He appeared behind the leader of the demonic beasts and clawed down with his dragon claws.

“Roar!”

The leader of the Demonic Beasts was already prepared for Wang Xian’s speed. He raised his head and spat out a stream of golden nomological energy.

“Boom!”

The golden energy charged and the Tai Chi Dragon flew to the sky above the dragon claws, forming an absolute defense.

The Dragon Claw continued to attack the leader of the demonic beasts below.

“Bang!”

The huge collision sent the leader of the demonic beasts flying backward. A large amount of blood oozed out from its body.

Wang Xian continued to attack.

In a one-on-one situation, even if it wasn’t a sudden attack, Wang Xian could finish the battle in a very short period of time.

In the surroundings, the 40 level four divine emperor combat strength members of the Dragon Palace surrounded the other four leaders of the demonic beasts.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The high-end battle-power members were entangled, and the hundreds of billions of demonic leaders below were even more miserable.

Black Shadows weaved through the Demonic Army, easily parasitizing the demonic leaders.

In the next moment, these demonic leaders attacked their companions.

This made countless demonic leaders extremely furious and chaotic.

At the rear, arrows kept whistling over. Every second, millions of demonic beasts were killed by the arrows.

The berserk devourer dragon, the berserk dragon, the Starwood Dragon, and the Imperial Dragon were charging at the strongest side.

They formed teams, the berserk dragon was the main attacker, the imperial dragon was the main defender, and the Starwood Dragon was the main entangler.

The perfect combination made it impossible for Yao Xie to break through them, and he was quickly killed.

Every time the thorned dragon seed, which was hidden in the void, appeared, a powerful Yao Xie was instantly assassinated.

The huge gap made the war somewhat one-sided.

If not for the large number of Dragon Palace’s divine emperor experts surrounding and attacking the rank four divine emperor Yao Xie, most of Yao Xie would have been killed by now.

After all, there were too many divine emperors in the Dragon Palace, ten times more than Yao Xie.

“TSK TSK TSK, this feels great!”

On the battlefield, a figure held a dagger in his hand as he shuttled through the center.

Other than those above rank 2 divine emperors, no one else could see this figure.

He flashed in front of a rank 3 divine emperor and stabbed the dagger into Yao Xie’s eyes.

The rank three celestial thearch Yao Xie was so angry that he was about to attack when he realized that the figure had disappeared.

When the rank three celestial thearch Yao Xie reacted, he had already stabbed more than ten rank three celestial thearch Yao Xie’s eyes.

“Hahaha!”

This made an lie laugh crazily, full of excitement.

He was a unique existence in this universe.

The Dragon Palace had originally planned to use the ordinary fetus fruit to create another person with his ability, but they did not succeed.

This made an lie extremely excited.

He was still the most powerful!

With an lie around, it was much easier to deal with Yaoxie who was at the divine emperor level.

An Lie’s current strength was at the second level of the divine emperor level. He could easily deal with enemies below the third level of the divine emperor level, including those at the third level. It could be said that he could kill them at will.

This ability was very abnormal.

With his talent, there was no way he could defeat him with a numerical advantage.

Even if there were a hundred million level one divine emperors working together, an lie could easily kill them all.

This was because his teleportation was too terrifying.

If he could not keep up with his speed, he could forget about killing him.

A vast war broke out in the chimei territory.

This was a real war. It was ten times more terrifying than when the Dragon Palace invaded the machine royal territory.

Nearly eight thousand celestial thearchs participated in this battle. It could be said that the sun and moon were dim, and the stars were dim.

The surrounding void was directly blasted apart, and the battle proceeded in a crack in the void.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

At this moment, a miserable cry was heard. In the sky, Wang Xian’s dragon claws grabbed tightly onto a fifth level celestial thearch leader.

The terrifying dragon claws grabbed onto it, causing it to continuously let out painful roars.

“Roar!”

At the mouth of elder Wang Xian, a stream of destructive energy swept towards the leader of the demonic beasts.

“Buzz!”

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Five Divine Dragons pulled the millstone on the five elements millstone and raised their heads to let out a roar.

A five-colored dragon sword condensed and emitted a dazzling light as it pierced towards the leader of the demonic beasts under Wang Xian’s dragon claws.

“PFFF! PFFF! PFFF!”

The annihilated energy swept across and the five-colored Dragon Sword penetrated through it directly.

“Roar!”

A miserable roar sounded. The leader of the demonic beasts widened his eyes and was filled with despair.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

At the side, the other four leaders of the demonic beasts heard the miserable screams and looked over.

“Roar! Roar!”

Seeing another demonic beast of the same level die, a hint of fear appeared in their eyes.

“Kill!”

Wang Xian moved his body and attacked the leader of the demonic beasts.

“Roar!”

When the leader of the demonic beasts saw Wang Xian’s attack, it revealed a fearful expression. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

When it saw that Wang Xian had killed two demonic beasts of the same level as it, it looked at Wang Xian with fear in its eyes.

It moved its body and wanted to escape.

“Stop him!”

The level four combat strength members of the Dragon Palace immediately roared and attacked it one after another.

“You want to escape!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with coldness. He waved his five elements millstone and attacked it directly.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Ga Ga Ga!”

The other three demons had a bad premonition. They let out a furious roar and wanted to escape into the distance.

“HMPH!”

Wang Xian snorted coldly. “Stop them. If you can’t stop them, leave something behind and use the formation to lock onto them!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The members of the Dragon Palace replied loudly.
