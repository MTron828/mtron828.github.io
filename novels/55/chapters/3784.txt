“What is this?”

“Is this a domain? Why do I feel like we are completely in another space?”

The expressions of the great beings of the angel race changed drastically when they saw that they were instantly pulled into the Kun domain.

Their eyes were filled with terror!

Normally, the domain of a universe master level great being belonged to the type of coverage type. In essence, it still belonged to this piece of starry sky.

However, this kun domain seemed to be a special world, a special space.

They couldn’t sense the teleportation array not far away!

When they couldn’t sense the teleportation array, their faces were filled with fear.

“Wu Wu Wu!”

At this time, muffled roars sounded.

In their line of sight, the injured little blue, little house, and little white slowly appeared, staring at them coldly.

“What… What’s going on? Do these three space beasts have a grudge against us? Why are they targeting us?”

The group of experts from the angel race stared at Xiao Lan and Xiao Zhai, their eyes slightly red, and their faces filled with terror!

They were not in the territory of the Space Beasts.

Why did these three space beasts seem to have a deep grudge against them?

“Wuuu!”

The Little House shook its enormous body and charged towards them.

Whitey didn’t hesitate at all.

“Defend!”

“Summon an army of angels!”

The group of Angels roared crazily!

Eight level 6 ruler-level angels waved their arms and an army of one million angels appeared.

Among them, there were five level 6 ruler-level battle angels.

More than ten 5th level of the ruler Realm Angels also summoned their own legions.

The legions of seven to eight million angels all attacked little white and little house.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

Countless powers of light and darkness attacked them.

“Wuuu!”

Little White growled, and his body shook slightly. Numerous fish-like shadows appeared.

They were like ancient savage totems as they attacked them.

The collision of energy caused the group of experts from the Angel race and the Angel Army’s attacks to quickly crumble under the ancient totem-like phantoms!

The group of experts from the Angel Race revealed expressions of despair.

“The gap between us and this space beast is too big!”

“It’s over, completely over!”

“I don’t have any treasures that can revive me. I don’t want to Die!”

An angel roared in despair.

Not every great being of the angel race had a true treasure that could revive them.

At least, more than half of them didn’t.

If they died, they would really die!

Their eyes were filled with despair.

“Wu Wu!”

The small house continued to charge towards them, that huge ancient body gently sweeping towards them.

It seemed like a light attack, but its speed was extremely terrifying.

“Peng Peng Peng!”

In front of the invincible power, their life force quickly disappeared.

There was simply no room for resistance.

After all, their battle strength was on the same level as Little White’s small house.

An angel at the level of level five of the Universe Dominator had fallen!

An angel at the level six of the Universe Dominator had fallen!

Crestford looked at this scene with a face full of despair and fear.

He was going to die again!

Most of his savings and the powerful metal that he had regained over the years were going to be gone!

Everything was gone again!

Without waiting for him to think for another second, this body of his had completely collapsed.

Wang Xian looked at the group of angels being killed quickly, and his eyes shone brightly.

“Xiao Xian, their vitality has all disappeared!”

Lan Qingyue said to Wang Xian with a smile.

“HMM, the harvest this time is not bad!”

Wang Xian’s face was filled with excitement. He moved his body and flew out from Xiao Lan’s body.

In front of him, the corpses of the angel race and the Angel Army were floating in the air.

There were 13 of them who were in the level six realm. There were more than 40 of them who were in the level five realm.

The main reason was that the eight angels who were in the level six realm had a large number of Angel Army.

“Xiao Lan, after the three of you absorb these corpses, can you all level up?”

Wang Xian asked Xiao Lan.

“Yes, Dragon King. It’s enough.”

Xiao Lan replied!

“Alright, Alright!”

Wang Xian’s eyes glowed.

He moved and arrived in front of the group of corpses. With a wave of his arm, he stored all the storage space on them.

After checking the resources inside, Wang Xian was satisfied.

These resources were enough to increase his strength.

There were still quite a number of resources left.

After all, this was the collection of more than ten level-five angels and eight level-six angels.

Their collection was not something that Wang Xian could compare to.

At their level, they were already able to hunt down some of the space beasts in the starry universe.

They had obtained a large number of resources from life planets.

“Let’s go. After we increase our strength, the Hard Steel Angels and the Phoenix Race!”

Wang Xian licked his lips. His eyes were filled with excitement.

His improvement along with Xiao Lan and the others’improvement.

It wouldn’t be long before they could fight head-on with them!

“Woo Woo!”

The small house let out a low growl. Their figures appeared in front of the storm continent once again.

Their bodies trembled. All the machines in the surroundings collapsed.

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and flew into the metal fortress.

When he arrived at the metal fortress and saw some metal materials inside, he smiled.

This time, he had gained a lot from the meteorite metal. However, it would be very difficult for him to make a breakthrough in the Tai Chi Dragon Plate and the five elements grinding mill!

Other than that, Wang Xian had also kept the light judgment formation of the Angel clan.

This was a good treasure.

However, he didn’t dare to use such a treasure. He was afraid that the Angel clan would be able to take it away. He wanted to see if it could be absorbed by the Tai Chi Dragon Plate. If it could be absorbed, it would be a huge profit.

“Let’s Go!”

After collecting all the items, they moved and left the place immediately.

After flying for a few months, Wang Xian and the rest found a place to stop.

“Let Xiao Lan and Xiao Bai improve first. I need to improve my strength as well!”

Wang Xian looked at Lan Qingyue and said to her.

“Alright, Xiao Xian!”

Lan qingyue nodded.

In order to prevent any accidents, Wang Xian contacted an lie and asked him to bring him back to the Dragon Palace.

When he returned to the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian immediately transformed into his divine dragon form and began to devour a large amount of resources.

…

“Huh? What? Our Angel clan’s storm continent was attacked by the space beasts and all the experts of the Angel clan were killed?”

At the same time, in the starry universe, the third prince was standing on a vital planet. When he received the news, his expression turned ugly.

On the storm continent, there were eight level 6 angel experts of the Angel clan. If all of them died, it would be a huge loss.
