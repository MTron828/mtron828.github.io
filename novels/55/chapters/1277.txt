Chapter 1278: 1279 Heaven’s Pride Wang Shou submitted

Translator: 5496903

“Boom! Boom!”

On the arena, the sound of an explosion could be heard. The Demon Soul used its Dharma Idol, the demonic Lin Wings, to attack the fire territory directly.

The fire territory was originally a dual-attribute divine ability. With Wang Xian’s current strength, the dual-attribute divine ability was still able to contend against the Dharma Idol of the second level of the Seethrough realm.

When the demon soul charged into the interior of the fire territory, a look of regret appeared on its face.

The terrifying flames and the crumbling soil were like the collapse of a mountain!

The entire space was like a collapsing volcano.

Two types of energy charged towards the demon soul. Although the wings of the demon Lin could withstand it, its speed was completely restricted.

“Run, run. If I can’t escape, I’m done for!”

The eyes of the demon Lin revealed an imposing manner that was unafraid of death. The Flames on its body wrapped around its entire body. It directly withstood the powerful attack and ran for its life.

“This time, you won’t be able to escape. Golden Fire Cleansing!”

The moment the demon Lin charged into the fire territory, Wang Xian didn’t hesitate at all. He unleashed his divine ability, golden fire cleansing, once again.

Golden fire cleansing, golden water fire three elemental divine ability. Compared to the attack from the fire territory, golden fire cleansing was much more powerful.

Golden Fire Cleansing was a single-target attack, and its single-target destructive power was the strongest.

When the golden light tore through the sky as if it was tearing through space, the demon soul in the fire domain revealed a hint of despair.

“Don’t... Don’t kill me, don’t kill me!”

Before the attack could be broken, another attack came.

The Demon Soul immediately roared in fear.

The sound of begging echoed through the entire sky.

At this moment, the mouths of the humans and all the demon beasts in the surroundings couldn’t help but Twitch.

First, it ran away, then it begged for mercy.

Why did this proud king beast feel like a coward.

However, many insightful void tier experts had solemn expressions on their faces.

They could clearly see that the nameless sword demon had completely destroyed the demon soul’s aspect with his divine ability.

This powerful attack shocked many people.

Many people knew that the nameless sword demon had two attributes, but even if it was two attributes, it would definitely be a two-attribute divine ability if it used a divine ability to break the aspect.

Moreover, it would require the nameless sword demon’s strength to reach level two of the void interpretation realm.

Level two of the Void interpretation realm? A 26-year-old level two of the Void interpretation realm?

Moreover, this level two of the void interpretation realm was very likely to have the strength to contend against a level three of the void interpretation realm.

He could contend against a level three of the void interpretation realm at the age of 26? What kind of strength was this?

Many kings of weak dynasties were only at level three of the void interpretation realm. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

However, a 26-year-old youth had already reached it!

“If this nameless sword demon wants to establish a dynasty or even a sect after today’s battle, it won’t be more than five years. He’ll definitely be a powerful force in the flowing sea region!”

Some insightful emptiness realm experts thought to themselves.

With the strength that nameless sword demon displayed, it could be said to be heaven-defying. If he wanted to establish a force, there would definitely be countless people following him.

There would even be insightful emptiness realm experts coming over to seek refuge.

“Ah!”

At this moment, the Demon Soul’s miserable cry sounded. Everyone looked over and saw a four-meter-long wound on the demon soul’s abdomen.

The wound was half a meter deep and one could already see the demon soul’s internal organs.

“This genius King Beast, the young king of the Demon Beast clan, if he doesn’t escape, he will die here!”

“The nameless sword demon’s strength is too strong, it’s really hard to imagine!”

Looking at the heavily injured Demon Soul’s body, everyone was shocked.

The demon race was even more silent at this moment. The clamoring voices had completely disappeared.

The gap was too huge!

Now, even if it was an extraordinary level three or four demonic beast, they could see how big the gap was between their demon soul king and that human.

They didn’t have the ability to resist at all.

The Demon Soul King was trying his best to escape. It was actually the best choice.

“Brilliant Sun, Spirit Poison!”

At this moment, Wang Xian attacked the demon soul directly at a terrifying speed.

At the same time, he unleashed two more divine abilities.

Wang Xian’s entire body carried a terrifying attack power as he charged toward the demon soul.

Seeing Wang Xian charging toward him, the demon free sword was exuding a sense of deadly danger. It widened its eyes.

It was unable to defend against two or three types of divine abilities consecutively. Now, there were two more.

With Wang Xian’s current attack power, he could definitely kill it.

The Demon Soul also knew that it would definitely not be able to withstand his attack. What awaited it next would be death.

It was unwilling to accept this!

It never expected that the once-in-a-thousand-years Peerless Demon Beast, the Heaven’s Pride King Beast, would die after only 40 years.

It was really unwilling to accept this!

At this moment, the demon soul did something that no one expected.

“Roar!”

“I surrender, don’t kill me!”

It let out a pleading roar and knelt down in the air.

Back in the training ground, this human didn’t go all out to kill him because he wanted to take him as his mount.

Now, there was only one way to survive. become his mount and surrender.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian looked at the demon soul who was in an extremely miserable state and was kneeling in the air. The attack in his hands stopped.

He raised his eyebrows and a smile appeared on his face. “It would have been better if I had submitted to him back in the training ground. I wouldn’t have to suffer so much pain!”

When the demon soul heard Wang Xian’s words, it almost cried.

F * ck, he even insulted a beast at this time!

If it surrendered now, it would definitely be the first demon beast to surrender in history.

“Take This!”

Wang Xian moved his arm and threw a drop of divine dragon’s blood essence at it.

The Demon Soul felt the terrifying energy and will contained in the blood and its face kept changing.

However, looking at the sharp demon-free sword, it raised its head obediently and swallowed it into its stomach.

“King!”

In less than ten seconds, the demon soul lowered his arrogant head and called out respectfully to Wang Xian.

“Very good!”

Wang Xian revealed a satisfied expression.

“Demon Soul, you traitor, you cowardly thing!”

“Demon Soul, you are a heaven’s favorite king beast in vain. You are a good-for-nothing, you traitor!”

However, at this moment, the entire demon beast race was completely dumbfounded.

F * ck, Demon Soul wanted to submit to that human?

Their Heaven’s Pride King Beast submitted to the human.

This... This F * ck, this F * CK was simply a great humiliation to the Demon Beast Race!

More than ten insightful void level demon beasts of the demon Lin race roared towards the arena with furious faces.

What a shame! What a shame!

The Demon Soul turned around and looked at the Demon Beast tribe behind him. He roared and ignored them!

“Haha!”

Wang Xian laughed out loud. With a move of his arm, he threw the water healing ability towards the demon soul.

Following that, he continued to cast the water spirit.

Two powerful healing energies landed on the Demon Soul’s body, causing his serious injuries to heal slowly.
