Chapter 1577: 1577

“We pay our respects to young master ao Tian!”

In front of the empty seats in front of the competition, Bing Jing Huan followed behind the two heaven’s favorites and bowed respectfully to Ao Tian.

Just the two heaven’s favorites were enough to make him bow and scrape, let alone ao Tian, the son of the supreme headmaster of our sect.

“En!”

Ao Tian sat on the chair and glanced at Bing Jing Huan. His gaze landed on Ling Jian ‘er who flew out from the arena.

“Your Bing Jian ‘ER from the Bing Xin Empire is very good!”

He was not stingy with his praise and his face was full of smiles. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Bing Jing Huan was slightly stunned when he heard ao Tian’s words. He immediately squeezed out a smile, “She is very strong. Even I am not her match now!”

When he saw ao Tian staring at Bing Jian ‘ER’s figure, he suddenly had a guess. He was slightly shocked and his eyes were shining.

“I used to like Bing Jian ‘er, but father now wants to set her up with that priest Wang!”

He pursed his lips and stopped.

“A priest of light is not worthy of such a proud daughter!”

Ao Tian said indifferently.

“This is also arranged by my imperial father. I have no choice!”

Bing Jing Huan lowered her head slightly and said bitterly. The light in her eyes was somewhat dazzling.

“Bing Jing Huan, go and tell your imperial father that I have taken a liking to that Bing Jian ‘er lady. I will ask my father to propose marriage to Your Ice Heart Empire!”

As Ao Tian said this, a smile appeared on his face. “Such a proud daughter of the heavens can only be worthy of me, ao Tian!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a strong sense of self-confidence and an aura of superiority emanated from his body.

Bing Jing Huan took two steps back due to the impact of his aura. His expression changed slightly and he quickly nodded.

“It’s Young Master Ao Tian. I will go back immediately and pass your message to Father!”

As he spoke, his gaze shifted to the back.

Seeing how intimate Wang Xian and Ling Jian ‘er were, he was filled with jealousy.

“If I can’t get it, don’t even think about getting it. I’ll see what you can do about the person that young master ao Tian wants!”

His expression was ferocious as he roared in his heart. A twisted smile appeared on his face.

Bing Jinghuan’s figure moved and he immediately flew towards the location of the Bingxin Empire.

“Jian ‘er, it looks like you will be the first place in this competition!”

Wang Xian looked at Ling Jian ‘er and said with a smile on his face.

“Of course. I will let you see it during the finals tomorrow. I will definitely be the most dazzling one here!”

Ling Jian ‘er raised her head slightly and said proudly.

“Alright. When you win, I will give you a gift and a surprise!”

Wang Xian stroked her head lovingly and said happily.

After spending the past few days together, Ling Jian ‘ER’s heart clearly belonged to him. As long as he wanted to confess, given her current character, she would definitely not reject him.

“Alright, I’ll be waiting for your gift and surprise!”

Ling Jian ‘ER’s face was filled with joy as she nodded. The two of them walked out on foot.

“That Bing Jian ‘ER from the Iceheart Empire’s strength is really terrifying!”

“Why don’t you take a look at whose woman that is? It’s the woman of the saint of Light, the priest of the sage king. She has all sorts of cultivation resources and can be compared to a core disciple of a super faction!”

“Priest Wang is also a monstrous existence. Bing Jian ‘ER is naturally not too far off!”

“A match made in heaven, a perfect match!”

As the two of them walked on the road, the discussions of other young men could be heard from time to time.

Ling Jian ‘er did not get angry when she heard these voices. Instead, she was secretly delighted.

Wang Xian was in a good mood when he saw her expression.

However, what Wang Xian and Ling Jian ‘er did not expect was that Bing Jinghuan was standing in front of the king of Bingxin Empire in a room in the Bingxin Empire complex.

In the room, apart from the king of bingxin, there were two other elders.

Sitting in the middle was an energetic white-haired elder.

The elder seemed to be in a good mood.

“Jinghuan, why are you in such a hurry to come over? What’s the matter?”

The king of Bingxin looked at Bing Jinghuan and asked curiously.

“Father, ancestor, it’s young master ao Tian who asked me to come over. There’s something he wants me to tell Father!”

Bing Jing Huan lowered his head and said respectfully.

“Young Master Ao Tian? What is it?”

The king of Bingxin immediately asked in surprise.

“Young Master Ao Tian has taken a fancy to junior sister Jian ‘er. He asked me to tell you that soon, he will ask the supreme headmaster to propose marriage to our Bingxin Dynasty!”

Bing Jing Huan pursed his lips and said.

“What?”

Bingxin king was slightly stunned, his face full of astonishment.

The two old men beside him also slightly raised their eyebrows, full of surprise.

“Today, junior sister Jian ‘er killed a disciple of the second rank of the profound void sect in one move. With her strength, I’m afraid that she is not even as good as the two heaven’s favorites in the sky and the Earth!”

“In addition, junior sister Jian ‘Er is beautiful. Young Master Aotian said that only the daughter of the heaven’s favorites is worthy of him!”

Bing Jing Huan continued.

“This...”

King Bing Xin’s expression changed slightly, and he frowned. “Young Master Ao Tian really said that?”

“Yes, father. Perhaps soon, only our sect will be the supreme leader of the sect and propose a marriage!”

Bing Jing Huan nodded.

“When I saved Jian ‘er, I found that her talent was extraordinary. She will definitely be extraordinary in the future. I didn’t expect that she could suppress the proud son of Heaven of only our sect in just a few months. No wonder young master of only our sect was so moved. But, what about priest Wang?”

A long-haired elder beside the white-haired elder said with a frown.

If it were any other time, they would be very happy if the young master of our sect, Ao Tian, took a fancy to Bing Jian ‘er.

But now, there was a priest Wang.

In their opinion, although that priest Wang was far inferior to the young master of Ao Tian, after all, he had also saved an ancestor of their icy heart empire.

Restoring his strength to the eighth level of the profound void tier was a huge favor.

“Big Brother, what do you think?”

The long-haired old man looked at the white-haired old man and asked softly.

“This...”

The white-haired old man was slightly hesitant. He was cured by Wang Xian, but he was leaning towards young master ao Tian in his heart.

Young Master Ao Tian had an 80% chance of becoming the sect leader of the solipsistic sect in the future.

As for priest Wang, he was merely a relatively powerful priest. There was still a huge gap between the two.

Jian ‘er marrying the young lord of Ao Tian would be of great benefit to the icy heart dynasty.

“Father, patriarch, the relationship between the young lord of Ao Tian and priest Wang isn’t very good. A few days ago, there was almost a conflict. Fortunately, the crown prince of Wuqing City was present at that time!”

Bing Jing Huan looked at the hesitant expressions of the patriarch and his father and added on from the side.

“Oh? That priest Wang actually dared to provoke ao Tian?”

The white-haired elder raised his eyebrows and asked in surprise.

“Patriarch, according to our understanding of priest Wang, he is a fearless person. He used to fight against the two heaven’s pride experts of our sect. He didn’t give face to the Crown Prince of Wuqing City at all. He didn’t even fear the Wuji Dynasty!”

“It’s said that he doesn’t know fear, but it can also be said that he doesn’t know what’s good for him. He is a bit arrogant and arrogant!”

Ice Heart King said lightly.
