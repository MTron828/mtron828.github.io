3497 2,496 seconds. A Level 2 desolate beast, the Master of the universe

“Oh?”

When Wang Xian heard the words of the king of water tentacles, he was astonished.

Under his perception, he did not sense the existence of the desolate beast. However, the king of water tentacles actually sensed it?

Wang Xian could be said to be the water god Dragon and the Azure Dragon, but he did not sense it.

“Hehe, Dragon King, I am a Space Beast, an existence on the same level as the Divine Dragon. In fact, the space beast has something that other peak races can not compare to.”

“I, the water touch king, am very powerful when it comes to sensing in the water!”

The water touch king said confidently.

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly. At the river of Eternity, the Water Touch King’s perception had covered an extremely terrifying area.

Even when an lie went to pick the water lotus, he was easily sensed by the water touch king.

The ability of the water touch king could not be underestimated.

“Capture him!”

Wang Xian ordered the king of water tentacles.

“Alright, Dragon King, leave it to me!”

The king of water tentacles stirred up its tentacles. One of its eyes glowed and a water mirror appeared in front of it.

The plant-type dire beast seemed to have sensed danger and quickly fled into the distance.

However, at the next moment, a water mirror appeared in front of it and drilled into it.

At the next moment, it appeared in front of Wang Xian and the rest. The king of water tentacles waved his tentacles and killed it.

“What kind of ability is this?”

Wang Xian couldn’t help but ask when he saw his strange attack.

“It’s a talent that belongs to US Space Beasts.”

The king of water tentacles said.

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly. This kind of talent wasn’t something that other races could learn.

“He’s pretty amazing!”

He commented.

“That’s true. If not for that bird man possessing an innate treasure, I wouldn’t be in such a miserable state. When I recover, I will definitely pluck his bird feathers.”

The king of water tentacles said angrily.

Wang Xian smiled and continued to fly forward.

The king of water tentacles was slightly stronger than him in terms of his special sensing ability in the water. Therefore, Wang Xian decided to let her sense the surroundings.

A blanket search was very time-consuming. According to the Green Dragon Whisker Shadow and the rest, if one was unlucky, they might not be able to search for more than ten years.

However, if one was lucky, it might only take a few years or even less.

More than ten years was as short as more than ten months compared to the time outside of the heaven opening and primal continent.

Wang Xian was not in a hurry. If that senior had enough resources in the Dragon Palace, the resources he obtained would be able to accumulate a lot for his advancement.

Time passed day by day. In the blink of an eye, half a year had passed.

“Be careful, run this way!”

Suddenly, a terrified voice came from the left.

“Lord Dragon King, Lord Green Dragon Whisker Shadow, save me!”

A terrified voice with a cry for help was heard. Wang Xian looked over and saw the incipient saint wings appear on his back. It disappeared instantly.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

On the left, a strange and terrifying desolate beast was attacking an expert from the ancestral dragon lineage.

It was a water snake. The water snake was like a tree with a thick snake body.

On the body of this snake, there were numerous small snakes. These small snakes were like the branches of a tree as they covered the snake.

Looking at the countless water snakes, the great being of the ancestral dragon bloodline revealed a look of despair.

It was over!

The water snake, a level two universe master, couldn’t escape even if he wanted to!

“Beast, you are courting death!”

Just as he was in despair, a figure strangely appeared beside him.

Following that, an azure dragon head directly attacked the desolate beast.

At the same time, he saw a shadow flying over as well.

The shadow had terrifying tentacles with suction cups and sharp teeth.

“Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!”

Countless snake heads let out a hiss. They raised their heads and spat out water arrows. The water arrows were densely packed and covered the entire space around them.

The tai chi dragon coiled around the experts of the ancestral dragon lineage. Wang Xian’s figure disappeared in an instant.

“Let’s test the power of this skull cross-nail!”

His figure appeared above the water snake, and the energy from his body surged into his face.

A mask appeared, and a deep, dark cross-shaped object fell towards the strange water snake.

At the same time, the tentacles of the water-tentacle king tightly coiled around it.

Buzz

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss

The deep, dark cross-shaped object landed on the countless heads of the water snake. The heads of the water snake vanished in an instant. Fresh Blood and energy condensed into a strange, blood-red angel-like appearance.

The Angel was nailed to the cross. This made the power of the cross-nail increase by a lot.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss

The entire water snake shook the small snakes in a panic. However, it was unable to escape under the restraint of the king of water tentacles.

The cross-nail continued to descend. It penetrated the body of the water snake and killed it.

“What a powerful skull cross-nail. As expected of the innate spiritual treasure that killed the Archangel!”

Wang Xian had a look of astonishment in his eyes. He flew over and kept the corpse.

The skull cross Spike’s attack was relatively simple, but its power was indeed a little terrifying.

Especially when it hurt the enemy and formed a blood-red angel, its power increased exponentially.

“This… Lord Dragon King’s strength is so strong!”

At the back, the expert from the ancestral dragon lineage, who was a level one universe dominator, looked at Wang Xian in shock. He could not help but gulp.

A level two desolate beast, a master of the universe, was easily killed. It did not even have the chance to escape.

This strength was too terrifying!

He had only lasted a few seconds under the attack of this desolate beast.

This desolate beast could not even last a few seconds under the Dragon King’s attack.

“Sou Sou Sou!”

At this moment, the Azure Dragon Whisker Shadow and the rest flew over and swept their gaze over.

“Are You Alright?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Where’s that terrifying desolate beast?”

The Green Dragon Whisker Shadow and the rest asked in astonishment when they saw that expert.

“It has been killed by the Dragon King!”

That expert swallowed a mouthful of saliva and said with a shocked expression.

“Killed?”

The Green Dragon Whisker Shadow and the rest were slightly shocked and revealed an incredulous expression.

The second-level desolate beast, the universe dominator, had been killed?

In just a few seconds?

They immediately looked at Wang Xian in front of them. Their eyes were filled with shock.

“I’ve already taken care of it.”

Wang Xian looked at them and said with a smile.

“Brother Wang Xian, do you… do you have a powerful innate supreme treasure?”

Green Dragon Moon opened his mouth and could not help but ask.

“No, but I have a powerful weapon.”

Wang Xian smiled and said, “It won’t be a problem for me to kill a dire beast of the same level!”

“Impressive. With you around this time, the chances of us finding the Dragon Palace are much higher.”

Qing longxu Ying was slightly shocked and said in pleasant surprise.

They didn’t expect the Dragon King to be so powerful. No wonder he was able to force the hundred cities alliance to such an extent.

“Let’s continue.”

Wang Xian smiled and said.
