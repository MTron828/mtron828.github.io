3395 The 3394 Thundercloud vultures were shocked

“Tame them and treat them as war pets!”

Wang Xian looked at their excited expressions and said with a smile.

Currently, he had more than 800 thundercloud vultures in his hands.

Among them, there were 12 universe knights with seventh-level combat strength and above.

He was not prepared to take out these 12. He was prepared to give the rest to the Thundercloud vultures.

This could be considered as repaying the favor of the Thunder Ray tribe.

“Thank you, eldest senior brother. Eldest senior brother, did you encounter the nest of the Thunder Cloud Vultures this time? How did you obtain so many Thunder Cloud Vultures? Furthermore, you even managed to capture the Thunder Cloud Vultures with the attack power of a level seven universe Knight.”

Fourth senior sister asked with a face full of astonishment.

Each of them had given them a thunder cloud vulture with a corresponding strength. This meant that the number of thunder cloud vultures he had captured was definitely more than this.

“Yeah, I was lucky. I just happened to capture some!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly.

“This is not just luck. There’s also your formidable strength, eldest senior brother!”

Fourth senior sister sighed slightly.

Wang Xian smiled and chatted with them for a while. Before long, the group of girls left.

“Let’s go and look for the Deacons to help us tame the Thundercloud Vultures!”

The eight female disciples were filled with excitement as they went to look for their elders and deacons to help tame the Thundercloud Vultures.

Wang Xian was in the palace. He took out the universal AI and browsed through it.

Two days passed quickly.

This day was a grand occasion for the disciples of the Thunder Ray tribe.

The Banquet for their new senior brother of the Thunder Ray tribe was held today.

They were filled with admiration and shock towards this new eldest senior brother.

This was also an unprecedented eldest senior brother of their thunder ray tribe.

In less than two years after joining their Thunder Ray tribe in the 20th century, he had defeated their former eldest senior brother and obtained the position of eldest senior brother. It could be said that everyone was shocked.

It was located at the leisure area of the Thunder Ray race’s disciples. The entire huge venue was set up as a banquet venue.

Countless disciples had gathered here, and some deacons had also rushed over.

“Is eldest senior brother Wang Xian really that strong? He became eldest senior brother not long after joining our Thunder Ray Race?”

“Thunder Dragon? This is too enviable. I heard that he is a disciple of the ancestral dragon lineage. Why did he join our Thunder Ray Race?”

“The leader of the ancestral dragon lineage said that the ancestral dragon lineage would not gather unless there was a master disciple. Regardless of whether the ancestral dragon lineage could produce a master or not, it would only be beneficial for us if big senior brother Wang Xian joined us. I heard that the clan leader values him very much.”

“I wonder when big senior brother will come over!”

Countless disciples were discussing in the entire banquet venue.

In the Lightning race, not many had seen Wang Xian before. Ninety percent of the disciples had never seen him before.

Many disciples were filled with curiosity and surprise towards their new eldest senior brother.

Whoosh

At the entrance of the banquet, more than ten figures flew over.

The middle-aged man in the lead raised his head slightly. There was a strong sense of confidence on his face.

“Senior brother, you had a breakthrough a few days ago. Do you want to challenge him now to get back at him?”

From behind the middle-aged man, a middle-aged man said with a slightly heated gaze.

“Hehe, no. If it wasn’t for him this time around, I wouldn’t have been able to achieve a breakthrough. Today, I will give him some face. After a period of time, I will challenge him!”

The middle-aged man was Lei Yuntian, who was defeated by Wang Xian a year ago.

He was the eldest senior brother of the previous generation.

Compared to the previous time when he was defeated, he was now in high spirits. He was even more confident than before. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

That was because he had broken through!

A year ago, the pressure from Wang Xian and the teachings from the clan leader had allowed him to break through the shackles. Now, he had the combat strength of a level eight universe knight.

With such strength, he could be considered as one of the strongest in the Thunder Ray tribe.

“Senior brother, you are still merciful. Give him some face.”

The middle-aged man at the side said with a smile.

“Senior brother Lei!”

“Senior brother!”

Lei Yuntian’s arrival attracted the attention of the surrounding disciples.

When they saw Lei Yuntian, their eyes flickered and they bowed respectfully.

No matter what, although Lei Yuntian had lost, he was still their second senior brother. He was also worthy of their respect.

However, they were a little puzzled. Senior Brother Lei Yuntian seemed to be in a good mood!

“Buzz, Buzz, Buzz!”

Not long after Lei Yuntian arrived, the third senior brother of the current lightning race, the former second senior brother, also flew over.

“Hehe, it’s a pity that I didn’t see the last battle between senior brother and eldest senior brother. I didn’t expect such a powerful figure to suddenly appear in our lightning race.”

Second Brother came to Lei Yuntian’s side and said with a smile.

“He is indeed very strong!”

Lei Yuntian agreed and didn’t tarnish his reputation in the slightest.

“Oh? To be able to make senior brother Lei Yuntian say this, then this new eldest brother is really quite strong.”

Second Brother raised his eyebrows.

“Buzz Buzz Buzz!”

At this moment, while they were talking, figures arrived one by one.

More than ten elders, led by the first elder, arrived. They hovered around and scanned the group of disciples with smiles on their faces.

“HMM? The first elder and the rest are here. To think that so many elders have arrived!”

“It seems that the elders have attached great importance to the new eldest senior brother this time around!”

“I heard that after Wang Xian advances to the eldest senior brother, he can choose any treasures in our clan’s Treasury!”

The group of disciples saw the elders appearing in front of them and whispered among themselves.

“They’re here!”

At this moment, the group of elders who were laughing and chatting in front of them suddenly raised their heads and looked up.

“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”

The chirping sound of the Thundercloud Vulture was heard and instantly attracted the attention of all the other disciples!

“That’s? Thundercloud vulture, a seventh level universe Knight’s Thundercloud Vulture?”

“What’s going on? Fourth senior sister, senior sister Lei Yun Zi, why do they each have a thunder cloud vulture?”

“Eight Thunder Cloud Vultures? HM, that powerful? I’ve never heard of fourth senior sister and the others having Thunder Cloud Vultures!”

Shocked voices came from the disciples’mouths, and they looked over in shock.

Thunder Cloud vultures, it could be said that all the disciples and warriors of the entire thunder race wanted to obtain battle pets the most.

However, they were rare in numbers and possessed great speed and alertness. As a result, there were only a few dozen Thundercloud vultures war pets in the entire thunderlight race.

Now, fourth senior sister and the rest of the eight of them rode the Thundercloud vultures and came over, causing all the disciples to be extremely shocked.

“That’s eldest senior brother!”

Very soon, someone’s gaze landed on Wang Xian who was in the middle and spoke.

Most of the disciples’gazes were focused on Wang Xian.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the large number of disciples below. A smile appeared on his face. When he landed at the position of the elders, he cupped his hands.

“Elder!”

He greeted.

“Let’s take a look here. The main character today is you. Say a few words to the disciples!”

The great elder looked at Wang Xian with a smile and gestured to him.
