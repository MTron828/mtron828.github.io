Chapter 155: Nine Dragons Royal Carriage (1)

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Hiss!

Just when Wang Xian was staring at the venomous sea snakes, they stuck out their tongues slowly and wriggled out from the caves. With cold and sharp eyes, they glared at him as they squeezed their bodies together.

These venomous sea snakes are thinking of devouring me!

As Wang Xian sensed the look from the venomous sea snakes, he slowly retreated.

Nine Level-Ten venomous sea snakes were something of a threat to him. Especially when these snakes were much stronger than Roving Heavens.

Wang Xian could suppress Roving Heavens, but he had to be careful when facing these venomous sea snakes.

The venomous sea snakes wanted to devour him as a lower level Divine Dragon. If they could devour him, they could turn into dragons immediately!

Gobble him up!

Just as Wang Xian’s thoughts were running, the venomous sea snake at the center threw its coiled body at him at a fast speed.

The intelligent snakes decided to join forces and attack him.

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly. He swiped his tail gently, creating a muddy swamp area with streams of water currents.

But to his surprise, the nine venomous sea snakes were moving as fast as him.

“After all, they have the bloodline of Wind Divine Dragon. Even Thunder Dragon could not compare its speed with them.”

Wang Xian showed a stern look on his face. Seeing the incoming attack from the nine venomous sea snakes, he swept his tail across.

All the snakes were about five meters long, and their bodies were thicker than a human thigh. But they were smaller than Wang Xian.

Bam!

The mighty Divine Dragon Power swept three venomous sea snakes more than ten meters away.

But the fourth venomous sea snake opened its bloody mouth and bit onto Wang Xian’s tail with its black teeth.

The immediate numbness stiffened up Wang Xian’s body.

At the same time, the other five venomous sea snakes widened their lips just to chew at his body.

Hiss!

Wang Xian felt the immense pain as he sensed the poisonous teeth sinking into his body.

“This is bad. Their intelligence is too high to have a perfect joint attack.”

Wang Xian had a slight expression change. The nine venomous sea snakes seemed to know what each other was thinking such that they could achieve a perfect attack.

Drops of fresh blood were absorbed by five poisonous snakes. If they did not bite on the body part which had the most robust defense, his injuries might be more serious.

“Get lost!” Wang Xian exclaimed, and the five colors on his body were flashing violently. Finally, his body turned green.

Green, the wood attributes of the Divine Dragon with anti-poison effect.

Roar!

Wang Xian widened his mouth and spurted a gust of green gas from it.

Sss!

The intense wood attributes gave off a sizzling sound when they hit the venomous sea snakes.

Hiss!

The six venomous sea snakes were in pain as they quickly loosened their bite and retreated.

Wang Xian jerked, releasing the green gas from his body, and his injuries were slowly recovering.

Hiss!

The nine venomous sea snakes stared at Wang Xian ferociously as they surrounded him once again.

Wang Xian stared back at them with icy cold eyes. He swayed his green body and cast a glance at the black seaweed in the surrounding area.

Roar!

This time, Wang Xian decided to strike before them. The green wood attributes spread out to the surroundings.

Whoosh!

Just then, the seaweed around them began to grow exponentially. Thousands of seaweeds twisted and slid towards the nine venomous sea snakes.

Hiss!

The venomous sea snakes swished and swam rapidly towards Wang Xian for an attack again.

“Ignorant!” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Wang Xian exuded a rich and immense green gas, causing the surrounding water plants to grow frantically.

It was as though the Wood Release* from the First Hokage in the Naruto Manga Series. [1]

Even though he had yet to master the ability to trap his opponent with massive wood, he could control the seaweed growing frantically within more than ten meters.

Hiss!

The nine venomous sea snakes swirled their bodies as they avoided the seaweed. But the amount was too substantial such that they could not move.

“You can’t stop us...die!”

A venomous sea snake stuck out its tongue as it quickly struggled out from the seaweed.

I’m still too weak. The seaweed cannot hold them for long!

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly. He got an idea.

“You are asking for your own death!”

As Wang Xian waved his dragon claws in the water, all the seaweed around him gathered and entwined together, trapping nine venomous sea snakes in a semi-circle.

Bam!

A snake tried to bash its way through a small hole.

They were, in fact, just poisonous snakes without any claws. As such, they would need at least ten seconds to break out from the trap.

“Now!”

Wang Xian took a deep breath. This move determined success. If he failed, he’d need to be stronger before he came back here again.

The radiance on his body flashed again before he turned into a blue marine dragon.

“Suck!”

He opened his mouth and sucked up all the lake water in the area surrounded by the seaweed.

A vacuum area was created at the bottom of the lake.

The venomous sea snakes were petrified as they quickly struggled out of the seaweed.

“Go to hell!”

With an icy cold look, he could only barbeque this bunch of ignorant fellows.

The colors on his body switched again. The Inferno Dragon was exuding blazing hot flames.

As the lake water seethed, he opened his mouth and spat out a Dragon Ball. The Dragon Ball charged and attacked the area surrounded by the seaweed.

“Cremation!”

Flames of more than ten meters were fired off and landed on the black seaweeds.

Boom!

As all the lake water was already sucked up by Wang Xian, the entire area was burning in the fire as soon as the flame landed on the seaweed.

The bottom of the lake was on fire.

From the top, the entire lake looked like a red, fiery volcano ready to erupt. It was horrifying.

Whoo-hoo!

Wang Xian returned to the Azure Dragon form as he panted slightly. After releasing a few of the high-consumption attacks in one go, it was tedious for him too.

In Azure Dragon form, he could quickly rejuvenate himself.

The flame burned, seething the lake water. The entire bottom of the lake formed a fascinating picture.

Hiss!

Wang Xian stared coldly as he heard the dreadful cries from the venomous sea snakes in the sea.

The flame slowly reduced under the control of the Dragon Ball.

Shoo!

At this time, the Dragon Ball flew back into Wang Xian’s mouth as he devoured it.

The fire disappeared. All the seaweed within a hundred meters was turned into ashes.

The nine venomous sea snakes were bound in the middle with their heads leaning against each other.

A burning smell came from their bodies as they were covered by a thick layer of blood.

What a pathetic scene.

However, they did not die. They leaned against each other and resisted the fearsome fire attack of the Dragon Ball.

Even so, they were seriously injured, hugging themselves together lifelessly.

The harshness in their eyes had completely disappeared.

Wang Xian was shocked by what he saw. The assault that he had performed was equivalent to three Level-six Divine Dragons striking out together. Yet, they were only seriously wounded.

In that case...!

His eyes glinted and he said three words slowly:

“Surrender or die!”
