3255 3254, the four dragon palaces were suppressing

Crack Crack Crack

Wang Xian swayed his body, and streams of terrifying energy rushed towards his surroundings.

The entire dragon body was shining with eight rays of light, and each of them emitted a powerful pressure.

The combat strength of a universe knight at level seven.

This time, the improvement allowed him to directly increase by two levels.

From level five to level seven.

He smiled as he felt the powerful strength in his body.

“With my current situation and the improvement of the Dragon Palace, the Dragon Palace can definitely step into the heaven-splitting chaotic land!”

Wang Xian muttered.

His improvement this time had also allowed the Dragon Palace to directly cross the surrounding starry skies and enter the heaven-splitting chaotic land.

There was another terrifying aspect to Wang Xian’s upgrade this time.

That was that in the future, the water tribe in the universe and the ya long below the level of a universe knight would not be able to resist him at all. They would all be under his control.

“I should be invincible in the galaxy, right?”

He mumbled and smiled.

With the offensive power of a universe knight at level seven and the terrifying speed of the incipient sacred wings, his strength was considered invincible among level seven existences.

A Universe Knight at level seven was already sufficient to lead his race into the heaven-opening primeval continent.

After quietly feeling his own strength, Wang Xian transformed into his human form. With a move of his palm, the mystical oil lamp appeared in his palm.

“The more I look at it, the more mystical it feels. This material, even with my current strength, is unable to make any traces of it appear.”

Wang Xian mumbled.

The oil lamp had been extinguished. Other than being sturdy and mystical, it had no other uses.

He looked at the center of the oil lamp with a hesitant look in his eyes.

There was a small hole in the middle of the oil lamp. It seemed to be the place where the wick was inserted. However, this place had already disappeared.

There should be some special energy placed around it. There was nothing else in it now.

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment. He moved his body and waved his arm. An endless piece of wood from the ancestral tree behind the Dragon Chair flew over.

He took a small piece of wood and inserted it into the small hole of the oil lamp.

Following that, he waved his arm and a large amount of vitality liquid flew over from the Moon Bay in the ancient pond and entered the oil lamp.

Buzz

The next moment, the entire oil lamp emitted a luster. Fiery Red Flames appeared and burned slowly.

At this moment, Wang Xian sensed that he had a special connection with the ancient lamp.

Buzz

With a thought, the entire oil lamp landed on his shoulder as if it was growing there.

The fiery red light enveloped him and formed a protective shield around him.

Looking at the entire protective shield, he raised his eyebrows slightly. With a thought, the five elements millstone flew out.

“Bang!”

The five elements millstone collided with the fiery red protective shield with a loud sound.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and ordered the five elements millstone to attack.

“Boom!”

A terrifying collision sound was heard. Wang Xian could feel that the vitality liquid in the oil lamp had decreased a little.

“This…”

A look of surprise appeared on his face. He made the five elements millstone unleash its strongest attack.

Boom

A terrifying collision rang out. The fire shield still did not have the slightest fluctuation. Furthermore, under Wang Xian’s sensing, the life force liquid in the oil lamp had decreased by less than 1% .

Was it that sick?

His eyes revealed an extremely astonished expression.

A full-strength strike from the five elements grinding could kill a level five universe knight, yet it was blocked so easily.

Most importantly, Wang Xian didn’t do anything just now.

In other words, as long as he carried this oil lamp and stood there without moving, he could withstand a level five universe Knight’s attack?

Furthermore, the consumption of the life force fluid in the oil lamp was related to the attack he suffered.

According to the life force liquid that Wang Xian placed earlier, he could withstand more than a dozen attacks from a level seven universe knight if he stood still.

Impressive!

“This oil lamp is definitely not simple. It feels even stronger than a acquired true treasure. Could it be a legendary innate treasure?”

He clicked his tongue and his eyes were shining.

However, this could also be related to the wick and the energy. After all, the wick was an inexhaustible wood at the level of a universe knight.

The energy was also the life liquid of the ancient Moon Bay of the universe knight level.

“It’s very strong. It’s a treasure with a terrifying defense.”

Wang Xian mumbled. With a wave of his arm, he placed half of the life liquid in the Moon Bay into the oil lamp.

With so much life liquid in it, who knew what level of attack it could withstand?

He muttered to himself and suddenly had a thought.

“An lie!”

He shouted directly and his voice was transmitted to an lie.

“Dragon King!”

Soon, an Lie’s figure appeared in the Dragon King’s Hall and bowed respectfully.

Buzz

Wang Xian waved his arm and the oil lamp on his shoulder landed on an Lie’s body.

“Eh? Dragon King, what is this?”

An lie looked at the oil lamp that was emitting a flame cover and revealed a surprised expression.

“A defensive treasure. Didn’t you say that you can connect to many devil spirit altars? You can directly teleport over and take away the devil spirit altars to increase your strength.”

Wang Xian said to him.

“Dragon King, do you mean that you want me to take this defensive treasure to absorb other devil spirit altars?”

An Lie’s eyes lit up as he said with excitement.

His current strength could be said to be the weakest in the Dragon Palace.

With the strength of a level three void God Emperor, this universe Knight could kill him with just a glance.

His improvement required the special energy on the devil spirit altar, but this energy was very rare, which was why his strength had never increased.

If he wanted to increase his strength, he had to teleport to the other devil spirit altars.

He had been there before, but he almost lost his life.

Blood flowed out of his eyes, ears, nose, and mouth in an instant. He did not dare to take the risk anymore.

Now that he had the protection of the oil lamp, he did not have to worry too much.

According to Wang Xian’s estimation, the energy in the oil lamp should be enough to withstand a strike from a peak universe knight.

As long as he could withstand it for an instant, an lie would be able to escape instantly.

An Lie’s strange ability was of great use to the Dragon Palace.

Even now, Wang Xian wasn’t as fast as him on the journey.

“Okay, go. Be careful. If you encounter an existence on the level of a universe master, you probably won’t be able to return.”

Wang Xian reminded him.

A Universe Master could kill an lie in an instant. The energy in the oil lamp wasn’t enough to withstand an attack from a universe master.

“It’s Dragon King, I’ll be careful.”

An lie shrunk his neck and said.

He still cherished his life very much.

If it was anyone else, they would have already taken the risk and entered other demon spirit altars to increase their strength. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m
