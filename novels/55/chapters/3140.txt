Chapter 3141: 3140 nine swords escaped

“The experts of the nine swords race are here!”

“The nine swords race is here to support us. F * ck, kill the intruders of the Dragon Palace.”

“Hahaha, Kill, Kill, Kill!”

When the experts of the dragon race heard the voice of the chief of the nine swords race, they were extremely excited.

Although the Dragon Palace was strong now, it was not strong enough to destroy them easily.

With the support of the nine swords race, they could definitely resist the attack of the Dragon Palace.

“Patriarch of the nine swords race, help me!”

The patriarch of the Dragon tribe heaved a heavy sigh of relief when he heard this voice.

He looked at the experts of the Dragon Palace in front of him with an embarrassed expression. His hair was somewhat white.

A part of the mountain beast under him had already collapsed. If they continued to fight, the entire mountain beast would collapse.

At that time, he would also be surrounded and killed by the Great Beings of Dragon Palace.

“Alright!”

The leader of the nine-blade race replied. His gaze swept over, and his pupils constricted.

“Five universe knights, level two beings.”

His heart sank, and his face was filled with fear. He moved and flew toward the leader of the dragon race.

He was like a sharp sword that cut through the sky, emitting a terrifying and dangerous aura.

“Humph, I didn’t expect that you nine swords would come here. Just in time, I will capture you two races in one go!”

Seeing the nine swords clan leader flying over, a cold expression appeared in the sky array’s eyes.

“Destroy our two races? Dragon Palace, don’t be arrogant.”

The Nine Swords clan leader roared with a gloomy face, and a dazzling divine sword covered in lightning shot out from his body.

“Huala!”

The Divine Sword left a mark and headed straight for the sky array.

The sky array had a serious expression on his face. He waved his hand and the array formations bombarded the sky array one by one.

“Boom!”

A violent collision sound was heard.

“Dragon King!”

On Xiao Lan’s body, prime minister turtle frowned slightly when he saw the experts of the nine swords clan coming.

“Do it!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and locked his gaze on the Universe Knight of the nine swords race.

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure disappeared instantly.

“Wu Wu Wu!”

Xiao Lan and the rest of the small house let out a low groan when they received the order.

A terrifying sound reverberated throughout the entire world.

Their incomparably huge bodies crashed directly towards the mountain peak below.

“Not good, brothers of nine swords, help us block these two terrifying space beasts!”

Below, the elders and protectors of the dragon-born race saw that Little Blue’s small house had started to move. Their expressions changed slightly, and they immediately shouted at all the great beings of the nine swords race.

“You want us to deal with two universe Knight Level Space Beasts?”

The million great beings of the nine swords race looked over, and their expressions changed slightly.

“Attack and stop them.”

However, the Great Beings of the nine-blade race didn’t refuse. They had a universe knight, 30 pinnacle God Emperor Great Beings, and other elite disciples.

They could totally fight against two universe knights.

“Leave this one to me, and the rest to you.”

The Level One universe Knight of the nine-blade race was surrounded by godly swords, and he stared at little blue coldly.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang

He waved his arm and countless godly swords appeared in the sky. They covered Xiao Lan and attacked her directly.

Huala

Pu

“It’s not your turn to die yet, and you are here to court death?”

Suddenly, the body of the Level 1 universe knight from the nine swords race stiffened. He widened his eyes and was filled with shock.

Wang Xian’s figure appeared behind him and his dragon claws pierced through his body.

With his current speed, if a universe knight Level 1 was not fully prepared, he would definitely be killed instantly.

“Oh no, master soul sword has been killed.”

“Master Soul Sword!”

Wang Xian suddenly appeared behind a master and instantly killed him.

Not far away, the millions of masters of the nine swords race were slightly shocked. They were shocked when they saw this scene.

“How can this be!”

The nine-blade race had just arrived here and participated in the battle, yet a knight of their nine-blade race was killed in an instant?

This was their nine-blade Knight.

He was one of the only two knights left.

Weng

Seeing Soul Sword Knight’s corpse being put away, the bodies of all the nine-blade race members trembled and were on the verge of collapse.

A knight who had just arrived was instantly killed.

What about them?

At this time, there was a universe knight level 2 being hunting them, what was going on with the Dragon Race?

“Wu Wu Wu!”

At this time, Little Blue and little house suppressed them, that terrifying aura made them all tremble slightly.

“Attack, Attack!”

The faces of the nine blade race members changed drastically, shouting sternly. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Hong! Hong! Hong

In the next moment, terrifying attacks flew towards little blue and little house.

Their bodies gave off a grey energy and shook slightly.

Hong

Before the attacks landed on them, they turned into nothingness.

Little House and Little Blue were the pinnacle void beasts of the universe.

With their current strength, they could kill a Level 1 universe knight in a one-on-one fight.

How could they fight him.

“Not good, dragon-descendant race, come and help us!”

Seeing this, the leader of the sword group shouted in fear.

“Now!”

An elder of the dragon-descendant race who was commanding noticed the situation here and his heart trembled. He had a bad feeling.

However, at this time, they couldn’t help.

“Immediately, my ass. All disciples of the nine-sword race, run!”

The leader of the sword group’s expression changed drastically as he shouted sternly.

Facing a supreme-level space beast, they didn’t have any time to hesitate.

Either they resisted, or everyone would die.

Not to mention, there was an existence beside them that could kill a supreme-being in an instant.

At this moment, he didn’t hesitate at all and directly gave the order to run.

At the same time, he waved his arm and a sword umbrella rose into the air. It enveloped all the disciples of the nine-sword race and created a space for them to avoid being interrupted.

The sword umbrella contained a powerful force. It was obviously a acquired Numinous Treasure.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

In the next moment, all the disciples of the nine-sword race escaped.

They escaped!

All of them escaped!

Wang Xian, who was not far away, looked at them with a stunned expression.

“F * ck!”

Some of the powerhouses from the dragon-descendant race swept their gaze across them. Their expressions were also abnormally ugly.

“Damn it, how could this be? There are still level 2 universe knights in the Dragon Palace who have yet to make a move?”

In the middle, the nine-sword clan leader saw the situation and sensed the death of Soul Sword Knight. His eyes instantly turned blood-red as he roared loudly.

“This…”

The leader of the Dragon Tribe looked over and his heart trembled violently.

“Both your tribes must be destroyed!”

Wang Xian looked at the leaders of the two tribes and said coldly.

After he finished speaking, he flew towards them.

“What a fast speed!”

Sensing Wang Xian’s terrifying speed, the leader of the Nine Swords clan clenched his fists tightly. His eyes sparkled.

Buzz

The next moment, his figure started to turn illusory.

The chief of the nine swords clan was about to escape as well.
