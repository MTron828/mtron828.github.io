Chapter 1441: 1441 war 4

“Come out and accept your death!”

Crown Prince Tang Xuewen stared at the castle and shouted loudly again.

“Accept your death! You people from the Sky Sword sect, the Dragon-phoenix dynasty, the Light Dragon Dynasty, and the blood stream sect, come out and accept your death!”

“Haha, how Dare You Be So arrogant in our blood stream empire! Crawl out and accept your death!”

“A bunch of trash, get out and kneel down and accept your death!”

As soon as the Crown Prince finished his words, the surrounding citizens shouted loudly towards the castle.

In an instant, the sounds of mockery and abuse resounded in the surrounding sky.

“Everyone from the blood flow empire, at least we are guests. I wonder what you are doing?”

At this moment, Wang Xian, Feng Luan, sect Master Ling, and the rest slowly walked out from the position of the castle.

Wang Xian glanced at the blood emperor and the three emperors at the front. Then, he looked at the people around him and asked indifferently.

When the leader of the Blood Stream sect and the king of the Kingdom of light saw the experts around them, their expressions changed slightly. Their eyes were filled with fear.

“What are you doing? Of course I’m going to kill all of you!”

The Blood Emperor was riding on his dragon horse. He looked down at Wang Xian in his military uniform and said coldly.

“To be able to reach the sixth level of the void interpretation realm before the age of 30 is truly unparalleled in history. It’s a pity that such a heaven’s favorite is going to die in our bloody flow imperial city today!”

An emperor at the side sized up Wang Xian and said slowly.

“Hehe, don’t speak too early. It’s easy to slap your face!”

Wang Xian smiled and stared at them with his arms crossed!

“Huh?”

When the king of the Kingdom of Light Dragon and sect master Yi saw how calm Wang Xian was, their pale faces turned slightly better. They moved closer to Wang Xian.

“Is that the Supreme Heaven’s pride, the peerless genius at level six of the Seethrough Void Tier?”

“That’s him. His name is Wang Xian. He’s not even thirty years old today. I have to say, his strength is simply heaven-defying!”

“So what if he is heaven-defying? He will not live past today. This is the outcome of provoking our bloody flow empire!”

“I really want to see a heaven’s pride being killed like this. Haha!”

Around them, the citizens of the bloody flow empire said mockingly.

“Today, I will let the world know the outcome of disobeying our bloody flow empire!”

“Our Bloody Flow Empire announces that the Heaven Sword sect, the Dragon-phoenix Empire, the Light Dragon Empire, and the bloody flow sect will be sentenced to death. After killing all of you, the Army of the Bloody Flow Empire will destroy all of your forces!”

Sitting on the dragon horse, the Blood Emperor announced with a cold expression.

“Blood Emperor, we are here to discuss the matter with the demonic beasts. The demonic beasts have not been resolved yet, and there is already an internal war?”

Sect Master Ling’s expression changed slightly when he heard the blood emperor’s words. He stared at them and said.

“The Demonic Beasts’matter will be resolved by the blood flow empire. However, if you dare to disobey us, you will die!”

The Blood Emperor looked at sect leader Ling and did not give him any explanation. He slowly raised the blood-red spear in his hand!

“What will happen to those who disobey our blood flow empire?”

The Blood Emperor raised the spear and roared loudly.

“Die!”

An ice-cold shout sounded from behind him. It was the voice of the insightful emptiness realm experts filled with killing intent.

As the voice sounded, the surrounding air seemed to freeze!

“Blood Emperor’s domineering aura!”

“Die!”

“Die! Those who offend our blood flow empire will be killed no matter how far they are!”

“Die!”

When the surrounding people of the blood flow empire saw the blood emperor’s domineering judgement, their faces were filled with excitement as they shouted loudly from the side.

“Clang!”

Sect leader Ling’s expression changed slightly. A golden longsword directly appeared in his hand as he stared solemnly at the blood emperor. “If you fight in your blood flow imperial city, your entire Imperial City will turn into nothingness!”

“Hehe, do you think that we are not prepared? I don’t like to talk too much with a person who is about to die, even if you are experts of the sixth level of the profound void tier!”

“Remember, don’t provoke our blood flow imperial city in your next life!”

“Weng!”

As the Blood Emperor spoke, he directly rose into the air, floating in the air for a hundred meters.

“Formation, Rise!”

An emperor lightly shouted.

“Buzz Buzz Buzz!”

A slight trembling sound was heard. A water-blue formation covered an area of more than 1,000 meters around the castle.

“The formation of the seventh level of the Void interpretation stage was originally prepared to deal with the demonic beasts. Congratulations, you guys have used it on yourselves!”

The Blood Emperor said to Wang Xian and the rest with a smile on his face.

This formation was bought by him through the relationship between the life and Death Elixir Workshop and the Saint Item Forging workshop.

It was originally used to defend against the Demon Beast clan, but now it was put to good use.

“What? A level seven insightful void array formation? You actually obtained a level seven insightful void Array Formation!”

The Light Dragon King’s expression changed greatly. His gaze swept across the surrounding water-blue rain shield, and his expression was extremely unsightly.

“Boom!”

A black skull scepter appeared in sect master Yi’s hand from a position to the side, and he directly attacked towards the sky.

However, his attack didn’t even cause a ripple when it landed on the array.

“Don’t waste your time. Today, I want everyone to see what will happen to the enemies of the blood flow empire!”

The Blood Emperor had a mocking expression on his face as he slowly moved forward.

The array enveloped Wang Xian and the rest. Similarly, the blood emperor, three emperors, and nearly 300 insightful emptiness realm powerhouses were also inside the array. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

This force could easily destroy sect leader Wang Xian and the 50 to 60 insightful void martial artists of Feng Luan.

Seeing the blood emperor move, more than 300 insightful void martial artists immediately took out their weapons.

In this slightly crowded area, it was difficult for Wang Xian and the rest to resist!

“Kill them and tear them into pieces!”

Crown Prince Tang Xue Wen roared.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Waves of energy instantly erupted within the formation.

The Blood Emperor and the three emperors moved the weapons in their hands. The battle was about to start.

At this moment, even sect leader Ling’s expression was extremely ugly when facing the experts from the blood flow empire.

It was a disaster!

“The Blood Flow Empire is invincible. Kill them!”

Around them, the people from the blood flow empire roared with excitement.

“TSK tsk, don’t be so excited!”

Wang Xian looked at the people of blood flow empire who were about to make a move, as well as sect leader Ling and the others who were nervous. He smiled faintly and swept his gaze across the blood emperor and the three blood emperors!

“Blood Emperor, do you think I’m not prepared?”

He said in a relaxed manner.

“HMM?”

The blood emperor frowned slightly when he saw how calm Wang Xian was.

“Haha, Ready? Wang Xian, Supreme Heaven’s pride expert, don’t worry. I have made preparations for you too. After you die, I will hang your head on the Heaven’s pride stage of the demi-human cemetery. Haha!”

In front of the group of insightful void martial artists, Crown Prince Tang Xuewen roared with laughter.

“Your Highness Crown Prince, Let us kick his head like a rubber ball!”

A young man in the surroundings shouted with laughter.

“I permit you to provoke our blood flow empire. I don’t care if you are a Peerless Heaven’s favorite or a monster from ancient times. All of You Must Die!”

Tang Xuewen shouted loudly.

When Wang Xian heard their words, his expression turned cold.

“Kill! I want to see if you can kill us or if we can kill all of you in the blood flow Imperial City First!”

He roared and gave an order.

“Arrogant! Your dog head will be on my feet later...”

Outside, when the young man who shouted saw Wang Xian giving the order to fight against the Blood Emperor and the other powerhouses of the blood flow empire, a look of disdain appeared on the young man’s face.

However, before he could finish his sentence, he seemed to have seen his own body.

A body that was separated from his head.

His eyes widened in disbelief.

Even before he died, he still did not understand why he had been killed!

“Ahhhh!”!

What followed was a scream that he would never be able to hear.

The Scream came from around him.

Ao Yao led a group of strange demons and moved!
