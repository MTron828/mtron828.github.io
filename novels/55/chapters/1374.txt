Chapter 1375: 1375 Xiaoyao City

“Dragon King, you’re back!”

Prime Minister Gui greeted him respectfully when he returned to the Dragon Palace.

“Well, how have you been these past few days?”

The corpses of the four dynasties had been sent to the Dragon Pool after ten days of absence.

There were fifty-five corpses, more than fifty of which were at the profound void tier. This energy might not be able to increase the strength of the members of the Dragon Palace who were at the profound void tier by much.

However, it was sufficient to increase the strength of the members who were at the half-step void interpretation level.

“Dragon King, there are more than 500,000 corpses. A total of 500 members of the Dragon Palace have successfully broken through to the void interpretation level. The rest of the members are all at the half-step void interpretation level!”

Prime Minister Gui said with a smile.

“More than 500? Not Bad, not bad at all. I still have some corpses here. Continue to increase your strength!”

Wang Xian revealed a satisfied expression. With a wave of his arm, he threw a few interspatial rings to Prime Minister Gui.

There were tens of thousands of corpses here. All of them came from the Howling Wind dynasty.

“It’s the Dragon King. With these resources, our dragon palace has at least 550 insightful void stage powerhouses!”

Prime Minister GUI looked at the resources inside and revealed an excited expression.

Wang Xian nodded with a smile. “How many members have the Dragon Palace increased during this period of time?”

“Dragon King, we have already become the kings of this sea area. After opening the Dragon Gate, under the attraction of the Dragon Gate, a total of more than 500 creatures have broken through the Dragon Gate!”

“In addition, I have sent people to the remaining level one dragon palace on Earth to pick up 200 members who have broken through the Dragon Palace. Currently, the number of members of our Dragon Palace is close to 4,000!”

Prime Minister GUI reported.

“Alright, transfer them all to the current combat divisions to increase their strength!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

4,000 members of the Dragon Palace and 550 experts at the level of the Void interpretation realm.

The rest were all at the half-step void interpretation realm. This power was already very terrifying.

Because the members of the Dragon Palace possessed the bloodline of the Divine Dragon, they had the ability to fight against those of a higher level.

Even if it was very difficult for a half-step void interpretation realm to surpass their level by one level, ten half-step void interpretation realm members of the Dragon Palace could definitely fight against one level one void interpretation realm expert.

And more than 500 level one void interpretation realm experts could fight against a level two void interpretation realm expert.

If the current strength of the Dragon Palace was calculated according to the top dynasties and dynasties in the Liuhai region.

The Light Dragon Dynasty was one of the top dynasties, and there were only more than 200 void interpretation realm experts in the dynasty.

As the only dynasty in the blood flow region, the blood flow empire only had around 1,000 insightful emptiness realm experts.

The current strength of the Dragon Palace could be ranked in the top three in the flowing sea region. Of course, there was still a huge gap between them and the blood flow empire.

“The medicinal pills and the like that I obtained from the four dynasties can be converted into one billion dragon crystals. However, I’m still nine billion away from leveling up. This is too much!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. If he wanted to level up, he would need to plunder 40 empires to gather 10 billion dragon crystals.

This was only to level up to the second level of the void interpretation realm. If he wanted to level up to the third level of the void interpretation realm, he would need the resources of an empire.

However, he was not in a hurry. The transcendence continent was huge.

There were at least a few thousand empires.

There were also fifty to sixty dynasties and five empires behind them.

“It’s really difficult to upgrade the level of the Divine Dragon. However, it’s fortunate that the Dragon Palace is here. If I were to cultivate in the dragon palace for a day, I would have more than 10,000 Dragon Crystals!”

Wang Xian shook his head and flew into the bedroom. When he saw a few girls cultivating, he rushed over with a smile.

In the next few days, Wang Xian lived a happy life again.

He spent 60% of his time on the bed.

Buzz! Buzz

On the tenth day, Feng Luan sent a message to Wang Xian’s communication stone plate.

“More than 60 city lords of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire and the major families and forces of the empire are here to pay their respects. Are you guys going to go and take a look?” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Wang Xian asked the group of girls.

“Alright, Alright. We heard from sister Fengluan that there will be hundreds of thousands of people coming to the dragon and Phoenix Empire in the next few days!”

Guan Shuqing and the group of girls immediately smiled and nodded.

“Alright, let’s go. Mou Zesen, Ao Jian, you guys bring some subordinates over!”

Wang Xian nodded and walked out of the Dragon King Hall. He spoke to Mou Zesen, Ao Jian, and the rest.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

In the current Dragon and Phoenix Empire, after subjugating a group of city lords and some experts, there were 63 insightful emptiness realm experts in the empire.

The original insightful emptiness realm experts that belonged to the dragon and Phoenix Empire were only a dozen or so.

Feng Luan wanted to get Wang Xian to send some of his subordinates over to keep an eye on the situation and prevent any accidents from happening.

Naturally, he didn’t have any objections.

The Heaven’s Eye Arrow Division and the Dragon Palace Guards, the Golden Swordfish, had a total of 700 members. Among them, there were more than 100 insightful emptiness realm experts.

If they were asked to keep an eye on the situation, it was more than enough to intimidate everyone.

Wang Xian did not send all of them over. 60 insightful emptiness realm experts were more than enough.

“Let’s Go!”

They moved and flew directly into the Imperial City of Dragon and Phoenix.

Flying was prohibited in the imperial city. However, Wang Xian was not included.

He led his subordinates and flew straight into the Dragon Palace.

“Where’s the Queen?”

Wang Xian went straight to the main hall of the palace and asked the maids around him.

“Sir Wang, the Queen is in the study room. Please come in!”

The maids in the palace quickly brought him in respectfully.

It was a completely different situation compared to the last time.

“Wang Xian, Sister Shuqing, sisters!”

Feng Luan stood up with a smile when she saw Wang Xian and the rest.

“Sister Feng Luan!”

A group of girls surrounded her and started to chat enthusiastically.

“Wang Xian, in two hours at most, the city lords of the sixty-four cities, as well as the families and forces, will be here. I’ll have to trouble the people of the Dragon Palace to help me intimidate them!”

Feng Luan chatted with Guan Shuqing and the rest for a while before she spoke to Wang Xian.

“No problem. I’ve brought the people here!”

Wang Xian nodded and sat casually at the side, sipping his tea.

“Okay, okay!”

Feng Luan nodded. Then, she ignored Wang Xian and continued to chat with Guan Shuqing and the rest.

“Eh, the King’s letter of Xiaoyao City!”

Wang Xian looked at the Golden Invitation Card on Feng Luan’s table with a hint of curiosity on his face.

“Feng Luan, what is this?”

Wang Xian asked.

“Oh right, don’t you want to sell the resources in your hands? You can go to Xiao Yao city. This invitation card was sent from Xiao Yao City. There are a total of three of them!”

“In seven days, there will be a king’s auction in Xiao Yao City. It will be held by the Master of Xiao Yao City. At that time, there will be more than twenty dynasties and seven to eight major forces participating. It can be said to be the gathering of top forces in one-fourth of the first-rate Sea Region!”

Feng Luan said as she looked at the invitation letter in his hand.

“Xiaoyao City?”

Wang Xian had a hint of doubt on his face.

“Xiaoyao City is a huge city built by the mayor of Xiaoyao City. This mayor of Xiaoyao city is also the strongest person within a radius of 100,000 kilometers. He is at the fifth level of the Seethrough Void Stage!”

“This powerhouse did not build a dynasty. Instead, he built a city. Every five years, there will be a grand auction. This year is the fifth year!”

Feng Luan introduced to him.
