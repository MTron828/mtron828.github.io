Chapter 1296: 1,297 Zhang Feng’s domineering aura

You are a lady from the Fox clan. The Fox clan’s bloodline is only at the first level of the Seethrough void tier. I don’t know why you are framing him. However, if you dare to cause trouble again, be careful of your entire clan!

Threatening words rang out once again. If Wang Xian threatened and long Xiaotian threatened, everyone would understand.

After all, Long Xiaotian was Wang Xian’s brother.

But who was this woman to him?

She was as domineering and arrogant as long Xiaotian. She directly threatened her entire family and even used her powerful aura and killing intent to target the fox.

This made everyone dumbfounded.

However, compared to Zhang Fengying’s domineering and even a little arrogant, the strength she displayed shocked everyone.

She was at least at the first level of the profound void tier, and what surprised everyone else was her pet.

It looked like an ordinary kitten, but it exuded an even more terrifying power than hers.

“What? You, you...”

Hu Mei sensed Zhang Fengying’s aura and killing intent, and her face changed dramatically. Her eyes were filled with fear.

She was already somewhat regretful. She regretted agreeing to the forty-second prince and regretting framing that young man.

Not only did she offend the second Prince of the Light Dragon Dynasty, but she also offended this powerful woman.

“Fengying, you... you...”

Jiang Chuan looked at Zhang Fengying who had suddenly exploded. His face was as ugly as if he had eaten SH * t. his eyes were wide open and filled with disbelief.

What was going on?

Zhang Fengying was actually defending him under such circumstances?

And she even wanted to kill the entire Foxy family!

Just now, he was standing on the opposite side of that young man. He was standing at the highest point of Justice!

Under the circumstances where all the witnesses and evidence were present, he only believed the simple words of that young man?

However, Wang Xian, who was standing at the side, was speechless when he heard her words.

What did she mean by “I have six wives”?

What did she mean by “I don’t need to find such a wife”?

Although it was the truth and he was speaking up for him, Wang Xian still felt that something was amiss. was he sure that he wasn’t blackmailing him?

“Wow!”

“This... This has six wives? Every one of them is beyond the reach of a seductive fox? A seductive Fox looks pretty too!”

“Oh my God, what a terrifying aura. She looks extremely young. How could she possess such terrifying strength? She is an insightful emptiness realm expert, yet another extremely young insightful emptiness realm expert!”

“Si, who is this woman? Young Master Jiang Chuan seems to know her. Could she be from the Divine Wind Academy?”

“She seems to be a teacher from the Divine Wind Academy. This is... interesting!”

“What is the relationship between this beautiful teacher from the Divine Wind Academy and that young man? He actually dares to offend the Prince of the Light Dragon Dynasty and Jiang Chuan for him?”

When everyone saw this scene, they were instantly in an uproar. A trace of shock appeared on everyone’s faces.

Suddenly, a beautiful teacher from the Divine Wind Academy appeared. She did not care about Jiang Chuan helping that young man.

Jiang Chuan’s great-grandfather was the principal of the school. He was one of the top experts in the Liuhai region.

Even Long Xiaotian, who was standing at the side, looked up at Wang Xian with a face full of admiration.

Six Wives? Each of them was beyond the reach of a fox.

Then, look at Zhang Fengying’s looks and figure!

Cowhide!

Role Model!

The five princes of the light dragon dynasty frowned as they looked at Zhang Fengying and then at Jiang Chuan, whose expression was extremely ugly. The corners of their mouths twitched slightly.

It seemed that Jiang Chuan didn’t even have the qualifications to compete with that young man.

Under such circumstances, if that beauty was so protective of him, what was the point of pursuing her?

However, the more this was the case, the happier they were. This was the only way that Jiang Chuan would be even more determined to destroy that young man.

At the thought of this, a faint smile appeared on the Princes’faces.

“No, no... all of you... all of you are bullying me...”

When Hu Mei saw that Jiang Chuan had stopped talking, and even the forty-second prince had stopped talking, a trace of fear appeared in her eyes.

Feeling Zhang Fengying’s aura, her somewhat broken body slowly collapsed.

“Sister Hu Mei, let’s go. The bad guys will eventually get their retribution. If anyone dares to bully your family members, the regiment commander will stand up for you!”

A woman frowned slightly when she saw the devastated Foxy. She walked over and spoke to her.

Although Zhang Fengying was extremely powerful, most people still believed that it was true that Wang Xian had gotten rid of the Foxy.

This was because all the evidence was right in front of them. There was no need for others to frame him in such a manner.

However, the person who came out to help Wang Xian was too powerful.

He was in the limelight and was considered by most to be the second prince who would ascend to the throne of the Light Dragon Dynasty.

He was the powerful mentor of the Divine Wind Academy.

These two forces were enough to crush most of the forces present.

“It’s sister Bei. Yes, yes!”

Hu Mei nodded her head in a slightly devastated manner. Her eyes were filled with panic.

This time, she was not acting but was truly afraid!

With the help of the woman, she stood up and glanced at the forty-second prince.

“If I remember correctly, you looked at that young man twice in a row. What is your relationship with him?”

Girls were usually more meticulous. When Zhang Fengying saw Hu Mei looking at the forty-second prince again, her gaze was ice-cold as she asked.

“Haha, this beauty, Don’t tell me you think I ordered you to do this? Let me tell you, some things can not be said carelessly!”

A trace of discomfort flashed in the eyes of the forty-second prince. He instantly laughed out loud with a cold face and stared at him coldly.

“I’ve already said it, little forty-two, what can you do? It’s not that I look down on you, but even if the five of you work together, I’m not afraid of You!”

Just as the forty-second Prince finished speaking, Long Xiaotian narrowed his eyes slightly and swept his gaze over his brothers as he spoke arrogantly.

Although his words were arrogant, he had the qualifications to do so.

His words caused the faces of Long Xiaochen and the others to instantly darken. They stared at Long Xiaotian with faces full of anger.

However, Long Xiaotian looked at them with a cold smile.

When everyone around saw this scene, they sighed inwardly at the second prince. The important matter had already been settled halfway. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The woman who was supporting the Vixen frowned slightly. As a careful girl, she had also noticed that every time the vixen was threatened, she would look at the 42nd Prince.

Among them...

However, she didn’t think too much about it. After all, this vixen was in the same mercenary group as her. They could be considered good sisters.

She supported the Vixen and walked outside with an expressionless face.

Some of the people around them looked at them but didn’t say anything.

Their gaze swept past Zhang Fengying who was beside Wang Xian. Their eyes were filled with shock and astonishment.

“Leader!”

At this moment, at the entrance of the Back Mountain, a group of people walked in in front of Hu Mei and another woman. They were slightly shocked. When they saw Tang Ling, who was walking beside them, they hurriedly shouted.

The cherry blossom mercenary group was considered a relatively famous mercenary group in the cemetery of demi-humans.

The reason why it was famous was not because of its powerful strength, but because of the founder and members of the mercenary group.

The founder, Tang Ling ‘er, was the princess of the blood flow empire. She was one of the few girls on The Prodigy roll and had a deep background.

The members of the cherry blossom mercenary group were all girls from aristocratic families. They were all girls with outstanding strength.
