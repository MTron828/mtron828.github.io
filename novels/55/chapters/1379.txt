Chapter 1380: 1380. You are a noble race

“Jin Ming, don’t interact with the third miss anymore. You are not from the same world!”

“Although second young master said it harshly, but... Alright, Alright, hurry up and get to work!”

In the middle, the fire hammer clan leader glanced at Duan Jin Ming and shook his head helplessly.

“This third miss is quite nice. Unfortunately, our fire hammer clan is completely unworthy of her!”

“Jin Ming’s bloodline is extraordinary, but there’s nothing we can do about it. The bloodline restriction of our clan is right here!”

“What a pity, what a pity for Jin Ming!”

The voices of some middle-aged men could be heard from the surrounding area. They were whispering to each other.

Wang Xian was standing at the side. When he heard their sighs, a smile appeared on his face.

He strolled over and came to Duan Jinming’s side.

“HMM? Young master, May I know who you are?”

The chief of the Fire Hammer clan asked curiously when he saw Wang Xian walking over.

“Those who possess the bloodline of a peak dragon seed are not that extraordinary!”

Wang Xian looked at the old man with a smile and said faintly.

“Young master, what are you doing?”

The old man didn’t understand what Wang Xian meant and looked at him with puzzlement.

“You will understand soon!”

Wang Xian smiled and flicked his finger.

An isolated formation suddenly enveloped them.

“What are you doing?”

The sudden appearance of the formation caused the chief of the Fire Hammer clan to have a drastic change in expression. He held the fire hammer tightly with his four arms and stared at Wang Xian with an embarrassed expression.

Duan Jinming’s expression also changed drastically. He stared at Wang Xian furiously.

“What’s going on?”

“What are they trying to do?”

“Attack them! Those people want to harm the clan leader and the rest!”

The expressions of the more than 2,000 members of the Fire Hammer clan who were standing outside changed drastically. All of them immediately held the fire hammer in their hands and attacked the formation.

“Don’t worry. The Dragon King will not harm them!”

Ao Jian’s figure came out of the array formation and said to the members of the Fire Hammer clan.

“What are you doing? Open the array formation quickly, or don’t blame us for being rude!”

The members of the Fire Hammer clan saw that their attacks landed on the array formation without the slightest ripple, and their expressions changed slightly.

They stared at Ao Jian vigilantly.

“If we wanted to harm you, you’d already be dead!”

Ao jian slightly raised his head, and his body emitted a faint pressure.

Just a trace of pressure made all the people of the fire hammer clan look aghast.

“Brothers, don’t be afraid!”

Ao Jian said indifferently to all the people of the Fire Hammer clan.

“Brothers... ?”

All the people of the fire hammer clan were shocked when they heard his words.

Brothers?

How could a powerhouse who was able to intimidate them with just a hint of pressure call them brothers?

This?

To be honest, how could the fire hammer clan do this?

This made all of them bewildered.

“Don’t be afraid. First of all, I want to tell you that the Fire Hammer clan is not a lowly race!”

Inside the formation, Wang Xian looked at the vigilant Duan Jinming and the Fire Hammer clan leader as he spoke with a twinkle in his eyes.

The two of them stared at Wang Xian in bewilderment.

“Here are the pills for you. Take them all!”

Wang Xian moved his palm and passed the pills to Duan Jinming one by one!

“These are... pills of extraordinary level nine!”

The Fire Hammer tribe leader looked at them with a face full of shock. He stared at Wang Xian with his eyes wide open.

“Take them directly. There’s no need to talk nonsense!”

Wang Xian said directly.

Duan Jinming’s eyes flickered. He took the pills directly and swallowed them all into his stomach.

“Weng Weng Weng Weng!”

When the pills entered his stomach, every ten seconds, a powerful aura would be emitted from his body.

In just ten seconds, his strength had broken through from rank 7 to rank 9.

“Rank 9 transcendent, I knew your bloodline was extraordinary. I knew it, Haha, I Knew It!”

When he saw Duan Jinming break through the limit of his bloodline, the Fire Hammer clan leader revealed an excited expression.

He was extremely excited. The Fire Hammer clan was only a rank 8 transcendent Bloodline Demon Beast Race. Now that a clansman had broken through the limit, it was possible for them to lead a better life.

This made him cry!

“I... I actually broke through the limit of my bloodline, I...”

Duan Jinming stared at his arm with a face full of excitement.

“Fire Hammer tribe leader, all of you possess the bloodline of the fire gold dragon seed. However, the bloodline of your tribe is too weak!”

“If you agree to be my subordinate and a member of the Dragon Palace, Swallow this drop of blood essence!”

Wang Xian looked at the fire hammer tribe leader and a drop of blood essence floated beside him.

“A member of the Dragon Palace?”

The chief of the Fire Hammer clan mumbled. Looking at the blood essence in front of him, he had a strong desire to devour it. However, he could feel a will from it.

Once he swallowed it, he might be under his control.

This caused his expression to change continuously.

“Hu, Jin Ming, this is the chief’s seal. You will be the chief in the future!”

The chief of the Fire Hammer clan hesitated for dozens of seconds before he finally heaved a sigh of relief. He took out the chief’s seal and looked at Wang Xian.

“Our fire hammer tribe is very weak to begin with. No one else can gain anything from us!”

The Fire Hammer tribe leader’s eyes flickered as he spoke. He opened his mouth and swallowed the Divine Dragon’s blood essence!

“This is the cultivation method of the fire divine dragon transformation. Immediately sit cross-legged and cultivate!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he imprinted the cultivation method of the fire divine dragon transformation into his mind. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The chief of the fire hammer tribe trembled for a moment. His face was flushed red as he began to receive the divine dragon inheritance.

Wang Xian moved his arm and streams of dragon energy were injected into his body without any hesitation, cleansing his body.

An imposing manner was transmitted over. Fierce Flames surged out from the chief of the Fire Hammer tribe. A fire hammer was suspended above his head.

Duan Jinming, who was at the side, widened his eyes abruptly. His eyes revealed a look of disbelief.

“Clan leader, his bloodline... has also broken through the shackles!”

He stared at him excitedly.

“Roar!”

At this moment, a soft dragon’s roar was heard from the fire hammer above the fire hammer clan leader’s head. A small shadow of a flaming divine dragon appeared.

Wang Xian continued to punch into the Fire Hammer clan leader’s head. The Shadow of the Divine Dragon on the fire hammer gradually solidified.

Meanwhile, the aura of the fire hammer clan leader kept increasing.

“Half-step void interpretation! To half-step void interpretation!”

“Void interpretation realm! Oh My God, the tribe leader actually... actually broke through to the void interpretation realm!”

Duan Jinming, who was at the side, stared at the tribe leader whose aura had reached the void interpretation realm in disbelief.

In just a few dozen seconds, the tribe leader had broken through from transcendent level eight to level one of the void interpretation realm. This was simply too crazy!

He looked at Wang Xian in a daze. He was a little absent-minded. What kind of strength was he?

How could he raise the clan leader to the insightful emptiness realm so easily?

“I, Duan Yan Lie, pay my respects to the Dragon King. Thank you for teaching me the cultivation technique and breaking the shackles of my bloodline. Thank you, Dragon King, for helping me raise my cultivation!”

Wang Xian stopped after raising the fire hammer clan leader to the first level of the insightful emptiness realm.

Duan Yan Lie, who had just woken up, knelt on the ground and worshipped Wang Xian excitedly.
