Translator: 549690339

“Today, I can kill the Holy Doctor, Holy Medicine, and Immortal God. In the future, I will be able to wipe them out completely!”

The voice reverberated throughout the entire sky. Everyone looked at Wang Xian and the rest who had left in a daze. Their faces were filled with shock.

The disciples of the Dragon Gate ambushed and killed the immortal God.

This matter was simply too shocking.

At present, the Immortal God was high and mighty. Even with the agreement between the Immortal God and the Immortal God, the immortal God still possessed an inviolable dignity that surpassed ordinary people.

However, even so, an immortal god was still killed by the disciples of the Dragon Gate.

The ten immortal gods of the Yongchang world stared at Wang Xian’s figure with complicated and fearful expressions, especially those lower-level immortals.

At present, the Dragon Gate had the strength to kill a lower-level immortal. Thinking about it, this was a terrifying matter.

Especially the Holy Medicine and Holy Medicine Immortal sect. The Dragon King had already wanted to fight to the death with them. Now, even a lower immortal’s life was in danger.

Then, would another immortal be killed? How would the Holy Medicine and Holy Medicine Immortal sect fight back?

There was no way to fight back.

Even if the Holy Medicine and Holy Medicine Immortal sect went out, they would need at least two lower immortals together. Only then would it be safer.

It is astonishing that a fairy should be forced into such a position.

Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal Gate of an immortal god was killed by Dragon Gate Strong ambush, this matter first in the Yongchang world caused a huge sensation.

Soon, this matter spread to jianghu online, spread to the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal Gate there.

At first, no one believed that an immortal God would be ambushed and killed by a strong person below the immortal God. With the strength of the immortal God, it was very difficult to kill.

However, when an immortal God came out to verify it, the entire jianghu web seemed to have experienced a magnitude-10 earthquake in an instant.

“An immortal God was killed? How is this possible? This is too unbelievable!”

“Heavens, Heavens, an immortal God has fallen. An immortal God has actually fallen. How can the Dragon Gate be so terrifying! ?”

“Over a hundred infant realm experts directly attacked from afar, breaking through the first defense of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal Sect’s immortal God. Following that, terrifying half-step immortal god White Shadows shot toward the immortal God one after another. Wave after wave, they held immortal God weapons in their hands, and in the end, they died at the hands of five half-step immortal God swordsmen!”

“This time, the Dragon Gate sent at least twenty half-step immortal God experts. They are so powerful that it’s unbelievable. Which Force will dare to provoke the Dragon Gate in the future? Even the Yuwen clan of the Xuan Yuan clan can’t do it!”

Everyone was shocked. Even the high and mighty immortal gods were looking at this piece of information with shocked faces.

“We have to make a move. Regardless of the immortal god agreement, we have to destroy the Dragon Gate. Otherwise, our entire Saint Medicine Immortal sect is no different from a stray dog!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

An angry roar came from inside the Immortal God Hall of Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal Gate.

Inside the hall, the green-robed old man roared with a face full of fury.

His face was full of anger, but it was also filled with a trace of fear.

The Dragon Gate had actually ambushed and killed one of their immortals. It would have been better if their disciple had died, but now, the immortal God had died.

The Immortal God represented the pillar of his Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal Gate. If the pillar was destroyed, it would naturally shake the entire immortal gate.

Other than the green-robed elder, the rest of the immortal gods were also filled with fear.

Most of them had the strength of lower-level immortals, which meant that there was a possibility of them being killed.

After cultivating for so many years, they were now killed by a group of people who had not even reached the level of immortal gods?

This was a great humiliation.

Especially by someone who was weaker than them in their eyes.

Aggrieved and humiliated!

“We can’t go on like this. With the Dragon King’s character, it’s very likely that he’ll keep his word. He was able to ambush and kill one of our immortal gods today, and then he’ll be able to kill the rest of our immortal gods. We can’t just sit around and wait for Death!”

A lower immortal growled with a grave look in his eyes.

None of them had expected that they would have to pay such a huge price just to destroy the Dragon Gate forging workshop.

Fifty infant realm experts were killed, and one immortal god was killed.

Even the two immortal sects, Holy Medicine and holy medicine, couldn’t bear such a loss.

“Now, the Dragon Gate has the power to kill immortal gods. Not only are we afraid, but the immortal gods of the other immortal sects are also afraid!”

“The Immortal God agreement was originally used to protect the weak below the immortal God level. Now, because of this rule, even the immortal God can’t protect himself!”

At this time, the burly elder standing at the front had a cold look in his eyes. His body was filled with a murderous aura as he said, “Since even the immortals and gods can not be protected, the agreement between the immortals and gods has no meaning at all!”

“Grand Supreme, what are you trying to do?”

The surrounding immortals and gods felt the anger of the Grand Supreme Elder. They were slightly shocked and quickly asked.

“Since the Dragon King wants to destroy our Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect, then let’s fight and see who will be destroyed first!”

The burly elder’s eyes were like torches, and flames began to jump on his clothes.

“Grand Supreme, with the agreement between the Immortals and gods, how can we attack? Also, the disciples of the Dragon sect are too powerful, so powerful that it’s inconceivable!”

A lower immortal said with an embarrassed expression.

“Even the immortals and gods have been killed, so who cares about the agreement between the Immortals and gods? I don’t believe that the disciples of the Dragon sect have the ability to kill Immortals and gods. The other immortal sects can do it. Even the Yuwen clan of the Xuanyuan clan can’t sit still!”

The eyes of the burly elder were filled with coldness.

“Let’s go, everyone follow me!”

With a light shout, he flew out of the main hall and flew towards the sky above the east gate of the sacred city.

The eyes of the immortal gods flickered as they followed closely behind the Elder.

In the sacred city below, today was simply a nightmare for the disciples of the two immortal sects.

The Immortal Lord was actually killed by the Dragon Gate.

Perhaps it was as the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate had said, their entire immortal sect would be destroyed in the future.

Everyone was terrified, everyone was terrified.

The fear brought by the immortal Lord’s death filled everyone with Panic!

Especially when they saw the comments on the Internet saying that the holy medicine and holy medicine would be finished in the future, it made all the disciples extremely embarrassed and angry.

But now they had no way to do anything about it. The difference was simply too great.

The sensation caused by the Dragon Gate killing the immortal God was equivalent to an earthquake of over ten magnitude.

“Oh? The Immortal God!”

“What is the immortal God going to do? No, twelve. How can there be twelve immortal gods!”

“Hiss, that figure, that figure, the supreme, is the supreme. Didn’t they say that the supreme has already passed away?”

At this moment, the disciples of the two great immortal sects in the sacred city suddenly noticed a group of immortal gods flying out, and their faces revealed a look of shock.

However, when some of the disciples saw the old man at the front, their faces revealed a look of shock.

That was their supreme elder, once the most powerful existence in the immortal sect.

The twelve immortal gods, led by the burly old man, stood in the sky above the east gate.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

Suddenly, an imposing aura as powerful as a prison was emitted from the burly old man’s body.

“Dragon King, in three days, I, Bian Jiang Tu, will lead the experts of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect to exterminate your Dragon Gate and wait for Death!”
