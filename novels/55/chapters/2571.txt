2572 2,572 abyss seeds

“Abyss!”

Wang Xian flew forward quickly and landed on a land plate!

On the plate, there were simple houses. The land within a radius of 10 million kilometers was bustling with activity!

There were a lot of people, but none of them were below the level of the Eternal Lord!

There were no guards on the plate, which meant that this place was not under any restrictions. Humans could kill each other freely here!

However, Wang Xian had yet to see anyone fighting here. Clearly, this land plate could not withstand too strong an attack. Perhaps there was an unspoken rule that prevented fighting here!

Wang Xian kept flying forward and soon arrived at the edge of the land plate! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

When he arrived at the edge, he saw a pitch-black hole in the abyss!

The hole was very irregular. It was pitch-black inside and his vision was greatly obstructed!

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. Without any hesitation, he flew straight into the cave!

Around him, there were also many people who flew out from the Abyss or entered the cave!

Buzz

The moment he entered the cave, Wang Xian immediately sensed some changes in the empty space!

The space inside the cave was extremely sturdy. It was unlike when he was outside, where powerful attacks could tear apart the space cracks!

“This is? It’s exactly what the AI said!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled!

There was one thing about the abyss that was extremely terrifying. Once one entered the abyss, one would not be able to return to one’s divine kingdom!

The surrounding space would confine one here. It was impossible to escape directly!

The deeper one went into the confinement, the stronger it became. Even the immortal king would not be able to return to his immortal King’s divine kingdom immediately!

The greatest threat of the Abyss was right here. It would be very, very difficult to eliminate the abyssal seed!

“However, there is a benefit to this. The abyssal seed is located in the abyss. Don’t even think about returning to your nest in an instant!”

Wang Xian mumbled. This place was like a special space!

“This is?”

Wang Xian flew for a few thousand kilometers in the abyss. He saw a huge land in the pitch-black abyss in front of him. There were some special plants on this land!

“Is this the place where the abyssal species live?”

Wang Xian took a look and his eyes sparkled!

The moment any floating forest, land, mountains, flames, or rivers appeared in the abyss, it meant that there were abyssal species living here!

The entire abyssal species were either killed or had escaped!

The Abyss was huge. There were countless entrances to the Abyss and the entire Abyss was connected!

However, the more entrances to the abyss, the more dangerous the place was!

“This vast abyss is like an incomparably huge ocean. It’s going to be difficult to kill the species of the abyss. Furthermore, it’s filled with danger!”

Wang Xian mumbled to himself. His body moved and he continued flying in a direction!

Occasionally, he would bump into people in the surroundings. There were even groups of people coming over!

It could be said that the crystallization of the laws of an abyss seed could allow a person to improve rapidly in his cultivation. Even if it was dangerous here, there would still be people coming over to take risks!

Moreover, there were quite a number of people!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

After flying for half an hour, Wang Xian was already tens of billions of kilometers away from the exit of the Abyss!

At this moment, a few shadows in front of him caught his attention!

“This is?”

He looked over and saw two pitch-black cockroach-like figures sweeping across the void and attacking him directly!

“This is?”

He narrowed his eyes slightly and waved his arm. The binding force of the five elemental laws directly restrained him!

“Ji Ji Ji Ji!”

A sharp and ear-piercing sound entered Wang Xian’s ears, causing a hint of surprise to appear on his face!

Wang Xian waved his arm and the two abyssal seeds revealed themselves!

Their blood-red eyes were green and they had a long nose. Their mouths were as long as mosquitoes and their bodies were like cockroaches!

“Bang!”

Wang Xian squeezed his arm gently and the abyssal seeds exploded. There was a law crystal in his body!

This was a green law crystal. The two abyssal seeds were only at the level of the Eternal Lord. He sensed the energy. A law crystal was equivalent to the entire corpse of a desolate beast of the same level!

The corpse of the abyssal seed also contained a lot of energy. In other words, a corpse of an abyssal seed was equivalent to the energy of two desolate beasts of the same level!

“Its energy is much higher than that of desolate beasts. According to the A.I. , the abyssal seed doesn’t have intelligence. It only knows how to hunt!”

“Let’s give it a try!”

It took Wang Xian nearly two hours to find two abyssal seeds. With a thought, he commanded, “Soul Catcher!”

...

Soul catcher. This was the first time Wang Xian had used it on such a creature with low intelligence!

Buzz

In an instant, bloody words appeared in his mind. They were located at a beach-like place. Countless abyssal seeds broke out of their shells!

The first thing they did when they broke out of their shells was to fight and devour the abyssal seeds around them to grow!

After that, they would hunt in the vast abyss!

The powerful abyssal seeds would subdue the weaker ones and form a tribe. They would feed on the weaker ones among their own kind!

As long as they devoured their own kind, they would be able to evolve rapidly!

It was as though they could grow without limits as long as they devoured more law crystals!

However, Wang Xian soon realized that compared to these abyssal seeds, they preferred human blood!

There were a few scenes where they ambushed the humans who entered the Abyss and sucked all their blood dry!

“There’s one more thing. This abyssal seed seems to have an extremely powerful sense of smell!”

...

Wang Xian mumbled!

Just this level 5 immortal king abyssal seed was able to smell the humans within a radius of hundreds of millions of kilometers!

A radius of more than 100 million kilometers was usually the limit of the immortal King’s investigation!

“There are also people on the AI who discovered that the abyssal seed is bloodthirsty. There are forces that use large amounts of desolate beast blood to attract the abyssal seed!”

Wang Xian mumbled. He hesitated for a moment before moving his palm!

“Let’s see if the Divine Dragon’s blood can attract the abyssal seed!”

Wang Xian mumbled as at least 100 kilograms of Divine Dragon’s blood appeared in front of him!

These were all his own blood. Wang Xian, who was more than 10,000 meters tall, had 50 kilograms of blood which was nothing!

However, to other creatures, this was an incomparably huge energy pool!

“It should be more effective than the blood of desolate beasts!”

He mumbled as he suspended the blood in the air. He took out the five elements millstone and set up a concealing formation!

At the same time, his yin and yang poles concealing ability was fully activated!

“If the blood of the divine dragon is useful, it will be a good thing for the Dragon Palace!”

“If it is not useful, in order to hunt down a large number of abyssal seeds, we will need to enter the more dangerous entrance of the abyss. At that time, there might be casualties!”

Wang Xian mumbled and waited quietly!

“Huh?”

However, Wang Xian sensed the strange movements around him in less than a minute!

With his senses, a few abyssal seeds flew towards him at a terrifying speed!

“It’s working!”

He was delighted!
