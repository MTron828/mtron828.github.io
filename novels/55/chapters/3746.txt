3747 3746 infiltrated into the center of the heart of fire treasure ground

If Wang Xian were to cultivate on these flaming planets, it would take him a few million years to break through.

A few million years was neither too much nor too little.

It would take him a few million years to advance to the next level. If he wanted to advance further, it might take him tens of millions of years.

This time was not too long.

However, Wang Xian felt that if he could enter the center of the heart of fire treasure ground, his cultivation speed would increase by at least tens of times.

If he could use it after tens of thousands of years, he wouldn’t need to search for resources and treasures. He could totally cultivate here.

That was because this was where the resources and treasures were!

“Will I be attacked if I let an lie bring me in?”

Wang Xian was a little hesitant.

If he wanted to enter, it would be very risky. Although he wouldn’t lose his life, he would need to use the void scroll to escape.

This void scroll was a life-saving treasure.

As he looked at the space behemoth that was cultivating in the heart of fire treasure ground, an idea popped up in his mind.

“Can I? There are a total of seven to eight species of space behemoths here. I don’t think they have a clear understanding of each other. After all, space behemoths are more bestial.”

Wang Xian thought of a method and felt that he could take the risk to try it.

That was to use the beast skin treasure that Lin Wenluo studied to transform himself into the appearance of a space beast and enter it.

Wang Xian wasn’t sure what the probability of success was.

With the uniqueness of the beast skin, he could transform into an existence that was exactly the same as other space beasts. As long as he didn’t fight and didn’t unleash his energy, he wouldn’t be detected by other space beasts of the same species.

Lin Wenluo had already tested it in the storm continent. As long as he did not use his energy, it would not be a big problem.

“Let’s give it a try!”

Soon, Wang Xian made his decision!

The Temptation of the heart of the fire treasure ground was too great.

If he could enter the heart of the fire treasure ground to cultivate, he would not need to go out to search for treasures. It would be enough for him to cultivate here.

By then, he would be able to complete his breakthrough after a few tens of thousands of years of seclusion. This speed was already very fast.

Having made up his mind, Wang Xian’s gaze was fixed on the figures of the space beasts in the center of the Fiery Heart Treasure Land.

There were seven to eight types of space beasts. Most of them had half of their bodies lying in the fiery liquid. Only their heads or upper bodies were on top of it.

Wang Xian scanned through them one by one and finally landed on one of the Space Beasts.

It was a space beast that was emitting flames all over its body and had four limbs lying on the ground. It looked like a toad.

The only difference was that there was a raised thing on its head that looked like a gourd!

There were many space beasts of this race. There were more than twenty of them, and they took up a large portion of this group of Space Beasts.

In addition, among the group of more than twenty space beasts, there were a few small ones that looked like Young Space Beast Cubs.

This race was obviously in a higher position among the space behemoths.

They occupied a large area so that they could occasionally see the young space behemoths turn around and move around.

“Why don’t I transform into this kind of space behemoth?”

Wang Xian sized them up and calculated the probability of success. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“There should be a high probability. The space behemoths of that race and the group of adult space behemoths are all sleeping with their eyes closed.”

“Most importantly, if I transform into this space beast, the other space beasts shouldn’t dare to provoke me.”

Wang Xian thought to himself as he looked around.

In the surrounding area, there were quite a number of experts staring at the center of the hotheart treasured land. There was one not far away from him.

Wang Xian moved his body and came to a relatively remote place where it was difficult for other expert disciples to see.

He touched the animal skin on his body.

“Collecting and simulating the shape of the target. Collecting is in progress…”

Wang Xian pressed a button on the animal skin.

As a product of technology, this animal skin continued some of the usage methods in the world of technology.

“The collection is successful. It can simulate the appearance of the Space Beast. At the same time, it can simulate some of the movements of the Space Beast.”

Very soon, the mechanical voice sounded again.

“Simulate!”

Wang Xian had a thought and immediately carried out the simulation.

At the next moment, Wang Xian could clearly sense that his body was starting to grow bigger. He had turned into a space beast cub.

Without any hesitation, he simulated the movements of the Space Beast Cub. His body moved and he flew toward the center of the heart of fire treasure ground.

The place he flew to was not the territory occupied by the Space Beast Race. Instead, he flew to a place at the edge.

There were three space beasts lying on the ground, practicing.

“Eh? Why did a space beast suddenly appear there?”

“What’s going on? Where did a space beast come from?”

When Wang Xian flew towards the center of the heart of fire treasure ground, some of the strong disciples who were paying attention to the center saw him. Their faces were filled with astonishment.

On the planet occupied by the fire phoenixes, a few fire phoenixes also looked over in puzzlement.

However, at this moment, Wang Xian quickly flew towards the fiery liquid at the center of the heart of fire treasure ground.

At this moment, he was a little scared and was prepared to escape at any time.

When he flew to the center of the heart of fire treasure ground, the three space beasts that were cultivating inside immediately looked at him.

The huge pupils and the terrifying aura from his body made Wang Xian’s heart tighten.

However, he did not stop. He continued to fall into the fiery liquid below!

“Bang!”

After falling into the liquid, waves of majestic and vast fiery energy tempered his body and surged into his body!

Wang Xian instantly felt as though he had sunk into a powerful ocean of energy.

Even if he didn’t absorb it, countless amounts of energy were surging into his body.

This made his eyes filled with surprise and joy.

Crash

However, at this moment, the space behemoths that were only tens of thousands of kilometers ahead suddenly moved, causing him to be a little nervous.

However, what surprised Wang Xian was that the three space beasts did not have any other strange movements.

Wang Xian hurriedly controlled his body and completely immersed himself in the flame liquid.

When his body was immersed in the flame liquid, he could sense that his surroundings were filled with the aura of the terrifying space beasts.

“There are not only seventy to eighty space beasts in the center of this Hotheart treasured land. There are at least hundreds of them.”

Wang Xian could sense that there were more space beasts below him!

After immersing himself into the space beasts, he looked in the direction of the three space beasts.

The three space beasts did not move. He did not know if they were afraid of the space beast race that Wang Xian had imitated or something else. All in all, he had succeeded!

“I have succeeded!”

At this moment, Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with excitement. He was extremely excited as he felt the vast power of the flames around him.

“At most, I can cultivate here for 10,000 years. I will be able to achieve a breakthrough here.”

Excitement appeared on his face. He immediately lay there without moving and cultivated quietly.

Although the surrounding space beasts noticed his arrival, none of them attacked him!
