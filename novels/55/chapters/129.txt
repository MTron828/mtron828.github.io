“Scram!”

Wang Xian shouted and his voice exploded in the medical hall.

When Wang Xian finished his word, the entire medical hall quietened down.

They were looking at Wang Xian in shock.

The one he was chiding was from the Yan Family!

When Yan Zhongyuan heard his words, his face stiffened and his expression turned heavy gradually.

He stared at Wang Xian with killing intent!

“I... Dare... You... To... Repeat... Yourself!”

Yan Zhongyuan gritted his teeth and threatened, word by word. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Can’t... You... Understand... The... Human... Language?”

Wang Xian replied in the same manner coldly but with the intention of mocking Yan Zhongyuan!

The atmosphere in the medical hall chilled rapidly. Everyone held their breath as they witnessed this shocking scene.

Seeing this, Old Qin said with an angry expression, “A loss is a loss! Could it be that you are trying to impose your will on others?” He looked to the few hospital directors and his eyes were filled with displeasure.

The hospital directors were stunned and understood that Old Qin wasn’t pleased with how they had reacted previously.

One of them gritted his teeth and said, “A contest of medical skills shouldn’t be affected by age and authority. The winner has the right to decide the fate of the loser. These rules have to be followed.”

“Yes!”

The other hospital directors seconded and nodded their heads.

This group had no personal view and would go whichever way the situation dictated. Now that Fang Huazi had lost, they naturally knew where they should stand.

As for the rest of the martial artists, they didn’t speak a word. Nonetheless, all of them had their attention on Fang Huazi, Yan Zhongyuan and his clique.

What they were implying was crystal clear. The rules were the rules and the Yan Family still did not possess the strength to break them.

With the Qin Family around, the Qin Family would at least have the right to speak up.

“Great, great!” Yan Zhongyuan looked across coldly before landing on Wang Xian. “Just you wait. Now that you’ve offended the Yan Family, I’ll let you know what is worse than death!”

“Can you represent the Yan Family?” Wang Xian smiled and stared at Yan Zhongyuan.

“What I’ve said are the words of the Yan Family. If you dared to touch Miracle Doctor Fang Huazi today, I’d guarantee the Bohai Sea would have another corpse!” Yan Zhongyuan threatened.

“Alright, understood!” Wang Xian nodded his head.

“Brat, if you dared to touch my master, you wouldn’t even know how you die!”

The juvenile behind Fang Huazi stared at Wang Xian with his bloodshot eyes.

He had also not expected his Master to have lost to this brat.

Wang Xian looked emotionlessly at the juvenile before turning to the silent Fang Huazi. He mocked, “Stretch out your arms. Otherwise, I’ll publicize this throughout the underworld and let others determine how reputable the Sacred Followers Guild is. Hehe!”

“YOU...”

Fang Huazi stared fiercely at Wang Xian. He had not expected Wang Xian to be still thinking of touching him after Yan Zhongyuan had threatened him.

Yan Zhongyuan heard Wang Xian. His expression turned even colder and he gave him a death stare.

The complexion of the juvenile by the side had turned pale.

“I guess I have to do it myself!” Wang Xian added as he stretched his hands over and placed them on Fang Huazi’s arms.

Fang Huazi’s body shivered slightly.

“The consequences aren’t something you can bear!” Yan Zhongyuan stared at Wang Xian and reminded him.

Wang Xian was unmoved. He smiled radiantly and stared at Fang Huazi.

“You wouldn’t dare. I, Fang Huazi, have cured countless experts. If you dared to cripple me...”

Fang Huazi rambled on with a hideous look. However, before he could complete his sentence, he gradually lost all feeling in his arms.

His face stiffened and fear gripped him.

“If I crippled you...” Wang Xian smiled and continued staring at him. “Then as a doctor, you wouldn’t be able to use your arms anymore. In the future, you would have to use your legs to administer acupuncture for others. Yeah! That would be an incredible scene!”

Wang Xian gradually retracted his arms as he spoke. He smiled and looked across the group. “I won’t be sending you guys off then!”

“How dare you really crippled my arms. How dare you!”

Fang Huazi’s body shivered vigorously. To his horror, he could no longer sense the existence of his arms. It was as though they had been wiped off unknowingly.

This sent a chill down his spine.

If the arms were crippled by the common way, he still could rely on his medical skills to restore them quickly.

However, he couldn’t sense what the issue was with his arms at all currently. In fact, he couldn’t even sense his arms!

“Great! You are still the first one who wouldn’t show respect to the Yan Family!”

Yan Zhongyuan clenched his fist tightly, smirked and stared at Wang Xian.

“Not going off? What are you still staying for?” Wang Xian looked at them and mocked.

“My arms! I’ll remember this!”

Fang Huazi stared at Wang Xian. His face had turned a little pale as he turned around and left.

“You better remember it. Your arms can’t be cured! Rest assured. My medical techniques in the field of osteopathy are still very good.”

Wang Xian added this in bad taste as he saw the back view of Fang Huazi leaving.

Fang Huazi stumbled and almost fell to the ground if not for the juvenile beside him who held onto him.

Hehe!

Wang Xian laughed and had a satirical smile.

“Brother Wang Xian, you just offended the Sacred Followers Guild and Yan Family completely. You have to be careful from now on.”

Seeing that Fang Huazi and the group had left, Old Qin reminded in a solemn tone.

Yan Family!

Wang Xian’s eyes shimmered and revealed a smirk.

“Yan Family’s strength is truly terrifying. Even if all the other Ancient Martial Arts Families allied together, they wouldn’t be as strong as the Yan Family. An old member of Yan Family reached Martial Artist Level 9 20 years ago. He’s probably even stronger now. Now that you have offended the Yan Family, things will get troublesome.

Old Xue spoke with a heavy heart. When he had just arrived at Rivertown, Yan Family was already a great and giant force in Rivertown.

If he had to go against the Yan Family, he would have no confidence at all.

“Just a few days ago, the Yan Family announced that they would be returning. They have invited all the Martial Artists of the underworld to attend the Yan Family’s banquet in two more days. Although it was said to be a banquet, it is also a form of declaration. A declaration of their return! They are announcing to all that the King of Rivertown will be returning.”

“I dare to bet that during this banquet, they will show their strength and even resort to violence to warn the rest!”

“Moreover, the Ancient Martial Arts Families in Rivertown will experience a major reshuffling when the time comes. There will probably be many families who would choose to go under the umbrella of the Yan Family!”

At the side, Old Duan added with a solemn face.

He’d had conflicts with the Yan Family previously. Now that the Yan Family was returning, it would definitely be a huge blow to the Duan Family.

“Reshuffling!” Old Xue heaved a sigh. When he knew that the Yan Family would be returning, he immediately invited Old Qin and Wang Xian. This was done in the hope of strength in numbers!

And to deal with the changes happening to Rivertown in the future!

Looking at it now, everything was hard to tell!

“The day after tomorrow?”

Wang Xian heard their conversation and a faint smile appeared on his face.

Announcing the return of the King of Rivertown for the future?

In that case, Wang Xian would like to make an announcement too!

The descent of the King!

As to who would be the real King, he would really like to know!
