Chapter 1435: Why would 1435 need to explain to you? Go

“Who else has an opinion?”

Prince Bloodflow stood at the top and questioned everyone with a cold face.

Who else has an opinion?

This sentence sounded more like who else dared to have an opinion?

When everyone heard Prince Bloodflow’s words, they were slightly shocked.

They weren’t shocked by the Bloodflow dynasty’s might.

In the entire flowing sea region, everyone knew that the blood flow empire’s strength could literally destroy all of their forces.

If it wasn’t for the fact that the blood flow empire needed to fight against the demonic beasts in the demi-human graveyard and that they didn’t have enough strength to control such a large area, they might have already ruled over the entire blood flow empire!

Ruling a dynasty wasn’t that simple.

Just like the dragon-phoenix dynasty, the dragon-phoenix dynasty was developing very quickly. However, there would be some City lords who didn’t take Feng Luan’s orders seriously.

The gathering power of the citizens was weak.

Just like the city lord of Windfrost City, just like The Prodigy competition of Flaming Sun City.

The city Lord didn’t take the Queen’s orders seriously. If it wasn’t for Wang Xian and Feng Luan, the prodigies of Flaming Sun City might have already been recruited by the blood flow sect.

This was the problem of control.

A weak control was the same as not having control.

Therefore, the blood stream empire didn’t unify the entire flowing sea region. They only controlled over twenty factions and became their subordinate factions.

This power was enough.

No matter how many cities there were, they could become a burden.

However, not every city could bring a huge amount of spirit stones to the empire. Some spirit stones even required the empire to spend money to maintain them.

What shocked everyone was that the legendary supreme prodigy was actually from the dragon-phoenix Empire.

Everyone’s gaze swept across the area where Feng Luan, Wang Xian, and the rest were. Their faces were filled with astonishment.

“I really didn’t expect that supreme prodigy was actually from the dragon-phoenix Empire!”

“This is a peerless powerhouse who could kill a fifth-level profound void martial artist. No wonder the dragon-phoenix Empire could rise so quickly!”

“With more than 500 void interpretation realm experts and two fifth level void interpretation realm experts, their strength is much stronger than the Light Dragon Dynasty and the Boundless Sea Dynasty!”

Exclamations sounded one after another, and their eyes flickered.

“Your Highness, we don’t have any opinions. We have the responsibility to fight against the human-demon graveyard. We will use as much strength as we have the responsibility. We Support Your Highness!”

“Our Zero Glory dynasty also supports the crown prince. The dragon-phoenix Dynasty has a supreme genius. It is easy to deal with a Blood Barbarian Demon Beast!”

“That’s right, that’s right. Those who are capable will work hard. In the future, the dragon-phoenix dynasty will be our role model!”

The Kings and Sect Masters of the various forces said with smiles on their faces.

For such a powerful force, they naturally hoped that the other party would be weakened.

Moreover, it was much better for others to deal with a top-tier king beast race like the Blood Barbaric Demon Beast Race than for them to do it themselves.

The rest of the forces immediately agreed with a smile on their faces.

They were very supportive of the Crown Prince’s order this time.

“Hehe, I have an opinion!”

At this moment, Wang Xian, who was sitting beside Feng Luan, shook the Teacup in his hand with a smile and said faintly.

“HMM?”

“HMM?”

Wang Xian’s sudden words caused everyone in the hall to be slightly stunned. They looked at him in astonishment and widened their eyes. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Do you have any objections?”

Prince Xue Liu was also slightly stunned when he heard Wang Xian’s words. He narrowed his eyes slowly and said, “Give me a reasonable reply, or else...”

As he spoke, the killing intent in his eyes was not concealed at all. He stared coldly at Wang Xian.

Before he could finish his sentence, everyone knew what was going to happen next.

“Hehe, what else can we do? Our Dragon and Phoenix Empire is going to deal with a top-tier demonic beast race alone. Heaven Sword Sect, Light Dragon Empire and Blood Stream sect are going to deal with another demonic beast race. May I ask, what’s the use of having your blood stream empire?”

“Are you just here to issue orders?”

Wang Xian leaned back on his chair and looked at the Crown Prince on the stage with a smile on his face.

“Wow!”

Wang Xian’s words were undoubtedly like a bomb on the calm surface of the water. It shocked everyone.

“You are courting death, nameless sword demon. Do you really think that you are so arrogant just because you are a Supreme Heaven’s pride expert?”

“How dare you speak to Your Highness the Crown Prince? Dragon and Phoenix Empire, I think you all want to Die!”

“Watch your words, you people who belong to this place!”

All of a sudden, all the experts from the Bloodflow Empire stood up and stared at Wang Xian coldly.

Even those affiliated to the Empire stood up and looked at them with murderous intent.

“Arrogant, you are too arrogant. I think all of you don’t want to leave this place today!”

The people from the life and death pill workshop and the biological forging workshop stood up with cold smiles on their faces. Their eyes were filled with disdain.

How dare they question the blood flow empire here? They were simply courting death!

Boom

At this moment, prince blood flow, who was standing in front of them, emitted a terrifying aura. He stared at Wang Xian and Feng Luan with a ghastly expression.

“Is this the intention of Your Dragon and Phoenix Empire?”

The powerful aura made the families and forces of the bloodshed empire in front of them quickly move aside to make way for him.

He stared at each other from afar. A blood-red glow shot out from his eyes.

“This world is not the world of your bloodshed empire. You called us here. We are not here to seek death, nor are we here to become chess pieces to be manipulated by others!”

Feng Luan slowly stood up, her gaze fixed on prince blood flow, and a faint sneer appeared on her face. “Even if it is your order, you must give us a reasonable explanation!”

“Explanation? Our blood flow empire has the strength, why should we explain to you? You Don’t have the qualifications!”

“An order is an order, you just have to obey. Otherwise, what awaits you is death. Don’t think that you are so powerful just because you have more than five hundred insightful void realm experts!”

“That’s right. There’s no need for the blood flow empire to make a move. Our combined strength has four to five hundred insightful emptiness realm experts. Do you really think that you are so amazing just because we praise you?”

Before prince blood flow could speak, the subordinate countries and the family forces of the blood flow empire shouted with cold expressions.

“Are the people of the dragon-phoenix Empire Courting Death?”

“Do they really think that they can fight against the bleeds empire just because they have more than 500 insightful void martial artists?”

“This... courting death is simply too arrogant!”

When some of the other forces saw the queen and Wang Xian of the dragon-phoenix Empire talking to the bleeds empire in such a manner, they shook their heads slowly.

“Why do I have to explain my actions to you?”

“What qualifications do you have!”

“You have three seconds to kneel or Die!”

At this moment, one of the elders standing beside the crown prince stood up slowly and stared at Wang Xian, Feng Luan, and the rest with an expressionless face!
