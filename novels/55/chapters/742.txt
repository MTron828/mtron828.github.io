Translator: 549690339

“Who dares to block our city gate?”

“Is it the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect? Are they f * cking courting death? Let’s go and kill them!”

“Whoever dares to block our city gate, we must teach them a lesson!”

They were furious. From today onwards, they would kill every Hunyuan Immortal sect disciple they saw!

As long as he was a person with blood in his veins, he would be extremely furious when he heard these words.

This was especially so for the disciples of the immortal sect. The Immortal sect, which was high and mighty, was now being blocked at the entrance of their home. They would kill every single one of them who dared to come out!

This was simply the most direct insult to their Hunyuan Immortal sect.

One by one, the Hunyuan Immortal sect disciples swarmed towards the entrance with weapons in their hands. They were filled with killing intent!

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Soon, the city gate was densely packed with more than a thousand people. There were also many Dan stage and Xiantian experts who flew on their flying swords and stood in the air.

They looked at the fifty people who were standing five hundred meters away from the city gate. All of them had gloomy expressions on their faces.

More than fifty people stood in a row with their hands behind their backs. They stared at the city gate with an invincible aura.

This attitude and behavior was the greatest contempt for the entire chaotic origin immortal sect!

“Damn it! More than fifty people are blocking our city gate. Let’s kill them!”

A Heaven’s favorite of the chaotic origin immortal sect stared at Mo Qinglong and the others below with a face full of anger and shouted loudly.

“Kill! Kill them!”

“Hang these damn fellows on the city wall and announce to the world the consequences of provoking our chaotic origin immortal sect!”

The excited chaos origin immortal sect disciples shouted loudly.

“Go, follow me!”

A young man who was blinded by anger moved and prepared to attack Mo Qinglong and the others.

“Retreat!”

An old man shouted and stopped the young man!

“Elder, are we just going to watch them act arrogantly in front of us?”

The young man said angrily.

“Stop! No one is allowed to go out!”

The old man moved his body and looked at the corpse embedded in the city wall. His expression was extremely ugly.

His body moved and he took out the corpse and held it in his hands.

“That’s... Deacon Wen!”

Some of the Hunyuan Immortal sect disciples who had just arrived were slightly shocked. Their faces revealed shock.

“No matter which faction you are from, if you dare to kill our Hunyuan Immortal sect’s disciples and block us here, we will definitely kill you!”

The Hunyuan Immortal Sect’s elder’s face darkened as he roared angrily!

“Don’t say these useless things. Today, if your Hunyuan Immortal sect’s disciples dare to attack us, we will definitely let you die here. If you have the guts, come out. Hunyuan immortal sect, Hehe!”

Mo Qinglong said with a disdainful expression as he crossed his arms in ridicule.

His voice once again spread over ten kilometers of Fang Yuan.

This caused the Hunyuan immortal sect disciples standing on the city gate to look as if their eyes were about to split open!

Blatant mockery!

They had been blocked at the gate!

But now, they could only watch!

“Elder, you must kill them. You must kill all of them!”

A disciple roared angrily.

“No one is allowed to leave. Don’t worry, none of them can leave!”

The old man’s eyes were cold. He looked up and saw another group of people walking over.

“They are from the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect!”

An exclamation came from the side. In the distance, more than forty people from the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect were flying over.

“Dong Dong Dong!”

At this moment, the sound of the gathering bell rang out from behind the immortal sect.

“No one is to go out!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The old man’s figure flashed as he flew towards the immortal sect.

“Domineering!”

At this moment, elder Feng led a group of assassins from the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect and rushed over. When he saw more than fifty people standing in a row, he couldn’t help but sigh.

This kind of boldness was not something an ordinary person could achieve.

“Brother Mo!”

Elder Feng hesitated for a moment before coming to Mo Qinglong’s side and shouting.

After all, both sides could be considered allies now!

“Yes, elder Feng. I was about to ask my disciple to look for you. Could you please give us information about the Hunyuan Immortal Sect’s heaven’s chosen disciples, elders, and deacons? It would be best if you also have information about their residence. We will need it in the next two days!”

Mo Qinglong looked at elder Feng and said.

“Okay, we have all this information!”

Elder Feng naturally knew the purpose of Mo Qinglong’s request. He quickly looked at the people beside him and said, “Brother Mo, let us join you!”

“Okay!”

Mo Qinglong nodded.

Elder Feng was a little embarrassed. After all, the difference in strength between the two sides was too great.

Especially those experts of the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect who were half-step infant realm and Dan realm, it was even more awkward.

No matter what, they were still experts and had some status in the immortal sect. Now that they were here.

They always had the feeling that the fox was using the Tiger’s might!

“Cough Cough!”

At this moment, a young man glanced at the experts beside him and then looked towards the city gate.

He turned his eyes and slightly raised his head as he jumped over the group of DRAKONIDS.

“Little thieves in front, I’ve already blocked your gate, why don’t you dare to come out?”

“F * ck, a group of useless things, they actually dared to sneak attack our crown prince, they actually dared to sneak attack our crown prince’s friends, how could they be so F * cking cowardly now!”

“Useless things, why are you standing on the city gate? Are you very angry? Then come out, a group of Cowards, a group of cowards!”

Cursing!

No, it should be cursing the city!

A Dan stage expert’s voice could be heard for more than ten kilometers.

Those humiliating words immediately caused everyone on the city wall to explode.

F * ck, not only was the city blocked, but now they were actually being scolded.

Moreover, it was a dan stage expert who was shouting.

With a roar, it spread across half of Hunyuan City. What the F * ck!

“Motherf * cker, ahhhhh, I’m going to kill them!”

An enraged, burly middle-aged man couldn’t help but move his body and directly attacked the young man who was shouting at the top of his lungs.

And in an instant, a DRAKONID moved.

“Peng!”

Beside the city gate, before anyone could react, the middle-aged man was directly slapped onto the ground by the terrifying dragon claws.

The terrifying attack instantly killed the middle-aged man on the spot!

When the young man who had cursed the city saw this scene, he could not help but shrink his head. Soon after, a hint of excitement appeared in his eyes.

“Hey, finally, a man with guts. This is a real man. He would rather die than be humiliated!”

“Look at the bunch of cowardly turtles and trash above you. They are unworthy of being men and are even calling themselves the Hunyuan immortal sect. From now on, they will be called the cowardly Turtle Immortal sect!”

As the young man spoke, he eagerly walked to the middle-aged corpse and placed it in the middle of the city gate.

He pointed at the corpse and shouted loudly, “Look, this is what heroes are like. Your great heroes, look at yourselves. Turtles, aren’t you ashamed!”
