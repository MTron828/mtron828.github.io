Chapter 3217: 3216 dragon-seizing palace, Dragon King of heaven-sea

“Ao Jin, leave the heaven-sea Dragon Palace to me. After we enter, bring him back to the Dragon Palace immediately!”

“Let’s Speed Up!”

When Wang Xian and the rest flew over, the incipient saint wings appeared behind him. He brought ao Jin along and flew toward the heaven-sea dragon palace at a terrifying speed.

Swoosh

When he brought him to the front of the heaven-sea Dragon Palace, Wang Xian changed his direction and immediately attacked the heaven-sea Dragon King.

With a move of his palm, a five elements millstone appeared in his hand. The five elements millstone directly attacked the skysea Dragon King.

“Skysea Dragon King, today is the day you die.”

He shouted softly, and a cold look appeared in his eyes.

“HMM?”

Wang Xian’s sudden attack stunned the experts from the horned seal race and the twin species. They looked over.

Boom

At this moment, the Tianhai Dragon King saw the attack of the Five Elements Millstone and felt its power. He revealed an extremely ugly expression. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The crown on his head flew up and crashed into the five elements millstone.

Bang! Bang! Bang

The sound of collision rang out. The five elements millstone flew toward Wang Xian.

“Let’s destroy him together!”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes and shouted.

“Kill!”

The two universe knights of the twin species squinted their eyes. The hurricane law condensed into wind demon and attacked the Tianhai Dragon King directly.

The horned seal race experts also flew towards the Tianhai Dragon King and swept their long tails.

“Roar, Roar, Roar, you deserve to die. Dragon King, you deserve to die. I didn’t go to kill you, but you dare to attack me. Roar, Roar, Roar!”

The eyes of the Tianhai Dragon King, who was instantly besieged, turned blood-red. He roared with a crazed look on his face.

He flapped his two crimson-gold dragon wings. Numerous sabers and Swords flew out and covered Wang Xian.

“Old Man, you still want to Covet Our Dragon King’s Bloodline? You’re really courting death.”

“Hehe, you won’t be able to escape today.”

The Voice of the Heaven Formation and the Willow deity rang out. Accompanied by terrifying attacks, they met the Sabers and Swords.

“Boom! Boom!”

The array and the dragon scale and willow leaf clashed with the Sky Sea Dragon King’s attack, completely cancelling it out.

“Eh? That’s the Dragon Palace? They’re so powerful.”

The two elders of the twin species saw this scene, and their expressions froze, their eyes filled with shock.

They had already witnessed the Sky Sea Dragon King’s strength, and it was definitely not something an ordinary fourth-level knight could contend against.

However, the two members of the Dragon Palace were able to withstand it directly.

This dragon palace was not simple.

Furthermore, the Dragon Palace had displayed three fourth-level universe knights at once. This was comparable to an intermediate-level universe race that was weak like them.

“Holy Dragon Shadow, Kill!”

Wang Xian’s gaze focused. A Holy Dragon Shadow appeared in the sky and charged toward the Sky Sea Dragon King.

“Horn region, break the barrier!”

The expert from the Horned Seal race roared. The horn on his head emitted a radiance and instantly attacked the Tianhai Dragon King.

“You Bunch of damned things. How Dare You Offend Me? Die!”

When the Tianhai Dragon King saw the terrifying attacks coming towards him, his expression was extremely ferocious.

The crown on his head shone brightly. A golden longsword and a golden longsword slashed towards them.

“Clang!”

The sound of the blades clashing was deafening as they swept through the surrounding space.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

Terrifying clashing sounds rang out as the sacred dragon’s figure slowly disappeared. The Horned Seal Race’s golden horn attack also gradually disappeared.

“Oh? This Sky Sea Dragon King is so strong.”

“The acquired Supreme Treasure in his hands is very strong!”

The horned seal race expert’s eyes were filled with shock when he saw this scene.

They thought that they could kill the Tianhai Dragon King with their own strength, but it seemed that it was impossible for them to do it by themselves.

“Fire Dragon Array, dissolve!”

At this moment, the attack of the Heaven Array descended again.

Fire conquers gold.

Four pillars descended around the Tianhai Dragon King. Divine Dragons rushed out from the fire pillars and attacked him.

“Wood Dragon Leaves!”

The Willow God waved her arms and countless willow leaves condensed into the shape of a wood divine dragon and attacked the Tianhai Dragon King.

The continuous attacks caused the Tianhai Dragon King’s expression to change drastically.

He had relied on the acquired supreme treasure to block the attacks from the experts of the Wang Immortal Horn Seal race. After that, two attacks covered him!

“Bang Bang Bang!”

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The Sky Sea Dragon King let out a blood-curdling scream. A large amount of blood flowed out from his mouth, causing his body to be in a sorry state.

His blood-red eyes stared at his surroundings, and his expression was abnormally ugly.

“All of you, just you wait. All of you, just you wait. One day, I will exterminate all of you. I will kill all of you!”

His face was filled with rage as he roared. His expression was ferocious and terrifying.

“HMPH, Little Evil Dragon, today is the day you die. You still want to kill us?”

The eyes of the two elders of the twin species were filled with a sinister look.

A magic staff appeared in their hands, and a hurricane surrounded the green magic staff.

The two waved their arms, and countless wind attribute needles shot towards the Sky Sea Dragon King.

“Today, I’ll cut off your head.”

The horned seal race warrior had a cold look in his eyes. He moved and rushed over.

The group attacked again.

“You Want to kill me? You Think You can kill me? A bunch of trash, even a Pinnacle Universe Knight couldn’t kill me, you think you can?”

Sky Sea Dragon King’s blood red eyes swept over them, filled with killing intent.

Facing the attacks of the experts, he wasn’t too afraid.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

“Just you wait, I’ll take revenge on you one by one.”

“Divine Crown Protection!”

He roared, and the crown on his head emitted a dazzling light, completely protecting his entire body.

At the same time, he flapped his enormous wings and flew directly into his Dragon Palace.

Even though Sky Sea Dragon King was arrogant and crazy, he still had one thing to rely on.

And that was his dragon palace.

Even though he was much weaker, the Dragon Palace was still that powerful Dragon Palace.

As long as he entered the Dragon Palace, no knight above level 9 could kill him.

He could enter the Dragon Palace and escape, looking for an opportunity to take revenge.

This was his greatest trump card, and also his capital to be arrogant and crazy.

“Stop him! He wants to escape back to his God Country! Stop Him!”

The expert from the horned seal race shouted loudly.

Wang Xian squinted his eyes and waved his arm. The five elements millstone above his head smashed toward the Sky Sea Dragon King.

Bang

However, the five elements millstone landed in front of his body and bounced to the side.

“Hahaha, just you wait for me, Dragon King.”

The Tianhai Dragon King laughed maniacally and dashed towards the Dragon Palace.

The Dragon Palace was very close to him. He only needed a few seconds to enter.

Once he entered, no one would be able to do anything to him.

“Not good, go after him!”

The expression of the experts from the horned seal race changed slightly as they shouted loudly.

“Hehe!”

At this moment, Wang Xian did not panic. Instead, he smiled faintly.

Buzz Buzz

At this moment, the Tianhai Dragon Palace trembled strangely.
