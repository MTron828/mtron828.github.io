One Level 2 universe ruler Angel, six level 1 battle angels, and a million strong Angel Army.

There were over 100 peak universe ruler Knight Level Battle Angels.

This batch of goods could add 200 to 300 peak knight level disciples to the Dragon Palace!

This was simply a huge harvest!

This was faster than searching for the resources of thousands of life planets!

Moreover, Wang Xian had also obtained a lot of resources and treasures from this angel. These resources and treasures were at least comparable to the harvest of hundreds of life planets!

This was simply too much!

He grinned and couldn’t help but laugh.

“However, I often do such things myself. I can’t even do it consecutively!”

He mumbled to himself. After killing this angel, Wang Xian was not prepared to continue his actions.

If a ruler-level Angel was killed, the angel race might suspect that they had encountered a powerful cosmic beast. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

However, if powerful angels were killed consecutively, the angel race would definitely investigate.

Wang Xian did not have the ability to fight against them. After this operation, it would take at least another hundred years for him to take action again.

It was best to be careful.

Similarly, it was the same for the Phoenix race.

After more than a hundred years, he was prepared to continue his mission!

Now, he would first head to the starry universe to search for resources.

Wang Xian was planning in his heart. Although it was nice to directly hunt down the powerhouses of the angel race and the Phoenix race, they were still a peak race after all. He had to be careful!

“Huh?”

Just as Wang Xian left and the Angel was killed by him, the angel race received the news.

They immediately sent their powerhouses to investigate the news.

Every ruler-level angel was their core combat strength.

Once they appeared, they had to investigate it.

Was it swallowed by the space behemoth or something else happened.

However, because the rules of the universe were different from the energy here in the universe, some methods could not be used!

Wang Xian did not care if the angel race would check it out.

At this moment, he was flying in a direction that was very, very far away!

“My current position should not be too far away from the exit. Continue to go deeper!”

Wang Xian continued to fly forward, searching for life planets.

Time passed by quickly.

Fifty years was just a snap of the fingers!

“I’m now one-fifth away from the resources for the next upgrade. My speed isn’t slow at all!”

Wang Xian was floating above a planet as he muttered.

He took a break and looked ahead before continuing to fly!

“Huh?”

After flying for another day, he looked ahead and discovered two life planets!

This made him smile!

With a move, Wang Xian flew over immediately.

“There are more treasures in these two life planets!”

Wang Xian sized them up and revealed a smile on his face. Then, he started to collect the treasures quickly!

“Roar!”

All of a sudden, a roar was heard. Wang Xian, who was collecting the resources, was slightly stunned.

He flew to the sky in an instant.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The next moment, a space beast with countless claws flew over rapidly. Its body was exuding a violent aura.

When Wang Xian saw it, his eyes narrowed. His face was filled with vigilance!

“This Space Beast’s strength has reached the Overlord level!”

His body moved and he quickly retreated backward.

The Overlord Level Space Beast was no longer something that Wang Xian could deal with!

With the suppression of the World origin, he could only escape.

“Run!”

Wang Xian didn’t hesitate at all and turned around to flee into the distance.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

In the next moment, he felt a terrifying tentacle flying toward him.

These tentacles left the body of the space beast directly. Their speed was abnormally terrifying!

“What the F * ck!”

Wang Xian looked over and revealed an expression of shock and anger. He activated his incipient saint wings to the maximum and flew into the distance rapidly!

“Spirit Spirit!”

Sensing the speed of the tentacles, his mind moved and the spirit spirit appeared beside him. “Boost!”

He shouted again and the spirit spirit immediately boosted his speed!

With the boost from the spirit spirit, Wang Xian’s speed increased a little!

“Ghost Avatar!”

At the same time, he immediately summoned his ghost avatar and fled in the direction of his surroundings!

At the back, hundreds of tentacles had locked onto him and were rapidly approaching him.

“These tentacles are so fast!”

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly. In just a dozen seconds, he was caught up!

“Change form of the Netherworld Dragon!”

His body trembled.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

The whistling sound of the tentacles was heard. In the next moment, Wang Xian disappeared.

If he didn’t leave this place, he would definitely be severely injured.

“Run!”

After switching to a Netherworld Ghost clone, Wang Xian continued to fly into the distance!

“I got rid of it!”

After flying for some distance, he heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that the space beast was no longer chasing after him!

“That space beast actually discovered me so quickly. I didn’t even notice it.”

He mumbled as his eyes sparkled!

He hesitated for a moment and could only fly to the right!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

However, after flying for half an hour, a familiar roar was heard again.

This made Wang Xian’s expression freeze.

He quickly looked over.

“What’s the situation? Is It still that Space Beast? Is it chasing after me?”

“No, it shouldn’t be chasing after me. The position isn’t right!”

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly. Without any hesitation, he continued to escape!

This time, he reacted faster than the last time and escaped further.

It was a close call.

“What’s going on? Why did I encounter this Space Beast Again?”

Wang Xian mumbled and frowned slightly.

He was sure that the last space beast chasing him was the same as this one.

However, it was a little strange that he was being chased the moment he entered this place!

“There’s a possibility!”

Wang Xian had a serious expression on his face.

That was that a ruler-level space beast had its own domain.

This was not impossible. On the contrary, the possibility was very high!

A ruler-level space beast was already a top-notch existence!

They had their own domain and territory. Anyone who entered recklessly would be considered as an invasion.

They would be attacked by them!

“My position shouldn’t be the center of the Space Beast. If that’s the case, I’m afraid it won’t be so easy to obtain a large amount of resources!”

He muttered.

However, all of this was just his guess. He still needed to test it out himself.

If that was the case, he would either change his direction and not go to the ruler-level space beast domain, or he would destroy the space beast.

At the moment, it was impossible for him to destroy the Dominion Level Space Beast!
