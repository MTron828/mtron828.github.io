Chapter 2948: easily swept through the glazed domain’s tremor 6

“The domain Lord and the others are here, the Dragon Palace’s experts are here, this is great, this is great!”

“Hahaha, with their arrival, we don’t have to be so worried!”

The voice of the god Emperor at the front caused all the glazed domain’s citizens to reveal an extremely excited expression.

They cheered loudly one by one.

!!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The god Emperors could not help but let out excited roars and sped up to welcome them.

“Domain Lord!”

“Sacred Lord!”

More than twenty God emperors flew over and shouted with smiles on their faces.

Their gazes swept over Prime Minister Gui and the others and were slightly surprised.

“Hehe, it’s been hard on all of you. The Dragon Palace has sent experts to support us this time. Let’s go back to the Sacred Domain First!”

The domain Lord said to the godly monarchs with a smile.

“It’s the domain Lord!”

The godly monarchs nodded and looked at the members of the Dragon Palace. They bowed and said, “Thank you for coming to support us, Dragon Palace. The glazed region is very grateful!”

“No Problem!”

Prime Minister Gui waved his hand!

“Not good, not good!”

At this moment, a scream came from the back.

“Not good, that devil lair has caught up, it has caught up!”

Another voice was heard, causing the domain Lord and the others who were floating in the Void to be slightly startled.

“What? It’s so fast. Didn’t they say that they would need at least another two to three days to catch up to us?”

“Oh no!”

The expressions of the god Emperors changed drastically as they nervously looked behind them.

The pupils of the domain Lord and the others shrunk slightly.

“Let’s Go! We will head over immediately!”

The expression of the domain Lord changed as he continued flying forward.

“Brother from the Dragon Palace, there are two leaders in those two devil caves. I wonder which two of the four great leaders are the Devils!”

“My current strength is only at the first level void God Emperor. I might have to trouble this brother later!”

“I have the true treasure of our glass domain, the glazed seven-colored emissary. It can greatly enhance your attack power and recovery ability!”

The domain Lord quickly flew forward. He took out the true treasure of the glass domain, the glazed seven-colored stone, and handed it to the devouring dragon.

“There’s no need!”

The Devouring Dragon shook his head and stared ahead.

“Jie Jie, what a great treasure. You can use this treasure as a reward for our Dragon Palace!”

Ba Qi looked over and said with shining eyes.

“The Dragon Palace has helped us so much that we can give it to them now!”

The domain Lord said.

“Jie Jie Jie!”

Ba Qi laughed.

“Devil Cave, what a terrifying Devil Cave!”

“How can they be so fast? Didn’t they say that they would need a few more days to catch up?” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Sounds of shock could be heard from below.

The domain Lord and the other godly monarchs quickly arrived at the back of the citizens of the glazed domain, which was also in front of the demon cave.

Hundreds of millions of kilometers away from them, the two enormous demon caves were like a hell that devoured people. Pairs of blood-red eyes were located in the demon cave, emitting a greedy and bloodthirsty look.

A terrifying aura rushed toward them.

Below them, all the citizens of the glazed area looked at the enormous demon caves in horror.

Once, even a demon cave required the entire glazed area to deal with it.

The glazed area was no match for the two demon caves.

Now that the two demon caves were coming, their faces were extremely pale as they felt the terrifying aura.

If they didn’t know that the domain Lord and the experts from the Dragon Palace had arrived, they would have already lost all hope.

“Fortunately, the experts from the Dragon Palace have arrived. Otherwise, the consequences would be unimaginable!”

At this moment, looking at the demon cave that was so close to them, the domain lord and the others rejoiced in their hearts.

“This is the demon cave? It’s very familiar!”

The eight-limbed demon Fiend and the others looked at the demon cave in front of them and said.

“Other than the demon cave on Earth, the others are almost the same!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded at the side.

“Roar, Roar, Roar!”

At this moment, the demon cave in front of them suddenly stopped, and dense roars came from inside.

“Roar, Roar, Roar!”

“Roar, Roar, Roar!”

However, in the next moment, the entire demon cave seemed to go crazy, and the roars began to be incessant.

One by one, evil demons flew out from the demon cave, their eyes filled with excitement and madness.

One, two, three…

Soon, countless evil demons flew out from the void in front of them.

However, this group of evil demons did not immediately attack them. Instead, they stared at them with Bloodlust and madness, floating in the void and swaying their bodies.

It was as if they were waiting for an order.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

At this moment, an even more majestic roar came from within. Hearing this roar, everyone’s hearts tightened, and they felt a sense of panic.

The domain Lord and the other God emperors stared at the two leaders that were about to appear in the demon caves.

A pitch-black creature with a body of only ten meters and a snake head that looked like a human body flew out from the demon caves on the left!

Its body was very small among the evil spirits, but its terrifying aura filled the more than twenty god-emperor level evil spirits with reverence.

It was the evil spirit of the four great leaders!

In the demon cave on the right, a blood-red evil spirit with two huge fangs and two pairs of blood wings was staring at them greedily.

It had a long black tongue and its tongue was filled with barbs. At this moment, saliva was dripping down.

It was the demonic being of the four great leaders!

Around it, there were also more than twenty god-emperor level demonic beings.

“Heehee! !”

Demonic being let out a sharp and strange cry. Its pair of triangular eyes were staring forward, filled with excitement.

“Ho ho ho!”

The Evil Sprite let out a roar and looked in the same direction.

“Ho ho ho!”

“Ho ho ho!”

Around it, growls echo.

“Fifty-two Celestial Emperors, the next is a hard battle, we must stop All Evil!”

“Also, order all civilians to flee immediately in the direction of the Holy Land!”

The domain Lord said in a deep voice when he saw the two demonic leaders and the demonic god Emperors.

“It’s the domain Lord!”

The God emperors nodded heavily.

“Lord God Emperor, hold off the demonic army for us. We’ll speed up our escape later!”

The experts below knew what to do without the glazed region God emperor’s orders.

They would only be a burden if they stayed here. The best choice was to leave quickly.

“Brothers of the Dragon Palace, we call the two demonic leaders on the left Mei and the one on the right sprite. Mei possesses a powerful concealment ability. Among the third level divine emperors…”

“Roar!”

“Leave it to us, the Devouring Dragons!”

The governor spoke to Prime Minister Gui and the others.

However, before he could finish speaking, the six devouring dragons charged over.

This caused the expression of the domain lord who spoke to change slightly.
