Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“Thank you all!” Wang Xian said and smiled as he looked at the few people at the same table.

“Hehe, Wang Xian already called us to come, how can we not turn up?!” Old Qin smiled back at Wang Xian.

“The bride and groom are out.”

“Today’s main characters are here.”

Just then, some voices came from the side. Wang Xian spun his head around and peered towards the back.

Everyone turned around too.

The clean-looking, white gown with a refined makeup turned Lan Qingyue into a ravishing beauty.

Every move of hers was giving off a unique vibe.

Liu Fei Yun, beside her, was in a blue suit with a long sword behind him. He looked around with a face full of smiles.

His dignified demeanor and confident appearance made him an elegant man too!

“They were made for each other!”

“The man is dashing while the lady is striking. Haha. Such a perfect match!”

The crowd was pouring endless praise when they saw the attractive couple walking on the red carpet.

“Let’s welcome the couple who are walking towards their happiness!”

A renowned host was holding onto a microphone with smiles on the front stage.

“Liu Fei Yun, 28 years-old, is well-known as Little Sword Celestial who is a well-mannered and impressive gentleman. Lan Qingyue, 22 years-old. She’s already the General Manager at Deep-sea Jewelry at such a young age, and she’s a famous talent in Rivertown. Today, they will be tying the knot over here!”

As the host introduced the couple, soft music was played. All the guests kept quiet as they watched smilingly.

“She’s still so beautiful!” Wang Xian looked at Lan Qingyue and displayed a faint grin.

Upon hearing his comment, Old Qin and Old Xue threw him a gaze as they widened their smiles. Even heroes have a weakness for the charms of a beautiful woman.

“Look, they’re here!” As they were approaching, the host said with smiles, “Please face our friends and relatives. Today, they will be witnessing the couple tying the knot of a lifetime!”

Liu Fei Yun turned around as he grinned from ear to ear. Lan Qingyue followed suit too.

“Thank you for attending the engagement ceremony of Mr. Liu Fei Yun and Ms. Lan Qingyue. Today will mark a new beginning for the couple. Let’s give them our most sincere congratulations.”

“Today, all of you will witness the engagement of the couple!”

“Even though this is not the wedding ceremony, getting engaged is equivalent to proposing. I wonder if the fiance has prepared anything!” The host looked at Liu Fei Yun with smiles.

Liu Fei Yun returned a grin to him. “Of course!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Then let your show begin!” the host joked.

An engagement was different from a wedding. The fiance had to propose on the grand stage.

Liu Fei Yun drew his lips slightly. After he took two slow steps backward, he swung his arm, and the long sword behind him was drawn into the air.

He threw his arm up, grabbed the long sword, and began his sword dance.

In amongst flowers with a bottle of wine,

I drink alone for there is no one close by.

I raise my chalice to invite the shining moon,

the moon casts me a shadow, and we have a triad.

Since the moon never learns to drink,

my shadow absent-mindedly shall follow me.

Nevertheless, I have them around me,

enjoying the moments, just like how it should be.

I sing, and the moon lingers,

I dance, and my shadow whirls under.

In my sober moments, we rejoice together.

And we bid goodbye as soon as I am drunk.

Such fellowship shall last despite our parted ways.

Only heaven knows when we shall come together again.

A sword danced in front of the audience. As Liu Fei Yun wielded his sword, he recited one of Li Bai’s renowned poems, “Drinking alone under the moon.” His sword was gleaming with a faint and wavering glow from the moon, which was beautiful and extravagant.

The audience was taken aback by Liu Fei Yun’s swordplay such that they could not hide their shocking expressions.

“Little Sword Celestial’s swordsmanship seems to be much stronger than what the rumors claimed it to be. Gosh, this is impressive!”

“His sword seems to have drawn a picture in the air. Young Master Liu’s swordsmanship is getting more powerful. He lives up to the name of Little Sword Celestial!”

“Haha, awesome. It’s indeed the Art of Sword Celestial. Well done!”

An elder with a full white beard was sitting in the front row, looking ebullient when he gazed at the strokes Liu Fei Yun displayed.

Liu Fei Yun was even more proud when he noticed the surprised looks from the audience. He then turned to Lan Qingyue.

“Wine and moon were the most loyal companions throughout Li Bai’s entire life. I hope, Qingyue, you can become my most loyal companion in my life too. Just recently, I obtained the Sword Celestial’s inheritance, and I’ll rise to the highest level in no time. As my wife, you’ll also enjoy a high status with me!” As Liu Fei Yun spoke, he pointed the long sword into the air, and a diamond ring appeared on the top.

He threw his long sword back into its scabbard and took the diamond ring as he gazed smilingly at Lan Qingyue.

“Qingyue, will you be my companion?” Liu Fei Yun looked at the ravishing Lan Qingyue.

“Wow, this is so romantic. If someone were to propose to me like this, I’d say yes immediately!” All the females in the crowd were falling head over heels for him.

Liu Fei Yun, who performed swordplay, was simply too romantic and touching!

“I didn’t expect that Young Master Liu could obtain the Sword Celestial, Li Bai’s inheritance. No wonder the sword dance was beautiful, yet ferocious. What a surprise.”

“I heard that he won the auction of Li Bai’s authentic calligraphy. He’s such a talent to have comprehended its essence in such a short time. He even obtained the inheritance. He’s such a gifted man!”

“Given Young Master Liu’s talent, he will take over Old Liu’s position and become the next Inborn Sword Celestial of the Liu Family.”

When the audience heard what Liu Fei Yun said, they were struck by surprise. The talent displayed by Liu Fei Yun was daunting.

Lan Qingyue fell into a trance-like state as she gazed at Liu Fei Yun and the diamond ring in his hand.

A different phase of life would begin as soon as she received the ring.

Immense bitterness filled her eyes as she closed them.

“Hur?” Upon seeing how Lan Qingyue was responding, Liu Fei Yun frowned slightly. Impatience flashed in his eyes as he sounded stiff. “Qing Yue, will you say yes to me?”

“Of course not!”

Just when Lan Qingyue opened her eyes to accept her fate, a voice cut the silent air in the engagement ceremony.

Upon hearing the voice, Lan Qingyue jerked slightly as she spun around with disbelief. She stared hard at Wang Xian.

“Hur?” An abrupt voice had stunned everyone from the Lan and Liu Family.

Liu Fei Yun, on the stage, turned around immediately. When he saw Wang Xian, he was slightly taken aback. Soon after, he glared at Wang Xian with a murderous face.

“Who are you, brat? How dare you spout nonsense here. Seeking your own doom?”

A middle-aged man who was sitting beside the white-bearded old man stood up. He stared at Wang Xian with a sharp and ferocious look as he shouted at him.

The white-bearded old man swept his gaze across Wang Xian before he turned to look at the seniors from Lan Family unhappily. Apparently, he was displeased with the fact that the person who had interrupted was a guest of the Lan Family.

“I’m Wang Xian!” Wang Xian returned a smile to that middle-aged man as he replied impassively.
