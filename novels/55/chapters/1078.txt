Translator: 5496903

So what if he threatened you?

When Haven’s arrogant voice sounded, everyone’s faces revealed an embarrassed expression.

A Guy, because of his own selfish desires, caused the death of four companions, and now he even pointed at the commander and said that he threatened you!

This kind of arrogant behavior made everyone have an impulse to kill him.

However, no one dared to make a move!

The general’s son, the descendant of a void interpretation expert, who dared to touch him?

Just as he said, as long as someone dared to touch even a hair on his head, what they would face next might be the revenge of a void interpretation expert.

Especially, there was a riding wind battle team here in Holy Sea Town, a large battle team of the ocean cultivator army.

This battle team was all his father’s subordinates. At this time, even if he said these words, no one would be able to do anything.

His background was too strong. It was so strong that no one dared to make a move.

When the few instructors of the ocean cultivator academy heard Hai Wen’s arrogant voice, the corners of their mouths twitched and they turned their faces to the side.

However, they didn’t say anything. Speaking of which, they were all subordinates of Hai Wen’s father.

“Are you threatening me?”

When Wang Xian heard his words, his eyes flickered slightly. A hint of killing intent appeared in the eyes of the eleven golden swordfish at the side.

“Huh?”

The old man from the Ocean College, the old man from the East Ocean College, and the President of the Employment Association of Holy Sea town instantly sensed the killing intent of the Golden Swordfish.

The three of them changed their expressions slightly.

“Don’t take yourself too seriously, commander-in-chief? Do you believe...”

“Alright, Young Master Hai!”

However, Hai Wen didn’t sense the killing intent of the Golden Swordfish at all. He continued to speak arrogantly. When the old man from the ocean college saw this situation, he hurriedly interrupted him.

“Humph, I’ll go back First!”

Haowen did not say anything else. He noticed the disgruntled expressions of the people around him and knew that he could not stay here any longer. He snorted coldly again and wanted to leave.

He turned around. The students from the three major academies and the experts from holy sea town had ugly expressions on their faces. However, they still took the initiative to open up a path.

Crash

At this moment, four figures blocked the path directly. Their cold eyes were filled with killing intent as they stared at him.

“Did I let you go?”

At the same time, a cold voice was heard, causing Hai Wen to stiffen up.

He turned around with a gloomy expression and stared at Wang Xian with his dark eyes. “How dare you stop me!”

“Commander Wang!”

The old man from the Ocean Academy also looked at Wang Xian with an unpleasant expression.

Although all of this was Hai Wen’s fault, he couldn’t let anything happen to him no matter what.

“The ones who died were the people from the East Ocean Academy and Ocean Academy. If you don’t care, I won’t get involved in this mess. However, if you dare to threaten me, it won’t be so simple!”

Wang Xian looked at the old man from the Ocean Academy and revealed a cold expression.

“Do it, cripple him!”

Wang Xian looked at the Golden Swordfish and the rest and said immediately.

“Wang Xian, don’t cause trouble for yourself!”

The old man from the Ocean Academy shouted loudly. The aura on his body trembled and the aura of an extraordinary level eight powerhouse was emitted directly.

The few instructors at the side also held their weapons tightly and stared at Wang Xian with an embarrassed expression.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang

However, at this moment, a golden sword ray came from the surroundings and locked onto the five people from the Ocean Academy. The terrifying sword ray could be seen floating around the five of them with the naked eye.

The expression of the old man from the Ocean Academy changed drastically. He looked at the golden goldfish that had locked onto them with a hint of fear in his eyes.

Four of them were at transcendent level eight and four of them were at transcendent level eight!

Whoosh

The other Golden Swordfish moved. With a flash, he appeared beside Hai Wen.

Hai Wen’s face was filled with shock. Everything happened in a split second. He could feel that someone was grabbing his neck tightly.

There was no time for him to react!

“Stop! If you dare to make a move, the general will not let you off!”

The old man from the oceanography school shouted in shock.

Everyone was stunned. Wang Xian actually dared to make a move on the general’s son. This...

This was simply offending a general and an insightful void martial artist.

He would not be able to stay in the entire star-moon kingdom in the future!

“Bang!”

The old man from the oceanography school responded with a palm. The palm landed heavily on Hai Wen’s chest.

“Ah!”

A scream came from his mouth. His eyes were wide open and filled with disbelief.

“You... you guys actually... actually dared to cripple me... you deserve to die...”

Hai Wen’s eyes were in a trance. He stared at Wang Xian with his face twisted from the pain and spat out traces of blood.

“Continue to threaten me?”

Wang Xian said to him with a cold smile.

“Wang Xian, how dare you... How dare you make a move!”

The old man from the ocean academy was trembling slightly. He stared at Wang Xian and growled in a low voice.

Wang Xian looked at the old man and sneered. He was a little disdainful. “I really don’t know how an insightful void martial artist has such a foolish son. So what if I kill him?”

His words caused the old man’s expression to change again.

So what if I kill him? At most, he wouldn’t stay in star-moon kingdom anymore. He would go to other kingdoms. You are an insightful void martial artist, so what if you are a general?

What can you do if you kill and run away?

Wang Xian’s words also stunned everyone. Two words appeared in their minds: you have guts!

However, at this moment, Hai Wen was panicking. A hint of fear flashed in his eyes.

The other party dared to attack him directly. If he was really killed, he would be finished. He only had one life left!

He was afraid and his body was trembling!

“Please, don’t kill me. Please, I was wrong!”

Hai Wen swallowed a mouthful of saliva. He looked at Wang Xian hurriedly and kept on saying.

He begged for mercy. He begged for mercy.

The tough ones were afraid of the tough ones. The tough ones were afraid of the tough ones who didn’t care about their lives!

When he thought about how Wang Xian dared to kill him, his arrogance from before completely disappeared. He begged for mercy with a face full of panic.

Wang Xian looked at him mockingly.

“If you let me go, I will definitely not seek revenge in the future. Let Me Go!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

When Hai Wen saw his expression, his heart was even more terrified as he shouted loudly.

“Student Wang Xian, don’t be rash. Don’t be Rash!”

The old man from the Ocean Academy was filled with panic.

D * mn, he didn’t expect Hai Wen to be so stupid and arrogant. He also didn’t expect Wang Xian to be so reckless.

Now, just five of his underlings had displayed the strength of a level eight extraordinary. They didn’t have the strength to save Hai Wen.

Now, they could only hope that Wang Xian wouldn’t be so rash.

When the surrounding people saw this scene, they felt very pleased. Even the students of the ocean and east ocean academies were filled with excitement.

They looked at Wang Xian with admiration.

The death of four students made them feel like a fox mourning the death of a rabbit.

Wang Xian’s actions made him feel that the resentment in his heart had eased a little.

If it was not because they were afraid of Hai Wen’s background, they would have cheered for him long ago!

Looking at Havin, they looked at him mockingly.

So what if he was threatening you just now?

Now he’s begging you not to kill me?
