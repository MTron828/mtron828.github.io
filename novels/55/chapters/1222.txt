“If you don’t know what’s good for you and don’t know the rules, you won’t Live Long!”

The old man who was standing in the air said to Wang Xian coldly. He waved his arm gently.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Beside him, more than ten middle-aged men landed on the ground and surrounded Wang Xian and his shop.

“Kill this kid for me!”

The Fat Young Man’s arrogant voice rang out once again.

After he finished speaking, his eyes flickered as he stared at the shop behind Wang Xian. A smug look appeared on his face.

He thought that he would be in a miserable state after being sent here by the royal family. However, he didn’t expect that he would be able to obtain such a huge treasure within two days.

Putting aside the weapons, just five demonic beast cubs were worth 70 to 80 billion middle-grade spirit stones.

That was 70 to 80 billion!

It was definitely a huge sum of money!

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang

The group of people surrounding Wang Xian’s shop pulled out their weapons and let out a cold voice.

The aura of an insightful void martial artist hovering in the sky locked onto Wang Xian and was ready to attack at any moment.

“You dare to touch my brother, the nine stars empire? I think you are all courting death!”

However, at this moment, an icy cold voice sounded.

“What?”

The voice came from the north, causing the people from the nine star empire who were about to make a move to be slightly startled. They hurriedly looked towards the sky.

Even the nine star Empire’s profound void stage expert was slightly startled. He hurriedly looked over.

Someone who dared to call the nine star empire courting death was definitely not simple.

“He came at the right time. It seems that Long Xiaotian is really a brother!”

Wang Xian smiled when he saw Long Xiaotian flying over with at least 200 people.

Out of the 200 people, more than 50 of them were riding Black Shadow Panthers.

Standing beside Long Xiaotian was Bai Qingshan and Princess Long Luo.

At this moment, Long Xiaotian was staring at the insightful emptiness realm expert of the nine stars Empire with a cold expression.

Even if the other party was an insightful emptiness realm expert, he was still not afraid. This was the foundation of a powerful dynasty.

“The second Prince of the Light Dragon Dynasty!”

“It’s him, it’s actually the second Prince of the Light Dragon Dynasty. This young man is actually the second Prince’s friend. No wonder, no wonder he dares to oppose the nine Star Dynasty!”

“Haha, this time, the people of the nine Star Dynasty are dumbfounded. They’ve kicked an iron board. The Light Dragon dynasty is currently selecting a crown prince. It’s said that the possibility of this second prince is very high!”

“Hiss, as expected of the Light Dragon Dynasty. Just one Prince’s foundation is already so strong!”

The people who were watching the show showed a shocked expression when they saw long Xiaotian and the rest flying over.

Compared to a month ago, long Xiaotian’s influence had increased by a lot.

In the past, he only had more than 50 subordinates. Now, there were more than 200 of them.

His gaze swept across the 100 or so new subordinates. Among them, two were at half-step void interpretation, six were at transcendent level nine, and the rest were at transcendent level six.

“The development is really fast!”

Wang Xian looked at long Xiaotian and the rest with a smile on his face.

“Oh no, the second Prince of the Light Dragon Dynasty!”

At this moment, the faces of the people from the nine Dragon Dynasty changed drastically. The old man who was floating in the sky had an embarrassed look on his face. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The Fat Young Man at the side had a pale face and beads of cold sweat appeared on his forehead.

The difference between the nine dragons empire and the Light Dragon Empire was huge. Even if three or four nine dragons empire combined, they wouldn’t be able to defeat one light dragon empire.

The second prince flying towards them was enough to make the nine dragons empire extremely fearful.

After all, he was someone who might become the king of the Light Dragon Empire in the future.

Long Xiaotian led the group to Wang Xian’s shop.

He swept his cold gaze across the people from the nine stars dynasty and walked towards Wang Xian with a smile on his face.

“I’m sorry, brother Wang Xian. I’m late. Let a bunch of reckless people come and provoke you!”

He laughed out loud and walked towards Wang Xian.

“It’s not too late. The timing is perfect!”

Wang Xian revealed a smile on his face.

“Brother Wang!”

Long Luo walked over and smiled at Wang Xian.

“Hiss!”

When the nine stars Empire saw the group of people, the second prince, and the Princess of the Light Dragon Empire being familiar with Wang Xian, their pupils constricted slightly.

This young man had an unusual relationship with the second prince.

“Second prince, I’m really sorry. We didn’t know this person was actually a friend of the second prince. It’s our fault. It’s Our Fault!”

The nine stars Empire’s insightful emptiness realm expert hurriedly landed on the ground. He cupped his hands at Long Xiaotian and apologized.

The Fat Young Man and five other young men and women beside him hurriedly followed.

“Hehe, I just heard that you want to kill my brother!”

Long Xiaotian sneered at his apology, and looked at the Fat Young Man and the others.

Under his attention, the Fat Young Man and the others instantly turned pale.

“Your Highness, it’s US who didn’t know that this is your friend. If we knew, we definitely wouldn’t say such words. This is one hundred spirit liquid. I hope your highness can calm down!”

The nine Star Dynasty’s insightful emptiness realm expert cupped his hands with a somewhat embarrassed expression and took out one hundred spirit liquid.

“I lack your one hundred spirit liquid?”

Long Xiaotian’s expression was cold as he took two steps forward, not giving him any face at all.

This caused the expression of the nine star dynasty’s insightful emptiness realm expert to change slightly.

“Hiss, the second Prince of the Light Dragon dynasty is so powerful!”

“He has the capital to be so powerful. Look at the people around the second prince, they can destroy the people of the nine Star Dynasty!”

“It seems that this second prince has a very high chance of inheriting the throne. The forces under him are very powerful!”

The surrounding people saw Long Xiaotian’s powerful appearance and were slightly surprised.

The demeanor of a King!

“Your Highness, What Do You Want?”

The nine stars Dynasty’s insightful void martial artist looked extremely embarrassed as he asked Long Xiaotian.

“HMPH!”

Long Xiaotian snorted coldly as he looked at Wang Xian who was beside him. “Brother Wang Xian, tell me how to deal with him. Don’t worry, just tell me directly. Leave the rest to me!”

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly. He did not shirk nor did he have any scruples. He stared at the plump young man.

“Just take his life!”

Wang Xian’s cold voice rang out.

“What, you...”

When the fat young man heard Wang Xian’s words, he revealed an embarrassed expression. His expression changed drastically and his body trembled slightly!

The nine stars Dynasty’s insightful void martial artist’s expression changed slightly as well.

This was the young Royal Highness, a member of the Royal Family!

“Alright!”

Long Xiaotian immediately replied. His gaze was fixed on the nine Star Dynasty’s void interpretation expert. He extended his hand and pointed at the fat young man. “Is he going to die, or are all of you going to stay here!”

An overbearing voice entered the ears of everyone in the nine Star dynasty.

Their expressions changed greatly. They looked at the people around Long Xiaotian, and a trace of fear appeared in their eyes.

The expression of the nine star empire’s insightful emptiness realm expert also changed drastically. He did not expect that this second Prince of the Light Dragon Empire would be so unscrupulous for the sake of a young man.
