Chapter 1348: The strength of the 1348 Dragon Palace had increased tremendously

In the sky, Wang Xian, Guan Shuqing, and the other girls were flying at the front.

The rest of the members of the Dragon Palace stayed at the back and flew above the vast ocean.

“Peng!”

The group of people moved and dived into the water, flying towards the bottom of the ocean.

“Dragon King, the Dragon Palace is located near the sea. As the number of people from the dragon-phoenix dynasty increases, we often have to avoid the discovery of humans. Should we move the Dragon Palace to the side of the deep-sea spiritual spring?”

The group of people soon arrived at the location of the deep sea spiritual spring and met up with the other members of the Dragon Palace. Prime Minister Gui, who was at the side, asked Wang Xian.

“Yes, it’s time to move. It’s no longer suitable to be placed near the sea!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

The Dragon Palace was no longer suitable to be placed near the sea for development. It was completely lacking in resources. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

At that time, it was because the dragon palace was too weak and had no choice but to be placed near the sea.

Now, even in the flowing sea region, the Dragon Palace’s strength was not considered weak. It was almost comparable to a small dynasty.

After absorbing all the resources from the Sky Island dynasty, the Dragon Palace’s strength would be greatly enhanced.

“Leaders, nine flood dragons, follow me back and move the Dragon Palace here. Shu Qing, Lingxiu, wait here for a while!”

Wang Xian said to them and transformed into his dragon form. He led Prime Minister Gui and the rest towards the Dragon Palace.

With Wang Xian’s full speed, he arrived at the Dragon Palace in about ten minutes.

“Enter the Dragon Palace and Teleport!”

Wang Xian floated in the sky. With a move, a terrifying force caused the entire Dragon Palace to rise.

Wang Xian floated in the sky above the Dragon Palace. With a focused gaze, he immediately activated the ability of a level-three dragon palace.

Teleportation!

Teleportation could be performed within a 500-kilometer radius of the sea-pacifying needle in the Dragon Palace.

When Wang Xian activated the teleportation ability of the Dragon Palace, the entire Dragon Palace was shrouded in azure seawater. A whirlpool slowly formed.

It was as if a black hole had appeared in the sky above the Dragon Palace.

Buzz

In an instant, the Dragon Palace appeared at the limit of teleportation. It was only about 100 kilometers away from the deep sea spiritual spring.

“Prime Minister Gui, guard the surroundings. Let’s Go!”

Teleportation could only be used once a month. He would have to teleport himself next.

Hovering above the Dragon Palace, the nine flood dragons, Prime Minister Gui, and the other leaders were stationed in all directions to prevent the demon beasts and fierce beasts from coming to disturb them.

This place was basically close to the center of the flowing sea. If one wanted to step into a wider area, they had to go to a wider area.

The vast sea was also the ocean of the vast area.

“This... the dragon palace can actually migrate!”

In less than five minutes, Zhang Fengying looked at the huge object flying over with a shocked face.

It was like being on land and seeing a city that could fly.

“Xiaoxian has obtained a heaven-defying inheritance. This dragon palace has many uses. Let us show you around later!”

Sun Lingxiu looked at Zhang Fengying with a smile and said.

“Thank you!”

Zhang Fengying looked at the more beautiful girls beside her and nodded with a smile.

Although the girls were slightly displeased with the sudden appearance of another girl, they had no choice.

The way of the King did not only have the world, but also beautiful girls.

All they could do was to join hands and forbid the female fairies from approaching.

However, they knew about Zhang Fengying’s special situation.

Boom

The Dragon Palace landed slowly and Wang Xian was suspended in the air.

“Prime Minister Gui, bring all the spiritual stones and the metal materials of the void interpretation level over!”

Wang Xian stared at the Dragon Palace and said with a twinkle in his eyes.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded his head and flew over immediately with his interspatial rings. He looked at Wang Xian in astonishment and said, “Dragon King, you are trying to upgrade the level of the Dragon Palace!”

“That’s right, the Dragon Palace can be upgraded now!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and took out one resource after another.

These resources were obtained by Wang Xian from the people from the cold sect. The rest were obtained from the Heaven Island dynasty.

To upgrade the Dragon Palace, one would need about a trillion middle-grade spirit stones and dozens of tons of metal materials of the void interpretation level.

In addition, one would also need formations of the void interpretation level.

Wang Xian had all these things.

Boom

When the Dragon Palace landed at the bottom of the sea, it was perfectly compatible with the surrounding environment.

“To upgrade the Dragon Palace, one trillion middle-grade spirit stones and ten formations of the void interpretation level...”

Wang Xian looked at the requirements for the upgrade and took out the items from his interspatial ring.

“I found ten void interpretation level formations. Do you want to merge them to upgrade the level of the Dragon Palace?”

“I found ten billion middle-grade spirit stones and ten tons of void interpretation materials to upgrade the level of the Dragon King Palace!”

...

One by one, the materials were taken out and quickly absorbed by the Dragon Palace.

One by one, the level of the buildings increased rapidly.

“Ding! All the buildings in the Dragon Palace have been upgraded to level four. The level of the Dragon Palace has been upgraded!”

At this moment, at the bottom of the 30,000-meter-deep sea, the 80-kilometer-wide Dragon Palace underwent another earth-shaking change.

All the buildings were expanding at a terrifying speed.

The ocean-pacifying needle, which was more than 500 meters tall, slowly became 1,500 meters tall.

The Dragon King’s palace within a ten-kilometer radius had doubled in size. The huge dragon throne had grown to about five-hundred meters!

Every corner of the Dragon Palace was growing rapidly.

Especially the spiritual energy that was gushing over like liquid!

“All members of the Dragon Palace, head to the Dragon Pool to increase your strength!”

Wang Xian’s gaze was suspended above the Dragon Palace. Looking at the members of the Dragon Palace who were kneeling around him, he ordered loudly.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

All the members of the Dragon Palace were filled with excitement.

The size of a level four dragon palace had increased from 80 kilometers to about 150 kilometers.

It was even larger than the Sky Island dynasty!
