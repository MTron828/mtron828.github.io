Chapter 929: 0930 he was the leader of the Dragon Assassin Group

Translator: 549690339

“I’m the leader of the Celestial Phoenix Mercenary Group!”

“I’m the leader of the Dragon Assassin Group!”

When Wang Xian’s words rang out, the surrounding sword scar mercenary group and the group of martial artists were completely stunned.

When they saw a strange creature instantly killing the group of martial artists and saw the red piece of paper, they felt a sense of horror in their hearts!

Especially when Wang Xian said that he was the leader of the Dragon Assassin organization, everyone’s pupils couldn’t help but shrink!

“How is this possible? How can you be the leader of the Dragon Assassin Organization? !”

Dao Hen also widened his eyes. His eyes were filled with disbelief. He stared at the group of strange monsters with an ugly expression as he held the long saber in his hand tightly.

“Hehe, congratulations to all of you. You are not the first to meet the dragon assassin, nor will you be the last. However, all of you are the first to make me fight with all my might!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with a strong fighting spirit!

He was no longer the Wang Xian who had just arrived at the transcendence continent. He was no longer the Dragon King who had to endure and endure back then!

Long Xiao of the nine heavens started from the small town of Shenghai Town!

Ao Jian and the rest slowly dispersed, holding the golden longsword tightly in their hands!

Dao Hen and the rest looked extremely embarrassed. Their eyes were twitching violently. They were both furious and fearful.

An ant that they felt could be squashed to death easily turned into a terrifying elephant all of a sudden. This feeling made them extremely uncomfortable.

This was especially so for the group of people behind Dao Hen’s mercenary group. They saw that Dao Hen wanted to recruit members and that Dao Hen’s mercenary group wanted to destroy the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group.

Initially, they wanted to come over to express their goodwill and help Dao Hen mercenary group destroy the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group.

In their eyes, this was a very good opportunity to curry favor with Captain Dao Hen. However, they didn’t expect it to turn out like this.

The 20 experts who were at least at extraordinary level three who surrounded the celestial phoenix mercenary group were instantly killed.

“I’m sorry, Captain Wang. It’s our fault. We don’t want to be enemies with you. Please let us out. We can listen to your orders. Please!”

At this moment, the middle-aged man who said that he wanted Wang Xian and the rest to commit suicide begged for mercy with a face full of cold sweat.

He threw away his weapon and put his palms together. His face was full of fear.

“Commander Wang, Young Master Wang, young master Wang, I also... I also...”

“Shut up!”

A middle-aged man begged for mercy while another middle-aged man said with a face full of fear. However, just as he spoke, Dao Hen’s cold voice was heard.

At this moment, Dao Hen stared coldly at Wang Xian with one eye. He had gone through more than ten life-and-death situations, but he was able to survive each time.

This time, he didn’t think that he would die for sure.

His cold one eye swept across Wang Xian and the rest. “Among you, none of you have reached transcendent level seven. Do you think you can kill me with just these sneak-attacking monsters? “Kid, when I fought with my life, you were still a Bug!”

As he spoke, he raised the long saber in his hand. “All of you, hold on to your weapons. They are just a bunch of people who are bluffing. So what if they are from the Dragon Assassin Organization?”

“What? There is no transcendent level seven?”

“Since leader Dao Hen said there is no such thing, there must be no such thing!”

“So what if there’s a dragon spike? Our Leader Dao Hen has been through dozens of years to reach this stage. Why would he be afraid of an assassin organization that has just emerged?”

“That’s right. Assassins are only terrifying when they are hidden. Why would we be afraid of a direct battle?”

The members of the Dao Hen mercenary group clenched their weapons with vicious expressions and stared at Wang Xian and the rest with murderous intent!

“As expected of the knife scar mercenary group. As expected of the number one mercenary group in Shenghai Town. However, all of you will die today!”

Wang Xian looked at them and was filled with fighting spirit in an instant. A cold expression appeared on his face. He wasn’t afraid of arousing their fighting spirit.

This was the reason why it was interesting.

“Kid, I will chop your corpse into eighteen pieces!”

Dao Hen growled in a low voice. His one eye was filled with calmness!

“Kill!”

Wang Xian clenched his fist slightly.

...

Outside the formation, a black light barrier rose up and covered an area of three kilometers.

This sudden change stunned the hundreds of thousands of people on the city wall.

“What’s going on? What’s going on? Why did a black barrier suddenly rise up!”

“That’s an array formation! It’s a transcendent level 8 array formation!”

“What’s going on? This array formation couldn’t have been activated by the Blade Scar Mercenary Group!”

“It was activated by the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group. Could it be? Could it be that the immortal Phoenix Mercenary Group has a powerful foundation?”

When the array formation rose up and covered an area, everyone revealed shocked expressions.

It was an array formation that covered a thousand meters in height and a radius of three thousand meters. Everyone could sense the terrifying defense contained within the array formation.

It was extremely difficult to break this array formation.

Why did the immortal Phoenix mercenary group directly use the array formation to envelop everyone? Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Could it be that they still had a trump card?

“It’s an array formation of transcendent rank 8. Even if I wanted to break it, it would take some time!”

Jin Qianyuan looked at the array formation that suddenly appeared and revealed a surprised expression.

The defensive array formation in holy sea town was only at transcendent rank 9, but the immortal Phoenix mercenary group used an array formation of transcendent rank 8.

Even he didn’t have such a precious array formation!

“This Immortal Phoenix mercenary group is not simple. A small mercenary group appeared out of nowhere. As far as I know, he spent tens of millions of middle-grade spirit stones in the Immortal Phoenix Pill and weapons workshop. His background is definitely not that simple!”

An elder beside Jin Qianyuan said in a low voice.

“Immortal Phoenix? Immortal Phoenix?”

Jin Qianyuan glanced at shopkeeper Liu and the woman. “Is this mercenary group cultivated by Immortal Phoenix Pill and weapons workshop? Or are they the elite disciples behind them?”

“However, based on my observation, it’s impossible for the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group to kill Dao Hen and the others!”

Jin Qianyuan was a bit confused.

“Even if the immortal Phoenix mercenary group Trapped Dao Hen and the others with an array formation, they wouldn’t be a match for Dao Hen and the others!”

“Could it be that they want to trap Dao Hen and the others inside and starve them to death?”

“Eh, the possibility is very small, but no matter how you look at it, the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group is going to die. This might be a death struggle!”

After a moment of shock, everyone on the city wall recovered and discussed.

Shopkeeper Liu and the woman frowned as they stared at the array formation below.

It was a level eight extraordinary formation. They could not see what was happening inside and could only wait here.

“Roar! Roar!”

Within the formation, a dragon’s roar was heard. The terrifying sound instantly filled the entire area.

Following that, under the shocked gazes of everyone in the Knife Scar mercenary group, Wang Xian’s figure underwent a huge change.

His terrifying figure was 30 meters tall, and his body was emitting a five-colored glow.

He had five terrifying attributes, and his body was exuding endless majesty. He looked extremely powerful.
