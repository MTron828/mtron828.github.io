Chapter 1051: 1052, you think you can still enter? Go

Translator: 5496903

The tickets for the Phoenix immortal auction exploded, and soon, the tickets were fired.

The auction house could hold 5,000 guests. If it were only experts and people of status in East Sea city, it could definitely hold them.

However, in the past two days, the east sea auction had caused a great sensation throughout star-moon kingdom.

Star-moon kingdom had 10 cities and 80 towns.

Just those people in East Ocean City were familiar with, and 30 to 40 families had come to participate in this auction. This did not include those who were not well-known, or those who had come low-key.

One had to know that not only did the city have powerful families, but there were also quite a number of powerful families in some towns.

Even if only one-third of the powerful clans were to come, it would still be quite a large number.

Although Feng Xian had already raised her eligibility for admission to a very high level, it was still difficult to obtain a single ticket.

By four o’clock in the afternoon, all the admission tickets had been distributed.

After that, there were still many people who wanted to enter.

It even reached 5,000 middle-grade spirit stones in exchange for an admission ticket.

5,000 middle-grade spirit stones was equivalent to the price of the corpse of a transcendent fourth rank fierce beast.

One could imagine how popular the auction tonight would be.

“TSK tsk, Feng Xian directly placed the half-step void interpretation demonic beast bloodline in the center of the auction. Aren’t you afraid that someone will come and snatch it away?”

Some of the experts who had come from outside the city looked at the Green Demonic Beast bloodline in the auction house, their eyes filled with greed as they spoke.

“Hehe, go and snatch it? I heard that there are super experts of the Fire Cloud Sparrow race guarding this place. Who Dares to take the spear? Whoever dares to snatch it will be fighting with the fire cloud sparrow race!”

A middle-aged man at the side said somewhat disdainfully.

“Experts of the Fire Cloud Sparrow Race? With the experts of the Fire Cloud Sparrow race guarding this place, even the royal family of star-moon kingdom wouldn’t dare to come and snatch it. After all, that is a top-grade demonic beast race!”

The expression in the eyes of the middle-aged man who spoke was retracted and a solemn expression appeared on his face.

An expert from the fire cloud sparrow race was at least an expert at the profound void tier. Furthermore, it was very likely that he wasn’t an ordinary expert at the profound void tier.

Anyone who dared to come and snatch it would be courting death.

An expert at the profound void tier wouldn’t take such a risk just for the sake of a demonic beast bloodline.

“Are you going to leave after the auction ends?”

At this moment, on the fourth floor of the auction, Wang Xian asked Feng Luan with a frown.

“Yes, I have to go back and settle some matters. I should be back in a month or so. When I come back again, I will have to settle down here!”

Feng Luan nodded and said.

“It’s just right for us to settle down. We can also take care of each other!”

Wang Xian smiled and continued, “Are you going out to eat something?”

“I’m not going. You Go ahead. I’ll take a look at some information!”

Feng Luan shook her head.

“Then I’ll bring you some food later. Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian walked out directly.

The old lady who was standing outside walked in and closed the door gently.

“Empress, are you sure you want to start the operation now? Aren’t you going to wait for a few more years to accumulate enough?”

The old woman walked in and said slowly.

“No, we can take action now. The development of city by city is safer!”

Feng Luan put down the book and said in Deep Thought.

“If the Empress wants to take action, I can’t follow you at all times!”

The old woman said faintly.

“Don’t worry, I will be fine. When I can contend against the Feng dynasty, I will need you to fight for me!”

Feng Luan said slowly.

“I look forward to that day arriving as soon as possible. At that time, our firecloud personal guards will once again shake the transcendence continent!”

The old woman’s face was filled with yearning and determination as she said with a smile.

“I Will!”

Feng Luan stood up with a smile.

The future development would depend on herself. The firecloud Sparrow clan couldn’t let anyone know about it at the moment.

“Let’s see who develops faster!”

Feng Luan smiled when she thought of Wang Xian’s plan to move the Dragon Palace to the transcendence continent.

“HMM?”

Wang Xian, who had just walked out of the auction house, received a message from the communication stone plate. He smiled when he saw that it was from Zhang Fengying.

Zhang Fengying was asking him for admission tickets to the auction.

“Come over. Let me know when you arrive at the auction house!”

Wang Xian informed Zhang Fengying before entering a restaurant not far away.

All the restaurants were full. Wang Xian waited for a full 20 minutes before eating.

...

“Aunty, Where’s Your Friend? The auction is about to start!”

In front of the auction house, a young man stood beside Zhang Fengying and asked her in a low voice.

Beside the young man, two young men and three or four girls were waiting.

“You haven’t come yet, and you still have the cheek to ask me for seven admission tickets. Do you think it’s so easy to get admission tickets?”

Zhang Fengying rolled her eyes at her nephew and said unhappily.

“Little aunt, I didn’t want to, but you said you could get admission tickets!”

The young man looked like he was about to cry. He begged Zhang fengying, “If Aunty can’t get tickets, I’ll be so embarrassed!”

“Embarrassed? Humph, I think you’re trying to pick up a girl!”

Zhang Fengying glanced at a girl at the side and said disdainfully

The girl was very beautiful. She held an exquisite long sword in her hand and looked slim and graceful.

“Hehe!”

The young man touched his head and smiled.

“Alright, I’ll send another message. Wait!”

Zhang Fengying took out her communication stone plate and said impatiently.

This nephew of hers was unreliable, and so was Wang Xian.

“Zhang Yushu, when can we enter?”

At this moment, the girl holding the long sword asked the young man.

“Xiao Mei, wait, right now, right now!”

Zhang Yushu hurriedly said.

“Oh!”

The girl lightly nodded her head and looked at the auction house.

One after another, many people walked into the auction house. They raised their heads and revealed proud expressions.

Being able to participate in the Phoenix Immortal Auction Tonight could be considered as a symbol of status.

A few of the students from the Ocean Academy wanted to go in and take a look.

“Eh? Xiao Mei, you’re here too?”

At this moment, a youth’s voice came from the side.

The youth was dressed in aqua blue, and there were four to five youths beside him.

“En!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The girl nodded at him.

“Zhang Yushu, you guys are here too!”

The young man in aqua blue suddenly looked at Zhang Yushu and raised his eyebrows.

“Why? Am I not allowed to come?”

Zhang Yushu said with an embarrassed expression.

“Why are you not allowed to come? But, why aren’t you guys going in?”

The young man in aqua blue smiled.

“We will go in later!”

Several young men beside Zhang Yushu also said with a bad expression.
