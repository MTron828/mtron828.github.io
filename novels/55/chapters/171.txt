“Scram!”

When Young Master Liu heard Wang Xian, his face stiffened instantly.

He stared coldly at Wang Xian and revealed a hideous look. “Great. Great! You are the first person who dares to speak to me in such a manner!”

Wang Xian looked him in the eyes before walking in impatiently.

Young Master Liu stared coldly at Wang Xian as murderous intent flashed in his eyes.

“Miracle Doctor Wang, that is Little Sword Celestial, Liu Feiyun, from the Tyrannical Sword Family, a First-class family. He already possessed the strength of a Level 7 Martial Artist at the age of 27 and specialized in swordsmanship. He once defeated three Martial Artists of the same level with his swordsmanship and has since been known as the Little Sword Celestial. His talents are tremendous!”

Seeing that Wang Xian had made Liu Feiyun his enemy, Elder Fang frowned and reminded him.

Hmm.

Wang Xian nodded his head. However, he was focused on the figure in red dress ahead of him and wasn’t paying attention to Elder Fang’s reminder.

Seeing how he reacted, Elder Fang shook her head slightly.

The decorations within the Nine Stars Auction House were extremely grandiose. When one entered, he would see a huge hall. Tables and chairs were already set up within.

At the very front, there was an elevated platform of approximately a meter tall. There was a huge screen on the elevated platform that would be used for the auction.

The auction house could be divided into two floors. The lower floor was for the public and there was an additional floor above it.

For the second floor, they were mainly suites. There were quite a number of suites which totaled twenty to thirty.

These suites weren’t VIP suites or for those with strength. Instead, it was just a very ordinary suite. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

One could not see the clients that had walked into a suite from the outside.

These were private spaces that Nine Stars Auction House had prepared for their clients.

Some clients might not want to let others know that they had obtained some precious items from the auction. Therefore, they would prefer to enter into a suite.

As one of the top auctions houses in the country, Nine Stars Auction House would also ensure a hundred percent confidentiality with regards to the buyers’ and sellers’ information.

“Let’s get into a suite!”

Elder Fang took a glance at Liu Feiyun, hesitated for a moment, and led Xiao Yu and Wang Xian to a suite on the second floor.

One could still clearly see what was happening on the ground floor from within the suite

More and more people entered the Nine Stars Auction House. This auction was clearly highly successful, with approximately two hundred people attending.

These people were largely from the Southern Province and the two other provinces neighboring it.

There were entrepreneurs, directors of large organizations and strong experts from Ancient Martial Arts Families and Sects.

The ratio of wealthy men to martial artists was roughly 1:1.

From the second floor, Wang Xian could see Liu Feiyun and Lan Qingyue sitting around a table near the elevated platform.

Liu Feiyun was explaining to Lan Qingyue enthusiastically.

Wang Xian looked away and started observing the people of the auction.

“Liu Family of the Tyrannical Sword from Hailing Province, Ancient Fist Sect, Lingyue Sect from the Dongqing Province and Demon Subduing Sect. I had not expected the First-class Forces from the two neighboring provinces to all be here.”

Elder Fang looked down and spoke solemnly.

The Liu Family members who practiced Tyrannical Sword, Ancient Fist Sect, Lingyue Sect from the Dongqing Province and Demon Subduing Sect were all First-class forces.

Speaking of which, the Southern Province was relatively weaker and didn’t have any First-class Forces.

“Welcome, everyone, to our Nine Stars Auction House!”

At 10 am sharp, an old man walked up to the stage and spoke to the guests.

The old man was loud and didn’t require another sound amplification system. He was able to project his voice clearly to everyone’s ears.

“This is Sound Transmission Art. This old man is at least a Level 8 Martial Artist!” Elder Fang explained to Xiao Yu.

“Martial Artist Level 8! Incredible.” Xiao Yu revealed a shocked expression.

“Nine Stars Auction House can be considered to be in the top-tier even amongst the First-class Forces. They have five to six Inborn experts and their disciples are extremely strong. An ordinary First-class Force couldn’t be compared with it!”

Elder Fang continued her explanation.

Xiao Yu nodded her head and looked down curiously.

“We have a total of forty items on auction today. Without further ado, we will be starting the auction for the first item, a real calligraphy piece of Li Bai.” [1]

“Li Bai was known by many as the Sword Celestial and had integrated his swordsmanship into his calligraphy. If anyone could decipher his swordsmanship from his calligraphy, he would definitely be able to obtain the inheritance of the Sword Celestial and become invincible,” the old man remarked. Two beautiful and employees in skimpy outfits carried a calligraphy piece onto the auction stage.

The handwriting was wild but had sharp vibes to it. Any Ancient Martial Artists would be able to tell that this piece of calligraphy wasn’t ordinary.

However, it was extremely hard to decipher anything from it.

“The starting price will be $20 million. The auction begins!”

“Ding! $25 million!”

Just as the old man completed his sentence, the screen on the stage showed that there was someone who had upped the bid.

For this auction, one wouldn’t have to raise a card. Everyone had a button in front of them. One would just need to enter the bidding price and press the button to submit one’s bid.

“$25 million from that Mister at Table 8. Is there anyone who would like to make a bid?”

The old man revealed a price after seeing the bid price.

The crowd immediately turned their attention to Table 8.

“This calligraphy piece, I’ll definitely be getting it!”

Around Table 8, Liu Feiyun lifted his head proudly and made his intention clear to all.

“He’s the little Sword Celestial of the Tyrannical Sword!”

“It’s the Liu Family! Let’s just forget about it!”

“We naturally wouldn’t compete with the Little Sword Celestial for the swordsmanship!”

“Since Young Master Liu is so determined, we naturally wouldn’t compete with you for something you are fond of!”

The crowd looked at Liu Feiyun. Some of them greeted him while some exchanged customary words. [1]

Within the auction house, the Liu Family would rank in the top four in terms of strength. Unless it was necessary, no one would like to compete with the Liu Family.

“Haha, thank you, everyone!”

Liu Feiyun revealed an excited look. He laughed loudly and greeted the crowd before turning his attention to Lan Qingyue who was beside him.

“Qingyue, if there’re any jewelry related items in a while, I can win the bid for you. With the name of our Liu Family, others would still show us respect.”

Liu Feiyun looked at Lan Qingyue proudly.

“Thank you, Mr. Liu. However, The Zhou Jewelry has Lingyue Sect as their support. Would I be troubling Young Master Liu?”

Lan Qingyue shook his head gradually and looked to a table just a short distance away.

“Lingyue Sect?” Liu Feiyun squinted his eyes and replied confidently, “Qingyue, our Liu Family isn’t afraid of the Lingyue Sect. Let me help you. If our enemy is only Lingyue Sect, there’s nothing to be afraid of!”

At this moment, the old man on the stage shouted suddenly, “A $35 million bid from Suite 13! Is there anyone who would like to increase the bid!”

Liu Feiyun was taken aback. The smile on his face stiffened. He immediately lifted his head and looked towards the big screen.

On it, Suite 13 had just made a bid for Li Bai’s calligraphy work at $35 million.

The crowd was slightly shocked too as they looked at the enraged Liu Feiyun.

“$40 million!”

Liu Feiyun’s face sank. He lifted his head and looked to the location of the suite as he sneered.

“$45 million!”

At this moment, Suite 13 increased the bid by another $5 million.

The gloominess on Liu Feiyun’s face was heavy.

Just a while ago, he still claimed confidently that everyone would show his Liu Family respect. Just as he finished his sentence, someone stood out and competed with him.

The action was similar to slapping him in the face.

[2] Greetings here aren’t referring to waving to someone or a similar action. The action is similar to clasping the right fist with the left hand
