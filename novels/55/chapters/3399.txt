3400 3399 in one move, shocking the entire arena

“Hu hu!”

The Thunder Ray race disciples’breathing was a little hurried. They clenched their fists and stared at the people in front of them with an abnormally ugly expression.

In the center, Third Senior Brother and fourth senior sister were holding their chests and spitting out blood. Lei Yuntian’s expression was also very ugly.

They did not expect that Lei Yuntian had already broken through! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

They also didn’t expect that senior brother Lei Yuntian would be defeated so easily.

Senior Brother Lei Yuntian’s great defeat made their entire lightning race very embarrassed.

“Hahaha, arrogant, continue to be arrogant? I thought your lightning race’s current generation was very powerful. Hehe, it’s really getting worse with each generation. It Won’t be long before your lightning race will be exterminated by us!”

In front of them, a middle-aged disciple from the great thunderclap academy laughed mockingly. His face was filled with disdain.

“Lei Yuntian, you really can’t do it. If I meet you in the wild, I will definitely kill you!”

Just as the middle-aged man finished speaking, in the middle of the Great Thunderclap Academy, a great Thunderclap Academy senior brother holding a lightning staff said with disdain.

He held a three-meter-tall lightning staff in his hand and wore a lightning windbreaker on his body. His face was handsome, and the nine spots on his head were shining.

He looked mighty and extraordinary.

However, his words caused Lei Yuntian to tremble violently, and his face was filled with unwillingness.

“Don’t be too arrogant in your great Thunderclap Academy!”

Fourth Senior Sister Glared at them and berated them angrily.

“Saying this will only show that your thunderclap race is useless. Hehe, in the future, when your thunderclap race disciples see our great Thunderclap Academy disciples, if you know what’s good for you, immediately scram. Otherwise, we will still step on your faces.”

The Great Thunderclap Academy’s eldest senior brother said mockingly.

“Damn it!”

“Fadu this fellow is too arrogant. He was nurtured by the Great Thunderclap Academy with a large number of treasures. What’s there to be arrogant about?”

The group of thunder ray disciples growled in a low voice, unwilling to give up.

Whoosh

At this moment, Wang Xian, who had already arrived, flew over. He took a look at Lei Yuntian and asked.

“Eldest senior brother, I’m… Fine!”

Lei Yuntian shook his head when he saw Wang Xian appearing. His face was a little pale.

“Eldest senior brother!”

“Eldest senior brother!”

When the disciples of the Lightning race saw Wang Xian appearing, they greeted him one by one.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly.

“Yes?”

At the opposite location, the disciples of the Great Thunderclap Academy raised their eyebrows slightly when they saw Wang Xian suddenly appearing and heard how the disciples of the Lightning race addressed him.

Their gazes landed on Wang Xian.

“Eh? is that the eldest senior brother of the Lightning Race?”

“The eldest senior brother of the Thunder Ray Tribe has appeared? I heard that this eldest senior brother of theirs is very young and is a purebred divine dragon. It is rumored that he is from the ancestral dragon lineage. I wonder if that is true!”

At this moment, there were more than ten million people who were watching from the surroundings. They were all the strong disciples of the Jiuye Fire tribe and the sky-connecting tribe.

When they saw Wang Xian’s sudden appearance, all of them were discussing in hushed voices.

They had also heard some information about the eldest senior brother of the Thunder Ray tribe.

“The eldest senior brother of the Thunder Ray tribe is here. is he going to compete with the eldest senior brother of the Great Thunderclap Academy?”

“It’s very possible. After all, the Thunder Ray Tribe has lost a lot of face just now. It will be interesting to see the eldest senior brother of the two major forces spar.”

“But I heard that the eldest senior brother of the Thunder Ray tribe only has the combat strength of a universe knight at level seven?”

Some people continued to speculate as their eyes flickered.

The eldest senior brother of the Great Thunderclap Academy narrowed his eyes and stared at Wang Xian with a smile.

Both of them were enemies. Those who knew their opponents the best were usually their opponents.

The Great Thunderclap Academy was very familiar with the Thunder Ray race. He was also very familiar with the matters of the eldest senior brother of the Thunder Ray race.

He knew clearly that when Lei Yuntian was competing with the current eldest senior brother of the Thunder Ray race, Lei Yuntian had yet to break through.

And this senior brother of the Thunder race was at the level of a level seven universe knight at that time.

Now, his combat strength might still be at the level seven universe knight level, and he might not be as strong as Lei Yuntian.

He didn’t put this senior brother of the Thunder race in his eyes at all.

What ancestral dragon? What pure-bred Godly Dragon? If his combat strength wasn’t good enough, it wasn’t good enough!

“Hehe, the eldest senior brother of the Lightning race is here. Do you want to take revenge? I, FA du, will accompany you to the end!”

“If you don’t dare, then quickly tuck your tail between your legs and scram far away. In the future, when you see a disciple of the great thunderclap academy, be more obedient. Tuck your tail between your legs and don’t bark!”

As the eldest senior brother of the Great Thunderclap Academy spoke, the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

“Haha, Eldest Senior Brother, just this eldest senior brother of the lightning race dares to spar with you, eldest senior brother. You can crush him with one hand!”

“Haha, that’s right. Such trash, eldest senior brother, you can kill him in one move!”

A few middle-aged disciples beside FA du laughed and mocked him.

Their voices were abnormally ear-piercing, causing the disciples of the Thunder Ray race to be filled with anger.

At this moment, they were feeling extremely aggrieved.

They did not have much confidence in eldest senior brother challenging FA du.

Even if senior brother Lei Yuntian had broken through, he was still not his opponent.

Although Wang Xian had hunted many desolate beasts, he had just broken through not long ago. No matter how strong he was, he would be the same as Lei Yuntian.

He might still lose if he were to compete with his opponent.

When Wang Xian heard the words of the Great Thunderclap Academy’s disciples, he narrowed his eyes slightly and turned his body around. He looked at them.

“Do you want to Spar with me?”

When the Great Thunderclap Academy’s eldest senior brother saw Wang Xian looking over, he raised his head slightly in a provocative manner and said with a smile.

He really hoped that the other party would make a move. If that was the case, he would be able to humiliate the Lightning race once again.

After all, the eldest senior brother of the Lightning race was this young man in front of him.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian heard his words and said calmly.

“Eldest senior brother, he is very strong!”

When Lei Yuntian heard Wang Xian’s reply, his expression changed slightly as he hurriedly reminded him.

“Eldest senior brother, don’t be Rash!”

The group of Thunder Ray Disciples’expressions changed slightly as well. They shouted softly with a hint of worry and reminder.

“Hahaha, Alright, Alright. Then let me see the strength of eldest senior brother of the Thunder Ray race. I wonder if he can withstand two moves from me!”

When FA du heard Wang Xian’s words, he laughed out loud. The aura on his body trembled slightly. He opened his mouth and revealed a cold expression in his eyes.

He wanted to humiliate the other party properly.

“HMM? The eldest senior brother of the Thunder Ray race is going against the eldest senior brother of the Great Thunderclap Academy. This is going to be interesting.”

“I wonder who will win this time. This is a matter of face!”

The strong disciples from the surrounding factions revealed an excited expression as they stared at him intently.

Whoosh

“I’m going to make my move!”

At this moment, Wang Xian started to move. As he spoke coldly, his speed suddenly increased.

At the same time, waves of grayish energy surrounded his entire body. The uninitiated holy wings also appeared behind him.

“HMPH, I will make you kneel down and beg for mercy later!”

Fa du snorted softly as he raised his lightning staff slowly.

Crack! Crack

However, at this moment, Wang Xian’s figure disappeared instantly.

Bang

The next moment, his foot landed heavily on the face of the eldest senior brother of the Great Thunderclap Academy, Fado.
