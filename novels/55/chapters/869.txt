Translator: 549690339

Boom

Two terrifying forces collided. The 20-meter-long heavenly blade was almost the same size as Wang Xian’s body.

When the powerful forces collided, Wang Xian couldn’t help but retreat backward.

A long wound appeared on the Dragon Claw, and fresh blood oozed out.

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly. He took a deep breath. He was at transcendent level four. After all, he was at transcendent level four. When the middle-aged man unleashed his full strength, it would be very difficult for him to deal with him.

“Haha, you are the one who forced me to do this. Today, I Will Chop Off Your Dragon Head!”

When the middle-aged man saw Wang Xian taking a step back, wounds appeared on his dragon claws. A ferocious expression appeared on his face. He let out a loud roar and leaped forward. The long saber in his hand slashed towards Wang Xian with the force that could split a mountain.

The Heaven Saber that was connected to him also rushed into the sky and slashed towards Wang Xian.

The 20-meter long heavenly blade slashed down heavily.

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly. At the position of his body, the earth-yellow energy circulated and layers of powerful defenses appeared in the sky above him.

At the same time, Wang Xian opened his mouth and spat out three Dragon Balls.

The Dragon Balls attacked the middle-aged man directly.

Boom

The Heavenly Blade landed on the Earth Shield on Wang Xian’s body. The earth shield cracked and soil splashed in all directions.

The power of the long blade was greatly reduced. However, it still landed on Wang Xian’s body.

Boom

Wang Xian’s body fell rapidly towards the bottom of the sea. He could not help but spit out large mouthfuls of dragon blood.

“What?”

When the surrounding people saw this scene, they were shocked.

“The Dragon King is going to lose?”

“The middle-aged man is showing his power. The Dragon King may be in danger!”

At this moment, the faces of the people below changed drastically. The battle between the Dragon King and them just now had made the immortal gods and disciples of the immortal sects stand up.

Now that they saw that the Dragon King was actually suppressed and might even be killed, the people were panicking. Should they kneel down again?

The Immortal Gods, the lofty immortal sects, at this moment, were like ants that could be easily destroyed by others.

This made all of them extremely embarrassed. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The battle had reached its peak. Looking at their battle, all of the immortal gods felt extremely insignificant.

“That Heaven Saber is too terrifying. Maybe Wang Xian is not their match. The Dragon King is going to be finished!”

When everyone saw the Dragon King spitting out blood and falling into the sea, their expressions changed slightly.

Boom

“Haha, Good, good. This is so satisfying. It’s been a long time since anyone could hurt me!”

At this moment, a huge wave was stirred up on the surface of the sea. Wang Xian flew out from the bottom of the sea. His eyes were filled with fighting spirit.

“Damn you. Today, I will definitely kill you!”

When the middle-aged man saw Wang Xian flying out from the bottom of the sea, his expression changed slightly. His face turned slightly pale.

The continuous control of the Heaven Saber had exhausted him greatly.

“Haha, this is the last move. If you can take it, I admit defeat!”

Wang Xian laughed out loud. He wagged his tail and circled directly in the sky.

“Humph!”

The middle-aged man’s expression did not change. The long blade in his hand sent the three dragon balls in front of him flying. He controlled the heavenly blade and slashed at Wang Xian.

Every slash carried a hundred-meter sharp edge.

Every slash looked extremely heavy.

“The tree world has descended!”

Wang Xian’s body was emitting a green glow. The glow was like a seed as it slowly spread across a radius of 10 kilometers.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom

In an instant, the entire world seemed to have undergone a huge change.

The tree world had descended. The entire sky was directly covered by trees that were 100 meters tall.

Every tree was 100 meters tall and seven to eight meters thick.

They had long branches.

Wang Xian’s body trembled and transformed into the body of the Azure Dragon.

“HMPH!”

The middle-aged man saw another supernatural ability and his eyebrows twitched violently. However, he snorted coldly.

He realized that although the Dragon King had many supernatural abilities, none of them were as powerful as he had imagined.

The supernatural ability that he had comprehended at extraordinary fourth level could completely destroy it.

“Heavenly Blade Raging Slash!”

With a loud roar, the long saber in his hand split into more than a dozen. The heavenly blade split into more than a dozen at the same time and slashed forward.

Boom! Boom! Boom

In an instant, the newly formed tree world within a radius of a thousand meters was directly chopped into pieces of wood!

“Hmph, what an empty facade!”

A hint of coldness flashed across the middle-aged man’s eyes as he slashed the long saber in his hand once again.

“It hasn’t started yet!”

Wang Xian laid on top of a bunch of trees. A hint of coldness flashed across his eyes. “Spirit Enchantment!”

Spirit Enchantment!

It was an ability of the ancestral tree.

It allowed the trees to possess spirituality!

When Wang Xian released this supernatural ability, the entire tree world seemed to have come to life.

It was as if an ancient creature had come to life. In an instant, all the trees were exuding a terrifying life force.

Wang Xian’s body shook. A large amount of green dragon energy filled a radius of ten kilometers.

In an instant, all the trees seemed to have taken drugs.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Wang Xian had an idea. Countless trees attacked the sky blade and the middle-aged man.

“Petty tricks!”

A cold glint flashed in the middle-aged man’s eyes. He raised the long blade in his hand and let out a dazzling light. The Sky Blade also let out a dazzling light.

“Slash!”

Slash!

The Sky Blade’s might covered a thousand meters as it slashed towards the densely packed trees below.

However, when the sky blade slashed over, the countless trees seemed to have eyes as they directly dodged the Sky Blade’s attack.

Moreover, the densely packed tree branches wrapped around the sky blade.

“What? How is this possible? Why are these trees so alive?”

The middle-aged man widened his eyes. Supernatural powers, any kind of supernatural powers, and the attacks unleashed would be under the control of the owner.

However, these trees seemed to be alive as they attacked him crazily.

Moreover, they could even dodge attacks.

How was this possible!

“Because I have the ancestral tree, this should be my strongest move. The descent of the tree world with an additional spirit!”

A hint of a smile appeared in Wang Xian’s eyes. He moved his body and in an instant, all the trees within a radius of ten kilometers started to move along with him.

The overwhelming number of tree branches headed towards the middle-aged man.

The middle-aged man’s eyes were filled with shock as he waved the long saber in his hand.

However, he realized that the Heaven Saber in the sky was tightly entangled by countless branches. No matter how much strength he used, the Heaven Saber did not move at all.

This made him extremely embarrassed. A hint of fear could be seen in his eyes.

“No!”

He looked ahead. The 20-meter-long Green Dragon was attacking him with countless branches. His face revealed an extremely terrified expression as he shouted loudly.

“Die!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were ice-cold. The scales on his body trembled slightly as sharp wooden thorns appeared one after another and attacked the middle-aged man.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

With the power of the entire tree world descending, Wang Xian and all the trees penetrated through the middle-aged man directly.

“Ah!”

A miserable shriek rang out and reverberated throughout the surrounding waters.

The middle-aged man was injured.

When this sound rang out, everyone in the surroundings trembled. The battle in the surroundings also stopped.

Suppression!
