Chapter 1587: 1587 buried millions of corpses and bled thousands of miles

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

In the ruins of the divine kingdom, the silence did not last long when the rumbling sound was heard again.

“Has it started?”

“It seems that the sky demon is going to exterminate the Bingxin dynasty this time, and it will be a bloody extermination!”

“Won’t the sky demon exterminate everyone in the Bingxin dynasty? That’s tens of billions of people!”

“It’s impossible to exterminate everyone. It’s highly possible to exterminate the royal family’s ice clan. The Sky Demon said that just now!”

“Who asked the Iceheart dynasty to be ungrateful? They deserve to be kicked into the Abyss!”

Hearing the roars and screams from the Iceheart dynasty, everyone felt their hearts tremble.

The hunchbacked old man was also a ruthless person.

“Kekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekeke. Are we going to destroy the country?”

In less than five minutes, a terrifying black shadow flew over directly. In front of him, a blood-red ball of blood was pulsating in front of him.

The blood ball was extremely strange and evil.

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the surroundings. His body moved and immediately returned to his size of about 150 meters. His gaze was fixed on the stooped old man.

“Hehe! Boss MO, this is a good item in my hands. This is the bloodline of the ice clan of the Bingxin Empire!”

“Since boss Mo wants to exterminate your entire clan, I will naturally help you to prepare properly. With this bloodline demon group, I can sense everyone in the Bingxin Empire. When the time comes, I will kill them directly. Hehe!”

“How about it, boss Mo? Isn’t this one very powerful?”

The stooped old man’s eyes lit up as he said to Wang Xian in a fawning manner.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian gave a cold glance. His body moved and he flew directly in the direction of the Bingxin Empire.

“Alright, Boss Demon!”

The stooped old man grinned and flew in the sky, following closely behind Wang Xian.

“In this world, anyone who dares to provoke me, Boss Demon, will die!”

“I don’t care if you are from the solipsistic sect or the Bingxin Empire. hehehe!”

The hunchbacked elder let out a maniacal laugh that spread throughout the entire ruins of the divine kingdom. Two terrifying demonic shadows flew rapidly towards the Bingxin Empire.

“The sky demon is not simple. That elder is not simple either!”

At the position of the Wuji Empire, Patriarch Dark Eye and all the experts of the Wuji Empire were standing at a spot more than ten kilometers away.

Looking at the figures of Wang Xian and the stooped old man, Patriarch Dark Eye said with a slightly solemn tone.

“Oh? Patriarch? Even you think that the sky demon and the old man are stronger?”

Wu Qingcheng, who was standing at the side, asked in shock when he heard Patriarch Dark Eye’s words.

Wang Xian had caused too much trouble this time. He had killed all the experts and core disciples of the Solitaire sect. This matter was no longer something that he could lend a hand to.

“Every single one of them has a terrifying energy hidden in their bodies!”

Dark pupil frowned and his eyes were filled with solemnity. “They might even be able to escape under my hands!”

“Hiss!”

When everyone in the Wuji Empire heard their forefather’s evaluation, they all took a deep breath.

This was the forefather of their empire who was nearly invincible in the vast region.

He actually had such a high evaluation of the Sky Demon and the hunchbacked old man.

“That Wang Xian is really mysterious. He cultivates both light and darkness. I really don’t understand!”

Wu Qing Cheng looked at the sky with a complicated expression.

“This sky demon killed many disciples of the Solitaire sect and destroyed the base of the Solitaire sect. The solitaire sect should be furious!”

“This sky demon is really unbridled. Now he’s going to destroy the Iceheart Empire. What’s going to happen next is interesting!”

The experts of the southern royal family were also discussing at the side.

The vast region was about to become lively.

The Saint of Light, Priest King, was a Sky Demon.

The Iceheart dynasty had ungratefully betrothed Bing Jian ‘er to young lord ao ‘Tian.

The news of Priest King vowing to destroy the Iceheart dynasty quickly spread throughout the ruins of the divine kingdom.

When everyone heard the news, their faces were filled with shock and disbelief.

First of all, the fact that the sage of light was a sky demon made many people feel incredulous.

However, many people still supported priest Wang in this sudden battle.

Firstly, priest Wang had saved many people, and secondly, the people that the sky demon had killed were all extremely vicious.

On the contrary, it was the ingratitude of the iceheart empire that made everyone despise them!

“Boss Demon, the location in front is a city of the Bingxin Empire!”

Wang Xian and the hunchbacked old man were extremely fast. In just a few minutes, they had already flown a few thousand kilometers.

The bingxin empire was not very far from the ruins of the divine kingdom. Very soon, a city appeared in their line of sight.

“Kill!”

Wang Xian did not hesitate at all. His tyrannical eyes flew towards the city in front of him.

His body was filled with brutality.

If he overused the dark energy, the brutal dark energy would fill his mind.

“Keke, it’s boss Mo. . Anyone with the bloodline of the Bingxin Empire, kill them all!”

The hunchbacked old man let out a weird cry. The Shadows of the two of them instantly appeared above the city.

The city covered an area of 100 kilometers. The population below had reached tens of millions.

“All citizens of the Bingxin dynasty, Listen Up! The royal family of the Bingxin dynasty has offended our Lord skyfiend. All of you, kneel on the ground immediately!”

The hunchbacked elder floated in the sky as a ghastly and terrifying voice charged downwards.

“Crack! Crack! Crack!”

The instantly activated city protection array was instantly blasted apart by a powerful force.

A terrifying pressure covered the area below.

“What?”

“My Sky? Sky Demon? It’s that demon Sky Demon!”

In the city, everyone raised their heads and looked at the two terrifying demon shadows in the sky. Their faces were filled with fear.

Even some insightful void martial artists were filled with shock.

“After today, there will be no more Ice Heart Empire!”

Wang Xian’s cold dragon eyes stared downwards. A surge of demonic dragon’s might was directed downwards.

“PFFT!”

Everyone in the city had a drastic change in expression as they spat out blood.

“You Bunch of Damned Bingxin Empire Bastards, hurry up and kneel down!”

The hunchbacked old man roared at the people below.

“Yes, yes!”

“Kneel down, hurry up and kneel down!”

“My... My God...”

Everyone hurriedly knelt on the ground, their eyes filled with terror.

“All those who have the bloodline of the royal family of the Bingxin Dynasty will die. Keke!”

“Extermination, I love it the most!”

When everyone was kneeling on the ground, the hunchbacked old man waved his arm.

The blood ball in front of him directly attacked the figures below.

Those who possessed the royal bloodline were mostly the upper echelons of the city. Faced with the strange methods of the hunchbacked old man, the people from the royal family of Bingxin revealed terrified expressions.

“Ahhhh!”

Continuous sounds rang out. At least a thousand people in the entire city were all dead. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Boom!”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept past them. He didn’t pay any attention to them and continued to fly towards the direction of the Bingxin Empire.

Don’t blame him for being ruthless!

He treated the Bingxin Empire very well. In fact, he even owed them a favor. However, they repaid his kindness with enmity and wanted to kill him.

In that case, he should start paying the price with blood!

A million corpses will be buried, and blood will flow for thousands of miles. Begin!
