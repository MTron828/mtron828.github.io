Chapter 3837 3836 doubts about the belief universe

“Some of the believers in this belief universe are really pitiful!”

Wang Xian mumbled!

Using the power of the believers to create a powerful treasure.

This method was a little cruel!

However, this was also the law of the Jungle!

Wang Xian could also lament about this matter. After all, the universe was very big and there were all kinds of things.

In the universe, being weak was the original sin!

After checking the fifteen books of faith, Wang Xian tried to control them but to no avail.

Such books of faith could only be used by the gods that the souls in the books believed in!

It was very difficult for the other living beings and the other gods to use them.

Of course, the powerful gods of faith could change their goals of faith and control them!

However, Wang Xian didn’t have this ability, so he could only destroy it!

After destroying the belief book, it would turn into the purest power of belief. This power of belief had the same effect as the heart of belief. It could allow the disciples of the Dragon Palace to achieve a rapid breakthrough!

After the belief book couldn’t be used, it would be difficult for Wang Xian to condense all the power of the soul here!

It would be impossible for him to gather all the soul power if the four ghouls broke up!

The excess soul power would fill the surroundings, causing the virtual spirit treasure to expand continuously!

However, Wang Xian did not mind it!

He took out his communication disk and sent a message to an lie!

After an lie received the message, he arrived very quickly. Wang Xian asked him to bring back the group of Gods of Faith and the Book of faith that he had killed!

Currently, more than 10 million years had passed!𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

In the Dragon Palace, the number of powerhouses above the overlord level had already reached about 15,000.

This was an extremely huge number!

Moreover, this number was still increasing rapidly.

The fiery heart treasured land and the baptism dragon pool!

In addition, the combat strength of the middle-level of the Dragon Palace had increased a lot this time.

According to the news from Lan Qingyue, the weakest of the 1,000 charm dragon species had reached the ruler level 5!

The leader of the Charm Dragon had reached the ruler level 6!

This was a huge increase!

The ruler Level 6 was considered very strong in the starry universe!

After all, the experts that entered the starry universe were at most at the ruler Level 7.

The growth rate of the charming dragon species was absolutely terrifying!

If this were to be revealed, the other peak species would definitely be shocked beyond words!

In addition, the Dragon Ao crab of the devouring dragon was also improving at a terrifying speed.

As for how much it had improved to, Wang Xian had no idea!

“Let’s take control of this soul battleship first!”

Wang Xian decided to stay here and had the idea of occupying it.

Furthermore, if this place was occupied by the belief universe, once they occupied it for a few hundred million years, wouldn’t they be able to create dozens of belief warlords with the strength of a level nine pantheon?

When that time came, Wang Xian might be killed!

Therefore, this place could not be occupied by the belief universe.

Even if he were to leave this place in the future, he was prepared to come over and take a look from time to time. Once the gods of belief came over, he would destroy them!

As he pondered in his heart, he sat cross-legged in the soul battleship and began to nurture them!

…

At the same time, after Wang Xian had destroyed more than 10,000 gods from the decree palace and the other palaces, the decree palace and the others immediately received the news at the location of the belief universe passageway!

When they sensed that more than 10,000 gods had been killed, their expressions instantly turned ugly!

“Something has happened at the Void Spirit treasured land. Elder of the Decree Palace, what exactly is going on?”

Not far away, a palace’s gods had also sensed the death of their own gods. Their expressions changed slightly as they asked the experts from the Decree Palace!

“We also just received the news. Let Me Ask!”

An elder from the decree palace had a grim expression. He took out his communication device and immediately began to ask!

“They suffered a terrifying attack and didn’t discover who the enemy was. More than ten thousand gods were instantly enveloped by a great terror and were all killed.”

Soon, the elder from the Decree Palace opened his mouth to speak, and a grave expression appeared on his face.

“Oh?”

In the Heavenly Palace, the elder in the center frowned slightly when he heard this. “Your decree palace has also suffered a terrifying attack? You didn’t sense the other party’s existence? All of them were annihilated?”

“Yes, there are seven to eight thousand gods from our decree palace in the Void Spirit Treasured Land!”

The elder from the decree palace trembled as he spoke with bloodshot eyes!

“A powerful enemy is targeting us? Our Heavenly Palace didn’t even see any enemies before they were all annihilated. This isn’t normal!”

The Heavenly Palace Elder spoke, his expression constantly changing!

If it was only their heavenly palace that had such a problem, then it was probably because they had encountered a special space beast.

But now, the law order palace had also encountered such a situation?

Was it a coincidence?

Wasn’t it too much of a coincidence?

He had a faint feeling that there was definitely a powerful and terrifying manipulator among them.

“Our Decree Palace’s Faith War God has just been completed, and the other party has attacked. The other party knows very well about our decree palace!”

As the Decree Palace Elder spoke, his expression was abnormally ugly, and at the same time, he was also a little suspicious!

The worshippers of the Decree Palace were about to complete their construction of the war god, but in the end, they were met with a disaster!

Why was this so?

Was there a powerful enemy in the dark?

Was it a terrifying existence from the 9-origin universe?

Or was it?

Was it done by the worshippers of the other palaces in the universe?

This wasn’t impossible.

The worshippers of the 24 palaces in the universe weren’t very harmonious. They often had some wars of faith.

In order to fight for believers, there had also been wars!

There were even a few temples among them that were like mortal enemies.

Now, because of the opening of the space passage, they had shifted the internal war!

But he didn’t dare to be sure that there were some internal fellows who wanted to deal with their decree palace!

“It shouldn’t be done by our belief universe. We understand each other. It’s not so easy to destroy more than 10,000 gods in an instant. Moreover, according to the resurrected gods, the energy that attacked them isn’t the power of belief, but an extremely strange energy. This energy doesn’t seem like the nine attributes of the nine-origin universe.”

An elder next to the Decree Palace said!

“Yes, there is another possibility, and that is that some space beasts in the nine-origin universe did it. Everyone should have received news that the passage in the nine-origin universe was opened by Space Beasts living in the nine-origin universe. These space beasts have supreme God realm existences, and they have intelligence. They might have reached some agreements with the nine-origin universe or made some deals.”

Elder Gong nodded his head and made another guess!

The possibility of this guess was also very high!
