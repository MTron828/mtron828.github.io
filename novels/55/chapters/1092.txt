Chapter 1093: 1094 strange demons appeared

Translator: 5496903

“Boom!”

A violent collision sound rang out at the east gate of the transcendence continent. The sound of an explosion reverberated throughout the entire sky.

Thirty-two blood savage demonic beasts charged at Wang Xian. The powerful black fog collided with the flames.

“Charge!”

Wang Xian’s body trembled. The tens of thousands of wandering sea demons that were under his control charged at the blood savage demonic beasts without any fear of death.

“Beasts, you are courting death!”

When the 32 blood barbaric demon beasts saw the ferocious beasts that were under their control attacking them, they revealed a furious expression.

Their bodies shook as they attacked the wandering sea monsters with their blood demon claws.

Among the 32 blood barbaric demon beasts, the weakest one had the strength of a level eight extraordinary. Under their combined attacks, the terrifying power tore apart the bodies of the wandering sea monsters in an instant.

In an instant, fresh blood dyed the ground red. The blood on the ground had already started to thicken, and the ground was already covered with the corpses of the beasts.

“Hiss, what a Terrifying Blood Savage Demonic Beast!”

“Can Lord Wang withstand it?”

Everyone looked shocked when they saw the thirty-two blood savage demonic beasts killing tens of thousands of wandering sea monsters in an instant.

It was too brutal and terrifying!

“We have to share some of the burden with Lord Wang. Otherwise, we will be finished once he is in danger!”

Jin Qianyuan, who was standing on the city wall, said in a deep voice.

“Roar!”

However, at this moment, the blood demon beasts who had been standing at the back and did not make a move suddenly roared.

The 50,000 to 60,000 wandering sea demons who were not under Wang Xian’s control suddenly circled around five kilometers away from Wang Xian and attacked the holy sea town.

“Be careful. The ferocious beasts are circling around us. Get ready for battle. Sir Wang Xian has already blocked most of the attacks for us. If we can’t hold on any longer, we will be useless!”

The President of the hiring association roared loudly with battle intent in his eyes.

“Yes, Fight! We must not lose!”

Everyone roared with battle intent. At this moment, everyone unleashed 200% of their strength.

“At this distance, coupled with the fact that the group of Blood Savage Demonic Beasts are all of the darkness attribute, even the people on the city wall wouldn’t be able to see them when the strange demon attacked!”

Wang Xian looked ahead. 32 blood savage demonic beasts were slaughtering the wandering sea demons at a rapid speed.

These group of ferocious beasts below level seven could kill hundreds or even thousands of them with a single strike.

Especially for the four half-step void interpretation existences, they were even more ferocious.

Unless there were eight or nine half-step void interpretation humans or void interpretation masters, it would be extremely difficult to kill the four half-step void interpretation demonic beasts.

Wang Xian hovered in the sky and did not make a move. He waited quietly.

“Since you dare to interfere in the affairs of our blood barbarian demonic beasts, I shall use your blood as a sacrifice today. hahaha!”

One by one, the blood barbarian demonic beasts slaughtered the wandering sea demons under Wang Xian’s control. They were closing in on him at a terrifying speed!

Wang Xian smiled faintly. There was a hint of mockery in his eyes.

“Do it!”

His heart skipped a beat. He looked at the blood barbarian demonic beast that was pointing its sharp claws at him. A teasing look appeared on his face.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

At this moment, a light dot suddenly appeared beside the group of blood savage beasts that were hunting the wandering beasts.

The light dot contained a terrifying power that seemed to be able to pierce through space.

The moment the strange beasts appeared, all the blood savage beasts revealed terrified expressions.

“Blood flow!”

The few blood savage beasts roared in unison as streams of blood flowed out from their bodies.

“Dot of light explosion!”

However, at this moment, the Strange Demonic Beast’s supernatural ability had arrived. Dot of light explosion was the strongest single-target attack.

Coupled with the piercing pupil, the strongest attack landed on the vital points of the blood barbarian demonic beast.

Boom

The sound of an explosion was heard instantly.

“Ahhhh!”

In an instant, a miserable scream was heard.

“You want to kill me!”

The face of the half-step Void Interpretation Blood Barbarian demonic beast, who was pointing at Wang Xian from afar, sank. The black fog and blood fog around its body caused the Ao demonic beast to reveal itself.

Its sharp head emitted a blood-red sharp thorn. The sharp thorn emitted a dark-red glow and was extremely deep.

Blood Shadow penetration!

It was not only this half-step void interpretation demonic beast that reacted.

There were seven to eight other blood barbarian demonic beasts that reacted in time and immediately counterattacked the strange demon.

Blood Shadow Penetration was a single-target attack similar to the dot explosion. It possessed unparalleled penetration and attack power.

The release of the blood shadow penetration divine ability caused the few strange demons to lose the opportunity to release the divine ability, dot explosion.

However, none of the strange demons panicked.

A hint of disdain flashed in Ao Yao’s eyes.

He thought that he had dodged their assassination, but the real killing intent had just begun.

“Light and dark void!”

Ao Yao’s body trembled slightly as the blood shadow penetrated through Ao Yao’s body.

Light and dark dot explosion!

Void!

Light Dot Explosion!

The other strange demons also released the same divine ability.

Void, for a short moment, was immune to all attacks.

This was a very heaven-defying divine ability.

During the period of void, they were invincible.

When the void passed, the moment the Blood Barbarian Demon Beast was shocked, killing intent came.

“No!”

The half-step void interpretation level blood barbarian demon beast showed fear on its face, and its eyes were filled with panic as it roared loudly.

Boom! Boom! Boom

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The sounds of explosions and screams were immediately recalled. Even if the blood barbarian demonic beast didn’t die at the first instance, it was instantly followed by the strange demon and its last chance of survival was cut off.

In just a short second, 21 blood barbarian demonic beasts died.

Including one half-step void interpretation level existence!

“Roar!”

Wang Xian roared. The Flames on his body rose and covered the entire area.

He moved!

“Roar Roar! Kill them! Kill them all!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The leader of the blood barbaric demonic beasts who was standing at the back was stunned. Clearly, he did not expect that terrifying creatures would suddenly appear and directly assassinate their 21 clansmen.

Out of the 21 clansmen, none of them escaped.

At this moment, he could not hold it in any longer. He moved his body and charged towards Wang Xian.

“I’ll leave the rest to you guys. Ao Yao, we’ll take care of the other four half-step void interpretation demonic beasts!”

Wang Xian’s 35-meter-tall body swept his tail towards one of the demonic beasts.

The demonic beast still wanted to put up a desperate fight. Its body flew backward rapidly.

“Whoosh!”

“Bang!”

At this moment, a half-step void interpretation demonic beast appeared on Wang Xian’s body. The sharp claws in its hands pierced towards the dragon scale.

However, the dragon scales, which were comparable to a half-step void interpretation defensive weapon, only left behind a few scars.

“You’ve ruined our plan. I, the Blood Barbarian, will definitely kill you!”

A cold and emotionless voice rang out. Instantly, thousands of figures materialized and attacked Wang Xian at the same time

“Divine Dragon’s fire tail!”

The light and dark fire dragon’s eyes locked onto one of the bodies. Wang Xian’s dragon tail was like lava. The Flames were restrained and swept out directly.
