Chapter 561: Defeat Enemy In One Strike; Top Twenty of Da Hong

Martial Artists, regardless of which era they were in, were known to be inattentive to details, and commonly preferred to keep a long unkempt hairstyle. But this young man was clean-cut and had short hair.

His eyes were extremely sharp and he looked obstinate and unruly.

“Hmm?”

Wang Xian was deep in thought when he noticed the young man in front of him. Instinctively, he moved aside.

“Oh? Is the Dragon King always such a wuss?” the young man exclaimed after seeing Wang Xian side-stepping to his right. His derisive look intensified while his arms folded behind him and he smiled coldly at Wang Xian.

Wang Xian stopped and slowly raised his head, peering at the young man.

“That’s The Phantom, Kong Guanglin!”

“Kong Guanglin is pitting himself against the Dragon King!”

“How dare a disciple under a mountain sect that is ranked eleven call himself ‘Dragon King’? Pfft! He is just an arrogant and impertinent kid!”

“Dragon King? That title irks me to no end. Is he able to live up to such a title?”

“Haha, this is getting interesting. The Phantom Kong Guanglin is ranked among the top twenty of the Da Hong Immortal Sect’s list of Outstanding Youths. He is also the head honcho of Mt. Jiulian. Coming from a mountain sect that was ranked tenth, you can imagine how strong he is to be able to rank among the top twenty outstanding youths!”

“I guess it was the Dragon King trying to challenge Mt. Jiulian yesterday that led to the ire of Kong Guanglin, which is why he is finding fault with him today!”

“You can’t blame anyone for your actions. It is important not to show your arrogance in front of Da Hong Immortal Sect. Otherwise, you will be dealt with severely by experts!”

The surrounding disciples taunted from the sides when they saw Kong Guanglin staring at Wang Xian.

Most of these disciples came from the top ten mountain sects. They had scoffed at the Dragon King ever since they heard about him, and now they were elated at the sight of Kong Guanglin confronting him.

“I heard that there are rewards for being ranked among the Outstanding Youths?”

Wang Xian looked at Kong Guanglin and asked this casually, at the same time shifting his glance to the enormous cliff beside him.

“Eh?”

Kong Guanglin was momentarily startled before replying with a cold stare. “What a maniac you are. If you are ranked among the top twenty outstanding youths, you will be rewarded handsomely every month. Unfortunately, you are not qualified to enjoy such a privilege!”

“Simple. I will just have to defeat you to qualify!”

Wang Xian had his eyes on Kong Guanglin and spoke calmly in his direction.

“Haha, fools rush in where angels fear to tread. I love your guts. As a consequence of your preposterous challenge, I will cripple your arm!”

Kong Guanglin laughed at Wang Xian’s words, staring at him coldly at the same time.

“Such arrogance. Senior brother Kong, destroy this kid and let him know how strong Mt. Jiulian is!”

“How dare you challenge Senior brother Kong! You will soon pay the price for your insolence!”

The disciples who were following behind Kong Guanglin glared at Wang Xian with contempt.

“For someone with such mediocre strength, he sure talks big!”

“He does talk big. Challenging Kong Guanglin? I don’t know where he finds the confidence to even propose that!”

“Haha, interesting. The Dragon King versus The Phantom Kong Guanglin!”

The surrounding audience was slightly taken aback by Wang Xian’s intention to fight Kong Guanglin, but at the same time, they were thrilled by the proposition.

“It has been a while since someone showed such arrogance in front of me. That broadsword you wield is a fine piece of weaponry. If you lose, I will get to keep it!”

Kong Guanglin pointed at Wang Xian with roaring laughter. “Today, I, Kong Guanglin, have a new challenger, the Dragon King. Fellow brothers, come witness our fight at the Martial Peak!”

Kong Guanglin’s voice echoed through the surroundings, and everyone within a radius of a thousand meters was able to hear him loud and clear.

“Haha!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he made a loud chuckle and flew towards the Martial Peak with his sword in hand.

“Is it true that the winner gets to keep the loser’s possessions?”

As Wang Xian watched Kong Guanglin move towards the peak, his face was beaming.

He followed closely behind and flew towards the Martial Peak as well.

“What? The Dragon King is challenging Kong Guanglin? Is he trying to court his death?”

“Such arrogance and conceit are as good as courting death.”

“Let us head over and see how Senior brother Kong oppresses that show-off!”

“Senior brother Kong will not show any mercy to his opponents. Every one of his moves will be extremely deadly!”

The disciples of the scriptures depository, as well as those from the neighboring peaks, were delighted to hear the voice of Kong Guanglin. One by one they headed towards the Martial Peak.

Even the weakest among the top twenty disciples of the Da Hong Immortal Sect ranked in the Dan Realm.

This match between the two experts would undoubtedly be exciting to watch.

Wang Xian took a look at the surrounding disciples with a faint smile.

It was obvious that Kong Guanglin was here to find trouble with him. But this was exactly what he wanted as well.

Boom!

Wang Xian landed himself in one of the arenas as he realized that there were at least fifty arenas on Martial Peak.

The arena that they were about to compete in was situated near the top of the peak. Kong Guanglin had already entered the arena while he stared at Wang Xian with contempt.

The group of Da Hong Immortal Sect disciples levitated themselves and surrounded the arena. Their faces were filled with excitement.

“Come, I will teach you a lesson today not to be impudent in front of Da Hong Immortal Sect. Always stay low profile and humble here!”

Kong Guanglin raised his broad sword in the direction of the descending Wang Xian. “I will let you attack first!” he said mockingly. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Hear ye! This is exactly how we will educate our new batch of newcomers every time!”

“Things are getting interesting. If the Dragon King is taught a lesson by Kong Guanglin today, then his title will be nothing but a joke in the future!”

The surrounding crowd mocked Wang Xian, unbridled.

“Have a taste of my battle technique!” Wang Xian said lightly with a faint smile.

Channeling water energy into his body, Wang Xian thrust forward with his unsheathed broad sword.

“Sword Edge!”

“Water Clone!”

In an instant, Wang Xian moved his broad sword, bursting water energy and casting two battle techniques at the same time. The Water Clone, armed with a Sword Edge, made a slash for Kong Guanglin.

The real Water Clone battle technique did not create a clone that appeared as a blob of bluish water but as an exact clone of Wang Xian.

“Huh? Water Clone? You dare to use the Water Clone battle technique in front of me, The Phantom?”

Kong Guanglin saw Wang Xian’s battle technique and spoke with disdain in his eyes.

With a turn of his body, he generated five exact clones of himself.

“Kill!”

With a wave of his arm, his water clones started to attack in the direction of Wang Xian’s water clone.

The two were about a hundred meters apart, with eyes on each other.

Kong Guanglin slowly formed a smile as his water clones assailed.

Poof! Poof! Poof!

But his face soon turned stiff as he realized that his water clones had been easily destroyed without showing any sign of resistance.

“Sword Edge? Excellent. I wasn’t expecting your water clone to be controlling a Sword Edge. An ingenious move!”

Kong Guanglin showed slight respect for his opponent with his broadsword now unsheathed.

Clang!

The Ten Tiers Blade with ripples appearing on its back struck towards Sword Edge.
