3846 3845 was on the run and fighting back

“This Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is very powerful. He has three powerful soul treasures. He must have obtained them from the Void Spirit Treasure Land!”

The ten palaces and ten million legions quickly chased after him.

“He’s a level seven pantheon!”A level seven pantheon from the Decree Palace said with an extremely ugly expression.

According to the information they had obtained, the Dragon King’s trump card was comparable to five or six level seven pantheon.

The strength of their ten legions was comparable to the fighting strength of more than ten rank nine pantheon gods.

However, the Dragon King still managed to escape under such circumstances!

The strength he displayed was much stronger than the information they had obtained.

With the information they had obtained, they could have kept the Dragon King.

“The Dragon King is indeed very strong and difficult to deal with!”

A rank seven pantheon of the Heavenly Palace said with an embarrassed expression.

The true strength of the Dragon King had exceeded their expectations.

“Continue to chase him. With our strength, we can kill him as long as we trap him.”

A rank seven pantheon said coldly!

The other ten palace gods nodded solemnly.

They had already clashed with the Dragon Palace.

Although dozens of type 7 pantheon gods had been killed, they had a clear understanding of the Dragon King’s strength.

With their full strength, they could still kill him.

But first, they had to trap the Dragon King!

“Continue the pursuit. The power of faith contained in our group is too great. The Dragon King can sense it. We’d better surround him!”

“As long as we can fight him head-on, we can kill him.”

A rank 7 god of the Heavenly Palace said.

“Yes, continue the pursuit!”

The gods from the ten palaces nodded.

Knowing oneself and one’s enemy was the key to victory. Their earlier failure was due to their Misestimation of the Dragon King’s strength. That was why they allowed him to escape.

However, they were confident that it would be difficult for him to escape the next time.

The experts from the ten palaces continued their pursuit.

“How did the experts from the ten palaces lock onto me? I have been searching for them for so long, but I have yet to find them. Yet, they were able to find me so easily. It seems like they have some special method.”

At the same time, Wang Xian was mumbling in front of him.

Although the battle just now was a little dangerous, the rewards were still not bad.

The corpses of the sixty-three rank seven gods were another huge reward.

A smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face. After hesitating for a moment, he prepared to fly in the direction of the nine-origin universe passage.

He was preparing to leave this area.

Now that he had been discovered and was being hunted down by the gods who believed in the universe, there was no longer a need for him to continue staying here.

In the future, it would be much more difficult to kill the gods who believed in the universe wantonly.

Not only that, he would be in danger instead.

Therefore, he was prepared to return.

The gains he had now were already terrifying enough. He had to go back and think of a way to raise the abilities of Lan Qingyue and the rest.

Once Lan Qingyue, Xiao Lan, and the rest improved once again, they would be comparable to the gods at the peak of the ruler realm!

When the time came, he would deal with them.

With this thought in mind, Wang Xian flew quickly.

However, a few months later, Wang Xian suddenly felt a rush of savage aura.

This aura belonged to the space behemoth.

He focused his gaze and looked to the right.

“That’s not right. There’s one at the back too.”

Wang Xian’s mind stirred as he looked to the back.

“Faith, God of Chaos!”

At this moment, a cold and loud voice was heard.

When Wang Xian heard this voice, his expression changed slightly.

“He caught up to me again?”

Wang Xian mumbled.

As he was walking diagonally, he was caught up by the other party.

However, even if he was walking diagonally, the gods that believed in the universe were able to lock onto him so quickly and catch up to him. This caused him to be filled with shock.

His body moved. Without the slightest hesitation, he changed his direction and fled into the distance.

The Tai Chi Dragon Disc and the five elements great mill wrapped around him, protecting him.

“Buzz Buzz Buzz!”

Buzz Buzz Buzz

In the next second, a vast voice filled with the power of faith surged into his mind.

This voice caused the energy circulation speed in his body to be reduced by 80% instantly.

A thought of submitting to the other party emerged in his mind.

This voice was pervasive and disturbing.

“Yin-yang Space!”

Wang Xian shouted in a low voice. The Tai Chi Dragon disc rotated and placed him in a special space to isolate this strange voice of faith.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

At this moment, a roar was heard. Waves of energy gushed towards him.

Wang Xian moved his body and controlled the soul battleship to increase its speed!

The energy gushed into the air but did not hit Wang Xian.

“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, you can’t escape. Since you dare to kill us, the believers of the gods, you must. Your Dragon Palace will be destroyed as well!”

The angry voices of the gods could be heard from the back.

When Wang Xian heard that, his eyes were filled with coldness.

“Do you really think I can’t do anything to you guys?” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Wang Xian’s eyes were cold, and there was a glint in them.

With a thought, he immediately took out his communication stone plate and sent a message.

Sensing the pursuit from the back, Wang Xian increased his speed to the maximum and shook them off once again.

“Continue the pursuit! Continue the pursuit!”

“The treasures on him can withstand the impact of the god of confusion. It’s best if he can conceal his aura next time. Otherwise, he will be discovered in advance.”

The seven-tiered gods of the ten palaces roared loudly and continued the pursuit behind Wang Xian.

In the next few days, Wang Xian was escaping rapidly.

However, ten days later, Wang Xian saw a life planet in front of him and immediately flew over.

When he arrived at the life planet, he waved his arm and a demonic spirit altar was formed.

Soon, in the demonic spirit altar, an lie and 20,000 cursed dragons appeared.

Cursed Dragons!

This was a trump card of the Dragon Palace.

Wang Xian had already verified the power of the cursed dragons. With 2,000 cursed dragons, they could kill a space behemoth that was at level seven.

The reason why Wang Xian summoned them was to use the cursed dragons to deal with them.

“I just don’t know what the cursed dragons will do to the gods who believe in the Universe!”

Wang Xian looked at the 20,000 cursed dragons that he had summoned, and his eyes revealed a look of contemplation.

A space beast that was at level seven was comparable to the strength of the gods at their peak.

However, the curse of the cursed dragon was not an ordinary attack, but the power of the curse.

The curse entered the physical body directly.

In terms of the physical body, there was not much difference between a level seven pantheon and a level seven astral beast.

Of course, the Astral Beast still had a strong advantage in terms of the physical body.

However, the difference was that the power of faith of the level seven pantheon was suppressed by a lot.

Wang Xian wasn’t sure how many cursed dragons could kill a seventh-level god.

After all, this curse was somewhat special.
