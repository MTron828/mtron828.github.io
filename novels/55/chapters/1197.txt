Translator: 5496903

The second Prince’s banquet slowly came to an end.

The people who came to attend the banquet today were filled with shock.

They were shocked by the second prince’s powerful strength and the young man who caused the second prince to turn against the six element sect.

But no matter what, the entire banquet went very smoothly. After seeing the second Prince’s power, many people were extremely moved.

The powerful beasts’mounts were beyond everyone’s expectations.

“Brother Wang Xian, I’m really sorry about today!”

“It’s alright. Brother Long Xiaotian, if you need to refine elixirs in the future, you can come and look for me. It’s still the same price!”

Wang Xian walked out from the villa of the banquet. He and Long Xiaotian walked out side by side and chatted.

“Haha, of course, that...”

Long Xiaotian laughed out loud. After hesitating for a moment, he said, “Brother Wang Xian, you should know that I’m competing for the position of the Crown Prince Now. I Won’t hide it from you. Brother Wang Xian, can you help me tame some ferocious beasts in the future?”

“Brother, don’t worry. I’ll definitely give you a lot of spirit stones!”

As he spoke, he looked at Wang Xian expectantly.

“Sure, no problem.”

Wang Xian agreed without a second thought.

Taming ferocious beasts was very easy for him. Naturally, he would be very happy to use the ferocious beasts to exchange for the spiritual liquid.

“Alright, Alright. Thank you, brother Wang Xian. If I can reach the top in the future, I will definitely repay you well!”

Long Xiaotian nodded excitedly when he heard his agreement. He could not help but laugh out loud.

“What is the relationship between the second prince and that young man? Why are they so close?”

“Why do I feel that the second prince is trying to curry favor with that young man on purpose? He even poured wine for him during the banquet?”

“Could it be that this young man’s background is not simple? He is very strong and can be ranked on the prodigy roll!”

At the back, the people who were attending the banquet were watching in astonishment as they discussed in low voices.

“Oh right, Brother Long Xiaotian, please help me find a place to stay. It would be best if it’s a secluded and isolated courtyard!”

Wang Xian and Long Xiaotian were flying in the sky. After thinking for a while, they spoke to him.

“Eh? What’s wrong, brother? Isn’t it good for you to stay at our place?”

Long Xiaotian was stunned for a moment before he replied hurriedly.

“It’s a little inconvenient. I like to live alone and I might have to stay here for the next period of time. Therefore, I want to find a place to live alone!”

Wang Xian shook his head and explained immediately.

“Then, brother Wang Xian, please wait for a moment. I will get someone to find a place for you to live alone immediately!”

Long Xiaotian nodded his head slightly. He immediately sent a few messages through the communication stone plate.

What Wang Xian did not expect was that when they had just returned to the island of the Guanglong dynasty, the place he wanted had already been found.

“Second prince, there is a suitable house in the Pine Poplar Forest. We have already bought it!”

An old man came forward and reported to long Xiaotian.

“Pine and Poplar Forest? Sure, sure. That place is not bad. Brother Wang Xian, I will bring you there to take a look immediately!”

Long Xiaotian nodded his head in satisfaction.

“Alright, Sorry to trouble you. If you need anything in the future, contact me through the communication stone plate. I will definitely not decline if I can help you!”

Wang Xian promised long Xiaotian when he saw how helpful he was.

After knowing long Xiaotian for the past few days, Wang Xian was very satisfied with his character and actions.

In addition, his personality was very appetizing. Wang Xian did not mind making him a friend.

Since they were friends, Wang Xian would definitely not be stingy if he could help.

“Haha, Alright, Alright. Brother Wang Xian, if you have any matters here, feel free to look for me. I, Long Xiaotian, will definitely not decline!”

Long Xiaotian patted his chest excitedly when he heard Wang Xian’s words.

Wang Xian smiled. Under the lead of the old man, the two of them flew towards the location in front of them.

“Second prince, this young master, this is the place. Pine and Poplar Forest. This is the construction of the Snow Moon Empire. It can be considered a better place to stay in the cemetery of the human and Demon!”

The few of them came to the front of a patch of forest. It was different from the forest in the cemetery of the human and demon. It was a type of green tree that emitted a faint fragrance.

Below them was a group of courtyards with about a hundred rooms.

The old man brought them to the front of a courtyard and took out the key to open the door.

The environment in the small courtyard was elegant and very beautiful. A pine and poplar tree that was more than ten meters tall covered more than half of the courtyard.

The courtyard was very large. There were five to six houses and some ordinary spiritual herbs were planted at the entrance.

There was a small river around the courtyard. There were some fish swimming in it.

Wang Xian was very satisfied after taking a look.

“Thank you, Brother Long Xiaotian. I’ll stay here tonight!”

Wang Xian said directly.

“Alright, Alright. Brother Wang Xian, if you need anything, you can come and look for me!”

Long Xiaotian nodded.

Following that, they returned to the island of the Guanglong dynasty. Wang Xian rode the spirit Zilin back.

The surrounding environment of the pine and poplar forest was very good. There was an empty space in front of the courtyard, and there were also courtyards nearby.

Those who could live here were not ordinary members of the mercenary group.

Wang Xian opened the door and entered. The Spirit Zilin strolled around in the courtyard.

Wang Xian ignored it. He walked into the room and took a look. He took out long Xiaotian’s communication stone plate and began to check out the situation of the cemetery of the human and demon.

His original purpose of coming to the tomb of the human demon was to obtain a large amount of spiritual liquid. Now, it was time for him to take action.

“The training ground of the blood stream sect, the training ground of the blood stream sect, the main hall of the blood stream sect, and the Heaven’s pride stage of the Blood Stream sect.”

Wang Xian looked at the most important places in the tomb of the human demon. He was deep in thought as he thought about which place to go first. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Wa-wa-wa-wa!”

“Roar!”

“Roar! Roar!”

Just as Wang Xian was looking through the documents, he heard a roar from the side.

He was slightly stunned as he looked over quickly.

Beside the wall, Ling Zilin was biting a small demonic beast cub.

This little guy was like a dog. He had a black and white face with a white dot between his eyebrows.

“Awooo!”

The Demonic Beast Cub was bitten by Ling Zilin, and it let out a painful cry.

Wang Xian was slightly stunned. Where did this demonic beast cub come from?

“Xiao Ha!”

At this moment, a woman suddenly jumped onto the wall. When she saw Ling Zilin biting her pet, her expression changed drastically.

She moved her arm and a long sword appeared in her hand. A sharp light pointed straight at Ling Zilin. “Put Xiao Ha down!”

“Roar!”

Ling Zilin saw a woman attacking it and a cold look appeared in his eyes. He let out a low roar and a ferocious aura was emitted slowly.

“Zilin, let go!”

Wang Xian looked over and ordered Ling Zilin. He looked at the woman and said, “Beauty, this is my home. Take care of your pet. Otherwise, it will be eaten by my mount!”

“Take good care of your pet too. Don’t let it run past the yard!”

The lady’s entire body was extremely cold. She was like a sharp longsword as she spoke to Wang Xian coldly.

“WA, WA, wa!”

The Demonic Beast Cub that came out of Ling Zilin’s mouth ran into the lady’s arms and cried out in grievance.
