Chapter 810: In the terrifying Battle of 0811

Translator: 549690339

“Oh no!”

“What?”

Everyone was shocked. They quickly turned their heads and looked in the direction of the scream in shock.

“Qian Jiang!”

A somewhat terrified roar was heard. The voices of the Holy Doctors, Holy Medicine, and the two immortal sects could be heard.

“It’s too fast. It’s simply too fast.”

“The battle has just begun, and then an immortal god was killed. This is simply too terrifying.”

“The Dragon King’s cultivation technique should be similar to those bloodline warriors in the OU continent. As long as one has the bloodline of a creature, they can transform into such a creature. However, the Dragon King has actually obtained the bloodline of the Divine Dragon. This is too unbelievable. No wonder the Dragon King can rise so quickly!”

“It’s that white shadow that has been hiding in the void, ready to launch a fatal attack at any time!”

The surrounding disciples who had been paying attention to this side looked at the immortal God who had died in shock.

An immortal God had actually been killed so quickly.

The terrifying white figure and the terrifying upper-level immortal Dragon King.

No one had expected that the Dragon King would be able to unleash such terrifying strength.

“Dragon King, if you want to destroy us, I will make you pay a heavy price. Kill!”

Bian Jiangtu’s eyes were bloodshot as he commanded the surrounding immortals.

“Yes, Kill!”

The rest of the immortals were also stirred up by the blood. They attacked the enemies in front of them with grief and indignation.

“Kill!”

Wang Xian’s expression did not change. He swayed his body and attacked Bian Jiangtu directly.

As an upper-level immortal, Wang Xian could only suppress him at most. It was very difficult to kill him.

However, he only needed to control them.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

At this moment, the battle at the side erupted completely. The nine terrifying figures of the flood dragons transformed into green shadows that shuttled tens of thousands of meters high in the sky.

Their entire bodies carried terrifying storm blades.

“Tree world!”

A middle-aged man waved his arm, and towering trees appeared in the void.

Each tree grew to a thousand meters in size, with terrifying tentacles.

The other elders also sprinkled green seeds, turning into towering trees in an instant.

“Blade Storm!”

Just as the tree world, which covered an area of four to five kilometers, was formed, the nine flood dragons’bodies trembled.

Green energy floated up from the scales, and each energy was the same size as the scales.

The nine flood dragons moved, and hundreds of thousands of wind attribute scales charged towards the book world.

“Crash!”

The terrifying storm of blades tore apart all the trees like a level ten gale.

“Careful!”

At this moment, a bolt of lightning descended from the sky and attacked an immortal god.

“Wooden ring!”

The old man’s expression changed slightly. He waved the staff in his hand, and a wooden hoop met the bolt of lightning.

“Crack!”

In an instant, the wooden hoop turned pitch-black under the attack of the Lightning.

“Whoosh!”

A lightning spear seemed as though it was about to tear apart the void. It carried a terrifying might as it pierced towards the old man.

Following that, Ao Qi held the Lightning Hammer in his hand as he approached the old man.

The old man’s expression changed slightly. He originally had the strength of a middle-level immortal. Even if he was facing Ao Qi of the Lightning attribute, who was restraining him, he could still resist and even gain the upper hand.

However, he had to be careful of the white figure in the air, so that it did not dare to release 100% of its power.

The other immortal gods of the Holy Medicine and holy medicine were the same.

After the white figure assassinated an immortal God, it once again escaped into the air. Perhaps the next time it attacked, there would be more deaths.

“I’ll roast you!”

At the side, an old man with a face full of rage raised his beard. He furiously waved the staff in his hand and attacked ao shrimp.

Ao shrimp’s golden body was like a heavenly soldier. His huge pincers could easily break metal and rock.

A set of fire rings descended from the sky and fell toward ao shrimp.

Ao shrimp’s gaze did not change. His body continued to approach the old man.

“Die!”

Seeing that Ao Shi did not Dodge, the old man’s eyes flashed with a sharp light. The rings of fire exploded, becoming even more ferocious.

“Weng!”

At this moment, a jade-blue stream of water appeared out of thin air on Ao Shi’s body. The stream of water formed an armor, instantly lifting up a space.

“Not good, help me!”

The old man’s expression instantly changed, and he cried out for help.

However, at this moment, there was no one else who could help him.

The two immortal sects already had six fewer immortal gods than the Dragon Gate. Only a middle-level immortal could deal with two of them. A lower-level immortal could not even protect himself.

“Ka Ka!”

The huge pincers attacked, and the two-meter-long metal pincers became bigger again. They actually became five meters in size.

The pincers clamped down heavily, causing the old man’s face to turn pale. His staff shone with light.

Boom

His entire body was instantly surrounded by flames that were like lava.

Crack! Crack

However, under the terrifying pincers, the lava directly collapsed.

“Fire escape!”

He waved his arm, and a fire tunnel instantly appeared in front of him. His body quickly retreated.

“What?”

However, at this moment, a water tentacle had somehow trapped his legs and completely pulled his body.

With a wave of his arm, a fiery red liquid that was like a drop of water directly slashed at the water tentacle.

“Weng!”

At this moment, two pincers attacked him.

“Ah!”

The old man’s face was filled with shock. With a shake of his legs, his legs were directly shattered to the knees.

His crippled legs erupted like a god of fire.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

Ten thousand meters in the air, it was as if a volcano had appeared out of thin air. Terrifying lava erupted from it.

The lava waterfall fell towards the ground.

The terrifying fire energy landed on the ground and formed a huge sea of flames.

The energy contained within the body of an immortal god expert was extremely terrifying. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Can you escape?”

At this moment, an icy voice sounded from behind. A claw pierced through the chest of the elder who had just tried to escape.

“Cough Cough!”

The elder spat out blood. His eyes were dim as his body fell to the ground.

He already had a premonition that this battle was a one-way ticket to death. That was why he gave up his legs and went all out.

He wanted to kill one, but unfortunately, one immortal god was enough to suppress him. He was no match for the other two.

“The second immortal God is dead!”

The experts and immortal gods watching from afar said in their hearts.

Suppression, 100% suppression.

They discovered that the two immortal gods of the Dragon Palace could fight against a middle-level immortal.

Two immortal gods could kill a lower-level immortal without being injured.

The difference in strength between the immortal gods of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect and the immortal gods of the Dragon Palace was simply too great!

“I reckon that apart from the supreme elder of the upper-level immortal sect who managed to escape, everyone else is finished!”
