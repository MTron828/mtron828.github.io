Chapter 1610: 1610 world-shaking 3

“I’m going to fight it out with you!”

When Patriarch Fengchi saw Wang Xian’s devouring gaze, a look of despair appeared on his face.

Green light seeped out from his entire body and he raised the huge fan in his hand high up.

Feathers gathered on the fan and flew towards Wang Xian heavily.

The wind feathers that were like thorns instantly covered an area of ten kilometers.

Patriarch Fengchi unleashed his strongest attack without holding back.

At this stage, he could only go all out!

“This is more interesting!”

The appearance of Lan Qingyue made Wang Xian completely relaxed. Next, he only had to go all out to kill Patriarch Fengchi. Then, he would succeed.

Wang Xian’s dragon claws contained a grayish energy. His body completely ignored Feng Yu’s attack.

Countless feathers landed on Wang Xian’s dragon body, causing his entire body to be drenched in blood.

However, he did not resist at all. Instead, he placed all his strength on his dragon claws.

“You’re a lunatic, you’re a Lunatic!”

The elder looked at Wang Xian’s determination with extreme fear on his face.

He could not understand why a young demon would want to go against his old bones.

You still have 4,000 to 5,000 years of life left. Why would you want to go against someone like me who only has a few hundred years of life left!

“Go to hell!”

Wang Xian roared with a ferocious look on his face. He clawed at Patriarch Fengchi’s body with his dragon claws.

“Go to Hell, too! Crippled Wind Slash!”

Patriarch Fengchi’s face turned ferocious as well. He waved the huge fan in his hand like a ferocious ghost.

A green broken sword that was at least 2,000 meters in size slashed towards Wang Xian’s body.

The two of them were completely carrying out their final attack.

“Explode!”

The Dragon Claw held onto elder Fengchi’s body. The destructive power of the five elements that was brewing within it caused elder Fengchi’s expression to change drastically.

“Ahhhh!”

A tremendous pain came from his mouth.

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

However, at the spot above Wang Xian, the huge wind slash caused his dragon body to be cut in half.

“Hahaha, I, Wang Xian, will return again. Next time, the entire vast area will be under my feet!”

Wang Xian could feel his vitality disappearing rapidly. When he saw that Patriarch Fengchi in front of him was completely dead, he laughed out loud.

His body fell towards the spot below.

“Xiao Xian!”

Seeing that Wang Xian was injured, Lan Qingyue’s eyes turned slightly red.

“Wang Xian!”

Ling Jian ‘er cried out in pain instantly.

“Buzz Buzz Buzz!”

Lan Qingyue waved her arm with an embarrassed expression. The five elements in the sky turned into a crown of five elements and flew into her hand.

Wang Xian’s dragon body was directly stored into the interspatial ring.

“Xiao Lan, destroy!”

Lan Qingyue roared furiously.

Even though she knew that Wang Xian could be resurrected, she was still extremely furious when she saw her beloved being killed.

“Wu Wu Wu!”

Xiao Lan let out a roar. Her gigantic body was like a meteorite crashing into a planet, crashing downwards.

Her body was emitting a grayish energy.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

A series of explosions could be heard.

The entire lone mountain range had 108 mountains, each of which was 10,000 meters in size.

However, under Little Blue’s impact, they were like small saplings as they quickly collapsed.

“Fengchi!”

“Patriarch Fengchi!”

“Patriarch!”

However, when the supreme sect leader of the lone sect, all the experts and disciples saw Patriarch Fengchi’s death, they also roared in fear. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Damn it, barbarian goddess, Stop!”

The supreme sect leader looked extremely embarrassed when he saw Xiao Lan’s terrifying destructive power.

The entire supreme sect was the foundation and base of the supreme sect for tens of thousands of years!

This was a terrifying paradise for wind attribute cultivators.

Because of the existence of these Green Mountains, the supreme sect was able to produce an endless stream of experts.

However, once the place where the sect was established was destroyed, their foundation would lose 70-80% .

In particular, there was also the death of a ninth level profound void tier sect’s guardian expert.

However, facing the savage beast-like little blue, the supreme sect leader didn’t dare to face her head-on.

With this ten thousand meter long body, firm defense, and terrifying strength, who at the same level could withstand it?

The supreme headmaster could only continue to attack from the side.

“It’s over, it’s over, our sect’s losses this time are too great!”

“Why would our sect provoke such a person!”

“If Young Master Ao Tian didn’t fight with the Sky Demon for the woman, our sect wouldn’t be in such a miserable state!”

Looking at the fall of patriarch Feng Chi and the destructive power of the savage beast, all the disciples and powerhouses of the sect were terrified.

At this moment, they didn’t have the slightest aura of being the supreme sect.

After today, their supreme sect would become the weakest among the three super forces.

Moreover, outside, they even had two mortal enemies of the ninth level of the profound void tier!

Mo Sha and the Savage Goddess.

“Savage Goddess, if you dare to destroy again, then don’t even think about leaving today.”

The supreme sect leader saw that 80 to 90 of the 108 mountains had collapsed. His face was blood red as he roared.

At this moment, his hair was disheveled and he looked wretched and ferocious.

“Supreme sect leader, do you really think that I’m afraid of You? !”

Lan qingyue stared at the supreme sect leader and shouted with a frosty expression.

“Madam Devil, quit while you’re ahead. Let’s Go!”

At this moment, Mo Sha, who was fighting with Nangong Jianghe, suddenly felt a pain in his heart. He was shocked and quickly said.

“Huh?”

Lan Qingyue hesitated for a moment and stared at the supreme headmaster coldly. She slowly glanced at everyone around her.

“Listen Up, my sect. We will return soon and completely destroy you!”

She said with a cold expression.

“Little Blue!”

With a light shout, little blue stopped and slowly opened her huge mouth.

“Madam Mo, Wait for me!”

Mo Sha hurriedly came to Lan Qingyue’s side.

Lan Qingyue looked at Mo sha and looked coldly at everyone in front of her.

A black hole appeared in the sky out of thin air.

“Wu Wu!”

Little Blue cried out as her huge mouth enveloped Lan qingyue, Ling Jian ‘er, and Mo sha within.

The ten-thousand-meter-long body slowly entered the black hole.

“It’s... It’s too terrifying. The Sky Devil has fallen, Patriarch Fengchi of our sect has fallen, and the entire sect has been reduced to ruins. Heavens!”

“The curtain has fallen. Who would have thought that such a situation would occur? Heavens, two of the strongest experts in the vast region have fallen!”

“Today’s battle is destined to shake the entire vast region. Sky Devil and Mo Sha, Lone Sect, southern royal family, the wilderness goddess...”

Looking at the black hole that was slowly disappearing, all the factions were extremely shocked!
