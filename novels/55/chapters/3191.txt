Chapter 3192: Under the invincible defense of 3191

“Kill!”

All the disciples of the ancient painting sect were filled with excitement and killing intent when they heard their master’s order.

The Dragon Palace was no match for them.

The disciples of the Dragon Palace escaped to their Dragon Palace.

The victory of this battle belonged to them.

“Break!”

“Falling Stars!”

The Grand Supreme Elder of the ancient painting sect moved and floated in the sky above the Dragon Palace!

He raised both his hands and the ancient painting floated in the sky. Countless stars appeared on it.

The stars in the sky directly smashed toward the Dragon Palace.

“Mountain and river suppression, Break!”

The sect master of the ancient painting sect also had a cold expression on his face. A mountain and river appeared and directly pressed toward the Dragon Palace.

“Break!”

“Break through the Dragon Palace and destroy all of them.”

The other venerables of the ancient painting sect immediately released a terrifying attack.

Vast and mighty energy covered the Dragon Palace.

In the Dragon Palace, Prime Minister Gui and the others looked outside as if it was the end of the world. Their expressions did not change in the slightest.

“Damn it, I’ve really suffered a great loss this time. I’ve lost a lot of energy in my body.”

On the side, Ba Qi looked at his arm that was slowly recovering and growled in a low voice with an extremely embarrassed expression.

“When the Dragon King comes and the willow deity returns, we’ll kill all of them. We won’t let any of them off.”

Prime Minister Gui growled with a sullen face.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

As they spoke, the terrifying stars had already landed above the Dragon Palace.

The mountains and rivers that were even larger than the Dragon Palace had also landed.

A huge explosion came from outside. However, when their attack landed above the Dragon Palace, the Dragon Palace did not move at all and was not damaged at all.

“What?”

“What?”

Seeing that their attack didn’t break the Dragon Palace, the Master of the ancient painting sect changed his expression and his smile slowly disappeared.

“The defense of this dragon palace is quite terrifying. Their Dragon Palace must have inherited the powerful divine dragon’s Dragon Palace.”

Heavenly Dragon Duke looked over and said with a frown.

“Powerful? How powerful can it be? I don’t believe that the defense of their dragon palace is comparable to that of the Sky Sea Dragon Palace.”

The leader of the ancient painting sect said with a solemn face.

“Attack together and break this Dragon Palace!”

Sky Dragon Duke’s eyes gleamed and he roared in a low voice.

“Yes!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The Universe Knights of the Sky Dragon race nodded.

“Roar!”

They roared in unison and flapped their huge wings.

Soon, a huge wind blade formed in the sky.

There were also countless dragon claws made of metal.

“Together!”

The 50 universe knights from the ancient art school shook and started to gather energy.

A vast energy that could easily destroy stars gathered in the sky above Dragon Palace.

“Attack!”

Heavenly Dragon Duke ordered and the 150 universe knights attacked Dragon Palace.

“Hong Hong Hong!”

A terrifying explosion sounded, and countless law energies flew towards the Dragon Palace, as if it was going to destroy the world.

“Peng Peng Peng!”

However, even when this world-destroying energy landed on the Dragon Palace, it still couldn’t leave any traces.

It didn’t move!

“This…”

Seeing that the Dragon Palace wasn’t damaged at all, at this moment, all the Universe Knights revealed embarrassed expressions.

Their combined attack, and it was an all-out attack, actually couldn’t break through the defense of the Dragon Palace.

The entire Dragon Palace didn’t even tremble, this made them feel unbelievable.

“Let’s attack from another place!”

The Knights of the Sky Dragon Clan had a bad feeling.

The Sky Dragon King scanned his surroundings, his body moved and immediately flew towards the back of the Dragon Palace.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

All the venerables of the ancient painting sect and the Heavenly Dragon Clan immediately followed behind.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

Soon, terrifying attacks fell toward the Dragon Palace. They even unleashed their law forms to bombard it.

The Dragon Palace, which had a circumference of tens of millions of kilometers, attacked from all directions under their attacks.

However, the continuous attacks on the Dragon Palace didn’t have the slightest fluctuation.

Later, the venerables of the two forces condensed their attacks into one point and attacked continuously.

The entire Dragon Palace still didn’t have the slightest trace.

“Damn it, all the disciples of the ancient painting sect of the Heavenly Dragon Clan, release your attacks!”

The Heavenly Dragon Duke roared with an extremely ugly expression.

Soon, all the disciples of the two forces launched their attacks.

They covered the sky and the Earth, truly covering the sky and the earth.

All the lava around the dragon palace disappeared under their attacks.

The landscape of the entire volcano region changed a little.

Everything was swept by this terrifying energy.

Even the entire underground of the Milky Way was pierced through, revealing the terrifying gray energy below.

After several minutes of continuous bombing, the Dragon Palace still didn’t have the slightest change.

“This Dragon Palace… This Dragon Palace’s defense isn’t weaker than the Sky Sea Dragon Palace’s.”

The sect master of the Ancient Painting sect roared in a low voice with an extremely unsightly expression.

They couldn’t break through this Dragon Palace with an invincible defense.

This made them think of the Sky Sea Dragon Palace.

That Invincible Dragon Palace that was also unbreakable.

When the venerables of the Sky Dragon Clan heard this, their expressions kept changing.

They had all entered the Sky Sea Dragon Palace, and the defense inside and outside was very terrifying.

It was completely not something they could destroy.

The Dragon Palace in front of them was no worse than the Sky Sea Dragon Palace.

This made them look very embarrassed.

Once all the members of the Dragon Palace hid in the Dragon Palace, they couldn’t do anything at all.

“Sect master, what… What should we do?”

A venerable of the ancient painting sect looked at the sect master and asked with a changing expression.

The sect master of the ancient painting sect looked at Duke Tian long and the others and frowned.

“The defense of the Dragon Palace is too strong. We have to think of other ways to break it.”

The Heavenly Dragon mother flapped her wings and looked around coldly.

“What can we do?”

An expert of the Heavenly Dragon Clan couldn’t help but ask. His face was full of helplessness.

The defense of the Dragon Palace was simply invincible.

“Our clan leader might have a way.”

A venerable of the Heavenly Dragon Clan hesitated and said.

“I have a way. It might work. We can seal the Dragon Palace with a formation and absorb all the spiritual Qi in the surroundings.”

“No matter how strong the Dragon Palace is, it needs to absorb the energy of the universe. Without the energy, the Dragon Palace’s defense will be weakened. However, it will take a long time.”

The first Supreme Elder of the ancient painting sect said.

“It’s a method. Seal this place first. When our clan leader comes, we will have a way.”

The Heavenly Dragon Duke and the others nodded confidently.

They were very confident in their clan leader.

Moreover, the clan leader should have completed the heaven pilfering bloodline transformation by now.

The clan leader who had a pure-blooded bloodline would definitely receive a huge upgrade.

When the time came, breaking through the Dragon Palace would be an easy task.
