Chapter 307: Getting Something With Nothing (1)

“Sui Huang really lives up to his name. A Sacred Clan, indeed. Impressive!”

Wang Xian saw Sui Family’s spiritual medicine garden in a cave and praised Sui Huang.

The space before them was filled with various Spiritual Medicine, and most of them came with fire attribution.

All of the Spiritual Grass was glistering, and all of it ranged from Level 3 to Level 5.

Right in the middle was Level 6 Spiritual Grass.

All the different varieties added up to a few hundred tufts of Spiritual Grass in total with an inestimable value!

“Hmph, stop your bootlicking. Even if you do so, I’ll not hand over my Arts of Refining Elixr Pills to you.”

Sui Huang snorted with eyes full of haughtiness.

He remembered that this lad had exploded domineering oppression to compete with him when they first met.

Obviously, Wang Xian had wanted to overwhelm him on their first encounter.

Now, he finally gained back some face.

“Heh heh.”

Wang Xian was not embarrassed at all despite the fact that his trick was discovered. He laughed, “Didn’t you ask me how I managed to raise my Spiritual Grass so easily the other time? This has got something to do with my physique, and I’m a doctor.”

As Wang Xian spoke, he walked and put his hand in the garden.

All the Spiritual Grass was glowing with faint luster as it absorbed the immense Azure Dragon Energy injected into the garden.

Whoo!

Wang Xian pretended to be tired as he wiped the film of sweat he purged from his forehead. Then, he smiled at Old Sui. “How is it? Look at the spiritual medicine garden. Don’t you think their vitality has increased?”

“That’s...true!”

Old Sui was taken aback as he looked at the spiritual medicine garden. The Spiritual Grass grew livelier after Wang Xian placed his hand in the garden. Even those that were dying came back to life completely.

“You’re welcome!”

Wang Xian smiled and waved his hands.

Old Sui’s face turned black as soon as he heard him. Who wants to thank you?

“All right, it’s almost time. Tonight’s disciple acceptance ceremony will begin soon!” said Old Sui to Wang Xian.

“Okay, I’ll observe from the side and see how you guys hold the ceremony,” Wang Xian said with a beaming face as he followed behind.

“Laozu!”

“Great grandfather!”

“Grandfather!”

As soon as they walked out of the cave, they saw the descendants of Sui Family walking toward the Sacred Mountain. They were slightly taken aback when they saw Sui Huang walking out. Immediately, they bowed to him with respect.

“Okay!”

Sui Huang nodded and entered the same room that he had come out of just now.

Sui Family members gazed at Wang Xian with doubts. They did not understand why a young man was standing beside Laozu.

“Master!”

Guan Shuqing, who was waiting in the room, came out immediately as soon as Wang Xian and Sui Huang stepped in.

“Mm, beautiful. Beautiful!”

Sui Huang looked at Guan Shuqing with a satisfied expression on his face and chuckled.

Guan Shuqing was wearing some vintage wear that resembled those uniforms from before the 1950s. Her clothes were all-black with a flower embroidered at the chest.

On it was written, “Two.”

This represented the second-generation of Sui Family, and also the disciple of Sui Huang.

Sui Family’s uniforms looked the same except for the numbers at the chest to distinguish the generations.

“Yes, you’re quite pretty!”

Wang Xian smiled at the side, as the design of Sui Family’s uniform was beautiful.

“Let’s go. It’s almost time,” Sui Huang said to them as he looked at the wall clock that was almost striking 5 pm.

Guan Shuqing nodded. The group of people followed Sui Huang to the mountain summit.

There was a small square, half the size of a stadium, on the summit. It did not seem crowded even with more than a thousand people standing there.

On the summit were some tables with food.

The dishes were simple, just like the home-cooked food of any ordinary families.

Back in the center were nine cauldrons. The one in the middle was the biggest, about five meters in size, with flames burning in it. It was surrounded by another eight smaller cauldrons!

The cauldron in the middle was known as the Emperor Cauldron. Starting from the north in a clockwise direction, the eight cauldrons were known as Bao, Du, Cang, Gang, Tong, Fu, Jing, and Kui cauldrons.

Nine cauldrons represented prosperity for the nation and family. This meant that Sui Family would prosper forever.

There was a central seat and two accompanying seats just below it at both sides.

The three seats were empty at the moment. All the members of Sui Family aged five and above were all present. They turned their attention to Sui Huang as soon as they arrived.

“Wang Xian, you shall sit beside me. Disciple, you shall stand at the center position!” Sui Huang said to Wang Xian and Guan Shuqing.

Allowing Wang Xian to take the accompanying seat was a form of recognition of his ability, as though he was on par with Sui Huang. Therefore, he was fit to sit in that seat.

The other accompanying seat was saved for today’s main highlight, Guan Shuqing.

Wang Xian and the rest nodded. Lan Qingyue and Xiao Yu took the seats at the furthest end. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Following Sui Huang to the central position, Wang Xian smiled as he took the accompanying seat.

Sui Family members were surprised to see a young man sitting over there. All of them found it unbelievable.

How could such a young fellow deserve to sit on that accompanying seat? What ability did he possess? All the second-generation members were seated below them.

But since Laozu did not make any comment, the rest of the people did not dare to say a word.

“I’m sure you know why we’re gathered here today. I, Sui Huang, have taken a new disciple. She will be my last disciple...”

Sui Huang stood up slowly as he overlooked everyone on the stage as he spoke.

Wang Xian did not pay attention to the cumbersome ceremony procedures of the Sacred Clan. Instead, he observed the people below him.

The entire Sacred Clan, Sui Family’s, strength was gathered in this place. All the experts in the Sui Family were present.

“23 Inborn Experts. Tsk tsk. Sui Family possesses quite a formidable strength. An alchemist, indeed. He can nurture experts at a rapid speed!” Wang Xian exclaimed. He recalled that the number of Inborn Experts that Flame Palace had, including those who joined at a later stage, was only about 16.

A single Sui Family already had 23 of them. With such a strong expert like Sui Huang around, the Flame Palace was never a match.

The ceremony was usually cumbersome for ancient families. Kneeling and bowing, serving tea, and paying respects took around ten minutes.

“Okay, disciple. Come over!”

After the procedures, Sui Huang beckoned Guan Shuqing over with a beaming face.

“Yes, Master!”

Guan Shuqing smiled and took a seat by his side.

“Congratulations to father for accepting an outstanding disciple. Junior Sister, how are you? These are some gifts. I hope you like them!”

At this time, several elders who were sitting in front stood up on both sides. They bowed to Sui Huang and took out their gifts one by one.

“All of you have put in the effort. Xiao Qing, accept them. They should give you gifts!”
