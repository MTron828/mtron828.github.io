Chapter 1422: 1422. When I say who is a heaven’s pride expert, who is in the middle

“You... you are the nameless sword demon!”

A Cry of surprise came from the middle-aged man’s mouth, causing the pupils of the old man in front of the middle-aged man to constrict slightly.

The body of the middle-aged man and Helian Hu Meng Wenbing, who were lying on the ground, trembled. Their eyes were wide open, filled with disbelief.

They had only rushed up to the Heaven’s pride ranking this year. They had never seen the true appearance of the nameless sword demon before.

But they knew that there was a mountain on the prodigy roll.

At the age of less than 30, he had ascended the prodigy roll, defeated the leader of the demonic beasts at the second level of the Insight Void Tier, and ascended to the supreme prodigy.

Later, before the Nameless Sword Devil left, he did something that shook the entire demi-demon graveyard.

He killed the fifth level of the Insight Void Tier, Bing Hanzi!

This was the leader of the prodigies, the Nameless Sword Devil.

This was an existence that all the heaven’s favorites looked up to, an existence that all the heaven’s favorites could not hope to reach.

Even if all the other heaven’s favorites on the so-called Heaven’s favorites list were added together, they would not be able to instantly kill the nameless sword demon!

“Nameless Sword Demon, what is this?”

When some people around heard this exclamation, they frowned slightly.

Some people were very confused by these four words.

However, some of them were stunned. Their expressions kept changing as they stared at the people below.

“Nameless Sword Demon? What else?”

When Wang Xian saw that the middle-aged man recognized him, a faint smile appeared on his face as he asked mockingly.

“Nameless Sword Demon!”

“Nameless Heaven’s Pride!”

“The Supreme Heaven’s Pride!”

“The unrivaled young king who looked down on the present generation!”

“I didn’t expect it, I didn’t expect it...”

In the arena, Meng Wenbing, who was knocked down by Wang Xian with a flick of his finger, had a burning look in his eyes.

He stood up slowly and his body was trembling. His eyes were filled with admiration as he mumbled.

Nameless Sword Demon?

Unrivaled prodigy?

Supreme Prodigy?

The unrivaled young king who looked down on the current generation?

Stunned, the ten youths from the waning moon heard Meng Wenbing Mumble. Their eyes were burning with worship, and their faces were filled with shock.

This...

This was a peerless prodigy ranked seventh on the prodigy roll.

They didn’t know how strong seventh on the prodigy roll was, but Helian Hu, who was ranked seventeenth on the prodigy roll, had easily defeated them, making them feel powerless.

The seventh-ranked Heaven’s pride roll was even more terrifying.

However, looking at the way he worshipped them, they were in a Daze!

However, when they saw the third-ranked Seethrough void martial artist who had fallen to the ground with a flick of his finger, they had some understanding in their hearts.

“Eh... the unrivaled young king who looked down on the current generation? Is there such a title?”

When Wang Xian heard Meng Wenbing mumbling, he was slightly stunned?

He had such an amazing title?

Not Bad, not bad!

However, what Wang Xian didn’t know was that the name of the nameless sword demon represented the pinnacle of Heaven’s favorites.

Which Young Heaven’s favorites in the current era didn’t have the nameless sword demon as their idol?

Some fans even claimed that the nameless sword demon could even look down on the current era in the entire transcendental continent, not to mention in the flowing sea region.

Hence, there was an additional title later on. He was the young king who looked down on the current generation!

“Nameless sword demon...”

The city lord of Flaming Sun City and the Dean of Flaming Sun Academy were muttering to themselves. A name suddenly appeared in their minds.

“Lord Wang, I didn’t expect you and Her Majesty the Queen to come here together!”

The city lord of Flaming Sun City and the rest immediately bowed respectfully to Wang Xian.

“Lord Wang?”

Some of the experts from the families of Flaming Sun City muttered as their pupils contracted slightly.

The title of Lord Wang was very famous in the dragon-phoenix dynasty.

The families with some strength knew that the dragon-phoenix dynasty was able to develop to this stage not because of the queen of the dragon-phoenix dynasty.

Although the Queen of the dragon-phoenix dynasty was ambitious and her strength had reached the fifth level of the void interpretation realm.

The rapid rise of the dragon-phoenix dynasty was all thanks to this Lord Wang.

In Xiaoyao City, two fifth-level profound void martial stage cultivators were killed and the entire Xiaoyao city was destroyed!

In the dragon-phoenix dynasty, the real power was this Lord Wang’s faction.

His Majesty the Queen only had a very good relationship with him!

Of course, they could only make guesses in secret as to whether they were lovers or not.

“Nameless Sword Demon, Nameless Heaven’s favorite, Supreme Heaven’s favorite. I remember now. Lord Wang is actually a Supreme Heaven’s favorite. Oh My God!”

On the arena, Nangong Huahua suddenly stared at Wang Xian with burning eyes as she said excitedly.

“Eh? Huahua?”

A few young men who didn’t know looked at her in confusion.

“First place on the Heaven’s pride ranking in the demi-human graveyard. First place on the Demonic Beast Heaven’s pride ranking as his mount. He killed a level five Seethrough void martial artist!”

Nangong Huahua said quickly.

“What?”

“This...”

If they didn’t know the significance of being number one on the prodigy roll, then killing a level 5 insightful void martial artist, they knew what it meant.

“Killing a level 5 insightful void martial artist!”

Xiao Yue swallowed a mouthful of saliva, his forehead full of cold sweat.

This reminded him of two days ago, when he arrogantly wanted to spar with him.

This F * ck... he was courting death!

“I didn’t expect little brother nameless sword demon to be from the Dragon and Phoenix Empire!”

The white-haired old man’s expression changed slightly as well. He took a deep breath and spoke slowly.

He didn’t dare to be unreasonable in the face of Wang Xian who could kill a genius at level five of the Seethrough void tier.

His current attitude was better than when he was facing Feng Luan.

“What is a heaven’s Pride?”

Wang Xian glanced at the white-haired old man and ignored him. He floated in the sky and looked at the ten young men and everyone around him. Then, he asked loudly!

Everyone looked at Wang Xian in unison. There was shock and respect in their eyes!

“Heaven’s pride is it. Whoever I say is a heaven’s pride will be a heaven’s Pride!”

“The top ten in the Heaven’s pride competition held by the Dragon and Phoenix Empire. If I say they are heaven’s pride, they are!”

An overbearing voice entered everyone’s ears.

When the white-haired old man saw that Wang Xian was ignoring him, his face darkened slightly and he looked a little cold.

Buzz

At this moment, a black longsword appeared in front of Wang Xian.

“This is the demon-free sword. I used this sword in the human-demon graveyard to suppress the current generation!”

“The champion of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire’s Heaven’s favorites competition this time, I will gift this sword to him!”

The no demon sword hovered in the air. It was just a simple void piercing sword.

However, this was the sword that the nameless sword demon had once used. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“No Demon Sword!”

Meng Wenbing’s eyes were burning as he stared at the Black Sword.

In the eyes of the prodigies of the demi-human graveyard, this sword was a divine sword!

“This... is so domineering!”

“Prodigy, is this the supreme prodigy? This is too awesome, I even have the urge to submit!”

“If I say that you are a heaven’s pride, you are. Damn it, do you have to be so awesome!”

When everyone heard Wang Xian’s words, they gulped and felt a little crazy.

Perhaps, this was the spirit of a king.

“However, with Lord Wang’s status, whoever he says is a heaven’s pride will be his. No one dares to refute him, because no one has the qualifications!”

Some of the powerhouses murmured.

The white-haired elder pursed his lips and looked a little embarrassed.

“This person from the blood stream sect, do you have any objections?”

Wang Xian suddenly looked at the white-haired elder and asked.

At the same time, he flicked his finger!

A gray ball of light directly attacked him!
