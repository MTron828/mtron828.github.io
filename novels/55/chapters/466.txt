Chapter 467: Fire God’s Graveyard

“How’s my Master, Xiao Xian?” Guan Shuqing asked in eagerness the very moment Wang Xian stepped out.

A hundred pairs of eyes of the Sui people in the Grand Hall were on him as well.

“Not to worry, nothing serious, he should be able to come round shortly,” Wang Xian replied with a smile.

“Phew, thank God for it!”

“That’s great!” the Sui people exclaimed in great relief.

“That couldn’t be better. I’d be riddled with guilt should anything happen to Master because of me,” Guan Shuqing added as she heaved a sigh of relief.

With a smile, Wang Xian assured her as he patted her on the shoulder.

It did not take too long for Old Huang and the young girl to make their way out.

“How’s my father, Old Huang?”

“Nothing serious, he’ll need to rest for a couple of months. He is awake and you may go in now,” Old Huang told the crowd.

“We cann’t thank you enough, Old Huang,” expressed everyone, with heartfelt gratitude.

“Don’t mention it, it would have taken much longer if not for Miracle Doctor Wang. I’ll take my leave.” Old Huang gestured with a wave before leaving with the young lady.

The youthful girl gave Wang Xian a black look as she walked past him.

“Hmph!” she went, as she turned around and left the place.

“Let’s go in!” Wang Xian was least bothered by her, a lass who did not look any older than eighteen and seemed to be, undoubtedly, a spoiled teen.

“Master!” Guan Shuqing rushed to Sui Huang once she stepped into the room.

Also in the room were the four sons of Sui Huang with the rest remaining in the Grand Hall, not wanting to disturb.

“I’m alright, still alive!” With a tinge of paleness across his face, Sui Huang muttered as he waved.

He gave Wang Xian a glance and joked, “And I owe you one, Dragon King!”

“Haha! Which disrespectful soul has beaten you up so badly?” Wang Xian

chuckled.

“Neither were you respectful.” Sui Huang gave Wang Xian a death stare while Guan Shuqing, who was beside them, pinched him.

“Haha!” Sui Huang laughed, looking at the duo. He continued as a serious look replaced the smile on his face. “It was the Nether Flame. I was given a hefty hit by one of the Nether Flame experts. There are many powerful experts beyond our region. Sigh!”

“Nether Flame? Why did you end up in a fight when you were supposed to be on an Art of Cultivation quest?” asked the puzzled Wang Xian. Nether Flame was obviously a well-known power within the region which he was oblivious to.

“Someone has found the Fire God’s Graveyard in Dubai, where Fire God’s legacy and top-notch fire-attributed Art of Cultivation exist. It was when I tried entering the Graveyard that I met the expert and was gravely injured by him!” Sui Huang said bitterly.

“Fire God’s legacy? Who could be such an arrogant soul, to have named himself God?” the slightly startled Wang Xian asked in astonishment.

“A foreign fire-attributed expert. He must have been impressively powerful to be called God!” Sui Huang responded.

“Fire God is just one of the many that exist in the world. We have others like the Thunder God, Water God, Demon God, God of Baqi, God of Land and many many more!” With a beam, Sui Huang continued. “In actual fact, these are nothing more than formidable human beings, similar to celestial beings.”

“How could we consider one to be God then?” Wang Xian asked out of curiosity.

“The most powerful in the Underworld is said to be the Dan Realm, a realm which Nie Wushuang has surpassed. A level above Dan Realm would be Budding Realm which then leads to the Immortal Realm. This is where one would find Immortals of the Land where they are known as deities in the East and Gods in the West. Above this level comes the Hollow Breaking, but whether this realm to be regarded as Hollow Breaking or Across Cosmic remains unknown,” Sui Huang proclaimed placidly.

“Budding Realm? Immortal Realm?” Wang Xian asked in slight contemplation. Given his current combat power, which was equivalent to Level 8 of the Divine Dragon, it would be said to be comparable to Budding Realm.

And Level 9 of Divine Dragon would correspond to that of the Immortal Realm.

After Level 9, First Transformation of Divine Dragon would take place and that would either be the legendary Hollow Breaking or Across Cosmic, which had yet to be confirmed.

“You mean one could still find a ‘God’ outside our country?” Wang Xian questioned in great bewilderment.

Sui Huang pondered his question in silence. He shook and then nodded his head before commenting, “I heard from Old Huang recently that such a formidable power does exist in our region!”

“Really?” Wang Xian asked, somewhat stunned by the remark.

“Well, I wasn’t sure either. It was believed that this has to do with the disappearance of the nine cauldrons which was meant to lock spiritual Qi of the country. This was something that happened a good three hundred years ago!” Sui Huang answered.

Sui Huang shook his head in disbelief. After all, a Dan Realm expert was already more than intimidating!

If a Dan Realm expert could cross the plains at a speed faster than a plane, collapsing a dozens of meter tall mountain with a full-forced strike, how would a level above it be?

It was definitely not an overstatement for such experts to break an immortal’s limbs should Immortals of the Land exist. They could topple the mountains and overturn the seas, perishing a city with a population of millions in no time.

“Fire God’s Graveyard is indeed a land of immense treasures then!” exclaimed Wang Xian.

“That goes without saying. A corner of the Graveyard was all I viewed. Magnificent and mind-blowing!” said Sui Huang, with a faint sigh.

“I am curious to take a look then. Nether Flame, is that right? I shall avenge you while you stay home to recuperate and leave the search of Cultivation for Suqing to me, Elder,” said Wang Xian to Sui Huang with a grin.

“Are you serious? To get yourself into trouble? I suspect that all the best experts of the Asian continent are gathering over there now,” remarked Sui Huang as he frowned.

“Oh, have many experts been there?” Wang Xian’s brows furrowed.

“It was just a couple of them who had discovered that place, but word spread after my roar!” Sui Huang smirked with a smug look on his face.

“So, that’s the reason for being thrashed!” Wordlessly, Wang Xian shook his head. He then looked at Guan Shuqing and said, “You shall stay and keep Sui Huang company for a few days while I make a trip to the Graveyard.”

“Be extra careful, Xiao Xian!” Guan Shuqing frowned slightly as she urged Wang Xian.

“Not to worry, you should be aware of my capabilities and know that they are way above your aged Master!” Wang Xian chuckled.

“Get out of here, you little brat!” Sui Huang gave Wang Xian a good stare as he raged.

Deep down he knew that Wang Xian had topped the Dan Realm as he had heard from the Sui people how this man had killed the Supreme Elder of Medical Saint Sect in less than a minute.

And he had been stunned with bitterness upon hearing the news.

With a smile, Wang Xian left the room after saying a few words to Guan Shuqing. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Well, it’s time to greet the world and meet our foreign counterparts, instead of dealing with our own people, even if they are the most formidable ones!
