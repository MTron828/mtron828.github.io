Chapter 1508: 1508 if I become a demon, there will be no demon 3 in the world

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The sound of destruction was heard.

A 100-meter-long demon dragon was floating in the sky above the ancient demon city. Its tail and claws were destroying the surrounding buildings.

Those who couldn’t escape in time were all killed.

In just a few seconds, the entire north gate had been turned into ruins.

There was no sign of life. Even the ground had turned dark.

At least tens of thousands of people had died.

Gulp

In the distance, everyone from the He clan widened their eyes when they saw Wang Xian transform into a world-destroying demonic dragon and destroy the entire city wantonly. A look of fear appeared on their faces.

“Is... is he going to destroy the entire ancient demon city?”

“With his strength, it will be difficult for him to fight against the seven demon masters of the ancient Demon City!”

The voices of the He clan’s people came from their mouths.

He Yuan looked at the demonic dragon that was waving wantonly in front of him with a worried expression. His eyes were flickering.

“You Bastard, how dare you come to our ancient demon city to cause trouble!”

“Bastard, I will skin you alive today!”

“It has been a long time since anyone dared to come to our ancient demon city to cause trouble. Keke, Keke, this is really interesting!”

The voices coming from the north gate had completely attracted the attention of the devil lords in Mushroom City.

The voices were suspended in the sky as their gazes were fixed on Wang Xian.

One of them was dressed in a pitch-black robe with a hat on it, only revealing a pair of blood-red eyes.

He was holding a scythe-like weapon in his hand as he stared at Wang Xian menacingly.

The other one was as skinny as a stick. His entire head was like a skeleton. In his hand, he was holding a skeleton with eyes that were like ghostly flames.

In the middle of the room, there was an old man with two heads. His body was bloated and he had four arms. He looked ferocious and terrifying.

There were a total of seven people. Each of them looked extremely evil. The blood on his body would make ordinary people tremble.

The Seven Devil Lords stared at Wang Xian who was destroying the city with bloodthirsty eyes. The killing intent on their bodies shot straight to the clouds.

“That bastard actually dares to attack our ancient Devil City. Damn it!”

“Kill this bastard. Kill him!”

Around them, the people from the ancient Devil City looked at the Seven Devil Lords in the sky and shouted confidently.

Seven streams of killing intent had completely locked onto Wang Xian.

However, Wang Xian didn’t seem to have sensed their killing intent. He continued to destroy and destroy everything!

“B * stard, hand over your life!”

One of the Devil Masters looked at Wang Xian and ignored them. He continued to destroy and revealed a cold expression on his face.

His figure moved and with the same darkness attribute, he transformed into a black skeleton that was five thousand meters in size.

Under the setting sun, it looked exceptionally terrifying.

Boom

The skeleton attacked Wang Xian.

He raised his head and looked at the terrifying skeleton.

Roar

The Roar of the demonic dragon and a stream of black flames were spat out from his mouth as he charged towards the skeleton.

Roar! Roar

Following that, Wang Xian landed on the ground and roared loudly.

Around him, the shadows of eight demonic dragons appeared instantly.

The eight demonic dragons attacked in all directions.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

With a single attack, the entire north gate within a 20-kilometer radius was reduced to ruins!

In the sky, the dark skeleton emitted by the demon lord was dissipated by the demonic flames.

“This bastard!”

When the group of Devil Lords and everyone in the ancient Devil City saw this scene, their faces turned extremely gloomy.

This creature wanted to destroy the entire ancient Devil City!

“Kill him!”

The two-headed old man revealed a ferocious expression on his face as he roared.

“A creature of the seventh level of the Seethrough realm dares to act so arrogantly in our territory?”

After the two-headed demon lord’s voice was heard, all the demon lords moved. The seven of them emitted a terrifying aura as they attacked Wang Xian at the same time.

“Roar! Roar!”

When Wang Xian saw the seven demon lords attacking him, his face revealed an excited expression.

His figure moved and charged at them at an even faster speed.

“Keke, beheading sickle!”

“Devil Skull Devour!”

“Hand of hell!”

The Devil Masters shouted softly and attacked Wang Xian one after another.

“Kill him!”

Below, the people from the ancient Devil City revealed a ferocious smile when they saw the seven devil masters attacking at the same time.

“Roar!”

Looking at the terrifying attacks one after another, Wang Xian did not retreat at all. His dark dragon eyes swept across the seven Devil Masters.

Waves of dark power gushed out from his heart. He used his physical body to meet them.

Boom! Boom

The attacks landed on his body. Dragon scales fell off and black blood flowed out.

However, he did not seem to feel any pain. He attacked the only old demon master directly.

He opened his largest dragon mouth as if he wanted to devour her.

“Keke, Stupid Thing!”

When the demon lord saw that Wang Xian did not resist their attacks, a large amount of blood flowed out instantly. A mocking look appeared in her eyes.

She opened her arms and made a hugging gesture.

A thousand-meter-long demon shadow embraced Wang Xian.

“Roar Roar!”

It was as though Wang Xian did not feel the wounds on his body. The demon flames on his body churned as he extended his dragon claws and attacked the demon lord. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Boom

The Dragon Claws penetrated the demonic shadow, causing the demon lord to be slightly shocked.

“Do it, kill him quickly!”

She let out a sharp voice.

“Kill!”

The other six demon lords did not hesitate at all. They waved their sickles and skeletons filled the sky. The Hand of the Abyss emerged from the ground.

“Demonic scale chain!”

At this moment, Wang Xian suddenly let out a roar. A pitch-black chain that looked like it was formed by dragon scales extended out from his heart.

The Devil scale chain instantly covered an area of ten kilometers.

The pitch-black chain covered an area of ten kilometers.

“What?”

When the seven Devil Masters saw such a pure devil chain, they were shocked.

“Use your full strength. Don’t hold back!”

The two-headed Devil Master roared with a serious expression.

Boom! Boom! Boom

At this moment, Wang Xian’s devil chain moved. A portion of the devil chain attacked the Old Devil Master directly.

The rest of the devil chains swept toward the area below without any difference.

A series of explosions sounded.

“Oh no, quick, run!”

“Let’s escape from the ancient Devil City. That Bastard wants to destroy everything. Let’s Retreat First!”

Exclamations came from the area below.

Facing the Seven Devil Masters and destroying everything below, everyone in the ancient Devil City was terrified.

The attack just now had killed thousands of people below.

At this moment, all of them were terrified and wanted to flee further away.

“Flee? Even if I have to use my broken body, I will destroy everything here!”

“Roar!”

When Wang Xian saw that the people in the ancient demon city wanted to flee further away, he charged towards them with a cold expression.
