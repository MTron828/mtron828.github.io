Chapter 516: Annihilating Lord Ossein

Ga ga ga!

Ling ling ling!

When the terrifying Lord Ossein appeared, the cadaveric crows in the sky avoided the attacks of the Inferno Divine Dragon and the Nether Skull as they gathered above Lord Ossein rapidly.

The bone puppets were summoned towards him and stood before the disciples of the Remains. They were all staring at Wang Xian with bloodlust.

“Dragon King of Dragon Sect, I don’t remember our Remains having any feud with your Dragon Sect. You should be going after Dong Hua Sacred Sect instead of coming to the base of our Remains!”

The young man looked at Wang Xian with a warming smile. His ten other tentacles that were over ten meters long supported him.

“There are many people who have no feud with the Remains and yet you killed them all. I don’t need to have a feud with you to kill you!”

The Inferno Divine Dragon came back to Wang Xian and circled around him.

The Nether Skull shrank back to the size of a human head and hovered on Wang Xian’s shoulder.

“How dare you barge in the land of our Remains! You are indeed as described in the information we have gathered. Arrogant and conceited!” The smile on the young man disappeared.

He lifted his head slightly and continued, “In that case, you guys can forget about leaving. The body of a Dan Realm expert could very well be used to forge my eleventh tailbone!”

He laughed out loud and waved his ten other tailbones. On them, the human heads were wretched.

Ten pairs of eyes stared at Wang Xian. They were cold and gave Wang Xian goosebumps.

“I’ll kill the Dragon King. As for the rest, I’m leaving them to you guys!” The young man turned to Wang Xian and revealed a faint smile.

Hehe!

While he was smiling, ten creepy voices came from the ten human heads on his ten tailbones.

“Your path to the Remains is a one-way trip. Once you are here, you won’t be leaving!”

The young man opened up his arms and shut his eyes slightly. A blood-red bell appeared in his hands.

“Oh, remains that have been in a slumber! It’s time for you to rise!”

Ling ling! Ling ling!

Two clear rings sounded from the blood-red bell.

Ka ka ka ka!

All of a sudden, a bone claw emerged from the ground. Following which, black skeletons crawled out from the ground.

There were countless skeletons.

It was as though the entire ground had awakened as thousands and thousands of skeletons crawled out.

Ga ga!

Cadaveric crows cried as they circled in the air.

Their bodies had shielded the moonlight from the bright moon, causing the entire region to resemble a terrifying death region.

“This was once a major graveyard where over three hundred thousand elite soldiers died. Now that it’s awakening, the future Underworld will also be the Remains’ Underworld,” the young man mumbled to himself. Suddenly, he shouted coldly, “Kill!”

“Kill!”

The expressions on the faces of the group of disciples from the Remains were contorted as the bell rang. They immediately charged towards Wang Xian and the group.

Inborn level disciples of the Remains had ivory daggers and bone swords in their hands as they charged and attacked the twenty-seven dragonians.

Eighty to ninety Inborn experts killing twenty-odd Inborn experts should be an effortless task.

Around them, dense skeletons also charged towards the dragonians.

These skeletons were as hard as rocks and had a strength that was not weaker than a Level 6 or 7 martial artist.

Controlling skeletons is a little like necromancers in the western world. The Devil Dragon Cultivation arts can also control skeletons and the Skeletal Dragon is even better at it. If Elder Fang and Xiao Yu were here, there wouldn’t be sufficient skeletons for them to crush.

Thousands and thousands of skeletons rose from the ground below Wang Xian. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Just killing these skeletons had fully occupied the dragonians, let alone going against a huge group of Inborn experts.

The strength of the Remains had completely exceeded their expectations.

“Devour them!”

Wang Xian moved his arm and black will-o’-wisps were emitted from the Nether Skull. They grew to two meters and attacked the skeletons below him and the cadaveric crows.

“Your opponent is me! It’s been a long time since I became serious. Let’s see how far you can push me!”

The young man looked at Wang Xian as he flew into the sky directly. The ten terrifying tailbones were swaying and the heads on them were staring creepily at him.

“The second strongest expert from the Underworld? Hehe! Take my first tailbone attack!” the young man laughed as a tailbone swept towards Wang Xian with tremendous force.

“What an arrogant person!”

Ruthlessness flashed in the eyes of Wang Xian. “Today, I’ll show you my true strength too!”

Grrrr, grrr!

This time, Wang Xian didn’t attempt to hide. Before the astonished eyes of Lord Ossein, Wang Xian turned into a five-colored divine dragon.

Wang Xian lifted his head and gave a loud roar that reverberated throughout the skies.

“This is...?”

When Lord Ossein saw Wang Xian’s form, his eyes couldn’t help but constrict.

Divine dragon! Divine dragon... This... Could it be there are really divine dragons...?”

Lord Ossein looked to Wang Xian who was in the sky. A flash of surprise gleamed in his eyes but such emotions were quickly taken over by frenzy.

“Regardless of whether you are a real divine dragon or other creatures, if your body can be used to forge the eleventh tailbone, it will definitely be beautiful.

“I’m taking your body! Hehehehe!” Lord Ossein smiled and swung a tailbone towards Wang Xian.

The terrifying tailbones resembled bone chains made from metal. They were incomparably terrifying and had spikes all over them.

The wind was split as the tailbone swept towards Wang Xian’s head.

“I’ll show you my strength too!”

Ruthlessness gleamed in the eyes of Wang Xian as he swung his dragon tail across.

The dragon tail glowed in a golden light and the dragon scales stood up.

The face on the approaching tailbone looked wretched. He opened his mouth, revealed his razor-sharp teeth and droplets of water oozed out from his mouth.

Rumble!

The dragon tail and the tailbone clashed heavily together, creating a deafening boom.

Argh!

A pitiful cry came from the head on the tailbone. The moment the head clashed with the Dragon Tail, it exploded into pieces.

Cracks filled the entire tailbone and it was almost as good as useless moving ahead.

“What?”

When Lord Ossein saw the cracks on the tailbone, he was shocked and infuriated. “How dare you crush one of my tailbones! You deserve death!”

As he spoke, his entire body moved and the nine other tailbones started sweeping towards Wang Xian like the tentacles of an octopus.

Every tailbone carried with it immense energy. As they clashed, sounds of explosions erupted and white fog was formed over the sky.

Hehe!

Seeing Lord Ossein attacking towards him, Wang Xian revealed a cold smirk.

The strength of Lord Ossein was indeed terrifying. Every tailbone could have the strength of a Dan Realm expert.

Moreover, Lord Ossein relied solely on the strength of the physical body, or simply, brute strength.

Nonetheless, one shouldn’t belittle brute strength. When strength reached a certain level, it would still be a terrifying thing.

“He actually forced our Lord Ossein to release all his strength. This brat can die now!”

Below them, the disciples of the Remains looked in admiration towards Lord Ossein after seeing their Lord Ossein waving his terrifying tailbones.
