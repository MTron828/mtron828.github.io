“Forefather, it’s right ahead, the race ahead.”

Within the Abyss, the 5,000 members of the world margin sect were enveloped in treasures. The world margin sect leader looked ahead and said to the two forefathers.

“HM, just as Protector Emperor said, three undying level 9 abyss seeds, we can easily destroy them.”

An elder looked over and said indifferently.

“Elder, the light robe that Protector Emperor gave us is extremely powerful, we can’t even detect the abyssal seeds at such a close distance.”

A warrior from the world’s end looked around and said in shock.

“HM, Protector Emperor isn’t bad, all disciples prepare to kill the millions of abyssal seeds in front of us, don’t let any of them escape.”

“We’ll deal with the Undying Emperor Level 8 and 9, the rest will be left to you, no casualties.”

The two forefathers stared ahead and ordered.

“It’s the forefathers!”

“Forefathers, killing these abyss seeds will be easy for us.”

“At most 3 minutes, kill all the abyss seeds.”

A group of warriors from the world margin sect said confidently.

They were all undying emperor level warriors, the elites of the world margin sect.

Even though this abyss species was strong, they could easily kill it.

“Kill!”

The two forefathers roared, locking onto the undying Emperor Level 9 and level 8 abyss species, rushing over.

The rest of the level 9 warriors locked onto the level 7 abyss species.

This battle, to the world margin sect, there was no suspense at all.

“Howl Howl Howl!”

The group of seeds saw the warriors rushing over and roared.

The three undying level 9 seeds in the lead felt the powerful danger, their faces filled with fear as they tried to escape.

However, with the two pinnacle god King warriors locking on to them, it was extremely difficult for them to escape.

“Kill!”

The group of world end experts charged over, their faces filled with wanton expressions.

They harvested large patches of abyssal seeds. The entire abyssal race was heading towards extinction at a terrifying speed.

“It’s time to go over.”

However, not far away, the two abyssal seeds moved and charged towards the battlefield.

“Eh, there’s a little bastard here.”

A woman quickly killed one abyssal seed after another. When she saw the abyssal seed flying towards her right, she was slightly stunned.

She waved her arm, and a sword light attacked towards that abyssal seed.

“Damn, this woman actually dared to attack me.”

“I originally wanted to parasitize a man, but since you attacked me, I’ll let you have a taste of parasitism.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The abyss seed saw the incoming blade and opened his mouth to mutter.

He moved and easily dodged the attack.

“HM? Isn’t this an undying level 1 abyss seed, to actually Dodge my attack, its reaction is pretty fast.”

The woman looked over in surprise, waving her arm and slashing out blade after blade.

“Peng!”

The sword light landed on the abyssal seed’s body, immediately piercing through it.

“Peng!”

However at this time, the abyssal seed’s body split open, a black liquid slashed through space, instantly entering the undying level 6 woman’s body.

At such a short distance, the woman didn’t even have time to react.

Her body stiffened, her eyes slowly turning black, the corners of her mouth curled up, looking terrifying.

“Ling Yu, Are You Alright?”

At this time, a middle aged man saw the lady floating in the air without moving, he was shocked, asking hurriedly.

“It’s alright husband, let’s kill these beasts together.”

Very quickly, the darkness in the lady’s eyes vanished, an evil charm flashed past, saying to the middle aged man.

“Alright, kill them!”

The middle-aged man did not sense any abnormalities and continued to hunt down the abyssal seeds in the surroundings.

“Vicious man, F * ck, parasitizing a female’s body. What a pervert. It seems that there’s still a gap between me and him.”

Not far away, an old man glanced over and muttered.

“Not bad, not bad. You have thirty percent of my elegance.”

From a distance away, Ba Qi saw this scene. The corner of his mouth curled up slightly. His body moved and he left quickly.

...

After parasitizing, the poisonous horned dragon seed could completely accept the other party’s memories. Ba Qi was confident that with the subordinates that he and Mo Sha had trained, even if it was a female, there would not be any flaws.

Ba Qi left, and a thorned dragon seed that was hiding in the surroundings also left immediately.

“Dragon King!”

Half an hour later, Ba Qi came before Wang Xian and shouted with a smile.

“Did you succeed?”

Wang Xian asked Ba Qi.

“Yes, Dragon King. One of my two subordinates is parasitizing a level 6 immortal king while the other is parasitizing a level 7 immortal king.”

“Furthermore, Dragon King, we can get information from them. We can also find opportunities to parasitize more experts of the world margin sect.”

Ba Qi said.

“Yes. Leave the matters in the Abyss to Mo Sha. You will deal with the matters in the world margin sect and strive to host the core powerhouses of the world margin sect who are at level eight immortal King Realm.”

Wang Xian thought for a moment and said, “If we can destroy the world margin sect, the resources we will gain will not be less than the resources in the Abyss.”

...

“Alright, Dragon King. Leave the situation in the world margin sect to me.”

Ba Qi nodded immediately.

They had only killed a few thousand immortal King Abyss seeds in the past month. However, there were still 60,000 to 70,000 immortal king powerhouses in the world margin sect.

There were also seven to eight level nine immortal king powerhouses.

After killing them, the Dragon Palace would also receive a huge upgrade.

“Okay.”

Wang Xian nodded and continued to upgrade the strength of the members of the poison making department.

“Hahaha, let’s go. We’ve won a great victory. Let’s go back.”

“After exchanging the merit points for the abyssal seeds that we’ve killed this time, our points will be higher than that poison nine.”

“I wonder what faction that Poison Nine is from. However, this time, we’re going to reach the top of the world.”

At the same time, in the Abyss, the members of the world’s end sect were cleaning up the corpses on the battlefield happily.

The harvest this time was not a small one for their great sect.

Another was that after they exchanged the abyss seeds for merit points, they could make the world margin great sect reach the top of the hero list.

This was also a propaganda for their world margin great sect.

“All Disciples, go back. This battle is very easy for us, but it might not be so easy from now on.”

“The battle in the Abyss is a crisis as well as an opportunity. I hope that our world margin great sect can give birth to another peak-stage godly king expert.”

A patriarch swept his gaze across everyone and said faintly.

“Patriarch, we will definitely work hard.”

“Become stronger and stronger. Exterminate the Dragon Palace and take revenge.”

“That’s right. Next, we will enter the Abyss and fight non-stop. We will hunt down abyssal seeds and quickly increase our strength. If we don’t succeed, we will die.”

The group of experts from the world’s end sect spoke, and the last sentence came from the middle-aged man parasitized by the members of the drug manufacturing department.
