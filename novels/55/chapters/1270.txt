Translator: 5496903

“What? Are You Afraid? Where’s the next person? Keke, I hope you won’t Be a coward!”

Sickle Blood’s voice rang out. He sat on the arena and stared coldly at the group of Heaven’s favorites. His triangular eyes locked onto the eighth-ranked Young Heaven’s favorite.

“Okay, okay. Let me kill you today and avenge Duan Qinghun!”

The eighth-ranked genius saw sickle blood’s provocative expression and felt everyone’s gaze on him. His face turned gloomy.

His body moved and he flew directly towards the center of the stage.

“Die!”

He didn’t hesitate at all. A staff appeared in his hand and a monstrous flame directly attacked sickle blood.

“Keke!”

Sickle blood let out a sinister cry, and with a light sweep of his scythe-like tails, a dark, scythe-like attack met the flame.

“Fury of the Earth Fire!”

The eighth chosen’s gaze was ice-cold, and his eyes were filled with solemnity. He gripped his staff with both hands, and scorching flames shot out from below, attacking sickle blood.

“You’re not my match either!”

Sickle blood let out a sharp sound, and just like before, black mist rose around it.

“HMPH, this move of yours is useless against me!”

The Eighth Heaven’s chosen’s expression was ice-cold as he stared at sickle blood. The resplendent staff in his hand emitted sparks of fire.

The Flames similarly enveloped an area of a thousand meters around him.

The dark space and the fiery red domain violently collided.

The Eighth Heaven’s chosen’s eyes were like torches as he stared at the dark space.

“Spark!”

With a loud roar, a spark-covered sky appeared in the sky above him. Countless sparks flew towards the dark space and attacked.

“Keke, darkness intersecting!”

Just as countless sparks flew towards the dark space, sickle blood’s voice suddenly came out from within and directly attacked the Eighth Heaven’s chosen.

“You’ve come out, right? Ring of Fire!”

The intense battle began. The Eighth Heaven’s chosen was much stronger than the Ninth Heaven’s chosen, so he could deal with sickle blood.

Soon, the two exchanged dozens of moves.

“Dark Fang!”

“Devil Shadow Body!”

Three minutes later, after they exchanged hundreds of moves, the Sickle Blood Demon Beast suddenly launched an attack.

This caused his expression to change drastically.

“Admit defeat and quickly retreat!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

An old man around the arena saw this scene and hurriedly shouted at the eighth chosen inside.

When he heard this voice, he didn’t hesitate at all and hurriedly fled out of the arena.

There were no judges in the blood flow sect’s chosen battles now. If one wanted to admit defeat, the only way was to flee the arena.

“Want to escape? Keke, it’s Too Late!”

At this moment, a sinister voice came from behind, causing his expression to change drastically.

His arm shook, and a pair of flaming wings quickly condensed behind him.

However, just as he was about to escape, his entire body stiffened slightly.

“Not good, it’s snake venom!”

The Eighth Heaven’s favorite’s expression changed drastically, and a look of panic appeared in his eyes.

“Die!”

At this moment, the sickle blood that was flying in the air and emitting a bloody smell flew over, and its two tails directly coiled around his body.

“No...”

The Eighth Heaven’s chosen’s expression was greatly shocked, and his face was filled with fear.

“Ah!”

A miserable cry sounded!

“Haha, this is the human’s heaven’s chosen. The Tenth Heaven’s Chosen of our demonic beast clan can also easily kill the eighth heaven’s chosen of your clan!”

“Trash, humans are indeed trash. Haha, one sickle blood can kill two of them, not to mention the rest of us!”

A sinister and brutal voice came from the demonic beasts, and their eyes were filled with mockery.

Seeing this scene, all the humans sighed, their faces extremely ugly.

The tenth chosen one of the Demonic Beast clan could kill the eighth ranked human. One could imagine how big the gap between them was.

“Haha, Delicious, Delicious. Come, come, let’s move on to the next one!”

Sickle Blood’s excited voice rang out. It raised its head and licked its snake lips as it looked disdainfully at all the humans in front of it.

“This... is simply not a match for us. We originally thought that this time, we humans would have the best chance of obtaining the supreme chosen. Who would have thought that this time, the gap would be even greater!”

“F * ck, this is simply a disgrace. I’m not watching anymore. I’m going back!”

The surrounding humans looked down with gloomy expressions. There were even some who flew out in anger.

“Let me do it. Do you really think that we’re afraid of You? !”

At this moment, Long Xiaochen, who was ranked seventh, flew over without the slightest hesitation. He also held a staff in his hand.

The staff of light was inlaid with a pearl of light.

He was dressed in pure white today and looked extremely holy.

“He’s the first Prince of the Light Dragon Dynasty. He should be able to defeat that arrogant beast!”

“So what if he’s defeated? Seventh Place defeating tenth place doesn’t have any honor at all!”

The crowd watched long Xiaochen enter the arena and discussed with a gloomy face.

“Keke!”

Sickle blood looked at the light staff in Long Xiaochen’s hand, and a trace of solemnity appeared in his eyes.

Light and darkness countered each other. He could feel the powerful power coming from the staff.

“Beast, I will definitely defeat you today!”

Long Xiaochen held the two-meter-long staff in his hand. He looked incomparably holy as he directly opened his mouth to judge.

“Other than trash, humans talk a lot of nonsense!”

Sickle blood shouted and directly rushed over.

The third battle began.

This battle, Long Xiaochen did not disappoint. After three minutes, he defeated sickle blood.

However, he did not manage to kill sickle blood.

“Hu!”

He took a deep breath and solemnly looked at sickle blood who had escaped from the arena. His face was slightly embarrassed.

His strength had always been somewhat hidden. It was in order to expose his powerful strength when he was fighting against the demonic beast clan and attract some subordinates who wanted to rely on him.

However, what he didn’t expect was that even the 10th ranked Heaven’s favorite still made him spend a lot of effort to defeat him.

“Keke, not bad, not bad. You’ve finally defeated one of our Demonic Beast’s Heaven’s favorites. Now, it’s My Turn!”

“Ghost Monkey Clan, 9th on the Heaven’s favorites list, double Feng Gui, come and experience this human’s strength!”

Just as the sickle was about to fall, a dark red ghost monkey jumped into the arena.

He stared at Long Xiaochen, his eyes full of brutal fighting spirit.

“I’ve consumed too much energy!”

Long Xiaochen looked at the ghost monkey and shook his head, his expression uncertain. His body moved and he flew out of the arena.

“Keke, Coward, cowardly human, you don’t even dare to accept my battle. Haha, Next, Get Up Here!”

The Ghost Monkey’s two-meter-long body stood on the arena. Its body was covered in black scales.

It had sharp claws that were half a meter long. Its mouth took up one-third of its head. It looked extremely ferocious!

“We demons are invincible. You humans will become our food one day!”

The ghost monkey stood in the ring and arrogantly looked down at all the humans in front of him, shouting loudly.
