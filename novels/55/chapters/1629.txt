Chapter 1630: 1630 was standing in the middle of the yin and yang poles with the five elements grinding on top of his head

“The vast area! Our Dragon and Phoenix Empire has provoked the vast area!”

“They are actually the experts of the vast area. Moreover, all of their experts have been mobilized. My God, how are we supposed to defend against them?”

“This isn’t a battle of the same level at all. The vast area!”

“It’s over, it’s over!”

The tens of millions of people behind the dragon-phoenix Empire heard their words and their faces instantly turned pale.

The vast region was also known as the upper region by the flowing sea region.

If the flowing sea region was a small village, then the vast region was a city.

The two were not on the same level in terms of level or number of experts.

If all the experts in the vast area came to destroy the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, how could they resist? Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“All the experts in the vast area get ready. Don’t leave a single one alive. I want nothing to grow here!”

The Supreme Sect Leader roared with a savage expression.

Only blood could be used to pay tribute to the people of their sect who had died.

“Die!”

The supreme sect leader raised his arm, and a palm that was ten kilometers wide appeared in the air.

In the eyes of everyone in the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, the enormous palm was like the anger of a god.

Everyone was shocked.

When had they ever seen such a terrifying attack?

Buzz

A red phoenix pattern appeared between Feng Luan’s eyebrows, and she waved the staff in her hand.

A firebird flapped its enormous wings and directly met the enormous palm.

“Come, destroy this bunch of trash!”

“Kill everyone from the Dragon and Phoenix Empire. Kill them all!”

“Hehehe, a bunch of trash. How dare they act so arrogantly in our vast area? Die!”

Under the Supreme Hierarch’s order, all the experts from the 120,000 corps instantly released a terrifying killing intent.

They all held weapons and charged forward.

“Members of the Dragon Palace, prepare to kill!”

Prime Minister GUI frowned and immediately ordered when he saw the situation.

...

“Ding! Congratulations to the host for merging the heart of Light and darkness and comprehending the Dharma Idol, yin-yang dual polarity!”

“Ding! Congratulations to the host for merging the five elements of light and darkness and evolving into a yin-yang Five Elements Dragon!”

“Ding! Congratulations to the host for mastering the seven elements of Light and darkness and comprehending the Dharma Idol, Yin-yang five elements alms bowl!”

“Ding! The light and dark five elements have fused. The light and dark fire dragon eyes have evolved into the yin-yang Five Elements Dragon Eyes!”

Outside the imperial city, at the instant when the war broke out, system notifications appeared in Wang Xian’s mind in the Dragon Pool in the Dragon Palace.

Wang Xian, who was lying quietly in the Dragon Palace, slowly opened his pair of dragon eyes.

One was Yin and the other was Yang. The five elements were circulating!

His pair of dragon eyes seemed to be able to illuminate the heavens!

His body was slowly floating above the dragon pool.

An incomparably huge Taiji diagram appeared below his body.

The Taiji diagram was about 200 meters in size.

One was light and the other was dark. In the area of light, there was a dark divine dragon entrenched. In the Dark Area, there was a light divine dragon entrenched.

The two divine dragons were lifelike!

“Phew, I’ve finally completely fused with them!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with excitement. The fusion of light and dark and the fusion of the five elements was much stronger than he had imagined.

“I’ve comprehended two types of dharma images!”

Wang Xian’s heart skipped a beat.

“The attributes have undergone a huge change. The supernatural powers, light and darkness, light and darkness are gone. The aspect of the Abyss Demon Dragon is also gone!”

“This is because the yin and Yang Bowl of the five elements can completely replace the supernatural powers and aspect!”

Wang Xian looked at his attributes and was very satisfied.

He was considered the first yin and Yang Dragon of the five elements in the history of the Divine Dragon Clan. He was a dragon of seven attributes.

There was a yin and a Yang in his eyes. There were five elements surrounding him.

As he felt the violent power in his body, Wang Xian felt that his strength had increased by at least one level.

“It took me more than eight months to resurrect this time. Guan Shuqing and the rest are worried. I didn’t even know to welcome them when I woke up!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. He moved his body and instantly appeared in the Dragon King’s Hall.

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

The clam girl in the Dragon King’s palace immediately greeted him respectfully.

“Eh? Where are the Dragon Queen and the rest? Where are the people from the Dragon Palace?”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the Dragon Palace. Under the eyes of the yin-yang and five elements dragon, there were not many members in the entire Dragon Palace.

“Reporting to the Dragon King, the experts from the vast region have come to attack the dragon and Phoenix Empire. The members of the Dragon Palace are currently...”

Before the clam girl could finish her sentence, Wang Xian suddenly lifted his dragon head. His yin and yang eyes seemed to be able to see through the void as he looked in the direction of the Dragon and Phoenix Imperial City.

“The solipsistic sect, the southern royal family, and the Wuji Empire. Good, good. is the entire force from the vast region here?”

As he swept his gaze across, a terrifying killing intent burst out from Wang Xian’s eyes.

Yin and yang circulated, and the five elements flowed.

His body disappeared instantly.

The control of yin and yang, teleportation!

The current strange demon possessed the dharma idol of teleportation.

It could teleport within a radius of ten kilometers.

And the current Wang Xian could teleport within a radius of twenty kilometers.

Furthermore, he could teleport twice consecutively. After that, he only needed ten minutes of rest.

Teleportation was originally the symbol of a powerhouse in the realm of longevity.

However, Wang Xian was the same as Xiao Lan. As one of the top bloodlines in the universe, they were able to possess such talent before reaching the realm of longevity.

After two teleportations, Wang Xian’s figure instantly appeared 40 kilometers away.

Following that, his dragon body flew at a terrifying speed.

“No matter what the reason is, I will make all of you pay a heavy price today!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with a terrifying killing intent.

“Kill!”

His eyes were staring straight ahead. The two cold pupils formed an illusory dragon eye of the Yin-yang five elements.

The two dragon eyes were each ten meters in size.

The clear pupils were emitting a dense and imposing aura.

The dragon eyes charged forward at an even more terrifying speed.

“Kill!”

On the battlefield, the Supreme Hierarch’s palm was defeated by Feng Luan.

The 120,000 experts of the vast area attacked the hundreds of thousands of soldiers of the dragon and Phoenix Empire and the members of the Dragon Palace with ferocious expressions.

The aura of absolute suppression made them look ferocious and excited.

“Let’s take action and finish them off as soon as possible!”

The three patriarchs of the Wuji Empire looked at each other and said indifferently.

“Okay!”

The three people nodded slowly.

“You are forcing me!”

When Feng Luan saw the six rank nine void interpretation experts preparing to attack, the flames in her eyes jumped.

“Roar!”

At this moment, a dragon roar was heard.

“What’s That?”

“Two eyes?”

Everyone looked over, and when they saw two 10-meter-long dragon eyes, they were slightly stunned.

“Vast area, are you here to die?”
