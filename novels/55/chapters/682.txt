Translator: 549690339

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

A terrifying explosion sounded, and the seawater was stirred up. The sky changed color.

The blue light, the fiery red light, and the earthen yellow light made this area seem like hell on Earth.

Any living creature within a seven to eight kilometer radius would be affected by the terrifying shockwaves.

The members of the Dragon Palace and Xiao Yu who were standing in the ocean were surrounded by a faint layer of gray energy.

The most terrifying part of the Kun was its defense. It relied on its terrifying physical body to travel the nine heavens and hunt down the top bloodline existences in the world.

Even though this Kun had only been nurtured for a few months, it was already beginning to show its prowess.

When the Kun reached level 13, its strength would receive another terrifying increase. At that time, it would even be comparable to Wang Xian.

A level 13 kun could fly in the sky.

At that time, a Kun that was more than 100 meters long would definitely be the most terrifying creature on Earth.

“Ah!”

At this moment, a shrill sound was heard.

Ao Jian’s terrifying sword passed through. Half of the snake’s body was split in half and fresh blood flowed into the sea uncontrollably.

The bright red blood contained a powerful energy.

On Ao Jian’s tail, there was a long wound.

“Roar!”

At this moment, a sky-shaking roar was heard. Ao qitian, who was covered in blood, raised the metal rod and smashed it at the snake with terrifying power and demonic qi.

Ao Qitian’s attack became even more violent and fierce under the condition of being injured!

As the metal rod smashed past, the snake’s expression changed drastically. Its tongue grew out again, stirring the air above it to form a water-blue defense.

The blue defense contained his blood, making the defense even more terrifying!

“Boom!”

As the metal rod smashed past, the blue defense quickly cracked.

“Stab!”

At this time, Ao Jian attacked again. The entire ten-meter-long sword body was completely restrained in golden light.

Not a single golden light was emitted. It was like a terrifying giant sword from ancient times!

“AH, no!”

The snake widened its eyes and looked at the restrained Golden Sword in horror.

“Pu!”

The long sword passed through and the snake’s body was completely split into two.

“Bang!”

Ao Qitian grabbed the upper half of the snake’s body with his terrifying palm and squeezed it hard.

A terrifying sound was heard once again.

“Kill the Immortals and slaughter the gods. There are still two more!”

Ao Qitian let out a violent sound. Without any hesitation, he attacked the flaming giant in front of Wang Xian.

Ao Jian was still in the shape of a sword. It was like a sharp sword that did not require control as it slashed towards the two-headed woman.

“You are seeking your own destruction. If you dare to fight with us, I will fight to the death to Keep You Alive!”

The red-masked elder’s expression changed drastically when he saw Ao Qitian’s attack. He roared furiously!

“Roar!”

What greeted him was ao Qitian’s terrifying metal rod and monstrous demonic aura!

“Roar!”

Wang Xian roared as well. His body circled in the water of the waterfall. Terrifying water dragons gathered around him and attacked the flaming giant directly.

“Damn it, you guys are courting death!”

The old man in the red mask had a gloomy look on his face. He was a little terrified.

However, he was more furious. Streaks of blood patterns gradually appeared on the flaming red mask.

Boom

The Flames intensified once again. The terrifying arms swung towards Wang Xian.

“One in front and one behind!”

Wang Xian circled around the old man in the red mask and arrived behind him. His dragon head turned red immediately. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He transformed into a flaming divine dragon.

“Roar!”

He opened his dragon mouth and bit towards the elder in the middle.

“Ah!”

The red-masked elder ignored Wang Xian completely. The violent flames smashed towards AO Qitian directly!

Ao qitian, who was already severely injured, hurriedly dodged to the side!

“Go to hell!”

When the red-masked elder saw ao Qitian dodging, he clawed with his arm. His arm, which was nearly twenty meters long, grabbed onto Wang Xian’s body.

“Hehe!”

In an instant, the flames on Wang Xian’s body intensified as well. His Dragon Claw clawed at the center of his body.

“Ah!”

The old man in the Red Mask had a look of fear on his face. Why did a water-type monster suddenly turn into a fire-type monster!

The Dragon Claw swung and broke his arm.

“AH, if you want to kill me, I won’t let you off easily either!”

Risk it all!

The red-masked old man was completely risking his life now. After knowing that there was a high chance of him dying here, he completely disregarded it.

If he risked his life, there was still a chance of escaping this place. If he didn’t risk his life, he would definitely die!

All the experts who could become immortals and deities had experienced thousands of battles of varying sizes. They had all fought their way out of the Sea of blood.

They did not lack courage and means. Even if they had to die, they had to be at the bottom.

“Qitian, you assist from the side. I will be the main attacker!”

Wang Xian reminded Ao Qitian.

It was obvious that the red-masked elder wanted to risk his life for AO qitian.

If Ao Qitian died again, he might die permanently.

The revival of the soul-returning wood was not unlimited. It had to meet various conditions.

For example, AO qitian had just been revived. If he was killed again, even the soul-returning wood would not be able to revive him.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao qitian also realized this and did not focus on attacking. He stared at the flame giant with his eyes full of demonic flames.

“A bunch of lunatics, you bunch of Lunatics!”

At this moment, Yanmei’s two-headed shriek came from the side.

Prime Minister Gui alone was equal to her. Now, Ao Jian, who had terrifying attack power, came. In just a minute, wounds appeared on her body.

“Since we’re going to die, Let’s die together!”

Yanmei’s two-headed head emitted a deathly aura. Earthy yellow energy split out from the center of the two heads.

“Ahhhhh!”

Horrifying screams rang out as the two heads actually tore apart their own bodies. The earthen yellow earth energy formed the other half of their bodies.

In an instant, they charged towards Ao Jian and Prime Minister Gui desperately.

“He’s consuming his life force. Let’s consume her to death!”!

Prime Minister Gui waved his arm, and a huge earthen yellow cage directly trapped her inside. However, it did not even last a second before it was torn apart.

However, Prime Minister Gui was not in a hurry. This move of hers had caused a lot of damage to his body!

Splitting his head and body in half, even an immortal would not be able to hold on for long.

The intense battle began!

Even Wang Xian, who was facing the red-masked elder, had many bloody wounds on his body. A large amount of fresh blood spilled into the sea and pieces of dragon scales fell into the sea.

However, in comparison, the old man in the red mask and the two-headed woman were even more miserable.

“I feel like my body is boiling and my blood is burning. hahaha!”

“Keke, don’t be careless. Don’t be careless. We can only hold on for one minute with the Royal Heaven Formation. We must kill them all within one minute. Otherwise, we will miss our chance!”

“Don’t worry. I only want the Divine Dragon!”

“Then leave the rest to me!”

A cold voice sounded from another dimension!
