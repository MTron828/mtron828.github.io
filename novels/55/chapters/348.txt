Chapter 349: Two Treasures

“There’s more than one eyeing the treasures which he has on hand!” Bian Yaoquan jeered as he swept his gaze across coldly.

The Elders looked over with hesitation. “How do we allocate the treasures with the outsiders?” they asked.

“We’ll give them enough Elixir Pills after we inform them prior. I believe they’ll agree to it!” Bian Yaoquan replied.

As he spoke, he lifted his head slightly, before glaring at Wang Xian and Sun Lingxiu with bloodthirst in his eyes. “I want that fellow dead. I want that bitch pleading for mercy while kneeling between my legs!” he snapped with a grimace.

As they looked at Bian Yaoquan, the Poison Duo hesitated briefly as their hearts stirred, before nodding in agreement.

“Leave this matter to us!” the Poison Duo replied. As they spoke, they looked across at the crowd before making their way towards them.

...

The National Treasury was located in Shang Jing. Wang Xian and the rest flew over to Shang Jing in the military helicopter, and arrived at the military airport by evening.

“Please follow me!” a stern drill instructor said to them while he led the way.

The trio boarded a military Jeep with the drill instructor, and together they drove towards the Palace in Shang Jing.

Upon arrival at the main entrance of the Palace, two gatekeepers handed four eye masks to the quartet. “Put on the eye masks!” they ordered.

Including the drill instructor who had fetched them over, everyone complied.

Upon receiving the eye masks, Wang Xian and group tied them over their eyes, and began to make their way inside under the directions of two soldiers.

Eye masks were useless on Wang Xian.

They kept walking inwards, and made countless turns, and after many rounds of checks conducted by numerous personnel, the group finally arrived at their last location within the Palace.

Over here was a small mountain.

Constant roars could be heard from the small mountain. In front of the mountain was a boulder, which Wang Xian could clearly see split open, opening up to a staircase which descended to the underground.

“How stringent,” Wang Xian exclaimed. The National Treasury was after all, situated in Shang Jing, which was backed by the strongest military manpower. Furthermore, it was located within the Palace.

It was literally impossible for anyone to attempt to trespass.

“Remove the eye masks, and hand them to me!” a voice could be heard from beneath them.

As Wang Xian and the rest followed suit, they looked down the stairs.

A scholarly and poised Elder dressed in Tang Suit welcomed Wang Xian and the rest with a gentle smile. [1]

“You’ve got only two Gold Medallions, so you can only choose two pieces of treasures!” the Elder explained. To which, he continued, “Follow me!”

Wang Xian and the rest nodded, and together they entered with curiosity.

“Is there anything which you have in mind?” the Elder asked amiably as he led the way ahead.

“Elder, are there any Alchemy Furnaces in the National Treasury?” Wang Xian asked straightforwardly. His main purpose this time was to get into the National Treasury to lay hands on one!

“An Alchemy Furnace? Young man, are you an alchemist?” the Elder asked out of curiosity, while he paused briefly and turned his head over to face Wang Xian.

“Yes,” Wang Xian answered with a nod.

“How regretful, we’ve run out of Alchemy Furnaces. The last one’s been taken by the Medical Saint Sect!” the Elder explained as he shook his head lightly.

“Alchemy Furnaces are few to begin with. There were previously three in the National Treasury, but they have since been taken by the Medical Saint Sect and the Medical Tripod Mountain Sect,” the Elder continued.

“All taken?” Wang Xian quizzed. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Not exactly taken. But traded in exchange using Elixir Pills, ha-ha!” the Elder laughed. “If there’s anything else you have in mind, I can bring you over directly. That’ll speed things up!” he added.

Wang Xian furrowed his brows. To think there were no Alchemy Furnaces at the National Treasury.

“The Secret Manual of the Art of Cultivation, Elixir Pill recipes, Weapons, Spiritual Stones, and cash!” the Elder listed. With a laugh, he continued, “This Gold Medallion is worth twenty billion dollars. Haha! That’s two thousand Spiritual Stones!”

“We’ll look around ourselves!” Wang Xian acknowledged with a nod.

“Sure, but no browsing of the Secret Elixir Pill recipes. As for the rest, help yourselves!” the Elder said before they went down the last flight of stairs and arrived at a huge space.

Wang Xian and group were shocked by the sight before them.

“My, oh my, this place is a gold mountain!” the Miracle Doctor Blood Man gasped as he peered inside with glowing eyes.

Up ahead was a massive area measuring a radius of two kilometers. It held objects of all sorts, where each and every one of them shone in shimmering light.

“Not that many per se. Many of our nation’s treasures have been snatched by some of the international forces!” the Elder shook his head with a tinge of dismay in his eyes.

“True. Thirty years ago, major international forces treated this place as a treasure trove. They went on a mad spree, looting all sorts of valuable resources from here. Spiritual Medicine, weapons, relics ... Had it not been for the emergence of the Guardian Divine Beasts... Tsk tsk!” the Miracle Doctor Blood Man said dryly, clearly aware of some of the history.

“The Guardian Divine Beasts?” Wang Xian asked.

“That’s a Nation-guarding Divine Beast!” the Elder emphasized as he stuck his chest out, beaming with a sense of pride.

“The world’s most formidable, the Nation-guarding Divine Beast!” the Miracle Doctor Blood Man called out, slightly spooked, as he recalled the legends.

“The Nation-guarding Divine Beasts,” Wang Xian uttered under his breath, but did not question further, as he continued to survey the surroundings.

“The Secret Manual of the Art of Cultivation’s over there, while this is the Weaponry area. The Elixir-related items are over here along with some miscellaneous pieces. Take your pick over here!” the Elder said to them in a bid to digress from the earlier topic.

Wang Xian nodded in acknowledgment and stepped forward.

As he swept his gaze across, several messages popped up continually in his head.

[Space-shattering Sword: Level 9]

[Giant Watchtower Sword: Level 10]

[Huyang Blade: Level 8]

...

Weapons of varied levels were hanging within a crate, along with Inborn Spiritual Weapons of Level 8 to 9.

“It’s no doubt the National Treasury, there’re so many treasures in here!” Wang Xian exclaimed. He was uninterested in the weapons, and harbored few intentions with the Secret Manual of the Art of Cultivation. Thus he made his way over to the area of Elixir-related items.

There were no Elixir Pills in the area, but only Elixir Pill recipes and manuals on the Art of Refining Elixir Pills.

As Wang Xian scanned past, he realized that the area held less Elixir Pill recipes than Sui Huang’s, while he knew many of the ones here.

“Huh? A Flame Bead!” Wang Xian called out. He was on his way out of a messier storage area, when he caught sight of the object which was encased in a crystal.

[Barraging Blaze Ball: Level 10]

“A Level 10 Flame Bead,” Wang Xian said in excitement. His current Dragon Ball had peaked at Level 10. It would take him several years of cultivation before it could upgrade to Level 11.

Yet, by absorbing this Barraging Blaze Bead, his Dragon Ball would ascend to Level 11 immediately.

Once the Dragon Ball reached Level 11, it could transform into an Inferno Divine Dragon, killing Inborn experts and dealing with Dan Realm experts with ease.

“I’m taking this Flame Bead!” Wang Xian decided. Stretching out his hand, he grabbed onto the Flame Bead.

“One more item to go!” the Elder said casually as he stood at a side. The Flame Bead was an extremely precious treasure. When acquired, it could help an Inborn expert of the Fire element to double their combat abilities.

Wang Xian nodded as he glanced ahead at the voluminous objects.

Strange-looking stones, shimmering bangles, rings, bizarre robot puppets, and wares of all sorts.

A look across, and one could see many items with powers of Level 7 to 8, even up to Level 9.

Especially the strange-looking human stone sculpture, which was, in fact, a Level 9 ancient war marionette.

Zing, zing!

Just then, an unexplained force of attraction came surging over, and Wang Xian felt something inside of him tugging.

He looked over, slightly taken aback.

[Soul-Returning Branch: Level 9]
