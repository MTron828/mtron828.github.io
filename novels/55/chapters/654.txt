Chapter 655: Get Out Of The Territory Of China (1)

“All of you are citizens of my Dragon Palace. To the countless living creatures, I, the Dragon King, will be preaching Dao today to kickstart and enlighten your path towards cultivation!”

A voice with a majestic aura entered the minds of every marine animal in the sea.

The divine dragon was the King of the marine races. He could understand any languages of marine animals. At the same time, his words could reach the minds of every single type of marine race.

This was the powerful talent of the divine dragon race.

This was also a terrifying ability of the ruler of the marine animals.

Around them, billions of marine animals shivered. They looked towards Wang Xian and felt respect and fear that originated from their very core.

Wang Xian rested his body against Xiao Lan. The huge seventy-meter Kun hovered in the water without moving an inch.

This scene made countless marine animals even more fearful and respectful towards the Dragon King.

“The cultivation path of marine animals starts with absorbing the spiritual energy within heaven and earth. Today, I’ll impart all of you with the path of cultivation!”

Wang Xian’s voice entered the minds of each and every marine animal.

This group of billions of marine animals couldn’t understand what Wang Xian was preaching. Only a very vague concept lingered in their minds.

Wang Xian couldn’t do anything about it at all. However, all he was trying was to place a seed within the billions of marine animals.

This seed would gradually germinate as they grew stronger and eventually reaped the rewards.

For the cultivation arts of the marine animals, Wang Xian imparted upon them the simplest way of absorbing spiritual energy.

Absorbing spiritual energy from heaven and earth and digesting spiritual energy.

Wang Xian had only imparted these two methods. Despite wanting to achieve more, imparting too many methods might overwhelm these fishes which did not possess intelligence yet and wouldn’t be able to memorize most of these methods.

He spoke really slowly. With just a thought, image after image appeared within the minds of various marine animals.

Billions of marine animals remained stationary and silent. Some marine animals even closed their eyes.

It was especially so for dolphins, tiger whales, and other marine animals who had relatively higher intelligence. They were trying to memorize and understand deeper.

“The preaching of Dao will end here for today. The next session will be announced by the Dragon Palace again. If you wish to become stronger and become a true ruler, cultivate diligently!”

Wang Xian said slowly, “My citizens, you are dismissed!”

Whoosh!

When Wang Xian finished his last sentence, the marine animals at the edges moved and swam away.

Sea turtles, sea snakes, fish, sea leopards, sea horses, and others left rapidly in an orderly manner!

“I wonder how many marine animals among the billions could cultivate, become experts of the marine races and leap through the dragon gate!” Wang Xian mumbled to himself.

He moved and entered the Dragon Palace.

Now that the seed had been planted, they had to rely on their own encounters.,

Since he had started on his first session of preaching Dao, Wang Xian was prepared to host more sessions at regular intervals. At the same time, he could check on the progress of evolution for these marine animals.

“Xiao Xian, has it ended?” Seeing Wang Xian flying over, Lan Qingyue asked.

“Yeah. I’m done. Let’s head back to China!” Wang Xian nodded his head and said to the girls.

“Alright!”

The five girls nodded their heads happily. Xiao Yu even clenched her fists excitedly and said, “I’m going to occupy an entire mountain for my Thistles and Thorns Sect.”

“All hail the Queen of the Thistles and Thorns Sect!”

Lan Qingyue and the girls chuckled and flew away.

Roving Sword didn’t follow this time. He was heading towards the disordered region with Roving Heavens to suppress the Manta Ray King.

The Dragon Palace wanted the entire disordered region to be under its control.

That would be a relatively more important piece of land for the Dragon Palace to obtain resources.

“Let’s go!”

Xiao Yu and the rest stood at the top deck of the yacht. They extended their arms in excitement as the yacht steered towards Rivertown.

Mt. Taibai was the separation line for Northern and Southern China. It lay in the central region of China.

This was also the largest mountain range in China. As for Mt. Taibai, it was also one of the most well-known mountains in all of China.

Mt. Taibai was an exceptionally famous scenic spot.

At this moment, the entire Mt. Taibai was just like an immortal region.

From a long distance away, one could see spiritual energy flowing down like a waterfall. Below it, a dozen-odd mountain peaks were shrouded within the spiritual energy.

Among them, the tallest peak also had the densest concentration of spiritual energy. Spiritual energy entered the mountain range as though it was water.

Around the base of these mountains, countless martial artists sat on the ground and were absorbing spiritual energy frantically.

Spiritual energy could cleanse one’s channels and meridians. When immersed in such terrifyingly dense spiritual energy, it wouldn’t take more than five days for a Level 9 martial artist to reach the Inborn Realm.

As for Inborn experts, they would be able to reach the Dan Realm within one to two months under the cleansing of the terrifyingly dense spiritual energy.

Ordinary martial artists could cleanse the impurities within their bodies simply by being below it.

Chance encounter! A terrifyingly insane chance encounter.

For the majority of martial artists in the Underworld, this was definitely the greatest chance encounter they could possibly have.

Yet, at this very moment, over ten thousand people had gathered on a mountain beside Mt. Taibai.

All the martial artists in the entire Underworld had gathered. There were even some wealthy moguls who had come. The group looked extremely gloomy.

“Those groups of bastards occupied each mountain and didn’t allow us to get close. For those who can’t occupy a mountain, they still prohibited us from going over. They should know that they are in the territory of China!”

“What should we do? Dear Laozus from various Sacred Clans and Sects, are we just going to watch them occupy this bountiful land and seize resources that belong to us?”

“They killed several dozens of my Qingfeng Sect just because of a dispute and humiliated our female disciples. Dear Laozus from various Sacred Clans and Sects, you’ve got to teach them a lesson for us!”

Beside the mountain, various martial artists of the Underworld remarked furiously and sorrowfully as they looked at the Laozus from their Sacred Clans and Sects.

“Haiz. The difference in strength between them and us is truly too huge. We aren’t a match for them at all. They are simply too strong for us!”

An old man from Reeds Spirits of Diabolism pulled a long face and heaved a sigh.

Currently, there were only three remaining Sacred Clans in the Underworld: Sui Clan, Xiao Clan, and Gu Clan. Qiao Clan and Donghua Clan had been annihilated by the Dragon King.

As for Sacred Sects, it was even more pathetic. Only the Sacred Followers Guild, Imperial Beast Sect, Sacred Seas of Swords and Reeds Spirits of Diabolism still existed.

As for the remaining Sacred Sects and powerful sects under Diabolism, they were all annihilated by the Dragon Sect.

Reeds Spirits were the strongest among them with three Dan Realm experts. As for the rest, they only had one each.

However, Imperial Beast Sect and Sacred Seas of Swords weren’t here and the Guild Leader of the Sacred Followers Guild wasn’t here either.

There was only a total of five Dan Realm experts. This was because the Gu Clan was annihilated by a force from overseas two days before. The Dan Realm expert from Gu Clan was killed by a single strike.

When the Gu Clan was annihilated and the Dan Realm expert was killed, all the martial artists in the Underworld were shocked. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

When various overseas forces looked down from above, all of them could only retreat from that place.

They didn’t dare to make any retaliation. If they were to say a single “no,” they would be killed on the spot.

Several overseas forces even mocked them as the sick man of Asia. Yet, all they could do was to endure the mockery!
