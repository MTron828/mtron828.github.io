Chapter 1329: 1330, I am the founder of the Frost sect

Under the watchful eyes of the masses, above the island of the Light Dragon Dynasty.

A two-thousand-meter deep and terrifying blue iceberg!

A dark and terrifying black giant millstone!

The sect master of the Frost sect was standing above the iceberg while the Nameless Sword Demon King Immortal was below the giant millstone.

The two extremely terrifying powers slowly began to collide.

“This...”

“Brother Wang Xian, you must be careful!”

Everyone watched the confrontation between the two top-notch experts in shock. Long Xiaotian revealed a worried look on his face.

“They are going to collide!”

Everyone in the surroundings stared at them intently.

The two gigantic creatures were colliding slowly.

Boom

When the two terrifying powers collided, an earth-shattering sound reverberated through the sky.

Ice Sparks flew in all directions. It was as though an iceberg in the ocean had collapsed. It was as though the world was coming to an end.

The sound spread across a radius of dozens of kilometers.

The people who were located in other parts of the tomb of the demi-human stopped at this moment. They looked at the location of the island of the Radiant Dragon Empire in shock.

“Collapse!”

Wang Xian floated below the five elements millstone. He stared at the iceberg coldly.

The speed of the entire five elements millstone suddenly increased, and its speed increased by several times.

Crack! Crack! Crack

The sound of the millstone collapsing could be heard. The Five Elements Millstone was like a holy object that could flow in the long river of time. It could destroy any object.

The iceberg was melting bit by bit.

“Not good?”

Sect Master Han Zong’s expression changed drastically when he saw his dharma idol collapsing below.

“Ice Seal, defense and Attack!”

He felt the five elements millstone that was attacking his body. It was an energy that could destroy everything.

He quickly crossed the Longsword and staff in his hand.

A thousand-meter-long ice arrow shot toward the five elements millstone.

A blue protective shield surrounded it.

“Boom!”

The thousand-meter-long ice arrow hit the five elements millstone, making a sound.

However, it didn’t leave any traces on it.

“What kind of attack is this? How can it be so terrifying?”

The sect master of the frigid sect had a drastic change in expression. He moved his body slightly and wanted to hide far away to launch a long-range attack.

“Five elements millstone, seal!”

Wang Xian stared at the sect master of the frigid sect in front of him. His gaze was slightly focused.

Buzz

The entire five elements millstone trembled slightly. A chaotic force covered the sect master of the frigid sect.

The speed of the force was so fast that everyone was shocked.

The chaotic force covered an area of 2,000 meters and instantly surrounded sect master Han.

Soon after, this force began to change.

The earth element immediately covered it, followed by the water element, golden light shield, wood coil, and fire chain.

In an instant, it directly wrapped around sect master Han.

“Oh no, how can he be so strong!”

Feeling the five elements seal within a 2,000 meter radius, sect leader Han Zong’s face was filled with shock.

“Dharma Idol, zero degrees of the world!”

He shouted in panic, and the surrounding space began to freeze. The entire sky was clearly covered in frost.

The Sky began to rain ice.

Then, zero degrees of the world did not resist the seal of the five elements grinding. In fact, the water energy contained within zero degrees of the world doubled the binding of the water energy.

Crack! Crack! Crack

One after another, the blockade gradually restrained sect master Han completely.

“What... i... Nameless sword demon Wang Xian is completely in the upper hand!”

“Sect master Han is actually sealed. Wang Xian’s strength is so terrifying!”

“So terrifying, so terrifying. He’s 26 years old? I don’t believe it!”

Everyone in the surroundings widened their eyes when they saw Wang Xian completely suppressing sect master Han.

The sect master of the cold sect was a top-notch expert who had lived for more than two thousand years. Now, he was actually defeated by a 26-year-old young man.

Was this the strength of a Supreme Heaven’s pride expert?

Was this the terror of the nameless sword demon Wang Xian?

“This... this... We must not let him live. We must not let him Live!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Long Xiaoyun’s eyes flickered when he saw Wang Xian’s terrifying strength.

He must kill him. If he was killed, he would become the strongest heaven’s pride expert in the flowing sea region.

He had to kill him!

“Die, explode!”

Wang Xian looked at the leader of the Frost sect who was completely surrounded and shouted softly.

Boom

A mushroom cloud appeared in the entire sky!

“No Way, the leader of the Frost sect is going to be killed!”

“This...”

“Oh my God, could it be that an expert at level four of the Seethrough void stage is going to be killed by Wang Xian?”

The mushroom cloud shook the sky and everyone felt the space tremble violently. Everyone opened their mouths slightly.

However, at this moment, Wang Xian’s pupils contracted slightly. He stared calmly at the figure that suddenly appeared in the middle of the explosion.

“That is!”

At this moment, the King of the Light Dragon Empire who had been sitting calmly on the stage suddenly stood up. His face was filled with shock as he stared at the thin figure that suddenly appeared in the middle of the explosion.

“Kill him! Kill him for me! He must die!”

Long Xiaoyun’s furious Roar suddenly rang out.

“Eh? Is Long Xiaoyun crazy? Even the sect master of cold sect was killed by the Nameless Sword Demon King Immortal!”

“Yeah, maybe he can’t believe the reality before his eyes!”

“But no matter what, the eighth Prince’s strength and influence are not something the second prince can compare to. The position of crown prince is still his!”

When the surrounding people heard the eighth Prince’s sudden roar, they were slightly stunned.

Everything that had happened today had shocked them too much.

The eighth Prince’s powerful return, his strength at the third level of the profound void tier.

The true identity of the Nameless Sword Demon, the peerless battle between the nameless sword demon and sect master Han Zong.

Every single one of them could make them talk for a very, very long time.

“Eh? Look, there’s an extra person in the center of the explosion!”

“What’s that? What’s that situation!”

Just as everyone slowly recovered from their shock, another shocking voice sounded.

Everyone looked over once again, their pupils slightly constricting as they sucked in a breath of cold air.

In the middle of the explosion, there was an extra person, a thin and weak figure.

Beside this figure, the somewhat disheveled sect master Han Zong was bowing towards that figure to express his gratitude!

What was going on?

What the hell was going on?

Everyone felt their scalps go numb.

They thought of the eighth Prince’s roar just now. Could it be that another peerless expert had appeared and was even stronger than the sect master of the frigid sect?

“This time, the position of crown prince will be inherited by the eighth prince, Xiao Yun. Today’s matter shall end here!”

At this moment, the king of the Radiant Dragon Empire who stood up could no longer sit still and announced loudly.

“Father, it’s not over yet. It will only be over after I kill that Wang Xian. Please don’t interfere, Father!”

Long Xiaoyun’s expression changed slightly when he heard his father’s voice.

However, he did not show the slightest fear as he bowed and spoke to his father.

He had the right to do so.

Because that figure was an existence at the fifth level of the Seethrough Void Tier.

His father was also only at the fifth level of the profound void tier.

“I am Bing Hanzi, the founder of the cold sect. I was trapped in the Origin Light Dragon Pond and saved by the young master. I will kill the person that the young master wants to kill!”

A voice without any emotion was heard in the air that was slowly dissipating and exploding!
