Chapter 624: Return of the Dragon King (5)

“It’s over. It’s definitely over now!”

“The Dragon Sect is going to be annihilated now!”

“It’s finally over. The Dragon Sect is too strong! Even with the four old men with Immortal-like strength, they still managed to kill over a hundred Inborn experts from our side. This is insane!”

“Tsk! The Dragon Sect would never have expected our side to have four Immortal-like existences! With the four old men on our side, the Underworld will be Eternal Sacred Sect’s in the future!”

Around the battlefield, martial artists that were below the Inborn Realm were shocked and exhilarated to see members of the Dragon Sect being killed one after another.

After annihilating the Dragon Sect, they would be the rulers of the Underworld in the future.

The battle had also caused a huge ruckus on the Underworld website.

It was especially so for the terrifying strength of the four old men. The scenes of those thousand-meter-tall fire pillars and the destruction of the mountains with a wave of their arms had made everyone feel they were exceptionally minuscule in this world.

Even those from the Sacred Clans and Sacred Sects were astonished and fearful.

“Insane! Those four old men are too terrifying. Are they the Immortals recorded in history? It seems like the entire Underworld will be Eternal Sacred Sect’s after today!”

“Haiz! They aren’t something we could possibly resist. After this battle, let’s surrender to them!”

“Their strength is probably equivalent to those powerful forces internationally. This is insane. The Underworld is going to be unified!”

“Before the four old men, those so-called Sacred Sects are just ants that could be annihilated with a wave of their arms. It’s not surprising that Sect Leader Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi are willing to surrender and join the Eternal Sacred Sect!”

“After this major battle, let’s surrender to them too!”

“Even if the Dragon King is still around, he’s still going to be killed if he faces the four old men. There’s nothing to change the current situation now. Just prepare to surrender!” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

When all the forces of the Underworld witnessed what happened, they gasped in awe.

All the forces had decided and prepared to surrender after this battle.

This was because the strength displayed by the four old men wasn’t something they could possibly hope to resist.

“I recall that some families in Rivertown are firm supporters of the Dragon Sect. In that case, let’s annihilate those people to express our loyalty!”

Some first-class and second-class forces had made up their minds.

The annihilation of the Dragon Sect had been cast in stone. Similarly, the unification of the Underworld had also been cast in stone.

At this moment, what they should do was get on the good books of Eternal Sacred Sect. In fact, it would be even better if they could join and become a subsidiary sect.

“Go!”

Several families moved rapidly. They wanted to express their loyalty and sincerity as much as they could before the Dragon Sect was annihilated.

“Bring these girls back for interrogation!”

The Dragon Sect had suffered catastrophic losses. Only thirty to forty dragonians remained standing on the floating island.

An old man stood in the air and looked down on them with a sense of superiority. His eyes landed on Xiao Yu, Adjaya, Guan Shuqing, and the other three girls as he remarked with anticipation.

“Yes! Your Excellency. Leave them to us!”

The crowd from Diabolism revealed vile smiles as they stared at Xiao Yu and the other girls.

“Hehe! The girls of the Dragon King! I’m getting excited at just the thought of it!”

A middle-aged man with a long tongue licked his lips as he walked towards the girls with contempt.

“Be careful of those two girls!” an old man reminded.

“It’s going to be fine. With Your Excellency here, we will be fine!” The middle-aged man smiled.

The two leaders from Crimson Bug grinned creepily as they stared at Xiao Yu and the girls.

“Capture us? Forget about it! You aren’t going to capture us even if we die!”

Xiao Yu, Guan Shuqing and the other girls revealed determined looks.

“Get closer to me! Get ready!”

Adjaya held onto the truncheon in her hands tightly and spoke softly to Xiao Yu and the other girls.

Xiao Yu, Elder Fang, Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue, and Sun Lingxue moved slowly towards Adjaya.

“We are going to have some fun ourselves after capturing them! Hehe! The girls of the Dragon King!”

The middle-aged man with the long tongue made a weird sound before charging ahead!

“Kill!”

When Mo Qinglong and the remaining dragonians saw them, they flapped their wings violently and charged towards them.

“Ants!”

Seeing that the dragonians were still resisting, the truncheon in the hands of the old man glowed dazzlingly. A huge cage appeared in the sky and swooped down.

Sss!

Mo Qinglong and the other dragonians lifted their heads and felt helpless.

“A futile struggle!”

When the surrounding crowd saw the flaming cage descending from the sky, they were deeply impressed and remarked excitedly.

“Let’s go!”

Adjaya’s hands shook when she saw the four old men attacking.

Gradually, fresh blood flowed out from her arm and towards the truncheon.

A ring of fire appeared and surrounded the six of them.

“Adjaya!”

Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue, and Sun Lingxiu were flustered to see fresh blood gushing out from Adjaya’s arm.

“Don’t leave the defensive circle!”

Adjaya remarked with a pale face. She pulled a long face and continued, “Go!”

The next instant, Adjaya spat a mouthful of fresh blood on the truncheon. The surrounding ring of fire started circulating at a terrifying speed.

“Huh? Escaping?”

When the four old men saw the actions of Adjaya, they smirked. “Will we let you escape?”

“Flaming Cell!”

An old man lifted his truncheon and pointed in the direction that Adjaya and the rest were escaping towards.

Weng!

A huge Flaming Cell appeared once again. Although it wasn’t as powerful as the Pyro Cell, it still emitted heart-wrenching might.

“Move away!”

Guan Shuqing was infuriated. Her face was flushed as she raised the Fire God Lotus truncheon and released scorching hot fireballs.

However, the fireballs did not have much effect when they landed on the Flaming Cell.

“He won’t be able to stop us!” Adjaya remarked anxiously. The ring of fire turned even more rapidly and flew towards the sky.

Bam! Bam! Bam!

When the ring of fire contacted the Flaming Cell, intense collisions gradually created cracks in the cell!

“If you could escape from the four of us, we would have lived our lives in vain!”

Ruthlessness flashed across the eyes of an old man when he saw the collapsing Flaming Cell.

“Heaven and Earth. Flaming Cell!”

“Heaven and Earth. Flaming Cell!”

...

Beside the old man, the other three old men shouted. Streams of fire shot across the sky and formed an even more terrifying Flaming Cell.

Adjaya was astonished to see the Flaming Cell from all directions. She spat another mouthful of fresh blood on her truncheon once again!

“Let me teach you all a lesson first!”

An old man waved his arm and a flaming long spear was thrown towards Adjaya at an incredible speed.

Adjaya who was manipulating the truncheon was caught by surprise.

“Let me stop it!”

Guan Shuqing moved to stand before Adjaya instantly when she saw the approaching flaming long spear.

“No! Sister-in-law, you are too weak now! My defense is stronger!”

Xiao Yu wanted to push Guan Shuqin away.

“Xiao Yu, you are already injured. Leave this to me! I have the essence blood of a Suzaku. Perhaps I can reach nirvana. Perhaps I can be reborn with even greater strength. Otherwise, it would be hard for us to escape this time!”

Guan Shuqing was resolute. Feeling the scorching hot attack, she grimaced and placed both arms before her.

“Futile attempt!”

Seeing Guan Shuqing trying to stop the attack, contempt flashed across the eyes of the four old men.

Pfft!

The red flaming long spear easily pierced through Guan Shuqing’s defense and penetrated her body.

The girls around Guan Shuqing were filled with despair. Sun Lingxiu instantly injected streams of Light Energy into her body.

“Please! Let me reach the state of nirvana!”

A teardrop flowed out of Guan Shuqing’s eyes. Feeling the vitality leaving her body, she mumbled to herself.

“NO...”

At this moment, a frenzied roar reverberated across!
