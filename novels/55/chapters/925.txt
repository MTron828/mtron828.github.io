Chapter 926: 0927 killing you was like killing an ant

Translator: 549690339

“However, if I want to kill you, it’s like killing an ant!”

Dao Hen turned his head and looked at the black-horned seahorse in front of him. A hint of contempt flashed in his eyes. “Be careful this time!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

He reminded his subordinates around him.

“It’s the leader!”

A rank 6 transcendent died in the group. They couldn’t afford to be careless.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The battle began. The sky-piercing arrow on the city wall, the city guards in the sky, and all the experts of the holy sea town all attacked.

In the sky, all kinds of fireballs, wind blades, and lightning covered the sky and covered the earth.

Wang Xian brandished the fire sword in his hand. With the increase in his level, the level 3 supernatural realm beasts did not dare to attack him.

If it was not too shocking, he could even float in the air and the hundreds of thousands of level-two and level-three supernatural beasts would listen to his commands.

Controlling the level-two and level-three supernatural beasts, Wang Xian’s strength alone was comparable to the hundreds of thousands of city guards and mercenaries.

Even so, Wang Xian’s killing speed was not slower than the level-seven sword mark.

The sounds of slaughter and screams of agony could be heard continuously.

In fact, at one corner of the city wall, thousands of black-horned seahorses rushed to the bottom of the city wall and crashed heavily into it.

A huge hole was created from the impact.

Some black-horned seahorses even flew to the top of the city wall. The terrifying black-horned seahorses penetrated through the corpses of the mercenary groups.

The third wave of attacks was obviously much more devastating than the first two waves.

However, this didn’t have much of an impact on Wang Xian.

After his strength had increased once again, even if he didn’t transform into a divine dragon, he was still able to fight against ferocious beasts of level six transcendence.

Most of these ferocious beasts were below level five transcendence. They were no match for him at all.

Half an hour had passed. There were around one to two thousand ferocious beasts that had died at the hands of Wang Xian.

There was a powerhouse of level nine transcendence like Jin Qian Yuan in the holy sea town. Although there were still losses, not a single ferocious beast was able to charge into the city.

Time passed slowly. After an hour, there were less than a hundred people still fighting outside the city.

Only four members of the mercenary group were still fighting with the beasts outside the city. The rest of the members of the mercenary group had long fled to the city to recuperate.

“Everyone, put in more effort and kill all these beasts. Haha, after killing them, wait for the corpses of the Beasts!”

“Kill! This Daddy has killed over a hundred fierce beasts this time. I Won’t be short of money within ten years, Haha!”

“F * ck, defend this attack and rest well for a period of time!”

A city guard leader shouted loudly and encouraged.

The surrounding mercenary groups and city guards revealed excited expressions.

Although they had lost quite a number of people in this battle to defend the city, their gains were even greater.

The hundreds of thousands of fierce beasts’corpses would definitely keep them from leaving the city for a long time.

“Kill!”

The mercenary group and the city guards were excited again, and they continued to fight while roaring.

Outside the city, there were many corpses. The first two batches of corpses had been stored in the interspatial rings by special personnel.

According to the array formation in holy sea town, they could see every scene clearly. A group of people had recorded the scene and divided the corpses.

“Leader, none of our brothers died this time. Moreover, we killed at least 5,000 fierce beasts!”

At the bottom of the city wall, an old man said to dao hen excitedly, “After guarding the city this time, we can have a good rest for a while!”

“Haha, everyone has a year off. During this year, everyone can have a good time!”

Dao Hen’s face was also filled with excitement. Although one of the experts had died this time, the harvest was still extremely huge.

Just the corpse of a transcendent sixth grade fierce beast, they had already harvested thirty, including the other corpses.

This time, their harvest would reach thirty to forty million mid-grade spirit stones.

If split evenly, each person would be able to obtain several hundred thousand spirit stones.

“Thank you, leader, Long live the leader!”

“Long live the blade scar mercenary group!”

Below the city wall, more than 40 experts of the blade scar mercenary group raised their weapons excitedly and shouted.

“How domineering! As expected of the blade scar mercenary group. They have fought for so long and still have such fighting spirit!”

“The harvest of the blade scar mercenary group this time is simply heaven-defying. Our mercenary group’s harvest can’t even reach 1% of their harvest!”

“It’s really strong. The number one mercenary group in Holy Sea Town lives up to its name. It would be great if I could join the Sword Scar Mercenary Group!”

On the city wall, the mercenary groups heard the whistling sounds of the sword scar mercenary group, and their eyes were filled with respect and envy.

“More than a dozen brothers of our sword scar mercenary group died this time. We will recruit more than a dozen brothers to replace them!”

Hearing the voice from the city wall, a proud look appeared on the face of the sword scar mercenary group as he said lightly.

“Yes, we will treat the family members of our brothers who died well. Commander, why don’t we announce the recruitment of the mercenary group now?”

The old man beside him said to Dao Hen.

“Sure!”

Dao Hen nodded and slowly faced the direction of holy sea town, facing the city wall that was dozens of meters long.

“I, Dao Hen mercenary group, have lost more than ten brothers in this battle. We will once again recruit more than ten experts to become our brothers and fight side by side. Those who want to join our mercenary group, after this battle, go to the Dao Hen mercenary group and register!”

As Blade Scar spoke slowly, his voice instantly spread across several kilometers, and everyone heard it clearly.

“The blade scar mercenary group will once again recruit members. Haha, that’s Great. I want to register!”

“I want to go too. The blade scar mercenary group is simply too strong. After seeing their battle today, they are practically invincible in our holy sea town!”

“I also want to join the blade scar mercenary group, but to join them, I reckon that they must at least have the strength of a rank 4 transcendent!”

Knife Scar’s words made everyone on the city wall boil. Even some of the leaders of the mercenary groups were interested in joining him.

Everyone looked at knife scar with burning eyes.

That one-armed, one-eyed body stood under the huge city wall, but it didn’t seem small at all. Instead, it revealed a sense of majesty.

It made people feel fear.

In the hearts of the members of the Holy Sea town mercenary group, Knife Scar was the king of the mercenary world.

He was invincible.

A faint smile appeared on Dao Hen’s face. His ugly face made his smile look a bit ferocious.

“Leader, the third wave of fierce beasts are almost finished. Let’s go back!”

A middle-aged man said happily.

“Yeah, but before that, let’s get rid of an ant first!”

Dao Hen turned around coldly and looked at the position of the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group. A trace of indifference flashed in his eyes.

It was as if killing the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group was as easy as squashing an ant.

“Huh? Haha, Good Leader. An arrogant kid. I’ll kill him easily!”

The members of the sword scar mercenary group laughed and nodded. They clenched their weapons and looked at Wang Xian and the rest slowly.
