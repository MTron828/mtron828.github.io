2615 2615 bei Shuang’s master

The once heavenly daughter had returned?

When bei Shuang had come to the Bei Chuan sect, she had received a lot of attention!

Everyone in the Bei Chuan sect knew that the reason why bei Shuang hadn’t been able to break through was because she didn’t have a cultivation technique or a substantial frost law technique!

After more than 30,000 years, the heavenly daughter, who had shocked the entire imperial star field, had quickly fallen!

After the light dimmed, she was no longer valued by the sect. If it wasn’t for the fact that bei Shuang had brought a lot of honor to the Bei Chuan sect, she might have only become an ordinary disciple!

However, this powerful return, breaking through to the Undying King Level 4 in just over a year had once again shocked the sect!

Even though she wasn’t as dazzling as before, she had attracted the attention of the sect leader and Patriarch! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The bei Shuang of the past was known as the heavenly daughter who could lead their bei Chuan sect to become a great sect!

Now that she was back, this possibility still existed!

However, the Demon Island was under attack from the Abyss, the dozens of planets within their bei Chuan Sect’s territory had been destroyed by the Abyss, and the entire sect had lost over 100 undying emperors!

Bei Shuang’s return didn’t make them too excited!

“Bei Shuang, your luck is really good, to actually meet a warrior who understands the frost laws in the Southern Star System!”

The woman beside sighed softly!

After tens of thousands of years of floating dust, bei Shuang had experienced huge ups and downs, it was fortunate that his luck was better this time!

“HM, master is very good to me!”

Bei Shuang also revealed a faint smile!

“Bei Shuang, your return this time has caused the entire demon island to be in danger. The sect can no longer allow you to cultivate in peace. These abyss seeds are the sect’s compensation to you. It’s been hard on you for the past 30,000 years!”

At this moment, a few elders walked out of the Great Hall. They looked at bei Shuang and said with a smile!

“Thank you, sect master. After all, I’m still a disciple of the Bei Chuan sect. The bei Chuan sect has treated me well!”

Bei Shuang saw a few peak experts of the sect walk in and bowed slightly!

“Haha, Good, good. My bei Chuan sect is very gratified to have a disciple like you!”

The leader of the elders smiled in gratification!

Bei Shuang did not need to come this time, but she still rushed over despite the danger. The experts of the Bei Chuan sect were very happy!

This kind of disciple was the true disciple of the Bei Chuan sect!

“Alright, gather all the disciples. Now it’s time to fight against the Abyss!”

“I don’t know how many disciples will die in this battle, but we have to fight this battle. We’ll form a battle line with the ancient God dynasty and the Dragon Python group to defend the Northern line of the Demon Island...”

...

“Bei Shuang has just arrived. I’m not too sure about it. Go and take a look for yourself!”

In the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian muttered when he saw the message bei Shuang sent him!

“Ao Jian, bring someone with me to the Demon Island!”

Wang Xian brought Ao Jian and flew directly in the direction of the Demon Island!

“Mu Zesen, bring the members of the heaven’s Eye Arrow Division to the Dragon Peak to practice!”

After Wang Xian left, Prime Minister Gui instructed the members of the heaven’s Eye Arrow Division!

Prime Minister Gui knew that the Dragon Palace would most likely step into the area of the Demon Island!

With the breakthrough in his strength, Wang Xian’s speed had improved tremendously!

Now, he could fly in the void crack!

The speed in the void crack was comparable to teleportation. Most importantly, there was no danger in flying in the void crack!

Along with Ao Jian and another dragon guard, Wang Xian was flying in the starry sky!

At this moment, thousands of stars were lined up on the northern side of the Demon Island. It was a spectacular sight at a glance!

In front of these thousands of stars was an abyss that was deeper and more terrifying than the surrounding void!

It was completely different from the starry sky on the left, right, and back. There was no light there at all. The occasional roar that came from within was heart-palpitating!

This was because thousands of stars were lined up in a row, and it was also known as the Northern line!

The Northern line belonged to a flourishing area of the demon island. Because thousands of life planets were lined up side by side, it was not too far away to form a huge business circle!

Half of the planets on the Northern line were controlled by the great religious sect last month, and among them were controlled by the Beichuan sect, the ancient God dynasty, and the Dragon Python group!

Now that the Abyss had swallowed one-fifth of the Demon Island’s territory, it had completely entered the depths of the starry sky where the Demon Island used to be!

Seeing that they had arrived at the northern front, all the factions could no longer retreat!

They had to stop the Abyss from continuing to expand!

And if they wanted to stop it, they had to kill the abyssal seed inside the entrance!

The expansion of the Abyss was driven by the abyssal seed. As long as they killed and destroyed it, the Abyss would be able to stop expanding!

“According to our investigation, the abyssal seeds from the depths of the abyss have already charged towards us. They want to continue expanding the abyss. Everyone, get ready. When the time comes, we’ll charge into the Abyss and hunt them down!”

On a planet in the Northern line, an elder of the bei Chuan sect reminded the surrounding experts!

“It’s elder Gong!”

The group immediately nodded!

...

“HM? Where’s bei Shuang?”

Elder Gong nodded, his gaze sweeping the surroundings, asking curiously!

“Elder gong, junior bei Shuang is raising her strength, she said she’ll soon reach undying level 5!”

A lady smiled and said!

“Oh? Really?”

Elder Gong was slightly shocked!

“Elder!”

At this time, bei Shuang swiftly flew over from behind!

Elder Gong’s eyes lit up!

“Bei Shuang, you’ve broken through?”

Sensing the more mysterious light on bei Shuang’s body, he couldn’t help but ask!

...

“Yes Elder Gong, I’ve broken through!”

BEI shuang nodded, “It’s all thanks to the leader and the others giving me the law crystals!”

“You deserve it, looks like our bei Chuan clan’s heavenly daughter has returned!”

Elder Gong said happily!

“Master said that I have a deep foundation, it’s easy to reach undying level 5, the next upgrade will take some time!”

Bei Shuang said happily too!

“Yes, your foundation is too deep, however the next upgrade will probably be very fast, your master has picked up a treasure this time!”

Elder Gong said softly!

In his opinion, the dragon king who took bei Shuang as his disciple was really lucky!

He had a set of bei Shuang’s cultivation technique and met bei Shuang. His future was limitless. As his master, he would naturally benefit greatly!

“Master, he...”

“Elder, the abyssal seed in the Abyss has entered the range!”

Bei Shuang wanted to say something, but at this moment, a middle-aged expert immediately flew over to report!

“Are they here? All the disciples of the Bei Chuan Sect, set off!”

Elder Gong’s gaze focused as he immediately shouted!

“Set off, Kill!”

In the surroundings, the million strong disciples did not hesitate at all as they directly entered the abyss in front of them!

Bei Shuang also slightly moved her palm, and an ice claw appeared in her hand!

The white frost covers the entire body, causes it to be like the white hair demoness general, directly rushes into the abyss!
