Chapter 1286: 1287 narcissistic Beast Tamer

An extremely arrogant attitude was displayed on the young man named he shaotian.

Even when he heard long Xiaotian’s name, he still ignored him and stared at Wang Xian.

The two middle-aged men standing beside he Shaotian didn’t say anything. They stood on both sides calmly.

“Your Pet?”

Wang Xian heard his words and looked at the group of ferocious beasts behind him. He had a guess in his heart.

“If you let it pass, it should pass. We Won’t stop it. Let It Go and take a look!”

He looked at young master he with a smile.

“HMM?”

Young master he raised his eyebrows slightly. A hint of curiosity flashed across his delicate and pretty face. He looked at the two level one void interpretation ferocious beasts beside Wang Xian.

Then, he looked at the more than 200 mounts around him.

“I will tame them!”

As young master he spoke, he walked straight towards the Dodo bird.

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

When the Dodo bird saw young master he walking over, a fierce look appeared in its eyes. Its sharp lips were flashing with light.

“HMPH!”

Young master he snorted coldly. With a slight movement of his arm, two jade rings escaped directly towards the head of the Dodo bird.

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

When the Dodo bird saw the two jade rings, a look of fear flashed through its eyes. It curled its lips and a terrifying peck of light flew towards young master he.

A trace of contempt appeared on young master he’s face. His figure moved and the jade rings flickered, instantly appearing on the body of the Dodo bird.

The Dodo bird was trapped by the jade rings and it struggled violently.

“Hehe, you still want to escape!”

A smile appeared on young master he’s face as he walked over arrogantly.

“Stop!”

Long Xiaotian was furious when he saw that his dodo bird was taken away. He shouted loudly with a cold gaze.

Wang Xian waved his hand at long Xiaotian, asking him not to speak.

This young man in front of him was not simple.

To be able to be accompanied by two powerhouses at level three of the Seethrough realm, even a prince from the bloodshed empire might not be able to do it.

“If I say it’s my pet, it’s mine. Hehe, a light-attributed flying dodo bird. It’s pretty!”

Young master he walked to the side of the Flying Dodo bird and revealed a faint smile.

He looked at Wang Xian and grinned. “Let me show you if it’s obedient!”

As young master he spoke, he immediately squeezed out a trace of blood. With a move of his arm, he headed towards the head of the Flying Dodo bird.

The Ferry Bird’s eyes revealed fear and struggle.

“Beast taming technique, Young Master He’s beast taming technique is simply too strong!”

“That’s not it. Young master he has the exquisite heart. He can sense the heart of a fierce beast and control it. Taming a fierce beast shouldn’t be too fast!”

At the back, the men and women of the Yan clan were discussing in low voices.

“Brother he, later, can you give me a ferry bird!”

A pretty girl looked at young master he with admiration and said softly.

“Sure, Don’t Disturb Me Now!”

Young master he nodded and smiled.

“Second prince, don’t be rash. This young man’s identity is not simple. The two middle-aged men beside him are very terrifying!”

Bai Qingshan saw Long Xiaotian’s angry face and raised his voice.

Long Xiaotian nodded with a gloomy face and stared at young master he with an unfriendly gaze.

“Beast taming technique? He is also a Beast Tamer!”

“I think so. However, his beast taming technique should not be as powerful as young master Wang’s!”

“Of course. How can there be a Beast Tamer Nian who is even more powerful than young master Wang in this world?”

The subordinates behind Long Xiaotian were astonished when they saw young master he taming the Dodo bird on the spot. They discussed in a low voice.

“Hmph, comparing beast taming skills with brother he?”

In the front, the young lady from the Yan clan heard the discussion of long Xiaotian’s subordinates. She snorted softly and swept her gaze across Wang Xian. “He is not someone that any one of us can compare with. He doesn’t have the qualifications!”

“I think he doesn’t have the qualifications!”

Long Xiaotian snorted coldly.

“Compared to young master he, the rest of the young beast tamers are like frogs in a well!”

A young man from the Yan clan shouted loudly.

The few of them spoke in a tit-for-tat manner. The two middle-aged men remained silent.

They looked at Wang Xian and the few ferocious beasts beside him. They exchanged a glance and their eyes were filled with astonishment.

They didn’t have much hostility towards Wang Xian and his group.

Of course, if the other party dared to offend the pride of their clan, they would naturally teach them a lesson.

Long Xiaotian looked at young master he and walked to Wang Xian’s side with a sullen face. “Brother Wang Xian... This...”

“Let’s take a look here!”

Wang Xian didn’t leave immediately. He looked at young master he who was standing there and taming the Dodo bird with a smile.

He wanted to see how this arrogant young master he tamed the Dodo bird.

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

After about five minutes, the Dodo bird suddenly let out a weak cry.

A hint of joy appeared in young master he’s eyes as he continued to tame the Dodo bird with a smile on his face.

When Wang Xian saw this scene, a faint smile appeared on his face.

Time passed slowly. Young master he stood beside the Dodo bird for half an hour.

He stood there and caressed the Dodo bird.

This scene caused long Xiaotian’s subordinates to frown slightly.

Was this taming a beast? Why did it take so long?

“Hu, Haha, I’ll Call You Bai Ling from now on!”

After another ten minutes, young master he laughed loudly and patted the head of the Dodo bird.

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

The Dodo bird lowered its head slightly and called out.

“Success!”

“Too strong, young master he is simply too strong. In less than an hour, he tamed another fierce beast!”

“As expected of young master he. His beast taming skills are unrivaled!”

Behind him, a few young men complimented him.

“Hehe, it’s not that simple. If you want to completely tame it, you will need at least a few more months. This is just a simple taming!”

Young master he smiled faintly.

He looked at Wang Xian and the corner of his mouth curled up slightly. He said proudly, “To be able to tame two beasts of the first level of the Seethrough realm, it seems like you are also a Beast Tamer. It’s already not bad for you to have such achievements in this small area!”

“I’ll give you a chance. Follow me in the future and help me manage my subordinates’Pets!”

“HMM? This kid’s luck is really good. To think that he can follow young master he in the future!”

“To think that young master he has taken a fancy to him. This kid will have a meteoric rise in the future!”

When the disciples of the Yan clan heard young master he’s words, they looked at Wang Xian with envy.

When the two middle-aged men saw young master he’s way of handling the situation, their eyes were filled with admiration.

In this small area, it was considered outstanding for a young man to be able to tame a ferocious beast of the first level of the Seethrough realm.

He was qualified to follow the most outstanding son of Heaven’s pride in the He clan.

“Eh?”

When Wang Xian saw the arrogant young master he and heard the envious looks of the people behind him and the admiration of the two middle-aged men, he felt a little overwhelmed.

So narcissistic?

Do you have to be so narcissistic?

“Is it because of your pretty face that gives you confidence?”

Wang Xian looked at him speechlessly.
