Chapter 1071: 1072 blood barbarian demonic beast

Translator: 5496903

Boom! Boom! Boom

It was a battle, an intense battle!

5,000 cavalrymen and more than 1,000 students from the three major academies were fighting against more than 100,000 water wolves.

The difference was dozens of times, but the overall strength of the water wolves was much weaker than them.

After a short battle, under the command of Wang Xian, a bloody massacre began.

One by one, the water wolves fell to the ground rapidly. The fresh blood made the entire ground sticky.

Wang Xian did not make a move. He swept his gaze across the surroundings. When he realized that there was no threat, he turned his gaze to the position of deputy leader Meng.

One person against eight transcendent level nine blood barbaric demonic beasts.

Wang Xian had read about blood barbaric demonic beasts before. They were bloodthirsty and used fresh blood to increase their own strength.

They absorbed the fresh blood of other creatures and refined their own bloodlines to increase their own strength.

With sufficient fresh blood, these blood barbarian demonic beasts could be upgraded to the insightful void tier. They were extremely powerful.

On the main road, the blood barbarian demonic beasts had caused many siege incidents.

They controlled the beasts to attack the city. After that, they would devour the bloodlines of humans. They would also devour the Dead Beasts.

To humans, the blood savage beasts were definitely their mortal enemies.

There was still a huge gap between the eight level nine extraordinary blood savage beasts and the half-step void interpretation deputy commander Meng.

In less than two minutes, two blood savage beasts were severely injured by deputy commander Meng.

“Eh, isn’t that Zhang Fengying’s nephew?”

At this moment, Wang Xian saw a familiar person. It was the young man, Zhang Yushu, who went to the auction house with Zhang Fengying that day.

Wang Xian took a look. Zhang Yushu’s strength had already reached transcendent level five. He was very strong. However, this was also due to his bloodline.

One by one, the water wolves fell. One by one, the blood barbaric demonic beasts were killed by deputy leader Meng. When more than half of the water wolves fell to the ground, the water wolves started to panic.

“Humans, you bunch of damn humans. It Won’t be long before we break through your city and kill all of you!”

“Our king will kill all of you. None of you will be able to escape.”

After the three blood savage beasts were killed by Vice Commander Meng, the remaining five blood savage beasts roared with ferocious expressions.

Their faces with sharp mouthparts twisted violently.

“Blood all over the world!”

“Go to Hell, you bunch of beasts!”

Vice Commander Meng’s entire body was emitting a dense earthen yellow energy. With a wave of the long saber in his hand, the ground split open into a thousand meter long abyss.

“Boom!”

He stomped his foot heavily, and three more blood savage beasts were crushed.

“Blood explosion escape!”

Two sharp sounds rang out, and two blood figures quickly fled into the distance.

Deputy Commander Meng frowned slightly, and did not continue to pursue.

“I didn’t expect the humans to be so strong to encircle us. Damn it, six brothers died!”

“We must take revenge. We must destroy Xilai town and then destroy holy sea town. We must not leave any humans alive!”

“Let’s go find our king. The human star-moon kingdom has sent an expert. We must be careful this time!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The two blood savage demonic beasts that had escaped instantly fled ten kilometers away. They turned around and saw that the human expert did not chase after them. They let out a heavy sigh of relief.

“Puchi!”

However, just as the two demonic beasts let out a sigh of relief, two sickles appeared on their necks. With a light swipe, they were instantly destroyed.

“Weng!”

The two Demonic Beasts’corpses disappeared, and the white figure that flashed past also disappeared in an instant.

“Thousand Mountain Crack!”

Along with Vice Commander Meng’s Slash, the battlefield covered an area of three kilometers in front of them. In an instant, tens of thousands of water wolves were killed, and the entire battle ended.

“Take as many water wolves’corpses as you can. Those who are injured, quickly treat them!”

Vice leader Meng swept his gaze across the surrounding people and said loudly.

“Yes, leader!”

The group of soldiers nodded and began to clean up the last few hundred water wolves. They placed the corpses into their interspatial rings one by one.

“Fellow student, it was all thanks to you just now!”

Deputy Captain Meng moved and came before Wang Xian. He cupped his fists with a face full of gratitude.

“There’s no need for that. Even without my reminder, we wouldn’t have lost!”

Wang Xian shook his head lightly.

“Although we wouldn’t have lost, many people are going to die!”

Deputy Captain Meng smiled and looked into Wang Xian’s eyes. “Your ocular skills are really powerful. Your Command is also very strong. I wonder if you are interested in joining the ocean cultivators after graduation?”

“Thank you for your kind intentions, deputy captain Meng. I want to be a member of the mercenary group. I don’t want to be restricted!”

“That’s a pity. With your ocular skill and commanding ability, it’s a waste of your talent to be a member of the mercenary group. The army is the best place for You!”

Wang Xian rejected deputy captain Meng’s invitation to join the army. Naturally, it was impossible for him to join.

His commanding ability could only be described as average. Of course, this was only comparable to Prime Minister Gui.

Wang Xian’s eye technique coupled with his commanding ability was still very strong for deputy chief Meng and the rest.

“This student’s commanding and investigative ability is really strong!”

“That’s right, that’s right. I didn’t expect the demon Hunters Academy to have such a genius. We’re really lucky!”

“It’s all thanks to you for reminding us about what happened just now. Otherwise, we would have suffered great losses!”

The instructors from the three major colleges walked over and thanked Wang Xian.

In the situation just now, if the water wolves were to really charge into the formation, the students from the three major colleges would definitely suffer heavy losses.

They didn’t have the experience of being soldiers. If they were flustered, someone would definitely die.

“You’re welcome!”

Wang Xian shook his head and exchanged a few simple pleasantries with them.

The students from the three major academies looked at this scene with envy.

The battle just now had given the leader of the Demon Hunters Academy the limelight. They looked at Wang Xian while some of the students secretly went to the students of the Demon Hunters Academy to gather information.

When they found out that Wang Xian was a new student, everyone had an incredulous look on their faces.

Are you kidding me? A freshman? How can a freshman be your leader?

“It’s him!”

Zhang Yushu looked at Wang Xian’s figure with a look of surprise.

“Rest for one minute. Let’s go back!”

At this moment, deputy leader Meng’s voice rang out, causing everyone to start preparing immediately.

Wang Xian also spoke to the few teachers beside him and walked to Ao Jian and the rest.

His gaze swept across the surroundings and realized that there were still numerous bodies of water wolves on the ground.

“Dragon King, there are too many bodies of water wolves. We only have over 500 of them!”

Ao Jian and the rest walked over and spoke to Wang Xian.

There were already quite a number of demonic beasts in their interspatial rings. Now, they couldn’t fit all of them in.

Furthermore, not only could they not fit all of them in, there were about 100,000 of these hundreds of thousands of bodies that had to be thrown here.

“What a pity!”

Wang Xian looked at the bodies of the water wolves around him. These were huge resources for the Dragon Palace!
