3597 When the 3596 Dragon Palace arrived, they immediately fled!

“Run!”

The experts of the god Shepherd clan, the Black Fog Spirit clan, and the corpse-eating ghost clan saw the terrifying power coming from the right. When they saw the experts of the Dragon Palace charging toward them, their faces were abnormally embarrassed!

They didn’t hesitate at all and immediately fled!

Why didn’t they flee at this time?

This time, the six great clans had split into two teams to deal with the sudden situation. The strength of the Holy Dragon Bloodline, the light giant, and the light sound insect clan was about the same as the strength of the god Shepherd clan, the Black Fog Spirit clan, and the corpse-eating ghost clan!

Now that the light giant tribe and a large number of their experts had been killed by the Dragon Palace, the black fog spiritual race and the Ghoul tribe would definitely not be a match for the Dragon Palace!

Therefore, at this moment, they did not hesitate and fled!

Immediately!

“Let’s Go!”

The disciples of the Black Fog spiritual race and the Ghoul tribe did not hesitate at all. Their figures flashed and they disappeared immediately!

The patriarch of the god-herding tribe and the rest also left in a flash!

On the right, Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly when he saw all of them leaving!

“Dragon King, they have all escaped. Should we go straight to the giant of Light Tribe?”

An lie followed from the side and said to Wang Xian!

“Yes, let’s go to the giant of light tribe. The patriarch of the giant of Light Tribe has escaped. However, there are only two or three of them left. Let’s go straight there!”

Wang Xian did not pursue the experts of the god-herding tribe. What he wanted to do was to spread out the three major tribes of the god-herding tribe!

After that, he would go to the giant of Light Tribe!

Among the three major tribes that were killed by Wang Xian and the rest, the giant of light tribe was the strongest and had the strongest heritage!

Similarly, their treasures might also be the strongest!

Almost all the experts of the giant of light tribe had been killed!

However, Wang Xian and the rest did not obtain many treasures!

Wang Xian and the rest went over to search for the divine kingdoms of the powerhouses of the giant of light!

They had the divine kingdoms of more than a dozen powerhouses at the peak of the giant of light. If they found their divine kingdoms, they would be able to obtain a large number of treasures!

If they were lucky, they might even be able to obtain the treasure vault of the giant of light!

Buzz

An lie enveloped them and their figures immediately disappeared!

When Wang Xian and the rest reappeared, they were already in the territory of the giant of light!

In the past few months, an lie had already left behind the devil spirit altar in the territory of the six major races!

Through the devil spirit altar, they could rush over in an instant!

“Heaven Formation!”

When they arrived, Wang Xian looked at Heaven Formation and the rest!

Heaven Formation nodded and immediately began to search for the Divine Kingdom of the light giant using the formation!

“Damn it, damn it, how could this be!”

At this moment, at the center of the light giant tribe, the leader of the light giant tribe had returned to his divine kingdom. Immediately, he came to the location of their tribe’s Paradise!

The thought of the consequences of this battle made his heart bleed!

This time, 80% of their great beings had gone out to battle, but only four had survived!

Four universe masters with level-three Combat Power had survived!

As for universe masters with level-one and level-two combat power, only two had survived!

This battle had almost completely destroyed the foundation of their light giant race!

80% of the universe masters had lost their combat power!

This loss was too great!

“Clan leader, Clan Leader!”

At this moment, the remaining eight universe masters of the light giant race sensed the arrival of their clan leader. They immediately flew over and stood in front of him with an unsightly expression!

“This time, we have suffered a crushing defeat. Please appease all the disciples. Also, in order to prevent any accidents, keep a lookout for the surroundings!”

The leader of the giant of light spoke with an embarrassed expression.

“It’s the leader!”

One of the giant of light nodded!

“Weng Weng Weng!”

However, at this moment, the sound of an alarm suddenly sounded!

“Huh?”

The leader of the giant of light was slightly stunned. He immediately stood up and stared at the position outside!

“What happened? Why did the alarm suddenly sound?”

He shouted in alarm!

“Buzz!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

A giant of light moved his hand and a technological item flew in front of them. An image immediately appeared!

In the image, divine dragons were flying in the giant of Light’s territory and flying toward them!

“Damn it, those guys from the Dragon Palace are chasing after us!”

The light giant’s pupils constricted when he saw this!

“Let’s Go! Take all the disciples and run away immediately!”

At the same time, he roared without hesitation!

“It’s the clan leader!”

The eight light giants, who were universe masters with level-three power, flew out without hesitation!

“All the disciples of the light giant clan, run away with us immediately!”

They flew over and roared loudly!

“Escape?”

“Could it be that the powerful warrior of the Dragon Palace is coming over? How is this possible?”

“Quick, quick, the alarm sounds, it should be that powerful warrior of the Dragon Palace coming over!”

The disciples of the light giant clan had already found out about the incident of their race being defeated by the Dragon Palace on the universe ai!

Now that their race’s alarm had sounded and their masters had ordered them to escape, all the disciples didn’t hesitate at all!

“Enter the god country, let’s Go!”

The group of experts put all the disciples into their God country and then quickly escaped with the leader of the light giant race!

They didn’t place their hopes on the light giant race’s blessed land!

With the example of the god Herder tribe, they knew that the grotto-heaven paradise couldn’t withstand the attack of the Dragon Palace!

Moreover, after the fight with the experts of the Dragon Palace, the strength of the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King and the red-clothed woman of the Dragon Palace made them feel terrified!

The tribe leader of the light giant tribe led all the disciples to escape from their territory with sullen and unwilling faces.

“Hu, let’s go to the Angel Tribe!”

The leader of the light giant tribe looked at his territory and growled in a low voice with an unwilling expression!

This time, the six great tribes had joined hands and lost to the Dragon Palace!

This made them very unwilling!

After this complete defeat, it would be very difficult for them to deal with the Dragon Palace again!

Because the peak tribes could not interfere, the Angel tribe already had subsidiary tribes that could deal with the Dragon Palace!

Not only could they not deal with it, they would even face the Dragon Palace’s Revenge!

“Dragon King, they have all escaped.”

When Wang Xian and the rest arrived at the center of the light giant race, the heaven array sensed their surroundings and said!

“Hehe, let’s escape then. Let’s start searching for treasures!”

Wang Xian shook his head nonchalantly!

This time, it was not to chase after them, but for the divine kingdoms of the experts who had been killed!

“Destroy all the teleportation arrays. An lie, go back to Dragon Palace and bring all the dragon wizards who have reached the power of universe masters here!”

Sky Array ordered them!
