Chapter 974: No. 1 among the 0975 freshmen, useless! Go

Translator: 549690339

So it was someone from the useless mercenary group!

When Wang Xian’s words rang out, the surrounding discussions quieted down. Everyone stared at Wang Xian with their mouths Agape.

Even the smile on the face of the young man from the young master’s mercenary group froze.

If he didn’t enter the academy before, he didn’t know that the young master’s mercenary group could still say that the freshmen were fearless and that those who didn’t know were innocent.

But now, he had already entered the academy, and in front of thousands of people, he directly said that the young master’s mercenary group was a useless mercenary group. That was a blatant insult!

Everyone’s gaze turned towards the young master’s mercenary group’s young man in embroidered clothes.

They weren’t the little white people of the past.

In three days, they had a detailed understanding of some of the mercenary groups in the Demon Hunters Academy.

To dare to call them trash in front of the members of the young master’s mercenary group, the result was...

The young man in embroidered clothes saw that all the new students were looking at him, and his expression kept changing.

If they couldn’t teach this kid a painful lesson in the future, their young master’s mercenary group would become a complete joke among the new students!

“Pa Pa Pa!”

The young man in embroidered clothes slowly walked towards Wang Xian. As he stepped on the ground, he let out a crisp sound and revealed a cold expression. “Kid, do you want to die? Alright, Alright, I’ll Grant Your Wish!”

As he spoke, he swept his gaze across everyone behind him and shouted loudly, “Today, as a member of the young master’s mercenary group, I will issue a mission. Beat this kid up for 20,000 middle-grade spiritual stones!”

“Cripple one arm for 50,000 middle-grade spiritual stones!”

“Two arms for 100,000 middle-grade spiritual stones!”

“Four limbs for 200,000 middle-grade spiritual stones!”

“Anyone who can complete the task can come directly to our young master’s mercenary group to collect the spirit stones. You Don’t have to worry about our reputation!”

As the young man spoke, he slowly turned his head and stared at Wang Xian again. His gaze was cold as he said, “Kid, I’m going to make sure that you can’t stay in the Demon Hunters Academy anymore. In the future, the Demon Hunters Academy Will Be Hell for You!”

“What the F * ck! He gave you 20,000 middle-grade spirit stones after a beating and 50,000 for a crippled arm. This is way too rich!”

“F * ck! If I crippled a limb of this kid, I would be able to buy more than a dozen elixirs!”

“This guy is done for!”

“However, it shouldn’t be too much of a problem if he is a little more careful. After all, if the seniors want to fight with him, they have to obtain his consent. Unless, there is someone among us freshmen who can cripple him!”

“Cripple him? I reckon that there aren’t many freshmen who can do so. This fellow is very strong!”

The surrounding students immediately went into an uproar. 200,000 middle-grade spirit stones was enough to purchase dozens of transcendent grade 2 pills.

Even Grade 3 pills were enough to purchase quite a few.

Giving them 200,000 middle-grade spirit stones was enough to fully equip them!

Many of the students were tempted. Some of the class leaders were even hesitating whether they should make a move or not!

Wang Xian looked at the young man in embroidered clothes. A hint of coldness flashed across his eyes. Then, he looked at the students around him who were eager to give it a try. A hint of coldness flashed across his eyes.

“Why? Does someone want these spirit stones?”

He glanced at everyone arrogantly and said coldly.

“Haha, of course I want them. 200,000 middle-grade spiritual stones. TSK TSK, I don’t have so many spiritual stones even if I complete some silver-level 3-4 missions!”

Four to five young men beside Wang Xian laughed out loud as soon as he finished his words.

“Others might not agree if you guys came to spar with this new student!”

Three to four young men spoke to them after they finished their words.

“Sigh, what a pity. We can only stay here and watch the Show!”

They chatted and laughed as a hint of passion flashed in their eyes. They wanted to spar with Wang Xian and cripple his limbs as well.

However, due to the age restriction and the Academy’s rules, the other party could reject their challenge.

If they were of the same level, they couldn’t reject their challenge unless they admitted defeat.

“I’ll do it. Senior of the young master’s mercenary group, I’m here to accept your mission!”

A young man walked out from the front of Class Five’s group of students and said with a smile.

“Let me do it!”

The leader of class five, the strongest student of class five, walked out with a twinkle in his eyes.

However, he had just taken two steps when another voice sounded.

When this voice rang out, everyone was stunned.

The voice came from the arena.

Everyone looked over and revealed a look of astonishment.

“Qin Shan is actually going to make a move. This... he’s going to cripple that kid!”

“Qin Shan’s family background isn’t that good to begin with. These two hundred thousand spirit stones are still relatively precious to him!”

“If Qin Shan makes a move, that Wang Xian is going to be finished!”

“This is going to be interesting. I didn’t expect that the strongest first grade student would want to deal with him!”

The surrounding students revealed a look of surprise. They looked at the strongest first grade student who was standing proudly on the stage and then looked at Wang Xian below. A mocking expression appeared on their faces.

“Xiao Shan!”

Qin Qing saw that her younger brother was about to come out. She frowned slightly and shouted at Qin Shan.

“It’s Alright, Sister. If I don’t cripple his limbs, others will cripple him too!”

A confident smile appeared on Qin Shan’s face.

“Haha, if Younger Brother Qin Shan wants to cripple that kid, I’ll ask young master’s mercenary group to give you 400,000 mid-grade spirit stones!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Seeing that Qin Shan was about to make a move, the young man in embroidered clothes in front of him had a thought and shouted loudly. He turned his head and smiled at Qin Qing in an attempt to curry favor.

He directly raised the spirit stones to 400,000 spirit stones. Firstly, he could cripple that brat immediately. Secondly, he could curry favor with Qin Qing. Killing two birds with one stone.

“Alright!”

A fiery look flashed across Qin Shan’s eyes as he stared at Wang Xian. He slowly extended his hand and hooked his finger.

“Come on up. Let me see what kind of strength you have. You came to say that the young master’s mercenary group is useless. If you don’t have the strength, then you’re out of Luck!”

As Qin Shan spoke, he stared coldly at Wang Xian. “Come on Up!”

“You want to cripple my limbs?”

Wang Xian looked at Qin Shan on the stage and asked coldly.

“You can cripple it yourself!”

Qin Shan said calmly with a face full of confidence.

“Cool. As expected of the leader of all the students in our first grade. His boldness is awesome!”

“Regardless of whether it’s strength or temperament, Qin Shan is very powerful!”

“Haha, with Qin Shan’s strength, it should be easy for him to cripple that Wang Xian!”

When the surrounding people heard Qin Shan’s reply, admiration appeared on their faces.

Wang Xian sneered in his heart. He moved his body and flew directly to the arena.

“You asked for it!”

He said faintly.

“Hehe!”

Qin Shan smiled confidently and made a hand gesture!

“Xiao Shan, be careful!”

Qin Qing looked at Qin Shan on the stage and reminded him with a frown.

“Go, Qin Shan!”

“Go, Qin Shan, you’re the best!”

“Cripple him!”

Below, a group of girls were shouting and cheering without holding back.

The corner of Qin Shan’s mouth curled up slightly and he said proudly, “I’ll let you make the first move!”
