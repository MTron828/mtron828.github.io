Chapter 520: The World Is Shocked

DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Could it be that the Remains have been annihilated?”

An unbelievable thought surfaced in the minds of the four experts from the Spiritual Wind Sect. They stood at the base of the Remains that had been razed while staring blankly at the surroundings.

When they looked across, they couldn’t help but gasp.

“Where’re the Remains? That’s one of the four strongest devil sects! It’s even stronger than an ordinary Sacred Sect and yet it has now been razed to the ground. Who did this? Who is capable of doing this?”

An old man looked around in shock. Looking at the corpses on the ground, he hesitated for a moment before jumping into the middle of the flames.

Ka ka ka!

As he landed on the bones, sounds of bones cracking gave him chills. He walked towards the structure in the middle and saw the sacrificial ritual platform with the word “Remains” engraved prominently on it.

Around them, there were no longer any signs of life. All the people had died.

The old man flew into the sky and suddenly noticed a huge body below him.

That was the body of a young man with ten terrifying tailbones. At this moment, the tailbone scattered into ashes when a gentle breeze blew past.

“Those ten tailbones... That must be the corpse of the Lord of the Remains!” Astonishment was written all over the old man’s face as he mumbled with a shaky voice.

“The Remains being annihilated is a piece of good news for all orthodox sects. The only question would be who would have done so!”

The other old man by the side sank into deep thought. He had a conjecture in mind but he wasn’t certain.

“In the Underworld, who would be capable of this?”

An old man looked ahead before exchanging glances with the others. “Only the Dragon King and his subordinates have entered this place today. Moreover, only the Dragon King is capable of annihilating the Remains in the Underworld at this moment!”

“The Dragon King of Dragon Sect? This... Why did he want to annihilate the Remains? Now that he has a deep feud with Dong Hua Sacred Sect, would he dare to offend the devil sects too?”

An old man shook his head in disbelief.

“Becoming the enemy of Dong Hua Sacred Sect and Diabolism... Could it be that the Dragon King is trying to make the whole world his enemy?”

“Making the whole world his enemy... He is really making everyone his enemy. The Dragon King’s actions aren’t something we can predict. He has offended the leader of the orthodox sects and annihilated the Remains from Diabolism in the same day! Arrogance! Really arrogant!”

“Let’s go. If the people of the Underworld are to learn about this, they probably will be shocked and stirred!”

“Dong Hua Sacred Sect is going to be embarrassed in this matter.”

The few of them conversed and took a further glance at the base of the Remains that was still shrouded in flames. With shocked and complicated feelings, they headed back towards Ling City.

Along the way, they saw two Inborn experts dashing past them. They didn’t converse and simply went on their own way.

Night. The entire world had quietened down.

Activity on the forum of the Underworld website had also died down deep into the night.

The critiques of the Dragon King and the Dragon Sect had also paused for the moment.

However, a thread suddenly appeared deep into the night.

[The Remains have been annihilated]

This thread came with pictures of the huge fire in the base of the Remains and the corpses within the area.

When this piece of news was announced, it didn’t cause a huge ruckus at night. Nonetheless, there were still a thousand comments.

On the second morning, Wang Xian headed to the floating island near Rivertown after waking up.

Looking at the Devil Metal Steel and Tenacious Devil Stone on the ground, he hesitated for a moment before starting to craft weapons.

“I hope I can succeed. After I craft this Inborn Spiritual Equipment, the dragonians will be invincible among Inborn experts with them!”

Wang Xian’s lips curved into a smile as anticipation beamed in his eyes.

At this moment, what Wang Xian didn’t know was that his actions yesterday had shocked the world.

Late at night, when the thread of the Remains being annihilated was posted, it only drew the attention of a thousand-plus people.

Some of them didn’t believe it while others had doubts in mind.

Some sects and experts nearing the Ling City sent their men over out of curiosity.

When they entered the nest of the Remains and saw the situation, they couldn’t help but be astonished.

Early in the morning, the news of the Remains being annihilated had truly kicked up a storm.

[The Remains, one of the four strongest devil sects, has been annihilated. Flames have razed through their base and all the experts of the Remains are dead. This has been verified!]

[Many people might not have believed the news last night about the Remains being annihilated. We are located near the base of the Remains. After heading there, we are sure to say that the Remains have indeed been annihilated!]

[Shocking! The base of the Remains was reduced to ruins in a single night. Who could have annihilated the Remains?]

The news of the Remains being annihilated soon spread like wildfire.

The Remains was one of the four strongest devil sects. It was terrifying and strong. Yet, they had been annihilated.

Many people in the Underworld couldn’t help but cheer on the news of them being annihilated.

The evil and brutal acts of the Remains had long infuriated many sects and families in the Underworld.

While they were celebrating the annihilation of the Remains, the question of who had annihilated them was also thrown out.

[Who could have annihilated one of the four strongest devil sects?]

[Who?]

When questions of this nature were posted, many people recalled the thread about the Dragon King of Dragon Sect last night.

[The Dragon King of Dragon Sect led a group of disciples with the disciple of the Remains into the Fateless Forest.]

The thread starter saw the Dragon King headed towards the base of the Remains with the disciples of the Remains.

Soon, news of the Remains being annihilated came.

At the thought of this, their jaws dropped and disbelief filled their faces.

[Could... Could it be that the Dragon King was the one who annihilated the Remains?]

[What a terrifying thought. In the current Underworld, Dong Hua Sacred Sect could have annihilated the Remains. Dragon Sect is also capable of doing so. Considering that the alliance of the orthodox sects was formed yesterday, Dong Hua Sacred Sect wouldn’t have been the one who was responsible. On the other hand, there was news of the Dragon King leading his disciples into the base of the Remains. The conclusion is clear!]

[F*ck! It’s almost a hundred percent certain that the Dragon King was the one who annihilated the Remains. This... This... Dragon King is simply too incredible!]

[Aren’t there people accusing the Dragon Sect of joining Diabolism? Damn! What a preposterous claim! In my view, considering the Dragon King’s personality, he would never join Diabolism!]

[I believe it was Dong Hua Sacred Sect who accused Dragon Sect of joining Diabolism and that they will be annihilating the Dragon Sect!]

[‘I, the Dragon King, don’t have to explain my actions to you. I can choose to become an enemy to the leader of the alliance of the orthodox sects, Dong Hua Sacred Sect. At the same time, I can annihilate the Remains from Diabolism as I wish.’ Damn! The Dragon King is too darned domineering!]

[A day ago, everyone was still criticizing the Dragon King of Dragon Sect. What about today? Alright, I admit I was one of them. Here, I would like to say something. Dragon Sect is mighty! The Dragon King is domineering!]

[Through this, the Dragon King has undoubtedly given a slap to all those who criticized him yesterday. At the same time, they gave a slap to Dong Hua Sacred Sect. This speed of slapping those who criticized them is too darned quick!]
