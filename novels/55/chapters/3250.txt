3251 The 3,250 divine dragons had a huge change

“You’re courting death!”

On Xiao Lan’s body, chains penetrated the bodies of the two universe knights of the holy prose clan, severely injuring them.

“You… Let us go. We didn’t mean to offend you. We didn’t mean to offend you at all. Let Us Go!”

The two experts of the holy prose clan were shocked and their faces were full of cold sweat.

They shouted in horror.

“You brought this on yourself!”

Wang Xian extended his palm and a surge of energy surged into their bodies.

Prime Minister Gui had already given them a warning. If they dared to continue attacking, they would not be able to hold back.

“Soul Catcher!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flashed with a strange luster, causing the two of them to tremble slightly.

“Summon Your Universe God Country!”

He shouted in a low voice and ordered.

“Yes! Yes!”

The two of them answered in confusion, and two God countries slowly appeared.

“Hahaha, these two guys are really good people, sending resources from billions of miles away!”

At the side, ao crab laughed loudly, and his face revealed an excited expression.

Two universe knight level five God countries were enough for him to make a breakthrough.

The two corpses could also increase the combat strength of two level 5 universe knights in the Dragon Palace.

“Holy prose clan.”

At this moment, Wang Xian opened his eyes, which were shining.

One of them was quite famous in the surrounding Lu Xing Kong.

Their clan elder had a level 6 universe knight power.

In the surrounding Lu Xing Kong, a power with a Level 6 universe knight was considered quite powerful.

A power with a Level 7 universe knight could consider logging in.

This holy prose clan wasn’t weak.

The two of them were also the core elders of the holy prose clan.

Wang Xian didn’t take them to heart.

Putting aside the fact that the other party didn’t know who killed them, so what if they did?

Soon, the Dragon Palace would receive a huge upgrade. By then, the Holy Prose Clan wouldn’t be afraid at all.

If they rushed over to take revenge, the Dragon Palace would dare to destroy them.

“Dragon King, there’s another big news from the divine dragon lineage in the surrounding Lu Xingkong!”

Before he could rush back to the Dragon Palace, Prime Minister Gui suddenly walked over and said with a hint of shock on his face.

“Huh? What’s Wrong?”

Wang Xian looked at him with a face full of curiosity.

“According to the news from Lu Xingkong’s Wisdom Brain Mountain, the Fire Dragon Palace and the Devil Dragon lineage are now invading the red gold war dragon lineage.”

“Furthermore, it seems that the red gold war dragon is no match for the two great divine dragons. They have already surrendered.”

Prime Minister GUI said with a slightly solemn expression.

The invasion of the Divine Fire Palace and the demonic dragon lineage was a huge shock to the divine dragon lineage.

To the entire surrounding starry sky, it was not a small matter.

“After destroying the divine wind and thunder dragon lineage and now defeating the red-gold War Dragon lineage, the Fire Dragon Palace and the demonic dragon lineage are not simple at all!”

Wang Xian frowned slightly.

Regardless of whether it was the bloodline of the divine wind and Thunder Dragon or the bloodline of the Red Gold War Dragon, they both had a powerful dragon palace.

With the protection of the powerful Dragon Palace, how could they be destroyed so easily.

There was only one explanation. The Fire Dragon Palace and the Devil Dragon Bloodline had a way to break through the powerful Dragon Palace.

“They might have wanted to destroy the water dragon palace in the beginning because their appearance changed their target.”

Wang Xian guessed in his heart.

As for the Fire Dragon Palace’s demonic dragon lineage, what were they going to do when they defeated the two divine dragon lineages in such a crazy manner?

Resources?

The huge amount of resources allowed them to improve rapidly?

That was the only explanation.

Furthermore, after absorbing the two divine dragon lineages, the Fire Dragon Palace and the demonic dragon lineage must have obtained a huge improvement.

“Dragon King, they have destroyed the forces of the divine dragon lineage one after another. I’m afraid that they might target us.”

Prime Minister Gui said from the side.

“It’s possible. However, we don’t have to be anxious. Even if they make a move, it might be to deal with the Water Dragon Palace first.”

Wang Xian said faintly.

Most importantly, the strongest known expert of the Fire Dragon Palace and the Devil Dragon lineage was only a level five universe knight.

With only the combat strength of a level five universe knight, even if they had acquired treasures, Wang Xian was not too worried.

Prime Minister Gui nodded. The resources that the Dragon Palace had obtained this time were not much of a problem for the sky array to have the combat strength of a level six universe knight.

Xiao Lan continued to move through the void. Wang Xian took out the universe AI and browsed through the information about the Fire Dragon Palace and the Devil Dragon lineage.

…

“Roar, Roar, Roar. At least all of you are tactful. Submit to US and avoid death.”

At the same time, in a golden ocean, golden seawater was flowing.

In the middle of the Golden Ocean, a stretch of darkness enveloped the center.

In the entire darkness, the phantom image of the Demon Dragons would fly in from time to time. It was hard to see clearly.

However, the darkness made everyone feel fear and fear.

Under the Golden Ocean covered by the darkness, there was a huge Golden Dragon Palace. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The entire Dragon Palace was shining with golden light.

However, at this moment, a huge fire dragon and the demon dragon were floating beside the dragon throne in the Dragon King’s palace.

In front of them, a group of red-gold battle dragons were crouching down.

In the middle, there was a huge dragon head that was dripping with blood.

It was the head of the red-gold Battle Dragon King, a descendant of the red-gold Battle Dragons.

Although the red-gold Dragon King was not a purebred dragon, he was a peak-level dragon.

But now, the dragon head was cut off.

“Go, bring all the resources in your red-gold Battle Dragon Palace over!”

The Fire Dragon Lord’s eyes flickered with excitement and excitement as he ordered a red gold war dragon expert below.

“Yes, Yes, it’s Your Highness!”

The Red Gold War dragon expert immediately replied and walked towards the back.

Soon, large amounts of dragon blood grass and various resources were transported over.

The Fire Dragon Lord’s eyes stared at those resources, filled with excitement and excitement!

“Hahaha, I want half of the resources, the rest belongs to you, Devil Dragon King.”

The Fire Dragon Lord shouted, he waved his arm to take half of the resources and immediately flew forward.

The Fire Dragon Palace’s high-level dragon species, fire cloud dragon eagle, followed him and flew toward the Scarlet Gold Battle Dragon.

“Hahaha, you guys guard the surroundings!”

The Fire Dragon Lord came to a place and waved his arm to set up a restriction.

He stared at the resources in front of him and trembled slightly.

“Soon, I will become the king of the Lu Xingkong Divine Dragon Bloodline!”

The Fire Dragon Lord roared in a low voice, his eyes shining with a fiery light.

“The fire dragon lord is so excited and anxious. It seems that he is going to break through.”

A faint voice sounded in the dark sky that covered the entire Red Gold War Dragon Palace.

“Yes, father, are you…”

The Demon Dragon King who was in the Dragon King’s palace just now stood respectfully in front of a shadow.
