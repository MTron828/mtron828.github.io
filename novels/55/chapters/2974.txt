Chapter 2975: Becoming a Dragon Knight in 1975? 1

“Reply quickly, Lord Desolation God-emperor, reply quickly!”

Seeing the reply from the three-eyed race, the eight desolation god-emperor experts and the Emperor Lord revealed extremely excited expressions.

“If there is even the slightest bit of deception from the two lords, the two lords can directly kill us!”

The desolation god-emperor did not hesitate at all and directly replied.

“Hu!”

Looking at the words of the divine emperor of desolation and their expressions, Yang Feng and Yang Xiao Hun looked at each other and their breathing became a little hurried.

The Divine Dragon, whether it was tamed and nurtured, sold to experts, or the addiction of being a Dragon Knight, was a fatal attraction to them.

It was a great opportunity.

After obtaining the Divine Dragon, they might be able to soar to the sky, or their lives might change.

“Brother Yang, they have the existence of the divine dragon over there. Should we tell the tribe leader and the others?”

Yang Xiaohun’s eyes were burning as he spoke.

“Don’t tell them for now!”

Yang Feng’s expression changed as he stared at Yang Xiaohun and roared, “We don’t know how big the opportunity this time is. If we tell the tribe, you should know the consequences. Let’s finish investigating first.”

“Okay!”

Yang Xiaohun’s expression changed, and he nodded heavily.

This was an opportunity that belonged to the two of them. Once they told the tribe, with their strength, even if there was a pure-blooded divine dragon there, there would be very few benefits for them.

If they could obtain the treasure there themselves, why would they tell the tribe?

“Our Place is a very remote place. Few people have come here for hundreds or thousands of years. This place is relatively hidden. However, even if this is a remote place of the Mohan clan, the formation here is very powerful. In the past, the Mohan clan had many wizards who were good at formations.”

“Let’s see if we can break the spell formation here!”

Yang Feng looked at the spell formation in front of him, his eyes shining.

“Brother Yang, let me try!”

Yang Xiao Hun’s vertical eye was shining as he spoke.

He took a few steps back, and a light spot condensed in his eyes.

The light spot slowly enlarged, and in the end, it was the size of a fist.

“Boom!”

The next moment, the light spot directly attacked the spell formation in front of them.

“Boom!”

A loud sound was heard.

“Crack Crack Crack!”

In the end, what made the two of them overjoyed was that a crack slowly appeared on the array formation in front of them.

“It’s actually so easy?”

Yang Xiao Hun also said with surprise and joy on his face.

“The Mo Han clan’s race has already been destroyed for hundreds of millions of years. The energy of the array formation has been depleted over time. In addition to the attacks of the group of people on the opposite side.”

Yang Feng pursed his lips and revealed an excited expression in his eyes.

“It’s broken, it’s broken. What powerful strength. He broke the array formation by himself!”

On the opposite side, the desolate divine emperor and the rest saw the cracks appearing on the array formation. Their faces revealed an extremely excited expression as they shouted excitedly.

That Indestructible Array Formation had finally been broken!

“Peng!”

Yang Feng saw that the array formation was so easily forced. He extended his fist and attacked the cracks.

A hole appeared on his arm. The cracks were like glass. He used his hand to create a two-meter-wide entrance.

“Boom!”

At the next moment, the bodies of the two trembled. Their own might erupted. A powerful pressure charged towards the emperor Lord and the experts from the eight barrens.

This was to show them their might and let them know the disparity.

“Boom!”

The Aura that the two of them released caused their faces to instantly turn extremely pale, and their foreheads were instantly filled with cold sweat.

“Lord, we pay our respects to the two Lords!”

They hurriedly knelt on the ground and shouted loudly.

Even though the language between experts wasn’t clear, they could instantly understand what the other party meant through their soul senses.

The desolate god Emperor, Emperor Lord, and the rest were trembling as they knelt there.

An expert was a true expert.

They felt that it was easy for the two people in front of them to destroy them.

In front of the two of them, they did not have the slightest ability to resist.

“Get Up!”

Yang Feng and Yang Xiao Hun stared at them with a satisfied expression on their faces.

“Thank you, Lords. Thank you, Lords!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The Emperor Lord, desolate god Emperor, and the others immediately thanked them and stood up respectfully.

“Is what you said just now true?”

Yang Feng asked them expressionlessly.

“We don’t dare to lie to You, my Lord.”

The emperor Lord, desolate god Emperor, and the others quickly said.

“Bring us to your side and tell us everything!”

The two of them swept their gaze over them and ordered.

“Yes, yes!”

Feeling the majesty from the two of them, especially the pressure from the vertical eye, the emperor lord, desolate god Emperor, and the others did not dare to have any objections.

They led the way and headed towards the temporary residence of all the experts in the eight barrens.

Following the desolate god Emperor and the others, they flew forward and passed by a few special places.

The method of passing through this special place made Yang Feng and Yang Xiaohun extremely surprised. They looked at each other with excitement and vigilance.

This meant that even if someone in the center of the universe discovered that the array formation had been broken, they would still not be able to enter this place.

“Sirs, please. Now that we have been forced by the Dragon Palace faction to live a ignoble life, please help us in the future!”

More than an hour later, they arrived at a secret realm that the disciples of the eight barrens were temporarily staying in. The desolate divine emperor and the Emperor Lord said.

“Dragon Palace?”

Yang Feng and Yang Xiaohun raised their eyebrows and looked at them with puzzlement.

“Sirs, the Dragon Palace is the one that has the divine dragon. They have nine wind divine dragons. They are most likely purebred divine dragons!”

The Emperor Lord said.

“Pure-blooded Divine Dragons!”

Hearing their words, the two of them clenched their fists tightly.

“There aren’t many pure-blooded divine dragons left in the center of the Universe!”

Yang Feng suppressed the excitement in his heart and said.

“The center of the Universe?”

When the Emperor Lord, desolate god Emperor, and the others heard this, they were slightly shocked. It turned out that the opposite side of the eight desolates and six harmonies was really the center of the universe.

“Sirs, I think that the Dragon Palace’s Divine Dragon is a true divine dragon. That Dragon King has obtained the Divine Dragon inheritance.”

The monarch spoke, his eyes filled with hatred.

“Oh?”

The two were shocked and looked at the monarch.

With their strength, they could also see the monarch’s realm. A second level divine emperor was considered a core disciple in their race.

He was able to reach such a realm in this remote place. In their tribe, he was also a genius.

His words might not be right due to his experience, but there was a high possibility that he was right.

“Sirs, please come in. Let’s sit down and tell the two sirs the details!”

The desolate divine emperor said when they arrived at the place where the eight desolate realm’s experts and disciples lived.

The surroundings were unusually crowded due to the small size of this mystic realm.

They attracted the attention of the disciples of the eight barrens when they arrived.

They were also filled with surprise when they saw the human with a vertical eye between his brows.

Their hearts suddenly stirred when they saw how respectful the divine emperor and the others were. Their expressions became excited!
