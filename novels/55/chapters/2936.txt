Chapter 2937: armory imperial region’s treasure 4

“Master, isn’t the geomantic omen of the glazed domain very good? isn’t the glazed domain the number one great domain? With their strength, shouldn’t they be able to easily destroy the chimei domain? What’s going on?”

On the battle platform, invincible battle technique asked Shangshui god-emperor with an embarrassed expression.

At this moment, Shangshui god-emperor’s brows were tightly knitted, and his face was filled with a solemn expression. He looked at invincible battle technique but did not have the mood to scold him.

“According to the investigation carried out by Liu Li, the Chimei region has undergone a huge change. Currently, the Chimei region is extremely dangerous. Our scouts from the Liu Li Region do not dare to continue investigating!”

!!

He said in a deep voice. His expression changed slightly.

His gaze was gloomy as he stared ahead.

In the void ahead, there was an incomparably huge devil cave. Roars could be heard from within the Devil Cave from time to time.

That Demon Cave was the lair of the rank three demonic beast of the void God Emperor.

The huge demon cave stood in the void. The experts of their glass region did not dare to barge in recklessly.

Who would have thought that such a terrifying change would occur in the chimei region? Such a terrifying existence would invade their glass region.

“Teacher, isn’t this glass region too dangerous? They even said that they wanted to invade the chimei region. Now, they haven’t even killed all the demonic beasts in the glass region. If more powerful demonic beasts fly out from the Chimei region, wouldn’t it be another fierce battle? Teacher, I think it’s better for us to leave this place!”

Invincible in battle whispered to his master.

The god Emperor of Shangshui looked at him and didn’t say anything.

“Qingshan!”

At this time, a voice came from the side. The first Supreme Elder flew over.

“First Supreme Elder!”

The god Emperor of Shangshui nodded.

“It’s the time of calamity!”

The first Supreme Elder came to the side of the god Emperor of Shangshui and sighed.

“Yeah, who would have thought that it would be like this!”

Shangshui divine emperor sighed slightly. The sudden appearance of the demon cave in front of them had disrupted all their plans.

“Now that the group of demons are hiding in the demon cave, we don’t have any good ideas and don’t dare to rush in recklessly.”

Grand Supreme Elder frowned slightly and pondered for a moment. He looked at invincible and said, “Invincible, have you contacted the Dragon King recently?”

“HMM? I have, but I haven’t. The Dragon Palace should be wreaking havoc in the armory royal territory now!”

Invincible said with a smile.

“It has been more than three months since the Dragon Palace left for the armory royal territory. If there is a strong suppressive force, the Dragon Palace should be able to come back by now. Why hasn’t it come back yet?”

Grand Supreme Elder frowned slightly as he said this.

“With the strength of the Dragon Palace, there shouldn’t be any problems. Boss Wang and the others are very strong!”

Invincible in battle replied without thinking too much.

“If the Dragon Palace can return, we can also ask the Dragon King and the others for help.”

The first Supreme Elder said slightly. He looked at the demon cave in front of him with a hint of worry on his face.

Things were developing in the direction that their glazed domain could not control.

Time passed day by day again.

On the side of the glazed domain, the huge devil lair stood in the Void. All the experts and soldiers in the glazed domain could not do anything about it.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

Ten days later, behind the huge devil lair, within the chimei domain, terrifying roars were emitted.

Under the shocked gazes of everyone in the glazed domain, three more incomparably huge devil lairs flew out from the chimei domain.

Along with them were countless terrifying demonic beasts.

The one leading them was also a level three void God realm existence.

…

“This fellow is simply too vigilant. The reconnaissance warplane has searched him three times.”

“It has been more than a month!”

Wang Xian did not know what happened in the glazed domain. At this moment, Wang Xian had followed the creator for a total of more than three months.

Over the past three months, Wang Xian had witnessed what it meant to be vigilant and what it meant to be foolproof.

If not for his powerful concealment ability, he would have been discovered already.

Once he was discovered, Wang Xian was certain that the creator would abandon the mechanical heart and transfer his information out directly.

The reason why he was so vigilant in hiding in the void for more than three months also meant that the mechanical heart was of great use to him.

Staring at the mechanical heart in front of him, Wang Xian was prepared to fight it out with him.

“I’ve scouted a radius of more than a trillion kilometers without any trace of being followed. Now, I can go back in peace!”

“Dragon King, you guys have made my creator so miserable. One day, I Will Make Your Dragon Palace pay the price!”

At this moment, the creator in front of him roared with a somewhat sinister voice. He controlled the mechanical heart to fly in a direction at a rapid speed.

“HMM? The speed has increased. He is heading in a certain direction. Could it be that he is heading to his hidden base?”

Wang Xian’s face lit up as he followed behind carefully.

Soon, a rather chaotic area appeared in front of him.

Numerous meteorites covered the entire void. It was chaotic inside.

There were barren planets and continental plates.

In the middle, there was an incomparably huge forest.

This was a very special forest. The forest was dead silent and there were no living beings.

The creator flew into the forest. After flying for half an hour, Wang Xian saw him entering the soil of the forest. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Looks like this is the place!”

Wang Xian was delighted and immediately followed behind him. The Dragon Eyes of the Yin-yang five elements penetrated through the soil and stared at the creator.

“TSK, TSK, tsk. I Can’t believe that he is in a void crack in the soil of this forest. Such a secretive defense. If I didn’t follow him, I would never be able to find this place.”

Wang Xian mumbled and moved slightly at the spot where the creator disappeared.

Huala

A void crack appeared in front of him and Wang Xian entered it directly.

At the same time, he waved his arm and released the Heaven Array from the mother nest.

“This is?”

After the Heaven Array came out, he scanned his surroundings and revealed a shocked expression.

“I really didn’t expect this creator to have such a backup plan!”

Wang Xian looked at the position below in shock.

The position below was a special world. Numerous huge machinery factories stood in the crack in the void.

At the center was a metal castle.

Around the castle, there were five huge battle armors floating.

It was an ocean of machinery and a world of machinery.

“Fortunately, my creator left me a way out. Wait for my revenge!”

At the center of the castle, the Creator’s mechanical heart flew to the central hall. He looked at the three-meter-long steel body sitting on the throne in front of him. His heart was beating excitedly.

“My second body. If it weren’t for the fact that I only have one energy to drive my body, the machine emperor domain would have two level three divine emperors. I would have destroyed the glazed domain and received a huge upgrade!”

“Damn it. One day, I will destroy the glazed domain and the Dragon Palace!”
