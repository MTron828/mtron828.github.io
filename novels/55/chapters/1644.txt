Chapter 1645: Among the distinguished guests of the 1645 clan

Wang Xian nodded his head and sat there quietly.

It was obvious that this elder named fiery light didn’t know his identity. It was also possible that he didn’t know that their empress was still alive.

“Clap Clap Clap!”

At this moment, a group of more than a thousand people walked in from the entrance of the Fire Cloud Hall.

“Everyone from the Sacred Fire clan, please take a seat at the side. Our clan elder will be here soon!”

Upon seeing their arrival, fiery light hurriedly greeted them.

“I say, we are from the fire Lark clan. We are here to help you. Why didn’t you prepare to welcome us in advance?”

The two elders who were walking in front revealed displeased expressions as they spoke to fiery light directly.

“I’m sorry, everyone. Please wait for a moment. We will be here soon. Please take a seat!”

Fiery Light pointed at the seat behind Wang Xian with a smile and gestured.

“Are you asking our elders to sit behind a young man?”

“What is the meaning of this?”

Some of the middle-aged men from the sacred flame clan were slightly stunned when they saw fiery light asking their two elders to sit behind him.

One of them frowned and spoke directly.

They were here to help the sacred flame clan. Now, a random kid came over and was treated better than them.

What was the meaning of this?

Were they looking down on them?

“No need, we’ll just stand here!”

A hint of displeasure flashed through the eyes of the two elders of the sacred flame clan as they replied coldly.

Fiery light pursed his lips and didn’t speak.

It wasn’t that they didn’t welcome him warmly, but that an even more mysterious guest had arrived.

Seeing that fiery light didn’t speak anymore, the expressions of the sacred flame clan’s members became even more unsightly.

Some of the sacred fire clan members whispered to each other with displeased expressions.

“Boom!”

Ten minutes later, just as the sacred fire clan members were feeling impatient, a special fluctuation suddenly appeared.

Everyone in the Fire Cloud Hall was slightly startled, and the Sacred Fire clan members hurriedly shut their mouths.

“Buzz!”

Over ten figures appeared in the middle of the hall.

When the two elders of the Sacred Fire clan saw this person, they were shocked and revealed a faint smile on their faces.

The Patriarch of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan had personally welcomed them. It could be considered as giving them enough face.

All the displeasure from before had disappeared.

“Elder Fire Cloud...”

“I didn’t expect young master Wang to come. Before the rock, please welcome everyone from the Sacred Fire clan!”

“Young master Wang, let’s talk inside!”

Patriarch Fengyun turned towards Wang Xian.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded and took two steps towards Fengyun’s position.

“Let’s Go!”

Fengyun nodded. With a wave of her arm, she brought Wang Xian and disappeared into the fire cloud hall.

The two elders from the Sacred Fire clan were stunned. They didn’t even greet Wang Xian.

The rest of the members from the Sacred Fire clan were even more stunned.

Patriarch Firecloud wasn’t here to welcome them, but that youth.

What was that youth’s identity?

“Brothers of the Sacred Fire clan, thank you for your support this time!”

At this moment, the only elder of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan who remained thanked everyone from the Sacred Fire clan.

His words made the faces of everyone from the Sacred Fire clan turn ugly.

Any random young man could make Patriarch Fire Cloud come over personally to receive them.

And they, on the other hand, were abnormally cold towards him.

They were from the Sacred Fire clan of the Phoenix Dynasty, the founding general clan of the Phoenix Dynasty!

Now, they came over to help them, yet they received such treatment.

This made everyone from the Sacred Fire clan slightly indignant!

“I wonder who that young man was, to actually be able to make patriarch fire cloud personally receive him!”

The two elders of the Sacred Fire clan asked coldly with gloomy faces.

Huo Yan was slightly stunned before shaking his head. “I don’t know either. Our Fire Cloud Sparrow clan has already prepared a feast to entertain everyone!”

...

“Young Master Wang!”

“Greetings, young master Wang!”

At this moment, fifty kilometers away, in a fire cloud palace on Fire Cloud Mountain.

This fire cloud palace was the core of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan. Anyone who could enter this place must be a member of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan.

In a room that was not very big, Feng Yun bowed respectfully to Wang Xian.

More than a dozen figures beside her bowed directly to show their respect.

Among them, five of them had already reached the half-step realm of longevity.

However, at this moment, all of them were staring at Wang Xian with fervent eyes.

As the core elders of the fire Lark clan, they were naturally very clear about the Empress’s matters.

Especially the dragon and Phoenix Empire that the Empress had established, it made them feel extremely excited.

Why did their fire Lark clan fight to the death with the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop? wasn’t it because of the Empress’s foundation.

Even if they had to die, they wouldn’t hesitate.

And this young man in front of them was the Empress’s strongest pillar of support.

Even the fire Lark clan couldn’t help the empress reach this step so quickly.

In just four years, they helped the Empress establish a dynasty and empire, reaching the point where she could dominate the vast region.

Even if this person in front of them was not as strong as them, they would not hesitate to ask them to kneel down.

Moreover, from their point of view, this young master Wang was very terrifying.

Four years ago, they learned that this young master Wang’s strength was only at the extraordinary realm. Now, he was at the ninth level of the Seethrough void tier. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

It was probably only a matter of time before longevity in front of this young master Wang.

“You don’t have to be so polite!”

Wang Xian smiled slightly when he saw their respectful expressions.

“Young master Wang, please take a seat!”

Feng Yun pointed at the main seat in the middle and said to Wang Xian.

“Haha, I Can’t take up this position yet. Let’s wait for a while. Senior Feng Yun, please take a seat!”

Wang Xian sat at the side and said to Feng Yun, “Senior Feng Yun, the main reason why I’m here is for the matter of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan!”

“Can you tell me about the current situation of the Fire Cloud Sparrow Clan?”

“Yes, Alright!”

Feng Yun nodded and sat on the main seat. “The current situation is not good for our fire cloud sparrow clan!”

“Especially the Sacred Fire clan, which has caused our fire cloud sparrow clan to be in a passive and dangerous situation!”

Feng Yun frowned.

“The Sacred Fire Clan?”

Wang Xian looked at Feng Yun, who he had met four years ago. She looked much older now and asked in puzzlement.

“That’s right, the Sacred Fire clan!”

Feng Yun nodded. “Back then, the reason why our Fire Cloud Sparrow clan dared to fight against the life and death pill workshop and the forging workshop of the sacred items was because of the Sacred Fire clan!”

“Our Fire Cloud Sparrow clan was the protector of the Empress of the Phoenix dynasty at that time. The Sacred Fire clan was the founding general of the Phoenix Dynasty!”

“Once, when I was fighting with the empress, I saved the life of the Patriarch of the Sacred Fire clan, as well as the lives of many members of the Sacred Fire clan. She once said that she owed me a life, and our relationship was quite good!”

“She is still the founding general of the Phoenix Dynasty. If this crisis were to happen, she would be willing to take action. With the influence of the Phoenix dynasty, the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop wouldn’t dare to kill us!”

“But...”
