“What... What’s going on, how can there be so many warriors in the Dragon Palace?”

“Hiss, what’s going on, how can there suddenly be so many warriors, the 5 of them are undying level 7? How is that possible!”

“How can there suddenly be so many warriors in the Dragon Palace, are they waiting for the Warriors from the Sky Mountain Sword sect to come?”

“What are they doing? They came prepared, a month ago they were still trapped outside, how can they be here now...”

“Look at this strange space, it can block US FROM RETURNING TO THE UNDYING COUNTRY!”

The strange space completely enveloped the entire planet, some of the bystanders were also trapped within!

When they saw the warriors of the Dragon Palace appear, the shock in their hearts was no less than the warriors of the Sky Mountain Sword sect!

There were 5 Level 7 undyings rushing out, this... With such strength, how could they still be blocked at the entrance of the planet a month ago?

With such strength, the other planets still dared to seal the Dragon Palace?

“Dragon Palace, I didn’t expect you to hide your strength, you think that with 5 undyings, we are afraid of You!”

“When the other three emperors of our Sky Mountain Sword sect arrive, you will pay the price!”

An elder from the Sky Mountain Sword Sect’s expression changed, roaring with a dark expression!

“Hehe, do you think the other warriors of Your Sky Mountain Sword sect can come and save you?”

Ao Qi looked at them with a face full of mockery, “Don’t worry, on the road to the Underworld, you will accompany us!”

“What?”

“Hehe, this little trick to shake the morale of the Army is really childish. Do you think your Dragon Palace wants to kill us?”

An elder of the Sky Mountain Sword sect said with a cold face!

“Not only do we want to kill you, but we also want to kill the ninth-grade heaven sect, Demon Slayer sect, three seas sect, Black Forest Group, and Jianhua Group. Don’t worry, you won’t Feel Lonely!”

Ao Xingmu floated in the air and said indifferently!

“Don’t worry, we have plenty of time to chat with you. Why don’t we let you wait and see if there are any experts to support you later?”

Ao qitian held the ocean-pacifying needle and said coldly!

“You...”

The two Sky Mountain Sword sect patriarchs’expressions were uncertain. They were not sure of their words!

“Is... is this true?”

“It could be true, the ninth grade Sky sect business planet was also attacked!”

“Does the Dragon Palace really have so many warriors to deal with the six powers? If they had the strength, why didn’t they act earlier?”

The surrounding warriors that were enveloped in the black hole space disturbance array heard these words, their faces filled with shock and suspicion!

“Kill them!”

Below, a group of Dragon Palace members locked onto more than 100 Sky Mountain Sword sect undying fighters and attacked again!

A completely suppressive force, under such a situation, the Sky Mountain Sword sect warriors were all killed within 10 minutes!

“Shit!”

“Stop!”

The two Sky Mountain Sword sect ancestors’expressions changed!

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

However, as soon as they finished speaking, AO qitian and the others rushed over!

“Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!”

The eyes of the two elders of the Sky Mountain Sword sect focused as they clenched their teeth and roared furiously!

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The extremely powerful nomological power caused the void to tremble!

The expressions of everyone in the black hole changed drastically!

“Break the array!”

Suddenly, at the center, a Sky Mountain Sword sect patriarch roared!

“Sou!”

A figure flew up into the sky, his gaze fixed on the strange array!

The two Sky Mountain Sword Sect Patriarchs knew that the five undying godly king level 7 warriors from the Dragon Palace and the other godly kings were no match for them!

If they continued fighting, they would definitely die!

Hence, they could only escape!

Break the array and escape!

When the Dragon Palace warriors were caught off guard, they rushed out to attack the array!

“An elder of the Sky Mountain Sword sect wants to break the array!”

“Break it, I feel unsafe in this strange array!”

The surrounding godly monarchs said softly!

“Ah!”

...

At the next moment, a desperate scream suddenly sounded!

“What?”

Everyone looked in shock as they stared at the sky!

In the sky, a black and white shadow appeared behind the Sky Mountain Sword Sect’s patriarch!

The black and white shadow’s claws pierced through his body, causing his body to stiffen in the void!

The Sky Mountain Sword Sect’s patriarch widened his eyes, filled with shock and disbelief!

Large amounts of blood spewed out of his mouth, his life force quickly dissipating!

“Hehe, you still want to destroy the array and escape!”

Below, AO qitian and the others laughed scornfully!

He desperately wanted to break the array, instead giving Ao Yao who had been hiding in space a chance to assassinate him!

“This... How Can Your Dragon Palace have so many undying level 7 warriors, to kill us, you actually sent a total of six!”

Another elder from the Sky Mountain Sword sect stared wide eyed, his face filled with fear as he roared!

One of his good brothers had been killed, and the Dragon Palace had sent a total of 6 undying level 7 warriors, following which, he didn’t even have the strength to defend!

Such a huge gap made him feel despair!

“Even if I die, I will drag some down with me!”

His eyes were slowly covered with blood. He stared at the place below and moved, wanting to kill the other godly king experts of the Dragon Palace!

“We are all here. If we let you kill the other members, you will be slapping yourself in the face!”

Ao Xingmu waved his arm and thorns blocked his attack and path. They stared at him coldly!

“Kill him, don’t waste time!”

Ao Qi Tian said indifferently, rushing over!

“No No, I can’t accept this!”

The Sky Mountain Sword sect patriarch roared angrily!

However, what greeted him was Ao Qi Tian and the rest’s violent attacks!

30 seconds later, Ao Yao’s figure appeared behind him!

Sky Mountain Sword sect patriarch was dead!

Ao Qi Tian and the rest looked down at the battle that was still going on, the ocean pacifying needle in their hands swept out!

In less than 10 seconds, the battle below had completely ended!

Over 100 undying emperors had all died here!

“Remove the array, prepare to take over Tian Shan sword sect’s Planet!”

Ao xing mu scanned the surroundings and said to the fire hammer patriarch!

“Hehe, good!”

The patriarch smiled and nodded, waving his arm and the array completely dissipated!

“Hiss... this... this... is the Sky Mountain Sword sect going to be finished?”

Everyone around looked at this scene in disbelief!

At this moment, on the planet where the Sky Mountain Sword sect was located, a formation enveloped it. Not long after, the formation slowly disappeared!

The planet where the Sky Mountain Sword sect was located had already turned into a mess. In the middle of a deep pit, there were three corpses lying there!

In the middle of the crater, there was a blood sword beside him. He was the sword King!

The arrogant, violent, and powerful sword King!
