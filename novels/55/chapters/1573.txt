Chapter 1574: 1574. In the midst of the Ice Heart Empire’s betrayal

“In the heavens and the earth, only I reign supreme. How Domineering!”

In the surroundings, some of the youths who had come to the ruins of the Solitaire Sect’s divine kingdom for the first time looked at the two stone pillars that were 500 meters tall with faces full of shock.

The eight large words on them were filled with wildness and wildness. They contained an aura of only I reign supreme.

“Ninth prince, Princess Jian ‘er, Sir Sage, let’s go and register first!”

At the back, more than a dozen young men walked forward and spoke to Wang Xian and the rest. They immediately walked in.

“For this martial arts competition, anyone under the age of 150 can participate. However, the competition is divided into two zones. One is a young man under the age of 50, and the other is above the age of 50!”

“Those at the insightful void level can skip the earlier stages of the competition and participate in the later stages of the competition directly!”

Ling Jian ‘er explained to Wang Xian from the side.

“Alright, let’s go in and take a look!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. He looked at his surroundings with a curious expression and walked in.

The martial arts competition that was held once every two years by the Solitaire sect was definitely not something that could be compared to the selection of disciples from some empires or second-rate forces.

As one of the three super forces in the vast region, the competition venue was extremely grand.

In the middle of two mountains that were four to five thousand meters tall, there were many arenas floating in the sky. There were more than ten thousand arenas around them.

At the front, there were many huge seats floating in the sky.

“Come, let’s fly over to the front!”

The ninth Prince’s expression was not too good. He squeezed out a smile and said to Wang Xian and the rest.

“Okay!”

The group of people from the Bingxin Empire flew over and headed to the front.

As the Bingxin Empire was closer to the Solitaire sect, their position was at the right of the Solitaire sect.

The group of people flew over. Wang Xian, Ling Jian ‘er, Wu Qing Cheng, and the rest sat in the center while Bing Jinghuan sat at the side with a gloomy face.

Looking over, there were many young men filled with fighting spirit in the huge arena.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom

Not long after they sat down, terrifying auras rushed over from afar.

Feeling the overwhelming aura, the hundreds of thousands of people around quieted down.

Everyone looked over in awe.

Hundreds of figures flew over quickly.

The two elders in the lead were at the seventh level of the profound void tier and the two elders of the Solitaire sect.

Around them were deacons and disciples. There were disciples participating in the competition as well as disciples watching the battle.

The most eye-catching ones were the three people beside the two elders.

Two of them were the two Peerless Heaven’s favorites of Solitaire. In the center of them was a middle-aged man.

Compared to the two heaven’s and Earth’s favorites who wore golden crowns, the middle-aged man in the center was even more high-profile.

He had a handsome face, long hair, and a resplendent crown on his head. In the center of the Crown, there were four resplendent golden words, supreme heaven.

He looked down arrogantly in front of him, as if he didn’t care about this world.

“The middle-aged man in the middle of the two heaven’s favorites is called Ao Tian. He is the son of the Supreme Leader of our sect. He is in his 130s and has the cultivation of the fifth level of the Seethrough Void Tier!”

“He is highly regarded by the powerhouses of our sect. There is a high possibility that he could reach the ninth level of the Seethrough Void Tier!”

Wu Qingcheng saw Wang Xian looking at the middle-aged man and whispered to him.

“Oh? He is only at the fifth level of the Seethrough void tier in his 130s. He is even weaker than you!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and said with a smile.

“Hehe, of course, he can’t be compared to priest Wang and us!”

Wu Qingcheng smiled. His current strength had already broken through to level four of the Seethrough realm. He was extremely confident that he would be able to break through to level one or even level two in the next few decades.

The members of the solipsistic sect flew towards the seats that were floating in the air at the front.

“Eh? The crown prince of Wuqing City from Wuji Empire is here. Ao Tian, go and entertain him!”

Two elders of the seventh level of the Seethrough realm sat in the middle. One of the elders scanned the area and immediately sent a voice transmission to ao Tian when he realized that Wuqing city was here!

“The one beside him should be priest Wang, who is currently in the limelight. Go and greet him too!”

The other elder looked over and shifted his gaze to Wang Xian.

“Oh? Wu Qing city is here? And the Saint of Light?”

Ao Tian, who was emitting a domineering aura, looked over. His eyes were sparkling.

“Let’s go and pay our respects!”

He swept his gaze across the two heaven’s pride experts in the sky and earth beside him and said faintly.

The Crown Prince of Wuji Empire and the Saint of light who was at level seven of the Seethrough void stage. Even Ao Shi Ling Yun from their sect would follow the proper etiquette.

“That D * MN Guy!”

When the two heaven’s pride experts saw Wang Xian, hatred appeared on their faces.

“If you have the ability, you can kill priest Wang directly. If you don’t have the ability, forget it!”

Ao Tian sensed the anger of the two heaven’s pride experts and said calmly.

“Senior brother, we know that one day, we will kill him!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The two heaven’s favorites took a deep breath and hid their killing intent as they spoke in a deep voice.

“Okay!”

Ao Tian nodded his head. His figure moved as he looked at Wang Xian and Wu Qing city.

“Priest Wang, Wu Qing city. I didn’t expect the two of you to come to our exclusive venue!”

Ao Tian had a faint smile on his face as he shouted at them.

“Eh? The crown prince of Wu Qing city is here? The sage is here too?”

“There, I didn’t expect the crown prince and priest Wang to be here!”

Everyone around was slightly shocked and quickly looked over. When they saw their figures, their faces were filled with respect and reverence.

“Hehe, accompany priest Wang to take a look!”

Wu Qing Cheng saw them flying over and stood up with a smile.

“This must be pastor Wang Xian of the saint of light. I’ve heard so much about him.”

Ao tian sized up Wang Xian and said faintly.

“I’ve heard so much about you!”

Wang Xian also looked at him and said faintly.

“Haha, I’ve heard so much about you. I hope pastor Wang Won’t Bully My Junior Brothers!”

As Ao Tian spoke, he glanced at the two heaven’s pride experts beside him.

“I won’t offend anyone if they don’t offend me. I don’t have the habit of provoking others!”

Wang Xian smiled.

“HMPH, just you wait. One day, we will use your blood to avenge ourselves!”

When the two heaven’s pride experts heard Wang Xian’s words, the killing intent in their eyes was completely released. They growled coldly in a low voice.

Wang Xian could feel the killing intent from their bodies. His pupils contracted slightly as he looked at ao Tian indifferently. “Your junior brother is courting death!”

A warning sounded, causing everyone from the bingxin empire to hold their breaths. Bing Jinghuan’s eyes flickered.

Ao Tian also contracted slightly when he heard Wang Xian’s question. A hint of coldness flashed in his eyes.

“Ao Tian, are you bringing people here to cause trouble? Is this the way of treating guests of your only sect?”

Wu Qing Cheng looked at this scene and said with a faint frown.
