The Underground Demon Cave City, just like its name, was a city located underground!

Although it was called a city, it was actually more like a maze.

Tunnels were dug out from the underground. There were many demon skeletons living in these tunnels.

These tunnels were densely intersected. Once one entered deep, it would be extremely difficult to break out from above.

Therefore, no one who dared to enter deep into the city was weak.

Furthermore, due to the complexity of the interior, it was very easy for one to get lost in it. If one wanted to return, most of them would have to return to their own divine kingdom.

Wang Xian’s first target was this place. He wanted to see if he could hunt down some demon skeletons.

The information he bought from the spiritual demon race contained 70% of the routes of the underground demon cave city.

As long as he didn’t go beyond the route on this map, he couldn’t get lost.

Other than these, a certain location was more dangerous and a certain location was safer.

After flying for half a month in the land of the demon bones, Wang Xian finally arrived at the location of the Underground Demon Cave City.

This was a huge, sunken land with dried bones. Below it, there were many huge entrances.

There were more than ten thousand entrances. Each entrance led to a different place. Some of the entrances would connect to each other as they went deeper.

All in all, this place was extremely complicated.

Even if it was an expert with the combat strength of a Master of the universe, he would still get lost inside without a map.

Wang Xian recalled the map route in his mind. His body moved and he flew towards the entrance of the cave.

The land of the demonic bones was extremely dangerous.

Not only would one have to face the demonic skeletons, but there would also be other cultivators as well.

Let alone the land of the demonic bones, it was normal for them to hunt each other as long as it was not a safe city or the interior of the race.

After Wang Xian entered the cave, he felt that it was dark inside. His surroundings were densely packed with withered bones.

Regardless of whether it was above or below, a timid person would be terrified if they were here.

There were all kinds of skeletons. There were humans, demonic beasts, space beasts, and everything else.

Wang Xian flew into the depths quickly. There were many strong people entering the border every day. It was impossible for there to be any demonic skeletons.

The powerful demonic skeletons were all located in the depths.

“This terrain is really complicated. There are still dead ends in some places.”

Wang Xian shuttled through the place and entered deep into his mind according to the memories in his mind.

He had only entered for more than ten minutes and had already encountered more than ten forks!

As he continued to delve deeper, it was possible that the demonic skeleton could sense the palpitating energy from Wang Xian’s body. He did not suffer any attacks along the way.

Wang Xian only stopped when he reached the location where the map in his mind was on alert.

“According to the information of the spiritual demon race, I’m afraid that the deeper I go, the more dangerous it will be. There are demonic skeletons that are above the peak of the universe knight level there. I must be careful. Even a master of the universe at level one or level two might die here.”

Wang Xian mumbled. His eyes flickered and a shadow that looked exactly like him appeared beside him.

The Ghost Avatar appeared beside him.

The ghost avatar ignored physical attacks. Unless the attack of the demon skeleton contained attributes, it wouldn’t be able to cause any damage.

In the land of the demon bones, the ghost avatar still had many advantages.

The demonic skeleton and the skeleton in the land of demonic bones were good at physical attacks. This was because their bodies had been hardened by the passage of time and had become terrifyingly tough.

On the contrary, they were much weaker in the use of attributes.

Other than that, the netherworld ghost could hide inside the dry bones and ignore the impact of the dry bones.

Therefore, the Netherworld Ghost was very suitable for this place.

Wang Xian controlled the ghost of the dead to fly in front while his dark pupils scanned his surroundings.

The ghost of the dead was not weak. Coupled with the fact that it did not have a physical body, it was a great counter to the demonic skeleton.

The ghost of the dead continued to move forward while Wang Xian watched from behind.

Very soon, the surrounding scenery changed a little. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

In this area, a large skeleton appeared.

A skeleton that was hundreds of thousands of meters in size was supporting a space.

The huge head stared at a certain spot, looking a little scary.

“Whoosh!”

When the ghost in front of him arrived at the location of the huge skeleton, a black spear attacked the ghost.

That terrifying speed instantly arrived above the ghost’s head.

“Buzz!”

The ghost raised his head and formed a defense.

A wisp of black energy was easily blocked by him. However, the long spear pierced through the body of the Hell’s Ghost Avatar.

Although the long spear pierced through, it didn’t have any effect on the Hell’s Ghost Avatar.

“A level one demon skeleton with the combat strength of a universe dominator.”

Wang Xian was delighted when he saw this scene. The Hell’s ghost’s body instantly flew upwards.

Whoosh

Above him, a demonic skeleton instantly flew towards the skeleton in the sky.

In the sky, there was a complicated cave. Clearly, it had prepared an escape route.

However, the speed of the ghost of the dead was faster. Furthermore, it ignored the collision of objects. Its arms turned into dragon claws and clawed towards him.

“Crack Crack Crack!”

The sound of bones colliding could be heard from the demonic skeleton. It wanted to escape.

However, the dragon claws wrapped around it and the power of darkness restrained it, making it unable to break free.

Crash

At this moment, Wang Xian’s figure flew over at a terrifying speed and grabbed the demonic skeleton directly!

“The first one, not bad, not bad!”

A look of pleasant surprise appeared on his face. This kind of demonic skeleton only needed to capture a dozen more before the tai chi dragon plate could break through.

“Let’s continue!”

After witnessing the benefits of the Netherworld Ghost, Wang Xian continued to explore the area ahead.

The passages inside were densely packed. From time to time, more than a dozen forks would appear.

Based on the map in his mind, he identified a place and continued to go deeper.

“Eh, this is? A human-headed grass!”

After traveling for two days in the depths, Wang Xian suddenly discovered a treasure.

It was a divine herb of the second level of the Master of the universe, the human-headed grass.

The so-called human-headed grass was relatively rare in the land of demonic bones.

It was a divine herb that grew on a withered skull. This kind of divine herb might contain the laws of the dead or some cultivation insights.

Similarly, it also contained a huge amount of energy.

This kind of human-headed grass was very popular among the strong. Its value was more than three times that of divine herbs of the same level.

“I didn’t expect to be so lucky to encounter a human-headed grass. However, there should be a demonic skeleton guarding the area.”

Wang Xian mumbled as his dragon eyes scanned his surroundings warily.

He controlled the Netherworld Ghost and flew in the direction of the human-headed grass. At the same time, he was vigilant of his surroundings.

Crackle! Crackle

When the Netherworld Ghost was still extremely far away from the human-headed grass, bolts of lightning suddenly descended and completely covered the Netherworld Ghost.

The Dark Ghost’s avatar moved and directly sank into the dry bones below.

The power of the Lightning fell on the top of the dry bones without any injury.

The special body of the dark ghost allowed it to be like a fish in water here.

At the very least, if it wanted to escape, it could ignore the terrain.

Unless the surrounding dry bones contained energy or there was a formation around them.

“What the Hell Is this thing? How can it directly drill into the dry bones? Be careful.”

A voice suddenly sounded.
