Chapter 969: 0970 took his revenge

Translator: 549690339

Wang Xian came out from the higher-ups of the Demon Hunters Academy with a faint smile on his face.

Dean Xia and the rest didn’t tell him too much. They only hoped that he would be able to help when the Academy’s honor was at stake in the future.

Naturally, Wang Xian agreed readily.

No matter what, the Demon Hunters Academy gave a genius like him a lot of convenience.

For example, he had the freedom to attend classes. He could go whenever he wanted. He could cultivate freely in the attribute tower. There was also a house outside the school.

It gave him a lot of freedom.

Wang Xian was very satisfied with this. He didn’t interfere with his freedom and gave him a lot of convenience.

“Let’s go back to the Learning Field First!”

The instructions from Wang Xian Academy were directed to the learning field in the future.

The Learning Field was divided into two categories: knowledge and combat. The knowledge category was the understanding of various ferocious beasts and demonic beasts.

Understanding their weaknesses, habits, attacking methods, and so on were very important to every member of the mercenary group.

Grade One, class three.

Wang Xian looked at the sign in front of a huge building and walked in.

When he arrived at the door, he realized that there were no teachers inside.

More than 90 students were sitting inside. Each of them was holding a communication stone tray in their hands as they chatted excitedly.

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the entire learning field. It was about two to three thousand square meters and there were several arenas inside.

At the front of the Learning Field were chairs with a group of freshmen sitting on them.

Wang Xian took a glance and walked straight inside.

“PA PA!”

The noisy room suddenly quieted down. All the students looked at Wang Xian in unison.

Wang Xian’s expression didn’t change. He went to the last seat and sat down.

“This student, this is the communication stone plate issued by the school. It belongs to our demon Hunters Academy. Teacher Yuan asked me to pass it to you!”

At this moment, a female student who was sitting in the middle walked over and handed him a communication stone plate.

“HMM? Thank you!”

Wang Xian nodded and took the stone plate. He revealed a curious expression on his face.

“Alright, everyone is here. The instructor asked us to choose the temporary leader of the class. Now, who is willing to compete for this position?”

After the girl handed the stone plate to Wang Xian, she said to everyone.

“Let me do it!”

A young man stood up with a proud expression on his face. “Duan Qingwen has the strength of an extraordinary stage three. It is sufficient for him to be the leader of Class Three!”

“Huh?”

The rest of the students frowned slightly when they saw Duan Qingwen standing up and speaking proudly.

Duan Qingwen was a rather high-profile person. Many people in the class did not have a good first impression of him.

However, his strength was very strong.

“Students, do you have any objections?”

The corner of Duan Qingwen’s mouth curled up slightly as he scanned his surroundings.

Some of the students hesitated for a moment before looking at Wang Xian’s position.

Among the freshmen this year, Wang Xian was known by everyone.

He defeated a senior of the young master’s mercenary group without giving any face to the young master’s mercenary group.

Moreover, they had just received a piece of news on the communication stone plate.

In the class, he was the only one who could match up to Duan Qingwen.

“I’m not interested!”

Wang Xian raised his head and took a glance. Then, he lowered his head and opened the communication stone plate.

“So cold and arrogant!”

“So Cool!”

The surrounding students whispered when they saw Wang Xian’s cold expression.

“It’s good that you’re not interested. This student, you should think about how to get through this difficult situation first!”

Duan Qingwen looked at Wang Xian and grinned. Then, he said in a slightly mocking tone.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and looked at Duan Qingwen.

“Fellow student, take a look at the school forum on the communication stone tablet. You are in trouble!”

At this moment, a young man beside him whispered to Wang Xian.

“Oh?”

Wang Xian looked at the communication stone tablet and opened the forum.

It was similar to the Forum on the computer on Earth.

“The five members of the young master’s mercenary group were publicly humiliated by a newbie. One of them wanted to make a move but was defeated immediately. It’s such a disgrace!”

“Awesome Newbie. Today, the young master’s mercenary group is really a disgrace!”

“Haha, this is really interesting. They can’t even defeat a newbie. The members of the young master’s mercenary group are really useless!”

The thread was all about the fight between Wang Xian and the young master’s mercenary group not long ago.

There was another thread in the middle of the thread.

“A kid who thinks he has some ability dares to provoke our young master’s mercenary group. In the future, beat that kid up in school and collect 10,000 middle-grade spirit stones directly from the young master’s mercenary group!”

“In the future, there will be no place for that kid in the Demon Hunters Academy!”

Two lines of words. The person who posted the thread was a member of the young master’s mercenary group.

Upon seeing this thread, Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly. A hint of coldness could be seen on his face.

“Haha, this kid is going to be in trouble. beating him up for 10,000 medium-grade spirit stones is equivalent to killing two extraordinary fourth-grade ferocious beasts!”

“A freshman dares to provoke the young master’s mercenary group. I think it’s better for him to apologize now. Otherwise, he will be beaten up every day in the future!”

“Nouveau riche, the people in the young master’s mercenary group are really nouveau riche. Speaking of a freshman, we senior students can only make a move after getting the kid’s consent. Otherwise, it’ll violate the school rules!”

“The freshmen can make a move, but this kid’s strength isn’t weak among the freshmen. He can be ranked in the top few!”

The entire post had several thousand replies. Most of them were gloating.

Many students were gloating over the fact that the young master’s mercenary group was humiliated by a new student.

However, when they saw the young master’s mercenary group taking out spirit stones to deal with Wang Xian, many of them rubbed their hands together.

Beating up 10,000 middle-grade spirit stones was not a small amount.

Many of them were rubbing their hands.

Wang Xian looked at the information on the communication stone plate and a cold expression appeared on his face. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

He then looked at the other information on the communication stone plate.

There was a ranking of the Demon Hunter College’s mercenary group!

A ranking of the Demon Hunter College’s strength!

A ranking of the Demon Hunter College’s points!

There were three rankings, followed by the Demon Hunter College’s mission.

The young master’s mercenary group was ranked sixth in the Demon Hunter College. The Gold one-star mercenary group had 48 members.

The founder’s strength had reached extraordinary level five!

“Golden one-star, transcendent level five?”

Wang Xian was a little disdainful as he continued to search for other information.

“Alright, since no one has any objections, I shall be the leader of class three, the leader of Class Three!”

“Let’s introduce ourselves first.”

Duan Qingwen’s voice sounded in the learning field.

At this moment, another communication stone tablet from Wang Xian vibrated.

“Eh? All the resources have been sold. 17 million middle-grade spirit stones!”

Wang Xian looked at the message sent by Father Zhou and smiled. He stood up and walked out.

“Eh? What are you doing? It’s not your turn to introduce yourself yet!”

Duan Qingwen’s face darkened when he saw Wang Xian standing up and asked.

“I’m going out for a while!”

Wang Xian said plainly and walked out.

“Who gave you permission to go out? You... F * ck, you don’t follow the rules...”
