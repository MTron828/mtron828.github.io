“Dragon King, we are ready!”

In the Dragon King Palace, more than 2,000 warriors of the Dragon Palace were standing below!

The leader was 31 members!

“Prime Minister Gui, how are the preparations on strange demon’s side?”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the warriors of the Dragon Palace who were above the godly king level and asked with a smile on his face!

“Reporting to Dragon King, 60% of the godly kings of the six major forces have been captured, but there is still 40% that we have not captured!”

Prime Minister Gui immediately reported!

“That’s enough. Where are the level 7 immortal godly monarchs?”

Wang Xian asked indifferently!

“Only six people have been identified. Three of them do not know their location!”

Prime Minister Gui Said and pondered for a moment, “Dragon King, we can attract them over!”

“Those who can confirm their location, send people over to surround them directly. Those who can not confirm their location, assassinate their disciples and attract them over!”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes and said coldly!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded his head and looked at the group of leaders and powerhouses beside him!

“Execute the plan immediately. We will take action one day later!”

He said with a cold face!

“It’s Prime Minister Gui!”

The group of leaders and powerhouses nodded their heads with murderous intent in their eyes!

They had been holding back for a long time!

“Sky Array, how’s the preparation of the array formation?”

Prime Minister Gui looked at the sky array and asked with a smile!

“It’s enough. The Fire Hammer clan’s immortal king level people will have no problem with two of them!”

The sky array nodded its head lightly!

The sky array had been preparing the sky array for a long time!

The array compass required the members who knew about the array formation to activate it. However, the fire hammer clan’s cultivation of the array formation allowed them to activate the compass made by the sky array!

Wang Xian sat on the dragon chair and looked around. A smile appeared on his face!

All he had to do now was to wait for the results. All 31 level 7 immortal king level powerhouses from the Dragon Palace would be deployed this time!

The reason why he waited for a month before taking action was for the results to be achieved in one fell swoop!

A Day passed very quickly. Prime Minister Gui and the leaders of the civil officials came up with a detailed battle plan!

Out of the 6 known undying level 7 warriors, the Dragon Palace immediately sent 18 undying level 7 warriors to kill them!

As for the other undying warriors, the Dragon Palace also sent at least double their strength!

Out of the 6 forces, other than the Undying Level 7 warriors, they had about 40 undying level 5 warriors, however against the 100 or so from the Dragon Palace, there was still a huge gap! Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

As for the 5 and 4 levels, the gap was even bigger!

Even though the 6 powers had about 3,000 undying emperors, most of them were only 1!

“Enter the array!”

A day later on Dragon Star, the sky array said to the members of the Dragon Palace!

“Yes!”

The leaders led their subordinates without hesitation, entering the battle!

Weng

One by one, they entered the formation and soon found themselves in the void!

“Let’s go. We’ll act according to the plan in thirty hours!”

The leaders looked at the time of the artificial intelligence system and said in a low voice!

“Okay, let’s Go!”

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

The fifty thousand members of the Dragon Palace instantly flew into the distance and disappeared into the vast void!

In the starry sky around the Dragon Star, the experts sent by the six forces to monitor didn’t notice the members of the Dragon Palace at all!

At the teleportation formation, Prime Minister Gui and the others looked coldly at the space!

“When the other members of the Dragon Palace make their move, clean up this trash too!”

Prime Minister Gui said indifferently!

In the space of the star South Galaxy, the members of the Dragon Palace swiftly shuttled through the space!

With many undying level 7 warriors leading them, their speed was much faster!

A few hours later, more and more members left the team and quietly entered the planets!

...

The 6 powers had over 1,000 planets in total, of which the demon slaying sect and three seas sect’s planets had already been taken over by the Tiger Chaos Demon Country’s Dragon Palace!

However, the other 6 powers had many life planets too!

In just over a day, the members of the Dragon Palace arrived on the planets!

Especially where the Sky Mountain Sword sect and the ninth grade sky sect were located, there were 10 undying level 7 warriors heading over!

On the Sky Mountain Business Planet and the Ninth Grade Sky sect business planet, the members of the Dragon Palace had also entered!

The Sky Mountain business planet was extremely prosperous, it was a business planet with a long history, and was also recognized as one of the safest business planets in the southern star system!

It had been hundreds of thousands of years since a large-scale battle took place on the entire planet!

There were few disturbances, which resulted in the prosperity of this planet!

Back then, when Wang Xian wanted to enter this planet, he was directly rejected outside!

“The 30 hours are up. Act Now!”

After 30 hours, the leaders of the Dragon Palace looked at the time and revealed a smile!

...

“Let’s go to the commercial planet of Tianshan!”

“Let’s go to the commercial planet of the ninth-grade Sky Sect!”

The order to attack was given, and everyone was slightly shocked!

“Attack!”

At the same time, in the center of the commercial planet of Tianshan and the Commercial Planet of the Ninth-grade Sky Sect, a group of strange demons and the members of the Heavenly Eye Arrow Division immediately launched an attack!

“Ahhhh!”

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

In an instant, a group of strange demon and Sky Eye Arrow Division members attacked the disciples of the Sky Mountain Sword sect and the ninth grade sky sect on the two business planets!

The members of the Dragon Palace who attacked were not very strong, most of them were below immortal god King level!

There were also immortal god King level experts, all of them were barely able to fight against the opponent’s immortal god King level experts!

Rumble

The sudden explosion, the sudden attack, was extremely eye catching on the bustling planet!

“What’s going on? Why is there an explosion all of a sudden!”

“Someone is attacking the Tian Shan business planet, someone is attacking!”

“It’s the members of the Dragon Palace, the Warriors of the Dragon Palace are taking revenge on the Tian Shan Sword sect!”

The sudden attack caused a huge commotion within a 1,000 km radius, countless people on the business planet looked towards the location of the explosion, their faces filled with shock!

“What’s going on? Shouldn’t the six major forces be monitoring the members of the Dragon Palace? Why are they suddenly here to launch an attack!”

“Damn it, what is the business planet of the Sky Mountain Sword sect doing!”

Some customers saw the attack and yelled in panic and embarrassment!

“Damn you bastards of the Dragon Palace, how dare you attack us? Go To Hell!”

On the commercial planet, the experts of the Tianshan Sword sect were furious when they heard that the experts of the Dragon Palace had come to cause trouble!

At the same time, they were also shocked!

How did the other party suddenly enter their commercial planet?

After all, the Tianshan Sword sect had been fully prepared on the commercial planet ever since the ninth-grade Heaven Sect’s commercial planet was attacked!

However, they did not know how many powerhouses had come this time!
