Translator: 5496903

“Good morning, Sir Wang!”

“Good morning, Sir Wang!”

A Day passed slowly. The next morning, Wang Xian came to the streets.

Order had been restored in Shenghai town. Some shops were reopened.

When the citizens of Shenghai Town saw Wang Xian, they greeted him respectfully and loudly.

Wang Xian nodded his head lightly and came to a place that sold tea leaves!

“Master Wang, do you want tea leaves?”

Seeing Wang Xian coming in, the boss stood up immediately and asked with a smile on his face. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Yes, I want to buy some tea leaves to drink!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“Master Wang likes to drink tea. Please wait!”

As the boss spoke, he walked to the back and took out his precious tea leaves!

“Master Wang, please try it. This is a good tea leaf that I have been saving for decades. I guarantee it will be the best tea in Shenghai Town!”

The boss was all smiles. “Please take it and drink it!”

“I can’t just take it for free. How many spiritual stones?”

Wang Xian shook his head and said as he looked at the boss’warm and courteous manner.

“Sir Wang, why do you still want more spiritual stones? Please don’t torture me. If I were to take your spiritual stones, it would be a slap to my own face. My entire family’s lives were saved by you. How can I take your spiritual stones?”

The boss waved his hand hurriedly.

In the end, Wang Xian didn’t insist on being the boss. He walked out with a smile.

“Little Brat, look at that. That is the great hero of our Shenghai Town. You have to train hard in the future and strive to be as powerful as master Wang!”

“Alright, Dad. Don’t worry. I will protect you all in the future!”

On the way back, Wang Xian heard voices coming from behind and the smile on his face grew wider.

“Reporting, Master Jin. There’s a fully armed 10,000-man army attacking from afar!”

Just as Wang Xian entered the mayor’s residence, he saw a guard flying over and reporting anxiously to Mayor Jin.

“What? The 10,000-man army is attacking?”

Mayor Jin was slightly taken aback. Following that, his face darkened and his eyes flickered.

“Let’s go to the city gate!”

Without any hesitation, Mayor Jin flew toward the East Gate.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and flew toward the east gate.

He was waiting for the arrival of Feng Luan. However, Feng Luan shouldn’t be here so soon.

There was only one person left. He was from the ocean cultivators army!

Boom

Before Wang Xian reached the city gate, he heard the sound of the formation being attacked.

He narrowed his eyes slightly and looked ahead.

The loud noise of the formation also attracted the surprise of the people nearby. Some of them flew towards the city gate curiously.

“The sea cultivators of star-moon kingdom have arrived. Open the city gate immediately. Do not disobey. Otherwise, you will be punished according to the crime of treason, including your nine families!”

A dignified voice was heard. The cold voice spread across half of Shenghai town.

Wang Xian landed on the city wall and immediately saw the neatly arranged army below.

The Army of ocean cultivators was written on the chest of his aquamarine-colored clothes

At the front, a burly middle-aged man was riding on a ten-meter-sized ferocious beast that looked like a dinosaur.

The ferocious beast was emitting a violent aura. It was at least at level nine of the supernatural realm.

The middle-aged man stared at the position of the city wall without any emotion on his face.

Wang Xian looked over and instantly sensed his strength. He was an insightful emptiness realm expert.

He was the general of the ocean cultivator army, tsunami sky!

Jin Qianyuan stood on the city wall and looked at the tens of thousands of soldiers and the general at the front with a gloomy face.

“Two days ago, our holy sea town was in a crisis where the city was destroyed. your ocean cultivator army didn’t come to save us. I wonder why you are here now!”

He stared at the ocean cultivator corps with a gloomy face and roared in a deep voice.

“I’m here. Open the city gate and Welcome Me!”

Tsunami sky ignored Jin Qianyuan’s words. He looked over with an expressionless face.

“PFFT, Haha, how interesting. If you came two days ago, we would have knelt down to welcome you. But now, who the F * ck are you? !”

A city guard heard Tsunami Sky’s words and mocked loudly without any fear.

In an instant, when this city guard finished speaking, the entire ocean cultivator army below was completely stunned.

10,000 stunned gazes stared directly at that city guard.

“HMPH!”

However, what responded to the ocean cultivator army was that young man’s cold snort.

Who the hell dared to call their general?

To dare to call a profound void martial expert, this...

Was courting death!

A thick murderous aura appeared on Tsunami Sky’s face. He moved his arm, and the weapon placed on the fierce beast beneath him was directly picked up. He pointed at the city guard from afar with a murderous aura.

“You deserve to be executed!”

You deserve to be executed!

The words that came out of tsunami sky’s mouth with the surprise of the trial didn’t go against the slightest.

“Haha, you should be executed for your crime? General Tsunami Sky, you have to understand something now. Right now, you don’t have the right to condemn others!”

“In our holy sea town, who do you think you are?”

Jin Qianyuan also laughed and said loudly without hiding anything.

“That’s right. F * ck, who do you ocean cultivator corps think you are? Get out of my sight!”

“YOU MOTHERF * cker! Is Our Holy Sea Town Sect’s tax taking in trash like you just to show off?”

“Get lost! Give it to me! Ocean cultivator corps? Bullsh * T!”

“We are no longer people of star-moon kingdom. Don’t step into our territory!”

The guards and the civilians who flew over cursed at the ocean cultivator corps without the slightest fear.

General?

Insightful emptiness realm expert?

So what?

You’ve all come to kill our benefactor, yet we’re still cheering and welcoming you?

How could this be? In the face of the enemy, if we can’t beat them, we can only curse. After all, they won’t be able to enter!

“You Bunch of damned fools of Saint Sea Town. If you dare to betray our country, I, tsunami sky, will clean up you bunch of trash!”

Tsunami Sky’s brows twitched violently. The dignity and superiority he had on his body were completely destroyed by the cursing of the people of Saint Sea Town.

He held the big sword in his hand tightly, flew directly to the air, ice-cold Roar Way.

“General Hai, on behalf of all the people of Holy Sea Town, I, Jin Qianyuan of Holy Sea Town, declare that holy sea town no longer belongs to star-moon kingdom. The former holy sea town has been destroyed!”

Jin Qian Yuan looked at flying into the sky full of murderous tsunami day, flat face announced loudly.

“Die! A bunch of ants! How dare they betray the country!”

Tsunami Sky held his sword with both hands and slashed at sacred sea town.

The horrifying sword light, which was thousands of meters long, slashed at sacred sea town from the top down.

“Bang!”

“Crack!”

“Crack!”

The two layers of array formation were broken, but they were still easily blocked.

Tsunami Sky’s face changed slightly, and he stared at the city-protecting array formation that blocked his attack in disbelief.

How could this defensive formation be so strong?

“Hehe, General Hai, you’d better take your men and get lost!”
