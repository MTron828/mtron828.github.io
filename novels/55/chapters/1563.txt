Chapter 1564: 1564 saint of Light 3

“What happened?”

“The Crown Prince of Wuqing city has been invaded by the soul of darkness. Gather all our priests to deal with it!”

“What do you mean the crown prince has been invaded by the Soul of Darkness?”

In front of the palace of Wuji dynasty, priests quickly rushed over.

In less than ten minutes, thousands of priests of light arrived.

There were void interpretation level priests and transcendents.

They were all discussing in shock.

“All radiant priests, come over and see how our crown prince’s situation should be resolved!”

A middle-aged man looked at the radiant priest who had rushed over and said in a deep voice.

“Yes, yes!”

The radiant priest who had rushed over quickly walked over with a respectful expression.

“Among you, if anyone can cure Qing city, what do you want? What will our Wuji Empire Give You?”

At this moment, the bald black-eyed elder standing in the middle said in a deep voice with an expressionless face.

“I don’t dare, I don’t dare. This lowly one will definitely give it my all!”

When all the radiant priests heard the bald black-eyed elder’s words, their pupils constricted slightly and their breathing quickened as they hurriedly said loudly.

“Let me take a look!”

The Divine Light Medical Hall’s Hall master immediately walked over and arrived in front of the Wu Qing City’s crown prince.

“An invasion of Darkness Souls?”

When he walked over, he was instantly shocked, and his expression became solemn.

“A sixth level void interpretation darkness soul, and there are actually more than ten of them entering his body, hiss ~”

He walked to the side of Wu Qing city, and even before he started examining, he could already sense the tyrannical darkness souls in his body.

This caused his expression to become extremely grave.

His strength was only at level six of the profound void tier. Even if a single darkness soul entered his body, he wouldn’t be able to deal with it, much less when more than a dozen darkness souls were entangled together.

“What? More than a dozen level six of the profound void tier darkness souls entered his body... this... this...”

When the surrounding light priests heard Divine Light Hall Master’s words, their faces revealed embarrassed expressions.

No wonder, no wonder even the Wuji dynasty’s patriarch couldn’t treat the crown prince’s injuries.

No wonder the Wuji dynasty would call all the radiant priests over and promise to give whatever they wanted to anyone who could heal them.

All of the radiant priests had extremely embarrassed looks on their faces.

Even the Divine Light Hall master stood there, unable to make a move.

This was simply not something he could solve.

When the Wuji Dynasty’s patriarch and the others saw that all the radiant priests were helpless, their expressions became slightly awkward.

“My Lords of the Wuji dynasty, all the radiant priests of our divine light dynasty have arrived!”

At this moment, another group of people rushed over quickly.

The leader was the emperor of the Divine Light Dynasty. He did not dare to be the slightest bit negligent. When he saw the bald black-eyed elder, his face became even more respectful.

“My Lord, our forefather is coming from the Divine Light Empire Right Now!”

He reported to the bald, black-eyed elder.

“Yes, I know. I’ll have to trouble you. If Your Divine Light Empire can cure Qing city, our Wuji Empire will definitely give you a satisfactory reward!”

The black-eyed elder said directly.

“Yes, yes!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The King of the Divine Light Empire’s eyes lit up, and he looked behind him.

The priests of the Divine Light Empire immediately walked over. Among them were two radiant priests at the seventh level of the insight void tier.

“Princess Qingyan, the Crown Prince of Wuqing City is...”

The son of Light Tian Qingguang looked at the experts of the empire as they walked over. He walked to the side of Princess Wu Qingyan and asked softly.

“More than ten sixth level insight void tier darkness souls have entered the body!”

Wu Qingyan said anxiously as she kept looking at her brother.

“What?”

Tian Qingguang was slightly shocked. “Even if a transcendent level darkness soul entered the body, it would still require a powerful radiant priest to be able to deal with it. A sixth-level void interpretation...”

His expression was slightly solemn. As a child of light, even though he was called trash by priest Wang, he still had some strength.

He knew the severity of the darkness soul entering the body.

“Among the one hundred people who have been entered by the Darkness Soul, not one of them will be able to recover!”

“With the help of the experts from the divine light dynasty, they should be able to get rid of the Darkness Soul!”

At the rear, all the light priests from the ruins of the divine kingdom rushed over.

When they learned of the injuries of the Crown Prince of Wuqing City, they were all extremely solemn.

“This... this... more than a dozen darkness souls entered the crown prince’s body without the slightest damage. Their intelligence did not suffer the slightest damage. This is troublesome!”

“That’s right. With our strength, it would be extremely difficult for us to face a level 6 insightful void Tier Darkness Soul one-on-one!”

At this moment, the two level 7 insightful void tier light priests who were examining Wuqing city’s body had slightly embarrassed expressions.

The radiant priests’combat strength was very weak to begin with, and they wanted to understand these darkness souls.

This was equivalent to fighting with the darkness souls in Wu Qing Cheng’s body.

They could not destroy the darkness souls without harming Wu Qing Cheng.

“If you need any treasures to assist you, feel free to say it!”

The people from Wuji dynasty who were standing to the side saw their solemn expressions, and their expressions did not look good as they directly said this.

The two insightful void Tier 7 radiant priests took a deep breath and bowed.

“We are helpless. The Crown Prince’s dark souls are too complete. There are more than ten of them. We can’t do anything about it!”

“Maybe... maybe our morning light forefather has a way... we are really ashamed!”

The two bowed and shook their heads.

This made the faces of the people of Wuji Empire Turn Ugly.

“If any of you have the special effect of the folk prescription, as long as it is beneficial to Qing city, tell us and Wuji Empire will not mistreat you!”

The old man holding the dark staff glanced at the thousands of light priests and said in a deep voice.

No one said anything. No one was confident.

“Old Hu, you seem to have told me that priest Wang once saved a young man who was invaded by the Soul of Darkness!”

Among the priests of light, the Master of the Holy Medicine Shop asked Old Hu in a low voice.

“Yes, he saved a young man who was invaded by darkness, but... We don’t know where priest Wang is now!”

Old Hu shook his head bitterly.

“Buzz!”

“What’s Going On!”

Just as the two of them finished speaking, the people in front of them were pushed to the sides by an invisible force.

They were slightly shocked and quickly looked forward.

The priests of light who had been moved away were also shocked.

“You said that someone treated a young man who was invaded by darkness? where is that person?”

In front of them, more than a dozen people opened a path. What they saw was the dignified gaze of the bald black-eyed elder.

Cold sweat appeared on the foreheads of the hall master and Old Hu.

“Reporting to my Lord, our medical hall once had a mysterious priest Wang who cured a young man, but... We don’t know where this priest Wang is now!”

The Sacred Medicine Hall’s Hall master and Old Hu knelt on the ground in panic and said directly.

“Priest Wang?”

“That arrogant fellow?”
