Chapter 685: 0686 death and resurrection (first update!)

Translator: 549690339

Unnatural torrential rain fell from the sky. Every raindrop was the size of a bean.

Within a radius of more than ten kilometers, it was a completely different world from the outside world.

The throbbing and panic from the pink-nosed dolphin gave Tang Yinxuan a bad premonition.

Sometimes, a woman’s sixth sense was very terrifying!

“Woo Woo!”

The pink-nosed dolphin beneath her once again let out a panicked sound. Tang Yinxuan frowned as she scanned her surroundings.

Heavy rain. Other than heavy rain, it was still heavy rain!

Tang Yinxuan lifted her head with a blessed expression and looked towards the sky.

In front of her, a waterfall of spiritual energy descended from the sky, making this place seem like a Fairyland!

Tang Yinxuan frowned as the crisis in her heart intensified. The pink-nosed dolphin brought her to Wang Xian’s side.

Xiao Yu, Lan Qingyue, Sun Lingxiu, and the others were treating Wang Xian’s injuries as they asked with concern.

Everything seemed to be normal.

However, the pink-nosed Dolphin’s throbbing was accompanied by a bad premonition in her heart.

At this moment, she suddenly saw two pairs of blood-red eyes appearing in the sky. Following that, two blood-red ferocious faces appeared in the void.

The ferocious faces opened their mouths, and a terrifying black energy was brewing in their mouths!

Two balls of terrifying energy were aimed at Wang Xian and Prime Minister Gui

Tang Yinxuan’s expression changed drastically. “Be careful!”

A look of horror appeared on her face. She moved to the side of Wang Xian, and a water energy shield appeared in the sky.

“Huh?”

Tang Yinxuan’s sudden cry stunned Wang Xian and the rest for a moment. Following that, a terrifying energy that made their hearts palpitate attacked them.

Wang Xian’s expression changed drastically.

“Heavenly Voice Wuji, use your body as a zither!”

At this moment, he saw Tang Yinxuan who was beside him as if she had transformed into a zither. She was putting up a defense above him.

Wang Xian waved his arm.

“Whoosh!”

“Whoosh!”

However, in the void, that black energy was like an aurora. In an instant, it passed through Tang Yinxuan’s body and directly penetrated half of Wang Xian’s body. He didn’t even put up a defense.

“Boom!”

At the side, the moment Tang Yinxuan reminded him, Prime Minister Gui, who had raised the turtle shell in his hand, widened his eyes. His body fell to the bottom of the sea at a terrifying speed.

Fresh blood was spat out.

“Xiao Xian!”

“Brother, Tang Yinxuan!”

Lan qingyue, Xiao Yu, and the other girls exclaimed from the side.

“Damn it, damn that girl. If not for her reminder, we would have killed the two of them!”

“It doesn’t matter. The two of them are already heavily injured. There are only two left. One minute. Let’s end this quickly!”

At this moment, a shattering sound came from the void. Two figures came from inside.

One of them was wearing a blood-red robe. His lips were blood-red, and his eyes were also red. He was a demonic middle-aged man.

The other one was pitch-black. He had a pair of snow-white arms, and his eyes were also blood-red.

The two of them seemed to have walked out of a sea of blood, and their bodies were exuding a terrifying blood qi.

At the same time, a shocking aura was emitted from their bodies.

This was definitely not a strength that a lower immortal could unleash.

“Roar, you deserve to die!”

On the side, Ao Qitian saw that half of the Dragon King’s body had been directly penetrated and instantly became furious. His body had actually grown to a terrifying size of about 13 meters.

He held the metal rod in his hand and violently attacked the two people in the sky.

“You two, die!”

Ao Jian’s body was extremely cold. He directly transformed into the body of a golden swordfish. With the sword, a golden light flashed and carried the soundless sword as he directly attacked.

“If you are not injured, you can still spar with us. Now!”

The black-clothed demonic youth’s snow-white arm instantly turned pitch-black. Black energy that was like an aurora instantly attacked Ao jian. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

At the side, a long spear appeared in the hands of the blood-red-clothed demonic middle-aged man. The long spear was extremely blood-red.

“Buzz!”

The terrifying long spear attacked ao Qitian.

Sensing the terrifying power above, Ao Qitian and Ao Jian’s expressions changed drastically.

Their current strength was already less than half of their peak. Now that they had encountered two existences that were even stronger than them, they were no match for them.

Ao Qitian’s blood-red eyes could only passively defend as he smashed heavily towards the spear.

“Boom!”

“Pa!”

The terrifying blood-red spear collided with Ao Qitian’s metal rod and actually instantly broke it.

This caused ao Qitian’s expression to change drastically.

The metal rod was something he had once obtained in the ocean. It was extremely hard and was a grade-13 material.

It could completely be used to create a grade-13 spirit tool, a spirit tool used by immortals and deities.

Although this metal rod was only a body, in Ao Qitian’s hands, it was stronger and more solid than a grade-12 spirit tool.

However, today, under the attack of the long spear, it actually directly broke.

Ao Qitian’s palm cracked, and blood gushed out wildly. His body also fell into the sea at a terrifying speed.

“Boom!”

On the side, a dense black light and the dazzling gold collided. The two waves of energy were in a stalemate in the void, as if the world had been divided into two.

“Eh? What a terrifying sword principle. However, Hehe!”

The demonic middle-aged man in blood-red clothes saw Ao jian blocking his attack, and his arm shook.

A blood-red bow appeared in his hand. He pulled at the void and said, “Ghost Devouring Arrow!”

“Whoosh!”

A ferocious demon shot out from the blood-red bow and instantly landed on Ao Jian’s body.

“Boom!”

The terrifying force caused Ao Jian’s blood to splatter in all directions as he fell into the sea.

“Keke, seven immortal-level corpses. This is great, this is simply great. Haha, that Divine Dragon General is my mount!”

The blood-red glow in the eyes of the middle-aged man in Black was abnormally demonic. He laughed out loud and directly grabbed at Wang Xian.

The blood-red middle-aged man was also filled with excitement as he dived downwards. He flew towards the place where Prime Minister Gui had fallen.

“Xiao Xian!”

Wang Xian heard the voices of Xiao Yu, Lan Qingyue, and the others. He was slightly dazed and his entire body was abnormally weak.

This was the last time he was injured. It was even a threat to his life.

He saw Ao Qitian and Ao Jian being severely injured in the ocean.

Wang Xian turned his head and saw that Tang Yinxuan, who had been penetrated by the black energy, was almost dead. His heart ached slightly.

His gaze swept past Xiao Yu, Lan Qingyue, and the other girls at the side. A hint of blood flashed in his eyes.

“Wait for My Resurrection!”

He growled and raised his head to look at the two demonic middle-aged men in the sky.

“Roar, you deserve to die!”

Wang Xian instantly transformed into the body of the Five Elements Divine Dragon. Although he was now in an extremely dilapidated state, there was an additional bloodlust and fierceness.

Buzz

The five-colored radiance on Wang Xian’s body intensified. A resplendent green sword that was a hundred meters long appeared in the void.

The sword was extremely green!

The moment the green sword appeared, the middle part of Wang Xian’s body dissipated. Only the dragon bones were connected!
