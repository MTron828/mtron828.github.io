3271 3270 Dragon Kings vs Demon Dragon Emperor

All the void God Emperor Level Disciples of the demonic dragon lineage, the Fire Dragon Palace, and the Red Gold War Dragon were killed.

This feud was irreconcilable!

Although they still did not understand how their disciples died, it was definitely related to the Water Dragon Palace and the Dragon Palace.

Especially the Strange Dragon Palace.

“Hehe, let’s Fight!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with a cold glint when he saw Devil Dragon Emperor attacking.

Boom! Boom

His dragon body swayed as he flapped his incipient saint wings. With a terrifying speed, he instantly arrived at the right side of Devil Dragon Emperor.

Devil Dragon Emperor had two acquired Supreme Treasures, but Wang Xian’s five elements millstone wasn’t any weaker.

Currently, the Five Elements Millstone had already absorbed three acquired Supreme Treasures.

If it were to explode, it would be able to completely block the two acquired Supreme Treasures.

“Bang!”

Wang Xian’s speed was still his greatest killing weapon. He arrived at Devil Dragon Emperor’s side in an instant and swept out with his dragon tail.

“What terrifying speed!”

Devil Dragon Emperor found it difficult to withstand Wang Xian’s speed. His expression changed drastically.

“Boom, Boom, Boom!”

His body shook. Dark Power emerged from the dragon scales one by one. The dark power condensed into skeletons and blocked Wang Xian’s dragon tail.

“Bang! Bang!”

However, the time he condensed the skeletons was too short. As the dragon tail swept past, it collapsed rapidly. The remaining power landed on Devil Dragon Emperor’s body.

“Roar! Roar!”

Devil Dragon Emperor was in pain. Some of his scales fell off and fresh blood flowed out.

Devil Dragon Emperor let out a wild roar. An incomparably huge dark fang appeared in front of him and instantly tore at Wang Xian.

“Dragon Tomb!”

Wang Xian let out a low roar. The dragon tomb floated in the sky and smashed towards the dark fang.

At the same time, he relied on his speed to dodge to the side.

“Bang! Bang!”

The terrifying Fang destroyed the Dragon Tomb. However, Wang Xian was already far away at this moment.

“Dragon Head, devour the Sky!”

Devil Dragon Emperor’s blood-red eyes locked onto Wang Xian. Numerous huge dragon heads appeared in the surroundings.

The ferocious dragon heads headed straight for Wang Xian to devour him.

“Heavenly Dragon Eight Divisions!”

Wang Xian focused his gaze. Eight Godly Dragon Phantoms appeared around him and collided with the dragon heads.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Another terrifying collision sounded.

“Cloud and mist dragon soaring!”

Wang Xian let out a low growl as he continued to cast the Divine Dragon of Laws.

His surroundings were instantly enveloped by the Cloud and mist. Wang Xian flapped his primaless sacred wings.

Buzz

At this moment, his speed was at the peak, comparable to that of a universe knight at level eight.

In terms of speed, he completely suppressed Devil Dragon Emperor.

“Law Projection, Devil Dragon Heavenly Realm!”

Devil Dragon Emperor looked at the surrounding clouds and mist. His eyes focused and he roared.

The next moment, darkness descended.

The Darkness and the clouds intersected, causing the entire space to be shrouded in mist. The people outside couldn’t see clearly.

However, Wang Xian could sense the demonic dragon emperor through the clouds and fog.

The demonic dragon emperor could sense him through the darkness as well.

“The shadow of the Holy Dragon!”

Wang Xian let out a low growl and unleashed his nomological abhijna once again.

The Shadow of a Holy Dragon descended from the sky and bombarded the demonic dragon emperor.

“Dragon Mark!”

The demonic dragon emperor swept his tail horizontally. A wisp of black seemed to have wiped out everything in the void as it attacked Wang Xian’s location.

Crash

Wang Xian flapped his divine wings and quickly dodged the attack of the dragon marks. Then, he arrived at the left side of Devil Dragon Emperor.

Crack! Crack

He extended his dragon claws and clawed at him.

“How can his speed be so fast? It’s that wing. That wing is at least at the level of a postliminary treasure. It might even be stronger.”

Devil Dragon Emperor looked extremely embarrassed when he saw Wang Xian coming to his left side to attack him.

In terms of speed, he was completely suppressed.

“Bang!”

A wave of energy attacked Wang Xian. The dragon claw collapsed and clawed viciously at Devil Dragon Emperor’s body.

“Roar! Roar!”

A large piece of flesh and blood was grabbed in his hand. Devil Dragon Emperor dodged to the side with an abnormally ugly expression. His dragon tail swept over.

Wang Xian flapped his uninitiated holy wings and retreated immediately.

“Ah Ah Ah Ah!”

“Fire Dragon Lord, Devil Dragon Emperor, save us. We are not a match for that strange existence.”

At this moment, a scream came from below.

After all the void God emperor level disciples of the three great dragon palaces were killed, all the combat strength of the Dragon Palace and Water Dragon Palace went all out to fight against the three Great Dragon Palace Paragons.

Especially with an lie around, his spatial teleportation was abnormally terrifying. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

In a flash, he killed a great being below level five of a universe knight.

Especially a universe knight at level one, two, or three. He was like a child.

He couldn’t put up any resistance at all.

They didn’t even see an lie make a move before he died.

This made all the universe knights panic.

This wasn’t a battle at all. This was simply waiting for death.

The moment they were locked onto by that strange being, they would be waiting for death.

In just a few dozen seconds, more than 100 universe knights had died at his hands.

“Damn it!”

Devil Dragon Emperor swept his gaze over, gritted his teeth, and roared loudly, “Retreat to the Dragon Palace.”

“Retreat to the Dragon Palace!”

Devil Dragon Emperor and Fire Dragon Emperor followed suit and ordered loudly.

They had lost. This time, they had lost completely.

At this moment, they didn’t have the arrogance and confidence they had when they first arrived.

They had suffered heavy losses so far in this battle.

They had already injured their foundations.

“Do you think you can come and go as you please?”

An lie appeared at a place and roared with a cold face.

As soon as he finished speaking, he instantly appeared beside the venerable master who was fleeing in the back and killed him in one move.

“All the disciples of the Dragon Palace, kill them! Don’t let them enter the Dragon Palace!”

Ao qitian, who was at the forefront of the battlefield, roared loudly. He held the ocean-pacifying divine needle in his hand, which was wrapped in blood-red chains, and directly attacked the front.

“Damn it! We can’t be distracted when facing them.”

The high-level dragon species of the firecloud army and the Dragon Eagle Army looked extremely embarrassed.

Faced with the orderly attacks of the Dragon Palace, as long as they made the slightest mistake, willow branches and arrows would come at them.

Once they turned around and retreated, they would completely leave their backs to the enemy.

“Retreat while fighting!”

The leader of the dragonhawk Legion roared angrily. He flapped his huge wings, and countless flames shot forward like meteors.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The Sky Thunder, Earth Fire, Dragon and Phoenix flapped their wings as well, and countless meteorites charged forward.

The meteorites were covered in thunder and flames, and their speed was even more ferocious.

“Fight with all your might!”

Ao Qitian and the others roared. They only needed to buy some time.

If they could buy a second, an lie could kill a few universe knights.

If they could buy a few minutes, they would all be defeated.

“All great beings above level three universe knights, help block them first. The rest of the disciples, retreat to Dragon Palace!”

Fire Dragon Master ordered with an embarrassed expression.

“Yes!”

The Great Beings above level three universe knights trembled, gritted their teeth, and answered loudly.
