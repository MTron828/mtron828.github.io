Chapter 461: Annihilating Sacred Sects (2)

At this moment, a flaming fowl appeared above Guan Shuqing’s head.

The flaming fowl was about five meters in size, exuding a boiling temperature.

Boom boom!

Every flap of the blazing wings fired flaming feathers at Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan.

Each of the flames was dark red, and the temperature was terrifyingly high as they were almost comparable to the Heavenly Flame!

Yet, the flaming feathers on the flaming fowl were shrouding crazily over the place ahead.

Boom boom!

At this time, fifty Dragonians and the experts from Medical Saint Sect, Qiao Clan, and seven forces went head-on together instantly.

The Dragonians were like emotionless killing machines. The scary demonic aura exuded sent chills to everyone as soon as they engaged.

“Go to hell!”

The five Half-Step to Dan Realm Experts from Qiao Clan and Medical Saint Sect charged at the Dragonians with murderous intent on their faces.

Boom!

The weeds on the ground were growing madly as they attempted to entangle Dragonians, bursting flames at Dragonians.

With the sharp energy at the peak, they wielded at Dragonians.

This was the combat of experts, which was different from those battles with cold weapons in ancient times.

A battle which involved a mere thousand-odd people seemed like a war for a million people.

The offense was so powerful that it was unbelievable.

Ka Ka Ka!

“What? That’s a strong defense of light!”

As Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan charged at the Dragonians for the first head-on collision, they were being interrupted instantly by bright defense energy with a glimmer of embarrassment in their eyes.

Roar!

“Go to hell!”

The beast-like bellow came from the Dragonians as they struck forward with their half-meter, scary dragon claws.

Argh, argh!

Before the Dragonians could even make their attacks, there were moaning and despairing shrieks from behind.

All the experts from Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan were stunned. Some of them craned their necks when they saw the tails of the dense flaming feathers enveloping the people at the back like some missiles.

The experts present today were not only the Inborn Experts but also thousands of Inborn and below.

Yet, those experts who were below Inborn level could not resist the daunting flaming feathers a bit.

The dense and terrifying flaming feathers pierced through the Martial Artists easily.

“What a domineering flaming feather. How can an Inborn Expert have enough energy to fire hundreds of flaming feathers in one go?”

Some of the experts cast their attention ahead with an incredulous look in their eyes.

“Light, shield on!”

Just then, everyone heard a soft yell again.

Some of them spotted a beautiful and holy goddess spitting out an Illuminating Pearl from her mouth behind them.

The Illuminating Pearl suspended itself in the air as beams of light shrouded the disciples of Dragon Sect.

That strong light defense could only be penetrated by a full blow from an Inborn Expert.

As someone who had inherited the Light Divine Dragon’s legacy, Sun Lingxiu had the supreme-class Origin Source Constitution.

Her talent was not any weaker than a Divine Dragon.

Given that she had advanced to Half-Step to Dan Realm, it was a breeze for her to display a variety of her Light Energy.

On top of that, the defense she released was empowered by the Illuminating Pearl, such that even Inborn Experts had to strike with their full power.

And that was the case when her defense was thinly spread across a vast area. If she were only shielding one person, even Half-Step to Dan Realm Expert would find it hard to bring it down.

Argh!

Another devastating cry was heard from one of the Inborn Experts of Qiao Clan as the terrifying dragon claws of Mo Yuan pierced through the body of an Inborn Expert.

As soon as the battle began, the first Inborn Expert was killed.

Argh!

Soon after, another two Inborn Experts let out shrieks. All of them were coming from Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan.

“Kill that girl and shoot that Illuminating Pearl in the air down!” a Half-Step to Dan Realm Expert cried out with slight changes in his expression when he heard the screams.

“Kill her. We’ve got almost double the Inborn Experts!” another Inborn Expert bellowed.

About five Inborn Experts made a swift move and slashed the Illuminating Pearl in the air.

“Aurora!”

Sun Lingxiu remained unwavering as her hand flicked. The Illuminating Pearl gave off beams of light that were like endless Aurora lights that pierced through five Inborn Experts.

Argh, argh!

As Aurora passed through, another five screams were heard.

Upon hearing the screams, all the people from Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan could not control the sudden tremor in their hearts.

In less than a minute, eight Inborn Experts had been killed.

Yet, no one from the Dragon Sect had died.

The daunting Light defense and the mighty physical defense of those people from the Dragon Sect struck fear into the rest.

Their individual strength differed by too much.

“Qiao Longchuan, you pin that girl down while I take down that Illuminating Pearl!” a Half-Step to Dan Realm Expert shouted with a twisted expression.

“Got it. Slash them!”

With a furious roar, an old man whose hand was holding onto a sword hundreds of meters away slashed at Sun Lingxiu.

Boom boom!

A hundred-meter-long crack ran up the island by the sword radiance condensed from the metal as it was wielded at Sun Lingxiu.

Bam!

Wang Xian swung his arm and shattered the three-meter metal blade shadows.

Buzz!

Wang Xian opened the Golden Ivory Fan in his hand. As soon as he closed it again with a single hand, the metal fan darted out to that Half-Step to Dan Realm Expert of Qiao Clan.

The metal fan was giving off a radiant glow that was dazzling.

“What?”

As soon as Qiao Longchuan of Qiao Clan noticed that fan, his expression had a massive change. The sword was giving off a searing golden glow as he wielded it at the golden fan.

Ka Ka Ka!

Argh!

The sword was broken, and the man was dead. With a shriek, the first Half-Step to Dan Realm Expert perished!

“He’s dead. The Half-Step to Dan Realm Expert perished. That Dragon King is too compelling. Besides...” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The disciples of Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan watched with traces of fear in their eyes.

Generally, Half-Step to Dan Realm Experts only existed in Sacred Sects. Every one of them was domineering.

They were the supreme rulers in the Underworld if none of the Laozus of the various clans and forces were around.

Yet, one had died in this Battle of the Sacred Sects.

Moreover, he was easily killed by the Dragon King of the Dragon Sect.

This Dragon King must be at Dan Realm.

However, such a Dan Realm Expert had only stood there, watching in silence.

On top of that, three ladies had already pinned down their Laozu and Supreme Elders altogether a thousand meters above the sea.

In the air, the deity-like Laozu was completely contained.

Those under Inborn existences at the back were fleeing in panic under the frenzied attack of that flaming fowl.

Nobody dared to look for the girls who were releasing Light and Flame, as there stood the Dragon King of the Dragon Sect.

That Half-step to Dan Realm from just now had marked the consequences for attacking the girls.

A tinge of fear surged in the hearts of all the people from Medical Saint Sect, Qiao Clan, and the seven forces.
