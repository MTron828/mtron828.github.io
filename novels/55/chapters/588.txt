Chapter 589: Serpent Sword (2)

“How can this be possible?” the young man murmured in a low voice as his body trembled. His eyes surged with a frantic fighting spirit.

But subsequently, the fighting spirit in his eyes slowly disappeared. He looked at the huge sword in his hand and headed to the shop once again.

“How dare you come in again!”

Wang Xian had just arrived upstairs when he sensed the young man walking in again. He raised his eyebrows.

“If you ever dare to step in again, you can forget about walking out alive!”

A cold voice came from upstairs while the young man had a slight change in his expression.

“Master, refine my weapon!”

The young man took a deep breath as the space ring in his hand exuded beams of radiance.

Bang, bang, bang!

One by one, the Spiritual Stones flew into the room upstairs.

The number of Spiritual Stones was massive. Within a few seconds, hundreds of thousands of Spiritual Stones went into the room.

Wang Xian froze for a moment as he looked at the Spiritual Stones in his room in shock.

Hundreds of thousands of Spiritual Stones was a significant figure.

“You want to modify your Spiritual Equipment?”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the Spiritual Stones as he showed up at the stairs, overlooking the young man.

“Yes!”

The young man craned his neck, looking up and staring at Wang Xian.

“Apologize now, and I’ll do it for you.”

Wang Xian quirked his lips as he spoke to the young man, monotone.

Radiance flickered in the eyes of the young man as he furrowed his brows. “I was reckless just now. I would like master to modify my Spiritual Equipment, please!”

“This should be the attitude. What were you doing just now? On account of the Spiritual Stones, come up!”

Wang Xian scorned the young man.

The corner of the young man’s lips twitched as he grasped his huge sword more tightly than ever. With some hesitation, he went up.

“A young Budding Realm expert. You’re on par with Piao Lingxue. I guess you must be one of the supreme talents from Da Hong Immortal Sect. However, one should still learn to be polite at my place!”

Wang Xian cast an emotionless gaze at the young man as he stored a hundred thousand Spiritual Stones in his space ring.

The young man came up while Wang Xian remained silent.

Seeing him keeping quiet, the young man’s hands that grabbed the huge sword tightened.

This was the first time he had encountered such a situation, and the arrogant young man felt uneasy about it.

But he could not win against Wang Xian, and he needed his help.

“Master, I would like to modify this sword!”

The young man took the initiative and spoke to Wang Xian.

“I can’t modify Level 12 Spiritual Equipment!”

Wang Xian cast a glance at that huge black-colored sword and spoke frankly.

“You don’t have to modify too much of it. I just need something to be embedded on it!”

As the young man spoke, he put down one of his bags and opened it up before him.

“I just need to embed this on the sword. As a compelling master, this should be easy!”

The young man took out pieces of scale-like items.

“This is...?”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes as he gazed at the metal that looked like pieces of scales.

A palm-sized material with a sharp tip.

[Serpent Scale Stones: Level 12]

There were hundreds of such Level 12 metals.

“Serpent Scale Stones. Can you embed this on the huge sword?”

The young man looked at Wang Xian and asked him with a dead fish look.

Wang Xian walked over and took out one of the Serpent Scale Stones. Subsequently, he stretched his hands out and took over the huge sword in the young man’s hand.

Embedding the Serpent Scale Stones on this huge edgeless sword would instantly enhance the power of this sword by a lot.

On top of that, circulating the stones with energy could form a serpent. This was the feature of the Serpent Scale Stones.

One slash would bring out hundreds of serpents, tearing the enemy apart. Just the thought of it would make one tremble in his boots.

Wang Xian took the Serpent Scale Stones and the huge sword as he locked his brows. Given his level in Art of Water Refining, he was unable to reforge it again.

To embed them on the sword, there was only one method.

Wang Xian looked towards the chest at the side and took out a type of metal from it.

[Xiyun Metal: Level 12]

Xiyun Metal was a unique metal that had a suction ability.

This was one of the materials sent by a force for refining some equipment that was similar to chains.

Wang Xian took a look at Xiyun Metal, then the huge sword and Serpent Scale Stones.

“Your Spiritual Stones are not enough!”

Wang Xian looked at the young man and spoke straightforwardly.

Xiyun Metal could be used to forge Level 12 weapons after Wang Xian upgraded to Level 9.

Level 12 Spiritual Equipment cost at least 150 thousand Spiritual Stones per piece. The hundred thousand Spiritual Stones that the young man paid was indeed insufficient!

“Not enough?”

Wang Xian’s words stunned the young man as he revealed a surprised look.

Wang Xian looked at him and said, “I need to consume Level 12 Xiyun Metal!”

“Help me modify it first, and I’ll not shortchange you any Spiritual Stones!”

The young man locked his brows as he spoke to Wang Xian.

“Great!”

Wang Xian nodded as he swung his arm and began his work.

Level 12 Xiyun Metal, for some reason, could melt at a rapid rate.

With a swing, drops of Xiyun Metal landed on the huge sword.

Subsequently, he embedded the Serpent Scale Stones on top of it.

Taking into account the energy conductivity, the stones were not embedded in any random order. Wang Xian had to consider all aspects to make it work.

Over hundreds of Serpent Scale Stones were somewhat troublesome, and this slowed down the embedding speed by a lot.

Phew!

After four hours, Wang Xian had finally embedded all the Serpent Scale Stones on the huge sword.

At this time, the sword had already undergone a tremendous change.

The entire huge and broad sword was already covered by the Serpent Scale Stones with them protruding from the blade.

The huge black sword had turned into some horrifying monster sword.

Wang Xian held the hilt and circulated his water energy.

Roar!

A faint roaring sound was heard from it as Sea Serpents formed by the water-energy began to sprout from the Serpent Scale Stones.

The entire sword had turned into a terrifying monster in an instant. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Great sword!”

Wang Xian’s eyes gleamed while the young man’s eyes were burning with passion as his body was shaking.

“Give it to me!”

The young man reached out to grab the huge sword.

“Spiritual Stones!” said Wang Xian without any emotion as he did not hand it to him directly.

“I’ll send them over tomorrow!”

The young man was expressionless as he fixed his eyes on that huge sword.

“Oh? Is that so?”

Wang Xian raised an eyebrow and stored the huge sword in his space ring. “Send over the remaining 150 thousand Spiritual Stones tomorrow, and I’ll return the sword to you. I’ll accept an equivalent amount of Xiyun Metal which I consumed just now too!”

“Hur, 150 thousand Spiritual Stones?”

The young man darkened his expression immediately as soon as he heard Wang Xian. He stared hard at Wang Xian.

“Yes, 100 thousand for workmanship fees, 150 thousand for Xiyun Metal. Give me Xiyun Metal, and I can offset the 150 thousand Spiritual Stones!”

Wang Xian looked at him and spoke with a smile.

The young man was startled as his face turned black. However, he did not say anything.

A hundred thousand Spiritual Stones was expensive for the workmanship, but it was, after all, Level 12 Spiritual Equipment. This was the primary market price.

In addition, there was nothing wrong with providing the Level 12 materials that were consumed in the process.

“Give me the sword first, and I’ll definitely give you the Spiritual Stones or whatever materials!” the young man said with a sullen face.

“Don’t even think about it. I’ll give you back your sword whenever you have Spiritual Stones or materials. Otherwise, I’ll keep your sword here!” Wang Xian said to him plainly.
