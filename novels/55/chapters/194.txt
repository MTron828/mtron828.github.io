Chapter 195: Ichthyosaurs

There were thousands of species hidden in the deep sea, occupying 70% of planet Earth, and the secrets were far more than any human could imagine.

The ocean has always been an unexplored area for humans.

Wang Xian stared at the fish tornado before him with fervent eyes and a relaxed expression on his face.

Eight hundred Devil Monkeys went up slowly to surround the fish tornado.

Food hunting!

This was the way for any living beings to evolve. Whoever can hunt to the last would be the most powerful being remaining.

Wang Xian jerked his Divine Dragon’s body and charged out to the school of fish at a daunting speed.

“Dragon Power!”

Boom!

An invisible force encompassed the area, spanning a thousand kilometers as though the King had arrived.

The entire school of swirling fish suddenly froze.

Wang Xian opened his mouth and devoured the school of fish before him.

Herring, Pacific mackerels and Spanish Mackerels converted to Dragon Energy in his belly at a rapid rate.

Boom!

The entire fish tornado was in chaos as they fled crazily in all directions.

Located in the middle of the school of fish, another type of fish teetered their huge bodies as they stared at Wang Xian with a ferocious look.

They swayed their tails and charged towards him.

Sensing the impetus of the five odd-looking fish types, Wang Xian revealed a surprising look on his face.

The five odd-looking fish were covered with layers of palm-sized fish scales which looked heavy in the water.

[Extractable Dragon Energy: 49,642]

“Ichthyosaurs. It’s the legendary Ichthyosaurs!”

When the five odd-looking fish were dashing towards him, their information appeared in Wang Xian’s mind. Ichthyosaurs belonged to an ancient fish group. According to the current historical study, they could have even existed way before the dinosaurs.

Based on the records, a large Ichthyosaurs could reach more than twenty meters long.

The current five Ichthyosaurs before him were only about ten meters.

“Five Ichthyosaurs could provide me with more than 200,000 points of Dragon Energy. Haha, not bad!”

Wang Xian was thrilled as he launched an attack at the five Ichthyosaurs without any fear.

Bam!

A Ichthyosaurs swam fast and furiously towards him with a gaping mouth that was three meters wide. Within its mouth, it was densely packed with teeth that looked terrifying.

Ka Ka Ka!

Wang Xian stretched out his metal-like dragon claw which scratched the top of that Ichthyosaurs’ mouth.

Hiss!

The razor-edged dragon claw ripped the mouth of the Ichthyosaurs. Blood splattered in all directions.

Growl!

Upon seeing that Wang Xian had wounded their companion, the other four Ichthyosaurs opened their mouths and attempted to bite him.

Grooo!

Wang Xian swung his tail, shaking the surroundings violently. Soon after, four solidified water balloons appeared at his tail.

Each of them was one meter in size, giving off an emerald-blue luster in the sea.

Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam!

Four water balloons emerged in front of the four Ichthyosaurs instantly and landed in their mouths.

Boom!

The water balloons exploded, and the four Ichthyosaurs were dripping blood from their mouths. Wang Xian stretched out his dragon claw at one of the Ichthyosaurs again.

Ssss!

Another sound of a tear was heard. Given Wang Xian’s current level, he possessed the same strength as an average Level-eleven marine animal. Five Ichthyosaurs were under his brutal torture!

“I don’t have time to waste on you!”

Wang Xian saw millions of fish fleeing away in all directions. Even with 800 Devil Monkeys surrounding the area, many fish still managed to make their escape.

He made a swift move and inflicted severe damage to the four Ichthyosaurs. He then moved around to devour the escaping fish.

Dragon Power encompassed the area as he swallowed the fish and converted them into Dragon Energy.

After half an hour, there were no more fish left — only dead silence.

Wang Xian made a swift move and came to the five Ichthyosaurs.

They were bigger than Wang Xian by many times with ten-meter-long bodies.

He opened his mouth and fed on the Ichthyosaurs. He only managed to swallow them all after chewing a dozen times. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Haha, my Dragon Energy increased by 300,000 points instantly. I still need about 100,000 points before I can hit Level 7!”

Wang Xian revealed his thrill. The higher level he got to, the better he could manage his control of the five elements. His strength would get stronger too.

A level-up was not solely about upgrading strength. It was more than that.

“Let’s go. I must level up to seven by the end of today!” Wang Xian commanded his subordinates and swam forward.

The surroundings were full of kelp while some glowing jellyfish were floating around.

The sea was not as dark as it seemed at a depth of fifty-meters deep. In the ocean, those deep waters with thousands of meters of depth were the place where darkness stayed.

Sunlight could only reach hundreds of meters.

“How wonderful it would be if I could find other Ichthyosaurs.”

Wang Xian had been swimming forward. Probably due to the fish tornado, the number of fish within dozens of miles was significantly reduced.

“What’s that? A shipwreck? I mean a bunch of shipwrecks?”

Wang Xian was slightly stupefied by a large number of shipwrecks in front of him. The sails were broken, lying around disorderly in the sea.

Some of the ships had half of their bodies caught at the bottom of the seabed.

Furthermore, Wang Xian noticed some strange plants were growing on some of the ships. It was rather peculiar.

“There’s something strange about the place before us!”

Just then, Wang Xian narrowed his eyes. He peered at the front, then to the back. Both of them gave him a different vibe as though they were two distinct regions.

“Dragon King, it’s the territory of other creatures ahead of us!”

Roving Heavens took his rod to Wang Xian and told Wang Xian with wary eyes, gazing at the place before them.

“Territory of other creatures?”

Wang Xian looked at Roving Heavens with some doubts.

“There are many creatures in the ocean. They will gather and occupy a region. Based on the size of the region, it will reflect the strength of the group!”

Roving Heavens observed the place ahead and said with a stern look, “The region ahead is not any smaller than our Devil Monkeys’. Since other marine life does not dare to come close, it means that a dominant race exists in this place.”

“Oh?”

Wang Xian nodded his head slowly. Most of the living creatures were living in groups. They could occupy one place and rule the land. Same logic for the ocean.

An eerie silence filled the area ahead. Obviously, it was the territory of a race.

“The battle of territory?”

Wang Xian looked behind as the Devil Monkeys gathered behind him. Prime Minister Turtle pulled the yacht to the side and came to the bottom of the sea.

Roving Girl and Roving Lobster were gazing ahead.

“We fight! Forward!”

Wang Xian was also bursting with fighting spirit as he swam slowly forward.

Roving Heavens, Prime Minister Turtle, nine venomous sea snakes, and the eight hundred Devil Monkeys were following solemnly behind him as they marched towards the region.

“Who dares to step into the Ichthyosaurs family’s territory?”

Just then, a muffled voice was heard.

The voice was not human, but a unique transmission through spirits.

Wang Xian could understand such spirit waves.

He stopped and looked ahead.

Roving Heavens and the rest stopped their motions too.

A gigantic Ichthyosaur, fifteen meters long floated out from one of the shipwrecks with a domineering demeanor!
