Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

The clones of Wang Xian, the Fallen Shadow Devil Emperor, and Jiuli flew rapidly into the universe ahead.

They did not hide anything.

As long as Jiuli made a breakthrough, all the powerhouses in the universe would be able to sense it.

Therefore, they did not need to hide anything.

Soon, they stepped into the interior of the Arnold Dao Universe.

Jiuli was wrapped in energy. When he entered this universe, he immediately sensed that he had broken through the shackles.

The next moment, he showed an excited expression.

In this universe, he could make a breakthrough.

Wang Yun and the others stopped in the void and did not go deep into it.

They looked at Jiuli.

“Lord Shadow Demon Emperor, Lord Dragon King, I can make a breakthrough immediately! ”

Jiuli said excitedly!

“Then let’s Make a breakthrough!”

Shadow Demon Emperor looked at Wang Yun and said with a smile!

During the last calamity, their demon race had disciples who could make a breakthrough.

However, due to the war with the Void Universe, Shadow Demon Emperor could not leave the nine-origin universe easily.

That was why he could not help his disciples to make a breakthrough.

However, with Wang Xian around, everything was much simpler.

Wang Xian stood at the side and nodded. “Let’s achieve a breakthrough. Our nine-origin universe will have one more heaven origin creator. ”

“Yes, My Lords! ”

Jiuli nodded. With a move, he immediately flew to the sky.

Rumble

In an instant, the weather changed. A large amount of energy from the entire universe was gathered in this direction.

Breakthrough, begin!

The enormous power pulled at the vibration of the universe.

Such a large disturbance immediately attracted the powerful disciples of this universe.

“What’s the situation?”

On the planet closest to this place, countless creatures looked over, their faces filled with shock.

“What terrifying power, what’s the situation? Could it be that other universe experts have invaded our Arnold Dao Universe?”

“I don’t know. Report to the Lords immediately. Report immediately! ”

The disciple of the Arnold universe immediately reported the situation here.

The calamity had begun, and the various universes had made a large number of arrangements.

Especially, the stronger the universe, the more arrangements there were!

There were three heaven origin creation level powerhouses in the Arnold Universe.

Although they weren’t very strong, they had made a large number of arrangements.

When the terrifying fluctuations came from this side, the three experts sensed something.

Someone wants to make a breakthrough in our Arnold Universe and occupy our Arnold Universe’s quota! ”

“Damn it, let’s go and see who it is that wants to occupy our Arnold Universe’s quota. ”

“Intruders appear, kill! ”

The three heaven origin blessed realm experts growled with gloomy faces.

They did not hesitate at all and directly rushed over through the teleportation array.

When breaking through to the heaven origin creation realm, one could not conceal one’s aura.

One could not hide it from the heaven origin creation realm experts in this universe.

And breaking through in someone else’s universe was an invasion!

No universe would allow such a thing to happen.

The three heaven origin creation realm experts quickly rushed to the nearest place through the teleportation array.

“There are intruders trying to break through before us!”

As they got closer, they were completely sure that someone was trying to snatch the spot in their universe.

This was equivalent to digging up the foundation of their Arnold Universe. The three heaven origin creation realm powerhouses flew over with murderous intent.

The spot where Jiuli broke through.

Wang Xian, the fallen Shadow Demon Emperor, stood at the side and watched quietly.

At this moment, Wang Xian sensed something and looked to the right. “Dragon King, are there any powerhouses here?”

The Fallen Shadow Demon Emperor looked at Wang Xian and asked.

This was just a clone of the Fallen Shadow Demon Emperor. It only had the strength of someone who had just entered the Heaven’s origin realm.

Naturally, its senses were not as good as Wang Xian ‘s.

“They’re here. There are three of them. It shouldn’t be a problem! ”

Wang Xian nodded his head and said!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

In less than five seconds, three figures appeared in his line of sight!

“You ‘re courting death. How dare you make a breakthrough in our Arnold Universe! ”

The moment the three figures flew over, the figure in the middle roared with a face full of killing intent!

Buzz

Wang Xian looked at them. With a wave of his arm, an extremely huge phantom image of a dragon head floated in the void and was facing them.

The Phantom image of the dragon head emitted a nine-colored radiance and contained an extremely terrifying aura!

The Phantom image of the Dragon Head did not move. It stared coldly at the three heaven origin creation stage powerhouses.

“Not good!”

The three heaven origin creation stage powerhouses felt the terrifying aura from the phantom image of the Dragon Head. Their expressions changed slightly.

From this phantom image of the dragon head, they could feel the threat of death.

“Oh no, the opponent has a dao protector, and his strength is extremely terrifying! ”

A heavenly fate realm powerhouse from the Arnold Dao Universe had an ugly expression.

Dao Protector.

A Dao Protector for a powerhouse who had broken through.

Under such circumstances, the power of the Dao protector was above the control level!

“Who are you people? How dare you break through in our Arnold Dao Universe? How dare you occupy our Arnold Dao Universe’s quota? Aren’t you afraid of Our Revenge?”

“How strong are you guys? How can you withstand our sneak attack?” The Heaven’s origin creator on the left spoke with a gloomy face.

There was a hint of threat in his tone.

Wang Xian heard it and looked over.

Buzz

In the next moment, his body disappeared.

Following that, his body appeared next to the powerhouse who spoke just now.

The powerhouse who spoke was only at the beginner level.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The gap between him and Wang Xian was too huge!

Before he could react, Wang Xian had already appeared in front of him.

Buzz

A terrifying aura pressed down on him. Wang Xian stared at him calmly and said, “If you want a spot, you can leave! ”

“What! You…”

The powerhouse who was in the Heaven’s origin realm trembled violently under the influence of Wang Xian’s aura. His face turned pale. He opened his mouth, and his pupils revealed a look of horror.

Wang Xian’s terrifying aura made him tremble.

He arrived in front of him in an instant. Just by relying on his aura alone, he felt his scalp go numb.

This was definitely not something that an existence at the level of control could do.

“An expert at the level of the Great Dao! ”

He let out a low roar in fear and stared at Wang Xian.

Wang Xian did not say a word. He quietly flew to his previous position and waited for Jiuli to complete her breakthrough!

“Hiss, it’s an existence at the level of the Great Dao. There’s another powerhouse at the level of the Heaven’s origin. They are not someone we can fight against! ”

“This is a powerful universe. They are here to protect their disciples. ”

The three powerhouses at the level of the Heaven’s origin in the Arnold

Universe looked extremely embarrassed.

They were somewhat powerless.

However, at the same time, they were also somewhat relieved.

Fortunately, the other party did not have any intention of attacking their universe.

If the other party attacked their universe, they would not be able to resist at all..
