Chapter 635: Wet Their Pants (1)

“Wow, there are so many people around!”

“Yeah, take a look ahead. Oh gosh! That’s Ling Tianyue. The singing diva of Asia, Ling Tianyue!”

“That’s the movie star, Liu Kongfei. There are so many stars here!”

“There are so many stars from our country! And there are several stars from Japan and Korea too!”

“Other than those elite stars, there are also a substantial number of famous businessmen and rich second-generations. There are so many people from our country!”

“Hehe! Let’s see if there are any nice outfits here. We can buy some here!”

Xiao Yu, Lan Qingyue, Adjaya, and the two other girls discussed excitedly.

“I’ll show you something great tonight. If there’s anything nice, I’ll get it for you!” Wang Xian interrupted upon hearing their conversation.

This was the second objective of Wang Xian for coming to this place. Buying some clothes for them.

Wearing various styles would be pleasing to the eyes.

“I know you wouldn’t be so nice to us suddenly!”

Lan Qingyue rolled her eyes at him. She turned to hold Adjaya’s arms and commented, “I feel that with sister Adjaya’s height and figure, she would definitely be the center of attention in a fashion show!”

“Yeah! Sister-in-law Adjaya’s figure is really great. If only I had a figure as great as you!”

“What are you looking at!?”

At this moment, a furious voice came from behind them. “No matter how great my figure is, I’m just a toy. Aren’t I pretty?”

“Guys like you are creatures that will only think with your lower half!”

At this moment, the group could hear the voices of girls from behind their backs. Their voices were sharp and annoying.

Wang Xian frowned slightly and turned around.

There was a group of five behind them. Of which, three were girls while two were guys. Wang Xian could recognize one of the girls and one of the guys. They were some small stars within the country.

To put it bluntly, there were stars without significant works or capabilities that had only become stars through marketing gimmicks.

The other two girls were roughly twenty to thirty years old and were wearing branded clothes throughout. One was slightly plump while the other had the face of an internet celebrity.

The slightly plump girl was unhappy with the guy beside her, who was staring at her.

“I’ve just taken a glance! Not a second more!” the guy said apologetically to the girl.

“You are not allowed to take even a glance. If you dare to look at other vixens again, don’t blame me for not being courteous!” [1]

The slightly plump girl stared at the guy and spoke with a domineering front.

“Alright, alright!”

The guy nodded his head profusely, seemingly a little afraid of that plump girl.

“Tsk! You are the ugly one and yet you still dare call others a vixen!”

Upon hearing the girl behind her, Xiao Yu looked over in contempt and blurted this out.

With her brother around, there was nothing she was afraid of. If someone was insulting them, Xiao Yu would naturally retort.

“What? Who are you calling ugly? Who are you talking about?”

When the slightly plump girl heard Xiao Yu, the excess flesh on her face constricted as she stared harshly at Xiao Yu.

“The ugly person would know. What are you getting so worked up for?” Xiao Yu smirked and replied plainly.

“Tsk! Some people might have a pretty face but their hearts are black. No one knows how many men they have slept with. Yuanyuan, don’t be bothered by them!”

“That’s right! Some girls might be pretty but no one knows how dirty their bodies are!”

The other two girls beside the plump girl stared coldly at Xiao Yu and the girls while ridiculing them.

“I have seen many pretty girls, especially in the entertainment circle. Those pretty girls will do anything to make their names known... Hehe!” the male star standing by the side said to the plump girl.

“They don’t even have a branded piece on them and yet they dare to be here. They definitely are sugar babies. However, their sugar daddy is probably a poor f*ck!”

The slightly plump lady looked at Xiao Yu and the girls and jealousy gleamed in her eyes as she remarked ruthlessly.

“You are...”

“Ticket check! Please take out your ticket!”

Just as Xiao Yu and the girls were about to retort, they heard the voice of the employee ahead.

They stopped and simply stared at the group.

“Watch your words and don’t bring yourself unnecessary troubles. You guys wouldn’t be able to take it!”

Wang Xian stared emotionlessly at the group of five as he issued his warning.

“Hehe! Who do you think we are? We wouldn’t be able to take it?”

The guy who was standing by the side with his arms on his waist and earrings in his ears stared at Wang Xian with contempt upon hearing him.

“I’m sorry ladies, these tickets are fake!”

At this moment, the voice of the employee sounded.

“What?”

“What?”

Xiao Yu, Lan Qingyue and the girls were stunned and exclaimed in astonishment.

Wang Xian raised an eyebrow and a tinge of killing intent flashed across his eyes. He turned, ignoring the male star. He turned around and said, “We got these tickets from a reseller!”

“I’m sorry. These are indeed fake tickets. Since you bought them from non-official channels, we won’t be able to take responsibility for it!”

The young employee apologized upon hearing Wang Xian.

“Haha! Fake tickets! How interesting! Could it be that you couldn’t afford the real tickets and made some fake tickets with the hope of getting in?”

“That’s a real possibility. Just take a look at the way they’re dressed! It’s within reason to think that they couldn’t afford the tickets.”

Ridicule from the guys and girls sounded from behind them, annoying Wang Xian.

The clothes on Xiao Yu, Lan Qingyue and the girls were all Level 12 spiritual equipment that he had refined. It was just that the style was similar to modern clothing.

Without any labels, they were seen as cheap clothing in the eyes of others.

“How dare they lie to me. They must be tired of living!”

At the thought of the young man who had sold him the fake tickets, ruthlessness flashed across his eyes.

“Get out of the way! Why are you still standing there? Don’t delay our entrance!”

Once again, the voices of the girls and guys behind them sounded.

“Huh? What happen?”

“What’s the matter?”

The commotion at the entrance had instantly drawn the attention of the surrounding crowd.

The truth was some people had noticed this place when the quarrel started.

“I think they bought some fake tickets!”

“Fake tickets? Tickets can be verified directly. Why would there still be people falling for the fake tickets?”

The surrounding crowd discussed in shock.

“That guy... He looks familiar!”

“Huh? He... He... He is!”

“Gosh! It’s him! It’s really him! In that case, those girls with him...”

At this moment, some middle-aged and old men around him opened their eyes widely as astonishment was written all over their faces.

There was a person whose name was known throughout the world. It was especially so since a month ago.

In that catastrophe, all the families and sects in the country circulated a photo to warn all people not to court their own deaths. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have to trouble the people in the photos to take action. Their families and sects would kill them personally.

Following which, news of this incident had also reached all the rich and wealthy businessmen in the country. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

When this group of rich and wealthy businessmen heard the news, they almost wet their pants!
