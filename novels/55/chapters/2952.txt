Chapter 2953: King 3 in the starry sky

“Roar! Roar! Roar!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

In the center of the glazed domain, a roaring sound could be heard.

Ao crab’s huge figure was hovering in the void. He raised his head high and was filled with a powerful aura.

“Dragon King, everything is settled!”

!!

He looked in the direction of Wang Xian. His face was filled with excitement.

“Very strong!”

Wang Xian praised with a smile.

“Hehe!”

Ao crab smiled and flew over in his human form.

Behind him, there were densely packed corpses in the air. The two demon caves were floating in the air. They did not have any imposing manner. On the contrary, the demon caves looked rather beautiful.

In less than three minutes, ao crab had taken care of all the demons in the two demon caves.

The Heaven Array moved and collected the surrounding corpses.

“Let’s go and take a look inside the demon cave. We can also upgrade the level of the Dragon Palace!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he flew straight into a demon cave.

The entire demon cave was filled with a violent and bloody aura. It was somewhat similar to what he had seen on Earth.

The huge demon cave was bigger than a large planet. It was filled with an unpleasant smell.

“Dragon King, this demon cave can be devoured by our devouring dragon. If the entire demon cave is devoured, it will be able to increase the combat strength of a third level divine emperor.”

Ao crab sized up the entire demon cave.

The demon cave was like a swallow’s nest. It was made from various materials and their own energy.

This demon cave was very special. It was different from the divine kingdom and divine artifacts, but it could be summoned.

It had a very special energy.

And this kind of energy could be directly devoured by the devouring dragon.

The energy contained in the huge demon cave was enough to build a level 3 divine Emperor Devouring Dragon.

“Ao crab, your devouring dragon can devour anything. If you attack the chimei territory, you can still improve a lot!”

Tian Chen walked in and said with a smile.

“Our Devouring Dragon is the core of the universe’s insect clan. In the universe, 80% of the energy of the insect clan can be directly devoured. Of course, this energy can.”

Ao crab said.

“TSK, tsk. You have to know that in the demon cave, besides these, there are many evil lairs. These lairs are similar to the god country. Your Devouring Dragon can also get a lot of resources!”

Sky Array said in astonishment.

This was the peak race in the universe, a peak existence that was far from what ordinary races could compare to.

“Hehe!”

Ao crab cracked his mouth and laughed happily.

The current million members of the devouring dragon were much stronger than the other departments of the Dragon Palace.

Moreover, this demon lair was a resource, and each demonic nest was in the demon lair.

This lair was no different from the divine kingdom. It was also a huge energy resource.

In other words, these two demon lairs could increase the number of celestial thearch-level members in the Devouring Dragon.

The number of celestial thearch-level Rank-3 members could also increase by three.

Wang Xian and the other two quickly flew towards the depths of the demon lair. Soon, they arrived at the celestial thearch-level demon lair.

As they continued to fly deeper into the demon lair, they arrived at the celestial emperor-level lair.

“The Dragon Palace is still lacking the void divine kingdom with the six attributes of gold, wood, water, thunder, light, and darkness. Other than the light attribute, there are all the other attributes!”

When they reached the depths, Wang Xian swept his gaze across the area. With a wave of his arm, he absorbed all the lair with the few attributes into the Dragon Palace.

“Let’s go to the other demon lair and take a look!”

Very soon, he searched the other demon cave. There was no light attribute demon lair of the celestial thearch. This made him feel slightly helpless.

“There might be fewer demons with the light attribute. Ao he, get your men to devour this demon cave!”

After flying out of the Demon Cave, Wang Xian said to Ao he.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao he immediately nodded his head.

“That’s right!”

At this moment, Wang Xian suddenly raised his eyebrows as he thought of something.

Buzz

His body trembled as a corner of the Dragon Palace slowly appeared behind him.

“An lie!”

Wang Xian shouted in a deep voice.

“Dragon King, I’m here. Why are you calling me?”

A low voice came from the Dragon Palace.

Buzz

With a thought, he summoned a figure over.

It was the former son of the Demonic Dragon, an lie.

An lie had once fused with the soul of the Demonic Dragon on Earth and became the son of the demonic dragon. After realizing that the body of the demonic dragon was a little strange, he came to the boundless star field.

In the boundless star field, an lie had summoned a large number of demonic beasts and started a huge war.

Later on, Wang Xian met him and took control of the body of the demonic dragon. An lie also kneeled down and begged for mercy.

After that, the body of the demonic dragon was taken away. He stayed in the Dragon Palace. Initially, he mingled with the eight-limbed demonic fiend and the others. Later on, he had a good relationship with Feng Lingtian.

After that, he continued to cultivate in the dragon palace. Wang Xian did not bother him much.

Prime Minister Gui asked him to transform into a dragon. However, he did not agree and said that he wanted to find a chance to evolve into a demonic dragon.

Currently, he had the combat strength of a level nine godly king. He was not weak, but he was not strong either.

It was said that this fellow had found a dolphin girl to be his girlfriend in the Dragon Palace.

His days were also very comfortable.

In fact, an lie had already lived for a very long time. He was an expert who was revived when the spiritual energy on Earth was revived.

However, his identity seemed to be that of a villain.

He was involved in the evil disaster on Earth.

If not now encounter evil, Wang Xian almost forgot this guy.

“Long live the Dragon King! Long live the Dragon King!”

Dark strong figure just came out, he immediately knelt in front of Wang Xian and shouted loudly.

“This shameless character is on par with the eight-limbed fiend!”

At the side, Tian Chen said with a smile.

“Alright, let’s see if this demonic cave is familiar. Back then, you summoned quite a number of demonic beasts.”

Wang Xian said to him speechlessly.

“Oh? Demonic Cave?”

An lie looked at this demonic cave as his eyes sparkled.

“Dragon King, the level of this demonic cave is so high. There are at least third level void God realm demonic beasts inside.”

He sized it up and said with a face full of shock.

“Yes, you are more familiar with this Yao Xie. Do you know how to control this demon cave?”

Wang Xian asked him.

“Dragon King, I am very familiar with this demon cave. Before I was resurrected on Earth, I was infected by the demon cave and almost turned into a Yao Xie. When I received the information about the Yao Xie, I suddenly encountered a destructive attack and died.”

“However, I am very clear about the control of this demon lair and how to summon a demon.”

An lie patted his chest and said.

“Oh? Can you control the two demon lairs?”

Wang Xian asked him.

“Yes. I will pass the control method to leader Ao crab. With the darkness and earth elemental energy in his body, I can control it too!”

An lie said.

“Alright, Go and try!”

Wang Xian nodded and said to him.

“No Problem!”

As an lie said that, he waved at ao crab and flew into the Devil Lair.

Wang Xian and the rest immediately followed behind.
