Chapter 188: I’m Wang Xian (2)

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

The members of the Lan Family were conversing joyously. The number of people who had attended this wedding was completely beyond their expectations.

Old Qin had come personally and the majority of the Ancient Martial Artist Families in Rivertown had already arrived.

This made them feel extremely proud and lucky at the same time.

They felt lucky that they were having a wedding with the Liu Family.

This political marriage would bring the Lan Family countless intangible benefits.

“Even the Ancient Martial Artist Families in Rivertown are wary of the Liu Family and are here to show goodwill. This political marriage is worth it!” a young member of the Lan Family commented happily.

The surrounding members of the Lan Family also smiled radiantly.

As the guests entered the villa one after another, the Lan Family noticed that the majority of the wealthy men and Ancient Martial Artist Families of Rivertown had all arrived.

There were a total of three to four hundred of them. This was undoubtedly a huge number.

Together with the guests from the Lan Family and the Liu Family, the number of people attending this engagement ceremony was over a thousand.

Within a room in the Flowing Water Villa, Lan Qingyue sat in front of the dressing table without emotions.

Behind her, several maids were helping her put up exquisite makeup and adjusting her beautiful white engagement ceremony dress.

“Sister Lan, you should be a little more thrilled. Today’s your big day! Do you know how many people are out there? There are at least a thousand of them! Oh my god! I heard that the wealthy people in Rivertown have all arrived. Moreover, there are many influential figures from Hailing Province.”

“The Liu Family is truly incredible in Hailing Province. Moreover, Liu Feiyun’s fame has spread far and wide despite his young age, and many refer to him as the “Little Sword Celestial.” Qingyue, you are really blessed!”

Beside her, a young lady commented.

Lan Qingyue’s eyes flickered and were filled with fatigue and indignance. She looked at the reflection of herself in the mirror.

She was beautiful but she didn’t like the white dress. She preferred a red wedding gown.

However, she did not say it out loud. This was because she wasn’t a willing party to this engagement.

If it wasn’t for the Lan Family, or if the person she liked had the same feelings for her, she would have never agreed to the engagement.

“Qingyue, are you done?”

At this moment, the door to the room opened. Liu Feiyun was wearing a neat set of attire.

This attire wasn’t a suit but a family costume of the Liu Family.

Slightly above the chest area, the word “Liu” was imprinted on it. There was also an image of an Ethereal Flower embroidered onto the costume.

He had a sword behind him that indicated his identity as a member of the Liu Family who was known for their Tyrannical Sword.

His attire wasn’t typical for an engagement ceremony but it was, in fact, the most formal costume of the Liu Family.

“I’ll be done right away.”

Lan Qingyue nodded her head slowly and replied without turning her head over.

Seeing how she reacted, a cold look flashed in the eyes of Liu Feiyun. As he looked at Lan Qingyue from top to bottom, vile thoughts arose in his mind. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“The engagement ceremony will begin in half an hour. Qingyue, get dressed properly. We have a lot of people that have come from Hailing Province!” Liu Feiyun said. His lips curved into a smile as he turned around and left.

“Qingyue, look! Look at how charming Liu Feiyun is! You and he are the real perfect couple!” the young lady by her side commented.

Lan Qingyue didn’t respond to it and simply looked into the mirror with hollow eyes.

The golf course of Flowing Water Villa had been modified into a large engagement ceremony field.

On it, there were over a hundred exquisite tables with delicious food on them.

At the center, there was a pathway laid by the red carpet.

At the front of it, there was an elevated platform set up for the engagement ceremony. The stage was huge and the place looked just like the launch event of major popular brands.

Although it was outdoors, the surrounding decoration was luxurious with a tinge of romance.

At this moment, the guests of the Liu Family and the Lan Family were seated to the left and right respectively.

“Sect Leader Tang, please come in. I had not expected Sect Leader Tang to attend our Lan Family’s wedding. It is truly our honor!”

At this moment, several members of the Lan Family welcomed Sect Leader Tang and a dozen members of the Thistles and Thorns Sect enthusiastically before leading them to their seats.

“Hehe, Director Lan! How could the Thistles and Thorns Sect stay out of today’s event!”

Sect Leader Tang looked across the crowd from Rivertown and commented with a faint smile.

“Yes, yes. Thank you for coming! Everyone, please!” the middle-aged man and the other members of the Lan Family replied joyously.

They had never expected Sect Leader Tang of the Thistles and Thorns Sect from the Southern Province to lead their members to attend this engagement ceremony.

This was a Second-class Force!

“Who would have expected the Lan Family to have so many guests? The Sect Leader of Thistles and Thorns Sect from the Southern Province is even here personally. Moreover, the Qin Family and the majority of Ancient Martial Artist Families from Rivertown have all come!”

“Haha, they aren’t doing this for the Lan Family. Instead, they are showing respect to the Tyrannical Sword of the Liu Family. If the Lan Family could really invite them over, they wouldn’t be so badly bullied by Lingyue Sect.”

“That’s true. Those people from the Southern Province and Rivertown wouldn’t be here if not for the Liu Family.”

To the left of the crowd from Rivertown, the guests of Liu Family were looking at the guests of the Lan Family while whispering softly.

Around the table closest to the stage, seven to eight members of the Liu Family and Lan Family sat around.

An old man with a white beard sat on the seat for the host. He looked around satisfactorily and said to the old man beside him, “The Lan Family sure has a lot of guests!”

“Haha, Old Liu. I’m sure you know that they are here mainly because of you!” the old man from the Lan Family replied courteously.

“Haha, that’s true. The Tyrannical Sword of the Liu Family is still rather influential around the surrounding provinces. Your granddaughter is really lucky to be marrying my grandson.”

The old man with a white beard wasn’t humble at all as he remarked arrogantly.

“Yes, yes!” the old man from the Lan Family nodded his head. A tinge of embarrassment flashed passed his eyes.

The other members of the Lan Family simply exchanged pleasantries with the other members of the Liu Family.

The difference between the strength of the two parties had determined the difference in their status.

Just as they were conversing, the guests around them consciously and unconsciously looked over.

“Who would have expected Old Liu to be here? He’s the pillar of the Liu Family!”

“Old Liu rarely shows up in the Liu Family’s villa. He probably rushed over for his beloved grandson’s engagement ceremony!”

“Old Liu has reached the Inborn Realm for over twenty years. His strength is probably even more horrifying at this moment!”

The crowd discussed softly. With an Inborn expert sitting right there, it was hard for them to not pay attention to this area.

“It seems like I’m not too late!”

At this moment, a young man walked over slowly. He looked towards the Liu Family with a smile before walking to the location at the front.

When the Ancient Martial Artists of Rivertown saw Wang Xian, they held their breath as they saw him walking ahead...

And he sat around the table with Old Qin, Old Duan, Old Xue, Sect Leader Tang and others.
