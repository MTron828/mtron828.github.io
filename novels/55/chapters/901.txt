Chapter 902: Light and darkness

Translator: 549690339

In the past two days, the holy sea town had been filled with blood. Even the ordinary people could feel the special atmosphere of the holy sea town.

Whether it was the restaurants, the teahouses, or the demon hunters mercenary group, everyone was in a panic.

All of the reasons were because of the dragon assassin group.

The five strikes of the dragon assassin group had shocked everyone.

Everyone was afraid. What if their enemies hired the Dragon Assassin to assassinate them?

Everyone had their own thoughts. If they could kill a level 5 transcendent on the street, who couldn’t be assassinated by the Dragon Assassin?

At night, some people took action.

At seven or eight o’clock in the evening, when Saint Sea Town was still bustling with activity, old men picked up interspatial rings from their fixed positions.

After checking the things inside, they left with smiles on their faces.

These old men looked very ordinary. They had already lived in Saint Sea Town for more than half of their lives and knew many people.

No one would doubt them.

However, at this moment, it was this group of people who had become the secret informants of the Dragon Assassin organization.

No one would have thought that.

“Do it!”

When the rewards were obtained one by one, it was time for the Dragon Assassin to perform.

In this mission, the strongest one was a transcendent rank 6 powerhouse, the Patriarch of the Holy Sea Town family.

His strength could be ranked in the top ten in the entire holy sea town.

In holy sea town, only the mayor was a transcendent rank 9, there was only one rank 8, three or four rank 7, and rank 6, which was already considered top-notch.

There was only one rank six expert in the mission.

In the past, it was impossible to assassinate a rank six expert with a dragon spike, but now, it was easy for a fully-formed dragon ao Yao to assassinate him.

It was even possible to assassinate a rank seven transcendent with 70% certainty. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Moreover, for the Ao Yao, there was no difference between night and day.

The night passed quickly.

“Someone’s been killed!”

“It’s a dragon spike, a dragon Spike!”

“Master!”

“Leader!”

At dawn today, the people of Holy Sea town were woken up by screams of shock.

In the entire holy sea town, especially in the central area, more than ten screams shook the central area.

In the mayor’s mansion in the center of Holy Sea Town, a middle-aged man instantly floated in the sky, his blue eyes sweeping around.

“Father, what happened?”

At this moment, a woman also flew into the void, looking at the middle-aged man with a surprised face.

“The appearance of the dragon Spike has made some people go crazy!”

The middle-aged man looked at the nearest place and said slowly.

“Crazy?”

The woman seemed to be deep in thought, looking at the middle-aged man with a shocked expression, “That is? The Fenglian Family? Their patriarch?”

Her eyes widened in shock.

The patriarch of the Feng Lian family was one of the top five families in holy sea town. Now, the Patriarch had been assassinated.

“Hehe, that’s good too. Killing is peace!”

The middle-aged man said with a smile. Then, he flew down.

“Killing is peace?”

The woman murmured with a puzzled expression.

“Patriarch Feng Lian was assassinated, a rank 6 transcendent!”

“The captain of the Dogfish mercenary group was also killed, another rank 6 transcendent!”

“The ancient forger was assassinated, a rank 5 transcendent!”

“My God, I heard that in one night, two rank 6 experts, eight rank 5 experts, nine rank 4 transcendents, and thirteen rank 3 transcendents were assassinated!”

“Crazy, crazy, it was the dragon assassin organization. In one night, in one night, more than 30 experts were killed!”

“Congratulations on your death. When the Dragon Assassin’s congratulatory note arrived, it proved that you were already dead!”

“The head of the Fenglian family, the head of the Bei family, the head of the Qing family, the head of the Zhou family, the leader of the horned shark mercenary group, and the leader of the black ape mercenary group all died in one night!”

The whole holy sea town was in an uproar.

If the four people had been assassinated yesterday, then after that night, everyone was terrified!

Everyone’s faces were pale. Even the people who had hired the dragon assassin group yesterday looked a little embarrassed.

Because yesterday, they could hire the dragon assassin group, and today, the other party could also hire the Dragon Assassin Group.

Fear rose in everyone’s hearts.

“Wu Sandao, come out. The enmity between the two of us should be resolved today. Either we settle it peacefully, or we can go up to the arena and have a battle to settle our enmity. No one is to hire a dragon spike to assassinate us. Do you agree or not?”

“Alright, Little Tiger. I was just about to look for you. Come, Let’s go to the restaurant. Let’s settle our enmity today!”

“Kong family, Ge family is here to settle our grudges today. Come out. In this situation, you guys don’t want to fight to the death, right?”

“Alright, let’s settle our grudges today. Whoever hires the dragon assassin will die a horrible death!”

“Alright, a battle between Gentlemen, fair and Square!”

In the morning, some people couldn’t sit still anymore.

F * CK, in this world where martial force was respected, which family didn’t have an enemy?

What if the enemy hired the dragon assassin organization?

They could only settle their grudges peacefully!

Thus, under the dumbstruck gazes of everyone in holy sea town, the families that used to fight each other with swords.

Those mercenary groups that wanted the other party dead or alive.

And those enemies that had grudges.

Today, they sat in the restaurant and the teahouse to negotiate and reconcile.

After the negotiations were successful, those hostile families stood up and shook hands with each other before heaving a sigh of relief and leaving.

Seeing this scene, everyone was dumbstruck.

F * ck, in the past, it was said that they would not rest until one of them was dead? Why did they shake hands and make peace now?

Did they have any sense of shame?

However, the people involved knew that this matter was not a matter of whether they were shameless or not.

If their opponents suddenly became ruthless and found a dragon to assassinate them, wouldn’t they be in trouble?

They didn’t want to die either. If their faces were gone, they would be gone. If their lives were gone, they would lose everything.

After a night of slaughter, the entire holy sea town actually became much more harmonious.

However, what happened next shocked everyone.

At noon, five or six families of holy sea town collectively opened their doors of charity to help the poor families and the elderly who lived in Holy Sea Town!

Even an alchemist family provided free medical aid to the poor.

Seeing this scene, everyone widened their eyes.

F * ck, all the families in holy sea town were going to do a good deed?

“This dragon spike is so terrifying. The family that our city guards had to be careful with in the past, the mercenary group, is actually doing a good deed today!”

“The rule of the dragon spike is not to kill good people. I heard that someone wanted to assassinate the head of the Tang family. The commission was very high, so the dragon spike directly rejected it.”

“The dragon Spike’s three no kills actually caused the current situation.”

A group of city guards walked on the streets as they patrolled. When they saw this scene, they were somewhat dumbstruck.

The Darkness had already arrived, bringing not only slaughter but also light.

There was also light!
