3705 The interior of the 3704 heaven opening primal continent was shaking!

“Hehe, let’s go. Let’s go to the territory of the Space Beasts!”

Wang Xian heard their words and smiled faintly!

In the invincible territory, the old monsters of the two peak races were completely terrified!

They were either hiding in extremely secret places or escaping back to their races. It was already extremely difficult to find them!

Wang Xian did not plan to continue searching.

He headed towards the territory of the Space Beasts and killed the group of Space Beasts.

After killing the group of Space Beasts, Wang Xian’s trip to the invincible zone this time could be considered to be very successful!

“It’s the Dragon King!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Wu Sha and the rest replied and followed Wang Xian towards the territory of the Space Beasts!

Just as Wang Xian was heading towards the territory of the space beasts and was about to start a massacre, news from the outside suddenly caused an uproar within the heaven-splitting chaotic land!

This news came from within the Invincible Zone!

It also came from the declaration of an expert from the top race, the Angel Race’s dark angels!

When Wang Xian launched a massacre in the invincible zone against the experts from the angel race and the Phoenix race, he completely infuriated the old monsters from the two top races!

Especially the dark angels!

All along, it was the angels of light who attacked the Dragon King. In the end, they were met with an undeserved calamity!

They had been attacked by the Dragon King!

Hundreds of dark angels had even died at the hands of the Dragon King!

This filled the dark angels who had escaped from the invincible zone with anger!

The Dark Angels who had escaped had found their elders and come to complain!

Although it was the angels who had been besieging the Dragon King, there was still some difference between the angels of light and the Angels of Darkness!

The Angel of Darkness had also suffered the consequences of the incident with the Angel of Light, which made a ruler-level powerhouse of the Angel of Darkness very unhappy!

“This Dragon King is simply too arrogant. The angel of light attacked him, but he actually killed our disciple. He’s simply courting death.”

The eyes of a ruler-level powerhouse of darkness were filled with coldness!

He naturally couldn’t blame the angel of light for this matter. The Angel of light and the Angel of Darkness were two different races, but they were also one race. They both had the same emperor of angels!

“Dragon King, you killed our Angel of Darkness wantonly in the invincible region. Your Dragon Palace, just you wait. One day, I will kill you all!”

The ruler-level Dark Angel declared on the universe’s AI!

Because of a ruler-level powerhouse’s declaration on the universe’s AI, it had attracted the attention of many powerhouses!

In particular, some things in the invincible region had become very big. The powerhouses and disciples of other peak races had also received the news!

This caused them to join in as well, and they were all discussing amongst themselves within the invincible region!

“I heard from a senior within the race that the Dragon King had swept through the invincible region and captured seven mad demons, killing two or three mad demon level experts. In addition, the angel race and the Phoenix race had over 800 universe overlords with level 3 combat strength surrounding him, and all of them were killed?”

“This Dragon King is a little abnormal. He is definitely not an ordinary mutated divine dragon. Even mad demon level existences in the invincible territory could be killed instantly. It’s simply terrifying. Under the Dominators, he is absolutely invincible!”

“Invincible, truly invincible under the Dominators. It seems that the Dragon Palace will soon rise to the pinnacle of the race!”

On the universe AI, the disciples of the pinnacle races were discussing in shock!

The disciples of the top races were discussing, and the experts of the high-level races in the heaven opening primal continent could naturally see it!

They looked at the news one by one, and their faces were full of shock!

“No Way? The Dragon King is really invincible in the Invincible Zone?”

“Hiss, is this true? Even the experts and disciples of the top races said that the Dragon King is invincible below the Overlord Level?”

“The Dragon King actually killed two experts of the top races and made them escape from the invincible zone. This… he even subdued seven of the strongest existences in the invincible zone. This is simply unbelievable!”

“How Strong is the Dragon King Now? How could he make one overlord of the Angel race so angry? More than 800 universe overlords with level three combat strength besieged the Dragon King, but all of them were killed by the Dragon King?”? “Even a real universe ruler at level one or level two wouldn’t be this strong, right?”

When the powerhouses of all the races in the heaven opening primal continent received this information, their faces were filled with disbelief and shock!

How long had the Dragon King been in the Invincible Zone?

Just a few years?

However, a few years had actually caused the entire invincible zone to tremble!

It had caused the experts of the two pinnacle races to escape from the invincible region!

And they were truly invincible!

This battle record was unprecedented for anyone below the universe ruler!

“The experts of the pinnacle races all said that the Dragon Palace will soon become a pinnacle race. It seems that the Dragon Palace is really going to rise!”

“I really can’t believe that the Dragon Palace is actually going to reach the pinnacle race in such a short period of time. The Dragon King is too strong. This is simply reproducing the glory of the Dragon God lineage!”

“The Dragon King is about to do what the leader of the ancestral dragon failed to do.”

The experts of the high-level races were discussing on the universal ai!

“Hehe!”

At the same time, in the Dragon Palace, Prime Minister Gui and the experts of the Dragon Palace looked at the information on the universal AI with pride!

This was their Dragon King!

Their Invincible Dragon King!

“This time, the Dragon King has brought too many resources. The Dragon Palace will definitely be able to achieve a terrifying improvement!”

Prime Minister Gui stood in the dragon transformation pool and looked ahead with a smile.

This time, Wang Xian had killed more than a thousand level 3 universe masters in the Invincible Zone!

Among them, the corpses of many experts were more than twice, or even three to four times stronger than the level 3 universe Dominators!

Other than these, there were also the corpses of the space beasts and about 5,000 floating wooden-winged birds!

These floating wooden-winged birds were the level 2 universe Dominators’desolate beasts!

5,000 of them, a total of 5,000 of them!

It was enough to increase the Dragon Palace’s strength by 500 universe ruler Level 3 experts!

Other than that, there was also a large number of God kingdoms and Connate Numinous Treasures!

In short, the Dragon Palace’s increase this time was unprecedented!

The Dragon Palace experts would also reach an extremely terrifying level!

Not to mention being comparable to peak races, at least in terms of foundation, the Dragon Palace had obtained a huge increase this time!

However, the outside world did not know all of this!

When the Dragon Palace showed its strength again, even the peak race would be surprised!
