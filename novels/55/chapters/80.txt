“Come over. Both of you stay beside me.” Wang Xian tugged on Xiao Yu’s arm as he spoke to her.

“Brother, forget it. I know you’re making some money. But... But it’s too expensive here.”

Xiao Yu looked at those luxury brands around her with her eyebrows knit. She knew that her brother was making some money, but she also understood how hard it was for her brother to work for it.

She had remained thrifty since young. Hence, she had no desire for these branded clothes except for the practical stuff.

Moreover, the clothes here were too expensive. How much money could her brother have?

“Just follow me.” Wang Xian’s heart ached for his sister as he stroked her hair.

Girls at her age often asked for money to buy clothes and makeup. But his sister was unwilling to spend money on expensive food just to save up.

“Xiao Yu, stop being naggy and follow me today. I know how much I have and how much I can spend. I’m not spending it blindly,” Wang Xian stared at Xiao Yu and said solemnly.

“Well... Fine then.” Upon seeing the serious look on her brother’s face, Xiao Yu was touched as she held his hand.

“That’s better. Follow me!”

With a smile on his face, Wang Xian walked straight into the Prada store.

“Welcome!”

The greeters at the door immediately greeted them.

Wang Xian brought them around as he looked at the clothes. He nodded with satisfaction and told the salesgirl, “Get them a set of clothes each. I want pretty clothes that are suitable for their age.”

The salesgirl was slightly stunned as she looked at Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi. Hastily, she nodded. “Yes, Sir. Ladies, please come over here. It’s the summer season now, and girls look the best in skirts. This is the most popular Prada skirt series this year. Both of you look like students. This series suits students the most.”

The salesgirl introduced the clothes to Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi enthusiastically.

Xiao Yu was stunned. She saw the dresses which the salesgirls were holding onto. They were pretty, but her gaze drifted to the price tag.

$33,299.

That was the price of the skirt.

“Brother, this place... this place... We better go to other...”

Xiao Yu was anxious when she saw the rocket-high prices. How could she afford such expensive clothes?

Wang Xian stroked her head and took out a bank card from his pocket. “Today, let’s just finish off the money on the card!”

It was the diamond card from Agricultural Bank of China with more than 5 million.

Wang Xian was not short on money now. When he treated Little Kite the other time, the card that Old Qin gave him had 20 million on it.

With the revenue his First-grade Restaurant was earning, he had difficulties spending his money away.

As Wang Xian spoke, he handed the salesgirl the card, “Bring them the clothes!”

The salesgirl was stupefied with the diamond card Wang Xian handed to her. As an experienced salesperson, she knew the card well.

Forget about how much money was stored inside, it was definitely enough even if it was overdraft consumption.

“Yes, Sir. I’ll be choosing the clothes for them,” said the salesgirl excitedly.

“Brother, did you make a fortune?” Xiao Yu could not help but ask when she saw his generosity.

“Here, ladies. Let’s try on the clothes and see which skirt looks the best,” the salesgirl said to them.

Wang Xian smiled at Xiao Yu. Without answering her question, he beckoned to her to go with the salesgirl.

“Senior Wang Xian, you can get the clothes for Xiao Yu. I don’t need it.” Xiao Mi shook her head.

She knew that Xiao Yu had only her brother to depend on, and their life was tough.

“It’s okay. Go ahead. Thank you for taking care of Xiao Yu for such a long time,” Wang Xian smiled at her and said. “Just go.”

“This...” Xiao Mi hesitated.

“Xiao Yu, drag your best friend along.” Upon seeing Xiao Mi’s look, Wang Xian instructed his sister.

Xiao Mi was a nice and innocent girl, and both of them were on good terms.

Xiao Yu had been staying in Xiao Mi’s house for the entire summer holiday.

He would treat anyone good to Xiao Yu nicely.

The salesgirl called upon another two salesgirls before they began to let Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi try on the clothes.

After she changed into a refined dress, Xiao Yu became more beautiful and gorgeous.

Wang Xian was delighted with the look.

“Sir, look at the clothes your sister is wearing. After school reopens, she can wear them for a very long time.” The salesgirl beamed at Wang Xian.

“Good. I’ll take this. The one on Xiao Mi looks good too. What do you think? If you think they are good, just get them packed for you,” Wang Xian said directly.

“This is not bad too. Pack it for me.”

“Senior Wang Xian, I’ll take this one. The rest are fine. It’s too expensive.”

“Okay, I’ll buy a bag for you when I get one for Xiao Yu later.”

Wang Xian nodded to Xiao Mi.

After paying for their items, the three sets of clothes cost a total of $100,300.

“Let’s go. After these two dresses, we need to get other styles too. Let’s get another two more sets.” Wang Xian smiled and spoke with the bags of clothes in his hand. After shopping in the Prada shop, Wang Xian dragged Xiao Yu out while she was still in bewilderment.

“Brother, why do you have so much money?” Xiao Yu asked in disbelief.

“I own a restaurant now. Hmm, you’ll find out tonight. Today’s mission is to finish off the card.”

Wang Xian flashed his card again and laughed.

“Xiao Yu, your brother is really awesome now!” Xiao Mi exclaimed in bewilderment.

“Let’s go. This one, Louis Vuitton.”

Wang Xian headed to the shop in front of him. Louis Vuitton, the world’s biggest luxury brand, also known as the often-said LV.

Wang Xian was a traditional man. Once he was rich, he wanted to get the best things for his sister.

“Welcome!” The salesgirl immediately greeted them with a smile as soon as she saw them strolling in.

Wang Xian observed the shop. Women’s clothes, bags... Just nice, he would get them all.

“Pick two sets of clothes for her,” Wang Xian told the salesgirl and turned to Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi. “Take a look and choose your favorite bag.”

Soon, they got two sets of clothes and two bags with more than $140,000 spent on the card.

After they came out of the shop, Xiao Yu recovered slightly from the shock and asked Wang Xian with a smiling face, “Brother, how much money does your card have? Do you intend to make me into a little princess?”

“You’ll know it after you’re done. Let’s go. We have clothes and bags now. Girls must have shoes. Oh, and some accessories and cosmetics even though you’re a natural beauty.”

Wang Xian smiled at Xiao Yu. “Let’s go, little Princess. Off to Level 4!”

“Charge! My brother has become a rich man. I’m a rich man’s sister!”

Xiao Yu was thrilled as she regained the sweet and adorable side of her. She skipped her way up to level four for more shopping.
