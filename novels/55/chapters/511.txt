Chapter 512: I’m Annihilating The Devils (3)

All of a sudden, all the tourists in the bar ran out in a hurry, including those few martial artists.

These martial artists were at most Level 5 or 6. Some were even weaker. Mo Yuan’s scream made them sense horrifying risks.

Long Qi waved his arm and the employees instantly lost their consciousness and fell to the ground.

“I had not expected to meet such a powerful Inborn expert in this place.”

The old hag who managed to stay alive by shedding her skin revealed her ugly true self. She wiped away the blood on her mouth and stared intensely at Wang Xian with killing intent.

The other two young men also walked over and stared coldly at Wang Xian. “Who are you? Why are you offending our Remains?”

“I finally understand why there are so many sects in the Underworld who wish to annihilate all of you. There are many scheming people within the orthodox sects but you guys truly deserve death!”

Wang Xian glanced harshly across the three of them.

Today, Wang Xian finally witnessed the true side of Diabolism.

They were truly unscrupulous in killing the innocent by brutal means.

The bloody cultivation arts had distorted their souls.

People like them shouldn’t exist in this world.

“You will die quickly if you stick your nose into things you shouldn’t!” The old hag let out a wretched cry and a bell appeared in her hands suddenly.

Ding ding

A sound came from the bell. As for the other two young men, they held identical bells in their hands too.

The magical sound made it out of the bar.

Swish swish swish!

At this moment, three figures appeared in the bar.

Two girls and a guy. The two girls were incomparably beautiful while the guy was exceptionally stunning.

Their eyes were empty and they had a faint stench of blood lingering around them.

There was a black patch in their palms that glowed in a creepy dull light. Their fingers were long and extremely sharp.

“Brat, I’m going to skin you and dismantle your bones!” The old hag’s expression was contorted and she stared hideously at him.

“You truly deserve death for spoiling our mood!”

The other two young men shook their bells gently and the two beautiful girls moved before them in rigid movements.

“He’s an Inborn expert. I can’t give all of his bones to you!” the young man looked at the old hag and said plainly.

“He damaged one of my skins. I’m getting his skin and you can have his bones. Kill him!” the old hag shrieked and shook the bell in her hands.

Ding ding,

Ding ding,

The young man also shook his bell. Three stiff figures instantly attacked Wang Xian.

Their razor-sharp claws gave off terrifying auras.

“Ashes to ashes, dust to dust!”

Seeing their faces, they were all in their twenties. Yet, they had been killed by these devils!

Wang Xian waved his arm and intense flames shrouded on the bone puppets.

Argh!

Wretched screams came from them.

The bone puppets had a little spirituality after they were refined.

“What?”

The two young men and the old hag were shocked to see the bone puppets they had refined turning to ashes rapidly.

“Who are you? How can you be so powerful?”

Fear gleamed in the eyes of the three of them.

Three Inborn-level bone puppets were reduced to ashes directly. This... How can this be possible!

“Run!”

The three of them ran out without any hesitation.

Wang Xian was emotionless as he waved his arm. Three balls of flames flew towards the trio and surrounded them completely.

“What? How can this be possible?”

“Bring me to the base of the Remains!” Wang Xian stared at them and demanded coldly. He wasn’t paying attention to their screams.

“YOU... Who are you?”

The three of them looked fearfully at the flames around them and couldn’t help but shiver.

“Me? Don’t you know me? It doesn’t matter. Hehe! If you don’t wish to die, bring me to the base of the Remains!” remarked Wang Xian plainly with a faint smile.

“You want to go into the base of our Remains?” a young man stared at Wang Xian and asked bitterly.

“That’s right!” Wang Xian chuckled. “Bring me there and you guys might still have a chance to survive. Otherwise, I’ll reduce all of you to ashes immediately.”

“Alright. Since you are courting death, I’ll bring you there!” the old hag growled at Wang Xian with a hideous expression.

“Take the lead!” Wang Xian instructed them emotionlessly. Behind him, Mo Yuan immediately called to all the dragonians.

“Sss. Those three are from the Remains?”

“They are from the Remains. Those that charged in previously are the bone puppets they made and those who can make such bone puppets are, without a doubt, Inborn experts!”

“They are now controlled by that overly young man...”

“He’s the Dragon King. I’ve seen him once before. That young man is the Dragon King from the Dragon Sect!”

Wang Xian used flames to control them as they walked out of the bar.

When the martial artists that had chosen to stay witnessed this, their eyes widened and were filled with horror.

Over the last few days, the disciples of the Remains had been appearing in Ling City. Some martial artists had left in fear but some had stayed because they were wanted by other governments or forces.

Now that they saw the three Inborn experts from the Remains under the control of the Dragon King, they were astonished.

“What is the Dragon King going to do?” a martial artist asked curiously. The two martial artists around him were mumbling to themselves in shock. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“I don’t know. Dragon Sect has not joined the alliance of the orthodox sects and isn’t willing to annihilate Diabolism. Currently, they are labelled as an evil sect by Dong Hua Sacred Sect!”

“All the sects in the Underworld have expressed their willingness to join the alliance of the orthodox sects in preparation for the annihilation of Diabolism. Only the Dragon Sect hasn’t joined. All the martial artists are looking down on the Dragon Sect with contempt!”

The three of them conversed. One of them took out the phone and entered the Underworld website.

[All the experts of the Underworld have joined the alliance of the orthodox sects to eradicate Diabolism.]

[The Dragon King of the Dragon Sect is exceptionally arrogant and isn’t willing to join the alliance of the orthodox sects.]

[Shocking! The Dragon King of the Dragon Sect defeated the Lord of Sea Serpent Island and became the second strongest expert in today’s Underworld!]

[The Dragon King from Dragon Sect is simply too arrogant. He severely injured the Lord of Sea Serpent Island and declared he won’t rest until either the Dragon Sect or Dong Hua Sacred Sect has perished. He’s not willing to join the alliance of the orthodox sects and acted just like a devil sect!]

[Not only is the Dragon Sect unwilling to join the alliance of the orthodox sects, but they also are making Dong Hua Sacred Sect their enemy. A trash sect like this is no different from Diabolism!]

[I’m suggesting eradicating the Dragon Sect after eliminating Diabolism. He’s simply too arrogant!]

Annihilating Diabolism was the trend of the entire Underworld and what all martial artists hoped to see.

Now that Dragon Sect had become the only Sacred Sect who was unwilling to join the alliance of the orthodox sects, all the martial artists in the Underworld weren’t happy with them.

Besides that, he announced he wouldn’t rest until either the Dragon Sect or Dong Hua Sacred Sect had perished at this critical juncture. Not only was he unwilling to help, but he also hindered the progress. This infuriated all the other martial artists.

Although the Sacred Sects were wary of the strength of the Dragon Sect and didn’t make a statement, their disciples could post critiques of them on the Underworld website without reserve.

All of a sudden, the Dragon Sect was seen as the equivalent of Diabolism.

Tsk!

When Wang Xian walked out of the bar and heard the comments around him, his face turned as cold as ice.

I have no need to explain my actions to you guys!

If I’m not happy with Diabolism, I’ll cut them down. If the orthodox sects offend me, I’ll also kill!

Public opinions from the Underworld aren’t going to change my mind!
