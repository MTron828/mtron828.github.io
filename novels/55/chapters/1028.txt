Chapter 1029: 1,030 city Lord’s mansion

Translator: 5496903

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that with one billion mid-grade spirit stones and a 20% discount, they would still be able to earn at least 200 million mid-grade spirit stones.

A transcendent seventh grade medicinal pill was only worth around 10 million mid-grade spirit stones.

With 200 million mid-grade spirit stones, their Feng Xian’s profits in East Sea city wouldn’t even reach 200 million in a year.

Even the eyes of the four middle-aged men from the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan flickered, and their eyes were filled with deep regret.

If these spirit stones belonged to Feng Xian, then he, as a customer, would be able to support the entire Feng Xian. What promotion would he have to do? What auction would he have to hold.

Moreover, they knew that this young man in front of them had already spent 500-600 million in a short one to two months.

Would he continue to buy medicinal pills in the future? From the looks of it, the possibility was very high.

Just like that, a customer was directly chased away by their Phoenix Immortal.

What the F * ck!

Supervisor Yi, the shopkeeper, as well as the four middle-aged and four young men were all breathing rapidly.

The middle-aged man looked at his disciple and fiercely glared at him.

At this moment, the young man was also completely dispirited. He lowered his head and didn’t dare to speak at all.

This time, one of his actions caused a huge loss to the Phoenix Immortal.

Two hundred million mid-grade spirit stones in exchange for resources would be enough to increase their fire cloud sparrow clan’s strength by five to six extraordinary seventh rank experts.

However, at the same time, he was somewhat furious.

Once this matter was revealed, his master and the others would definitely have a lot of opinions towards him!

“It’s all that Kid’s fault, that damned fellow!”

The young man’s eyes flickered with hatred.

“Hehehe!”

At this time, on the side of the pill of life and death shopkeeper woman saw the change in charge of a group of people look embarrassed, eyes turned, full of ridicule laughed.

“Aiya, it’s really funny. The mighty Feng Xian actually chased out the distinguished guests in his own shop. It’s really interesting. After staying here for so long, this is the first time I’ve seen a guest push his own guests out, and it’s such a distinguished guest!”

The woman started to mock him.

Firstly, she was trying to please Wang Xian on purpose to leave a good impression on him.

Secondly, both parties were in a competitive relationship. Naturally, she didn’t plan to let go of this good opportunity.

The woman’s face was flushed red. She glanced at supervisor Yi and the rest with a smug look on her face. Then, she pulled Wang Xian’s arm and said, “Young Master Wang, please come in. We promise to give you the best service!”

Wang Xian and the woman walked towards the life and Death Elixir store.

Chief Yi and the rest looked extremely embarrassed.

“Sigh!”

Chief Yi and the shopkeeper could not help but sigh heavily and walked straight into the store.

For the first time, they ignored the few higher-ups and walked towards Feng Xian.

The expressions of the four middle-aged men changed. They also walked towards the store with sullen faces.

The three girls and a young man followed behind obediently. They didn’t dare to breathe too loudly.

Wang Xian entered the life and Death Elixir Workshop. The Lady Manager brought him into the reception hall at the back with a warm expression.

She served him tea and poured him water. Her body was almost resting on Wang Xian’s body.

Perhaps it was because she saw that he was handsome and had spirit stones.

Wang Xian maintained a distance from her in an awkward but polite manner. The Lady Manager sat at the side and chatted with him with a smile.

Half an hour later, all the elixirs were brought over.

The Life and Death Elixir store offered Wang Xian a 20% discount.

Wang Xian asked if there were any spiritual herbs. In the end, under the shocked gaze of the lady manager, Wang Xian bought all kinds of spiritual herbs.

Wang Xian was in a great mood after being enthusiastically sent out of the store.

The elixirs in his hands, which were worth one billion middle-grade spiritual stones, could raise three strange demons to extraordinary seventh level.

Or it could only raise ao demons to extraordinary seventh level.

If the evil demons were to be raised to extraordinary seventh level, they should be able to match a half-step void interpretation stage powerhouse.

However, Wang Xian still decided to let the three evil demons be raised to extraordinary seventh level.

This was because if the three evil demons were to reach extraordinary seventh level, he would have four subordinates at extraordinary ninth level.

The strength of an individual was strong. Sometimes, it was inferior to the strength of a team.

Take Wang Xian for example. If he were to spend all his resources on himself, he would at most be at transcendent-level rank-7.

What could he do at transcendent-level Rank-7? He could kill a half-step void interpretation, but there was still a huge gap between him and a real void interpretation.

With such strength, how could he earn spirit stones quickly? He could only rely on hunting ferocious beasts.

However, hunting ferocious beasts was not as rewarding as assassinating the dragon spike. The amount of spirit stones he earned was much faster.

If he had only spent the resources on himself to increase his strength when he first entered the extraordinary mainland, he would never have been able to obtain so many spirit stones.

Furthermore, the Dragon Palace was his final strength.

The reason why the bug race was so powerful back then was because of their huge numbers.

Ao Yao and the rest had the same strength as Wang Xian himself. Therefore, Wang Xian would not care even if they were stronger than him.

“Bang!”

“What are you doing? What are you doing?”

Not long after Wang Xian walked out of the life and Death Elixir Workshop, an old man suddenly collapsed on the ground and shouted at the young man beside him.

His eyes were filled with fear.

This street was located on the main street and there were many people around. When they saw the conflict, everyone immediately looked over.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian felt something. He looked at the old man on the ground and his face slowly darkened.

“City guards enforcing the law!”

The young man dressed in green immediately took out a law enforcement token.

“Take him away. A small dragon assassin organization dares to be so arrogant in our Donghai City!”

At this moment, the city guards who were hiding in the surroundings quickly surrounded them and shouted loudly.

“What? The Dragon Assassin Organization?”

“What’s going on? Could that old man be an assassin of the Dragon Assassin Organization?”

“No way! He clearly doesn’t have any power. could he be a spy of the assassin organization? !”

“It should be. I didn’t expect the city lord to actually make a move against the dragon assassin organization. This is a big matter!”

“The city Lord actually wants to deal with the dragon assassin organization. It should be because the dragon assassin organization assassinated the mayor of Bridgewood town back then. This has caused the city lord and star-moon kingdom to be very dissatisfied, which is why they made a move against the Dragon Assassin Organization!”

“This time, the dragon assassin organization will be in big trouble. If the city Lord’s estate makes a move, and the insightful void realm experts make a move, they might even uproot the dragon assassin organization!”

When the surrounding people heard the city guards’words, shock appeared on their faces.

When they saw the city guards surrounding the old man, they all muttered to themselves.

“Haha, it’s simply wishful thinking to want to deal with our Dragon Assassin Organization!”

When the old man heard the city guard’s words, a look of despair appeared on his face. However, soon after, he laughed wildly and shouted loudly.

“Is that so? It Won’t be long before your dragon assassin organization will be uprooted by us. Humph, Arrogant Fellow, you dare to be so arrogant in our eastern sea city!”

A city guard in the middle coldly shouted.

“Is that so?”

“Peng!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

That old man stared at the city guard in the middle, and a trace of ridicule appeared on his face.

His body emitted a loud bang!
