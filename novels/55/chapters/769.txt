Chapter 770: 0771 invitation letter from the Xuan Yuan clan

Translator: 549690339

“My Lord, we shall take our leave!”

The group of Thunder clan disciples cupped their fists at Wang Xian. With an embarrassed expression, they carried the young clan leader of the Thunder clan and left into the distance.

When they saw this scene, everyone around them sighed.

“My lord, I’m sorry. I was rude just now. Please forgive me if I have offended you!”

At this moment, Cheng Qingcheng, who was watching the scene from the side, turned slightly pale. She quickly apologized to Wang Xian.

“We are here to catch Earthstar fish. Everyone, don’t come and disturb us. Otherwise, the one just now will be your end!”

Wang Xian ignored Cheng Qingcheng. He scanned the surroundings and warned her faintly.

“Yes, yes. We... We will definitely not disturb you!”

“We will leave this place now!”

Everyone around nodded their heads respectfully.

Wang Xian nodded his head slowly.

The surrounding disciples of the celestial sect left immediately.

“Dragon King, we will take our leave too!”

Flower Fairy, Piao linxue, and the rest hesitated for a moment before taking their leave.

“Please pass these spirit weapons and elixirs to master Yu. Tell him that we didn’t have the time to take our leave last time!”

Wang Xian moved his arm and passed five level-12 spirit tools and ten level-7 elixirs to Piao linxue.

“Alright, we promise to deliver them!”

Piao linxue nodded and left with the spirit tools and elixirs.

Hong Tianda, Yin Fengwen and the rest also bowed and followed closely behind.

“Alright, no one will disturb us now!”

Wang Xian said to Tang Yinxuan with a smile on his face.

“Then the world will be ours next!”

Tang Yinxuan walked to the side excitedly and said to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian nodded and said, “Let’s continue!”

“What? Yinxuan can use a special method to attract earthstar fish?”

Shu Qing asked curiously.

Wang Xian nodded and said, “Yes, I plan to use this method to capture the fish for a few days. What is the Phoenix looking for down there?”

“I didn’t find anything. The bottom is connected to the underground sea. It’s bottomless. I flew at the fastest speed for more than ten minutes but I still couldn’t see the bottom. Furthermore, the interior is extremely vast and dark. It’s like an Abyss!”

Guan Shuqing said, “Sister Feng Luan wants to find the way back to her world. She said that the spiritual energy here is too thin!”

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and looked pensive.

In the next few days, Wang Xian, Guan Shuqing, and Tang Yinxuan had been catching earthstar fish in the mysterious sea.

As for the matter of someone using a special method to attract earthstar fish, it became a hot topic in the area of Ji Ding and the other cauldrons.

Especially in the area of Ji Ding, everyone knew that there was a young immortal who brought along the wife of at least a middle-level immortal, as well as a beautiful lady and her subordinates to catch Earthstar fish in the mysterious sea using a special method.

In fact, the young clan leader of the Thunder clan had offended the immortal God back then and had his limbs chopped off by his subordinates. Cheng Qingcheng had apologized to him in person.

This matter involved the immortal God, the young clan leader of the Thunder clan, and the number one beauty, Cheng Qingcheng. It immediately caused a huge sensation on Ji Ding.

In the end, the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate, who was once the overlord of the Jianghu and was now a terrifying existence at the immortal God level, was dug out by someone.

The result shocked all the immortal sects.

At present, twenty immortal sects were standing in the jianghu, and the twenty immortal sects occupied a territory. Now, a force that was comparable to the immortal sects suddenly appeared, instantly attracting the attention of all the immortal sects.

The Dragon King of the Dragon Gate truly entered the sight of all the forces.

And all the disciples of the immortal sects also knew that besides the immortal sects of the eight cauldrons world, there was also a terrifying dragon gate hidden in the jianghu.

A powerful force with at least one middle-level immortal could be ranked in the top ten in terms of overall strength.

After Wang Xian received this news, he didn’t pay too much attention to it.

Now, those who knew about the existence of the Dragon Gate, such as the puppet immortal sect of Shun Ding, the Ming Wang Immortal sect, the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect of yellow ding, the upper nine immortal sects and the Chaos Immortal sect, knew about the existence of the Dragon Gate.

Tang Ding’s innate immortal sect, True Martial Immortal Academy, and Ice God immortal sect, Yao Ding’s Holy Doctor Immortal Sect, and Holy Medicine Immortal sect also knew about the existence of Dragon King of Dragon Gate.

In addition to Ji Ding’s immortal sects!

Seventy percent of the immortal sects knew about the existence of Dragon King of Dragon Gate.

The news of the mysterious sea only spread the existence of Dragon King of Dragon Gate throughout the entire jianghu. All the disciples of immortal sects knew about the existence of such a powerful force in jianghu.

“It’s getting fewer and fewer. We only caught about seventy fish today!”

Seven days later, Tang Yinxuan looked at the day’s harvest and said with slight dissatisfaction.

More than seventy fish. This would definitely make the immortal sects drool if word got out. However, to Wang Xian and the rest, the harvest today was a little less.

A few days ago, they caught more than two hundred terrestrial star fish in one day at most. In the first six days, they caught a thousand terrestrial star fish.

On the seventh day, the number of terrestrial star fish began to decrease drastically.

Although the mysterious sea was huge, the number of terrestrial star fish was not many. After catching them for seven days, the number of terrestrial star fish was decreasing at a rapid rate.

Perhaps in a few days, their harvest would be even less.

“The harvest is already considered pretty good!”

Wang Xian smiled. If the harvest in these seven days were to turn into dragon energy, it could reach 70 to 80 million.

However, compared to the Earth Star Fish, Wang Xian was more inclined to change the earth star fish into a grade-6 medicinal pill.

Consuming a grade-6 medicinal pill could increase his dragon energy by around 110,000. If he were to change it into a grade-6 medicinal pill, he would be able to increase his dragon energy by more than 100 million.

Wang Xian was prepared to change all of the Earth star fish into medicinal pills before consuming them!

Whoosh! Whoosh

Just as he was about to return, two figures suddenly flew over at a terrifying speed.

The figures were flying on their swords. They were wearing yellow clothes and the word “Xuanyuan”was written on their chests.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian looked over and saw two middle-aged men flying towards them.

“Dragon King of the Dragon Gate, nice to meet you. The two of us are from the Xuanyuan clan!”

The two middle-aged men came in front of Wang Xian and put away their spiritual swords. They cupped their hands towards Wang Xian with smiles on their faces.

“Xuan Yuan Clan?”

“May I know why you are here?”

Wang Xian asked them with a puzzled expression. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The two middle-aged men were extremely powerful. One of them was a lower-level immortal while the other should be a middle-level immortal.

“We are inviting the dragon sect to participate in the celestial sect’s disciple competition in two days’time. You didn’t participate in the Celestial Sect’s agreement last time. This time, our Xuan Yuan clan would like to invite you to participate in this grand event!”

A middle-aged man smiled and handed an invitation card to Wang Xian.

“Celestial Sect’s disciple competition?”

Wang Xian took the invitation card and revealed a curious expression.

“Yes, all the celestial sects will take out some items to support this celestial sect’s disciple competition. Dragon sect has the strength of the celestial sect, so our Xuan Yuan clan sincerely invites you, Dragon King!”

The middle-aged man said politely to him.

“Alright, I will attend on Time!”

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment before nodding his head!
