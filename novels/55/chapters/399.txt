Chapter 400: Overseas Wandering Sea Groups (1)

“Oh gosh! It’s so beautiful here!”

After parking the yacht beside the island and paying exorbitant fees, Xiao Yu, Guan Shuqing and the girls alighted from the yacht and looked around the island with anticipation.

The entire island was divided into separate regions. Within it, clean and clear seawater was flowing and the entire island had been modified to include a swimming pool.

Moreover, there were restaurants, cafes, and bars surrounding the pool.

With a huge shade cast on the island, the entire area was exceptionally stunning and the place was ideal for swimming and relaxing.

“The island is a place for relaxing. If you are interested in other entertainment, you can board the various cruises around. There are a total of five cruises providing various services!” the employee at the yacht docking area explained to Wang Xian with a radiant smile.

“Alright, thank you!” Wang Xian nodded his head. He looked around him and revealed a smile.

“It’s so beautiful. The water on this island is a hot spring from the sea. This is simply amazing. Xiao Xian, look! There are cruises for accommodation, food, water treatment, and even gambling.”

Guan Shuqing looked around her and was ecstatic.

Other than that, there was a beautiful beach where they could even go fishing.

There was also a cruise used specifically to receive martial artists. The entire premise could be said to be the holy land of tourism and wasn’t a place that could be matched by other tourist spots in the world.

Similarly, the cost here wasn’t affordable by ordinary consumers.

“Go, go! Let’s go to the food cruise first before returning for the hot spring, drinking some coffee and lying down for some rest. Haha! This is too great!” Xiao Yu held onto Wang Xian’s arms as she remarked joyously.

“Alright, alright!” Wang Xian smiled and nodded his head. The group of six headed towards one of the cruises.

On the food cruise, there were various delicacies from all over the world. One could even find spiritual fish for sale on the top deck.

Xiao Yu and the girls had a sumptuous meal of delicacies. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After eating, the group of them went for the hot spring. They rented a hot spring pool where they could order all kinds of coffee and beverages from the side while immersing themselves and resting in the hot spring.

The day passed quickly as the group rested and relaxed.

At night, there was a bonfire party by the beach. There were unique delicacies and beautiful ladies from all over the world, making the entire beach a place of sin.

However, the order of the entire region was still great. No one was kicking up a fuss and no one dared to do so.

For this place to become such a lively and popular tourist spot, safety and order had to be a hundred percent guaranteed.

At night, at the top level of the accommodation cruise, Wang Xian, Xiao Yu, Guan Shuqing and the other girls were sitting by the balcony. They were playing bridge while enjoying the beautiful scenery before them.

The island, from a long distance away, was well lit and looked exceptionally beautiful.

Touring here had lifted the spirits of everyone.

“Let’s enjoy ourselves for a week here. We can return after the week since we aren’t in a hurry, too!” Wang Xian looked at Xiao Yu and the girls as he commented with a smile.

“My master is still asking me to return as soon as possible!” Guan Shuqing stuck out her tongue playfully as she commented.

“It’s alright. I’ll inform him. I’ll raise your strength to the Inborn Realm over these few days. In this case, Sui Huang won’t nag at you,” Wang Xian chuckled.

He realized something. When the two of them had intercourse, he could increase Guan Shuqing’s strength level.

It might be because of the relationship between the dragon and the phoenix. [1]

“Wandering Sea Groups! Get out of the territory of our Qing Bi Sect!”

At this moment, a chilling roar erupted from the sea and propagated throughout the region.

“Hehehehe! We have come to the Qing Bi Sect’s territory. Pay us a hundred spiritual stones now and we will leave immediately. Otherwise, don’t blame us for going on a killing spree!”

A brazen voice propagated through the night sky.

“Scram, you guys are just a group of locusts! Otherwise, all of you shall die!”

“Haha! You want all of us in the Century Ghost Group to die? Your Qing Bi Sect doesn’t have such capabilities yet. Now, we shall grant you a minute to think about it. Give us the spiritual stones or we will start a slaughter here!”

The brazen voice erupted once again and resounded in the sky.

Wang Xian stood up in shock and looked ahead.

At this moment, all the rooms on the cruise lit up after hearing the brazen voice. Many people walked out of their rooms, feeling puzzled.

Amid the dark seas, a ship that was roughly seventy meters long stopped before the island.

The ship had a green glow and was entirely green.

It was extremely creepy and similar to ships used a long time ago. It was made of wood but it looked incomparably tough.

On that ship, the crew members were all carrying samurai swords. They wore green ghost masks and looked exceptionally savage.

“A strange ship!”

Wang Xian was a little surprised by that green wooden ship and recalled the ship of the Sacred Seas of Swords.

The ship of the Sacred Seas of Swords was made from a special metal. When he stood on the ship, he could feel that the ship was extremely tough.

However, Wang Xian wasn’t paying too much attention to it when he sank it.

Could there be mysterious pirate ships like those in the movies?

Wang Xian smiled. Subsequently, he looked down at the ship.

“Those are the Wandering Sea Groups. Moreover, they are Wandering Sea Groups from Japan! Scumbags!”

“Century Ghost Group is a rather strong and infamous Wandering Group. They possess incredible strength. Once, they annihilated two weak First-class forces in the vicinity and plundered all the treasures. They must have their eyes set on Qing Bi Sect now!”

“Rumor has it that the ship of the Century Ghost Group can dive ten meters under the surface and cruise rapidly! How insane is that!?”

“The Century Ghost Group is formed by some martial artists from Japan. These scumbags are just like locusts in this piece of sea region. They go around plundering and surprisingly have infiltrated this place today!”

At this moment, voices of martial artists started coming from various directions. Many people had gathered on the deck and were looking down.

Clearly, many martial artists knew the Century Ghost Group well and hated them.

Wandering Sea Group? Century Ghost Group?

Wang Xian heard them and raised an eyebrow.

He had not expected to encounter the Century Ghost Group after receiving information about the Wandering Sea Groups earlier in the day.

There were many Wandering Sea Groups on the sea from all parts of the world. In this piece of sea region, the strongest Wandering Sea Groups included Century Ghost Group, Hai Jiao, Naka, Night Phantom, and Creepy Snake.

These few Wandering Sea Group were infamous and had annihilated First-class forces previously.

Hai Jiao and Naka were formed by criminals in the Underworld and Century Ghost Group was from Japan, while Naka and Creepy Snake had been established by martial artists from India and Sarawak.
