2549 On planet 25

“Dragon King, I have already prepared the plan to build a commercial planet!”

Half a month later, Tian Zhen came to the Dragon Palace with a smile on his face and spoke to Wang Xian respectfully!

“Oh? Are You Ready?”

Wang Xian immediately stood up and walked over with a face full of respect!

“Dragon King, please take a look!”

Tian Zhen waved his arm and a planet appeared in front of him!

“Dragon King, this is the commercial planet we are going to build. I can use the array to cover this planet, maintaining the consumption of the array requires a large amount of god Stones!”

“In order to prevent the consumption of God stones, I will sacrifice 9 life planets to maintain this commercial planet. 9 lives as energy, encircling the 9 planets, setting up the sky locking array!”

“The heaven-locking formation. With my current strength, I can seal 20 Immortal King Level 7. As long as the heaven-locking formation is activated, all immortal King Level 7 will be sealed inside!”

“Other than that, in order to prevent experts from coming to cause trouble and kill, I can set up the heaven-locking formation to be activated once the life force in a certain area disappears!”

The heaven-locking formation spoke confidently to Wang Xian!

As a former celestial thearch, he was very thorough when it came to safety. There were all kinds of formations one after another!

Apart from the sealing formation, there were also attack formations, illusion formations, trapping formations, and more!

This kind of formation was different from the ones used in battle. The formation needed to be maintained with divine stones. Once the divine stones were activated, it would consume a lot of energy!

However its power and coverage were both terrifying!

“Dragon King, I can guarantee your safety, unless an undying level 8 warrior destroys it, there won’t be any problems!”

“Other than safety, I’ve created an array on the commercial planet that can attract countless people, the training array!”

“Within the training array, through the consumption of God stones, it can unleash energy comparable to an undying level 6 or 7 god country, and I’ll split it into 9 attributes!”

“In other words, cultivating in the cultivation formation, even an immortal king’s cultivation speed will be faster than cultivating in his own divine kingdom!”

“Of course, this cultivation requires a large amount of divine stones. Entering the cultivation field, they will need to pay a certain amount of divine stones. We can also cut off half of the divine stones used for consumption!”

As Heaven’s formation spoke, a smile appeared on its face!

“Training Formation!”

Wang Xian was slightly moved. “In other words, as long as an eternal God has enough divine stones, he can enjoy the rich energy training environment in the sixth or seventh level immortal God Realms?”

“Yes, Dragon King. However, this requires a lot of divine stones. However, this training ground is a fatal threat to many people!”

Heaven’s formation said with a smile!

“Indeed. How many people can the training ground support?”

Wang Xian asked!

“10 million people!”

Heaven’s formation replied!

“10 million people. If you pay a certain amount of divine stones to enter, this is a terrifying amount of resources. Also, they have to take out their own divine stones to cultivate. If you take half of them, it will be another terrifying amount of income!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were burning. If the cultivation room was full, wouldn’t the amount of divine stones in a day be counted as one billion?

The value of a level one immortal king level battle pet was equivalent to one billion divine stones!

One billion divine stones to buy medicinal pills could produce ten immortal kings in the Dragon Palace!

“Hiss!”

Wang Xian sucked in a breath of cold air. This was more profitable than capturing a battle pet!

“Of course, Dragon King, there is a flaw. I need to be there to maintain it!”

At this moment, the celestial thearch of Heaven Formation added on!

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly. Although the income was terrifying, it required the maintenance of a terrifying formation master like the Celestial Thearch of Heaven Formation!

The cultivation formation set up by the Celestial Thearch of Heaven Formation could only be set up by the celestial thearch of the formation sorcery association in the entire starry sky!

This was equivalent to a celestial thearch sitting there and making money with the cultivation formation!

“Dragon King, the cultivation formation is a very important place. Next is the commercial center...”

The Heaven Formation waved the simulated planet in front of him. Wang Xian nodded his head in satisfaction!

After discussing for half an hour, Wang Xian was impeccable with the Heaven Formation’s plan!

“First, we need ten life planets. Nine of them must be uninhabited and used for sacrificial purposes!”

“These ten planets should be easy to prepare in the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation!”

Wang Xian mumbled and immediately sent a message to the imperial preceptor of Heaven Demon Nation!

The construction of commercial planets had begun!

The chaotic Tiger Demon Nation quickly agreed. Ten life planets were still very easy for them!

This time, the attack on the beheading demon sect had occupied hundreds of life planets!

“Next, I need to confirm the location of the Commercial Planet!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Wang Xian opened his AI and looked at the star map of the southern star system!

“Since that’s the case, let’s do it here!”

Soon, Wang Xian confirmed the location of the commercial planet. It was located not far from Xing Hua Planet!

...

This location was not far from the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation!

Moreover, the rise of this commercial planet meant that there would definitely be other commercial planets in decline!

Now, Wang Xian would find the easiest person to bully first!

“Once they dare to cause trouble, I’ll give them a surprise!”

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly!

Wang Xian was even certain that Xing Hua planet would definitely come to cause trouble. When that time came, he would have a good reason to do so!

“Sky Array, let’s make a trip to the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom First!”

As Wang Xian spoke to the sky array, he immediately rushed towards the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom!

“After the planet is confirmed, the first thing to do is to build a dragon palace there. It will save a lot of time!”

Wang Xian mumbled to himself!

After traveling for more than ten hours to arrive at the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom, Wang Xian flew straight towards the Demon God Palace!

...

“Leader of the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom, how are the preparations for the Planet?”

Wang Xian entered the main hall and asked with a smile!

“Dragon King, everything is ready. The experts of our demon nation are moving the planet. They will arrive soon!”

The leader of the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation went up to him and asked, “Dragon King, are you confident?”

“I won’t do anything that I’m not confident about. Place the commercial planet not far from Xing Hua Planet!”

Wang Xian said to him confidently!

“Sure!”

Chaotic Tiger Nation’s leader nodded his head!

With the current strength of the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation, apart from the four factions, he was not afraid of anything else!

With an immortal King Level 7 powerhouse guarding the place, no one dared to provoke them!

“Leader, the planet has been moved to the space not far away!”

Not long after, a soldier came in to report!

“Alright, Dragon King, we’ll be counting on you guys!”

The monarch of chaotic tiger nation nodded his head and looked at Wang Xian!

“Leave the rest to us!”

Wang Xian smiled. His body moved and he immediately flew into the void!

After flying for more than an hour, they saw nine planets floating in the starry sky!

“Heaven Array, let’s begin your performance!”

Wang Xian looked at the sky array and said to him with a smile!

“Don’t worry, Dragon King. Leave the rest to me!”

The sky array nodded heavily and flew directly toward the ten planets!

Wang Xian also entered the ocean of one planet and started to build the Dragon Palace there!
