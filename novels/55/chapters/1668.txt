Chapter 1669: In the Panic of Fengtian City in 1669

“What should we do when the disciples of the two major forces gather together?”

“Yeah, what should we do? These killers are not just targeting the people of the two major forces!”

When the people outside the two major forces saw that they had gathered together and were guarded by a half-step wanshou expert, panic appeared on their faces.

“If we knew it would be like this, we wouldn’t have come!”

“It’s all our fault for being too greedy. If the assassins are targeting us, then...”

“We’re close to the positions of the two major factions. We’re gathering around them!”

Some mercenary groups revealed regretful expressions on their faces. One by one, they hurriedly approached the positions near the two major factions.

The sudden appearance of the assassins and the disappearance of three to four thousand insightful emptiness realm experts completely caused them to panic.

These were three to four thousand insightful emptiness realm experts. Just the thought of half of the experts in the entire city disappearing just like that made them feel terrified.

“Weapon Master!”

“Medicine Master!”

In a meeting room in the manor in the center of the city, the elders of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop stood respectfully in front of a mirror and said to the person in the mirror.

“What’s the matter? Why do you need to make such an urgent report?”

The medicine master asked expressionlessly.

“Medicine master, we... a group of mysterious killers entered Fengtian City and assassinated more than two thousand insightful emptiness realm experts of our two major forces in a short period of time!”

“And... and according to our estimation, at least three to four thousand insightful emptiness realm experts were assassinated in Fengtian City!”

The half-step Wanshou clan elder of the life and death pill workshop lowered his head and said with an unsightly expression.

“What?”

The expressionless face of the medicine master in the mirror was moved and revealed an unsightly expression.

“Assassins? What kind of assassins are capable of such an unscrupulous assassination in Fengtian City!”

The medicine master asked with a gloomy face.

Three to four thousand insightful emptiness realm experts had been killed or injured. Even the medicine master’s breathing became slightly hurried when he heard this number.

“I don’t know. We searched the entire Fengtian city, but we didn’t find any clues!”

“Now we’ve even opened the imperial sky array... But...”

The elder of the life and death pill workshop revealed a bitter expression.

“Our pills and spiritual herbs were stolen without a sound, and now we’ve assassinated so many people!”

“Dark World? No, dark world belongs to the assassination organization of the Drakonid Empire. What kind of helper did the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan find?”

The medicine master muttered to himself with a solemn face, his eyes flashing with a cold luster.

“It seems that we have to exterminate the fire cloud sparrow clan as soon as possible. Otherwise, the losses will increase!”

After more than ten seconds of silence, the medicine master’s voice sounded again.

“All of you, maintain the highest level of vigilance!”

After the medicine master finished speaking, the image in the mirror disappeared.

The old man bowed and slowly stood up. A ferocious expression appeared on his face. “I hope that the medicine master and the others can exterminate the fire cloud sparrow clan as soon as possible!”

“Let’s Get Ready. The medicine master and the medicine master should soon give the order to attack!”

The elder of the life and death forging workshop walked over and said.

“HMM, I hope this day will come as soon as possible!”

A hint of viciousness appeared on their faces.

“It will be troublesome if we want to assassinate them next!”

At the highest level of a restaurant, Wang Xian looked down at the position in front of him and raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Since that’s the case, let’s clean up those mercenaries!”

Wang Xian thought to himself.

There were more than ten million people in Fengtian city. It was impossible for all of them to gather in the center.

Since that was the case, he could kill the people outside the center without any restraint.

“Ao Yao, lead the strange demons to clear out the people around. This time, kill anyone below the insightful void realm!”

Wang Xian ordered Ao Yao and the rest expressionlessly.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao nodded and the five hundred strange demons immediately dispersed to the surroundings.

Most of the experts were gathered at the center. How could the people around them withstand the assassination attempts of the strange demons.

Especially those experts below the insightful emptiness realm. They were like mowing grass. They could kill over a hundred of them in a minute.

Time passed slowly. Everyone in Fengtian city was decreasing at a terrifying speed.

As all the corpses were kept into the interspatial ring, the blood and corpses did not appear in the city for a while.

This made many people unaware that a few hundred people would disappear every second.

Although most of them were experts at the extraordinary realm, a few hundred people every second was absolutely terrifying.

If this went on for an hour, hundreds of thousands of people would be assassinated.

Just as Wang Xian had estimated, the entire Fengtian city was like a huge wheat field that was being harvested rapidly.

“Eh? Why does it feel like our Fengtian city is so quiet this morning?”

“That’s right. It’s much quieter than usual, especially around here!”

The night passed very quickly. When the sun rose again, the sunny weather made everyone’s solemn mood ease a little.

However, when they heaved a sigh of relief and were about to eat something, they suddenly felt that the entire city had become much more peaceful.

It was as if there was no sound coming from all directions.

The strange atmosphere shocked everyone in the center!

Everyone looked at each other. Their gazes once again landed in the direction of the outskirts of the city.

“We City Guards will go and take a look!”

A city guard of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop formed a city guard army. A city guard of the seventh rank of the profound void tier hovered in the sky as he spoke to the dozen or so subordinates beside him.

“Yes!”

The dozen or so people nodded.

They did not dare to walk over. Instead, they directly flew in the sky, flying in the direction of the outskirts.

When they flew about 20 kilometers, they all sucked in a breath of cold air. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

There was no one, not a single person!

The entire area was like a dead city, and everything was silent.

“Where are the people around here? There are over ten million people in our Fengtian city. Where are the people here!”

The city guard at the seventh level of the profound void tier trembled, and a frightened expression slowly appeared on his face.

“Captain... Captain, they couldn’t... They couldn’t have all been assassinated, right!”

A middle-aged man gulped and said in horror.

“How is this possible? We have more than ten million people in Fengtian City, and there are at least two to three million people around us... This is impossible!”

An old man shook his head hard. As he spoke, even he himself couldn’t believe it!

If they were still alive, where did they go?

“Go to the other three directions and take a look!”

The city guard captain gritted his teeth and immediately flew to the left.

There was no one, no one!

However, the entire outer area of the city was like a land of death. There was not a single person.

“Gulp, in one night, millions of people were assassinated. This... this...”

After patrolling four directions, a group of more than ten people flew over in a daze.

Their pupils were filled with fear!

Their scalps were numb!
