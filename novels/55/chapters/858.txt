“What?”

“The godly monarch was actually suppressed by that terrifying monster!”

“It’s too terrifying. Whether it’s the godly monarch’s explosive strength or the nine-headed monster’s explosive strength, it’s not something an ordinary high-level immortal can match. They’ve already entered another realm!”

“Just as that monster said, the so-called godly monarch is just a powerful cultivator. What’s more, this time, the godly monarch is going to be destroyed!”

Everyone around looked at the Dragon King who was sitting on the dragon throne with a dignified expression. Their hearts were filled with respect.

There were still dozens of immortals and gods beside the Dragon King. They did not make a move and were watching the battle from above.

Just like what the old man with the turtle shell beside the Dragon King said, they were training their troops. Otherwise, they would not have done such a thing.

Training their troops. They were using the god King’s Northern European divine territory and the Yuwen clan to train their troops!

“Let’s begin. I wonder how the first time you played it,”Tang Yinxuan said with a smile

She glanced at Wang Xian with a smile on her face.

“I also want to see how powerful the effects will be when our dolphin queen leads the Dolphin Clan!”

Wang Xian said to Tang Yinxuan jokingly.

“Just watch. Come, sisters, let’s Mingle!”

Tang Yinxuan let out a soft shout and guqin appeared in front of them one by one. She moved her arm slightly.

A very special sound was transmitted forward. The sound seemed to be filled with a special magic power.

Invisible water vapor covered the entire battlefield.

At this moment, the immortal gods of the Nordic divine territory and the Yuwen clan were engaged in a huge battle with the Dragon Palace.

In a situation where the number of immortal gods was equal, there were no casualties yet.

The Strange Demon, who was hiding in the void, was also looking for an opportunity.

“Buzz, Buzz, Buzz!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

When a special sound was heard, the entire battlefield seemed to be covered by a special energy.

All the members of the Dragon Palace, including the immortal God realm’s instant body, felt their minds clear, and the power in their bodies became even stronger.

The faces of the Immortals and experts of the Nordic divine territory and the Yuwen clan changed. They felt the energy in their bodies slow down, and their bodies became stiff, and their vision became hazy!

“Roar!”

Ao Qitian looked at the superior immortal in front of him and paused for a moment, then the ocean-pacifying needle in his hand directly smashed toward the top of his head.

The leader of the ancient Greek divine territory sensed the great danger and instantly woke up from his trance. He hurriedly dodged.

“Bang!”

However, a terrifying force smashed onto his arm, causing his expression to change drastically.

“Ring, Ring, Ring!”

“Not good, I feel that there is a powerful energy disturbing my mind and body.”

“Ah, ah, ah!”

In an instant, when the interweaving energy covered the battlefield, the screams of a few immortals and gods could be heard.

Ao Jian held the ice-cold longsword in his hand and chopped off the arm of the Yuwen clan’s Supreme Elder.

“What kind of energy is this? It can make their momentum shake and even disturb us!”

The Yuwen clan’s grand elder’s eyes were filled with fear as he stared at Ao Jian with vigilance.

“Whoosh!”

However, Ao Jian did not give him any time. The longsword in his hand attacked him once again.

Streaks of sharp sword rays were traceless and soundless, making the Yuwen clan’s Grand Elder’s face extremely ugly. He could only use the earth attribute to defend himself.

Ao jian against the supreme elder of the Yuwen clan.

Ao shrimp against the leader of the Garden of Eden’s divine domain!

Ao Qitian against the leader of the Ancient Greek divine domain.

As for Ao Yao, he was locked onto the nether god of the Roman divine domain in the void.

The one fighting against the nether god was ao crab. Ao crab was also a highgod, and his eight arms continuously attacked the nether god.

However, the nether god was too fast, and Ao crab couldn’t keep up with his speed.

“Ten Thousand Swords!”

“Lightning!”

Right at this moment, two loud shouts rang out, and the entire battlefield instantly changed dramatically.

One cold metal sword after another, one bolt of lightning after another descended from the sky.

A large-scale attack.

“Roar, Roar, Charge!”

Ao Qitian let out a loud roar, charging straight into the center of the gods.

The demon monkeys followed closely behind, and the fifty-meter long sea-pacifying needle swept out in all directions.

Berserk, berserk, berserk!

“Chaos!”

Tang Yinxuan shouted coldly, and the ten dolphins around them let out strange sounds at the same time.

The sound once again covered the entire battlefield.

“Ahhhhh!”

From below the battlefield, a continuous stream of miserable screams could be heard.

It was a battlefield where the experts of the Nordic god realm and the Yuwen clan had yet to reach the immortal God level, and the members of the Dragon Palace had yet to reach the immortal God level.

The sounds made by Tang Yinxuan and the others had a great impact on the immortal gods, and it was like a demonic sound to those who had yet to reach the immortal God realm.

The moment the chaos was released, many people stood there in a daze.

Between the experts and on the battlefield, a moment of Daze meant death.

Groups of experts were killed. Violent Demon Monkeys, ice-cold longswords, and exploding lightning bolts were harvesting groups of creatures.

Ten Thousand Swords, lightning, and Chaos United in the sky, causing the expressions of the immortals and deities of the Northern European God’s domain and Yuwen clan to turn incomparably ugly.

They all cultivated separately. They were completely different from the demon monkeys, Golden Swordfish, and thunder prawns that cultivated together.

In the Dragon Arena, each battle team’s creatures cultivated together and sparred with each other.

Their combined attacks far surpassed the Nordic domain’s and the Yuwen clan’s.

“Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!”

Miserable cries rang out once more. This time, twenty bodies fell directly to the ground below.

Seven or eight immortal gods were instantly heavily injured.

Strange Demon, who was hidden in the void, attacked!

“Underworld god in the darkness? An underworld god that specializes in assassination? Your reaction is quite fast!”

Ao Yao’s voice rang out. He stared at the underworld god who was covered in black robes and said with a smile.

“Damn it!”

A sinister voice came out of the underworld god’s mouth. His blood-red eyes stared at the strange demon and his arm shook.

However, suddenly, his expression changed and he spat out a mouthful of blood. “It’s poisonous!”

“It’s poisonous! No, no, no!”

The seven or eight immortal gods who had just dodged the Strange Demon’s fatal attack had their expressions change drastically as they cried out in terror.

Poison!

Poison was created by a group of venomous snakes under Baqi’s command. Currently, there were more than ten immortal gods under Baqi’s command.

These venomous snakes did not participate in battle. Instead, they specialized in researching poisons.

The poison smeared on the strange demon’s sharp claws could directly kill a middle-level immortal. Even a high-level immortal had to be careful.

The group of immortal gods that had just avoided their vitals were instantly poisoned to death!

In just a short minute, thirty immortal gods from the Northern European divine territory and the Yuwen clan had died.

“Keke, the feast of slaughter has begun. Godly monarch, look at how all your subordinates have been annihilated. Don’t be anxious. Soon, you will die too!”

The eight-headed celestial race hovered in the void ten thousand meters away like a world-destroying wild snake. Each of them had a huge head and a terrifying tail as they stared at the godly monarch in front of them. Their faces were filled with malevolence and coldness.

The godly monarch’s luxurious clothes were now black and red. He did not have the noble and kingly aura that he had at the beginning.

“I am not resigned. Even if I have to die, I Will Destroy You, you beast!”
