Chapter 1045: Conflict in 10

Translator: 5496903

“You are the little girl, you are the ignorant one. All of you are not good people!”

When the Little Loli heard Zhang Fengying’s words, her small face revealed anger once again as she glared at her.

Meanwhile, the gaze of the youth at the side turned cold as he looked at Zhang Fengying. “Little girl, is she someone you can call? You Don’t know what’s good for you!”

The three girls at the side frowned slightly and did not speak.

In the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan, no one dared to bully their little princess.

Especially after the empress came, the little princess was deeply in the Empress’s heart. Now, even their fire cloud sparrow king could not do anything to the little princess.

Logically speaking, the fire cloud sparrow clan could not leave the clan when they were underage. However, she pestered the empress and brought her here.

The little princess was simple-minded and had not experienced any setbacks.

Some people called their little princess a little girl. In their eyes, it was indeed a little too much.

“Bang!”

Zhang Fengying immediately stood up with a trace of anger on her face.

Zhang Fengying would not mind being called a bad person by a Little Loli. However, for a young man to dare to call her reckless, this was not a matter of age.

It was a blatant provocation.

Zhang Fengying, who was born in the family of the mercenary group, was tainted with the valiant and forthright attitude of the mercenary group.

“Reckless? We were just discussing about the auction and you guys provoked us again and again, saying that we are reckless. Do you guys think that we are easy to bully?”

Zhang Fengying stared at the young man coldly. Her faint aura was directed at them.

“You guys from Fengxian, are you looking for trouble?”

Wang Xian also stood up and stared at the young man coldly.

Wang Xian didn’t have a good impression of this fellow. It was the first time he chased him out of Fengxian, and now he was deliberately looking for trouble.

He didn’t know if he wanted to die!

“I think you guys are the ones looking for trouble. Now, get out of here and don’t Disturb Our Lady’s Meal!”

The young man stared at Wang Xian without showing any signs of weakness. A hint of killing intent could be seen in his eyes.

Now, with the little princess around, they dared to be rude to the little princess. If their master and the rest knew about this, they would definitely not forgive this fellow.

In fact, they might even kill him directly.

Even the kingdom of star-moon kingdom would not be able to afford to offend the Little Princess of the fire Lark clan.

Therefore, he didn’t conceal his provocation towards Wang Xian this time.

“Do you still treat this place as your home? Arrogant Fellow!”

Zhang Fengying pointed at the young man and said with a cold gaze.

“You’re really a D * MN Fellow!”

Wang Xian said coldly to the young man as well.

“Since you’re disturbing our lady’s meal, I’ll throw you out!”

The young man saw the expressions of the two of them. He moved his body and went straight for Wang Xian.

He wanted to use his identity as the Little Princess to teach this fellow a good lesson.

“You dare to make a move in the city!”

Zhang Fengying revealed a shocked expression. This was the first time he had seen such an arrogant fellow. He actually dared to make a move in Donghai city.

If he was caught, he would be locked up for at least one to two years.

The young man’s five fingers formed into claws and his body was covered in a layer of faint red flames.

A pair of wings were on both sides.

“You’re courting death!”

Wang Xian’s expression was also a little ugly. He naturally knew the punishment for fighting in the city. Regardless of whether both parties were in the right or wrong, they would all be severely punished.

Wang Xian’s arm was awe-inspiring. His arm immediately transformed into a dragon claw as he faced the young man’s attack.

Zhang Fengying’s expression was extremely ugly. The interspatial ring on her hand shook and a green light surrounded the surroundings instantly. It enveloped everyone in the surroundings with a formation.

Wang Xian sensed the movement techniques around him. The Aura on his body increased once again and collided heavily with the young man.

“Ah!”

The young man let out a blood-curdling scream. His face was filled with disbelief.

“You... you actually have a bloodline!”

The young man widened his eyes, his body heavily retreating backwards, blood seeping out from the corner of his mouth.

“You actually hit one of our people!”

The Little Loli’s face revealed a trace of anger when she saw that the young man was injured.

The three girls standing at the side also had a slight change in expression, and their bodies trembled.

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

A bird cry sounded, and a pair of wings instantly appeared behind the three of them, their bodies emitting red flames.

“Demonic Beasts!”

Zhang Fengying’s expression changed instantly. She moved her arm and a long sword appeared in her hand. Her eyes revealed a green color.

“You guys are really courting death!”

The young man’s eyes were slightly red and the flames on his body started to rise.

The green array formation around him started to sway slightly. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“These guys actually dare to ignore the rules of Donghai City!”

Zhang Fengying saw that they were about to unleash their full strength and a hint of fear appeared on her face.

Wang Xian also frowned slightly. He looked a little embarrassed.

D * mn it, I bumped into a few lunatics.

“Die!”

Wang Xian shouted softly. An item was thrown out from his interspatial ring.

“Young Lady, be careful!”

The two girls immediately stood in front of the Little Loli.

Buzz

In an instant, the surroundings suddenly turned dark. One couldn’t even see their own fingers. They couldn’t even sense anything around them.

It was Ao Yao who made a move!

The item that Wang Xian threw out earlier was just a pretense. The one who really made a move was ao Yao.

This was the light and darkness of Ao Yao. It could cause the surroundings to fall into the light and darkness.

Even Zhang Fengying fell into the darkness in an instant.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The sound of her falling to the ground could be heard.

“Boom!”

All of a sudden, a wave of heat was transmitted over and directly dispelled the darkness.

Ao Yao’s face revealed a trace of shock, and her figure quickly disappeared.

The Darkness disappeared, and Zhang Fengying regained her sight.

When she looked forward, a look of shock appeared on her face.

In the center, the Little Loli stood there, surrounded by a ball of fire elemental birds.

Her clothes, the hairpin on her head, and the necklace on her neck all emitted a red glow.

A terrifying majesty emanated from these ornaments.

“Void interpretation level protective jewelry!”

Zhang Fengying cried out in surprise, a shocked expression on her face as she stared at the Little Loli in disbelief.

A child had at least three or four void interpretation level protective weapons on her. What kind of background did she have to be so extravagant?

Even the crown prince of star-moon kingdom wouldn’t have so many defensive weapons, right?

Wang Xian frowned slightly as he looked at this Little Loli. His expression didn’t look too good either.

He didn’t want to have a conflict with Feng Xian’s people. Ao Yao’s attack just now had merely knocked them out.

However, when he saw this little loli, he knew that this matter wouldn’t be resolved so easily!

“You... you actually knocked them out. You Are Bad People!”

At this moment, the Little Loli’s face was a little pale. She looked at Wang Xian weakly and said, “Someone will come to save me very soon. You... you...”

This was the first time the Little Loli had encountered such a situation. She had no idea what to do.

After all, she was just a little girl who came out without going through the adult assessment.

“Oh no, the Princess’s defense is activated!”

At this moment, the three women and the middle-aged man who were dealing with the matter, who were only a thousand meters away, had their expressions change drastically and instantly flew over!
