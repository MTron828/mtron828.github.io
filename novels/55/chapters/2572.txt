2573 2573 divine dragon blood to entice

“There are two immortal king level one abyssal seeds, and there’s another one at the peak of the Eternal God Lord on the right!”

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings with his yin-yang five elemental dragon eyes and saw three abyssal seeds flying over!

Their green eyes were staring at the divine dragon blood in front of them, filled with greed and passion!

“We’re getting closer!”

When they were about 100 kilometers away from the Divine Dragon’s blood, Wang Xian started to move!

Buzz

He extended his arm and the abyssal seeds that were flying towards him trembled slightly!

Three abyssal seeds were caught by Wang Xian directly!

Bang

He moved his palm slightly and killed them instantly!

“Not bad, you killed two immortal king level abyssal seeds with ease!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and threw the three corpses into his interspatial ring. His eyes were sparkling!

“If the blood of the divine dragon can attract these abyssal seeds quickly, the Dragon Palace can make use of this to kill them quickly and obtain the corpses of the abyssal seeds!”

Wang Xian mumbled and decided to continue flying deeper into the abyss!

The entire Abyss was extremely vast. Even the emperor of the imperial court did not fully explore the entire abyss!

Moreover, the arrival of the celestial thearch would trigger the celestial thearch-level abyss seed!

After flying for two hours straight, Wang Xian had already stepped into the extremely deep region of the Abyss! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

With his current strength, he would be considered an expert even in this bright starry greater world. After two hours of full-strength flying, he had already reached an extremely far distance!

He could still see quite a number of people not long after he entered, but now, he couldn’t see them at all!

“It’s about time!”

Wang Xian mumbled and immediately set up a concealment formation. His figure was also completely concealed as he placed the Divine Dragon’s blood aside!

Following that, he started to wait slowly!

“Squeak, Squeak, Squeak!”

Time passed by little by little. Wang Xian could vaguely hear a series of ear-piercing sounds!

“HMM? It’s here. The Divine Dragon’s blood is indeed very attractive to these abyssal seeds!”

He squinted his eyes and looked ahead!

His eyes were filled with joy!

“Squeak Squeak!”

The ear-piercing sound was getting closer and closer. Soon, dozens of green-eyed, pitch-black bird-shaped abyssal seeds flew over!

“There are ten immortal king level abyssal seeds. Very good, very good. Another huge harvest!”

Wang Xian muttered to himself. He suddenly felt that killing these abyssal seeds was too easy!

Out of the ten abyssal seeds, the strongest one was only at Immortal King Level 3. When they entered Wang Xian’s attack range, he waved his arm and caught them all easily!

“Very good!”

With a wave of his arm, he killed them and threw them into the mother nest!

“Let’s continue to wait and see!”

Wang Xian did not leave and continued to hide in the surroundings!

This time, after waiting for half an hour, he finally managed to find a group of abyssal seeds again!

This time, there were more than a hundred of them. There were more than a hundred immortal king level ones, with one immortal King Level 5 being the main one!

This made Wang Xian extremely excited!

In just a short day, he managed to capture so many abyssal seeds. This harvest was too terrifying!

“I have to call the members of the Dragon Palace over and use the dragon blood in the dragon transformation pool to attract them. This will allow the Dragon Palace’s strength to increase crazily!”

Wang Xian mumbled. He hesitated for a moment and prepared to stay in the abyss for a few more days!

In the next few days, Wang Xian used the divine dragon blood to attract one abyss species after another!

The most he attracted was an abyss species that was flying in the void. There were over 10,000 of them, and there were also over 100 immortal kings!

However, it was a pity that the leader of this Abyss race was an immortal King Level 8 existence!

After Wang Xian sensed it, he did not even receive the Divine Dragon’s blood and immediately fled into the distance!

“Ga Ga Ga Ga!”

After escaping from that Abyss race, Wang Xian heard an excited and ear-piercing cry coming from behind!

That level eight immortal king Abyss species must have devoured his blood!

“Phew, I’ve harvested over 500 corpses of immortal king Abyss species in half a month. This is a huge harvest. I can definitely call the members of the Dragon Palace over. This way, the harvest will be even greater!”

Wang Xian mumbled to himself. His body moved and he immediately flew towards the exit of the Abyss!

Wang Xian had not investigated much about the basic situation of the abyss. With the lure of the Dragon Blood, he could definitely send the members of the Dragon Palace over!

After spending six hours at the exit, Wang Xian immediately took out his AI to inform Prime Minister Gui and the rest!

...

“Send Strange Demon, Ao he, the Fire Hammer clan, and the berserk dragon species over. Three Hundred Immortal King level members should be about the same. Bring about 5,000 jin of dragon blood from the Dragon Transformation Pool!”

Wang Xian instructed Prime Minister Gui!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui immediately replied!

“Ao Yao, Duan Jinming, Ao Qitian, Ao Qi, bring 60 men each. Gather 200 men. Ao he, follow them and head to the Dragon King!”

In the Dragon Palace, Prime Minister Gui immediately called the leaders over!

“Also, Ao Yao, hide with the other dragon species and don’t be discovered!”

Prime Minister Gui’s eyes flickered as he reminded!

“Yes!”

Ao Yao nodded slightly!

“Ao crab, take the dragon blood and meet up with the Dragon King!”

...

Ao Yao, Ao Qitian, and the rest nodded and immediately flew out of the dragon star towards Wang Xian’s location!

“Members of the Dragon Palace have come out. According to our investigations, there are four level 6 immortal kings and more than 130 other members. All of them are immortal kings. They should be heading towards the Abyss!”

“There’s no trace of the Dragon King entering the Abyss half a month ago, they should have met up with the Dragon King!”

Not long after Ao Yao and the rest came out, news began to spread to a planet within the level 9 Sky sect domain!

At this time, in a large hall on the planet, over 100 undying godly monarchs sat there, looking at the report!

“We know that the Dragon King and over 100 Dragon Palace disciples have entered the abyss. Everyone knows about the situation in the abyss, I feel that this is our chance!”

The three seas sect leader scanned his surroundings, his eyes gleaming as he said!

“The Abyss is so huge, it will be difficult to meet them!”

The demon Slayer sect leader frowned and said softly!

“This is a good opportunity, but the Abyss is too big. It is undoubtedly very difficult to find people. However, if we don’t go, the chances are even slimmer!”

“We can send people over. Even if we can’t meet the Dragon King, we can still focus on killing the abyss seeds. We will distribute them when the time comes!”

An expert of the Jianhua group pondered for a moment and said!

“But if we want to make a move, the ninth-grade sky sect must have a patriarch. Otherwise, the Dragon King will be able to destroy all of us!”

An expert from the Black Forest Group looked at the ninth-grade sky sect’s people!

“It’s impossible for all of US Patriarchs to go over. However, it’s enough for one of us to contend with the Dragon King. The rest of us can destroy the rest of the Dragon King’s subordinates!”

The people from the ninth-rank sky sect pondered for a moment and nodded!
