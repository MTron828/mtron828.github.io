Chapter 731: If we can’t afford to offend 0732, let’s Retreat (9/20)

Translator: 549690339

With the establishment of the Dragon Palace and the rise of the water tribe, Wang Xian had shifted his attention from the martial arts world to the ocean.

When he returned to Jiang City, Wang Xian had three important things to do.

The first was the dragon vein. When the dragon vein was fully formed, he could take it away.

The second was about Shuqing.

Currently, Guan Shu Qing had yet to wake up. According to his guess and what Tang Yinxuan said, it was because of her soul that she could not wake up.

Wang Xian needed to collect spiritual herbs related to the soul to recover her soul.

Or, he could look for a godly doctor who could heal the injuries of the soul.

Thirdly, it was about the formation.

Currently, the Dragon Palace was still short of the last formation which could be upgraded to level-2.

A level two dragon palace possessed the ability to move under the sea.

Unfortunately, Wang Xian had rarely encountered an array formation, let alone a level two array formation!

Furthermore, with the current strength of the Dragon Palace, they did not have the ability to dominate the entire jianghu.

Out of the twenty immortal sects, the Mingwang Immortal sect and the puppet immortal sect were considered relatively weak existences.

Even so, each of their immortal sects had two immortals, not to mention the Top-notch Xuan Yuan clan.

According to the current ranking of the immortal sects, the Xuan Yuan clan was ranked first.

There were eight immortals in the clan, and there was even a superior immortal.

With the strength of a superior immortal, he could easily kill a middle-level immortal.

“Please speak, Dragon King!”

When they heard that Wang Xian had no intention of fighting for territory, they heaved a sigh of relief.

The initial dispute between the celestial sect was due to the issue of territory and territory.

The celestial sect had hundreds of thousands or even millions of disciples. These people needed to be fed, so territory was very important to them.

“I want to ask if there are any formations and spiritual herbs that can grow or heal souls!”

Wang Xian asked them.

“Formations? Spiritual herbs that can heal the soul?”

The six of them looked at each other and said, “There are very few spiritual herbs and elixirs that can heal the soul. It is possible that the Holy Medicine Immortal sect has such special spiritual herbs!”

“Other than the Holy Medicine Immortal sect, is there any other immortal sect that has them?”

Wang Xian asked after some thought.

He had a grudge with the Holy Medicine Immortal sect. If he were to ask for the herbs, they would probably start a fight.

The Holy Medicine Immortal Sect and the Holy Medicine Immortal sect were very powerful. They could be ranked in the top five among the immortal sects.

With the current strength of the Dragon Palace, they could at most contend with them.

“Other than the Holy Medicine Immortal sect, the only other sect is the innate immortal sect. The innate immortal sect mainly cultivates the wood attribute. They have planted a large number of spiritual herbs!”

Wang Xian nodded slowly. Then, he looked at the six of them and said, “Thank you very much. If you have a level-two array formation and information about spiritual herbs, please inform us!”

“Don’t worry. If we get any information, we will definitely inform the Dragon King!”

The six of them immediately promised.

Wang Xian nodded his head and said, “Jiang city is still your territory. Just don’t let your disciples come and provoke me. In addition, I plan to open a forging shop in Jiang city to refine spiritual weapons and elixirs. To refine a spiritual weapon, you only need two sets of materials. For three sets of materials to refine elixirs, you can give four elixirs. You Don’t have to charge any spiritual stones. There is a prerequisite. You can only refine elixirs above level-six and spiritual weapons above level-eleven.”

“When the time comes, if you want to refine pills and weapons, you can look for me!”

“Dragon King, do you know how to refine pills and weapons?”

The Old Man from the puppet immortal sect revealed an astonished expression.

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“Can you refine a grade-13 spiritual weapon?”

Wind Devil asked hurriedly.

Wang Xian shook his head. “I haven’t found any secret manuals regarding the formation of weapons.”

The secret manuals that were used to inscribe formations were not recorded in the book of the Fire God that was in a Jiaya’s hands for some unknown reason.

Currently, Wang Xian only lacked the method to inscribe formations to be able to forge a level-13 spirit weapon.

A hint of disappointment appeared on the faces of wind demon and wind fiend.

The weapon in their hands was merely a spirit weapon that was forged from a level-13 spirit weapon. It was equivalent to a level-12 spirit weapon.

If they could find a grandmaster in artifact refinement, they could directly upgrade the spiritual weapon in their hands to grade-13.

“Goodbye!”

After chatting for a while more, they left. Wang Xian watched them leave with a smile on his face.

“Phew!”

The people from the Mingwang Immortal sect and the puppet immortal sect who flew out heaved a sigh of relief.

“If brother Fengsha, the wind devil, didn’t remind us this time, I’m afraid we would be in trouble!”

An immortal God from the Mingwang Immortal sect said with a bitter face.

“We didn’t expect to meet him here.”

Fengmo and Fengsha shook their heads.

“When we go back, order the disciples of the immortal sect not to provoke the Dragon King of the Dragon sect in the future!”

An immortal God said with a solemn look, “If anyone dares to provoke him, the immortal sect’s law enforcement team will punish him directly!”

“Okay!”

The other three nodded. Provoking an opponent who was even stronger than them was undoubtedly courting death.

Although they were amiable this time, it was hard to guarantee that some blind immortal sect disciple would anger the Dragon King and become their enemy!

“Let’s go back!”

The six people moved and quickly flew toward the immortal sect.

At this moment, it was only eleven o’clock. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Eleven o’clock was not a rest for most of the immortal sect’s warriors.

A warrior could sleep for five to six hours a day!

“All the immortal sect deacons and elders, come over!”

Two immortal gods from the puppet immortal sect and the Ming Wang Immortal sect came to the main peak of the immortal sect, their voices directly covering the entire immortal sect.

“The sect master and the others have already destroyed the Dragon Gate?”

“It must be, the immortal God must have killed the Dragon King!”

“Haha, maybe the Dragon King’s corpse was directly brought here and hung on the city gate to warn everyone!”

Inside the immortal sect, the disciples of the immortal sect heard the sect leader’s voice, and their faces were filled with excitement.

One by one, the experts of the immortal sect flew toward the main peak with excited faces.

The sect leader and the others had just left. Now that they had returned, they must have finished off the reckless Dragon King of the Dragon sect.

“Sect leader, deputy sect leader!”

The experts of the immortal sect came to the main peak and saw the two white figures standing in the middle. They called out respectfully.

“Sect leader, has the murderer been killed?”

The bald old man asked excitedly.

When the two immortal gods heard his words, the corners of their mouths could not help but Twitch. Fortunately, the white light covered their faces.

“Today, we will announce something. You will pass it on to every disciple of the immortal sect today!”

The Ming Wang Immortal Sect’s sect master raised his voice and said in a deep voice.

“Sect master, please speak!”

The group of Immortal sect powerhouses immediately bowed.

“From today onwards, no disciple of the Ming Wang Immortal sect is allowed to provoke the dragon sect or the Dragon King. Otherwise, the sect rules will punish them!”

The Ming Wang Immortal Sect’s sect master ordered them with a firm tone.

“What?”

Everyone in the shop was stunned, and their faces revealed an incredulous look.

“If you don’t want to die, then don’t provoke them. They are not people that our immortal sect can provoke!”

“In addition, the Dragon King of Dragon Gate has opened a forging shop on the ancient street of Jiang City. Only two sets of materials are required to forge spirit weapons. Three sets of materials are required to forge pills, and four pills are required to forge pills. No spirit stones are required. There is one condition, which is to only forge pills above level six and spirit weapons above level eleven.”

“It’s quite suitable. If you want to forge, you can go there!”
