Chapter 1599: Domineering and Crazy 3

“The goddess of desolation will come. As for whether the others will come, we don’t know!”

The supreme headmaster heard the report and said with a smile.

“What? Father, the goddess of desolation will come?”

As soon as the supreme headmaster finished his words, Aotian who was beside him showed a surprised expression and asked immediately.

“The Desolation Goddess will come? The supreme headmaster actually invited the Desolation Goddess!”

“Oh my God, the mysterious desolation sea goddess, she actually came today. This is an extremely terrifying existence!”

“Although the desolation goddess only attacked once, she instantly destroyed the first-rate power, the Nanshan family. She is much more terrifying than the Sky Demon!”

“The Skyfiend and the goddess of desolation are simply not on the same level. The goddess of desolation is an existence that even the three super factions fear!”

When the surrounding factions heard the supreme headmaster’s words, they revealed shocked expressions.

Compared to the high-profile skyfiend, the goddess of desolation was very low-key. She had only attacked once.

However, that one time had made all the forces in the vast region see how terrifying that person was.

Even the three super forces had acknowledged that person as the mistress of the Sea of desolation.

Her terrifying behemoth and strange abilities had shocked all the forces, including the three Super Forces.

“The goddess of desolation has actually come to the only sect!”

Everyone in Wuji Empire had solemn expressions on their faces.

Nangong Jianghe’s arrival and the arrival of the goddess of desolation, could it be a signal?

Was our sect closer to the goddess of desolation?

The supreme headmaster nodded his head lightly and looked around.

“As for whether there is anyone else, that is no longer important. Today is the day of my son’s wedding!”

“But before that, our sect would like to announce something!”

The supreme sect leader’s body slowly emitted a supreme aura.

The aura directly charged towards everyone in front of him.

The hearts of all the factions in the vast region slightly trembled as they watched in awe.

“Ever since my only sect was established, all the enemies who dared to provoke my only sect have now turned to dust!”

A cold voice sounded in everyone’s ears.

Everyone knew that our cult had started to take action against the Sky Demon!

If they didn’t take action, it would be fine. But if they did, it would probably be a massacre!

“The last time a faction provoked our cult was more than 10,000 years ago!”

“At that time, more than five million people from that faction were all killed. Even those who were related to that faction were all killed!”

“Those who offend the supreme sect will be executed!”

The supreme sect leader’s voice thundered in everyone’s ears.

This shocked everyone.

“What is the supreme sect trying to do?”

An elder from the He clan frowned. He suddenly had a bad premonition. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Our ancestors are weak. The supreme sect can not be weak. Even if it is heaven or earth, we must kill the Sky Devil!”

The supreme headmaster stood there, his body slowly emitting traces of killing intent.

“Today is my son’s wedding day. Red represents celebration, but...”

“Sorry, I’m late...”

Just as the supreme headmaster continued to speak, an indifferent voice came from afar.

The supreme headmaster focused his gaze and looked forward.

Everyone around him was also slightly shocked. They immediately turned their heads.

“He’s here. The Sky Demon is really here. He actually dared to come here!”

“Hiss, as expected of the Sky Demon. However, he is simply sending himself to his death by coming here!”

When the people from all the factions saw Wang Xian and Mo Sha walking over in the air, a hint of shock appeared on their faces.

One step, two steps, and three steps later, Wang Xian had already arrived at the spot in front of Yingtian Peak.

His gaze landed on Ling Jian ‘er. He heaved a sigh of relief when he felt that Ling Jian ‘er was not injured at all.

“Jian ‘er, I’m here to bring you back!”

Wang Xian said softly.

“Shut up. A person who is about to die actually dares to address my ao Tian’s wife by her name!”

Ao Tian’s lips curled up slightly when he saw Wang Xian’s arrival as he shouted coldly.

“Supreme Headmaster, kill him, kill him!”

Beside him, Bing Fa Wu stared at Wang Xian with a heavy breathing and growled in a low voice.

“Haha, since you are a guest, let this sky demon enjoy the last scene of his life!”

The supreme headmaster smiled and said loudly.

“Continue then!”

Wang Xian stood in the air and stared at the supreme headmaster indifferently.

“As expected of the Sky Demon. Even when he met the supreme headmaster, he still has this kind of spirit!”

“What Kind of spirit? He’s just a boorish man, a person who is about to die!”

The people around saw Wang Xian and discussed in a low voice.

Everyone from the He clan and the Wuji Empire frowned.

Putting everything aside, just this kind of spirit was enough to make them submit.

“Hehe, red represents celebration. However, there are still many heroic souls in our sect that have yet to be sacrificed. The heroic souls have to be sacrificed with fresh blood. Coincidentally, the fresh blood is also red, so...”

“With the blood of the Sky Demon and the blood of all the relatives and friends of the Sky Demon, let us offer our congratulations!”

A blood-colored wedding sounded a little scary. However, this was not the tyranny of our sect.

Everything was caused by Ling Jian ‘er and the Sky Demon. Even though Ling Jian ‘Er had married into our sect.

They still had to offer sacrifices to the souls that had died because of her.

Ao Tian did not have any objections to this blood-colored wedding. On the contrary, he was looking forward to it.

The only sect was the only sect.

As the supreme sect leader spoke, his gaze finally landed on Wang Xian. He didn’t put him in his eyes at all.

“Who does the supreme sect leader want to kill?”

“Family and friends?”

Everyone around was slightly shocked. Astonishment appeared on their faces.

As for the position of the He clan, when the He clan members heard these words, their expressions changed instantly.

“I will rush over to your Liuhai region and all your family and friends after today. But now...”

Buzz

The supreme headmaster waved his arm and an image appeared in the sky.

“No, no, don’t kill me, don’t kill me!”

“Please don’t kill me. We have nothing to do with priest Wang. We are merely being treated by him!”

Terrified voices were suddenly heard.

At this moment, the expressions of all the forces changed drastically.

Even Wang Xian, who had long been calm and composed, trembled. His eyes were fixed on the scene in the image.

“Nearly 100,000 people are indebted to you. Die!”

The supreme headmaster pointed his finger in the air. In the screen, gusts of wind blades slashed towards the 100,000 people.

“Ahhhh!”

The screams were clearly heard by everyone. It was so terrifying that it made one’s hair stand on end.

Wang Xian’s body trembled a little as he slowly closed his eyes. He slowly raised his head and placed the violent blood pill into his mouth.

I didn’t kill Bo Ren and Bo Ren, but I’m the one who died!

There’s no need to retreat!

“Haha, Die, die. Kill millions of my ice race members. Everyone who is related to the sky demon must die!”

Below, Bing Jinghuan was roaring ferociously when he saw this scene.

His face was filled with excitement and ferocity.

Everyone in the surroundings was shocked.

Overbearing and crazy!

This was the solipsistic sect!

“This is only the beginning. He Yuan from the He clan came out to commit suicide!”
