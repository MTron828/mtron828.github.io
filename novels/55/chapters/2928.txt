Chapter 2929: crusade against the Machine Imperial Region 4

“The Dragon Palace’s army has come to support our glazed area. The Dragon King led a group of experts to directly attack the robot army and chase after the robot army into the Machine Imperial Region!”

When all the soldiers at the border of glazed area and machine imperial region retreated, news of what had happened here had spread on the brain of the glazed area.

When all the citizens of the glazed domain learned that the dragon palace had come to support them, they were filled with gratitude.

They were also shocked that the Dragon Palace had directly invaded the machine imperial region.

Soon, they saw that annoying guy, invincible in battle, send a message.

“The Dragon King has personally led the experts of the Dragon Palace into the machine imperial region. It Won’t be long before the machine imperial region is swept away!”

The message this time was not long, and there was no sarcasm.

When all the people saw the message that the combat method was invincible, they were all shocked.

“The Dragon Palace is going to attack the machine royal territory? Didn’t they help us guard the border? Why is the Dragon Palace going to attack the machine royal territory?”

“Is this true? Is it true that the combat method is invincible? is the Dragon Palace going to invade the machine royal territory?”

“Hiss, it can’t be. Even our glazed domain can’t destroy the machine royal territory. Does the dragon palace have the strength to do so? If they attack the machine royal territory, how much will the Dragon Palace lose?”

Guarding the border and going out to the machine royal territory were two different things.

Guarding the border only needed to act as a deterrent.

However, going out to the machine royal territory was a galactic war. It was a vast war.

In such a war, the casualties would be counted in the hundreds of billions.

In particular, the armory royal territory was not weak, but very strong.

Did he have the strength to attack the Dragon Palace?

“Do you think the Dragon Palace is as weak as your glazed area? Wait for the news. The robots will all be destroyed soon!”

However, soon, invincible battle techniques started a debate again.

He started to mock the entire glazed area.

However, it was better this time because it was related to the Dragon Palace. After all, the Dragon Palace was here to help the glazed area. Other than the fact that they were invincible in their battle techniques, they did not say anything bad about the Dragon Palace.

Then, everyone in the glazed area started to guess the strength of the Dragon Palace.

Could the dragon palace really sweep across the entire glazed area?

Could the Dragon Palace defeat the robots?

As they did not know the exact situation, they could only make various guesses.

Some said that the Dragon Palace could defeat the machine imperial region, some said that the dragon palace might really be stronger than their glazed domain, and some did not believe it.

The entire glazed domain’s AI was bustling with noise and excitement.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

And at this moment, the main character that they were discussing was chasing after the robot army.

The battleships, mechas, and fighter jets that had extended for more than a billion kilometers quickly flew towards the depths of the mechanical imperial region.

The endless artillery fire continuously attacked the rear.

The Army of the Dragon Palace chased after them from the rear.

“I really didn’t expect that the Dragon Palace would actually want to attack our mechanical imperial region and attack US Robots. How Outrageous!”

“Dragon Palace, you dare to provoke us? Then I’ll show you the cannon fire and punishment of our machine Royal Territory!”

On the machine royal ship, after watching the dragon palace chase them for half an hour, the murderous look in the creator’s eyes became more and more intense.

During this half an hour, he had analyzed all the power of the Dragon Palace.

In his opinion, this power was very strong and not much weaker than their machine royal territory.

However, just relying on this power to attack them was a huge mistake. He wanted to make the Dragon Palace pay a heavy price.

“That strange creature swallowed my people and was able to increase its strength. It’s really a special existence.”

“The legendary Divine Dragon. In the past, I wanted to hunt a divine dragon for research, but I didn’t expect you guys to come here on your own.”

“A race with a peak bloodline in the universe will definitely be able to improve my technology. Maybe it will be able to free me from the shackles of machines!”

“Since your Dragon Palace wants to attack us, then let’s fight. This time, even if the mechanical imperial region loses a little more, as long as we can obtain the body of a divine dragon, it will be worth it!”

“Hahaha, mechanical imperial region, all the robots, my people, kill over, kill over!”

Slowly, the creator’s eyes revealed a ferocious and excited expression.

He couldn’t help but roar.

When he found out that the Dragon Palace had a divine dragon, he had coveted the bloodline of the Universe Pinnacle Race, the Divine Dragon.

However, the Dragon Palace was already very powerful back then, but now, the other party dared to invade them, that was just right, kill!

Even if they had to pay a huge price, as long as they could kill one or two divine dragons, it wouldn’t be a loss!

He stood on the mechanical emperor ship as data flashed across his eyes.

At the same time, signals were sent to the mechanical emperor region.

“Beep Beep Beep!”

“Creator’s order, all robots are to switch to war mode. All robots are to enter the mechanical planet and head to the designated location!”

“Creator’s order, all robots are to switch to war mode. All robots are to enter the mechanical planet and head to the designated location!”

At this moment, all the robots stopped moving on the robot planets in the entire imperial mechanical region.

An order entered their minds, causing their eyes to slowly turn red.

“Obey the creator’s order!”

“Obey the creator’s order!”

In the next moment, all the robots responded loudly.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

Soon after, the planet they were on let out a rumbling sound.

All the robots immediately flew to the center of the robot planet.

There, a huge platform rose up, and all kinds of mechanical weapons were placed on it.

All the robots turned into warriors and flew towards the creator on the robot planet.

There were tens of thousands of mechanical planets and hundreds of billions of mechs rushing towards the creator.

At the same time, at the center of the mechanical imperial region, the mechanical planet with a diameter of hundreds of millions of kilometers was surrounded by eighteen small mechanical planets. They were also moving.

On the mechanical planet, there were two mechs that were millions of meters in size.

There were mechanical creatures that looked like falcons.

They stared coldly at the void in front of them, their eyes flashing with all kinds of data.

The entire machine imperial region started to move.

The entire strength of the mechs started to move and flew towards the creator. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

It was vast and shocking.

“Hehe!”

Seeing the entire machine imperial region move, the creator revealed a grim expression. He stared at the people of the Dragon Palace who were chasing behind him and sneered.

“After chasing for so long, the other robot armies from the machine royal territory must have gathered towards the creator by now.”

At this moment, Wang Xian was floating behind the members of the Dragon Palace and was following behind them. He was locked onto the creator.

The God Emperor members who were hiding in the 1.5 million armies of the Dragon Palace still did not make a move.

He was waiting!
