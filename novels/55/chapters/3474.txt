3475 3474 tai chi Dragon Plate breakthrough and Holy Dragon Ambush

Apart from a Level 2 universe dominator battle skeleton, there was another huge harvest.

That was the human-headed grass.

The human-headed grass was a treasure.

“No, no, don’t kill me, don’t kill me!”

The skeleton that was caught by Wang Xian begged for mercy in fear, “I’m willing to take out all my treasures, don’t kill me.”

“Three level two masters of the universe are hunting here. You should have gained a lot, right?”

Wang Xian looked at him and said with a smile.

“Sir, please let me go. As long as you let me go, I will take out the treasures in my divine kingdom. This is definitely much more valuable than the treasures offered by the spiritual demon race. Please let me go, sir.”

The skeleton continued.

“HMM? The reward offered by the spiritual demon race?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly and stared at him with a twinkle in his eyes.

He didn’t expect that this fellow would be offered a reward by the spiritual demon race.

It seemed that they had killed quite a number of powerhouses.

The fact that they were able to live such a comfortable life despite being offered a reward by the spiritual demon race had a lot to do with their strength.

With this skeleton and the other two skeletons joining forces, they were indeed invincible.

However, it was a pity that they met Wang Xian this time.

“I want your life. I want the rest of your things as well!”

Wang Xian stared at him. With a wave of his hand, he landed a heavy blow on his head.

The eight wisps of skeleton flames on his head dimmed instantly. A few of them were showing signs of extinguishing.

“This defense is really tough!”

Wang Xian muttered and landed another palm on it.

“Soul capture!”

Following that, his mind moved and the flames that were jumping in his pupils stopped.

“Summon Your Kingdom of God!”

He ordered.

“Yes!”

The heavily injured skeleton responded mechanically. Soon, a Kingdom of God appeared behind him.

However, the Kingdom of God of this skeleton was a little strange and special.

The Kingdom of God of this skeleton looked like a coffin, and it was only 100,000 meters in size.

In the divine kingdom, it was considered a very small existence.

Wang Xian walked over and immediately opened the coffin’s divine kingdom. Everything inside came into view.

The entire Coffin’s divine kingdom was bare, and there were pitifully few things inside.

Some divine herbs and elixirs were on the level of the Master of the universe.

However, there were no demonic skeletons inside.

After thinking about it, it made sense. Skeletons could absorb and evolve, and after they killed each other, they could absorb them.

However, there were six innate spiritual treasures, all of which were of the darkness attribute.

This could greatly improve the tai chi dragon plate.

Apart from that, a special treasure caught his attention.

It was a skeleton that contained a huge amount of energy, a pink skeleton.

It was a palm, a pink human palm.

Inside this pink palm, there were two types of energy.

One was of the darkness attribute while the other was of the fire attribute.

Wang Xian was a little surprised by the fact that it was a bone palm with two attributes.

“The energy of this pink palm is extremely powerful. It’s even stronger than an innate spiritual treasure. Is this left behind by a fallen powerhouse? If that’s the case, how strong is this former powerhouse?”

Wang Xian looked at the pink palm and mumbled.

If this palm didn’t grow in the later stages, the owner of this palm would have been too terrifying when he was still alive.

He was definitely not an ordinary master of the universe.

It was possible that his real realm had reached the second or third stage of the Master of the universe, or even higher.

“It’s a pity that it can’t be used to upgrade the Tai Chi Dragon Plate and the five elements Millstone.”

Wang Xian felt a little regretful. The two attributes contained in this palm could not be absorbed by the Tai Chi Dragon Plate and the five elements millstone.

“Keep it. I might be able to use it in the future.”

He kept it well and looked at the skeleton in front of him. With a palm strike, he destroyed it completely.

The Tai Chi Dragon Plate appeared in the surroundings and allowed it to be absorbed.

Wang Xian looked at his surroundings. He decided to continue hunting some demonic skeletons after the tai chi dragon plate was upgraded.

He moved to the back and entered the skeleton. He started to help the tai chi dragon plate refine the skeletons.

Time passed day by day.

Just as the Tai Chi Dragon Plate was upgraded, five figures flew over to the area of the demon bones.

“What an annoying aura. Kill that guy as soon as possible and leave. I don’t want to stay here for a day.”

In the sky in front of the underground demon cave city, there was a huge eye on the head. Four figures with dragon horns on their heads were flying over quickly.

The one who spoke was a middle-aged man. He had an annoyed expression on his face.

With dragon horns on his head, his body contained the pure power of a divine dragon. His body was like the sunlight.

This was the Holy Dragon, the Divine Light Dragon of the Holy Dragon lineage.

Four pure-bred divine light dragons!

“There are four Lord Divine Dragons. It’s easy to destroy them.”

Red-eye said lightly.

“Find them as soon as possible. After we destroy them, we still have to hunt down the fellows from the ancestral dragon lineage.”

A divine light dragon urged.

“Don’t worry. I have one of the eyes of the alliance master, so I can easily find them.”

Red-eye replied, the eyes in his hands shining, “He’s right in front of us.”

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Five figures flew over quickly and soon arrived above the underground demon cave city.

“He’s inside. This is the underground demon cave city of the Devil Bone Land. It’s extremely complicated inside.”

Red-eye looked over, his voice carrying a hint of helplessness.

“Can’t Your Alliance Leader’s Eyes Lock onto his position accurately?”

A light dragon God frowned and asked.

“We can lock onto his position, but we can’t lock onto his route. The few of you can check this place on the AI. It’s very troublesome. I suggest we ambush him here and wait for him to come out!”

Red-eye suggested.

“Ambush him here? Then if he doesn’t come out for a few decades, we should also ambush him here? If he goes back to his own divine kingdom, then wouldn’t we be waiting for Nothing?” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Light Dragon said.

“If he goes back to his own divine kingdom, your eyes can lock onto his divine kingdom.”

Red-eyed said.

“Let’s wait here. Even if it’s a few decades, it’s just a little time.”

The Divine Light Dragon, who looked the oldest, said. He swept his gaze across the surroundings and said, “Let’s set up an ambush first and conceal ourselves.”

“Alright!”

The other three divine light dragons nodded their heads. This was an order from the Holy Dragon King, and they had to complete it.

The five figures moved and hid in the surrounding areas, quietly waiting for Wang Xian to appear.

Wang Xian didn’t know that there were already experts lying in wait for him outside.

He didn’t expect that the experts from the Hundred Cities Alliance would be able to find him here.

A month later, the light and darkness on the Tai Chi Dragon Disk spun and erupted with a powerful force.

The Tai Chi Dragon Disk had broken through!
