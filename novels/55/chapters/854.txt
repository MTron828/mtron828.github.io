Chapter 855: 0856 Dragon King vs Godly King 3

Translator: 549690339

Behind the Dragon King, there were more than three groups of creatures.

There was a type of demon monkey, a demon monkey that emitted demonic aura. Each of its body was covered in black scales. The leading few held golden cudgels in their hands, exuding the might of Immortals and gods.

There were more than a thousand of these demon monkeys, and their demonic flames were monstrous, making one’s heart palpitate.

The other type of creatures were creatures that emitted lightning. They were like shrimps. The leader of the group was a dozen or so creatures. One of them had an arm that was like a war hammer, and the other had an arm that was like a lightning spear. Their bodies flickered with lightning.

There were a total of around two hundred of them. They were extremely terrifying.

In the middle was a group of humans. They held golden longswords in their hands. They were extremely cold, like machines. Their bodies emitted terrifying sword rays.

There were about 150 swordsmen in this group.

Other than these three groups of humans and creatures, there were also a few very special and even terrifying things.

A middle-aged man with a few heads and nine arms.

Every face of the middle-aged man was extremely thin and pale. His triangular eyes revealed a sinister and terrifying look.

His body was not big, but he was extremely eye-catching behind the Dragon King.

No creature dared to approach him.

Three meters away from the middle-aged man, there was a strange creature. This creature was like a spider.

He had a hairy head and eight arms. His left and right arms were like swords and his right hands were like rapiers. He was very strange and looked very terrifying.

There were a total of ten such creatures.

“Oh my God, there are about seventy immortals and deities. There are actually seventy of them!”

The streamer and all the immortal sects and experts around him widened their eyes in shock when they saw this scene.

The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace had already led seventy immortals and deities out before there was any movement from the Yuwen clan.

Looking in that direction, they were flying toward the Yuwen clan.

What were they going to do?

Attack!

Just like the last time, the Dragon King wanted to take the initiative to attack.

“How could it be? How could the Dragon Palace have so many immortal and deity experts? And did you see that many of them are other creatures? The Dragon Palace, the Dragon Palace... could it be that the Dragon King’s Dragon Palace is built in the ocean and his subordinates are also creatures of the ocean?”

The host widened his eyes and roared in shock.

It was really too shocking. Just now, they were still discussing and voting about who would lose this battle. In the end, 99% of the people thought that the Dragon Palace would be destroyed.

However, in less than ten minutes, the Dragon King suddenly led a group of terrifying immortal God creatures to attack and fly towards the Yuwen clan.

“There is also a terrifying invisible creature in the Dragon Palace. There are definitely many of those creatures. In other words, the number of immortal gods in the Dragon Palace is even more than that of the Nordic divine realm and the Yuwen clan!”

The surrounding immortal gods sucked in a breath of cold air.

The power of the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace was too terrifying. It made everyone feel incredulous.

Too powerful, too powerful.

“I thought the Dragon King would lose. Now, it seems that the one who will lose is probably the godly King!”

“A big battle, a real big battle. There will be nearly two hundred immortals fighting today. Oh My God!”

Whether it was the surrounding immortals or the people who saw this scene through the live broadcast, their faces were filled with shock.

With the reversal of the situation, the immortals in the Dragon Palace were no less than the Norse celestial domain and the Yuwen clan. In fact, they were even stronger and more bizarre!

“There are twenty immortals hiding in the surrounding 50 kilometers!”

Prime Minister Gui followed the Dragon King and walked in the air. He looked at the turtle shell in his hand and whispered.

Behind him, there were also turtles. Each turtle shell’s eyes were filled with wisdom and wisdom.

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the surroundings and paid no attention to them.

This time, 100 immortal-level members of the Dragon Palace were dispatched. It was obvious that there were 70 members of the Dragon Palace and 30 immortal-level demons hiding around them.

Other than the immortal-level members, there were also 50 nascent realm and half-step immortal-level members. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Almost one-third of the immortal-level members of the Dragon Palace had arrived, but more than half of the powers below the immortal-level had arrived.

There were not many members in the Dragon Palace to begin with.

In fact, among the group of creatures in the Dragon Palace, Tang Yinxuan and five dolphins at the level of Immortals and deities had also come along.

Since it was a drill, they would display the strongest battle formation of the Dragon Palace.

The nine dragons rode on their steeds and flew rapidly towards the Yuwen clan.

Among this group of creatures, there were only a few hundred of them at the Dan Stage. The rest were all at the infant stage.

Although there were only two thousand of them, their strength was definitely terrifying enough.

Wang Xian did not hide anything as he proceeded forward. When he passed by a bustling city, everyone looked at this scene with shock on their faces.

On the Jianghu website and the live broadcast platform, there was even a falling out. It was as though there was an earthquake of over ten levels.

“Just when everyone thought that the Dragon King would be annihilated, the Dragon King once again launched a desperate counterattack. This is the true strength of the Dragon Palace!”

“Invincible. Just like the Holy Doctor, Holy Medicine, and Immortal Sect, the Dragon King directly sent people to kill him!”

“Haha, this is interesting. If the Dragon King dares to kill him, he has the confidence to kill the godly king. That’s awesome!”

When everyone received the news, they were discussing in shock.

The Dragon King had given them too many surprises!

Once again, when everyone thought that the Dragon King would be completely defeated, the Dragon King shocked the world again. He led the powerful and terrifying members of the Dragon Palace to fly in the direction of the Yuwen clan.

Their flying speed was very fast. In less than half an hour, they were already within 50 kilometers of the Yuwen clan.

“Eh?”

At this moment, Prime Minister Gui, who was holding the turtle shell in his hand, let out a surprised cry. He stared at his own turtle shell and moved slightly.

“Dragon King, there are a total of 200 immortals within 50 kilometers. The number of immortals is somewhat unexpected!”

Prime Minister Gui raised his head and spoke to Wang Xian who was walking forward.

“HMM? 200 celestials?”

Wang Xian was slightly taken aback. A hint of doubt appeared on his face.

“Including those who are hiding in the surroundings, there shouldn’t be 200 of them. That’s too many. It should be?”

Prime Minister Gui’s eyes flickered as he looked at the many pairs of eyes in the void. A hint of a smile appeared on his face as he said, “I’ll get the Big Blue Belt Celestial God to rush over. It Won’t take more than five minutes!”

“Alright, slow down!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly. “This is really interesting. I told you that there’s something strange about the Yuwen clan. Three days have passed and they still haven’t come out. Furthermore, they are deliberately releasing their strength. Haha, this is really interesting!”

He laughed and ordered the nine dragons to slow down. They were slowly approaching the Yuwen clan.

“They’re coming, the Dragon King is coming!”

“They’re still coming in a domineering manner. The aura of the members of the Dragon Palace is so terrifying that it far surpasses that of humans. Each and every one of them is extremely strange. Are they trying to destroy the Northern European divine realm and the Yuwen Clan?”

The Immortal God powerhouses and streamers who had gathered around and had specialized livestreams revealed shocked expressions when they saw the arrival of the Dragon King.

The nine flood dragons gave off a terrifying aura as they slowly arrived at the Yuwen clan’s territory and stopped in the air.

There were seventy immortal-level creatures. Their Savage, demonic, and cold aura far surpassed that of the human immortals of the same level.

The Dragon King and the rest stopped there as if they were powerful existences from the bottom of the sea.

“Haha, I Knew You would bring people here. It’s as I expected!”

Wang Xian didn’t say anything as he looked ahead quietly.

At this moment, a loud laughter was heard. On a mountain peak of the Yuwen clan, a wise white-haired elder stood on the mountain peak and laughed heartily.

This loud laughter shocked everyone once again!
