Chapter 1218: He was the sword demon

Translator: 5496903

“It seems to be the lady called Ling Jian ‘Er!”

Wang Xian looked at the lady who was lying on the ground with a look of surprise on his face.

“Awoo, awoo!”

Seeing that Wang Xian was standing there motionlessly, Xiao Ha bit on Wang Xian’s pants and tugged anxiously.

“Why is she lying here? It shouldn’t be!”

Wang Xian looked at Xiao Ha and flew to the lady’s side.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian sensed her life force and frowned slightly. Her aura was weak and she could die at any time.

“Water and wood healing!”

Wang Xian did not hesitate at all. The dual-attribute healing spell landed on her body.

A terrifying life force entered Ling Jian ‘ER’s body. The majestic life force caused her body to move.

Her eyelashes trembled slightly.

It had to be said that Ling Jian ‘er was very beautiful. At least in Wang Xian’s eyes, she wasn’t any worse than Shu Qing and the rest.

However, she wasn’t any better than Shu Qing and the rest either.

Therefore, Wang Xian didn’t have the slightest fluctuation when faced with such an ordinary beauty.

“HMM?”

Ling Jian ‘ER woke up. Her face gradually regained its rosy color. She was slightly stunned when she saw Wang Xian.

“Awoo!”

At this moment, Xiao Ha jumped in front of Ling Jian ‘ER’s face excitedly and licked it.

Ling Jian ‘ER’s heart was slightly enlightened. She looked at Wang Xian and said coldly, “Thank you!”

“No Need!”

Wang Xian stood there and shook his head. He didn’t leave immediately.

At this moment, Wang Xian and Ling Jian ‘ER’s face suddenly changed drastically. Their ruddy face quickly turned pale.

She frowned and touched the spot on her chest. Her expression changed slightly.

“It’s poison, heavenly antidote flower poison!”

Ling Jian ‘ER’s expression darkened. She shook her lips tightly and her body started to tremble slightly.

However, her expression quickly calmed down.

Wang Xian looked at her in astonishment.

Ling Jian ‘er was poisoned. It was a lethal poison. She had merely used her strong vitality to recover from it. The poison had not been removed at all.

It was obvious that she had also realized that she was poisoned. However, she did not react at all. Her aura gave him an ashen look as if she had accepted the fact that she was dead.

“I can save you!”

Wang Xian had wanted to wait for her to speak first. However, he had no choice but to speak.

“You can save me? I have been poisoned by the heavenly antidote flower poison. Even if a powerhouse at the first level of the Seethrough realm was poisoned, he would still die. There is no antidote at all!”

A faint desire to live flashed across Ling Jian ‘ER’s eyes. She raised her head and looked at him.

“Ten Thousand Spiritual Liquid!”

Wang Xian said faintly.

Ling Jian ‘er was slightly stunned when she heard her words. It was obvious that she was stunned by her words.

“Is it too much?”

Wang Xian saw her expression and frowned slightly. “Nine thousand is fine. If it’s really not possible, eight thousand it is!”

Ling Jian ‘er was even more stunned when she heard her words. This was the first time she had seen someone speak to her in such a manner.

“To be able to raise a pup of a demonic beast with a level two void interpretation bloodline and use a level two void interpretation weapon, you shouldn’t be unable to even take out 8,000 spiritual liquid, right?”

“It can’t be any less. If you don’t have it, give me the weapon in your hand!”

Wang Xian frowned and said to her.

“I have 10,000 spiritual liquid. Here, Oh!”

The pain in her body made her react. She quickly said as she felt a pain in her chest. She couldn’t help but spit out blood and immediately took out 10,000 spiritual liquid from her interspatial ring.

“She is indeed a rich woman!”

When Wang Xian saw the spiritual liquid, a hint of a smile flashed in his eyes. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He moved his arm and placed it directly on her shoulder.

Ling Jian ‘ER’s body trembled. She couldn’t help but widen her eyes slowly.

“The consumption is too great. Phew, Alright, I’m leaving!”

In just a dozen seconds, Wang Xian retracted his arm. His body, which was full of smiles, moved and disappeared. He returned to his own courtyard.

Ling Jian ‘er was in a daze as she sensed her body. Her face was filled with disbelief.

“He really cured the heavenly antidote flower poison. This...”

Her eyes flickered as she looked at her interspatial ring. Her breathing was slightly hurried.

In order to obtain the item in the interspatial ring, she was willing to risk her life.

If it wasn’t for the person who suddenly appeared, she would definitely die.

“Even if I obtain this treasure and become a peerless expert, what can I Do? Defeat Him?”

A bitter expression appeared on her face.

“AO AO!”

Xiao Ha’s cry came from beside her. Ling Jian ‘er smiled and carried him.

“Thank you, Xiao Ha!”

She stood up slowly and carried Xiao Ha.

“AO AO!”

Xiao Ha raised his head proudly. Then, he extended his claw and pointed in the direction of Wang Xian’s courtyard.

Ling Jian ‘ER followed the direction of its paw and muttered, “What a strange fellow.”

“Awoo, awoo!”

Suddenly, Xiao Ha let out a weak cry, causing Ling Jian ‘er to be slightly stunned.

“He, Wawa, Wawa!”

Xiao Ha looked at Ling Jian ‘er and spat out a word. Then, it began to gesture with its paw and opened its mouth wide.

“Are you saying that he is very strong?”

Ling Jian ‘er looked at it and asked with a smile.

“OW ow, Wawa, Wawa, ow ow ow, ow ow!”

Little ha nodded its head heavily and began to gesture again.

At the last moment, at the spot between its eyebrows, where the white face was, another eye opened.

Ling Jian ‘er was slightly stunned and opened her mouth slightly. “You mean, he’s that Sword Devil?”

“AO AO, AO ao ao!”

Xiao ha nodded heavily once again.

Ling Jian ‘ER looked at the courtyard not far away from her, her eyes filled with astonishment.

He was actually the sword demon.

The sword expert who had killed two insightful void realm experts yesterday, the sword demon.

Having witnessed his strength with her own eyes, even she was incomparably impressed.

However, such a powerful sword demon was actually such a young man.

How was this possible!

However, Xiao Ha had a third eye and a terrifying sense of smell. There was no way she would make a mistake.

“I really didn’t expect such a greedy guy to be that cold-blooded sword demon!”

Ling Jian ‘er recalled the scene of Wang Xian saving her and asking for the spiritual liquid. She couldn’t believe that sword demon was such a person.

“Haha, saving a person cost less than 1,000 dragon crystals and earned 9,000 spiritual liquid!”

Wang Xian returned to the courtyard and couldn’t help but laugh.

“It would be great if I could meet more people like this!”

Wang Xian thought with a smile. He didn’t want to wait for that Lady to die before he could obtain her treasures.

There was a way for a gentleman to take what he liked.

Of course, if someone had ulterior motives, Wang Xian would not only take his wealth but also let the dragon pool absorb his corpse.

Wang Xian, who was in a good mood, beckoned to Ling Zilin and the rest of the demonic beasts before flying towards the center of the city.

He wanted to see if there was any place where he could sell the resources he had as soon as possible.

When he arrived at the center of the hiring association, Wang Xian scanned his surroundings. After hesitating for a moment, he walked towards the holy item forging workshop.

He wanted to see the price of weapons recycled by the holy relic forging workshop!
