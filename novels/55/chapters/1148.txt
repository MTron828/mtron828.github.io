Translator: 5496903

As the winds blew and the clouds surged, the entire bright moon city became much livelier due to the appearance of the Dragon Assassin Group.

Currently, Bright Moon City already had many families and mercenary groups from other cities.

The undercurrent assassin group was a powerful organization that had shaken the star-moon kingdom for decades. Now that the son of the suspected undercurrent leader and the Ace Assassin Group had been assassinated by the Dragon Assassin Group, everyone could imagine that a bloody storm was about to begin.

And with the arrival of the dragon’s Thorn, although their assassination rules were very strange, many people were extremely moved.

“Patriarch, we’ve already received news from East Sea city that the Dragon’s thorn assassin organization has the strength to destroy a rank 9 transcendent. Once they accept a mission, there will be no failures that can be trusted!”

In a family clan in Bright Moon City, a middle-aged man reported to an old man in a low voice.

“Is the news true?”

“It’s 100% confirmed!”

“That’s Good!”

The old man’s eyes lit up. “The price of the undercurrent assassin group has always been relatively high. Since it’s only half the price of the undercurrent assassin group, let’s give it a try!”

“Yes, I’ll go deal with this matter right now!”

The middle-aged man nodded. His eyes flickered and he immediately walked out.

It wasn’t just this family. Many other families had started to take action as well.

They had very strong news and quickly received all the news regarding the dragon spike. Under everyone’s astonishment, they had a detailed understanding of the dragon Spike’s strength.

“Dragon King, the effect is very good. Up until now, we have received more than ten orders!”

A drakonid walked over and said to Wang Xian with a smile.

“Oh, is that so?”

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly. “Then let ao Yao and the rest prepare. We will start the Mission Tonight!”

“Yes, Dragon King. We will prepare to receive the deposit this afternoon!”

The drakonid nodded and walked out.

“Be careful of the retaliation from the undercurrent assassin organization!”

Feng Luan sat at the side and looked at a document. “I have a document on the undercurrent assassin organization. The leader of the undercurrent is an expert at the insightful void level. He should be at the first level of the insightful void level!”

“Don’t worry. I have already made preparations. With Ao Yao and the rest around, unless the leader of the undercurrent keeps an eye on the dragon spike, they will admit defeat sooner or later!”

Wang Xian revealed a confident expression.

Wang Xian had already made preparations in advance for the retaliation of the undercurrent assassin organization. In order to prevent the undercurrent assassin from killing the spies when they were getting the deposit, he had already sent a group of strange demons to protect these spies.

“Okay!”

Feng Luan nodded and didn’t say anything else.

From the information of the undercurrent assassin organization, the assassins they had couldn’t be compared to the dragon spike at all.

From what she knew, Dragon Spike already had forty top-tier assassins. They were existences that could assassinate transcendents at level nine.

The undercurrent could not be compared to them, even if their leader was at the profound void tier.

In the evening, the entire Bright Moon city was still bustling with activity. There was an endless stream of pedestrians on the streets.

A middle-aged man was walking on the streets. When he arrived in front of a stone platform, he moved his arm slightly and threw an interspatial ring onto it.

However, very soon, an old man walked over and directly took the interspatial ring away.

The middle-aged man looked at the old man, took out his communication stone plate and sent a message. Soon after, a smile appeared on his face.

This was the method to pay the deposit for the dragon spike. It was very safe, and no one would know.

However, there was a disadvantage to this. If the person who paid the deposit deliberately lured out the spy of the dragon spike, it would be very easy.

Back in Eastern Sea City, the guards of Eastern Sea City used this method to pull out the spy.

“Go over!”

On the busy street, an old man in a long robe looked at the position in front of him from a distance, and a cold voice came from his side.

The old man nodded slowly and walked straight to the agreed place.

When he walked to an empty chair, he put a cloth bag there and turned around to walk ten meters forward.

At this time, an old man walked over and opened the bag. He looked at the interspatial ring inside, checked the spirit stones inside, and calmly put them into his pocket.

After he was done, he walked toward a street with few people.

However, what the old man didn’t know was that two pairs of eyes were staring at him.

“Dragon Spike, how Dare You Kill Our Young Master? You’re dead for sure. The war between US has begun!”

A middle-aged man muttered as he walked towards the old man.

Following behind the old man, they walked for a few streets. The old man took out his communication stone plate to take a look, and his body trembled slightly.

He took a deep breath and walked towards a narrow path with almost no people.

When he entered, the eyes of the middle-aged man behind him flickered, and he sped up.

“Pu!”

A piercing sound rang out, and the old man jumped in fright. He quickly turned around and found that there was no one behind him. There were only traces of blood on the ground.

At this moment, the communication stone plate in his hand trembled again, and the old man hurriedly looked over.

“You’ve been discovered. Immediately head over here!”

There was an address on the communication stone plate, and he was told to take a detour and carefully walk over.

The old man’s heart trembled, and determination appeared in his eyes. He walked towards a safe place that the DRAKONID had prepared for him.

After walking for half an hour, the old man entered a room and heaved a heavy sigh of relief.

What the old man didn’t know was that a strange demon had been standing guard around him.

With the strange demon’s ability, he was almost 100% sure that no one was following him around.

The old man was safe.

...

“Damn it, damn it, where’s twelve? Twelve can’t be contacted!”

In a street, a middle-aged man holding a communication stone plate with an angry face roared in a low voice.

“This dragon spike was prepared. Twelve might be dead!”

The person-in-charge of the undercurrent assassin organization in Bright Moon City, the old man in white, said with a gloomy face.

“Sir, now we can’t even find the spy of the dragon spike. When the leader comes, we...”

The middle-aged man said with a pale face.

“With the help of City Lord Liu and the others, that spy can’t run away!”

The old man’s eyes flashed with a cold light. “Let’s go to the city Lord’s Mansion!”

“Yes, Sir!”

The two of them walked straight to the city Lord’s mansion. The city guards had already led them to a room.

Every city was monitored by a formation. As long as there was nothing above them, they could clearly see what was below.

In private areas, one was usually allowed to use a formation to block the city protection formation’s surveillance. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

However, this kind of surveillance was still extremely heaven-defying, unless one hid in a room and never came out.

“Found it. What a good dragon spike. It was actually prepared long ago!”
