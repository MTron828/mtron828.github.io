Translator: 5496903

Terrifying Energy condensed in front of holy sea town.

Within a radius of five kilometers, the black-red energy and the palm-sized blood bug-like energy slowly converged into the body of the leader of the blood barbaric demon beasts.

The Aura Rose, and the energy rose.

Within a radius of a hundred kilometers, it was as dazzling as a blazing meteorite!

Only an existence at the insightful void tier was able to release such power.

“He wants to break through. Attack! We can’t let him break through!”

Wang Xian’s expression changed drastically when he saw the leader of the Blood Barbarian demonic beast whose aura was constantly increasing. He hurriedly shouted.

“Roar!”

He let out an angry roar and flew over directly. The terrifying dragon tail flew towards the blood barbarian demonic beast with a piercing sound.

Boom

The immense force landed beside the leader of the Blood Barbarian Demonic Beast, but it was blocked by the dark red energy.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

The group of strange demonic beasts flickered with white light spots. However, when they were ten meters away from the blood barbarian demonic beast, they were blocked outside. They were completely unable to break through the defense outside.

“None of you can escape. All of you must die. All of you must die. hehehe!”

The Blood Barbarian demonic beast stared at Wang Xian and the rest and let out a horrified voice, “I will devour all of your blood and avenge my men!”

“Oh no!”

Wang Xian had a serious look on his face as his facial expression changed drastically.

He had attacked more than ten times consecutively, but the defense in front of the Blood Barbarian Demonic Beast did not budge at all. It could not be broken at all.

“We are in Big Trouble!”

Beads of cold sweat trickled down Wang Xian’s face. He hesitated for a moment before flying directly towards the city wall.

In front of the city gate, after the Golden Swordfish and the rest helped to kill the wandering sea demons, tens of thousands of sea demons were almost wiped out.

However, the people of Shenghai Town weren’t excited at all. They could also sense the terrifying scene in front of them.

The bloody and brutal aura had already reached them, making it difficult for them to breathe.

“What’s going on? Why is that bloody demonic beast emitting such a terrifying aura?”

“What happened? Could it be an accident?”

Everyone looked at the distant city wall and asked in astonishment.

Jin Qianyuan also looked up. His pupils contracted slightly as he had a bad feeling.

Wang Xian returned to his human form and flew to the city wall in a hurry.

“Sir Wang!”

“Commander Wang, What Happened?”

“That demonic beast... that demonic beast... why is it so terrifying!”

On the city wall, everyone saw him flying over and shouted loudly. When they saw Wang Xian’s embarrassed expression, they were shocked and asked fearfully.

“Boom!”

At this moment, a muffled sound came from the front.

“Oh my God, what is this?”

“That Demonic Beast... that demonic beast is about to break through!”

Everyone looked over immediately and suddenly realized that the sky in front of them had turned dark. The sky was not filled with dark clouds. Instead, it was covered by a terrifying dark energy.

Half of the sky was emitting a terrifying energy.

This dark energy was like a black cloud that was pressing down on the city. It was as if it wanted to completely destroy the town of Shenghai.

“That demonic beast is about to break through. It is about to break through the void interpretation!”

An old man could not help but exclaim in surprise.

His voice caused everyone to be dumbstruck. Their faces were filled with astonishment.

Everyone on the city wall had their eyes focused on Wang Xian. They wanted an answer.

Their eyes were filled with desire!

Just now, they had already experienced despair. It was Wang Xian who single-handedly defended against a group of terrifying demonic beasts.

Seeing that they were about to win and survive, a demonic beast was about to make a breakthrough.

Once it made a breakthrough, it would become an insightful void level existence.

An existence at the insightful void level was something that even Donghai city had to deal with with with all their might. How could they, Shenghai Town, fight against it?

Even if Lord Wang was here, they couldn’t see any hope.

“It... is going to break through!”

Jin Qianyuan’s voice was trembling. He stared into the distance, his eyes full of despair.

“What? A half-step profound void tier demon beast is going to break through? is the heaven going to destroy our holy sea town?”

“No, under Lord Wang’s leadership, we are about to succeed in defending the city. Damn the heavens, we are not resigned!”

“The heavens want us to die, hehehe, hehehe!”

When everyone around heard the mayor’s words, their faces revealed helplessness and anger.

Hope was right in front of them, but the heavens wanted them to die!

How could they deal with a Profound Void tier demonic beast?

“Boom Boom Boom!”

“Hehehe, humans in front, all of you will die in a moment!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, the energy in the distant sky was even more terrifying.

The dark energy that blocked half of the sky was poured directly into the head of the leader of the blood barbaric demonic beasts.

This time, the blood barbaric demonic beasts attacked the city for a large amount of fresh blood. They controlled the Beasts to attack the city so that they could absorb the blood of the dead beasts.

The fresh blood of humans could also be absorbed so that it could break through to the half-step void interpretation realm.

However, the appearance of Wang Xian had completely disrupted their plans.

“What a terrifying power!”

Everyone looked over in horror and despair.

The entire Shenghai town fell silent once again. This time, there was no panic or exclamations. There was only helplessness.

If the heavens wanted to destroy them, what could they do!

“Mayor Jin, get everyone to give me all the elixirs in their hands. There might be one last way!”

Wang Xian said to Jin Qianyuan with a sullen face.

“What? Commander Wang, you have another way?”

Jin Qianyuan was slightly taken aback. He quickly asked Wang Xian. The few people standing at the side also looked at him hopefully.

“If we have enough pills, we can avoid this crisis!”

Wang Xian said directly. He looked at the blood barbarian demonic beast that was breaking through and said, “We have to be quick. It’s about to break through!”

“Alright, Alright!”

Jin Qianyuan and the rest nodded their heads immediately.

Their bodies moved and they levitated into the sky, they immediately shouted loudly, “Everyone, take out all the pills in your hands. Commander Wang has a way to help everyone through this crisis. Hurry up, Hurry Up!”

“A way? We still have a way?”

“Commander Wang said that if he has a way, he definitely has a way. I believe in Commander Wang. These are all my medicinal pills!”

“In any case, nothing will belong to me after I die. Everyone, quickly take out the medicinal pills. I believe in Commander Wang!”

“We will naturally obey commander Wang’s words. Take out all of them!”

Everyone was slightly stunned. A faint light appeared in their eyes. They did not ask any further and immediately took out all of the medicinal pills.

They believed that if anyone could save them at this moment, only commander Wang would be able to do so.

They believed unconditionally.

“I wonder if it’s enough!”

Wang Xian looked at the items in the treasure vault in his mind and frowned slightly.

However, at this moment, there was only this last method.
