Chapter 1674: The Battle of 1674 had begun

“What’s going on? Didn’t the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop retreat?”

“What’s going on? Could it be that the two major forces are making a comeback?”

The entire volcano city was in an uproar. Everyone started to pack up their items with solemn expressions and quickly retreated into the flaming cloud mountain range.

Many people had already guessed the answer.

If they retreated into the fire cloud mountain range, the two great factions would most likely attack them.

It was very likely that the weapon master and medicine master would also attack this time!

“Elder Hui, the Clan Elder has sent a message saying that the two great factions, life and death, and the sacred relic, will attack us in Full Force Tomorrow Morning!”

“The clan elder has informed us not to leave for the time being and to wait for a suitable opportunity. When the time comes, we can immediately leave!”

In an incomparably luxurious manor in volcano city, four elders were gathered in a room. An elder spoke.

“When the time comes, what time?”

An elder frowned slightly.

They had come to support the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan this time. According to the clan’s orders, they only needed to temper themselves.

It was completely impossible for them to risk their lives for the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan.

Now that the two great forces had come to kill them, it was impossible for them not to risk their lives at this time.

“The clan elder didn’t say in detail. He only said that there would be an opportunity. When the time comes, we can just leave!”

“It’s possible. The medicine master, the weapon master, and our forefather secretly said it!”

The elder hesitated for a moment and guessed.

“Since the clan elder has said so, then nothing will happen. Tomorrow morning, we will act according to the circumstances!”

“I didn’t expect that the two great factions would actually go all out and fight to the death with the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan!”

The four elders spoke in slight shock.

“Sacred Fire clan members, please follow US and retreat to the fire cloud mountain range. We will have to trouble you for tomorrow’s Battle!”

An elder came to the sacred fire clan’s manor and directly shouted towards the inside.

“Haha, it’s no trouble at all. We will immediately retreat with you. I believe that even if the two great factions attack tomorrow, we will be able to hold them back outside!”

An elder frowned when he heard the voices outside. However, he laughed out loud as he spoke.

Everyone knew that the Sacred Fire clan owed the fire Lark clan a favor.

The reason why they came this time was also because of this favor.

If they didn’t return this favor, it would be a huge blow to the reputation of the Sacred Fire clan.

The title of being ungrateful would probably be placed on the Sacred Fire clan.

“What happened?”

Wang Xian stood at his residence in the fire cloud mountain range and looked at the city in front of him. When he heard the voice from there, he frowned slightly.

“Elder Huoguduo!”

Wang Xian called out softly to the side.

“Young master Wang, What are your orders?”

Soon, Elder Huoguduo appeared and asked Wang Xian immediately.

“What happened?”

Wang Xian pointed to the front and asked.

“Young master Wang, the weapon master and the medicine master have led all the experts and disciples to attack us!”

“They are expected to arrive here tomorrow morning. With the array formation of volcano city, it is impossible to defend against them. Therefore, all the disciples have to retreat to the fiery cloud mountain range!”

Elder Huoguduo said with a dark expression.

“The two longevity experts have personally led their subordinates to attack us!”

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly. The last thing he wanted to see had happened.

Currently, he was still some distance away from the realm of longevity.

Now that the two major forces were attacking them, the Fiery Cloud Sparrow clan would definitely be at a disadvantage. They could only rely on the fiery cloud mountain range to defend themselves.

“Why did the two major forces suddenly attack with all their might?”

Wang Xian frowned. His expression was a little ugly.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

Time passed slowly. When Wang Xian stood at the entrance for more than ten minutes, towering flames rose from the fire cloud mountain range.

The terrifying flames formed a defensive circle. The top of the mountain peak was filled with the fire cloud sparrow race’s experts and disciples.

The terrifying flames formed a natural barrier.

“These flames are equivalent to a natural formation. If the Army wants to rush over, they must destroy these flames!”

Wang Xian looked at the flame barrier and thought to himself.

“Tomorrow morning, the moment of life and death for us fire larks will come!”

“The army of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop, led by two longevity experts, will have a final battle with us!”

“Our Fire Cloud Sparrow clan is fearless. If they dare to come, we will kill them back!”

A voice filled with authority came from the center.

Wang Xian looked over. Feng Yun, who was dressed in a fiery red robe and holding a phoenix staff, was standing there. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Beside him, all the experts of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan were standing around him.

Each of their faces were filled with a strong fighting spirit.

“Some people say that we were the ones who clashed with the two great forces in the beginning. Some of these things, as the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan’s oldest and strongest expert, I can’t say!”

“But what I, Feng Yun, want to say is that the blood and lives of Our Fire Cloud Sparrow clan today are for our faith!”

“Tomorrow, regardless of whether we win or lose, we will fight to the death!”

“We are the fire cloud personal guards who once commanded the winds and clouds. We are the famous fire cloud on the transcendent continent!”

“Boom!”

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

A terrifying aura shot up from Feng Yun’s body towards the sky.

The fire cloud was in the sky as the fire cloud sparrow chirped.

Her face was filled with determination.

“Remember, we are the famous fire cloud personal guards. We are the famous fire cloud. Tomorrow, we will fight. Even if we die, we can not lose our name!”

A clan elder raised the flaming broadsword in his hand and shouted loudly.

“Fight, even if we die, we can not lose the prestige of our fire cloud!”

“Kill, we are the fire cloud personal guards. We are the famous fire cloud!”

The heroes were furious. On the fire cloud mountain range, there were more than ten million experts and disciples standing there.

They raised their hands with faces full of excitement. Their eyes were filled with a strong fighting spirit and killing intent!

They were the famous fire cloud guards!

They were the fire cloud guards that accompanied the great empress in establishing the Empire!

The fire cloud clan used to be so glorious. They fought for a million miles and were famous.

All the disciples of the Fire Cloud Clan took pride in joining the fire cloud personal guards.

Tomorrow, they would fight for the word fire cloud.

Even if they died, they could not let the prestige of the word be lost.

All the experts of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan had made preparations. What did the two great factions have to fear!

When the flames burned, they could burn the sky.

The entire sky exploded. An unprecedented fighting spirit filled the fire cloud mountain range.

All the experts of the Fire Cloud Sparrow stood in the center, their eyes fixed on the front, not moving at all.

On the surrounding mountain peaks, all the disciples of the Fire Cloud Sparrow also stood there quietly, holding their weapons tightly.

They were waiting for the arrival of the enemy!
