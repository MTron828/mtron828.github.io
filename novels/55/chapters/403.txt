Chapter 404: Guild Leader of the Sacred Followers Guild

There are still fifty dragonians in the Dragon Sect and if they are to grow stronger, they will be a force that could dominate the underworld.

In the sea, there were also around a hundred and thirty golden swordfish. Suppressing the forces in the sea region in the vicinity shouldn’t be a problem at all either.

It would take a huge amount of resources to level up the Dragon Palace. He would have to seize all resources available frantically for future developments.

The forces overseas are really strong?

Wang Xian’s lips curved into a faint smile. It would not be long before he led the members of the Dragon Palace into the international stage. It would be just like the present situation where those who were unwilling to submit would all be destroyed!

When the day arrives, perhaps no one will ever say the Chinese Underworld is weaker!

Wang Xian smiled as he plotted out his plans in his mind.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!

Suddenly, Wang Xian’s phone rang. He took a glance and realized it was Old Qin looking for him.

“Brother Wang Xian, where are you now?” the voice of Old Qin sounded from the other end of the phone the moment the call was connected.

“I’ll be returning to Rivertown soon. What’s the matter, Old Qin? Did something happen?” Wang Xian replied with a smile.

He had been keeping in contact with Old Qin and Old Xue all this while.

He had relied on their help to gather the materials required for the Dragon Palace.

“It’ll be the new year soon. Let’s find a time to have a gathering. Besides that, I would like to ask if Brother Wang Xian would be interested and have the time to attend a banquet for the wealthy and powerful families two days from now?” Old Qin smiled and asked Wang Xian.

“A gathering for the wealthy and powerful families?” Wang Xian was curious and asked, “What is the nature of the gathering?”

“All the influential figures, ancient martial artist families and the super-rich from the Southern Province will come together. This is a gathering of the super-rich and influential people. At that time, there will also be an auction. There should be some good stuff and things relating to the ancient martial arts circle wouldn’t be lacking!” answered Old Qin.

Hmm! “Alright. I’ll be in Rivertown tomorrow. At that time, let’s have a meetup at the First-grade Restaurant,” Wang Xian said heartily.

“Alright, alright!”

After chatting with Old Qin for some time, Wang returned to the living room in the yacht. Seeing that the girls were still excited and engrossed in their games, he went to the upper deck to take a break.

At night, Mo Qinglong steered the yacht towards Rivertown.

When dawn had just broken, the yacht stopped beside the villa.

The group alighted and headed towards the villa.

“Oh, my dear disciple! Is Brother Wang Xian around!”

Soon after, Sui Huang’s voice resonated in the villa. Beside him, there was a white-bearded old man.

The old man looked much shorter and smaller compared to Sui Huang. However, his eyes were bright and one could easily tell that he wasn’t ordinary.

He had white attire that wasn’t tainted in the least bit, and had an exceptional demeanor.

“Sui Huang, just come in!”

Wang Xian sat on the sofa while playing with the Heavenly Hound. The girls continued their mahjong game after getting addicted to it on the yacht.

Huh?

Wang Xian looked across and his attention fell on the old man in white attire. He squinted his eyes.

This was someone who was at the same level as Sui Huang.

From him, Wang Xian could sense the aura of a grandmaster. Even Sui Huang didn’t have the same aura.

While Wang Xian was observing the old man in white, the old man was also observing Wang Xian and the few people around him.

“Xiao Yu and Elder Fang have recovered?”

Sui Huang was shocked to see Xiao Yu and Elder Fang, who were playing mahjong.

“Old Sui, we have all recovered!” Xiao Yu and Elder Fang stood up immediately and replied joyously.

“Your strength!”

Sui Huang was shocked to feel the frightening energies emanating from Xiao Yu and Elder Fang.

Besides that, he also felt threatened by Lan Qingyue who was beside them.

This made him feel great disbelief.

He had inspected that horrifying venom personally a while back and found it to be extremely tricky. As such, he came to the conclusion that they had zero chance of recovery.

He had also consulted Old Huang, the number two on the World Miracle Doctors Chart. The response he got was “incurable” and Old Huang was helpless about the venom.

Yet, not only had they recovered, but their strength had also reached an incredible level.

At least the Inborn Realm! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“You little devil! You aren’t simple and must be hiding a lot of secrets!”

Sui Huang raised an eyebrow.

Beside him, the old man in white attire was shocked.

Everyone in the villa seemed insane to him.

Even the dog that was lying in one corner wasn’t simple.

In the entire villa, the one that gave him the strongest threat was that young man.

“All is well as long as they recover. All is well!”

Sui Huang smiled and looked at Wang Xian. “Let me introduce you. This is Old Huang, the Guild Leader of the Sacred Followers Guild and the strongest Miracle Doctor in China. Old Huang, there’s some misunderstanding that requires resolving.”

“Hello, Old Huang!” Wang Xian looked at the Guild Leader of the Sacred Clan and revealed a faint smile.

“Heroes often emerge when they are young! We have all aged!”

Old Huang looked at Wang Xian and exclaimed in surprise, “I have heard from Old Sui about the incident Brother Wang Xian had with the Sacred Followers Guild. Regarding this matter, I hope we can now put an end to it!”

“Alright. As long as the Sacred Followers Guild doesn’t offend me, I won’t go offend you guys!”

“Hehe! Offending this little brother has turned out to be extremely costly!” Old Huang laughed plainly.

“Naturally! If there’s anyone who targets me or my kin, my only option will be to kill all of them!”

Wang Xian wore a smile and illustrated a fact that was clear to him.

“In that case, this matter shall rest here. The Sacred Followers Guild won’t make things difficult for Brother Wang Xian in the future. I can give you my assurance on it. Old Huang, what do you think?”

Seeing the conversation between the two was getting confrontational, Sui Huang interrupted and attempted to mediate.

“Alright. I’m clear when it comes to right or wrong. My Sacred Followers Guild was at fault in this matter. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be here!” Old Huang replied frankly.

“In that case, I welcome your arrival. Please take a seat!”

Wang Xian smiled. The Guild Leader of the Sacred Followers Guild was still an upright person who clearly differentiated between right and wrong. Although it was difficult for them to become friends, they wouldn’t have to be enemies.

With Sui Huang in the middle, the three of them were able to have a friendly chat for several minutes.

Wang Xian consulted Old Huang as to whether he had any of that venom left. Old Huang responded by shaking his head.

This venom was obtained from a deep valley by an Elder. That Elder had also died from the venom.

Only a small amount was left in their treasure trove which was subsequently taken by Elder Feng.

After Sui Huang and Old Huang left, Wang Xian led a carefree life for an additional two days.

On the morning of the third day, he headed towards Flow City together with Old Qin and the rest.

The gathering of the super-rich was organized by the richest man in the Southern Province. He had invited all the rich people and families in the Southern Province. Basically, all those who were famous and influential would be turning up.

“The richest man of the Southern Province, Sun Kaian, could even make it to the richest man chart nationally. He has family assets worth hundreds of billions. Not only is he wealthy but he also has strong backing. There should be several hundreds of people turning up this time. However, with the name Brother Wang Xian has made for yourself, even Mogul Sun will have to show respect to you. Hehe.”
