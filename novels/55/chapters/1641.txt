Chapter 1642: 1642 stepped onto the stage of the mainland

“I want to get Duan Jinming to personally forge more than 100 defensive weapons at level eight of the Void Interpretation Stage!”

Feng Luan said to Wang Xian.

“HMM? Aren’t your people able to forge weapons at level eight of the Void Interpretation Stage?”

Wang Xian looked at Feng Luan curiously.

“It’s different. This time, it’s a large-scale weapon that can pierce through the weapons of a level seven void interpretation stage powerhouse!”

Feng Luan shook her head. “This kind of large-scale weapon is extremely complicated. Even a powerful forger from the fire Lark clan wouldn’t be able to forge it!”

“Duan Jinming’s forging standard is very strong. I want to find him to let him forge it.”

As she spoke, she passed a blueprint to Wang Xian.

“HMM? This kind of weapon?”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned. Looking at the large-scale weapon on the blueprint, a hint of surprise appeared on his face.

This weapon was similar to a huge siege weapon that involved a formation.

A huge weapon attack that could kill a seventh-level profound void martial artist was definitely a terrifying killing weapon.

However, with the abilities of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan and the Phoenix Phoenix clan, it was insufficient to forge this weapon.

It was too complicated and required a high level of forging.

The level of forging of the Phoenix Phoenix weapon was much lower than the level of alchemy.

“Defensive equipment. If there are too many of them, they can threaten the eighth level of the profound void tier. However, this kind of weapon is not used by the dragon-phoenix Empire but for the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan!”

Feng Luan said directly.

“What happened to the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan?”

Wang Xian asked Feng Luan.

“In the battle against the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop, the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan has always been at a disadvantage!”

“Right now, the fire lark clan can only passively defend.”

Feng Luan frowned and said slowly.

“Is that so? I’ll give the blueprint to Duan Jinming and see if he can forge it!”

Wang Xian revealed a hint of contemplation on his face and asked Prime Minister GUI to call Duan Jinming over.

“Sister Feng Luan!”

At this moment, a group of girls dressed luxuriously flew over from the bedroom.

Every girl was an existence that could topple countries and cities.

Especially their temperament. Even if they were called the empress, no one would object.

Each of them had a colorful charm.

“You guys still know that you have a sister like me!”

Feng Luan glanced at the group of girls and said in disdain.

“Hehe, of course I know!”

The group of girls blushed. Guan Shuqing immediately walked over and held her arm.

Thinking about the past six months, it was indeed a little crazy.

Especially in the beginning, it was very interesting. Even though Ling Jian ‘er, who was cultivating the heartless sword principle, had fallen in love with Wang Xian.

However, such a thing was something that she didn’t dare to imagine in the past.

However, there was a saying that went well. As time passed, love would develop.

As time passed, it became absurd and shameless.

“Dragon King!”

At this moment, at the entrance of the Dragon King’s palace, Duan Jinming walked over quickly and knelt on the ground.

“Jinming, Get Up!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and passed the blueprint directly to him. “Can you see if the weapon on it can be forged?”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Duan Jinming nodded immediately.

As a slave-like race, he had become a respected and revered member of the Fire Hammer clan. Duan Jinming knew that everything was because of the existence of the Dragon King.

“Sure, but with my speed, I can only forge one piece a day at most!”

Duan Jinming nodded.

“Alright, Feng Luan has the materials here. Forge it immediately!”

Wang Xian nodded.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Duan Jinming nodded immediately. He took the interspatial ring that Feng Luan gave him and left immediately.

“Feng Luan, Shu Qing, Qing Yue, you girls, I have something to tell you!”

Wang Xian watched as Duan Jinming left and looked at Feng Luan, Guan Shu Qing, and the other girls.

“Huh? What is it?”

The girls were stunned and looked at him in astonishment.

“I’m going to the fire Lark clan to head to the central continent!”

Wang Xian said directly.

The central continent was the center of the entire supernatural continent. There were five empires there.

There were powerful forces on the continent, terrifying sects, and families that had stood for a hundred thousand years.

It was an idea that Wang Xian came up with not long ago to head to the territory of the central continent.

Today, Feng Luan came over and talked about the fire lark clan. This made him completely certain.

Currently, he needed too many resources to upgrade his level.

To reach the fifth level of the Seethrough Void Tier, he would need to consume at least one year’s worth of resources accumulated by the Dragon Palace.

Moreover, he wouldn’t be able to live every day in his bedroom.

When it was time to fight, he knew how to fight.

The vast region had stabilized. In a year or two, the dragon-phoenix Empire and the Dragon Palace would be able to subdue and destroy the three superpowers.

When that time came, the vast region would be unified.

And he wouldn’t be able to stay in the Dragon Palace for a year or two.

Furthermore, the current Dragon Palace and the Dragon Phoenix Empire were not 100% stable.

The Life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop had always been a problem in their hearts.

With the strength of two mainland-level forces, even the Dragon Palace could be destroyed by them.

Therefore, Wang Xian had already had an idea and made some preparations.

“You want to go out?”

When the group of girls heard Wang Xian’s words, they cried out in surprise. All of them stared at him.

“Yeah, are you staying in the bedroom every day?”

Wang Xian smiled at the group of girls. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Then go, Go, hurry up and leave!”

“Pay attention to your safety. Just come back in a month or two!”

When the few girls saw his expression, they immediately waved their hands.

Wang Xian was speechless.

“Wang Xian, are you really going out?”

Feng Luan frowned and asked him.

“Yes, I’ve already thought of it. I’m going to the fire Lark clan!”

“I’m going to lead the strange demon clan to join the fire Lark clan in the battle with the two major forces. It’s best if I can destroy them!”

As Wang Xian spoke, a cold glint flashed across his eyes.

It had always been the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop who wanted to destroy them.

This time, he was prepared to take the initiative to make a move!

He was going to the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan to deal with two continent-level forces.

“You want to participate in this war? This war has experts at the ninth rank of the void interpretation realm and the half-step longevity realm making a move?”

Feng Luan frowned and reminded him.

“Don’t worry, unless the longevity realm makes a move, the half-step longevity realm won’t be able to stop me!”

“The fire Lark clan should be in a great disadvantage now. If I go over, I can help them a little. Moreover, only by killing strong enemies will I be able to obtain more resources!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled.

“Even if they are injured, it won’t be a loss if I can obtain a portion of the resources ahead of Time!”

Wang Xian looked at them and continued.

“Xiao Xian, have you really made up your mind?”

Guan Shuqing and the other girls looked at him and asked with a frown.

“I’ve made up my mind. We will set off in the next two days!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

When it was time for a man to fight, he had to fight. It was only then that he took the first solid step on the journey to the transcendental continent.

The following journey would be the true stage of the transcendental continent.

They would compete with the Continental forces that had existed for tens of thousands of years!

Contending with powerful and brilliant sects!

Contending with invincible empires for hegemony!
