Chapter 2943: easily swept through the glazed domain

“Many thanks to the sacred master of the sacred region. Many thanks to the stars that you have prepared here.”

At the border between the sacred region and the glazed domain, the first Supreme Elder, Divine Emperor Shangshui, and a few other divine emperors led a group of people to rush over to the sacred region in advance.

As their gazes swept across the stars that the sacred region had prepared in advance, the first Supreme Elder and the others had grateful expressions on their faces.

“The calamity of glaze is also the calamity of our sacred region. There’s no need for eastern fire divine emperor to be so courteous when it comes to the calamity of the resplendent starry skies.”

!!

Sacred Master shook his head. He looked towards the void in front of him as his heart trembled slightly.

Sacred Master was also worried. If Yaoxie were to attack, what would their sacred region do?

If even the glazed region was not a match for him, their sacred region was even less of a match for him!

“Divine Emperor East Fire, let’s establish a battle line here!”

Sacred Master hesitated for a moment before speaking.

Establishing a battle line was also a line of defense. This was also for the invasion of the demonic beasts.

“Yes, we can’t contact the Dragon King Now. The situation in the dragon palace might not be optimistic either. The sacred domain is the last line of defense. Once the demonic beasts invade, we must stop them here. Otherwise…”

The Grand Supreme Elder didn’t finish his words, but everyone could realize the seriousness of the problem.

If they couldn’t stop them outside the Holy Region, then the human disaster would come.

Where could they escape to then?

“I’ll order the disciples of the Holy Region to prepare now. The hundreds of millions of years of peace is about to be broken!”

The holy master sighed slightly, moved his body, and immediately disappeared.

Soon, the news about the glazed area spread throughout the entire holy region, causing a huge commotion.

Especially when they learned that there was no news about the Dragon Palace conquering the machine imperial region for half a year, it caused a huge commotion.

The entire holy region began to discuss.

The holy region was located at the border of the glazed area and began to establish a large-scale battle line.

The battle line stretched for tens of billions of kilometers, and the soldiers of the saint domain rushed over with solemn expressions.

In the void in front of the battle line, the fleeing army of the citizens of the glazed domain was also moving at high speed.

In the middle of the starry sky, the glazed domain would occasionally leave behind a planet with a teleportation array set up.

Some people were left on the planet to guard the surrounding void. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The domain Lord was heavily injured. No one had the ability to go to the Demonic Beast Army to investigate the situation.

They could only use this method.

Once the invasion arrived, they would immediately send a message, and the guards would be able to escape directly from the teleportation array.

A month slowly passed. The battle lines over at the Holy Region had already been set up.

Some of the glazed domain’s divine emperors led planets and citizens to rush over one after another.

However, compared to the citizens of the entire glazed domain, only one-sixth of them had arrived. Most of them were still on their way.

“Sigh, who would have thought that today would come? Yaoxie of the chimei domain has forced us to this extent!”

“Yeah, I heard that the domain Lord was heavily injured. We had no choice but to retreat to the Holy Domain.”

“It’s still alright if we retreat to the Holy Domain. At the very least, we can still survive. Once Yaoxie continues to pursue us, who knows how many people will die!”

“If the Dragon Palace doesn’t conquer the machine imperial region, how many people will there be? If we join forces with the Dragon Palace, there might still be a glimmer of hope.”

“The Dragon Palace is still too careless!”

On the tower located on the planet at the border of the glazed domain, four glazed domain godly monarch experts stood there vigilantly in front of them.

They had been standing there for more than a month. Looking at the slightly desolate starry sky, their hearts were filled with bitterness.

Now, they no longer hoped to reclaim their glazed domain. They only hoped that Yaoxie would not pursue them and invade the holy region.

“Wu Wu Wu!”

At this moment, a special sound was heard.

“What’s that sound?”

One of the godly monarch experts’ears twitched as he asked in astonishment.

“Captain, to your right, look to your right quickly. Not Good, not good!”

Suddenly, the middle-aged man on the right let out a terrified roar.

The other three turned their heads at the same time and looked to their right.

“Hiss, that’s… That’s the demon cave!”

“They’re attacking us! That group of Demonic Beasts is attacking us! How can they be so fast! ?”

“This is bad! We have to report the situation here to Lord God Emperor and the others!”

The four god King Experts’expressions changed drastically as they immediately shouted.

They hurriedly took out their communication stone plates and transmitted the news over.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

At this moment, violent roars were transmitted from the Dark Demon Cave. The four people’s hearts trembled slightly.

In the void in front of them on the right, there were two incomparably huge demon caves that were like hell. Each of the caves was over a hundred million kilometers in size.

From time to time, pairs of blood-red eyes could be seen. They were filled with shock.

“The speed of that demon cave is terrifying. Let’s quickly escape through the teleportation formation!”

The four of them saw the demon cave flying towards them at a high speed. Their expressions changed drastically. They immediately went to the teleportation formation at the side.

“Buzz Buzz Buzz!”

The four of them moved and instantly disappeared from the planet.

“Roar, Roar, Roar!”

After the four of them disappeared, the demon cave continued to fly towards them at a terrifying speed.

In less than a minute, they arrived in front of the planet.

One of the demon caves actually headed straight towards that planet to devour it.

“Rumble!”

The incomparably huge planet was slowly devoured into the demon cave.

Very quickly, loud roars came from within the demon cave.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

Not long after, a roar filled with displeasure came from within.

The two demon lairs stopped in the void for a few minutes before quickly flying in the direction of the sacred region.

“Not good. News has come from the borders of our glazed domain. The two demon lairs have appeared. It is very likely that they will chase after us.”

Very quickly, the news from this side was quickly transmitted to all the god emperors of the glazed domain.

In the vast void, the god Emperors, who were still flying towards the sacred domain with their star divine nation, narrowed their eyes. Their expressions were extremely ugly.

“Our glazed domain has fallen. Two devil dens have appeared where we escaped. I wonder if they will invade us!”

At the sacred battlefield, the first Supreme Elder received the news. His expression changed drastically as he clenched his fists tightly.

The saint-level saint-level masters at the side were also a little nervous.

Even if the two great devil dens invaded, it would still be a bitter war for them.

“I hope that they have occupied the glazed domain, so they won’t continue to invade!”

A few God emperors said with embarrassed expressions.

They wouldn’t be able to resist the invasion.

“Once they come, we have to be prepared to risk our lives!”

The Grand Elder said, his eyes shining.

He had a bad premonition.

The demons of the chimei territory used all kinds of treasures and life as food. Although their glazed area had been invaded, almost everyone had escaped and all the treasures had been taken away.

In the glazed area where there were no humans to feed on and no treasures to feed on, the demons might pursue and kill humans.
