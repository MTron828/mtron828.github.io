2628 2628 Moon Bay

“Eh? What is it?”

Wang Xian’s curiosity was piqued by the exclamations. He raised his eyebrows and walked forward!

“What treasures have appeared again? There were several treasures yesterday, and now there are more treasures?”

In the surrounding area, there were also people who heard the exclamations in front of them and walked forward in bewilderment!

The exchange meeting had started yesterday. Yesterday, a treasure that shocked everyone had appeared!

From the looks of it, another treasure had appeared!

“There are so many godly monarchs. Many of them are old monsters that have lived for millions of years. It’s normal to have some treasures!”

Wang Xian mumbled as he walked towards a pavilion in front of him!

Buzz

When he walked over, an old man was floating at a height of five meters in front of him. His gaze swept across everyone around him!

The old man was at level four immortal King Realm and was not very strong!

Beside him, there was something strange!

It was an irregular stone plate. The stone plate was emitting a faint green glow and an incomparably huge life force was lingering around it!

The stone plate was five meters long, and there were some cracks on it. It was obviously destroyed!

The entire stone plate gave people an extremely ancient feeling, like a stone that had been in the void for a long time!

“Everyone, I am a disciple of the Dragon Python group. Over a million years ago, I obtained a treasure, and it was this treasure that brought me back from the dead many times!”

“According to the information of the treasure, this treasure is called the ancient Lake Moon Bay, a legendary treasure of the Pinnacle Race of the universe, the Elf race!”

“This item, right now the Moon essence in the ancient Moon Bay has been used up, it can use up a large amount of plant type god seeds to condense the moon essence, this essence can instantly heal injuries!”

“Even if there is no essence in it now, in the god country, it can double the recovery rate!”

The elder from the Dragon Python group introduced it to everyone!

“The Moon Bay of the Elf Race?”

“The treasure of the Pinnacle Race of the Universe? Is this real?”

“From the Moon Bay of the ancient lake, I can really sense a huge amount of vitality. This vitality is too strong!”

“But this Moon Bay of the ancient lake seems to have been broken!”

“The elf race, the legendary race, is this Moon Bay of the ancient lake real or fake?”

Shocked voices resounded, many people around were looking at the ancient lake passionately!

“Name a price!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

A wood type undying undying stared at Moon Bay passionately, immediately speaking!

“Right, name a price, how many abyss seeds are there to be auctioned off or something you’re prepared to trade!”

A few other wood type warriors beside said passionately!

From within the ancient Lake Moon Bay, they could feel a powerful life force, this was extremely beneficial to their training!

“Bartering, I need a god sword, whichever one agrees with me, whichever one is the strongest, I will trade with them!”

The old man immediately said!

“God Sword!”

The surrounding crowd heard his words and raised their eyebrows!

“I have a blade here!”

“I have one here, it’s just right for an undying level 4 warrior to use!”

“I have one here, this blade is made from the star core, it’s worth a city!”

Regarding the ancient Lake Moon Bay, many people were excited, immediately taking out their godly blades!

The old man floated in mid air, looking at the blades, he frowned slightly and didn’t speak, obviously from his point of view, these blades weren’t worth the trade!

“Ancient Lake Moon Bay?”

“The peak race of the universe, the Elf Race?”

Wang Xian walked over and looked at the treasures beside the old man. A look of astonishment flashed across his eyes!

The Elf race was one of the peak races in the universe. They had two most powerful treasures!

One was the tree of life, and the other was the Moon Bay!

The tree of life was even more precious than the divine parasol tree. According to the introduction in the Divine Dragon Inheritance, there was only one tree of life. It was the Guardian Divine Tree of the Elf race!

The Moon Bay was a treasure that was attached to the tree of Life!

The Moon Bay could quickly restore the life force of the Elven tribe. Even if there was only a drop of blood left, it could be restored to its peak by soaking in the Moon Bay!

It could be restored to its peak very quickly. It didn’t require a long time to cultivate and recover!

The Tree of life and the Moon Bay were the reliance of the Elven tribe!

There was actually a treasure like the Moon Bay Here?

Wang Xian stared at the ancient lake, the Moon Bay, and the system notification rang!

“It really is the ancient lake, the Moon Bay, of the elves, even if it’s slightly damaged!”

...

Wang Xian was slightly shocked. He stared at it intently and his mind was directed towards the Moon Bay!

“This aura is somewhat close to the ancestral tree!”

Wang Xian mumbled. The Moon Bay was a half-living item of the tree of life. It was one of the two greatest treasures of the Elves!

“I wonder if the Moon Bay will undergo any changes when it is placed next to the ancestral tree?”

Wang Xian thought to himself!

“Eh? Another Ultimate Treasure appeared?”

“Young commander, I heard that it is the ultimate treasure of the ELF race. Although it is slightly damaged, it is still valuable!”

At this moment, a middle-aged man and an elder walked over from the back. The middle-aged man looked forward with a curious expression!

“A treasure of the elf race?”

The middle-aged man paused for a moment before he immediately walked forward!

“This boundless life force is definitely a rare treasure for wood-elemental godly monarchs!”

...

The middle-aged man’s expression changed slightly when he sensed the aura above Moon Bay!

He was a wood-elemental cultivator, so Moon Bay had a fatal attraction for him!

“It’s indeed a true treasure, especially a wood element cultivator’s true treasure!”

The old man next to him was slightly shocked, and he stared at Moon Bay!

“Only trading godly swords? I’m determined to get this treasure!”

The middle-aged man’s eyes were filled with determination. Without any hesitation, he took out a godly sword!

“I’ll trade this godly sword for it!”

He raised the sword in his hand and said loudly!

“Huh? The moonlight last month was him!”

“He wants Moon Bay Too? Many people in the great sect last month are wood element cultivators. Moon Bay is indeed a treasure for the powerhouses last month!”

“The moonlight last month made a move. It’s going to be difficult to fight for it now!”

“This isn’t an auction. It’s just a barter. That person from the Dragon Python group might not be interested in the divine sword in his hand!”

Some of the people around were slightly shocked when they saw the middle-aged man, and they whispered among themselves!

Obviously, this moonlight belonged to the most influential person on the Demon Island!

The old man from the Dragon Python group looked over and landed his gaze on the divine sword. A glint flashed in his eyes, but he still did not immediately agree!

The value of the sword in Moon Bay was not enough!

“I have a sword here. It’s called the Dragon Blood Sword. The Divine Dragon Bone is the body and the Divine Dragon Blood is the soul. It can be used to forge the dragon blood sword. Similarly, it can be considered as a treasure!”

Wang Xian looked at the divine sword that the middle-aged man took out. He looked at the treasures in his mother nest and took out the dragon blood sword!
