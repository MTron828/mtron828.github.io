2610 2610 took in a disciple

“Dragon King, Senior... i. . . I want to acknowledge you as my master!”

Bei Shuang’s body trembled as she walked forward and knelt on the ground. Her gaze was filled with determination as she looked at Wang Xian!

She suddenly walked out and knelt on the ground, wanting to acknowledge him as her master. This caused everyone in the hall to be slightly shocked. Their faces were filled with shock!

When the experts from the North Gate Immortal dynasty saw this sudden scene, their expressions changed!

“Bei Shuang, get up, what are you doing!”

The north gate emperor saw that she was about to acknowledge the Dragon King as her master, his expression changed and he shouted immediately!

The North Gate Emperor was stunned and shocked at this girl who was sent here by the North River sect and was once as dazzling as a meteor!

Their north gate undyings had been founded by a few disciples of the North River sect who had made mistakes. After their rise, even though they weren’t affiliated with the North River sect, they were still connected to the north gate undyings!

A month ago, an elder of the Bei Chuan sect had sent a lady to their place, ordering the guards to stop her from leaving their territory!

The North Gate Undying Dynasty naturally couldn’t reject her!

They naturally knew about this once dazzling and invincible heaven’s favored Lady!

Back then, her radiance was boundless, she had even attracted the attention of the imperial court. Even the strongest son of God of the imperial court had asked the Patriarch to decide on a marriage!

However, she vanished like a shooting star. Tens of thousands of years had passed, and she finally became an ordinary cultivator!

Now, she actually wanted to acknowledge the Dragon King as her master. What was going on?

The northern gate emperor was stunned and embarrassed at the same time!

“What a coincidence!”

Wang Xian looked at the girl kneeling in front of him and said indifferently!

He had seen this girl more than a month ago. He was really shocked by her origin body, Wang Xian!

Back then, the woman wanted to acknowledge him as her master, but he didn’t agree to it!

Now, it was such a coincidence that they met again within a month!

Fate?

He smiled gently!

“Dragon King, I will never forget the kindness of giving you pointers back then. Please accept me as your disciple!”

Bei Shuang immediately knelt on the ground and kowtowed. She clenched her fists and spoke!

Wang Xian looked at her with a hesitant expression!

A body of frost origin was indeed rare, but he didn’t want to take in a disciple either!

“Get up. I’m not ready to take in a disciple for the time being. With your talent, just focus on your cultivation!”

Wang Xian waved his hand and ordered her to stand up!

“Dragon King... am I not qualified? I want to take you as my master!”

Bei Shuang’s expression changed slightly. Her eyes were slightly red as she looked at Wang Xian and begged!

“It’s too troublesome to accept a disciple. I’m not going to accept a disciple!”

Wang Xian shook his head!

“Bei Shuang, come here!”

“Sister bei Shuang!”

When the emperor of the northern gate saw that bei Shuang had actually met the Dragon King, he was slightly surprised. When he saw that the Dragon King had rejected him, he immediately shouted at her!

The girl at the back also walked over and grabbed her arm!

Bei Shuang gritted her teeth and walked to the back with her head lowered!

“Dragon King, I’m really sorry. Our disciple from the north gate has lost his composure!”

The Emperor of the north gate hurriedly apologized to Wang Xian!

“It’s Alright!”

Wang Xian waved his hand nonchalantly. He was rather impressed by a tough girl!

Following that, the various factions handed over their treasures and chatted enthusiastically!

They were unsure of the exact strength of the Dragon Palace. However, there were more than ten level 7 immortal king powerhouses following the Dragon King today!

With such strength, no faction in the southern star system would be a match for the Dragon Palace!

Wang Xian chatted with them for more than an hour. After having lunch, he left immediately!

When the other factions saw that the Dragon King was so easy to talk to, they heaved a sigh of relief!

“Sister bei Shuang, where are you going?”

After the banquet ended, bei Shuang walked out of the palace and immediately flew towards the east!

The girl beside her was slightly shocked and immediately shouted at her!

Bei Shuang didn’t say anything and flew straight ahead!

“Go follow her!”

The emperor of the north gate frowned slightly and ordered a powerhouse beside him helplessly!

“It’s the Emperor!”

...

An immortal god King immediately followed behind!

“TSK Tsk Tsk, our Great Dragon King is in luck with women again. There’s a beauty outside kneeling above the Dragon Star Dragon Palace to acknowledge him as her master!”

Not long after, in the Dragon King Palace located in the main Dragon Palace, di Xing ‘er walked over and teased Wang Xian!

“Huh?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows!

“Dragon King, the lady from the North Gate Immortal dynasty is kneeling above the Dragon Star Dragon Palace today. She wishes to acknowledge you as her Master!”

At this moment, Prime Minister Gui who was following behind reported!

“Little Xian, do you know that Lady?”

Tang Yinxuan, who was beside the Empress Star, asked curiously!

“I gave her some pointers once!”

Wang Xian nodded his head!

...

“TSK TSK, I’ve already decided on you after giving her some pointers once. Lord Dragon King is really charming!”

The Empress Star continued to mock him!

“Her talent is much better than yours. She has a body of frost origin. As long as she has the cultivation method, she will definitely be a powerhouse at the peak of the universe in the future!”

Wang Xian looked at di Xingnu and said speechlessly!

“HMPH, so you’re saying that I’m inferior to her?”

Di Xingnu said with some dissatisfaction!

“We’re not on the same level!”

Wang Xian hit her mercilessly!

“HMPH, who are you looking down on!”

Di Xingnu curled her lips and glared at him with displeasure!

“Sigh, you’re already so old and have yet to reach the godly king realm. Who Do you think I’m looking down on!”

Wang Xian smiled!

“Alright, Little Xian, don’t be angry with the star Lady!”

Tang Yinxuan interrupted him with a smile and asked, “Are you going to take her in as your disciple?”

Tang Yinxuan knew a little about the body of origin. The strongest constitution in the universe, the body of ice, was even stronger than the Constitution of ordinary attributes!

“I didn’t expect that there would be people who would kneel outside just to acknowledge me as their master!”

Wang Xian smiled and looked at Prime Minister Gui. “Bring him to the Dragon Star Dragon Palace. I’ll make a trip there!”

As he spoke, he moved and teleported to the Dragon Star Dragon Palace!

“Let’s go to yinxuan. Let’s go and take a look to prevent him from having any unspoken rules!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The Empress followed behind with great interest!

“Master, you... you are willing to accept me as your disciple?”

In the Dragon Star Dragon Palace, when bei Shuang was brought to the Dragon Palace, she saw Wang Xian and asked excitedly!

“Since you are so sincere, just accept him. You have a senior brother. Of course, he is much younger than you. He is only in his thirties and is not here right now. I will bring him over in a while!”

“I will bring you to the main Dragon Palace later and train hard. First, raise your strength to level four or five of the immortal king. You have a deep foundation. There shouldn’t be any obstacles before level four or five. Everything will be fine!”

Wang Xian said to her!

This made the female Emperor Star, who had just entered, gape slightly. Casually raising her strength to level four or five, she was still far away from the Immortal King!

This guy was so powerful just by taking in a random female disciple?

“Thank you, master, Thank You!”

At the side, bei Shuang was so excited that she wanted to kneel down to Wang Xian. However, he stopped her with his energy!
