2630 2630? You Don’t deserve to be the master of the goddess of Frost

“Huh?”

Everyone was stunned when they heard Wang Xian’s words!

The elder and Yue Xingguang from the great sect of last month were stunned as well. Their expressions were a little ugly!

“What do you take our great sect of last month as?”

Yue Xingguang stared at Wang Xian coldly and said!

“Little brother, this exchange meeting was organized by our great sect of last month. Please don’t slander our great sect of last month!”

The elder of the great sect last month also spoke in a deep voice!

“Hehe, then I’ll tell you again. I Won’t sell Moon Bay and I won’t trade. You guys shouldn’t keep buying it again and again!”

Wang Xian sneered and said to the few people from the great sect last month!

“If you don’t want to sell it, we won’t let you sell it by force!”

The elder of the great sect last month stared at Wang Xian with a hint of displeasure in his eyes as he spoke coldly!

“This...”

When the surrounding people saw this scene, they were slightly silent and didn’t dare to say anything!

They didn’t dare to speak recklessly about the incident of the great sect last month!

“Master, what happened?”

At this moment, a voice suddenly came from the side. The valiant-looking bei Shuang, who was dressed in plain clothes and had short hair, walked towards Wang Xian!

She looked around and her gaze landed on Wang Xian, who was in the center!

“That is? Goddess of Frost!”

“Master? Goddess of Frost addressed that young man as her Master?”

“Could this young man be goddess of Frost’s master?”

Bei Shuang’s sudden arrival stunned everyone around her. They looked at her in astonishment!

Goddess of Frost was now a hot potato in the entire demon island!

A group of powerhouses from various factions even went to pay a visit to goddess of Frost!

Over a year ago, the frost goddess hadn’t reached the god King level yet, yet in just two years, she had the strength of an undying god King Level 8!

Such a terrifying improvement, it was even more shocking than the 30,000 years back when she suppressed the same era!

If 30,000 years ago, she was suppressing the same era’s youth, then now she was suppressing the entire Demon Island!

The returning goddess of ice, therefore, no one doubted if she could become the strongest person in this region!

The title of being an Emperor had already been secretly acknowledged by everyone!

“It’s nothing, just some small matters!”

Wang Xian looked at bei Shuang and shook his head indifferently!

“You... you are bei Shuang’s Master?”

When Yue Xingguang saw this scene, her expression changed as she stared at Wang Xian!

Wang Xian glanced at him and ignored him!

Bei Shuang also glanced at him coldly!

“You...”

When he saw that Wang Xian ignored him, Yue Xingguang’s expression turned slightly awkward!

“The leader of a small faction is qualified to be the master of the goddess of Frost?”

Yue Xingguang stared at Wang Xian with slight mockery!

“Shut up. Is this how you guys taught your disciples last month?”

As soon as he finished speaking, bei Shuang’s expression turned cold. An incomparably cold, freezing air instantly filled the surroundings as he stared coldly at the elders of the great sect!

“Oh?”

Last month’s great sect elder’s expression changed drastically when he saw bei Shuang’s reaction. Yue Xingguang’s face turned pale as well!

The surrounding experts’breathing froze as they stared blankly at the side!

“Hu!”

Last month, the great sect elder took a deep breath, and his expression changed. He looked at Yue Xingguang and said, “Little Guang, quickly apologize to the goddess of Frost!”

“I...”

Yue Xingguang’s expression was extremely unsightly, and he opened his mouth!

“Apologize!”

Last month, the great sect elder’s voice became heavier, and he shouted coldly!

“Goddess of Frost, I’m Sorry!”

He gritted his teeth and said with his head lowered!

“You should apologize to my master!”

Bei Shuang stared at him coldly!

...

“Ignore him. He’s just a petty thief!”

Wang Xian looked at bei Shuang and said indifferently. Then, he turned around and walked out!

It was already a pleasant surprise to obtain a Moon Bay. There was no need to stay here any longer!

Bei Shuang looked at Yue Xingguang coldly and followed Wang Xian out!

“Little Brat?”

When Yue Xingguang heard Wang Xian’s words, she clenched her fists tightly!

“Little Guang, don’t cause trouble. Don’t offend the goddess of Frost!”

At this moment, a voice sounded in his mind. His body trembled and he nodded his head!

The goddess of Frost was now a powerhouse that had grown up!

With the strength of an immortal King Level 8, it would be extremely difficult for even the great sect of the last month to kill her. After all, she could return to her divine kingdom in an instant!

The moment she couldn’t kill him the first time, she would have to wait for the revenge of a genius with monstrous talent!

...

The great sect from last month didn’t dare to gamble, it wasn’t worth it!

“Hiss, the frost goddess seems to respect her master so much, she actually protects him so much!”

“How can I not respect her? One must know that the frost goddess has been silent for over 30,000 years. Without her master, she would still be in a corner!”

“This is the luck of the goddess of frost. To be able to meet a master who possesses the frost cultivation method is also the luck of that master of hers. She is the leader of a small faction. In the future, with the relationship of the goddess of Frost, who would dare to offend her? Even some big sects have to give some face to her!”

Some people whispered when they saw them leave!

As for Wang Xian, he could be considered to have walked into the eyes of all the factions!

As the Master of the goddess of Frost, he had entered the eyes of everyone!

“Master, did you obtain any treasures from the place just now?”

After flying out of the inviting moon planet, bei Shuang asked him!

“My Luck is pretty good. It should be very useful to obtain a treasure!”

Wang Xian smiled and nodded. After chatting with bei Shuang for a while, he returned to the main Dragon Palace!

“The Moon Bay in the ancient lake is the ultimate treasure of the elves. It’s definitely extraordinary!”

“This moon bay is already somewhat damaged. I wonder if it can be repaired under the ancestral tree!”

Wang Xian came to the Dragon King’s palace and walked to the front of the Dragon Throne!

The ancestral tree was now 500 meters tall. Its branches were lush and full of vitality!

There were fruits on it!

“I wonder if this ancestral tree can be compared to the tree of life of the Elves!”

He mumbled. The Tree of life was known as the number one divine tree in the universe. He wondered how it could be compared to the ancestral tree!

Wang Xian felt that with the mystical powers of the ancestral tree, it was possible for it to be on top of the Tree of Life!

He waved his arm and placed the ancient lake, Moon Bay, on the right side of the Dragon Throne!

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

When the Moon Bay landed below the ancestral tree, the entire ancient pond trembled slightly!

A gush of green light floated out from it and connected to the ancestral tree!

Splash

On the ancestral tree, a branch and leaf slowly landed in the Moon Bay!

“There are indeed changes, but I still can’t see it now!”

Wang Xian looked at the Ancient Pond Moon Bay with a smile on his face! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“I wonder if the Moon essence will be produced!”

He mumbled and observed for a while. He found that the crack in the Moon Bay was recovering at a very slow speed!

“It should take some time!”

Wang Xian smiled and ignored it. He returned to the Dragon Peak on the Demon Island!
