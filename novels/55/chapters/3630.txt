3631 The power of the 3630 Dragon Palaces, the 14 great dragon palaces!

“All Dragon Kings, please take a seat!”

Wang Xian looked at the 13 dragon kings who were standing respectfully below and congratulated them. A smile appeared on his face!

He gestured at them with a smile on his face!

“We don’t dare. The current divine dragon lineage will have you as their king. We don’t dare to call ourselves Kings!”

The water god Dragon King who was in the middle bowed his hands and spoke with unusual respect!

Yes, they respected the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace very much!

The Dragon King’s battle record and the strength of the Dragon Palace didn’t allow them to offend him!

They had witnessed the rise of the Dragon Palace with their own eyes!

They had witnessed the Dragon Palace kill their way to this position step by step!

Especially the current Dragon Palace, which was called the strongest existence below the peak race!

This made them a little proud!

This was the hope of their Divine Dragon Clan. Moreover, this hope was very, very great! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

They also believed that it wouldn’t be long before the Dragon King would lead them to the ranks of the top races in the universe!

This was their lifelong wish. At the same time, it was also the greatest wish of their former leader!

“Thank you for Your Trust. You are willing to join our Dragon Palace and you are willing to call me king. However, once you join the Dragon Palace, you will join the Purebred Divine Dragon Tribe of the Dragon Palace. Similarly, all the disciples of the ancestral dragon lineage will join the various departments of the Dragon Palace.”

Wang Xian looked at them and said!

“We will naturally listen to your instructions, Dragon King!”

The thirteen dragon kings of the ancestral dragon tribe naturally had no objections.

Before they came, they had already thought of everything!

“Alright, then we welcome all the strong disciples of the ancestral dragon tribe to join us. Let the last divine dragons and dragon species of our Divine Dragon tribe roar once again in the starry sea and regain the might of the peak race!”

Wang Xian was also slightly excited about the joining of the ancestral dragon lineage!

The heritage of the ancestral dragon lineage was very deep, and the number of strong disciples was huge!

With their joining, the Dragon Palace would be able to receive a decent upgrade!

Of course, the most important upgrade was the heritage of the Dragon Palace and the number of disciples of the Dragon Palace!

Currently, the number of disciples of the Dragon Palace was less than two million. With the joining of the disciples of the ancestral dragon lineage, this number could reach around eight million!

Eight million was not a lot for a race. It could even be said to be very little!

Any peak race had tens of millions of disciples!

These tens of millions were the number of core disciples.

They did not count the number of ordinary strong disciples in the logistics department!

The increase in the number of disciples in the Dragon Palace could make the Dragon Palace even more full of vitality!

After all, the most important thing for the development of a race was reproduction!

As the number increased, the chances of a great being being born would increase!

Currently, the Dragon Palace didn’t have the ability to create a universe ruler.

And for a Pinnacle Universe Knight to break through to the universe ruler realm, the chances were very small!

Even for a pinnacle race, there was only a 10% chance!

“Regaining the power of a peak race will make our Divine Dragon Race Roar once again!”

The 13 experts of the ancestral dragon lineage also roared with excitement and excitement!

“Prime Minister Gui, send the experts of the Dragon Palace to help the ancestral dragon lineage migrate!”

Wang Xian looked at them with a smile and instructed Prime Minister Gui!

“Yes!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded and looked at the 13 future experts of the Dragon Palace. He smiled and said, “Everyone, let’s go. Move Your Dragon Palace to the Dragon Palace. We will create the glory of the Divine Dragon tribe together!”

“Yes, Prime Minister Gui, please take care of us in the future!”

The thirteen experts naturally knew Prime Minister Gui’s position in the Dragon Palace. He was the head butler of the Dragon Palace other than the Dragon King and the Dragon Queen!

Even though his strength was much weaker than theirs, he was in charge of all the overall planning of the Dragon Palace!

Prime Minister Gui was a scholar, and they were martial artists!

“Don’t worry, everyone. As long as you join our Dragon Palace, we will be a family. We will never allow any disharmony in our family. We will work hard together in the future!”

Prime Minister Gui said with a smile and left with them!

Wang Xian looked over and his eyes sparkled!

“From today onwards, our ancestral dragon lineage will join the Dragon Palace completely. There will be no more ancestral dragon lineage in the future. We will carry the will of the leader of our ancestral dragon lineage and become the Dragon King’s right-hand man. We will follow the Dragon King and restore the glory of our Divine Dragon tribe. The Dragon Palace is invincible! “Dragon King, Invincible!”

Not long after Prime Minister Gui led them away, the declaration of the ancestral dragon lineage caused quite a stir in the AI of the universe!

The strength of the ancestral dragon lineage was not weak. It could even be said to be very, very strong!

A while ago, the ancestral dragon lineage was still competing with the Holy Dragon lineage and had attracted countless attention!

Now, their declaration shocked the powerful disciples of the race, but it was also somewhat expected!

This was because the will of the leader of the ancestral dragon clan was to restore the glory of the Divine Dragon Clan! ..

Although the leader of the Ancestral Dragon Clan was dead and the ancestral dragon clan was greatly weakened, their will did not change!

“Since the Dragon King can bring the Divine Dragon clan back to glory, it is normal for the ancestral dragon clan to join the Dragon Palace!”

“The will of the leader of the ancestral dragon clan is to restore the glory of the Divine Dragon Clan. He doesn’t care whether it is the ancestral dragon clan or the Dragon Palace. As long as it is the Divine Dragon Clan, it is enough. The Dragon King has the strength to make them submit!”

“After the ancestral Dragon Clan joined the Dragon Palace, the Dragon Palace’s power has become much stronger. It’s truly invincible among the races below the peak!”

On the universe’s AI, all the disciples of the powerful races were discussing when they saw this news!

The power of the Dragon Palace had increased again!

Who else among the high-level races could compete with the Dragon Palace?

No one!

It wouldn’t take long for the Divine Dragon Clan to regain its glory!

Of course, there were some experts who didn’t think highly of the Dragon Palace because the Angel clan was the mastermind behind the six great races’destruction of the Dragon Palace!

Of course, most of the disciples believed that the Dragon Palace could regain its glory because the Dragon Palace also had the help of the Elf clan!

“Is this the Dragon Palace? It doesn’t look very powerful from afar.”

“The Dragon Palace doesn’t look very big. It seems to be smaller than the Dragon Palace of our thirteen Dragon Kings!”

“It’s true. I don’t think the Dragon Palace is very powerful!”

“What do you know?”? “Isn’t there a saying in the lineage of saints that the mountains are not high, but the immortals are famous, and the water is not deep, but the dragons are spirit. This is the Dragon Palace of our Dragon King, and the strength of these Lords is really terrifying. The Dragon Palace casually sent ten universe masters with level three Combat Power to help us move!”

Time passed day by day, and two months later, the 14 incomparably huge dragon palaces of the ancestral dragon lineage slowly flew toward the Dragon Palace!

At the same time, in the Dragon Palace, the six million great disciples of the ancestral dragon lineage were inside. They looked at the Dragon Palace in front of them with shock and awe in their eyes!

This was the Dragon Palace, the Dragon Palace that had shaken the inner parts of the heavenly desolate continent and annihilated the six great races!
