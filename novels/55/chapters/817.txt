Translator: 549690339

The insect clan was a locust in the universe, their most terrifying aspect was their reproduction energy.

When their numbers reached a certain level, they could even devour a planet.

Secondly, the leader of the insect clan had a terrifying battle form, possessing powerful physical strength.

The Gu originated from the insect clan, thinking about the terrifying gu, one could understand the terror of the insect clan!

The killer crab was similar to the leaders of the insect clan who had terrifying battle forms. If they cultivated the divine dragon transformation, they would definitely become a powerful battle clan that was not weaker than the Demon War Department.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

At this moment, a roar was heard. Ao Qitian’s eyes were blood red, and the ocean-pacifying divine needle became fifty meters in size.

He held the ocean-pacifying divine needle with both hands and swept it towards the killer crab.

“Pa! PA! Pa!”

The killer crab’s five limbs, which were like maces, coiled around the ocean-pacifying needle.

Ao Qitian’s eyes were filled with fury. He smashed the ocean-pacifying needle toward the ground.

“Boom!”

A terrifying force landed on the ground at the bottom of the sea. In an instant, sand filled the sky and filled the entire sea area.

“Eh!”

At this moment, Wang Xian realized that the ten limbs of the killer crab had all shrunk back into its body. Its two-meter-sized body was like a turtle.

“This... how did it shrink all ten limbs back into its body?”

Wang Xian was stunned for a moment. Then, he realized that the ears of the demon monkeys could hold the ocean-pacifying needle.

When some creatures reached the immortal realm, they would evolve a special ability.

Apparently, the killer crab had also evolved a similar ability.

“Bang!”

The killer crab that landed on the ground was not injured at all. It opened its mouth.

“Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle!”

A sharp sound was heard. In an instant, the surrounding killer crabs rushed toward the leader of the killer crabs.

“Wait and Attack!”

Wang Xian saw that Ao Qitian wanted to attack and immediately stopped him. He moved and came to Ao Qitian’s side. He stared at the leader of the killer crabs curiously.

The actions of the group of killer crabs were a little strange. However, what surprised Wang Xian even more was that a three-meter-long killer crab came to the leader of the killer crabs and entered its body directly.

That’s right, it entered its body.

Following that, the killer crabs ran over and entered its body directly.

Regardless of whether it was three to four meters or a dozen meters, they easily entered the body of the killer crabs.

“Mother insect?”

This reminded Wang Xian of a leader of the insect race who could carry other insects.

The killer crab in front of him could actually do it as well. This made Wang Xian exclaim in surprise.

“In just a few minutes, there are thousands of killer crabs. Impressive!”

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up. He had to subdue this killer crab race.

Not to mention its powerful attack power, even its ability to carry so many items made Wang Xian’s eyes light up.

Even if he had to subdue it and use it to store items, it was totally worth it.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and his body shook. A terrifying energy directly covered the killer crab’s body.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

At this moment, a group of members from the Dragon Palace flew to Wang Xian’s side. More than 20 celestials stared at the leader of the killer crab coldly.

In an instant, the leader of the killer crab was a little dumbfounded.

It raised its head and stared at Wang Xian and the rest with its two eyes.

Around it, the killer crabs were also lying on the ground in fear.

With the might of more than twenty celestial beings, even the leader of the killer crabs was trembling in fear.

“Surrender or Die!”

Wang Xian sized up the red killer crab with a smile on his face. His cold voice was transmitted into its mind.

The leader of the killer crabs moved a little. One by one, its limbs slowly appeared. Following that, it quickly dug into the ground, trying to burrow away!

Buzz

Prime Minister GUI saw that an immortal-level cultivator was trying to dig into the ground to escape. He waved his arm and the rich soil energy fell directly into the ground.

The sand began to condense and became extremely solid.

The nine dragons swayed their bodies and circled above the leader of the killer crab.

In an instant, the leader of the killer crab laid on the ground.

“Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle!”

When the message of surrender came, Wang Xian showed a satisfied look on his face.

Dragon blood essence wave, directly fell on the head of the killer crab leader.

“Bzzz bzzz!”

Dragon Blood Essence fell on the head of the killer crab leader, it was a little terrified of the disturbance, eyes twinkling staring around.

“WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH!”

At this time, a thunder spear fell in front of him three killer crabs in the body, directly penetrated it.

Ao Qi and the three lightning prawns stared at the leader of the killer crabs with lightning flashing in their eyes.

“Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle!”

The leader of the killer crabs immediately absorbed the Divine Dragon’s blood essence.

“Dragon King!”

A voice entered Wang Xian’s mind. Wang Xian revealed a smile on his face.

His body moved and landed directly in front of the killer crab.

The killer crab that didn’t extend its limbs was only two meters in size. Its body wasn’t very big.

Wang Xian touched it with his hand. It was very hard and had lost its attributes. However, his body was even sturdier.

Killer Crab: Level 13

Talent: space of the Netherworld.

“Space of the netherworld. The Netherworld Stone is the material used to refine spatial items. Furthermore, the space hidden in his talent can still store living things!”

Wang Xian looked at the information of the killer crab and revealed a smile.

“Take your people. We’re going to Hydra Territory!”

Wang Xian said to the killer crab.

“Bzzz bzzz!”

Suddenly, the face of the killer crab showed a look of fear, it kept saying to Wang Xian. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“What? Are you saying that Hydra is too scary to mess with?”

Wang Xian heard the killer crab leader’s words, slightly frowned and asked.

“Ci Ci Ci Ci Ci!”

The leader of the killer crabs nodded and kept talking to him.

“Cunning, wise, powerful, and terrifying. How many thousands of years has that Hydra lived?”

Wang Xian received these messages from the killer crabs and smiled.

The intelligence of this leader of the killer crabs was at most that of a seven or eight-year-old child. In his opinion, the terrifying enemy was merely powerful.

As for the cunning and intelligence, even an adult’s IQ could deceive the leader of the killer crabs.

“You don’t have to be afraid with US HERE!”

Wang Xian patted the leader of the killer crabs on the head and imparted the cultivation method of the demonic dragon transformation to it.

“The main thing is to forge the bones and cultivate in the direction of the Bone Dragon!”

Wang Xian reminded it and continued, “Bring your clansmen and we’ll go over.”

“Bzzz bzzz!”

The leader of the killer crab cried out, and tens of thousands of killer crabs swam towards him, lining up to enter his body.

Seeing the last killer crab enter, Wang Xian was amazed again.

“Go, subdue or destroy the Hydra!”

Wang Xian said to Ao Yao.

“The Dragon King!”

Aoyao nodded.

Wang Xian sat on the Dragon Chair of the Dragon Carriage. The nine dragons rode on it and flew towards the Hydra’s position once again.

Wang Xian did not know that this would be the first time he was facing a powerful creature that was as intelligent as a demon.
