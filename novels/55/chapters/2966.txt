Chapter 2967: In the Battle of 2967, Chimei Territory vs Dragon Palace

In the void of Chimei territory, a demon cave was flying rapidly.

In the Demon Cave, the members of Dragon Palace were talking and looking at the surrounding void.

“We can stop here. The five demon caves must pass through here. We Can Wait Here!”

An lie appeared in the demon cave, looked at the star map and said to Prime Minister Gui and the others.

!!

“Okay, Ao Xie, tell the devouring dragon to stop!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded and said to Ao Xie.

“Okay!”

Ao Xie nodded.

“It is estimated that the five demon dens will arrive in forty-nine hours.”

An lie looked at the time and said again.

“In two days, the Dragon King’s strength should be able to increase!”

Tian Chen said with a smile.

“This time, even if the Dragon King breaks through to the divine emperor realm, we can’t let the Dragon King kill all the demons. We’ll use this opportunity to train our troops!”

Prime Minister Gui said to the leaders.

“Don’t worry, Prime Minister Gui. This time, we’ll train our troops properly. This is a rare opportunity!”

Ba Qi smiled and said loudly.

“Don’t ignore this battle. This time, people will die. Every department, pay attention.”

Prime Minister Gui said seriously.

“Yes!”

The leaders responded loudly.

Although they were very confident about this battle, it was still very risky.

If the Dragon King didn’t break through to the divine emperor realm, some divine emperor experts would die if they were not careful.

After all, six fifth level divine emperor Yao Xie were not to be trifled with.

Time passed bit by bit. All the members of the Dragon Palace in the demon cave were preparing for the battle and practicing.

The entire demon cave was huge, comparable to a large planet. With more than a million members of the Dragon Palace in it, it was very spacious and could even carry out simple battles.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“It’s still a little lacking. Almost half of the dragon energy is missing.”

At the same time, at the location of the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian let out a low roar and opened his dragon eyes as he muttered.

Looking at the attributes in his mind, he shook his head in disappointment.

The level seven phantom flower of the Celestial Emperor contained too little energy. It could only upgrade it by two levels.

Although it could upgrade it by two levels at once, it was within his expectations.

“The current me should have the combat strength of a peak level five celestial emperor. With my speed, I can kill a level five celestial emperor Yao Xie in an instant by surprise.”

Wang Xian transformed into his human form with a smile on his face.

The five elements grindstone turned into a crown on his head while the Tai Chi Dragon Disc turned into light and dark. Two ink divine dragons were suspended around him.

A powerful and mighty dragon aura shot out from his body.

Wang Xian waved his arm and the five elements Grindstone and the Tai Chi Dragon disc landed in his hands.

“The glazed stone in my hands can still help the five elements grindstone and the Tai Chi Dragon Disc to level up to level five celestial thearch of the void. There shouldn’t be a problem after the level up.”

As he spoke, he immediately took out the five-colored glazed stone and the seven-colored glazed stone to absorb the energy within.

“Success!”

After more than ten hours, Wang Xian looked at the five elements Millstone and the Tai Chi Dragon disc in front of him. A smile appeared on his face.

He took out the communication stone disc and sent a message to an lie.

“Dragon King, an lie is here!”

In less than a second, an lie appeared in front of Wang Xian. He bowed and said with a smile.

“Let’s go. How long until we reach the five demon caves?”

Wang Xian asked him.

“Dragon King, we will arrive in less than an hour!”

As an lie spoke, they had arrived at the demon cave controlled by the Dragon Palace.

“Dragon King!”

The members of the Dragon Palace immediately shouted respectfully.

“Okay, let’s Go!”

As Wang Xian spoke, his body moved and he flew toward the exit of the demon cave.

Soon, Wang Xian was standing in the middle of the exit of the demon cave. He looked at the void in front of him.

“This demon cave is not bad. It is suitable to be used as the war machine of the Dragon Palace. The Arrow Dragon Clan and the Dolphin clan can stand inside and attack freely in front!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Wang Xian looked at it and said.

“Dragon King, not long ago, we were still thinking of turning a demon cave into a war machine. After we destroy the five demon caves, the Heaven Formation is preparing to take out a demon cave and forge a powerful war machine together with the Fire Hammer clan.”

Prime Minister Gui said with a smile from the side.

“Okay.”

Wang Xian nodded his head. “Long-range attackers can be located in the demon cave while close-range attackers can stand on the bodies of Xiao Lan’s little house.”

“Next, we have to raise the strength of Xiao Lan’s little house!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded his head slightly. Then, he asked, “Dragon King, what is your current strength?”

“There’s still a long way to go!”

Wang Xian shook his head slightly and said, “The next battle will be neither a big nor a small one for the Dragon Palace!”

As he spoke, he looked at the leaders of the Dragon Palace!

“Don’t worry, Dragon King. We have already made preparations. I guarantee that we will win beautifully!”

The leaders of the Dragon Palace said confidently.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile. Then, he chatted with Prime Minister Gui about the future development of the Dragon Palace.

“They are here!”

More than an hour later, the heaven formation standing beside Wang Xian looked at the compass in his hand and said.

“Are they here?”

All the members of the Dragon Palace narrowed their eyes slightly and looked forward.

Wang Xian used his yin-yang and five elements dragon eyes to stare at the huge five demon caves flying over at a terrifying speed. He narrowed his eyes slightly.

The strength of each of the five demon caves was almost double that of the one they were in now.

From the demon caves, an extremely terrifying murderous aura could be felt.

That Aura was suffocating.

“Get Ready!”

Wang Xian waved his hand.

“Wild dragon seed!”

“Imperial Dragon Seed!”

“Starwood Dragon Seed!”

“Heaven Thunder Earth Fire Dragon Phoenix Seed!”

“Thorned dragon seed!”

“Poisonous horned dragon seed!”

“Devouring Dragon Seed!”

“Fire Hammer clan!”

Ao Qitian, ao Fenghuang, Ba Qi, and the other leaders shouted.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Powerful battle intent and terrifying draconic might rushed forward without any concealment.

The powerful dragon seeds flew out of the demon cave one by one and stared at the five demon caves in front of them.

In the demon lair, members of the Arrow Dragon species and dolphin species stood in a row at the back.

Wang Xian stood in the middle while the incipient saint wings appeared behind him.

A strong fighting spirit gushed out from his body.

He had just broken through and was using this group of demons to test his strength!
