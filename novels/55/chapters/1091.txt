Chapter 1092: 1093, he was the unrivaled hero

Translator: 5496903

“Roar!”

The roar of a dragon represented the arrival of Wang Xian on this supernatural continent

Below, more than 100,000 ferocious beasts were trembling. The dragon’s might covered an area of five kilometers.

Here, all the wandering sea monsters below level seven of the supernatural realm were lying on the ground, not daring to move.

At this moment, through the broken door, everyone in Shenghai town saw this scene and revealed a shocked expression.

Everyone held their breaths. The Noisy East Door was now silent.

Along with the silent ferocious beasts outside, the entire world seemed to have quieted down.

“Mom, is he the unrivaled hero?”

At this moment, the little girl who was saved by Wang Xian widened her eyes and asked in a tender voice as she looked at the Majestic Dragon God.

“Yes, he is an unrivaled hero. He is the unrivaled hero of our Holy Sea Town!”

The little girl’s mother’s eyes were bloodshot as she looked outside with tears in her eyes.

A person flew out and transformed into a powerful creature to suppress all the ferocious beasts.

He was the savior of everyone in Holy Sea Town. He was their unrivaled hero!

“What... What kind of bloodline is this? How can it be so powerful that it can transform into the appearance of a Demon Beast!”

“When a powerful bloodline is cultivated to the peak, it can indeed transform part of one’s body into a demon beast. However, it is very rare to see someone who has completely transformed into a demon beast with a bloodline like this in the transcendence continent!”

“Could it be that commander Wang is from the Demon Beast Clan? No, the aura on his body is that of a human!”

Jin Qianyuan mumbled to himself. Sensing Wang Xian’s terrifying aura, his body gradually became excited.

“All the soldiers of the Holy Sea Town, follow the king’s command and fight together!”

“Fight!”

“Fight!”

A roar was heard. Seeing the powerful Wang Xian, the entire holy sea town was filled with hope once again.

“Let’s fight it out with them today. It’s either life or death!”

“F * ck, son, you stay here. If your father dies, don’t be sad. Be a man and protect your mother and your sister in the future!”

“Haha, so this unparalleled hero is commander Wang. Let’s Fight!”

All the transcendents above level one in Shenghai town flew to the city wall. The battle continued.

The Flames of war had been ignited. This time, no one would escape unless they died!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Outside the city, sensing the terrifying pressure from Wang Xian, the eyes of the 33 blood savage beasts at a few kilometers away slowly revealed a solemn expression.

In the middle of the city, a demonic beast let out a roar. Its ferocious voice spread throughout the entire Shenghai town.

“Fight!”

However, the response this time was the roar of everyone on the walls of Shenghai town.

Their arrogant and arrogant expressions gradually turned cold. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

A half-step void interpretation level demonic beast let out another roar.

The wandering sea demons that were not within the range of Wang Xian’s pressure headed straight for Wang Xian. The transcendent level 7 demonic beasts were also heading towards Wang Xian.

In an instant, tens of thousands of roaming sea monsters charged at Wang Xian from behind.

However, none of the roaming sea monsters that were within the range of Wang Xian’s aura dared to attack him. They lay there trembling.

When the thirty-three blood barbaric demon beasts saw this scene, a solemn expression appeared on their faces.

Wang Xian, who was floating in the air, heaved a sigh of relief.

Fortunately, the roaming sea monsters were aquatic creatures. They were of a lower level than him, so he could control them directly.

Looking at the dozens of supernatural level seven wandering sea demons and a few level eight and level nine ones that were attacking him, the flames on Wang Xian’s body trembled.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The wandering sea demons that were within his area of control suddenly moved. They attacked the group of high-level wandering sea demons in a frenzy.

The sudden attack and the attacks of 70,000 to 80,000 sea demons that were fearless of death caught the high-level sea demons that were charging over completely unprepared!

They had never expected that their own kind, subordinates that were lower in level than them, would suddenly attack them.

In an instant, dozens of high-level wandering sea monsters were covered by tens of thousands of sea monsters.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The dozens of sea monsters were caught unprepared by the sudden attack. In an instant, seven to eight of them were heavily injured and drowned in the group of fierce beasts.

The other ferocious beasts hurriedly fled in fear.

“This...”

Seeing this scene, all the people of Holy Sea Town who were standing on the city wall were stunned.

One person was able to suppress more than 100,000 ferocious beasts. Moreover, those high-level ferocious beasts wanted to attack, but they were actually attacked by those suppressed ferocious beasts.

This was simply one person defending the entire east gate.

“Commander Wang is helping us defend the city gate by himself? This is too terrifying!”

“This is too cool. is the creature commander Wang transformed into a Demon Beast? Or is this a powerful divine ability of Commander Wang?”

“Is commander Wang the one who killed the son of the ocean cultivator corps general? The ocean cultivator corps still wants to kill him?”

“That’s right, it’s this commander Wang. F * ck him. The ocean cultivator corps gave us up, and the kingdom gave us up. Instead, commander Wang is fighting with us!”

“What the F * ck is this king? This time, I can survive. There’s no SH * t star-moon kingdom, only Lord Wang!”

“That’s right, as long as we can survive, I’m willing to do anything for Lord Wang!”

Everyone on the city wall became excited.

Their army had abandoned him, and their country had abandoned them. A person that their army wanted to kill was fighting alongside them, helping them protect their last hope.

Everyone swore in their hearts that if they survived this time, they would be willing to do anything for them.

This was because Lord Wang had saved their lives. Most importantly, he had saved the lives of their entire family and protected their home.

“This is what a real home is like. Back when Xilai town was attacked, the mayor had run away, and all the important people had run away. Sigh!”

“I hope we can defend it and build a better holy sea town together in the future!”

The refugees who fled from Xilai town to holy sea town felt sorrowful when they saw this scene. There was hope in their eyes, as well as hope for the future.

With the mayor who fought with them, and Lord Wang who fought against thousands of soldiers alone, they would feel at ease in the future.

“Roar!”

At this moment, the 33 demonic beasts behind them could no longer sit still when they saw this scene.

They let out a roar and headed straight for Wang Xian’s position.

One of the demonic beasts stood in the void with a cold gaze. The other 32 demonic beasts charged straight at Wang Xian.

A terrifying dark energy that made one’s heart palpitate was emitted from their bodies.

Their bodies turned into streaks of blood shadows.

Wang Xian’s pupils contracted slightly as a solemn expression appeared in his eyes.

Four half-step void interpretation experts. Even he had to treat them seriously!

“Roar!”

He roared and spewed out a terrifying flame from his mouth.

The battle had begun!
