Chapter 971: 0972 stomped on his face

Translator: 549690339

In the Demon Hunter College, students of the same grade didn’t have to enter the arena to spar. However, students of the higher grades had to enter the arena if they wanted to challenge students of the lower grades.

This was also to ensure the safety of the students of the lower grades.

At the same time, students of the Demon Hunter College couldn’t endanger the other party’s life when sparring.

Wang Xian didn’t show any mercy when facing the young man who provoked him. A powerful force landed directly on his arm.

Boom

“Ah!”

A miserable scream was heard. The young man’s body flew backward and landed heavily on the ground. His arm was completely fractured.

“How dare a trash like you block my way?”

Wang Xian stared coldly at the young man who was lying on the ground and walked straight ahead.

The young man was lying in front of him. Wang Xian didn’t show any intention of moving. He stepped on the young man’s face and walked over.

A footprint was left on his face. It was clearly visible.

“This... is so strong!”

Behind him, the students of grade one class eight were dumbfounded. Their faces were filled with disbelief.

Their captain was the strongest student in their class.

There were a total of two level three extraordinary individuals in class eight. However, the other level three extraordinary individual was easily defeated by him.

However, this young man was actually able to defeat their captain in one move.

Such strength?

“You... What’s Your Name?”

The captain of class eight who was lying on the ground saw Wang Xian stepping on his face. His expression changed drastically.

He was the pride of Qiao Lin Town. How could he be stepped on by someone.

His expression changed drastically. He turned his head with an embarrassed expression and growled at Wang Xian.

“Wang Xian!”

Wang Xian heard the voice coming from behind and said faintly.

Stepping on a person’s face, one naturally had to leave their name behind.

“You... you ambushed me. Just you wait!”

The young man saw the stunned and shocked gaze of his classmate. His expression changed again as he spoke in a low voice.

He provoked the other party first, but he ended up being stepped on and walked over.

His dignity as the leader had completely dissipated. He could only say that the other party had launched a sneak attack to reduce the loss of his dignity.

Was It really a sneak attack? The situation in his heart.

That arrogant young man was really awesome.

“Leader, so it was that kid who launched a sneak attack. How despicable and Shameless...”

When the students heard his words, they quickly reacted and walked over to help him up. At the same time, they spoke furiously.

“So the person in the face-smacking young master’s mercenary group is Wang Xian!”

“He has some strength!”

Some of the students from other classes and higher grades saw the scene just now. They mumbled and looked at the back view.

“It’s him!”

“It’s really him. He’s the young man in the school forum who has a bounty on his head from the young master’s mercenary group!”

“This guy is really unlucky!”

“Brother, do you want to beat that kid up? It’s 10,000 middle-grade spirit stones!”

“10,000 middle-grade spirit stones is nothing. However, if I can beat this kid up, I can at least make a name for myself!”

Before Wang Xian had walked 2,000 meters, four to five young men walked over from the opposite side and pointed at him.

Their voices and actions were not concealed at all. As they pointed at him, they sized him up from head to toe.

When Wang Xian saw their actions and heard their conversation, his eyes were filled with impatience.

He had already lost a lot of patience when he was provoked repeatedly the moment he entered the school.

Wang Xian ignored the five people in front of him and walked straight towards the direction where he learned.

“Let me test his strength!”

The five of them stared at Wang Xian and lined up in a row.

A young man dressed in white walked in the middle with a black longsword in his hand.

They did not Dodge and went straight for Wang Xian.

“Eh? Interesting!”

Both parties were two meters apart. Seeing that Wang Xian had no intention of dodging, the young man in white curled the corner of his mouth slightly and raised the longsword in his hand slightly.

“Bang!”

When both parties were about to collide, the sword hilt in the young man’s hand went straight for Wang Xian.

Wang Xian did not dodge at all. His strong body was like a ferocious beast as he charged forward.

“Bang!”

“Oh no!”

When Wang Xian’s body landed on the young man’s body, the young man in White’s face changed drastically. When his wrist touched the sword hilt, a large amount of blood instantly flowed out. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

His body charged straight towards the back.

“Boom!”

The powerful force caused him to fall heavily onto the ground. He felt as if his internal organs had shifted.

Wang Xian continued walking forward expressionlessly.

“What... What are you doing?”

Seeing Wang Xian walking straight over, the face of the young man in white changed drastically. He asked with some fear.

The four young men beside him were a little stunned. When they saw Wang Xian’s expressionless face, they shouted immediately, “What are you trying to do?”

Wang Xian didn’t want to do anything. He walked straight forward.

HMM, coincidentally, the young man in white fell on the ground in front of him. Wang Xian stepped on him and continued walking forward without being alarmed.

“You, you, you...”

The young man in white touched his face with his hand. His expression changed drastically.

“Just you wait!”

His expression changed again and again. Finally, he spat out five words from his teeth.

Wang Xian ignored him and walked towards the learning field of class three.

On the way, all the new students who passed by looked at Wang Xian curiously and discussed in low voices.

The mission given by the young master’s mercenary group. If it wasn’t for the fact that Wang Xian’s strength was not weaker than a level three extraordinary, many people might have already come up to spar with Wang Xian.

Once he was beaten up, not only would he get 10,000 middle-grade spirit stones, he would also be able to make a name for himself.

Wang Xian looked at the gazes of the people around him and frowned slightly.

“Do you really think you are so easy to deal with? For 10,000 spirit stones, Hehe, and that young master’s mercenary group!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. This young master’s mercenary group. Sooner or later, he would have to teach them a lesson.

When he arrived at Class Three’s classroom, Wang Xian walked straight in.

“Eh? I didn’t expect you to really dare to come. Just now, there were quite a few people who came to look for you and wanted to spar with you!”

Seeing Wang Xian enter, Duan Qingwen raised his head and said gloatingly.

“Shut your mouth!”

Wang Xian heard his words and looked over. He said coldly.

“You...”

Duan Qingwen stood up abruptly and stared at Wang Xian coldly.

“Captain, teacher Yuan is here. Please calm down!”

A student looked outside and said to him hurriedly.

“HMPH!”

Duan Qingwen snorted coldly and glared at Wang Xian before sitting down.

Wang Xian ignored him and walked to the last seat and sat down.

“Everyone, please come out. I will bring you around the academy this afternoon!”

Teacher Yuan stood at the entrance of the class and said to everyone.

“Yes, teacher!”

The group of students walked out immediately. Wang Xian followed them out as well.

“We’ve wasted another afternoon!”

When they walked out, it was possible that teacher Yuan was a woman, so she was more responsible.

She brought them around the huge academy and introduced them one by one!
