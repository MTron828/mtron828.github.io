“Dad, just leave your things here!”

“It’s alright, it’s alright. I’ll be going off directly after the meal and will not be coming back. I still have to head to the construction site, at the latest by tonight.”

“Alright then, Dad. Be careful at the construction site.”

The middle-aged man and Yuan Yuanyuan walked at the back of the group. Her father was carrying a gunny sack with some living necessities in it.

Wang Xian turned his head over, smiled at the middle-aged man and asked, “Uncle, are you working in Rivertown?”

“Yeah, I’m working at a construction site. Yuanyuan happened to be in Rivertown and I thought I’d drop by since it’s near.” The middle-aged man smiled. From his gunny sack, he took out a box of cigarettes.

“Son, do you smoke?”

“No, I don’t!”

Wang Xian shook his head.

“It’s good to not smoke. It’s good. This isn’t a good thing!” The middle-aged man smiled and put back his cigarette.

The group of people headed out of school. The middle-aged plump man and lady were constantly instructing their daughter on some matters.

Su Qian and her family walked together with Wang Xian and the middle-aged man, chatting along the way.

Xiao Yu and the other two girls seemed to have gotten along well as they smiled and chatted.

The group of people headed towards Old Street. Although it was already September, the sun was still very vicious. However, they weren’t too far and the whole journey took only five minutes. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Let’s go. I’ll bring you guys to the most famous restaurant in the country, First-grade Restaurant, for a simple meal,” the plump, middle-aged man turned his head around and said to the crowd.

“First Grade Restaurant? Is it the same First-grade Restaurant that is insanely popular on the Internet recently?” Su Qian’s father exclaimed with amazement.

“Yeah, it’s that First-grade Restaurant. It is also the most luxurious restaurant in Rivertown.” The middle-aged plump man smiled and nodded his head. With pride written on his face, he continued, “A meal would easily cost several thousand. Let’s head there. Our kids will be roommates in the future and it’s also fate that brought us together.”

“It’s too expensive, too expensive! Let’s just find another place and have a simple meal,” Yuan Yuanyuan’s father quickly remarked.

“It’s alright, it’s alright. It’s just a meal. Let’s go! This meal is on me.” The middle-aged plump man waved his hand nonchalantly as he walked ahead.

When Xiao Yu heard where they were going, she raised her head and looked at Wang Xian.

Wang Xian smiled at her but simply followed behind the middle-aged plump man, who seemed to feel that he was above others, towards First-grade Restaurant.

“This is the most well-known First-grade Restaurant in Rivertown. Come, let’s go in!”

At the entrance, the middle-aged plump man spoke to the group and led them in.

“Welcome!”

As they entered, the greeters remarked passionately.

“Are there still tables available?” the middle-aged plump man asked.

“There’s only one more left at the main hall!” the greeter replied.

“Your business is really good. It’s not even 11.30am! Let’s go in!”

The middle-aged plump man led the way. Wang Xian and Xiao Yu also followed the group in.

“Director...”

When the two greeters saw Wang Xian, they were surprised. Just as they were about to greet him, Wang Xian immediately waved at them, signaling for them to not greet. Wang Xian simply followed behind the middle-aged plump man.

The two greeters looked inquisitively at him and didn’t continue.

“Look! These are world-class ingredients. Hehe. So incredible!”

The middle-aged plump man looked at the world-class ingredients as he smiled and explained.

Yuan Yuanyuan’s and Su Qian’s father walked over inquisitively and were shocked by what they saw.

“Let’s go. Let’s have lunch now.”

When the middle-aged plump man saw their expressions, he nodded his head in approval and walked further in.

Argh!

At this moment, a scream sounded from the side.

“My clothes! What are you doing? Don’t you open your eyes when you are walking? Look at what you did to my new clothes!”

Following this, a sharp shriek pierced the atmosphere.

Wang Xian looked over in surprise and saw a tall girl sweeping her hands on her clothes with contempt. She had a ghastly expression on her face.

“I’m sorry, I’m sorry.” The middle-aged man quickly turned around and apologized when he saw the stain on her T-shirt.

“Why are you carrying this? Why did you carry such a dirty bag to eat? Don’t you know that this is a high-class restaurant? You...”

The girl was furious and launched a barrage of insults at the middle-aged man.

“What’s the matter, Fengya?” the lady by the side looked over and asked, concerned.

“Mom, look at my clothes. These are new and cost over $2,000. They’re stained now!” the girl replied furiously.

“Uncle is walking in front of you. You probably knocked into him when you were distracted from playing on your phone!”

Wang Xian looked at this unreasonable girl and spoke with an unfriendly expression.

“If he didn’t carry this, how would I knock into it?” The girl stared at Wang Xian. “We are in such a high-class restaurant to eat. Tell me, why did he bring along such a damned bag!”

“Why is my father’s bag a damned bag? It’s clear that you knocked into him!”

Seeing the girl insulting her father furiously, Yuan Yuanyuan’s face turned red and she wanted to speak up for her father.

“Do you know where we are? This is First-grade Restaurant! You group of country pumpkins! Have you ever been to such a high-class place? Can this thing be brought in?” the girl retorted angrily.

“Alright, Fengya. It’s just a little dirty and it will be fine after washing!” the lady by the side quickly interrupted.

“Who says that First-grade Restaurant doesn’t allow him to bring this in?”

Wang Xian looked emotionlessly at the girl before turning around and seeing the nervous and lost middle-aged man and the unapologetic lady with her husband.

“Shouldn’t he know that he shouldn’t bring such a dirty bag here?” the girl rebutted.

“What poor upbringing! You knocked into him and yet tried to blame him for it?”

Wang Xian spoke to the girl coldly. This time, he had no intention to be polite and shouted directly.

“What are you saying? You are the one with a poor upbringing. Have you been here before? This is one of the highest-class restaurants in the entire country. Can this damned thing be brought in?” The girl pointed at Wang Xian.

“Alright, Fengya. Stop it! Brat, you should stop too.”

The middle-aged plumped man frowned and shouted.

“Shut up!”

When Wang Xian heard his words, he was enraged. He had never thought that he would encounter such a “unique” family.

“Who said that you cannot bring a gunny sack in? Tell me! It’s the fault of the parents if the child makes a mistake. Teach your daughter well!”

“Brat, since when are you qualified to criticize my daughter?” The lady exploded upon hearing Wang Xian. “What’s wrong with complaining a little after my daughter’s shirt got stained? Besides that, is it appropriate for him to carry a gunny sack here?”

“He can if he wishes. Why is it inappropriate? In this place, who dare to say it’s inappropriate?” Wang Xian looked emotionlessly at them..

At this moment, the quarrel between Wang Xian and them had drawn the attention of the surrounding crowd.

Manager Huang was shocked to hear his boss’s voice. He immediately ran over.

“Director Wang, what happened?” Manager Huang walked to Wang Xian and asked nervously after seeing his fuming boss.
