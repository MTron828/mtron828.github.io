Chapter 1145: 1146 dragon spike, coming

Translator: 5496903

“Peng, where did that fellow Duskdune go? It’s been an entire night and there’s still no news!”

On the first floor of the restaurant, Young Master Ying sat in a room, his face dark and gloomy.

Four to five middle aged men stood at the side, watching him eat.

“There’s still no news of Lord duskdune, he must have been delayed by something!”

A middle aged man immediately bowed and said.

“Fuck, could it be that Duskdune has died in the Hundred Beast City?”

Young Master Ying’s face was filled with displeasure as he sat there coldly. “The more I look at that fellow, the more displeased I am. Tonight...”

“Young Master Ying, Lord Duskdune Is Here!”

At that moment, the middle aged man interrupted his displeasure and said softly.

“Oh?”

Young Master Ying was not displeased with the middle aged man’s interruption. He raised his head and looked outside.

At the entrance, a middle-aged man walked over. The middle-aged man looked very ordinary. He held a sword in his hand and had a warm smile on his face. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

This middle-aged man looked very, very gentle and did not have the slightest bit of hostility.

When the middle-aged man saw Young Master Ying, he also had a smile on his face and immediately walked over.

“Young Master Ying!”

He walked over and greeted him with a smile on his face.

“Uncle Dihei, come, come, sit, sit!”

Young Master Ying did not put on airs in front of the middle-aged man as he gestured with a smile on his face.

The middle-aged man smiled and nodded as he sat in front of the table.

“Lord dihei, Lord Duskdune is currently missing. I wonder if something has happened!”

The middle-aged man at the side reported to dihei in a low voice.

“I understand. Duskdune understands our rules. If there’s still no sign of him, something must have happened!”

Darkness nodded his head slowly and said directly.

“Something happened? Uncle Darkness, Duskdune is so powerful. How could something have happened?”

Young Master Ying said with a face full of surprise.

“Young Master Ying, you still don’t know what happened last night, right? At the Hundred Beast City, a void interpretation expert died, and five or six transcendent ninth rank experts died. Duskdune might have taken the initiative to go there Last Night!”

Dark Darkness said faintly.

“What?”

Young Master Ying and the few middle-aged men beside him were slightly stunned, their faces revealing shock.

The loss of a void interpretation expert was a huge matter for the star Moon Kingdom.

Not long ago, a general of a void interpretation expert had been killed in the Star Moon Kingdom. It was said that four or five void interpretation experts had gone to take revenge.

They did not know the exact situation, but they knew that the death of a void interpretation expert could shake the entire kingdom.

They had not thought that another one had died last night.

“Then something must have happened to Duskdune City!”

Young Master Ying said with a sullen face.

“I heard that young master Ying is going to deal with a person, so let me handle it!”

Darkness said to young master Ying with a smile.

“Okay, Uncle Diablo, I was just about to ask for your help. You have to be careful of a transcendent level nine guy!”

Young Master Ying immediately said with a smile.

“A transcendent level nine, Hehe, young master Ying, don’t worry. I will send his corpse to you tomorrow!”

Diablo said indifferently, as if a transcendent level nine was like an ant in his eyes.

Indeed, he had the capital.

As two half-step void interpretation assassins that the master of undercurrent had spent a lot of money to nurture, he had the qualifications.

He and the other person were there to deal with the Dragon Assassin organization.

If the dragon assassin dared to enter another city, it would be the time for them to attack!

Moreover, yesterday, he had just completed a mission in Bright Moon City, assassinating a rank 9 transcendent.

“Haha, good. I believe that kid is not worth mentioning in front of Uncle Diablo. I heard that Uncle Diablo did a big mission last night. Uncle Diablo, have some food. I’ll bring you to see where that Kid lives later!”

Young Master Ying could not help but laugh.

He was the son of the master of undercurrent. A transcendent level nine guy dared to insult him. He would let him know what regret was.

...

“Dragon King, the spy has been found. We can set up Bright Moon City Now!”

In the evening, a group of drakonids came to the restaurant and reported to Wang Xian.

“Alright, let them take this. Also, pass all the information that we have gathered today to Ao Yao!”

Wang Xian nodded and said to them.

“Yes!”

The group of DRAKONIDS responded immediately and walked out of the room.

Wang Xian stood up with a smile on his face. He opened the window and looked at the bustling bright moon city.

The huge tower was even taller than Donghai City. There were all kinds of carriages and mounts on the road.

The powerful families in Bright Moon City were also several times more powerful than Donghai city.

There were seven to eight families with transcendent level nine or even half-step void interpretation.

“Tomorrow, the Dragon Thorns will cover the entire sky. It Won’t be long before the entire star-moon kingdom will be covered by the Dragon Thorns!”

Wang Xian looked confident as he mumbled.

“Are you planning to spread the dragon thorns across the entire transcendence continent?”

Feng Luan, who was at the side, asked with a smile when she heard his words.

“Of course. Let me know if you have any obstacles. The Dragon Thorns can help you solve them, your Majesty!”

Wang Xian said jokingly.

Feng Luan felt a warmth in her heart and a faint smile appeared on her face.

Night had arrived once again. Compared to the liveliness yesterday, Bright Moon city was much quieter today.

The matter of the Hundred Beasts City had been resolved. Tens of thousands of people had died, so there wasn’t much to be gained.

In the entire Bright Moon City, only two families had obtained an extraordinary level 8 pet egg. That was all.

The royal family of star-moon kingdom had only obtained three pet eggs, and only one transcendent level 9.

However, star-moon kingdom had lost a profound void martial expert. It was a huge loss.

The night grew deeper and deeper.

At this moment, in the room beside them, young master Ying and Diablo were sitting there with smiles on their faces.

“Uncle Diablo, I’ll leave it to you!”

Young Master Ying said with a smile on his face.

“I used one and a half minutes yesterday. Today, one minute later, I will bring his corpse over!”

Diablo said calmly, his body exuding a strong sense of confidence.

“Okay, Uncle Diablo!”

Young master Ying smiled and nodded. He raised the wine glass in front of the table and gestured to Diablo.

Diablo smiled and raised it to take a sip. Then, he walked out of the room.

The door was closed, but his figure seemed to have turned into flowing water as he walked out through the cracks in the door.

Compared to the dark sand, the darkness was even more terrifying.

In the room, Wang Xian didn’t rest. With Feng Luan by his side, it was impossible for them to rest.

Wang Xian, who was cultivating, didn’t sense anyone entering the room. Instead, Feng Luan, who was lying on the bed, opened her eyes. However, she closed them very quickly.

A stream of water entered the room directly. Some illusory shadows appeared. The shadows were extremely illusory with faint ripples.

He walked slowly towards Wang Xian.

When he was five meters away from Wang Xian, he felt something. He opened his eyes slowly and looked ahead.

Diablo was slightly surprised when he saw Wang Xian opening his eyes. However, he did not panic at all.

Assassinating a guy who was even weaker than him was a piece of cake even if he was discovered by him.

His body accelerated abruptly and the transparent dagger in his hand stabbed toward Wang Xian.

“Huh?”

However, what surprised him was that Wang Xian looked at him calmly.

What was going on? How could a guy who was at transcendent level nine be so calm?

The powerhouse he assassinated last night didn’t even know how he died!
