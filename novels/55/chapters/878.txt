Chapter 879: 0880 Ling Yun ambition

Translator: 549690339

The sudden attack of the longsword caused everyone’s expression to change slightly.

The longsword emitted a terrifying sharpness as it went straight for Wang Xian’s glabella.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly as a cold glint flashed across his eyes. He released his vision and flames landed directly on the longsword.

The longsword that was attacking him was instantly blocked by his vision. The terrifying flames were burning on the longsword.

All of Wang Xian’s supernatural powers were comparable to the supernatural powers of level three.

The descent of the tree realm coupled with the spirit enchantment could unleash the power of level four supernatural powers.

The Longsword in front of him was a weapon of level two supernatural powers.

Under the endless attacks, the level two weapon began to slowly transform.

“What? How dare you destroy my weapon? You deserve to die!”

An angry voice was heard. Following that, a fiery red figure drifted over. The woman had short hair and looked valiant. Her eyes were filled with murderous intent as she stared at Wang Xian.

Beside her, two servant girls followed behind her. They were also staring at Wang Xian coldly.

“Are you the one who deserves to die? This is clearly our place. Why are you guys here?”

Gu Qingwen stared at the woman coldly. He did not care about her appearance at all.

Now that he had become a drakonid, anyone who dared to hurt the Dragon King deserved to die!

“HMM? You guys don’t know who I am?”

The woman stared at them coldly and raised her head proudly.

“I don’t care who you are. Get Out of our base!”

Gu Qingwen stared at the woman with a gloomy face.

“How dare you! How dare you talk to our miss? Watch your words!”

A servant girl at the side stared at Gu Qingwen and said coldly.

“This is the base of our sacred glory mercenary group. Even if it’s rented, it will expire in half a year. Why are you here?”

Gu Qingwen questioned with a cold face.

“Huh?”

When the girl heard his words, she raised her eyebrows slightly. “I bought this place. I Don’t care if you have expired or not. Now, you bunch of damnable guys, compensate me for my sword. Otherwise...”. “I’ll make things easier for you in the future!”

“You bought it?”

Gu Qingwen and the others’faces changed slightly. They were a little embarrassed. “We have the lease contract in our hands. It will only expire after half a year!”

“What does it have to do with me? I bought the house ten days ago. I wanted to look for you guys to find the person who signed the contract with you. Now, it’s time for us to talk about breaking into my house and destroying my weapon!”

The girl walked towards them with a cold expression. She stared at Wang Xian with a burning gaze. “No one has dared to destroy my ao Xue’s weapon. If you don’t give me an explanation today, don’t blame me for being impolite!”

“So what if I destroyed it?”

Wang Xian looked at the girl’s burning expression and asked with a dark expression.

It was obvious that this house was originally rented by the Holy Light mercenary group. However, the owner of the house might have sold the house after they disappeared for half a year.

However, the moment they entered, the girl didn’t hold back at all. She directly controlled her longsword to attack. She was filled with killing intent, causing Wang Xian to feel a chill in his heart.

“So What? You’re very arrogant! If you don’t Kowtow to me and admit your mistake now and compensate me for my treasured sword, there will be no place for you in Shenghai Town. After you leave the city, be careful not to die in the Wilderness!”

The girl said coldly to Wang Xian. Her tone was filled with killing intent!

“You’re courting death. How dare you speak to our Dragon King Like That!”

When the ten drakonids heard the girl’s words, their faces instantly turned gloomy.

Gu Qingwen did not hesitate at all and directly attacked the girl.

“You dare to touch me? My father is the vice-leader of the squalid shark mercenary group. If you dare to touch me...”

When the girl saw the imposing manner that Gu Qingwen instantly erupted, a trace of fear flashed across her eyes as she screamed.

“Let’s Go!”

When Wang Xian heard her words, he frowned slightly and shouted softly.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Gu Qingwen’s expression changed and he stopped.

Wang Xian turned around and walked out. Gu Qingwen and the rest stared at the woman coldly before following her out.

“B * stard, Xiaoyue, go and ask my father’s men. which mercenary group did you rent this house to in the past? How dare they destroy my weapon and even dare to attack me...”

The girl watched them leave with a cold and stern look in her eyes.

A servant girl at the side hurriedly nodded and walked out.

“Xiaogu, if I remember correctly, the owner of the House I rented belongs to a member of the Dogfish mercenary group. If she really is the daughter of the vice leader of the Dogfish mercenary group, this house might not have been bought!”

Walking out of the house, a middle-aged man said to Gu Qingwen with an embarrassed expression.

“Yes!”

Gu Qingwen nodded his head with a solemn expression. He looked at Wang Xian and said, “Dragon King, it’s our fault. If that woman is really the daughter of the vice captain of the squalid shark mercenary group, we might be in big trouble!”

Wang Xian shook his head slowly. He did not expect to have a strong enemy the moment he arrived in this world.

However, this also allowed him to witness the cruelty of this world.

It was forbidden to fight in the town. If there was a grudge, one could enter the arena. However, in the wild, there was no order at all.

The dogfish mercenary group was a powerful force in Shenghai town. It was not something they could afford to provoke at the moment.

“Let’s Find a restaurant to stay tonight. Also, bring me to the center of the town to take a look!”

Wang Xian frowned and said in deep thought.

“It’s the Dragon King. The center of the town is just ahead!”

Everyone nodded.

“Don’t call me the Dragon King in the future. Call me...”

“Leader!”

Wang Xian spoke slowly as he walked towards the front.

“It’s the leader!”

The group of DRAKONIDS did not hesitate and nodded immediately.

The most eye-catching spot at the center of the town was the mayor’s residence. Other than the mayor’s residence, there was also the demon hunting mercenary group.

The demon-hunting mercenary group was not the name of a mercenary group. Instead, it was the headquarters of the mercenary group. It was located at the center of the town.

Wang Xian looked at the branch of the mercenary group in Shenghai Town and was deep in thought. He looked to the side and suddenly found a familiar name.

Phoenix Elixir and weapons workshop!

He smiled and said, “Let’s go to the demon-hunting mercenary group and form a new mercenary group!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian had already made up his mind. He would form a mercenary group first.

Since the elixir and weapon shop was opened by Feng Luan first, he would not compete with her.

He would start from the most fundamental mercenary group in the supernatural continent.

He would build a strong mercenary group, the most powerful mythical mercenary group.

He would also become the leader of a mythical-level mercenary group.

“I’ll first move to the seaside and accept missions related to the sea. I’ll subdue the sea creatures and build a force under the sea. After that, I’ll slowly conquer the entire sea!”

A smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face. His eyes were filled with fighting spirit.

With the mercenary group and the sea, they could develop in two ways.

“If one day, you become the Empress and I become the myth of the supernatural continent, the master of the sea.”

Let’s see who succeeds first!
