Chapter 326: If The Abyss Wants You Dead, You Definitely Will Be (1)

A peal of hysterical laughter broke out from Hu Qingqing. Although her laughter was exaggerated, her alluring voice with her trembling enchanting figure made it hard for one to find it annoying.

Instead, seductive vibes came from her.

Hu Qingqing laughed loudly before looking to Tang Yinxuan again and saying, “Tang Yinxuan, you must be acting naïve. Strength includes weapons, cultivation arts, and cultivation realm. You want a fair battle? Hehe! What a joke!”

As she completed her words, she played her Copperhead Viper Zither lightly. Instantly, several demonic snakes appeared before it.

“I have gone through great lengths to get this Copperhead Viper Zither. You want me to compete fairly with you without it? Hehe!”

Ridicules sounded and the surrounding people looked at Tang Yinxuan with doubts.

“Cough cough! Tang Yinxuan is really something to raise a request like this. She’s really... She’s really shameless!”

“Haha, that’s right. This is the most interesting request I have heard. A fair battle in her view is to restrict her opponent from bringing out a powerful weapon?”

“I’m really impressed. The thickness of Tang Yinxuan’s skin is something we couldn’t compare with. She’s simply shameless!”

“I’m speechless. To obtain the position of the Saintess, she actually raised such a hilarious condition. This Tang Yinxuan must be crazy! She couldn’t make it!”

“I have long heard that Tang Yinxuan rarely interacts with others. It will seem like she’s most likely an idiot to raise such a request!”

Around the training field, the disciples of the Heavenly Sound Sect didn’t attempt to hide their ridicule after hearing Tang Yinxuan’s request.

Based on the current situation, Senior sister Hu would be certain to inherit the position of Saintess. Therefore, the surrounding disciples weren’t wary of Tang Yinxuan at all.

Furthermore, they might be able to get on the good books of Senior sister Hu by doing so.

“Haha! Tang Yinxuan, you are really interesting. Weapons are naturally a part of one’s strength. You want a fair battle? You are really hilarious!”

At this moment, the Saint who was seated commented. He looked mockingly at Tang Yinxuan and continued, “You don’t have a good zither and so you want to restrict others from using one. Tsk! This thought is shameless!”

“That’s right. What a naïve thought. Senior sister Hu has a Level 9 unique zither and yet you want her to compete with you on an ordinary zither? In a life and death battle, will one put aside such a unique zither and compete with you on an ordinary zither?” A young man standing beside the Saint seconded and piled on the ridicules.

The Saint’s expression turned callous. He mumbled softly, “If I lend you my Level 7 Sky Devil Zither, you might still have a slimmer of hope. If you use that Level 6 zither, your chances of becoming the Saintess are zero. Oh, Tang Yinxuan, you really don’t know what’s best for you!”

“When I get the information on the brat that gave you the zither, I’ll let him experience pain worse than death!”

“The selection of the Saintess is to show the wisdom, strength, guts, and means of the future Saintess. You can keep such a laughable request to yourself!”

The Vice Sect Leader seated on the stage looked proudly at her own granddaughter before glancing coldly at Tang Yinxuan.

“If you know what’s best for you, admit your defeat immediately. If you continue, I’ll defeat you. You aren’t qualified to compete for the position of Saintess with me!” Hu Qingqing said to Tang Yinxuan with contempt.

When Tang Yinxuan heard the ridicules from the surrounding disciples, she was taken aback. A cold light flashed in her eyes.

“In that case, I would like to seek guidance about your strength!’

Just as she finished her words, she placed her Green Zither aside. Carrying the other zither, she jumped and landed in the middle of the training field.

She stood in the middle of the training field, tapped her arms lightly and the zither box behind her appeared in front of her.

“What? Look at the logo on the zither box. Isn’t that just an ordinary brand available everywhere?”

“It is! Could it be that Tang Yinxuan has given up on using the Level 6 Green Zither and is choosing to use an ordinary zither instead?”

“She’s probably worried that the Copperhead Viper Zither will destroy her Level 6 Green Zither. After all, that was the best zither Tang Yinxuan could come up with!”

“That’s highly likely!”

When the surrounding crowd saw the logo and brand on Tang Yinxuan’s zither box, they started looking at her with mocking eyes, insulting her. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Hehe! What a waste of my time!”

Hu Qingqing looked at the zither box in front of Tang Yinxuan. Coldness gleamed in her eyes as she said nonchalantly, “Within five moves, I will destroy your zither!”

“I hope so!”

Tang Yinxuan was nonchalant about the ridicules from the crowd and Hu Qingqing. She tapped the box lightly and sent it flying down.

“Please enlighten me!”

When Hao Zhong appeared before Tang Yinxuan, her entire demeanor underwent huge changes. Cold, prideful with a tinge of holiness.

She placed her slender fingers on Hao Zhong. The zither her mother had given her was where she deposited her longing for her mother.

As for this dull red Hao Zhong, it was the zither she really liked.

“Hehe. I’ll let you witness the might of this legendary zither and hand you a convincing defeat!”

Hu Qingqing’s expression changed as she appeared to have become one with the Copperhead Viper Zither.

On her arms, music notes coalesced from the demonic aura that was circulating and flowing constantly.

“How many strikes do you think Senior sister Hu will need to defeat Tang Yinxuan?”

“Within ten strikes. Although Tang Yinxuan also possesses Half-step to Inborn Realm strength, the might of the legendary zither isn’t something an ordinary zither could possibly match.”

“Haha, my guess is within five strikes. Didn’t Senior sister Hu say she would at most take five strikes?”

Seeing that the battle was about to start soon, the surrounding crowd was thrilled.

The Saint looked at the middle of the training field and Tang Yinxuan emotionlessly. “Using an ordinary zither from an unknown and insignificant character against Hu Qingqing with a legendary zither, she must be asking to be shamed!”

Sss sss sss!

At this moment, Hu Qingqing started playing. Her five fingers appeared to have become demonic claws as they moved rapidly on the Copperhead Viper Zither.

At that instant, a venomous snake made of eerie and cold energies swept towards Tang Yinxuan rapidly from the Copperhead Viper Zither.

As Hu Qingqing moved her fingers even more quickly, thousands of venomous snakes appeared. They emitted horrifying aura and attacked forward in a wave.

“Senior sister Hu’s attacks are too strong!”

“Tang Yinxuan is likely going to be defeated by this strike.”

When the surrounding disciples saw what happened, they couldn’t help but gasp in awe.

Tang Yinxuan wasn’t flustered at all despite facing a large wave of venomous snakes.

She placed her hands on Hao Zhong. Just as the venomous snakes were about to hit her, she played Hao Zhong lightly.

Ling~

At this instant, the surrounding crowd felt as though a downpour had fallen on them.

Sounds of rain resounded in their minds.

That wave of demonic snakes was flushed towards the floor and dissipated as though it was made of ink!
