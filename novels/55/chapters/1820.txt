Chapter 1821: 1821 God died, and the world cried out in grief

"Boom! Boom! Boom!"

The surface of the Pacific Ocean suddenly shook, and the sea water began to churn irregularly.

In the sky above the entire spirit sea palace, some of the sea water was churning in all directions, completely violating the rules of nature!

From five minutes ago, the entire ocean had undergone a terrifying change, attracting the attention of countless experts!

In the coastal city, some powerful warriors hesitated for a moment before flying over.

The disciples of the Divine Sea Palace outside were flying over quickly.

"Ahem! Ahem! Ahem!"

At the bottom of the Sea of the Divine Sea Palace, Sea God stood up slowly from the bottom of the sea with a pale face. He held the trident in his right hand and stared at AO qitian with an extremely embarrassed expression.

With every cough, he spat out large mouthfuls of blood.

With one strike, sea god was seriously injured!

"Father!""Father!"

"Lord Sea God!"

"My God, how could it be, how could it be!"

"How... how could that ape-man be so strong!"

The divine sons and goddesses cried out in surprise, and the expressions of the disciples of the Divine Sea Palace changed drastically.

As for the people at the training ground, they were completely dumbfounded!

Their Sea God, a true God, had been directly thrown into the bottom of the sea by one of the Dragon King's subordinates!

In a one-hit confrontation, the sea god was completely at a disadvantage!

"You... You, a demon beast who hasn't become a god, can actually erupt with such terrifying power. Could it be a powerful bloodline creature?"

The sea god slowly stood up and held his trident. He stared at AO qitian with an extremely unsightly expression and roared in a low voice!

"Buzz!"

As soon as he finished speaking, a blue light flowed toward his body from the ground. Above him, an ocean whirlpool appeared!

His pale face slowly turned red.

This scene looked extremely cool and magical!

"Ao Qitian of the Demon Combat Division of the Dragon Palace, Please Enlighten Me!"

Ao Qitian waved the ocean-pacifying divine needle in his hand. His figure moved and appeared in front of the Sea God as if he had teleported.

The enormous ocean-pacifying needle once again smashed down heavily.

"Ding!"

"This is my divine kingdom. Here, my strength can be unleashed to infinity. You Didn't ignite the divine fire. No matter how strong your bloodline is, I'm not afraid of You!"

Sea God's eyes were slightly red as he stared at the ocean-pacifying needle that was once again smashing down at him. He stretched out his arm, and the Trident met it once again.

This time, the blue light below and the whirlpool in the sky gathered directly on the tip of the Trident. It was incomparably terrifying!

A crisp collision sound rang out. The Sea God's body collapsed a little towards the area below.

His gaze was filled with killing intent as he stared at AO qitian!

This attack was evenly matched!

"Roar!"

"With such strength, you still dare to provoke our Dragon King!"

Ao Qitian and the other two gouyu stared at the sea god with contempt!

"Boom, Crackle!"

In an instant, a blood-red flame ignited on his body. In the middle of the blood-red flame, there were streaks of blood-red lightning-like stripes that made up for it!

A violent aura that made one's scalp tingle was emitted from his body.

The blood-red flame mixed with lightning spread toward the ocean-pacifying needle and attacked the SEA GOD AGAIN!

Unparalleled strength and violent attributes. This was the strongest dragon of the Dragon Palace, the Berserk Dragon!

An existence that was at the peak of the universe!

"What kind of bloodline is this?"

The sea god's expression changed slightly when he saw the change in Ao Qitian's body.

This violent aura made his heart skip a beat!

"Ocean, listen to my command. Kill!"

The Sea God roared, and in an instant, the seawater within a radius of 6,000 to 7,000 kilometers came to a complete stop.

Following that, waves of terrifying energy gathered toward his trident.

Boom

The dazzling blue light gathered at one point and once again met Ao Qitian's Attack!

"Bang!"

A terrifying wave of air rushed toward the surrounding areas.

The entire divine kingdom was trembling, and some items in the divine kingdom flew into the distance.

If it weren't for the existence of the divine palace here, the entire Pacific Ocean would have drowned all the surrounding coastal cities!

"Ahhhh!"

Under AO Qitian's attack, the sea god roared furiously. He held the Trident with both hands, and his expression was extremely ferocious.

"Bang! Bang! Bang!"

Ao Qitian withdrew the ocean-pacifying divine needle and then smashed it at the Sea God at a terrifying speed.

The sound of the Trident and the ocean-pacifying divine needle colliding could be heard, and the sound of close combat could be heard continuously.

In the divine kingdom, one by one, the buildings were collapsing violently!

The disciples of the Divine Sea Palace retreated backward in fear, their faces full of astonishment!

"How... How could this be? A small Dragon Palace on Earth, a weak force, actually..."

The divine sons and goddesses saw the violent demon monkey fighting with their father, and saw cracks appearing in the divine kingdom. Their expressions changed drastically.

In the divine kingdom, their father had an almost endless supply of power. Even if he was severely injured, he could recover quickly!

Under such circumstances, he was still unable to suppress the other party. One could imagine how terrifying the other party's strength was!

"Just one of the Dragon King's subordinates is already so terrifying. Just how powerful is the Dragon King!"

At this moment, a voice filled with fear suddenly came from behind.

The disciples of the Divine Sea Palace immediately looked to the side.

The young man had been standing beside the battle. He had a smile on his face, and he stood calmly with his hands behind his back.

Ever since he came to the Divine Sea Palace, the legendary Dragon King had always been calm and collected, regardless of whether it was the appearance of the sea god or the attack of the experts of the Divine Sea Palace.

He had always been so calm, as if he didn't take the Sea God Palace and the sea god seriously.

This made them think of what the Dragon King and the violent ape man had said.

A true God with a wisp of divine fire!

Before the Earth's revival and the arrival of the gods, the Dragon King had established the Dragon Palace, which shook the world and had a group of powerful underlings.

Now that his underlings could fight against the sea god, how strong would he be?

He would definitely be stronger than his underlings!

At the thought of this, the divine sons and goddesses trembled, and their eyes were full of fear!

At this moment, the sound of a violent collision rang out again, and the expressions of all the disciples of the Divine Sea Palace changed drastically.

Under the violent ape-man's attack, the sea god was once again sent flying into the distance.

The immense power caused the sea god's body to break the pillars of the Divine Sea Palace one by one!

A large mouthful of blood was spat out from the sea god's mouth, and his neat hair was completely disheveled!

"What a powerful bloodline power, what a powerful bloodline power! I admit defeat, I admit defeat!"

The sea god looked at his sunken body and roared with a face full of fear!

Countless blue lights within the god nation healed his injuries.

However, in just a minute of exchanging blows, the sea god had already realized that he was no match for this demonic beast!
