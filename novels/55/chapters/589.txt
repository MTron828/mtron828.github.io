Chapter 590: Gathering Of The Supreme Talents

The young man was shocked. He frowned as his eyes were fixed on Wang Xian while he was feeling a little defeated.

“Piao Lingxue recommend you to me. I wouldn’t under-compensate you regardless of whether it was spiritual stones or materials.”

After a few seconds of silence, the young man looked at Wang Xian and spoke.

Piao Lingxue?

Wang Xian’s lips curved into a smile and he said, “In that case, do you know that I also didn’t hand Piao Lingxue her weapons when she did not have sufficient spiritual stones with her!?”

The young man’s jaw dropped and his emotionless face looked a little distracted. Overall, he looked a little weird.

“This afternoon! I’ll bring spiritual stones over this afternoon!” the young man said with a heavy expression.

“I’m not free in the afternoon. I’ll be going out in a while. Come back tomorrow!”

Wang Xian replied plainly to the young man. He looked at the time and realized it was almost noon.

“I’m closing for the day. I’ll be heading out!”

Wang Xian walked towards the stairs as he spoke.

The young man pulled a long face while following Wang Xian, seeing him locking up the shop.

His eyes burned with passion and fighting will as he saw the figure disappearing before him. However, a frown appeared on his face gradually.

...

“Wang Xian, we are going off now!”

Soon after arriving at Mt. Fengyu and getting a short break in his simple room, Wang Xian heard a voice calling him from outside the room.

“Alright, I’m coming!”

Wang Xian opened his eyes, got up from his bed with a smile and headed out. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Outside the room, Yu Ling’er, Huayu and several other disciples were waiting for him.

“Senior brother Wang Xian!”

Several disciples greeted him warmly with a smile.

Wang Xian nodded his head plainly and said, “Let’s go!”

“Mm! Mentor Yu is going with us too!”

“We have to thank Senior brother Wang Xian for making it possible for us to participate in today’s spiritual tea session. Only the top ten mountain seats are qualified to join!”

Several disciples looked at Wang Xian and spoke.

“Let’s go!”

Mentor Yu arrived and led the group to fly towards where the spiritual tea session was being held on their swords.

Mt. Lingcha was located at the back of Da Hong Immortal Sect. There were a dozen-odd jade green spiritual tea trees growing above the waterfall.

Within the stream connected to the waterfall, there were various tea serving pots made out of wood.

Each tea serving pot was exquisitely crafted. There were five seats placed around each tea serving pot.

There were roughly fifty to sixty tea serving pots across the entire stream. At this moment, many disciples had arrived.

Those who could participate in the spiritual tea session were all elite disciples of various mountain sects. Other than young disciples, various mentors and the higher management personnel of Da Hong Immortal Sect were also present.

“The spiritual tea is made from leaves from Level 7 spiritual trees. The effects are immense even if you are only drinking the tea. Remember to cultivate diligently and absorb the essence!” Mentor Yu reminded the disciples around her.

After finding a good spot, they sat down.

“Yes, Mentor Yu!”

The group of disciples nodded their heads. Subsequently. the group of ten people from Mt. Fengyu sat around two tea serving pots.

The water below them was roughly two meters deep. One could even see fishes swimming in the clear water.

Having tea in this place was undoubtedly very enjoyable!

Around the tea serving pots were other pieces of tea wares and tea leaves that had been prepared in advance.

Wang Xian took a deep sniff and the aroma of the tea assailed his nostrils. He poured some hot water over the tea leaves and started enjoying his tea slowly.

As for the other disciples of Mt. Fengyu, they threw all the leaves into the pot and gobbled down their tea in a mouthful.

Their objectives were different from Wang Xian as they were after the energy encompassed within.

As for Wang Xian, he was simply trying to enjoy the tea.

This was indeed made from leaves from a Level 7 spiritual tree. This isn’t something that can be matched by tea leaves around. Drinking it could even increase my dragon energy!

Wang Xian sipped on a bit and revealed a faint smile.

Mentor Yu was also silently enjoying her tea.

However, Mentor Yu stood up soon after and walked towards the front.

Chirp chirp!

The cries of swans could be heard from the sky. The surrounding people were conversing softly, making the place feel a little out of this world

As more and more people arrived, the surroundings got a little noisier.

Pa Pa!

“Spiritual tea is for enjoying and not for gobbling down!”

“Hehe! Other than that Dragon King, the rest in Mt. Fengyu are all piles of trash!”

At this moment, ridicules resounded from the side.

When the disciples from Mt. Fengyu heard them, they jerked open their eyes and glowered at the group of people before them.

The group had roughly twenty people. They were staring at the people from Mt. Fengyu with contempt. Conceit was written over their faces as they stared down at the disciples of Mt. Fengyu with a sense of superiority.

When the disciples from Mt. Fengyu saw the words embroidered on their outfits, they were furious but held back their displeasure.

Hehe!

The group snorted and headed to the side before sitting down.

“Those people from Mt. Leng are truly scornful!”

“They are too overbearing!”

Several disciples from Mt. Fengyu grumbled furiously.

“Mt. Leng?”

Wang Xian turned his head around nonchalantly as he looked across. He realized the group were staring at him harshly.

She’s that girl with the almond-shaped eyes.

Following which, the disciples from Mt. Leng, who were next to the girl, started conversing softly.

Wang Xian looked beyond them and indeed saw their mentor, Lengyan, walking towards the front.

“Senior brother Hong Tianda is here? Who would have thought that Senior brother Hong Tianda would come to this spiritual tea session?”

At this moment, exclamations broke out from various places. Countless disciples at the spiritual tea session looked ahead curiously.

The young man was roughly forty years old. He had an exceptionally burly stature and wore a straight face. It was as though everyone here owed him money.

It was also his strong build and emotionless face that instilled fear in others.

“Tianyi Swordsman, Hong Tianda. He’s the pride of all disciples in Da Hong Immortal Sect. With his huge sword, he could defeat a whole crowd alone!”

Wang Xian heard a disciple standing by the side exclaiming.

“He’s my idol! That’s what the strongest disciple of Da Hong Immortal Sect should be. A while back, Great Senior brother Zheng Tianda fought with the strongest disciple from Yong Chang Immortal Sect. In the end, he lost by a move because of his weapon. If he had an equivalent weapon to the strongest disciple from Yong Chang Immortal Sect, the outcome wouldn’t have been certain!”

“Only Senior sister Piao Lingxue and Senior brother Ao Shuwen could possibly be compared with Great Senior brother. Even Senior brother Su Fa is a little inferior to him!”

Wang Xian heard several other disciples commenting.

It’s him!

Wang Xian looked at the burly young man. Isn’t he that brat I met earlier today?

Looking at his face, Wang Xian chuckled. He was pulling a long and dark face although he still owed Wang Xian one hundred and fifty thousand spiritual stones! Wang Xian found this to be a little hilarious!

So that’s why he knew Piao Lingxue. So he is Hong Tianda who I have heard so much about! And he’s the strongest disciple of Da Hong Immortal Sect!

Wang Xian’s eyes were fixed on him. When fighting with him a while back, he found this young man to be rather strong. He was even much stronger than Emperor Qi from Diabolism and Nie Wushuang from the Dong Hua Sacred Sect.

However, when compared to the current Wang Xian, the strongest disciple of Da Hong Immortal Sect wouldn’t even pique Wang Xian’s interest in battle.

“Piao Lingxue and the beautiful disciples from Mt. Xue are here too!”

“Senior sister Piao Lingxue is truly a breathtaking beauty!”

“The strongest and the second strongest disciples of Da Hong Immortal Sect are here! Even the fourth-ranked Senior brother Su Fa is here. We are just missing Senior brother Ao Shuwen now.”
