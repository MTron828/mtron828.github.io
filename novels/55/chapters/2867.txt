Chapter 2868: was strong

The people in the eight desolates and six directions were not too surprised by the announcement.

They would only be surprised if there was no such announcement.

The Dragon Palace was very strong, but it was not to the extent that they would remain silent even after a divine emperor was killed.

Moreover, this was the territory of the eight desolates and six directions.

Even if there was a dispute, the eight desolates still had the geographical advantage.

If the Dragon Palace really accepted the challenge, it would be impossible for them to send all the experts to fight against the eight desolates.

That was because it was too far away.

It would take a few months for even the divine emperor to travel from the imperial star field to the eight desolates and six harmonies.

Moreover, the Dragon Palace had two sworn enemies, the imperial court and the Wizard Association.

Wang Xian did not know about the matter of the communication network. Even if he knew about it, he did not take it to heart.

“Boss Wang, aren’t you too ferocious? Your Dragon Palace is too ferocious. They actually killed the imperial court and unified the Imperial Star Field.”

On the Blue Moon Planet, where Hong Fengyan lived, Wang Xian and the rest had just landed inside. Invincible in battle techniques couldn’t help but speak up.

“There’s nothing we can do. The imperial court wants to attack us. Our Dragon Palace can only expel them.”

Wang Xian smiled faintly.

“As expected of boss Wang. He’s doing too well. I’m still far from being invincible in battle techniques.”

Invincible in battle techniques shook his head.

In front of Wang Xian, he couldn’t be arrogant at all. It was the same in the past and it was the same now.

“I really didn’t expect that I would meet the Mighty Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. Thank you for your guidance a while ago. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to take this step now.”

At the side, Hong Fengyan was full of gratitude as she bowed to Wang Xian.

She thought about how she wanted to take him in as her disciple in the past and how she wanted to give him some pointers. Now that she thought about it, her face turned slightly red.

“This is also fate.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian smiled at her.

“This can be considered my fate. Otherwise, I might not even be able to break through to the Celestial Emperor Realm.”

Hong Fengyan looked at Wang Xian and said gratefully.

If she didn’t have the holy feather or Wang Xian imitating the immortal slaying calabash for her, she might not be able to break through even if she died.

This threshold was too high.

“I didn’t expect that Wang… you are actually the Dragon King. I really can’t tell at all.”

Ye Lui Ying and the rest of the senior brothers and sisters stood behind their master. They peeked at Wang Xian from time to time and couldn’t help but ask.

“Haha, what will it look like?”

Wang Xian smiled and everyone came to the pavilion and sat down.

“Now that you have taken this step, how are the preparations for the void God Kingdom coming along?”

Wang Xian looked at Hong Fengyan and asked.

“The materials are almost done. The Holy Region will prepare some for me. If nothing goes wrong, I will be able to become the god Emperor within a few months.”

Hong Fengyan said with a smile.

“Giving you a wind jade will be very beneficial to the void God nation.”

As Wang Xian spoke, he took out a wind jade at the first level of celestial thearch and handed it to him.

In the windless forest valley, Wang Xian had obtained dozens of wind jade at the first level of celestial thearch, as well as a second level of celestial thearch. There was no harm in giving it to her.

The reason why Wang Xian gave it to her was because of what she had done not long ago.

He would rather offend the eight desolation Celestial Emperor to protect him. He could make this friend of his.

“Oh?”

“There’s no need. I can’t accept the gift from you, Dragon King!”

Hong Fengyan was slightly taken aback as she said in astonishment.

“It’s alright. I have a lot of these things. It can be considered as making a friend.”

Wang Xian smiled and floated the Fengyu in front of her.

Looking at the Fengyu that was at the first level of celestial emperor, Hong Fengyan’s eyes sparkled.

“Alright then. Since I already owe dragon king a lot of favors, I don’t need this one.”

She smiled and put it away.

“Boss Wang, my master is coming over!”

“Someone told my master that I got into trouble and he was looking for me. Later, he got the news and wanted to come over to pay you a visit.”

At this moment, invincible battle technique looked at the communication stone plate in his hand and said to Wang Xian.

“Okay, sure!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile.

“Ahem, boss Wang, please give me some face later so that I can hold my head high with my master.”

Invincible battle technique moved to Wang Xian’s side and said softly.

“Alright, it’s been many years since we last met. I’ll give you a gift as well.”

Wang Xian smiled and waved his hand. The dragon machine fell to the side.

“Wow, boss Wang, what is this?”

Invincible battle technique heard that Wang Xian was going to give him a gift and looked at the dragon weapon. His eyes lit up. “Is this a mech?”

“It’s a creature that has been refined. You can enter and control it. It can unleash the combat strength of a peak immortal king.”

Wang Xian said plainly.

Now that the Dragon Palace had many immortal kings, such a treasure was not too important.

However, a treasure like the dragon armament was priceless in the entire starry sky.

Buzz

As Wang Xian spoke, he waved his arm. A drop of Invincible’s blood landed on the body of the dragon armament, allowing it to sense it.

“Wow, I can control it to unleash the combat strength of a peak immortal King?”

Invincible’s eyes lit up. Waves of information were transmitted from the body of the dragon armament. He flew over excitedly.

“Buzz!”

Landing on the dragon armament’s head, his body merged into it.

“Boom!”

At the next moment, a powerful aura emanated from the dragon armament. This was the aura of a peak godly monarch.

Furthermore, it was much stronger than ordinary peak godly monarchs.

“Hahaha!”

“My battle technique is invincible!”

Invincible’s battle technique controlled the dragon armament to jump around. The scene was somewhat comical.

“Shang Shui is here to pay his respects to the Dragon King. He is also here to see my stubborn disciple.”

At this moment, a voice sounded in the small courtyard.

“Please come in!”

Wang Xian and the rest looked outside and said.

Buzz

The next moment, an old man with a long white beard flew in. When his gaze landed on Wang Xian, he immediately bowed.

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

The old man with a long beard bowed slightly respectfully.

Although he was the celestial emperor, he still had to be more respectful when facing the leader of the third largest force in the starry sky.

“What is a stubborn disciple? He is a Peerless Heaven’s favorite. Please speak with more respect.”

Before Wang Xian could speak, invincible battle technique controlled the Dragon Machine to face the Celestial Emperor of Shangshui. He raised his head and said.

“Oh?”

The god Emperor of Shangshui was slightly stunned as he looked at the dragon machine in astonishment.

From the Dragon Machine, he could feel the power of a peak godly king.

“Hahaha, master, how is it? Isn’t it amazing? Boss Wang gave it to me, Hahaha!”

Seeing his master sizing him up, invincible battle technique did not dare to play around anymore. He flew out from the head of the Dragon Machine and shouted excitedly.

“Peak of the Godly King Realm, Haha!”

He was dancing with joy.

The god Emperor of Shangshui looked at his disciple and swept his gaze across the dragon armament. While his eyes were filled with shock, his face turned black.

He waved his arm and invincible battle technique could not control his body and flew towards him.

“HMPH, stubborn brat!”

The god Emperor of Shangshui snorted lightly and grabbed the back of his neck and pressed it under his hand.

“Hehe, Dragon King is laughing at me!”

He smiled awkwardly at Wang Xian.
