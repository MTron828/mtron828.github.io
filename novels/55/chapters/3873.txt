Translator: 549690339

“Currently, the five fleas in the nine-origin universe have locked onto the positions of two of them. We will use all our strength to kill them completely! ”

“No problem. Apart from killing them, we will launch a general attack. Even if we can’t destroy the Space City in the nine-origin universe, we must find out their trump cards. ”

“Yes, the Elders’orders are to launch a general attack. This general attack will determine our next situation. We can’t keep wasting time with the 9-origin universe. We’re all here, so there’s no need to waste time.”

More than 10 million years passed.

During these 10 million years, they had been completely wasted by the five battle teams of the 9-origin universe. They didn’t dare to separate, and the few legions had been gathering together.

Even though they were powerful when they were gathered together, their targets were larger!

The Great Disciples of the 9-origin universe had gone into hiding. Even if they had encountered and killed them, there were only a few dozen of them.

It was impossible for them to encounter a large number of the great disciples of the 9-origin universe.

However, once their powers were scattered, they might be attacked.

Over the past 10 million years, although they had not suffered any losses, they had completely wasted their time here.

Now, after more than 10 million years, they had received some news from the believers of the 9-origin universe, and they were able to lock down two of the five battle teams of the 9-origin universe.

Besides, they were prepared to launch a general attack on the space beast after destroying these two battle teams.

A general attack on the space city.

If they could break through it, then they would win a great victory.

If they couldn’t succeed, then they could test out the strength of the 9-origin universe and then make a long-term plan!

“Get ready to start. Faith tracking. ”

In a piece of space in the Space universe, the eight armies of the faith universe gathered together.

The leader was the trump card of the eight armies of the faith.

Some were space beasts at the level 6 realm.

Some of them were powerful battle treasures.

The eight faith legions, close to a thousand level 7 gods, and close to ten million gods and believers. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Their strength was extremely terrifying!

The eight legions gathered together, and the eight commanders looked at each other.

“Faith Tracking! ”

A Level 7 God gave another order, and with a wave of his arm, an item floated in the air.

“Weng, Weng, Weng!”

This item was a portrait of an expert from the angel race that they had obtained.

In the belief tracking of the universe, there were certain conditions required for tracking.

For example, the true name of the pursuer, some information about the pursuer, and the item of the pursuer.

For example, the portrait of the pursuer.

For example, the karma of the pursuer.

The more items one obtained, the easier it would be to track.

If they could get their hands on the tracker’s items, it would be easier.

In the past tens of millions of years, they had obtained a portrait of a great warrior from a battle team in the 9-origin universe.

Through the portrait, they could conduct faith tracking!

Waves of faith power condensed in the sky, and countless shadows of believers appeared.

They prayed and tracked.

Faith tracking was very troublesome and a huge project.

If they wanted to chase after an expert who was at the level seven realm, they would need to use the strength of at least five to six legions.

Just like the tracking of Wang Xian, a large number of strong believers from ten legions had to use the tracking of faith.

“This nine-origin universe is much stronger than we thought. We thought we could destroy it easily. ”

A level seven pantheon could not help but sigh!

“The 9-origin universe is one of the top-tier existences in the universe. It Won’t be easy to destroy them! ”

Another Level 7 god said.

“That’s true. The strength of the belief universe is one of the top-tier existences in the Universe!”

The Level 7 god nodded.

There was a hierarchy in the universe.

This hierarchy was based on the strength of the experts in the universe.

The 9-origin universe was not weak among all the universes.

At this time, in the sky, the immense power of faith condensed into a haircut and pointed in a certain direction.

“The lock has succeeded. Now, we have to pay attention to how to surround them. Otherwise, once they escape, it will be very difficult for us to catch up.”

A tier 7 pantheon spoke up!

“We have a sealing treasure here. Next, we might have to rely on the Netherworld Palace’s side! ”

A tier 7 pantheon looked towards a palace’s army.

One of the 24 palaces, the Netherworld Palace!

“No problem. Our Netherworld Palace’s nethersound is enough to immobilize them. The Nine Star Palace’s side is dealing with another battle team. We can’t let this battle team from the nine-origin Universe escape. Otherwise, it will be too embarrassing!”

The seventh-tier gods led by Nether Heavenly Palace nodded indifferently.

“Alright! ”

The gods nodded and smiled!

“Go, pursue! ”

The ten million legions of the eight palaces immediately attacked. They were mighty and carried an invincible might.

Their speed was very fast. With the guidance of the faith tracking, they were very close to their target in two years!

“The target is very close to us. Explode, go! ”

The gods of the eight palaces immediately increased their speed and flew forward.

At the same time, a group of more than 500 experts was floating in the starry sky not far ahead.

These more than 500 experts came from the twelve peak races.

The twelve peak races were the black tortoise race that was good at defense, the ELF race that was good at long-distance, the dark race that was strange in assassinations, the powerful skeleton experts, and so on.

When they worked together, compared to when the experts of a single race worked together, their strength would be doubled!

This was also the reason why they were able to create trouble for the belief universe over the past ten million years.

There were over five hundred experts, and the weakest was a ruler of the sixth stage. Among them, the number of rulers of the seventh stage had reached one hundred and fifty.

After all, it was the combined power of 12 pinnacle races.

However, right at this moment, a great being at the level of a ruler at level seven of the wizard race suddenly felt a sense of fear and looked toward a direction.

“Not good! There’s a huge amount of faith energy rushing toward us. This is a huge faith universe army. Let’s escape immediately! ”

This great being at the level of a ruler at level seven of the Wizard race took out a compass. When he saw the information on it, his expression changed greatly, and he immediately shouted!

The group of Great Beings from the 9-origin universe did not hesitate at all. They immediately fled into the distance.

“Those who believe in the mighty faith and the gods will gain eternal life! ”

“Those who believe in the mighty faith and the gods will gain eternal life! ” “Those who believe in the mighty faith and the gods will gain eternal life!” Right at this moment, an extremely terrifying sound wave energy attacked them.

This vast voice instantly enveloped them.

Those who believed in the vast and mighty, believed in the gods, obtained eternal life!

When this voice entered their ears, they seemed to hear countless exhortations and rushed into their minds..
