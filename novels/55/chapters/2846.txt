“That’s the divine wind emperor. I didn’t expect him to come so early!”

“Every time there’s no wind, the divine wind emperor would rush over. However, the Divine Wind Emperor’s target is the windless forest valley. It has nothing to do with us.”

“The other divine emperors don’t seem to have arrived yet.”

“The Divine Emperors’target is the windless forest valley. Now that the wind has yet to blow into the windless forest valley, there’s naturally no need for the divine emperors to come and wait.”

The sounds of discussion came from the surroundings. Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the divine wind celestial thearch.

Ye Lui Ying’s master, who was at the side, also looked at the divine wind celestial thearch with a solemn expression.

A celestial thearch would be a top-notch existence no matter where he was placed.

“Let’s Go!”

“Let’s Go!”

The arrival of a celestial thearch caused a commotion.

However, very soon, some disciples entered the windless forest.

Ye Lui Ying’s master did not give any orders. Everyone was still waiting quietly.

Two hours later, the various hurricanes in the windless forest had already reached the depths.

“Go in and be careful!”

The woman at the side said.

“It’s Master!”

Ye Lui Ying and the rest immediately bowed and replied.

“Follow by their side. They will protect you!”

She looked at Wang Xian and said.

Wang Xian felt amused and smiled. Then, he flew straight into the windless forest.

“Handsome Wang Xian, Sigh!”

Ye Lui Ying and the rest immediately followed behind. When they entered the windless forest, she couldn’t help but shout.

“Sigh, Wang Xian, what is your relationship with our master?”

Ye lui Ying couldn’t help but fly to Wang Xian’s side. She asked curiously with her big eyes.

Wang Xian pondered for a moment and said.

“Guidance?”

“Master has already agreed to take you in as a disciple. Why Don’t you agree? You should know that our master is a powerhouse at the peak of the godly monarch realm. Furthermore, he might even be able to advance to the godly monarch realm in the future!”

Ye Lui Ying said.

She hoped that Wang Xian could become her little junior brother. That way, she would be her senior sister!

“That’s right, little brother Wang Xian. This is the first time I’ve seen my master being so concerned about someone. Please consider it.”

Fifth Brother, who was standing at the side, also spoke up.

Wang Xian was stunned for a moment before he smiled faintly.

He wasn’t referring to your master guiding me. Instead, he was referring to me guiding your master.

“We have already entered the windless forest. Be careful and see if you can obtain some wind jade.”

The woman looked at Wang Xian and said to her junior brothers and sisters.

“It’s fourth senior sister!”

The few of them restrained their curiosity and looked forward.

Fourth senior sister was standing beside Wang Xian and could help him at any time.

Wang Xian looked at them and smiled.

In the next moment, the uninitiated holy wings appeared behind him.

“Eh?”

“Wow, what cool wings.”

The sudden appearance of the incipient saint wings behind Wang Xian made ye Luying’s eyes light up as she exclaimed in surprise.

Wang Xian was speechless and didn’t say anything. His dragon eyes of Yin Yang and the five elements stared at the spot in front of him.

It would take at least ten hours before the hurricane reached the windless forest valley.

Wang Xian didn’t have much to do during this period of time.

“Let’s go. In order to thank all of you for your warm hospitality, I’ll bring all of you along!”

As Wang Xian spoke, streams of green light appeared on the uninitiated holy wings and enveloped them directly.

“Eh? What’s This?”

“You’re bringing US along?”

When Ye lui Ying and the rest of the senior and junior sisters heard Wang Xian’s words, they were slightly stunned when they saw the green light enveloping them.

Their master still wanted them to protect Wang Xian. What was going on now?

“Follow me and you’ll know!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he flew forward.

“Eh? Look, the trees in the windless forest didn’t attack him!”

“That’s true. The windless days will only reduce the attack power of the trees in the windless forest, but they won’t stop attacking!”

“Is it that wing?”

Soon, Ye lui Ying and the rest noticed that the surrounding trees did not attack Wang Xian. This gave them a slight shock.

In the windless forest, as long as one flew and walked, they would definitely draw the wind. Once the wind was drawn, they would be attacked by the trees.

However, the surrounding trees did not attack him.

“Let’s go, we’ll follow behind!”

Fourth Senior Sister’s eyes flickered as she immediately followed behind.

When she flew over, she realized that she wasn’t attacked by the trees either.

This made her look at the green energy enveloping her body.

“We weren’t attacked either!”

“Wow Wow, this is great!”

The excited voices of ye Lui Ying and the rest could be heard from behind.

Wang Xian flew in front with a smile on his face.

Although he had only obtained one holy feather, he could still use some of the abilities of the incipient holy wings.

By enveloping them, they would not be attacked by the surrounding trees.

However, there was a huge restriction. Currently, Wang Xian’s wind attribute strength had only reached immortal King Level 2. He could only make the trees below immortal King Level 2 not attack them.

Once they entered the depths, the green light would not be able to protect them.

However, this was enough.

The attack of the trees in the windless forest was greatly reduced. This green light could protect them from entering deep into the forest.

“Wang Xian, your wings are too powerful. You can actually stop the trees in the windless forest from attacking us!”

Ye Lui Ying caught up to Wang Xian and said to her excitedly.

“I can only bring you guys to wander outside the center. Once we reach deep into the forest, the trees in the windless forest will still attack us.”

Wang Xian smiled at her.

“It’s enough, it’s enough. With our strength, we can’t enter the center. Wang Xian, you are our Lucky Star!”

Ye Lui Ying said excitedly. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Hehe, I’ll bring you to look for some wind jade to thank you for your hospitality during this period of time.”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Go, go, go, hahaha. Without the attacks of these trees, we will definitely be able to obtain a lot of wind jade.”

Ye lui Ying shouted.

The three people at the side were also moved.

Wind Jade was a precious treasure for wind attribute cultivators like them.

“All of you, follow me!”

Wang Xian increased his speed and approached the center.

Ye Lui Ying and the rest immediately followed behind.

“No wonder master values him so much. It turns out that he has a great ability.”

Fourth senior sister thought to herself as she looked at Wang Xian’s figure.

With such an ability, there was no need for her to protect him.

“There’s a wind jade over there.”

When Wang Xian and the rest had flown for more than an hour, he stopped and pointed at a tree in front of them.

“AH, it’s a wind jade, it’s a wind jade. This is at least a level three immortal King Wind Jade!”

Ye lui Ying looked over and said with burning eyes.

“Okay, you guys can take it off. Be careful when you’re picking it. You’ll be attacked by the trees.”

Wang Xian reminded them.

“Let me do it!”

Fifth senior brother also understood that the wind attribute energy surrounding them only protected them from being attacked by the trees.

However, if they were to touch the trees, they would definitely be attacked.
