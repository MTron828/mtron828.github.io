Chapter 3138: The 3137 Dragon Palace came here to exterminate the entire clan

“All members of the Dragon Palace who are participating in the battle, Get Ready!”

A month later, an order spread across the entire Dragon Palace. In the Dragon Field of the Dragon Palace, the disciples flew over immediately.

Wang Xian stood quietly in front of the Dragon Field.

The leaders of the Dragon Palace stood at the forefront.

Ao Qitian and Ao Qi, the leaders of the berserk dragon species.

Ao Jian, the leader of the Dragon Guards.

Ao Fenghuang, the leader of the Thunder, fire, and Phoenix species.

Ao Yao, the leader of the prickly dragon species. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Mou Zesen, the leader of the arrow dragon species.

Ao Xingmu, the leader of the Starwood Dragon species.

Ao Tu, the leader of the imperial dragon species.

Ba Qi Mosha, the leader of the poisonous horned dragon species.

Tian Zhen, the leader of the Wizard Dragon species.

The supporting members of the fairy dragon species and the dolphin species.

These were the combat dragon species of the Dragon Palace. The fire hammer species did not participate in this.

A total of 500,000 members of the Dragon Palace flew over quickly.

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

The members of the Dragon Palace came to the dragon field and lined up neatly. They bowed respectfully and loudly.

“All members, get ready for today’s expedition to the Dragon Tribe.”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the members of the Dragon Palace and shouted in a deep voice.

“Fight!”

The group of Dragon Palace disciples raised their arms and shouted.

“Alright, let’s Go!”

Wang Xian focused his gaze and ordered.

“Woo Woo!”

“Woo Woo!”

A roar came from the side. Xiao Lan, Xiao Zhai, and the rest swayed their huge bodies and let out a low roar.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

One by one, the members moved their bodies and flew towards Xiao Lan’s body.

Wang Xian’s body moved and landed on Xiao Lan’s body.

On the other side, ao crab landed on Xiao Lan’s body.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian said indifferently.

“Woo Woo!”

“Woo Woo!”

“FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT!”

Xiao Lan’s small house roared and immediately flew out of the Dragon Palace.

“Dragon descendant, nine swords. Do you really think the Dragon Palace will let this go?”

Wang Xian stared ahead with a cold look in his eyes.

During this one month, the Dragon Palace did not make any statement on the universe AI, nor did they make any movements.

They had been waiting for today.

He had promised the fairy dragon clan that he would annihilate the dragon descendant, nine swords, and the skeleton clan.

Now, he would start from the dragon descendant, nine swords.

Ao he and the rest had completed their upgrade. This time, the Dragon Palace had mobilized all their elite forces.

“We can finally take revenge!”

“The nine-sword race of the dragon race has killed many of our Yalong brothers and sisters. This time, we can finally make them pay the price.”

“Hahaha, the day has finally come. My father was killed by the nine-sword race. I didn’t expect that one day, I would be able to take revenge.”

On Xiao Lan’s body, behind the disciples of the Dragon Palace, there was a group of members of the Dragon Palace.

They were the members who had joined the Dragon Palace this month.

At this moment, they were full of excitement and excitement, and their faces were full of violent killing intent.

In the Milky Way, the sub-dragons who had the bloodline of the Divine Dragon had been living in fear and didn’t dare to reveal their identities.

Many of their elders had been killed by the descendants of the nine-sword dragon.

Looking at the powerful Dragon Palace and their powerful background, they were all excited.

The Fairy Dragons were the same.

Revenge!

They had to pay the price of blood.

Little Blue and little house’s bodies had reached over 600 km, looking like a huge island from afar.

It contained a terrifying aura.

They both had the power of a Level 1 universe knight. Their huge bodies and special talents made their speed extremely terrifying.

Little Blue’s small house appeared above the Milky Way. It opened its mouth and a black hole appeared. They immediately burrowed into it and disappeared.

When they reappeared, they had already traveled a long distance.

This terrifying speed made a Level 1 universe knight far behind.

The nine blade race and the dragon race were very far apart, and the dragon race was located on the right side of the Moon Silver Continent.

Their nest was located within the Void Mountains.

The floating mountains were connected to each other, like a dragon crouching in the Void, hidden within the white clouds.

The entire dragon race’s nest was extremely vast.

This territory had been operated by the entire dragon race for hundreds of millions of years, and within it hid the power of reaching the heavens.

Surrounding this mountain range were planets belonging to the dragon race. They were densely packed in the starry sky. There were many of them.

They were like the stars in the starry sky.

Wang Xian set his first target on the dragon race.

Firstly, the dragon race was stronger. Secondly, the dragon race possessed the Thunder attribute holy feathers.

The last time he killed three venerables of the dragon race, he only obtained six thunder attribute holy feathers from them.

Now, he had a total of 14, but he still needed 35 more to gather them.

He wanted to see if the remaining holy feathers were with the dragon-descendant race.

Xiao Lan and Xiao Zhai shuttled through the sky above the Milky Way.

Their speed was abnormally terrifying. Originally, even a universe knight would need to fly for two days, but they had already arrived at the edge of the Milky Way in about 10 hours.

Stars appeared in the starry sky at the edge of the Milky Way.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and looked at the void in front of him.

Buzz

Xiao Lan opened her mouth and a black hole appeared once again.

They entered it one by one.

“What kind of space behemoth is this? Oh My God, it’s so huge!”

“Hiss, black hole. Those two space behemoths broke through a black hole and entered it. What… What kind of supernatural ability is this?”

At this time, when they arrived at the edge of the Milky Way, there were many more people around.

When Little Blue’s small house and the others appeared, everyone who saw them revealed shocked expressions.

That huge body, the power of the wilderness, it made people tremble.

“That huge beast looks like the one from the Immortal Palace’s pet auction, but it looks much bigger.”

Some great beings looked at that familiar figure and guessed doubtfully.

Therefore, very soon, the news of the appearance of the two gigantic space beasts that looked like universe knights in the Milky Way spread rapidly.

“Dragon King, we’re almost there!”

As they continued to travel through the starry sky, they were getting closer and closer to the base camp of the dragon-born race.

Prime Minister Gui looked at the map and said to Wang Xian.

“Enter their base camp directly and destroy the two universe knights of the dragon-born race.”

Wang Xian ordered with a cold look in his eyes.

“Wu Wu Wu!”

Xiao Lan heard Wang Xian’s order and another black hole appeared in front of him.

He went down directly.

“Ka Ka Ka!”

The next moment, they appeared in the sky above a huge mountain range.

However, the moment they appeared, a dark energy emitted a loud sound in the surrounding void space and landed on Xiao Lan’s body.

Xiao Lan’s body trembled slightly and the power of the Law of darkness collapsed immediately.

“Woo Woo Woo!”

He let out an angry roar and a wave of wild power rushed downwards.

The terrifying aura caused the entire space to change.

“Dragon Palace, they are here to exterminate the entire clan!”

Wang Xian stared downwards and said coldly.
