Chapter 1158: 1159 joined forces to deal with the Dragon Spike

Translator: 5496903

“Fifty more?”

When Wang Xian saw Long Yi walking in to report, he was astonished.

The number of missions had increased by half compared to yesterday. This was at least two to three hundred million more middle-grade spirit stones!

“One hundred and fifty. A group of strange demons can easily assassinate us!”

Wang Xian smiled and nodded his head lightly.

The daily income of more than one billion middle-grade spirit stones was something that even the largest trading company in star-moon kingdom could not achieve.

“All of you go and make preparations. Be careful!”

Wang Xian waved his hand at long Yi and reminded him.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Long Yi nodded his head and walked out.

“If I want to deal with the Dragon Assassin organization now, there are two ways!”

At this moment, Feng Luan, who was at the side, suddenly spoke up. This caused Wang Xian, who was looking at the communication stone plate, to be slightly stunned.

He looked at Feng Luan in puzzlement.

Feng Luan looked at Wang Xian with a calm expression. “The undercurrent has a good relationship with star-moon kingdom. They can use the city protection formation to monitor your undercurrent. There’s no need for the master of undercurrent to take action personally. All they need to do is to monitor your people!”

“Secondly, hire the dragon spike but ambush the experts around the victims. These two methods can deal a huge blow to the dragon Spike!”

As she spoke, she stood up slowly. “Now that the undercurrent assassin organization has a blood feud with the Dragon Spike, star-moon kingdom will not wish for such an assassin organization to exist. Their counterattack will definitely come very soon!”

Wang Xian looked at Feng Luan and frowned slowly.

He knew that this was Feng Luan’s reminder to him. He was indeed a little arrogant and overconfident these two days.

As someone who once controlled an empire, Feng Luan saw something that he did not.

“That’s right. They will not let this matter rest. The leader of the undercurrent is not someone who will give up easily!”

Wang Xian frowned.

Buzz! Buzz

At this moment, the communication stone plate in Wang Xian’s hand vibrated. He was slightly stunned and immediately looked over.

It was a message from Ao Yao.

Upon seeing this message, Wang Xian’s face slowly turned solemn.

“The leader of undercurrent made a trip to the city Lord’s Mansion Yesterday and is now heading to the city Lord’s mansion. It seems that they are going to join forces to target the dragon Spike!”

Wang Xian frowned and a pensive look appeared on his face.

“That’s right. Star-moon kingdom will never allow the existence of a force like the dragon spike. In the city, unless you can intimidate the star-moon kingdom, they will always target the dragon Spike!”

Feng Luan was not surprised at all when she heard Wang Xian’s words.

“In the past, when we were in Donghai City, I ordered the dragon Spike to assassinate the city guards crazily. In the end, the city lord of Donghai city surrendered. It is still possible to use this method in bright moon city and even star-moon kingdom!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Wang Xian thought about it and said slowly.

Feng Luan nodded. “This is a very good method. However, Bright Moon city is using the power of the undercurrent to deal with the dragon Spike.”

“I don’t care if they are using the power of the undercurrent or not. As long as they dare to make a move, I will attack the city guards and officials of Bright Moon City!”

A hint of coldness flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes.

“Then make a move as soon as possible. Don’t let them weave a web to attack the dragon Spike!”

Feng Luan reminded him, “It’s possible. The net has already been woven!”

Wang Xian fell into deep thought. He knew that he had missed an opportunity.

When he first learned that the castellan’s residence had been monitoring the dragon spike with a formation and wanted to deal with it, Wang Xian should have sent the dragon spike to teach the Castellan’s residence a deep lesson.

That way, they wouldn’t dare to continue targeting the dragon spike.

Now, the Castellan’s residence had obviously joined forces with the undercurrent assassin organization. This was a little tricky.

“An assassin organization is something that every kingdom doesn’t wish to exist. Even if it exists, this kingdom must be able to control and restrain this assassin organization. The dragon Spike is already a thorn in the side of the kingdom. In the future, when you enter other kingdoms, you can either keep a low profile or be extremely high profile. Only by making this kingdom afraid will you be able to gain a better foothold!”

Feng Luan’s voice rang out again as she reminded him.

Wang Xian nodded his head slowly and looked at Feng Luan with a smile. “It seems like I should have consulted you earlier!”

“Tell me, what should the Dragon Assassins do now!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he sat beside Feng Luan and asked with a smile.

Wang Xian felt that he had been a little foolish these few days. Feng Luan was the number one empress in the history of time. Her experience and experience were definitely better than his.

He could totally let her handle the matters of the dragon assassin organization!

After all, Feng Luan had used her dragon blood to reconstruct her physical body. She could also be considered a member of the Dragon Palace. Moreover, the relationship between the two of them was a little complicated.

Why don’t I hand over the management of the dragon assassin organization to Feng Luan in the future, and I can be the boss?

As Wang Xian thought of this, he narrowed his eyes slightly and stared at Feng Luan with a smile.

“What kind of Look is that?”

Feng Luan saw him squinting his eyes and gave him a dirty look.

“It’s an admiring look. I want to seek advice from our Empress!”

Wang Xian chuckled.

Feng Luan turned her body sideways and didn’t look at his annoying face. “What we need to do now is to change the location of the spy as soon as possible. We need to try our best to find hidden areas where the formation can’t see us!”

“Also, don’t let your subordinates come into contact with the spy. Let Ao Yaoshen take back the commission without anyone knowing. If that’s the case, even if we lose money, it would only damage a few spies!”

“What’s next?”

Wang Xian asked directly.

“You’re asking me if you know what’s next? Of course, you’re looking for trouble with the Mayor’s residence!”

Feng Luan rolled her eyes at him.

“Impressive, impressive. As expected of the only empress since the beginning of time. Why Don’t you help me deal with the development of the dragon spike? With the empress around, I believe that the development of the dragon Spike will be smoother!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“I know what you’re planning. You left the matters of the Dragon Palace to Prime Minister Gui. Now, you want me to help you deal with the dragon spike? Don’t even think about it!”

Feng Luan rolled her eyes at him. Now that the dragon-phoenix Empire had just been established, she had her hands full. This guy even wanted her to deal with a force for him.

Then what was he going to do?

Sleep with his wives every day?

She would never let him be so comfortable!

“Sigh... you...”

Wang Xian was a little speechless when he saw Feng Luan’s refusal. It seemed that his plan had failed.

He shook his head and took out his communication stone plate. Then, he gave out his orders.

Boom

At this moment, a thunderous sound came from the sky.

Wang Xian looked out of the window. “It’s going to rain!”

“I’ve been in my room for a few days. Do you want to go out for a walk?”

He looked at Feng Luan and asked her.

Feng Luan looked outside and nodded her head faintly. “Alright, let’s go out and take a look!”

“Meow!”

The Meow of the fire and ice civet cat could be heard from the side. A skinny figure jumped onto Wang Xian’s shoulder.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian picked up the umbrella in the room and said with a smile.
