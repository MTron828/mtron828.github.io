“Seven immortal king level eight abyssal seeds?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly when he heard bei Shuang’s words!

“Lead the way!”

He said immediately!

Seven level eight abyssal seeds. With the strength of the Bei Chuan clan and the Dragon Palace, they could definitely deal with or even kill them!

This was good news for the Dragon Palace!

“It’s master! Master, according to the news sent to me by Elder of law enforcement, the invasion of the abyssal seeds this time is even more ferocious than the previous times. Many powerful abyssal seeds have appeared!”

Bei Shuang said with a somewhat solemn expression!

It had only been a month or so, and it had already reached a point where it was difficult to resist. If this continued, the northern front would probably be broken through!

Once it was broken through, the Abyss would receive a crazy expansion. At that time, it would probably occupy two-fifths of the entire Demon Island’s territory!

The more they retreated, the more likely it would be that the entire demon island’s starry sky would be occupied. At that time, the entire Demon Island’s trillions of people would become rootless duckweed, and the number of deaths would be impossible to calculate!

Therefore, he could not retreat to the northern front unless he had no other choice!

Even if he had to sacrifice countless lives, he had to defend this place!

“Is that so?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. His eyes were sparkling. If the forces on the northern front could not withstand it, then the Dragon Palace would not be able to obtain the abyssal seed so easily!

“It’s right ahead!”

The speed of dragon peak was very fast. In less than ten minutes, they arrived in front of a planet. This planet was obviously much bigger than the other planets!

And in front of the planet, countless abyssal seeds were roaring!

In the sky above the abyss, four old men were struggling to hold off seven immortal king level eight abyssal seeds!

One of the old men was only left with half of his body. He looked extremely miserable!

Below him, tens of millions of Beichuan sect’s experts and disciples were fighting against tens of millions of abyss seeds. The entire battlefield was filled with blood and looked extremely miserable!

“Sect leader!”

Bei Shuang’s expression changed slightly when she saw the miserable situation. She shouted and immediately flew towards the sky above the abyss!

“Shuang ‘er, be careful!”

The four people of Beichuan sect’s sect leader were delighted when they saw bei Shuang and the people from the Dragon Palace arriving!

“Sect master, I’m here to support you!”

Bei Shuang looked at Wang Xian before flying straight into the sky!

“Be careful, we just need to hold them back!”

The bei Chuan sect master and the rest growled solemnly!

The Seven Level 8 undying god King Abyss seeds had completely exceeded their expectations!

However, they could not retreat. They could only buy time for the bei Chuan sect disciples below to kill more abyss seeds!

As long as they killed half of the abyssal seeds, they would be able to retreat from the abyssal seeds!

“Let’s go, let’s rush over!”

Wang Xian took a glance at the formation in front of the Heaven Array. A fiery look appeared in his eyes as he growled in a low voice!

“All the members of the Dragon Palace, prepare to start a massacre! hahaha!”

The Heaven Array also laughed wantonly!

With so many abyssal seeds in front of them, it was indeed a huge resource for the Dragon Palace!

“Rumble Rumble Rumble!”

Dragon Mountain immediately accelerated, like a huge space beast, flying straight towards the battlefield!

“The warriors of the Dragon Palace are here to support us, I heard that they easily killed an undying level 8 abyss seed!”

“Everyone hold on, the warriors of the Dragon Palace are here to support us!”

The Disciples of the Bei Chuan sect had some understanding of the power of the Dragon Palace, seeing the huge dragon mountain rushing over, everyone’s faces were filled with excitement!

Especially the group of Bei Chuan sect disciples that had just come to support, they had just witnessed how the Dragon Palace Warrior instantly killed an undying level 8 abyss seed, the other one immediately fled in fear!

He even easily killed over 1,000 undying level 8 abyss seeds, 5 to 6 million normal abyss seeds!

“All Disciples of the Bei Chuan sect move aside!”

“Charge!”

The sky array controlled Dragon Mountain and stared at the battlefield before him as he charged!

At the same time, the sky array licked its lips as array compasses appeared before it!

“Weng Weng Weng!”

The next moment, the entire dragon mountain trembled as thorns covered it!

Every thorn had a 1,000 m long thorn on it!

“Move aside, move aside!”

“What are the Dragon Palace doing? Are they going to crash into them directly?”

...

“So Fierce?”

The experts and disciples of the Bei Chuan sect were slightly shocked when they saw long feng rushing towards them. The Disciples of the Bei Chuan sect who were in the way immediately dodged to the side!

“Roar!”

Long Feng was very fast. When he entered the battlefield, his enormous body immediately attracted the attention of countless abyssal seeds!

One abyssal seed after another attacked Dragon Peak!

“Fire!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

On the archery platform, Mou Zesen’s cold gaze stared at the millions of abyssal seeds around him as he lightly shouted!

“WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH!”

In the next moment, arrows streaked across the starry sky of the Abyss and instantly shot towards the abyssal seeds around them!

“Pu Pu Pu!”

In just one second, in just one second, 35,000 members of the heavenly eye archery division each shot out over 1,000 arrows!

...

Each arrow was like a deadly scythe, swiftly reaping the lives of the abyssal seeds!

Even 3 of the Undying Level 7 abyssal seeds were killed by Mou Ze Sen!

While the Heavenly Eye Arrow Division members attacked, Long Feng was still charging forward with an invincible aura!

“Peng Peng Peng!”

Some of the abyssal seeds that weren’t hit by the Heavenly Eye Arrow Division members directly crashed into Long Feng!

The invincible force of Dragon Peak instantly crushed hundreds of thousands of abyssal seeds!

“Kill!”

Ao Xingmu stood at the entrance of a cave on Dragon Peak and roared softly!

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

In the next moment, thorns like Dragon Pythons in the darkness attacked the abyssal seeds one by one!

In just a moment, Dragon Peak and the members of Dragon Palace killed over a million abyssal seeds!

The entire battlefield was filled with a vacuum!

Dragon Mountain charged straight into the camp of the abyss seeds!

“Hiss!”

Behind him, all the Beichuan clan warriors and disciples couldn’t help but take in a deep breath when they saw this scene!

“This... This is too fierce, the warriors of Dragon Palace are too terrifying!”

“So Strong, that Dragon Mountain is so terrifying, the undying level 5 or 6 abyss seeds didn’t even leave a mark on it!”

“Too strong, this dragon mountain is too strong, and the archers on it are even more terrifying, there are even undying level 8 archers!”

Everyone from the Bei Chuan clan glanced over, they couldn’t help but roar softly, their aura greatly boosted!

The Dragon Palace was 10 times stronger than they had imagined!

“Hahaha, good good good!”

In the air, bei Shuang’s support made the Bei Chuan clan leader and the others slow down a little!

Their gazes swept downwards, seeing this scene, they couldn’t help but roar excitedly!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

In front of them, the 7 undying level 8 abyss races bloodthirsty looked over, their faces filled with rage!

3 of them moved, wanting to attack Dragon Mountain!

“You want support? Stay Here!”

Bei Shuang shouted softly. Billions of miles of ice was sealed, causing the speed of the seven immortal god King Level 8 abyss seeds to be greatly reduced!

“Don’t seal them, let them through!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across and said immediately!
