Chapter 663: We Are The Kings! Overseas Races Surrender (1)

Translator: Larbrestudio

They hated the Dragon King for depriving them of the rights to become stronger. They were furious and wanted revenge.

However, what they felt was just a sense of helplessness.

The crowd of martial artists from the Underworld at Mt. Taibai had left them far behind. In the future, they would be forgotten by the Underworld and demoted to the lowest level of the Underworld.

However, just a day ago, they’d gotten the news of spiritual energy falling off the sky above Guta Mountain Range. This had ignited their hopes once again.

Several martial artists of the Underworld extended their arms out in excitement while enjoying the spiritual energy waterfall!

There would be a day when they would become a strong existence in the Underworld!

That day would be here sooner than later!

“Haha! The Underworld of China is truly a bountiful land. Spiritual energy descending from the sky? Moreover, it is so close to our Gautama denomination!”

“Your Excellency, it is also a great encounter for us that the spiritual energy waterfall is so close to us!”

“That’s right! This is a great encounter for all cultivators from India!”

“Half a month ago, no one would have expected a dragon to be hidden within the Underworld of China. He killed all the experts from six elite forces in Asia. Our Immortal Realm Excellency didn’t dare to step into the territory of China and we were forced to give up that wonderful chance encounter. Who would have expected the spiritual energy waterfall to appear here half a month later! This is destined to be ours! We will kill whoever dares to challenge us for this encounter!”

Suddenly, a peal of hysterical laughter that resembled thunder roaring reverberated. The martial artists from the Underworld that were standing on the mountain peak stiffened immediately.

Their excitement faded away as their expressions turned incomparably stiff. Fear gleamed in their eyes.

“NO! NO!”

“They... They are Gautama from India and some other forces!”

Those martial artists from the Underworld turned their heads around slowly. When they saw the approaching group of people, they felt extremely bitter.

“Huh? There seem to be people on the mountain peak!”

At this moment, the fast-approaching group of forces from India saw the group of people on the mountain peak. Instantly, they upped their vigilance.

If it was in the past, they would definitely not be so vigilant when they encountered forces from the Underworld in China.

However, the news that they received half a month ago spread fear throughout all the forces in Asia.

The Dragon King of the Dragon Sect in China had led his group of experts from the Dragon Sect and killed fifteen Budding Realm experts.

It was especially so for the strength displayed by the Dragon King. Based on the illustration of the disciples that had escaped, the Dragon King manipulated five swords and was able to kill Budding Realm experts from several thousand meters away easily.

Based on their conjecture, the Dragon King had probably reached the pinnacle of the Budding Realm or even the Half-step to Immortal Realm.

If their Immortal Realm experts weren’t heading over, it would probably be difficult for them to suppress the Dragon King and the Dragon Sect.

Due to the presence of the Dragon King from China, those six elite forces in Asia, which had suffered huge losses, didn’t dare to act recklessly.

When they saw there were people on the mountain peak, they were truly afraid that the Dragon King would be there.

“They are just a pile of trash. There’s nothing for us to worry about!”

At this moment, the old man with a double-headed truncheon looked across the group of martial artists from the Underworld. He gave a smile and spoke with a low voice.

“Haha! As long as the Dragon King from China isn’t around, we can act as we wish!”

Upon hearing the old man, the surrounding forces from India cheered loudly.

Upon hearing the voices that came from afar, the martial artists from the Underworld paled instantly. They felt they had suffered grave grievances.

They had turned to join the overseas forces but these overseas forces were in turn annihilated by the Dragon King.

The Dragon King had chased them away. Now that they found another great opportunity, other strong overseas forces came.

The group of martial artists couldn’t help but be furious and feel sorry for themselves. Their expressions were contorted.

“There are quite a few of them!”

The experts from the Gautama denomination stood in the air and stared fervently at the spiritual energy waterfall that fell from the sky. Following which, their gazes shifted to the martial artists below.

“Kill all of them to save us the trouble!”

An old man, who was wearing a mask, looked coldly at the martial artists below him and instructed them emotionlessly.

“Alright, kill all of them!”

Around them, the crowd of cultivators from India revealed brutal and fearsome expressions as they drew their weapons.

There were tridents, wooden rods, and truncheons.

When compared with the weapons used in China, there were huge differences.

“Don’t!”

Seeing that the other party wanted to kill them directly, the martial artists on the mountain were horrified.

“Please don’t kill us. We surrender! We surrender!” an Inborn expert from the Song Family shouted bitterly.

After surrendering for the first time, they felt no emotional barriers against doing so again.

“That’s right. We surrender. We are willing to listen to all your instructions!”

All the other martial artists of the Underworld chimed in. The only thing they didn’t do was to go on their knees.

“They are truly a pile of trash without any backbone!”

Seeing how they had reacted, the experts from the Gautama denominations were full of contempt.

“Hehe! We don’t need a group of weak dogs!”

An old man by the side looked down at the crowd of martial artists and mocked them coldly.

“Kill these useless creatures!”

A voice that was brimming with killing intent resounded again, making the martial artists on the mountain peak feel despair again.

“Why? I’m not convinced! Why! Why did things turn out this way!?”

The Inborn expert from the Song Family growled loudly with a contorted face.

Having encountered such events consecutively had distorted his mindset.

“Trash will always be just trash!”

Disdain filled the eyes of the experts from Gautama denomination and other forces from India. They waved their arms and sent attacks towards the crowd of martial artists from the Underworld.

Ka ka ka!

However, at the moment they wanted to attack, the void space started cracking. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

In the sky, the entire space seemed to be just like a piece of a mirror, as terrifying green ripped it apart.

A voice that could numb one’s skull rang throughout the sky.

The terrifying scene stunned the experts from the Gautama denominations and forces from India as they stared at the cracked space with astonishment.

Argh!

On the mountain peak, several dozens of martial artists cried out loud upon being hit with terrifying attacks from the experts of the Gautama denominations.

The experts from the Gautama denominations didn’t pay attention to them at all. Their eyes were fixed intensely on the sky.

“Is this the real world?”

A voice came from the cracks of the space, making everyone tense their bodies instantly.

At this moment, an old man with long hair and a green outfit walked out of the cracks.

The old man stood in the air and was observing his surroundings inquisitively.

Soon after, several old men walked out from the cracks behind him.

They were all wearing green outfits and the guys all had long hair. They had a similar style to those in the history of ancient China!

“Yes, Elder Hua. This is the real world.”

In the end, a voice reverberated from the cracks of the space and five young men with short hair emerged from the cracks.

The cracks recovered slowly and peace returned to the crushed space.

Approximately fifty to sixty people stood in the air.

They looked around and were pleasantly surprised when they saw the spiritual energy waterfall below them.

Their gazes swept across the crowd of martial artists from the Underworld before landing on the experts from the Gautama denomination and other forces from India.

“People from other nations? What are they here for? Surrendering to us?”

An old man looked down from above. He was expressionless and it was as if he was simply stating a fact!
