Chapter 1558: 1558 heavenly demon manifestation 4

“Sword heart grass, this old man wants one!”

“HMPH, that belongs to us!”

In the sky above the divine kingdom ruins, Ling Jian ‘er was surrounded when she ran to a spot not far from the huge sculpture.

When an elder at the seventh level of the insight void tier attacked, he closed his eyes in despair.

The surrounding experts did not want to be outdone and grabbed towards Ling Jian ‘ER’s body.

That terrifying energy was able to instantly tear her apart.

More than 20, at least more than 20 insightful void tier 7 experts took action.

Three insightful void Tier 8 sword heart grass was not worth so many experts fighting for, but no one wanted to give up.

Whoever could obtain a sword heart grass in an instant, basically, this sword heart grass belonged to the person.

In despair, Ling Jian ‘er stood in the air, trembling, her eyes tightly shut. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Boom!”

When numerous terrifying attacks came towards her, a violent collision sounded in front of her.

She could feel the terrifying energy coming from in front of her being completely blocked.

“What?”

“Damn it, who is it?”

Numerous exclamations came from the surroundings, and Ling Jian ‘er was slightly stunned. Her eyelashes trembled as she opened her eyes, and a huge door of darkness appeared in front of her.

In the surroundings, more than 20 profound void tier 7 experts saw that the door of darkness was blocking their attacks, and their expressions were ice-cold as they swept their surroundings.

Behind the group of profound void tier experts, there were also 50 to 60 profound void tier 5 and 6 experts.

They were also looking around in shock.

“So many people, so many experts. Bullying a little girl, isn’t that bad!”

At this moment, a cold voice was heard. Everyone looked towards the source of the voice.

A figure covered in darkness was walking towards them as if he was walking in the void.

His face could not be seen clearly. All that could be seen was a pair of indifferent eyes.

“Meddling in other people’s business?”

The old man who took the lead narrowed his eyes and sized up Wang Xian coldly.

The rest of the experts at level seven of the Seethrough realm stared at Wang Xian and questioned him silently.

“You guys are so bored. Seeing that you guys want to kill a weak girl, you guys want to meddle in other people’s business!”

The one who came was naturally Wang Xian.

Seeing that the group of people not only wanted to snatch the sword heart grass from Ling Jian ‘er, they also wanted to kill her.

This made Wang Xian a little angry.

Anyone who wanted to touch Ling Jian ‘er would have to go through him!

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a cold expression as he swept his gaze across everyone around him.

“Keke, why are you meddling in other people’s business? I have killed many people in the past, why haven’t I met you meddling in other people’s business?”

An old man laughed out loud and stared at Wang Xian mockingly as he spoke in a cold tone.

“In the past? Maybe I have been killing people too!”

Wang Xian looked at the old man indifferently.

“Why? Do you want to keep the three sword heart grasses for yourself?”

An old man stared at Wang Xian and asked faintly.

“Yes, I want to keep them for myself as well!”

Wang Xian nodded his head slowly.

Ling Jian ‘er, who was at the side, looked at Wang Xian blankly with her brows knitted tightly.

A dark figure? A bright figure?

“Haha, how arrogant. You are really arrogant to the extreme. You actually want to keep the three sword heart grasses for yourself from us. How arrogant!”

A loud laughter came from the mouth of an old man in a black robe. His voice spread across a radius of dozens of kilometers.

This caused the people who did not come to the entrance of the black screen garden to be slightly shocked. They looked over.

Some curious people immediately flew over and swept their gaze over.

“What happened?”

Everyone looked over curiously through the black robe.

“Don’t Mess with me!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across all of them and said faintly.

“Keke, don’t Mess with you? Who Do you think you are?”

“Let’s kill this guy first. After that, whoever gets the sword heart grass will get it. What do you think?”

The old man who took the lead slowly clenched his fist and a human-headed staff appeared in his hand.

“It’s been a long time since I’ve met such an arrogant fellow!”

“One move per person. Finish him off immediately. Don’t waste time, lest we alarm the Bingxin Empire!”

A weapon appeared in the hands of more than twenty black-robed powerhouses as they stared at Wang Xian and said calmly.

Based on their investigation, the opponent had the strength of a seventh-level Seethrough void stage at most.

One seventh-level Seethrough void stage wanted to fight against more than twenty of them? This was simply courting death.

One person with one move could directly kill him.

“Haha, it’s been a long time since I had a satisfying battle. I wonder how strong I am now?”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across more than 20 seventh level Seethrough realm experts. There was no fear on his face as he laughed maniacally.

A demonic dragon slowly gathered around him and revolved around him.

“A reckless thing, kill!”

All the experts at level seven of the Seethrough void tier stared at Wang Xian with murderous intent.

To dare to provoke all of them by himself was an insult to them.

Those who insulted others, kill!

“Kill!”

Around him, more than twenty experts at level seven of the Seethrough Void tier waved their weapons and unleashed terrifying attacks at Wang Xian.

“Haha, Let’s Fight!”

Wang Xian threw his head back and let out a loud roar. Instantly, the demonic aura on his body surged and surged towards the surroundings.

“Bang!”

A stream of demonic aura landed on Ling Jian ‘ER’s body and sent her over 3,000 meters away.

Ling Jian ‘er widened her eyes and fixed her gaze on Wang Xian’s position.

However, at this moment, the surging demonic aura had completely covered his body.

One after another, terrifying attacks landed on Wang Xian’s position.

“I hope nothing bad will happen!”

Ling Jian ‘er clenched her fists tightly as she stared ahead worriedly.

“Roar! Roar!”

At this moment, when the terrifying attacks landed on the demonic energy, a roar was heard from the center of the demonic energy.

The roar was filled with brutality and violence.

A majestic and terrifying dragon head broke through the demonic aura directly. His dragon eyes swept across all the experts at level seven of the Seethrough realm.

The attacks landed on his dragon scales without leaving any trace.

“All of You Must Die!”

A dark glow shot out from Wang Xian’s cold dragon eyes. He swayed his hundred-meter-long body and attacked them directly.

“What? He is a demonic beast?”

“What a terrifying pressure!”

The expressions of the more than 20 experts at level seven of the Seethrough realm changed slightly when they saw that the figure had suddenly transformed into a terrifying creature that was more than 100 meters long.

“Dragon Kingdom in the Palm!”

Wang Xian did not hesitate at all. The Dragon Kingdom in the palm of his dharma idol attacked them directly.

The pitch-black dragon claws were covered with densely packed dragon scales. The entire Dragon Claw transformed into a radius of two kilometers and attacked the group of experts at level seven of the Seethrough realm.

With the support of the Black Dragon Pearl of the profound void tier 8, not to mention the 20 or so experts of the same level, even an expert of the profound void tier 8 could fight!

“Damn it, don’t hold back, attack all of you, kill this beast!”

The 20 or so experts of the profound void tier 7 looked at the terrifying Dragon Claw, their faces filled with shock as they roared out.
