Chapter 1429: 1429, on the alliance

Within the ladyboy graveyard, everyone could feel a solemn atmosphere.

Everyone knew that the once-in-a-thousand-year revolution in the Liuhai region was about to begin.

A special atmosphere slowly spread throughout the Liuhai region.

In the past, there were sixty to seventy dynasties in the Liuhai region.

Now, after the rise of the dragon-phoenix dynasty, there were more than forty.

However, what the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty didn’t know was that a conspiracy against them had already begun.

“Wang Xian, regarding the matter of forming an alliance, we need to take a trip out!”

On the fifth day, Feng Luan called Wang Xian over.

In the Palace of the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty, there was an old man, sect master Yi, the leader of the Blood Stream sect!

“Shall We Go Together?”

Wang Xian nodded slightly at sect master Yi and asked Feng Luan.

“This is an urgent matter. The Blood Stream Empire has issued an order for all the dynasty-level forces in the Liuhai region to head to the imperial city of the blood stream in seven days!”

Feng Luan said to him.

“The reason why we are joining forces is not to target any force. Instead, it is to gain a firm footing in the upcoming war and not suffer any losses!”

Sect Master Yi looked at Wang Xian and sized him up. “May I ask, young master Wang Xian, what is your current strength?”

“I can fight someone at the sixth level of the Seethrough Realm!”

Wang Xian did not hide anything and said with a smile on his face.

Now, there was no need for him to hide his strength.

That was because he had an even bigger trump card, AO Xingmu.

In addition, in order to deal with the following matters, the spiritual liquid brought by Ao Xingmu and the rest was consumed by Wang Xian. It increased the strength of Ao Yao by a level.

Now, Ao Yao, who was at level four of the Seethrough Void Tier, could similarly kill a level six Seethrough void tier.

With these two trump cards, it wouldn’t matter even if his strength was exposed!

Even though sect leader Yi was mentally prepared, his pupils still shrank when he heard Wang Xian’s words.

“Hehe, I’m really old. A Peerless Heaven’s favorite of a generation. Even old fellows like us can’t catch up!”

Sect Master Yi shook his head and said with a smile.

“Haha, Sect Master Yi is too modest. When are we going?”

Wang Xian asked with a smile.

“Let’s set off immediately and try to convince the Light Dragon Dynasty and the Heaven Sword sect within two days. This way, we can have some say in the blood flow empire!”

Feng Luan stood up and gestured to Wang Xian.

“Alright!”

He nodded without any objections.

His plan was his plan. As for the humans, he still had to help Feng Luan.

The blood flow sect and Feng Luan wanted to join forces. If a war broke out in the future, they wouldn’t have to be used as chess pieces and be manipulated by the blood flow empire.

If they could join forces with a few major factions, they could be on equal footing with the blood flow empire. This would reduce their losses.

“Then let’s go. The Light Dragon Empire is the closest. It’s only 130,000 to 40,000 kilometers away. After that, we’ll head to the Heavenly Sword sect!”

Chief Yi stood up and said.

“Let’s Go!”

The three of them flew straight into the sky without bringing any subordinates.

Chief Yi stepped on a giant sword that was half a meter wide. A pair of fiery red wings grew out from Feng Luan’s back.

“Come to my place. We’ll be faster!”

Wang Xian looked at them and smiled. He took out the five elements millstone.

The five elements millstone expanded to a radius of 20 meters and floated in the sky.

Chief Yi smiled at Wang Xian and stood up.

The relationship between the blood stream sect and the blood stream empire was not very good. It was what he wanted to see the most to be able to form an alliance.

This was especially after he learned that Wang Xian was also a powerhouse at level six of the Seethrough realm.

One must know that there were only three to four powerhouses at level six of the Seethrough realm in the entire blood stream empire!

Feng Luan sat cross-legged beside Wang Xian. The three of them flew rapidly towards the Light Dragon Empire.

After flying for more than ten hours, chief Yi was slightly shocked when he saw that Wang Xian did not need to rest at all.

“The territory of the Light Dragon Empire is ahead. Their imperial city is not far from here!”

Coming to an area where the cities were slightly denser, manager Yi said to Wang Xian.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and sped up slightly.

“Let’s go straight to the Imperial Palace!”

A huge city appeared in their sight. The huge moat was spectacular.

“Let’s go straight to the Imperial Palace!”Sect Master Yi said with a smile as he looked at the central imperial palace.

With their status and status, there was no need for them to ask for permission to enter the Imperial Palace of the Light Dragon Dynasty.

They flew straight to the royal palace. The defensive formation of the Royal Palace couldn’t stop them at all.

After passing through the defensive formation of the royal palace, they flew toward the royal palace at a terrifying speed.

The guards of the entire royal palace couldn’t react in time.

“Brother Long Xiaotian, a friend is here to pay a visit!”

“King of the Radiant Dragon Empire, we have something to discuss!”

When they arrived in the sky above the Radiant Dragon Empire, Wang Xian gave a light shout and a smile appeared on his face.

Although his relationship with long Xiaotian was relatively good, it wasn’t very good when compared to the Radiant Dragon Empire.

After all, he had once killed the crown prince of the Radiant Dragon Empire on the spot.

“HMM? Who Dares to make a ruckus in our Royal Palace!”

An angry shout came from below the royal palace and many insightful emptiness realm experts soared into the sky.

At this moment, in the imperial study room in the Royal Palace, Long Xiaotian and a few ministers were standing in front reporting to the king of the Radiant Dragon Empire.

When he heard this voice, Long Xiaotian was slightly stunned. He was filled with astonishment.

A hint of anger flashed across the king of the Radiant Dragon Empire’s face!

If Wang Xian wasn’t too strong, he would definitely take revenge for the death of his son.

The King of the Radiant Dragon Empire moved and appeared in the sky.

“Oh? Sect leader Yi?”

When the king of the Radiant Dragon Empire was floating in the sky, he saw Wang Xian and the other two. His gaze landed on the sect leader of the blood stream sect and he was astonished.

“You are the one who killed my grandson. How dare you come to My Light Dragon Empire? You are courting death!”

Suddenly, an old man rushed out from below. A thousand-meter-long light sword attacked Wang Xian directly.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly. The five elements grinding mill beneath him moved slightly and a wisp of gray energy swept toward the light sword. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

With a sweep, the light sword disappeared.

“Guanglong Empire, we have something important to discuss with you. Don’t bring about your own destruction!”

Sect Master Yi frowned slightly when he saw that the experts from the Guanglong Empire dared to attack directly.

“Sect master Yi, what is there to discuss?”

The king of Guanglong Empire’s pupils contracted slightly when he saw Wang Xian easily wiping off his father’s attack. He said solemnly.

“This is the Queen of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire regarding the future of the blood flow region. As for young master Wang, you should know that we are not enemies!”

Sect Master Yi said faintly.

“The Queen of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire?”

The King of Light Dragon was slightly taken aback. He had heard of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire which had recently risen in the distance.

He was filled with fear towards this empire.

There were many more cities under the dragon-phoenix dynasty than there were under the Light Dragon Dynasty.

“Come to our imperial study and talk!”
