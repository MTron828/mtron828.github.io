Translator: 5496903

“They actually wiped out the Zhang family just because of my relationship with Zhang Fengying?”

Wang Xian’s face was gloomy and extremely embarrassed.

Wang Xian had met Zhang Fengying’s nephew and her niece, Zhang Yitian.

Especially Zhang Yitian, the leader of the amethyst mercenary group of the Demon Hunters Academy. She was a very tall and beautiful girl.

He didn’t expect the ocean cultivators to be so ruthless. He also didn’t expect the eastern sea city to be so ruthless.

They wanted to kill all of them just because of a little relationship.

Now, Zhang Fengying had escaped to Dragon and Phoenix City!

Wang Xian clenched his fists tightly. His eyes were filled with flames of anger.

“Xiao Xian, what happened?”

The six girls at the side saw Wang Xian’s angry look and asked hurriedly.

“A family was wiped out because of me. Only one person managed to escape!”

Wang Xian heaved a sigh of relief and said in a deep voice.

“Are we going out?”

Guan Shuqing looked at Wang Xian and asked in a deep voice.

“Yes, we are going out. Come with me. We can go and see Feng Luan!”

Wang Xian looked at the few girls and said.

“Alright, we want to go to the transcendence continent to take a look!”

The few girls nodded immediately. They had not gone out in the past few days since they came to the transcendence continent!

“I won’t go, Xiao Xian!”

Lan Qingyue suddenly said.

“Have you decided?”

Wang Xian looked at her and asked seriously.

“I’ve decided. Don’t worry. Nothing will happen to me. Moreover, I’m basically in the ocean. Unless, one day, Xiao Lan can block the sky, we will only appear in the starry sky of the transcendence continent!”

Lan Qingyue revealed a smile, a fighting spirit flashed in her eyes. “We won’t be in any danger. Moreover, I have a piece of soul-returning wood with me. Even if something really happens, I believe that you will come looking for me. However, such a probability is almost non-existent!”

“Alright!”

Wang Xian walked over and hugged her.

“Don’t worry, Xiao Xian. As the last legacy of the ancient god Race and the owner of the ancient God’s kun-rearing plant, I will become a powerhouse in no time. I will come back when the time comes. I will be back very soon!”

Lan Qingyue’s eyes were slightly red as she lay in Wang Xian’s embrace.

“Sister Qingyue, we’ll miss you!”

Guan Shuqing and the other girls hugged her.

“With the communication stone plate, we can communicate frequently. Don’t worry, I’ll leave Xiaoxian to you guys. Don’t let him drift away!”

“Don’t worry, Qingyue. If he dares to drift away, we’ll take care of him!”

“Okay, okay, I’m leaving. Little Xian, Shu Qing, yinxuan, Qinglan, Agaya, Lingxiu!”

After saying her goodbyes, Lan Qingyue moved and stood on Little Blue’s body, swimming toward the depths of the vast ocean.

“Retch!”

A special sound came from Little Blue’s mouth, echoing within a radius of a hundred Li.

Lan Qingyue stood on Little Blue’s head and looked at the incomparably deep ocean.

After inheriting the heritage of the ancient God Race, the last bloodline of her ancient god race would be able to reproduce the divine power of the ancient god Race.

When the voice of the Kun resounded across the supernatural continent, it was the time for everyone to submit to her.

Lan Qingyue’s departure caused Wang Xian’s bad mood to sink once again.

“Let’s go, let’s go to Dragon and Phoenix City!”

Wang Xian took a deep breath and said to the few girls.

“Alright, Little Xian!”

The five girls nodded.

After the five of them had consumed a large number of elixirs, the weakest one among them was at level five of the extraordinaire.

The strongest one was Sun Lingxiu. Her cultivation had reached level seven of the extraordinaire and was the strongest among the girls.

She had a light physique to begin with and her cultivation speed was about ten times that of the members of the Dragon Palace.

Coupled with the enhancement of the array formation of the dragon palace, her cultivation speed was simply heaven-defying.

Wang Xian relied on the consumption of various elixirs and water tribe to improve rapidly. On the other hand, she only consumed a portion of the elixirs while the rest relied on her own cultivation. It was extremely perverse.

Everyone flew out of the Dragon Palace. Ao Jian led his ten subordinates to follow beside him while Ao Jian and the rest hid in the surroundings.

Now that the Dragon Palace was on the right track, they were scouting out the ferocious and demonic beast races within a radius of a hundred miles. They were preparing to devour them bit by bit.

With Mou Zesen, an existence at the insightful void level, their future development would be much smoother.

“Huh?”

When Wang Xian flew out of the ocean, he immediately sensed the gazes hidden in the surroundings.

Wang Xian swept his gaze over and a look of astonishment appeared in his eyes.

“There are so many spies. They should be investigating the matter of dragon and Phoenix City!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly.

The name of Shenghai town had been changed to Dragon and Phoenix City. Furthermore, someone had established the dragon and Phoenix Empire here.

The general of the ocean cultivator army had been killed here.

These matters could not be concealed. When news of Donghai City came, it caused a huge commotion.

The city Lord, Lei Feihu, was filled with shock. He immediately reported this matter to the king.

When star-moon Kingdom received this news, they were also filled with shock.

A general had been beheaded, a town had been taken over, and a dynasty had been established. This was simply going against star-moon kingdom.

However, they didn’t make a move before they had a clear understanding of their opponent’s strength.

This caused the surroundings of dragon-phoenix city to be filled with spies from star-moon kingdom.

A town had been seized, and a general had been killed. This matter couldn’t be resolved so easily. A war was inevitable.

“A bunch of damned fellows!”

Wang Xian thought of Zhang Fengying’s family and a hint of anger appeared on his face. “Kill all the spies of star-moon Kingdom!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao’s voice was heard and immediately disappeared from the surroundings.

Wang Xian had arrived in dragon-phoenix city for more than half a month. The city walls of Shenghai town had already been demolished.

Dragon-phoenix city needed to be expanded. As the future Imperial City, the future imperial capital, Feng Luan was preparing to expand it wantonly.

One could see hundreds of thousands of people transporting stone materials.

With the protection of the formation, it didn’t matter whether the city walls were there or not.

“Sir Wang!”

“Hello, Sir Wang!”

Wang Xian had just flown to the side of Dragon Phoenix city when he heard respectful voices.

They looked at Wang Xian and then looked at Guan Shuqing and the rest who were beside Wang Xian. Their faces were filled with curiosity.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head with a smile. His gaze swept across the surroundings.

“As expected of the Empress. Everything is in perfect order!”

Wang Xian praised in his heart. He flew directly to the location of the mayor’s residence. In the future, it would be the royal palace and the Imperial Palace!

Flying was prohibited in dragon-phoenix city, even for the city guards.

However, to others, Wang Xian was an exception.

Even the leader of the city guards, Yan Wenshan, who was at level two of the Seethrough void stage, would not say anything.

After all, this young man was a very special case in their eyes.

His status could not even be compared to the loyal old servant of the Empress.

Furthermore, this city was a gift from him to the empress.

“Feng!”

“Sister Feng!”

Wang Xian, Guan Shuqing, and the rest shouted as they landed in the city Lord’s mansion.

The few girls’voices were filled with joy!
