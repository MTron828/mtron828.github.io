Translator: 5496903

“What a terrifying explosion. What happened inside?”

“Hiss, when this black space appeared, the terrifying attacks inside came wave after wave!”

Around the sword mansion, when the stars exploded, everyone’s bodies trembled as they looked inside in fear.

They all took a deep breath, their faces filled with shock.

The appearance of that mysterious person was simply too shocking.

“Ah!”

At this moment, in the space of light and darkness, the Meng Clan Elder, who had been struck by the starburst, was struck by a terrifying explosion.

The defense that had just been gathered around him instantly collapsed, and the terrifying attack of the three elements of metal, fire, and earth directly struck his body.

It was like the explosion of a meteorite, and the terrifying attack caused his arm to instantly disappear.

The void penetration armor on his chest lasted for less than a second before it collapsed. Following that, his body began to collapse.

His eyes were wide open and filled with fear. His body collapsed at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Bang

In the end, his body exploded and dissipated safely.

“No, eighth brother...”

The expression of the Meng clan elder who was using the heavenly wind sword changed drastically.

“Now, it’s Your Turn!”

Wang Xian revealed a smile when he saw an elder of the Meng clan being killed.

Light and darkness were usually able to produce a terrifying effect during a battle.

After the first level void interpretation expert used his dharma idol, he would need at least a period of time before he could use it again.

Without his strongest technique, he was no match for Wang Xian.

“Gilded Gold Sword Pursuit!”

Wang Xian did not hesitate at all. With his abundant energy, he did not even use up half of it. The demon-free sword in his hand emitted a golden glow and attacked him directly.

“How is this possible...”

The last remaining Meng Clan Elder was extremely terrified. When he faced Wang Xian again, a hint of fear flashed across his face.

That’s right, fear.

This mysterious person in front of him was simply too strange. His attacks contained at least two attributes. Moreover, he could unleash unimaginable attacks from time to time.

This caused a hint of fear to surge up in his heart.

This kind of bottomless enemy was the most terrifying.

Looking at the gilded gold sword that was attacking him, he could only grit his teeth and execute his supernatural ability to meet it head-on.

Wang Xian moved forward and brandished the long sword in his hand. He attacked continuously.

In the golden water sword principle, there were not only the combined attacks of the two elements of the metal and water, but also the usage of sword moves.

With complete control of Wang Xian, the energy of the metal and water intersected continuously, forcing the Meng clan elder to defend passively.

“No, I’m not his match. Run!”

The Meng Clan Elder’s expression changed drastically.

“Wind Shadow!”

His body moved. After receiving Wang Xian’s attack, he fled into the distance.

“It’s too late to escape!”

Wang Xian revealed a cold expression. He shook the longsword in his hand and shouted, “Water tomb!”

The binding dual-attribute combined attack instantly restrained his speed. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Take another move from me, flame piercing gold!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with excitement as he stabbed the demon-free sword in his hand forward.

Flame piercing gold was the second three-attribute combined attack that Wang Xian had comprehended.

“Oh no, why does he have so many terrifying killing moves!”

The last elder of the Meng clan was drenched in cold sweat. He had already used his dharma idol and had no way to deal with this terrifying attack.

He quickly dodged to the side.

However, the moment he dodged, the flame pierced through the gold and exploded. It split into dozens of small swords. The small swords covered the front and attacked rapidly.

“Wind, possess!”

He gritted his teeth and roared. His clothes whistled and emitted a rustling sound. A strong wind attribute surrounded his entire body.

He tried his best to Dodge Wang Xian’s attack.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

When the small swords attacked, it was another terrifying threat of death.

“Explode!”

His face was livid. His body shook and the armor on his body went up to meet the swords.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The armor of the first level of the Seethrough realm went up against the small swords and quickly collapsed. The power of the flame penetrating gold continued to attack him.

The last clan elder of the Meng Clan had a face full of shock. The long sword in his hand stood in front of him, blocking his vital points.

“Bang Bang Bang!”

The small sword landed on his long sword, causing his arm to tremble violently.

The position that was not blocked by the long sword was directly pierced through by the terrifying flame piercing gold small sword.

However, for the experts of the first rank of the profound void martial stage, as long as they did not hit their vital points, they would not die so easily.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

Another five or six small swords landed on his longsword. His entire face was extremely pale as he flew backward rapidly.

When the fire penetrating gold attack had completely dissipated, he spat out a large mouthful of fresh blood.

The fresh blood mixed with his internal organs as he tried his best to escape into the distance.

He wanted to survive. He wanted to escape.

“A dying struggle!”

Wang Xian’s cold voice sounded from behind him. The body of this insightful emptiness realm expert trembled slightly.

His entire body was filled with fresh blood. There was no time to heal him.

“PFFT!”

Wang Xian’s figure flashed and appeared directly behind him. The demon-free sword in his hand pierced through his heart directly.

“Buzz!”

At this moment, the surrounding light and dark energy were completely exhausted.

The darkness that covered a two-kilometer radius disappeared.

The sun shone brightly. In the Void, the black demon-free sword in Wang Xian’s hand was frozen. It pierced through the elder of the Meng clan.

When the darkness disappeared, everyone saw this scene.

Along with this shocking scene, there were the corpses of more than 30 experts of the Meng clan on the ground.

There was also the corpse of another void interpretation expert.

As for that mysterious young man, there wasn’t the slightest bit of blood or injury on his body.

Under the gazes of the surrounding crowd, the long sword in his hand was gently pulled out.

The corpse of another insightful emptiness realm expert of the Meng clan fell towards the ground.

“Bang!”

The corpse fell onto the ground with a heavy sound, as if it had smashed into everyone’s heart.

Two insightful emptiness realm level one experts had fallen!

They had been killed by a mysterious swordsman!

More than 200 elite members of the Meng clan had been easily killed.

“Gulp!”

Some of the people around couldn’t help but gulp as they looked at the mysterious figure in shock.

“So powerful. He killed two rank one void interpretation experts by himself. Most importantly, his voice and figure make him look so young!”

One of the girls widened her eyes and mumbled.

“Bang!”

“Senior, thank you for saving me again. Thank you for your Grace!”

At this moment, Ren Xingchen kneeled on the ground and bowed respectfully to Wang Xian.

“Senior, can you take me as your disciple? Can you let me follow you? I’m willing to do anything for you!”

He raised his head, full of respect, eyes full of desire said.
