On the commercial planet of Tianshan, when the chaos rose and the members of the Dragon Palace attacked the disciples of the Tianshan Sword sect and the guards of the commercial planet of Tianshan!

Because of the sudden attack, a large number of disciples of the Tianshan Sword sect were killed!

At the same time, there were also the buildings on the commercial planet of Tianshan!

In the sky above the core city of the Tianshan Sword sect, the experts of the Tianshan Sword sect who sensed the chaos immediately flew over from the sky. Their eyes were filled with violent killing intent!

As the Sky Mountain business planet, their defenses naturally couldn’t be underestimated!

There were undying level 7 warriors guarding all year round, however today, because of the attack on the Dragon Palace, there were no such warriors guarding the Sky Mountain Business Planet!

Even so, there were 3 undying level 6 warriors, over 10 undying level 5 warriors and over 100 God Kings!

“Rumble Rumble Rumble!”

In the sky, a huge amount of power shot up into the sky. Their eyes were filled with killing intent as they stared at the members of the Dragon Palace who were here to cause trouble!

“Leave them all here, Kill!”

An Elder’s face was filled with rage. Letting the members of the Dragon Palace charge into the Sky Mountain Business Planet to cause trouble was a huge humiliation to them!

“The experts of the Tianshan Sword sect are here!”

“The experts and disciples of the Dragon Palace are also very powerful. They can charge into the commercial planet of Tianshan. However, their people are still too weak. If they run too slowly, they will be left here!”

“The Dragon Palace wants to launch a sneak attack against the six big forces. After all, although the Dragon Palace is no match for the six big forces, the defense of the dragon star is relatively strong!”

The people on the Tianshan business planet whispered to each other when they saw this scene!

“Although the sneak attack has a great impact on the six forces, the Dragon Palace will suffer a great loss if they fight too many times!”

Some experts thought to themselves as they looked forward!

There were more than 10,000 eternal lord-level experts of the Dragon Palace, but how many of these 10,000 eternal lord-level disciples could escape this time?

The Warriors of the Sky Mountain Sword sect had practically used their laws to seal the entire planet!

“Over 100 god Kings Huh, Hehe, stop them!”

On a part of the Sky Mountain Business Planet, Ao Qi Tian’s gaze swept over, ordering his subordinates around!

“Yes!”

Immediately, over 100 Undying Emperors flew out!

“Hahaha, if you want to kill our disciples, today we will destroy your Sky Mountain Business Planet!”

A member of the Dragon Palace roared and said with a murderous look on his face!

His voice instantly echoed throughout the Sky Mountain Business Planet!

“What? The experts of the Dragon Palace didn’t Take Action!”

“Oh no, there are still experts of the Dragon Palace. Damn it, our shop is going to be destroyed!”

“The Dragon Palace is taking revenge crazily!”

The customers on the Sky Mountain Business Planet quickly hid to the side, their faces full of fear!

“Damn it, a bunch of Rascals from the Dragon Palace. When we attacked you, they hid in the planet and didn’t dare to come out. Now, they dare to be arrogant? Die!”

In the sky, the experts of the Tianshan Sword sect saw the sudden appearance of more than a hundred godly kings from the Dragon Palace, and their faces instantly turned ugly!

“Their strength is about the same as ours. Notify the sword king and the others immediately!”

“Shit, activate the Sky Mountain Sword sect planet protection, we can’t let them destroy the planet, we’ll hold them off and request for reinforcements from the sect!”

The Sky Mountain Sword Sect Warriors’expressions instantly darkened as they growled!

The Dragon Palace had many undying godly monarchs attacking them, but based on the Sky Mountain Sword Sect’s strength, they weren’t any weaker than the Dragon Palace!

Therefore, what they needed to do now was to ask the Patriarch of the sect, sword emperor, and the others to come and support them!

And they would try their best to stall these damn guys!

“Kill, Kill, Kill!”

The members of the Dragon Palace stared at the experts of the Sky Mountain Sword sect and immediately attacked!

“Suppress them!”

The elder of the Sky Mountain Sword sect roared and attacked with his sharp swords!

“Hehe!”

On a part of the Sky Mountain Business Planet, Ao Qi Tian and the rest were all smiling as they watched this scene!

“The Sky Mountain Sword sect has a total of five undying level 7 warriors, only three know the exact location, the other two don’t know, I hope those two can hurry over!”

Ao Qi Tian muttered, quietly watching the battle above!

A total of over 200 undying warriors fighting and killing, it was definitely shocking, within a radius of a trillion km, everyone on Sky Mountain Business Planet fled in fear!

The entire sky mountain business planet was instantly engulfed in flames of war! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“This dragon palace actually sent so many warriors, if this goes on, the entire sky mountain business planet will be finished!”

“The Tian Shan sword sect is still not prepared, damn it, our losses this time are huge!”

“I never thought that Tian Shan business planet would have such a day, it’s too unsafe!”

Some god Emperor Warriors hid far away, looking at the battlefield in front with ugly expressions!

And the news of the Tian Shan business planet being attacked quickly spread through the AI!

...

“Over 100 undyings from the Dragon Palace have invaded Tian Shan business planet, this... The Dragon Palace is taking revenge!”

“This Tian Shan sword sect is too stupid, they’ve clearly reached a point of no return, yet they’re not even on guard? They actually let so many warriors from the Dragon Palace enter the business planet so easily?”

“There’s no need to be afraid of comparison, the safety of this comparison is simply too high, Tian Shan business planet was actually invaded by the warriors of the Dragon Palace!”

On the AI, all the forces had shocked expressions when they heard the news!

More than 100 undyings had invaded, this was definitely a huge blow to Tian Shan business planet!

Was Tian Shan business planet not prepared?

This was unbelievable!

“The 9th grade Sky clan business planet is in chaos too, a Dragon Palace warrior has entered again and killed many of the Sky Mountain Sword Sect Warriors!”

“The ninth-grade celestial sect is also in trouble. Holy Sh * t, is the Dragon Palace’s sneak attack so awesome? You should know that the ninth-grade celestial sect’s commercial planet was once ambushed by the Dragon Palace, and now the sneak attack has succeeded?”

Just as everyone was discussing about the Tianshan commercial planet being attacked by the Dragon Palace’s experts, news came from the ninth-grade celestial sect’s commercial planet!

When everyone heard the news, they were more than surprised!

...

As the saying went, ‘the more you swallow, the wiser you are.’The Dragon Palace had already attacked the commercial planet of the ninth-grade celestial sect once. The ninth-grade celestial sect should have been prepared and responded to it, but now they were attacked again!

Was the ninth-grade celestial sect too stupid, or was the Dragon Palace too strong?

However, the Dragon Palace was hiding under the defense of the array formation of the Dragon Star. How could they invade the two commercial planets so easily?

“Damn it, how could the Tianshan commercial planet be invaded by the Dragon Palace? How could our defense system not detect it?”

At this moment, on the planet of the Tianshan Sword Sect, the Sword King roared coldly!
