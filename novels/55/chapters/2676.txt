2677 2677 last month, world’s end, nine heavens, Duan Tian

“I heard that star lady has broken through to the immortal godly monarch level from the mystic realm. We are here to pay a visit and congratulate her!”

At the same time, in a side hall of the imperial court, a few people walked in after the star Lady had just ended her conversation with Wang Xian.

Di Hun Ge, Di Ming, Di Jiu and the rest who were in the lead walked towards her with smiles on their faces.

They were all shocked at the fact that she had broken through to the Undying Emperor realm.

“HM? Welcome, please sit!”

She looked at them, smiling. The most outstanding youth of the Imperial Court had come to visit her personally.

Things had changed.

“Hehe, Star Lady, you should know about the expedition in 10 days, I wonder how star Lady’s preparations are going?”

Di hunge smiled as he sat at the side and asked Stargirl.

“There’s nothing to prepare. Where are everyone?”

Stargirl looked at them and asked.

“We’ve already revealed our strength. We’re considered the youngest in this expedition, and our strength is only ordinary. We’d like to come over and discuss this matter with you, Stargirl. When the time comes, why don’t we join forces?”

Di hunge looked at her and said.

“Of course. We can take care of each other if we fight together.”

Di hunge nodded slightly. She pondered for a moment and said, “I may not have many people on my side. Wang Xian... Yes, the Dragon King will send some people to help me.”

As she spoke, she looked at di Hunge and the rest.

This expedition was not a simple battle but a life-and-death battle. If di Hunge and the rest wanted to join forces, Di Hunge and the rest would naturally not refuse.

In terms of connections and information, Di Hunge and the others were much stronger.

“Will the Dragon Palace send people? Congratulations, Stargirl. I guess you’ve booked the number one achievement of our generation again!”

When di Hunge and the others heard Stargirl’s words, they looked at each other and said with envy.

“It’s not like the Dragon Palace will send too many experts.”

Stargirl was slightly stunned, shook her head and said with a smile.

“With the Dragon Palace’s strength, it’s enough to send a few warriors over.”

Di Ming said.

“Is that so?”

Star Lady was stunned.

“Star Lady, don’t you know the exact strength of the Dragon Palace?”

Di Hun Ge and the others saw star Lady’s expression and said in shock.

“Right now, the Demon Island’s Northern line has been lost. However, the Dragon Palace’s reputation is huge in the northern line. The Dragon Palace and the great sect killed eight undying level 9 abyss species last month. The Ai says that with the Dragon Palace’s strength, they can at least fight seven or eight undying level 9 warriors.”

“Right now, the Dragon Palace’s strength in the great sect is considered pretty good.”

“This time the Dragon King said to send a few people over to help you, any undying level 7, star Lady, your power is already strong enough, far surpassing the previous emperors and princesses!”

The few of them continued enviously.

“I just came out of seclusion, I don’t know about this yet.”

Emperor Star Lady’s eyes flickered as she shook her head. She was also slightly surprised.

Why was the strength of the Dragon Palace so strong? This improvement was too fast!

In the main Dragon Palace of the southern star system, Wang Xian stood in front of the dragon transformation pool. He smiled as he watched the last batch of members of the Dragon Palace improve.

Until today, the Dragon Palace had one peak immortal king, 10 level 9,47 level 8, and nearly 200 level 7.

Currently, the weakest in the Dragon Palace was the eternal God Lord Level 8.

The number of immortal kings had reached around 85,000.

The strength of the Dragon Palace had reached an unprecedented level.

“Get all the members of the Dragon Palace to train hard in the Dragon Palace to improve their combat ability. Send the fire hammer clan to the Dragon Peak to forge the divine weapon.”

Wang Xian said to Prime Minister Gui.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui replied immediately.

Wang Xian’s figure moved and he arrived at the inviting Moon planet immediately.

He flew to the Dragon Peak at the side and saw that the heaven array was setting up formations on it.

As the core of the Dragon Peak was a divine tree at the peak of the Immortal King Realm, this was the last upgrade of the Dragon Peak. It had reached its limit.

Standing on the command platform, Wang Xian looked at the void in front of him.

In the next few days, following the planets of the northern front, Wang Xian and the rest flew towards the center of the Demon Island.

Five days later, when Wang Xian was standing on dragon star, he could see the life planet in front of him. He could see some powerhouses and spaceships shuttling through the void.

The surrounding starry sky was also bustling with activity.

...

“Master!”

“We are about to arrive at the center of the Demon Island. Last month, the chief and the rest asked if you would like to go with them to meet another group of forces.”

At this moment, bei Shuang flew over and said to Wang Xian.

“To meet other forces?”

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment before nodding. “Alright, Shall We Go Now?”

“Yes, Master.”

Bei Shuang nodded her head.

Both of them moved and flew forward immediately.

“Dragon King!”

At the front, the Great Sect, Beichuan sect, Dragon Python group, ancient God dynasty, and some other powerhouses shouted when they saw Wang Xian.

“Everyone, follow me!”

...

In front of a group of more than twenty people, an old man made an inviting gesture and immediately stood on a small island in front of them.

The small island had a circumference of about ten kilometers and was suspended in the sky.

“Many thanks to everyone from the horizon.”

The sect master of last month said indifferently and landed on the small island.

The rest of the people also landed on it. The island immediately flew forward.

“In a while, the forces of the Demon Island will probably all be here. They will discuss the alliance and the following matters.”

The sect leader of last month spoke to everyone.

“Master, there are four major sects on the Demon Island. They are last month, horizon, jiuxiao, and Duan Tian. Last month and Duan Tian are about the same level of strength. Jiuxiao and horizon are much stronger. There are experts at the peak of the Godly King realm guarding them.”

Bei Shuang transmitted her voice to Wang Xian from the side.

Wang Xian nodded slightly. He knew about last month’s horizon, jiuxiao, and Duan Tian.

“End of the world.”

He muttered to himself as a hint of killing intent flashed in his eyes.

According to the lady from the Emperor Star, the end of the world was the organization that went after Qing Yue and the rest.

“I need to confirm it.”

He thought to himself as his eyes sparkled.

“It’s your turn.”

“Everyone, follow me.”

Not long after, the island was suspended in the sky above a planet. The old man who welcomed them moved and flew towards the location below.

Wang Xian and the rest immediately followed behind him.

Right below them was an area shrouded in gray fog.

One could vaguely see some figures below.

“The members of the great sect from last month are here!”

Just as they were about to land, a voice rang out.

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the surroundings. Hundreds of people were sitting around him and were looking at them as well
