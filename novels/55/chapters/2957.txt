Chapter 2958: terrifying demonic evil from the Chimei region

“15 black dots, how can there be so many? This…”

Wang Xian and the Heaven Array looked at these black dots and were slightly shocked.

The Heaven Array’s detection array compass, the red one represented the ones whose strength was lower than his. It was the demonic evil that was below level three celestial thearch, including level three celestial thearch.

And the black one represented the demonic evil that was above level three celestial thearch.

!!

Above level three of celestial thearch?

Such existences could easily destroy the entire glazed domain and the entire bright starry sky in the past.

This… why did fifteen of them suddenly appear?

In the chimei domain in the past, some disciples of the glazed domain could enter to gain experience.

Now, there were actually so many terrifying existences inside!

“Fortunately, I didn’t rush over rashly. Otherwise, I might really be in danger!”

Wang Xian pursed his lips. He stared at the last two black dots and looked at the sky array.

“Level five celestial thearch. These two black dots represent level five celestial thearch!”

The sky array took a deep breath as well. It was shocked.

“Where in the chimei territory are these ten black dots located, an lie?”

He stared at an lie and asked.

“I teleport according to the distance. These black dots are in the deepest part of the chimei territory. Where are the level five celestial thearch demons?”

“Isn’t that great? I can still come and go as I Please!”

An lie was slightly shocked in his heart, but he said proudly.

A level five void God realm demonic beast posed no threat to him.

Naturally, he couldn’t threaten a level five void God realm demonic beast.

“The deepest part is fine, fine!”

Wang Xian heaved a sigh of relief. His eyes sparkled as he said, “With an lie around, it might not be a bad thing for us to have so many powerful demonic beasts!”

“That’s right. An lie can teleport us to the deepest part of the demon lair in an instant. As long as we kill the demons in the demon lair quickly, the demons in the other demon lairs will not be able to discover the situation here!”

“We can devour the chimei territory bit by bit and increase the strength of the Dragon Palace quickly!”

“According to the detection on this formation, there are thousands of celestial thearch-level demons in the chimei territory.”

The eyes of the Heaven Formation were glowing.

Although he did not understand why there were so many terrifying existences in the chimei region, it was not necessarily a bad thing for the Dragon Palace.

“An lie, let’s take action immediately. Teleport to the nearest demon lair and check out the strength of the demonic beasts there. We will start from the edge and clear them out bit by bit.”

Wang Xian immediately instructed an lie.

“Dragon King, the few thousand demon caves nearby are very weak. I can destroy them all. I will bring you there!”

An lie said immediately.

Wang Xian nodded.

“Let’s Go!”

An lie said. The next moment, their figures disappeared and appeared in a cave. This cave was much smaller than the one Wang Xian and the rest had obtained. The aura of the demonic beasts inside was also very weak.

“They are all a bunch of weaklings. There’s no need for you to do anything, Dragon King. I will take care of them!”

After an lie said that, his figure disappeared instantly.

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

With his terrifying teleportation power, he began to slaughter crazily.

When you saw him raise a dagger in his hand, the next moment, he teleported to the top of a demonic aura’s head. The dagger sank into it.

Wang Xian and the rest could only keep up with his speed with their eyes.

“The strongest demon here is only at level three of the Godly King realm. He’s a little weak!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across and said.

“This should be the chimei territory that the glazed domain knows about. The demon in the demon cave isn’t very strong.”

The Heaven Array said.

Wang Xian nodded.

“Dragon King, all the demons have been taken care of!”

A few minutes later, an lie appeared in front of him and said to Wang Xian.

“HMM, try absorbing this altar and see how much it can improve!”

Wang Xian said to him.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

An lie nodded his head. His eyes lit up as he teleported to the altar immediately.

He stood on the altar and closed his eyes slightly. He could see the patterns on the altar as they crawled towards his body.

Slowly, all the patterns entered his body.

“It’s too little. This is simply too little. My strength has not changed at all. The teleportation distance has only increased by a few thousand kilometers!”

Soon, an Lie’s dissatisfied voice was heard.

“That’s enough. Ao crab, put a devouring dragon here and devour this nest and the demon cave. Let’s go to the next place!”

Wang Xian said. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Ao he nodded and immediately ordered a devouring dragon with the combat strength of a divine king level eight to devour this demon lair.

Following that, an lie led them into the second demon lair.

The demon lair was still very weak. An lie quickly cleaned it up by himself.

After AO he put the weakest devouring dragon to devour, they continued to move.

In the next half a month, they began to hunt one devil lair after another.

In the next half a month, they destroyed 10,000 devil lairs, obtained a large number of evil demon corpses, and more than 10,000 devil lairs.

However, although they destroyed more devil lairs, all the resources added together were not even one-twentieth of the resources of one of the devil lairs of the evil demon leaders.

Out of these 10,000 demon caves, only the hundreds of demon caves at the back had peak-stage godly monarch-level demons. The rest were below peak-stage godly monarch-level.

Such resources were no longer of interest to the current Dragon Palace.

“Dragon King, there are still more than 800 demon caves. The rest of the demon caves will all have godly monarch-level demons!”

An lie sensed the remaining coordinates and reported to Wang Xian.

“We have finally arrived at the celestial thearch-level demon caverns. There are too few resources in those demon caverns ahead!”

Wang Xian nodded and smiled.

“Let’s begin then. I hope the energy on the altar in the demon caverns can increase my strength!”

An lie mumbled and disappeared with Wang Xian and the rest in an instant.

When they reappeared, the Heaven Formation waved its arm and attacked immediately.

“Pu!”

In the deepest part of the Demon Cave, the rank one celestial emperor Yao Xie was killed by the sky array before he could react!

“Leave no one alive!”

Ao crab ordered his subordinates around him.

In an instant, ten rank three celestial emperor devouring dragons charged toward Yao Xie in the demon cave.

In front of ten rank three celestial emperor devouring dragons, such a weak demon cave did not even have the power to resist.

“I’ve absorbed over 10,000 altars, I hope I can level up this time!”

An lie came to the top of the altar, looking at the patterns surging into his body.

“Ka Ka Ka!”

Very quickly, an Lie’s body let out a crisp sound, an even more powerful energy shot out from his body.

“Hahaha, I’ve leveled up, I’ve finally leveled up!”

An excited voice came out from an Lie’s mouth.

After absorbing so much power from the altar, his strength had increased from level 9 immortal king to Peak Immortal King.

It wasn’t easy!

Wang Xian and the rest looked over and smiled. The stronger an lie was, the faster his reaction speed would be. The faster his teleportation speed would be, the further the distance would be.

His improvement was still very useful.
