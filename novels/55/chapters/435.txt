Chapter 436: The Champion Of The Younger Generation (1)

“Brother!”

While Wang Xian was watching the Saints and Saintesses from various powerful forces walking in, he heard Xiao Yu calling him from his side.

“Let’s get in too!” Wang Xian said to Guan Shuqing and the girls before walking towards where Xiao Yu was.

Xiao Yu followed the crowd from the Thistles and Thorns Sect and waved towards Wang Xian and the girls.

“Let’s go. It’s about time!”

Wang Xian scrutinized Xiao Yu and Elder Fang from top to bottom.

Both of them were wearing uniformly black attire which resembled trimmed armor. They also each had a black longsword in their hands.

The skin-tight armor perfectly traced their figures. It was especially so for Elder Fang who had a great figure. The black armor made her resemble the goddess of darkness.

A dark charming aura emanated naturally from her. Her curves were what every man would desire.

“The outfit is pretty good!” Wang Xian took a few more glances before complimenting Xiao Yu.

“Hehe! Don’t you think that I have the looks of a heroine now?” Xiao Yu swung the bone sword in her hand as she joked.

“Since it’s black, you look more like the Dongfang Bubai!” [1]

“Hehe. Just watch how I’ll go on a killing spree today and clinch the number one spot on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart!” Xiao Yu remarked proudly.

“Let’s go!” Wang Xian chuckled before walking in.

The armor-like outfit was formed from their extended skeletal structure. With their armor alone, anyone under the Half-Step to Dan Realm wouldn’t be able to hurt them at all.

“Eh! Isn’t that guy with the golden fan that mysterious young man from before?” At this juncture, a young man near Wang Xian stared at him and asked.

The crowd looked over and started observing Wang Xian curiously.

“This... This golden fan teenager seems to be Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown. The one beside him is the Saintess of the Thistles and Thorns Sect, Wang Yu. She’s also the sister of Miracle Doctor Wang. It has to be! He must be Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown. Just look at the longsword at his waist!”

“The mysterious golden fan teenager is Miracle Doctor Wang! It’s no surprise now that he could defeat Bei Wuying who has just reached the Inborn Realm. He’s Miracle Doctor Wang, the number one on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart!”

“Majestic and breathtaking. If it wasn’t for Xiao Ran from the Xiao Clan, Miracle Doctor Wang would be the youngest Inborn expert!”

This time, everyone’s attention had fallen on Wang Xian.

“Brother, with the folded fan and your five-colored divine dragon shirt, you look really flirtatious!” Xiao Yu teased him.

“What do you know about it?” Wang Xian chuckled.

His white casual attire had the printing of five-colored divine dragons. At the chest area, there were the words “Dragon Sect” embroidered.

Mo Qinglong had it custom made.

Rumble!

“What the... What’s that!”

“Inborn spiritual beasts! Oh my god! They are using two Inborn spiritual beasts to pull the carriage!”

At this moment, the group heard a commotion from behind them. Following which, exclaims of the crowd could be heard.

Wang Xian and the group looked over and were shocked to see a carriage moving rapidly towards them.

Two golden seahorses with terrifying aura were pulling the carriage. The two golden seahorses were over two meters large and they didn’t have legs.

Below the golden seahorses, there was a ball of blue seawater. The seawater pulled their bodies as they moved rapidly forward.

Two ropes were tied to their backs and were connected to a carriage.

A young man sat on it with exquisite golden curtains in front of him to block the dust and sunlight.

Behind the carriage, two middle-aged men followed closely. They had terrifying vibes around them.

“It’s the young lord of Sea Serpent Island!”

“He’s the only son, Hai Long, of the Lord of Sea Serpent Island who was widely regarded as the second strongest in the country!”

“The entrance of the young lord of Sea Serpent Island is too extravagant! Two Inborn spiritual beasts to pull his carriage and another two Inborn experts following behind. Even the Saint and Saintess of Sacred Clans and Sacred Sects couldn’t hold a candle to him!”

“He’s the only son of the second strongest man in the Underworld. The resources he enjoys are even more than the Saints of the Sacred Sects. If it wasn’t for the sudden appearance of Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown, the number one spot on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart would still belong to this young lord!”

The crowd was discussing fervently. As their eyes fell on the young lord of Sea Serpent Island, they turned next to Wang Xian and made a comparison.

“What do you guys think? Between the young lord of Sea Serpent Island and Miracle Doctor Wang, who is stronger?”

“My guess would be the young lord of Sea Serpent Island. After all, he’s the only son of the second strongest man in the Underworld. His strength isn’t something that Miracle Doctor Wang could match!”

“Just take a look at this line-up. It’s not even a fair comparison!”

“Although Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown is powerful, there are too many supreme talents this year. I’m guessing that Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown would at most make it to the top five!”

“That’s my guess too!”

“I’ll bet on the young lord of Sea Serpent Island to clinch the championship in a while!”

The surrounding crowd was enthusiastic about the event.

“What an ostentatious display!” Xiao Yu looked towards the young lord of Sea Serpent Island and exclaimed in shock.

“Let’s go!” Wang Xian chuckled before walking in.

Behind them, the young lord of Sea Serpent Island followed and entered the area.

More and more people were heading in. When those who were here for a show saw the time, they also headed in the same direction.

More and more people had gathered at the entrance. At this moment, five young men walked forward without expressions.

Soon, another seven young men walked in.

In the end, other than some random people entering the place, another group of thirty young men also headed in.

“Wow, what a huge area.” When Wang Xian and the group entered, Xiao Yu instantly exclaimed in shock.

There was an incomparably huge field with a twenty-meter-tall stone monument in the middle.

That’s the Named Cliff!

The top twenty supreme talents would earn the rights to leave their name on it based on the rankings.

Around it, there were several elevated arenas to be used for battles.

At the two sides, there were four exceptionally huge service counters.

The competition of the supreme talents would always attract the strongest members of the younger generation to participate. The first reason being one could become famous and the second was the rewards.

The organizer of this competition would also be receiving bets for the competition. Everyone would be able to place their bets.

The organizer would give all spiritual stones, spiritual grass and other items that were earned in the event to the supreme talents.

Besides that, if the challenger were to lose in the Outstanding Young Heroes Competition, he’d have to pay a price. The price could be the weapon one was using or any other items.

One could even get an Inborn Spiritual Weapon here.

Moreover, if one party was dead, everything that belonged to the defeated would be transferred to the victor.

Because of this rule, the battles of the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart were a lot more brutal.

However, this was the Underworld. Conflicts would never be lacking. If one had mediocre battle strength, he wouldn’t become a supreme talent even if he had amazing gifts.

“Should we go place our bets?”

Xiao Yu looked around her and saw a substantial number of people gathering before the service counters. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Let’s go and take a look!” Wang Xian smiled and walked towards the direction.

When they had just entered the place, the group of young men had noticed their group.

To put it more accurately, they had noticed Wang Xian.

The title of the number one on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart still belonged to him!
