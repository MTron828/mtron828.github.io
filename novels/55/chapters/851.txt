“Hiss!”

The location of the Yuwen clan was not very far from Xuanyuan City. At night, when a sun-like object rose, when that earth-shaking sound rang out.., everyone in Xuanyuan ancient city woke up.

Many immortal gods and disciples of the immortal sects who had not left because the sky was already dark tonight immediately flew out of the room when they heard this sound and looked towards the location of the sound.

When they flew out, they saw a shocking scene.

The Yuwen clan’s strongest expert, the Yuwen clan’s supreme elder, was actually knocked down from the void by the finger of the elder who was sitting on the divine throne and emitting divine light.

He did not have the slightest ability to resist.

The Yuwen clan’s Supreme Elder, who was currently the strongest expert in the east, fell heavily into the distance.

The power of a single finger. Just the power of a single finger.

Everyone’s faces were filled with shock as they watched this scene. The grand grand elder of the Yuwen clan had actually been defeated with a single finger. In fact, they felt that if the deity king hadn’t held back, he would have been killed!

This made them think of the day when the Dragon King’s eyes had shot out two flames, and in the end, he had killed two highgods.

“How terrifying. He knocked down the grand elder of the Yuwen clan with a single finger. Who is stronger, the Dragon King or him?”

“This is a true God. His divine might is vast and mighty, and his divine light shines through the heavens and earth. Those gods of the western divine realm are simply too insignificant compared to this old man!”

“Divine King, is this how terrifying a divine king is? As expected of the king of gods, the most powerful expert of the West!”

Seeing it with their own eyes, everyone felt their insignificance. This godly king was too powerful.

“Godly King vs Dragon King, Dragon King has finally met his true enemy!”

Everyone sighed in their hearts. After the Dragon King’s performance today, they thought that the Dragon King was the strongest existence. However, compared to the godly king, it was hard to say who was stronger.

“The Dragon King has killed my Yuwen clan’s daughter-in-law. Today, my Yuwen clan swears that we will definitely destroy the Dragon King. Otherwise, my Yuwen clan will be destroyed!”

After about half an hour of silence in the night, another roar sounded from the sky and spread throughout China.

The two voices represented the complete alliance between the Yuwen clan and the Nordic divine realm. They were determined to completely destroy the Dragon King.

This news caused the silent night to boil. It became a sleepless night.

“Analyzing the Dragon King’s forces, before the spiritual energy recovers, the Dragon Palace has eighteen immortal gods, a group of infant realm and half-step immortal God powerhouses. According to their overall strength, the Dragon Palace has at least thirty immortal gods. Thirty might be a little less. It should be between forty to fifty. Fifty is the most!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“As for the Yuwen clan and the Northern European divine realm, the Yuwen clan has twenty-five immortals, and the Northern European divine realm has at least sixty immortals. This time, the divine king Okudin led all the experts of the divine realm out. When the two sides join forces, there are no less than eighty-five immortal god experts. This is a huge crisis for the Dragon King!”

“Although the Dragon King is very strong, the divine king is not weak either. He defeated the Yuwen clan’s supreme elder with one finger. His strength is definitely not lower than the Dragon King. The Divine King under his banner is stronger!”

“This is really a huge crisis for the Dragon King. Last time, the Dragon King mobilized the Dragon Palace’s forces to destroy the Holy Doctor Holy Medicine Immortal sect. Will there be other forces this time?”

“It’s obviously the alliance between the Nordic Divine Realm’s divine king and the Yuwen clan that is stronger. After all, it’s the alliance of two major forces. There’s also the Divine King, a terrifying expert. The Dragon King is doomed!”

Late at night, the entire jianghu internet was bustling with activity. Everyone was talking about the Yuwen clan and the Norse celestial realm’s declaration of war against the Dragon King.

The daughter of the Divine King was killed at the wedding. The two major forces would not let the Dragon King off.

This time, it was another war of the century.

Even after this war, it would decide the division of the forces on Earth.

More people were optimistic about the forces of the divine king and the Yuwen clan. Now, almost everyone was a warrior.

In the past, many ordinary people had only heard of the Dragon King’s deeds and had never seen him in person.

However, the king of gods was different. Ever since the spiritual energy was released, the king of all gods had been well-known throughout the entire earth.

He was known as a true God.

When the sky lit up, Wang Xian stretched lazily from his room on the floating island and came to the living room.

“Brother, did you hear the voice yesterday?”

Xiao Yu and Feng Lingtian were sitting in the living room. Ling Xiao did not leave immediately either.

The incident yesterday had a huge impact on them. Killing the daughter of the godly monarch on the spot and making an enemy out of the strongest alliance on Earth made him a little apprehensive and worried.

Now, the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect and the Dragon Palace could be considered as in-laws.

“I heard it. How could I not hear it?”

Wang Xian walked to the table nonchalantly. Xiao Yu immediately ran to the kitchen to bring some breakfast over.

“Brother, they are too arrogant. They even wanted to destroy you. HMPH, they are courting death!”

Xiao Yu said angrily. She had been angry for a long time about what happened to Philomena the day before.

“They should be holding a funeral now. Hehe, when they are done with the coffin, we will go over and cover it for them!”

Wang Xian smiled gently.

Since the other party had already wanted to destroy him, Wang Xian would naturally not sit still. He liked to take the initiative to attack.

A wedding turned into a funeral. A funeral required a coffin. If they wanted to kill him three days later, he would go ahead and place them in the coffin.

Perfect!

In just a few days, they would go from the joy of life to great sorrow and finally walk into the grave.

It was perfect!

“Dragon King, are you taking the initiative to attack?”

Ling Xiao’s heart skipped a beat when he heard his words. “There are only six immortals in our Ling Xiao Immortal sect who can attack.”

“There’s no need.”

Wang Xian waved his hand. “My Dragon Palace can handle it!”

“The Godly king is very powerful. The Northern European divine territory and the Yuwen clan are also very powerful!”

Ling Xiao frowned and reminded him.

Even though he saw how confident Wang Xian was, Ling Xiao was not sure that the Dragon Palace would be a match for the two powerful forces.

Not only him, but everyone on earth did not believe that the Dragon King would win.

On the Jianghu website, everyone said that this would be the greatest crisis for the Dragon King and that it was very likely that he would fall.

“Don’t Worry!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly. Earlier on, he looked at the Jianghu website and saw the analysis thread.

The strength of the Norse celestial domain and the Yuwen clan’s analysis was very similar. However, it was the Dragon Palace.

Wang Xian smiled lightly. Currently, there were 280 immortal-level powerhouses in the Dragon Palace.

Just a small number of 80 plus a group of DRAKONIDS would be enough to deal with the two major forces.

As for the Godly King...

“I wonder if he has reached the transcendence realm. It would be interesting if he has reached it. If he hasn’t, then... Hehe!”

As for the information about the Godly King vs the Dragon King on the Jianghu website...

The corner of his mouth curled up slightly. He didn’t know if he had the qualifications!
