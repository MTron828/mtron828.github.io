“Brother? This hotel, you...”

When Xiao Yu saw the enthusiastic, or rather respectful, actions of the front desk receptionist, she couldn’t contain her curiosity and asked.

“Oh? This hotel belongs to a friend of mine, the Xue Family. They also have another holiday resort by the sea. This membership card was a gift from them. With this, everything will be free in this hotel and the holiday resort. Moreover, we will be able to enjoy the best service.”

Wang Xian explained to Xiao Yu nonchalantly. “I’ll find some time to bring you guys over to the holiday resort to play after tomorrow. It’s pretty good! It’s also a five-star holiday resort.”

Xiao Yu’s mouth opened and had a shocked expression.

Seeing her expression, Wang Xian caressed her head and said, “There’s nothing your brother can’t settle in Rivertown in the future. Therefore, don’t be scared. Be confident because you are my sister.”

“Brother, you are so awesome now!” Xiao Yu’s eyes shimmered as she stared at him.

“I guess I’m doing pretty alright!” Wang Xian smiled.

“Mr. Wang, we are here. This is a room we use to receive our most important guests. There will also be a personal assistant. If there’s a need, you could press the service bell and your personal assistant will arrive within two minutes.”

The beautiful female front desk receptionist brought them to the highest floor after opening the door to a room.

“Alright, thank you!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and walked in.

The entire apartment consists of three rooms and a living hall. The decorations were extremely luxurious and one could see the beautiful city center by simply drawing the curtains and looking out.

“Wow, what a huge room!” Xiao Mi looked around with surprise.

“Not bad. You guys could stay here tonight.”

Wang Xian put the things down, sat on the sofa and poured a cup of water for himself. “Take a break for now. It’s only 3 pm. Let’s go get something else in a while.”

“We are still getting more? Brother, we already have all the things we need.”

Xiao Yu sat beside him. She held on to Wang Xian’s arm and said, “Brother, you are so nice to me.”

“Great that you know your brother is nice to you! Take a 10 minute break. What we are getting in a while will be useful to me too. Moreover, I have said that we are going to spend all the money on the card.”

Wang Xian smiled.

After taking a short break, Wang Xian brought Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi out and called for a car.

“Sir, please take us to Cheyun Street,” Wang Xian said to the driver.

“Taking a look at the car exhibition?” the driver smiled at them and asked.

“Car exhibition?” Wang Xian was surprised and asked. “Sir, is there a car exhibition today?”

“Yeah, don’t you know about that? I thought you were going to the car exhibition. Today’s the last day of the exhibition. There’re quite a number of people at the car exhibition. Hehe. And a lot of beautiful models...” The driver raised his eyebrows.

“Oh? Are there a lot of cars on exhibition?” Wang Xian asked.

“Yeah, how could there not be? There’re lots of supercars. The scale of this car exhibition is really big. You will know once you see it in a while.” The driver nodded his head.

Cheyun Steet was where the 4S showrooms for cars in Rivertown were gathered. [1] Anyone who wished to buy a car in Rivertown would typically come to this place.

After alighting the car, Wang Xian brought Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi and looked ahead.

In the direction they were facing, there were many banners hanging around. The biggest one of all read “Rivertown 5th Car Exhibition.”

The exhibition hall was huge and one could see many people shopping in it. There were cars of various brands on display.

“Let’s go and get you a car. The reason why I’ve asked you to learn to drive in the summer is so you could become brother’s driver. Hehe.”

Wang Xian chuckled.

“How could you let your sister be your driver! You are so thick-skinned!” Xiao Yu rolled her eyes at him but still followed Wang Xian in.

“Isn’t that because I have no time to get a license!” Wang Xian laughed and walked ahead.

“There’re quite a number of people at this car exhibition. There’re a lot of models here too.”

Wang Xian looked around and saw many people. Some were looking at the cars while many others were looking at the car models.

In front of each car brand, there were 3-4 car models. These car models were wearing seductive clothes that complemented their great figures. The cleavage they were showing added heat to the already hot summer.

There were also quite a number of people taking photos, amongst which many were taking photos of these car models.

“Wow, there’re so many people and cars!”

Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi looked around them and were observing the surroundings in curiosity.

“This car’s look is so beautiful!”

Right ahead of Xiao Yu and at the entrance, there were several luxurious cars that were worth several million on display.

Xiao Yu pointed to a Rolls-Royce and exclaimed.

“Rolls-Royce Phantom! This car costs at least $6-7 million!”

Wang Xian looked at the Rolls-Royce and was getting a little excited too.

Men always had a love for supercars. Therefore, it was only natural that he would like such a domineering-looking car.

However, he didn’t have a license and couldn’t drive a car.

And the Rolls-Royce was clearly not suitable for Xiao Yu.

“Let’s go take a look around,” Wang Xian said to them before walking further in.

“Wow, this sports car is so cool.” Xiao Mi’s eyes lit up when she saw the Lamborghini beside her.

“Yeah. However, it would probably be hard to drive if the road conditions are bad!”

“That Benz ahead looks pretty domineering.”

“Benz G-series, the love of every man. Senior Wang Xian, why don’t you get a car like this. It would be so cool.”

Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi looked at the same car fervently as they commented raucously.

Wang Xian simply smiled and agreed with what they were commenting as they looked through the collection of cars.

This car exhibition was indeed pretty large scale. One could easily see international luxury car brands in this exhibition.

Wang Xian was trying to decide on a car to get for Xiao Yu.

He had looked up information on this a few days ago. For a girl, a Maserati would be more suitable and a top-end Maserati would cost less than $3 million.

Nonetheless, he still wanted Xiao Yu to make her own decision and would like to see what she would like to drive!

“Wow, that car is so stunning!”

“Yeah, it’s really stunning and it’s pink! That’s simply beautiful.”

At this moment, Xiao Yu exclaimed and walked ahead. Xiao Mi’s eyes followed Xiao Yu as she walked over too.

Wang Xian lifted his head and looked over. It was a pink Bentley Continental! A look at it was enough to capture the hearts of any young girl.

The elegance and luxury of a Bentley paired with its pink color made it a classic car that fair, rich and beautiful woman would prefer.

Seeing Xiao Yu’s excited expression, Wang Xian followed behind.

“Wow, stunning!”

“A Bentley! A Bentley is very expensive and would cost at least a few million. Nonetheless, this pink Bentley is really breath-taking!”

“Yeah! However, driving this car around would be a little too eye-catching.”

Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi were discussing and couldn’t help but take out their phones to take a few photos.

Wang Xian simply smiled by the side and didn’t comment. After looking at this car for several minutes, these two girls continued walking forward.

At the display area of Maserati, Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi exclaimed in unison. Girls typically preferred this car brand.

And this car model was also more suitable for a girl to drive.
