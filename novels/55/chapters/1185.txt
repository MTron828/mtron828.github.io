Chapter 1186: 1187 alchemy master? Go

Translator: 5496903

Long Xiaotian did not hide anything from Wang Xian. His identity, the strength of the Guanglong dynasty, and the young lady beside him were his younger sister, the princess of the Guanglong dynasty.

Wang Xian could tell that Long Xiaotian was trying to befriend him.

He had a good impression of this prince. No matter what, as a prince, he did not give up on fleeing when he was attacked by terrifying ferocious beasts. This was evident, he was a person who valued friendship and loyalty.

Wang Xian responded to long Xiaotian’s kindness by having a pleasant dinner.

However, the Loli princess looked at Wang Xian curiously.

In the end, she even asked if he could ride the Spirit Purple Unicorn and was dragged away by Long Xiaotian.

Wang Xian smiled. He spent seven to eight days outdoors. Although the food was not bad, it was not as pleasant as this place.

In the evening, Wang Xian went to a room that long Xiaotian had prepared for him and rested.

Lying on the soft bed, he felt very comfortable.

The next morning, Wang Xian woke up early and opened the door. He looked at Ling Zilin who was sprawled on the door and patted his head.

“Young master Wang Xian, you are awake. I will bring you to the place where you will have breakfast. The Prince asked me to tell you that we will be heading to the tomb of the humans and demons this afternoon. I hope you are not in a hurry. These are the news regarding the major forces in the tomb of the humans and demons. Some detailed information regarding the tomb of the humans and demons!”

At this moment, a beautiful maid walked over. She held a document in her hand and handed it to Wang Xian respectfully.

“Alright, Bring Me There!”

Wang Xian nodded. He took the document from the maid and looked at it.

“This long Xiaotian sure knows how to do things!”

Wang Xian followed the maid to an elegant room. There was already a sumptuous breakfast prepared on it.

Sitting at the side, he ate while reading some information about the tomb of the human-demon.

The tomb of the human-demon was located at the center of the Liuhai region. It was also the place with the most experts in the Liuhai region.

Around the tomb of the human-demon, there were five kingdoms and one dynasty. The dynasty was higher than the dynasty.

It was said that the Bloodflow dynasty was founded by the descendants of the human experts from the ancient sect, the Bloodflow sect. The Bloodflow dynasty was the only dynasty in the Liuhai region and was also the most powerful force.

Other than the blood stream empire, the more powerful factions were the Guanglong Empire, the Heavenly Sword sect, the blood stream sect, and so on.

“The Guanglong Empire is quite powerful!”

Wang Xian was slightly surprised as he read the introductions of the powerful factions one by one.

However, when he thought about how a prince had an insightful void martial artist protecting him, the power of this empire was obviously extraordinary.

After breakfast, Wang Xian sat there and sipped on his tea while looking at the information on the tomb of the demi-human. He was preparing for the search for resources.

“Peng!”

“Aiya, I failed again!”

When Wang Xian was flipping through the information, a sound suddenly came from the side, followed by a soft and tender voice.

“I failed again, I failed again. This transcendent Tier-4 medicinal pill is so difficult to refine!”

The grumbling continued. Wang Xian saw a young girl walking out from a house opposite him.

She was 1.6 meters tall and had a ponytail. Her face was dark and she pouted, looking unhappy.

There was an elixir furnace in her room.

The young girl’s name was long Luo, Long Xiaotian’s younger sister.

“Haha, Long Luo, What’s wrong? Did you fail again?”

At this moment, Long Xiaotian’s figure appeared. When he saw the black marks on his younger sister’s face, he laughed out loud.

“HMPH, this is too difficult. You’re really a scoundrel. You’re still mocking me!”

When Long Luo saw her brother mocking her, she said unhappily.

“Long Luo, your brother took out the spiritual herbs that I painstakingly planted for you to waste. You!”

Long Xiaotian walked over with a smile on his face.

“Brother Wang Xian, you’re here too? Sorry to keep you waiting. We’ll set off once all the spiritual herbs in the herb garden of wind and salt town are harvested!”

Long Xiaotian walked over immediately when he saw Wang Xian at the side.

“It’s alright. I’m not in a hurry!”

Wang Xian shook his head.

“Brother, do you want to bring all the spiritual herbs to the tomb of the transvestite to find someone to refine them? Why Don’t You Leave It to me? I Won’t charge you!”

Long Luo walked over and pulled long Xiaotian’s arm as she said with a smile.

“Just you? If I let you refine them, I’ll Cry Myself to death!”

Long Xiaotian rubbed her head and said.

“Don’t look down on me. I’ll definitely become an alchemy grandmaster in the future. When that time comes, even if you beg me, I won’t help you refine them! HMPH!”

Long Luo raised her head proudly and snorted coldly.

“Refine pills?”

Wang Xian heard the conversation between the brother and sister and recalled the three half-step void interpretation pills that long Xiaotian had given him yesterday. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The grade of the half-step void interpretation pills was already very high. It required nearly a hundred spiritual herbs of the half-step void interpretation level.

One pill could increase Wang Xian’s dragon crystal by more than 200,000 dragon crystals.

For Wang Xian, pills had always been able to increase his dragon qi by a large amount.

However, elixirs were too expensive. Last time, Wang Xian only bought more than 10,000 elixirs for more than 150 billion middle-grade spirit stones.

Among these elixirs, none of them were at the half-step void interpretation level.

One half-step void interpretation elixir was worth two to three billion middle-grade spirit stones!

Yesterday, Long Xiaotian was indeed very generous.

“Brother Long Xiaotian, you have some spiritual herbs over there. Do you need someone to refine elixirs for you?”

Wang Xian looked at him curiously and asked.

“HMM?”? “Yes, the tomb of the transvestite is our final assessment. The results of the assessment are all the forces under the control of the princes. There is a special land in wind salt town that is suitable for planting spiritual herbs. In the past, wind salt town was under the control of my mother’s family. When I came to wind salt town, my mother gave all the spiritual herbs here to me so that I could cultivate my forces. There are indeed a lot of spiritual herbs. Why do you need some spiritual herbs, brother Wang Xian?”? “Let me know. If you have it, give it to me directly!”

Long Xiaotian said with a smile.

“There’s no need. If you look for someone to refine pills, how much will you need?”

Wang Xian shook his head and asked him.

“There aren’t many experts in the Guanglong dynasty who are good at refining pills. We can only look for an alchemist from the life and Death Elixir Workshop. Two sets of ingredients will guarantee four pills. In addition, we will need to pay one tenth of the commission for each pill!”

Long Xiaotian said directly.

“Is that so? How many spiritual herbs do you have? I will refine them for you. I will give you five pills. Don’t take the Commission!”

Wang Xian looked at him and said directly.

Long Xiaotian was slightly stunned when he heard Wang Xian’s words. He looked at him with a stunned expression.

Let him refine pills?

This?

Brother Wang Xian is an alchemist?

“You? Big Brother, it is very difficult to refine pills. Moreover, the spiritual herbs that my brother has are of a very high grade. Don’t joke around!”

Long Luo looked at Wang Xian in disbelief.

It was as if she was telling him not to brag!

“That’s right, brother Wang Xian. It’s not that easy to refine pills. Our Guanglong dynasty has been nurturing for a long time but we have yet to produce a Master!”

Long Xiaotian smiled and said in disbelief.
