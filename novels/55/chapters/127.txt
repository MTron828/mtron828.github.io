“Let’s make everyone the judges for this contest. Does anyone have any issue with it?” Old Qin looked at the face-off of Wang Xian and Fang Huazi, and asked loudly.

“Sure. The winner of a contest of medical skills will be clear to tell!”

Fang Huazi looked past Old Qin and said plainly, “Medical skills are about the four diagnostic methods of observing, listening, questioning and feeling one’s pulse followed by manipulation, medicinal herbs, and acupuncture for treatment. Since we are going to compete, let’s start with these.”

Observe, listen, question and feel one’s pulse?

Wang Xian looked at him and revealed a faint smile. He knew nothing about these diagnosis methods and naturally wouldn’t be a match in these aspects.

“Troublesome. Since we are going to compete, it’s natural to cure the patient. That’s the core of medical skills. No matter how great you are in these four diagnosis methods, it’s useless if you can’t cure the patient!”

Wang Xian spoke plainly.

The surrounding hospital directors nodded their heads silently. These four diagnosis methods were frequently used a long time ago. However, in the current era, there weren’t many who specialized in these. It wasn’t that these methods weren’t important anymore, but it was because of the advancement of technology.

Whether a doctor was great or bad depended on if he could cure his patient. It was pointless to have other fanciful packaging.

“Alright, how shall we do it? When it comes to medical skills, you aren’t a match for me either!” Fang Huazi gave Wang Xian a harsh stare and said.

“We have a few members of the underworld here today and most of them have hidden injuries that have not recovered completely. Let’s see who can cure them of their injuries. I believe this wouldn’t be a problem for you, right?”

Old Xue looked at Wang Xian before turning to Fang Huazi.

Fang Huazi squinted his eyes, and looked across the people beside Old Xue before agreeing, “I don’t have an issue with it.”

“I’m fine with it too!” Wang Xian smiled and nodded his head.

“Since you guys are going to compete, you guys can use me for the contest!”

Old Duan walked out and stopped between Wang Xian and Fang Huazi. “I was injured by a poisonous palm strike 10 years ago. The poison has entered my bone marrow and I’ll have a day each month where I’ll feel worse than death.”

As Old Duan spoke, his gaze swept past Yan Zhongyuan and felt a tinge of resentment.

“I’m fine with the arrangement.” Wang Xian nodded his head directly.

Suddenly, Yan Zhongyuan, who had been staying at one side, spoke to Fang Huazi.

“Miracle Doctor Fang, I believe we should find another person. The poison palm strike on him was dealt by me when we sparred!”

“Oh, in that case, let’s find another person. Since this reckless man was injured by you, let’s forget about him.” Fang Huazi nodded his head.

“YOU...” When Old Duan heard their conversation, rage welled up to his face. His eyes burned with rage as he stared intensely at Yan Zhongyuan.

“What? Do you want another fight? However, if you lose again, it won’t end so well.”

Yan Zhongyuan looked at Old Duan with contempt and threatened.

Puff!

Old Duan’s face was seething with anger. He took a deep breath, closed his eyes and did not speak another word.

“You guys sure are asking for a lot.”

Wang Xian looked to Old Duan and said, “Old Duan, I’ll take care of your injuries. It wouldn’t be a problem.”

Old Duan’s body stiffened. His eyes jerked open as he stared at Wang Xian with joy. “Brother, can you really cure my injuries?”

“Not an issue.” Wang Xian nodded his head and replied confidently.

“Thank you. Thank you, brother!” Old Duan answered in agitation and his body was even trembling slightly from the excitement.

At this moment, Yan Zhongyuan said emotionlessly, “If you cure the opponent of the Yan Family, that would be equivalent to going against our Yan Family. You have to think about it.”

“Oh, the Yan Family!”

Wang Xian turned his head to Yan Zhongyuan and said with contempt, “So what if I’m going against the Yan Family?”

Hehe. Hehe!

When Yan Zhongyuan saw Wang Xian’s reaction, he smirked. “Interesting! Interesting! To see that there would be people willing to go against our Yan Family! You will learn about the consequences soon!”

“Is it?” Wang Xian’s eyes flickered and broke into laughter. He diverted his attention to the few martial artists and no longer paid attention to Yan Zhongyuan. “Is there anyone who wants to volunteer?”

“Let me do it! My injuries were sustained during a fight in the past. My five visceral and six bowel organs were torched by the devil technique. I once sought treatment from a disciple of Medical Saint Sect but he wasn’t able to cure me completely.” [1]

A middle-aged man stepped out and flipped up his clothes. At the location of his stomach, there was a clear palm mark.

The palm mark was filled with densely packed black dots and looked horrifying.

“Black Rain Palm!”

When Fang Huazi saw the injury on the middle-aged man, he was shocked.

“Yeah, it is the Black Rain Palm!” The middle-aged man nodded his head bitterly.

“What a creepy injury!”

“That looks horrifying! What kind of injury is that? If he was sent to our hospitals, we wouldn’t even know where to start!”

The few hospital directors exchanged gazes and were clearly shocked. They were discussing softly about the injury among themselves.

Fang Huazi took a few steps forward to take a closer look at the injuries.

“Your injuries must have been sustained three years ago. The one who fought you probably hadn’t mastered Black Rain Palm. Otherwise, you would have died on the spot. However, looking at your current situation, you wouldn’t live longer than five more years!”

“You are not able to engage in vigorous activities currently, or might not even be able to bend your back because of the injuries, which makes you feel unbearable pain!”

At this moment, Fang Huazi looked just like an intelligent old man. He stood beside the middle-aged man and explained the symptoms to him like a real master in medical skills.

“Yes, Miracle Doctor Fang is right!”

When the middle-aged man heard Fang Huazi explain all the symptoms he was facing, he became agitated. “Miracle Doctor Fang, is this curable?”

“Incredible! Just a look at it and he could tell all the symptoms of the injuries!”

“He truly lives up to the name of the Sacred Followers Guild. His medical skills are so impressive!”

“Miracle Doctor Fang Huazi’s medical skills are god-like. This young man is finished.”

Fang Huazi’s explanation was direct and succinct. This greatly impressed the crowd.

Everyone, including the hospital directors and martial artists, were looking in awe at the confident Fang Huazi.

This was why the Sacred Followers Guild was so powerful!

“Tsk. My master is an incredible existence even within the Sacred Followers Guild.”

When the juvenile heard the exclamations of the crowd, he got pleasantly contented. He looked to Wang Xian and said, “We will cripple your arms in a while. Just accept your fate without resistance!”

Fang Huazi revealed a faint smile and looked at Wang Xian with contempt. In a proud and demeaning tone, he continued, “I can cure this guy. Brat, what about you?”

Everyone’s attention had fallen on Wang Xian at this moment.

They were all here because of Old Qin and Old Xue’s invitation. With regard to this young man, they weren’t too confident about his capabilities. After all, Wang Xian was too young.

Now that he was competing with an expert from the Sacred Followers Guild, no one really had high hopes of his chances of winning.

It was especially so after they witnessed the medical skills of Fang Huazi a while ago. It was really impressive.

Even Old Qin and Old Xue were looking at Wang Xian anxiously and weren’t too certain that Wang Xian could win.

After all, the one he was competing with was from the Sacred Followers Guild!

“If you were going to administer treatment, how would you go about it and how long would you take?”

Wang Xian didn’t answer Fang Huazi directly and posed a question instead.

“I’ll be using acupuncture and medicinal herbs. I’m confident of curing him completely within two days. Brat, just stretch your arms over.”

“Think about it, I’ll give you another option. I hate that mouth of yours. You could use your tongue in exchange for your arms. Hehe, that’s a pretty good deal for you!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com
