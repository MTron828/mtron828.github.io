Chapter 2928: punitive expedition to the Machine Imperial Region 3

“Roar!”

In the first round of collision, all the cannonballs were blocked by the experts of the Dragon Palace.

Under the bombardment and defense of the experts of the Dragon Palace, none of the members were hurt.

On both sides, the nine wind divine dragons let out a furious roar.

They moved and rushed toward the battleships at a terrifying speed.

“Hong Hong Hong!”

The battleships at the front saw the terrifying speed of the nine wind god dragons and immediately launched terrifying cannon fire attacks.

Under the illumination of the cannon fire, their huge wings and green dragon scales flickered with a luster.

“Hou Hou Hou!”

However, as wind god dragons, three of them had the terrifying strength of a rank two void God Emperor. They swayed their bodies and easily dodged the attacks.

Even if they were hit, the dragon scales on their bodies could easily withstand the attacks.

“That is the divine dragon, the legendary wind god Dragon!”

On the largest battleship, the creator’s eyes flashed as he stared at the nine wind god Dragons. Looking at the analysis of the AI in his mind, his expression was ugly.

“Lord Creator, there aren’t many battleships that can threaten those nine divine dragons. Especially three of them. We need to use the mechanical emperor battleship of Lord Creator.”

“If we want to kill them, we need you to do it!”

His subordinate’s voice entered his mind, causing him to snort coldly as his cold gaze swept across the three wind dragons.

However, he didn’t do anything because he could sense that the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace was locked on to him.

He wasn’t ready for battle yet. At the very least, not all the armies from the mechanical emperor region were sent over.

This time, he only sent three-fifths of his forces.

“Machine emperor ship, Plasma Black Devil Flame, lock on and kill!”

The creator stood there and said coldly.

“Ka Ka Ka!”

Following his orders, a huge cannon hole rose from a hundred kilometers behind him.

The cannon hole emitted a black luster as it locked onto the three wind god Dragons with rank two void God emperor combat strength.

“Weng Weng Weng Weng!”

A unique sound rang out as three rays of black light shot towards the three wind god Dragons.

The three wind god Dragons instantly felt a threat coming over. They stared at the Black Devil Flame as they flapped their wings.

“Hong Hong Hong!”

At the next moment, a hurricane formed around them. The hurricane condensed into wind god dragons that charged towards the black devil flame.

“Peng Peng Peng!”

“Peng Peng Peng!”

The terrifying sound of collision rang out. The creator of the automaton battleship had a serious expression on his face.

“As expected of the legendary Divine Dragon!”

He said coldly.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Kill!”

At this moment, the roar of the Dragon Palace could be heard. The 1.5 million troops of the Dragon Palace had arrived in front of the battleship army of the Automaton Domain under the leadership of the god Emperors.

“Spread out and destroy these battleships!”

“Devour all the battleships for me!”

Prime Minister Gui and Ao he ordered.

All the devouring dragons stared at the enormous battleships with burning eyes full of excitement.

Like hungry wolves, they pounced forward.

“Retreat!”

Sensing the power of the Dragon Palace, the creator gave an order.

This order was given in the next moment.

“Release the Flash!”

A message was sent to all the battleships of the machine imperial region.

“Hua La!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

In the next moment, dazzling lights suddenly rose in front of all the battleships.

This light made the entire space have no other color except white.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

The white light lit up, and all the battleships retreated into the depths of the machine imperial region at an extremely fast speed.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The white light affected the vision of the members of the Dragon Palace. However, the wind god Dragon and the others swayed their huge bodies, and countless wind blades swept across the thousands of warships.

Sparks flew from the thousands of warships, and they swayed in the void.

“Dragon Palace, just you wait!”

The creator’s eyes swept over the destroyed warships, and his eyes were filled with killing intent.

“They are leaving. The Army of the machine royal territory is leaving!”

“Hahaha, impressive. I have to say that the dragon palace is very strong. They forced the army of the machine royal territory to retreat!”

“I think the creator knows that they are no match for us and the Dragon Palace. They must be afraid!”

At the back, the soldiers of the glazed domain smiled and discussed excitedly when they saw the battleships of the machine royal territory retreating.

“No, look, the army of the Dragon Palace is still chasing after them!”

“What’s going on? The Dragon Palace is still chasing after the army of the Machine Imperial Region? What is the Dragon Palace doing?”

However, soon, everyone was shocked to find that the Dragon Palace did not stop when the battleships of the machine imperial region retreated. Instead, they continued to chase after them.

What was the Dragon Palace doing?

“What are the Dragon Palace trying to do?”

When the creator saw the million-strong army of the Dragon Palace chasing after them, his pupils constricted slightly, and his eyes revealed a ghastly expression.

He stared at everyone from the Dragon Palace.

“Fire!”

His eyes flashed with all kinds of information, and his orders were directly transmitted to every one of his subordinates.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Countless cannons shot toward everyone from the Dragon Palace.

However, their attacks only slowed down the Dragon Palace’s pursuit, but they didn’t stop.

Especially the nine wind divine dragons. With their terrifying speed and their huge wings and claws, the battleships flipped in the air and were destroyed!

Every time a battleship was destroyed, the creature with eighteen claws would pounce over and devour the battleship.

The creator’s eyes were filled with anger.

With his brain’s calculations, he had made a series of mistakes.

He still couldn’t figure out why the Dragon Palace dared to chase after them.

Were they courting death? Or did they think that the machine royal territory was easy to bully?

“Hiss, the Dragon Palace has already chased into the machine royal territory, but they haven’t stopped yet!”

“I can’t even see now, what’s Going On? The Dragon Palace is going to attack the machine royal territory?”

“Attack the machine imperial region? This… This is impossible, right? With the Dragon Palace’s strength, can they do it? Do you know that the machine imperial region didn’t send all their forces over this time?”

All the soldiers of the glazed domain looked at the void in front of them. The Dragon Palace chasing after the machine imperial region had completely disappeared from their sight.

“Tell all the soldiers to retreat!”

In the void in front of the war continent, the domain Lord said to the surrounding godly monarchs.

“It’s the domain Lord!”

The eyes of all the god Emperors flickered as they looked at the void in front of them.

Even though they knew that the Dragon Palace wanted to invade the machine imperial region, they were still extremely shocked when they saw it with their own eyes.

“Boss Wang is still the fiercest. It’s a pity that this great battle is too brutal. I don’t dare to go over.”

Invincible battle technique, who stood at the side, could not help but sigh.
