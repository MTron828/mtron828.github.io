Chapter 787: 0788 Dragon Gate auction

Translator: 549690339

Dragon Gate auction!

After the end of the grand competition, the Dragon King announced on the spot that an auction would be held.

This was the first Dragon Gate auction. Three days later, it would be held on a floating island in the Bohai Sea.

The auction would be held for one day. At that time, the main items to be auctioned would be spirit weapons and elixirs.

At that time, in this auction, five grade-13 spirit weapons, three sets of grade-12 spirit weapon sets, grade-7 elixirs, and grade-6 elixirs would be auctioned.

Once this news was out, it once again caused the entire immortal sects to be in an uproar.

Five grade-13 spirit weapons, these were weapons used by Immortals, and many immortals in the immortal sects didn’t have grade-13 spirit weapons to use.

The other three sets of grade-12 spirit weapon sets also caused many immortal sect disciples to go crazy.

Spirit weapon sets, when an ordinary infant realm expert wore this spirit weapon set, they were completely capable of fighting against the heaven’s favorites ranked on the Heaven’s favorites list.

Not to mention those grade seven medicinal pills and grade six medicinal pills.

The rarity of grade seven medicinal pills could shorten the cultivation time of an infant realm expert by a few years or even more than ten years. Their rarity even surpassed that of a spirit tool.

If one could consume grade seven medicinal pills to increase the cultivation speed, there was a chance of stepping into the immortal God realm in the future.

Spirit tools and medicinal pills were extremely precious to martial artists.

Other than spirit tools and medicinal pills, there was also the Earth Star Fish, an earth star fish that could increase one’s lifespan.

An earth star fish could be comparable to a level six medicinal pill, a treasure that could increase one’s lifespan. At that time, the earth star fish would not be auctioned, but sold directly. It could be exchanged with level six medicinal pills and level seven spiritual herbs.

When the news of the Dragon Gate auction came out, the eyes of many immortal sect disciples lit up, filled with anticipation.

Many disciples of the immortal sects rushed into Jiang City, waiting for the beginning of the Dragon Gate auction.

“Dragon Gate, Dragon King!”

At this time, in the area of yaoding, Yaoshan was the most majestic mountain peak of yaoding. The entire mountain peak was covered with green plants.

Many plants swayed their branches, swaying without wind, and had their own lives.

At the top of Mount Yao, a golden palace was built where the golden plants were.

At this moment, thirteen middle-aged elders were standing in the palace.

In the center of the palace stood an elder. The elder was wearing a red robe and a green robe.

This elder didn’t appear in the sight of the other immortal sects.

In the Yao Ding world, there were only two immortal sects, the Holy Medicine sect and the Holy Medicine sect. Therefore, the other immortal sects didn’t know the true strength of the two immortal sects.

Now, there were thirteen immortal gods in the entire palace, a total of thirteen. This was far beyond the expectations of the other immortal sects in the jianghu.

They only revealed eight immortal gods, and now there were five more. This was terrifying!

Moreover, if the people of the immortal sects saw the two sect leaders standing respectfully beside the old man in the middle, they would be even more shocked.

After all, the sect leaders of the two immortal sects had the strength of a middle-level immortal.

This meant that this old man was a high-level immortal!

As of now, only the Xuan Yuan clan, the Yuwen clan, and the Wild Beast Immortal sect were known to be high-level immortals!

“The Dragon Gate doesn’t put us two immortal sects in their eyes. We can’t let this grudge go just like that!”

“It’s not just this grudge. There’s also the matter of the innate immortal sect. If it weren’t for the Dragon King, we could completely monopolize the medicinal pills in the entire jianghu in the future. Our influence could surpass that of the Xuan Yuan clan and the Yuwen clan!”

“Also, we can increase the terrifying battle strength of a tree demon, a middle-rank immortal!”

The two leaders of the two immortal sects growled in a low voice, their eyes filled with coldness.

They had cut off their business and one of their immortal sects’powerful battle strength.

Now, they had even killed the ten most outstanding disciples of their two immortal sects, making the two immortal sects, Holy Medicine and Holy Doctor, Lose Face.

Not to mention that in the past, the Dragon King had even destroyed the clansmen that they had left behind in the real world.

Moreover, they also suspected that the experts of the immortal sects who had been sent out in advance before they appeared in the real world had also been killed by the Dragon King.

All kinds of hatred had already become irreconcilable between the two sides.

“The face of our holy medicine and Holy Medicine Immortal sect has been slapped so many times by the Dragon Gate. We absolutely can not let this matter rest. Otherwise, the immortal sects in the world will think that we two immortal sects are to be trifled with!”

An old man in a fiery red robe continued to speak in a gloomy tone.

“That’s right. Please give us your orders, Grand Supreme. We must teach this dragon gate a good lesson!”

The Immortal Gods of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect looked at the old man in the middle and asked with eyes full of anger.

“The disciples of this Dragon Gate are all in the infant realm. The total number of members is at most a hundred. The Immortal God treaty can not be violated!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The Old Man’s face was full of fat, full of majesty and dominance. His lips moved slightly, and the sound of a loud bell rang out.

“This is also what we are afraid of. The Dragon Gate has seventy to eighty infant realm experts, and the number of experts is only twenty to thirty less than us. Moreover, they don’t have any territory, so it’s not easy to deal with them!”

An immortal God said with a gloomy face. All of the disciples were in the infant realm, so the immortal gate without any territory made it impossible for them to deal with them.

“No, the Dragon Gate didn’t have any territory or property in the past, but according to the information I received, after the auction, the Dragon Gate will open a forging workshop to sell spirit tools and pills, and undertake the refining of spirit tools and pills!”

The green-robed old man shook his head, and his eyes shone with a bright light.

“Since he wants to monopolize the refining of medicinal pills and spirit tools in the jianghu, then we...”

A middle-aged immortal God’s cold lips curled up as he narrowed his eyes slightly.

“The crime of the Dragon Gate can not be forgiven. Don’t have any scruples!”

The old man standing in the middle slowly raised his head. “The treacherous Spike clan has already established the treacherous Spike clan to carry out assassinations and accept any assassinations!”

“The treacherous Spike clan doesn’t have many clansmen either. They are similar to the Dragon Gate. We will pay for them to act. The treacherous Spike clan’s assassinations, along with us, will be executed!”

“If they offend our Holy Medicine Holy Doctor Celestial Sect, kill them! In the future, we will make it impossible for them to gain a foothold in the martial arts world!”

The old man’s eyes lit up and his voice reverberated throughout the entire hall. “Anyone who dares to provoke us will be killed!”

“Yes, Grand Supreme!”

Killing intent surged in the eyes of the immortals. A terrifying killing intent pervaded the entire hall.

...

“Dragon King, the floating island has been reconstructed by the puppet celestial sect. Do you want to go over and take a look?”

At this moment, Mo Qinglong said to Wang Xian when he had just returned to Jiang City.

“Let’s go and take a look. There must be no mistakes in the Dragon Gate auction in three days!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. Once the auction was successful, it would mean that half of the Dragon Gate forging workshop was successful.

Once the forging workshop was on the right track, the layout on land would be completed.

By then, he could enter the ocean directly and start to enter the vast ocean, sweeping across the entire ocean!

At that time, the Dragon Palace would improve at a terrifying speed.
