3848 The 3847 terrifying sacrifice

“Hehe, as expected!”

Wang Xian flew forward. When he felt the terrifying attack coming from behind, his eyes lit up instantly.

His eyes lit up with joy. Without any hesitation, he waved his arm.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

In an instant, cursed dragons appeared behind Wang Xian one after another and went to receive the energy.

With the attack of five space beasts and 500 cursed dragons, there was a 100% chance that the curse could be killed!

Wang Xian was not sure about the rest of the attacks!

However, faced with this terrifying attack, Wang Xian released more than 20,000 cursed dragons.

The 20,000 cursed dragons roared and charged towards the streams of energy without hesitation.

“What is this?”

They saw the cursed dragons that were going up against their attacks.

The gods of the ten palaces were extremely astonished.

Boom! Boom! Boom

In the next moment, the cursed dragons were struck by the streams of energy and died instantly. They had no ability to resist at all!

However, after they cursed, streams of cursed energy surged towards them.

This was especially so for the five space beasts that were at the sixth level.

In order to avoid any accidents, Wang Xian had ordered 500 cursed dragons to kill them. This was already a lot.

According to his calculations, two to three hundred of them should be enough to kill them completely.

There were at least 500 to 600 gods at the seventh level and a large number of gods at the sixth level. They used the attack of their treasures to kill 20,000 cursed dragons instantly.

The energy continued to attack Wang Xian.

Wang Xian hurriedly tried to block it!

Boom! Boom! Boom

Waves of energy were blocked by Wang Xian. In the next moment, he turned around and stared at the million-strong army of the ten palaces. His eyes revealed a ghastly expression.

“You Want to kill me? Today, I will see who will kill who!”

He said with a ghastly expression. The Soul Spear appeared in his hand!

Next, he was ready for a big battle!

“You guys from the nine-origin universe actually dared to kill the gods that we believe in. Today is the day you die. After you destroy us, we will also destroy your Dragon Palace.”

When a level seven God from the decree palace heard Wang Xian’s words, his eyes were filled with sharp killing intent.

Their decree palace had suffered heavy losses at the hands of the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!

“Hehehe, then let me see who will be the one killing who today!”

Wang Xian sneered as he stared at the five space beasts. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

“Awoooo!”

“Awoooo!”

At this moment, the curse began to descend. A large amount of terrifying black energy flowed out from the mouths of the five space beasts.

A strange black energy coiled around the five level six space beasts.

This strange black energy was eroding their life force.

“Eh? What’s going on?”

The sudden change caused the expressions of the level 7 gods on the five Space Beasts to change.

“Not good, I feel an invasion of energy. What a terrifying energy!”

“I can feel it too. It’s a curse. We’ve suffered a terrifying curse!”

At this moment, the hearts of the Tier 7 and tier 6 gods that had attacked earlier suddenly pounded.

They could feel a terrifying energy gradually enveloping their bodies, dissipating their life force.

This energy was terrifying and strange!

“It’s a curse. It should be related to the 20,000 creatures. It’s a curse. Quick, move the curse!”

Half of the seventh-level gods of the ten palaces were covered by the curse. Black curse power surged out from their bodies.

The curse was quickly wiping out their vitality.

This caused their expressions to change drastically.

“Faith, shift the curse!”

The eyes of the seventh-level and sixth-level gods who were cursed focused. They roared loudly.

“Buzz Buzz Buzz!”

“Buzz Buzz Buzz!”

Buzz Buzz Buzz

The next second, Wang Xian saw the scene of countless believers worshipping in the sky above them.

The entire void was filled with the shadows of the believers.

At this moment, wisps of black curse power were transferred to the shadows of the believers above them from the bodies of the cursed gods.

“Ahhhh!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Ahhhh!”

Following that, miserable screams were heard. One could see the illusory figures of the believers showing pained expressions. Slowly, the illusory figures belonging to them collapsed.

This represented the death of a believer.

A large number of believers were enveloped by the black curse power and died quickly!

“Huh?”

When Wang Xian saw this scene, his gaze focused slightly.

They actually transferred the curse on their own believers to help them bear the power of the curse.

However, they didn’t show any signs of abnormality.

The transfer of the curse astonished Wang Xian!

“Qingyue, make your move!”

Wang Xian saw that the situation was continuing. With a low growl, Lan qingyue instantly appeared beside him!

“Woo Woo Woo!”

“Woo Woo Woo Woo!”

Following that, a black hole appeared behind Lan Qingyue. From the black hole, Xiao Lan and the rest flew out!

“Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Without any hesitation, Wang Xian threw out the soul spear in his hand!

The five elements grinding mill and the tai chi dragon disc directly attacked them.

Xiao Lan, Xiao Bai, and the rest also let out a roar and directly attacked the army of the ten palaces who believed in the universe.

Roar! Roar! Roar

At the same time, the auras of the five Cosmic Beasts who were at the sixth level of the ten palaces were getting weaker and weaker. They were slowly dying.

This caused the ten palaces to instantly lose five of their top-notch combat strength.

On the other hand, Wang Xian had increased the combat strength of LAN Qingyue and the rest by four top-notch combat strength.

Under this situation, the strength of Wang Xian and the rest had already surpassed the million-strong army of the ten palaces.

In addition, among the million-strong army of the ten palaces, half of the level-seven and level-six gods were resisting the power of the curse.

“Oh no, damn it, we’ve been ambushed!”

“That’s the ancient god of the Dragon Palace, the kun-rearing master. They are actually hiding here. All of our space beasts have died!”

When the gods of the ten palaces saw this scene, their expressions changed drastically as they roared loudly.

Originally, they were in an absolute situation of suppression. However, they didn’t expect the situation to turn out like this in the blink of an eye!

All the gods revealed ugly expressions on their faces.

“We need to remove the curse power in our bodies. We can’t make a move for a short period of time.”

The gods who were cursed also roared with extremely ugly expressions.

They knew that they were in trouble!

They didn’t know why they were suddenly struck by such a strange and terrifying curse, and they needed to resist it now.

And if they resisted, then the true treasures they believed in the universe wouldn’t be able to be controlled and used.

This was a huge crisis for them!

The gods who believed in the universe looked extremely grave.

“Sacrifice! Sacrifice! We’ll definitely destroy them today!”

Soon, a Level 7 god from the Decree Palace roared with blood-red eyes.

They still had a trump card!
