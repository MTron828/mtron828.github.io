Chapter 132: Mr. Feng

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“Did he choose Guan Shuqing?”

In one of the rooms of the girls’ dormitory block, Lan Qingyue’s already pale face was filled with misery.

“I just need a hug and some comforting words right now but who would have expected...”

“Although I have thought of the possibility of you choosing him, why does it have to be right now?”

Lan Qingyue was in a daze and her complexion was as white as a sheet.

Weng weng weng!

At this moment, her phone rang. She saw that it was from her dad as she picked it up in a daze.

“Qingyue, we need you back to handle the company matters. If we can’t get past this hurdle, our Lan Family will be in deep trouble!”

The solemn voice of her father sounded from the other end of the phone. Lan Qingyue was hesitating.

“Dad. Why don’t I just drop out of school and focus on managing the family business?”

Lan Qingyue’s father pondered for a moment before replying slowly, “Alright. You wouldn’t really learn anything from school anyway. It’s fine if you are coming back to manage the company in advance.”

“Yeah!”

Lan Qingyue was a genius. When she was 14 years old, she’d demonstrated exceptional business acumen.

At that time, she followed her grandparents and stayed within the company for the majority of the days. Gradually, through learning and understanding, her talents in business were quickly developed.

When she was 17 years old, she was already able to complete a project on her own.

Lan Qingyue’s performance greatly shocked everyone in the Lan Family. Subsequently, the Master of the Lan Family decided that he would hand over the Lan Family’s business to Lan Qingyue for management.

After a few years, she had further consolidated her position as the successor of the family business.

However, it wasn’t that simple to manage a family corporation with a market capitalization of close to $10 billion.

After hanging up the phone, she looked around her room blankly and flipped through some photographs in her phone gallery.

“Do I not have any chance now?”

A teardrop flowed out slowly from her eyes. Lan Qingyue rested her head and arms on the table and her shoulders were shaking slightly from sobbing.

...

“Eh, isn’t that Guan Shuqing and Wang Xian? They are eating together again.”

“Yeah. Look, they are really intimate. Could it be that Wang Xian has gotten together with Guan Shuqing?”

“Really? Wang Xian has chosen Guan Shuqing?”

“If he has chosen Guan Shuqing, it must be true love. After all, Lan Qingyue’s qualifications are too good!”

Within the school, when the students saw Guan Shuqing eating with Wang Xian, they were all shocked.

They had not expected Wang Xian’s final choice to be Guan Shuqing.

“Xiao Xian, when do you think we can go for a picnic again? I really miss the time when we had a picnic at the Eastern Hill! Hehe.”

Guan Shuqing smiled radiantly at Wang Xian as she spoke.

“Picnic? That’s easy! If you like, we can have it tonight!”

“Nope. I have already eaten tonight. I’ll get fat if I eat again.”

“In that case, let’s do it tomorrow. I’ll get some large lobsters, crabs...”

Wang Xian chatted happily with Guan Shuqing. After they finished their meal, the two of them took a walk around the school again.

Guan Shuqing had likely sensed something and took the initiative to hold Wang Xian’s hand.

Wang Xian smiled and walked around the school with her.

The two of them were just like any couple as they strolled within the school.

The news of Wang Xian choosing Guan Shuqing was also revealed on the school forum by others, causing a huge uproar.

“I really had not expected Wang Xian’s final choice to be Guan Shuqing!”

“This must be true love. Lan Qingyue’s family is so rich and yet he has chosen Guan Shuqing!”

“What a man! Wang Xian has made the right choice this time!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“If he can give up a girl with a superb family background and choose to be with Guan Shuqing, Guan Shuqing will likely be very blessed.”

The news of Wang Xian getting together with Guan Shuqing was shocking to many people. However, there was still a large number of students who were impressed with Wang Xian.

The next day. Other than staying in his medical hall, Wang Xian spent all his remaining time with Guan Shuqing. He had also thought it through. Since he had made his decision, he shouldn’t try to hide the facts!

However, he sat within his dormitory room in shock on the third day.

“Old Wang, Lan Qingyue has suspended her studies and has submitted her resignation as the vice-president of the student council! I heard that she wanted to drop out of school initially but the school has retained her name in the school’s name roll. Nonetheless, she is unlikely to come back in the future,” Wang Dahai said to Wang Xian.

Looking at his reaction, Wang Dahai shook his head. “I had not expected Lan Qingyue to be so in love with you. You are a really lucky guy!”

Wang Xian frowned. He took out his phone but hesitated. In the end, he did not contact her.

Lan Qingyue’s sudden drop out of school frustrated him a little.

Bam!

At this moment, the door of the room was kicked open suddenly with a loud bang.

“Who’s that? Don’t you know how to be softer!” Wang Dahai turned around and cried out unsatisfactorily.

However, when he saw the figure by the door, he was slightly surprised.

At the door, an extremely handsome man was standing there. He had a pair of eyes, which inclined upwards, and thin lips which made him look extremely beautiful.

That’s right, he was beautiful. This was an extremely beautiful and exquisite looking man.

Wang Dahai opened his mouth slightly. “You are... Mr... Mr. Feng!”

Mr. Feng was a very mysterious person in the school.

All the students only knew that he was so good-looking that he made the other male students jealous, and was so beautiful that even girls envied his beauty.

His family was extremely rich and he rarely appeared in school.

Among the girls, they referred to him as Mr. Feng, a rather elegant name.

“You must be Wang Xian!”

Mr. Feng didn’t pay attention to Wang Dahai and stared fervently at Wang Xian with his sharp eyes.

Wang Xian looked at the extremely good-looking guy at the door and roared impatiently, “Speak!”

“I just returned yesterday and I had not expected Lan Qingyue to have dropped out of school because of you. Therefore, I decided to investigate about you. To my surprise, you are really outstanding!”

Mr. Feng walked over slowly with his eyes fixed on Wang Xian. It was as though there were nothing and no one around him.

“I’m really surprised to learn that there is a man as outstanding as you.”

Mr. Feng was observing him as he complimented Wang Xian. “However, you’ve made two mistakes.”

He wasn’t bothered by Wang Xian’s silence. “First, you shouldn’t have made Lan Qingyue fall in love with you. Second, you shouldn’t have offended my Yan Family.”

“I’d like to invite you to a place tonight,” he continued. As he spoke, an invitation card appeared in his hands. He flicked it lightly and it landed on the table beside Wang Xian.

“I’ll make this an unforgettable night for you. If you don’t come, you better watch out for your relatives and friends.”

Mr. Feng turned around and left with a huge smile after completing his sentence.

Everyone in the school knew that Mr. Feng was fond of Lan Qingyue. However, Lan Qingyue didn’t have the same feelings at that time.

Subsequently, Mr. Feng, for unknown reasons, had rarely gone to the school.

Now that he had returned, he received two pieces of negative news.

He truly appreciated the fact that there was such an outstanding man in Rivertown, as he felt that there was finally someone he could relate to.

However, it was destined that one of them would disappear forever from Rivertown.

Wang Xian looked at his back view and a faint smile appeared on his face.

It’s the Yan Family again? Threatening me?

His mood wasn’t great to start with because of the Lan Qingyue incident.

Wang Xian took out his phone and called Mo Qinglong. He only told him four words,

“Dragon Sect, fall in!”
