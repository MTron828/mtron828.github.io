Chapter 1513: 1513 stepped on the light, searching for the balance between light and darkness

“My Name Is Wang Xian!”

The four words came out of his mouth firmly. His eyes were clear and bright.

Wang Xian extended his hand and slowly touched the location of his heart. A strong heartbeat was transmitted.

The heart of Light and darkness had completely integrated into his heart.

However, at this moment, the dark area still occupied 90% of his heart while the light only occupied 10% .

The rest of his body was filled with the energy of the five elements.

The energy of the five elements suppressed the darkness and balanced the power of light.

“According to the light and Dark Dragon King, in order to completely control the heart of Light and darkness, we need four points. We need to remove a remnant of our soul and maintain the original heart. The balance between light and darkness and the fusion of light and darkness!”

“The remnant soul of the light and Dark Dragon King has been removed and the original heart has basically been maintained. Next is the balance between light and darkness and the fusion of light and darkness. The last two points must be achieved or else...”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered.

The heart of light and dark had already entered his body. Once he could not achieve the balance between light and dark, the combination of light and dark would trigger darkness to envelop his body when he encountered some stimulation.

At that time, it would affect his original heart.

Just like before, he had almost lost his mind and killed more than a million people.

Fortunately, the ancient demon city was filled with extremely vicious sinners, which reduced his psychological pressure.

The heart of Light and darkness was still a ticking time bomb to Wang Xian.

If he was not careful, he would explode the people around him.

If he was not careful, he would turn into a demonic dragon and destroy all living things.

“It seems like I have to find a way to balance the light and darkness!”

Wang Xian was deep in thought.

“Brother Wang Xian, are you alright?”

At this moment, he Yuan’s excited voice came from more than ten kilometers away. His figure was flying over quickly.

“I’m Fine!”

Wang Xian looked at he yuan and the rest of the He clan. He hesitated for a moment before saying, “Brother he yuan, I’m sorry. I have to solve my physical problems. We will meet again soon!”

As he spoke, he turned around and flew straight to the front.

“Brother Wang Xian...”

He Yuan was slightly stunned. He opened his mouth and called out softly. Then, he stopped.

“This young master Wang Xian should be fine now. However, he should have some matters to settle!”

The He clan leader flew over and patted he Yuan’s shoulder gently.

“I know, Father!”

He Yuan nodded his head.

“The new wave is pushing the new wave forward!”

The white-haired elder sighed slightly. His gaze swept across the ancient demon city that had been completely razed to the ground. He was in a daze.

“The matters here will soon shock the entire vast region!”

“Let’s Go!”

Everyone from the He clan looked at the ruins beneath them and then at the young man who had left. Their eyes were filled with complicated emotions.

Some of the He clan members almost worshiped him!

...

“What a shocking piece of news! The ancient devil city was razed to the ground in a single night, seven devil lords were annihilated, and a million sinners were all killed. Listen to the world’s latest announcement, come and take a look!”

The Divine Light Imperial City was the capital of a first-rate empire, the Divine Light Empire. It was a huge city with a population of 30 million.

The entire imperial city covered an area of 100 kilometers. On a bustling street, a young man waved a newspaper in his hand as he shouted at the people on the street.

“What? Ancient Devil City has been razed to the ground? How is this possible? That’s an existence that even first-rate factions don’t dare to provoke!”

“There shouldn’t be anything wrong with the news from the world. Quick, go take a look and see if a super faction has taken action. Heavens, the ancient devil city, that city of sin, has been destroyed!”

Everyone on the surrounding streets was slightly shocked when they heard this news. They all looked at the shops in harmony world in shock as they walked over to buy the newspaper that contained this news.

On one side of the street, a youth dressed in pure white clothes with a warm smile on his face revealed a faint smile when he heard this news.

He held a scepter of light in his hand and was dressed in a holy manner. He looked like a priest that was unique to the divine light empire.

“Give me a candied fruit!”

The young man was Wang Xian!

He said to an old man selling candied fruit with a smile on his face. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Alright, Young Master Priest, ten low-grade Spirit Stones!”

A smile appeared on the Old Man’s face. He passed a candied fruit to Wang Xian and said.

“Keep the change!”

Wang Xian handed the old man a middle-grade spirit stone and continued walking forward with the candied gourd in his hand.

“Oh my God, the one who destroyed the ancient demon city was not one of the three superpowers. Instead, it was a terrifying dark creature. Not a single person in the entire ancient demon city survived. All of them were killed!”

“If I become a demon, there will be no demons in the world. What a domineering statement. Does this mean that if I become a demon, even the demon masters in the ancient demon city can not be considered as demons? This is too domineering!”

“Also, that sentence where I say light is light, doesn’t that mean I let you have light and you have light? What kind of creature is this? Why is it so overbearing!”

“This strength is too terrifying. It’s said that the two sentences in the newspaper spread throughout the ancient Devil City for ten thousand miles, and everyone within ten thousand miles heard it!”

“Is that creature transformed by a human’s bloodline? Why is it speaking human language? Other creatures wouldn’t say such words, right!”

“Sky Demon, heting world calls that creature sky demon. It’s the only Sky Demon in the world!”

“It’s even more savage than the sinners in ancient Devil City. Sky Demon deserves it!”

“What the hell? which faction dares to provoke such a terrifying creature? They even dare to destroy ancient Devil City. That’s over a million people!”

“I think this Lord Sky Demon is too handsome. There’s not a single good person in ancient Devil City. All of them deserve to die. Well done. Support Lord Sky Demon!”

As they walked along the streets, they heard a series of shocked voices from the side.

Many people rushed towards the heting world’s shop with shocked faces.

“Bang!”

“I’m sorry, I’m Sorry!”

“It’s Alright!”

A young man walked towards the heting world’s shop with a curious face. He accidentally bumped into Wang Xian.

Wang Xian shook his head lightly. He looked calm as he listened to the shocked voices around him.

He was holding the scepter of light and eating candied haws. One look and one could tell that he was a harmless young man.

No one would have thought that such a young man was a terrifying existence that shocked the entire vast region.

In just a few short days, the news of the destruction of the ancient demon city had spread across the entire vast region. The reactions of all the places were almost the same as the people of the Divine Light Empire.

The places closer to the ancient city of demons were even more intense.

The word “Sky Demon”had entered the eyes of every major faction. Even the super factions had classified the Sky Demon as a dangerous character.

“The He clan’s heting world actually gave themselves such a name!”

Under the sunlight, Wang Xian stepped on the light and headed towards the position of the Employment Association. He shook his head slightly.

Step on the light and find the balance between light and darkness!
