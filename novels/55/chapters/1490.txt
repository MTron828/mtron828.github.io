Chapter 1491: 1491 was the son of a demon

“The supreme genius of the Flowing Sea Region!”

“A few months ago, the entire flowing sea region was unified under his control!”

“The person behind the flowing sea region, the friend of the Empress of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire!”

“Easily killed a rank 6 profound void martial artist!”

This was a message from the flowing sea region. These messages were not what shocked them the most.

What shocked them the most was the following information.

“A month ago, he appeared in the vast north flowing sea region and destroyed the towering sky sword sect at a terrifying speed!”

“He single-handedly killed two sword masters of the towering Sky Sword sect who were at the seventh rank of the insightful void realm in a short period of time!”

“He destroyed the towering sky sword sect and established the Heartless Sword Dao sect. He is currently looking for a girl!”

“She is only 30 years old!”

Information appeared one after another in front of the He clan leader and the three clan leaders.

When they saw the information, their faces revealed a shocked expression.

Especially the last introduction of the information, she was only 30 years old.

30 years old, only 30 years old.

Seeing this number, they felt a little dazed.

Reaching the seventh level of the profound void tier at 30 years old?

Moreover, he could easily kill two experts at the seventh level of the profound void tier.

This...

The He clan leader and the elders in the room sucked in a breath of cold air, their faces full of shock as they stared at the information in front of them.

“This... How is this possible? A 30-year-old expert at the seventh level of the profound void tier, this old man has lived for over 3,000 years, but he hasn’t stepped into the seventh level of the profound void tier for long. How did he cultivate at the age of 30? “Even if he is from the dragon race, it is impossible for him to have such speed!”

The burly clan leader widened his eyes and stood up in disbelief.

The others were also in a daze.

“The records on the data can’t be wrong. Moreover, the array formations used to detect age are extremely accurate, so there shouldn’t be any mistakes. In addition, he has such a young face...”

The He clan leader’s eyes flashed with a surprised glint as he stared at the information in front of him.

“I’ve never seen such a monstrous person. Even the legendary God from tens of thousands of years ago isn’t this terrifying!”

“I’m afraid that only in the history of the dragon clan would such a monstrous person appear!”

The few clan elders took a deep breath.

“Yuan ‘er did indeed get to know him in the flowing sea region, and their relationship is quite good. This time, he came to find Yuan ‘er, he should be asking Yuan ‘er to help him find that woman!”

The entire house was silent for a full five minutes. The He clan’s leader sighed and said in a low voice.

“This child is a demon, his future potential is unfathomable. If he yuan that kid can get to know him well, he might be able to benefit him and even our he clan in the future. According to the records, that young man’s strength has increased at a terrifying speed, I can not believe it!”

The burly clan leader stared at the information in front of him as he spoke, and a trace of bitterness appeared on his face.

Thinking back to that night, when he was filled with fighting spirit and wanted to have a good battle with him, in the end, the other party was able to easily kill two insightful void martial experts.

He also had some understanding of the two sword masters of the towering Sky Sword sect. Sword techniques that were good at killing and powerful combined attacks were considered top-notch among those of the same level.

However, they were quickly killed by that young man alone.

No wonder that night, even though that young man was surrounded, he didn’t have much fear when facing the four of them.

It was because the other party had such confidence in his own strength.

“Fortunately, we didn’t fall out with him. Moreover, the ones who died were only the two outsiders who had submitted to He Feng. That Wang Xian didn’t make any ruthless moves either!”

An elder said slowly.

“This matter isn’t a bad thing for us. Let he yuan get along well with him. However, he yuan clearly doesn’t know the strength of that young man. Should we inform him and let him...”

“There’s no need to tell him. After all, that Wang Xian is an expert at level seven of the Seethrough realm. If we were to tell Yuan er, he might feel restrained. Once the relationship between friends becomes complicated, it wouldn’t be pure anymore. This time, he came to seek Yuan Er’s help. He owes a favor in the first place!”

“That’s true. Let’s keep this matter a secret for the time being. As for He Feng, when he comes out, you have to teach him well!”

“I know, Third Grandpa!”

The He clan leader was chatting with a few clan elders.

“He’s thirty years old. If he doesn’t die halfway, he will definitely reach level eight of the Seethrough realm or even reach a higher level!”

The three clan leaders stood up and looked at each other as they exclaimed in astonishment.

Such a devilish young man was worthy of their entire he clan’s goodwill and even their goodwill.

If he could reach a higher level in the future, he would be able to protect the He clan for thousands of years.

“I heard that a strong person came to the He clan’s forest these few days and had a small conflict with the He clan. However, they didn’t get into a fight!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“It seems to be at a place not far from where we live. TSK TSK. It’s a pity that I slept earlier and didn’t hear it!”

Inside Dui Mu Dazhuang’s shop, he walked in and told Wang Xian when he heard the discussions outside.

“I don’t know either!”

Wang Xian shook his head with a smile.

“So, brother Wang Xian, you die this way even when you sleep. Haha, today’s Harvest is pretty good. Tomorrow is young master he Yuan’s birthday. I want to buy a cool outfit!”

“Even if I can’t become a member of young master he’s army, with my looks, I might be able to make a lady fall in love with me. By then, I will be able to achieve great success!”

Dumu Dazhuang was fantasizing about a beautiful future. He pulled Wang Xian with an excited expression and closed the door before walking out.

Wang Xian smiled at the side.

Dumu Dazhuang had many flaws. However, no matter how many flaws he had, it could not hide his narcissistic and optimistic attitude.

At this moment, the flow of people was obviously much more than a few days ago.

In the surroundings, there were many young men dressed in luxurious clothes. Each of them was tall and lofty, exuding confidence and arrogance.

He Yuan’s birthday party and the establishment of He Yuan’s army attracted the young talents within a radius of hundreds of thousands of kilometers.

At least tens of thousands of young men and women rushed over, and they were all young men and women with good strength and talent.

To many people, this was an opportunity.

Once they succeeded, they would be able to obtain a void interpretation level mount. There were only a few people in the entire vast region who were so generous.

On the morning of the second day, Dui Dazhuang dragged Wang Xian into the He clan’s forest early in the morning.

“Quick, quick, let’s go there earlier. Let’s breathe in the air around the holy tree and see if there are any beauties around. Haha!”

Dui Dazhuang looked at Wang Xian with excitement and excitement.

“Clap Clap!”

A crisp sound came from Wang Xian’s shoulder. On his shoulder, there was a palm-sized little fellow that looked like a treant standing on it.

Its eyes were glowing as it stared at the holy tree and clapped its hands.

“TSK TSK, look at how little guy agrees with me. Let’s hurry up!”

Dui Dazhuang looked at the little guy and urged him.

Wang Xian nodded and followed behind. The little guy on his shoulder was hatched from the egg that he prepared to give to he yuan for his birthday last night.

To his surprise, after the little guy swallowed his egg shell, his bloodline evolved again.
