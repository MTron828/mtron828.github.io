Chapter 1221: 1222 dragon and Phoenix grocery store

Translator: 5496903

Wang Xian, who opened the door, didn’t notice that there was someone outside who had been looking for him for a long time.

He took a look at the store and sat on a chair. He poured himself a cup of tea and sat there leisurely, waiting for customers to arrive.

It was estimated that Long Xiaotian would bring some people to support the store before long. When the time came, business would naturally arrive.

“Young Royal Highness, this should be a newly opened shop. They didn’t pay us the safety management fee!”

On the left of the Dragon and Phoenix grocery store, there were two shops that weren’t very big. However, the third shop was much bigger.

It was at least ten times the size of Wang Xian’s shop. It had a total of more than ten floors. This was a restaurant with the words “Organ restaurant”written on it.

To be able to open a shop here with such a large area, the background of the shop was definitely not simple. Otherwise, the shop would have been torn down long ago.

The force behind the organ restaurant was the nine-star dynasty.

The nine-star dynasty was a dynasty that was not considered to be very strong. However, it was a dynasty after all and its strength could not be underestimated.

At the entrance of the organ restaurant, an old man stood beside a young man and whispered to him.

There were two men and three women around the young man.

“How many shops near our restaurant are under our control?”

The young man was very fat and weighed at least 200 kilograms. He glanced around and asked impatiently.

“Young prince, the 20 shops around our restaurant are all within our range. They must pay a safety fee for opening a shop here. Each shop has five spirit liquids a month!”

The old man reported from beside him.

“What? Only five spirit liquids? Twenty shops only have one hundred spirit liquids every month, that’s So Little?”

The fat youth frowned and said with a displeased expression. His expression was very unpleasant.

“Young Royal Highness, five spirit liquids is over a million middle-grade spirit stones. That’s not a small amount!”

A hint of speechlessness flashed through the old man’s eyes. No wonder this young Royal Highness was sent here.

“F * ck, I thought there would be a lot of spirit liquid. Let’s make it five. Let’s go over. If that Guy doesn’t take the initiative to pay the management fee, we’ll directly double the penalty. If he dares to not pay, we’ll tear down his shop!”

The fat young man revealed an unhappy expression and directly walked forward.

“Young prince, the few of us aren’t here to accompany you to collect rent. Quickly settle the matters here!”

A young man next to him said with a smile.

“Alright, Alright. Let me familiarize myself with the matters here first!”

The fat young man looked at the few people next to him and waved his hand.

The other few people behind him smiled.

“Grocery store? This... young prince, a store that sells groceries, what kind of spirit liquid can you receive?”

A woman looked at the store in front of her with a funny expression.

“Looks like it’s another poor guy. Last time, this shop sold the meat of ferocious beasts and demonic beasts. It only lasted for a month before it closed down!”

The old man beside him took a look and frowned slightly.

“No matter what he sells, he has to hand over the safety management fee to me!”

The Fat Young Man had a fierce expression on his face as he walked into the shop aggressively.

Wang Xian, who was sitting in the shop, was drinking tea with one hand while the five attributes of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth were dancing on his fingers with the other hand.

When there were no customers, Wang Xian could practice his attribute combination combat techniques.

“Eh? There are customers already?”

Wang Xian smiled when he saw seven people walking in from the door.

“What do you want to buy?”

Wang Xian asked faintly with a smile on his face.

“What do I want to buy? Don’t you know that you have to pay a safety fee for opening a new shop?”

Just as Wang Xian finished his sentence, the plump young man who walked in aggressively raised his head and shouted coldly.

“Safety fee?”

Wang Xian was slightly taken aback. He glanced at the few people who came with ill intentions and narrowed his eyes slightly. “What is a safety fee?”

“You are the owner of this shop, right? The safety fee is just that. You open a shop here and our organ restaurant will guarantee your safety!”

“You know the rules here as well. If you don’t have the ability, open a shop? It’s normal to be robbed by others. If you pay the safety fee, you will be protected by our accordion restaurant!”

The old man beside the fat young man stared at Wang Xian and said faintly.

“Hehe, I don’t need your protection. If you are not here to buy things, I’ll have to trouble you to get out!”

Wang Xian looked at them with a hint of mockery and said directly.

“Huh?”

The Old Man’s face turned cold when he heard Wang Xian’s words. He narrowed his eyes and sized him up carefully.

“Are you sure? Don’t regret it when the time comes. If you don’t have the strength, you will have to pay a heavy price to open a shop in the tomb of the demi-human!”

He stared at Wang Xian with a cold expression. A cold aura emanated from his body as he charged at Wang Xian without any concealment.

“Why are you wasting your breath on him? If he doesn’t hand over the safety fee, just cripple him!”

The fat young man said impatiently.

“Roar!”

“Ji Ji!”

However, their roars and the aura that emanated from their bodies caused a few ferocious beasts in the beast pen to let out a low roar. They looked at the group of people at the door and roared.

“What kind of beast is this?” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The roars of the Little Yan monkey and the blood-traced turtle instantly attracted the attention of the group. When they looked over, they were slightly stunned.

“That golden little monkey is so beautiful. It seems... it seems to be a Little Yan monkey with the bloodline of a half-step void interpretation demon beast. There are actually five, five Little Yan Monkeys!”

A girl looked at the Five Little Yan monkeys with a surprised expression and sized them up with love.

“It’s a half-step void interpretation demonic beast cub!”

The old man was slightly stunned, and his face was full of astonishment. The fat young man was also surprised.

A seemingly low-class grocery store actually had such a treasure.

They looked into the store and looked at it seriously.

Weapons, armor, and even sets.

Pet eggs, demon beasts, fierce beasts, array compasses, and many other strange treasures.

Each item was emitting a strong energy.

At least all of them were transcendent level 8 items.

This made them look shocked.

There were five to six hundred items like weapons and armor, and even the lowest-priced weapons cost ten drops of spirit liquid.

As for the Young Demonic Beast, it was worth at least 10 billion middle-grade spiritual stones.

This small shop sold a variety of items, but the value was beyond imagination.

“I didn’t expect the items sold to be so precious. That’s perfect. Take a young demonic beast as your safety fee for this month!”

The eyes of the fat young man flickered. He opened his mouth and spoke like a lion. He looked at the items around him with a hint of greed in his eyes.

“Didn’t you hear what I just said? Scram!”

Wang Xian saw the greedy eyes of the few of them and a look of disdain appeared in his eyes.
