Chapter 2899: 2,899 might of the Dragon Palace 6

“The Dragon Palace, the third most powerful force in the starry sky. I heard that the Dragon King and the others passed through the center of the battlefield during the battle between the Dragon God Emperor and the Divine Emperor Leng Xue. One of the peak godly king experts scolded them and was killed by the Dragon Palace. The Dragon Palace didn’t fight because of the Dragon King and the others!”

“What kind of creature is that? It looks like the legendary Divine Dragon!”

“It’s too domineering! are all the nine creatures at the divine emperor level? I feel that the Dragon Palace is much stronger than the legendary one!”

When everyone saw the nine wind divine dragons disappear into the teleportation array with the dragon palanquin, some of the surrounding people were discussing in shock.

The scene just now made them feel a little shocked.

“HMPH, what do you know?”

When the dozen or so experts guarding the teleportation array heard the discussions around them, one of them snorted coldly. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“In the future, when you meet the Dragon King, be careful when you meet the experts of the Dragon Palace. Now that the Dragon Palace has already destroyed the imperial court and the Witch Formation Association, the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King has led the nine divine dragons to sweep through the entire Heaven Magus region!”

“Eight divine emperors were killed by the Dragon Palace, and more than a million of the Witch Formation Association’s Divine Kings were all killed. Even the Magi were instantly killed by the Dragon King.”

“Now that the Celestial Wizard territory and the Imperial Star Field are all under the control of the Dragon Palace, the Dragon King’s strength is heaven-defying. As for who is the strongest faction in the entire resplendent starry sky, it’s hard to say. However, we can be sure that the dragon palace isn’t weaker than Liu Li!”

The expert reminded everyone around him with a cold expression.

As the most chaotic ancient heaven punishment region, there wasn’t even a communication network. Most of the people didn’t receive any news about the Dragon Palace.

However, as an expert on a planet and a core member of a force, they still knew about this matter.

Moreover, their leader had personally sent this news to all his subordinates to make them pay attention.

After all, they had to pass through the Heaven’s punishment ancient sky region to get to the eight barrens and six directions from the imperial star region.

“Hiss, what? The Dragon Palace destroyed the imperial court and the Witch Formation Association and swept through a region?”

“The Dragon Palace has a divine dragon, a real divine dragon?”

When the surrounding people heard the expert’s words, their faces were shocked and revealed an incredulous expression.

Very soon, the news that the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace was teleporting on the Planet of the Heaven’s punishment ancient Sky Region in a dragon sedan pulled by nine divine dragons spread at a terrifying speed.

The gigantic divine wind dragon was exceptionally eye-catching. The moment it appeared, it attracted the attention of countless people.

When they sensed the terrifying power coming from the Divine Wind Dragon and learned that the Dragon King was on his way, the powerhouses of the planets cleared the teleportation formation respectfully and let them go first.

The power of the Dragon Palace intimidated the entire star domain.

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

When Wang Xian and the rest arrived at a planet after traveling through more than half of the heaven’s punishment ancient Sky Domain.

The moment they came out of the teleportation formation, a respectful voice sounded.

“HMM?”

The nine wind divine dragons swept a glance at the old man in front of them and ignored him.

The Heaven’s array looked at him in astonishment and nodded at the old man indifferently.

There were a few thousand people behind an old man. Every one of them was an expert at the level of a godly monarch.

This old man was an existence at the level of a godly monarch.

He was the leader of a faction in the heaven punishment ancient sky region.

Wang Xian and the rest did not stay any longer. They entered the teleportation formation and left.

“Sect master, they didn’t even stop. This is also…”

Seeing the Dragon King and the rest leaving, one of the people standing beside the old man frowned and said unhappily.

“Those nine are godly dragons. They are the legendary godly dragons. Three of them are at the second level of a godly monarch.”

“The old man standing beside the dragon palanquin is the Tianchen divine emperor. I feel that he has already recovered to his peak.”

“Any one of the divine dragons can destroy all of us.”

The old man looked at his subordinates beside him and said calmly.

Behind him, everyone widened their eyes slightly. The dissatisfaction in their hearts immediately disappeared.

What a joke. To be able to make the divine dragons pull the carriage, to be able to make three divine emperor second stage divine dragons pull the carriage, to be able to make any one of the divine dragons that could destroy them, would they care about them?

Would they come down and greet them?

To be honest, the sky array divine emperor on the Dragon sedan nodded at them as a sign of respect.

“That Dragon Palace is too strong!”

“Sect master, did the Dragon Palace go to the eight desolates and six directions? Did they go to annihilate the eight desolates?”

Everyone asked in shock.

“Ga Ga Ga, this is too awesome. Divine Emperor, that old man was a divine emperor just now, and now he’s actually paying respects!”

At the same time, invincible battle technique, who was in the Void, was roaring with excitement.

A dignified divine emperor had to pay his respects to them when he met them.

They didn’t even need to pay attention to each other.

This made invincible battle technique full of pride and pride, even though he only benefited from it.

But the Dragon King was his boss. Who would dare to bully him in the future?

“Kid, your bloodline is not bad. You can join the Dragon Palace!”

Tian Chen looked at invincible battle technique and said with a smile.

“HM? Grandpa Tian Chen also said that my bloodline is not bad? Boss Wang also said so. My master also said so now. However, my master only knows that my bloodline potential is very high. He doesn’t know exactly how high it is. Grandpa Tian Chen, can you tell?”

Invincible battle technique asked with shining eyes.

“It’s no problem for me to become a universe master.”

Tian Chen asked with a smile.

“How strong? Is it as strong as the Godly Dragon?”

Invincible battle technique asked with sparkling eyes.

“Then you’re thinking too much.”

Tian Chen shook his head with a smile.

Upon hearing this, invincible battle technique revealed a helpless expression.

“My requirements aren’t high. It’s enough for me to advance to above the godly emperor level!”

He said, and then asked curiously, “Grandpa Tian Chen, what realm is above the god Emperor Realm? How powerful are universe Supreme Masters?”

“Above the void God Emperor Realm is a universe knight, and above the Universe Knight realm is a universe master. Above the universe master realm, there seems to be another realm. A Universe Knight is already a universe pinnacle great being.”

Tian Chen murmured, and his eyes were full of yearning.

Now that he had become a dragon wizard, he had some understanding of the level of the universe.

“The divine dragon has nine transformations, nine transformations is the venerable one, nine transformations is the ruler, and above the ruler is the heaven origin creation.”

At this moment, Wang Xian’s voice rang out.

Sitting in the Dragon sedan, he heard the conversation between Heaven Array and invincible battle techniques and spoke.

The Divine Dragon Clan was a Top-notch clan in the universe. However, after the nine transformations of the Divine Dragon, it was not the end of their cultivation.

If that was the end, then the Divine Dragon Clan would be the strongest in the universe and would not be destroyed.

The nine transformations of the Divine Dragon, nine transformations into one, the unity realm was the Master of the universe. This was the true master of the universe.

In the past, many Dragon Kings were at this realm.

And after this realm, there was the Heavenly Yuan realm of destiny. As for how this realm was raised, it all depended on destiny.

Seizing the Heaven and Earth’s destiny!

Such a strong person could be called invincible in the universe.
