Chapter 181: Ways of Obtaining the Spiritual Stones

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“I only have fifty pieces of Spiritual Stones!”

When Maniac Ji heard Wang Xian’s conditions, he frowned as he did not have that many Spiritual Stones.

“Tell me...where did you get yours from?” asked Wang Xian to Maniac Ji directly.

“Underworld’s missions. Spiritual Stones are very precious items for cultivation use. They are the hard currency in the underworld. Hence, some of the top-notch sects and families use them to trade,” Maniac Ji explained to Wang Xian.

“Missions?” Wang Xian raised his eyebrows with doubts.

“Everyone in the world earns money to survive. It’s the same for the underworld. There were many ways to do that, and it makes no difference, just like the modern world. But the underworld is more practical. You can log on to a website, and they have all kinds of missions. You can also set your own missions. All the sects and clans are gathered on the website!”

Maniac Ji looked at the computer next to him, and Wang Xian agreed.

Maniac Ji got on the computer and logged in to a special website. When he entered, the screen showed a message:

[With various sects and clans in the underworld, our heroes emerge.]

On the home page was all the various ranking charts.

Underworld’s Outstanding Experts, Doctors, Spiritual Medicines, Art of Cultivation, Young Heroes, Assassins, and more.

The charts piqued the curiosity of Wang Xian.

The happenings in the underworld were much to his surprise.

He clicked the medical ranking with some interest and scrolled to the eighteenth position. A name was on it with some comments.

[Miracle Doctors Chart No.18: Wang Xian]

[Age 20. Defeated Fang Huazi on Sep 17, this year. He crippled his arm and gained his fame overnight after this match. Replaced Fang Huazi’s ranking, but his competence in medical skills remained unknown. He has a Divine Dragon Medical Hall at the old street, Rivertown!]

“Hehe, this evaluation is quite to the point!” Wang Xian read the website with a face full of smiles.

“The founder of this website is Tianxiao Sacred Sect. No one can beat them in terms of information. There is a space dedicated to all kinds of missions with about 400 to 500 missions daily. Some of them are easy, some of them are difficult. Each mission has different rewards. You can also publish your mission and trade your items on the platform.”

Maniac Ji introduced the website to Wang Xian formally. Then he hesitated. “Since you want the Spiritual Stones, I can collect them for you. I’ll give you a hundred annually for 15 years. What do you think? Apart from that, you can command me whenever you need help. For the next 15 years, I’ll obey your instructions.”

With a hundred Spiritual Stones annually, that would make 1,500 pieces for 15 years. If these stones were converted into cash, it would be more than $100 billion.

On top of that, the Inborn Expert’s service for 15 years was added to the price paid.

“You can collect as many Spiritual Stones as possible. If I have other needs, I’ll find you again!” Wang Xian waved his hand as he spoke to Maniac Ji.

“Yes!” Maniac Ji hesitated before he nodded. “Miracle Doctor Wang, I have some Spiritual Medicine with me. I’ll get someone to send it over to you tomorrow.”

“Sure. I’ll give you an address later. You can deliver them to that place!” Wang Xian nodded.

“I’ll take my leave now!” Maniac Ji bowed and left.

Be it because of the power that Wang Xian displayed or the ability to cure his son, Wang Xian was someone who deserved Maniac Ji’s respect.

“I didn’t know there was such a website. How interesting.”

Wang Xian drew a smile on his face as he clicked on the Outstanding Experts of the underworld. The number one on the chart was Nie Wuhen, Sect Leader of Donghua Sacred Sect. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Number two was Hai Jiao, an island owner.

There were only twenty names on the Outstanding Experts Chart. Most of them were aces from the Sacred Sects.

There were eight Sacred Sects in the underworld which stood tall within the country.

Wang Xian read them with interest. Subsequently, he clicked on the missions page.

There were all kinds of missions including assassinations, looking for body-guards and seeking Spiritual Medicine.

Moreover, Wang Xian discovered that many missions were related to foreign disputes such as competing against and even killing experts from other countries.

There were some group missions for competing for some treasures.

“Unbelievable. It’s amazing!”

Wang Xian browsed the individual tasks to think of how he could earn those Spiritual Stones.

Currently, two ways could earn Spiritual Stones within the shortest possible time. One was to save people.

Another way was to sell Spiritual Medicine in exchange for Spiritual Stones. Both methods were the fastest ways.

Wang Xian preferred the second method. He just needed to spend over ten hours to make some Spiritual Medicine to exchange for 400 to 500 pieces of Spiritual Stone.

It should not be that difficult to get more than 10,000 pieces of them.

“Xiao Xian!”

Just then, Guan Shuqing’s surprising voice was heard from the outside. Wang Xian turned around with a smile on his face.

Guan Shuqing, in a white skirt, had obviously made an effort to doll herself up.

Her skirt, at knee length, was similar to a student skirt, revealing a pair of fair and beautiful legs.

She wore a shirt on top with her curvy bust lifted by her garment.

Such an attractive beauty!

“What are you looking at?!”

When Guan Shuqing saw Wang Xian’s look, she rolled her eyes. But her face had nothing but smiles.

“Hehe.” Wang Xian giggled. “I haven’t seen you for a long time, so I missed you. Since I missed you, I just want to look at you!”

“What a glib tongue!” Guan Shuqing pouted her lips slightly as she walked to his side.

Wang Xian shut his computer and stood up immediately. He walked to her and said, “Let’s go. I’ll bring you to the new house that I bought!”

“Great, let’s go. I want to check out the house!” Guan Shuqing smiled and nodded.

“We need to go back to school to pick up my bike first.”

“I drove today. My dad just bought me a car the other day.”

“Great. Come to think of it, I’m not a good boyfriend. I haven’t given you any presents before!”

“Hmph, now you know!”

“Should we go to the city center first to buy you some presents?”

“Another day. I want to go to your house and see if you’re keeping a mistress!”

“Haha, how can it be?!” Wang Xian and Guan Shuqing laughed as they came to the carpark.

Guan Shuqing’s dad had bought her a Maserati, which was costly too.

“Wow, it’s so beautiful over here. A house with a sea view!” Guan Shuqing walked into the villa and looked around in amazement.

Wang Xian drew a smile on his face, “Let’s go. I’ll take you to the roof. It’s more interesting upstairs!”

Wang Xian brought Guan Shuqing to the roof with enthusiasm.

“It’s so beautiful here!” Standing on the roof of the villa, Guan Shuqing looked out to the sea and exclaimed with happiness.

“Hehe, it’s your home from now on. How is it? Do you like it?”

Guan Shuqing blushed slightly and did not answer. She kept observing the surroundings with joy.

She ran happily on the roof, and her skirt was lifted slightly.

Pink!
