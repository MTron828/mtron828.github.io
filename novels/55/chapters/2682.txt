2683 Among the 2683 experts who had disappeared from the horizon sect

“Has anyone seen elder Yao and Deacon Song?”

“Has anyone noticed elder Yao and Deacon Song?”

When sect master horizon ordered a few elders and deacons to look for them, the group of people immediately took action. They swept their gaze into the Abyss and asked the rest of the experts and disciples when they found nothing out of the ordinary. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Elder Yao and Deacon Song? No sign!”

“No sign!”

Some of the Warriors and disciples shook their heads.

However very quickly, when the dozen warriors and disciples saw the elders looking for elder Yao and the others, they raised their eyebrows.

“Elder.”

An undying emperor level warrior moved and immediately flew towards the elders.

“HM? You saw elder Yao and the others?”

The Elders looked at the undying and immediately asked.

“It’s elder. When we were hunting the abyss seed, I saw elder Yao and Deacon song flying towards the starry sky on the left, I don’t know where exactly.”

The undying said.

“Flying to the left?”

The few elders looked at each other and frowned.

“Elder, we saw elder Yao and the others when we were hunting the abyss seed.”

“Elder, I saw them too.”

At this time, the disciples that received the news rushed over and reported to the few elders.

“You all saw elder Yao and the others heading to the left?”

The elders looked at them and asked.

“Yes Elder.”

The group nodded.

“Elder, not only elder song, there are also 50 to 60 warriors following them. One of my seniors has yet to receive any news.”

“At the end, I heard from that senior that they followed elder song to the side to hunt the abyss seed.”

At this time, one of the Undying Emperors spoke.

“To the left to kill the abyssal seed?”

The few elders frowned, their bodies moving, they immediately flew to the side.

“Patriarch, leader, a disciple saw elder Yao leading deacon song and 50 to 60 people to the left to hunt the abyssal seed.”

The few elders immediately said when they arrived.

“Eh? Go to the left? The left is the hunting area of the Dragon Palace and last month, right?”

One of the Patriarchs raised his eyebrows and said.

Several elders nodded.

“Go to the left and take a look. Don’t let them have a conflict.”

Sect Master Tianya said immediately.

“Yes!”

Several elders nodded.

“There’s no need to go into the abyss. The Dragon Peak has come out. Go and ask.”

The two ancestors looked to the left, with their vision, they could see the huge Dragon Mountain and said.

The elders nodded, their bodies moving, they immediately flew to the left.

The 4 were all undying level 9 warriors, they quickly arrived in front of Long Feng.

“HM? There’s no sign of the old monsters.”

The 4 looked at Long Feng before looking at the empty abyss, frowning.

“Let’s go and ask the people from the Dragon Palace.”

One of the world’s end elders looked at the Dragon Peak and flew over.

The other three world’s end elders followed behind.

“Everyone from the Dragon Palace!”

When the four world’s end sect elders arrived, Wang Xian and the rest noticed them.

The four of them floated about two kilometers in front of the command platform and shouted at Wang Xian and the rest.

“Four of you from the world margin sect, may I know what’s the matter?”

Wang Xian looked at the four of them and asked faintly.

“Dragon King, I wonder if Your Dragon Palace has seen elder Yao and the rest of us from the world margin sect.”

An elder from the world margin sect sized up Wang Xian and the surroundings before asking directly.

“Are the elders from your world margin sect here?”

...

Wang Xian looked at them and raised his eyebrows.

“Yes, they are here.”

The elder of the world margin sect nodded and said clearly.

“When we were hunting for the abyssal seeds, elder Yao told us to come here. Didn’t you run into them?”

An elder of the world margin sect narrowed his eyes and asked deliberately.

“HMM? Why did your world margin sect elder come to our side when you were hunting for Abyss Seeds?”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he looked at them and asked.

“Of course there’s something. Dragon King, just tell us if you have seen our world margin sect elder!”

One of the world margin sect elders said.

Wang Xian shook his head.

The four of them looked at each other and looked around in confusion.

...

“How could there not be any? Many disciples said to head to the left side of the abyss. There’s only the Dragon Palace Here!”

An elder transmitted his voice to the other three people.

“Indeed, that shouldn’t be the case. The old demon must have seen that there are too few abyss seeds in our side, so he brought his men to hunt here. Could it be that they are heading to the great sect of last month? After all, the Dragon Palace is much stronger than last month.”

Another elder made a guess.

“Let’s go. We will go to the great sect of last month to take a look.”

One of the elders immediately made a decision.

The other three nodded their heads.

“Sorry to disturb you!”

One of them spoke to Wang Xian and immediately flew to the left.

“Sky Formation, do you think they will know that it was us who did it?”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes slightly and said.

“The possibility of guessing us is very high.”

Tian Chen muttered to himself.

After all, a level 9 immortal king was not someone who could disappear just like that. There were very few forces that could do it.

“With our strength, what would happen if we were to fight against the world margin sect?”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered slightly.

“It would be difficult to destroy them, but they are no match for us.”

Heaven’s formation said confidently.

“I think so too. Then...”

Wang Xian looked at the four figures who had left with a glint in his eyes.

“Do you guys think that with the strength of the Dragon Palace, they can kill the old demon in an instant?”

At the same time, one of the four elders of the Heaven’s end sect who was flying to the left asked with a frown.

“I heard that the Dragon Palace is very strong, but he doesn’t dare to kill the old demon and the rest.”

An elder at the side replied.

The others also nodded as they listened. The Dragon Palace still didn’t dare to offend the world’s end sect.

“Last month, we’ve also killed all the abyssal seeds. Let’s go and ask some of them.”

The four looked ahead and found that experts from last month were flying out of the Abyss one after another. They glanced around but didn’t see the old demon and the others. They frowned and said.

“Haha, we were lucky this time. We got five abyss seeds, my strength can be increased a little.”

“I really envy you...”

At the edge of the battlefield last month, five to six undying emperor level warriors flew over with a smile.

“Everyone, have you seen an elder and over 60 god Emperor Warriors from our world margin sect!”

Suddenly, a voice sounded beside their ears.

The six of them were slightly startled. Soon after, they saw four elders appear in front of them.

“You are?”

“Elders from the world margin sect!”

When the six of them saw the four elders from the world margin sect, their pupils constricted slightly. They could not help but exclaim in surprise.
