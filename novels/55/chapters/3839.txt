3840 3839 Army of faith, exterminating all the gods T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The belief universe, during the last calamity, was able to exterminate a universe because of their belief method.

Take in the disciples of the Great Beings of that universe as believers, and then let them reproduce.

The living beings that reproduced continued to believe in them.

With this method, they conquered the entire universe.

They were prepared to use the same method to take in the great disciples of the nine-origin universe as believers and develop believers.

As for those that couldn’t be taken in, they would be killed directly.

If they could take in a large number of believers of the nine-origin universe, and the Great Disciples of the nine-origin universe were driven away, then the resources of the starry universe would be used by themselves.

Those that couldn’t be used would be used by the believers from the 9-origin universe.

When the believers’power increased, their power would also increase.

Killing three birds with one stone!

“Then make your move as soon as possible. 12 Top-tier warriors will block their escape route, and the other 12 top-tier warriors will confront them head-on.”

One of the gods spoke, took out their communication devices, and sent a message.

The gods from the other palaces also passed down orders.

In these tens of millions of years, they had all used special methods to obtain the combat power of the Tier 9 gods!

Some were level 6 space beasts that had been taken in as believers, and some were battle puppets condensed from the power of faith.

The 24 palaces had created powerful treasures in these tens of millions of years.

An existence that could occupy two universes was not that simple.

The top races of the nine-origin universe did not know that the belief universe was preparing to attack the disciples of the Great Beings of the nine-origin universe.

At this moment, because the witch clan had revealed their powerful combat strength and killed a large number of the gods of belief, the other top races were not willing to be outdone. They took out their trump cards one by one.

These trump cards had only been created in the recent tens of millions of years!

They also began to hunt down the gods of faith.

…

“Eh? What a terrifying energy of faith there. There are a large number of experts and disciples of the universe of faith there.”

Wang Xian was flying rapidly within the domain of the universe of faith.

He flew towards the center of the universe of Stars for two years.

During these two years, he didn’t encounter any gods or disciples who believed in the cosmos.

But at this moment, he suddenly sensed a majestic belief energy coming from the left and back.

This made his eyes shine.

He could sense this majestic belief energy from a great distance.

This energy was even more majestic than the Void Spirit treasured land!

This meant that there were more than 10,000 gods of the universe in that direction!

Furthermore, their strength was extremely terrifying!

“They are flying towards the right!”

Wang Xian sensed it and with a thought, the tai chi dragon disc around his body appeared and slowly concealed him.

He was in the yin-yang space and was flying towards the direction of the Majestic Faith Energy!

After flying for more than ten minutes, Wang Xian immediately saw a faith army flying towards the front.

Yes, this was an army, a powerful army.

There were more than a million faith gods and their disciples. Wang Xian took a glance and saw that there were around 80,000 gods.

The remaining one million were all elite believers of the Faith Universe!

They were all experts that were comparable to venerables at the seventh rank or above.

Among them, there were also over 100 level 7 gods!

This number was truly terrifying!

In addition, in the center of the belief Army was a space beast. This was a level 6 space beast.

This space beast should be controlled by the belief gods.

On the space beast were more than 100 level seven gods.

This army of gods was flying forward rapidly.

This caused Wang Xian’s eyes to sparkle with astonishment.

He hesitated for a moment and decided to make a move. With so many gods, destroying them would bring huge resources to the Dragon Palace.

As for what they were going to do, he would know after checking out a few of them alive!

He moved and flew towards the spot in front of them.

Wang Xian was hiding in the void as he arrived in front of them. He was unleashing the Taiji Dragon disc at full force while the five elements millstone was ready to attack at any time.

He was even prepared to take out the soul battleship and the soul spear at any time to deal a fatal blow to the Army of faith.

The Army of faith soon arrived in his line of sight. Wang Xian stared at them calmly. He was prepared to attack immediately when the enemy reached his side!

The Space Beast flew and approached him. It didn’t sense Wang Xian.

The powerhouses of the gods on the space beast didn’t sense him either.

“Huh?”

However, when they were not far from Wang Xian, they were in the middle of the group of level seven gods of the space beast.

An old man was sitting in the middle with his legs crossed. He was holding a bead in his hand. He closed his eyes and kept moving his mouth.

Suddenly, he opened his eyes and looked at the bead of faith in his hand!

On the bead, he saw that he was about to die!

“Not good, there’s an ambush. Be careful!”

His eyes focused, and he immediately shouted loudly.

He waved his arm, and the bead in his hand immediately floated in the air in front of him!

“What?”

“Be careful!”

The elder of the gods suddenly cried out in alarm, and the expressions of the surrounding tier 7 gods changed. Without the slightest hesitation, the power of faith on their bodies trembled, and with a wave of their arms, boundless and terrifying power of faith surged into the Pearl!

“Defend!”

A Tier 7 god Roared!

The gazes of the surrounding gods and disciples of the Army of one million believers focused, and they instantly entered battle mode!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The Space Beast, who was a ruler of level six, also roared as he scanned his surroundings.

Waves of energy charged forward.

“I was actually discovered? However, I have already entered my attack range. Die!”

Wang Xian’s eyes focused as a cold expression appeared on his face.

With a wave of his arm, the five elements grinding appeared in front of them instantly, covering the entire starry sky.

Countless five elements attacking numinous treasures were heading towards them!

The Tai Chi Dragon Disc also started to move and flew towards the space below them.

An incomparably huge tai chi diagram appeared below them in an instant.

The tai chi started to revolve and a terrifying aura rose upwards.

Light and darkness revolved and interweaved with each other to revolve rapidly, crushing everything above them!

At the same time, a soul spear appeared in Wang Xian’s hand. He aimed it at the level six cosmic behemoth!

“Oh no! Be careful! Defend with all your might!”

The level seven elders of the gods in the center of the Qianyuan Palace looked horrified when they saw the five elements Millstone and the Tai Chi Dragon Plate that appeared above and below them in an instant!

On the belief bead in the sky, it was clear that they were being killed!

It meant that they were invincible!

They would be killed!
