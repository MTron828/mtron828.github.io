Chapter 2865: bright starry sky, Dragon King 6 of the Dragon Palace

“If you eight desolates want to start a war, my dragon palace will accept it!”

When these words rang out, everyone’s bodies trembled when they heard them.

This was especially so for the experts and disciples of the eight desolates. They gulped, their eyes filled with shock and fear.

Not long ago, the protector of the eight desolates who held a horsetail whisk once said proudly, “We, the eight desolates, must kill him. We will ask them if the divine emperor of Shangshui and the Saint Realm want to start a war with the eight desolates.”.

Now, the Dragon King had completely returned the sentence.

If the eight Barrens wanted to start a war, the Dragon Palace would take it.

These were the words of the leader of the Dragon Palace. His words represented the entire Dragon Palace.

And now, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace was about to destroy the celestial emperor of wind destruction. If the eight barrens wanted to avenge him, the Dragon Palace would take it.

When the Celestial Emperor of wind destruction heard Wang Xian’s words, his body trembled violently. His eyes revealed a look of fear.

He was a little flustered!

Under the circumstances where he was severely injured, his greatest reliance was on the eight barrens.

By relying on the might of the eight barrens, the Dragon King and the rest were fearful.

But now, the Dragon King wanted him to die!

Furthermore, he had also heard the middle-aged man’s exclamation earlier.

This space was sealed.

He understood the celestial emperor of Heaven’s formation. He had participated in the battle tens of millions of years ago.

He knew that the Tianchen divine emperor could seal a space, but even the divine emperor could not return to his divine kingdom in an instant.

Clearly, this space had been sealed too!

In other words, he had no way out!

“The Dragon King wants to kill the wind destruction divine emperor!”

Everyone watched this scene in a daze.

Who would have thought that this would be the situation? Who would have thought that this young man was the Dragon King.

“Gulp!”

The three guardians of the eight barrens and the elders and disciples were drenched in cold sweat. They wanted to kill the god Emperor of wind destruction, but what about them?

“Dragon King, if you dare to kill me, our eight barrens will definitely not let your dragon palace off.”

“All of you have always been enemies with the imperial court. Now that you have provoked our eight barrens, aren’t you afraid that we will join forces?”

The god of wind destruction stared at Wang Xian with blood-red eyes. His expression changed as he growled in a low voice.

“This is not something that a dead person like you can worry about. Since you want to fight, we will take it!”

Wang Xian said indifferently as he looked at the eight-limbed demonic fiend beside him. “Kill him!”

Kill him!

These two words determined the fate of the god of wind destruction.

“It’s the Dragon King. TSK TSK TSK. He still wants to kill us, the Dragon King. He’s courting death!”

The eight-limbed demon fiend duo locked onto God Emperor Wind destruction, their eyes filled with killing intent.

“Boom!”

At the next moment, their bodies moved and directly attacked God Emperor Wind destruction.

“No!”

God Emperor Wind Destruction’s face was covered in cold sweat as he roared. He scanned his surroundings and wanted to escape.

“Boom! Boom!”

However, at this moment, the eight-limbed demon fiend and the eight-limbed demon fiend had already sealed off all his positions. The terrifying darkness energy completely covered him.

“No!”

As he felt death enveloping him, god Emperor Wind Destruction let out a final furious roar!

“Peng!”

The attack covered him. He, who was already heavily injured, instantly lost all his life force.

Eight desolates, God Emperor Wind Destruction had fallen!

Seeing god Emperor wind destruction being killed, everyone’s bodies trembled.

“No, no, no. We, eight desolates, will not let you off. We, eight desolates, will not let you off!”

The three elders of the eight desolates saw that the life force of God Emperor Wind Destruction had completely disappeared, and they shouted in despair and panic.

Their bodies moved, and they frantically fled outside.

Some disciples trembled slightly, wanting to escape back to their divine kingdoms.

“Hehehe, a bunch of death-seeking things!”

Mo Sha waved his arm, and dark skeletons attacked them one after another.

“Ahhhh!”

Screams of pain rang out as the strong disciples of the eight barrens were quickly killed.

When everyone around saw this scene, their scalps went numb.

Killed, all of them!

One Celestial Emperor and all the other disciples of the eight barrens were all killed by the Celestial Emperor of the Dragon Palace.

It was so straightforward. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Eh? There are still a few trash who are courting death!”

At this moment, an image appeared in front of the heaven array beside Wang Xian.

In the image was what happened before they arrived.

“What is this?”

Invincible battle technique widened his eyes and leaned over to look over.

Hong Fengyan also looked over and recognized that this was the technique of a powerful array master.

“There are still small fries?”

Ba Qi flew over and looked at the screen with a cold look in his eyes.

When everyone around heard the words of the heaven array and Ba Qi, their foreheads were filled with cold sweat.

This was especially so for those who had mocked Wang Xian not long ago. Their bodies were stiff and cold sweat was dripping down their foreheads.

The disciples of the eight barrens had all been killed, the trash they were talking about.

“HMPH, you think you can humiliate our Dragon King?”

At this moment, Ba Qi waved his arm and black lines shot toward the people around him.

“No, no, sir, no…”

The terrified voices stopped abruptly. More than ten figures were killed in an instant.

“Alright, let’s Go!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across and said to Tian Cheng and the rest.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Tian Cheng nodded. Ba Qi and the rest immediately put away the corpses around them.

Buzz

Sky Array waved its arm and the nine-colored space disappeared.

“Let’s go, Invincible. Let’s catch up. You guys should come too!”

Wang Xian looked at invincible battle technique, Hong Fengyan and the rest and said.

“Wahahaha, invincible battle technique is going to be rich! I’m going to be rich! Hahaha, boss Wang, you’re too awesome! You’re too awesome! The Dragon Palace is too awesome!”

Invincible, who had been standing at the back with his mouth agape, finally realized what was going on. He jumped up and down excitedly.

“Boss Wang, from now on, Invincible is your most loyal subordinate!”

He hugged Wang Xian’s thigh excitedly once again and shouted with a straight face.

The Dragon Palace!

Just by listening to the discussions of the people around him, he knew how awesome the Dragon Palace was!

And the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace was his invincible boss in terms of battle techniques. If he was invincible in terms of battle techniques, wouldn’t he be going to heaven?

In the future, who would dare to provoke him in this bright starry sky?

Now that he had the divine emperor’s master, he was still very awesome. However, in the eight desolates and six harmonies, he still had to be wary of the eight desolates.

Now that the boss was the Dragon King, he didn’t even need to bother about the eight desolates!

“You’ve gotten older, but your IQ hasn’t changed!”

Wang Xian kicked his body and said in a speechless manner.

“Hahaha, I’m invincible in battle techniques, but I have to hug your thigh tightly. Other people can’t hug me even if they want to, Haha!”

Invincible in battle techniques jumped up and said with a grin.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian patted his shoulder and looked at Hong Fengyan who was beside him.

“Okay!”

Hong Fengyan looked at him and smiled. “Alright, Dragon King!”

Wang Xian smiled and flew out of the windless forest.

Behind him, Ao Yaoyao, the eight-limbed demon of the Heaven Formation, followed him immediately.

Ye Lui Ying and the rest followed behind him in a daze.

“Haha, Tianxin, I’ll go talk to boss Wang Xian first. I’ll look for you in a few days!”

Invincible waved his hand to the side.
