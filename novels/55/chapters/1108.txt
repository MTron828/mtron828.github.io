Translator: 5496903

“Rise!”

Feng Luan looked at the people kneeling in front of her and revealed a faint smile on her face.

She had finally taken her first step!

She turned around and looked at Wang Xian with gratitude in her eyes.

Wang Xian shrugged. “Let’s go out!”

“Okay!”

Feng Luan nodded and followed beside him.

Wang Xian walked out of the mayor’s Hall and flew directly to the central tower.

Feng Luan moved and followed closely behind him.

Jin Qianyuan and the rest didn’t hesitate and followed behind him.

They knew that the time for the establishment of the dynasty had arrived!

Wang Xian was floating in the sky above Shenghai town while Feng Luan stood beside him.

“Citizens of Shenghai town, I am Wang Xian. Today, I have something important to announce!”

Wang Xian looked down and shouted in a deep voice.

In an instant, Wang Xian’s voice spread across the entire Shenghai town.

“Oh? It’s master Wang?”

“Master Wang has an announcement to make. Hurry up and come out!”

“Come out, come out! Put down what you are doing and come out!”

With just one sentence from Wang Xian, everyone in Shenghai town put down what they were doing and walked out of their houses. Some were standing on the streets while others were standing in the courtyard.

Basically, everyone walked out of their houses and raised their heads to look at Wang Xian who was in the sky.

“From today onwards, I will hand over Shenghai town to my family next to me. Her name is Feng!”

“Today, Feng will use Shenghai town as the starting point to establish the dragon and Phoenix dynasty. In the future, Shenghai Town will become a citizen of the dragon and Phoenix Dynasty!”

Wang Xian shouted loudly again and his voice entered everyone’s ears.

Everyone was slightly stunned as they looked at the beautiful figure beside Wang Xian in astonishment.

Boom

Feng Luan moved her feet lightly as a warm flame was emitted from her body.

“I am Feng. Today, I will use Shenghai town as the imperial city to establish the dragon-phoenix Dynasty!”

While everyone was in a daze, Feng Luan spoke directly.

At the same time, streams of warm flames were emitted from her body. The Flames blocked the radiance of the sun and emitted a warm radiance that made everyone feel warm.

Everyone in holy sea town had shocked expressions on their faces as they stared blankly at the infinitely enlarged Phoenix in the sky.

“I am the king. All living things in the dragon and Phoenix dynasty are equal. The people are not affected by hunger and cold!”

“I am the king. All living things in the dragon and Phoenix dynasty are safe and undisturbed by Fierce Beasts!”

“I am the king. All living things in the dragon and Phoenix dynasty can strive to become stronger!”

“I am the king, and all beings in the dragon and Phoenix dynasty are invincible, fearless and without fear!”

Feng Luan’s voice resounded in everyone’s mind. Everyone widened their eyes and slowly opened their mouths.

Equality, peace, self-improvement, and invincibility!

These grand ambitions shocked everyone.

“Today, the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty is established, and I am the king. The city will be expanded and the dragon and Phoenix Academy will be established. The first principal of the academy will be Yu Chengzi, a rank two insightful void martial artist. Every child will have a chance to become a peerless expert!”

Feng Luan’s face revealed endless dignity as she slowly walked over.

“I am Yu Chengzi. Everyone, please advise me!”

When Feng Luan spoke of Yu Chengzi, the middle-aged man holding the feather fan directly flew into the sky and looked down at all the people below. He cupped his fists and said.

“The Dragon and Phoenix Empire will establish the dragon and Phoenix City Guards. The commander, Yan Wenshan, is a rank two profound void martial artist!”

Feng Luan continued to speak.

“I am Yan Wenshan. Please enlighten me!”

The middle-aged man holding the red staff flew into the sky and cupped his fists at everyone.

“The dragon and Phoenix Dynasty has established the Dragon and Phoenix Army. There are 1,200 people in the army. The commander, Mang Hong, is at rank three of the profound void Martial Stage!”

“I am Mang Hong. Please enlighten me!”

“Dragon and Phoenix Army, Please Enlighten Me!”

The middle-aged man holding the Big Saber flew into the sky and shouted loudly.

The 1,200 experts of the Dragon and Phoenix Corps flew into the sky at the same time and shouted at everyone in holy sea town.

“Today, Holy Sea Town will be renamed Dragon and Phoenix City!”

Feng Luan finally announced. When he finished saying this, he waved his arm.

One after another, feng shui compasses floated around him.

“Buzz Buzz Buzz!”

One after another, feng shui compasses instantly formed a large array.

“Rain formation, rank 4 void interpretation formation. Lives in dragon-phoenix city. People don’t get sick. Their bodies are cleansed!”

“Wind pattern formation, rank 5 void interpretation formation, city defense formation. The formation can release rank 4 void interpretation attacks to attack intruders!”

“Boundless spirit formation, rank 5 void interpretation formation. Gathers spiritual energy within a thousand miles. increases the concentration of spiritual energy in dragon-phoenix city by five times!”

“Ming-qing array, third-grade void interpretation array, auxiliary array. It can make people’s minds clear!”

Rays of light covered holy sea town as Feng Luan spoke one by one.

Following her actions and her words, all the people in holy sea town could feel the changes in their surroundings.

When they heard the level and function of this array, all of their faces revealed shocked expressions. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Many people’s bodies trembled.

Heavens, what is this?

Four powerful array formations at the profound void tier. Under these four array formations, holy sea town was definitely a paradise!

Even the array formation in star-moon city was far inferior to it, right?

Even some of the empire’s large cities had such an array formation?

First, it was Feng Luan’s grand wish, then the profound void experts they looked up to, and finally, this priceless array formation.

It was no exaggeration to say that this array could buy their sacred sea town!

However, as the citizens of sacred sea town, they were a little stunned at first, but now they were a little excited.

Oh My God, we can actually live in such a city?

This is completely the transformation of thatched cottages and villas!

Below, even Jin Qianyuan and the others were trembling at Feng Luan’s grand gesture.

They knew what this array meant and what it meant for the future of the holy sea town under these arrays!

Grand gesture, grand gesture!

She was really going to use the holy sea town as a starting point to build a powerful kingdom!

At the thought of Wang Xian’s words, they were all excited again.

“We are willing to be the citizens of the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty. We are willing to make you the Phoenix King!”

“Long live the Phoenix King!”

Jin Qianyuan and the rest looked at each other. He could see the shock in each other’s eyes.

The group of people knelt on the ground and shouted loudly!

“We are willing to be the citizens of the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty. We are willing to serve you as the Phoenix King!”

“Long live the Phoenix King!”

Jin Qianyuan and the rest took the lead. The rest of the citizens of holy sea town quickly shouted loudly as they slowly knelt on the ground.

Not to mention the great ambitions that the queen had said, the things that she had brought out were worthy of their kneeling!

Moreover, with the queen and her subordinates in the future, why would holy sea town be afraid of Demon Beasts attacking the city?

Just now, many people had seen with their own eyes that her subordinates, who were floating in the sky, had directly killed the leader of the blood barbaric demon beasts.

He had exterminated the ocean cultivator army and the general who wanted to kill them within a minute!
