Chapter 1515: On the 1515 purification bar

The carriage started. According to the old lady’s brief introduction, Wang Xian had a rough understanding of them.

There were four female students. Among them, three of them were priests of light who were temporarily hired by the hiring association. They possessed the strength of a level five supernatural being.

The other female student who was wearing the uniform of the holy herb medicine shop belonged to the internal staff of the Holy Herb Medicine Shop.

She had the strength of a transcendent level seven.

The three middle-aged women and the old man were also internal staff of the Holy Medicine Clinic.

As the car left the city, Wang Xian took out a book about the priest of light from his interspatial ring.

These books were all cultivation methods that he bought when he came to the Divine Light Imperial City.

Many of them were bought by him at a high price.

The radiant priest was a very special profession, and it was also a relatively new profession.

Currently, the strongest radiant priest was an ancestor of the divine light empire, who had a cultivation base of level 8 insight void tier.

It was said that the ancestor of the Divine Light Empire had a terrifying healing ability, and it was said that as long as he did not die, he could be saved.

However, the radiant priest had a fatal flaw, and that was that his combat ability was relatively weak.

Perhaps even a radiant priest at the second level of the void interpretation stage was not a match for a powerhouse at the peak of the first level of the void interpretation stage.

Due to his weak combat ability, there were very few strong people who chose this job.

However, a powerful radiant priest had a very strong role in a team.

“You shouldn’t be a student of the Divine Light Priest Academy, right? There are very few male students in the Priest Academy. I don’t think you are one of them!”

Just as Wang Xian was flipping through the books, a female student’s curious voice came from the side.

The female student’s eyes flickered slightly as she looked at the young priest.

Wang Xian, who was sitting there calmly, gave off a feeling of quietness.

In addition to his extraordinary good looks and outstanding temperament, she couldn’t help but ask.

“No!”

Wang Xian shook his head lightly.

“Did you join the radiant priest’s Profession Halfway?”

The other girls looked at Wang Xian and revealed a faint smile.

One of the girls shook her head even more.

Joining the radiant priest’s profession halfway meant that he wasn’t professional. Furthermore, it also meant that he wasn’t strong enough. Otherwise, why would he join Halfway.

Wang Xian nodded.

“It’s fine if he joined Midway. When the time comes, you can follow behind Old Hu and help him treat some people who are weak!”

“Speaking of which, Old Hu joined the profession of the priest of light halfway. Now, he is somewhat famous in our holy medicine shop!”

The old woman said to Wang Xian lightly.

“How can it be the same? Old Hu used to be a powerful warrior. If he was not eroded by the darkness in the ruins of the divine kingdom, he might have become a voidwalker now!”

A girl said to the one-legged old man in a fawning manner.

“Hehe, things are pretty good now. Pretty Good!”

The old man smiled faintly. Although his face was a little ferocious, he was very amiable.

He looked at Wang Xian and said with a smile, “You are still young. Learn More!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile.

The car quieted down once again. Wang Xian flipped through the book in his hand.

The rest of the people were either cultivating or closing their eyes to rest. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

When the girl found out that Wang Xian had switched his cultivation to the radiant priest, she stopped talking to him.

This was the world of the strong. It was useless for a person who had achieved nothing. No matter how handsome he was, it would be useless.

Wang Xian was also happy to be in peace. One by one, the divine powers of light were imprinted into his body.

Holy Light, healing, exorcism, Light Shield, light rain, purification, light speech, hand of divine light, powerful healing, finger regeneration...

There were more than ten types of supernatural powers. Among them, there were many techniques related to the use of light energy.

It could also be due to the heart of light and darkness. Wang Xian saw the cultivation methods related to these supernatural powers and quickly comprehended them.

The system notifications kept ringing out.

Following that, he converted these supernatural powers into dharma idols. The process was extremely smooth as he directly comprehended the three dharma idols of Holy Light, healing, and exorcism.

The car quickly flew in the air and headed towards the ruins of the divine kingdom.

The ruins of the divine kingdom was one of the most important areas in the vast region. It was also a place that all the factions hoped to control.

The so-called ruins of the divine kingdom was a domain created by a powerful longevity realm expert. It was a divine kingdom created for him to become a god.

However, it was clear that the once peerless expert had not broken through to a higher realm.

Wanshou was also known as a demigod. If a demigod wanted to break through to God, they had to have their own divine kingdom.

That area was also the origin of the ruins of the divine kingdom.

“Rest for an hour and build a fire to eat!”

After driving for about a day, the cars outside stopped.

The people from the judicial mercenary group shouted at them.

“Go out and eat something!”

The old woman said to them and walked out immediately.

A few women and girls walked out immediately.

Wang Xian got out of the car and looked around at the endless grassland.

“Beautiful lady, I have some delicious conch meat here. Do you want to eat it together?”

The young man named Li Si said to a girl.

“Sure!”

The girl walked over happily and sat with the young man.

Wang Xian took out some simple food from his interspatial ring and started to eat.

“Young man, have some cooked food!”

At this moment, the old man walked over and handed Wang Xian a piece of meat.

“Thank you, Uncle Hu!”

Wang Xian smiled and took it without hesitation.

“Do you want some wine?”

Old Hu was very old. He was at least a thousand years old and had the strength of a half-step void interpretation.

He held a wine flask and gestured to Wang Xian.

“No, I like tea!”

Wang Xian shook his head. He took out a teacup from his interspatial ring and poured himself a cup.

“Haha, Young Man, with your attitude, you are very close to the priest of light. The priest is not bad too. At least he can live longer!”

Old Hu said with a smile.

“Drinking tea and being a priest of light can calm people down. I don’t like killing!”

Wang Xian said plainly.

“You don’t like killing? In this world, everyone can’t escape from killing!”

Old Hu shook his head. He took a big bite of meat and a sip of wine. Then, he laid back on the chair leisurely. “If you don’t like killing, I can tell you a way. You Don’t have to kill!”

“Oh?”

Wang Xian looked at Old Hu curiously. “What Way?”

“Purify it. Haha, Purify All Filth and All Evil!”

As Old Hu spoke, he couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

Wang Xian was slightly stunned when he heard Old Hu’s words. “Then what is Evil?”

“Evil? There is no evil. Tell me, that Sky Demon destroyed more than a million lives in the ancient demon city and seven demon lords. Do you think he is Evil?”

“In the eyes of some people, he’s a Sky Demon, the most terrifying and evil existence. However, in the eyes of some people, he destroyed more than a million sinners. He’s a good person, a kind person!”

The old man slowly said.
