Chapter 948: Level up 0949!

Translator: 549690339

“There is a huge gap between the level of insight void and transcendence. Ao Yao who is at level seven of transcendence, or even ao Yao who is at level eight of transcendence, might not be able to fight against the Insight Void!”

“First, I need to upgrade ao Yao to level six of transcendence. Next, I need to upgrade my other abilities!”

Wang Xian thought to himself.

The biggest area between the insight void and transcendence was the transformation of supernatural powers.

Transcendents cultivated their supernatural powers. When they reached the insightful emptiness realm, they would transform their supernatural powers into dharma images, increasing their power by dozens of times.

This was a powerful watershed. It was very difficult to cross this threshold and fight across levels.

After resting for a while, Wang Xian led the group of Drakonids to the Dragon Palace.

As Wang Xian expected, the group of corpses of the level eight and level seven transcendents elevated ao Yaoyao to level six of the transcendents.

In addition, two supernatural realm’s strange demons were elevated to level five supernatural realm!

In the sea area of the supernatural continent, those strange demons that were elevated to level two supernatural realm also began to hunt ferocious beasts.

Now, the development speed of the Dragon Palace was more than ten times faster than before.

More and more members of the Dragon Palace broke through to the supernatural realm. Such a terrifying development speed was absolutely shocking.

This time, Wang Xian stayed in the Dragon Palace for two days. He even woke up Shu Qing and the other girls.

This time, when he returned and left, it might not be as easy as staying in Shenghai town.

Donghai city was very far away from Shenghai town. It would take four to five days to reach Donghai city from Shenghai Town!

At that time, he would only return once every two to three months at most.

After Wang Xian spent a good day with the group of girls, he made them unable to get out of bed. Then, he led ao Yao and the rest to leave again.

The group of girls began their closed-door cultivation once again.

“Two days is pretty punctual!”

When Wang Xian had just returned to Shenghai Town, manager Liu’s message was sent over.

Wang Xian walked toward the Fengxian Elixir and weapons workshop with a smile on his face.

“Leader Wang!”

Upon seeing Wang Xian’s arrival, manager Liu and manager Yi hurried over. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Manager Yi, who had just left for a few days, rushed over immediately after learning that Wang Xian had bought 200 million middle-grade spirit stones in one go.

If not for the recent setback to the Fengxian Elixir and weapons workshop, there might have been people of even higher status coming over.

“Are the elixirs ready?”

Wang Xian walked over and asked directly.

“Alright, Alright. Commander Wang, let’s take a look inside!”

200 million middle-grade spirit stones was not considered a lot. A transcendent seventh-grade elixir was worth more than 10 million middle-grade spirit stones.

However, the preciousness of these elixirs was self-evident.

Wang Xian took a look and was very satisfied. He handed over 200 million middle-grade spirit stones directly to them.

“Leader Wang, it’s really a pleasure to work with you. In the future, if you need to purchase elixirs, you can tell manager Liu directly. We will prepare them in advance. It will be more convenient for You Then!”

After the transaction was completed, manager Yi said with excitement.

“That’s right, leader Wang. In the future, if you need elixirs, tell me in advance!”

Manager Liu quickly agreed.

“I’m afraid I Won’t be in Shenghai town in two days!”

Wang Xian looked at them and said with a smile, “I’ll head to Donghai City tomorrow and enter the Demon Hunters Academy!”

“Commander Wang, you’re going to Donghai City?”

Manager Yi was slightly taken aback, then, he quickly said, “What a coincidence. I’m in charge of the Fengxian Elixir and weapons workshop in Donghai City. Commander Wang, if you need anything, you can come and look for me. You can also tell me directly if you want to buy elixirs!”

“Is that so?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and said, “That’s good. I might really need supervisor Yi’s help with something!”

“Don’t worry, leader Wang. I’m more familiar with Donghai city. Just tell me if there’s anything I can help you with!”

Supervisor Yi’s eyes lit up as he said.

“Okay, then I’ll have to trouble supervisor Yi to help me find a courtyard that is slightly better. When the time comes, I’ll go and take a look. Is that Alright?”

Wang Xian said without any trace of politeness.

“Don’t worry, leave it to me. When leader Wang is new here, I’ll treat you well!”

Supervisor Yi agreed with a smile on his face.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile. After exchanging a few more pleasantries, he left Fengxian and walked towards his residence.

“Let’s talk about it after I’ve improved my strength!”

When he entered the room, Wang Xian placed the pills into his mouth one by one.

“Ding! Consuming a level 6 transcendent pill to extract 1,800 Dragon Crystals!”

“Ding! Consuming A Level 7 transcendent pill to extract 7,500 Dragon Crystals!”

...

“Ding! Congratulations to host for increasing your level to level 5 transcendent!”

“Ding! Congratulations to host for comprehending the supernatural powers of light and darkness!”

Members of the Dragon Palace: 3,355

“The next upgrade will cost a million dragon crystals. F * ck, if it is converted to middle-grade spirit stones, it will cost more than one billion. That’s too much!”

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth twitched. More than one billion spirit stones. He did not know how long it would take to earn it.

Looking at the additional 60,000 dragon crystals, Wang Xian immediately called Ao Yao and the rest over.

One by one, they imparted their dragon Qi to them.

After consuming more than 60,000 dragon crystals, all the strange demons and Golden Swordfish were upgraded to transcendent-level rank-4.

The further they went, the more the strange demons and Golden Swordfish needed tens of thousands of dragon crystals.

It was becoming more and more difficult to upgrade their strength.

Eighteen Strange Demons had reached transcendent-level rank-4.

Two strange demons were at transcendent-level rank-5.

Ao demons were at transcendent-level rank-6!

Ten Golden Swordfish were at transcendent-level four.

In addition to Wang Xian who was at transcendent-level five, this was the top-notch strength of the Dragon Palace.

“Although it will be harder and harder to level up in the future, my strength is pretty good now!”

Wang Xian was already very satisfied with the fact that he had reached such a level in less than a month.

“With this strength, I should be able to mingle around in Donghai City!”

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly as he walked straight to the location of the Demon Hunters Association.

The holy sea town had been unusually lively for the past few days. After the monsters attacked the city, many chambers of commerce came from all over the place.

There were the most chambers of commerce from Donghai City. Wang Xian was prepared to accept an escort mission and head to Donghai City.

“There is a large mission on the mission stone plate. Escort the Chamber of Commerce back to Donghai City and recruit at least 20 mercenary groups!”

“According to the level of the mercenary groups, the level of the mission will be determined. Such a large-scale escort mission is rare!”

“It just so happens that the fairy phoenix mercenary group can follow this caravan to Donghai City!”

Wang Xian thought to himself as he walked into the demon hunting mercenary group.

The moment he entered the mercenary group, Wang Xian realized that the hall of the mercenary group today was different from the past.

In the entire hall, there were rows and rows of personnel from the Chamber of Commerce. There were at least a dozen of personnel from the Chamber of Commerce. Every Chamber of Commerce was recruiting mercenary groups!
