“Heaven’s Pride Stage?”

Wang Xian murmured as he watched Ling Jian ‘er leave.

Heaven’s pride stage, one of the four great ruins of the blood stream sect. It was a famous place for young geniuses.

On the Heaven’s pride stage, all cultivators under the age of 50 could step into the Heaven’s pride stage.

On the Heaven’s pride stage, there were only 20 Heaven’s pride disciples. Becoming one of the Top 20 Heaven’s pride disciples would bring immense benefits.

Firstly, The Prodigy stage had a special place for the prodigies to cultivate. According to the rankings of the prodigies, the spiritual energy in the training area was different.

It was said that the number one prodigy’s training area was ten times more than the outside world. It could even help one comprehend divine abilities inside.

This was definitely a terrifying paradise.

Even if it was the top twenty, it would have twice the increase in spiritual energy. There was also the god awakening tree inside to maintain the abundance of spiritual energy.

As long as one could enter the heaven’s pride stage, not only would a warrior be able to obtain a powerful training ground, they would also be able to become famous throughout the world.

To be able to enter the Heaven’s pride list, one could basically be said to be one of the Top 20 Heaven’s pride sons in the entire Liuhai region.

As long as one could enter, one would receive the attention of tens of thousands of people. One would be heavily nurtured by the families and dynasties.

He would be roped in by countless powerful forces. There would be endless benefits.

It could be said that if he ascended to that position, wealth, beauties, and fame would be within his reach!

“So there’s a reward for ascending to the prodigy roll. If I had known earlier, I would have gone there myself!”

Wang Xian had obtained the information from Long Xiaotian. He didn’t have this information. If he hadn’t heard from Ling Jian ‘er, she wouldn’t have known about it.

“I’ll go over and take a look tomorrow!”

Thinking of how Ling Jian ‘ER would be able to obtain 5,000 spiritual liquid in half a month, Wang Xian was extremely tempted.

He stood in the courtyard and practiced his combined attribute attacks. Each attack could create a terrifying power.

As long as he exerted force, he could easily flatten the courtyard where he lived.

After practicing for a while, he went back to his room to rest. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The next morning, Wang Xian walked out of his room. He looked at the map and flew toward the center of the cemetery.

The four great sites of the Blood Stream sect were all located at the center. There were often hostile demonic beasts roaming around that area.

There were even demonic beasts that tried to assassinate humans.

That was where the real meat grinder was. Thousands of humans would die every day.

The Heaven’s pride stage was relatively safer. It was located at the outermost location of the four great ruins.

Moreover, all the people gathered there were young men below the age of 50. They were all outstanding young men who wanted to be on the Heaven’s pride roll.

For those young men who were not qualified to be on the Heaven’s pride roll, they could also spar, fight, or even fight on the heaven’s pride stage.

The entire Heaven’s pride roll was extremely lively.

Wang Xian’s strength had increased greatly and his speed had also increased by several times.

There were two heaven’s pride rolls in the human-demon graveyard. One was the Human Heaven’s pride roll and the other belonged to the Demonic Beast Heaven’s pride roll.

The Human Heaven’s pride roll was located in the forest while the Demonic Beast Heaven’s pride roll was located in the ocean.

The distance between the two was not very far. It was only about 20 kilometers.

“It’s really hard to imagine how glorious the blood flow sect would be in the past!”

The closer he was to the central area, the more buildings there were in the surroundings. Most of the buildings had already collapsed, but there were still buildings standing in the forest.

Wang Xian flew in the sky and looked down with some shock. He looked at the Heaven’s pride stage that appeared in front of him and was even more shocked.

The Heaven’s pride stage that was three to four hundred meters tall contained terrifying energy. The entire Heaven’s pride stage covered an area of at least five kilometers.

The powerful formation covered it. Even after thousands of years, it was still majestic and magnificent!

Wang Xian looked ahead and could vaguely see a building that was thousands of meters tall stretching for dozens of kilometers.

Half of it was in the forest and the other half was in the ocean. It was magnificent and legendary.

“If it was the blood stream sect at its peak, the buildings inside should be even more impressive than the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. The blood stream sect had thousands of insightful emptiness realm experts. What kind of concept was this?

“In order to cause unnecessary trouble, I should put on a mask to hide it!”

Wang Xian looked at the tens of thousands of young men in front of the Heaven’s pride stage. With a move of his palm, a mask appeared in his hand.

Following that, a black robe covered his entire body, making him look extremely cold.

The black mask covered his face, the black robe covered his body, and he held a black demon-free sword in his hand.

It had to be said that Wang Xian’s attire was very flirtatious and very cool.

He didn’t care about it. On the contrary, in order to hide his identity, he had to be more handsome.

Wang Xian smiled and landed on the ground. He slowly walked towards the heaven’s pride stage.

The Heaven’s pride stage was famous for young people under the age of 50. The current Wang Xian was only 26 years old.

“Every time a heaven’s pride level rises, one will receive a corresponding reward. It seems like I have to break through this heaven’s Pride Stage!”

He strolled over with a confident expression on his face. With a light step, he covered a distance of 100 meters.

This was a combined battle technique, river flow!

Combining the water and earth attributes to increase his speed.

“The changes in the prodigy roll over the past two days have been huge. Even the top five have undergone huge changes!”

“Ling Jian ‘ER is simply too strong. He even defeated Luo Shihua, who was ranked fourth, and reached the top fourth!”

“I feel that the most monstrous genius is still that Heaven’s pride expert called Ren Xingchen. It has only been a short while and he has already reached the third place. This is the third place. Who knows, he might be able to reach the top soon!”

“It’s a little difficult to reach the top. Senior Qian Ye’s strength is too terrifying. She defeated Long Xiaochen, who was ranked tenth in one move. Now that senior Qian ye is already forty-nine years old, Ren Xingchen will have to wait until Senior Qian Ye is fifty years old before he can reach the top!”! “Furthermore, there’s also Tang Feng, who is ranked second!”

“The Heaven’s Pride Roll’s Heaven’s sword star has fallen recently and Yin Xianfeng has fallen. I heard that he was killed by a young man. If that young man were to come, he might be able to occupy a spot!”

Wang Xian came to the front of the Heaven’s pride roll. When he heard the voices of the crowd, he raised his eyebrows slightly.

Ren Xingchen and Ling Jian ‘ER.

Wang Xian was more familiar with these two names.

“It seems that Ren Xingchen has already broken through to the half-step void interpretation realm. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to have such powerful strength!”

Wang Xian thought to himself.

If one wanted to be on the heaven’s pride roll, one must have the strength of a half-step void interpretation realm.

After all, this place was filled with the peerless prodigies of the hundred billion people in the Liuhai region.

As long as one entered this prodigy roll, as long as they didn’t lose anything, they would almost certainly be able to enter the profound void martial stage.

“Look, the rankings have changed again!”

Right at this moment, a cry of surprise sounded out.

Everyone looked towards the center of the Prodigy stage. There, there was a huge prodigy roll that was very eye-catching.

On the Heaven’s Pride Roll, the number one was Qian Ye, who was 49 years old.

The number two was Tang Feng, who was 47 years old.

The number three was Ren Xingchen, who was 33 years old.

The number four was Ling Jian ‘er, who was 30 years old.

The number five was Luo Shihua, who was 38 years old.

The Number Six was Tang Yuan, who was 36 years old.
