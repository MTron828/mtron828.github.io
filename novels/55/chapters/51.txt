“Wang Xian, where’s your hometown? This is still the first time I’ve known someone as powerful as you are in Rivertown.”

“Old Qin, you’re really humble. I’m not as powerful as you might think. It’s just some simple medical techniques. I was from Pengzhou. If there aren’t any accidents, I might very well stay in Rivertown for a long period.”

“Hehe. If your medical techniques were simple, there wouldn’t be any great techniques. Sacred Followers Guild and Disciples of the Medical Saint aren’t as great as their reputation would suggest.”

“Wang Xian is indeed great in this. For my son’s illness, I have consulted almost all the hospitals from the North to the South.”

“A doctor typically has a kind heart. The reason why Brother Wang Xian has such extraordinary medical techniques has very much to do with his young chivalrous heart.”

“You guys are praising me to the skies! I’m just 20 years old and couldn’t take all these compliments. Otherwise, I’ll get arrogant. Haha.”

Wang Xian was chatting with Old Qin and Old Xue in the living room. Xue Jiahua and Old Qin’s son had the intention to get on the good books of Wang Xian as they went along with the conversation.

As for Xue Jing, he had nothing to contribute at all nor did he dare to interrupt. All he did was to pour tea for others and laugh along.

For Old Qin and Old Xue, they were in an authoritative position with extraordinary backgrounds. They naturally had an “aura” around them. As for Wang Xian, he wasn’t uncomfortable while chatting easily with Old Xue and Old Qin. as he had the disposition of the Divine Dragon.

Xue Jiahua and the middle-aged man were a little surprised that Wang Xian was able to chat care freely with their fathers at such a young age. This was something that they couldn’t do themselves.

Among the younger generation in Rivertown, there was no one that could be compared with him.

“I heard from Xiao Jing that Wang Xian is now operating a restaurant. May I know where is it located so I can go and get some food when we are free? Hehe,” laughed Old Xue.

“I bought over an operating restaurant. It’s in the vicinity of the University of Rivertown. I believe Old Xue and Old Qin might have heard of it before. It’s called First-grade Restaurant.” Wang Xian replied.

“Oh? First-grade Restaurant? I would have never thought that Brother Wang Xian has bought over First-grade Restaurant. This restaurant is rather famous in Rivertown. In that case, we will pay you a visit when we have the time!” Old Qin remarked with a tinge of surprise.

“Sure, not a problem! You’ll be more than welcome. When you guys are coming, remember to give me a notice in advance so I can make some preparations for you.” Wang Xian laughed.

“Haha. Great! Great!” Old Xue and Old Qin nodded their heads. They were naturally happy that they were able to make friends with an extraordinary person like Wang Xian.

As for Wang Xian, he had a good impression of Old Xue and Old Qin. One could tell the qualities of another person by the way they spoke and behaved. Moreover, he had a joyous chat with them too.

“Oh right! Brother Wang Xian, I’ll be hosting a banquet tonight. At that time, there will be many elites of Rivertown. If you are free, do join us.” Old Qin invited him all of a sudden.

“I don’t really know anyone so I guess I’ll not be going.” Wang Xian was taken aback slightly and shook his head.

“It’s enough to just know these two old men right here. At that time, Old Xue would bring his family along too. Since Brother Wang Xian would like to grow in Rivertown, it would still be beneficial to get to know more people.” Old Qin smiled.

“Hmm. Alright.” Wang Xian hesitated for a while before nodding his head.

“Alright. Do you want to have lunch with us in the afternoon?” suggested Old Qin.

“This might not be possible,” Wang Xian replied apologetically. “I came over here to look around while I was waiting for a friend. It might not be possible in a while...”

As he spoke, his phone in his pocket suddenly rang.

“Haha, since Brother Wang Xian has things to attend to, just go ahead. We will be fine. Let’s go to your restaurant for a meal when I’ve arranged a time with Old Qin,” Old Xue smiled and said.

“Yeah, go ahead and attend to your matters.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian smiled and turned on his phone. It was a message from Guan Shuqing.

After reading the message, Wang Xian looked at them. “Old Qin, Old Xue. My friend has just sent me a message so I have to rush over. Sorry about that.”

“It’s fine. Just go. Let’s have a chat again when you are free.”

Wang Xian nodded his head and headed out.

“Big Brother, let me send you over. I’m familiar with the place. Where is your friend currently?” Xue Jing came over and asked him directly.

“Sea Cloud Pavilion 101 private lounge. It’s near the sea,” Wang Xian looked at Xue Jing and said.

“Alright! Big Brother, please follow me.” Xue Jing smiled and went ahead to lead the way.

Along the beach, there was a row of tree houses. It was neatly arranged and looked extremely beautiful.

“Big Brother, this is our Sea Cloud Pavilion 101 private lounge.” Xue Jing pointed to a small tree house.

“Alright.” Wang Xian nodded his head, took out his phone and gave Guan Shuqing a call.

Creak!

Soon, the door to the private lounge opened. Guan Shuqing, who was wearing a short-sleeve white shirt and black casual shorts walked out from the room.

“Wang Xian!”

Guan Shuqing’s expression didn’t seem fine. When she saw Wang Xian, she forced a faint smile on her face.

“What happened?” Wang Xian asked, concerned upon seeing her unusual self.

“Not... Nothing.” Guan Shuqing shook her head and said apologetically, “It might be tough on you in a while. It’s all my fault!”

Hmm? What happened? Wang Xian frowned.

“What’s the matter, Beauty Guan? Invite your boyfriend in!” At this moment, an impatient male voice sounded from the room.

Guan Shuqing’s expression changed slightly.

“Let’s go in.” Wang Xian lifted one of his eyebrows. He walked beside Guan Shuqing and patted her softly on her back.

Guan Shuqing felt a stream of warmth in her eyes. With shimmering eyes, she looked at him. After hesitating for just a moment, she extended her arms over and wrapped them over his arm.

Wang Xian’s heart skipped a beat and the edge of his mouth arched up. He walked into the room with a face of smiles with Guan Shuqing.

When he entered the room, Wang Xian saw four young men and three young girls sitting in the room.

When the man sitting by the entrance saw Guan Shuqing come in with Wang Xian with her arms around his, gloominess flashed in his eyes.

“Hello, everyone.” Wang Xian smiled at them.

The four young men in the room started scrutinizing him without reserve.

“Eh? Wang Xian?” Suddenly, one of the girls had a shocked expression and exclaimed out loud.

“Hmm? Mei’er, you know him?” the young man beside the girl asked in bewilderment.

“Of course, we are classmates!” The girl whose name was Mei’er clung onto the young man while revealing a deep cleavage to him. She then added, “Just a poor brat and student in the school.”

“Is it?” When the young man heard her reply, he was a little surprised.

“Of course.” Mei’er nodded her head. She turned to Wang Xian with a mocking smile and asked, “Isn’t it Wang Xian?”

Wang Xian smiled and shrugged his shoulders. Disdain flashed in his eyes as he remarked, “Su Mei’er is indeed true to the rumors spreading within the school.”

As he spoke, he sat down in one of the chairs by the side without fear.

“What do you mean by that?” Su Mei’er was triggered suddenly and stared at him with outrage.

“I mean nothing? What did I just say?” Wang Xian maintained his smile while replying.

Su Mei’er was known to be flirtatious in school and changed her boyfriend frequently. Moreover, her boyfriends were all guys from a rich family. Who would have expected her to cling onto a young man outside of school at this moment?

“Lad, you’re pretty arrogant to insult my girlfriend the moment you came in,” the young man in front of Su Mei’er said coldly.

“Did I? In that case, is her calling me a poor guy an insult?”

Wang Xian smiled.

“What I’ve said is the truth!” Su Mei’er exclaimed angrily at him.

“Did I tell a lie then?”

Wang Xian spoke plainly to Su Mei’er. He leaned back in the chair nonchalantly and looked at all the people around him.

When he saw Guan Shuqing’s embarrassed look previously, he knew that she must have been treated unfairly but didn’t dare to retort.

In that case, he had no intention or need to be respectful and polite to the people in the room.

Let’s just be arrogant then!
