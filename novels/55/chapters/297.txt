Chapter 298: Too Senior

“Xiao Xian!”

“Master!”

Beside the plane, Xiao Yu, Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue had just alighted from the plane when they saw Wang Xian and Sui Huang. They immediately called out to them.

“Xiao Xian, what happened to the plane?” the group of girls walked over and asked Wang Xian.

“Two Inborn experts had a quarrel and implicated the pilots in the process,” Wang Xian explained in a simplified manner.

“So that’s what happened! I thought someone hijacked the plane!” said Xiao Yu with a smile.

“Sui Huang!”

At this moment, the middle-aged man, who’d had a conflict with the other Inborn experts on the plane, rushed over and greeted Sui Huang with horror.

“I’ll investigate this matter clearly. You can go back and wait for my updates!” said Sui Huang plainly.

“Yes, Sui Huang!” the middle-aged man nodded his head respectfully before leaving.

“Master, why is everyone calling you by your name?” Guan Shuqing walked to her master and asked inquisitively.

“Hehe! There’s only one Sui Huang!” Sui Huang chuckled proudly. Although his name was Sui Huang, his title was also Sui Huang.

Most people would address him by the title!

“Alright, now that you are in your master’s territory, have a good rest and time here. Tell me if there’s anything you’d like. Haha!” Sui Huang smiled and led the group to the exit.

“Grandpa!”

When they left the airport, two old men immediately walked over and greeted Sui Huang deferentially.

“Yeah!” Sui Huang revealed a faint smile. He looked at the few black luxury cars ahead before turning to Wang Xian and asking, “Brother Wang Xian, are you guys going with me or...?”

Wang Xian pondered for a moment before answering Sui Huang.

“We would like to walk around the streets of Shang Jing first. We will go to your place in the afternoon tomorrow!”

“Alright.” Sui Huang nodded his head, turned to Guan Shuqing and said, “Disciple, if you encounter any problems in Shang Jing, just give me a call. Enjoy yourself!”

“Alright, master! Thank you, master!” Guan Shuqing smiled and nodded her head.

Hehe! Sui Huang responded with a smile. After which, he looked to the two old men by the side and instructed, “Leave a car behind for them. Let’s get back.”

“Yes, grandpa.”

The two old men nodded their heads immediately. After which, they looked to Guan Shuqing and said, “Martial Senior Aunt, feel free to instruct us if you have any needs in Shang Jing!”

Huh? Argh!

When Guan Shuqing heard how the two old men addressed her, she was instantly stunned.

The two old men were at least seventy years old. Although they had taken great care of their looks, one could still see signs of ageing. And now they were addressing her as Martial Senior Aunt.

This instantly shocked Guan Shuqing.

“Haha, my dear disciple. Based on seniority, these two kids should indeed address you as Martial Senior Aunt. It will be fine once you get used to it. I’ll give you a good introduction tomorrow,” Sui Huang laughed loudly and remarked after seeing Guan Shuqing’s reactions.

“Alright, master.” Guan Shuqing smiled bitterly and forced a smile at the two old men.

“Brother Wang Xian, we will leave that car for you. I’ll be getting back now for the preparations!” commented Sui Huang heartily.

“Alright, Old Sui! Go and handle your matters. I’ll walk around the streets with them!” Wang Xian smiled and nodded his head.

Hmm!

“Goodbye, Martial Senior Aunt!” the two old men said deferentially to Guan Shuqing once again.

“Mm, mm. Goodbye!” Guan Shuqing replied quickly.

As Sui Huang and the two old men left, Wang Xian was speechless. He turned to Guan Shuqing and asked, “Shuqing, how old is Sui Huang, that old fogey? His grandsons are already so old!”

“That’s my master! How can you call him an old fogey!”

Guan Shuqing rolled her eyes at Wang Xian before replying, “I’ve asked my master previously. He told me he has lived for more than two jia-zi.” [1]

“Oh my god! It’s no surprise then. He’s still so powerful after two jia-zi. He should be able to live for another few dozens of years.”

Wang Xian was shocked. One jia-zi was equivalent to sixty years. Two jia-zi would mean that Sui Huang was over 120 years old.

It’s no surprise that the two seventy-plus-year-old men were calling him grandpa.

“Incredible!” Wang Xian joked. If he could live for another few dozens of years, he would really be a living buddha. “It seems like there won’t be people with higher seniority than you in the Sui Family in the future!”

“I don’t want to have such high seniority. A couple seventy, eighty-plus old men just addressed me as their Martial Senior Aunt!”

Guan Shuqing looked devastated to be called Martial Senior Aunt by seventy, eighty-plus year old men. If that was the case, those of similar age as her would be calling her Great Martial Nanny!

At the thought of this, Guan Shuqing felt her world was spinning. Sometimes, having too high seniority would be extremely embarrassing!

“Hehe, Shuqing! I think that’s pretty cool. Just imagine a group of old men behind you and having to greet you with respect!” Lan Qingyue chuckled as she commented.

“Yeah, sister-in-law! I heard from my master that Families with deeper history typically have lots of rules. Considering your seniority, those middle-aged and younger generations might have to kneel down before you. Hahaha! It feels incredible just thinking about it!”

Xiao Yu was visualizing the scene in her mind as she laughed out loud.

“Forget it. That’s not what I want. If you guys like it, you can take my place!”

Guan Shuqing rolled her eyes at the two girls who were deriving joy from her misery.

“Haha. Let’s go. Let’s see where the interesting places in Shang Jing are. Hmm. For lunch, let’s go get the roasted duck!”

Wang Xian was laughing at the girl’s conversation but interrupted at this moment.

“Let’s go!”

Xiao Yu and the group walked towards the car excitedly.

It was an extended Bentley with six seats, a rather luxurious car. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

They weren’t surprised that a Sacred Clan could easily come out with cars like this.

Mo Qinglong drove the car and brought the group to famous places in Shang Jing.

Shang Jing was known for their roasted ducks. Therefore, they naturally would like to taste it since they were here. At noon, the group toured the Imperial Palace.

The group was still full of energy and enthusiasm at night despite having played the whole day.

All of them were Martial Artists. They wouldn’t be tired even if they had been touring the whole day.

“What would you like to have for dinner? Should we eat in the hotel or head out?”

The Bentley drove on the streets of Shang Jing. Wang Xian smiled and asked the few girls around him.

As he spoke, he started observing Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue from top to bottom.

Oh, Lan Qingyue, I haven’t gotten my hands on you. Today will be a good opportunity!

“We aren’t going back to the hotel yet! We have to go to the night market in Shang Jing. After visiting the night market, we still have to go to the famous Wang Fu Shopping Street! Haha! I’m going to go on a frenzy of a shopping spree!” Xiao Yu, Lan Qingyue, Guan Shuqing and Elder Fang were thrilled and spoke loudly.

“Erm. We have been shopping for the entire day. Aren’t you guys tired?” Wang Xian felt a little speechless at their responses.

“Fatigue is non-existent. We should be enjoying ourselves fully since we are in Shang Jing. Xiao Xian, don’t think of lazing around. We still need you to carry our bags!” Lan Qingyue and Guan Shuqing looked at Wang Xian and gave their orders directly.

Wang Xian was speechless. It seemed like he wouldn’t be getting his way again tonight.
