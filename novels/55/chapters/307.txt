Chapter 308: Getting Something With Nothing (2)

“Yes, master!”

“Guan Shuqing nodded her head. After which, she walked over and said, “Thank you, Martial Senior brothers, for your gifts.”

“Hehe, you are welcome. We will be one family in the future. If there’s anything we can help you with, feel free to let us know!”

Several ninety-plus-year-old elders replied with smiles.

Although they were old, they were in the pink of health. This might be because they were all Inborn experts.

“Junior Sister, this is a defective Flame Ball. It’s a shame that I can’t find a complete one. I have been using it for more than ten years and have little use for it now. I’d like to give this to Junior Sister as something you can use to protect yourself!”

“Junior Sister, this is the highest level elixir pill I can refine right now. It’s a Level 3 elixir pill and highly nourishing for a girl’s skin!”

“I don’t know what kind of weapons Junior Sister uses. Therefore, I’d like to give this jade dagger to Junior Sister!”

A few old men took out their gifts and handed them over to Guan Shuqing.

“Thank you. Thank you, Martial Senior brothers!” Guan Shuqing thanked them immediately.

“Hehe, you’re welcome. I heard Junior Sister reached Level 9 Martial Artist after just a month of cultivation. We are really embarrassed in comparison. You might just be able to reach the level of our father in the future!”

The five sons of Sui Huang exchanged pleasantries with Guan Shuqing. Clearly, they knew what the Junior Sister in front of them would become in the future.

“Thank you for all your gifts. I really like them!”

Guan Shuqing felt spoilt by the gifts she received. The gifts from them were truly valuable and she really fancied the gifts.

Wang Xian stayed by the side and smiled. The people of the Sui Family were generous and the gifts were all highly valuable. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“It’s been close to ten years since I have gathered everyone here. The oldest of the fifth generation children are already twenty-nine years old. Let me see the strength of these kids!” Sui Huang looked plainly at the last row of disciples and shouted.

“Yes, grandpa. Fifth generation of the Sui Family, step forward now! Show your strength to your Laozu.”

The current clan leader of the Sui Family stood up and shouted at the crowd of fifth generation disciples.

A group of young people and teenagers stood up immediately. Surprisingly, there were close to a hundred of them.

“Lift the cauldron!” shouted the clan leader.

The group of young people and teenagers nodded their heads and stepped forward to the large cauldron in the middle of the room.

Ha!

A young man shouted as he grabbed a large cauldron. Expending all his strength, he lifted the large cauldron up. His face was flushed as a result.

Ha! Ha! Ha!

One after another, the young people and teenagers grabbed cauldrons of various sizes and lifted them up.

Wang Xian noted that the weight of each cauldron was different. One could tell the strength of them by looking at the cauldron they lifted.

Level 5, Level 6, Level 7, Level 8, Level 9.

Wang Xian looked across inquisitively. Other than a young man who had managed to lift the Level 9 cauldron, the rest were all weaker than this level.

It’s pretty impressive for a twenty-five, twenty-six-year-old young man to lift a Level 9 cauldron. However, for a Saint-class force, that’s not really acceptable, Wang Xian thought to himself.

At this moment, Sui Huang, who was sitting in the middle, was clearly not very pleased.

As the surrounding people noticed the displeasure on Sui Huang’s face, they also started feeling a little fearful.

“The most outstanding disciple in this generation was Sui Ao and we spent lots of resources on him. He has even reached the Half-step to Inborn Realm. It’s a shame that he courted his own demise...”

Seeing the displeasure on Sui Huang, the other members of the Sui Family whispered softly among themselves.

“To be only at this level when they are in such a good environment and enjoying such great resources, it seems like this generation couldn’t match the previous ones at all!” Sui Huang gave his comments emotionlessly. Saying that this generation couldn’t match previous generations was harsh but factual.

“Grandpa, this is my failure. It’s all my fault!”

The current clan leader of Sui Family immediately went on his knees and asked Sui Huang for forgiveness. Cold sweat covered his face.

“Please calm down, father!” the group of old men immediately stood up and said.

“You guys must be getting more and more complacent and must have lost the drive from before. The most outstanding disciple actually gathered a group and behaved like a group of thugs against my disciple in the middle of the night! Who’s the one that gives them the right to be so imperious?” Sui Huang said plainly.

All the other members of the Sui Family felt their hearts skip a beat. The current generation of the Sui Family was disappointing him.

If their Laozu was angry, the whole Sui Family would be shivering in fear.

No one in the field even dared to breathe loudly, for fear of drawing the rage of their Laozu.

Sui Huang’s current aura. Hehe!

Wang Xian showed a mouth of teeth as he smiled. He looked at the group of a hundred people standing in the middle of the field. Suddenly, a thought struck him and he revealed a smile.

“Sui Huang, your Sui Family has gotten worse by the generation. When I visited the newly crowned Sacred Sect, Flame Palace, a while back, they had two outstanding disciples who are on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart. It appears that your family doesn’t even have one!” Wang Xian said with a mocking tone and his voice resounded in the field.

Everyone could hear him clearly.

The surrounding crowd was taken aback and looked at Wang Xian in shock. They were furious but embarrassed.

A young man said right in the face of their Laozu that the descendants of the Sui Family were all trash. This was equivalent to openly mocking and criticizing them.

It was especially so on this occasion!

When Sui Huang heard Wang Xian, his face turned gloomy instantly. He also knew that his descendants weren’t great at all. However, he didn’t need an external person to point it out so blankly.

“Please choose your words carefully, young man. Our Sacred Clan isn’t something that anyone can look down on!”

“Comparing us with Flame Palace who has been annihilated, you have gone overboard. Rascal! Apologize immediately!” Two old men from the third generation of the Sui Family looked solemnly at Wang Xian and demanded.

Saying this in the face of the entire Sui Family infuriated the members of Sui Family even though Wang Xian was sitting next to Sui Huang.

“Hehe. The mentality of you guys isn’t right. You should be ashamed instead of angry over what I’ve said. Perhaps you guys have lost yourself under the halo of the Sacred Clan!” Wang Xian sat on the elevated platform and spoke to them in a tone as though he was educating them.

Looking at how Wang Xian was behaving, all the other members of the Sui Family felt embarrassed. Sui Huang, who was beside Wang Xian, also pulled a long face.

“What rights do you have to criticize us? What kind of strength do you have?” a young man from the Sui Family stood up and shouted angrily.

“That’s right! What rights do you have?” Another young man stood up and questioned Wang Xian bitterly.

If it wasn’t for Wang Xian being close to their Laozu, the Inborn experts of the Sui Family might have struck and annihilated him.

“Just four people? That’s too few. Come! It’s not that I’m looking down on you guys. All the fourth and fifth generation disciples step forward. I’ll show you what qualifications I have to say that!”

Wang Xian’s lips curved into a smiled. Shaking one of his legs while sipping on tea, he looked down on all of them as he spoke. His behavior was like suggesting everyone here was just trash in his eyes.

His arrogant words and brazen expression immediately aroused the anger and fury of all members of the Sui Family!
