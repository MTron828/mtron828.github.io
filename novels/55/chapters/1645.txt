Chapter 1646: 1646 clan’s distinguished guests

Feng Yun was talking at the side while Wang Xian listened by the side. He frowned slightly.

When Feng Yun was with the empress, she had saved the life of the Sacred Fire clan’s patriarch as well as their clan’s life.

With such a good relationship, the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan was attacked by the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop. As long as the Sacred Fire clan stood up for the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan, the two forces would definitely not dare to kill them.

After all, the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan was once the Empress’personal guard, and the Sacred Fire clan’s patriarch was the founding general of the Phoenix Dynasty.

Due to the Phoenix Dynasty’s might, they would definitely not dare to kill the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan.

This way, the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan could also pin down the two forces.

However, when Feng Yun asked the Sacred Fire clan’s patriarch for help, the Sacred Fire clan’s patriarch didn’t refuse or agree.

On the contrary, he invited Feng Yun to return to the Phoenix dynasty. Once she returned, the Phoenix Dynasty would protect the fire cloud sparrow clan.

Now that the Empress had returned, how could Feng Yun join the Phoenix Dynasty.

In the future, the Phoenix dynasty would be their enemy. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

After rejecting, the patriarch of the Sacred Fire clan only sent experts from his clan to send her away.

As for this support, it was only to help them fight against some people who were tempted by the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop.

“In other words, the Holy Fire clan will make a move but will not do their best. Furthermore, this support might not last for long!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled as he said coldly.

“That’s right. They might retreat in half a year at most. Once they retreat, our fire cloud sparrow clan will be in danger!”

Feng Yun sighed slightly.

She never expected that the person she had saved many times would only act perfunctorily when their tribe was in danger.

“Not every tribe can be as loyal and righteous as your fire Lark Tribe!”

Wang Xian said softly.

The stronger the force, the more profit-oriented it was. It was rare to see a tribe like the fire lark tribe.

“The Empress is the benefactor of our fire lark race. Without her, we wouldn’t exist!”

Feng Yun said calmly.

“Where is the battlefield now? How many insightful emptiness realm experts are there in the fire lark race?”

Wang Xian asked directly.

“The battlefield is at the easternmost part of the fire cloud mountain range. The two factions that are attached to our fire lark race are fighting with our fire lark experts there!”

“Now that the Holy Fire Tribe has joined in, they have restrained themselves a lot. It is a small-scale battle where their strength is weak!”

“As for the insightful emptiness realm experts, there are more than 9,000 insightful emptiness realm experts in our fire cloud sparrow tribe!”

Feng Yun replied.

“Huh? Only around 9,000?”

Wang Xian was slightly taken aback as he asked in astonishment.

Feng Yun was slightly taken aback when she heard Wang Xian’s astonished words.

Only?

Were there less than 9,000 insightful emptiness realm experts?

One had to know that this was only the strength of the fire lark tribe.

If they didn’t count the fallen ones, there were more than 10,000 of them. If this was placed in the Chao Fa continent, it would definitely be a huge force.

This was once the personal guard regiment of an empire.

What was the concept of a personal guard regiment? It was the kind of regiment that was the strongest in the five empires.

The other higher-ups of the fire Lark clan in the room also pursed their lips and smiled bitterly.

This made them think of the power of this person in front of them.

According to the vague information sent by the empress, he and the Empress had defeated an army with more than 10,000 insightful emptiness realm experts together back then.

They could basically guess that this insightful emptiness realm expert should have around five to six thousand of them.

This word ‘Cai’was indeed well used.

Wang Xian saw their expressions and came to a sudden realization. All the insightful emptiness realm experts in the entire vast region added together only numbered around 20,000.

The fire Lark clan had more than 10,000 insightful emptiness realm experts, which was considered a relatively large number.

“Then, how is the opponent’s strength?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and asked.

“The combined strength of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop is only around 10,000 insightful emptiness realm experts. However, they have two longevity realm experts. Other than that, their financial resources are too terrifying!”

“Not long ago, they hired a masked assassin organization to assassinate several hundred of our profound void realm experts. In addition, they issued a mission at the Mercenary Association to kill a member of our Fire Cloud Sparrow clan. They were able to obtain five pills and five weapons of the same rank. This caused countless mercenary groups and experts to come and hunt us down.”

“Now, the members of the Sacred Fire clan have come. They said that they would deal with these mercenary groups and unspecialized experts. They completely treated this battle as a training for their disciples!”

Feng Yun said with some anger.

“Masked Assassin organization? What a strange name. Can you give me a copy of the information on this assassin organization?”

Wang Xian pondered for a moment and said to Feng Yun.

The reason why he came to help the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan was to kill the enemy.

Since he was here to kill the enemy, he would first get to know the enemy.

“Sure!”

Feng Yun, the fire cloud sparrow, and the other higher-ups were curious about Wang Xian’s question. However, they didn’t ask about it.

A graceful and elegant lady took out a set of information from her interspatial ring and handed it to Wang Xian.

“Can you change your appearance, physique, and even your aura?”

Wang Xian looked at the information regarding the masked assassin organization in his hand.

Unlike ordinary assassin organizations, the assassination techniques of the masked assassin organization could only be considered average.

However, their method of changing their appearance was hard to guard against.

When a person suddenly turned into someone you were familiar with, naturally, they would not be wary at all.

Under such circumstances, the other party would be able to kill you easily.

“The second largest assassin organization in the transcendence continent!”

Wang Xian was slightly surprised when he read the evaluation of the masked assassin organization.

“The masked assassin organization is different from ordinary assassins. Their unique method of changing their appearance, body shape, and aura is easier to train than other assassins. This has resulted in many assassins in the masked assassin organization!”

“Some people have guessed that the number of assassins in the masked assassin organization is in the hundreds of thousands. Hence, they are rated as the number two assassin organization on the Continent!”

The elegant lady explained to Wang Xian.

“Send me to the battlefield tomorrow. Also, show me all the information about the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop!”

Wang Xian said to them.

“Young master Wang, What’s Your Plan?”

Feng Yun stared at him with some doubt and asked.

“I have an assassin organization under me. I would like to try and see if they can withstand the assassination attempt by the Dragon Thorns!”

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly.

Ever since he came to the transcendence continent, he had started off by relying on the Dragon Thorns assassin organization.

From the start, the ones he valued the most and the ones he nurtured the most were the strange demon and the rest.

In the vast region, during the eight months he was resurrected, it was because of the existence of strange demon and the others that he was able to contend against the lone sect and the southern royal family.

However, Strange Demon’s strength at that time wasn’t very strong, and he didn’t carry out unbridled assassinations.

This time, he came to the central stage of the extraordinary continent. It was time for strange demon and the others to perform.

Dragon attack, can kill a piece of the sky!

He is looking forward to!
