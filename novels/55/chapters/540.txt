Chapter 541: A Real Man Faces A Strong Opponent Directly (6)

“Hai Jiao! We will finish you off for the Dragon King during this time!”

The great war between supreme experts on the Huashan summit had struck fear and awe into many people below. Those ancestral sect experts who had feuds with Dragon Sect were praying in consternation.

Yet, an icy bellow was heard at this time.

“What?”

Hai Jiao was slightly stunned, with a surprised and awful look.

All the surrounding experts in the Underworld were taken aback, too, as they spun around in astonishment. Upon seeing the disciples of Dragon Sect stepping forward, they all had a drastic change in expression.

“What is the Dragon Sect doing? Are they clearing away all their enemies?”

“The Dragon King and that middle-aged swordsman are battling with Sect Leader Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi of Diabolism in the sky. Don’t tell me the Dragon Sect is clearing their enemies below?”

“Hai Jiao is on their target board, and he’s considered finished. He can only blame his son for it. If the Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island hadn’t tried to kill the Dragon King, things would not have turned out this way. Death will be their ending!”

The surrounding crowd was discussing with horror when they saw Dragon Sect glowering at Hai Jiao.

Hai Jiao’s expression took a drastic change, replaced with a malevolent look. He stared daggers at all the people from Dragon Sect with frenetic killing intent darting out from his eyes. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Kill me? You guys want to kill me? I shall slaughter all of you here today, leaving nothing to remain for the Dragon Sect!”

Hai Jiao released murderous aura as the double horns behind him emerged in his hands.

Behind him, his subordinates were also staring coldly at Mo Qinglong and the rest.

“Now the Dragon King and the other supreme expert are engaged in fights. Yet, you guys are still thinking of killing us!”

The Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island also turned ferocious as if he was a completely different person.

Under the pressure of the two supreme experts, their mindset was somewhat twisted.

“Father, let’s kill them all. All of them from the Dragon Sect! After that, we’ll flee to the sea. I don’t believe the Dragon King can find us!”

The Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island growled with insanity in his eyes.

“That’s right. We’ll run and hide in the ocean. Not even a supreme expert could find us. Since the Dragon Sect is trying to exterminate me, I’ll retrieve some interest today!”

Hai Jiao strode forward with double horns clenched tightly in his hands. Behind him was the sound of tumbling waves.

All the surrounding people stared at the shocking move and gasped as they quickly give way to Hai Jiao and his gang.

“Hai Jiao and his son are crazy. They have gone mad!”

“Mad? How could he not go mad? Hai Jiao is a must-kill on the Dragon King’s list. When either the Dragon King or the middle-aged swordsman emerge as the winner, the Underworld will belong to the Dragon Sect. Hai Jiao will not have any place in Underworld. When that time comes, he’ll be doomed for sure!”

“He’s not going to die in silence. Hai Jiao is going to put up his last resistance and fight back.”

Seeing Hai Jiao and the Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island, all the people sighed.

He was the former second strongest in the Underworld who had enjoyed glorious moments, an unparalleled expert that no Sacred Sects would dare to mess with.

Now, he was forced to a point that almost drove him crazy.

“Hiak hiak, I’ll wipe the Dragon Sect out. I’ll see how the Dragon King is going to seek me out in the vast ocean.”

There was manic killing intent on his face. Before Mo Qinglong and his gang could look for him, he stalked toward them instead.

“Apart from the Dragon King, Dragon Sect seems to have no other Dan Realm experts!”

“These disciples of Dragon Sect are simply insolent. They don’t have any Dan Realm experts among them while Hai Jiao was considered to be the second strongest in the Underworld after all!”

“Seriously. Are the disciples of Dragon Sect going to get killed by Hai Jiao?”

The surrounding crowd was surprised as they watched how the event unfolded.

“Wuya, shall we strike too? Since Dragon Sect has no Dan Realm expert now, we can just eliminate them easily!”

Back at Donghua Sacred Sect, an old man clenched his fists tight with murderous intent in his eyes.

There was a constant mixed expression on Nie Wuya’s face. He craned his head up and watched the war in the sky before turning to Mo Qinglong and the gang again.

Suddenly, his eyes were fixed on the members of the golden swordfish clan who were holding razor-edged swords in their hands.

Seeing their indifferent, unwavering expressions, his eyes narrowed.

“No, no. Those people look similar to the swordsman named Roving Sword!”

Nie Wuya took a deep breath with eyes fixated on them.

“Hur?”

That old man was slightly taken aback as he looked over his shoulder and sized up the Dragon Sect’s members in bewilderment.

“Dragon Sect, I’ll wipe you guys out completely in the meantime!”

Hai Jiao repeated what Mo Qinglong had said to him in the exact words as the water current began to circulate frantically around his body.

A daunting aura erupted, causing all the Martial Artists to stagger back in horror.

Seeing Hai Jiao walking over with guts, trying to kill them off, Mo Qinglong was slightly surprised, but there was a hint of sarcasm in his eyes.

“Senior brothers, that Hai Jiao is a Dan Realm expert. Please help us out!”

Mo Qinglong quirked his lips slightly as he spoke to the few golden swordfish beside him.

“Leave it to us!”

A golden swordfish nodded coldly. When they witnessed Hai Jiao and his men striding over with malevolent expressions, no emotions were found in their eyes.

“Go to hell, everyone from Dragon Sect! Fu*k you all!” Hai Jiao growled ferociously as he strode.

The water energy was circulating madly around him. All the people within a few kilometers could hear the tumbling waves in the body of Hai Jiao.

Under such daunting pressure, Hai Jiao had exploded even stronger combat power than ever before.

“Hai Jiao’s strength is scary!”

“He’s too strong, way beyond any average Dan Realm expert. He’s indeed the former second strongest in the Underworld!”

“Oh no, the disciples of Dragon Sect were acting way too brazen just like their Dragon King. They thought Hai Jiao would be wary of the Dragon King, and dare not strike. But even a rabbit will bite if it panics!”

Sensing the domineering strength from Hai Jiao, the surrounding crowd was looking shocked in their eyes.

However, more people were staring at the golden swordfish gang with their longswords in their hands.

Simply because they looked like Roving Sword. Could it be...

“Slaying Spiritual Sword!”

“Return of the Spiritual Sword!”

Just when all the people had their own thoughts, two icy cold voices were heard.

Just like the cold voice of the compelling swordsman in the sky.

A spiritual sword that was a hundred meters long lurched forward with unparalleled sharp radiance.

Another spiritual sword of the same size with the same sharpness darted out from behind and returned.

Two frightful golden radiances rushed out from the front and the back! The Return of the Spiritual Sword!
