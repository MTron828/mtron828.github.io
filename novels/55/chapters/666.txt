Chapter 667: Arrogantly Superior And Disdainful

Translator: Larbrestudio

“For those who are approaching here! Come over, get on your knees and prepare to die!”

Just as Wang Xian led the group of dragonians towards Guta Mountain Range, a domineering command surprised him a little.

Get on my knees and prepare to die?

A flash of light flickered in Wang Xian’s eyes. He looked towards the mountain peak below the spiritual energy waterfall and squinted his eyes.

“Dragon King! Come here now and receive your death!”

An angry roar reverberated across from the middle-aged man with short hair who was staring at Wang Xian with blood-red eyes.

The enmity for killing his father had ensured that it was impossible for them both to live under the same sky.

People from the Nine Cauldron Worlds?

Looking at the outfit of the group of people standing at the peak of the mountain, Wang Xian felt a sense of familiarity. The image of a sect surfaced in his mind.

Medical Saint Sect!

When the experts from the Medical Saint Sect were annihilated, some of them claimed that there would be people going after me and taking revenge for them. What a surprise! Medical Saint Sect is actually related to the Nine Cauldron Worlds!

While Wang Xian was slightly surprised, a cold look appeared on his face the next instant.

No matter which world they were from, as long as they dared to go against him, he would play along with them to the very end.

Even if he was facing the Nine Cauldron Worlds, he wasn’t afraid at all as he had the Dragon Palace!

It wasn’t like his Dragon Sect did not have an Immortal Realm expert!

Wang Xian did not decelerate but instead landed on a mountain peak opposite the group. He smiled radiantly while observing the experts from one of the Nine Cauldron Worlds before him.

Elder Hua and the rest of the group scrutinized Wang Xian with chilling looks. They were a little shocked by the one standing before him.

He was too young! Outrageously young!

“Dragon King! You better get down on your knees to welcome the Excellencies from the Yao Cauldron world!”

“Haha! Dragon King, come over right now and get on your knees. Our Excellencies might just grant you a swift death!”

Elder Wan from Qingfeng Sect and the group of experts from the Song Family smirked as some of them chided Wang Xian.

They lifted their heads proudly, looked fearlessly at Wang Xian and were a little excited.

Hearing their snide remarks, ruthlessness gleamed in his eyes as he looked across the martial artists from the Underworld.

“Tsk! What are you looking at!? You are just someone who is going to die soon!”

When the group of martial artists from the Underworld met Wang Xian’s gaze, they ridiculed him coldly.

“Dragon King! Do you know your sins!?”

The middle-aged man with short hair roared at Wang Xian with a solemn expression.

Hehe!

Wang Xian chuckled nonchalantly as he looked across the group and asked, “Which cauldron world are you guys from?”

“Huh? It seems like you know about the Nine Cauldron Worlds too!”

Elder Hua stared at Wang Xian and continued, “What a shame for your talents! If you had not committed unforgivable sins, we would have taken you in as a disciple of our Immortal Sect. What a shame! You can’t blame others for the sins you have committed!”

“Dragon King! You killed my father and all the experts from our Medical Saint Sect! Today will be the day of your death!”

“If we had not escaped in time before, our entire branch of the Medical Saint Sect would have been slaughtered by you. Rest assured! When you die, I won’t let any of your kin get away. You won’t have to worry about being lonely in hell, as your kin won’t be able to escape!”

The middle-aged man with short hair growled while brimming with killing intent.

The arrogantly superior old man, the middle-aged man with short hair who had announced that he would kill all his kin, and a group of martial artists from the Underworld who was having fun while waiting for his impending miseries...

Wang Xian’s eyes gradually turned as cold as ice. “Do you guys know that you are courting your own demise!?”

“Dragon King! How dare you speak to the Excellencies from the Yao Cauldron world in such a manner! You must be too eager to meet your end! Today will be your last day alive! For your arrogance, death can be your only outcome!”

A young man shouted at Wang Xian with a face contorted from anger.

“Kill him as revenge for our clansmate!”

Seeing how Wang Xian was still daring to make brazen comments, Elder Hua wasn’t interested in talking further to a person who was going to die. He immediately instructed his people.

“Nine Budding Realm experts? Let’s hope that they will give us a good warm-up!”

At the back, the group of old men revealed faint smiles as they lifted the truncheons in their hands.

Fiery-red truncheons and jade-green truncheons glowed with blinding rays as though they were holy staffs!

“Die!” the group shouted.

On the peak where Wang Xian and the dragonians were, the trees were growing at a tremendous speed.

With over ten Budding Realm experts striking at the same time, powerful Wood attribute energy caused several thousand trees to grow to a few hundred meters instantly.

Their branches wrapped towards Wang Xian and the dragonians.

It was the same attack.

Wood Fire Burial!

“Wood Fire Burial!”

After that shout, a five to six-meter-long fireball appeared in the air and smashed towards the tree demons on the mountain peak.

Rumble!

This time, it wasn’t an attack from five Budding Realm experts. Instead, it was an attack launched by over ten Budding Realm experts at the same time.

Terrifying tree demons had locked down the entire mountain peak, blocking out any light. Branches moved towards Wang Xian and the group like a nest of snakes as the terrifying fireball landed on it and exploded!

Rumble!

The entire mountain peak was completely covered. Before the terrifying might, the entire peak was set ablaze before the eyes of the martial artists from the Underworld.

“Sss! They are dead?”

“I don’t think they would die from that. The Dragon King is really strong. I feel that the Dragon King wouldn’t die from just one attack!”

Some martial artists mumbled among themselves.

“All signs of life have dissipated!”

An old man, who was holding a jade-green truncheon, smiled faintly and remarked, “They are really trashy. When I heard about them, I still thought the Dragon King was reasonably strong. He couldn’t even withstand an attack from us!”

“Hehe! We have fifteen people attacking him at the same time. Moreover, the Wood Fire Burial is a frightening combination battle technique. Even if they had twice the number of people, they would very likely have been annihilated by us directly, let alone just nine Budding Realm experts!”

A middle-aged man with a fiery-red truncheon lifted his head proudly and spoke.

“Sss! Are they really dead?”

“Killing them in a single strike! I still thought it would take at least two to three strikes! Your Excellencies are truly too powerful!”

“Haha! The Dragon King is finally dead! That arrogant brat is finally dead! When I find his corpse, I’m going to whip it!”

“Under such terrifying attacks, his corpse has likely been reduced to ashes!”

The group of experts commented while deriving joy from the tragedy.

“I’m a little disappointed!”

Elder Hua shook his head lightly. He felt a little bored in seeing the Dragon King being killed so easily.

He had still been a little wary initially!

The real world was the real world after all. The real world couldn’t be compared to them at all as the rest were just ants!

Pa!

At this moment, the sound of water dripping could be heard.

“Be careful!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Suddenly, horrified screams from the martial artists of the Underworld resounded.

“People from the Underworld! Get your ego in check and don’t be haughty. It is especially so before me!”

A voice erupted from behind Elder Hua and the group.

Suddenly, everyone could feel a chill running down their spine!

Poof poof poof!

Soon after, chilling cracking of bones could be heard.

“How can this be? How did they appear here?”

Elder Hua’s eyes widened in disbelief as his hands, which held the truncheon, trembled. He looked with incredulity at his chest.

A longsword had pierced through where his heart was.

“I’m a little disappointed. You guys are from one of the Nine Cauldron Worlds? You guys couldn’t even survive a strike from me?”
