Chapter 422: Don’t Oppress Me Just Because I’m Young (3)

“YOU... You have crippled me!”

Feeling his Elixir Field being completely shattered, the skinny old man widened his eyes and glowered at Wang Xian. His round eyes were bloodshot and filled with hatred and anger.

Wang Xian looked mockingly at him with strong contempt as he remarked, “So what if I did? I’m leaving you alive for now. Go back and inform them we will be coming for them!”

Bam!

As Wang Xian completed his words, he pushed the skinny old man lightly. The skinny old man staggered and fell to the ground, his eyes still fixed on Wang Xian.

Not only had he lost an arm, but he was also crippled. For him, this was worse than death.

“Cough, cough! Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown, as long as you dare to step into Shang Jing, I’ll let you experience what is worse than death. I’ll make you beg me to grant you a quick death!”

The skinny old man was like a devil that wasn’t fearful of death as he glowered at Wang Xian and roared.

“Haha, just go! I would like to see how you are going to make me experience something worse than death! Go! Get lost! Tell your family and the one behind it that I’ll be coming for them with my disciple!” Wang Xian laughed loudly and walked towards the private-hire car nonchalantly.

“Master, aren’t we going to... Kill him? If we let him go, he will alarm the rest...” Xiao Ran walked over, gritted his teeth and spoke as he stared at the skinny old man on the floor with deep hatred.

“It will be fine. Just let him go back and inform the rest!”

Wang Xian’s eyes turned chilling. How dare they threaten him! He had initially prepared to bring Xiao Ran directly into the Xiao Clan to question them and demand an explanation.

However, he was not going to wait for them to give him an explanation anymore. He was going to get one out of them himself.

He took out his phone and smirked. The dragonians had now reached the Inborn Realm. Moreover, he was also preparing to establish the Dragon Sect as a Sacred Sect.

In that case, he would allow the dragonians to show themselves before the public eyes.

The first stop would be to face the Sacred Clan, Xiao Clan directly!

Strong desires to fight emanated from Wang Xian. He dialed Mo Qinglong’s number on his mobile phone.

“Young master!”

“Gather everyone in the Dragon Sect and come to the airport immediately. We will be going to Shang Jing!” said Wang Xian plainly.

“Yes, young master!” Mo Qinglong paused for a moment before nodding his head solemnly.

“Master, I’m sorry to have disappointed you just now!”

At this moment, Xiao Ran lowered his head and spoke apologetically.

“Your performance was still acceptable. Get yourself ready mentally!”

Wang Xian patted him on his shoulders and got into the rented car.

Sun Lingxiu and Liu Mengxin followed him and boarded the car.

“Brother, you are so incredible!” Liu Mengxin looked at Xiao Ran and complimented him with a blushing face.

“Master will be bringing us to take revenge today!”

Xiao Ran held onto his sister’s hand. His heart was filled with agitation and anticipation currently.

“Driver, please continue!”

Wang Xian patted the body of the driver, injected a stream of Azure Dragon energy and woke him up.

“Huh? What happened to me?”

The driver lifted his head, still feeling a little confused as he stared at Wang Xian.

“I don’t know. You lost consciousness suddenly and I have been trying to wake you up for a long time. Are you alright?” Wang Xian asked heartily.

“Hmm! What’s happening?”

The driver patted his head and felt that his body was in better condition than before. He shook his head and said, “I’m fine and feeling pretty good. Let me send you guys to the airport now!”

The driver smiled and turned towards the large car parked horizontally before him. He continued his complaints. “Damn it! The driver is really inconsiderate to leave the car behind. Eh? There’s a guy lying there? Is there an accident?”

“it’s fine. That’s just a beggar. We went down to take a look previously,” Wang Xian smiled and answered plainly.

The group of people who had fought with Xiao Ran had been reduced to dust.

There weren’t any trails left behind.

Therefore, the driver didn’t suspect anything as he continued driving his car towards the airport.

“Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown! I’ll definitely let you have an experience worse than death. Just you wait!”

Behind the car, the skinny old man who was on the floor grumbled as he struggled to get up.

His eyes were bloodshot and looked wretched like a man-eating devil.

The only thing that was supporting his will to live was to kill Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown and stabbing him with a thousand knives.

“Young master, everyone in the Dragon Sect is here!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

When Wang Xian arrived at the airport thirty minutes later, Mo Qinglong and Mo Yuan walked up to him. Behind them, forty-eight dragonians wore identical black attire with an image of a devil dragon. This attracted curious eyes from the surrounding crowd at the airport.

“Hmm! Go and get the tickets!”

Wang Xian looked across the crowd of dragonians and revealed a satisfied expression.

“Yes, young master!”

Soon, the plane took off for Shang Jing.

At the same time, a private helicopter was moving towards Shang Jing.

On the helicopter, a wretched-looking old man lay. He had closed his bloodshot eyes and was contacting Aunt Mei and the decision-makers of the Liang Family, telling them to wait for him at Shang Jing.

He didn’t tell them the details yet.

The plane flew expeditiously towards Shang Jing and so did the helicopter.

As the helicopter had taken off first, it landed on a private airport while the plane was just halfway through the journey.

This was an exceptionally huge manor. The manor was beside a lake and was incomparably beautiful.

At this moment, a wealthy lady and an old man stood up immediately upon seeing the helicopter land.

To their astonishment, they saw the skinny old man staggering out of it with a missing arm. They immediately went forward to help him.

“Uncle Gu!”

“Old Gu, what happened to you?”

The wealthy woman and old man hurried over and were shocked to see the state of the skinny old man.

“I got crippled! Completely crippled! The fat old man was killed!”

The skinny old man was hideous. He looked at the wealthy woman and old man as he said, “We encountered some troubles. That little brat has reached the Inborn Realm. Moreover, his master is Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown. I was crippled by Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown. They are now on their way here to Shang Jing and will be heading to Xiao Clan!”

“What? What did you say?”

Just as the skinny old man completed his sentence, the wealthy woman’s eyes popped wide open as she stared in disbelief at the skinny old man.

The old man beside her was also shocked. His body was shivering as he attempted to verify, “Old Gu, are you sure about this?”

“How can this be fake? Otherwise, I wouldn’t have been crippled!” The skinny old man grimaced and continued, “It’s Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown! It’s all because of him that the little brat has grown to become so powerful. We definitely have to stab a thousand knives into him before killing him!”

“Uncle Gu! You are saying that little mutt has reached the Inborn Realm? How can this be possible? It can’t be!”

The wealthy lady shook her head in disbelief. It was clear that she was flustered.

Inborn Realm! That little mutt had reached the Inborn Realm and was even stronger than her son!

She couldn’t believe it. That little mutt was just fifteen years old!
