Chapter 353: Boundless Seas, The Choice Of Location For The Dragon Palace (1)

“I haven’t disappointed you, have I?”

As the last of the screams dissipated, the Inferno Divine Dragon circled in the air before it leaped in front of Wang Xian, reverting to its form as a Dragon Ball.

Wang Xian stretched his hands to receive the ball before raising his head to face Bian Yaoquan who was standing atop a dilapidated house.

Eyes wide, the current Bian Yaoquan was shivering as he looked below in disbelief.

On his face, drops of perspiration trickled down his forehead, not caused by heat but rather from a chilling fear.

“How can this be? This can’t be. It’s impossible!”

He could not believe the sight before him. To think six Inborn experts were finished off in the blink of an eye.

That was one destructive Inferno Divine Dragon, along with the formidable Spiritual Flame Ball.

“That’s the Dragon Ball for you. How is it?” Wang Xian asked with a faint smile. “I wonder if you’ve prepared yourself for death, before laying an ambush to kill me?” he continued.

“You ... You can’t kill me ... You can’t kill me,” Bian Yaoquan stuttered as he retreated involuntarily, eyes filled with fear.

He had considered endless possibilities, but the current scenario before him was one which he had not expected at all.

To think a Spiritual Flame Ball would be able to wipe out six Inborn Experts.

Prior to this, they expected that six Inborn Experts would more than suffice in getting rid of the trio.

Yet... But...

“You would be better off dead!” Wang Xian cut off Bian Yaoquan, unwilling to waste more time on him. As he spoke, he fired the Dragon Ball to attack Bian Yaoquan.

“No ... My Father’s the Sect Leader of Medical Saint Sect. If you kill me, my father will never let you off ...,” Bian Yaoquan shrieked in terror as he saw the Dragon Ball flying in his direction.

“If the Medical Saint Sect should dare come after me, I’ll annihilate them!” Wang Xian rebuked with an expressionless face.

Bam!

Bian Yaoquan retreated in fright. Yet, in a flash, the Dragon Ball punctured through his body.

“This... You... For my sake, my father will...,” Bian Yaoquan muttered. Eyes wide, he looked at the little hole in his chest, which gradually opened up before it started to burn.

Bian Yaoquan looked on as his eyes filled with a mix of indignation, remorse, and hatred.

“Courting doom!” Wang Xian cut him off indifferently. He looked backward, and saw Sun Lingxiu attending to Miracle Doctor Blood Man and treating his wounds.

The Miracle Doctor Blood Man was in huge trouble, given that Wang Xian had been unable to fend for him when the blast occurred.

Marred with severe injuries, he managed to survive all thanks to his formidable combat abilities.

“A Level 9 weapon’s pretty good stuff!” Wang Xian let out a faint smile when he spotted the weapon on the ground. With one leap, he hopped over to the weapon.

“Eh?” Wang Xian uttered while he picked up the Sky Splitting Blade.

As he assessed the body, Wang Xian spotted an elixir bottle made of porcelain around Bian Yaoquan’s waist belt. He proceeded over and retrieved the bottle for a look.

“Level 4 Elixir Pill, To think that there are four Level 4 Elixir Pills here!” he cheered in excitement when he opened the porcelain bottle.

“It’s a Soul Enhancement Pill, which is one Level higher than a Soul Breaking Pill. By consuming one, a Half-step Inborn can raise the possibility of elevating themselves to the Inborn status by twenty percent!” Wang Xian exclaimed with a tinge of passion in his eyes. The value of one Soul Enhancement Pill was the same as a stalk of Level 5 Spiritual Grass, which would fetch between seven hundred to a thousand Spiritual Stones.

Which was to say, the Soul Enhancement Pills over here were worth close to four thousand Spiritual Stones.

“Given the Elixir Pills I have, together with these four Soul Enhancement Pills, I’ll have enough Spiritual Stones for the construction of the Dragon Palace once they are sold!” Wang Xian cheered excitedly. Aside from Spiritual Stones, Wang Xian was also running short on some gold and silver; though not by huge margins.

Besides, they could be bought with money.

And while he was currently broke, Wang Xian could first advance payment from Lan Qingyue’s end or even borrow for the time being.

Moreover, he still had more Spiritual Grasses on the floating island.

“Spiritual Stones are the most important when it comes to constructing the Dragon Palace, which will be completed faster when there are enough Spiritual Stones. And as for now, they’re sufficient!” Wang Xian grinned. With a swing of his arm, he cremated the body.

“These four Soul Enhancement Pills should be meant as payment for the four Inborn Experts. Seems like I’ve gained favor then!” Wang Xian chuckled before he came to check on the remaining bodies.

As Inborn Experts, there were bound to be treasures on them, which could easily fetch hundreds of millions when sold.

After a search, some venom and more than a hundred Spiritual Stones were found.

“Is everything alright?” Wang Xian asked as he returned to check on Miracle Doctor Blood Man, who had gone pale.

“It’ll take more than half a month to recover. Dammit, they almost squeezed my blood dry!” Miracle Doctor Blood Man cursed weakly, while all color had gone from his face.

“It’s good that you’re alright,” Wang Xian nodded. To which, he turned to face Sun Lingxiu. “Let’s go!” he gestured to her.

“Sure!” Sun Lingxiu nodded back, and together the trio made their way to the airport on foot.

Along the way, Wang Xian made several calls. He asked Lan Qingyue, Old Qin and Old Xue to assist him in gathering the final materials needed to construct the Dragon Palace.

Ordinary materials such as steel were a piece of cake for them.

It was already afternoon by the time they arrived back at the villa by air, while Xiao Yu and the others were attending classes.

Miracle Doctor Blood Man headed right back to the other villa to nurse his injuries.

Whereas Wang Xian turned to Sun Lingxiu and said, “Come, let me take you to a place!”

“Oh? Where are we going?” Sun Lingxiu asked in surprise.

“Follow me, and you’ll see!” Wang Xian beamed, in a great mood. They arrived by the seaside before they sped over in the direction of the floating island.

“The island upfront is a floating island. It’ll be considered as our marine base in times to come!” Wang Xian introduced. Thereafter, he hopped onto the island with a leap.

As Sun Lingxiu followed behind, she surveyed the entire island with wide eyes. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“The floating island...to think it’s the legendary floating island. Goodness, Xiao Xian. To think you actually managed to obtain a floating island!” Sun Lingxiu cried out in astonishment.

“I’m planning to start building the Dragon Palace within the next couple of days!” Wang Xian said coolly.

“What? Build a Dragon Palace?” Sun Lingxiu was shocked.

As one with the bloodline of the Divine Dragon, it was only natural that Sun Lingxiu knew about the Dragon Palace and its significance.

It symbolized the real standing of a Divine Dragon Race.

“That’s right!” Wang Xian admitted without the slightest concealment, given there was no need for him to hide anything from Sun Lingxiu.

“I plan to construct a stately Dragon Palace amidst this boundless sea!!” Wang Xian shared with passion in his eyes.

“I’ll always be by your side, Xiao Xian!” Sun Lingxiu exclaimed. Looking upon a high-spirited and lofty Wang Xian, she let out a faint smile, as if vowing in her heart never to leave till death do they part.

“It won’t be long before I, Wang Xian, conquer the seas and this entire galaxy!” Wang Xian asserted while overwhelmed with fighting spirit.

And thus began the conquest of the oceans.

Soon, the Divine Dragon would officially set foot into this boundless sea!
