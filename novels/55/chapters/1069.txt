Chapter 1070: 1071 was the absolute commander

“Charge left and right. Don’t let the water wolves charge into our formation. Meet the enemy at the front!”

“Deputy leader Meng, Don’t attack. The strong enemy hiding in the dark has yet to appear. Eagle Eye, hover ten meters above the ground and scan the surroundings!”

Wang Xian stopped attacking after he forced out the water wolves twice. He scanned the surroundings and commanded expressionlessly.

“Teams 1 to 5, charge forward!”

“Teams 6 to 8, left, and the rest on the right. Kill them all!”

After Wang Xian’s voice rang out again, deputy captain Meng roared furiously.

The battle had already begun. He was the deputy captain of the Ocean Corps, yet he didn’t have the reaction speed of a single student.

In fact, the one who gave the order was that student. This made them feel a little humiliated.

“Yes, Charge!”

“Boom!”

In an instant, the strength of the riding wind battle team was completely unleashed.

The riding wind battle team was the only army in the East Sea City. Even in star-moon kingdom, they were very powerful.

Although there were more than a hundred thousand water wolves in the surroundings, most of them were below level five of the extraordinaire. There were very few of them who were at level six or seven.

Wang Xian saw that there were only about a dozen of them who were at level seven of the extraordinaire. There were only two or three of them who were at level eight of the extraordinaire.

He did not make a move. The five thousand soldiers of the ocean cultivators army could totally withstand the current situation.

“This... how did he discover the surrounding water wolves in advance? He could even release the order so quickly!”

The students from the three academies who entered the inner circle looked at Wang Xian with a shocked expression.

Wasn’t he the leader of the Demon Hunters Academy? wasn’t he the young man who caused the demon hunters academy to suffer heavy losses on the way to Shenghai Town?

How could he detect the ambush in the surroundings so quickly and react so quickly?

This... didn’t make sense!

“I didn’t even notice it just now. How did he do it?”

Hawk-eye, who was standing at a height of ten meters, swept his gaze across Wang Xian. His eyes sparkled with a peculiar light.

When he thought of the water wolves who were hiding in the surroundings with the water-sky uniform ability, it was obvious that the water wolves knew that they would enter this place within 30 seconds.

In that case, what he said about the beasts monitoring them in the sky was also true. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He actually possessed a more powerful insight than himself!

For a moment, everyone looked at Wang Xian with a look of shock on their faces.

His powerful insight and commanding ability were a little abnormal.

Wang Xian stood there and scanned his surroundings. He raised his head and looked at the sky. The grey-winged goshawk was still hovering in the sky and looking down.

“Looks like this demonic beast is not simple. There might be more than one powerful demonic beast!”

To be able to control the grey-winged goshawk and make a group of water wolves hide in the surroundings, the demonic beast behind him was definitely not that simple.

He scanned his surroundings and searched slowly.

Those demonic beasts must be hiding in the surroundings, preparing for a fatal blow or preparing to escape.

“I found one!”

When Wang Xian’s gaze landed in front of him, his gaze was fixed on a huge rock. Behind the huge rock, a two-meter-tall, blood-red demonic beast was lurking there.

Its appearance could not be detected by humans. It had two legs and two arms, but it had a head that was like a mosquito.

Its entire body was blood red, especially its arms. There were actually many teeth on its arms, making it look extremely ferocious.

Compared to demonic beasts, this creature should be called a demon.

“Judging from its energy, it should be at transcendent level nine!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. He looked at deputy leader Meng and said, “Deputy Leader, there is a demonic beast hiding behind that huge beast. It is not weak!”

With a body size similar to that of an order, deputy leader Meng looked at Wang Xian before looking at the huge rock immediately.

“Crafty Demonic Beast. I’ll go and kill him!”

Deputy Leader Meng didn’t have the slightest doubt. With a move of his body, he dashed towards the huge rock at a terrifying speed.

With the insight and commanding ability that Wang Xian had displayed just now, deputy leader Meng felt that he was inferior to him.

Boom

The long spear in deputy leader Meng’s hand pointed at the ground. A terrifying crack extended towards the huge rock.

The huge rock exploded, revealing a demonic beast that was blood red in color.

“Blood Barbarian!”

When deputy leader Meng saw the look of shock on the Demonic Beast’s face, his eyes were filled with intense killing intent. “It’s actually you bunch of blood barbarian demonic beasts. Die!”

Buzz

Deputy leader Meng’s figure flashed and disappeared from the ground in a strange manner. Then, he emerged from the ground beside the blood barbarian demonic beast.

His powerful supernatural power was just like an earthling.

“Damn humans, I want to suck all your blood!”

The blood barbarian stared at deputy leader Meng with a ferocious look. His body was blood red as he attacked him directly.

“There are also blood barbarian demonic beasts. There must be more than one of them!”

Wang Xian didn’t pay attention to deputy leader Meng’s battle. He looked at the grey-winged goshawk that was still circling in the sky. He raised his eyebrows slightly and his body immediately floated in the air. His Dragon Eyes of light and dark fire scanned his surroundings.

“Eh? Seven of them. All of them are at transcendent level nine. They are luring deputy leader Meng over and then hunting him down!”

Wang Xian was astonished. This blood barbarian demonic beast was deliberately hiding behind the huge rock. Even if he didn’t say anything, this blood barbarian demonic beast would have been discovered on purpose.

“Vice leader Meng, be careful. There are seven transcendent level nine blood barbarian demonic beasts hiding in the ocean ahead. They should be preparing to ambush you!”

Wang Xian had a thought and immediately sent a voice transmission to him.

Deputy leader Meng raised his eyebrows. There was a look of surprise in his eyes. He replied immediately, “Thank you, Little Brother!”

Wang Xian did not reply. He looked around and said, “There is a level 7 supernatural water wolf hiding on the left. A Level 7 supernatural expert will deal with it!”

“Students at the back, form a small team and bring the injured soldiers into the central circle to avoid casualties!”

“Ao Jian, support that position. There are three transcendent level 7 water wolves there!”

“An entrance has been torn open at that position. Send more than ten transcendent level 5 students to block that place!”

Orders were issued one after another. At the beginning, the soldiers hesitated for a moment, but they immediately carried out the orders.

Just now, even their vice regiment commander was obeying this young man’s orders.

Now that their vice-captain was under the command of that young man and was going to kill that demonic beast directly, how could they not obey his orders?

Although this young man was not their superior and as a soldier, they should not listen to other people’s orders, but he was too awesome!

Furthermore, the orders he gave were the most accurate ones.

“Quick, send over a dozen extraordinary level five students!”

The students of the Demon Hunters Academy immediately obeyed Wang Xian’s order and rushed towards the opening that was broken by the water wolves.

At the side, the students of the East Ocean Academy and the Ocean Academy pursed their lips as they looked at Wang Xian, who was standing in the air and giving out orders. Their eyes were filled with shock and admiration.

Hai Wen, who was standing below, looked at Wang Xian with an extremely embarrassed expression.

Was this a nobody that he said he was?

Was this the guy who caused great losses to the Demon Hunters Academy?
