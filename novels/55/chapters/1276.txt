Chapter 1277: 1278 ran away with its tail between its legs

Translator: 5496903

A panicked voice came out from the Demon Soul’s mouth.

At this moment, everyone felt as though there was something wrong with their ears. They stared blankly at the scene in the arena.

However, what shocked everyone even more was...

When Wang Xian’s attack was unleashed...

The Heaven’s Pride King Beast, a powerful demon beast at the second level of the Seethrough Void Tier, the Demon Soul King of the Demon Beast clan. Without the slightest hesitation, it actually turned its head and fled towards the outside.

His actions left everyone dumbfounded.

Regardless of whether it was the demonic beast clan or the human clan, their eyes were wide open and their faces were filled with disbelief.

“Bastard, I let you escape last time. Do you think you can escape this time?”

Wang Xian’s mocking voice rang out. However, when it landed in the Demon Soul’s ears, it was like a life-threatening talisman.

The incident at the trial grounds was still fresh in its mind. It had always held a grudge in its heart and was extremely furious.

This was because a powerhouse at the first level of the Seethrough realm from the bloodshed empire had arrived at the trial grounds. This made it believe that the person who had been chasing after it all this while was the one who had almost killed it.

The person who had almost killed it and caused it to lose its most valuable treasure would be a powerhouse from the older generation of the human race.

It even swore in its heart that it would definitely seek revenge when it became stronger.

When it saw the figure of Wang Xian earlier, it was slightly stunned.

It was a familiar figure, but it didn’t dare to confirm it.

However, the moment Wang Xian took out his weapon, it was already 100% certain.

This human heaven’s favorite was the one who chased after it for more than 20 minutes at the training ground and nearly killed it.

Furthermore, after it escaped with its life, it rejoiced in its heart. If that human powerhouse had wanted to kill it forcefully from the start, it might have already been killed.

Especially that terrifying attack at the end, which made its heart palpitate.

However, it had never thought that that human expert was actually a human prodigy.

A human prodigy!

Since when did humans have such a terrifying prodigy!

It was the most powerful monster of the monster race in the past thousand years.

In the previous Battle of the Prodigy Bridge, humans were completely defeated.

Now that the strongest monster of the past thousand years had appeared, wouldn’t it be easy to kill the humans?

It had never thought that such a terrifying figure would appear among the humans.

“It’s you, I didn’t expect it to be you. Don’t even think about killing me, don’t even think about it!”

The Demon Soul Roared in fear. Looking at the attacks that covered it, it instantly unleashed all of its strength.

All of its divine abilities were directed towards the water tomb and Earth burial.

It wanted to escape as soon as possible. Once it was entangled, it would be finished.

At this moment, it was only 3,000 meters away from the stage.

As for who it said was a coward and who was an ant if they escaped, it had completely forgotten about it.

It would not admit to the pretentious act just now.

Right now, escaping was more important!

“Boom!”

However, at this moment, everyone in the surroundings, as well as all the demonic beasts, finally reacted.

“Grasping grass, grasping grass, grasping grass... What the hell is going on? That incomparably arrogant genius King Beast Just Now, a demonic beast that looked down on the world, how could it just run away? My God, what the hell is going on?”

“This... Oh My God, this king Beast has obviously fought with the nameless sword demon before, and the last time, it was almost killed by the nameless sword demon. It’s too shocking, too shocking!”

“How strong is the nameless sword demon exactly? This is a demon beast at the second level of the profound void tier, yet it actually ran away when it saw him. Look at that King Beast, it’s obvious that it’s very afraid of the Nameless Sword Demon!”

“Motherf * cker, who would have thought, who would have thought that the overwhelming prodigy beast would actually run away upon seeing the nameless sword demon. Haha, this is Too Awesome!”

Around the arena, all the humans had shocked expressions on their faces as they watched this scene. All of them roared out in excitement.

Just a moment ago, they had said that even if the three of them joined forces, they might not be a match for the overwhelming prodigy beast. However, right now, the moment the nameless sword demon charged over, that invincible overwhelming prodigy beast was so frightened that it ran away.

It almost ran away with its tail between its legs!

This scene shook everyone’s hearts.

While everyone was shocked by the strength of the nameless sword demon, they were also extremely happy.

This was their human’s overwhelming prodigy, the invincible overwhelming prodigy!

“How is this possible? How is this possible? Even the top-tier overwhelming prodigies in the vast region might not be a match for this demon soul. Why?”

Shopkeeper Qian’s face was filled with disbelief when he saw this scene!

How could such a heaven-defying Heaven’s favorite exist in such a small flowing sea region?

This...

“Haha, our Flowing Sea Region also has powerful heaven’s favorites. How delightful! This nameless sword demon is truly a dragon among men!”

On the side, Long Xiaotian shouted loudly when he saw shopkeeper Qian’s incredulous expression.

This caused manager Qian’s expression to slowly become ugly.

What he said just now was completely slapping his own face.

“Roar Roar, what’s going on? What’s going on? Why is the Demon Soul King so afraid of that human? What’s going on?”

“Demon Soul King, kill them! Why are they escaping? Kill them!”

On the Demon Beast side, all the demon beasts roared in disbelief.

This time, they were really dumbfounded.

At this moment, their demon soul king was like a timid mouse that had seen its natural enemy. He fled frantically in an attempt to escape from the arena.

“Fire Territory!”

Wang Xian looked at the demon soul that was trying to escape. A hint of coldness appeared on his face as he waved his arm.

The fire territory was instantly activated.

A terrifying mountain peak of a thousand meters in size appeared out of thin air and smashed towards the Demon Soul’s escape route.

He didn’t want to kill it. Instead, he wanted to seal its path.

“Damn it! Damn it!”

The Demon Soul, who had witnessed Wang Xian’s terrifying attack, trembled slightly when it saw the terrifying mountain on its path of escape.

“Aspect, wings of the demon Qilin!”

It opened its huge mouth and unleashed its aspect without any hesitation. It charged towards the fire territory.

It was really afraid. It could not be trapped here.

Even if it was just for a second, it would be a second more dangerous for it.

The Demon Soul immediately cast its dharma idol. Its decisiveness caused Ling Jian ‘er and Ren Xingchen, who were following behind, to be stunned.

They were following behind Wang Xian, afraid that he was no match for him alone.

However, now that Wang Xian was chasing after it, the Demon Soul was trying its best to escape.

In order to escape from the arena, he actually used his dharma idol.

This... It seemed like he was trying his best to escape even before the battle started? Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Was this really a good idea?

In the surroundings, all the humans and demon beasts were stunned when they saw the demon soul using his dharma idol to collide with the divine ability of the nameless sword demon in order to escape.

What happened to the Invincible Heaven’s favorite King Beast?

Where was the unrivaled and terrifying Demon Soul King?

How could he be so cowardly now?

He ran for his life the moment they met. This...

Was this really the battle between the supreme prodigies of the Prodigy Bridge?

Black question marks appeared in everyone’s minds!

Stupefied!

Stupefied fruit on the stupefied tree!

You and me under the stupefied tree!
