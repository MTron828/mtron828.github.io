2586 The Wrath of the 2586 Sky Mountain Sword sect

The room in Beichuan Square quieted down. Wang Xian and the rest were sitting there quietly!

At the side, the lady was sitting there with a blank look in her eyes. Her palms were moving slightly. On top of it, Frost laws were dancing!

Wang Xian looked at her control ability and was slightly amazed. With her current strong control ability, it was definitely not something that could be cultivated overnight!

Her foundation was already strong enough, but she could not cross this threshold!

Time passed slowly!

“Miss, the elixirs are here!”

Two hours later, a waiter walked in and whispered to the lady!

“Oh, okay!”

The lady came back to her senses and immediately took the interspatial rings!

“Sorry!”

She said to Wang Xian, “How many Abyss Seeds do you have?”

“All of them!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he took out all of the abyss seeds!

“I didn’t expect that the seniors had killed so many abyss seeds. This time, our north stream market can exchange them with the seniors at a discount of 95% for the medicinal pills!”

As the woman spoke, she counted and immediately handed over the interspatial rings!

Wang Xian took them over and checked them one by one. A satisfied expression appeared on his face!

“Alright, it’s a pleasure to work with you. I’ll come back to your place next time!”

A smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face as he stood up immediately!

“Senior, I’ll send you off!”

The woman stood up immediately and said to Wang Xian with a smile!

“No Need!”

Wang Xian shook his head. However, the woman still sent them all the way to the outside!

“I hope we can work together again next time!”

When she sent them to the door, the short-haired lady smiled at them again!

Wang Xian looked at her with a hint of hesitation on his face. Then, he smiled!

He slowly extended his palm. Water Energy condensed into frost. However, the strength of the frost that he condensed was not something that the lady’s origin frost could compare to!

The short-haired woman was slightly stunned as she looked at Wang Xian in astonishment!

“Even a small snowflake can cause an avalanche. In an avalanche, not a single snowflake is innocent!”

“Bang!”

Wang Xian spoke slowly to the short-haired woman. As soon as he finished his sentence, the snowflake in his hand exploded instantly. A void crack appeared in front of his palm!

In the void crack, a solid ice flower was suspended there!

“Comprehend it yourself!”

Wang Xian waved his hand. The ice flower flew towards the short-haired lady and landed on her clothes!

When the short-haired lady saw this scene, a ray of Hope suddenly shot out from her eyes. Her body trembled slightly!

“Senior!”

Her arm trembled as she held the ice flower in her hand. She shouted at Wang Xian’s figure!

Wang Xian ignored her and continued to fly forward!

“Senior, I... I want to acknowledge you as my master!”

The short-haired woman’s expression changed drastically when she saw Wang Xian’s flying speed. She quickly flew into the air and knelt there as she shouted loudly!

However, her speed was still too slow. The figure in front of her had already disappeared!

“Eh? Isn’t that the heaven’s favored daughter of the Bei Chuan Sect? The existence that suppressed the son of the great sect back then?”

“What’s wrong with her? Is she taking him as her Master?”

Some people in the surroundings looked over with astonished expressions!

Even some staff members of the Bei Chuan Workshop looked at their young lady in astonishment!

“Senior... he knows the cultivation method behind the road of Frost. I...”

Looking at the disappearing figure of Wang Xian, the short-haired lady knelt there with an excited expression on her face!

The door had already been pried open by the senior. The path of the godly king was now completely open to her. She could improve quickly!

That was until she met another door!

“Thank you, senior. For your guidance, I will be your teacher for Life!”

She kowtowed heavily towards the spot where Wang Xian’s apparition had disappeared!

Sensing the short-haired lady behind her, a smile appeared on her face!

“If she can join the Dragon Palace, it might be possible for the Dragon Palace to have an additional Frost Divine Dragon!”

Wang Xian touched his chin and muttered to himself!

...

However, to be honest, having an additional frost divine dragon was nothing to the Dragon Palace!

He had no interest in taking in a disciple. His only disciple, Xiao ran, was still in the boundless galaxy. He should have the strength of a level one or level two eternal lord by now!

Speaking of which, having the strength of level one or level two eternal god Lord at around the age of 30 was an extremely heaven-defying existence!

However, it was still too slow for Wang Xian!

He could either take out a large amount of resources to nurture him, but it was meaningless for him to do so. There was no path for him to follow behind him!

Therefore, Wang Xian did not want to take in a disciple, even if the short-haired girl had a very strong physique!

“With these pills, I can increase the combat strength of five to six wild dragon species and thorned dragon species to level seven immortal King!”

Wang Xian muttered to himself as a smile appeared on his face!

The Dragon Palace would have another five to six people, and the level seven immortal King would have around ten people. He would then hunt down some more abyss species in the Abyss!

If he could increase the number of members in the Dragon Palace by a few more, the end of the five great factions in the ninth-grade heaven sect would also come!

He thought to himself as he quickly flew towards the entrance of the Abyss!

...

When Wang Xian returned, he was at the entrance of the Abyss. The experts from the Sky Mountain Sword sect were standing at the side with unpleasant expressions!

A Day ago, they were preparing to chase after the Dragon King, but they didn’t see a single person!

Facing the immortal godly king flying at full speed, they couldn’t catch up at all!

Furthermore, they didn’t know where the Dragon King was going, hence they had no choice but to wait here!

However, they didn’t know how long they would have to wait here!

However, their Lord Sword Emperor had already given the order, they could only stand and wait!

“HM? Elder, the Dragon King and his group are here!”

Over 10 hours later, a Sky Mountain Sword sect Disciple’s eyes gleamed, he suddenly roared softly!

“Are they here?”

The rest of them looked over immediately and revealed a smile on their faces!

“Let’s go. Let’s act accordingly!”

As the elder of the Sky Mountain Sword sect spoke, he immediately walked towards Wang Xian and the rest! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Eh?”

When Wang Xian was about to reach the entrance of the abyss, he suddenly saw a group of people walking towards them!

Looking at the clothes on their bodies and the sharp swords in their hands, his eyebrows twitched slightly!

“Dragon King, Please Stop!”

The group of experts from the Sky Mountain Sword sect stopped about 100 kilometers away from Wang Xian and the rest. They shouted at Wang Xian and the rest!

When Wang Xian heard the words of the elder from the Sky Mountain Sword sect, he raised his eyebrows slightly!

“Dragon King, we don’t know how you have the courage to kill the people from our Sky Mountain Sword sect. But now, you’d better give us a perfect explanation. Otherwise, it won’t be long before your Dragon Palace is destroyed!”

The elder of the Sky Mountain Sword sect stared at Wang Xian coldly and growled in a low voice!

“Huh?”

Wang Xian frowned slightly when he heard his words!

He was discovered?

How did they discover it? !

Just as Wang Xian was frowning, everyone from the Sky Mountain Sword sect was staring at him!

The Sky Mountain Sword sect could not be sure either. They were just testing it out. If the Dragon King had explained everything, it was not what the Dragon King and the rest were talking about!

But looking at the Dragon King’s expression, they had a glimmer of an answer in their hearts!
