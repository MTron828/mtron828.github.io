Chapter 928: 0929, he was the leader of the Dragon Thorns! Let’s go

Translator: 549690339

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across everyone around him.

There were about 60 to 70 members of the knife mark mercenary group, plus a group of martial artists who wanted to curry favor with the knife mark mercenary group and join them.

There were about 100 people in total. Each of them had a proud look on their faces as they stared at them with contempt.

It was as though they wanted to kill a fish on a sticky board!

“Are you guys here to kill me?”

Wang Xian’s cold gaze swept across all of them as he asked coldly.

“Haha, don’t Be So Serious. We Are Here to kill you, not to kill you!”

A middle-aged man from the sword scar mercenary group laughed out loud as he said mockingly.

There was a huge difference between the word ‘kill’and ‘Slaughter’.

‘slaughter’was a term used to describe a lamb waiting to be slaughtered.

The Immortal Phoenix mercenary group was very powerful and destroyed the mirage sea mercenary group.

The young leader was extremely talented and powerful!

But in the eyes of the knife scar mercenary group, he was just a lamb waiting to be slaughtered.

Kill if you want to!

“That’s right, I advise you to pull your necks out and commit suicide so that we won’t hurt you later!”

“Haha, that’s right. If the knife scar mercenary group wants to kill you, you have to die. I think you should commit suicide!”

“Going against the Dao Hen mercenary group is simply courting death!”

Behind them, a group of powerhouses who had come down to curry favor with the Dao hen mercenary group pointed at Wang Xian and said mockingly.

Their tone was filled with contempt.

From their point of view, it shouldn’t be too easy for Dao Hen to destroy the immortal Phoenix!

“All of you have to get involved too!”

Wang Xian glanced at the people behind him coldly and asked with a twinkle in his eyes.

“Join in? Haha!”

A burly middle-aged man laughed out loud. Following that, he moved his body and blocked the path leading to the city wall.

“Hehe, leader Dao Hen, i, Lao Han, have extraordinary level four cultivation base. I’m going to sign up to join the Dao Hen mercenary group. I’ll help you to prevent them from escaping. Although I don’t Need Lao Han, I still have to support you!”

The burly middle-aged man said with a fawning expression.

When the surrounding people heard the burly middle-aged man’s words, they secretly cursed him for being cunning. Why didn’t they think of that.

“Leader Dao Hen, we’ll help you surround them!”

“That’s right. As long as leader Dao Hen gives the order, we’ll take action immediately!”

The strong ones who were not weak immediately surrounded Wang Xian and the rest as they spoke with smiles on their faces.

Dao Hen looked at this scene with great satisfaction. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly. “You’ve mobilized so many people. Kid, do you want to commit suicide or do you want me to make a move?”

Wang Xian swept his cold gaze across everyone who surrounded them. In the end, his gaze met Dao Hen’s eyes.

“It’s over. Everyone in the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group has been surrounded. It’s going to be difficult for them to escape now!”

“Today, the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group will definitely be destroyed. A short-lived genius!”

More than 100,000 people on the city wall watched this scene and spoke slowly.

“Haha, they really treat us as ants. How interesting. All of you will die today!”

A terrifying killing intent shot out from Wang Xian’s eyes. He stared at Dao hen coldly and said, “You brought this on yourself. You Can’t Live!”

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

Just as Wang Xian finished his sentence, lights started to flash within a radius of two to three thousand meters.

The surroundings seemed to have become strange. A black light barrier suddenly enveloped the surroundings.

A faint white light was emitted from their surroundings.

Light Shadow Barrier: Level 8 extraordinary formation

Function: set up a barrier to trap the enemy and protect yourself.

Array Formation activated!

Light shadow barrier was a transcendent item obtained by the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group after they advanced to silver rank.

Transcendent rank 8 array formation. Creatures within transcendent rank 8 could forget about breaking this array formation.

Only experts above transcendent rank 8 could destroy this array formation.

The light shadow barrier directly enveloped everyone within the array formation.

The sudden appearance of this scene caused everyone to be slightly stunned. Their faces revealed a stunned expression.

Even Dao hen frowned as he looked at the surrounding formations in astonishment.

“An extraordinary level eight formation!”

A hint of seriousness flashed across Dao Hen’s eyes. An extraordinary level eight formation. With his strength, he couldn’t break it.

“What? An extraordinary level eight formation?”

“This... what is he trying to do?”

The expressions of the surrounding experts and the members of Dao Hen’s mercenary group changed slightly as they stared at Wang Xian in astonishment.

“Level eight formation. You trapped us here. Are you trying to kill us? You’re simply courting death!”

Blade scar scanned his surroundings coldly. He didn’t find any danger and sneered.

“Hehe, I was afraid that you guys would run away, so I trapped all of you here. Then...”

“Kill!”

“Huh?”

However, when Wang Xian finished his sentence, the surrounding people stared at him in astonishment.

How could this kid be so calm and confident?

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

It was at this moment that Ao Yao and the rest who had been hiding in the surroundings made their move.

In an instant, the people who were surrounding them suddenly widened their eyes and slowly lowered their heads to look at the position of their chests.

“There’s no need to hide!”

Wang Xian said indifferently to the group of strange demons around him.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

Ao Yao gave a gentle push, and twenty corpses fell to the ground.

“What?”

In an instant, everyone in the formation had a drastic change in expression. They let out a series of exclamations. Even Dao hen’s expression changed drastically as he looked at the group of strange monsters with a solemn expression.

The group of strange monsters slowly walked to Wang Xian’s side. Ao Yao came to his right.

Half of his body was black and the other half was white. It looked extremely strange.

The rest of the strange demons were emitting a white light. They didn’t look like an assassin at all. However, everyone saw it in an instant.

Terrifying!

Strange!

Sinister!

Wang Xian ignored their shock. He moved his palm slowly and pieces of red paper appeared in his hand.

The paper floated towards the sword scar mercenary group and the group of martial artists.

Everyone’s expression changed slightly as they stared at the red paper vigilantly.

“This is?”

An incredulous voice came from the mouth of a middle-aged man. He stared at the red paper with his eyes wide open.

“Congratulations on your death from the Dragon Assassin Organization!”

“Congratulations on your death. How is this possible!”

At this moment, there were sounds of shock from the surroundings.

A piece of paper that looked festive was now an item that terrified everyone in Shenghai town.

Congratulations to the death of the Dragon Assassin organization!

This was a death notice, a death name tag!

A sense of horror and fear enveloped their hearts!

They raised their heads with an embarrassed expression and stared at Wang Xian and the group of strange demons.

“The Dragon Assassin organization? Kid, who are you?”

Dao Hen stared at Wang Xian with an embarrassed expression. His eyes flickered as he growled.

“Who am I? Hehe, don’t you know who I am if you want to kill me?” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Wang Xian took two steps forward slowly. He raised his head slightly and a hint of coldness appeared on his face.

“I am the leader of the Celestial Phoenix Mercenary Group!”

“I am the leader of the Dragon Assassin Organization!”
