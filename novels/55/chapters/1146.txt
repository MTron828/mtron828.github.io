Chapter 1147: 1148 dragon Spike vs undercurrent

Translator: 5496903

The Sky was dark, and the sun had yet to break.

The city guards on the city wall looked towards the abyss-like wilderness. The sound of the waves could be heard clearly on the city wall.

The group of mercenary group members talked about what happened in Bright Moon City as they walked out.

They talked about undercurrent, dragon spike, and the two assassin organizations.

“The undercurrent assassin organization is too powerful. I heard that the master of undercurrent is even more mysterious?”

“He should be an expert at the profound void realm. For such an existence to want to assassinate someone at the transcendent realm, he could easily crush him to death!”

An old man sighed slightly as he talked about the undercurrent assassination yesterday.

He could be considered to have witnessed the rise and struggle of undercurrent. The reputation of undercurrent made one’s heart palpitate.

“Fortunately, the price of hiring undercurrent is too high. Otherwise, Bright Moon city would be even more chaotic than now!”

A middle-aged man smiled and looked forward.

“Huh?”

However, when he raised his head and looked into the distance, he was slightly stunned.

“Eh? What is that? Look, what is that on the city wall?”

The middle-aged man stretched out his finger and said to his companions beside him in surprise.

“What? There... There seem to be two people?”

“There are two people hanging on the city wall. Hiss, is that a real person or a fake person? What’s going on?”

The group of people raised their heads and revealed a surprised expression on their faces. All of them widened their eyes.

“Let’s go and take a look!”

The old man in the middle said in surprise and quickly walked forward.

The closer they got, the clearer the scene on the city wall became. When they walked forward, their bodies trembled.

“There really are two people nailed to the city wall. What’s going on? Didn’t the city guards on the city wall see it?”

The old man revealed a shocked expression.

This was Bright Moon City, the second largest city in star-moon kingdom. How could there be two corpses hanging on the city wall.

This was a provocation to bright moon city!

“The guards on the city walls clearly don’t know the situation here!”

A middle-aged man said in a deep voice as he looked at the city guards standing on the city walls.

“Brother guards on the city walls, something has happened. Look over here!”

He shouted loudly at the city guards on the city walls.

“What? What Happened?”

The city guards on the city wall heard their words, turned around and asked impatiently.

“Two corpses, there are two corpses hanging on the city wall!”

A young man hurriedly shouted.

“What corpses? How can there be corpses hanging on the city wall? We’ve been here all night.”

A middle-aged guard walked towards the city and said.

“In Bright Moon City, our city guards are here...”

As he spoke, he lowered his head. However, before he could finish his sentence, his eyes widened.

“Cough cough, someone come quickly, someone come quickly!”

He shouted loudly and his body moved. He directly jumped down and floated in mid-air.

“What’s Wrong?”

The other group of soldiers on the city wall looked over in surprise and directly flew over.

The middle-aged man flew to the front of the city wall and looked at the two corpses hanging on it. His pupils could not help but shrink.

When did two corpses appear? Why didn’t they see them?

“This is?”

However, when he wanted to reach out and move the two corpses down, a shocked expression appeared on his face.

On their chests, there were two red pieces of paper.

And on the left and right side of the corpses, there were two names.

The son of the Master of Undercurrent: Shadow Sky

The ACE assassin of Undercurrent: darkness

These two names caused his body to tremble.

The Master of Undercurrent!

The ACE assassin of undercurrent!

He was very clear what these two represented.

They were the underground king that covered the entire star-moon kingdom, the king of Assassins.

An existence that everyone feared.

However, these two people had left behind such words beside them!

“What’s going on?”

He widened his eyes and exclaimed in disbelief.

“What’s going on?”

“This is? I know this piece of paper. It seems to be the symbol of the dragon assassin organization!”

“No Way, this can’t be true, right? This young man and middle-aged man are the son of the master of undercurrent and the Ace assassin of undercurrent. How is this possible! ?”

Incredulous voices rang out one after another, and the city guards who had rushed over looked on in disbelief.

“What? That’s the son of the Master of Undercurrent? The Ace assassin of Undercurrent?”

“The dragon assassin organization did this, this... this...”

However, the group of mercenary group members who had come to the bottom of the city wall were stunned. They looked at each other in disbelief.

Just now, they had been discussing about the undercurrent assassin organization and the Dragon Assassin organization.

In their opinion, dragon spike could not be compared to the old organization that had dominated star-moon kingdom for decades.

In addition, the undercurrent had assassinated an extraordinary level 9 expert yesterday. This made them feel that the undercurrent was extremely powerful.

However, now, the son of the undercurrent master and the Ace assassin of the undercurrent were hanging on the city wall.

How the hell was this possible?

That was undercurrent, the dragon spike actually... Actually killed the son of the master of undercurrent and their ace assassin...

For a moment, they felt their scalps go numb.

What was the dragon spike doing?

Was he going to make an enemy of the undercurrent assassin organization?

“Report to His Excellency immediately, quickly!”

“This matter is not something we can interfere with!”

Beside the two corpses, the city guards looked at them in shock. This matter was no longer something that they could resolve.

If this was really the son of the master of undercurrent, he was really the Ace assassin of undercurrent!

Then this was a confrontation between two terrorist assassin organizations!

Facing such a level of confrontation, even their city lord would probably find it very troublesome.

The assassins who walked in the dark corners were the most feared.

At the position of the city wall, the city guards’faces were filled with shock, and the mercenaries were also incomparably terrified.

However, at this moment, in other parts of Bright Moon City.

The Sun had gradually risen, and many people had already woken up.

Some people from the large clans and large mercenary groups also woke up.

Very quickly, the people from the clans and mercenary groups discovered the contact information of the Dragon Assassin group that was placed in their hall.

“Dragon Assassin Group, I’ve heard of this before, but you don’t need to look for an assassin. The undercurrent is very powerful!”

“I don’t know how much the price of this dragon assassin group is, but I didn’t expect them to actually compete with the undercurrent for business. Hehe, this is going to be interesting!”

“This is the dragon spike trying to occupy our bright moon city. Interesting, but it’s possible that they don’t have the strength to do so!”

When some family members saw the contact information of the dragon Spike assassin organization, they shook their heads carelessly.

How could the dragon spike be as powerful as undercurrent? Undercurrent had assassinated a transcendent level 9 powerhouse yesterday, and they had decades of foundation and reputation. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

If they wanted to find an assassin, the first thing they would think of was naturally the undercurrent assassin organization. They would not choose the dragon assassin organization.

Who knew how strong this assassin organization was? How Good was their reputation?

However, just as they did not take it to heart, a piece of news shook the entire Bright Moon City!
