Chapter 3118: 3117’s information that shocked the Milky Way

“Dragon King!”

Soon, the sky array flew over and looked at the turtle blazed wings beast that was being suppressed.

“I’ll subdue it first. Take this crescent moon Illumination Numinous Treasure First and capture some peak-stage godly monarch-level desolate beasts.”

Wang Xian instructed the sky array.

It would take at least a month to tame a universe knight-level first-stage desolate beast. During this period, he could let the sky array capture some peak-stage godly monarch-level desolate beasts first. This would save a lot of time.

With the crescent moon shining on this numinous treasure, capturing the desolate beasts was a piece of cake.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The Heaven Array nodded.

Next, Wang Xian began to tame the venerable level turtle-winged beast. The Heaven Array went to capture some desolate beasts at the peak of the divine emperor realm in the water to prepare for the following matters.

“Damn it, what exactly happened to the Dragon’s face? The life token broke and there’s no trace of it!”

Just as Wang Xian was taming the blazing turtle winged beast, the entire hall was filled with a depressing atmosphere.

Five old men sat in the middle. Below them, more than twenty old men were kneeling with cold sweat on their faces.

Something Big had happened!

The Venerable Dragon Mask had fallen!

The death of a venerable was a huge matter for the dragon race.

“The strength of the dragon face is considered top-notch among the level one venerables. He even has the Thunder Dragon Bone on him. It will be difficult to kill him unless a level two universe venerable makes a move.”

“That Wang Xian is a level two universe venerable? That’s impossible. Do you think it was venerable willow deity who made the move?”

“It shouldn’t be. Venerable Willow deity is a neutral venerable. She has her own principles. Even if she makes a move, she wouldn’t kill us, the Dragon Face Venerable.”

The five of them sat there, their expressions extremely solemn as they spoke.

This was the first universe knight that had fallen in the hundreds of millions of years of their dragon race.

Other than the fallen dragon face, there was also the Thunder Dragon Bone of the Knight level.

This was equivalent to them losing two knights.

How many knights were there in the entire Dragon Race?

This kind of loss was already extremely painful.

“There’s another possibility. That guy who tipped us off was lying to us. They had already set up an ambush and killed the dragon-faced man.”

An old man said faintly.

“Investigate, we must investigate thoroughly. Find the enemy and use the power of the entire dragon-descendant race.”

The dragon-descendant leader in the middle said in a deep voice.

“Yes!”

The group of people kneeling in front immediately responded.

They had to investigate the death of the dragon-faced venerable.

They also understood that this was definitely related to Wang Xian.

…

“With the strength of the disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect, it’s impossible for them to destroy the elders of our nine swords tribe.”

“Investigate, find out who entered the Crescent Mystic Realm again. Find out who killed them and avenge the elders!”

Just as the dragon-descendant race was furious and searching for information about the death of dragon-faced knight, the Universe Knight level great being of the nine-blade race also gave an order with a face full of anger.

The death of eight elders was a huge loss to the nine-blade race.

They had to find out who did it, and make them pay the price.

As the days went by, the entire Milky Way seemed to be in a state of turmoil.

Some other forces noticed the abnormality of the dragon race and the nine-sword race and revealed astonished expressions.

The two primary races of the Milky Way universe used all their strength to search for some information at a terrifying speed.

However, when their race was in operation, information was quickly transmitted to their race.

The first piece of news was about Wang Xian breaking through to the level of a universe knight.

All the disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect knew about this, so they were the quickest to investigate.

When they received this news, the nine swords race had basically determined the murderer of their Race’s elder.

As for the dragon-descendant race, they could basically confirm that the death of the dragon-faced venerable was probably the work of that Wang Xian.

Following that, the two great races activated all their powers to search for information about Wang Xian.

However, it was not so easy this time.

Senior Brother Junzi and the rest stayed in seclusion in the willow deity Daoist sect.

Wang Xian was now powerful and possessed the eight luminaries dragon scale. They could not lock onto him at all.

This made the two great races like headless flies.

“Phew!”

At the same time, a month passed very quickly. Wang Xian took a deep breath and looked at the turtle-winged beast that was completely tamed. A smile appeared on his face.

Taming the turtle-winged beast in a month was already very fast.

“Buzz!”

After contacting the Heaven Formation, he quickly received a reply.

“Have you captured six peak celestial emperor level aquatic dire beasts in a month’s time?”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and revealed a satisfied expression.

He immediately informed Mi Xin Lu and posted the information of the Celestial Palace’s war pets selling six peak celestial emperor level war pets on the AI.

When Mi Xin Lu received the order, she immediately posted the information on the AI.

Soon, a piece of information regarding the Celestial Palace’s war pets was sent out from the universe’s AI.

The Immortal Palace’s War Pets would be sold with six peak god-emperor level war pets and a large number of other war pets.

This time, the method of selling the war pets was not the same as before. Instead, they would be bought on the spot.

They would be sold by drawing lots.

The reason why they would be sold in this way was that Wang Xian wanted to gather all the forces in the Milky Way and announce something.

He wanted to prepare for the following matters.

When the information about the Immortal Palace War Pets was released, it immediately caused a huge commotion.

Peak-stage Celestial Emperor War Pets, and they were also peak-stage Celestial Emperor War Pets. Furthermore, there were six of them.

“Hiss, this immortal palace war pets are so awesome. This time, they actually sold six peak-stage Celestial Emperor War Pets. This is too crazy!”

“What kind of force are these immortal palace war pets from? They are definitely a powerful primary race in the universe.”

“There must be a universe knight behind this Immortal Palace War Pet. A few pinnacle god Emperor War Pets are sold, this is too fierce!”

“This is probably another grand gathering, it will definitely be fought over by all the major powers!”

In the Milky Way, countless people looked at this news, their faces full of shock and discussion.

When the various races saw this news, they immediately got ready.

Even among the primary races in the universe, a battle pet at the peak of the divine emperor realm was considered to have the highest combat strength.

Not to mention its importance to the domain-level races.

Looking at the information that was bubbling up in the universe’s AI, Wang Xian revealed a smile.

Little did they know that this was just the appetizer.

The next highlight was the auction of the Immortal Palace’s Battle Pets.

“I need to change to another ship. I can’t be as shabby as before. Also, I Need the Heaven Formation to show its strength this time around to create a powerful and mysterious feeling.”

Wang Xian mumbled to himself as he made a plan in his heart.
