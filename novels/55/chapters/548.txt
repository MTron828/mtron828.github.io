Chapter 549: Genius? Demon? (3)

“Water morphology analysis!”

“Water transformation!”

“Swordsmanship, the Technique of the World!”

Da Hong Immortal Sect’s swordsmanship secret manual summarized the forms, transformations of the water, and the swordsmanship!

Just like Wang Xian had guessed, there were three states, which included solid, liquid, and gaseous states. But in addition to these three states, there was another state: boiling state.

Water could turn into ice, but it could also raise its temperature.

There was another method for refining equipment and elixirs known as the Water Refining Technique.

Apart from the flame, water was the only attribute that could refine elixirs and equipment.

Things would develop in the opposite direction when they become extreme.

The swordsmanship in the Underworld is known as Art or Stroke. But the swordsmanship of Da Hong Immortal Sect is known as Technique, or Method, Battle Techniques!

Techniques and Strokes are different. In the novels, the art of drawing the swords is simply impressive. With a sword radiance, the enemy dies instantly. However, it is clearly a childish move before Techniques.

Just like drawing the sword, you need to stay close to your enemies and strike them by surprise. But the Sword Techniques could directly kill you, even at a distance of a thousand meters or farther away from you.

Think about it. No matter how impressive you draw your swords, it’s not as great as killing enemies at a few hundred meters away!

This was already beyond the average Underworld’s combat but was elevated to the battling of techniques.

Da Hong Immortal Sect’s Sword Technique is divided into four realms which are namely Small Mastery, Great Mastery, Pinnacle, and Attainment. The Inborn disciples who can achieve Great Mastery are top-notch talents; Dan Realm experts who achieve Pinnacle are considered to be impressive; Budding Realm experts can advance to Attainment. These Budding Realm experts could be ranked at the top.

Sword Techniques have myriad variations, and attack means which one cannot imagine. Small Mastery Sword Techniques will need to master the gaseous state; Great Mastery will master the liquid state, and Pinnacle will be solid-state. Attainment will master the boiling state. When the four states of water combine into one, there’s a chance of reaching Sword Intent and advancing to become an Immortal.

Wang Xian read the introduction in the secret manual with eyes full of excitement.

Night came without a sound. The moon and the stars over here were no different from the outside.

The room that Wang Xian was staying in was not an isolated room; the hall was just beside it, while Yu Ling’er stayed upstairs.

Wang Xian walked out of his room. His body had not fully recovered from previous injuries. As such, he could at most explode Dan Realm strength in any battles.

He took the secret manual to the yard and spotted a longsword on the table.

He swung his arm.

Clang!

“The sword is not bad, but it’s not an Inborn Spiritual Weapon!”

Wang Xian drew the sword, and phantom images appeared in front of him when he swung his arm.

The use of the water states was mainly to confuse the opponent such that countless moves could be played in one strike.

Illusory sword represented a Small Mastery of Sword Techniques.

Illusory sword could cause damage, but it was much weaker as compared to a real longsword.

In addition, the use of water vapor could control the longsword. That is, to the point of flying on it.

However, this would require a strong control of it.

Wang Xian waved his arm and suspended the sword in the air. With a swing, the sword lunged forward.

Flying on the sword involved a lot of aspects of controlling the water vapor, such as speed, strength, angle... All of these required long-term practice.

Wang Xian moved and stepped on the sword. Using mind control, the sword traveled ahead.

The speed was not fast. The best method to increase the speed would be at its liquid form, using water clouds to hover with the sword in the air.

“Illusory sword!”

Wang Xian leaped off the sword and made a thrust with the sword in his hands. Instantly, countless Illusory sword images appeared around him.

“Sword Rain!”

Wang Xian coalesced the dense Illusory swords into razor-edge water blades that were suspended in the surroundings as though it was Million Swords Into One. [1]

“Hundred Tiers Blade!”

Wang Xian held and thrust the sword forward once again. The surrounding water swords streamed into the longsword and charged ahead.

Before the longsword in Wang Xian’s hand reached the target, the water swords had attacked it hundreds of times.

This was known as Tiers Blade, which was divided into Ten Tiers, Hundred Tiers, Thousand Tiers, and Ten Thousand Tiers.

Inborn Experts who could reach Ten Thousand Tiers were considered to be domineering.

“With water mist, I can even alter the course of the water swords and control their direction!”

This was the true-blue skill and warfare.

Wang Xian regarded the Da Hong Immortal Sect Sword Techniques manual as a precious treasure since it contained a variety of powerful moves and a myriad of battle techniques.

Towards the end of his cultivation, Wang Xian even needed to analyze and practice continuously in order to master it.

Tweet tweet tweet!

When the sound of birds chirping was heard, Wang Xian looked up and realized the sun had risen.

The woods, waterfall, beautiful mountains and rivers and the birds that were flying high in the sky made the entire world seem like a fairyland.

“Hur? You’re up early!”

Yu Ling’er was surprised to see Wang Xian holding a sword, standing in the yard.

“An hour in the morning is worth two in the evening!”

Wang Xian answered her impassively. He had no good feelings about the lass who had been going against him.

But he was grateful to her mother.

Yu Ling’er raised her eyebrows. “Let’s go. I’ll take you to the place where we practice in the morning!”

“Great!”

Wang Xian nodded and returned the sword to its original place at the side.

“Take the sword with you. You’ll need to practice later with it!”

Yu Ling’er gave orders to Wang Xian like a bossy sister.

Wang Xian smiled as he took the sword in his hands.

“Can you fly on the sword? Jump down if you can’t!”

Yu Ling’er lifted her chin slightly as she took a sword. She threw it into the air as though she was flaunting her skills. With a leap, she hopped onto it and hovered down.

But her speed was too slow.

“Lass!”

With a single hand, Wang Xian made the sword suspend beside his leg. Wang Xian instantly came up behind her with the propelling of the water energy.

His speed was much faster than before.

“You... have you learned how to fly a sword before?”

Yu Ling’er was so surprised that she parted her lips as she looked at Wang Xian.

“Is it difficult? I mastered it as soon as I learned it!” said Wang Xian to Yu Ling’er plainly.

“You... Of course not. I learned it in a day.”

Yu Ling’er was blushing slightly as she gritted her teeth.

“Oh, ten minutes was all that it took me!”

Wang Xian nodded.

“What a braggart. How dare a lad boast in front of me!”

Yu Ling’er stared at Wang Xian before she headed down to a waterfall below.

At that waterfall, over twenty disciples were standing below, practicing with their swords without stopping.

Upon seeing Yu Ling’er, some of the young men stopped.

“Ling’er!”

“Hey, who is this?”

Those people gazed at Wang Xian with doubts.

“This is that guy who fell from the waterfall the other day. He’ll be practicing with us from now on!”

Yu Ling’er pursed her lips as she spoke to the crowd.

“Oh, really?”

Upon noticing Yu Ling’er’s expression, that group of young men quirked their lips as they scrutinized Wang Xian from head to toe.
