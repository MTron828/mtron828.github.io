“Two immortal gods have fallen. Now, even Lord Snow Demon and the others have returned to the island in fear. The enemy is simply too terrifying!”

“In just half a day, two immortal gods have fallen. In addition to the elite disciples of our two great immortal sects, the sky of Yu Ding is about to change!”

“At most, our world will appear in a month. When that time comes, I’m afraid...”

“What kind of terrifying existences are our enemies? Will they come and slaughter us?”

On the island, the people from Yu Ding world were conversing with a solemn expression.

Not far away, Wang Xian was listening to their conversation with a smile on his face. He walked into a restaurant and ordered some food on the second floor.

The food in the restaurant was placed on the table slowly. The entire island was in a state of panic. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The death of two immortal gods was much more shocking than the one thousand strongest experts in Yu Ding world in the morning. The Immortal Gods were the masters of this world.

Now, two of them had been killed in just half a day.

They were afraid that if the other party attacked them, they could only wait for death.

“Get the strange demon to monitor the two islands at all times. Once they come out, report immediately!”

Wang Xian drank his wine and spoke to Ao Yao who was invisible.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

A voice came from the void.

“According to the time, the Ding of Yu will appear in about ten days.”

Wang Xian had a contemplative look on his face. “With the corpses of two immortals and a large batch of spiritual herbs in the interspatial ring, we should be able to nurture an immortal God!”

“As long as the Ding of Yu appears, we will attack!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were sparkling as he drank the wine in his cup gently.

At night, the six islands in the world of the Ding of Yu were brightly lit. It was not as quiet as a few days ago.

Some people gathered together in panic.

Wang Xian and the rest stayed in a remote courtyard. Herbs were placed around them.

There were more than 50 types of grade-6 spiritual herbs which could be used to refine one type of elixir.

Wang Xian refined all of them into elixirs. The rest of the Grade-4 and grade-5 spiritual herbs were also refined into elixirs.

Perhaps the most dangerous place was the safest place. Wang Xian stayed on the island for two to three days without anyone noticing.

Among them, there was also the reason why the strongest person on the island was an expert at the elixir realm.

The Snow Demon Blood Arrow and the other two old immortals had not come out ever since they entered his island.

Wang Xian was not in a hurry. He took out the myriad refining table and began to forge spirit tools.

Currently, he had the most materials in his hands. level-12 spirit tools were made in batches.

“Boom! Boom!”

Finally, fifteen days later, Wang Xian felt the entire world shake. Sounds of exclamations could be heard from his surroundings.

He moved and arrived outside.

“The world has appeared. The cauldron of Yu in our world has disappeared. Our World is now connected to the real world!”

“The sky has changed. What action will we take next?”

“There was no notice from the Great Immortal. Ever since he entered the island half a month ago, he has not come out!”

Everyone in the Ding Yu World felt the changes in the world. They were all discussing in shock.

“Ao Jian, go and call Prime Minister GUI over. Bring the other two immortal God corpses back to the Dragon Pool and let the boss of the nine-headed Hui absorb them before bringing them back!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled as he said to Ao Jian.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao jian nodded his head. His body moved and he flew towards the dragon palace at a terrifying speed.

Now that the world of the Yu Cauldron had appeared, the disappearance of the array formation meant that from today onwards, the world of the Yu cauldron would also disappear.

He could arrive at the Dragon Palace directly from here.

“The Yu Cauldron has appeared. Why isn’t It Coming Out?”

Wang Xian looked at the island where the four immortals were located.

However, at this moment, on two islands with a hundred-meter mountain peak.

On one of the islands, the snow demon, blood arrow, and two elders were sitting in a large hall.

There were only the four of them in the entire hall. It was extremely spacious.

The four of them sat there gloomily. The two elders looked at the snow demon and blood arrow. “Now that Yu Ding has appeared, are we not going out?”

“It’s been half a month. The assassins might have already left!”

“Close the island!”

The snow demon sat there without any expression on his face. He raised his head and looked at the two old men. “Now that we’ve appeared, we don’t have the capital to fight for hegemony in the martial world. We’ll close the island for ten years and use ten years to create a group of powerful subordinates!”

“There’s no point in Yu Ding appearing. The Jade Hand Immortal sect and corpse Chief Dao don’t have the strength to fight against the nine cauldrons. We’ll just close the island for ten years and nurture another group of experts!”

Blood Arrow’s blood red eyes also had a trace of madness.

The two old men’s pupils shrunk when they heard their words, their bodies turning numb.

In the past ten years of nurturing GU, although they had broken through to the immortal God realm, their experiences during those ten years still made them feel terrified when they recalled it.

The bloodshed and slaughter were happening every day.

“Right now, there are only two million people, even after ten years, we can not nurture the experts of the past.”

The two old men said in a deep voice.

“The star guiding disc can be opened for the last time. With the star guiding disc, in addition to ten years, it’s Enough!”

The corner of the Snow Demon’s mouth revealed a cold expression. “Who knows, with the star guiding disc, we might be able to nurture one or two immortals!”

“Star Guiding Disc?”

The two old men’s hearts trembled slightly. They nodded heavily, and their eyes flashed with fervor.

The Star Guiding disc was a supreme treasure that the Jade Hand Immortal sect, Corpse Chief Dao, and the upper nine immortal sects had obtained together.

It was also because of this treasure that the three of them were able to become immortal sects.

It was also because of this treasure that the Jade Hand Immortal sect’s corpse Chief Dao destroyed the upper nine immortal sects.

The opening of the Star Guiding disc could set up a starry sky.

Cultivating under this starry sky would allow one to cultivate at a speed more than ten times that of the Yu cauldron.

In the past, the star guiding disc would only be used to nurture disciples when the immortal sect was in trouble.

“When the time comes, I’m afraid that the enemies hidden in the darkness will make a move to destroy it!”

An old man said with a slightly grave expression.

“What I want is for them to make a move to destroy it!”

A ferocious expression appeared on the snow demon’s face. “They haven’t dared to show themselves for a long time. It must be because their strength is inferior to ours. Otherwise, they would have already attacked us. With the star guiding disc, it’s fine if they don’t show themselves. But if they do, it’s exactly what I want. When the time comes, even if they are heavily injured, I will still kill them!”

“The star attraction disc is not only to train their subordinates, but also to lure them out. Such a powerful true treasure, they will not give up!”

A smile appeared on Blood Arrow’s face.

Killing two birds with one stone. Everything was under their control.

“Then I will announce it. If they are still here, they will definitely be tempted. We just need to wait quietly!”

The eyes of the two old men flashed with a glint.

The star Usher was also a very powerful true treasure to them.
