Chapter 1342: 1342 destruction of the country 3

Wang Xian stood there and touched his nose speechlessly. The corner of his mouth twitched when he saw Guan Shuqing and the other girls sitting there and eating their food angrily.

He had no relationship with Zhang Fengying at the moment. Although he had decided to take care of her in his heart, there was no result yet!

However, he couldn’t explain it clearly even if he had a mouth. Although he was extremely powerful now, what was the use of him in front of his wives?

Furthermore, it was obvious that his wives were dissatisfied with him.

Perverted and mature!

“Hehe, I’ve been away for quite some time this time and my cultivation base has improved a lot. Oh right, I’ve brought some gifts for you guys this time!”

Wang Xian stood at the side and transformed into a dog licking dog. He took out the hairpins and rings that he had refined.

All of them were items of the second level of the Seethrough realm. They emitted powerful spiritual energy and were worth a lot.

There were a total of six of them. Even Xiao Yu had prepared them!

“Wow, thank you, Brother!”

Xiao Yu stood up and took them. She winked at him and sat down immediately after taking them.

Wang Xian smiled and walked to Guan Shuqing and the rest. He handed them gifts one by one.

After all, it was impossible for a man to not be angry when he brought a girl back a year after he left.

“HMPH, don’t think that this little thing can bribe us!”

The few girls snorted softly and looked at it in their hands. Their eyes were filled with satisfaction.

However, they still didn’t let him sit down.

Wang Xian stood behind the few girls and massaged their shoulders and backs.

Women naturally had to be pampered.

“Everyone from the Dragon Palace, Crown Prince Jiang and Princess Yi ye are here to toast. Prepare the congratulatory gifts!”

At this moment, a voice came from the front.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and looked ahead.

An old man from the Tiandao dynasty was hinting at them.

Behind them, Crown Prince Jiang, Princess Yi Ye, and four or five young men and women were walking over.

“Haha, everyone from the Dragon Palace, thank you for being able to attend my engagement banquet!”

The arrogant Prince Jiang held a wine glass in his hand and held Princess Yi Ye’s hand as he walked over with a loud laugh.

“Prince Jiang, Congratulations!”

Prime Minister Gui stood up and picked up the wine glass with a smile on his face. He gestured to the back.

“Bring the congratulatory gift!”

A golden swordfish walked over with a gift box in his hand.

Wang Xian was slightly silent when he saw this scene.

The strong preyed on the weak. This was the natural law.

The Dragon Clan had a noble bloodline. However, before they could grow up, they still had to keep a low profile and lay low.

Prime Minister Gui’s actions were not wrong.

“Hehe, thank you!”

Princess Yi ye raised her wine glass indifferently and took a sip.

Her gaze swept across Guan Shuqing, Sun Lingxiu, and the others. A hint of surprise flashed across her eyes.

“Eh, I didn’t expect there to be so many beauties in the Dragon Palace. Come here, let us toast to you!”

Behind Crown Prince Jiang, the few princes of the Sky Island dynasty looked at Guan Shuqing and the other girls with glowing eyes. They stared at them and said fervently.

“Sorry, we can’t handle alcohol. Prime Minister Gui, please treat us to a drink!”

Guan Shuqing saw the gazes of the few princes of the Sky Island dynasty. She frowned slightly and rejected them flatly.

Wang Xian stood at the side. A hint of coldness flashed across his eyes.

A congratulatory gift!

The spiritual stones from the deep sea spiritual spring!

Next, Wang Xian wanted to make them spit out ten times more.

“Eh? Guys, you don’t have to be so rude, right?”

One of the princes saw that Guan Shuqing and the rest rejected him directly. His expression was a little ugly as he narrowed his eyes slightly.

“Ah, Tian Feng, what a beautiful hairpin and ring!”

At this moment, Princess Yi Ye’s gaze suddenly landed on the hairpins and rings in the hands of the girls. Her eyes were filled with love as she grabbed Prince Jiang’s arm excitedly.

“Oh? Hairpin rings?”

Jiang Tianfeng’s gaze landed on the hairpins and rings in Guan Shuqing and the others’hands.

“This beauty, can you part with your hairpin and ring and give it to me?”

He asked Sun Lingxiu, who was the closest to him.

“Gift?”

Sun Lingxiu’s eyes flashed coldly. “This is a weapon at the second level of the void interpretation stage. It contains a protective formation. Prince Jiang, our Dragon Palace’s gift is over there!”

Sun Lingxiu was a little angry. Not to mention that the hairpin and ring were expensive weapons at the second level of the void interpretation stage.

Just because Wang Xian gave it to her, it was impossible for her to give it to anyone else.

Give it to him?

What a joke!

“Huh?”

Sun Lingxiu’s words made Prince Jiang’s face turn slightly ugly.

“Tianfeng, this hairpin and ring are too beautiful. I want it!”

Princess one leaf leaned on Jiang Tianfeng’s body and said coquettishly.

“Alright, Alright. Don’t worry. As long as you want it, even if it’s the stars in the sky, I will take it off for you!”

Jiang Tianfeng looked at Princess Yiye with a smile and said dotingly.

After saying that, he raised his head and looked at Sun Lingxiu, Prime Minister Gui, and the others. “We don’t want your wedding gift. Just take the hairpin and ring as a wedding gift!”

“Do you have any objections?”

He, Jiang Tianfeng, raised his head slightly as he said that. Although he was talking about a discussion, his domineering attitude seemed as if he was giving an order.

Today, he was engaged to the princess of the one leaf continent dynasty, and all the people who came were weaker than them.

He naturally knew that the dragon palace was not weak, but the sky island dynasty did not take them seriously.

As the future king of the dynasty, as long as the other party did not seek death, they would definitely not refuse.

“You...”

Jiang Tianfeng’s words made sun xiuling frown, and her expression was a little ugly.

Guan Shuqing and the other girls’expressions turned cold instantly.

“This is still overbearing. A congratulatory gift?”

Wang Xian stood at the back. A hint of killing intent flashed in his eyes as he stared at them indifferently.

Since he had brought Zhang Fengying to make Shuqing and the other girls unhappy, Wang Xian naturally had to make his wives happy first.

He was originally waiting to discuss the compensation issue after he had made his wives happy.

He didn’t expect the Crown Prince of the Sky Island dynasty to be so arrogant and overbearing.

Furthermore, the looks of those princes made Wang Xian slightly unhappy.

“HMM? You are a servant of the Dragon Palace. You Don’t have the right to speak here. Shut Up!”

When the old man of the Sky Island dynasty heard Wang Xian’s slightly mocking tone, his gaze turned cold as he glared at him and berated him.

The old man’s words caused Prime Minister GUI and the members of the Dragon Palace behind him to turn stiff.

A servant?

How dare he call the Dragon King a servant!

The faces of everyone in the Dragon Palace turned cold as a solemn atmosphere was formed instantly.

When Wang Xian heard the old man’s words, he smiled faintly instead.

Indeed, he did look like a servant when he stood behind Shu Qing and the rest.

However, his smile turned cold slowly. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Wang Xian, the Master of the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian stood there and spoke indifferently. Prime Minister Gui, Guan Shuqing, Xiaoyu, and the rest of the girls slowly walked to his left, right, and behind him.

In the face of major events, Wang Xian was the most important!

Ao Jian, Ao Qi, ao Xia, ao Yasha, and the rest of the members of the Dragon Palace came directly behind Wang Xian.

“I left the Dragon Palace for a year. I didn’t expect so many things to happen in a year’s time. Next, My Dragon Palace would like to talk to you about the deep sea spiritual spring and the congratulatory gifts!”
