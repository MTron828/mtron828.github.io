Chapter 1532: Who the hell is the son of Light? Go

“Damn it! Damn it! This guy hit us two princesses! This is unforgivable! Unforgivable!”

“We can’t let him off! Isn’t a radiant priest a trash? How come that young man is so terrifying?”

Wu Qingyan and Wu Qingyan walked out of the fourth floor. Wu Qingyan patted her chest with a frightened look on her face.

“That young man is indeed a radiant priest. However, he is an extremely powerful radiant priest, especially for us darkness attribute cultivators!”

The woman followed behind, her eyes flashing as she glanced up the stairs.

The short battle just now had also caused her to be somewhat frightened. The other party’s attack was too strange and terrifying!

She was certain that if the opponent wanted to kill her, it would be very easy.

“Aunt Feng, is he really that abnormal?”

Wu Qingyan turned her head and asked.

“I feel that he should be a light priest at insightful void Tier 7!”

The woman said with a serious expression.

“A light priest at insightful void Tier 7. Oh My God, in the entire God country ruins, there are only five light priests at insightful void Tier 7. This... This is too amazing!”

Wu Qingyan exclaimed.

“He looks so young. I didn’t expect him to be an old man. No wonder he called himself Master of Light!”

Wu Qingyan said with a dark expression.

She had originally planned to teach that priest Wang a lesson today, but unexpectedly, she was taught a lesson by him instead.

He was asking someone to beat him back? That was obviously too embarrassing. Moreover, if the other party was a powerhouse at the seventh level of the Insight Void Tier, it was already a great honor for them to be able to come out safely.

“Old Man? Oh right, sister, let me see how old this old fellow is this year!”

Wu Qingyan said with a face full of curiosity.

“HMM? What do you think?”

Wu Qingyan looked at her and asked in astonishment.

“It’s a dark growth ring formation. I can see anyone’s growth rings!”

“When you guys were talking earlier, I secretly took it out to take a look. Old Fellow, you even pretended to be a handsome guy. You’re really impressive...”

Wu Qingyan took out the array compass as she spoke.

When she took a look earlier, she wanted to take a look. However, she was frightened by Wang Xian’s glare and immediately kept it.

Before she could finish her sentence, her eyes widened and stared at the compass in disbelief.

“No... impossible. It must be broken. It must be broken. How is it possible that you are not even thirty years old?”

Wu Qingyan widened her eyes, holding the compass in disbelief, testing her sister and the woman, as if she had seen a ghost.

“This...”

Wu Qingyan and the woman were also shocked.

“From that young man’s voice and every movement, he doesn’t look old, and this dark growth ring can’t be wrong!”

The woman’s eyes flickered as she spoke, her eyes filled with shock.

A seventh rank profound void stage expert who wasn’t even 30 years old? Was this heaven defying?

“How is this possible? could he have some treasure that can conceal his age?”

Wu Qingyan said with some disbelief, “If he really isn’t even 30 years old, then that’s too terrifying!”

Yes, it was too terrifying!

It was simply unbelievable!

The three of them headed towards the radiant villa in a daze.

“If nothing goes wrong, the light and darkness in my body will be able to maintain balance tomorrow!”

In the Holy Medicine Clinic, Wang Xian looked at the heart of Light and darkness in his body and thought to himself.

The current him had reached a terrifying level in his understanding of light and light. Coupled with his understanding of the light and Darkness Tai Chi, he would be able to complete a transformation very soon.

The next day, Wang Xian continued to treat all kinds of patients for free. This time, he ordered 20 patients to come up for treatment at once.

The speed was doubled.

In the afternoon, the number of patients treated had reached more than 1,000.

At this time, the darkness in his body had also maintained a balance.

“There are quite a lot of people around, but they are all old and weak soldiers. I can treat such people effortlessly!”

At this moment, two young men and six or seven girls came to the front of the Holy Medicine Clinic.

A young man glanced at the people who were queuing up to treat them and said with slight contempt.

“Hehe, let’s go. I want to see who dares to refuse Princess Qingyan’s invitation. This time, I’m here to avenge Princess Qingyan!”

The other young man was dressed in pure white clothes and held a scepter of light in his hand. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly as he said with a smile.

“The son of light prince personally making a move will naturally make that young man feel ashamed!”

“He’s not just feeling ashamed. I reckon that in the future, only the son of light prince will follow his lead. hehehe!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The sound of a few girls giggling could be heard from the side.

They were all the most elite radiant priests of the Divine Light Empire. There were six to seven girls, and each of them was close to the insightful emptiness realm.

The prince known as the son of light had even reached the second level of the insightful emptiness realm.

“Everyone, what are you doing?”

At the entrance of the Holy Medicine Clinic, a receptionist saw them walking over and asked.

“The son of Light’s prince is here. Aren’t you going to get out of the way quickly?”

The young man snorted at the receptionist and the group of people walked forward.

“The Prince of Light?”

The receptionist was slightly shocked. She widened her eyes and looked at their figures in shock.

Then, she quickly chased after them.

“The Prince of Light, is that the Prince of Light?”

“No way, that’s actually the Prince of light, this, this...”

When the surrounding people heard their words, they revealed shocked expressions.

Child of light, this was a very honorable title among the radiant priests.

It represented the most outstanding priest of the younger generation.

Every young man and woman who could become the child of Light’s daughter of light would be a top radiant priest in the future.

The current generation’s child of light was a prince of the Divine Light Dynasty.

The identity and background of the child of light was even more powerful. She was the princess of Wuji Dynasty.

That young man was actually the son of light?

“This lord son of light, what is he going to do?”

The surrounding people were all stunned.

“Lord son of Light, Young Masters and Young Ladies, are you going to the fourth floor? Our lord priest Wang is treating a patient, don’t disturb him!”

The female receptionist caught up and saw them walking towards the fourth floor, so she quickly shouted.

“Shut up! You have no right to speak here!”

The young man standing beside the Prince of Light revealed a hint of impatience when he heard the female receptionist’s voice.

He waved his arm and a wave of light force collided with the female receptionist’s body.

“Ah!”

The female receptionist who had just stepped onto the last staircase was knocked down by the force and fell down. She let out a cry of surprise.

Wang Xian, who was treating the patient in the room, heard the sounds and cries of surprise from outside. A cold glint flashed across his eyes as he looked outside.
