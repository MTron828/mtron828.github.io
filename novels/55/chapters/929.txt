Chapter 930: 0931, the King of the Holy Sea Town’s mercenary group

Translator: 549690339

“What kind of creature is this? Could it be that he’s an expert from the demon race who has transformed into a human?”

“No, that’s not right. He has the aura of a human. He should be a bloodline cultivator!”

“Hiss, what a powerful aura. What kind of bloodline is this? So Powerful!”

In the formation, when Wang Xian revealed his body size, the expressions of the people from the sword scar mercenary group changed drastically.

The powerful aura and the majestic and huge body made everyone dumbfounded.

“A bloodline cultivator!”

Knife Scar’s pupils contracted slightly as his eyes revealed a vigilant look.

On the transcendence continent, other than the common cultivation method of absorbing spiritual energy, there was also a very special cultivation method.

It was called a bloodline cultivator!

A bloodline cultivator had a huge advantage. As long as he had sufficient energy and sufficient bloodline, his strength would be able to increase rapidly.

On the transcendental continent, the most powerful race was the dragon race bloodline.

On the transcendental continent, there was a race called the DRAKONID race. They had the bloodline of the dragon race, the peak race on the transcendental continent.

Once they awakened this bloodline, their cultivation speed would be very fast.

They didn’t even need to comprehend supernatural powers. As long as their strength reached a certain level, they could automatically comprehend supernatural powers.

The drakonid race had established a powerful empire in the transcendence continent, the Dragon Empire.

The strength of the Dragon Empire was at the top of the entire transcendence continent.

However, Wang Xian’s transformation was very rare among the bloodline cultivators.

Even the strong ones among the dragon bloodline cultivators could not transform into dragons. They could only transform part of their bodies into the dragon race.

Furthermore, there was a limit to the strength of a bloodline cultivator. Once they reached the peak of the bloodline, they would never be able to increase their strength.

The solidification of the bloodline would set a limit.

Even so, there were still many people who wanted to become a bloodline cultivator.

“Roar, Kill!”

Wang Xian let out a low roar. His body moved and he attacked Dao Hen.

Beside him, Ao Jian and the rest of Ao Yao’s group also attacked Dao Hen’s group.

“He’s just a bloodline cultivator. Today, I’ll kill you, you bastard!”

Dao Hen’s expression didn’t change when he saw Wang Xian attacking. He raised his weapon with one arm and a terrifying golden radiance slashed at Wang Xian.

The golden radiance condensed into a hundred-meter-wide violent blade that emitted a terrifying aura.

“Kill!”

All the members of the Saber scar mercenary group and the remaining ten or so experts gritted their teeth and charged forward.

The opponent didn’t have any transcendent level seven experts. As long as the commander of the Saber Scar Group killed that bluffing monster, they would win.

Furthermore, the opponent only had thirty people while they still had more than eighty people.

They weren’t afraid of two to three people attacking one.

Crack! Crack! Crack

Wang Xian’s Golden Dragon Claw clawed at the hundred-meter-long saber. The saber collapsed immediately after the collision of the metal elements!

“What a strong physical body!”

Dao Hen’s expression changed slightly as a grave expression appeared on his face.

However, at this moment, Wang Xian’s Dragon Claw had already attacked.

His terrifying 30-meter-long body was already two to three meters in size with just his dragon claw.

The terrifying Golden Dragon Claw went straight for Dao Hen’s body.

“Bang!”

“Get lost!”

Dao Hen had only one arm, but his strength was extremely terrifying. With a wave of his long saber, it instantly condensed into a golden mountain and charged towards the Dragon Claw.

“Boom!”

Wang Xian’s body trembled.

Dao Hen leaped and flew into the sky. With a swing of his saber, he split into three terrifying saber rays.

“10,000 Saber Light Slash!”

Dao Hen roared loudly. Three saber rays were released and split apart rapidly, forming one meter long golden sabers.

The golden sabers covered an area of 1,000 meters, completely enveloping Wang Xian.

This was a supernatural ability!

“Golden void rend!”

Wang Xian’s expression did not change. With a wave of his dragon claws, 10,000 golden rays of light attacked forward in an instant.

“Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang!”

The intense sounds of collision rang out. A large area of space within the formation was completely covered by their attacks!

“Ah, ah, ah, ah!”

At this moment, screams of pain could be heard from below.

“What?”

Dao Hen swept his gaze over and a look of shock instantly appeared in his eyes.

In the area below, that black and white terrifying creature was like the god of death. It easily killed the subordinates of Dao Hen’s mercenary group.

Even the only level 6 transcendent expert in his mercenary group was killed in an instant!

This...

“Leader, Help!”

When the members of the Saber scar mercenary group clashed with the members of the Dragon Palace, the ones who were fighting with the Golden Swordfish were still fine.

But the warriors who were fighting with Ao Yao and the others had terrified expressions on their faces.

Terrifying!

Terrifying!

After the strange monsters evolved into the light dragon, although their cultivation was only at the 3rd rank, they were able to unleash the strength of the 5th rank.

Among the members of the blade scar mercenary group, only 6 were at the 5th rank.

The rest were all below the 5th rank.

With such a huge gap, the members of the blade scar mercenary group suffered heavy losses.

The only one who was at transcendent level six was killed instantly by Ao Yao!

When a captain of the sword scar mercenary group saw this situation, he immediately shouted in fear.

One of the eyes of the sword scar was about to split open. A ferocious expression appeared on his face.

This was his subordinate, the number one mercenary group in Holy Sea Town that he had spent decades to build.

Now, they suffered heavy losses in an instant.

“Don’t be distracted during the battle!”

Wang Xian saw that Dao Hen was in a daze and didn’t take the opportunity to attack. Instead, he revealed a cold expression.

“Killing me is like squashing an ant. I want to see how Leader Dao Hen squashed me to death. Let’s fight seriously!”

“Haha!”

Wang Xian let out a wild roar, “Water Crisis City!”

Water Crisis City, a water attribute supernatural ability!

Water, the blue water that appeared out of thin air, covered an area of more than 1,000 meters once again, completely enveloping the saber scar.

The terrifying water energy instantly formed a restraint and the water shockwave attacked the saber scar.

The expression of the saber scar changed slightly.

“Sea Splitter!”

Sea splitter, a metal attribute ability.

In the face of an expert whose strength was not much different from his, the opponent could only use his ability to defend against his ability!

Boom

The ocean with a radius of more than 1,000 meters was torn apart from the middle! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Water-born wood, the descent of the wood world!”

Wang Xian’s expression did not change as he continued to cast his supernatural ability.

The descent of the wood world!

Splash

Huge trees grew out from the sea water that was split apart by the sea.

With the support of the water energy, Wang Xian realized that the descent of the wood world that he cast this time was much stronger than before.

“How can there be so many attributes? How is this possible? !”

Dao Hen looked extremely embarrassed when he saw that the water attribute had been converted into wood attribute.

In the transcendence realm, other than the weapons and armor, the biggest difference in the strength of a martial artist was their ABHIJNA.

Every time a martial artist leveled up, there would be an additional abhijna.

However, martial artists with multiple attributes were an exception. Every time they leveled up, they would need to comprehend the Abhijna of the attributes that they were cultivating.

This was the reason why warriors with multiple attributes could fight beyond their levels.
