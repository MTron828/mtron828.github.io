Translator: 5496903

When Qian Ye received the message of Wang Xian’s challenge, a smile appeared on her face.

At that time, he knew that this was a great opportunity for him and the entire thousand shadows mercenary group.

He could use this opportunity to expand the influence of the thousand shadows mercenary group by more than ten times.

He could use this opportunity to recruit more powerful members for the Thousand Shadows mercenary group.

As for the duel this time, he really didn’t take it to heart.

“Senior thousand leaves’thousand shadow mercenary group actually recruited members? Haha, I’ll definitely go to the Thousand Shadow mercenary group after graduation!”

“I want to go as well. I’ll go in a while. I wonder if I have the qualifications!”

“Haha, although I’m not from the Divine Wind Academy, I still want to give it a try. The Thousand Shadow mercenary group has a boundless future!”

When the 200,000 plus people on the surrounding arenas heard Qian Ye’s words, some of the middle-aged youths revealed expressions of interest.

To reach the insightful void realm at such a young age and create such a powerful mercenary group, this Qian ye might be able to become a powerful force that could shake the entire flowing sea region.

If he joined now, it would be extremely beneficial to his future.

“This Qian ye is truly talented. After today, the Thousand Shadow mercenary group will become a hot existence. At that time, there will definitely be many experts joining. Amazing, truly worthy of being the king of Heaven’s chosen!”

Some insightful void martial experts looked at Qian Ye in the sky, their eyes flashing as they exclaimed in admiration.

When the members of the Thousand Shadow mercenary group saw this scene, they looked at their leader with admiration.

Although their group leader was young, he was definitely a king. In the future, he would definitely be able to step onto the peak.

“Are you done talking? Isn’t it time to come down?”

At this moment, a cold voice suddenly sounded, causing everyone to be slightly stunned.

“Eh?”

This voice caused everyone’s faces to reveal a stunned expression. Over 200,000 people looked towards the center of the arena.

“This... The Nameless Heaven’s favorite must be feeling angry that he was ignored by everyone!”

“He still wants to challenge? Is he courting death?”

“He still dares to continue challenging? Shouldn’t he surrender now?”

“The voice was very loud just now. Now that he has been completely ignored, he might feel uncomfortable. However, this Nameless Heaven’s favorite is a little irrational. If Ruo Qianye wants to argue with him, she can just kill him directly!”

When the people in the arena saw that Wang Xian still dared to provoke them, they showed disdain on their faces.

“Hehe!”

Qian ye looked at Wang Xian and looked at the figure hidden under the mask. Her eyes were filled with indifference.

“Do you still want to fight? Just admit defeat. You have reached such a stage at such a young age. Even I admire you. Are you interested in joining our thousand shadows mercenary group?”

He looked down at Wang Xian with a superior attitude and asked.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and looked at Qian ye who was boasting in the air. He was filled with displeasure.

If you want to be boastful, so be it. You even want to step on me to be boastful. This is your fault!

Moreover, you are still looking down on me with the attitude of a superior.

Hehe!

The so-called invitation was still the attitude of a superior!

In Wang Xian’s opinion, she was really arrogant!

Extremely arrogant!

What qualifications did he have?

“Haha, Senior Qian Ye is really magnanimous. She was provoked by a nobody and even invited him to join the Thousand Shadows Mercenary Group!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Facing such an arrogant and provocative person, if it were me, I would kill him with a slap. Qian ye is really magnanimous!”

In the eyes of the surrounding young men, Qian ye was extremely magnanimous and magnanimous!

She had the aura of a powerhouse!

On the other hand, the so-called nobody was just a nobody!

“Get Down Here!”

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly as a cold expression appeared in his eyes.

“HMM?”

When Qian ye heard Wang Xian’s words, the smile on her face slowly disappeared as she narrowed her eyes slightly.

“Didn’t you hear me?”

Wang Xian stared at him and said coldly once again.

“You’re courting death!”

“You’re courting death!”

“You’re courting death!”

As soon as he finished his sentence, the members of the Thousand Shadows mercenary group who were standing behind Qian Ye had a murderous look on their faces as they shouted at Wang Xian coldly.

The people in the surrounding arenas were also staring at Wang Xian in astonishment.

This nameless man was really courting death!

“I won’t care about the provocation of an ant. However, if this ant keeps acting recklessly, I don’t mind slapping him to death!”

Qian ye stared at Wang Xian and her tone was filled with a faint killing intent.

“Haha!”

Wang Xian laughed out loud. A hint of killing intent flashed in his eyes as he stared at Qian Ye. “Why don’t you come down and try smacking me to death, an ant?”

“Reckless. I see that you are a heaven’s favorite with a bright future. I didn’t expect you to be so stupid. Once I go down, I will definitely kill you!”

Qian ye stared at Wang Xian coldly. After being provoked continuously, he was tempted to kill him!

“It seems like someone is going to die!”

Wang Xian raised his head slightly. He had already made up his mind.

This was supposed to be the fight for the top spot. Since the other party wanted to kill him, Wang Xian would definitely not be polite.

“Haha, Kid, I Have to say that you have completely infuriated me!”

Qian ye laughed loudly and charged into the arena.

“Courting death, this nameless is courting death!”

“Doesn’t that mean that he still wants to challenge senior Qian Ye? What a foolish fellow!”

“There’s a huge gap between half-step void interpretation and void interpretation. It’s not an exaggeration to say that anyone below the void interpretation stage is an ant. That nameless is still too young!”

When the crowd saw Qian ye fly into the arena filled with killing intent, they all shook their heads.

For such a young Heaven’s favorite to die in such a manner, it was really... Such a pity!

“Remember, the one who killed you today is me, Qian Ye!”

“Leader of the Thousand Shadows Mercenary Group!”

“The leader of the Heaven’s favorites in the Heaven’s favorites Arena!”

Qian ye entered the arena and remained suspended in the air above the arena. She stared at Wang Xian coldly as if she was judging and sentencing him!

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian laughed and moved his hand gently.

A black longsword appeared in his hand. The Longsword was attached with a scabbard.

Wang Xian had never opened this sword when he was fighting with others because others didn’t have the qualifications to do so.

In fact, in his opinion, this arrogant and pretentious Qian Ye didn’t have the qualifications to do so either.

However, Wang Xian still made way for Qian ye to unsheathe her scabbard!

It was because he wanted to be stained with blood!

It was because he wanted to be pretentious too!

Clang

A sharp sound rang out in the arena. It was a black longsword.

It was the second level void interpretation demon-free sword!

“Hey, why are you still unsheathing your sword? This fellow is courting death!”

On the stage, a young man sneered when he saw Wang Xian unsheathing his sword.

Wang Xian didn’t pay any attention to this voice. The corner of his mouth curled up slightly.

Similarly, Qian ye lifted her hat just like when Qian ye arrived.

Wang Xian, on the other hand, pulled his black robe gently and placed it directly into his interspatial ring.

He was dressed in ordinary black clothes, a mask, and a black longsword.

Some people were slightly stunned when they saw Wang Xian’s figure. A look of reminiscence appeared on their faces.

“I’m just a nobody. That’s why I’m called a Nobody!”

“Not long ago, someone called me...”

“Sword Demon!”
