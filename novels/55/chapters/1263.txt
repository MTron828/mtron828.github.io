Chapter 1264: The 1265 Demon Soul Beast was trembling in fear

Translator: 5496903

Am I an old man?

Did I descend here through the technique of descending?

Wang Xian smiled when he heard the Demon Soul’s words. He moved his body and attacked the demon soul directly.

“Don’t even think about escaping today!”

As he spoke, he waved the long sword in his hand. The energy of the three attributes of metal, wood, and earth vibrated. The huge attack and the thorny field went straight for the Demon Soul.

“Despicable, despicable!”

When the demon soul saw the densely packed bramble appear within a radius of two kilometers and cover it, its heart was ablaze. Without any hesitation, it hurriedly fled into the distance.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

However, the densely packed brambles were like terrifying tree demons, every single one of them filled with sharp thorns.

Once it was entangled by these thorns, it was definitely not as simple as being bound. It would be pierced through by the sharp thorns.

“Demon Flame Burning the sky!”

The Demon Soul looked at the terrifying thorns. The Flames on its body rose and it directly burned towards the thorn domain.

It did not stop and continued to fly forward.

At this moment, the Demon Soul’s expression was extremely ugly. It had just killed an old human who had used a special method to descend to the training ground.

It had never thought that there would be such a human. Despicable, too despicable!

“Can you escape?”

At this moment, a cold voice came from behind. The Demon Soul’s heart skipped a beat, and it suddenly felt an ocean appear beneath it, covering an area of two kilometers around it.

The seawater was like a demonic claw that extended from the ground, clawing towards its body.

This caused its speed to decrease immediately.

“Why does this human have so many tricks up his sleeves!”

A look of fear appeared in the Demon Soul’s eyes. It opened its huge mouth and spat out balls of terrifying flames.

The Flames landed on the thorns and caused them to burn slowly.

“Golden Spirit Tree Demon!”

At this moment, Wang Xian chased after the demon soul. His body moved once again and the Golden Spirit Tree Demon was unleashed.

The Golden Spirit Tree Demon Ability had three attributes. It was similar to the summoning ability of the wood world.

In an instant, a tree demon that was emitting golden light condensed from the sky. The tree demon was about a hundred meters tall and looked like a metal monster.

“Spirit Enchantment!”

Wang Xian didn’t hesitate and unleashed the spirit enchantment ability once again.

The moment the enchantment landed on the Golden Spirit Tree Demon, the entire tree seemed to come alive. It grabbed the thorns that covered a radius of two kilometers and threw them at the demon soul

“What... What the F * ck is this monster!”

When the demon soul saw this scene, it could not help but curse loudly. Its eyes were filled with fear.

“Roar!”

“Aspect: Wings of the demon Qilin!”

The Demon Soul roared loudly. A dark red flaming wings appeared on both sides of its body.

On the wings formed by the flames, there were scales that looked as if they were real, and they looked extremely sharp.

The entire flaming wings were twenty meters wide, and they gave off a terrifying aura.

“Wings of the demonic Lin!”

It waved its enormous flaming wings and slashed directly at the hundred-meter-wide Golden Spirit Tree Demon.

“Peng Peng Peng!”

The terrifying aspect demon Lin’s wings collided with the Golden Spirit Tree Demon, resulting in a terrifying collision.

The brambles in the bramble domain were instantly incinerated by the fire. The scales on them landed on the Golden Spirit Tree Demon’s body, creating a crack that was dozens of meters wide.

“Flee!”

The demon soul saw that even its strongest attack did not destroy the opponent’s divine ability in an instant, causing it to be even more alarmed.

This was a battle on a completely different level!

Its entire wing trembled violently and let out a piercing sound. The Dharma Idol Demon Lin’s wings were used to escape, increasing its speed by several times.

“Hehe, what a coward!”

Wang Xian revealed a look of disdain. His body moved and he quickly chased after the demon soul.

He would definitely not let this fellow escape. Even if the mission reward from the mercenary association was 100,000 spiritual liquid, he would still leave the demon soul behind, not to mention taking it as his mount.

“Flame piercing gold!”

The demon-free sword in Wang Xian’s hand attacked the demon soul that was trying its best to escape.

The gold spirit tree demon that was chasing behind was also waving its golden branches and attacking it.

“Ah!”

The Demon Soul dodged the attack of the Gold Spirit Tree Demon. The flame piercing gold attack landed on its body and instantly tore a long wound on its body.

It let out a miserable cry. Gritting its teeth, it continued to flee into the distance.

After casting its dharma idol, its speed was very fast. Soon, the Golden Spirit Tree Demon was left behind.

Even Wang Xian had to give chase with all his might.

“Oh my God, the Demon Soul King is in big trouble. Let’s Find a place to hide and quickly hide!”

“That human is too strong. Let’s Escape!”

Behind them, more than ten demon beasts of the demon Lin clan looked at this scene with fear on their faces. They quickly fled in another direction.

“Gold-splitting void!”

“Flame of the Fire Dragon!”

Wang Xian, who was following closely behind, attacked the demon soul one after another.

Facing the powerful attacks one after another, the demon soul’s face turned black. From time to time, it would let out a roar.

It did not try to block them, because when it used its aspect, its speed was the fastest.

Once it did not use its aspect energy to completely exhaust itself and dodge the human’s attack, with the human’s attack power, it would definitely die in its hands.

Numerous wounds appeared on the demon Lin’s body. Even though it was seven to eight meters in size, with its powerful recovery ability, it was still dripping with blood.

The scales on his body fell to the ground one by one.

“Roar!”

“Fiery!”

The Flames on the Demon Soul’s body rose again and its speed increased abruptly.

“Eh? What a fast speed!”

Wang Xian frowned slightly. Looking at the demon soul that was about two thousand meters away from him, his body trembled and he immediately increased his speed.

The entire training ground was extremely huge. The Demon Soul was escaping desperately in front.

Wang Xian was chasing after them from behind.

In the deep training ground, it caused a huge commotion.

When the groups of ferocious beasts saw the terrifying aura of the two of them, they spread out in all directions in fear.

“Eh, have we reached the direction of the Demon Beast Area?”

At this moment, Wang Xian looked ahead. In front of him was the bottom of the sea.

There was a formation in the middle of the dark red seawater that prevented the seawater from entering.

“Escape!”

The blood on the demon soul dripped downwards continuously. When it saw that the area in front of it was filled with demon beasts, a look of survival appeared in its eyes.

It dashed forward once again. The entire demon Lin Wings began to collapse slowly and burst out the last of its energy.

The wings of the demon qilin had exhausted all its energy in the few minutes it was escaping.

Pop

When Wang Xian entered the sea of the land of trials, he instantly felt that he had entered a different space.

If that was the deep abyss just now, this was the bloody abyss.

A faint bloody smell entered his mind!
