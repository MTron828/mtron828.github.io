Chapter 1190: Prince 1191 had to hug his thigh tightly

Translator: 5496903

“Roar!”

Within the Black Shadow Forest, a beast roar sounded out, and a terrifying pressure covered the area in front.

In the surroundings, all the Black Shadow Leopards’bodies stiffened. They looked at the spirit purple qilin, and a trace of fear appeared in their eyes.

The gap between the profound void martial stage and the transcendent martial stage was very, very big.

If the profound void martial stage didn’t want to let the transcendent martial artists know of their strength, it would be very difficult for the transcendent martial artists to sense it.

It was the same for the fierce beasts. When the Spirit Zilin lay there motionless, the fierce beasts would not be able to sense the terrifying strength contained within its body.

However, once the profound void martial stage experts erupted with terrifying strength, it was not something that the extraordinary experts could resist.

“That Lord has made a move!”

“If that Lord’s pet makes a move, then there is no need for us to make a move!”

When the group of Long Xiaotian’s subordinates saw that Ling Zilin had made a move, they all stopped. When a void interpretation level ferocious beast made a move, there was no need for them at all.

“Roar Roar!”

After Ling Zilin’s roar rang out, the leader of the Black Shadow Leopards revealed a panicked look in his eyes. He hurriedly roared loudly and quickly fled into the dark forest.

The rest of the Black Shadow Leopards also immediately fled in all directions in panic.

“Roar Roar!”

Ling Zilin let out a low roar, and a disdainful look appeared in its eyes. It looked at the fierce beasts that were fleeing in all directions, and gently swung its tail.

“Crackle crackle!”

Bolts of lightning were emitted from its tail, and directly attacked the escaping Black Shadow Panther.

The Black Shadow Panther leader, which had instantly fled a thousand meters away, felt the lightning coming from behind. Its soft black fur stood up, and it desperately tried to dodge.

Crack! Crack

However, the difference in level was too great. The powerful lightning landed directly on the body of the leader of the Black Shadow Leopards. The power of the Lightning paralyzed his entire body as he fell to the ground.

The group of Black Shadow Leopards around him fell to the ground in an instant.

“Brother Wang Xian, this mount of yours is already at the peak of the first level of the Seethrough Realm!”

Bai Qingshan, who was standing beside Wang Xian, sized up Ling Zilin and said to him with a smile.

Wang Xian nodded his head lightly and watched as Ling Zilin flew over. One by one, he brought over the black shadow leopards that were paralyzed all over.

Ling Zilin’s control over his strength was very precise. Each of the Black Shadow Leopards convulsed under the Lightning, and their lives were not in danger.

Soon, more than fifty black shadow leopards were thrown in front of the bonfire.

“Brother Wang, I want this. I want the largest one. Can You Tame it for me? I’ll give you the spiritual liquid, and I’ll buy it from you!”

Long Luo saw more than 50 black shadow leopards being captured. She pointed at the leader of the Black Shadow Leopards excitedly.

“Don’t get involved!”

Long Xiaotian directly dragged long Luo over, he looked at Wang Xian curiously and said, “Brother Wang Xian, don’t you already have a mount at the insightful void tier? Why do you still want to tame some ferocious beasts? It will take a long time to tame so many ferocious beasts, right?”

As he spoke, he looked at the Black Shadow Leopards one by one. His gaze landed on the leader at the front, and his eyes were burning with passion.

He did not have a mount. The best way to control a ferocious beast was to raise it since it was a cub. In this way, the ferocious beast would be more obedient.

Another option was to purchase a well-tamed ferocious beast. However, the strength of a well-tamed ferocious beast would decrease slightly. In the end, even if it was a well-tamed ferocious beast, you would have to spend a lot of time to make it listen to you.

Moreover, the best thing was that one’s strength was stronger than that of a ferocious beast. Otherwise, even some well-tamed ferocious beasts would sometimes lose control.

It was not that easy to obtain a good mount and a good pet.

He did not have so much time to nurture a pet mount.

“I don’t want it. Didn’t long Luo want a mount? I can sell it to her after taming it!”

Wang Xian looked at him and said with a smile.

His words caused long Xiaotian’s expression to stiffen. Bai Qingshan and the elder also looked at Wang Xian in astonishment.

“Brother Wang Xian, with my sister’s strength, even if I tame her, I won’t be able to control her. Furthermore, it should take you quite some time to tame them, right?”

Long Xiaotian smiled at Wang Xian in astonishment and said.

“It won’t take long!”

Wang Xian shook his head and didn’t give them too much explanation. He walked straight to the leader of the Black Shadow Leopard.

“Awoo!”

Seeing Wang Xian walking over, the Spirit Purple Kylin followed respectfully by his side. The leader of the Black Shadow Leopard looked at him in fear and let out a painful moan.

Wang Xian walked to its side and looked at the leader of the black shadow leopard who was nearly four meters in size. He reached out and touched its head.

Boom

A wave of pressure from the divine dragon charged directly at the black shadow leopard.

Roar! Roar! Roar UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

That kind of noble aura came from the pressure of the bloodline. It caused the black shadow leopard’s body to tremble violently. It closed its eyes and trembled non-stop.

Buzz

Wang Xian’s aura changed. The high and mighty aura became gentle. A warm feeling entered the mind of the leader of the Black Shadow Leopard.

The trembling body of the leader of the Black Panther stopped. It opened its eyes and stared at Wang Xian in awe.

“I am your king, your leader!”

Wang Xian squeezed out a drop of fresh blood and floated above the head of the leader of the Black Panther. The blood contained his spirit and will.

“Roar! Roar!”

The leader of the Black Panther let out a low roar. Without any resistance, the blood entered its mind directly.

“Water spirit!”

Wang Xian touched its body. The powerful water attribute healing ability entered the body of the leader of the Black Shadow Panther.

The injured body recovered quickly.

Roar! Roar

The leader of the Black Shadow Panther stood up slowly and rubbed its head against Wang Xian’s arm.

Long Xiaotian, Bai Qingshan, Long Luo, and everyone around were completely stunned!

What... What was going on?

In just a few minutes, he had tamed a half-step void interpretation level ferocious beast?

If they had not seen it with their own eyes, they would never have believed it.

Beast Tamer, wouldn’t it take a few months or even longer to tame a ferocious beast? How could it be so fast now?

Long Xiaotian widened his eyes and stared at Wang Xian in disbelief. He felt that he was shrouded in a mysterious veil.

Powerful alchemy skills and terrifying beast taming skills!

How could there be such a freakish person?

“Come here. I should be able to familiarize the leader of the Black Shadow Leopard with you within a day or two. In that case, you can also command it!”

Wang Xian waved his hand at long Luo and said to her.

“Me? Brother Wang, that’s great! I want the Big Black Cat to be my mount. It’s too handsome!”

When Long Luo heard Wang Xian’s words, her face revealed an excited expression. She was so excited that her small face was flushed red. She quickly walked towards Wang Xian.

“Little sister, this half-step void interpretation level ferocious beast is not suitable for you. You will get injured if you touch it. You Can’t keep such a pet!”

However, Long Luo had just taken two steps when an arm pulled her back and spoke to her gently.

After that, Long Xiaotian looked at Wang Xian with a glint in his eyes. “Give this black shadow leopard leader to me, brother Wang Xian. I will buy it for twice the price of a half-step void interpretation pet egg!”
