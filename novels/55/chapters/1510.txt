Chapter 1511: “1511, I said that only when there is light can there be light.”

“Bang!”

A loud sound came from Wang Xian’s Dragon Claw. Dark energy surged and a violent aura filled a radius of dozens of kilometers.

One Devil Master had vanished into thin air!

“What?”

“Use all of your strength!”

The expressions of the six surrounding devil masters changed drastically when they saw the death of the blood-colored long saber devil master. The two-headed Devil Master immediately roared loudly.

“Attack! If we can’t kill a person of the same level even if we join hands, we can kill ourselves. Kill!”

The Devil Master who was covered in a black robe with a sickle in his hand let out a cold and sinister roar.

His body shook, and the black robe dissipated, revealing his pale body. There was a death god tattoo on his body.

“Boil!”

He roared, and darkness surged, causing his body to rapidly expand. The Darkness Energy covered him, and the material energy caused him to become 500 meters in size.

His entire body was covered in darkness, and a sickle that was seven to eight hundred meters long appeared in his hand, as if death had descended.

“Keke, unleash all of your strength!”

The two-headed demon lord’s body shook, and the shadow of a two-headed demon appeared behind him.

Green-mouthed fangs, two hideous heads, six arms.

The double-headed Devil’s shadow appeared behind him, thousands of meters in size, staring coldly at Wang Xian.

“I don’t believe that even the first-class forces are afraid of our magnificent ancient city of demons. We can’t kill a person of the same level!”

“Jie Jie Jie, think I ruthless Sky Demon Lord, three thousand years to kill millions of living beings, everyone is afraid of me, today if I don’t kill you, I will kill myself!”

Furious roars sounded from the side.

The Devil Masters of Ancient Devil City were all legendary figures in the vast region.

They were not like those first-rate super forces that had powerful resources and backgrounds.

They relied on fresh blood and corpses to step onto the path of Devil Masters.

Every Devil Master was an existence that made people jittery.

Now, an unknown creature had come to them and destroyed the ancient city of devils. Yet, he wanted to kill them. If word of this got out, everyone in the world would laugh at him.

Who was the Devil Master?

All the Devil Masters were completely enraged. They unleashed their strongest powers.

“Kill, Kill, Kill!”

An earth-shattering voice rang out. The soaring killing intent caused the entire sky to change color.

The real battle had begun.

The two-headed devil attacked Wang Xian. The Devil Lord, who was like the Grim Reaper, also charged forward.

The Devil Lord, who was floating on the huge skull, also charged forward.

“Roar!”

Wang Xian was floating in the sky above the ruins of the ancient Devil City. He waved his dragon claw and drew nine black shadows as he attacked them.

One against six!

“Hiss, out of the seven demon masters, one has been killed. The remaining six are still as terrifying as ever!”

“They are more than terrifying. As demons, they will do anything in pursuit of strength. Among those of the same level, even I don’t dare to say that I am a match for a Demon Master!”

The few elders of the He clan looked at this earth-shattering battle in shock.

The sound of the battle here could be heard within a radius of a few hundred kilometers.

Even though there were fewer humans around the ancient demon city, there were still some humans who were looking in their direction with bewildered expressions.

Some of the braver ones were rushing over.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

A brutal roar was heard once again.

Wang Xian’s body was waving his dragon claws as he fought with the six demon lords.

Facing six existences of the same level, Wang Xian, who was completely shrouded in darkness, did not feel too much pressure.

At his heart, he could feel the endless power of darkness being transmitted over.

His entire body was filled with endless energy.

However, compared to the energy of the five elements, the offensive power of the power of darkness was much weaker.

If not for the support of the heart of Light and darkness, Wang Xian would definitely not be their opponent.

Even so, he could not crush them now.

However, his recovery ability and the power of darkness were extremely heaven-defying.

The sickle slashed onto his body, leaving a 50-meter-long bloody scar with a depth of two to three meters.

However, in less than ten seconds, the sky was rapidly healing under the nourishment of the dark energy.

Following that, Wang Xian once again fought vigorously against the six demon lords.

Each of the six demon lords had experienced thousands of years of fighting. Their combat experience was extremely terrifying.

When they joined forces, even Wang Xian wouldn’t be able to kill them. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Time passed slowly as they fought.

The thunderous sound continued to spread in all directions.

The Moon Hung High in the sky. The bright moonlight shone on the ground, reflecting the horrifying scene of the battle.

“What a terrifying recovery ability. If this goes on, we will be exhausted to death by him!”

The battle lasted for a full two hours. The group of Demon Masters used their dharma idols for the second time, but they were still unable to kill Wang Xian.

This made all of them extremely embarrassed.

The continuous battle for two hours also made one of the demon masters break out in a cold sweat. He roared with an embarrassed expression.

“Kill! I don’t believe that he can recover from his injuries without using any darkness energy. Continue to kill!”

The two-headed demon lord’s expression also became solemn.

Two hours ago, the demon lords who were arrogant and unruly were not looking too good at this moment.

After two hours of intense fighting, all kinds of divine abilities and dharma images continuously attacked. Even they felt exhausted!

The battle continued. After half an hour, the faces of the demon lords became even more unsightly.

“Dragon Country in the palm!”

“Dragon head the world!”

“Heavenly Devil Dragon Gate!”

“Devil scale chain!”

“Darkness Millstone!”

At this moment, an extremely pure darkness energy surged into Wang Xian’s heart, causing his entire body to tremble.

His pitch-black dragon eyes swept across the six demon lords and let out a violent roar.

His body expanded rapidly!

The Dragon Gate appeared and the Devil scale chain shook. Above it, there was a pitch-black millstone!

“What? He still has so many energy release Dharmic forms!”

At this moment, when Wang Xian unleashed all his strongest attacks, the six demon masters in the surroundings were completely panicking.

Less than 10% of the energy in their bodies was left. Now, that strange creature seemed to be at its peak.

“Run!”

The two-headed demon master’s eyes revealed a trace of panic. The two heads looked at each other, and without any hesitation, they directly fled into the sky.

“What? Two-headed demon master, what are you doing!”

The other five demon masters panicked when they saw the two-headed demon master escape.

They gritted their teeth and fled into the distance.

“Can we escape?”

“I have already paid tribute to all the souls of the living beings in your ancient demon city!”

Wang Xian leaped up and the devil scale chain soared into the sky, wrapping around the two-headed demon lord.

His gigantic head opened wide and devoured the two-headed demon lord.

“Damn it, Scram!”

The two-headed demon lord cried out in fear. Streams of energy shot into the dragon’s mouth to attack.

However, they were only able to fight against Wang Xian in a six-on-one battle. Now that he had escaped, the other five demon lords scattered. How could he be a match for him alone.

Under the moonlight, one could see the gigantic dragon head raising its head and devouring the two-headed demon lord in the sky!
