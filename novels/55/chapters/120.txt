Chapter 121: The Girl That Drives A Bentley (1)

For all three days, Wang Xian explored the entire Bohai Sea with his subordinates. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Three days of sleepless nights did not impact him much.

When Wang Xian stood on the Dragon Sect Platform again, a large number of men had already gathered before him.

Prime Minister Turtle, Roving Girl, Roving Lobster, Roving Heavens, and 800 Devil Monkeys!

Apart from them, some sea turtles and lobsters with no Spiritual Intelligence lined up together too.

These turtles and lobsters were captured by order of Prime Minister Turtle as he wanted to groom his own subordinates.

Wang Xian thought for a while before he agreed to it. For Prime Minister Turtle and Roving Lobster to groom their own men was a good idea too.

“Cultivate yourself, and enhance your strength as soon as possible!”

Wang Xian looked at his men as he spoke.

“Yes, Dragon King!”

The response was much louder than the previous time he’d come.

Wang Xian was satisfied. All the men from Dragon Palace disappeared in the ocean as soon as he gestured with an arm swing. All of them hunted for nearby spots to start their cultivation.

“Quite a good haul this time. I can sell them for quite a huge amount!”

Wang Xian was amazed when he checked out the treasures beside the Dragon Sect Platform.

Millions of dollars’ worth of Chinese Bahaba fish and rare Giant Yellow Croakers.

Four beautiful blood corals. One of them was ravishing, natural, heart-shaped, and the size of a thumb.

Apart from those, they found fifteen sunken ships in the last three days. Out of which, they found three ships with treasures.

Wang Xian found an emerald ring which was worth a lot from the sunken ships.

As for the gold and silver, it was taken by the system to construct the Dragon Palace.

“It has been three days. Time for me to go back.”

Wang Xian looked at the time and noticed it was already afternoon. He beckoned a few Dragonians over and got them to send the Chinese Bahaba fish and the Giant Yellow Croakers to the First-grade Restaurant.

After which, he kept the blood corals and the ring before he followed them back to the First-grade Restaurant.

“Director Wang!”

Wang Xian heard Manager Huang’s voice as soon as he was at the door.

He turned around and looked at the shopfront beside the First-grade Restaurant. As he lifted his chin and gazed at the facia board, a satisfied smile surfaced on his face.

Divine Dragon Medical Hall!

“Quite a speedy job. Not bad!”

Wang Xian expressed his satisfaction on his face and walked towards Manager Huang.

“Is it renovated?” Wang Xian asked directly.

“Director Wang, it’s in the process. It will soon be done since the place isn’t big. I’ll get the contractor to do it within the shortest possible time!”

Manager Huang answered Wang Xian.

“Okay, let’s take a look inside.”

Wang Xian entered.

The size of this place was not very huge with about 170 square meters for the ground and second floor. But as a top medical institution, such a size was good enough.

There would not be many patients in the future either.

The renovation was done in a retro style, and it would take about three or four days before it was completed.

Wang Xian was very pleased with the medical hall. After which, he went back to the First-grade Restaurant to check on the revenue made in the past few days.

The turnover for the past three days remained at just over one million for each day.

Buzz!

Just then, Wang Xian’s phone rang. He received a message from Xiao Yu.

[Brother, today’s Friday. I don’t have to do military training after school. So I’m having dinner with my friends.]

Wang Xian sent a message to Xiao Yu when he came out of the ocean. He looked at the date. Without knowing, it was already Friday.

[Let’s have it together. Just perfect, I can treat my roommates to dinner too!]

Wang Xian pondered for a while. He had yet to buy Zhang Wen and Zhang Feng a meal yet.

The two of them were nice people. He should buy them a meal.

[Sure, Brother. Where are you? We still have half an hour before we end!]

[I’ll look for you guys!]

Wang Xian got on his motorcycle and rode to school as he sent the message.

After he entered the campus, he felt the familiar attention on him again as some of the students recognized him.

“Wang Xian looks really cool on his heavy-duty motorcycle. He’s got a good figure too. So handsome!”

“Yes, he’s very handsome. No wonder Lan Qingyue declared that she likes him on the forum.”

“Handsome is one thing. I bet Wang Xian has some capabilities too. Otherwise, how could he attract Lan Qingyue and Guan Shuqing?”

“I heard that Wang Xian used to be very poor. He was working his ass during his first year. Now, he looks like he is loaded. He’s indeed capable and charming.”

The surrounding students exchanged conversations in whispers.

When Wang Xian heard that, he drew his lips. Looked like after he smashed the signboard of the Taekwondo Club, his reputation had changed tremendously.

At least those contemptuous and disdainful looks were gone.

To stay low-profile, Wang Xian took out and put on his sunglasses from the motorcycle. He did not return to his room. Instead, he called Wang Dahai. After the call, the three fellows in the room began to doll themselves up.

Wang Xian came to the female dormitory and waited for Xiao Yu and her friends to come down.

Xiao Yu and the rest had just ended their military training. They must be dolling themselves up.

Girls like to look pretty by nature. Since they had been wearing military attire during the training for the past few days, they would want to show off their most beautiful sides now that they were heading out.

Wang Xian took out his phone and waited downstairs.

“Hey, let me make myself clear. I’ll sit beside Wang Yu later when we’re having dinner. All of you cannot snatch the seat from me!”

“Wang Yu is the prettiest girl in our class. We don’t have hopes, but you still have a chance. We’ll support you!”

“Liu Ranran is not bad either. Besides, she’s an internet celebrity. Heh, I like her!”

“Liu Ranran seems haughty. She’s not as good as Wang Yu. Wang Yu is like a girl-next-door. She’s cute!”

“I heard that Liu Ranran can earn a monthly income of $80,000 with her daily live-streamings. She even got a car. Damm, being an online broadcaster makes you a lot of money!”

“Only rich second generations like you have a chance to woo Liu Ranran and Wang Yu. We can forget about it!”

Wang Xian wore a pair of sunglasses to prevent himself from being recognized. When he was swiping his phone, he peered over in curiosity when he overheard the conversation around him.

There stood five guys with tanned skin. Obviously, they were freshmen from military training.

One of them was rather good-looking with a height of 1.85 meters. Judging from his dress sense, his family should be quite well-off.

They must be Xiao Yu’s classmates.

Wang Xian pondered to himself as he listened to them.

“They are coming!”

Just then, the voices of the same group of guys were heard again.

Wang Xian looked over to the entrance as six girls walked out of the dormitory.

All the girls were dressed up beautifully after changing out of their military uniforms.

A girl in the middle was in her high-heels. Her body-con clothes shaped her perfect figure, making her sexy and gorgeous.

Xiao Yu was wearing a flower-patterned dress. Yuan Yuanyuan, Su Qian, Xiao Mi, and an ordinary-looking girl were standing beside her.

“Liu Ranran is so sexy, Wang Yu is so pretty!”

The guys beside them brightened up their eyes as they whispered.
