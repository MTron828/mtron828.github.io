Chapter 1203: I, No. 1204, am the chosen one

Translator: 5496903

The Sword Mansion was the most unique among the cave mansions of the experts.

The chaotic array in the sword mansion was the most unique.

Anyone who entered the sword mansion would be attacked by the sword array. The stronger the energy in the body was, the longer the attack would be.

The weaker the person was, the weaker the attack would be.

Some insightful void realm experts were killed by the sword array, but many extraordinary realm experts escaped from the sword array.

The Sword Mansion was located in the forest. It was a huge mansion.

“Eh? The sky is already bright!”

Unknowingly, a night had passed. The main reason was that Wang Xian had stayed in the blood spirit cave for a long time.

Wang Xian sped up and rushed towards the sword mansion.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

Just as he was about to climb over a mountain peak, more than ten terrifying bees the size of a human head attacked him.

“Eh? Life-exterminating bees, I didn’t expect that there are still some ferocious beasts that haven’t been killed by humans!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and the extremely hot sea of water swept straight ahead.

Boom

The extremely hot sea of water swept past and all the life-exterminating bees fell straight to the ground.

More than ten ferocious beasts of transcendent level nine were easily killed.

“The Stinger of the life-exterminating bees is a good material to refine weapons!”

After collecting the stinger, Wang Xian continued to dash towards the direction of the sword mansion.

There were dense trees that were hundreds of meters tall. Wang Xian was dashing among them, making him look extremely tiny.

“Roar!”

“Haha, Awesome, this is awesome!”

“Brother Xingyun, the speed of your purgatory mastiff is really too fast. It’s too domineering!”

“Haha, it’s just that this fellow still has a bad temper. However, I Like It!”

At this moment, a series of galloping sounds came from behind him.

Wang Xian was slightly stunned. He turned around and saw five people riding their mounts towards him.

The young man in the middle carried a long sword on his back and was riding a ferocious-looking three-meter-sized ferocious beast.

The Purgatory Mastiff was a ferocious beast with the bloodline of the second level of the Seethrough Void Tier. It was a well-known ferocious and violent expert among beasts.

Even though this purgatory mastiff only had the strength of a transcendent level nine, it was still extremely violent.

“Charge!”

The figure of the green-robed young man in the middle moved for a moment. His body emitted a strong wind attribute energy. The strong wind covered the body of the purgatory mastiff, causing its speed to double abruptly.

Looking at the five people charging towards him, especially the young man in the middle, it was as if he didn’t see him.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly and made a path for him.

“Roar! Roar!”

The purgatory Mastiff’s entire body was exuding black dark energy. As it surged forward, it looked like black flames and looked like a gentle breeze. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

When the Purgatory Mastiff flew to Wang Xian’s side, a pair of blood-red eyes stared at him and let out a soft roar.

A purgatory mastiff head condensed from the dark attribute attacked him directly.

Wang Xian frowned slightly and dodged to the side.

“Haha!”

The young man in Green didn’t even take a glance at him. He laughed out loud. The four young men behind him took a glance at Wang Xian and laughed out loud as well. Then, they charged straight ahead.

“You’re so arrogant. Don’t you know that people will die easily?”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and continued to rush towards the sword mansion.

“Clang, Clang, Clang!”

“The sound of the sword could be heard from a few thousand meters away. This sword mansion is much stronger than the previous immortal caves of the powerhouses!”

When Wang Xian approached the sword mansion, sharp sounds were heard, which surprised him slightly.

“So many people!”

When he arrived, he realized that there were more people here than the Blackcloud Castle. There were more than two thousand people.

However, what surprised Wang Xian was that there were very few insightful emptiness realm experts here. At a glance, there was only an elder at level one of the insightful emptiness realm.

Everyone held a long sword in their hands and stood in front of the sword mansion.

There was only one entrance to the sword mansion, and the other three sides were all backed by the mountain peak.

To enter the sword mansion, one had to walk through a thousand-meter-long sword tomb. However, up until now, no one had been able to walk through it.

Over time, this place had become a training ground for sword cultivators.

Wang Xian walked forward and approached the front of the sword mansion. Without a longsword in his hand, he looked slightly different.

There were people sparring here, and there were also people walking into the sword tomb.

The sound of sword chimes came from the sword tomb.

“I have a body without a formation. I Won’t activate the attack formation. I can walk through it easily.”

Wang Xian looked ahead and walked straight ahead.

“The fairy sword, Ling Jian ‘ER, is here! Ling Jian ‘ER is here!”

“I heard that Ling Jian ‘er advanced more than 500 meters in the sword tomb yesterday. She is simply too strong!”

“The most important thing is that she can exit the sword tomb easily. This is the most powerful thing!”

Just as Wang Xian was walking towards the sword tomb, an exclamation came from behind.

“Roar! Roar!”

“Move aside! Move aside!”

At this moment, a ferocious roar and a loud shout came from behind.

A familiar aura rushed towards them. There were four young men beside them.

“Those in front, move aside!”

There was another shout. The group of young men in front quickly made way for them.

Wang Xian looked over and saw the young man who was riding the Purgatory Mastiff staring at him fiercely.

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly. A cold glint flashed across his eyes.

After coming out of the sword mansion, Wang Xian was prepared to teach them how to behave.

Of course, they had to behave well in their next lives!

Wang Xian made way for them and watched the five of them walk over in an overbearing manner.

“Is this the ferocious beast mount that Jian tianxing obtained? What a ferocious aura!”

“Purgatory Mastiff, bloodline level profound void tier two. Heavens, I’m so envious!”

“If I had such a cool mount, that would be awesome!”

Everyone around had envious looks on their faces. They were used to the domineering attitude of Jian Tianxing and the others.

No, it should be said that he had the qualifications to do so.

Jian tianxing rode on the Purgatory Mastiff and ignored everyone. His eyes were only fixed on the long-haired girl in White who was holding a long sword in her hand.

“Miss Ling Jian ‘ER, are you going to barge into the sword tomb today? Let Me Accompany You!”

He rode the Purgatory Mastiff to Ling Jian ‘ER’s side and immediately jumped down. A light smile appeared on his face and the arrogance on his face completely disappeared.

“No Need!”

“Roar Roar!”

Ling Jian ‘er did not even look at him. The half-meter demonic beast that was like a puppy on its shoulder even roared at it.

“Miss Ling Jian ‘ER, take a look at this purgatory mastiff. How is it? It’s a second level profound void tier baby just like Little Ha on you!”

Jian tianxing did not pay any attention to Ling Jian ‘ER’s indifference and continued to speak with a face full of enthusiasm.

Ling Jian ‘er did not reply and walked straight ahead.

The corner of Tian Jianxing’s mouth twitched slightly and he squeezed out a smile as he followed by the side.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The dog-like ha, who was lying on Ling Jian ‘ER’s body, raised his head slightly and roared at Heavenly Sword Star once again.

He bared his teeth and had a fierce look on his face.
