Chapter 630: Boundless Branch And Nirvana

Haiz!

In a luxurious villa of Gui Province, a girl heaved a sigh of relief. A zither lay before her. As she saw over thirty disciples of the Dragon Sect with terrifying aura leave, she felt lost.

“Daughter, it’s great that you avoided this catastrophe. Luckily, you know the Dragon King!”

Beside her, the richest man in Gui Province, Tang Jiuchao, wiped away the cold sweat on his forehead as he spoke with a shaky voice.

“Heavenly Sound Sect has been annihilated!”

Tang Yinxuan looked at the zither in her hands with complicated feelings. Sorrows were written over her face.

“Survival of the fittest. Yinxuan, try to let this go!”

Tang Jiuchao paused for a moment before saying, “The Heavenly Sound Sect participated in the annihilation of the Dragon Sect. Now that the Dragon King is back, it’s only natural that he administers the same treatment to his enemies. It’s all about the survival of the fittest!”

“Luckily, you did not participate in it. They probably let you off because you weren’t involved much in it and that middle-aged man knew you!”

Tang Yinxuan smiled bitterly. She shook her head slowly and played a sorrowful piece.

...

While Roving Sword led the dragonians to take revenge, Wang Xian brought Xiao Yu and the other girls, together with all the corpses, towards the Dragon Palace on the yacht.

“Xiao Xian, how is Shuqing now?”

When they saw Wang Xian walk out of Guan Shuqing’s room, the girls crowded over immediately and asked about her caringly.

“I’ll definitely revive her!”

Wang Xian took a deep breath, forced out a smile and spoke to them.

Shuqing’s injuries were more severe than he had expected.

The flaming long spear had penetrated her heart. If he had not arrived in time to preserve her heart with the powerful dragon energy, Shuqing might have been dead by now. Having the bloodline of the Suzaku definitely helped too.

However, her conditions weren’t optimistic despite all that. Wang Xian found it extremely hard to fully resuscitate her.

Nonetheless, Wang Xian had the confidence that he would be able to do so given time.

“Brother, you’ve got to save sister-in-law!” Xiao Yu held Wang Xian’s arms and said to him.

“Yeah. Rest assured!” Wang Xian caressed Xiao Yu head and said, “This time, I’ve failed to protect all of you!”

“We can’t always be depending on you to protect us!” Lan Qingyue looked at Wang Xian and mumbled.

She had inherited the most elite bloodline in this universe and possessed the strongest Kun breeding ability in the universe. However, due to her lack of practice in cultivation, she was quite weak.

If she had cultivated diligently, she would have been able to handle a crisis like this alone.

“It’s all my fault. If only I had cultivated diligently...”

“Qingyue, it is I who have failed to protect all of you!”

Wang Xian extended his arm over her waist and spoke softly. “This will never happen again!”

As he spoke, he looked to Sun Lingxiu and Adjaya and forced a smile.

“Xiao Xian, Sister Lingxiu and Sister Adjaya are really nice. It’s all thanks to them that we survived this time and we have gotten along really well!”

Lan Qingyue collected her emotions, held Wang Xian’s arms and spoke with a heartwarming voice.

It was only through hardship that relationships are built and strengthened.

For the six girls, they had only survived this incident by fighting with their lives on the line for one another.

Adjaya, who they had resisted all along, did not take a step back. Sun Lingxiu, who had been giving silently, did not take a step back. They had truly moved Lan Qingyue and Guan Shuqing through their actions.

It was a great thing to have sisters who they could go through hardships together with.

Therefore, when they fought with their lives together, Lan Qingyue and Guan Shuqing had put aside some obsessions they’d held.

Wang Xian was taken aback when he first heard Lan Qingyue. He smiled soon after, reached out both of his arms and held the two girls in his embrace.

Adjaya and Sun Lingxiu stiffened up but showed a smile soon after.

“Hehe! Great. When sister-in-law Shuqing recovers, everything will be perfect!”

Xiao Yu was happy to see this as she wrapped her arms around her master’s.

“Xiao Xian, where are we going?” Adjaya stared at Wang Xian and asked curiously.

“You will know once we are there. Don’t be surprised then!”

Adjaya turned to Wang Xian and smiled.

Whoosh!

At this moment, a water pillar that extended over a hundred meters into the sky appeared. A humongous creature was swimming towards them.

The creature in the water was roughly fifty meters in size and was swimming towards them at a terrifying speed.

“What’s that monster?” Adjaya was astonished and stared vigilantly into the sea.

“Don’t be afraid. That’s Xiao Lan!”

Lan Qingyue came to the deck. The Kun, which Lan Qingyue had bred from a blue whale, surfaced from the water and revealed its humongous body.

Xiao Lan had now grown to over fifty meters. Soon, it would be able to advance to Level 12.

“Let’s go. We will dive down!”

Wang Xian stopped the yacht, picked up Guan Shuqing and spoke to the girls.

Adjaya followed Wang Xian to the deck with curiosity and jumped into the sea soon after.

As she dived into the sea and saw the majestic dragon palace, her eyes widened and she clearly couldn’t believe what she was seeing.

She acted just like how Xiao Yu, Lan Qingyue and the rest had when they came here for the very first time. Her eyes widened and her mouth was slightly opened.

Looking at the tall and slender Adjaya in heels and her red outfit, Wang Xian felt desire welling up inside him.

Following which, he turned his head over to look at Sun Lingxiu and Lan Qingyue.

He had been in Yong Chang world for close to two months and was already finding the thirst hard to endure.

If Shuqing was fine, Wang Xian would have pulled them onto the incomparably huge dragon bed.

After discarding some of these thoughts, he entered the Dragon Palace. Wang Xian carried Guan Shuqing and walked towards where the Dragon Throne was.

At the Dragon Throne, the segment of the Soul Returning Branch flew out of the space ring with just a thought of Wang Xian towards the Progenitor Tree.

Countless miniature soul fruits had started growing on the Soul Returning Branch.

Wang Xian heaved a sigh of relief as he prepared to carry Guan Shuqing towards the Dragon Pool.

He wanted to see if the dragon blood within the Dragon Pool was sufficient to revive Shuqing.

Screech, screech, screech!

However, before Wang Xian started walking towards the Dragon Pool, the sound of rustling came from the Progenitor Tree. The next instant, a stream of fire shot towards him.

Huh?

Wang Xian was taken aback and turned his head instantly. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“This is... Boundless Branch!”

Wang Xian was taken aback and his attention was fixed fervently on the red branch of the Progenitor Tree.

The branch emitted a red light as though there were rubies moving on it.

That was the Boundless Branch, a treasure Wang Xian had obtained in the Fire God Palace. At that time, the branch had penetrated his body and arrived at the Dragon Palace instantly.

Wang Xian wasn’t clear of the effects of the Progenitor Tree. However, the Soul Returning Tree could grow on it.

Considering the terrifying soul returning ability of the soul returning tree, Wang Xian knew that the Progenitor Tree definitely wasn’t something ordinary. The Boundless Branch that could grow on the Progenitor Tree would definitely be something extremely precious.

The stream of fire shot towards him and landed on Guan Shuqing who was in his embrace.

The flames flowed towards the damaged area of her heart. The fiery-red energy flowed into her heart instantly as though it was her blood.

Wang Xian was surprised and watched in astonishment!
