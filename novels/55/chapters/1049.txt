Translator: 5496903

“Hurry up, Hurry Up! I heard that there are close to ten thousand people gathered at the Phoenix Immortal auction house. That auction can only allow up to five thousand people to enter!”

“I heard that not just anyone can enter the auction this time. They have to meet certain conditions!”

“That’s only natural. If you want to enter, you have to have spirit stones and medicinal pills. Not just anyone can enter such a grand auction!”

“The auction held by Phoenix Immortal is considered the best in the entire star-moon kingdom. If I can enter, I’ll be satisfied just by looking at it.”

In the afternoon, many people from eastern sea city walked towards the central area, their faces filled with excitement as they chatted.

Although the auction was held in the evening, many people had already come to obtain the qualifications to enter.

They were afraid that they would be late and would not be qualified to enter.

When everyone arrived, they realized that there were already tens of thousands of people gathered around the auction house.

At this moment, the door of the auction house was still tightly shut. There were still a few minutes before the tickets were issued.

“If we sell tickets, we can earn a lot of spirit stones just by selling the tickets!”

Wang Xian looked at Feng Luan’s room and smiled at the crowd gathered below.

“The bloodline of a half-step void interpretation demonic beast is very attractive. If there are no strong people overseeing this auction, there might be people who will fight for it in the city!”

Feng Luan sat in front of the table and read a book.

She didn’t wear a veil. When she was with Wang Xian, she didn’t wear a veil at all.

“In that case, I’ll get your men to come over later!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

Looking at the current situation, it might be possible for an insightful void martial artist to rob the auction house in the city.

If he didn’t encounter Feng Luan, he might have encountered some troublesome problems.

“Don’t Worry!”

Feng Luan nodded.

“Boom!”

At this moment, the door of the auction house suddenly opened with a loud sound.

“It’s open, it’s Open!”

“What qualifications do you have to enter tonight’s auction? Do you want to buy tickets?”

“We are from the Ao family of Winterfell. Give us ten tickets to enter!”

The moment the door opened, the surroundings immediately became noisy.

“Oh my God, in the middle is the half-step void interpretation demonic beast bloodline. Oh My God, it’s the green liquid in the transparent pool!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Beside it is the half-step void interpretation pet egg. Ahhh, I’m going crazy. How great would it be if these two things were mine!”

“If we can get these two things, as long as we don’t die, we can build a powerful family in a few decades!”

At this moment, everyone’s gaze turned towards the auction house.

There, the half-step Void Interpretation Demonic Beast bloodline and the half-step void interpretation pet egg were placed directly in the center.

Everyone’s eyes revealed a fiery expression, and there were even many people whose eyes were filled with greed, wanting to directly snatch them away.

“It really is the half-step void interpretation demonic beast bloodline!”

At this moment, in the surrounding restaurants and crowd, a few ordinary-looking middle-aged men and old men looked at the green liquid, their eyes shining brightly.

Their eyes flickered as they scanned their surroundings, slightly clenching their fists.

They wanted to directly start the fight.

This half-step void interpretation demonic beast bloodline in front of them was also worthy of them taking action.

But they also had a trace of fear. After all, the Phoenix Immortal had the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan behind her.

The Fire Cloud Sparrow clan was simply not someone they could provoke.

“Damn, wealth comes from danger, as long as no one finds out...”

A profound void tier powerhouse made up his mind.

“Boom!”

Right at this moment, the four or five profound void tier powerhouses hiding in the surroundings instantly felt their breathing stop.

And the people standing in front of the auction house instantly felt as if the sky was falling down.

The noisy sounds instantly disappeared, and everyone’s faces were filled with shock as they looked at a red-haired middle-aged man who slowly walked out.

The red-haired middle-aged man’s gaze swept over a few places, his eyes revealing a trace of disdain.

“Tonight, the Phoenix Immortal auction will be held at seven o’clock in the evening. The auction venue can accommodate five thousand people. Firstly, those above transcendent sixth rank, including transcendent sixth rank, can enter directly!”

“Secondly, those with spirit stones and medicinal pills worth a million middle-grade spirit stones can enter!”

The red-haired middle-aged man said as he waved his arm.

One after another, fiery-red tickets flew out in all directions.

Each ticket accurately landed in the hands of the transcendent level 6 and above experts.

Even those hidden profound void martial experts received one ticket.

The fiery-red tickets directly floated in front of them.

“Hiss!”

In an instant, the middle-aged man’s move caused everyone to suck in a breath of cold air. Their faces were filled with shock.

The eyes of the few insightful emptiness realm experts in the dark narrowed slightly. The thoughts in their hearts were completely interrupted!

“What terrifying, what terrifying strength. I can sense that he can easily insta-kill me. Just what level is he at in the insightful emptiness realm?”

A cold sweat appeared on the forehead of a profound void tier expert.

Just a moment ago, he was prepared to fight for it. If he really made a move, he would have already become a dead man.

“It should be the force behind the Phoenix Immortal, an expert of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan. Moreover, he is a very top-notch existence!”

“Too terrifying, the fire cloud sparrow clan actually sent such a terrifying expert to ensure the conduct of this auction!”

Everyone in the surroundings looked on with faces full of shock.

“Those whose strength is below transcendent rank 6, and whose spirit stones and medicinal pills meet the criteria will have their spirit stones and medicinal pills examined later. Those who meet the criteria will have their admission tickets given to you!”

The red-haired middle-aged man said one last sentence and directly disappeared.

“Those whose strength has reached transcendent rank 6 and possess assets worth one million middle-grade spirit stones, there aren’t many who can meet the criteria in Eastern Sea City!”

“Bullsh * T! Over the past two days, there have been 30 to 40 great clans and some mercenary groups that came to join in the fun. There are at least 3,000 to 4,000 transcendent rank 6 people in our eastern sea city. Including those who came in with Spirit Stones, there are definitely more than 5,000 of them!”

“Sigh, it seems like I don’t have a chance. I really can’t accept the fact that I can’t enter such a prosperous era. How depressing!”

“It’s mainly because there are too many people from other cities. If the standard is low, the auction house won’t be able to hold them!”

“Is there anyone who doesn’t want a ticket for a transcendent rank 6 friend? I can ask for a thousand middle-grade spirit stones to buy them!”

“I’ll give you a thousand and five hundred, do you have one?”

The crowd around them were discussing among themselves. Suddenly, they began to buy the admission tickets.

They could buy the admission tickets for free and sell them at a high price? This was a huge benefit.

However, no one sold the tickets.

Even if they knew that they couldn’t bid for the half-step Void Interpretation Demon Beast bloodline, they still wanted to see the auction competition!
