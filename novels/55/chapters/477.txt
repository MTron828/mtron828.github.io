Chapter 478: The Wrath Of The Water God

“Legacy...!”

The girl was stunned and looked in shock at the fire demon with her bright eyes.

After which, she turned to Wang Xian and was clearly looking lost.

“The legacy of the Fire God could help erase the water seed in your body. This is a great opportunity for you!”

Even Wang Xian was shocked. Looking at the girl, he explained it to her.

The legacy of the Fire God was undoubtedly the greatest chance encounter you could get in this world.

However, the requirements for this type of chance encounter were extremely stringent.

Based on what the Fire God had mentioned, there were two requirements for one to inherit the legacy of the Fire God. One of them was to be a descendant of the Fire God while the other would be to trigger one’s fire seed.

If one was lacking in either of the two, he would have no chance at all.

And there were very few people who could fulfil both conditions.

Wang Xian carried the girl and approached where the fire demon was. His eyes were fixed on the three-meter spiritual cabinet.

The entire spiritual cabinet was fiery red and was made of fire crystals and metal.

The spiritual cabinet wasn’t a spiritual object and had no abilities. However, it was made specifically with Inborn level materials.

Beside the spiritual cabinet, there was a set of old lighting equipment that was still burning.

The fire demon stared at them.

Perhaps it was because he had not interacted with other humans previously. Although the fire demon had gained sentience, his intelligence wasn’t high.

He was just like a robot. However, he had a learning capability that robots didn’t have.

“That’s the Holy Water!”

When the girl saw the other side of the spiritual cabinet, she was shocked to find a silverish-white porcelain vial.

On the silverish-white porcelain vial, there was an extract engraving.

Wang Xian looked at it and was shocked.

[Holy Water Vial: Level 12]

A Level 12 Holy Water Vial!

Wang Xian’s eyes beamed with fervor. However, he didn’t move. When the girl inherited the Fire God’s legacy, most of the treasures would be his.

The edge of Wang Xian’s lips curved slightly as he looked at the spiritual cabinet.

Rumble!

The Fire Demon kneeled on the floor and pushed the spiritual cabinet aside.

An old man lay in it. The old man looked like a foreigner and wore fiery-red armor. In his hands, there were objects that resembled the hexa-star.

From the appearance, there was almost no difference. The only difference might just be that this hexa-star was fiery red in color.

Together with the hexa-star was a red book kept inside a box.

Fire God’s Secret Book!

Wang Xian lowered the girl gradually. Placing his arm on her back, he suppressed the water seed within her.

The girl looked at the Fire God in the spiritual cabinet with mixed feelings.

He was her ancestor. However, this ancestor of hers was a blight in the history of her family race.

The truth was he had humiliated a girl from their family.

This... was also the reason why she had the Fire God’s fire seed.

When facing the deceased Fire God, the girl felt exceptionally conflicted.

The fire demon knew nothing about manners. Standing by the side, he said, “The Blazing Stars are objects required for inheriting the legacy. Hold them in your hands, trigger the fire seeds and you can naturally obtain the legacy!”

Mm! The girl nodded her head as she stretched her hands towards the Blazing Stars.

Bzz bzz!

A Blazing Star seemed to have picked up her presence. It shook briefly and flew towards her directly.

Ka ka!

The Blazing Star landed on the chest of the girl. Instantly, all the clothes on her were set ablaze.

Wang Xian frowned slightly. Her clothes were made of water attribute defensive materials. Water and fire would repel each other.

Huh? She has quite a figure. Sss. A goddess!

Wang Xian was dumbfounded. Perhaps it was because she had inherited the bloodline of the Fire God or perhaps she was just a typical foreign goddess. She was really tall, almost as tall as Wang Xian.

As her hair was tied up, it had covered her body and she even wore a veil, so Wang Xian had not expected her to be so beautiful.

Based on a discussion he had with Wang Dahai in school, she was a “da yang ma.” Moreover, she was an extremely beautiful goddess. [1]

“You... Don’t look at me!”

When the girl felt the fervent gaze of Wang Xian, her weak voice resounded. Her voice wasn’t compatible with her figure at all.

Wang Xian rubbed his nose and turned around awkwardly.

Rumble!

Suddenly, the entire Fire God’s Graveyard shook. Streams of fiery-red energy swarmed in from nine directions and gathered at the ceiling of the main hall.

Wang Xian lifted his head and saw a huge Spiritual Flame Ball above him.

“Body Refining Spiritual Flame Ball! It’s at least Level 12!”

Wang Xian was shaken.

Rumble!

At this moment, a loud boom reverberated as though a volcano had erupted.

Boom!

Suddenly, the doors of the other eight side halls were smashed open and thick lava flowed in.

The lava harbored immense energy and flowed towards the ceiling of the main hall.

The lava gathered in the Body Refining Spiritual Flame Ball. Following which, a refreshing heat wave shot towards the corpse of the Fire God in the spiritual cabinet. After which, they were transferred into the body of the girl through the Blazing Stars.

This...? What a smart Fire God to come up with this method to pass down his legacy! How unexpected!

When Wang Xian witnessed what happened. He was stunned.

Legacy wasn’t as simple as it may sound. If he had simply relied on the Body Refining Spiritual Flame Ball to cleanse the body of the girl, there would be a limit. Just like how he had once cleansed Xiao Ran’s body and wasn’t able to greatly increase his strength. However, if it was done through the Blazing Stars, there would be a medium.

The effects of the medium would be similar to how they had used the aqua stars previously.

“It’s no surprise he is a Fire God. His great wisdom isn’t what a typical genius could match!”

Boundless and incomparably immense fire energy.

The entire hall was burning.

Rumble!

Outside the graveyard, sounds of explosions reverberated constantly.

The entire island was shaking.

“What happened? What is going on?”

“Why does it feel that the entire island is sinking? What the hell just happened?”

“The door to the main hall is open. What’s the situation? Could it be that someone has obtained the treasure of the Fire God or someone has entered the main hall?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

On various footpaths and side halls, the people from the eight denominations and the rest who had entered the Fire God’s Graveyard suddenly felt the entire Fire Spirit Island shaking violently. All of them were shocked and alarmed.

They stared solemnly but fervently at the large door leading to the main hall.

“The volcano of the Fire Spirit Island has gone extinct! It has gone extinct!”

“Something grave must have happened. Something grave must have happened in it!”

Those who had been paying attention to the Fire God’s Graveyard were astonished.

As they looked in the direction of the Fire Spirit Island, their expressions were changing rapidly.

Within the main hall, dense fire energy swarmed into the body of the girl while the Body Refining Spiritual Flame Ball cleansed her body.

Wang Xian avoided looking as he observed the surroundings and eventually focused on the middle of the throne.

The fire demon was right there and thus Wang Xian didn’t dare to act rashly. The strength of this fire demon was probably a lot stronger than him.

It was especially so after Wang Xian saw the armor and weapon the fire demon was using. Clearly, those were forged specially for him by the Fire God and would definitely be immensely powerful.

As the clear flames flowed into the girl, her great figure was glowing in a faint red light.

Currently, she was just like a goddess of legends.

Huh? It should be ending soon.

After approximately half an hour, Wang Xian sensed the disappearance of the energy from the surroundings. He immediately looked to the ceiling.

Even the Body Refining Spiritual Flame Ball is turning into energy!

Wang Xian was taken aback. Although this amount of immense energy couldn’t make her into a Fire God, reaching the Budding Realm should be easy. As for whether she can reach the level of an immortal, it will still be dependent on her talents, hard work and luck.

Grrrr, grrr!

Ling ling.

At this moment, a roar suddenly reverberated throughout the main hall.

The roar originated from the body of the girl. It belonged to the water and was just like the sounds of a tsunami.

As for that buzzing noise, it came from the Holy Water Vial.

Wang Xian turned his head over immediately and was astonished to see the stopper of the Holy Water Vial being removed by itself.

The vial of Holy Water rinsed the body of the girl.

Water and fire can’t coexist!

This was the wrath of the water god.
