Chapter 2891: , the starry sky trembled

“The Magus is dead, the monarch has escaped!”

A terrified voice sounded in the battlefield.

“What!”

“The Magus is dead, the monarch has escaped?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“No, no, no, this terrifying light is preventing me from escaping back to my divine kingdom, I can’t escape!”

“It’s over, our Magus Union is finished!”

Panic was coming, the end of the Wizard Association was coming.

Everyone who received these two pieces of news was on the verge of collapse.

The Wizard was dead!

The leader of the Wizard Association, the strongest person in the Wizard Association, was dead!

The monarch, the leader of the imperial court, a powerhouse that was almost as strong as a wizard, had escaped!

He had escaped directly. What did this mean?

It meant that their Wizard Association and the Imperial Court had been completely defeated.

It meant that they had been exterminated.

Everyone’s faces were filled with despair.

“What? The Wizard was killed by the Dragon King? How is this possible? !”

“Hiss, the imperial court’s Emperor has run away. It’s over. They’re completely finished. How long has it been? !”

“The Wizards of our Celestial Wizard Realm have been famous for more than 50 million years. They have absolute control over our celestial wizard realm. Now, they’ve been killed by the Dragon Palace in an instant!”

“The Dragon King is so fast! I saw him sitting on the dragon throne just now!”

“The Dragon King and the Dragon Palace are going to rule the entire Celestial Wizard Realm!”

The experts of the Celestial Wizard realm who were hiding in the void around them were extremely shocked.

They were shocked by the strength displayed by the Dragon Palace, but they still thought that even if they were defeated by the Witch Association, they would not be completely defeated.

They had never thought that the wizard would actually die here.

This was the leader of the Wizard Association, and he had incredible means. It was as difficult as ascending to heaven to kill him. Even if the Dragon Palace had a powerful crushing force, it would be difficult to keep the wizard alive.

Because such an existence had many ways to save their lives.

But they were completely wrong. The Wizard had been killed by the Dragon King.

Although it was a surprise attack, the wizard did not react and did not put up any resistance. It could be seen how powerful the Dragon King was.

The death of the Wizard and the escape of the monarch of the imperial court announced the outcome of the war.

“I can’t escape. I Can’t return to my divine kingdom in an instant!”

“The Divine Emperor Tianchen has sealed off our space. It’s over, it’s over!”

“No, no, no!”

A terrified voice sounded.

All the experts and disciples of the Cheng Wizard Association and the Imperial Court were on the verge of collapse.

Even the six divine emperors were looking for a chance to escape with pale faces.

However, when they saw the wind divine dragons attacking them one after another, their hearts were as dead as Ashes.

The Terrifying Dragon Palace Divine Dragons were not something they could resist.

“Kill them and invade our Dragon Palace. They want to destroy us. Leave No one alive!”

The 100,000 members of the Dragon Palace who were below the divine emperor realm charged forward with violent killing intent on their faces.

The eight-limbed demon fiend and the others locked their eyes on a peak divine king level existence of the Magus Union. Their bodies flashed as they killed rapidly.

The one-sided massacre began!

The Witch Association’s strength was much stronger than the imperial court’s.

They had more than fifty peak-level godly monarch-level existences.

There were three to four hundred godly monarch-level existences.

There were more than a million experts above the godly monarch-level.

Although their numbers were about the same as the imperial court’s, their overall strength was several times that of the imperial court’s.

However, they were rapidly decreasing in the face of the attacks of the Dragon Palace’s godly monarch-level experts.

“No, no, no, no, I’m not willing to accept this!”

Not long after, a voice filled with unwillingness and incomparable grief sounded.

Upon hearing this voice, the members of the formed Wizard Association looked over and their bodies trembled violently.

A divine emperor expert had been killed!

“Roar, Roar, Roar!”

“Boom, Boom, Boom!”

“Ah!”

The death of a divine emperor expert seemed to speed up the prelude to their destruction.

In less than two minutes, two more divine emperors let out blood-curdling screams as their bodies crashed heavily towards a Wu mountain.

“Boom!”

A terrifying collision sound rang out as their life force slowly disappeared.

“Monarch, monarch, monarch!”

The divine emperor from the imperial court raised his head and roared in a low voice as if he was on the verge of collapse.

Their monarch had already warned him earlier.

However, this strange array had sealed off their space. If they wanted to escape, they could only break through and fly out.

However, there was no hope for him to break through from more than twenty celestial emperors.

Death was slowly descending. This feeling made even a celestial emperor feel like he was on the verge of collapse.

They didn’t want to die.

“Hehe!”

At the center of the battlefield, Wang Xian’s eyes were flickering as he held the body of the Celestial Emperor. A smile appeared on his face.

He had guessed correctly. A wizard had a substitute puppet in his divine kingdom.

This was a treasure that he had obtained in a secret realm. This substitute puppet was extremely powerful and could replace his death once.

It could be said that this was a true life-saving method.

“Summon your void divine kingdom over!”

Wang Xian’s voice exploded in the wizard’s mind.

The Wizard’s body, which was losing its vitality, moved. In the sky above Wang Xian and him, an incomparably huge divine kingdom slowly rose.

The divine kingdom was over 10,000 kilometers in circumference and contained a terrifying energy.

Wang Xian’s body moved. He carried the wizard’s body and flew into his divine kingdom.

“What is this? Is this the Void Divine Kingdom of our Lord Wizard?”

“Is Our Lord Wizard still alive?”

Seeing the sudden appearance of the Void Divine Kingdom, some of the powerful disciples of the Wizard Association revealed looks of anticipation.

However, the appearance of the god country did not change their fates.

“We surrender, we surrender. Don’t Kill Us, don’t!”

“Don’t Kill Us!”

“We are willing to take out all of our treasures. Don’t Kill Us!”

When the god Emperors fell one after another, and when the god King level experts were killed one after another, the group of disciples of the Magus Union who were at the back of the Magus mountain collapsed and knelt on the ground, shouting loudly.

They were truly afraid.

They had already lost the hope of victory. Kneeling down to beg for mercy was their last chance.

Some people knelt down to beg for help and surrender. More and more Chengwu Association disciples begged for mercy.

“Godly monarch-level powerhouses don’t need to be spared. Don’t give them any chance!”

At this moment, the sky array’s ghastly voice sounded.

“Godly monarch-level powerhouses, kill all of them. The remaining Chengwu Association disciples, kneel down and beg for mercy!”

Prime Minister Gui pondered for a moment and ordered loudly.

Not a single godly king powerhouse was spared. Whether it was the godly King’s divine kingdom or the godly king’s body, they were huge resources for the Dragon Palace.

As for those below the godly king level, they could let them go.

After all, there were too many shamans. It was impossible to kill all of them with hundreds of billions.

“Kekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekeke

At this moment, Ba Qi’s voice sounded.

On the side, AO qitian and Ao Qi used the blood-red chains to completely trap the son of heaven.

The nine heads of the Heaven Array looked over, their eyes filled with icy killing intent!
