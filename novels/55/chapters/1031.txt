Chapter 1032: 10

Translator: 5496903

It was boiling. The entire Eastern Sea city was boiling.

For example, the arrival of the dragon spike in the past two days had turned the entire eastern sea city into boiling water.

Then, the city Lord’s Manor’s attack on the dragon spike this morning was like adding fuel to the fire.

Now, in the afternoon, the dragon Spike had directly assassinated ten city guards. This was considered a volcanic eruption! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

One explosive piece of news after another impacted everyone in eastern sea city.

While everyone in Eastern Sea city was discussing the possibility that the dragon spike would be punished by the city Lord’s mansion, or even suppressed, the dragon Spike had retaliated that afternoon and assassinated ten city guards.

Beside each city guard, there were two red pieces of paper.

One congratulated death, and the other sent a message.

The Darkness had already arrived. Whoever stopped it would be enveloped by it.

This short message was tantamount to a war against the city Lord’s Manor.

It wasn’t the first time an assassin organization had openly dealt with a city lord’s manor on the transcendental continent, but it was definitely the first time in star-moon kingdom.

The storm came too quickly and too fiercely, catching everyone off guard.

“This dragon assassin organization is really unscrupulous. No wonder they dared to assassinate the mayor of Bridgewood Town on the street. They’re awesome!”

“I heard that when they were in Bridgewood Town, the dragon assassin organization once took the place of the mayor to enforce the law and stabilize Bridgewood town. Now it seems that they dare to do anything!”

“This is the first time I’ve heard of such a willful and arrogant assassin organization!”

The entire Eastern Sea city was once again in a heated discussion.

It wasn’t just the ordinary people. Even the large mercenary groups of the large families in eastern sea city were dumbstruck.

This was too violent. If the city Lord’s mansion gave in in the future, wouldn’t they be the law enforcers in Eastern Sea City?

“Peng!”

“Outrageous! An assassin organization actually dares to provoke the city Lord’s Mansion and openly assassinate City Guards. They’re simply courting death!”

In the city Lord’s mansion, the city lord, who was usually calm and imposing, slammed the table in anger for the first time. Even though his aura was not released, the terrifying pressure still enveloped the entire hall.

This caused the city guards’leaders and the people in charge of the various districts on both sides to not dare to breathe loudly. They stood in front with their heads lowered in fear.

Beside them, ten corpses were placed there, filled with mockery.

“Dragon Spike!”

The city Lord stood up with a gloomy face and looked at everyone in front of him. “Gather all the forces of the entire Eastern Sea city. Even if we have to dig three feet, we have to find this dragon spike. Don’t let go of a single clue!”

“It’s the city lord. We definitely won’t slack off!”

Everyone hurriedly said.

“The ten city guards were assassinated in public. Did they leave any clues behind?”

The city Lord’s furious expression eased a little as he asked them in a deep voice.

“Reporting to the city lord, we didn’t get any clues. From the monitoring of the formation, we didn’t see any signs of Action!”

An old man lowered his head as he spoke, his face was extremely embarrassed. “And according to the news from Bridge Forest Town, this dragon assassin organization should be a special kind of demonic beast. It’s possible that they are an organization established by a demonic beast race that specializes in assassinations!”

“There’s no information at all?”

“Demonic Beast?”

The city Lord’s eyes flickered with a dark expression as he said in a deep voice, “Increase the surveillance of the demonic beasts in East Sea city. If there are any signs, immediately arrest them!”

“It’s the city Lord!”

Everyone replied in a deep voice.

“City Lord!”

The entire hall was silent for a moment. The city guard leader hesitated for a moment before saying with a grave expression, “City Lord, I’m afraid that this dragon Spike will continue to assassinate our city guards...”

The city guard leader spoke out the worry in his heart.

The dragon spike was clearly warning them now. However, if they did not catch the dragon Spike and did not let go, they might continue to assassinate the city guards.

As time went on, they could not afford to waste any more time.

“Send out all the city guards. A small team of ten people. I don’t believe that they won’t leave any traces behind. HMPH!”

The city Lord’s expression was gloomy as he clenched his fists. “Dragon Spike, since you want to play, I, Lei Feihu, will accompany you. If I don’t exterminate you, I, Lei Feihu, will lose face!”

“Go out and prepare immediately!”

With a sweep of his arm, a few electric arcs landed on the red paper on the seat and disappeared.

Not even ashes were left behind, and everything was obliterated.

“It’s the city Lord!”

Everyone was slightly startled, and they hurriedly walked out.

This time, the city lord was completely enraged. It seemed that he would not stop until the dragon spike was either destroyed or driven away!

Thinking about it, it made sense. A peerless expert whose might shook an entire region was provoked by an assassin organization. Anyone would be incomparably furious.

...

...

“I still have quite a number of treasures in my hands. If I don’t include the bloodlines of the wind wing savage fish, they are worth at least a billion middle-grade spirit stones!”

“I have weapons, armor, formations, and elixirs. I have almost everything. Hehe, if I were to destroy the Yun family, I would be able to hold an auction a few days later after obtaining the Yun family’s Treasures!”

Wang Xian sat in his room. The storm outside seemed to have nothing to do with him.

No one knew that the person who stirred up the storm in the entire Donghai city was such a young man.

Wang Xian was preparing for something. He was preparing to sell the bloodline of the winged savage fish and exchange it for spirit stones.

Currently, the best way was to hold an auction.

Right now, he had enough resources to hold an auction, but his ambition was a bit too big.

He wanted to hold an auction at the same time as Feng Xian, the life and Death Pill Workshop, and the holy item forging workshop.

He wanted to attract all the customers they advertised.

Although this move was a bit ruthless, it was also the most profitable time.

However, at the moment, the various items in his hands seemed to be insufficient.

However, he was not in a hurry. As long as he destroyed the Yun family, all the resources would be sufficient. By then, it would be sufficient to support the entire auction.

By then, as long as he released his half-step void interpretation level bloodline, who wouldn’t come?

By then, the entire Donghai city would be in an uproar again.

“Perfect Plan!”

Wang Xian was full of smiles. He looked at ao Yao and said, “Ao Yao, we will exterminate the Yun family tonight. You will be fine by yourself, right?”

“Dragon King, it will be done in twenty minutes!”

Ao Yao said plainly.

Damn, he even became arrogant.

However, Wang Xian liked it. He liked ao Yao’s confidence.

“Get the head of the Yun family over here. I will perform soul absorption and find the Yun family’s treasure. Be careful. I Can’t go over this time. Donghai city has already issued a curfew!”

Wang Xian said to Ao Yao with a smile on his face.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao nodded.

The curfew forbade anyone from going out after 10 pm. It forbade anyone from entering and leaving the city.

The entire Donghai city had not had a curfew for more than 10 years!
