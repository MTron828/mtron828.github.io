“Hehe, you all come with ill intentions. Our Dragon King will naturally not meet you!”

The Dragon Palace civil official’s gaze swept across the seven of them.

Seven people represented seven forces.

Each of them had a domain-level race behind them. It could be said that half of the domain-level races around the entire Mohan clan had come.

Hearing the civil official’s words, the seven people narrowed their eyes.

“I heard that the Dragon Palace has a divine dragon. Can you show us?”

An old man in armor said coldly.

“It doesn’t matter whether our Dragon Palace has a divine dragon or not.”

“If you want to make an enemy of the Dragon Palace or covet it, we can only fight back!”

The civil official of the Dragon Palace replied directly.

“Hahaha, Your Dragon Palace is going to make an enemy of us?”

The ancient rare race expert said with disdain.

“Of course we don’t dare, but if someone dares to kill Innocents in our Dragon Palace’s territory, then our Dragon Palace can only take revenge in our own way!”

The civil official of the Dragon Palace said and cupped his hands toward the seven experts around him. Then, he moved and entered the Dragon Palace.

“Take revenge in your own way? But do you know what price you have to pay for killing the experts of the brain spirit clan?”

The old patriarch of the brain spirit clan said indifferently and charged toward the Dragon Palace below.

A terrifying pressure rushed toward the Dragon Palace.

The dragon palace below even trembled.

“Eh?”

Sensing the strength of the Dragon Palace, the old patriarch of the brain spirit clan frowned slightly.

The other six experts also raised their eyebrows.

“The Dragon Palace has already moved its position. There aren’t many people here, and the buildings below are very weak!”

The old man with the body of a pangolin said with a twinkle in his eyes.

“Humph!”

The old patriarch of the brain spirit clan snorted and waved his arm, sending a terrifying attack toward the dragon palace below.

Boom

The low-level Dragon Palace couldn’t withstand the terrifying attack and collapsed.

“Everyone, from today on, the Dragon Palace doesn’t welcome your arrival. Please leave our territory immediately. Otherwise, we will also come to your territory!”

At this moment, an lie appeared in the ocean not far away and warned with a smile.

“Is it a threat? I hate threats the most!”

The ancient rare race expert’s eyes revealed killing intent. He waved his arm and a confinement circle attacked an lie.

The speed of the confinement circle was extremely terrifying. Even an eighth level God emperor expert might not be able to dodge it at such a short distance.

“Weng!”

However, in an instant, an Lie’s figure disappeared.

“What!”

The ancient rare race’s expert’s expression changed slightly when he saw an lie disappear.

The other six experts also frowned slightly, their eyes flickering.

“Check the surroundings!”

However, they didn’t give up. Each of them took out treasures and magic tools and searched for some information about the Dragon Palace.

“Dragon King, seven domain-level races, the ancient rare race and the brain spirit race’s experts have made a move. I suggest we start with these two races!”

At the same time, in the main Dragon Palace located in the Mo Han clan’s ruins, an lie came back and said directly.

“Alright, an lie, Tian Cheng, ao Yao, Ba Qi, let’s Go!”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes slightly and said immediately.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The few people who were already prepared nodded immediately.

In this half a month’s time, Ao Yao Tian Cheng, Ba Qi, and the rest had already broken through to the combat strength of a level eight celestial thearch.

With such strength, under the leadership of an lie, and with the poisonous horned dragon as an insider, they were able to turn a powerful domain level race upside down.

“Weng!”

The next moment, their figures appeared in the void.

“Dragon King, this is the detailed information about this planet. It’s about the location where the brain spirit race experts are distributed!”

At the side, Ba Qi looked at the Universe AI and smiled.

Half a month ago, a group of poisonous horned dragons had parasitized a few brain spirit race experts.

It was not an exaggeration to say that the Dragon Palace now controlled 70% of the information about the entire brain spirit race.

This included the distribution of some experts on this planet.

This planet was one of the planets controlled by the brain spirit race. It was different from the continent they attacked last time.

This planet was also one of the more important planets of the brain spirit race. There was an eighth level divine emperor guarding it.

This expert was not on the surface of the planet. Instead, he was cultivating at the core of the planet.

This information was obtained from the memories of a descendant of this expert.

“The entrance is over here. As the cultivation ground of the brain spirit race expert, there should be a formation or other precautions. An Lie, go and investigate First!”

Ba Qi said to an lie.

“Bring this magic tool and we’ll be able to find some information!”

The Sky Formation handed over a magic tool and said.

“Leave it to me!”

An lie immediately nodded and his figure instantly disappeared.

Teleportation, regardless of the formation, regardless of the size. An lie could even teleport to the inside of the planet.

The prerequisite was that he could withstand the pressure of the planet. Otherwise, he might die instantly.

With his current strength, he could still withstand the pressure of the planet below.

“Sky Array, here, this is the information I’ve gathered!”

Five seconds later, an lie returned and handed the magic tool to sky array as he said with a smile.

Sky Array took the magic tool and looked at it, a smile on his face.

“Dragon King, we can ask an lie to bring us here directly. At such a close distance, we can instantly kill our way to the center.”

The Heaven Formation pointed at an illusory sphere formed by the magic tool and said.

“Alright, let’s do it!”

Wang Xian looked at it and nodded immediately.

The core of this planet was a blessed land for cultivation. There was a large amount of earth core flame in it.

It would be twice the result with half the effort if the fire attribute experts were to cultivate here.

There were a few warning formations on the surface of this planet. However, these few warning formations allowed an lie to bring them through directly.

With a wave of an Lie’s arm, they instantly appeared in the interior of the planet.

This allowed an lie to open up a ten-cubic-meter space.

“Dragon’s Eye!”

Wang Xian looked down and saw a brain spirit expert with a huge head cultivating inside.

“Do it!”

He squinted his eyes slightly and gestured to AO Yaoyao Baqi.

Buzz

In the next moment, the soil beneath them split apart and went straight to the brain spirit expert who was cultivating.

“What!”

The brain spirit expert who was cultivating sensed the commotion above. His expression changed slightly and he raised his head immediately.

“Dragon Eye Lock!”

“Instant kill!”

“Terrifying roar!”

“Octagonal sword!”

At this moment, Wang Xian and the rest launched their strongest attack instantly.

Death, come!
