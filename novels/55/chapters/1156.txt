“The dragon spike is too strong. It still carries out missions as usual and earns a large amount of spirit stones. It doesn’t care about the undercurrent at all!”

“The undercurrent has no way to deal with the dragon spike at the moment. After the master of undercurrent took action personally that day, I reckon the dragon Spike will be on guard!”

“The winner hasn’t been decided yet. I reckon we’ll have to wait for another two days!”

“We can wait for two days, but some people in Bright Moon City can’t. Last night, dozens of people were assassinated. I reckon more people will hire dragon Spike Today!”

There were about 20 million people in Bright Moon City, and there were countless grudges and disputes.

The bottom line of dragon Spike’s assassination mission was to assassinate a transcendent level 4 expert. If the other party was not at transcendent level 4, they would also charge a transcendent level 4 price.

There were close to 20 million people. There were more than 100 people who had hatred. It was highly possible for dragon spike to receive 400 to 500 missions.

The silence of the undercurrent and the sarcasm of dragon Spike made the prestige of dragon Spike’s assassin organization surpass that of the undercurrent assassin organization.

Today, the DRAKONIDS received a total of 112 missions.

When Wang Xian received the data, he was slightly stunned.

“As expected, the fastest way to earn money is to kill people!”

Wang Xian sighed slightly. For over a hundred missions in a day, the commission alone had reached more than one billion middle-grade spirit stones.

For about ten days in a row, it was more than ten billion middle-grade spirit stones. It might even be more.

After all, killing a person would cost at least 50,000 to 60,000 middle-grade spirit stones. For an extraordinary ninth-level powerhouse, it would cost 100 to 200 million middle-grade spirit stones.

More than 100 missions and a harvest of more than 1,000,000,000 spirit stones.

A faint smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face. After stabilizing Bright Moon City, he was prepared to send the dragon spike to other cities.

Within at least half a year, the dragon spike would cover the entire star-moon kingdom.

At that time, even the star-moon kingdom would have to be wary of the dragon spike. That was because by then, ao Yao would already be able to assassinate powerhouses at the insightful void tier.

As for those who were not at the insightful void tier, the strange demon would be able to kill them easily.

Perhaps, a single word from Wang Xian could topple the entire star-moon kingdom.

The establishment of the dragon spike was the wisest choice he had made when he came to the transcendence continent. If he were to rely on himself, it would be even harder than ascending to the heavens to earn so many spirit stones.

In the evening, the spy of the dragon Spike was still collecting the commission for the mission as usual.

Ao Yao was still watching the master of Undercurrent’s every move.

“Still not giving up?”

When Bangwan Dragon received ao Yao’s message, he slightly raised his eyebrows, and a trace of coldness appeared in his eyes.

He immediately sent the message to the spy, and after the spy received it, he immediately left.

“Your master of undercurrent really has the leisure and elegance, Hehe, how fun!”

The spy sent this message to the undercurrent assassin who was deliberately playing tricks. His tone was full of ridicule.

The assassin sent the message to the white-clothed old man. The white-clothed old man’s face turned black after seeing it.

“Let me see!”

At this moment, the master of undercurrent suddenly opened his mouth and said.

The white-clothed old man’s body stiffened. He completely did not want to let the Master of undercurrent see this message. He originally wanted to hide it, but...

Seeing the expression in the master of Undercurrent’s eyes, the white-clothed old man immediately felt a wave of fear.

“Yes, yes, it’s the leader!”

He handed over the communication stone plate and lowered his head, not daring to look at it.

He could see the master of undercurrent clenching his fists, but what he could not see was the crazy killing intent flashing in the master of Undercurrent’s eyes.

Humiliation, naked humiliation!

He had also seen on the Bright Moon City forum that countless people were ridiculing him, and now with this...

Just like many people’s replies, it was a slap in the face, a blatant slap in the face!

The expression of the master of undercurrent was extremely cold. He wanted to kill someone...

“Leader, we still have another way. There’s another way. We Don’t need to act. Let the city Lord’s manor continue to monitor the situation here. The dragon Spike definitely won’t be able to think of it!”

The white-clothed old man hurriedly said to the master of undercurrent.

The Master of undercurrent didn’t say anything. His body moved, and he directly disappeared on the spot.

The surrounding people looked over in astonishment, their faces filled with shock.

The white-clothed old man revealed an embarrassed expression as he slowly walked towards the undercurrent base.

...

“What our master of undercurrent needs, I, Liu Wen long, will naturally do my best to cooperate. Hehe, that dragon assassin organization has always been incomparably arrogant. They don’t put star-moon kingdom in their eyes. Even the king wants to exterminate such an organization!”

Within the city lord’s residence, City Lord Liu looked at the master of undercurrent who had suddenly appeared in front of him and replied with a smile on his face.

“I want you to use all your strength to dig out all the members of the Dragon Assassin Organization!”

The master of undercurrent did not hold back as he sat at the side and directly said to City Lord Liu.

“All your strength? That’s fine, but if you want to make a move, you still need to do it. You should also know the reason behind it!”

City Lord Liu hesitated for a moment before nodding.

“Alright, I want to know all the members of the dragon spike in Bright Moon City. I want to kill them one by one with my own hands!”

The Master of Undercurrent said in a low voice.

“Tomorrow, tomorrow we will send people to issue missions and dig out more spies. After that, we will find their higher-ups. We will pass all the information to the brothers of the Master of Undercurrent!”

City Lord Liu stood up and said directly.

“Alright, I’ll wait for Your News!”

The undercurrent master nodded coldly, and with a flash, he disappeared.

City Lord Liu looked at his disappearing figure, and a faint smile appeared on his face.

“Dragon Spike, you’re too arrogant. You assassinated the mayor of star-moon kingdom and provoked the city lord. Don’t you know that this is star-moon kingdom’s territory? !”

“This time, you guys actually fell in Bright Moon City, right? A bunch of arrogant beasts!”

City Lord Liu muttered, a cold glint flashing in his eyes.

A Day passed very quickly, and night represented slaughter.

In the entire Bright Moon City, unless one was an expert at the profound void tier, there was no one who could not be killed.

A night passed in the blink of an eye. Those who had slept for a night also woke up, but there was also a group of people who would never wake up!

In the past few days, it was a common practice to hear people exclaiming as they walked out of the room.

What family patriarch had been assassinated by the Dragon Assassin!

What mercenary group leader had been assassinated by the Dragon Assassin!

Who had died at the hands of the Dragon Assassin Group!

News quickly spread throughout bright moon city. In just three days, the reputation of the dragon assassin group had completely spread throughout bright moon city.

As for the undercurrent assassin organization, after two consecutive days of silence, they were already considered to be helpless against the dragon spike.

This made many people sigh with emotion. The once powerful undercurrent had been replaced by the dragon spike.

After three days of assassination by the dragon spike, not only did Bright Moon City not fall silent, but the atmosphere became even more heated.

For a large city with a population of nearly 20 million, the death of 200 people was just a drop in the bucket.

So many people were assassinated. Not only did it not calm people down, it made them even crazier.

“Dragon King, there are 50 more employers today than yesterday!”
