3448 The Archangel 3447 appeared! The Great Elf appeared!

“Dad, Dad, I’m awake. Dad, there’s a treasure ahead. Let’s Go get it.”

In the center of the river of eternity, where the water in the sky fell, Wang Xian looked ahead in shock.

Suddenly, a little elf flew out of his body and said cheerfully.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned. He looked at the little guy in astonishment.

“Lingling, you’re Awake?”

He revealed a smile.

Wang Lingling, who was also Wang Xian’s daughter, the accompanying Elf, had been hiding in her body ever since she entered the heaven-splitting primordial land.

Later on, after Wang Xian obtained lei yu and completely integrated the inceptive holy wings to increase his strength, the little fellow began to improve as well. She went into a deep sleep.

Following that, Wang Xian’s realm improved again. She followed suit and did not wake up.

The strength of the accompanying Elf would increase along with the strength of the host. After a few years of deep sleep, the supporting power of the spirit spirit was already at the level of the first-grade ruler of the universe.

The reason why she had been in a deep sleep for so long was mainly because Wang Xian’s strength had improved too quickly.

After all, the little fellow had the body of an elf. She wasn’t as perverse as Wang Xian with his nine attributes.

“I’m awake. My spirit has improved a lot this time. Look at my wings. Aren’t they beautiful?”

The spirit flew to his front and proudly flaunted her wings.

One had the Lightning attribute and the other had the wind attribute. They were exactly the same as Wang Xian’s primaless holy wings.

“Oh?”

When Wang Xian saw them, he raised his eyebrows slightly and stroked her head. “Beautiful, beautiful.”

The accompanying Elf grew up with the host and had the chance to inherit some of the host’s abilities.

Clearly, the little one had gained a lot of benefits from this upgrade.

“Dad, let’s go. Let’s go and grab some treasures. There are powerful treasures there.”

The spirit pointed to the location in front of them and said.

“There are treasures there, but there are also powerful space beasts there. We can’t go near them.”

Wang Xian shook his head.

“Space Beasts. Let’s kill them and eat them.”

Lingling bared her teeth and said.

“It’s already good enough that it won’t eat us.”

Wang Xian pinched her cheek speechlessly.

“But Lingling likes that treasure very much.”

Lingling pouted.

Wang Xian was slightly stunned. With a move of his palm, a ninth-grade water lotus appeared in front of Lingling.

“How about this?”

He said with a smile.

“This is also very good and very beautiful. Did Daddy Give It to me?”

Lingling said excitedly.

“Can you use it?”

Wang Xian looked at her in surprise.

“Yes, it grew on the mother of the ancestral tree. I can control it too.”

As Lingling spoke, she raised her small staff. The ninth-grade water lotus began to shrink and landed on the staff.

“Hehe, it’s so beautiful!”

When she saw it, she waved her staff happily and spun it happily.

“I still have the ninth-grade water lotus here. Do you want more?”

Wang Xian took out the other four water lotus flowers and floated in front of her.

“I want them, Lingling wants them. I want to wear them on my head, Hehe.”

Lingling waved the staff in her hand and the water lotuses shrunk and landed on her head. This caused Wang Xian’s eyes to be filled with astonishment.

The four water lotuses landed on her body. This could give her a considerable boost.

“The accompanying elves don’t seem to be that powerful, right? Could it be because of the ancestral tree?”

Wang Xian mumbled to himself. The Tree of life of the Elves was a treasure that was the closest to the Heaven’s origin level. However, it was still the same as the Heaven’s sting.

The accompanying elves nurtured by the ancestral tree were definitely not comparable to the ordinary accompanying elves in terms of potential and abilities.

For example, she was able to control four ninth-grade water lotuses now.

Even though the spirit spirits were all auxiliary means, they were still extremely terrifying.

With the five elements grinding technique and the spirit spirit, it wouldn’t be too much of a problem for him to deal with eight to nine people of the same level.

“I’m getting more and more awesome, Hehe!”

Wang Xian couldn’t help but laugh.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

At this moment, Wang Xian sensed that there were experts flying over from the surroundings.

He took a look and realized that it was a cave master from the Lotus Peak.

The figure flew over and noticed Wang Xian as well. He stopped and looked forward with a face full of shock.

“This is definitely the birth of a twelfth-grade water lotus!”

Very soon, his breathing became slightly rapid as he spoke. A sixth-grade water lotus appeared in his palm.

This energy was exactly the same!

Wang Xian took a look and stood there quietly without making any movements.

What a joke. A treasure of the twelfth grade water lotus was not something they could covet.

With the space behemoth there, unless there were powerhouses from the top races coming over, they would all die.

As time passed, more and more powerhouses rushed over.

They looked at the powerful energy in front of them in shock. Their eyes were filled with excitement.

However, no one dared to enter.

“If this energy is like this for a long period of time, there might really be experts from the top races of the universe coming over. After all, this is an innate treasure!”

Wang Xian thought to himself.

Time passed day by day. Three days later, the power of the 12th grade water lotus did not disappear.

Some people said that it would take more time for the birth of an innate treasure.

Many experts had already gathered at the center of the Heavenly Heng River, and even more experts had rushed over upon hearing the news.

On the universe’s AI, the situation here was also in an uproar, even overshadowing the topics of the ancestral dragon and the Holy Dragon lineage.

“Buzz Buzz Buzz!”

On the fourth day, everyone suddenly felt the sky suddenly brighten up, accompanied by a special rhythm.

The rhythm entered everyone’s ears. It was as if they were welcoming them, as if they were here!

This was the message brought by the rhythm.

“This is?”

Everyone’s expression changed slightly. They immediately flew towards the river.

Wang Xian moved without any hesitation.

When he arrived at the river, his gaze swept across his surroundings. His face was filled with shock.

An archangel with twelve wings was floating in the air. It was emitting a holy luster.

He stared at the spot below him without moving.

Wang Xian and the rest were far away from him, but he could still feel the terrifying energy contained in his body.

This was… an archangel of the angel race, the twelve-winged Angel!

“Dad, I can sense a familiar aura about to appear!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Lingling, who was sitting on Wang Xian’s shoulder, suddenly spoke.

“Huala!”

As soon as she finished her sentence, everyone saw that the starry sky seemed to have been torn apart.

A woman with a bow and arrow on her back, the leaves on her body condensed into clothes, and a perfect face appeared.

She looked at the twelve-winged angel not far away with a calm gaze.

When Wang Xian saw the figure that appeared again, his pupils constricted slightly.

This was… The Great Elf of the Elf race.

“This… This is a master of the universe, a true master of the universe. The twelve-winged angel, the Great Elf of the Arrow of life.”

From the surrounding area, a shocked voice rang out.
