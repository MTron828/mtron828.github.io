“In that case, you guys can die now!”

The instant Wang Xian completed his words, the surrounding seawater contracted at a terrifying speed.

“What?”

The group from the Devil Sealing Immortal Sect was stunned and fear could be seen on their faces.

“YOU... You went back on your word!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The middle-aged man in the middle was furious and roared loudly.

Wang Xian stared at them but didn’t say a word. The next instant, the surrounding seawater struck towards the group of fourteen.

“NO...”

They desperately thought of running but the seawater was like a swamp and emitted an insanely high temperature.

Argh!

Blood-curdling cries reverberated and Wang Xian stood by the side silently while watching them.

“Sigh. It looks like it will be an era of competition in the near future. Even if the era might not be chaotic, the world won’t be as peaceful as before!”

Wang Xian looked at their corpses and heaved a long sigh.

High and mighty as though they were immortals looking down on the entire world.

This was the attitude that was displayed by the people from the Nine Cauldron Worlds and the exemplification of the pride and arrogance from their core.

In their worlds, they wouldn’t have to follow laws and regulations. Everything was dictated by strength.

When facing people from other Nine Cauldron Worlds, these people might be a little more courteous. However, if they were facing people from the real world, they would definitely have a sense of superiority.

Take these dozen-odd people as an example. Despite facing experts of the same realm, they still acted haughtily.

It was as though they thought they were immortals from the heavens looking down on the mortals.

This mentality would definitely be a huge blow to all people living in the real world. In fact, for most people living in the real world, the descent of the Nine Cauldron Worlds might not be a great thing.

As he was the strongest expert and leader of the most powerful Dragon Sect in the Underworld, there might be people thinking of subduing him to display their might and strength when the Nine Cauldron Worlds descended.

Some might even kill him to lift their standing and reputation!

“If you dare to look down on me and take a high stand, I’ll bury you three inches below ground!”

A light flickered across Wang Xian’s eyes as he glanced across the corpses. He waved his arm and several screens of Water Veil surrounded these corpses.

In an instant, those corpses had turned into a ball of blood-red essence with immense energy.

However, such energy was incomparably violent and hard to digest.

Wang Xian threw it towards the merman. The merman lifted its head and stared at him without any traces of emotions. Those were eyes that belonged to a wild beast.

Wang Xian turned around and looked at the members from the various Wandering Groups.

Under his supervision, the surrounding four to five thousand members of the various Wandering Groups could feel perspiration covering their foreheads as fear gripped them tightly.

They were now awaiting Wang Xian’s judgement.

“Kill them!”

Wang Xian wasn’t going to be compassionate to them at all.

The hands of this group of people had all been tainted with fresh blood. Recalling his encounter with the Century Ghost previously, Wang Xian did not have the slightest good impression of them.

If he didn’t require manpower, Wang Xian wouldn’t have considered accepting Wandering Groups from the disordered region as his subordinates.

“Dragon King, I would suggest using them for breeding pure blood corals. With so many of them, we should be able to breed a large number of pure blood corals!” the leader of Devil Kid suggested to Wang Xian.

“Alright, deal with them as you suggest!”

Wang Xian nodded his head plainly and looked across the newly accepted dragonians,

Evildoers!

This group of people could be considered as those who had committed the most heinous crimes. After consuming the essence blood, they would follow his instructions to the fullest.

They would also see Wang Xian as the absolute ruler.

However, their initial beliefs and way of doing things wouldn’t change.

Mo Qinglong and the dragonians previously weren’t great people. However, when compared to the group of people before him, Mo Qinglong and the dragonians previously were definitely kind.

“Using evildoers would be like using a cursed sword. I should be able to use them to slay other evildoers!”

Wang Xian chuckled and wasn’t too concerned about their past actions.

With him around, this group of people wouldn’t be able to come up with tricks.

“Leader! No... No... Don’t...!”

Around them, the crowd of members from the various Wandering Groups begged for mercy from their leaders.

“Hehe! You guys should be grateful that your death will bring some value to the Dragon King! It’s totally worth it!”

One of the leaders of the Wandering Groups grinned as bloodlust could be seen from his face.

Members of the Wandering Groups weren’t bonded by blood whatsoever. Even without Wang Xian, they wouldn’t feel any sorrow if their subordinates died.

“Old Mo, tell me about the situation of Xia Cauldron world. When I’m not around in the future, I’ll leave this group of people under your supervision!”

Wang Xian looked across them before instructing Mo Qinglong.

“Yes, Dragon King!”

Mo Qinglong nodded his head and continued, “Dragon King, the Xia Cauldron is located at the Ping Chuan Mountain Range and spans approximately a thousand miles. There are two Immortal Sects in the Xia Cauldron World...”

Rumble!

Suddenly, the entire island shook violently. From several tens of kilometers away, a terrifying aura shrouded over.

Flashes of gold and black light appeared across the sky, making the entire disordered region seem to be in the center of an apocalypse!

“Shit! Dragon King, the Manta Ray King of the disordered region is currently fighting with another terrifying existence!”

Seeing the terrifying scene from afar, the leader of Devil Kid was filled with horror as he spoke to Wang Xian.

“King?”

Wang Xian turned around instantly and his expression turned solemn as he looked into the distance.

“Manta Ray King is an Immortal-class creature. It is the strongest existence in the entire disordered region. In the past, I offended an Immortal and he chased me to this place. In the end, he incurred the fury of that terrifying Manta Ray King!”

“It has a body that is over thirty meters long. Its pitch-black body is covered in terrifying-looking scales. At that time, that Immortal escaped in a hurry after exchanging a dozen moves with the Manta Ray King.

“It can fly in the sky and swim underwater. When it emerges from the seas, the devilish aura masks the sky and no light can reach the area within a radius of several dozens of miles around it,” old dwarf man explained to Wang Xian while looking flabbergasted.

“It is also because there is an Immortal-class creature in the disordered region that deterred many elite experts from various denominations from entering. If we had the choice, we wouldn’t want to be here either!” an old man said, looking into the distance.

“The Manta Ray King is the true Lord of the disordered region!” the leader of Devil Kid explained.

“You guys shall stay here while I go take a look!”

Feeling the intensity of the battle in that direction, Wang Xian moved towards it at an incredible speed.

“Be careful, Dragon King!” the newly joined dragonians reminded.

“Just relax!” Mo Qinglong looked at them and commented plainly.

The one fighting with the Manta Ray King was Roving Sword. If there was an Immortal-class creature in this place, there should be many Budding Realm-class Manta Ray.

Roving Heavens and the remaining Dragon Palace members have likely run into some trouble!

Wang Xian squinted his eyes and a red and blue light flickered.

He dived into the water and executed Instant Shift immediately.

Boom!

At this moment, a terrifying figure emerged from the sea. It was entirely black and was over thirty meters long. It resembled the terrifying creatures that only existed in ancient times.

When it emerged from the seas, the color of the sky changed and the area within a radius of twenty to thirty miles was shrouded in the devilish aura.

This is what is truly meant by covering the skies with devilish aura!

Dang dang dang!

Suddenly, a blinding golden light emerged from the seas. The golden light transformed into a sword and split the devilish aura that covered the entire sky!
