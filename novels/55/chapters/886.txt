“You still dare to resist?”

The moment Wang Xian launched his attack, the faces of Zhao Zhixiong and the rest darkened instantly.

He immediately raised the staff in his hand, and a blazing fireball instantly lit up the surroundings.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

However, the moment the flames on his staff rose, terrifying thorns rose up from the ground in the entire space and attacked the dozen of them.

“What? Be careful!”

“He’s very strong!”

Zhao Zhixiong’s companions and the other group of people beside him quickly warned him.

However, it was useless!

The terrifying thorns drilled out from the rocks and surrounded them.

“Fiery explosion!”

Zhao Zhixiong’s expression changed slightly. The fireball in his hand emitted a hot light and exploded in the sky.

It directly exploded the layers of thorns.

However, there were too many thorns and seaweed, and it directly covered all of them. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

The hurried sound seemed to be whipping the surrounding air. Countless thorns and seaweed weaved into a death domain.

“Ah!”

A young man’s body was directly pierced through by the thorns, and he let out a miserable cry.

Even one of the Earth element cultivators was pierced through by the sea grass and killed.

The sea grass was twitching slowly. The hardness of the sea grass was beyond their imagination.

“He is definitely not at the second level of transcendence!”

Zhao Zhixiong looked at the sea grass that was surrounding him and shouted in fear.

“Whoosh!”

However, just as he finished his sentence, a hard wooden thorn emerged from his back and pierced through his body.

Brutal Slaughter!

There were a total of two teams. Twelve people at level two of transcendence wanted to surround and kill Wang Xian, but they were instantly killed.

This was definitely not something that level two of transcendence could do.

“What?”

When Ao Xue, Qing Feng, and bei Ming saw the screams coming from this side, they widened their eyes in disbelief.

“At least level three of transcendence!”

The expressions of those who were watching from the side changed drastically. They stared at Wang Xian in shock with their eyes wide open.

The seaweed and thorns were withdrawn quickly, leaving behind more than a dozen corpses.

“A bunch of trash!”

Wang Xian glanced at them with disdain. He turned his head and looked at Ao Xue, bei Ming and the rest slowly. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

“Run!”

Bei Ming’s eyes were about to split open. His eyes were filled with horror as he roared loudly. He slashed forward heavily and escaped into the distance.

“You want to escape? Have you asked us?”

The eight Drakonids let out a beast roar and their arms exploded one by one. They transformed into terrifying dragon claws and attacked ao Xue and the rest.

“Scram!”

This made Ao Xue, bei Ming, and Qing Feng extremely embarrassed. They let out a loud roar!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

However, at this moment, the seaweed around them started to move crazily and covered them directly.

“Wood, Thorn Thorns!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and earth thorns drilled out from the ground.

The thorn thorns were like terrifying tree demons as they darted towards them.

“Get lost!”

Ao Xue widened her eyes. Her eyes were bloodshot. She slashed the longsword in her hand and tens of thousands of metallic lights filled the entire space.

The Thorns in the sky were instantly cut off.

“Pa Pa Pa Pa!”

However, at this moment, under the cover of her feet, numerous thorns were directly tied to her legs, quickly wrapping around her.

“Ah, you dare? If you dare to kill me, my father will not let you off!”

“Save us, quick, save us. In the future, we will pay a huge sum of money to thank you!”

Bei Ming was also entangled by the violent brambles. He shouted out loud with a terrified expression.

The expressions of the people who were watching changed slightly. They looked at Ao Xue and the rest who were being suppressed and pursed their lips.

“Brother, Ao Xue’s father is the daughter of the deputy leader of the Golden one-star horned shark mercenary group. Bei Ming is the young master of the Bei family of Shenghai Town. Qingfeng’s father is an extraordinary level five powerhouse. You’d better...”

“Puchi!”

Beside him, a four-man team. The young man standing at the front frowned and warned Wang Xian.

However, before he could finish his sentence, his head rolled on the ground.

A flash of light flashed by.

“Speak after you’ve thought it through!”

Wang Xian turned his head and glanced at the corpse on the ground coldly.

Everyone was shocked and hurriedly retreated.

They were afraid of being killed directly!

Those young men who relied on their own strength and acted alone had a slight change in expression. Their pupils couldn’t help but shrink.

They actually didn’t discover how the other party died just now.

“Ahhhhh!”

On the other side, miserable screams could be heard. Within ao Xue’s team, the six young men were killed one after another.

Ao Xue, Bei Ming, and Qing Feng were tied up by thorns. Their bodies were covered in bloody scars.

Their faces were filled with fear.

“So this is the genius of Shenghai Town? You Want to kill me?”

Wang Xian stared at the three people who were trapped by the thorns, and a mocking expression appeared on his face.

“You... you... Please, don’t Kill Us!”

Ao Xue’s face was ghastly pale, and her body was trembling. “I’ll do whatever you want me to do. Please don’t kill me!”

“You brought this upon yourself. How dare a genius like you talk about Killing Me!”

Wang Xian snorted coldly and clenched his fist slightly.

“Ah!”

The thorny vines contracted and screams of pain could be heard.

“He... he actually dared to kill Ao Xue and the other two...”

“Hiss, aren’t they afraid of the revenge of the horned shark mercenary group and the Bei Family?”

The expressions of the people around them changed drastically as they looked at Wang Xian and the rest with fear.

Ao Xue and the rest were almost 100% able to enter the demon Hunters Academy. However, they did not expect to be killed directly.

Furthermore, the other party was so unscrupulous.

“Put away their corpses!”

Wang Xian said coldly to the group of DRAKONIDS.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

They put away the corpses one by one and looked at the items in their interspatial rings.

“Scram!”

Wang Xian glanced at the people around him and shouted softly.

Everyone’s expression changed slightly as they walked out hurriedly.

“Dragon King, we have already killed more than 30 piranhas. There were a total of 50 piranhas in the interspatial rings of those people just now!”

A drakonid walked over and said to Wang Xian.

“All of you can take it.”

Wang Xian nodded and sat beside the bonfire.

At this moment, the news of Ao Xue, Bei Ming, and Qing feng being killed spread rapidly on the mermaid island.

When the other examinees heard the news, their faces were filled with shock.

They were actually killed by someone!

Their team’s strength was definitely one of the best in the entire assessment team. They didn’t expect to be killed directly.

Furthermore, they were killed by a group of youths wearing bronze 1-star mercenary groups.

That 1-star bronze mercenary group was not to be trifled with.

After encountering them, they had to escape immediately.

They even dared to kill Ao Xue and the others, who had a deep background. A youth who wanted to threaten them was even beheaded.

Such a vicious person was not someone they could provoke!
