Chapter 1089: 1090 abandoned the city and left

Translator: 5496903

“Attack! Attack!”

“There are millions of our own kind behind us. Behind Us is our home. Our parents and children, Attack! We must not let them rush in!”

Hoarse shouts rang out from the city walls at the east gate. Below them, there was no one outside.

Because they could not defend the city, it was suicidal for them to stay outside at this time.

The size of the ferocious beast was completely beyond the expectations of everyone in holy sea town, and it was also beyond the expectations of the ocean cultivator corps.

The bone scarabs that attacked the city at the beginning were very powerful, but they were all killed by the ocean cultivator corps, the people from the three academies, and the mercenary corps that came to holy sea town to carry out their mission.

However, what they didn’t expect was that the second wave of beasts arrived one after another.

The wandering sea monsters had six legs, a long pointed head, and a long tail. There was a long sharp thorn at the end of the tail, and each of them was extremely powerful.

When the wandering sea monsters appeared, everyone at the East Gate had solemn expressions on their faces.

However, when they hadn’t been fighting for long, terrifying blood savage beasts suddenly appeared.

More than 30 extremely powerful blood savage beasts instantly defeated all the people guarding the East Gate.

Even vice commander Meng immediately ordered all the soldiers to return to the city wall.

“Reporting to general, reporting to City Lord Lei, five half-step void interpretation level blood savage beasts have appeared outside of holy sea town, and close to 30 rank eight or rank nine extraordinary blood savage beasts. With our strength, we can’t withstand them at all. We need to send out void interpretation level experts. Please give US instructions, General!”

On the city wall, deputy commander Meng kept on contacting with the communication stone plate.

“What are the chances of void interpretation level beasts appearing?”

Not long after, deputy commander Meng received a reply from City Lord Lei on the communication stone plate.

“It is impossible to predict whether there are void interpretation level blood savage beasts behind us. The Blood Savage Beast race controls too many fierce beasts. According to Holy Sea town’s current defense, they can at most resist for another 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, holy sea town’s array formation will be broken!”

Deputy Commander Meng took a deep breath and quickly said.

“Is the guy who killed Xiao Wen still there?”

At this time, deputy commander Meng suddenly received a reply from his superior, the general.

Deputy Commander Meng was slightly silent when he saw this message. In the eyes of the experts, the lives of millions of people in a town were not even worth his son’s life.

“They should have escaped!”

Deputy commander Meng replied directly, “In addition, general, the blood barbaric demon beasts attacked the city with a large number of ferocious beasts. The four city gates were all guarded by ferocious beasts. They wanted to kill everyone in Holy Sea Town and suck the blood of everyone to improve their strength. The weak would have a hard time escaping!”

“If it was too late, the wind riding squad might have been left here!”

A middle-aged man in the military camp of East Sea city was silent with a dark face. Three Corpses were lying in front of him.

Blood had already covered the ground, making the room extremely bloody. The middle-aged man drank a glass of wine. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Did you run away?”

“No matter where you run to, I will not let you go if you dare to kill my son!”

The middle-aged man’s eyes were extremely indifferent. He looked at the communication stone plate in front of him and replied, “If any void interpretation demon beasts appear, abandon Holy Sea Town!”

“Void interpretation demonic beasts are still unknown!”

Vice Commander Meng saw the general’s message and immediately replied.

“There’s no time. Give up holy sea town. You’re back. There are five half-step void interpretation demonic beasts there. There might be void interpretation demonic beasts. The kingdom will let you give up!”

However, at this moment, City Lord Lei’s message was transmitted over.

Vice Regiment Commander Meng was slightly stunned when he saw it. Then, he slowly nodded his head.

He looked forward. More than thirty terrifying blood savage demon beasts stood in the void as if they were the rulers of the world.

Behind them, there might be void interpretation level demon beasts.

At this time, even if they sent void interpretation level demon beasts over, it would be too late. Holy Sea town would also be destroyed.

However, if an insightful emptiness realm expert came, there would be an insightful emptiness realm expert hiding among the demonic beasts. Instead, it would pose a certain threat to the insightful emptiness realm expert.

One could not risk the lives of an insightful emptiness realm expert just because Saint Sea Town was 100% destroyed!

“However, if an insightful emptiness realm expert came over, at least one million people would be saved!”

Vice Commander Meng sighed slightly.

However, he could only sigh. Even if a void interpretation expert were to save a million people, where would these million refugees be placed?

If they were all placed in eastern sea city, it would undoubtedly create a burden on eastern sea city and disrupt the peace and order of Eastern Sea City.

Therefore... City Lord Lei and the kingdom’s upper echelons tacitly acknowledged the deaths of this group of people.

There were many cities in the transcendental continent that had been breached. They didn’t pay too much attention to a single town.

“Let’s go, wind riding squad, follow me. Return to East Sea city immediately!”

When vice commander Meng saw the message, he looked at the beast that was about to reach the bottom of the city wall and said in a deep voice.

“Yes!”

The members of the wind riding squad were stunned for a moment, then immediately nodded.

“Let’s Go!”

Under the shocked gazes of everyone on the city wall, everyone from the ocean cultivator corps flew directly in the direction of East Sea city.

Abandon the city and flee!

“This...”

“Vice commander Meng!”

“Vice commander Meng, what are you trying to do...”

The three academies and everyone on the city wall widened their eyes and shouted in panic.

However, the ocean cultivator corps didn’t reply. They sped toward East Sea city as fast as they could.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

At this moment, the instructors of the three academies all received a message from the academies.

“Saint Sea Town abandoned guard, come back immediately!”

Saint Sea Town abandoned guard, come back immediately!

These nine words caused the teachers of the three academies to be slightly shocked.

“Call all the academies, go back immediately, go back to East Sea City!”

The teachers quickly reacted and loudly said to all the academies.

“What?”

At this moment, everyone on the east gate city wall who was shocked understood.

The Army of ocean cultivators had received the order to flee. They had abandoned the city and fled!

The people from the three great academies also received the order to immediately flee to East Sea city.

Everyone was stupefied. East Sea city was going to abandon them. The entire star-moon kingdom was going to abandon them!

Facing the hundreds of thousands of ferocious beasts and the terrifying demonic beasts ahead, they would face the consequences of the destruction of the city and their lives.

“Let’s go, let’s go. The Ocean Corps directly escaped. The three academies also escaped. It’s over. Our holy sea town is finished!”

“It’s over, it’s over. Our holy sea town is completely finished. I don’t want to die. What should we do? What should we do!”

“We should also escape. We should also escape. Quick, Quick!”

Everyone panicked at the east gate. The Ocean Corps and the three academies were the main forces guarding the east gate.

Now that they had escaped, it meant that holy sea town had been abandoned.

It meant that they were dead!
