Chapter 3034: 3033 battle! Go

“It’s a total war!”

“This is the Red Mist clan’s founding day of Celestial Emperor Hong Tian. A battle has actually erupted.”

“Perhaps even celestial emperor Hong Tian did not expect such a situation. He did not expect the Dragon Palace to actually be Ming Xuanzhi’s benefactor. He also did not expect the Dragon Palace to actually let Ming Xuanzhi attack directly.”

“Quick, quick, this is a battle between peak-stage Celestial Emperor Magi. Let’s immediately hide far away!”

When the battle erupted, the various races immediately retreated to the rear.

A peak-stage divine Emperor Magus, this battle was enough to destroy the world.

“Ahhhhh!”

As their races and races retreated, screams came from the rear.

The demonic fiend that had turned into a poisonous horned dragon, its entire body pitch-black like black liquid, had already started slaughtering the red fog race disciples.

Those who occupied the two rows at the back were all red fog clan’s disciples below the divine emperor level.

Originally, the Red Fog clan had used it to display their foundations and had arranged all the disciples into two rows to act as a show.

In the end, they were attacked by the demonic fiend at the first instance.

The divine emperor level eight had slaughtered disciples below the divine emperor level, and it was under a sudden attack.

The group of disciples did not even have the time to react. In an instant, they swept across and killed tens of thousands of red fog clan’s disciples.

Not a single one was left alive!

All of them were the grand-disciples of God Emperor Hong Tian, the future elites and core disciples of the red fog race.

The red fog race had just been established and did not have much population to begin with. All of the elite core disciples were his disciples’disciples.

Now, 80% of them had been wiped out.

“Bastard, you’re courting death!”

In front of them, when the red fog race’s god Emperors saw mo sha slaughtering their disciples, their eyes revealed a blood-red color as they instantly attacked Mo Sha.

“Jie Jie Jie, kill!”

Ba Qi let out a strange cry. His body moved and locked onto the god Emperors in front of him as he charged forward.

His target was those experts below the god Emperor Rank 8.

“Stop him!”

“Everyone, take action and trap them!”

The red fog race’s three God Emperor Rank 9 magi, as well as the god Emperor Rank 9 explosive mountain giant, had a huge change in expression. They immediately roared loudly.

The power of the formation gathered in the void and a terrifying power was formed instantly.

“Die!”

When Wang Xian saw them setting up the formation, a cold expression appeared in his eyes. He pushed his speed to the limit.

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

In an instant, the hundreds of celestial thearchs of the red fog race on the left were instantly killed.

“Old Man Ming, die! Do you really think that I, Hong Tian, am still the same Hong Tian from tens of millions of years ago?”

In the sky, God Emperor Hong Tian heard the screams from below. When he saw the disciples of the red fog race being killed, his heart sank and he shouted sternly.

“Origin magnetic light ring, calamity of bloody light!”

He waved his arm and waves of energy poured into the origin magnetic light ring above his head. Red beams of light shot towards Ming Xuanzhi.

“Hahaha, I was able to suppress you back then, and I’m doing the same now!”

Ming Xuanzhi laughed out loud. His body moved and flew directly towards the group of experts from the red fog race. His body was enveloped by a black shadow.

As he flew, he quickly waved his arm and set up numerous formations.

“Taste the Dark Sky King’s shadow of our Tianming Race!”

Ming Xuanzhi roared loudly. Very soon, an incomparably huge black shadow appeared in front of him. His figure directly attacked the red pillar.

“Damn it, all the experts of the red fog race have retreated from our battlefield!”

God Emperor Hong Tian’s expression was extremely unsightly when he saw Ming xuanzhi surrounding his subordinates.

His subordinates were all around him, and this made him unable to let go.

However, Ming Xuanzhi did not have any scruples. He waved his energy, and a few of the weaker disciples around him were directly affected, instantly dying.

“Quick, quick, Quick!”

The red fog race’s powerhouses fled in fear.

Among them, a few rank 9 celestial thearch-level powerhouses of the red fog race were also horrified. They quickly dodged to the side.

They were far away from the battlefield between celestial thearch-level Hong Tian and Ming Xuanzhi.

“Die!”

When Wang Xian saw the chaos in the red fog race, he narrowed his eyes slightly. His eyes were filled with killing intent.

“Whoosh!”

He pushed his speed to the maximum and locked his gaze on the few rank 8 celestial thearch Magi of the red fog race.

“Not good. The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is attacking us. Attack him!”

“Defend and Dodge!”

The expressions of the few rank 8 celestial thearch Magi of the red fog race changed drastically. They immediately roared loudly. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Die!”

Wang Xian didn’t even need to use his supernatural ability to kill a rank 8 celestial thearch.

His arm suddenly transformed into a terrifying dragon claw. The Dragon Claw that was a few thousand meters long swept out and grabbed the three level eight celestial thearch powerhouses in his hand.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

The destructive force immediately caused the life force of the three level eight celestial thearch powerhouses to disappear.

“Surround and attack him!”

“All level nine celestial thearch powerhouses surround and attack him!”

When the four level nine celestial thearch powerhouses of the Red Fog clan saw this, their expressions changed drastically. They immediately roared loudly.

Whoosh

However, Wang Xian did not fight them head-on. He flapped his wings and flew to the side to hunt down the weaker celestial thearch powerhouses around him.

“Ahhhh!”

“Not good. First Elder, save us!”

The Wizards who were getting close to them did not have the strength to resist at all. They roared with fear on their faces.

A few of them flashed and wanted to escape immediately.

“Dragon Eyes Lock on all corners!”

Wang Xian’s dragon eyes flashed with a luster. Strands of chains appeared in front of them in an instant.

Their illusory bodies were pulled out instantly and the chains penetrated through them.

“No!”

A terrified voice came from their mouths.

“Kill him, kill him!”

When the four divine emperors of the red fog race saw this scene, their faces were gloomy as they roared furiously.

Whoosh

Wang Xian didn’t hesitate at all. He relied on his powerful speed to fly straight towards the first test and locked onto a group of people.

“Run, run, run!”

“It’s this demon, it’s this demon!”

The expressions of the three-eyed race members who were locked onto changed drastically. The three-eyed race leader’s heart was trembling violently as he shouted in fear.

Previously, this fellow had killed all the elite powerhouses of the two races. Now, they were actually being hunted by this demon again.

This made the three-eyed tribe leader feel suffocated and hopeless.

They had already joined the Red Mist tribe and a wizard at the peak of the celestial thearch level.

“A bunch of people who are seeking death. Die!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with killing intent when he saw the three-eyed tribe. He swiped his dragon claw at them.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

The Dragon Claw that was filled with destructive power swept past. The five to six hundred celestial thearchs of the three-eyed tribe were instantly covered.

“No! Don’t kill me!”

A desperate voice rang out, but it quickly came to an abrupt end.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

At this moment, a giant whose body was at least a thousand meters long and whose entire body was like a giant rock let out a roar and charged toward Wang Xian.

The Explosive Mountain Giant!

“HMPH!”

Wang Xian snorted coldly. When he saw the huge explosive mountain giant, he flapped his wings and easily evaded his attack. Then, he flew toward the first test again.

Those were the war pets of the Red Mist tribe.

If he couldn’t kill anyone, he would kill his war pets!
