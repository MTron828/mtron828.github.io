Chapter 1640: 1640 was a foregone conclusion

In the ruins of the divine kingdom!

The ruins of the divine kingdom today were completely different from before.

In the sky above the ruins of the divine kingdom, tens of thousands of experts stood neatly in the air.

They held weapons in their hands and stared coldly towards the east.

Almost all the experts from the three superpowers had gathered together.

Leading them were five elders.

Everyone in the divine kingdom ruins below recognized the identities of these five elders at a glance.

These five were the strongest experts in the vast region in the past. They held great power and could shake the entire region with a stomp of their feet.

However, today, they stood in the void expressionlessly as they stared ahead.

Clearly, they were waiting for someone.

In the past, it would have been impossible for these five to stand in the air and wait for someone.

But now, they had already waited for half an hour.

They still did not feel the slightest bit of impatience!

“The three great superpowers have completely bowed their heads this time!”

“There’s no other way. The Sky Demon is still alive, and it’s said that one person can fight against three or four rank nine profound void martial experts. This invincible stance, which power can withstand it?”? “Now, the three super factions have to join forces to not be destroyed!”

“Sky Demon, ever since it appeared, it has shocked the entire vast region. Now, it has already surpassed everyone in the vast region!”

Below, everyone in the divine kingdom ruins raised their heads to look at the three super factions in the sky.

The super factions that were once glorious and could make ten billion people grovel with a single sentence had now completely declined.

All of this was because of the Sky Demon.

“Wu Wu!”

At this moment, a whistling sound rang out. It was a unique sound that attracted everyone’s attention.

“They’re here!”

“The Savage Goddess’Giant Beast, Sky Demon and the others are here!”

When they heard this sound, everyone’s gaze froze as they hurriedly looked towards the east.

A giant figure quickly appeared in everyone’s line of sight.

At the front of the huge beast stood three figures.

The youth in the lead was like a starlight that was emitting light. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“The sky demon is indeed not dead!”

“Priest Wang is not dead. Back at the cult of self-reliance, priest Wang fought with the cult of self-reliance because he saw the cult of self-reliance kill 100,000 people because of him!”

“Others say that priest Wang is a sky demon, but back in the ruins of the divine kingdom, priest Wang was famous for his benevolence and benevolence, the saint of Light!”

“In terms of style, priest Wang is much more benevolent than the three super powers!”

Whispers rang out from the ruins of the divine kingdom. Many people in the ruins of the divine kingdom knew Wang Xian very well.

The former priest of light, priest Wang, had a great reputation.

However, what everyone did not expect was that priest Wang was a sky demon.

“Haha, My Sect, the southern royal family, and the Wuji Empire have kept you waiting for a long time!”

Wang Xian stood on Xiao Lan and laughed out loud when he saw the three superpowers who were already waiting for him.

“We didn’t wait for long either!”

Patriarch dark eye looked at Wang Xian and said faintly.

“Cut the crap. If you want to make peace with us, you will have to pay a price. Show us your sincerity!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across all of them and said coldly.

His words made the five patriarchs’expressions turn ugly instantly.

“Sky Demon, even if the three of US join forces, we might not be afraid of You!”

The supreme headmaster clenched his arms tightly. His eyes were filled with fury.

“Don’t talk about those useless things. Aren’t you afraid of why we want peace?”

Feng Luan looked at the supreme sect leader with some mockery. She didn’t give him any face at all.

“According to the requirements of Your Dragon and Phoenix Empire, half of the territory in the vast area belongs to you. Furthermore, this is the rest of the items that we have taken out!”

Nanhuang Jianghe immediately took over and threw a piece of paper at Wang Xian and the rest.

The name of various items and resources was written on it.

“In the vast area, we want to be close to the barren sea and the area near the north flowing sea. There are a total of 5,100 cities!”

“In terms of items, we want all the Life Stones, life and Death Pill Workshop and holy item forging workshop of the Solitaire sect to give all the resources of the Wuji Empire to you!”

“Don’t think about hiding it. We know how many items they have given you to invite you to take action!”

“In addition, we want the inferno flowers in the domain of the southern royal family. We want 10,000 of them and 1,000 of them above the void interpretation realm!”

Feng Luan took the paper and looked at the conditions on it.

“What?”

The faces of the five patriarchs changed drastically. They stared at Feng Luan with a gloomy face.

“Either you three superpowers join forces to fight against us, or you agree to this condition!”

Wang Xian stared at the five grandmasters of the three superpowers with a strong expression and said arrogantly.

The atmosphere gradually turned solemn. All the experts of the three superpowers gripped their weapons nervously.

If they didn’t come to an agreement today, a war might ensue.

“Don’t Make Us Wait!”

The leaders of the Dragon Palace stared at the three superpowers wantonly. They were exuding a strong sense of confidence.

The members of the Dragon Palace weren’t afraid of war or anyone else.

A powerful aura charged at them without any hesitation.

This made all the experts of the three superpowers change their expressions.

They had seen how terrifying the members of the Dragon Palace were.

“Okay, we agree!”

The five patriarchs looked at each other, gritted their teeth, and nodded.

“A wise man submits to circumstances. Clan leader he, clan leader he sui, I’ll have to trouble all of you for the transfer of resources!”

A faint smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face as he spoke to the He clan and he Sui clan leaders behind him.

“Alright!”

The clan leaders of the two clans nodded with a smile.

“Hiss, just like that, the division of the powers in the entire vast area has been decided!”

“In the future, the dragon-phoenix Empire will occupy half of this vast region. The Sky in this vast region will completely change!”

“There will only be four super powers in this vast region. The other powers will have to rely on them!”

“I reckon that the three super powers will form an alliance in the future. Otherwise, the dragon-phoenix Empire will destroy them sooner or later!”

“The He clan and he Sui clan have obtained a huge opportunity this time!”

Below, when everyone in the divine kingdom ruins saw how a few words had determined the entire situation of the vast region, shock appeared on their faces.

After this, the entire vast region would enter a new situation.

In the future, when the two superpowers combined, there would be endless battles.

“Let’s go. I hope everyone can give me some pointers in the vast region in the future. Haha!”

Wang Xian laughed maniacally. His face was filled with a domineering aura.

“Welcome, members of the Dragon Palace, to join our dragon and Phoenix Empire.”

Feng Luan also smiled and said softly.

“Woo Woo!”
