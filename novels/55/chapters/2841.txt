2842 2842 ordinary cultivators from ordinary forces: Wang Xian

“Hey, What’s Your Name? Where are you from?”

In the pavilion in front of the lake, the little junior sister was sitting in front of the table in a very friendly manner. She asked Wang Xian with a smile on her face.

“Wang Xian, from the Emperor Star Field.”

Wang Xian glanced at the three of them and said with a smile on his face.

He twirled the holy feather in his palm to pass the time when he was bored.

“Wow, the Emperor Star Field is so far away? How did you come from so far away? Are you here by yourself?”

The little junior sister asked curiously.

“The Emperor Star Field?”

The middle-aged man beside her, the fifth senior brother of the little junior sister, also revealed a surprised expression.

“The Emperor Star Field has a new king now. I heard that the Dragon Palace is extremely powerful. They fought against the imperial court and the Wizard Association single-handedly. Their battle was earth-shattering and they are now ranked third among all the forces in the resplendent starry sky.”

“Is the Dragon Palace really that powerful?”

Fifth senior brother looked at Wang Xian and asked curiously.

“This… is very powerful!”

Wang Xian nodded his head awkwardly when he heard someone praising the dragon palace and their battle shocked the world.

“Huh? What Dragon Palace? Fifth senior brother, why haven’t I heard of it before?”

Little Junior sister was slightly curious when she heard her senior brother’s words.

“Little junior sister, if you have nothing to do, pay more attention to the general situation of the world. The Dragon Palace rose up five years ago and became famous in the Emperor Star Field. Have you heard of the sky formation divine emperor who swept through the entire world before? He didn’t die. Now, he has joined the Dragon Palace.”

“The Dragon Palace single-handedly fought against the imperial court and the Wizard Association without falling into a disadvantageous position. In fact, they even defeated them. Now, they have occupied the entire Emperor Star Field. To think that our holy region is adjacent to the Emperor Star Field. They don’t even know about such a big matter.”

Fifth Senior Brother lectured her.

“I’ve been cultivating seriously for the past five years. I don’t pay attention to these things.”

The Little Junior sister curled her lips and said unhappily.

“Hehe, you’re the only one who’s still cultivating seriously?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Fifth senior brother shook his head helplessly.

However, he didn’t say anything. The rise of the Dragon Palace was too short. Only some people who paid attention to it and some experts from other forces knew about it.

It was just like how things in the Holy Region were not known by the artificial intelligence system. It couldn’t be used to communicate with the people of the Holy Region.

The two sides were not on the same channel.

Secondly, the time of five years was really short. Some god-level masters went into seclusion once for eight to ten years. It was normal for a god-king to go into seclusion once for hundreds or thousands of years.

“Oh right, didn’t we see people from the imperial court here when we came? Are you a disciple of the imperial court?”

The little junior sister suddenly stared at Wang Xian with her eyes wide open.

“No, I’m just an ordinary cultivator from an ordinary force.”

Wang Xian shook his head and pretended to be cool.

An ordinary force?

An ordinary family?

A small goal of 100 million yuan?

He didn’t know how beautiful his wife was?

Cough cough…

“Oh, Hehe. I haven’t introduced myself after saying so much. My Name Is Ye Lui Ying. This is my sixth senior sister and fifth senior brother…”

“Fifth brother, sixth brother, and seventh brother!”

Before ye Lui Ying could finish her sentence, a faint voice sounded.

“Ah!”

Ye lui Ying exclaimed and stood up immediately. The other two also stood up and turned around immediately.

“Greetings, Master!”

Dressed in green clothes, she had a noble and graceful temperament and a perfect figure.

“Get Ready. We will head to the windless forest immediately.”

The woman looked at her three disciples and said faintly.

“AH, master, so soon?”

“Alright, Alright!”

Ye Lui Ying opened her mouth slightly and asked in surprise. However, she quickly nodded and replied in the next moment.

“Yes!”

The woman hummed softly and looked at Wang Xian who was standing under the pavilion.

“If you recover from your injuries, you will leave… Eh?”

As she spoke, her gaze suddenly landed on the holy feather on Wang Xian’s palm. Her eyes sparkled.

When Wang Xian saw her gaze, he stopped his spinning speed. He smiled and looked at the woman who was not young.

“Can you let me take a look at the feather in Your Hand?”

The lady’s expression changed slightly as she asked.

“Sure.”

Wang Xian paused for a moment. With a flick of his finger, the holy feather floated in front of the lady.

The Lady grabbed the holy feather with her palm. Her arm trembled slightly as her eyes shone with hope.

“This… Where did you get this feather?”

She felt a little thirsty and looked at Wang Xian.

“I picked it up in the windless forest. It’s a treasure.”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Are you willing to sell it or not? I can take out all the things you need for your cultivation. I can also guide you in your cultivation.”

The woman clenched her fists slightly and said to Wang Xian.

“Huh?”

Ye Lui Ying and the other two looked at their master in surprise.

What was going on?

Their master was willing to personally guide him in the cultivation of a feather. After all, their master was very powerful.

“This feather is of great use to me. I Won’t sell it.”

Wang Xian shook his head and rejected her with a smile.

The woman’s words made him feel that it was very interesting.

Upon hearing Wang Xian’s rejection, her expression changed. A hint of struggle appeared in her eyes.

“Can you let me hold it and comprehend it? I can guide you in your cultivation.”

The woman spoke again.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and thought to himself that she had a good temperament.

If she was a slightly greedy person, she would have already killed someone to snatch the treasure.

“Sure. However, I can only let you hold it for a few hours a day. Furthermore, you can’t be too far away from me.”

“Besides, I might be leaving soon.”

Wang Xian nodded and said.

“Alright, thank you very much.”

The woman nodded and thanked him.

She looked at the holy feather in her palm and threw it to Wang Xian.

“What kind of treasure is this? Why is master so moved by it?”

Ye Lui Ying and the rest were full of surprise and curiosity.

“We won’t go to the windless forest for the time being. We’ll go there when there’s no wind.”

“Fifth brother, bring them to cultivate.”

The lady said to her three disciples.

“It’s Master!”

The middle-aged man nodded respectfully and left immediately.

Ye lui Ying turned around curiously to look at her master and Wang Xian.

“I have the strength of a peak immortal king. You can ask me if you don’t know anything about cultivation. I can also provide you with some elixirs.”

“If you want to acknowledge me as your master, I will agree to accept you as my last disciple.”

The woman looked at Wang Xian and said after a moment of silence.

“There’s no need. I will be leaving soon.”

Wang Xian smiled and shook his head when he heard her words.

As he spoke, he passed the holy feather to the woman.

The woman took over the holy feather and did not say anything. She sat in the pavilion and closed her eyes.

She should be exploring the path of the divine emperor and looking for a breakthrough

Wang Xian looked at the lady and thought to himself. Then, he laughed. This feeling of pretending to be a pig to eat a tiger was pretty good.

At this moment, the communication stone plate in Wang Xian’s hand trembled. He took a look and saw that it was a message from heaven formation and the rest.

The four of them had entered a land of treasures and were looking for treasures.

He hesitated for a moment and did not call them over immediately.

He left after he had fully nurtured the holy feather.
