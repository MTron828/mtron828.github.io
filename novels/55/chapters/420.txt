Chapter 421: Don’t Oppress Me Just Because I’m Young (2)

“Kill!”

The skinny and fat old men exploded with daunting aura when they uttered the word coldly.

Xiao Ran was looking stern as he held his longword, staring at them with vigilance to prevent their sneaky attack again.

However, what amazed Xiao Ran was both skinny and fat old men spun around and fled suddenly.

“Let’s go and report to Aunt Mei about this. This brat is a disciple of Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown. On top of that, he possesses the strength of an Inborn Expert!”

Both of the old fellows exchanged gazes and spoke with a heavy look.

That little bastard not only possesses the strength of an Inborn Expert, but his master was also the Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown.

Things got tricky when this little bastard became an Inborn Expert. Now that he has such formidable backing...that will be huge trouble.

In particular, his backing was Miracle Doctor Wang.

According to the review given by the Underworld, Miracle Doctor Wang, and those Inborn Experts he commanded, could go against a quarter of Sacred Sect.

A quarter of Sacred Sect sounded quite scary enough.

Forget about a quarter of Sacred Sect. If Miracle Doctor Wang called upon four to five Inborn Experts, this matter would get even trickier.

Xiao Ran was, after all, part of the lineage of Xiao Clan.

He was assassinated because Aunt Mei had been controlling this using the power of her own family.

Currently, no more than six or seven Inborn Experts from Xiao Clan would totally side with Aunt Mei. The rest of the older generations in the clan would definitely side with Xiao Ran if they knew about him. ”

If Miracle Doctor Wang really brought a bunch of experts, sending Xiao Ran back to Sacred Clan as an Inborn Expert, Aunt Mei and Xiao Fan would definitely receive a terrifying blow.

As such, they must deliver the news to her, so that Aunt Mei could prepare herself for it.

“Two scheming old fogeys!”

Wang Xian went expressionless when he saw the two old men launching a sneak attack with secret weapons, now making an escape. With a change of stance, he appeared before them at a crazy speed.

“What’s the hurry? Both of you must spar with my disciple!”

Wang Xian sneered as he quirked his lips when he saw the two old men running in his direction.

“What?”

“He’s indeed the Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown, living up to his name. What scary speed he has!”

The two old men could not help but narrow their eyes as they braked with an awful look. Then, they stared at Wang Xian with vigilance.

“You can forget about escaping from me. Don’t even think about it. You better spar with my disciple!” Wang Xian said plainly to them.

“Well, well, Miracle Doctor Wang. Do you know who you are going up against? Don’t assume that you’re almighty and that you can do whatever you like. You’re not qualified to poke your nose into the Sacred Clan’s matters!”

The fat old man stared daggers at Wang Xian and remarked coldly.

“It’s my disciple’s matter, and so it’s mine. Sacred Clan? So what?” Wang Xian scorned.

“Arrogant!”

“Go and die!”

At this time, Xiao Ran raged from behind as he had been tricked by the two old men time and time again.

That embarrassed him in front of his master.

“Do it!”

The two old men exchanged glances. Knowing that they could never escape from Wang Xian’s hands, they exploded domineering strength and struck at Xiao Ran.

“Sword of Phantom!”

Xiao Ran gripped his Ancient Spiritual Sword tightly as the faint luster of Tranquil Blue Heavenly Flame was exuded from his body. Soon, the sapphire flame enveloped the entire sword.

Sword of Phantom was the swordplay passed down by Sui Huang. It was a compelling swordplay that matched his Tranquil Blue Heavenly Flame.

Xiao Ran wielded his sword as though dancing with blue phantoms, which was incredibly spooky.

“Not bad!”

With hands behind his back, Wang Xian smiled as he commented on Xiao Ran’s swordplay with a smiley face.

“His strength...”

As soon as the two old men came in contact with Xiao Ran’s swordplay, they grimaced.

The formidable Heavenly Flame was annoying enough if it got onto their clothes, because if they were not careful, they would sustain severe injuries from it.

Beside the Heavenly Flame, they also could not handle the sharpness from the mighty Inborn Spiritual Weapon.

Fu*k you!

They did not dare to touch the Heavenly Flame and Inborn Spiritual Weapon. Any person of the same level as Xiao Ran would find difficulty in defending him.

Suppression. It was not the suppression from his cultivation nor his experience, but rather, from his equipment.

Heavenly Flame and Inborn Spiritual Weapon were extremely precious treasures, and yet, he had both of them.

“This freaking Miracle Doctor Wang is too rich to equip this brat with such formidable weapons!”

After exchanging dozens of strokes, two old men had a bad feeling surging from the bottom of their hearts.

If they continued, they would get themselves killed.

If not for the fact that Xiao Ran was lacking experience, they might have already been injured by this brat.

They had to flee. But with a more powerful Miracle Doctor Wang around, they were unable to make their escape. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Despair began to crawl in.

They were here to slaughter the brat. They even thought that, given the strength of Xiao Shisan and the rest, the brat would be a dead body as long as they prevented him from escaping.

Yet, the situation had been overturned utterly.

The master of this brat was preventing them from escaping while that brat was trying to kill them with his own hands.

In the face of the spooky swordplay, razor-sharp Inborn Spiritual Weapon, and the daunting Heavenly Flame, they could only dodge with trepidation.

Argh!

The longer Xiao Ran fought, the more courageous he became. With the Ancient Spiritual Sword in his hand, he slashed the chest of the fat old man who was unable to dodge in time.

Daunting Heavenly Flame and razor-sharp Inborn Spiritual Weapon cut his abdomen straightaway.

Blood did not gush out as the body of fat old man stiffened up.

Xiao Ran swung his arm and enveloped him in a sapphire flame.

Argh!

A hopeless and fearful scream came from the fat old man.

The skinny old man trembled with fear as desperation filled his round, bulging eyes.

“Go to hell!”

Xiao Ran gritted his teeth as his eyes gleamed with hatred. With a twist, he pointed his longsword at the skinny old man and lowered it down.

“Oh no!”

The skinny old man was appalled as he quickly dodged.

Argh!

Another shriek was heard as the skinny old man looked at the long wound on his arm with a sapphire flame burning at a rapid speed.

Argh!

The skinny old man bit his teeth and pulled the dagger in his hand, severing his own left arm.

“I’ll kill everyone who chased after us personally to avenge my mother!”

The longsword in Xiao Ran’s hand was still gleaming with a daunting devilish-like sapphire flame as he pierced the skinny old man’s chest.

“Run!”

This time, the skinny old man did not care if Wang Xian was guarding at the side. To survive, he had to escape with a yell.

“Miracle Doctor Wang, if you dare to stop me, our clan will not let you off. We’ll kill all your family members. I advise you not to intervene in the matters of Sacred Clan. Otherwise, the Sacred Clan will be the place to bury you!”

While he desperately fled, he even let out a shrill threat.

Bam!

At this time, the skinny old man felt immense energy at his chest. His eyes seemed to be clouded by astonishment as he looked at the young man before him with disbelief.

“I won’t kill you. Go back and inform that mastermind in the Xiao Clan that I’ll take Xiao Ran back tonight!”

“Don’t you bully my disciple because he’s young!”
