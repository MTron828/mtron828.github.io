Chapter 3200: The starry sky trembled

Heavenly Dragon Peak was the largest peak in the entire Dragon Palace.

It was also the peak where the Heavenly Dragon King of the Heavenly Dragon Tribe was located.

The entire peak was extremely huge. The words ‘Heavenly Dragon Peak’were carved on it, and it contained an endless pressure.

The rise of the entire Heavenly Dragon tribe was very short. It was all thanks to the Heavenly Dragon King that they were able to reach their current stage.

Wang Xian and the rest were floating in the sky above the Heavenly Dragon Peak. Their eyes were sparkling.

“I wonder what is the current situation of that fellow, the Heavenly Dragon King. Is He Dead or has he escaped? What a pity that the leader of a primary race in the universe is just a chess piece.”

Wang Xian mumbled to himself. His body moved and he immediately flew towards the area below. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“All of you go and check the surroundings to prevent the Heavenly Dragon tribe from taking away the treasures here.”

“Also, Sky Formation, go and check the divine kingdom here and find the divine kingdom of the experts of the Heavenly Dragon Tribe.”

He ordered them one by one.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The members of the Dragon Palace nodded.

Wang Xian’s body moved and landed in the ocean below.

There was a dragon palace located below. This was the Dragon Palace of the Heavenly Dragon tribe.

The appearance of the Heavenly Dragon Palace was almost identical to that of the Heavenly Sea Dragon Palace. He moved his body and forcefully barged in.

“Who is it that barged into the Dragon Palace without permission? You are courting death!”

Just as he entered the Dragon Palace, a cold voice was heard.

More than ten figures flew over immediately.

The leader was a Level 1 universe knight.

Wang Xian looked over and waved his arm. Other than that universe knight, everyone else was killed.

“Soul Catcher!”

He stared at the Universe Knight of the Heavenly Dragon Clan who had his eyes wide open. He waved his arm and performed soul catcher.

Buzz

A stream of information was transmitted into Wang Xian’s mind. After seeing this information, a smile appeared on his face.

He flew straight ahead.

The layout of the entire dragon palace was almost identical to that of the Heavenly Sea Dragon Palace. However, compared to the Heavenly Sea Dragon Palace, it was much weaker.

After flying all the way to the Dragon King Palace, he arrived at the back of the Dragon Throne.

Over there was the treasure vault of the Heavenly Dragon Clan.

“As expected of the treasure vault of the Heavenly Dragon Clan!”

Wang Xian entered and immediately felt a majestic energy impact. This caused his eyes to light up and he revealed a fiery expression.

Although the Heavenly Dragon Clan did not have a very deep foundation, there were several primary races in the universe that they had destroyed during the billions of years of their rise.

In addition, the Heavenly Dragon Clan was fond of collecting treasures.

The treasures in the Heavenly Dragon Clan were huge.

There were all kinds of pills, weapons, and treasures.

Wang Xian waved his arm and kept them all in his bag.

After emptying the entire treasury, he went to the back.

It was located at the back and was also a dragon tomb. However, there were not many dragon tombs, only seven or eight of them.

However, those who could be buried here were all universe knights.

“Other than some pills and weapons, the entire Dragon Palace is also a huge resource.”

Wang Xian kept the dragon bones of the Heavenly Dragons in the Dragon Tomb and muttered.

“Eh? This Is?”

At this moment, Wang Xian looked at the mountain peak in the deepest part of the mountain.

There was an entrance there. There was a huge forbidden word written on the top of the entrance.

“Forbidden?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. After hesitating for a moment, he came to the front of the entrance.

The entrance was not big. It was only about four meters. There was a stone door. It was obvious that he did not want anyone to enter.

He looked inside and revealed a hesitant expression.

He walked to the front of the stone door and pushed it forcefully.

The strong resistance caused a look of surprise to appear in his eyes.

Wang Xian’s arm turned into a dragon claw and forcefully opened a huge hole.

Just as he opened the hole, a terrifying and strange force came from inside.

One of the forces was familiar to Wang Xian.

“Heaven Pilfering Meridian Exchange? A forbidden technique? An ancient technique?”

He mumbled as he looked inside.

The hole was not very big. There were two stone tables inside.

One of the tables was empty while the other table had a box on it. The box was about one meter long.

Wang Xian looked at the box and hesitated for a moment before opening it.

Crack! Crack

When the box was opened, there was a sculpture inside.

When he saw the sculpture inside, he was slightly stunned.

The upper body of the sculpture was that of a woman while the lower body was that of a divine dragon.

The hair on her head was not hair, but venomous snakes that looked extremely cold.

The eyes of the sculpture were blood-red, as though they possessed a mysterious energy.

Buzz

Just as Wang Xian was staring at the sculpture, a strange energy suddenly surged into his mind.

He felt that he was surrounded by a large number of beautiful women with human bodies and dragon bodies and venomous snakes on their heads.

They stuck out their tongues and revealed their ghastly mouths. Then, they started to devour him.

Wang Xian could feel that his body was being devoured bit by bit.

Buzz

At this moment, a ray of clarity came from his chest, causing him to cleanse himself.

He hurriedly opened his eyes to get rid of this strange illusion.

“What’s going on?”

Wang Xian stared at the statue in shock. His eyes widened slightly.

“What?”

At this moment, he suddenly let out a cry of surprise and stared at his body in disbelief.

Feeling the intense pain from his body, his expression changed slightly.

At this moment, one-third of his body was actually missing.

The flesh and blood inside was exposed.

“Could it be this strange statue? When I was sizing her up, it attacked me? Was My hallucination not an illusion?”

Wang Xian’s face was filled with astonishment.

Snap

He immediately closed the box with a grave expression on his face.

“No wonder the Heaven Dragon King placed this thing here so solemnly. It’s really strange.”

He mumbled as his eyes sparkled.

He kept it in his interspatial ring and prepared to return to the Dragon Palace to study it in front of the ancestral tree.

Otherwise, if not for the power of the ancestral tree, he would have been devoured unknowingly.

After leaving the stone room, he flew out of the Dragon Palace.

“Dragon King!”

At this moment, the powerhouses of the Dragon Palace flew over.

“How is it?”

Wang Xian looked at them and asked.

“The Heaven Array is still searching for the Divine Kingdoms of the Universe Knights. Some of the other powerhouses of the Heaven Dragon Clan have been killed by us.”

“The Sky Dragon Clan has been completely exterminated.”

Lei Ming and the rest said.

“The Sky Dragon King is not dead yet. We don’t know where he is now.”

“Let the sky array search here first. We will head to the ancient painting sect.”

Wang Xian pondered for a moment and said.

In order to prevent the treasures of the ancient painting sect from being taken away by the surviving disciples, they had to rush over in advance.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Everyone nodded.

They moved and immediately rushed towards the headquarters of the ancient painting sect.

The ancient painting sect had tens of thousands of huge planets and countless disciples.

The number of their sects was very terrifying.
