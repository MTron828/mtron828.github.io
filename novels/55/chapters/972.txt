Chapter 973: 0974 provoked

Translator: 549690339

Around them, more than a thousand new students looked at the young man in the ring with admiration.

More than a thousand new students, two days of competition.

Qin Shan, with an invincible attitude among the new students, had obtained the achievement of first place among all the new students.

Even Gao Meng, who was second place, was far from him!

Facing the strongest young man of the same level, everyone had envious expressions on their faces.

Some of the girls even excitedly shouted Qin Shan’s name, wishing they could immediately marry him.

There were very few girls in the Demon Hunters Academy, which made the others even more envious.

However, compared to envy, they admired Qin Shan’s strength even more. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“I heard that Qin Shan lives in the East Sea city’s slums, north district. TSK TSK, he’s really powerful!”

“Don’t you know? Not only is Qin Shan powerful, his sister is also very powerful. Look over there, that’s his sister, a captain of the amethyst mercenary group. She has the strength of a transcendent tier 4!”

“I’m impressed. No wonder no one dares to provoke Qin Shan in the Demon Hunters Academy in the future!”

“I’m really envious. With such a powerful sister and her own strength, she might be able to become a powerful expert in the future!”

The surrounding discussions could be heard once again.

At this moment, at a spot not far from the arena, seven to eight girls were standing there, attracting the attention of many people.

In particular, on the chests of these seven to eight girls, there was a badge, the badge of the amethyst mercenary group.

An eye-catching gold symbol.

The amethyst mercenary group!

Eight girls, each more beautiful than the other!

The girls who were able to enter the amethyst mercenary group were not pretty. Their strength was not bad, and many of them were even class captains.

The girl standing in the middle was dressed in black, giving off a special kind of energy.

Dressed in black, she also gave off a special kind of temptation. Many boys would glance at her from time to time.

“Qin Qing, your brother is even more powerful than you. He reached the peak of transcendence level three at such a young age, and he even received the title of first grade leader. It’s a pity that our amethyst mercenary group doesn’t recruit boys. Otherwise, we would definitely recruit him!”

A woman in red beside Qin Qing said to her with a smile on her face.

“My younger brother has been working hard since he was young. He has suffered more than me. The reason he has the ability is all because of his hard work!”

Qin Qing said with a smile and a trace of pride on her face.

“That’s because Brother Qin Shan has good talent. It’s useless to just work hard without talent!”

Another girl hurriedly added.

“That’s right, that’s right. Why don’t we go to the East Wind Pavilion to celebrate later?”

A male voice suddenly came from the side.

The young man was dressed in luxurious brocade clothes with a fan hanging on his waist and a badge hanging on his chest.

Young Master’s mercenary group.

At this moment, he said to Qin Qing in a fawning manner.

“There’s no need!”

Qin Qing heard the young man’s words and frowned slightly. She directly rejected him.

“It’s fine, Qin Qing. It Won’t cost much. Look at how Skinny Qin Shan is. I’ll bring him to eat some good food to nourish himself!”

The young man said again.

“There’s no need. I can give him whatever he wants. He can also obtain it through his own hard work!”

Qin Qing shook her head and smiled at her younger brother on the arena once again.

Wang Xian stood at the entrance and looked at the lively arena.

He was the strongest person in the first grade with the strength of a level three extraordinary.

In his opinion, it was like a bunch of noobs pecking at each other. He wasn’t interested in it at all.

He wasn’t interested in the entire demon Hunter College’s competition, let alone the first grade competition.

He could definitely punch a kid one punch at a time.

“Huh? It’s him?”

“That’s true. I heard his name is Wang Xian!”

“Why didn’t I see him during the competition these two days?”

Just as Wang Xian was about to leave, a student from the class was about to leave when he happened to see him standing at the door.

The group of more than a hundred people was slightly taken aback. Soon after, they started to discuss among themselves.

“Captain, do you want to Spar with him? If we beat him up, we can still get ten thousand middle-tier spirit stones!”

A female student said to the young man standing at the center.

“Let’s forget about it this time. I was hit in the chest just now, and I haven’t recovered yet. I need to rest for a while. When I recover, I’ll definitely spar with him!”

The young man waved his hand and said with a smile.

“Haha, the Captain is the third strongest person in the first grade. It’s easy to teach him a lesson!”

The girl threw a flirtatious glance and said with a smile.

“Haha, of course!”

The young man laughed proudly.

Wang Xian looked at them with a hint of coldness in his eyes. In the past two days, as long as he came to the academy, many people would come to provoke him. This made him a little annoyed!

“It’s Wang Xian!”

“He hasn’t been here for two days. I didn’t expect this fellow to come now!”

The hundreds of people suddenly stopped and looked outside. This attracted the attention of the people from class three.

When they saw Wang Xian, they were astonished.

They were very curious about this student who had skipped school for three days and caused such a big incident as soon as he entered the academy.

“Wang Xian, you even know to come to the academy. Are you afraid that the people from the young master’s mercenary group would come to take revenge on you? Is that why you didn’t dare to come over for the past two days?”

Duan Qingwen said to Wang Xian mockingly.

“Who?”

“The student who provoked the young master’s mercenary group?”

“It’s really him. He offended the young man from the young master’s mercenary group as soon as he entered the school!”

Duan Qingwen’s words instantly caused more people to look over. When they saw Wang Xian, they were astonished.

“That guy? Let Me Go and take a look!”

The young man who had been standing beside Qin Qing and the other girls heard the commotion. He raised his eyebrows and spoke to them before walking forward.

“It’s the young man who embarrassed Young Master’s mercenary group. If It’s interesting, let’s go and take a look too!”

A girl tugged at Qin Qing and the others’clothes and followed behind them.

The group of people walked towards the door.

Even Qin Shan, who was standing on the stage, looked towards Wang Xian.

In an instant, everyone’s attention was on him!

Everyone looked curiously at the man of the moment among the new students.

Wang Xian looked at everyone who was looking at him. He narrowed his eyes slightly and a hint of coldness flashed across his face.

It seemed that there were some matters that needed to be resolved. There were too many lice and they needed to be cleaned up.

“Hehe, little friend, you were the one who didn’t give face to our young master’s mercenary group that day, right?”

At this moment, a voice came from behind. The group of new students gathered at the front quickly made way for him.

The young man in embroidered clothes from the young master’s mercenary group walked in with a smile on his face. He stared at Wang Xian with a hint of mockery in his eyes.

Wang Xian looked at the young man who walked over and narrowed his eyes slightly. His gaze landed on the badge on his chest and a hint of coldness appeared on his face.

“So, he’s from a useless mercenary group!”
