Chapter 4121 - 4121: The 4120 universe rumbled as the ultimate treasure of Tianyuan appeared

Translator: 549690339

“Roar!”

Wang Xian’s body recovered to its peak in an instant!

He let out a wild roar as cracks started to appear on his body.

“Transformation of the Netherworld Dragon! ”

Wang Xian forced himself to perform the transformation of the Netherworld Dragon and blood flowed out of his mouth!

Such a forceful action using an ability that could not be used was extremely terrifying.

It even caused Wang Xian’s body, which had just recovered to its peak, to be injured directly.

Moreover, this injury was not light!

However, Wang Xian’s figure disappeared in an instant.

In an instant, he broke away from the attack of the Void Universe’s powerhouses!

“Eh? He actually recovered all his injuries in an instant and escaped forcefully! ”

When the Heaven’s Gate Duke and the rest saw that Wang Xian had actually recovered from his injuries rapidly and left directly, their faces were also filled with astonishment.

“He was forced to leave this time. He is already injured. Continue to chase! ”

Duke of Xining’s gaze focused as he controlled the Void Pagoda to continue his rapid pursuit!

“Whoosh! ”

Wang Xian’s body shifted to the Netherspirit avatar not far away.

He immediately transformed into his human form and took a few deep breaths. His expression was extremely ugly.

He had used all of his trump cards!

Wang Xian had almost used all of his trump cards!

The strongest ability of the dark resurrection Lily.

With this use, the resurrection Lily in his hand was almost useless.

It would take at least tens of millions of years for him to recover.

Similarly, the Shadow Dragon Avatar could no longer be used.

The Abyss Dragon Avatar could be used regardless of the damage to his body.

However, the Shadow Dragon Avatar could no longer be used!

Now that he was injured, it would take him at least a few million years to recover from this injury!

If he continued to use the transformation of the Netherworld Dragon, the injury would be unimaginable!

Wang Xian even had a feeling that if he were to use it two or three more times, his body would probably collapse and die!

“If I have no other choice, I can only use it twice. If I use it three times, it would be no different from death! ”

Wang Xian mumbled as he flew forward rapidly.

The Ghost Avatar continued to fly in the surroundings!

With his body injured, Wang Xian’s speed did not decrease by much.

However, he had yet to shake off the powerhouses from the Void Universe.

According to the memories in his mind, he would still need more than ten days to get to the nearest one.

“It seems like Pm doomed this time.”

Wang Xian mumbled and continued to fly at a fast speed!

Three minutes later, the skywriting compass showed again that the powerhouses from the Void universe were chasing him again.

The terrifying void pagoda and the terrifying energy made Wang Xian’s face bitter.

This time, he was at a disadvantage!

The energy that erupted from the Void Pagoda was not something that Wang Xian could withstand.

After all, there were two heaven origin creation powerhouses at the control level in the Void Pagoda.

Wang Xian shook his head helplessly.

“Transformation of the Netherworld Dragon! ”

Buzz

Wang Xian’s body began to collapse and the vitality in his body disappeared rapidly.

While he was undergoing the transformation, the surrounding energy was pressing toward him and depleting his vitality.

After he dodged, he spat out fresh blood.

He was severely injured. He was severely injured!

This kind of injury, without any treasures, it would take him hundreds of millions of years to cultivate and recover!

However, he could only continue to use it, forcefully using it.

Otherwise, he would be completely finished!

Even though he could revive, the price to revive was a bit high!

Furthermore, even if he died from heavy injuries, he didn’t want to be killed by the great beings of the void space.

“If I knew this earlier, I would have brought an lie here. If an lie were to come here, he can collect his corpse! ”

Wang Xian found joy in suffering!

If an lie was in this universe, he could bring his corpse back when he used the transformation of the Netherworld Dragon to die.

In this way, Wang Xian would recover much faster!

“He can’t take it anymore. He is forcefully using this teleportation ability. Chase Him! ”

In the Void Pagoda, Duke of Heaven’s Gate saw Wang Xian’s body starting to collapse and bleed.

Sensing that his aura was weakening rapidly, his eyes glowed as he shouted loudly!

Boom! Boom

The Void Pagoda continued to rumble as it continued to chase after Wang Xian!

However, two minutes later, the information of the Void Universe’s powerhouses was transmitted from the empty text compass again.

This made him shake his head helplessly.

The severe injuries on his body had already slowed down his speed by a lot.

He had just escaped for two minutes when he was caught up!

“Continue to perform the transformation of the Netherworld Dragon. If I die, so be it. At most, I can recover! ”

Wang Xian mumbled and gritted his teeth.

Buzz

Before the Void Pagoda arrived, Wang Xian performed another transformation of the Netherworld Dragon!

Wang Xian only felt his vision darken and his life force disappeared rapidly. Following that, he felt his consciousness slowly dissipating!

The transformation of the Netherworld Dragon was successful.

However, after he transformed, his body fell straight to the ground.

He was on the verge of collapsing as he fell down!

“He can’t take it anymore!”

At the back, Duke of Heaven’s Gate and the others who were chasing after him happened to see Wang Xian’s aura disappearing violently.

When they saw him escaping forcefully, their eyes lit up! “Chase him! He can’t escape anymore. Destroy him completely! ”

The eyes of the Duke of Heaven’s gate blazed as he shouted!

“He’s still so unbridled in our six paths universe. He really doesn’t put us in his eyes. ”

However, at this moment, a voice suddenly entered his mind!

Following that, a figure quickly flew over from a very far distance.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The energy on his body was very strange, giving off a terrifying feeling!

His entire body looked extremely stiff!

A pair of blood-red eyes stared at Tian Men Gong and Xi Ning Gong in the Void Pagoda!

“Not good!”

Tian men gong and Xi Ning Gong’s expressions changed slightly when they saw the figure that suddenly flew over.

If this was in the primal chaos, they would not have any changes in their universe.

However, this was the six paths universe.

They were being suppressed here!

“Damn it, let’s escape first. That guy is already heavily injured. We will look for him after we escape! ”

Duke Tianmen’s expression darkened as he spoke to Duke Xining!

“Alright. ”

Duke Xining’s expression changed slightly as he nodded.

They did not expect that the Heavenly Yuan creation realm expert from the six paths universe would arrive so quickly!

However, since a heavenly yuan creation realm expert had arrived, they could only flee.

Even if they were all at the control level and had the Void Pagoda, they were still not his match.

However, they were still not his match!

Duke Xining immediately controlled the Void Pagoda and instantly fled into the distance!

“You want to escape so easily? Let Me Show you guys the power of the sixth path of my six paths universe.”

“Undying and indestructible, resurrected from the dead, six paths of the Dead!

The figure floating in void space narrowed his eyes and shouted coldly.

Every time he spoke, the sky around him darkened.

In front of Void Space Tower, an incomparably huge coffin appeared.

The entire coffin seemed to want to seal off the entire world..
