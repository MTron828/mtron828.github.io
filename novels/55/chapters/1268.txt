Translator: 5496903

He moved and jumped onto the Heaven’s pride stage. Under the guidance of a special energy, he arrived at the center of the Golden Light.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

At this moment, Wang Xian sensed many figures flying towards him.

He took a look at Ling Jian ‘er, who was dressed in white. Ren Xingchen, who was dressed in tattered clothes, also saw four to five heaven’s pride experts flying towards him.

Ling Jian ‘Er and Ren Xingchen came to Wang Xian’s side. They looked at him and followed him silently.

“Tang Feng didn’t come. The sixth and Tenth Heaven’s favorites didn’t come either!”

“There are actually three heaven’s favorites who were absent. Could the rumors be true? Is it really like the rumors of the past two days?”

“It should be true. Someone entered the training grounds and discovered that many high-level ferocious beasts had disappeared. No one from the demonic beast clan dared to enter the training grounds!”

“I wonder which powerhouse actually entered the training grounds through the descending technique. However, the Battle of the Prodigy Bridge this time is going to be troublesome!”

At this moment, the voices of a few heaven’s favorites could be heard from the side, causing Wang Xian to raise his eyebrows.

He didn’t say anything. Stepping under the Golden Light, he walked straight to the front.

On both sides, countless people entered the viewing platform beside the arena. The number of people watching the Battle of the Prodigy bridge this time was even more than when the nameless sword demon challenged Qian Ye.

This time, it was related to the battle between humans and demonic beasts.

Although humans had not won the Supreme Battle of Heaven’s favorites for more than 100 years, the number of people watching each battle was never small.

“The nameless sword demon is here. Ling Jian ‘ER, Ren Xingchen and the rest are here!”

“Eh? Why are there only seven people? There are still three people who haven’t arrived?”

At this moment, hundreds of thousands of people were watching Wang Xian and the rest walking towards the arena on the Heaven’s Pride Bridge.

They were the center of attention, the real center of attention.

They represented the most outstanding human heaven’s pride in the Liuhai region and the most talented group of people.

However, when they saw that only seven out of the ten heaven’s pride experts had arrived, everyone in the audience had ugly expressions on their faces.

“Blood flow empire’s Tang Feng hasn’t arrived. Looks like the rumors these two days are true!”

The crowd looked at the seven geniuses on the Heaven’s pride stage and discussed with grim expressions.

During these two days, news came from the world’s third trading company that the Demon Beast Geniuses were preparing to kill the human geniuses in this Battle of the Heaven’s Pride Bridge.

At first, there were many people who didn’t believe it, but today, there were actually three geniuses who hadn’t arrived, especially blood flow empire’s Tang Feng. This made them even more certain of the authenticity of the news.

“Come on, let’s kill a bunch of beasts from the Demon Beast Race. Let’s kill them!”

“That’s right, there’s not a single one of us humans who is cowardly. We will support you guys and kill those beasts!”

“Even if we don’t almost obtain the supremacy of Heaven’s favorites, we still have to show the demon race our strength. If they want to defeat us, they will have to pay a heavy price!”

When Wang Xian and the rest walked to the front of the arena, shouts that sounded like a landslide and tsunami rang out from the surroundings.

Humans and demonic beasts were mortal enemies. Today, as long as a heaven’s favorite defeated his enemy, he would definitely gain the respect of countless people.

This was a great honor for the future of every Heaven’s favorite. It would be much more convenient for him to do anything in the future. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

If a heaven’s favorite wanted to establish a faction, he would also attract countless people to join him.

This kind of honor was definitely comparable to obtaining the title of Human Heaven’s pride.

“Fight, kill them, kill those beasts!”

“Fighting against those of the same level, I don’t believe that I’m still not a match for those demonic beasts!”

Hearing the cheers around them, the blood of the Heaven’s pride boiled.

The battle between the Heaven’s pride of the human race and the monster race was also between the 10th and the 10th, and between the 9th and 9th.

Basically, they were both at the half-step void interpretation realm. If they were said to be inferior to the demon beasts, they would also admit defeat.

A group of seven people entered the arena. At this time, the Human Arena and the Demon Beast Arena were not connected.

When the seven of them entered the arena, the entire arena moved forward.

And in the front, there were also arenas moving in this direction.

“Hehehe, despicable humans, today will be the day you die!”

“Despicable humans, wait for the sharp claws of our heaven’s favorites, they will tear your bodies apart.”

“Haha, Kill, Kill, Kill, kill the heaven’s favorites of humans, let them know how powerful we are!”

Right at this moment, roars came from the opposite side, filled with blood and killing intent.

On the opposite side, nine figures were standing on the stage. Their bodies were emitting killing intent.

The spot in the middle was empty.

On the left and right of the center were two blood savage demonic beasts. Each of them was about three meters in size.

Their arms were covered with sharp teeth. They looked extremely ferocious.

Blood Savage Demonic Beasts, Demonic Lin Demonic Beasts, Ghost Monkey Demonic Beasts, sickle-tailed snake demonic beasts, and bloodthirsty sea demonic beasts.

The five types of demon beasts stood on the arena and stared coldly at Wang Xian and the rest.

Behind them, tens of thousands of demon beasts were floating around and letting out ferocious roars.

The brutal and ferocious roars rang out, causing many weaker humans to turn pale.

“They’re here, the Heaven’s pride of the Demon Beast Clan? Why are there only nine of them? Why didn’t the strongest Heaven’s Pride King Beast appear?”

“These damn demon beasts, if not for the protection of the array formation, I would have charged over and killed them all!”

In the surrounding audience stands, everyone stared angrily in the direction of the Demon Beasts.

All the demon beasts also stared bloody at the humans.

Both sides were filled with hatred!

“Our race’s chosen ones, 10th place sickle blood, sickle-tailed snake race, despicable humans, come and die!”

When the two huge arenas overlapped, a sickle-tailed snake demon beast with two snake tails and a long and sharp thorn on its tail flew directly to the center of the arena.

It was about 10 meters in size and had a huge triangular head. It stared coldly in the direction of Wang Xian and the rest.

“It’s sickle blood, the 10th place on the prodigy roll of our race. Only Xiao Shikong, who is ranked 10th, can accept the challenge. However, he didn’t come!”

Luo Shihua, ranked 5th on the side, looked at the empty seat beside him and said with a dark face.

The people around the ring clearly saw this as well, and their expressions were very ugly.

“Xiao Shikong didn’t come at all. Damn it, the Demon Beast Clan won the first battle!”

Everyone’s expressions were somewhat ugly.

“Keke, no one came up? Humans, they’re really cowards. They only know how to play some despicable tricks. Cowards, they actually don’t even have the courage to fight with me. Trash, trash!”

Sickle blood of the sickle-tailed snake clan let out a cold and disdainful mocking voice.

The voice spread throughout the entire arena, and everyone could hear it clearly.

“HMPH, you’re still missing one!”

The ninth ranked young Prodigy’s expression was ugly. He stared at Sickle Blood and roared with killing intent.

“Haha, Missing One? That’s because you guys don’t have the qualifications to make our demon soul king attack. With just you bunch of weak humans, our king beast doesn’t need to attack. You guys aren’t our match either!”

Sickle Blood’s triangular eyes revealed a look of disdain as he ridiculed them.

This caused all the humans to reveal a trace of embarrassment.

“It’s you, a coward of the humans. I, sickle blood, have come to challenge the ninth ranked Heaven’s favorite of the humans. I’ll let you all know that a bunch of trash still wants to compete with us. Dream On!”
