2710 2710 had entered the abyss of the imperial court

“Poison nine, are there any restrictions on parasitizing other creatures?”

In front of the Dragon Transformation Pool of the Dragon Palace, the eight-limbed demon Fiend and the other Demon Fiend had been playing tricks for a while before they rushed into the dragon transformation pool excitedly.

He looked at their bodies and asked poison nine with a smile on his face.

“Dragon King, with my current strength, I can only parasitize creatures that are weaker than me. If I want to parasitize creatures of the same level, there is one way, which is to seriously injure them and then parasitize them.”

“According to the information in my mind, I can parasitize all living creatures, including some plants.”

Poison nine pondered for a moment and said.

“In that case, the abyssal seed can also parasitize?”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled as he said to him. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Yes.”

Poison nine nodded his head with certainty.

“If I can parasitize the abyssal seed?”

Wang Xian was tempted. The situation at the imperial court was more dangerous. Sending the members of the Dragon Palace over would cause great damage. However, what if they were to send the poisonous horned dragon seed?

They could directly enter the body of the abyssal seed through parasitism. They could completely control the parasitical body and hunt down the abyssal seed in the form of the abyssal seed.

Most importantly, after parasitizing the abyssal seed, they could investigate the situation of the abyssal race.

With the internal situation of the abyssal seed, the Dragon Palace could definitely find a way to capture all of them in one fell swoop.

At the thought of this, his eyes shone.

“Prime Minister Gui, use all your strength to gather resources. Ask Duan Tian and Jiu Xiao if they are still willing to change to a terrestrial planet. We can make it cheaper.”

“Also, check if there are any dire beasts on the Demon Island. Send the experts of the Dragon Palace to hunt them down. Use all your strength to upgrade the members of the poison making department.”

Wang Xian immediately called Prime Minister Gui over and said to him.

“It’s the Dragon King.”

Prime Minister Gui nodded and immediately went to collect the resources.

Currently, the resources in the dragon transformation pool could only support the demon eight qi and the thousands of other members to upgrade their jobs. It wasn’t even enough to upgrade their jobs.

The Dragon Palace needed to search for more resources so that the members of the poison making department could complete their job transition.

The poison making department didn’t have many members, only 2,000.

Of these 2,000, there were only about 10 undying emperors, the rest were all God lords.

There was nothing they could do, the poison making department was only the weakest dragon, the resources of the Dragon Palace could only be used by them in the end.

Even the eight qi and Mo Sha, they only had undying emperor level 7 strength, the poison they created could threaten level 9, however if they released it themselves, they could easily dodge it.

The two of them were the weakest among the group of leaders.

After all, they could only fight a level higher.

Such strength was also the reason why Wang Xian took special care of them. If not, it would be considered pretty good for them to have the strength of a level 4 or 5 immortal king.

However, after their class change, they could have the combat strength of a Level 9 immortal king.

They could be considered to be able to keep up with the strength of the leaders.

“Keke Keke, I’ve succeeded in my class change, I’ve finally risen.”

A few hours later, the arrogant voices of the Ba Qi and Mo Sha could be heard from within the dragon transformation pool.

“Hehe, Thank You Dragon King for your nurturing.”

The two of them flew to the side of the dragon transformation pool and greeted Wang Xian with smiles.

“Very good, we’ll greatly increase the strength of your poison making department.”

“Also, you should understand the abilities you have obtained. The upcoming Battle of the Abyss will depend on all of you.”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Don’t worry, Dragon King. In the future Battle of the Abyss, we will parasitize the abyssal seeds and let them kill each other. Keke Keke.”

“The following battle will be taken over by our poison horned dragon seed.”

Ba Qi and Mo Sha were both old yin-like existences. Naturally, they knew the greatest use of the abilities they had obtained.

“That’s right. Also, if poison nine follows you in the future, it’s all thanks to him that you can become poisonous horned dragons.”

Wang Xian continued speaking to them.

“Don’t worry, Dragon King. Leave this little brother poison nine to us.”

“Haha, Little Brother, Let’s go. I’ll bring you to the Dragon Palace first. When you join the Dragon Palace in the future, with your two big brothers protecting you, you don’t have to be afraid of anyone.”

“Even in the Dragon Palace, other than the Sky Array AO qitian and the other two who are stronger than us, we don’t need to care about them, Hehe.”

The two excitedly walked over to poison nine’s side and wrapped their arms around his shoulders.

This made poison nine slightly at a loss.

From his senses, these two abnormal fellows beside him were both undying god King Level 9.

Would they bring him down if they looked so freakish?

In the next few days, the Dragon Palace’s sales were all on the planet they owned.

It could be said to be a huge bargain.

...

When the Abyss invaded, Jiu Xiao and Duan Tian didn’t want to buy the planet’s land.

However, the price the Dragon Palace was selling was too low, it was simply a profit.

With such a low price, Jiu Xiao and Duan Tian spent a lot of resources to buy some planets and lands.

And the Dragon Palace used all these resources to change their jobs in the poison making department, the remaining resources allowed Poison 9 to rise to Undying Level 5, with an undying level 8 battle strength.

The poison making department took half a month to change their jobs.

“Dragon King.”

Half a month later, the eight-limbed demon king Poison 9 and the other two stood at the front, followed by the 2,000 members of the poison making department.

Out of the 2,000 members, only about 500 had the combat strength of an immortal king. Fortunately, after the upgrade, the combat strength of the rest of the members had reached the peak of a god Lord, which was not bad.

The strongest eight-limbed demon king level 9 had only poison 9 at level 8.

Everyone stood in the Dragon King’s Hall and greeted Wang Xian respectfully.

“I’m going to bring you to the Abyss battlefield at the junction of the imperial court and the Cold Night Island. How much you can improve to next is up to you.”

...

“Use all the abyss seeds you’ve hunted to improve the strength of your poison-making department.”

Wang Xian glanced at them and said lightly.

“Don’t worry, Dragon King. I, Ba Qi, can guarantee that in the future, other than the Dragon King and the Dragon Queen, our poison making department will be the boss of the Dragon Palace.”

Ba Qi roared loudly.

“Let’s go.”

Wang Xian smiled faintly and stood up immediately.

“Little ones, follow the Dragon King. This time, you must carry out the cunning, cunning, and unscrupulous methods that I have taught you. Whether our poison making department can rise up will depend on this time.”

Mo sha shouted at his subordinates from the side.

“It’s boss Mo Sha!”

The members of the drug manufacturing department immediately roared with fighting spirit.

These were the members of the drug manufacturing department who were taught by Ba Qi and Mo Sha.

These two guys were not good people in the past, and they were not good people now. Naturally, the subordinates they brought out were not good people either.

Du Jiu, who was beside them, was dizzy.
