Translator: 549690339

“Eh?”

The Vice Leader of the Spirit Beast mercenary group in the sky watched the action of the mercenary group below. When he saw the last part of the mercenary group, he suddenly raised his eyebrows.

With a glance, he moved his body and directly landed at the lowest position.

“Vice leader Ling, is there any problem with the vigilance?”

An old man asked cautiously.

“Don’t worry, elder Xiao. With Our Spirit Beast mercenary group here, there won’t be any problems!”

“Haha, with vice-leader Ling Here, we’ll be at ease!”

An old man next to him said with a smile.

“Hehe, right, supervisor Du, we just encountered an interesting matter. That Immortal Phoenix mercenary group is at the back!”

Vice-leader Ling said with a smile.

“That mercenary group? At the back? The last one seems to be the small chamber of Commerce that the Zhou family just established this year!”

The middle-aged man called supervisor du slightly raised his eyebrows.

“It should be right. I remember that their mercenary group’s commission is only 50,000!”

Deputy Commander Ling said with a slight mocking tone.

“That mercenary group accepted a mission with a commission of 50,000 middle-grade spirit stones? Hehe, it’s really interesting. I really can’t imagine that a powerful mercenary group would accept such a mission!”

Supervisor du’s face darkened as he said coldly.

“I don’t know why that mercenary group refused the mission back then, but I can confirm that the Immortal Phoenix Mercenary Group is a trash mercenary group!”

Vice-leader Ling said with a smile.

“Humph, if it weren’t for that mercenary group, Our Green Vine Chamber of Commerce wouldn’t be unable to hire a mercenary group!”

Supervisor du snorted coldly and looked at elder Xiao who was beside him. “This time, the small Zhou Chamber of Commerce has stolen half of our resources. Elder Xiao, when should we take action?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“We can’t take action openly. Let’s wait until the Blackwater Swamp. That place is more suitable!”

Elder Xiao smiled and looked at vice-leader Ling.

“As long as you give the order, we can take their dog lives at any time!”

Vice-leader ling smiled sinisterly.

“Hehe, okay. When the time comes, I want to see how powerful that two-star gold mercenary group is!”

“Haha, that’s Great. We’ll have to rely on vice-leader Ling then!”

The Chamber of Commerce drove quickly in an orderly manner. The dark night did not cause them too much trouble.

Zhou Han and Jin Liuyan sat in a carriage to rest while Wang Xian sat cross-legged in the carriage to cultivate.

Father Zhou scanned the surroundings. It was obviously his first time coming out.

“Leave the few small ferocious beasts to us!”

In less than two hours, the voices of a few members of the mercenary group came from the front. Many people who were resting were pleasantly surprised.

A noisy voice came from the merchant group.

“Don’t worry about the few small ferocious beasts!”

At this moment, a voice came from the front. Everyone heaved a sigh of relief and continued to rest.

In the wild, one could encounter danger at any time.

Due to the long journey, the road was rather flat. If one encountered a few ferocious beasts by chance, they would be quickly dealt with by the mercenary group.

Wang Xian and the rest were at the back, so they didn’t have to do anything.

Ten hours passed quickly and the sun rose slowly.

“Rest for half an hour. Feed the horses and eat. Get Ready. We are about to reach the Blackwater Swamp!”

Deputy Leader Ling’s orders came from the front.

As a level seven extraordinary, he had the ability to command everyone.

“The Blackwater Swamp area is very dangerous. It is two dangerous places on our journey. There is a powerful ferocious beast, the swamp croc. If we go wrong there, we will easily fall into the swamp. Once we fall into the swamp, it will be very dangerous!”

Father Zhou said to Wang Xian. He took out some food from his interspatial ring and said, “Captain Wang, let’s eat together!”

“No need, I brought food!”

Wang Xian shook his head.

“Hehe, Captain Wang cultivates the wood attribute. Help us to condense a table and chair!”

Zhou Han and Jin Liuyan walked out and said to Wang Xian with a smile.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. With a wave of his arm, the grass on the ground grew rapidly and quickly condensed into a few tables and chairs.

“Impressive, leader Wang’s control is really strong!”

Father Zhou gave him a thumbs up.

Wang Xian smiled faintly and sat down directly.

In other places, there were also people who condensed tables and chairs with the wood attribute. There were also people who condensed tables and chairs with the metal attribute and wood attribute.

For extraordinary experts, it was very convenient to eat and rest in the wild.

After resting for half an hour, the caravan continued to move forward.

Soon, a blackwater swamp appeared in front of them.

The entire boundless region was filled with pools of blackwater.

There were all sorts of plants growing on it.

The entire region was extremely humid. There were no roads to speak of.

The Blackwater Swamp covered an extremely large area. The best way to cross this area was to fly in the air.

However, the caravan obviously couldn’t fly over. Someone was scouting ahead.

Moreover, there was a blackwater imperial crocodile living in the Blackwater Swamp. This kind of creature was hidden in the swamp, and its entire body was pitch-black. It was very difficult to discover.

“All mercenary groups send one person over to scout ahead!”

When they arrived in front of the Blackwater Swamp, deputy leader Ling’s voice rang out as he spoke to everyone.

“Yes!”

All mercenary groups responded and sent out a member. Wang Xian also gestured to a golden swordfish.

“All of You Scout ahead. You must be careful of the alligator hidden in the swamp!”

The merchant group entered the Blackwater Swamp and continued to move forward on the road with a large carrying capacity. However, their speed was much slower than before.

It would take two days and one night to cross this Blackwater Swamp.

The caravan traveled for four hours without any danger.

“Roar!”

Suddenly, a huge creature jumped up from the front. A terrifying ten-meter-long black monster suddenly rushed out of the Blackwater Swamp.

The Black Shadow’s attack was extremely fast and fierce. Its mouth was actually ten meters long.

“Ah!”

Before a member of the mercenary group could react, he was killed immediately.

“An extraordinary level five di’e! Go and kill him! Whoever kills him will get his corpse!”

“Let us do it! How dare you kill a member of our mercenary group! I want to avenge my brother!”

Following that, more than ten mercenary groups flew over.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The terrifying sounds of collision rang out continuously. Wang Xian stood up from the carriage and looked over.

He was about ten meters tall and was covered in thick, shiny black skin. His huge head was extremely ferocious.

It was similar to the Sharks on Earth. However, the difference was that there was a huge black horn on the head of this alligator.

Its limbs were extremely strong and it had a long, slender tail. Its entire body was filled with a terrifying destructive power!

However, under the siege of the members of the mercenary group, huge wounds gradually appeared on the level 5 overlord Croc.

“That’s a four-star silver-tier mercenary group in Donghai City. Their leader has the strength of A Level 6 transcendent!”

Father Zhou introduced to Wang Xian from the side.

Wang Xian nodded. Looking at the Overlord Croc, a hint of doubt appeared on his face.

The alligator was very strong among the same level!
