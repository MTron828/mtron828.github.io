Chapter 1205: 1206, defeating a heaven’s pride expert

Translator: 5496903

“How Dare You Kill My Mount? I Am Heaven’s pride, Heaven’s sword star. Today, I will tear you into pieces!”

Heaven’s Sword Star’s furious roar was heard. As he looked at the pieces of the Purgatory Mastiff’s corpse on the ground, his eyes slowly turned blood-red.

The value of a second level void interpretation beast could buy half a city.

Now that he was killed by Wang Xian, he let out an angry roar and charged towards him.

A terrifying gust of wind instantly gathered around him. He was like a violent tornado that swept across the entire sky.

The tornado turned into a sharp sword that was incomparably sharp.

A terrifying murderous aura gathered in the storm and covered an area of one kilometer.

Everyone’s expression changed drastically as they retreated in a hurry.

“This fellow is going to die. He actually dared to kill the Mount of the Heavenly Sword Star. That’s a ferocious beast with a level two bloodline of the void interpretation realm. It’s priceless!”

“I’m angry. That young man killed the Mount of Heavenly Sword Star. He will not rest until he is dead!”

“Is this guy courting death? Heavenly Sword Star is ranked 15th on the prodigy roll. There are only a dozen people in the younger generation who are stronger than him. is that guy courting death?”

“That young man was able to kill A Level 9 transcendent purgatory mastiff in an instant. His strength is not simple. It is very likely that he has the strength of a half-step profound void tier. He can be comparable to a prodigy!”

Everyone around them retreated backward in horror. They looked at the Heaven’s sword star with a murderous aura.

“Heaven’s pride expert? Hehe, do you know that you are courting death? Arrogant? I will let you know the price of being arrogant in front of me!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with killing intent.

He originally wanted to kill this fellow after he came out of the sword mansion.

However, he didn’t expect him to be so arrogant.

Since that was the case, he would fulfill his wish!

“Die!”

Tian Jian Xing moved his body and brought along a sword storm that was a thousand meters tall. He attacked Wang Xian directly.

Buzz

Wang Xian looked at Tian Jian Xing who was attacking him with a sword storm. His gaze focused slightly.

In the sky, earthy yellow soil appeared instantly.

Wang Xian waved his arm again. Numerous thorns appeared directly and twined around Heavenly Sword Star and the storm of blades on his body.

In an instant, the dense thorns connected with the soil and formed a huge net that was 1,000 meters tall and 100 meters wide in front of him.

The dense thorns seemed to be weaving the entire world into it.

The storm of blades on heavenly sword star dissipated slowly and trapped his entire body.

“What?”

Heavenly Sword Star’s pupils contracted slightly, and a solemn expression appeared on his face.

“Hiss, that young man is so strong!”

“Heavenly Sword star has encountered a tough opponent this time!”

When everyone around saw this scene, their expressions changed slightly.

“How dare a fellow who has not reached the insightful void stage be so arrogant and not put anyone in his eyes? Trash, Go and become a new person!”

A hint of disdain appeared in Wang Xian’s eyes. With a move of his palm, a terrifying combination attribute was sent flying.

Extreme Ice and fire explosion!

Golden Flow!

Following that, two combination attribute attacks were thrown out casually.

Even a powerhouse at the first level of the insightful void stage would have to be careful in dealing with these two types of attacks.

“Sword Control Wind Shield!”

When Heavenly Sword Star saw Wang Xian’s attack, his face changed drastically. His body trembled as two meter-long wind swords were formed rapidly and spun around him rapidly.

It was the divine ability, sword control wind shield.

Sensing Wang Xian’s attack, he unleashed all of his strength. Cold sweat broke out on his forehead.

Boom

The extreme ice and fire attack exploded on Heavenly Sword Star’s divine ability defense. The entire sword control wind shield collapsed slowly.

“What?”

Heavenly Sword Star was horrified.

One attack had broken through his divine ability defense. Another attack followed closely behind.

He gritted his teeth as a green light flashed in front of his chest.

A green armor appeared.

Boom

A powerful force landed on his insightful void tier armor. Heavenly Sword Star retreated backward.

“PFFT... you... you...”

The powerful impact caused his body to fly backward. His expression changed drastically as he stared at Wang Xian with widened eyes.

“Do you think that you are a heaven’s favorite and can suppress everything?”

Wang Xian revealed a mocking look in his eyes.

“Water tomb!”

He shouted softly. A water tomb appeared instantly and headed straight for the Heavenly Sword Star.

“Wind blast!”

When he saw Wang Xian’s attack approaching again, he roared and retreated hurriedly.

However, his speed was still a little slow.

Even though he had used his supernatural ability, he was still restrained by the water tomb.

“Heaven’s pride, today I will beat up an arrogant heaven’s pride like you!”

“It’s better to keep a low profile!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were extremely cold as he looked at the sky.

Boom

A huge mountain appeared directly in the sky above Heavenly Sword Star. The mountain was about a thousand meters in size.

At this moment, a terrifying flame suddenly appeared on the mountain peak.

The mountain peak directly descended.

“Ah, you can’t kill me. I’m a heaven’s chosen. I have a profound void tier armor on me. You Can’t kill me!”

Heavenly Sword Star looked at the terrifying mountain peak descending towards him and roared loudly with a malevolent expression.

He struggled out of the water tomb and fled into the distance.

However, he still wasn’t able to escape the distance of the fire territory.

“Boom!”

The fire territory landed on Heavenly Sword Star’s body.

A green light appeared on his armor and a terrifying defense covered his entire body, blocking the fire territory’s attack for him.

“Crack Crack Crack!”

However, in less than a second, the green light on his armor began to crumble.

“No...”

Heavenly Sword Star’s face was filled with shock and his eyes were filled with fear. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“No, don’t kill me. My father is the sect leader of Swords Gate. Don’t kill me!”

Tian Jian Xing’s void interpretation level armor was crumbling bit by bit. Finally, he panicked. The veins on his face bulged as he shouted loudly.

“You are a heaven’s favorite. Don’t beg for mercy. It will lower your status!”

Wang Xian’s indifferent voice was heard.

Boom

As soon as he finished speaking, the fire territory exploded completely. A terrifying impact landed directly on Tian Jian Xing’s body.

In an instant, heavenly sword star was even more miserable than the purgatory mastiff. He turned into a bloody mist and left behind an interspatial ring.

“Hiss, hiss, hiss!”

The sound of gasping could be heard from the people around them.

They looked at Wang Xian, who was standing there calmly. Their faces were filled with shock.

Heavenly Sword Star was a heaven’s pride expert!

Heaven’s pride experts were not conferred by themselves. The Real Heaven’s pride experts were conferred by the ancient blood stream sect.

In the entire Liuhai region, only the top 20 people before the age of 50 could be called prodigies.

This meant that the top 20 people in the entire Liuhai region might become level three, level four, or even stronger existences in the future.

Heavenly Sword Star was a prodigy. He had the right to look down on the youth of his generation.

He had the right to be overbearing and arrogant.

Because he was a prodigy!

But now, a heaven’s favorite was actually directly beaten up.

Compared to the young generation, he didn’t have the ability to fight back at all!
