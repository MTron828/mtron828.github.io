Chapter 1326: 1327, the true identity of the nameless sword demon

“Today, I’m going to kill you!”

A domineering voice reverberated in the sky above the entire Guanglong Island.

The eighth Prince, Long Xiaoyun, stood in the middle and stared at Wang Xian coldly.

Beside him, the first prince, Long Xiaochen, bowed his head while long Xiaotian stood there with an ugly expression.

Upon hearing the eighth Prince’s domineering words, Long Xiaotian raised his head and stared at him.

“Long Xiaoyun, don’t you dare!”

“Haha!”

Upon hearing his voice, Long Xiaoyun looked at long Xiaotian with disdain. “A defeated opponent has no right to threaten me!”

“I, Long Xiaoyun, will definitely avenge the humiliation from that day. I will give you three seconds to get down from here. Otherwise...”

He looked at Wang Xian again and said coldly.

“Hiss!”

When everyone around felt the invincible stance of the eighth prince, they took a deep breath.

“A few months ago, all the subordinates of the eighth Prince were killed by the second Prince’s brother, Wang Xian. Today, the eighth prince who entered the Origin Light Dragon Pool is going to take revenge!”

“At that time, the eighth prince was extremely humiliated. Now that he has the strength, he naturally has to take revenge!”

“That Wang Xian is not weak either. He is at least at the first level of the Seethrough realm and has two ferocious beasts at the first level of the Seethrough Realm!”

“First level of the Seethrough Realm? Ferocious Beasts? With the eighth Prince’s strength, he should be able to kill them in an instant. Just now, the second Prince’s Mount was killed in an instant. The eighth Prince did not show his true strength at all!”

“This Wang Xian is doomed. Not only is the eighth prince extremely powerful, but the frost sect is also extremely terrifying!”

“Don’t forget about the connections of that Wang Xian. The eighth prince might not dare to kill him!”

When everyone around saw this scene, their faces were filled with astonishment. Their eyes were flickering as they watched this scene.

Wang Xian looked at the eighth prince who was provoking him. He had a look that said that he was determined to kill him. A cold expression appeared in his eyes.

He stood up slowly and swept his gaze across the eighth Prince and everyone from the cold sect.

“Little brother Wang Xian!”

Long Xiaotian’s grandfather looked worried when he saw Wang Xian standing up.

The few elders from the judging panel frowned slightly when they saw this scene.

They were naturally very clear about Wang Xian’s connections. The daughter of the sect leader of the Heavenly Sword sect had confessed to him.

The young master of the top family in the vast region had a close relationship with him.

If the eighth prince really killed Wang Xian, it would cause some unnecessary trouble, or even a crisis.

“It’s a simple sparring session. Don’t overdo it!”

The white-haired elder pondered for a moment and said to the eighth prince below.

“Don’t overdo it?”

Long Xiaoyun raised his eyebrows. Soon after, a ferocious smile appeared on his face. “The winner becomes the king and the loser becomes the bandit. Today, no one can stop my determination to kill him!”

“No matter what background and strength he has, he will die!”

Boom

Long Xiaoyun raised his head. His eyes were filled with endless coldness and aggressiveness, and a terrifying aura was directly emitted from his body.

Dazzling white light and terrifying aura soared into the sky from the center.

The Noon Sun instantly dimmed. The entire domain seemed to be centered around Long Xiaoyun.

At this moment, he was like the chosen one, covering an area of three kilometers.

“What?”

When the white-haired old man heard the eighth Prince’s words, his eyes were filled with displeasure.

However, when he saw the aura that Long Xiaoyun erupted from below, he was completely stunned!

“This... this aura...”

He widened his eyes and looked at Long Xiaoyun, who was like the chosen one, with a face full of shock.

“This is... Such a terrifying aura. Oh My God, this is... third level of the void interpretation stage. It’s definitely third level of the void interpretation stage. How is this possible? How can the eighth prince have such terrifying strength? !”

“Unbelievable, it’s really unbelievable. How Old is the eighth Prince this year? He actually reached third level of the Void Interpretation Stage!”

The bodies of everyone around trembled. Tens of thousands of people could not help but stand up and stare at Long Xiaoyun in disbelief.

Third level of the profound void tier, this was the third level of the profound void tier.

To reach the third level of the profound void tier at the age of the eighth prince, this was a heaven-defying move.

“This... What kind of opportunity did Xiaoyun obtain?”

The king of the Light Dragon Dynasty’s pupils also slightly contracted, his eyes filled with shock and excitement.

“Third level of the profound void tier, eighth brother has actually reached the third level of the profound void tier!”

Among the group of princes, the strongest long Xiaochen’s eyes were filled with shock, his body could not help but tremble.

Under his imposing manner, the other princes had the urge to kneel down.

Long Xiaotian looked at the figure in front of him. His face was filled with despair.

It’s over!

It’s completely over!

“In the future, I, Long Xiaoyun, will ascend to the peak of the Liuhai Region!”

“In the future, I will kill anyone who stands in my way!”

“If God stands in my way, I will kill God!”

Long Xiaoyun waved his arm. A longsword that was emitting a dazzling white glow appeared in his hand.

“Three seconds are up. Die!”

Long Xiaoyun stared at Wang Xian who was standing there with contempt. The long sword in his hand attacked Wang Xian directly.

Contempt, disregard, everything was revealed!

A dazzling light shot toward Wang Xian. Wang Xian revealed an indifferent expression. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Be careful!”

Long Xiaotian’s grandfather wanted to help Wang Xian to defend.

Clang

However, at this moment, a black sword appeared in Wang Xian’s hand.

He gently pulled out the demon-free sword. The hilt of the sword blocked long Xiaotian’s grandfather who wanted to help him.

He smiled at the old man. The power on the demon-free sword shook slightly.

Bang

An invisible force collided with the bright light. The bright light disappeared immediately.

“Oh? Haha, as expected of someone who can help long Xiaotian ascend to the position of crown prince. He has some strength!”

Long Xiaoyun laughed out loud when he saw Wang Xian blocking his attack.

“I’ve said it before. I’ll help brother Long Xiaotian ascend to the position of crown prince. I, Wang Xian, will definitely fulfill my words!”

Wang Xian stared at Long Xiaoyun with an indifferent smile on his face.

His body moved slightly and he flew directly towards the arena.

Everyone around them watched this scene in silence. The judges and the King of the Light Dragon Empire did not say anything.

The strength and influence that Long Xiaoyun displayed was simply too terrifying.

Even the entire empire had to consider his feelings.

No one said anything.

“With just you, you can not even protect yourself and still dare to be arrogant!”

Long Xiaoyun’s expression turned cold when he heard his words. “I will definitely kill you within three moves!”

As he spoke, he slowly raised the long sword of light in his hand and stared at Wang Xian with contempt.

“With the eighth Prince’s strength, he might be able to kill him in less than three moves!”

“If Wang Xian doesn’t have any heaven-defying treasures on him, he would be able to kill him in one move!”

Everyone looked down and thought to themselves.

The eighth Prince’s strength was too terrifying!

“Die!”

Long Xiaoyun shouted loudly and slashed out with the sword of light in his hand!

“Three moves, that’s a little too much!”

Wang Xian stared at long Xiaoyun without the slightest fluctuation in his eyes.

He waved his arm and a black beam that everyone was familiar with came forward to receive it.
