Chapter 1021: 1022 told them to leave first

Translator: 5496903

“Phew, we’re here. I didn’t expect that our trip to the territory of the winged fish would almost cost us our lives!”

When everyone saw Donghai city not far away, Xia houming heaved a sigh of relief and said with a smile.

“Did you guys get anything?”

Wang Xian asked them.

“No, we didn’t get anything. The territory of the winged fish is too complicated. We’ve been walking around for more than ten hours and didn’t encounter anything at all.”

This time, they stayed in the territory of the wind-wing savage fish for two days. Zhang Yitian shook his head with a bitter expression.

They thought that they would be able to gain something. They didn’t expect that not only did they not gain anything, but there were also two to three sisters who were severely injured.

“I’ll give these to you guys as your reward for bringing me here!”

Wang Xian casually threw them five to six extraordinary level six weapons and armor.

“This...”

Zhang Yitian was stunned for a moment before he took it directly. He looked surprised and asked, “Captain Wang, did you gain anything?”

“I guess so!”

Wang Xian replied indifferently.

“To be able to throw out six extraordinary level-six equipment so casually, and you even said that it was alright. You must have obtained a lot of good stuff!”

Zhang Fengying looked at him and curled her lips. She sized him up from head to toe.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian smiled. This time, he had not only gained a lot, he had also gained a lot!

“At least you have some conscience. Xiao Tian, take it!”

Zhang Fengying felt a little indignant when she saw his smug look.

At the Deep Pit in the cave, she was extremely displeased that Wang Xian had ditched them.

Wang Xian smiled nonchalantly. Xia houming, who was at the side, looked at him with envy.

Wang Xian didn’t give them anything because they were not the ones who sent the invitation.

In short, they had returned empty-handed this time.

“I didn’t expect you to hide it so well. However, you should be more careful in the future. The Yun family has an extraordinary level nine powerhouse!”

Zhang Fengying reminded him.

“Don’t worry. If you have any good missions in the future, you can contact me!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile.

“HMPH, who would still contact you? Eat It All!”

Zhang Fengying glanced at him.

“Hey, you must have heard about the auction in ten days. The Phoenix Elixir and Weapon Workshop, the holy item forging workshop, and the life and Death Elixir Workshop are holding an auction at the same time. This is going to be lively!”

“The items auctioned this time are simply too crazy. Weapons and elixirs of transcendent level nine are being sold!”

“However, it’s obvious that Feng Xian is fighting against the holy relic and life and death. Feng Xian is no match for them at all!”

“It’s hard to say. The power behind Feng Xian is not simple either!”

As soon as he entered the city, Wang Xian heard the discussions around him.

“Auction?”

Wang Xian heard their discussions and recalled what supervisor Yi told him last time.

Feng Xian was going to hold an auction.

However, what he didn’t expect was that the holy item forging workshop and the life and death forging workshop were going to jointly hold an auction.

This was obviously targeted at Feng Xian.

“The three major shops in Donghai City are holding an auction at the same time. Clearly, there is a lot of competition. There should be a lot of treasures in this auction!”

Zhang Fengying also heard the discussions around them and whispered, “It should be considered a relatively big auction event in recent years.”

“We can go and take a look then and buy some treasures!”

Zhang Yitian nodded his head and said.

“HMM, if it’s really a competition between the three big shops, it will be very beneficial to the people of Donghai City!”

Zhang Fengying nodded her head.

“Alright, everyone, I’ll be leaving First!”

Wang Xian said to them.

“Come, let’s leave a message!”

Zhang Fengying walked directly to Wang Xian’s side and said to him.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded and left a communication stone plate mark so that they could contact each other directly in the future.

Wang Xian looked at the bustling streets and hesitated for a moment. Then, he walked straight to the Fengxian Elixir and weapons workshop.

When he arrived at the front of their shop, Wang Xian realized that there were many people entering and exiting the Fengxian Elixir and weapons workshop. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

There wasn’t a single person in the store compared to the last time. This made a huge difference.

There was a signboard at the entrance of Fengxian’s store. It announced that Fengxian would be holding a grand auction in ten days.

Wang Xian looked over and walked straight in.

The staff members in the store were busy and didn’t notice Wang Xian’s arrival.

“Is your supervisor Yi Here?”

Wang Xian walked straight to a staff member and asked him.

“Eh? Supervisor Yi... Young Master Wang, it’s you. Our Supervisor Yi and the manager have gone out. Please come in, please come in!”

When the staff member saw Wang Xian, he immediately greeted him with a warm expression and said respectfully.

This young man in front of them was their master. Regardless of whether it was the manager or supervisor Yi, they had to be more careful in the future.

“Our manager Yi will be here soon. Young Master, please take a seat inside!”

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded and walked inside.

“Young master, Please, let me pour you some tea!”

The staff invited Wang Xian to the living room inside and gestured to him.

Wang Xian entered and realized that there were other people inside.

Three girls and a young man.

These three girls looked extremely beautiful. There was a special aura about them.

The young man was also very handsome.

The four of them had a hint of arrogance on their faces.

Eleven Golden Swordfish followed him in. Wang Xian found a seat and sat down. Ao Jian and the rest stood at the side.

“Young master, please wait here for a while!”

The staff member said enthusiastically.

“Eh? Wait!”

Suddenly, the young man in the room saw Wang Xian and the rest enter. He waved his hand and said, “We have something important to discuss here. Let them leave First!”

“Young master Huo! This...”

When the staff member heard the young man’s words, he was obviously very stunned. He quickly said.

“Didn’t you hear what I Said?”

The young man interrupted him directly and said coldly.

“This...”

When the staff member heard his words, he revealed an embarrassed expression.

He looked at Wang Xian with an apologetic expression. “Young Master Wang, I’m sorry. Why Don’t you wait outside first? or I can tell supervisor Yi and manager Yi later.”

“Who are they?”

Wang Xian frowned slightly.

As an important customer of Feng Xian, he was actually chased out from the shop. This made him extremely displeased.

If this wasn’t Feng Luan’s shop, would he help Feng Xian this much?

“They... They are people from our shop!”

The staff member said with a bad expression.

“Is this how the people from your shop treat their customers?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and looked at the young man in the room.

“Customers? As long as we have good stuff, we won’t be short of customers. The so-called customers are just each having their own needs. HMPH, hurry up and get out!”

When the young man heard Wang Xian’s words, an impatient look appeared on his face as he said coldly.
