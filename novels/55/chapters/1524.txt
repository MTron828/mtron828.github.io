Chapter 1525: 1,525 calls spread across thousands of miles

“Uncle Hu!”

In the room of the Holy Medicine Clinic, Wang Xian looked at the heart in front of him and asked, “How can we receive more patients who have been corroded by the Darkness?”

“More patients?”

Old Hu looked at Wang Xian and said, “It’s very simple to receive more patients who have been corroded by the darkness. Free Treatment?”

“But if you treat them for free, wouldn’t that be too...”

As he spoke, he looked at Wang Xian. Treating anyone for free. With his ability, almost all the patients within a few thousand miles would rush over.

No one would treat all the patients for free so mercifully.

Moreover, doing so would offend other medical centers.

“What if I want to treat those who don’t have the money to do so for free?”

Wang Xian looked at the banner that the family of three had sent over and said with a smile.

“HMM? Treat people who don’t have the money to do so for free? That’s possible. There are many people who have done such things in the past!”

“I can look for the owner and ask him to release this news. However, there might be some people who will pretend that they don’t have the money!”

Old Hu said to Wang Xian.

“I can determine if they have the ability to pay. Uncle Hu, please announce the news to the public!”

Wang Xian said with a twinkle in his eyes.

“Alright. After a night of publicity, there will be many patients coming over for treatment tomorrow. You have to make some preparations!”

Old Hu nodded at Wang Xian.

He nodded.

Treating people who were invaded by darkness was also treating oneself.

Using light to cure darkness could bring forward the balance of the heart of Light and darkness.

After Old Hu left, he informed the owner of the news of treating the poor for free.

The owner was very surprised by Wang Xian’s action. However, he hesitated for a moment before nodding his head.

The free treatment was carried out in the Holy Medicine Clinic. It was a great boost to the reputation of the holy medicine clinic.

That night, the news that the Holy Medicine Clinic had a light priest at the insightful emptiness realm to treat all those who could not afford the treatment was spread out.

This news immediately attracted the attention of countless people.

Around the ruins of the divine kingdom, there were at least hundreds of millions of people who relied on the ruins of the divine kingdom to survive.

Although most of them were strong, most of them were below the insightful emptiness realm.

Many people had entered the ruins of the divine kingdom and the forest of the divine kingdom. They suffered from the erosion of the darkness and left some hidden injuries in their bodies.

Not everyone had the money to cure themselves and find a radiant priest.

The number of people who died from the erosion of the darkness every year was no less than a million.

Now that the Holy Medicine Shop had a radiant priest at the insightful void level to treat them for free, it was a very big deal for many people.

When it was just nighttime, there was already a queue of people coming to the entrance of the Holy Medicine Hall.

“This time, the free treatment is given by our Holy Medicine Hall’s Reverend Wang. Reverend Wang treats people from eight to five in the morning every day. It’s useless for you to wait now!”

At night, the two female receptionists of the Holy Medicine Hall shouted at the people lining up at the entrance.

“It’s alright, ladies. We’ll wait here until tomorrow, Reverend Wang!”

“That’s right. There are already so many people here. There will be even more tomorrow. We don’t know how many people Reverend Wang can treat in a day or how many days he can last. We don’t have any spirit stones to treat them, so it’s fine even if we wait now!”

“I wonder who this Reverend Wang is. Why haven’t I heard of him before? He’s really a good person!”

“That’s right, that’s right. This leg of mine was bitten by a dark demon beast two years ago. At that time, I didn’t have any spirit stones to heal it, so I missed the best time to heal it. As a result, if you want to heal it again, you’ll have to find a master at the insightful emptiness realm to do it. But a master at the insightful emptiness realm, how could I have so much money!”

In front of the entrance of the Holy Medicine Clinic, a group of people were discussing in front.

“Pastor Wang is so kind-hearted. I heard from afar that he is very handsome. I wonder if I can meet him during the day when I am working!”

“I will apply for a day job in a few days. I want to go and see Pastor Wang!”

The two beautiful female receptionists saw the discussion of the group of people in front of them and whispered to each other. Their eyes would look towards the fourth floor from time to time.

“There are quite a number of people?”

The next morning, when Wang Xian woke up and came to the balcony, he saw a few hundred people lined up below. He revealed a surprised expression and a smile slowly appeared on his face.

“Pastor Wang, there are already many patients gathered below. Do you want them to come up?”

Not long after, Old Hu walked over on time and asked Wang Xian.

“Ten people at once. Let them come up!”

Wang Xian nodded and said directly.

“Alright!”

Lao Hu nodded and walked out.

Soon, a girl who looked very happy walked in with ten people.

“Reverend Wang, the people are here!”

The girl said sweetly and looked at Wang Xian with her watery eyes.

“Everyone, come in!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and swept his gaze across the ten healers.

He could tell that they were not in a good condition.

“Reverend Wang, thank you for treating us for free!”

The group of people were slightly surprised when they saw how young Wang Xian was. However, they quickly bowed.

“There’s no need!”

Wang Xian looked at them and started to examine their bodies with his dragon eyes.

“The three of you, take a step forward First!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Wang Xian pointed at the two middle-aged elders and said.

“Yes, yes!”

The three of them took two steps forward nervously.

“Your injuries are not serious!”

As he spoke, he waved his arm and a beam of light energy landed on their bodies.

Buzz

The light covered their entire bodies. Wang Xian stared at them intently.

“HMM? I wasted some light energy!”

Wang Xian shook his head slightly when he saw this situation.

“Oh my God, the dark toxins in my body have been removed. It’s... Reverend Wang, you have been removed with a wave of your arm. Thank you, sir! Thank you, Sir!”

The three of them immediately felt that the dark energy that had been tormenting them had been removed. They knelt down in excitement.

They kowtowed to Wang Xian and thanked him.

“Be careful in the future. I will only treat you once for free!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly and looked at the other six people.

“The two of you!”

Wang Xian pointed at the two middle-aged men who had lost their arms.

“Yes, Sir!”

The two of them walked over directly. Wang Xian also used the power of light to cover them and used the regeneration of the broken limbs.

While the broken limbs were regenerating, he was carefully sensing the power of light.

“Thank you, sir! Thank you, Sir!”

The two of them knelt on the ground and shouted loudly in gratitude.

This caused the other five people to be extremely excited and their bodies were trembling.

“The five of you, let’s Go Together!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and the power of light enveloped them, slowly removing the power of darkness from their bodies.

“Alright, ten more people!”
