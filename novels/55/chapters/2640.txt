2641 2641 imperial court

“Wow, what a beautiful sword!”

Princess di Xing’s eyes lit up when she saw the dragon blood sword that was handed over by a member of the Dragon Palace!

Wang Xian looked at her and smiled. Then, he handed the sword to her!

“This is the sword that I traded with someone. I didn’t expect him to be dead. Now that the sword has been sent over by them, I’ll give it to you!”

Wang Xian smiled and said faintly. Then, he handed the sharp sword in his hand to princess di Xing!

“Humph, Humph. Although it’s a little unlucky, I’ll accept it reluctantly!”

Lady di Xing could naturally recognize the power of this sword. However, to her, Wang Xian was a nouveau riche. Since it was a gift from a nouveau riche, she naturally wanted it!

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian said to her. He immediately used energy to wrap her and Aunt Ying and flew quickly toward the moonrise star!

The Moonrise Star was the largest planet in the great sect of the last month. It was also the most prosperous planet!

From here, one could teleport to a planet in the central imperial court and then transfer from there!

“Master!”

However, when Wang Xian passed by the location of the bei Chuan sect, bei Shuang sensed him and immediately flew over!

“Master, where are you going?”

Bei Shuang asked Wang Xian curiously!

“To the central island imperial court. I’ll leave the matters here to Prime Minister Gui and the heaven’s formation. This time, it might take more than half a month!”

Wang Xian looked at bei Shuang, paused slightly and said to her!

“Are we going to the imperial court of the Central Island?”

Bei Shuang looked a little absent-minded. It was obvious that she had thought of something. Then, she raised her head and said, “Master, I’m Going Too!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Huh? You’re going too?”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned and looked at her in astonishment!

“We’re going to settle some grudges!”

A cold glint flashed in bei Shuang’s eyes. Obviously, this was something that happened in the past!

“Alright, let’s do it together!”

Wang Xian nodded his head!

“Congratulations, Miss bei Shuang. The favored daughter of the heavens has returned!”

Auntie Ying looked at bei Shuang deeply and said with a smile!

“Okay!”

Bei Shuang nodded at Auntie Ying and the Imperial Star Ladies!

“Auntie Ying, do you know her?”

Bei Shuang had stayed in the Dragon Palace for more than a year, but she had not spoken to any of the girls in the past year, much less the Imperial Star Lady!

And the imperial star lady did not know bei Shuang!

Seeing Auntie Ying congratulate bei Shuang, the imperial star lady could not help but ask through voice transmission!

“I’ve heard of her reputation before. When the current emperor of the imperial court courted her, something happened!”

Aunt Ying transmitted her voice to Imperial Star Lady!

“Oh? Is That So?”

Imperial Star Lady had not been born at that time and did not know what had happened more than 30,000 years ago!

In the imperial court, five thousand years had turned into a generation. This was something that had happened six or seven generations ago!

Imperial Star Lady had also learned about bei Shuang’s rise through the AI. However, she did not know about the gossip between bei Shuang and the Emperor of the imperial court!

In every generation, the strongest man and strongest woman in the younger generation of the imperial court would be called the Emperor and the Empress!

This was the highest title of this generation!

It was also the highest honor!

“This time, I want to become the Empress!”

The Imperial Star Lady Muttered to herself as a determined look appeared in her eyes!

“We’re Here!”

Soon, everyone arrived at the inviting Moon Planet. Wang Xian said!

“Master, the teleportation formation is over here!”

As bei Shuang spoke, she led the way and flew towards the location of the teleportation formation!

“Dragon King, goddess of Frost!”

At the teleportation formation, the disciples of the great sect from last month who were guarding the place called out respectfully!

One of them was the leader of the Dragon Palace who became famous in a single battle while the other was the famous goddess of frost. Such an expert would be respected even if he was not from the great sect from last month!

“Okay!”

Bei Shuang nodded and the four of them entered the teleportation array!

...

They arrived at a planet quickly through the teleportation array and began to transit under the guidance of the Imperial Star Lady!

They only stopped after five hours!

It was easy to imagine how big the imperial court of the Central Island was!

The Imperial Star Field, a big central island, three small islands, and other galaxies!

The central island alone took up 3/5 of the entire Emperor Star Field!

And in this central area, the Emperor Court took up another 70% of the planets!

The AI recorded that the number of life planets directly under the Emperor Court’s control reached over 15 billion!

Over 15 billion life planets, what kind of concept was that?

The two furthest planets, if one relied on flight, even a pinnacle emperor God level warrior would need decades to fly!

As for the strength of the imperial court, it was even harder to fathom!

At the very least, there were at least two to three million immortal king level powerhouses!

...

This was the power of the ruler of the entire Imperial Star Field!

Back in the Battle of the Fallen Emperor, more than 100,000 immortal king level powerhouses had perished in the inter-domain war that turned into the Witch Association. These 100,000 immortal king level powerhouses were all at least level 6 immortal king level!

“This is the Imperial Court Island!”

The Voice of the Imperial Star Lady rang out. Wang Xian, who was at the side, scanned his surroundings with a slightly awe-inspiring expression!

The core of the imperial court was not on a planet, but an incomparably huge island!

The Void Island was a huge piece of land!

As for how big the entire island was, Wang Xian could not see the end of it at all!

“The area of the imperial court island is huge. It will take a month for a powerhouse at the peak of the Immortal King Realm to fly from one side to the other!”

The Imperial Star Lady introduced to Wang Xian!

Wang Xian was slightly speechless!

Is this the imperial court?

There were thousands of planets in the entire Northern line. From the first to the last one, it would take about a day for Wang Xian to fly there!

However, even a peak-stage king God would need a day to fly here!

It was vast and boundless!

The entire land mass and large-scale island could rival the southern star system!

It was so terrifying!

“The imperial court island is divided into the inner island and the outer island. The Inner Island is not the core disciple of the imperial court. Only those who have reached the immortal godly king level can enter!”

The Imperial Star Lady continued to introduce to Wang Xian!

He nodded his head slightly!

“Let’s go. I’ll bring you to My Place!”

After returning to the Imperial Court Island, the Imperial Star Lady was obviously very happy. She immediately walked to the teleportation formation at the side and waved at Wang Xian!

“The imperial court is very big. We can teleport here. Of course, we can also use the void tunnel. The speed of teleportation is faster and the price is higher too!”

The Imperial Star Lady Smiled as she spoke. The few of them disappeared immediately!

“This is the Inner Island!”

Soon, the four of them appeared in a vast square!

Wang Xian’s eyes were shining as he looked ahead!

In front of him, there was an incomparably huge palace!

Looking at the towering palace in front of him, Wang Xian felt as though his body had shrunk by a few hundred times!

The palace was towering into the clouds. Every pillar was estimated to be hundreds of thousands of meters tall!

Just a single hall was already tens of thousands of meters tall!

The pillars were propped up one by one, making one feel extremely tiny!

A vast energy was transmitted from the direction of the palace!

Even though Wang Xian was hundreds of millions of kilometers away from the palace, he could still feel it clearly!
