“Hong!”

Just when everyone thought that the Black Earth tribe and the dead tribe had started to fight.

An aura that caused everyone to feel despair suddenly attacked!

This terrifying aura covered the sky and the Sun.

It far surpassed the power of the Black Earth tribe and the dead tribe warriors on the stage.

“Get Down, get down!”

Around the stage, all the warriors of the tribes sensed this terrifying power and shouted in fear!

This terrifying power could crush a universe knight to death!

It was fortunate that the warriors of the various tribes were able to defend themselves, allowing the disciples below the universe ruler realm to survive.

Even so, those universe ruler realm warriors were breathing heavily, and their foreheads were covered in cold sweat.

What kind of enemy was this?

“It’s the Heavenly Yuan creation realm experts from other universes!”

“Fight them!”

The expressions of the peak universe masters from the Black Earth tribe and the death tribe changed drastically when they saw the seven figures flying over, and they hurriedly shouted!

At this moment, they gave up on both sides and faced the outside together!

Facing the outside enemy, they didn’t hesitate at all. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Earth core, open!”

A peak universe overlord from the mysterious Earth tribe didn’t hesitate at all. He took out a treasure and placed it on the ground, punching it.

“Hong!”

In the next moment, an incomparably huge defense rose up on the stage, forming an incomparably strong defense!

“Break the defense!”

The figures that flew over were naturally the seven heavenly fate realm experts.

Seeing the defense that rose up instantly, their eyes focused as weapons appeared in their hands one by one.

“Boom!”

“Boom Boom Boom!”

Following that, all sorts of attacks landed on the Earth’s core defense!

“Crack Crack Crack!”

When the attacks landed on the surface, the Earth’s core defense did not collapse immediately.

However, even so, huge cracks appeared on the circular defense that covered the entire arena!

The entire defense could only sustain two more attacks!

“Oh no!”

“All seven of them are heavenly yuan creation realm experts from other universes. All peak-stage universe masters, block them!”

The expression of the peak universe masters of the Black Earth tribe changed drastically when they saw this scene. Immediately, they roared out loud!

This Earth core defense was set up by the Heavenly Yuan creation realm experts of their black Earth tribe!

Now, a huge crack had appeared on the other party’s Attack!

This scene caused them to be shocked!

“Block! All Peak Universe Masters, block them!”

The peak ruler-level powerhouses of the Dead Tribe also roared!

There were more than 100 million disciples of the tribes around the arena. Among them, there were more than 10 peak ruler-level powerhouses other than the two tribes!

These were the peak powerhouses of the other tribes.

They didn’t refuse the orders of the Black Earth tribe and the dead tribe!

The current order of the Heavenly Yuan creation realm experts was to fight against the invaders from the other universes in unison!

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The top-tier experts instantly floated in the sky with weapons in their hands as they stared at the seven heavenly yuan creation realm experts outside.

Everything happened in an instant.

Tianci’s identity was exposed.

The Great Beings of the Black Earth tribe and the dead tribe attacked, and seven powerful intruders arrived.

Everything happened in an instant.

Tian Ci’s pupils shrank slightly when he saw this scene.

Only at this moment did he realize how fatal an attraction he had to the other great beings.

Even the great beings of the six paths universe wanted to attack him!

This made him look a bit embarrassed!

“Black Earth tribe, death tribe, I have merged with the heavenly creation true treasure. Do you still want to kill me and take the heavenly creation true treasure?”

Tianci looked at the top-tier Great Beings of the Black Earth tribe and death tribe and asked with an ugly expression.

He felt bad that the Great Beings of the same universe wanted to kill him and take the heavenly creation true treasure!

Was the six paths universe still his universe?

“Your life belongs to the six paths universe. The three lords will make the decision. Stand there and don’t move. Otherwise, I will kill you immediately.”

A peak ruler of the Black Earth tribe glanced at Tianci and said with a dark face!

After saying that, he looked at the seven heavenly creation great beings in front of him and quickly passed the news to their black Earth tribe’s Lord Tianyuan creation!

When Tianci heard the words of the powerhouse from the Xuan Tu tribe, he looked extremely embarrassed.

This was the answer given to him by the powerhouses from the six paths universe.

As long as he dared to act rashly, he would be killed immediately!

His face was filled with bitterness.

At this moment, all the powerhouses’disciples from the surrounding tribes reacted slightly. When they saw this sudden scene, they were slightly shocked!

“You want to kill Tianci?”

Wang Xian, who had been standing in front of the arena, was not surprised at all when he saw this scene.

However, when he heard the words of the Xuan Tu tribe’s expert at the peak of the Universe Dominator realm, he raised his eyebrows slightly!

He opened his mouth and spoke calmly. His figure disappeared at the same time and appeared beside the expert at the peak of the Universe Dominator realm.

Before the expert who was at the peak of the universe dominator could react, he saw a figure suddenly appear beside him. He was stunned!

“You don’t know whether you are dead or Alive!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with coldness and killing intent as he stared at him.

In the next moment, he waved his arm and his palm turned into a dragon claw. He held it in his hand.

His life force was gone in an instant!

Instant Kill!

Then, as if nothing had happened, he quietly landed on the stage!

The sudden change, the sudden change, once again caused everyone to be stupefied!

Especially the experts surrounding the peak ruler of the Black Earth tribe, the dead tribe and the other peak ruler experts!

Before they could react, an expert of the same level was actually killed just like that!

This caused them to be filled with shock!

What kind of existence was this.

“You are also an expert of the heaven origin creation realm from the other universes!”

An expert at the peak of the Dominator realm from the tribe of the dead shouted loudly with a face full of shock!

Nearly twenty experts at the peak of the Dominator realm hurriedly got close to each other and stared at Wang Xian. Their faces were filled with shock!

“Let me introduce myself. I am the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace from the nine-origin universe.”

Wang Xian looked at them and said calmly!

“The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace from the nine-origin Universe?”

At this moment, at the Mu Li tribe, Mu Liyin er, her father, brother, and all the strong disciples of the Mu Li tribe seemed to have a sudden flash of lightning in their minds!

“He... he...”

Mu Li Yin ‘er was tongue-tied and couldn’t believe it!

The young man he saved was actually an expert from another universe.

A heavenly yuan destiny realm expert!
