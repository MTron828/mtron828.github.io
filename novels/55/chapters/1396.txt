Chapter 1397: The members of the 1397 Dragon Palace came to pick up the brothers and bring them home

The eldest sister and second brother of the Gilded Gold clan came to their parents and saw the angry young city lord. They walked over and whispered.

“Forget it! Forget it!”

The Gilded Gold clan leader waved his hand and looked at the young city Lord. He bowed respectfully and said, “Everything is up to the young city Lord!”

The Gilded Gold clan had always been in the middle of the two forces, although he also wanted his daughter to marry Duan Jinming.

But now that the young castellan had spoken, he could no longer resist.

Moreover, it was a very good choice for his third daughter to marry into the Liu residence!

As for the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, how could it be compared to Xiao Yao City?

“Hehe, that’s more like it!”

When the young castellan saw the gilded gold family agreeing, he raised his head slightly and stared at Wang Xian with disdain.

“Father, I don’t agree. I don’t want to marry into the Liu family. I don’t want to be his concubine. I don’t agree!”

When gilded voice heard her father’s words, she panicked.

She looked at her father anxiously and said loudly.

“It’s your fortune to be his concubine. You really treat yourself like a treasure. It seems that I have to teach you a good lesson in the future!”

Liu Shaohua’s face was extremely gloomy when he heard gilded voice saying loudly that she didn’t want to marry him.

Today, because of the incident with Liu Jinyan, the Liu family had already lost face.

In the future, he would definitely let Liu Jinyan know how powerful he was!

“Father, mother, I don’t agree. I want to marry Brother Jinming. I don’t agree...” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Tears flowed down from Liu Jinyan’s eyes when he heard Liu Shaohua’s words.

Liu Shaohua’s words were naturally heard by Liu Jinyan’s patriarch and Madam Jinyan. They turned their faces to the side.

“Yanyan, young master Liu is also a good man. Don’t cry. be obedient. Parents will make the decision regarding marriage. This matter is settled!”

Lady Gilded Gold said with a cold face.

“No, I don’t agree either. Third Miss Belongs to me!”

Duan Jinming, who was standing at the side, also became anxious. He shouted loudly.

“Humph, a lowly demonic beast race from Xiaoyao City. Do you really think that you’ve climbed onto a high branch? Do you dare to look down on us?”

Liu Shaohua stared at Duan Jinming with a ferocious expression and said coldly.

Wang Xian stood at the side and frowned slightly. He shook his head slowly.

He didn’t expect the gilded gold family to be so cowardly.

“Gilded Gold Yan, if I let you go with Jin Ming, would you be willing?”

Wang Xian looked at Gilded Gold Yan and asked expressionlessly.

“HMM? Young Master from the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, we have already decided on the matter of Yanyan. I hope that you won’t disturb us!”

Since the young city Lord had already made the decision, they naturally wouldn’t waver.

“I’m willing. I don’t want to marry him. I want to be with brother Jin Ming!”

Jin Jin Yan looked at his parents and siblings with an embarrassed expression and said resolutely.

“That’s simple then. Jin Ming, bring them and let’s Go!”

Wang Xian waved his hand and greeted Duan Jin Ming.

Duan Jin Ming was slightly taken aback. Following that, he gritted his teeth and appeared beside Jin Jin Yan in an instant.

“Third lady, come with me. I Won’t let you marry someone else!”

He stared into Jin Jin Yan’s eyes and said firmly.

“Okay!”

Jin Jin Yan nodded his head heavily.

Everyone around was dumbfounded.

What the hell was going on all of a sudden? Snatching the marriage?

This was in broad daylight!

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian said to Duan Jinming indifferently.

“What? What... What are you guys trying to do?”

The leader of the gilded gold tribe was dumbfounded. When he saw Duan Jinming leaving with his daughter, his expression changed drastically as he shouted loudly.

“Stop! Stop right there!”

The Liu residence, the young master of the city, and everyone else were stunned. They shouted loudly with an embarrassed expression.

“Rest assured, the gilded gold family. I will get Jin Ming to bring your daughter to visit occasionally. I will give you the gifts!”

Wang Xian waved his hand indifferently and said with a smile on his face.

The faces of the gilded gold family members turned black.

The words of a matchmaker ordered by their parents?

It seemed that after they had said so much, their daughter was still going to marry Duan Jinming?

What kind of matchmaker’s words were those of his parents? Others would just take him away.

Most importantly, his daughter was still following them!

What the F * ck...

“Stop them!”

The young castellan shouted at the people around him with a livid expression.

“Stop right there!”

“Gilded Gold family, aren’t you going to stop them?”

The people from the Liu residence walked to the front of Wang Xian and the rest with gloomy expressions.

They looked at the gilded gold family who was standing there in a daze and shouted sternly.

“Let go of my daughter! Yanyan, stop right there!”

The Chief and Madam of the Gilded Gold family were also flustered as they walked over and shouted loudly.

“Get out of my way!”

Wang Xian’s face turned cold when he saw the people from the Liu residence and the gilded gold family who were blocking his way.

“Dragon and Phoenix Empire, don’t go too far. Now, the gilded gold family has agreed to marry me. She is now my fiancée. Don’t even think about taking her away!”

Liu Shaohua stared at Wang Xian with a ferocious expression.

His fiancée had been taken away by another man. How would he be able to survive in Xiao Yao City in the future?

“I’m not your fiancée. I’m leaving with brother Jin Ming willingly!”

Gilded Gold glared at Liu Shaohua angrily as he shouted.

“Let’s go. Whoever dares to stop us, we’ll take action immediately!”

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and revealed a faint smile.

Clang

After he finished speaking, ao Jian and the golden swordfish behind him pulled out the sharp swords in their hands. A terrifying aura rushed towards their surroundings.

Ring, Ring

Following that, a special sound was heard.

The Bamboo Mountain sect, who was standing beside Wang Xian, took out a bamboo sword and stared at the surroundings coldly.

Wang Xian looked over and saw the middle-aged man in a wide robe smiling at him.

“This... What the F * ck? A marriage proposal actually caused such a ruckus!”

“That young man from the Dragon and Phoenix Empire is really overbearing. He even got someone to take away the third young miss of the Gilded Gold Family!”

“Hehe, this is interesting. The young city Lord and the Liu family were able to make the gilded gold family marry their daughter over, but the third young miss of the Gilded Gold family didn’t agree. She directly left with someone else. This isn’t considered kidnapping, right?”

“Hiss, what a powerful aura. Among the group of people from the dragon-phoenix Empire and the Bamboo Mountain sect, there are three or four insightful void tier 3 experts. The surrounding people really can’t stop them!”

“The most important thing is that they didn’t violate the rules of Xiaoyao City!”

When the surrounding people saw this scene, they were discussing in astonishment.

“You... you guys...”

When the Liu residence and the gilded gold family saw Wang Xian and the rest taking out their weapons, they looked extremely embarrassed.

With their strength, there was no way they could stop them.

“Dragon-phoenix Empire, I’m warning you once again. This is not a place where you can be impudent!”

The young city Lord stood at the back. His eyes were filled with intense killing intent as he growled in a low voice.

“Who do you think you are? Let’s go. I’ll see who dares to stop us!”

Wang Xian walked forward without even turning his head.
