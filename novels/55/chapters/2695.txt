“Kill!”

“Roar Roar Roar!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

When the members of the Dragon Palace roared, the abyssal seed in the Abyss had already noticed the arrival of the experts of the Dragon Palace.

In the center, there was a huge peak-stage king God abyssal seed with four huge bone wings.

The humanoid abyssal seed with blood-red eyes raised its head and roared angrily.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Ga Ga Ga!”

In the next moment, the hundreds of millions of abyssal seeds in the Abyss stared at the members of the Dragon Palace and let out a bloodthirsty roar.

“Dragon Palace Immortal King Level 9 member, lock onto Immortal King Level 9 abyssal seed.”

“Leader last month, each of the four of you can pin down one of them. All you need to do is to pin them down!”

“The rest of you can act as you wish!”

Wang Xian stood on the command platform. When he saw countless pairs of cold eyes staring at them, he immediately gave the order.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Beside him, the people from the great sect of last month immediately nodded their heads. Their eyes swept across the members of the Dragon Palace and finally landed in the abyss in front of them.

“Shoot!”

When the Dragon Peak arrived at the edge, Mu Zesen’s order sounded.

“Sou Sou Sou!”

In the next moment, countless arrows shot forward.

“Howl Howl Howl!”

Within the Abyss, the two Pinnacle Undying Emperor Abyss seeds roared simultaneously.

“Rumble Rumble Rumble!”

In the center, tens of millions of abyss seeds opened their mouths wide and unleashed terrifying attacks.

“Rumble Rumble Rumble!”

The first terrifying clash resounded.

And at this time, Long Feng had completely entered the abyss.

“Lock onto two pinnacle undying god King Abyss species!”

Prime Minister Gui’s voice resounded, they controlled the world end ruler and instantly rushed to the front, a gust of wind attribute energy shot towards one pinnacle undying god King Abyss species.

“Sou Sou Sou!”

Behind them, three thorn monsters formed from arrays followed closely behind, attacking the bone winged abyss species and the human shaped abyss species.

“Howl Howl Howl!”

The two Pinnacle Undying Emperor Abyss seeds saw Prime Minister Gui and the others charging towards them, their faces filled with rage as they rushed forward to receive them.

The terrifying black wings swept across the energy laws of the Sky Horizon Ruler, destroying it.

Prime Minister Gui controlled the Sky Horizon ruler and could only unleash the power of a normal Pinnacle Undying Emperor, against a Pinnacle Undying Emperor Abyss seed alone, he was definitely not a match.

Sou Sou Sou

However, at this time, three thorny monsters caught up and attacked the two peak immortal king level abyss seeds.

“Roar!”

The two peak immortal King Level Abyss seeds immediately went to meet them and unleashed terrifying power.

“It’s our turn!”

Wang Xian saw the two peak immortal king level abyss seeds being entangled and licked his lips. A strong battle intent appeared in his eyes as he moved.

“Let’s go, Ao Yao, we’ll swiftly kill an undyings level 9 abyss seed!”

As he spoke, he flew out and locked onto an undyings level 9 abyss seed within the Abyss.

Behind him, the 19 undyings from the Dragon Palace followed.

“No wonder the dragon palace is confident in using the power of the Dragon Palace to wipe out the abyss races here!”

The four of them looked at the top level warriors of the Dragon Palace and sucked in a cold breath before following behind.

After seeing so many warriors of the Dragon Palace, they had already decided that they would respect the Dragon Palace in the future.

“Rumble Rumble Rumble!”

Around them, the undying level 8 warriors of the Dragon Palace began to move, there were over 60 of them.

Every single one of them exuded a powerful aura as they attacked the undying level 8 abyssal beasts.

Bei Chuan Leader, the Dragon Python group and the ancient God looked at the number of level 8 warriors of the Dragon Palace, their faces filled with bitterness.

The total number of level 8 warriors from their three forces was only about a dozen, while the Dragon Palace had over 60.

If the Dragon Palace wanted to destroy them, it would be too easy.

However, it was not enough for them to see the level 9 immortal king combat strength members of the Dragon Palace. They fell silent again.

With such a Dragon Palace, they were invincible on the Demon Island.

...

“Kill!”

They did not hesitate at all. They charged straight into the Abyss and assisted the members of the Dragon Palace to attack the level 8 abyssal seeds one by one.

“Roar!”

At the front, a level nine immortal king abyssal seed saw Wang Xian locking onto it. It raised its head instantly and stared at Wang Xian with murderous intent.

It extended its sharp claws and welcomed Wang Xian directly.

This was a very strange abyssal seed. There were dozens of claws on its body, each of which was thousands of meters in size. It looked ferocious and terrifying.

“Dragon Claw!”

Wang Xian stretched out his arm and transformed it into a dragon claw. He attacked the level 9 immortal king abyssal seed.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

The Dragon Claw collided with the Abyssal Seed’s claw, producing the sound of metal colliding.

“Roar, Roar, Roar!”

...

The level 9 immortal king abyssal seed sensed the collision force. It didn’t take a step back and let out a violent roar.

Boom! Boom! Boom

At this moment, terrifying sounds of collision could be heard from the surroundings.

The powerhouses from the Dragon Palace and the group of Abyss seed powerhouses collided with each other.

“The strength of the abyss seed is not weak. I have to finish off this one as soon as possible.”

Wang Xian pursed his lips. A cold glint flashed in his eyes.

In a battle of the same level, if it was a one-on-one, the difference was not too great. Even if it was a big battle for a few years, there would still be no victor.

Therefore, Wang Xian had to finish off the one in front of him as soon as possible.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The Abyss with dozens of claws did not feel any threat from Wang Xian. It pounced on him ferociously. This time, it waved its claws at the same time. It was extremely ferocious.

“Ao Yao, Get Ready!”

Wang Xian shouted in a low voice. The immortal slaying Calabash appeared directly in front of his chest.

“Although it’s a little wasteful, it can prevent the loss of the members of the Dragon Palace.”

He muttered and opened the calabash lid.

Buzz

The next moment, a small sharp sword appeared in front of Wang Xian.

Whoosh

Wang Xian’s heart skipped a beat. The sharp sword instantly attacked the abyssal seed that was attacking him.

Roar! Roar

The instant the sharp sword appeared, a hint of panic appeared in the pupils of the abyssal seed that had dozens of claws.

Its powerful senses made it seem like it was about to die.

Sou

Rumble

However, as an immortal slaying gourd that was comparable to a pinnacle undying emperor’s attack, even though the Undying Level 9 abyss seed had already dodged and the sword had already entered its body.., the terrifying power immediately sliced off a third of its body.

That third of his body instantly lost its life force.

“Howl Howl!”

A scream came from his mouth, large amounts of blood flowed out of his body, his eyes filled with rage and fear.

“Pu!”

However at this time, Ao Yao appeared behind him, his claws piercing into his body.

Kill!
