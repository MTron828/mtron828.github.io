Chapter 3211: The 3210 Heavenly Dragon Roared, and the Starriver clan submitted

“The clan leader is here!”

“Clan leader!”

Countless palaces in the Starriver clan’s headquarters were destroyed by the Sky Sea Dragon King.

When the experts and disciples saw the clan leader of the Starriver clan with the Red Sun on his head, they were excited.

The Sky Sea Dragon King had the combat strength of a level four universe knight, and their clan leader also had the combat strength of a level four universe knight.

As long as their clan leader arrived, they would be able to stop Sky Sea Dragon King.

“Clan leader of the Starriver clan, hurry up and submit to this Dragon King!”

Sky Sea Dragon King heard the words of the clan leader of the Starriver clan and looked at him coldly.

Looking at the clan leader of the Starriver clan with the Red Sun above his head, he was still full of power.

“Back then, my clan leader had already guessed that there might be a true dragon in Sky Sea Dragon Palace, and there really is one. However, at this moment, it seems that you can no longer be called a true dragon.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“A true dragon wouldn’t kill Innocents, and a true dragon wouldn’t have such a body.”

The head of the Xingjiang clan glanced around with a cold expression.

Sensing the thick smell of blood, his expression was extremely ugly.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“You’re courting death. In a while, it’ll be time for you to crawl under me.”

Hearing his words, the Sky Sea Dragon King’s eyes shot out terrifying killing intent as he flapped his wings and attacked the head of the Xingjiang clan.

“HMPH!”

“The one who wants to die is you!”

The Xingjiang clan’s patriarch snorted coldly. With a wave of his arm, he heavily punched the scarlet sun above his head.

The entire scarlet sun was like a volcano erupting as it directly met the Tianhai Dragon King!

“You dare to fight me with a broken Houtian Numinous Treasure?”

When the Tianhai Dragon King saw this incomparably huge scarlet sun, the crown on his head flew out, and the blades on it slowly grew larger.

Finally, the blade released a terrifying golden color, and golden light filled the sky as it flew toward the Red Sun.

“We must win! We must win!”

“With our clan leader’s power, we will definitely win. Even if we can’t win, we can still pin him down!”

“We are ready to help our clan leader fight against that Brutal Sky Sea Dragon King!”

At this time, more than 200 universe knights of the Starriver clan had gathered around.

They looked at the battle between their clan leader and Sky Sea Dragon King with anger and anxiety, ready to join the battle at any time.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

At this time, the terrifying golden blade and scarlet sun clashed.

The incomparably sharp and terrifying blade and sword directly entered scarlet sun under the shocked gaze of the Starriver clan’s clan leader.

“Peng!”

The entire scarlet sun emitted an intense sound as cracks appeared on its surface.

“What! ?”

When the Xingjiang clan’s patriarch saw that the scarlet sun actually had cracks, his expression changed slightly.

“Clang, Clang, Clang!”

However, what made him even more terrified was that the terrifying golden blade and sword pierced through the scarlet sun and attacked him.

“Not good, what kind of treasure is this? This is absolutely not an acquired numinous treasure. This is an existence at the level of an acquired Supreme Treasure.”

The Xingjiang clan’s patriarch roared in a low voice with a trace of shock on his face.

“Break!”

He roared wildly and waved the fist in his hand. Waves of terrifying flaming meteorites shot towards the Golden Saber and sword.

“Peng Peng Peng!”

“Pu!”

However, that terrifying golden saber and sword broke through all of his attacks and landed in front of him.

A terrifying wave of energy charged over. The Xingjiang clan’s Patriarch’s face was pale as he spat out blood.

With one move, the Xing Jiang clan leader was defeated.

“What!”

“Not good, support the clan leader!”

All the universe knights around were shocked when they saw this scene. They quickly made their moves, and beams of energy shot toward Sky Sea Dragon King.

“Just a bunch of trash like you dare to provoke me?”

Sky Sea Dragon King’s gaze swept past them. He swept his arms and flapped his wings, and golden wings swept toward them.

“You little piece of trash, you still dare to contend with this Dragon King!”

“Submit to this dragon king immediately. Otherwise, I will exterminate everyone in your Xingjiang clan.”

As the Tianhai Dragon King spoke, he directly charged towards the Xingjiang clan’s patriarch.

“Oh no, I am not his match!”

“He is even more terrifying than that Dragon King!”

When the Xingjiang clan’s patriarch saw the Tianhai Dragon King charging over, his expression changed drastically.

If he continued to fight, he would definitely be destroyed.

However, how could he be willing to submit to the Tianhai Dragon King?

“Whoosh!”

His body moved and he hurriedly dodged to the side.

“Hahaha, you want to hide? If you dare to escape, we will slaughter the rest of your Xingjiang clan!”

The Tianhai Dragon King saw that the Xingjiang clan leader wanted to escape.

He flapped his dragon wings and attacked the palace in front of him.

There were countless disciples of the Xingjiang clan, and all of them lived here.

Some of the weaker ones couldn’t escape at all.

The Tianhai Dragon King’s attack instantly killed countless people of the Xingjiang clan.

Large areas of the palace were directly destroyed.

“Damn it!”

The Xingjiang clan leader’s heart sank when he saw the Tianhai Dragon King’s massacre, and his expression was extremely ugly.

Looking at the Crazy Sky Sea Dragon King, he had no doubt that he would slaughter the entire Xingjiang clan’s disciples.

There were trillions of people in the Xingjiang clan. If the Sky Sea Dragon King massacred them, too many people would die.

“Sky Sea Dragon King, you are a member of the Divine Dragon Clan. Are You So Despicable?”

The Xingjiang clan leader gritted his teeth and had no choice but to charge toward the Sky Sea Dragon King.

“Attack, attack this crazy fellow!”

“Kill!”

The other 200 plus universe knights also launched their attacks.

“I am the king under the Crown, suppress him!”

“Hahaha!”

Sky Sea Dragon King laughed maniacally. The crown on his head rotated and expanded to over 10 million kilometers in size, forming a cage that enveloped all of them.

“Not good, don’t be enveloped by this crown!”

The Xingjiang clan’s patriarch roared sternly.

However, the Tianhai Dragon King’s strength far exceeded their imaginations.

As a former Golden Dragon, his battle experience and strength were simply not something the Xingjiang clan could compare to.

The crown enveloped everyone, and blades suddenly floated around them.

“Not good!”

Looking at the blades that appeared out of thin air, their eyes darkened, and they had a bad premonition.

“Pu Pu Pu!”

“Ah Ah Ah!”

At this moment, the blades began to move, and they pierced towards them.

Blades and swords continuously pierced through their bodies, and miserable screams rang out.

When the Xingjiang clan’s patriarch saw this scene, his eyes were blood red, and his body trembled violently.

“Stop, stop immediately. We surrender, our Xingjiang clan surrenders!”

He roared with a mournful and unwilling expression.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Surrender? Submit, and immediately kneel before this Dragon King. Otherwise, I will kill all of you, Hahaha!”

The Tianhai Dragon King roared with a savage expression, and his body was filled with a violent murderous aura.

He did not look like a noble dragon, but like a ferocious dragon.
