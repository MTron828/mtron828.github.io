“It’s extremely dangerous to cross a few cities in the wild without the strength of a level nine extraordinary!”

“Without the strength of a void interpretation realm expert, it’s simply courting death to fly in the sky!”

Wang Xian recalled what Feng Luan had said to him back then. Now, it seemed that it was true.

Those outstanding young men who came from the graveyard of demi-humans and demons were all riding on mounts that were good at running on land. There were no flying mounts at all.

This was because it was very easy to encounter groups of birds and beasts while flying in the sky. Once they encountered them, it would be difficult to deal with them without a powerhouse at the profound void tier.

Wang Xian did not dodge when he saw the flaming birds and beasts flying towards him.

His body shook and numerous ice swords appeared around him.

Each ice sword emitted a cold glow under the sunlight.

“Go!”

Wang Xian saw a huge heat wave charging towards him. With a wave of his arm, the numerous water swords charged towards the group of flaming birds.

“Chirp chirp, CHIRP CHIRP!”

When the flying birds saw the terrifying ice swords, they let out rapid sounds.

However, the difference between this group of Flaming Bird Beasts and Wang Xian was too great. The ice sword was so cold that it pierced through the bodies of the flaming bird beasts easily.

“It’s a pity that I can only increase my dragon energy by devouring aquatic creatures. Other creatures can’t!”

Wang Xian flew over quickly and stored all the corpses of the flaming bird beasts into his interspatial ring.

Without any hesitation, he flew towards the direction of the human-demon graveyard once again.

Wang Xian did not stop for even a second. With his current strength and the body of the Divine Dragon, flying at a high speed in the sky did not consume too much energy.

If he continued flying like this, he would be able to last for at least a month.

As he continued to fly, Wang Xian flew for another four to five hours.

Halfway through, he encountered two waves of bird attacks and was easily killed by him.

Boom! Boom! Boom

“Eh?”

Suddenly, Wang Xian was attracted by the rumbling sound coming from the front. When he looked over, he was stunned.

At the lake below, three species of ferocious beasts were fighting.

A type of water-type ferocious beast that was similar to a hippo was fighting two wind-type and fire-type ferocious beasts.

The number of hippo-like ferocious beasts was about double that of the other two ferocious beasts.

In terms of strength, they were also much stronger than the other two ferocious beasts.

However, what surprised Wang Xian was that the hippo-like ferocious beast was in a disadvantageous position at this moment.

“This is? Wind-aided Fire?”

When Wang Xian saw that the wind-elemental and fire-elemental ferocious beasts were actually working together, he revealed a look of surprise.

Wind aided the fire!

The wind-type beasts used special techniques to increase the attack power of the fire-type beasts by about 50-60% .

Looking at the battle below, Wang Xian gave it some thought!

During the rest of the flight, Wang Xian slowed down and began to practice his control of the five elements energy.

Practicing the individual control and combined attack of the five elements was the inspiration he got from the two groups of beasts.

Of the two groups of fierce beasts, one was of the fire element and the other was of the wind element. The wind aided the fire and could make the fire attack even more terrifying.

It could make the wind carry fire and greatly increase the attack power.

This made him fall into deep thought, thinking of the ancient books he had read in the Demon Hunters Academy!

The learning ability of humans was the strongest among all living creatures.

In the transcendence stage, apart from everyone’s trump cards and divine abilities, some forces that had a great foundation also had all kinds of combat skills.

Combat techniques, combined combat techniques.

Supernatural powers were evolved from combat techniques that had reached the acme of perfection. If one was able to cultivate one combat technique after another and combine them together, they would be able to unleash a power that was not inferior to supernatural powers.

In fact, Wang Xian had also used the combination of two attributes. For example, the combination of the fire dragon’s flame and the descent of the wood world could unleash an even more terrifying attack.

He had even used the five attributes to amplify the attack in turn. This kind of amplification method was very crude!

It could only amplify the attack by about 80-90% !

After Wang Xian came to the extraordinary mainland, his strength had increased too quickly. Furthermore, he rarely made a move. This caused him to seldom study this kind of technique. His attack method was still at the level of Earth.

Now that his level had almost reached a bottleneck, it was difficult for him to increase his strength. He could only think of ways to increase his attack power.

Seeing the ferocious beasts of the two races, Wang Xian was enlightened.

With this thought, he realized how lousy and crude his techniques were.

Wang Xian was prepared to use the time when he was in the wild to practice properly.

With the control of the five elements energy, he was able to comprehend many offensive techniques that were not inferior to supernatural powers through the interaction of the five elements.

For example, extreme ice and fire explosion, extreme hot water sea, metal wood explosion, and so on.

These offensive techniques were not inferior to the power of a single attribute divine ability.

Furthermore, the consumption was very small!

“Bang!”

Wang Xian waved his arm gently. A ball of flame appeared at the tip of his finger. It was a golden needle.

The two attributes gathered together. Under the burning of the flame, the golden needle slowly turned red. Finally, the golden needle easily penetrated through a one-meter-sized earth alligator snapping turtle that was covered in armor.

An extraordinary level nine Earth alligator snapping turtle died instantly under Wang Xian’s light finger.

“Phew, the combined attack of the attributes is too strong. If I can combine three, four, or even five attributes together, it would be even more terrifying than my strongest dual-attribute supernatural ability!”

Wang Xian looked at the ferocious beast that was said to have the most terrifying defense on land that died instantly. Astonishment appeared on his face.

“A human genius. He has the ability to fight above his level when he cultivates dual attributes. On the other hand, he has been relying on the body of the divine dragon to fight above his level with numerous supernatural powers. He has completely neglected the use of the combination of attributes!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled.

According to the records of the Divine Dragon Clan, the top human experts had the terrifying ability to slaughter the Divine Dragon.

One of the reasons was their control over their attributes.

If a top human expert who controlled the five elements were to combine the five attributes into a terrifying attack, he would be able to unleash an attack that was more than ten times his original strength.

It was not impossible for him to slay the dragon!

If he possessed the terrifying body of the divine dragon and his control over his attributes, coupled with the human’s control over his attributes, he would be able to unleash an attack that was more than ten times his original strength.

As Wang Xian thought of this, he fell into deep thought and sat on the ground with his legs crossed.

It was very easy for him to combine two attributes. It was very easy for him to combine the two attributes.

However, it was a little difficult for him to combine the three attributes. He needed to control each attribute to the extreme.

Buzz

After more than ten hours, Wang Xian suddenly stood up and extended his palm.

A mini mountain that was as big as a mountain appeared above his palm.

The mountain peak suddenly emitted a terrifying flame. Wang Xian waved his hand gently and threw it toward a five-meter-thick tree.

“Bang!”

When the Flaming Mountain Peak landed on the tree, it suddenly emitted a golden glow and easily passed through the mountain peak.

A huge hole appeared. Following that, the tree started to burn with a loud bang.
