Chapter 1621: 1621 was the most ruthless emperor’s family

Ever since Feng Luan returned to the transcendence continent to develop, from the beginning of the Immortal Phoenix Pill and weapons workshop to the present dragon-phoenix Empire’s pill and weapons, she had always been suppressed.

If the fire Lark clan wasn’t around, the dragon-phoenix Empire might have been directly destroyed because of the competition in the business of pills and weapons.

Then, the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop would still be the enemy of the dragon-phoenix Empire.

The Dragon and Phoenix Empire wanted to monopolize the weapons and pills, and the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop would never be willing to let the market be taken away.

In the future, they would either give up or there would be a great war.

“When we become stronger, we will destroy the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop!”

Guan Shuqing and the other girls said to Feng Luan with slight anger on their faces.

When they were in the transvestite graveyard in the Liuhai region, the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop had joined forces with the Demon Beast clan to join forces with the blood flow empire to deal with them.

This enmity must be avenged in the future!

“There’s no rush. We’ve only developed for four years. Now that we’ve occupied so many domains, our development is much faster than before. One year later, we’ll have the strength to destroy the lone cult and the southern Royal Family!”

“At that time, we’ll be completely unafraid of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop. We’ll definitely be able to destroy them within three years.”

Feng Luan said with a smile.

“The financial resources of a force at this level are too powerful. Even if they are restrained by the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan, we must be careful!”

“When they were in the flowing sea region, they didn’t send anyone, but mobilized a very powerful force!”

Prime Minister GUI continued, “In the vast region, the three-legged situation has already taken shape. If they want to completely suppress us and even destroy us, only the Wuji dynasty and the southern royal family of the solipsistic sect are united!”

“Isn’t the Wuji dynasty on good terms with Little Xian? Moreover, when we first came here, they even sent us some items to express their goodwill!”

Guan Shuqing and the others said.

“Let’s Hope so!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded.

“The three-legged alliance has already taken shape in the vast area. Based on the current situation, even if we fight, it won’t be as miserable as it was in the past half a year

“During the Great War, although our shops in the dragon and Phoenix Empire region were expelled, due to the effects of the war, the sales of pills and weapons increased a little.”

“But now, the sales of pills and weapons in our two families will be directly reduced by one-third. This is one-third!”

“We can give up on that small place in the flowing sea region. We absolutely can not give up on the vast region now!”

However, at this moment, in a trade city in the vast region, dozens of middle-aged elders gathered in an academy that had a historical foundation.

Among them, there were artifact masters and Alchemy Masters.

Each of them had an extremely high status.

The Life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop were not only the two most powerful pill and weapon workshops in the transcendental continent, they also gathered the most powerful pill and weapon masters. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

In this city named Tianyun, the two most powerful pill and weapon academies in the vast region were gathered.

One was the life and Death Pill Academy, and the other was the holy item forging academy.

All the powerful forgers and pill workshops in the vast region came from these two academies.

These two academies were also opened by the holy item forging workshop and the life and Death Pill Workshop.

All the higher-ups of the two academies were gathered in the Academy Council building.

An old man with a hammer in his hand glanced at everyone and said in a deep voice.

“Right now, the dragon-phoenix Empire is developing too fast. Not long ago, they ruled the flowing sea region. Now, they have conquered a vast region!”

“They don’t allow us to enter their territory at all. After half a year of fighting, only my sect and the southern royal family didn’t have the slightest advantage!”

“No matter what, as long as the dragon-phoenix Empire exists, our losses will be extremely terrifying. In the future, if the dragon-phoenix Empire takes over more areas, we can also retreat from the vast areas!”

In the opposite seat, an old man with long white hair and a white beard said with an unpleasant expression.

“Let’s not talk so much nonsense. We all understand the current situation. The headquarters has already given the order to do whatever it takes!”

The old man holding the forging hammer said with a cold expression.

“With our strength, even if the two great academies support the lone cult and the southern royal family, they won’t be able to change the current occupation!”

“Unless the Wuji Empire makes a move, otherwise, it will be very difficult to destroy the three-legged tripod!”

The long-haired old man said directly.

“Then we will head to the Wuji Empire. As long as they are willing to offer conditions, we will agree!”

The old man holding the forging hammer shouted.

“It is said that Wuji Empire has a good relationship with Sky Demon. If we want them to make a move, I’m afraid...”

An old man frowned and said in a deep voice.

“Relationship? Now that Sky Demon is dead, what relationship does it have? In the face of benefits, those friendships are completely vulnerable!”

The old man holding the forging hammer said with a gloomy face.

“Alright, in that case, let’s go to Wuji Empire personally!”

The long white-haired old man stood up and said loudly.

“Go!”

“Go!”

Immediately, the twenty to thirty grandmasters in the hall flew directly toward Wuji Empire.

In the vast region, Wuji Emperor was now a Pure Land.

The war did not affect the entire empire.

During this period of time, many people rushed over to the Peaceful Wuji dynasty, which made the entire dynasty even more prosperous.

Wuji Imperial City was backed by Wuji Mountain, and the mountain peak was 20,000 meters tall.

Wuji dynasty had four majestic characters, each of which was 2,000 meters tall, engraved on Wuji Mountain.

The entire Wuji Imperial City was like an immortal city.

“Reporting to your Majesty, the life and Death Pill Academy and the holy item forging workshop of Tianyun City have come. They say that they have something important to discuss with your highness!”

In the Imperial Palace, a eunuch entered the imperial study and reported to the current emperor of the Wuji Empire.

“Oh? The Life and Death Pill Academy and the Holy Item Forging Academy!”

The King of the Wuji Empire was slightly stunned, and a thoughtful expression appeared on his face.

“Let them in. Go to Wuji Mountain and inform the two ancestors. Call up Qing city and a few important officials. Tell them that there are people from the holy item forging workshop and the life and Death Pill Workshop coming!”

Wuji Nation Master said slowly.

He could already guess why the two great forces were coming.

However, he could no longer make the decision on such a matter.

“It’s the Emperor!”

The old eunuch immediately nodded and walked out.

Soon, master blacksmiths and master blacksmiths walked into the imperial study one after another.

Everything was just as the Wuji King had expected.

The two powerful forces hoped that the Wuji dynasty would make a move and change the current three-legged situation.

However, he didn’t give any reply. Instead, he made them wait at the side!
