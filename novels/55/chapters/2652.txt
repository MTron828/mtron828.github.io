2653 2653 Emperor Star’s daughter’s father

“Kill!”

“Boom!”

“Die for me!”

In the square in front of the vast palace, roars filled with fighting spirit rang out one after another!

The experts in front of them were discussing with smiles on their faces.

This also made the atmosphere in the surroundings much more relaxed!

“Look, Di Suyi, Di Jiu, Di Ming, and Di Hun Ge are so powerful. As long as that Thunder Shadow just appeared, it would be directly destroyed by them!”

“Look at the corner. Di Xing ‘er is also very powerful. She is a famous female star in our imperial star field. She can earn a lot of God stones in a concert. Her strength is also very terrifying!”

“Di Qingshan can also be ranked among the disciples of this generation!”

“Eh, who are those two young men over there? Could they be the dark horses of this year?”

In the surrounding seats, some people who came to watch the ceremony discussed animatedly.

The people watching the ceremony on the stairs could see everything clearly.

The strength of some disciples was immediately revealed.

In particular, a few of the more popular disciples easily killed the Thunder Phantoms one by one.

The winner was decided immediately.

And the imperial court originally wanted to choose about a hundred of these millions of disciples, which could be said to be one in ten thousand.

In fact, this was not just one in ten thousand. Because these millions of disciples were chosen from hundreds of millions of disciples and billions of disciples of the imperial court.

There was another prerequisite, the elite disciples of the imperial court.

The domain of the imperial court belonged to the disciples of the imperial court. Among the young generation, there were more than 100 billion?

It could be said that the elites of the imperial court were gathered here.

To have the strength of an eternal lord of level two or three at the age of 5,000 years old was already considered outstanding.

As time passed, the disciples were eliminated one by one and were directly transferred out by the world-suppressing clock.

They were slightly unwilling. Looking at the disciples who were still fighting, they shook their heads.

They were all geniuses and knew how far they could go.

“Di haosong, that daughter of yours is not bad. Looks like there’s a place for her this time.”

In front of them, a very young woman said to the middle-aged man beside her.

“Oh? My Daughter? That Kid in my house is trash. Daughter’s Words? Which one are you talking about?”

The middle-aged man called di haosong had a puzzled look on his face.

“Hehe, as expected of a Lothario. Perhaps he doesn’t even know how many sons he has now. Hehe!”

The woman said mockingly as her gaze landed on Di Xingnu. “Di Xingnu should also be considered one of the favorites this time around. Her strength is not bad. I heard that she has the support of a pretty good faction.”

“Oh? Di Xingnu, I remember now.”

Di haosong thought of it and his gaze landed on Di Xingnu. His eyes lit up, “Not bad, not bad. Without my guidance, she can still grow to this stage. This daughter is not bad.”

“How ironic. To have a father like you is really unlucky.”

The lady beside him shook her head.

“Haha, How Could It Be Unlucky? It should be an honor. We really have to train him well!”

Di Haosong narrowed his eyes slightly.

He was once the son of the emperor. Back then, he was also known as a Lothario. Women were calculated in tens of thousands.

Apart from his wife who was often with him, and his wife’s son and daughter who were often trained, the rest of his children were rarely seen.

This was the first time he noticed this outstanding daughter of his. If he could get a good ranking, he would have to nurture her well.

He knew that an Emperor’s daughter had the potential to become a ranked disciple.

It was not an exaggeration to say that this was the future of the imperial court.

“Big Brother, your daughter is not simple now.”

At this moment, Di Haofang who was beside the woman looked at Di Haofang and said expressionlessly.

“Oh? How is she not simple?”

Di Haofang’s interest was piqued and he immediately asked.

“My niece is now very close to a first-rate force. The leader of that first-rate force is also the master of the Frost Goddess.”

Di Haofang said with a slightly gloomy face.

“Frost Goddess?”

Di Haofang slightly raised his eyebrows.

“Hehe, take a look at some information on the AI. Your younger brother was taught a terrible lesson by the Frost Goddess.”

The woman next to him smiled.

“It seems that a lot of things have happened after being in seclusion for more than ten years.”

Di Haofang smiled and took out the AI to check some information.

...

“Oh?”

Soon, he raised his eyebrows, and his eyes were shining.

“Good. One hundred and twenty-three disciples have passed the test. Twenty to thirty of them will not be able to participate in the next test due to their age. You will be rewarded by the imperial court!”

Not long after, a voice sounded.

At this time, the Imperial Star Lady also destroyed the attack of more than one hundred and sixty lightning shadows in front of her.

“Dong!”

As the voice fell, the world-suppressing bell sounded.

Bolts of lightning surrounded the 100 figures in the arena!

As for the remaining 23, they were disciples who were relatively young, only 1-2,000 years old, and had good talent.

Because they cultivated relatively late, there was no need for them to participate in the following assessment. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“The disciples who defeated the combined forces of more than 150 Thunder Phantoms will temporarily stand aside and watch. The ten of you have the qualifications to compete for the position of Imperial Princess. Of course, the rest of you also have the qualifications to challenge them!”

...

“The other 90 disciples will be participating in the ranking battle. The top ten will be able to challenge the disciples like them.”

The old Protector announced calmly.

“It’s the Protector!”

The emperor’s daughter and the other nine disciples could not help but show an excited look at this moment. They moved their bodies and immediately headed to the side!

“Mother!”

“Wang Xian!”

The emperor’s daughter flew to the front of Wang Xian and the rest. She shouted with a smile on her face!

“Good, good, good. Our Imperial Star Lady has finally grown up.”

The Imperial Star Lady’s mother was also rubbing her head with a smile on her face.

“Mother, I will definitely be the imperial star lady this time. When the time comes, we will enter this palace to live.”

The Imperial Star Lady raised her head slightly and clenched her fists.

“Hahaha, meijuan, good, good. You have taught a good daughter.”

At this moment, laughter suddenly came from the side.

“Huh?”

The Empress Star’s mother’s eyebrows jumped. She turned her gaze to the side and looked at the handsome middle-aged man!

“Husband!”

She slightly bowed and shouted.

When the Empress Star heard her mother’s address, she trembled and looked at the middle-aged man expressionlessly.

“Why? Don’t you greet your father when you see him?”

Di haosong looked at her with a smile and said.

“OH.”

Di Xingnu said “Oh”coldly, full of coldness.

“Xingnu.”

The woman at the side called out to her.

“Hehe, I didn’t know I had a father.”

Di Xingnu saw her mother touching her and said indifferently!

His words made di haosong frown slightly.

“Alright Girl, don’t Be Childish.”

He said indifferently to Di Xingnu.

“What kind of father is he?”

Di Xingnu looked at her mother and said directly.
