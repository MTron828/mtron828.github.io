“Huh? What? Dragon Blood Sword, the most precious treasure?”

When Wang Xian finished his sentence, everyone was slightly stunned. The old man from the Dragon Python group hovering in the sky was also stunned. He immediately stared at Wang Xian!

“The most precious treasure? Is this for real?”

“Dragon Blood Sword, forged with the Divine Dragon’s Bone and blood of the Divine Dragon. Is... is this possible?”

Some of them looked over in astonishment and stared at the sharp sword in Wang Xian’s hand!

The hilt of the dragon head sword was blood-red in color. The entire sword exuded a faint pressure!

“This sword is extraordinary!”

“This sword is not simple. Even if it is not as powerful as what he said, it is not something that other divine swords can compete with!”

When the surrounding experts looked over, they were slightly shocked!

They were all undying God king level warriors, their eyesight was naturally extraordinary, with just a glance, the dragon blood sword wasn’t something the other godly swords could compare to!

That faint pressure made everyone’s heart palpitate!

Last month, the great teacher Yue Xing Guang looked over, when his gaze landed on the dragon blood sword, his expression changed, this sword was much better than his!

The Dragon Python group Elder stared at the sword, his eyes burning with passion!

Such a godly sword could greatly increase his strength!

The Moon essence within Moon Bay had already been absorbed by him. Even though it was still a rare treasure without it, it wasn’t as powerful as before!

Using it to exchange for a powerful godly sword could greatly increase his battle power!

“My friend from the Dragon Python group, I’m willing to use this god Blade and 10 undying level 5 chaos seed crystals!”

Yue Xing Guang saw the old man’s expression and cursed, immediately saying!

“HM?”

When the old man from the Dragon Python group heard Yue Xing Guang’s words, he turned to look, however his eyes didn’t have much of a ripple!

“This is obviously that dragon blood divine sword that is more valuable!”

“I wonder if that Dragon Blood Sword is really made from the Divine Dragon Bone Divine Dragon Blood? But even so, it should still be the dragon blood sword that is more valuable!”

When the surrounding people saw this scene, they whispered among themselves!

“Eh? Little Light, is there a treasure that you have your eyes on?”

At this moment, a group of middle-aged elders not far away saw Yue Xingguang and walked over to ask in puzzlement!

Behind them, there were also many people surrounding them!

The commotion here attracted the attention of all the surrounding warriors and they all walked over curiously!

“Elder, that treasure is very useful to wood attribute warriors!”

Yue Xingguang saw the warriors from the large sect and said!

“HM?”

The people from the large sect from last month looked over and were slightly shocked!

“What a majestic life force. Even the divine tree at the peak of the Immortal King Realm in our sect can’t compare to it!”

The elder beside him narrowed his eyes and revealed a look of shock!

“What kind of Deal?”

The elder from the great sect last month immediately asked!

“Elder, the other party needs a divine sword. However, that young man took out a very powerful divine sword!”

Yue Xingguang looked at the dragon blood sword in Wang Xian’s hand and said!

Last month, when the great sect elder’s gaze landed on the Dragon Blood Sword, a hint of surprise appeared on his face!

“Young friend, I am willing to trade with the divine sword in your hand!”

At this moment, the elder from the Dragon Python group suddenly spoke to Wang Xian!

“Alright!”

When Wang Xian heard that, a smile appeared on his face!

The dragon blood sword was naturally not something that other divine swords could compare to!

However, this dragon blood sword was not as precious as he had imagined. After all, if a fallen godly dragon was really forged into such a sharp sword, it could be forged into tens of thousands of swords!

Its rarity could not be compared to the Moon Bay!

Of course, the value of the Moon Bay would also depend on who held it!

In the hands of this old man from the Dragon Python group, the value was not even comparable to the dragon blood sword!

“Wait, my friend from the Dragon Python group, we want the Supreme Treasure in your hands. You can go to our great sect’s treasury last month and choose two treasures at will!”

Seeing that the Moon Bay was about to be traded, the elder from the great sect last month hesitated for a moment and said!

“Huh?”

The elder from the Dragon Python group was stunned, and a hesitant look appeared on his face!

The Great Sect’s treasury from last month could choose two treasures. This was... Too tempting!

“What? Two treasures from the Great Sect’s treasury from last month? It seems that the great sect was determined to get it!”

...

“Hiss, the treasures from the Great Sect’s treasury from last month definitely have powerful treasures!”

When the people around heard the words of the Great Sect’s elder from last month, they were slightly shocked and discussed among themselves!

“Take a look at this godly sword first!”

Wang Xian glanced at the elder from the great sect last month. He waved his arm and threw the dragon blood sword to the elder from the Dragon Python group!

The elder took it and held it in his hand!

Buzz

Streams of law energy condensed and his eyes widened!

Roar! Roar

In the next moment, the shadow of a godly dragon appeared around the Dragon Blood Sword. A dragon’s roar came from the Dragon Blood Sword!

“This...”

The elder of the Dragon Python group widened his eyes, and his eyes revealed an extremely excited expression!

...

“What is this? A divine weapon spirit? Is that a divine dragon?”

“Is it really forged from the bone of a divine dragon? Poured with the blood of a divine dragon? Otherwise, how could there be such a divine weapon spirit?”

“Even if it’s not the legendary pure-blooded divine dragon, it’s still forged from the bone of an incomparably powerful dragon. Hiss, this is a supreme treasure!”

The surrounding people sensed the changes on the dragon blood sword and revealed shocked expressions!

Last month, the great sect elder and Yue Xingguang’s expressions changed slightly!

“It’s very likely that it’s really a divine sword forged from the body of a Divine Dragon!”

At this moment, some experts gathered around and stared at the divine sword in astonishment. Some experts who used sharp swords had burning gazes!

This was definitely a supreme treasure!

In the eyes of many people, the value of the dragon blood sword was much higher than that of the Moon Bay!

“Hahaha, good sword, good sword. It is indeed the sword of the Divine Dragon. My young friend, I will exchange for the treasure!”

The elder from the Dragon Python group caressed the Dragon Blood Sword in his hand excitedly. The Moon Bay flew towards Wang Xian!

“Alright!”

Wang Xian looked at the Moon Bay in front of him with burning eyes. It was worth it to be able to obtain such a treasure this time around!

“Little brother, are you willing to part with the Moon Bay? I’m willing to give you a large number of treasures in exchange!”

At the side, Yue Xingguang looked at Wang Xian unwillingly and said to him!

“No!”

Wang Xian took a glance at him and rejected him immediately!

“Don’t be in a hurry to reject me. You can enter our Great Moon sect and choose two treasures. I will also give you enough treasures!”

Yue Xingguang was stunned for a moment before he gritted his teeth and continued speaking!

“I will not exchange anything!”

Wang Xian replied indifferently!

“You...”

His expression changed and he was extremely embarrassed!

Wang Xian ignored him and kept the ancient lake, Moon Bay!

“Little brother, we can discuss the price again. We can let you choose four treasures from our great sect’s treasury last month!”

The Great Sect’s elder from last month hesitated for a moment. He looked like Wang Xian! Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I’ve already said that I won’t exchange it. Are you trying to force me to sell it?”

Wang Xian frowned slightly when he saw them trying to buy the treasures one after another!
