Chapter 1620: 1620 was the most ruthless emperor’s family

“There should be a period of peace in the future. We’re not in a hurry. We’ll continue to fight with them after Xiaoxian resurrects!”

Lan qingyue, Guan Shuqing, and the other girls were also sitting in the imperial study.

They had a faint smile on their faces.

During the eight-month war, most of the losses of the dragon and Phoenix dynasty were on the Dragon Palace’s side. Most of the people who died and participated in the war were members of the Dragon Palace.

However, the Dragon Palace didn’t suffer heavy losses during the eight months. Instead, their strength continued to increase.

It was also because of this that the dragon-phoenix Empire was able to contend against the two super forces, first-rate forces, and many second-rate forces.

It was also because of the Dragon Palace that the He clan and he Sui clan were willing to join the dragon-phoenix Empire’s camp.

This was because the dragon-phoenix Empire had guaranteed that they wouldn’t be allowed to charge at the frontlines.

Unlike the southern royal family’s solipsistic sect, the forces that were coerced into joining them had to be the first to charge at the frontline when they fought.

“We can waste time with them. Right now, we have indirectly affected more than 1,800 cities. The daily income from the elixir stores and the forging workshop can create more than ten insightful void level experts

“In half a year, the southern royal family and the solipsistic sect will be completely exhausted to death by us!”

Prime Minister Gui said with a smile.

After eight months of fighting, even if the Dragon Palace was at the forefront, and even if three or four thousand members of the Dragon Palace died, the biggest winner would still be the Dragon Palace.

The corpses of the enemies and the resources in the interspatial rings of the enemies were enough to raise the strength of the Dragon Palace by one level.

In addition, the dead members of the Dragon Palace could be resurrected in the Dragon Palace, although it consumed a lot of resources.

However, these resources could be made up with the profits of the forging workshop.

As a result, after an eight-month war, the dragon palace had about 15,000 insightful emptiness realm experts, which was originally more than 7,000.

Among them, the strength of the leaders was comparable to an eighth level insightful emptiness realm expert.

After all, this war affected 70% of the forces in the vast region.

This was because more than a dozen second-rate forces and two first-rate forces had been destroyed in this war.

A lot of resources were sent to the Dragon Palace.

In the Divine Kingdom Forest, the Demon War Department, AO qitian, and the others did not participate in this war. They had been wreaking havoc in the divine kingdom forest.

The number of corpses they obtained from the fierce beasts reached 20,000 to 30,000 in eight months. All of them were void interpretation level fierce beasts.

The war would only make the dragon palace stronger and stronger.

As for the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, after obtaining a lot of resources, their strength was also increasing rapidly every day.

Compared to the Dragon and Phoenix Empire and the Dragon Palace, the solipsistic sect and the southern royal family were undoubtedly much more miserable.

After eight months of war, six to seven thousand profound void realm experts had fallen.

Each of their forces had lost at least half of their profound void realm experts.

After eight months of war, the entire vast area was filled with killing intent!

“In the following time, the dragon-phoenix Empire will completely take control of the cities below!”

Feng Luan said with a smile.

Because of this war, all the forces were divided into three camps. The Wuji Empire was neutral, and they were in opposition to the southern royal family of the solipsistic sect.

They were completely three-sided.

In the next few days, the dragon and Phoenix Empire could properly absorb more than 1,800 cities.

Once they absorbed all of them, the power of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire would reach a terrifying level.

It would have endless potential in the future.

“Sister Feng Luan, the resources in your hands should be enough for you to increase a level, right?”

Lan Qingyue asked with a smile.

“It’s enough. I’ll return to the Dragon Palace in the next few days!”

Feng Luan nodded with a smile.

“Then once sister Feng Luan’s strength breaks through again, won’t you be equivalent to a half-step wanshou expert?”

Guan Shuqing asked with some surprise.

“If I transform into a fire Phoenix, I can fight against a half-step longevity realm expert, but I can’t fight with a fire Phoenix Body!”

Feng Luan said faintly.

The former empress of the Phoenix dynasty was famous throughout the entire extraordinary continent. Even in the flowing sea region, there was a legend of the empress.

Once she transformed into a fire phoenix, it would arouse suspicion.

Once the Phoenix Dynasty knew that she was still alive, they would immediately dispatch longevity realm experts to kill her.

Therefore, she absolutely could not transform into a fire Phoenix to fight.

“Then when will sister Feng Luan be able to show her true face to others?”

Guan Shuqing looked at Feng Luan, who was wearing a veil, and said.

“Very soon. When I reach the longevity realm, we will announce that the dragon-phoenix Empire will be promoted to an empire!”

Feng Luan touched the veil on her face, and her eyes flickered with a cold luster.

“Reporting to the Empress, an unfamiliar expert has arrived outside and is here to pay his respects to you!”

At this moment, the voice of a guard came from outside.

“King!”

When the Guard’s voice ended, an old man’s voice came over.

“Let him in!”

Feng Luan immediately said when she heard the voice.

“Yes!”

An old man walked in. The old man’s entire body was covered in a fiery red robe. He walked into the imperial study and took off his hat.

“Greetings, King!”

The old man directly knelt down and said.

“Get up, Little Flame. If there’s anything you need, come over directly!”

Feng Luan waved her hand at him and asked.

“King, there’s a piece of news. Ancestor Yun asked me to consult you!”

The old man bowed and said.

“What is it?”

Feng Luan slightly frowned and a trace of solemnity appeared on her face.

“According to the news we received, the holy item forging workshop and the life and Death Pill workshop are going to send experts over to prepare to destroy your Majesty’s Dynasty!”

The old man also said solemnly, “The cloud ancestor asked you if you need the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan to start a war with the two major forces!”

“What?”

In the surroundings, Guan Shuqing and the other girls heard the old man’s words and their expressions changed greatly. They let out a cry of fear.

“Can’t hold them back anymore?” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Feng Luan asked with a frown.

“After all the forces start a war, we can pin down the two major forces!”

The old man said in a deep voice.

“Then let’s start a war. Don’t fight to the death. Pin them down. Tell Little Yun that in a year’s time, at most a year, when the time comes, I will have no fear of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop!”

“In three years, we will destroy the two forces!”

Feng Luan slowly stood up, and a powerful aura was emitted.

The old man was slightly startled. He felt the aura on Feng Luan’s body, and his face was filled with determination.

“Yes, my king. With Our Fire Cloud Sparrow clan around, my king, you can rest assured and develop!”

The old man said resolutely.

Feng Luan nodded.

“Your Majesty, we are at war with the two great factions. Their experts have no time to come over, but you have to be careful. Be careful of their other ways of targeting us!”

The old man hesitated for a moment before reminding her.

“I know!”

Feng Luan’s face was deep in thought. “I will make preparations.”.

“Yes, then little flame will take his leave!”

The old man bowed and immediately left.

“The life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop have always been a huge trouble!”

After the elder of the fire Lark clan left, Feng Luan frowned and murmured.
