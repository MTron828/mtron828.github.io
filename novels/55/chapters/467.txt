Chapter 468: Fire God’s Token

Dubai is one of the richest countries in Asia. In fact, it’s one of the richer countries even when compared to the entire world.

The “sail ship” hotel in Dubai is the number one hotel in Dubai. Moreover, Dubai has the world’s tallest building and other notable structures.

Dubai was an emirate and was famous within Asia.

Wang Xian was on the plane towards Dubai. Around him, those who were heading to Dubai for holidays were all relatively rich people.

Although Dubai was famous, the cost was also very high. It wasn’t the first choice of tourism for ordinary families.

When he walked out of the international airport, Wang Xian looked around him. It was indeed deserving of the name of an extravagant country.

“The Fire God’s Graveyard is on a volcano island in the vicinity. It should be easy to find an island with a volcano!”

Wang Xian recalled the place Sui Huang had described to him. After walking out of the airport, he hailed a cab and asked the driver, “Where’s the island with a volcano?”

Luckily, Wang Xian’s command of the English language was still passable and he wasn’t facing problems in conversing.

“Fire Spirit Island? You are going to the Fire Spirit Island too? There’s quite a number of people who are heading there today!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The driver was a local and was looking at Wang Xian inquisitively.

“Yeah. I’m going to the Fire Spirit Island to look for a friend!” Wang Xian smiled and nodded his head as he made up a reason casually.

“It’s a little far from here and it would be an hour journey!” the driver explained as he drove Wang Xian towards the Fire Spirit Island.

The Fire Spirit Island is about seven to eight kilometers away from the mainland. From afar, one could see the white smoke fuming from the volcano.

Because of the white smoke throughout the year and the occasional flames, the Fire Spirit Island could also be considered a scenic spot in Dubai.

The beach in Dubai was extremely beautiful. The water was so clear that one could see the bottom of the sea. Directly opposite the Fire Spirit Island was a place for tea and snacks.

At this moment, the place was already filled with people. Over four to five thousand people were densely packed in the area.

“There are at most a thousand people here typically. I’m not sure why there are so many people here today!” the driver mumbled. After paying the cab fare, Wang Xian alighted from the car.

Looking across, the entire beach was filled with people. From them, Wang Xian could feel immense energy.

There are quite a number of Inborn experts among the few thousand people here!

Wang Xian stood on the pathway and looked down in shock.

“There are people from eight different denominations here. It’s impossible for Nether Flame to occupy the place for themselves!”

“Dubai has also made an announcement that the Fire God’s Graveyard is within their territory. If one wishes to enter, he has to pay a hundred million first. Otherwise, they can forget about entering!”

“Dubai is really smart in this. They knew that it would be impossible for them to obtain the treasures inside. Therefore, they could only use this method to get something out of it!”

“The other eight denominations have no other options either. If they really press Dubai too hard, a strategic warhead might be sent here. At that time, no one could even wish to obtain the treasures!”

“It’s getting interesting now. Whoever can pay the sum is allowed in. The people from the eight denominations didn’t seem to have much to say about it either.”

“The entire Fire God’s Graveyard is exceptionally huge. Moreover, dangers lurk in all corners. It spanned several tens of kilometers and rumor has it that the Nether Flame has lost a good number of experts!”

“It’s a Fire God’s Graveyard after all and the residence of an elite expert. Fire God Hephaestus was most known for his equipment refining and his fire demons. The place is likely to be filled with countless fire demons. The eight denominations are probably afraid of suffering grave losses and thus don’t dare to enter recklessly. Therefore, they have only sent a small number of people to scout the place!”

When Wang Xian got closer and heard the conversation of the crowd, he was slightly surprised.

The news of the Fire God’s Graveyard had been leaked by Sui Huang. He thought this place would be controlled by various powerful forces. However, it wasn’t the case.

[Dubai is recruiting guards above Level 9 martial artists. The hundred million entry fee would be exempted. One is allowed to keep half of the treasures obtained. There are currently fifty people who have joined.]

Wang Xian walked deeper in and was shocked by an eye-catching sign.

“Dubai is really smart to recruit guards. Whatever treasures the guards get from the graveyard, they will also receive half of them!” Wang Xian chuckled.

He realized that there were several forces recruiting guards like these. However, they didn’t have the same credit rating as Dubai. As such, they could only promise spiritual stones or money directly.

There were even some who were looking for teammates to explore the place together and to help each other out.

To sum it up, the place was completely different from what Wang Xian had envisioned. The Fire God’s Graveyard was like a treasured place that required exploration.

Wang Xian looked towards the Fire Spirit Volcano curiously.

“The entrances to the Fire God’s Graveyard have been sealed. If I want to enter, I can only go by the main entrance. In that case, I have to pay a hundred million!”

Wang Xian’s eyebrows knitted together. Changing the currency from his country to Dubai’s currency, he would have to pay $170-$180 million.

This wasn’t a small sum. However, if he could obtain treasures from the Fire God’s Graveyard, this sum would just be peanuts.

Wang Xian raised an eyebrow and headed towards a room at the side.

“Those who wish to enter the Fire God’s Graveyard have to present a Token of Authority which can be purchased with money!”

Just as he stepped into the area, a service attendant explained this to Wang Xian.

“Give me one!” Wang Xian said immediately.

In the Outstanding Young Heroes Competition previously, the Dragon Sect had occupied all the spots. As such, all the rewards had gone to him.

He received over ninety billion in cash.

The only thing Wang Xian wasn’t lacking now was cash.

“Alright. This is for you. We are not responsible for any lost tokens!”

The service attendant threw a Token of Authority towards him and spoke plainly.

The Token of Authority was the size of a palm with the words “Fire God’s Token” written on it.

Wang Xian walked out and flipped the token in his hand.

Puff!

At this moment, a hand grabbed towards the Token of Authority.

Wang Xian was taken aback. He immediately moved aside and dodged the hand. At the same time, he looked before him.

Four thievish-looking people appeared before him. All of them had small beards and had samurai swords hung around their waist. All of them were staring greedily at the Token of Authority in Wang Xian’s hand.

“Japanese?” Wang Xian raised an eyebrow and stared coldly at the four of them.

“Brat, we are just missing a Token of Authority. Give us the Token of Authority in your hand!” The old man in the middle played with his beard as the other three surrounded Wang Xian.

“Another fight?”

“Just let them fight. The more that die, the merrier!”

“Hehe. That kid is really dumb to purchase a Token of Authority alone. Although a hundred million isn’t much, it’s still substantial for a martial artist. It’s a common occurrence for the weak to be robbed!”

“This is already the third case today. Three people were killed in the previous incident!”

“Those three are martial artists from Team Liuchuan. Eh, that’s not entirely right. In their countries, they are referred to as ninjas.”

“The kid didn’t know the importance of hiding after purchasing a Token of Authority. It’s clear that he’s inexperienced. Just count this as a lesson!”

The surrounding crowd looked on with faint smiles, as they were already familiar with such developments.

No one attempted to intervene. In fact, some were even regretting not making a move earlier!
