Chapter 890: 0891, assassination

Translator: 549690339

The aura of a rank 5 transcendent exploded out instantly, and a terrifying, icy-cold killing intent filled the sky above the east gate of Saint Sea Town.

In an instant, the expressions of everyone around changed drastically, and those who were weaker turned pale.

“Vice commander dogfish, this is the city. Pay attention!”

An old man on the city wall shouted coldly and warned the middle-aged man.

“Hu!”

The vice-captain took a deep breath. His eyes were wide open like copper bells as he retracted his aura.

However, the murderous aura accumulated from years of battle still made everyone tremble in fear.

“Who killed them? !”

The vice-captain stared at Qi Lian coldly as his eyes slowly turned bloodshot.

The middle-aged man and the middle-aged man with a huge axe stepped forward as well, their eyes flashing with a fierce light.

“Uncle Ao, the other two uncles, ao Xue and the rest were killed. Everyone who participated in the assessment knows about it!”

Qi Lian saw the terrifying murderous aura and gulped before he spoke hurriedly.

After he finished speaking, the group of young men looked in the direction of Wang Xian and the rest once again, intentionally or unintentionally.

“It’s You!”

What kind of people were vice-leader of the squalor sharks and the rest? Their eyes were filled with murderous intent as they looked directly at Wang Xian and strode over.

However, when he entered the assessment circle, a middle-aged man stood in front of him coldly.

“Don’t be impudent in front of our Demon Hunters Academy!”

A middle-aged instructor of the demon Hunters Academy said coldly.

Vice-captain of the squad and the other two middle-aged men’s expressions changed drastically.

“Kid, did you kill My Daughter?”

The vice captain of the squad shouted at Wang Xian coldly. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“They deserve to die!”

Wang Xian didn’t show any signs of weakness as he stared at them and replied coldly.

“Good, good, good. How dare you kill Ao Kuang’s Daughter? Kid, I’m telling you, you’re dead for sure. I’m going to kill all of your family members too!”

The vice captain of the squad roared furiously with his eyes wide open.

“I’ll cut you into pieces and make you wish you were dead!”

The middle-aged man who was holding a huge axe pointed at Wang Xian and roared with murderous intent in his eyes.

The luxurious middle-aged man was the same.

A cold murderous aura gathered around him.

“No fighting is allowed in the holy sea town. If not, you will be executed immediately!”

An old man led a team of guards and walked over to the guards of the holy sea town and said slowly.

“Don’t worry, Master Qing. We won’t fight in Saint Sea Town!”

The luxurious middle-aged man turned his head and said expressionlessly.

“Well, as long as it’s not in the city, you can do whatever you want!”

The old man nodded lightly.

“The admission notice has a date on it. Don’t miss it!”

The five middle-aged men from the Demon Hunters Academy coldly glanced at the middle-aged men and said to the students who had passed the exam.

“It’s the instructor!”

The students nodded and walked towards their parents’seats.

Wang Xian glanced at the three vice leaders of the horned shark team and walked straight in.

“Kid, just wait for your death. Within three days, I will definitely take your dog life!”

A voice filled with murderous intent sounded from behind, causing Wang Xian to pause.

“In this assessment, that young man’s results are the best. He killed an extraordinary level three piranha. Even the instructor praised him as a genius!”

“Hehe, this kid is going to be finished. Once he leaves Saint Sea Town, he will definitely be killed by the vice squad leader of horned shark!”

“So what if he’s first? Isn’t he going to be killed soon? He’s really courting death!”

“This young man actually got first place? But first place is useless to dead people!”

Some of the surrounding young men saw this situation and gloated.

Very soon, the news spread quickly in holy sea town.

The first place in the Demon Hunters Academy’s assessment had killed Ao Xue, bei Ming, and Qing Feng. The vice leader of the horned shark mercenary group swore to take revenge.

As the news spread, everyone was stunned and started discussing.

“Dragon King, the strength of the horned shark mercenary group is very strong. The leader is an expert at transcendent level six. The vice leader of the horned shark mercenary group was also at transcendent level five. It will be dangerous for us to leave the city in the future!”

At this moment, the DRAKONID walked to Wang Xian’s side and said with a face full of worry.

“I know!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. “Let’s make a trip to the demon hunters mercenary group!”

The squawk shark mercenary group was very strong. The other two middle-aged men were also very strong. In the eyes of many people, Wang Xian was almost certain to die.

However, fighting was prohibited in the city.

The Demon Hunters Academy would only officially begin in a month. However, Wang Xian could head to Donghai city at any time.

As long as he didn’t get discovered after leaving, it was fine.

He could still leave Shenghai town quietly. Therefore, he wasn’t worried at all.

When he arrived at the demon hunters mercenary group, Wang Xian went straight to the front of the service desk.

“How may I help you?”

The waiter asked directly.

“Hand in the mission!”

Wang Xian replied directly.

“What mission? Please take out the mission items!”

The waiter replied directly.

“The mission to hunt the big-mouthed piranha, five extraordinary level-two jade gels, and a 4-star bronze mission!”

Wang Xian took out an interspatial ring and handed it over.

“Congratulations to the Fairy Phoenix mercenary group for completing the 4-star bronze mission. All of you can upgrade directly to 2-star bronze. We can help you change the level of your badges for free. This is the reward item!”

The waiter said with a smile on his face.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded and took the reward item.

Fox flame pill: Extraordinary Level 2

Extractable Dragon Energy: 11 Dragon Crystals

“It’s more cost-effective than swallowing it directly!”

Wang Xian smiled and swallowed it directly. Then, he walked out.

Bam

However, just as Wang Xian turned around, a figure crashed into him.

“Kid, do you even know how to walk?”

A cold voice was heard. Wang Xian frowned slightly and looked at the person in front of him.

Out of the four of them, the person who bumped into him was a middle-aged man.

“What are you looking at? Are you unconvinced? If you’re unconvinced, let’s have a match in the arena, You Little Bastard!”

The middle-aged man stared at Wang Xian with a mocking gaze and said coldly.

“What’s going on?”

“It’s Wu Dazhuang. Who’s that young man? What Bad Luck!”

“He’s A Level 2 bronze mercenary group. Wu Dazhuang is the captain of the squalid shark mercenary group!”

“TSK tsk, we’re watching a Show!”

Wang Xian heard the discussions around him. He raised his eyebrows and glanced at the mercenary badge on his chest.

“Get out of the way!”

He said coldly.

“No Way, you little bastard. You even dared to kill the daughter of our vice-captain. I think you want to Die!”

Wu Dazhuang grinned and said in a sinister tone.

“Hehe, I’ve already killed you. What can you do to me?”

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly.

“Haha, What Can You Do? I’m standing right here. If you see me, you have to go around. As long as you dare to leave the city, you will die!”

Wu Dazhuang smiled sinisterly and stared at Wang Xian with burning eyes.
