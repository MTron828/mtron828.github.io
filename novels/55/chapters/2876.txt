Chapter 2877: 2,877 seconds between the two divine emperors

If the Dragon Palace had joined the war against the imperial court, the Dragon Palace would have suffered a fatal blow.

But now…

In the Dragon Palace, there were three wind god dragons who were improving. Half a month later, they would have the combat strength of a rank two divine emperor.

Including him and Xiao Lan, the Dragon Palace would have five rank two divine emperor experts.

“After the celebration of Hong Fengyan, the three wind god dragons will head directly to the Heaven Wizard region after they have leveled up. They will destroy the imperial court and the Witch Formation Association!”

Wang Xian said coldly.

“Dragon King, they are being a little disrespectful to our Dragon Palace!”

Beside him, a wind god dragon whispered to Wang Xian.

“It’s alright. Let’s go to the center.”

As Wang Xian spoke, he flew toward the center of the Holy Kingdom.

At the same time, he took out his communication stone plate and sent a message to Ye lui Ying and the rest.

“Master, the Dragon King sent me a message. He has entered our Holy Kingdom!”

In the center of the Holy Kingdom, on the bustling street in front of the Central Palace of the Holy Kingdom, a towering tower soared into the sky.

This was the Holy Kingdom’s child and mother Holy Tower.

The Holy Tower was the Holy Kingdom’s iconic building. They were located in the child Holy Tower.

The Mother Holy Tower was located in the Holy Kingdom’s Central Palace.

The child and mother Holy Tower was the two tallest buildings in the Holy Kingdom. The child holy tower was slightly lower than the mother Holy Tower.

Now, the Child Holy Tower’s holy region was open to the outside world. Standing on the Holy Tower, one could overlook the entire Holy Kingdom.

However, although it was open to the outside world, ordinary people still did not have the ability to enter.

Even if they had money, they might not be able to enter.

At the top of the Holy Tower, Hong Fengyan was playing chess with the god Emperor of Shangshui while ye Lui Ying and the rest were playing with invincible battle technique.

After receiving Wang Xian’s message, Ye lui Ying immediately reported it to her master.

“Boss Wang has also sent me a message. I’ve sent boss Wang Our location. He should be here soon. I’ll go and welcome him now!”

Invincible battle technique also came over and said.

“Let’s Go Too!”

Hong Fengyan hesitated for a moment and said.

“Hehe, okay. Let’s go down and wait!”

The god Emperor of Shangshui also nodded.

Since the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace had come, they naturally had to welcome him.

“However, isn’t it a little… and the two guys from the imperial court and the eight Barrens haven’t left yet?”

The god Emperor of Shangshui looked at Hong Fengyan and said hesitantly.

“It’s fine. They came here to warn me not to join their war. If I didn’t announce it directly, would they dare to force me?”

Hong Fengyan said indifferently.

“Haha, that’s true. I’m also alone. If they force us, they will be stupid!”

God Emperor Shangshui laughed and stood up to walk out.

Hong Fengyan also stood up and walked out. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The Invincible Ye lui Ying and the others immediately followed behind.

“Greetings, God Emperor Hong Feng!”

“Greetings, God Emperor Hong Feng!”

When Hong Fengyan arrived at the gate of the Holy Tower, all the surrounding experts and disciples of the holy region were slightly shocked and immediately bowed respectfully.

Some of the weaker ones even knelt on the ground with both knees.

“It’s fine. Don’t be so courteous!”

Hong Fengyan’s gaze swept across the surrounding people. She waved her hand and stood not far away from the entrance of the Holy Tower.

As the iconic building of the Holy Kingdom, the child Holy Tower, there were many people gathered around it.

And some saint-level experts would occasionally bring people in and out of the child Holy Tower.

Right now, their God Emperor Hong Feng was standing beside the sacred tower, causing everyone to be incomparably shocked.

“Greetings, God Emperor Hong Feng!”

The surrounding people, even those who were more than ten kilometers away, all bowed respectfully when they saw Hong Fengyan’s figure.

This was one of the six most powerful people who held great power in the saint-level.

“Do what you have to do!”

Hong Fengyan waved her arm and a breeze helped everyone up.

“Hehe, actually, it’s not bad to be a god Emperor of a faction!”

Shangshui god Emperor glanced around and said to Hong Fengyan with a smile.

“If Shangshui God Emperor is interested, you can join our holy region. If you join, we will also hold such a lively feast!”

Hong Fengyan laughed and joked.

“Hahaha, no, no, I still like to be free!”

Shangshui god Emperor laughed.

“Cough Cough, master, you can go back to the glazed star field. I also want to be an awesome second generation!”

Invincible battle technique said in a low voice.

“Peng!”

However, in the next moment, his body was pressed into the ground by Shangshui God Emperor, leaving only his head outside.

“HMPH!”

The God Emperor of Shangshui glared at invincible battle technique. Obviously, invincible battle technique had said something he did not want to hear, and it had opened up a wound!

“PFFT!”

Seeing this scene, Ye lui Ying and the others could not help but laugh out loud!

“What’s going on? Why is our God Emperor of Hong Feng standing at the entrance of the Holy Tower? He looks like he is waiting for someone!”

“I don’t know. The old man beside him is also a god Emperor. He is the god Emperor of Shangshui, a god Emperor whom our god Emperor of Hong Feng has befriended in the eight desolates.”

“They should be waiting for someone. To be able to make our God Emperor Hong Feng and another god Emperor wait at the door, he must be a god Emperor as well!”

“Is it our Lord Sacred Master?”

“It shouldn’t be our Lord Sacred Master. If it was our Lord Sacred Master, he would have gone to the mother Holy Tower. He wouldn’t need to come here!”

“Then who is it?”

In the surrounding area, everyone was chatting softly after bowing to Hong Feng Yan.

They would look in that direction from time to time, and their eyes were filled with curiosity.

“We’re here. I can already feel their aura!”

Not far away from the Holy Tower, Wang Xian led the six divine wind dragons and walked over with smiles on their faces.

Looking at the Holy Tower in front of him, he quickened his pace.

Soon, a few familiar figures appeared in his line of sight.

“Sir Dragon King, over here!”

When Wang Xian approached, Hong Fengyan, the water god Emperor, and the rest also noticed him.

Ye lui Ying looked at Wang Xian’s figure and waved her hand excitedly as she shouted loudly.

Regardless of the dispute between the Dragon Palace and the imperial court, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace was the only powerful celestial emperor that he knew and had talked so much about.

This was especially so since this divine emperor was the leader of a powerful force.

Ye lui Ying still felt very cordial and proud towards Wang Xian.

Look, i, Ye Lui Ying, know the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!

“Oh?”

“Dragon King? Dragon King of the Dragon Palace?”

Around the Holy Tower, some people who were paying attention to the situation over here trembled when they heard ye Lui Ying’s words. Their eyes widened in shock.

Dragon King!

In this bright starry sky, only the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace could be called the Dragon King.

Could it be?

At this moment, everyone’s eyes looked forward in unison.

A youth wearing a divine crown walked over.
