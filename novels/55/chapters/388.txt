Chapter 389: Since You Are Here, Don’t Bother Leaving (1)

“How dare he kill the Elder of our Sacred Followers Guild! Even if he escapes to the ends of the earth, he’s a goner!” an elder said emotionlessly as he headed inside.

Beside him were four other Elders who looked on with a face of apathy, while a group of aggressive-looking Sacred Enforcers followed behind.

The looming sense of brutality sent chills to the group of youths nearby. Even though they were merely tagging along at the back, they could clearly sense the overpowering aura coming from the Sacred Enforcers.

With his back slightly bent forward, Jiang Yuan directed the way for the group from the Sacred Followers Guild by taking the lead.

The crowd, made up of scores of men, walked into the villa with faces of intense somber.

Towards the end of the path, they arrived at a villa by the sea. Jiang Yuan turned towards the Elders of the Sacred Followers.

“Elders, this is the villa. Miracle Doctor Wang is right in this villa!” he explained respectfully.

“This is the place?” one of the elders asked flatly. With narrowed eyes, he looked beyond the entrance gates of the villa which was currently wide open.

“He’s really obnoxious, leaving his doors wide open. Is he waiting for us to enter?” another elder commented with glistening eyes.

“He’s asking for doom!” a burly Elder in the middle snorted before striding into the villa with wide steps.

“Be careful, Old Hu. Watch out for traps!” another Elder cautioned as he watched from the back.

“Humph, then I shall experience for myself the powers of this wicked genius!” The burly Elder dismissed the advice with little regard. Thereafter, he braced himself while a powerful force of aura surged from within his body and filled out every inch of space his attire could hold.

“Let’s go!” the Elders who had yet to make a move called out before following behind and making their way into the villa.

“Let’s tag along. Since the Elders from the Sacred Followers Guild did not chase us away, let’s follow behind,” the rest of the group whispered amongst themselves.

“Let’s distance ourselves further away, lest we get implicated should a fight really break out later,” one of them reminded.

“Don’t worry, given the prowess of the Sacred Followers Guild, they’ll crush that fellow. We’re very safe behind them!” another disagreed.

These youths who had tagged along behind the Elders hesitated for a brief moment before following behind their steps into the villa.

Boom!

A loud blast resonated across the sky. The weather was overcast as dark clouds loomed above before rain started to pour.

“Trespassers who take even one step into the villa shall die!” A voice spoke apathetically to the crowd.

To which, the crowd of youths looked inward in astonishment.

Within the courtyard, a young man was resting beneath the parasol by the swimming pool. With a tea set placed beside him, the young man sat idly while raising his head to gaze at the light drizzle with a calm and serene face.

Alongside the young man were seven others, which consisted of four youths and three middle-aged men.

It was the middle-aged man who stood nearest to the young man that spoke.

Amongst the septet, no one could tell the exact background of the four young men. As for the three middle-aged men, one of them looked very eye-catching with his really lengthy hair.

“Haha!” the burly Elder who had arrived by the door let out a dry laugh. His mouth hung slightly open while he stared at the young man beneath the parasol.

“You’re the lad who killed Elder Feng? Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown?” the burly Elder asked before he strode inside as ferocity raged in his eyes.

“Trespassers who take even one step into the villa shall die!” another plump Elder laughed as he looked at the warning sign beneath his feet before marching in.

“A factionless doctor who killed our Sacred Followers Guild Elder and pit himself against us. I wonder who gave you such courage. Or should I say, I wonder what gave you the confidence, such that you dare utter these words?” the plump elder continued. Meanwhile, the other Elders flooded their way in one by one.

Immediately after, they were followed by a group of over twenty Sacred Enforcers who shot the eight ahead a murderous look.

“Come on, let’s get inside too. Trespassers shall die? What a joke. How obnoxious for someone who’s about to meet his doom!” Jiang Yuan smirked as he watched members of the Sacred Followers Guild make their way in. As he joked, he slighted the eight inside the villa dismissively, shooting them a look of disregard.

“Haha, since they’ve said that trespassers shall die, I’m all the more tempted to get in!” Another youth dressed in a suit giggled as he skipped into the villa.

At the back, the youths who followed along began to scurry in one by one without a care.

As for the middle-aged men who mentioned how trespassers shall die? Have they shrugged it off completely?

“Perhaps they’re still unaware of how powerful the forces of the Sacred Followers Guild will be this time!” a youth laughed to himself as he smirked, while posting about the situation online.

He took a couple more photos and attached them along with his post, smiling as he did.

[We’ve entered the villa of Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown. Beside him are seven others. What made me laugh though was how they said ‘Trespassers who take even one step in shall die!’ Haha, how hilarious!]

The youth chuckled till his eyes formed slits. As he laughed, he raised his head and looked into the villa. “Wow, wow, wow!” he cheered.

“Wang Xian. You’ve killed our Sacred Followers Guild Elder. Accept your doom!”

Just then, the ringing of swords being drawn from their sheaths could be heard. One by one, the Sacred Enforcers began to flash the weapon in their hands.

The atmosphere within the villa was overwhelmed with an omen of carnage.

Astonishingly, even the raindrops dispersed themselves towards the perimeter and beyond, as if in fear.

“Hah!” Wang Xian snickered as he lowered the teacup in his hand onto the table. Raising his head, he looked up and scanned the crowd of experts from the Sacred Followers Guild.

“I did not look for you people. Little did I expect you guys to come looking for me instead. Splendid!” Wang Xian laughed.

“Obnoxious and arrogant young lad!” the burly Elder chided as he looked at Wang Xian, who sat, somewhat aloof. “I have to say, young lad, that you’re really impudent. To think you’ve got the nerve to be waiting for us here. Right now, you’ve dug your own grave. So I’ll leave you a complete body!” he added.

“A wicked genius who has been regarded as a rare occurrence in this millennium. Did you think that you’re already invincible? How dare you disregard our Sacred Followers Guild. I’ll give you a chance to end your own life now!” another Elder mocked, right after the burly Elder finished.

Just as the second Elder ended his words, a terrifying stance oozed from his body and forced its way over, in an attempt to cocoon Wang Xian.

“Haha, we’ll give you a chance to self-terminate!” the rest of the Elders chimed in unison. As they took a step forward, they, too, were oozing with the same stance.

Meanwhile, the group of Sacred Enforcers swiveled the weapon in their hands as they stood behind.

Boom!

Their threatening tenor filled the air within the villa. Across the sky, deafening thunder clapped once again as the drizzle grew into a thunderstorm.

Blob blob!

Yet, there was still not a drop of rain within the entire villa as they had been blocked off by the powerful stance.

Being tough as steel, the stance simply terrified all.

“Simply formidable. They’re really too powerful. With seven unrivalled Inborns and over twenty Half-step Inborns, they could even take down nine to ten Inborn experts!” one of the onlookers praised.

“The Elders of the Sacred Followers Guild are too forceful given such stance. Even our Clan Leader falls behind by a huge gap, I’m afraid,” another agreed.

“To think that even the rainwater is been forced out of the perimeters. Their stance is truly rock solid. Such is the powerful force of a Sacred Sect. With so many experts, what enemies can they not take out?” the third gasped. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“This young lad is doomed!” the last sniggered.
