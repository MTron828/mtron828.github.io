Chapter 4031: 4030 breakthrough!

Translator: 549690339

Wang Xian didn’t want to make any mistakes at the critical moment!

Any accidents would happen!

Even if the body of the Void Dragon was attacked, he could bear with it!

Grovel!

Grovel until his main body broke through!

At that time, no one in the entire sword and magic universe would be able to do anything to him!

The attack this time didn’t make Wang Xian too angry!

The provocation of a few ants was not enough to make him angry!

When both of Wang Xian’s bodies started to enter closed-door cultivation, time passed the fastest!

In the sword and Magic Universe, a group of forbidden holy grounds and holy academies were still cleaning up the abyss of Demonic Beasts in an orderly manner!

Long yinyin and long Yinhao sent some messages to Wang Xian from time to time, telling him about the situation of his training!

While Wang Xian was cultivating in seclusion, he also sent some replies.

Tens of millions of years passed in the blink of an eye!

On this day, Wang Xian received a message from long yinyin and long Yinhao at the same time!

“Huh?”

When he saw this message, his eyes narrowed slightly! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

At the abyss of Magical Beasts, a group of powerhouses from the forbidden grounds and the Saint Academy were suddenly attacked by a large number of magical beasts!

During these tens of millions of years, a group of warriors from the sacred lands and sacred academies had already cleared the Demon Beast Abyss to the 6th level!

A large number of demon beasts were killed by them!

But when they entered the 7th level, they were attacked!

The casualties were extremely heavy!

Over 1,000 universe ruler level 5 and above warriors were killed!

According to long yinyin and long Yinhao’s information, a demonic beast had launched a sneak attack on them. Furthermore, it was an organized sneak attack!

The sudden attack left all the masters unable to react in time!

The casualties were extremely heavy!

Furthermore, an organized Demonic Beast Army had appeared on the seventh level of the Demonic Beast Abyss!

Now, the group of holy grounds, forbidden grounds, and sacred academy had canceled the actions of the various teams. Instead, they had formed an entire army!

They even asked Wang Xian where he was now and if he had the time to meet them!

Wang Xian ignored the questions that came after and revealed a thoughtful expression!

The change in the abyss of demonic beasts might be related to the Agar Heavenly Demon God.

The Agar Heavenly Demon God, as an existence who was once blessed by the Heaven’s origin, possessed powerful intelligence.

He had even invaded the interior of the sword and Magic Universe.

Now that he was here again, he could naturally organize the demonic beasts to launch a sneak attack!

The only question was how strong this Aga Heavenly Demon God was!

How far away was he from the destiny realm of the Heaven’s origin!

“I hope this fellow can break through slowly. When I break through, I should be able to kill him and let the Unicorn ox devour him!”

Wang Xian mumbled to himself!

After regaining his dragon’s Roar and Dragon’s roar, Wang Xian continued his cultivation!

100 million years passed very quickly!

Wang Xian’s Void Dragon Body’s realm had also improved. He was now at level six, the ruler of the universe!

During these 100 million years, there were all sorts of news coming from the abyss of Demonic Beasts.

Now, after forming an army, the group of Holy Grounds and sacred academies had achieved consecutive victories!

They had killed a large number of demonic beasts!

Furthermore, during this battle, the group of Holy Grounds, forbidden grounds, and Saint Academy had undergone tremendous tempering!

This also made the group of holy grounds, forbidden grounds, and Saint Academy not anxious.

Using demonic beasts as grindstones.

They were not in a hurry to eliminate all of them!

After Wang Xian received this news, his eyes flickered slightly.

He didn’t know if it was done on purpose by the Asgardian demon god or something else!

In short, he did not care about it!

Time passed, and 100 million years passed once again!

Wang Xian’s void Dragon Body’s strength had reached the seventh level of the universe overlord.

When he reached this level, his improvement speed became extremely slow.

His main body was devouring energy in preparation for a breakthrough!

Without the support of his main body, the speed of his breakthrough had decreased by a lot!

According to Wang Xian’s estimation, it would take him at least 300 to 400 million years to advance to the level eight realm of the universe overlord!

He would have to calculate the time according to the speed!

After all, the place where Wang Xian went into seclusion for cultivation was not a treasured place!

Moreover, sometimes, it might not be as fast as going into seclusion for cultivation!

Long yinyin and long Yinhao had been fighting and training all this while. The speed of their improvement was extremely fast!

Time passed quickly!

Another 200 million years passed, and in these 200 million years, the sacred lands and sacred academies had completely used the Devil Beast Abyss as a training ground!

200 million years ago, not many experts died, but a large number of experts were born.

Later on, the unfettered forbidden land and flowing water forbidden land even issued an order to not exterminate all the Devil Beasts!

It was used as a training ground for the disciples and experts!

This had indeed allowed countless of strong disciples to gain experience and improve!

When Wang Xian looked at this information, he felt that it was very strange!

This Asgard Heavenly Demon God must be planning something!

It was just that he didn’t know what he was planning!

“I’m going to break through!”

During these hundreds of millions of years, he was located at the edge of the Sword and Magic Universe!

Wang Xian had been cultivating at the edge of the universe for hundreds of millions of years!

On this day, when Wang Xian converted the energy in his body into dragon energy.

Wang Xian instantly opened his eyes. His eyes were filled with excitement and excitement!

Crack Crack Crack

Following that, an extremely vast and mighty force was emitted from his body!

“Roar Roar Roar! ”

In the sky, an incomparably huge body of a divine dragon appeared out of thin air!

Wang Xian’s body had already reached the size of hundreds of thousands of kilometers.

He was comparable to a space beast!

In a breath’s time, the color of Heaven and earth changed!

The wind and clouds stirred!

In the chaos at the side, under the might of Wang Xian, the chaos was actually shaking continuously as if there was a huge earthquake!

“Ding, congratulations to host for increasing your level and breaking through to the seventh level of a universe overlord.”

“Ding, congratulations to host for breaking through. The nine origin dragon field has become stronger.”

At this moment, the system’s voice rang out!

He had broken through!

He had finally broken through!

He had used up all the resources of the Lin Niu!

After another 400 million years, Wang Xian had finally filled up the last 5% of his energy!

Finally, he had broken through!

Feeling the explosive energy coming from his body, Wang Xian’s body moved slowly! Boom

Crack! Crack! Crack

His body moved slightly, and cracks appeared in the surrounding void!

Even the universe could not withstand his might!

Terrifying!

Terrifying!

Wang Xian’s eyes shone with excitement!

(‘I don’t know if the current me can match up to the Heaven’s origin creation.

However, I can kill that Agar heavenly demon god, the Agar Heavenly Demon God I met back then, even if he used the shadow of the Demon God!”

At this moment, Wang Xian spoke confidently!

As for the Real Heaven’s origin creation, he needed to touch it personally to know if he could fight against it!

The augmentation of nine types of energy, the fusion of nine types of energy, and the circulation of nine types of energy!

This was the terror of the nine-origin Divine Dragon!

He was only at the seventh level of the Universe Overlord Realm!
