Chapter 1498: 1498, I will definitely kill you

At the venue of the birthday party, Lin Yaoyao glared at Wang Xian with a displeased expression.

She was extremely displeased with this fellow.

Last time, she merely asked him to carve something for her. In the end, the other party completely ignored her.

This time, he suiqing wanted to buy one of his pets, but he rejected it directly.

As the Princess of the Forest Goblin race, she was extremely displeased.

Upon hearing the words of the forest goblin, everyone looked at Wang Xian once again.

They knew that the guy in front of them was an idiot for rejecting miss he suiqing.

He feng stared at Wang Xian and narrowed his eyes slightly.

“These two guys didn’t even do a good job!”

He Feng was a little unhappy.

Before he entered the holy tree, he had instructed two of his subordinates to get rid of this kid in front of him.

Now that he didn’t see the two guys and didn’t get rid of this kid, it made him unhappy.

“Yaoyao, did this guy make you unhappy again?”

He Feng narrowed his eyes and looked at Lin Yaoyao who was at the side. He asked gently.

“No, sister he suiqing wanted to buy his pet cub just now. She promised him a lot of benefits, but he rejected her outright!”

“Oh right, he also said that he didn’t come to join brother He Yuan’s army. HMPH!”

Lin Yaoyao didn’t have a good impression of this extremely cold Wang Xian. She snorted softly.

“Oh? He didn’t come to join brother He Yuan’s army. He even injured someone here? is he here to cause trouble?”

He Feng looked at Wang Xian indifferently with a hint of coldness in his eyes.

“How dare you cause trouble at Brother He Yuan’s banquet? I think you don’t want to live anymore!”

The few he clan’s disciples behind he feng looked at Wang Xian coldly and said coldly.

A young man dared to reject miss he suiqing and Princess Lin Yaoyao. Naturally, they wouldn’t give him a good look.

“No, no, we are not here to cause trouble!”

Dui Dazhuang, who was standing at the side, saw the young masters of the He clan staring at Wang Xian. He broke out in cold sweat.

He quickly stepped forward and said.

“Huh?” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

He Feng and the rest looked at Dui Dazhuang with cold eyes. He lowered his head with a face full of fear and stood there motionlessly.

Wang Xian looked at Dui Dazhuang and smiled. This fellow was quite loyal. He even dared to step forward at this moment.

He swept his gaze across the He clan’s disciples, but his expression did not change at all.

When everyone around saw Wang Xian sitting there nonchalantly, ignoring he feng and the rest, they were stunned.

Even he suiqing and Lin Yaoyao were slightly taken aback.

Especially Lin Yaoyao. When she saw Wang Xian’s familiar cold expression, she gritted her teeth.

This fellow’s disdainful look made her look extremely displeased.

He wasn’t the only one who was unhappy.

When he feng saw Wang Xian’s nonchalant look again, a murderous intent shot out from his eyes.

Last time, it was because of this fellow’s attitude that he sent people to kill him directly.

However, he didn’t know why this fellow was still alive.

But this time...

“Since someone is courting death, I shall grant him his wish!”

He Feng puffed out his chest slightly and looked down at Wang Xian. The dragon on his chest looked a little ferocious and terrifying.

“Young master he Feng, this is...”

Everyone was slightly shocked when they heard he Feng’s words. Following that, they stared at Wang Xian as if they were looking at a dead man.

This fellow was really courting death.

He suiqing and Lin Yaoyao who were at the side frowned when they heard his words. However, they did not say anything.

“You?”

Wang Xian raised his head and stared at he feng with slight disdain.

He Feng was the one who sent people to assassinate him the last time. He knew very well that he didn’t come to settle the score with him, so he came to look for him again?

Even if he couldn’t kill him due to he yuan and the He clan’s reputation, he could still teach him a lesson.

“Me? Haha, Good, good. How interesting. Someone actually dares to say such words to me!”

When he feng heard Wang Xian’s words, he laughed maniacally as a hint of killing intent slowly emerged from his body.

“This fellow is really arrogant. Based on our Big Brother He Feng? Big Brother He Feng is a dragon among men!”

“Is he trying to provoke young master he Feng? How many dog lives does this fellow have?”

“My God, is there something wrong with this fellow’s brain? Not to mention young master he Feng’s status, just based on young master he Feng’s talent as a dragon among men, it would be a piece of cake to kill him!”

When the surrounding people heard Wang Xian’s provocative words, they discussed in astonishment.

They looked at Wang Xian as if he was an idiot.

A Guy actually dared to say such words to young master he feng. He actually dared to provoke the dragon among men, he feng. How many dog lives did he have?

Around them, tens of thousands of young men looked over and looked at Wang Xian with slight disdain.

When Gongsun Ning saw such an arrogant Wang Xian, his eyes revealed a look of excitement.

To dare to provoke young master he feng like this, no one could save him today.

“Today, if I, he Feng, don’t kill you, I won’t have to stay in the He clan anymore. Hehe!”

After he feng laughed out loud, his face revealed a hint of coldness. With a slight movement of his palm, a staff appeared in his hand.

“Hiss!”

When everyone around saw he feng preparing to make a move, they all took a deep breath.

Everyone knew that he feng was furious.

In front of so many people, he dared to provoke he feng. If it were anyone else, they wouldn’t let him off.

Furthermore, Wang Xian had made the first move to injure someone. Even if he had to kill him, the He clan would have a reason and wouldn’t blame he feng.

“Young master he yuan is here!”

At this moment, a voice rang out.

Everyone was slightly stunned. They turned around and looked at the holy tree.

“Haha!”

He Yuan’s loud laughter rang out. He was dressed in a green robe and looked energetic and dashing.

He looked at the banquet venue happily.

He swept his gaze across and shouted loudly, “Brother Wang Xian came from afar. Why aren’t you staying in the He clan to wait for me? You are really ungrateful!”

He shouted with a smile on his face. Wang Xian’s arrival was told to him by his father.

However, the He clan leader didn’t tell him too much. It was just as the He clan’s higher-ups had thought. Friends would be better if they were just friends.

They didn’t want he yuan to feel pressured.

As he Yuan’s only good friend, he was naturally very happy that Wang Xian was able to come to his birthday party.

He couldn’t help but shout out loud with laughter.

He Yuan’s cheerful greeting stunned everyone around him.

Who Was Wang Xian?

Even he suiqing, who was his fiancée, was stunned. She didn’t know who this Wang Xian was.

“I heard that you were in closed-door cultivation, so I didn’t disturb you!”

Wang Xian smiled when he saw he yuan flying over.

In the tomb of the demi-human, his relationship with long Xiaotian and he yuan was indeed quite good. He was also the only few good friends he had since he came to the supernatural continent.

“Haha, we haven’t seen each other for more than two years. I was planning to go to the flowing sea region to have some fun with you!”

When Wang Xian’s voice rang out, everyone was stunned.

Following that, they saw young master he yuan flying over happily. He landed beside Wang Xian and gave him a big hug.
