Chapter 1153: 1154 was furious

Translator: 5496903

He had a pure white skin color and a thin body. One of his arms was like a sickle, while the other was as sharp as a spike.

His two arms had slightly pointed heads!

This was the form of a strange demon, and it was also the first time that the strange demon’s form was displayed in front of everyone.

“Oh my God, is that... is that the assassin of the Dragon Assassin organization? It’s actually a type of Demon Beast!”

“That’s the master of undercurrent. The Master of undercurrent made a move, and the master of undercurrent actually made a move personally. Oh My God, that’s too terrifying!”

“I didn’t expect that the counterattack of the master of Undercurrent would come. Furthermore, it was so violent that he directly made a move in the city!”

“The master of undercurrent is so powerful. If he didn’t make a move, then so be it. Once he made a move, he directly caught the assassin of the Dragon Assassin, and the one in his hands is obviously a high-level member of the Dragon Assassin Organization!”

When the surrounding people saw this scene, their faces revealed a look of shock.

Bright Moon City was star-moon kingdom’s second largest city. However, even so, the master of undercurrent was still extremely violent, directly killing people within the city.

Moreover, he didn’t have the slightest scruple to reveal his figure. He killed the assassin of the dragon Spike on the spot and captured the high-ranking member of the Dragon Spike.

This scene caused everyone to be dumbstruck and incomparably shocked.

This was the master of undercurrent, the leader of the undercurrent assassin organization.

Strong people were respected, especially such domineering strong people. Many people felt slight admiration in their hearts.

“Dragon Spike Beast, Let’s start with you!”

The master of Undercurrent’s face revealed a cold expression. He controlled the blood-red water flow in his hand. With a slight movement, the strange monster’s body was directly split into pieces!

“The majesty of undercurrent can not be touched!”

He roared and grabbed the DRAKONID.

“Stop!”

“Stop right there!”

“You dare to kill people in Bright Moon City? You’re courting death!”

At this moment, the city guard who had arrived late roared and flew toward the position of undercurrent master.

Undercurrent master did not even glance at him. Instead, his gaze was directed toward the position below.

Everyone around was slightly stunned. Under his gaze, the faces of the youths suddenly revealed expressions of fear.

Just now, they were the ones who had spoken ill of undercurrent, saying that undercurrent was inferior to dragon spike.

“You dare to insult undercurrent, die!”

He waved his arm, and a blood sword directly attacked those youths.

“No!”

When the youths saw the master of undercurrent charging towards them, their faces revealed a look of fear as they hurriedly shouted.

“Ah!”

In just an instant, the bodies of the youths had turned into streams of blood.

This scene caused everyone to feel extremely terrified.

Those youths had merely discussed undercurrent, and had merely spoken ill of it. In the end, they had been killed.

Such madness, tyranny, and bloodlust terrified everyone.

This kind of person was too terrifying!

They absolutely could not be provoked!

“Stop!”

The city guards’expressions were extremely ugly when they saw this scene. Even though they had heard of undercurrent master’s madness, they were still extremely shocked when they saw it with their own eyes.

“HMPH!”

Undercurrent master snorted coldly and disappeared with the DRAKONID’s body.

Arriving! Killing! Leaving!

Master of undercurrent displayed without a doubt the bloodthirstiness and dominance of the leader of an assassin organization.

“Gulp, as expected of an assassin organization with forty years of foundation in star-moon kingdom. It’s too terrifying. His gaze is too terrifying!”

“Completely ignoring the rules of star-moon kingdom and directly killing people on the spot. Heavens, he’s too strong!”

“Dragon Spike is in trouble now. The master of undercurrent found the higher-ups of dragon Spike and casually killed a dragon assassin hiding in the surroundings!”

“This dragon assassin is actually a demon beast. It’s really unbelievable!”

The master of undercurrent left, leaving behind tens of thousands of people with shocked expressions.

They looked at the corpse of the dragon assassin on the ground and were shocked.

“Now, the Dragon Assassin is in trouble!”

“It’s an undercurrent assassin organization after all, and it’s not something the dragon assassin can offend. Now, the Master of undercurrent is completely furious!”

“Next, I wonder if the dragon assassin can withstand the anger of the undercurrent!”

“Damn it, damn the Dragon Assassin, I gave a mission today, and I gave a commission. Now... The mission is probably hanging by a thread!”

The surrounding people whispered to each other.

Those young men had been killed on the spot by the master of undercurrent for speaking ill of him.

This violent warning made everyone stop speaking ill of undercurrent. They didn’t even dare to have the slightest suspicion.

And the bloodlust and violence that the master of undercurrent had displayed was deeply engraved in everyone’s hearts. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

This kind of person was absolutely not to be provoked!

This was a madman!

The leader of the undercurrent assassin organization, undercurrent master, killed the dragon assassin on the spot and captured the Dragon Assassin’s higher-ups. In less than half an hour, the news spread throughout Bright Moon City.

This news undoubtedly shocked everyone.

The people of Bright Moon City originally thought that the dragon assassin dared to kill the son of undercurrent master and the Ace assassin of undercurrent. They thought that they could deal with undercurrent master. Now, it seemed that it was completely different from what they thought.

The domineering appearance of the Master of undercurrent made everyone see what was terrifying and bloodthirsty!

The entire bright moon city was talking about the master of undercurrent. News about the past of the master of undercurrent was also spread out.

When everyone heard about the master of undercurrent, their eyes were filled with fear.

“Dragon King, a spy was killed, a strange demon was killed, and long Qi was also captured by the Master of Undercurrent!”

A panicked voice sounded in the restaurant. Long Yi reported to Wang Xian anxiously.

The spy had been killed, long Qi had been captured, and even a strange demon had been killed. This was the first time the dragon assassin organization had suffered such heavy losses since its establishment.

This was also the most troublesome matter that the dragon assassin organization had encountered since its establishment.

“I already know!”

Wang Xian stood there with a gloomy face. His eyes were extremely cold.

“Ao Yao, Bring Me the soul of the Strange Demon First!”

He took out a piece of soul-returning wood from his interspatial ring and threw it to Ao Yao who was beside him.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao took it and immediately disappeared.

He looked outside and took a deep breath.

“A void interpretation expert personally took action. This is really out of my expectations. Madman, you are indeed a madman!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered.

It was indeed out of his expectations for the master of undercurrent to make a move personally. Killing someone on the spot was even more surprising to him.

Unbridled, this master of undercurrent was even more unbridled than Wang Xian.

“Right now, the dragon Spike doesn’t have the strength to kill you, so I’ll let you live a little longer. However, don’t think that you alone can stop the dragon Spike’s footsteps!”

“You, the master of Undercurrent, can’t do it. Not even a void interpretation expert can do it!”

“You want me, the dragon spike, to wait and destroy my dragon spike? Hehe. Next, I’d like to see where you, the master of Undercurrent, will put your face!”

Anger rose in Wang Xian’s heart.

He was angry at the arrogance and arrogance of the master of undercurrent. He was also angry that the dragon Spike couldn’t kill him directly.

However, he would return it to him. Next, he would collect some interest first!
