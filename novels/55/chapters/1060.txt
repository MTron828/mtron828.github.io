Chapter 1061: Instructor 1062 also had to obey

Translator: 5496903

The Wind Arrow Mountain region was one of the five most dangerous regions near Donghai city.

If one wanted to reach Shenghai town, one had to cross the Wind Arrow Mountain.

Wang Xian had crossed the wind arrow mountain once before. The most dangerous part of the Wind Arrow Mountain was the hidden demonic beasts.

They were highly intelligent and knew how to control the ferocious beasts to set up an ambush. Everyone had to be careful here.

However, with so many of them around, and with so many strong people around, the demonic beasts didn’t dare to attack rashly.

With their intelligence, they knew who to provoke and who not to provoke.

“Those who are good at speed and scouting are in front and on both sides. Those who are good at defense will follow closely behind. Those who are good at close combat will follow closely behind. Those who are good at long-range attacks will be in the middle and travel forward in a triangle!”

After entering the region of the Wind Arrow Mountain, Wang Xian immediately gave an order to everyone.

More than 500 people were moving forward. They had to form a formation to deal with unexpected situations. If there were demonic beasts or ferocious beasts attacking, they would be able to react immediately and not suffer any losses.

Based on his experience and understanding, the scout was positioned at the front to scout out the situation. The Scout would be in the front to defend against the first wave of attacks. The warrior would then be ready to charge at any time.

The Scout was positioned at the center to protect the long-range attacker.

“Yes!”

They didn’t dare to resist Wang Xian’s order. After all, he was the leader of the team this time. Furthermore, he was an expert at level seven of the supernatural realm.

No one dared to object, nor could they object.

The students began to form a team according to their own abilities and abilities.

“You are here. Switch positions with him. And you...”

Wang Xian had the light and dark fire dragon eyes. He could see everyone’s strength and attributes clearly. He could easily make arrangements.

Looking at Wang Xian’s commands, all the students were slightly shocked.

“Captain, you are so amazing. You can actually see everyone’s strength and strengths!”

Xia Hou Ming licked Wang Xian daily and said with some flattery.

“Captain, do you have some kind of scouting ability? You have to know that I have a hidden ability. No one knows that my strength has reached extraordinary level five!”

A young man who was prepared to fish in troubled waters said with a bitter face.

He was really convinced. He was good at hiding himself. None of his classmates knew that his strength had improved. He did not expect that Wang Xian would still be able to see through it.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly, causing the surrounding people to show a look of surprise.

The five instructors at the side also looked at each other in slight surprise.

From the looks of it, Wang Xian’s command was not bad at all. In fact, it was very strong.

This made director Qian frown slightly.

“Let’s go, let’s go. Those at the front, be careful and be alert. Change your positions in half an hour. Don’t let your guard down. Otherwise, you might be the ones who die!”

Wang Xian shouted softly and came to the front. He dashed away quickly.

Seeing that Wang Xian was walking at the front, the students at the back were also slightly impressed.

The group of people moved quickly.

Just as Wang Xian had expected, they didn’t encounter any danger in the wind arrow mountain area.

Under the circumstance where so many people were still so powerful, the hidden demonic beasts didn’t dare to attack.

They only used three hours to cross the wind arrow mountain area which took them more than a day to cross with the caravan.

Their speed increased by more than eight times.

“It seems that the oceanography academy and the EASTSEA Academy haven’t come out yet!”

“We only took three hours to pass through the region of Wind Arrow Mountain. Our speed is already fast enough!”

“Continue. Let’s go. We must be the first to enter Shenghai Town!”

After passing through the region of wind arrow mountain, their speed increased once again.

“Let’s Rest for a while!”

Three hours later, Wang Xian looked at the area of the Blackwater Swamp in front of him. He waved his hand and asked everyone to stop.

“The area in front of us is the Blackwater Swamp area. Around here, there might be ferocious beasts, the decedent crocodiles, hiding around at any time. The decedent crocodiles are very strong. In comparison, this area is even more dangerous than the area of the Wind Arrow Mountain!”

Wang Xian said, “There are carrion crows flying in the sky. They are also a very disgusting ferocious beast. Once they appear, there will be hundreds or even thousands of them. They are definitely not easy to deal with!”

“There are so many of us. Who cares about the Imperial Croc or Carrion Crows? We can easily crush them!”

Qian Hu said expressionlessly when he heard Wang Xian’s words.

“That’s right. We are so strong. It’s just a Blackwater Swamp. There’s no need to be so worried!”

When Qian Hu spoke, a few young men quickly chimed in.

The rest of them did not take Blackwater swamp to heart. After all, among them, four of their mentors were at level seven and one of their directors was at level eight.

With them, ordinary ferocious beasts were no match for them.

“It’s best to be careful!”

Wang Xian took a glance at them and rested for more than ten minutes before they entered the Blackwater Swamp area.

As for the people from the East Ocean Academy and the Ocean Academy, they had no idea where they were.

“Let’s Go!”

As everyone entered the Blackwater Swamp, Wang Xian scanned the area below vigilantly.

In Wang Xian’s opinion, the Blackwater Swamp was even more dangerous than wind arrow mountain.

No matter how many people there were in the Blackwater Swamp, once you entered my attack range, you would attack immediately.

If there was an overlord crocodile which was at transcendent level six or seven, the five instructors would not be able to save you in time.

However, what surprised Wang Xian was that he did not encounter an overlord crocodile even after three hours of traveling at high speed.

“We don’t dare to attack rashly even if it’s a ferocious beast.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Qian Hu’s voice rang in everyone’s ears. All the students nodded slightly. They knew that Wang Xian was overthinking.

“Speed Up!”

A teacher who was flying in the sky said directly.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and didn’t say anything. The group of people flew at a high speed.

Boom

When they were flying for half an hour, a loud sound suddenly came from ahead.

“Caw Caw Caw!”

At this moment, the faint cries of carrion crows could be heard.

Wang Xian waved his hand and everyone immediately stopped.

“What’s going on? Are there ferocious beasts ahead?”

“Look at the left and right positions ahead. There are groups of Carrion Crows!”

“There are so many carrion crows. There are at least tens of thousands of carrion crows on both sides. The left side is a little better. There are only about a thousand of them!”

The students stopped and looked astonished.

There were all kinds of weeds growing under the black soil. In some places, there were even pools of black swamp water.

The Sun had already set in the sky. The entire world was filled with a dark gray color. It gave people a dark, abyss-like world.

Wang Xian immediately flew into the sky and looked ahead with all his might.

“There are so many emperor crocodiles!”

When he looked ahead, his pupils contracted slightly and a hint of shock appeared on his face.

There were actually more than a thousand emperor crocodiles gathered in front of him. Among them, there were two gigantic emperor crocodiles fighting.

The two emperor crocodiles had a body size of 20 meters and their strength was at least at level eight.

“What are they doing?”

Wang Xian frowned and looked to the left and right.

They couldn’t go ahead and had to take a detour. There were carrion crows on both sides but there were only a thousand of them on the left. Their strength didn’t exceed level four of the supernatural realm.

“We can’t go ahead. Let’s go to the left!”

Wang Xian flew to the front of everyone and said directly.

“Huh?”

All the students were slightly stunned and showed astonishment on their faces. “Captain, there’s no need to take a detour. Moreover, if we take a detour to the left, we will run into those Carrion Crows!”

“The position in front is dangerous. The safest way is to take the left!”

Wang Xian said straightforwardly.

“If we take a detour to the left, we will waste another half an hour. Moreover, if the carrion crows attack us, we will waste another half an hour!”

Qian Hu looked at Wang Xian and the corner of his mouth curled up slightly. “According to me, if we take a detour directly, even if we run into ferocious beasts, we will waste at most half an hour!”
