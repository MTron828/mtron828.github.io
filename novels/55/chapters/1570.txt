Chapter 1571: In 1571, there was a girl growing up

“Hello, my name is Wang Xian!”

Wang Xian looked at Ling Jian ‘er who was staring at him with a twinkle in her eyes. His face was filled with a smile.

He stretched out his hand and placed it in front of Ling Jian ‘ER. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ling Jian ‘er looked at Wang Xian who was standing in front of her. Looking at his palm, she was a little stunned.

The statue that appeared every morning, the image of her when she was in danger in the Black Screen Garden appeared in her mind one after another.

“Hello, my name is... Bing Jian ‘er!”

Ling Jian ‘er stretched out her hand and held Wang Xian’s hand. After hesitating for a moment, she opened her mouth and said.

“If you have nothing to do these few days, I can come and look for you, right?”

Wang Xian looked at Ling Jian ‘ER and continued with a smile in his eyes.

“Sure!”

Ling Jian ‘er looked at him staring at her with a burning gaze. She lowered her head slightly and said softly.

“Alright, I’ll See You Tomorrow then!”

Wang Xian smiled and nodded at the king of Bingxin. He then turned around and walked towards the He clan.

“Haha, Jian ‘er, you should get along well with the priest of the sage king in the future, understand?”

The king of Bingxin was smiling happily from behind.

However, the ninth prince who was standing at the side looked extremely embarrassed when he heard his father’s words.

He clenched his fists tightly and his body was trembling slightly. His eyes were filled with anger and unwillingness!

“Brother Wang Xian!”

At this moment, everyone from the He clan looked at Wang Xian who was walking towards them with a strange expression on their faces.

In fact, when the Wuji Empire conferred Wang Xian the title of the saint of Light, their expressions were extremely strange.

Their he clan knew that the Sky Demon was Wang Xian.

A heavenly demon who slaughtered the ancient city of demons and killed 25 experts at level seven of the Seethrough realm was actually conferred the title of Saint by the Wuji Empire.

Damn it, if others were to know about this, it would probably cause a commotion!

The Saint of light was the heavenly demon. Who could believe it?

Unbelievable!

However, knowing the truth, they were filled with reverence towards this Wang Xian.

Even an expert at level seven of the Seethrough realm from the He clan was filled with awe and respect.

It was terrifying to think that a person could be the sage of light and the heavenly demon.

“There are some things that happened a few days ago. Let’s have a good gathering today!”

Wang Xian walked over and patted he yuan on the shoulder.

“Haha, sure, Sure. I really didn’t expect brother Wang Xian to be able to reach such a level!”

He Yuan laughed out loud as he spoke.

The rest of the He clan also came over to greet him. Wang Xian chatted with them for a while before leaving with he yuan.

At this moment, in the vast region, the voice of the Patriarch of Wuji Empire Shook Everyone.

Priest Wang was conferred the title of Saint of light by Wuji Empire. This title was not undeserved.

Everyone had to acknowledge the title of being conferred by one of the three major forces.

In a few hours, the news of priest Wang using his powerful light technique to expel the rank 7 insightful void Tier Darkness Soul from the crown prince’s body spread throughout the entire vast region.

Soon after, the news that priest Wang had the strength of a rank 7 insightful void tier was also spread out.

Soon, everyone was in an uproar. Their faces were filled with shock as they discussed animatedly.

“Rank 7 insightful void tier, that guy is actually a rank 7 insightful void tier!”

In soli sect, the two heaven’s pride experts in heaven and earth had extremely ugly expressions when they heard the news.

They looked at each other and clenched their arms with unwillingness.

Seventh level of the profound void tier, and he was also conferred the title of the Saint of light by Wuji Empire. With their abilities, there was no way for them to take revenge!

...

“Jian ‘er, you should rest well and get dressed properly tomorrow. Priest Wang might come and look for you!”

In front of Ling Jian ‘ER’s courtyard, King bingxin instructed her with a smile.

“En!”

Ling Jian ‘er nodded and walked into the courtyard.

“Father, didn’t you... didn’t you say that you wanted to marry Jian ‘er to your son?”

At the side, the ninth prince, Bing Jinghuan, looked at his father unwillingly and said with a trembling body.

“My son, it’s not that Father doesn’t want to betroth Jian ‘er to you. From the looks of it, Jian ‘er being able to marry that priest Wang is the best choice!”

“Not to mention that priest Wang’s strength and potential, don’t forget that one of our forefathers has been invaded by the soul of darkness. If he can be cured, our Bingxin dynasty will have one more peerless expert at the eighth level of the profound void tier!”

“In the future, don’t even think about targeting Jian ‘er. be more polite to that priest Wang!”

Bingxin king patted Bingjing Huan’s shoulder and said earnestly.

This caused Bingjing Huan to lower his head, his expression somewhat malevolent.

...

“That is the great sage, priest Wang!”

“It is the great sage, priest Wang. I heard that he can even expel the soul of darkness of rank seven of the profound void tier from his body. His light arts are unrivalled. Even the forefather of dawn light is inferior to him!”

“He’s really amazing. He’s already standing at the peak at such a young age. In the future, when he’s in the vast region, all the factions will have to be polite to him!”

“The sage looks so approachable. Back then, he saved nearly 100,000 people for free. He’s a good person!”

The next day, when Wang Xian was walking towards the area of the bingxin empire, respectful voices could be heard from the surrounding roads.

Wang Xian was in a good mood as he smiled and walked straight to the front of Ling Jian ‘ER’s courtyard.

“Your Highness, the Sage, priest Wang, requests to see you!”

The maid quickly entered the courtyard and said to Ling Jian ‘ER.

“Yes, let him in!”

Ling Jian ‘er walked out of the room with light makeup on. She looked towards the door.

“Jian ‘er!”

Wang Xian smiled and walked over immediately.

Ling Jian ‘er looked at the handsome Wang Xian and smiled. “Young master Wang!”

“I have a gift for you!”

Wang Xian walked forward and took out sculptures one by one and handed them to her.

Ling Jian ‘er looked at the sculptures and smiled. In the morning, when he didn’t receive the sculptures at the door, there was an indescribable feeling in his heart.

Now that he saw them, his mood was much better.

“Thank you!”

Ling Jian ‘ER took it and sat in front of a stone bench with Wang Xian. They started chatting.

Wang Xian and Ling Jian ‘er didn’t talk about the past. Instead, they used his perfect tongue to talk nonsense.

The morning passed very quickly. In the afternoon, Ling Jian ‘er wanted to practice her swordsmanship.

Wang Xian thickened his skin and didn’t leave. He sat there and watched Ling Jian ‘er practice her swordsmanship.

When he saw her swordsmanship, he had an idea and called Ao jian over.

Ao Jian practiced the heartless sword principle. Now that he could kill a level six Seethrough void martial artist, his swordsmanship was much better than Ling Jian ‘ER’s.

With Ao Jian’s guidance, Ling Jian ‘er was delighted. She thanked Wang Xian many times.

This made him very happy. It wouldn’t be long before Ling Jian ‘er was taken care of by him.

For the next two days, Wang Xian spent all his time with Ling Jian ‘er during the day.

At first, she was still not used to it. However, under Wang Xian’s thick skin, she quickly got used to it.

Furthermore, her mood was much more cheerful. Her relationship with Wang Xian had improved tremendously every day.

Naturally, Wang Xian didn’t want Ling Jian ‘ER to look cold. He teased and teased her every day, which changed Ling Jian ‘ER’s character a lot.
