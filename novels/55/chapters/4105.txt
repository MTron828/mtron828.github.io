Chapter 4106 - 4106: 4105 found the target and attacked!

Translator: 549690339

The 12 ancestral witches did not receive any news about the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin creation.

They came here earlier than Wang Xian.

They also searched more places than Wang Xian.

However, they did not find any news about the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin creation.

According to their speculation and sensing, the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin creation should not have been born yet.

Wang Xian chatted with the twelve ancestral witches for a short while before they parted ways.

A large number of Heaven’s origin creation powerhouses were gathered together, and it was easy for them to be discovered by the Heaven’s origin creation powerhouses in this universe.

Once they were discovered, it would be difficult for them to fight back.

After all, their strength had been suppressed. The Heaven’s origin creation powerhouses in the six paths universe were in the right place at the right time.

In their own universe, they were invincible.

Unless there were more than ten Heaven’s origin destinies working together to take out their trump cards to attack one heaven’s origin destinies of the six paths universes.

Otherwise, it was impossible to fight against them.

“Let’s go, let’s continue to the Grassland! ” Wang Xian continued to speak to Lin Niu.

They flew towards the grassland again.

The two Heaven’s origin destinies of the Void Universe should be at the grassland.

It was impossible for them to target him.

Their target was the Heaven’s origin creation treasure.

There was no reason for the two heaven’s origin creation powerhouses to keep tracking them.

Therefore, Wang Xian determined that they were at the grassland.

Wang Xian and the Unicorn ox arrived at the location of the grassland a year later.

The grassland of the six paths universe was a real grassland.

There were plants that stretched as far as the eye could see. There were all kinds of plants.

Occasionally, one could even see some trees and rivers that flowed past!

The entire grassland was exceptionally beautiful and filled with rich vitality. The rich vitality of the wood attribute made this area exceptionally beautiful.

“Begin the search! ”

Wang Xian moved his palm and took out the skywriting compass. He looked at the information on it.

The Scouting treasure forged by the 12 ancestral warlocks was extremely effective.

In addition, the powerhouses of the Heaven’s origin realm who entered the six paths universe were usually located at the six treasured lands.

Therefore, the chances of Wang Xian and the rest finding them were very high when they searched the grassland.

“According to the 12 ancestral warlocks, there are more than 10 powerhouses of the Heaven’s origin realm in the Void Universe. I should be able to find them myself. ”

Wang Xian thought to himself and began to fly in the direction of the grassland.

He opened a map and began to search in a carpet-like manner.

“There is a tribe ahead. Let’s go there.”

After searching for more than half a year, Wang Xian looked ahead and spoke to the Unicorn Ox.

Wang Xian was carrying a wood attribute bow and arrow on his back. He was also holding a sharp wood attribute sword in his hand.

His body was emitting a wood attribute energy.

This kind of attire was very common in the prairie.

The Unicorn ox beside him was covered by Wang Xian’s wood attribute energy. If it wasn’t the Heaven’s origin ability, one wouldn’t be able to tell.

The tribes in the prairie were all located in a large forest.

The trees grew into the shape of houses. With a glance, it was exceptionally beautiful.

However, when Wang Xian had just entered the front of the tribe, the empty compass in his hand trembled slightly.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

A ball of energy appeared on the empty empty compass.

When Wang Xian saw the change in the empty compass, his gaze froze slightly.

(‘I really didn’t expect to find a heaven origin creator in the starry universe here.”

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly as a smile appeared on his face.

According to the information displayed on the empty text compass, the heaven origin creator from this starry universe was very far away from Wang Xian.

He was probably at another location in this tribe!

“Between the heaven origin creator and the six paths universe, both parties are trying their best to conceal their auras. Unless they are within a range of tens of thousands of meters, it would be difficult to discover the other party. ”

“This compass is very powerful. As expected of one that is specially made for the powerhouses of the Void Universe. However, the range of this compass is still limited. ”

Wang Xian mumbled to himself. He gestured to the Unicorn Bull at the side and flew towards the other direction of the tribe.

“It’s just ahead. There are still about 20,000 meters left. ”

According to the information on the skytext compass, Wang Xian was calculating in his mind as he looked in that direction.

Wang Xian did not make a move immediately. In fact, he was not prepared to make a move himself.

It was impossible for him and Lin Niu to kill a heaven’s origin creator in the Void universe by themselves.

Therefore, he was prepared to borrow strength.

The twelve ancestral sorcerers had killed a heaven’s origin creator in the Void Universe.

In fact, they did not kill him personally.

Instead, they had placed a curse on him.

This curse was able to expose his body and attract the attention of the heaven origin creator in the six paths universe. Then, they would come and kill him.

Wang Xian did not have the ability to curse, but he did have an ability.

Void pursuit!

As long as he locked onto a heaven’s origin creator in the Void universe, he only needed to send the information to the Heaven’s origin creator in this universe.

As for such a message, Wang Xian already had a plan.

His body moved and he immediately flew into the distance, entering the interior of this tribe.

Soul capture! ”

Wang Xian’s mind moved. His gaze locked onto a few powerhouses who were at level one and level two of the Masters of the universe. He immediately used the soul capture power!

Waves of information entered his mind.

Finally, he locked onto a middle-aged man.

This middle-aged man’s grandfather was an elder of this tribe. He had the strength of a level eight universe dominator.

The strongest leader of this tribe was only at the level nine of the universe dominator.

“Sure, let’s try it out!”

Wang Xian had a plan in his mind.

He controlled the middle-aged man who was at the second level of the universe dominator to come to an area more than 100,000 meters away from where the skywriting compass was pointing.

Wang Xian looked in that direction and moved his palm.

The void energy of the incipient holy wings was condensed in his hand. He waved his arm and this energy accurately covered that area.

” HNIM?”

At the same time, an old man was sitting on a building in that area and drinking tea.

Suddenly, his gaze focused as he sensed a wave of energy coming towards him.

The energy wasn’t strong, but he wanted to avoid it, but he realized that he couldn’t avoid it at all.

“What’s the situation? It’s not the six paths universe’s attribute, it’s the wind and thunder attribute. ”

He instantly stood up and his figure immediately disappeared.

He teleported to a location in the sky, but at this moment, he sensed that the energy sitting on his body wasn’t the energy of the six paths universe.

“There are heavenly fate powerhouses nearby, from other universes. ”

His eyes instantly revealed a cold expression as he hurriedly sensed the energy that landed on his body.

“It’s not the power of a curse. It shouldn’t be the 12 ancestral warlocks of the nine-origin universe. ”

He inspected it and thought to himself.

However, he also discovered that this energy was attached to his body, and he needed to completely remove it.

Someone definitely wants to set me up. ”

He was certain in his heart. Without the slightest hesitation, he instantly teleported far away..
