Chapter 637: Plotting (1)

Puff puff!

“They are in. They are finally in!”

“Who would have expected us to meet the Dragon King in this place!?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Seeing Wang Xian and the five girls enter, those middle-aged men standing outside wiped the cold sweat from their faces.

From the beginning to the end, Wang Xian didn’t speak on the matter. Nonetheless, this still brought immense pressure to them.

The name of “Dragon King” had resounded throughout China after the incident a month ago.

He was definitely an existence that no one could afford to offend in all of China. Even if it was just criticism, no one dared to.

This was respect and fear built on violence!

Director Wang turned around to look at the group of five and his attention fell on the two artistes under his company.

At this very moment, the five of them stood in one corner, feeling horrified.

That’s right! They were horrified! It was as though they had just witnessed something terrifying.

“Director Lin, leave the five of them to us!”

Director Wang looked at the few people around him, pulled a long face and remarked.

“Yeah, leave them to us. Make sure you handle this cleanly. We can’t afford to draw the irk of that guy!”

“You don’t have to kill them. Crippling them would be sufficient!”

Several other directors nodded their heads.

The group of five had turned as pale as snow and despair filled their faces.

“Director, we have learned our lesson. We have learned our lesson. Please let us go. Director, we are artistes under your company!”

When that male star heard the conversation of Director Wang, his face was incomparably pale as he begged for mercy from the middle-aged man.

“It isn’t that I wouldn’t want to let you off. It’s that you guys have courted your own deaths. You have offended the only person that couldn’t be offended in China. Yang Ze was a good example. Who would have thought that you guys would court your own deaths? Don’t blame me for being merciless!”

Director Wang stared emotionlessly at them.

“What? Yang Ze?”

That male star was stunned and despair filled his face.

Yang Ze was also an artiste under Heavenly King Media. A few months ago, he was announced dead by the official channel of Heavenly King Media.

At that time, the entire company was shocked. Initially, everyone thought he had really passed away.

What they learned later was that he had offended some terrifying figure. The infuriated Director announced he was dead right away and hid away from the public. Nothing was heard about him since then.

Subsequently, they found out that Yang Ze’s family had declared bankruptcy were now beggars.

“No, no...”

He staggered back unconsciously and his eyes were dead.

“Both of you have offended the same person. However, as compared to the previous case... Forget it. Regardless, your future is over!”

Director Wang didn’t explain further. He looked at the few people around him and started calling up more people.

“Xiao Xian, I had not expected your name to be able to command such fear and respect!”

When they entered the show, Lan Qingyue smiled radiantly as she spoke to Wang Xian.

She could recognize some of those middle-aged men. All of them were huge characters that could match her Lan Family.

“As long as the Nine Cauldron Worlds have not descended into the world, no force is a match for ours in the country. They are naturally fearful of me!”

Wang Xian chuckled. After experiencing the cleansing of the Underworld, he naturally knew his standing within the Underworld and all of China.

“I wonder what changes the people from those worlds will bring to the country. Will there be chaos and riots?” Sun Lingxiu pondered before asking.

“I don’t know. However, each Cauldron World has approximately ten million people. All of them together will add at least a hundred million to the population. There will probably be huge changes to China,” said Wang Xian.

Other than the huge population, almost everyone in the Nine Cauldrons Worlds practiced martial arts.

At that time, the setting of the Underworld would change completely.

In fact, even the lands of the country would experience major changes.

Besides that, the descent of the nine cauldrons to the real world would bring about a terrifying impact.

That was that the nine cauldrons would stabilize and ensure the stability of the country.

When the nine cauldrons stabilized all of China, spiritual energy would be greatly increased.

The land of China would gather spiritual Qi from the entire earth. At that time, the entire earth would be affected.

No one knew the changes this would bring to the other countries and regions.

The future was filled with uncertainties. There was a high probability that a world of ancient martial arts would slowly descend into the world.

Just as Wang Xian was thinking, the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show had started and beautiful models started their walk!

Xiao Yu, Lan Qingyue and the other girls pointed at the beautiful girls on stage while commenting.

They were commenting on their clothing and they were extremely excited about it.

Wang Xian chuckled and watched with excitement.

The faces of western girls can’t be compared with Adjaya and the girls. Adjaya’s figure is overwhelmingly better. In the aspect of facial features, Qingyue, Lingxiu and the rest are miles ahead!

After seeing a dozen-odd beautiful girls, Wang Xian’s interest level declined.

Ordinary people can’t be compared with martial artists. It is especially so for a powerful martial artist like Adjaya.

Fair and silky skin like a baby and the correct curves at the front and back. That feeling... Hehe!

“Leader, take a look around. Whoever catches your eyes, I’ll send her to you tonight!”

At this moment, Wang Xian heard the voice of a middle-aged man from his side.

There was a fifty-odd-year-old man beside him. The old man was burly and felt like he was brimming with strength.

Hehe!

The old man squinted his eyes and said, “Those on the stage are beautiful but those below the stage are even better!”

As the old man spoke, he turned his head around and faced Lan Qingyue and the girls.

“Oh?”

The middle-aged man raised an eyebrow, chuckled sheepishly and said, “Leader, leave this to me. I’ll definitely send them all to you tonight!”

Mmm!

The old man nodded his head while playing with his little beard before turning around and leaving with a vile look.

With Qingyue, Lingxiu and Adjaya’s figures and looks, they are indeed magnets for trouble wherever they go!

Wang Xian shook his head gradually. A blue and red light flashed across his eyes as he looked at the middle-aged and old men.

Huh? Dan Realm experts?

Wang Xian was taken aback. He squinted his eyes and sank into deep thought.

His intentions of putting these two guys to rest had also dissipated gradually.

Wang Xian didn’t say a word and simply accompanied Xiao Yu, Lan Qingyue and the girls till the end of the show.

After the show, the five girls pulled Wang Xian along for supper energetically.

Supper on the yacht was a unique attraction of the Glacier Coral Island. Each yacht wasn’t large and could fit seven to eight people. At the same time, each yacht had all kinds of delicacies.

The five girls wished to have supper out at sea. Thus, Wang Xian rented a small yacht and steered it towards the sea.

There were many other yachts around them. Each yacht had several lanterns hanging around, making the scenery of the water’s surface extremely beautiful.

Wang Xian looked towards the shore and revealed a faint smile.

“You guys can have your dinner here in a while. I have something to handle!” Wang Xian said to the five girls.

“Huh? Brother, what’s the matter?” Xiao Yu looked towards Wang Xian curiously.

“They must be from some forces of the disordered region. I need to settle some stuff!”
