Translator: 5496903

“You... I. . .”

In the square where the tenth grade students of the Demon Hunter College were, the entire area was silent.

Everyone stared at Qian Hu and the rest who were lying on the ground in disbelief. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

At this moment, Qian Hu widened his eyes and looked at Wang Xian who was on the stage with an embarrassed expression.

His body trembled slightly as he felt the entanglement of the thorns on his body.

He didn’t even have time to react to the attack just now. Furthermore, he couldn’t break free from the bondage of the thorns.

The strength of the opponent...

“I’ll lead the team. Is there anyone who is still unconvinced?”

Wang Xian looked at everyone below and asked again.

Gulp

A young man gulped and shook his head hurriedly.

The rest of the senior students stood there in shock as well. They stared at Wang Xian with their mouths Agape. No one dared to speak or object.

To defeat Qian Hu in one move, what kind of strength was that? He was at least at level seven of the supernatural realm.

A Freshman of a level seven supernatural realm powerhouse? What the F * ck...

Some of them had a dark expression on their faces. They were grade ten graduates who were about to graduate.

The strongest Qian Hu was only at level six of the supernatural realm. However, a freshman had already reached level seven of the supernatural realm.

How were they supposed to live?

“Do you guys still have any objections?”

Wang Xian saw that everyone was silent. His gaze landed on Qian Hu and the rest who were lying on the ground as he asked indifferently.

“We... We don’t have any objections, Captain!”

“I don’t have any objections either...”

A few young men whose faces were flushed red from being strangled by the brambles shouted hurriedly in a low voice.

Wang Xian smiled. The lightning strike wood in his hand moved slightly and the brambles on their bodies disappeared immediately.

He looked at Qian Hu who had an awkward expression and looked at him quietly.

Everyone looked over as well. When they saw Qian Hu who had an awkward expression, they felt a wave of sympathy.

Initially, with Qian Hu’s strength and prestige, he would have no problem being the leader this time. However, they didn’t expect a new genius to appear out of nowhere.

“I... Submit!”

Qian Hu saw everyone gathering on him. His face alternated between red and white as he gritted his teeth and said.

Wang Xian moved his arm and released the thorn that was tied to Qian Hu’s body.

Qian Hu stood up with an awkward expression.

On the stage, Qian Hu’s father’s face darkened. He glanced at Wang Xian with a gloomy expression!

“Vice-principal, when do we set off?”

Wang Xian looked at vice-principal Zhao and asked.

“The situation is urgent. We will set off in two hours. We will first head to the East Gate and meet up with the ocean cultivators!”

As deputy headmaster Zhao spoke, he looked at the few middle-aged men and elders beside him. “There will be five mentors following you this time. The mentors will be led by director Qian. Director Qian and the rest will assist you with some matters!”

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded and looked at the five hundred plus students below. “We will meet up at the East Gate in two hours. No one is allowed to be late by a minute. Even if they are late, there is no need for them to come!”

“Yes, Captain!”

Xia houming and a few others responded loudly.

Wang Xian waved his hand and said to vice-president zhao, “I will go and make some preparations too!”

“Alright, we can set off directly later!”

Vice-president Zhao nodded his head.

Wang Xian walked straight out. He wanted to bring Ao Jian, strange demon, and the rest along.

This time, the demonic beasts were wreaking havoc. To him, this might be a great opportunity.

“Captain Wang Xian, we’ll meet at the East Gate later!”

Xia houming and the rest ran over and said to Wang Xian with smiles on their faces.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly.

“With captain Wang Xian around this time, we’ll definitely be able to massacre everyone!”

A member of the amethyst mercenary group said with a smile on his face.

They had all witnessed Wang Xian’s strength, so they were naturally very impressed.

“No wonder he was able to kill Yun Hanhai Snake Mark and the rest. It turns out that he is also so powerful!”

“A new student is so powerful. There is no justice in this world. Xia houming and the rest are so respectful to him. They must have seen his strength!”

“Him? In the future, we are going to call him captain. Although he is just a new student, his strength is much stronger than the instructors of our Demon Hunter College!”

The group of people followed behind and walked out of the school. They looked at Wang Xian’s back and discussed in a low voice.

The strong were King. Even if they were grade 10 students and the other party was grade 1, they still had to be respectful to him since his strength was high.

“Father!”

Behind them, Qian Hu looked at his father with an embarrassed expression and lowered his head slowly.

“Let’s Get Ready!”

Director Qian’s face darkened. “Strength doesn’t equal leadership. If he doesn’t have the ability to lead, he still doesn’t have the qualifications to be the team leader!”

When Qian Hu heard his father’s words, he fell into deep thought.

“Eh? Who is that? Isn’t that Wang Xian?”

“It’s really, it’s really that new student Wang Xian. He... why is he in front of a group of grade 10 students?”

“What’s going on? A group of senior students are following behind him respectfully. What’s going on?”

Walking in the Demon Hunter College, some of the junior students saw a group of senior students who were about to graduate from grade 10 following behind Wang Xian respectfully.

There were also a few influential figures in the college who surrounded them with smiles on their faces. Everyone was stunned.

What... What was going on?

When did a new student become so powerful?

“Captain, let’s go home and get ready. See You Later!”

Xia houming and the rest waved at Wang Xian and went back to get ready.

Wang Xian nodded and went to his residence. He called AO Jianxie and the rest. After packing up everything, he walked straight to the east gate.

“Did you guys accept the mission of the Holy Sea Town? Even the lowest one is a gold mission. Haha, This Is So Awesome!”

“The rewards are rich, and the danger level will be higher as well. Xilai town has been destroyed. Even the East Sea city has to send out troops to protect the holy sea town. One can imagine how dangerous the demonic beasts and ferocious beasts will be this time!”

“That’s true. Although the level of the mission is high and the rewards are high, there aren’t many people who take the risk. After all, the demonic beasts and ferocious beasts are wreaking havoc. After destroying a town, there must be an extraordinary level nine demonic beast!”

As he walked on the road, Wang Xian heard the discussions of the mercenary groups around him.

“They actually issued a mission in Donghai City. It seems that the demonic beasts wreaking havoc this time is not as simple as I thought!”

Wang Xian focused his attention slightly and soon arrived at the east gate.

When he walked out of the city gate, he immediately saw about five thousand people lined up neatly outside the city.

Each of them held a long spear in their hands. The long spears were red, blue, green, and khaki.

Beside them, ferocious beasts covered in scales were standing by the side.

The ferocious beasts were two meters tall and looked like flatterers. On their heads was a green horn that was half a meter long. Their eyes were blue and they looked extremely handsome.

“This is the riding wind battle team of the ocean cultivators’army. They are a unified team of wind wildebeest of transcendent level four and five. The soldiers of the army are all no weaker than those of transcendent level four!”

Wang Xian looked at the army with a glint in his eyes.
