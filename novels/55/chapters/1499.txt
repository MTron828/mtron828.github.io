Chapter 1500: A dragon among 1,500 people?

The golden law-enforcing decree was in He Feng’s hands!

The law-enforcing pavilion was the only law-enforcing department of the He clan. It was able to understand any movement in the He clan’s forest.

The law-enforcing pavilion held a very important position in the He clan. Just like he feng, even if he wanted to do something in secret, he had to inform the law-enforcing pavilion.

Unless the clan leader and the clan elders spoke, no one could stop or refuse the law-enforcing pavilion’s law-enforcing decree.

He Yuan looked at the law enforcement order and his face turned gloomy. He took a deep breath.

“Punish Me? Hehe, I would like to see how you will punish me!”

Wang Xian patted he Yuan’s shoulder and looked at He Feng with a smile. He spoke coldly with a calm expression.

“Brother Wang Xian, you...”

He Yuan looked at Wang Xian and frowned.

If he feng really had a conflict with Wang Xian, regardless of the outcome, it was not what he wanted to see.

If he feng was at a disadvantage, he would definitely seek revenge. Of course, he feng would not be at a disadvantage either.

With his current strength and the existence of a dragon among men, there were less than ten people in the vast region who could match up to him.

“Haha, Arrogant. I have to say, you are really arrogant. I would like to see what qualifications a guy from that tiny place in the Liuhai region has to be arrogant!”

He Feng laughed out loud and the aura from his body was slowly released.

“Brother Wang Xian!”

He Yuan felt the terrifying aura from he feng and his expression changed slightly. He hurriedly pulled Wang Xian’s body.

“It’s alright. I would like to see what kind of strength this so-called dragon among men has!”

Wang Xian gave he yuan a relieved look and walked forward slowly.

“For he Yuan’s sake, as long as you can withstand my ten attacks, I will spare you. If you can’t withstand ten attacks, I will cripple both of your arms!”

He feng stared at Wang Xian with a proud expression and said in a sinister tone.

In his heart, he could kill Wang Xian in one move, let alone ten moves.

When the crowd saw that Wang Xian dared to challenge he feng, they were stunned.

“A guy from the Liuhai region dares to challenge Big Brother He Feng!”

“This is the first time I’ve seen such an arrogant guy. He’s just a small fry!”

“Hehe, he Feng, who came from a small place, wants to challenge a dragon among men. He’s simply courting death!”

“Should we retreat?”

“Why should we retreat? Young Master He Feng will kill him in an instant later. Why should we retreat?”

Around them, the He clan’s disciples and some young men whispered among themselves.

Especially when they found out that Wang Xian came from the flowing sea region, their eyes were filled with disdain.

A fellow who looked at the sky from a well.

“He yuan, what... What should we do?”

At the side, he suiqing frowned and whispered to he yuan.

“There’s nothing I can do. He Feng’s strength has broken through and he has become a dragon among men. Today, he will not let this matter rest!”

He Yuan clenched his fists and felt a little powerless. At this moment, he was no match for he feng.

He could only wait for Wang Xian’s injuries to be healed.

“A piece of trash. I’ll give you a chance to make the first move!”

He feng stared at Wang Xian and said with disdain.

If it wasn’t for he yuan, he would have killed this guy instantly!

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian looked at He Feng who was looking down at him arrogantly. A hint of disdain appeared in his eyes. He waved his arm and two gray palms attacked he feng directly.

“I gave you a chance but you didn’t cherish it!”

When he feng saw Wang Xian’s casual attack, his eyes turned colder. He moved the staff in his hand slightly.

He waved his arm gently as well. Numerous thorns attacked Wang Xian.

“Bang! Bang!”

However, when the thorns collided with the two palms, the thorns were destroyed as if they had never appeared.

“Huh?”

He Feng was slightly stunned. He was clearly a little stunned.

Looking at the palm that had already arrived in front of him, his face sank. “HMPH, you still have some ability.”

As he spoke, he waved his scepter. Numerous thorns seemed to come from the void as they twined around his palm.

“Pu Pu Pu!”

However, the moment the thorns touched his palm, they were also destroyed. His palm charged forward once again.

“What?”

This time, he Feng’s pupils constricted slightly, and a hint of shock appeared on his face.

The staff in his hand made a final attempt to block the attack.

“Pa!”

A crisp sound rang out as his palm smashed the staff into pieces, landing directly on he Feng’s arms.

“Ah!”

A painful scream came directly from He Feng’s mouth, accompanied by streams of blood flowing out.

His body flew backward.

The whole process took less than a second.

He Yuan, who had already taken out the pills to treat Wang Xian, turned stiff.

Everyone around looked ahead in a daze.

It seemed that the plot was completely opposite to what they had imagined.

“How... How is this possible?”

A He clan disciple couldn’t help but exclaim in shock and growled in disbelief.

Shouldn’t the one screaming and flying backwards be that young man?

How could it be He Feng?

With one move, he feng was sent flying backwards while screaming in agony?

Wasn’t he a dragon among men?

“Dragon among men?”

Wang Xian revealed a mocking expression on his face as he smiled faintly.

“Ah, my arm. You actually crippled my arm. I’m going to kill you!”

He Feng, whose body was trembling on the ground, revealed a ferocious expression as he growled loudly.

His voice spread across a few kilometers.

He staggered to his feet ferociously as he stared at Wang Xian with blood-red eyes.

“Kill me?”

Upon hearing his words, Wang Xian turned cold as well. He waved his arm.

A greyish energy attacked him once again.

“You...”

Seeing that Wang Xian was attacking him again, he Feng’s eyes revealed a look of fear. He gritted his teeth as his body emitted a bright light.

“Bang!”

“Ah!”

However, the terrifying force caused his body to fly backward again. He widened his eyes and spat out blood.

“I’ll spare your life for the sake of He Yuan and the He clan!”

Wang Xian looked at him and said faintly.

When everyone around heard Wang Xian’s words, they looked at him stiffly. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“HMM? What Happened?”

“A scream came from he Yuan’s birthday. Oh No, let’s hurry over!”

“Eh, Feng ‘Er’s voice!”

Around the He clan, the rest of the He clan were slightly shocked when they heard the scream around the holy tree.

At the position of the Enforcement Pavilion, the three pavilion masters were slightly stunned. The Scream came from the He clan. They didn’t have time to hesitate and flew over immediately.

In a room in the holy tree, the He clan leader was drinking tea with a graceful and elegant woman. When they heard the voice, their expressions changed.

“It’s Feng ‘Er!”

The woman immediately stood up.

The He clan leader’s expression also changed slightly, as if he had thought of something.

“Let’s Go!”

His figure moved, and his figure immediately disappeared, flying towards he Yuan’s birthday!
