Chapter 867: 0868, the final battle

Translator: 549690339

When all the immortal gods and disciples of the immortal sects saw Wang Xian leading a group of experts from the Dragon Palace, they sucked in a breath of cold air.

“Thinking back to a year ago, when the Dragon King wiped out the Northern European divine territory and the Yuwen clan, he didn’t take action personally. However, when he met this ancient god, he had to submit to the Twelve Sacred Kings!”

“Even someone as powerful as the Dragon King had to submit to him, let alone us?”

“The twelve Holy Kings wanted the Dragon King to be their mount. Mount! Let the strongest among us be their mount!”

When everyone saw the arrival of the Dragon King, a look of shock appeared on their faces.

“Dragon King!”

“Dragon King!”

When they saw Wang Xian and the rest arrive, everyone at the front opened up a space and shouted with a hint of misery on their faces.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly and landed on the ground. He looked towards the west.

“HMPH, you’re going to be someone else’s mount in the future, yet you’re still so cold and arrogant!”

Behind them, a new immortal from the Hunyuan Immortal sect curled his lips slightly when he saw Wang Xian’s cold and arrogant look. He said with disdain on his face.

The Hunyuan Immortal sect had a grudge with the Dragon Palace. Back then, the experts from the dragon sect blocked their city gates, causing them to not dare to leave the city for three days.

However, the Dragon King was too powerful, so they dared not speak out in anger. Now that they saw the Dragon King become someone else’s mount, he muttered in a low voice, full of schadenfreude!

His voice was very soft, but the surrounding immortals and deities could not hide it from anyone’s ears.

“Buzz!”

Just as he finished speaking, Prime Minister Turtle, who was standing at the side, turned around and waved the turtle shell in his hand.

“The twelve sacred kings will be here soon. Dragon King, you...”

The Immortal God’s expression changed drastically. However, before he could finish speaking, a terrifying suction force came from the turtle shell!

“Bang!”

The Immortal God didn’t have the slightest strength to resist. He was directly sucked into the turtle shell and his head was separated.

“Bang!”

Prime Minister Gui casually threw the immortal God’s body into the ocean.

Everyone was shocked when they saw this.

“He is really courting death!”

“Exactly. Even if the Dragon King is reduced to a mount, you are not qualified to mock him!”

“How can such a fool advance to the immortal God Level?”

Some people whispered. The Dragon King must be in a bad mood now. He was simply courting death by ridiculing him now!

“Haha, You Really Know What’s good for you. Immortals of the east, your king is Here!”

At this moment, a loud roar was heard.

Everyone’s expression changed slightly as they hurriedly looked towards the west.

In the western sky, there were twelve middle-aged youths sitting on the divine seats, with twelve terrifying giant beasts pulling at them.

At the back, a group of western gods followed behind, their eyes filled with respect. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

An old man stood at the leftmost position. He was the one who had spoken just now.

The old man was dressed in divine armor and had an extraordinary aura. He was the leader of a god domain, yet he was now accompanying them like a eunuch.

Your King Is Here!

The group of people moved very quickly. A few hundred immortal gods followed behind. This aura was soul-shaking.

“Transcendence level two, level three, level two, level two, level three, level four, level three...”

Wang Xian swept his gaze over and a smile slowly appeared on his face.

There was only one person who was at the strongest transcendence level four. The rest were at the weakest transcendence level two.

“Hiss, these saint kings look so young!”

“Although they didn’t emit any aura, looking at them, there is a kind of pressure that comes from the soul!”

Everyone looked over with shocked expressions.

“Roar!”

The twelve ten-meter-long beasts stopped and roared.

The twelve sacred kings lined up and looked at them.

Their eyes were filled with mockery and pride.

They were just a small mercenary group on the extraordinary continent, but they didn’t expect to be the strongest existences in this world.

This made all of them look excited. They decided not to go back and do something big here.

Build an empire and become a King!

They were the masters of this place. They wanted women and the most beautiful women. They wanted power. They were the kings of everyone!

In this place, they were the heavens!

The eyes of the twelve people swept across the hundreds of thousands of people below. They looked satisfied.

“TSK tsk, there are quite a number of beautiful women!”

A lewd expression flashed across the eyes of a youth sitting on the left divine seat. He stood up excitedly and looked down.

The rest of the people were also used to his behavior.

“Have all the immortal sects arrived?”

At this moment, a shady youth sitting in the middle asked a question.

“Reporting to the sage king, all the experts from the celestial sect have arrived!”

An immortal replied hurriedly.

“Which one is the Dragon King?”

The shady-looking young man raised his head slightly and asked with disdain.

At the bottom of the hall, everyone’s gaze landed on Wang Xian and the rest who were at the front.

“Oh? You are the Dragon King?”

A hint of surprise flashed across the shady-looking young man’s eyes. His gaze landed on Wang Xian as well.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly.

“Eh, these beauties are pretty!”

When the young man with lewd eyes on the left saw Lan Qingyue, Sun Lingxiu, and teacher fan Zhang who were beside Wang Xian, his eyes lit up.

The three of them were definitely the best in terms of temperament and looks.

Even in the transcendence continent, they were considered to be peerless beauties.

Empress Feng Luan’s appearance was only slightly better than the few of them.

The corners of the young man’s mouth curled up slightly as he licked his lips.

Everyone below saw this scene and their expressions changed slightly.

“This Dragon King doesn’t just want to become a mount, he might even toy with his own woman!”

Some people thought to themselves.

The Glorious Dragon King had fallen to this scene, which was something no one had expected.

“Transform into a divine dragon and let the Holy Kings see it. Also, everyone else, kneel down and worship!”

The old man on the left shouted loudly with a cold gaze.

Everyone’s expression changed slightly. However, their expressions soon relaxed as they slowly knelt on the ground.

“Huh?”

Suddenly, the old man snorted softly. His gaze was fixed on Wang Xian and the rest who were at the front.

The twelve Saint Kings also looked at Wang Xian and the rest with a hint of coldness in their eyes.

“Kneel down, didn’t you hear me? And you, Dragon King, anyone who dares to disobey the orders of the saint kings will be implicated!”

The old man exuded a terrifying pressure and surged toward the area below.

“Keke, how dare you resist us. Interesting, kill all the men and the women...”

The young man with lewd eyes licked his lips once again.

“Whoosh!”

However, this time, before he could finish his sentence, the space trembled slightly.

A white light flashed and a head flew into the sky.

“A bunch of guys with the highest cultivation level at the fourth level of transcendence. They still dare to claim that they are ancient gods and sacred kings to establish an empire. Haha, How Interesting!”

At the same time, a faint smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face as his mocking voice rang out.
