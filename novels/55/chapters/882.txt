Chapter 883: 0884 kill

Translator: 549690339

Coming to the supernatural world gave him a depressing feeling.

He, who was invincible on Earth, came here. He was careful in every aspect.

Yesterday, the girl attacked them directly with her longsword. She was full of killing intent. Wang Xian had the ability to kill her, but he could only endure it.

In the demon-hunting mercenary group, he even had to be careful when naming the Dragon King mercenary group.

This gave him a depressing feeling.

There was actually someone who wanted to kill him now.

Wang Xian looked ahead with a cold look in his eyes.

“Hehe!”

When ao Xue heard Wang Xian’s words, she snorted coldly. “Just wait and see!”

Wang Xian didn’t say anything. He followed behind and flew toward the beach.

“The Demon Hunter Academy’s assessment has begun!”

“I didn’t expect that the assessment this year would be about going to the mermaid island to hunt the big-mouthed piranhas. Moreover, we have to kill five of them. This is not an easy task. It’s equivalent to a five-star bronze mission!”

“Among the candidates for this assessment, bei Ming, Qing Feng, Ao Xue, Qi Lian, Hua Fengzi and the rest of the famous geniuses in Shenghai town should be able to pass!”

“A few geniuses should be able to enter the Demon Hunter College successfully!”

Below, the people of Holy Sea Town were discussing in low voices.

The Demon Hunters Academy was not so easy to enter. Moreover, it had an extremely high death rate. Those who could enter it were either geniuses without backgrounds or wanted to become a member of a powerful mercenary group.

Some powerful mercenary groups were comparable to some big families and sects.

When they came to the seaside, there was a huge ship docked there.

The ship’s body was dark, like a giant beast in the sea, emitting an unpleasant smell.

This was a beast ship. The smell on it would make most aquatic creatures dislike it, so they would not approach it.

Mermaid Island was not very far from holy sea town. Fifty kilometers away was in the shallow sea area, where there were many islands.

The area of the islands was about a hundred kilometers, and it was very large.

This island was very strange. There were more than ten mountains supporting it underwater. There would be seawater in some places on the island, and if one jumped down, they would be at the bottom of the sea.

There was a group of fish living around here, the big-mouthed piranhas.

The piranhas were two to three meters in size. Their heads took up four-fifths of their bodies, and they had terrifying teeth. With a single bite, they could even leave marks on transcendent weapons.

They had a hard head, and their bodies were completely covered in fish scales. The weakest piranha with a big mouth was an existence at the first level of transcendence.

The jade glue of the piranha with a big mouth was the most precious item on its body. The item for this mission was this jade glue.

A thousand examinees came to the ship, and some people who knew each other quickly got to know each other, preparing to work together.

Some formed teams while a few chose to fight alone.

Soon, teams formed on the ship.

The largest team consisted of twenty people. The leader was a young man who stood proudly in the middle.

“When we arrive at Mermaid Island, we will kill them!”

Ao Xue leaned against the railing of the ship. She glanced at Wang Xian and said nonchalantly.

It was as though getting rid of Wang Xian and the rest was a trivial matter.

“It’s not that troublesome. We should try our best to kill more piranhas in the next two days!”

Bei Ming, who was beside him, had a head of short hair. He wiped his long sword as he looked to the side and waved his hand!

“Brother Ming, what are your orders?”

Not far from the side, more than ten young men gathered together. A burly young man immediately walked over with a smile on his face.

“Do you see that group of people? I don’t want to see them anymore!”

Bei Ming lightly said with a face full of smiles.

“Are they the ones who recklessly provoked miss ao Xue? Don’t worry, brother Ming, leave it to us!”

The burly youth slightly narrowed his eyes and coldly said.

“En!”

Bei Ming lightly nodded his head.

“The opponents this time, one is Qingfeng’s group, the other is Qi Lian’s group, and Super Star Golden Crack’s group. The rest of the groups are much weaker!”

On the ship, a girl twirled the ring in her hand and said calmly, her face was full of smiles. “However, in this assessment, I want to get first place. First, I have to set a small goal and get twenty pieces of jade glue. Hehe!”

“This time, I must get it. Only trash will only think about completing the mission. First is what I Want!”

“I want to enter the Demon Hunter College with the first place. This way, I can create my own powerful mercenary group!”

On the ship, some young men murmured, their eyes full of fighting spirit.

Above the ship, five middle-aged men glanced at everyone below with smiles on their faces.

“This year, the strength of holy sea town is not bad!”

“Not bad. Compared to the students of East Sea city, it’s still much worse!”

The two middle-aged men said with a smile.

The ship was moving very fast. Twenty minutes later, a huge island appeared in their line of sight.

“The Mermaid Island is ahead. Everyone fly over. After completing the mission, you can come to the ship. Two days later, at this moment, we will leave on time. Those who don’t come will be considered dead and eliminated!”

The middle-aged man shouted, “Now, everyone, set off!”

“Let’s Go!”

Everyone on the ship did not hesitate and immediately flew towards the Mermaid Island.

“Dragon King, should we act now or wait for a while!”

Long Yi glanced ahead and said with a cold gaze.

“There’s no rush. Ao Yao is already beside them!”

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly. After entering the Mermaid Island, death meant death. Even if he was killed by his companions, the instructors of the Demon Hunters Academy would not pursue anything.

Moreover, the Mermaid Island was a good place to level up.

“Huh?”

At this moment, Wang Xian sensed that someone was following them.

More than a thousand candidates flew toward the Mermaid Island. However, most of them had dispersed. If each team went to a single location, there would be a conflict.

Now, there was actually someone following them.

“Dragon King, these people have evil intentions and are filled with murderous intent!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

At this moment, the voice of the DRAKONIDS could be heard from the side.

“Attack directly and kill them!”

A hint of coldness flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The eyes of the group of drakonids were filled with killing intent.

Wang Xian and the rest increased their flying speed and landed directly on the island. Instantly, a strong fishy smell was emitted from the surroundings.

“Keke, surround them!”

At the back, the burly young man saw Wang Xian and the rest increasing their speed as they landed. A hint of coldness flashed across his eyes.

The corner of his mouth curled up slightly as he said to the dozen of people beside him, “How dare a little one-star bronze rookie provoke brother Ao Xueming and the rest!”

“Die!”

However, when the dozen of people beside him landed on the island, Wang Xian turned around immediately.

“Burn the river and boil the sea!”

“Kill!”

The group of DRAKONIDS followed closely behind!
