Chapter 66: Evolution: Five-Elements Divine Dragon (2)

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

The Five Elements Source Stone couldn’t be devoured as Wang Xian wasn’t able to absorb the energy within.

Carrying the Five Elements Source Stone, Wang Xian jumped into the water directly.

Rawrr!

A dragon roar propagated through the seas. Wang Xian sat on the seabed and scratched the Five Elements Source Stone with his dragon claws.

“Evolution: Five-Elements Divine Dragon!”

Wang Xian shouted softly. The Five Element Source Stone was emitting 5 different colored lights as it entered Wang Xian’s body gradually.

In that instant, his body glowed in 5 different colors and his body was no longer just gold in color.

“Evolution: Five-Elements Divine Dragon!”

A voice exploded in Wang Xian’s mind and his dragon’s body started cracking.

His body was growing at a rapid pace from three meters to five meters. Moreover, the color of its body was also undergoing major changes.

His head was blue, the color of the water. His pair of claws and dragon horns were golden in color. His body was a dull shade of yellow with a tinge of green.

As for his tail, it was red. His entire body reflected the colors of the Five Elements: Metal, water, wood, fire and ground.

Wang Xian felt that his dragon claws seemed to have been completely turned into metal and were capable of splitting metal and shattering stones. His head could control the flow of water and his body had a thick defense with strong regeneration capability.

As for his tail, it was filled with violent power.

There were five different types of colors connected to one another, complementing and restricting each element. [1]

Rawrr!

Wang Xian couldn’t help but let out a dragon’s roar which resounded in a radius of several dozens of miles. All the marine animals within this range were all looking towards his direction in horror.

Some of them were even trembling in fear while lying flat on the seabed as though they were paying respect to Wang Xian.

So strong! I’m so strong now! Wang Xian could feel the destructive strength that filled his body.

Looking across, he could see all the living animals in a radius of one kilometer and all the marine animals within several kilometers. With just a thought, he could control them.

Absolutely horrifying!

My level increased three times to Level Six and I got a new superpower!

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up as he felt his unprecedented strength.

With a body of 5 meters, he was considered rather large in the seas. Moreover with his current strength, he could easily kill any types of sharks. In fact, he could even kill a school of tiger whales.

Five Elements Control!

With a thought, he opened up his dragon claw and a sharp metal longsword appeared in his hand.

When he opened his mouth slightly, a ball of water appeared from within.

When he swayed his tail slightly, the scorching temperature that was emitting from the tail could reach the might of the dragon ball.

I’m so strong now. Even if I encounter an Inborn expert, he wouldn’t be a match for me!

Wang Xian was filled with confidence. From here onwards, he would also be an existence that could rule over an area.

“Dragon King!”

At this moment, clam girl, who had been around, swam over. She opened her shell and revealed her human form.

“Haha, I’m in a really good mood today. Here is some dragon energy for you!”

Wang Xian looked at clam girl and revealed a smile. With a wave of his golden claws, a stream of dragon energy entered clam girl’s body.

“Thank you, Dragon King!”

The clam girl shivered and absorbed the dragon energy rapidly. Her form was getting closer and closer to a human and the shell behind her was emitting a blinding glow. At the same time, her level had increased to Level Seven.

“Roving girl, did you catch any top-quality seafood over the last few days? “Wang Xian asked Roving Girl.

“Dragon King, I’ve found some abalones as you described near this island.” Moving her body, she controlled the water flow and pointed to a direction.

Oh? Abalone? Wang Xian revealed a shocked expression. “Bring me over to take a look.”

“Yes, Dragon King!” Roving Girl nodded her head. As she moved her body, she went ahead and led the way.

Wang Xian moved his tail slightly. His current speed was horrifying in the seas currently and few marine animals could match his speed.

A five meters long Five Elements divine dragon was starting to have its majestic look.

Under the island was a patch of chaotic rocks. Clam girl led him towards the opposite direction where Wang Xian came from.

In that direction, green seaweeds were all over the surface of the rocks.

“Dragon King, look! The abalones that you’ve described!”

Clam girl pointed to an abalone in the cracks between a rock. She controlled the flow of water and swept the abalone towards her directly.

“This is... Two-headed abalone!”

When Wang Xian saw the abalones in front of him, his eyes lit up and revealed a shocked expression.

An abalone is considered a “Two-headed abalone” when just two of them weighs a catty.

Two-headed abalone was a very rare and precious animal. A single two-headed abalone would fetch at least $400,000 – $500,000.

Even so, one might not even get one with money. This was something that an ordinary rich person could eat.

Wang Xian looked to clam girl with joy and asked, “Are there more of these abalone?”

“Yes.” Clam girl nodded her head and swam to the side. Controlling the water flow, she swept an even larger abalone over.

“This...”

Wang Xian was speechless when he saw this abalone. It was at least the size of two palms, had a heavy and thick shell and dull-yellow flesh.

“One-headed Abalone. Oh my gosh, this is a one-headed abalone that is worth several million for one!”

Wang Xian was exhilarated. He opened up his claws and held it with his own hand.

Abalone! This was the highest-quality ingredient available!

Just this abalone alone would be more than $2 million. Moreover, it would at most be enough for two people.

$2 million for a meal? Who could have afforded it?

“Roving girl, get me all the abalone in the surrounding area,” Wang Xian ordered loudly.

Roving girl nodded her head. Moving her body, she started to catch the abalones within the cracks of the rocks.

Soon, 20-30 abalones appeared within the area she was controlling.

Among which, there were several one-headed abalones and two-headed abalones that were similar to those in Wang Xian’s hand.

There was 1 one-headed abalone and 4 two-headed abalone. As for the rest, they were either three-headed abalones or four-headed abalones.

“Dragon King, this is a portion of the abalones.”

In less than 10 minutes, abalones were densely packed around Roving Girl. There were approximately 100 of them.

“Great, that’s enough!”

Wang Xian was overwhelmed. Among the abalones in front of him, there were approximately 5 one-headed abalones, 15 two-headed abalones and the rest were three-headed abalones or four-headed abalones.

“If I place these in the restaurants, it would definitely cause a commotion. These are one-headed abalones and two-headed abalones that are close to impossible to find within the country!”

Wang Xian recalled a piece of news that he had seen. Someone dried a two-headed abalone and preserved it under perfect conditions. After which, he used it as a family heirloom. From this, one could see the value of a two-headed abalone, let alone a one-headed abalone.

Lobsters and abalones... If I could get some Chinese Bahaba fish and Atlantic Bluefin Marlin, it would be perfect. At that time, no restaurants would be able to match the top-quality ingredients of First-grade restaurant!
