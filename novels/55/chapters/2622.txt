2623 2,623 might of the Dragon Peak

“We have entered the attack range!”

“All the disciples of the Dragon Palace, prepare to kill!”

On the commanding platform at the top of the Dragon Peak, Wang Xian immediately gave an order when he saw the abyssal seeds entering the range!

Buzz

In the next moment, numerous strange demons flew out from the Dragon Peak and hid in the void!

“All the members of the Heavenly Eye Arrow Division, prepare to shoot!”

Mu Zesen stood on the highest arrow platform and shouted softly!

“Prepare!”

“Buzz Buzz Buzz!”

More than 30,000 members of the Heavenly Eye Arrow Division shot out terrifying rays of light from their eyes. Their eyes were locked onto the abyssal seed in front of them!

“Dragon King, we can make the abyss charge straight over. With the defense of the Dragon Peak, the level eight abyssal seed of the Immortal King will not be able to break through!”

At the side, Heaven Array said with a smile on his face!

“Dragon Peak, you control it. You will be in charge of the next battle!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and said to Heaven Array!

“It’s Dragon King!”

Heaven array nodded his head. With a wave of his arm, an illusory screen appeared in front of him!

On the screen, there were countless red dots. Each red dot was different in size!

This was the detection formation set up by Heaven Array!

This array could detect all living beings within a 10 billion km radius, the stronger the Red Dot, the brighter it was, and amongst them, there were even a few black dots!

And the black dots were the existences that Dragon Mountain could defend against!

They were undying level 8 and above Abyss species!

In the screen, there were 8 black dots, all very far away from them!

The moment they were close, Dragon Mountain could swiftly leave!

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

Tian Chen controlled Dragon Peak’s arm to move, and the huge dragon peak directly flew towards the center of the abyssal seed!

“Friends of the Beichuan sect ahead, please make way!”

Tian Chen looked towards the Beichuan sect experts who were fighting against the abyssal seed ahead and directly said!

“En? They are going to charge into the center of the abyssal seed!”

“Are they that confident? That Dragon Mountain can withstand the attacks of the abyss seeds?”

“I heard that there are many undying level 7 warriors in the Dragon Palace, let’s ignore them and make a path!”

With someone sharing the pressure, the Beichuan clan warriors were naturally happy!

Opening a path, Dragon Mountain flew straight in!

“Howl Howl Howl!”

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Ga Ga Ga!”

In front of them, millions of abyssal seeds were floating in the void. When they saw dragon peak flying towards them and felt the pressure within, they let out roars!

“Roar!”

In the next moment, tens of thousands of abyssal seeds of various levels rushed towards Dragon Peak!

There were also some abyssal seeds that raised their heads and spat out substantial law attacks!

“Fire!”

Without needing the sky array to give the order, Mu Ze Sen stared at all the attacking Abyss species and roared!

“Sou Sou Sou!”

The next moment, over 30,000 arrows with terrifying power shot towards all the abyss species!

Sky Eye Arrow Division had 3 members that had reached undying level 7!

The strongest in this region was only undying level 7, and there were only 2 of them!

Facing the attacks from the Sky Eye Arrows, every arrow became a fatal arrow!

“Howl!”

“Pu Pu Pu!”

Screams rang out, in an instant, over 20,000 abyss species were killed by the arrows!

There was even one undying level 7 abyss species that was heavily injured!

“It’s Time!”

A black and white shadow appeared behind the heavily injured Abyss species, instantly piercing through his body! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Sou Sou Sou!”

...

Within Dragon Mountain, a group of Starwood dragon seed branches instantly swept towards the corpses!

“Kill the other undying level 7 abyss seed!”

Mou Ze Sen said to his two underlings beside him!

“It’s the leader!”

The three of them fully loaded their bows and arrows, pointing at the Undying Level 7 abyss seed!

“Howl Howl Howl!”

The abyss seed instantly felt the threat of death, its eyes filled with Panic!

“Sky Net!”

“Earth Net!”

“Stab!”

Mu Ze Sen and the other 3 Arrow Dragons roared, the 3 arrows shot towards the abyss seed!

...

Sky Net covered the sky!

Earth net covered the ground below!

This was a trap arrow!

The 2 arrows made it impossible to escape!

Stab was a killing move, aimed straight at the Undying Level 7 abyss seed!

“Howl Howl Howl!”

The undying level 7 seed let out an enraged howl, black mist rose from its body, within the black mist, solid particles appeared, forming a line of defense around it!

“Rumble Rumble Rumble!”

Three Arrows landed on its body, causing its body to fly backwards!

“Pu!”

A black and white shadow flashed, the Undying Level 7 seed was swiftly killed!

“Dealing with the other abyssal seeds!”

Standing on the Arrow platform, Mou Ze Sen saw the second undying level 7 seed being killed and said!

“Sou Sou Sou!”

In the next moment, countless arrows shot towards the surrounding abyssal seeds!

The terrifying arrows pierced through space and instantly landed on the abyssal seeds!

“Howl Howl Howl Howl!”

In an instant, screams of terror rang out continuously, the abyssal seeds all revealed terrified expressions!

“Howl Howl Howl!”

Some undying emperor level abyssal seeds immediately fled towards the depths of the Abyss!

However their speed wasn’t as fast as the arrows!

The abyssal seeds were swiftly killed one by one!

“So Strong, this dragon palace’s strength is very strong!”

“Are those the archers from the Dragon Palace? So Powerful, two undying level 7 abyss seeds were actually killed so quickly!”

“Too powerful this archer, what terrifying archery!”

In the surrounding area, the Bei Chuan Clan saw a group of abyss seeds being swiftly harvested, their faces filled with shock!

“The Dragon Palace didn’t just send out three undying level 7 warriors, there should be another one in the dark, their strength isn’t weak!”

The bei Chuan Clan Elder looked over, his pupils dilating as he said softly!

“Those 3 undying Level 7 archers are the strongest amongst them, if they lock onto me, unless I get close to them, I can only flee!”

Another elder looked at the group of archers, his eyes flashing!

“This dragon palace seems to have 10 to 20 undying level 7 warriors, if they attack, we’ll have less pressure!”

The bei Chuan Sect Elder said, looking at the huge Dragon Mountain ahead!

“Keep the corpse of the abyss seed, continue forward and push horizontally!”

The sky array looked at the red dots on the array, immediately controlling the dragon mountain to push horizontally!

Not towards the depths of the abyss, but to the side, the battle line of the abyss seed, pushing horizontally!

On the human side, the north side was represented by a few thousand planets, and the abyss species were similarly invading!

Around every planet, there were 4 to 5 million abyss species!

Amongst them, there were even undying level 8 and 9 abyss species, there were even Pinnacle God kings, none of them had been detected yet!
