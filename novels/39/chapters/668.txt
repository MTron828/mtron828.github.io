Chapter 669 - Sun Tai

A middle-aged man wearing red robes on the second floor of the auction hall held a jade box in his hand. He opened it, revealing a pill the size of a baby’s fist.

It didn’t give off any medicinal fragrance; the pill looked very normal.

Waves of discussion echoed in the hall. Every cultivator here naturally had good eyesight. A rank 8 pill was an absolutely rare treasure for them. However, if one’s cultivation level wasn’t high enough, this pill would be like poison.

If it couldn’t be consumed, then keeping it on them would be a curse. Any cultivator who didn’t have the ability to protect it would encounter a great disaster the moment they left the city.

As a result, although the hall was filled with discussion, in the end, no one bidded.

Some young cultivators wanted to bid, but they were immediately stopped by the elders near them. In their eyes, this object was not a pill but a human head!

Whoever buys this pill will lose possession of their head.

Moreover, this matter was simply too strange. How could the Ran family sell a pill like this? Could the Ran family’s ancestor not need this pill? Why would he auction it? Some with more active minds began to become filled with uncertainty, and they became even less willing to bid.

Time slowly passed and still no one bidded at all. The man in red wasn’t impatient at all as he wasn’t surprised. The Ran family carefully sent out the tokens for the people to participate at this auction. They were confident that none of them would bid for this pill.

If anyone was so blind, then the Ran family wouldn’t mind killing them to steal it back.

The man’s gaze sometimes swept by the fourth floor before he loudly said, “Is anyone willing to bid? If no one is willing to bid, the rank 8 pill will be stored in our Whole Treasure Pavilion.”

Wang Lin’s gaze lingered on the pill for a long time. His eyes revealed a hint of coldness and then he calmly said, “One celestial jade!”

“If you want to sell it to me, then I’ll buy it!” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Although his voice was calm, it was clearly heard by every cultivator on the second floor. After a instant, there were bursts of discussions.

“One piece of celestial jade? Who is this? Could he be crazy!?”

“The starting price was ten thousand celestial jades, yet this person actually said one piece. This is ridiculous; even for the Whole Treasure Pavilion, something like this has never happened before.”

“The Ran family stands behind the Whole Treasure Pavilion. This kind of behavior will indeed attract a great disaster. This is clearly trying to embarrass the Whole Treasure Pavilion.”

“The sound should be from the fourth floor. Anyone who is on the fourth floor is not simple, but doing this is offending the Ran family.”

The man wearing red was startled, and he raised his head toward the fourth floor. He was not from this city but someone from the main Ran family. His purpose was to sell the pill to a specific person.

He wryly smiled in his heart as the person he was waiting for appeared and made a bid. However, the price was not acceptable. If this price was accepted, it would be tantamount to telling everyone that there was some big secret behind this sale.

The Ran family’s reputation would take a hit, and more importantly, if it was sold to this person, it would tell everyone that the Ran family was afraid.

Absolutely no one would believe that a rank 8 pill would sell for one celestial jade. However, if it really did happen, it would create a series of unimaginable troubles.

However, he had to sell it. The old ancestor had already ordered that this pill must be auctioned off here!

Inside the room in the fourth floor, Sun Xi, who had the tea cup next to his mouth, was startled. His eyes filled with a strange expression, then he put down the cup and sighed. “Brother Xu… I admire you! I admire you!”

Sun Qiming was also very serious and was speechless for a while.

“A single piece of celestial jade to purchase a rank 8 pill…”

Not only them, but even the youth named Lou had his eyes opened wide and was incredibly shocked. That voice was very familiar; it was the youth he had stopped outside several days ago.

At the moment he heard Wang Lin bid one celestial jade, the youth named Lou muttered to himself, “This person has gone crazy!”

At this moment, no one noticed that in the single room on the third floor, an old man’s mind shook violently after hearing that voice!

He suddenly raised his head to look at the fourth floor, and his eyes revealed a strange light.

“This… This isn’t his voice, but why did my mind tremble… In this old man’s life, only that Chen Niu has left a brand in my soul.” The old man was silent for a long time. He stood up, and after hesitating, he sat down. Then he began to stare blankly at the ground.

“My brand should have been broken on planet Dong Lin, so why… is it still there…”

The red-robed man on the second floor hesitated for a while before clenching his teeth. “Since only one person has bid, then it will be sold for one celestial jade!”

Wang Lin revealed a sneer and his right hand reached out. The pill flew out of the red-robed man’s hand and into Wang Lin’s hand, then he threw out a piece of celestial jade. Then he clasped his hands at Sun Xi and left.

Wang Lin completely ignored the uproar behind him. With one step, he teleported outside the Whole Treasure Pavilion.

“Just one pill isn’t enough to drag me into this!” Wang Lin walked away from the pavilion.

On the third floor, the old man clenched his teeth and disappeared.

After Wang Lin arrived at a remote place, he turned around. The old man from the Whole Treasure Pavilion appeared behind him. He carefully looked at Wang Lin and revealed a look of doubt.

Noticing Wang Lin’s gaze, the old man sighed and said, “Fellow Cultivator, this old man mistook you for someone else. I hope you won’t take offense.” He turned around and walked off into the distance. This figure was filled with vicissitudes.

Wang Lin pondered a bit and slowly said, “Sun Tai[1. The head elder of the corpse sect on planet Suzaku. He was the one Zhou Yi left an imprint on to be a slave to Wang Lin. He was teleported away by the Giant Demon Clan ancestor’s bloodline power when he came to save Wang Lin. But he was also the one who placed seal on Wang Lin’s cultivation at the time as well]!”

The moment those two words entered the old man’s ears, his entire body shook. He jerked his head, looked at Wang Lin with shock, and exclaimed, “You… It really is you!”

Wang Lin scanned Sun Tai with his divine sense before frowning and saying, “How could the Giant Demon Clan Ancestor’s bloodline ability have sent you to the Allheaven Star System?”

Sun Tai revealed a bitter expression and said, “I was also puzzled about this for hundreds of years. To my understanding, the bloodline ability shouldn’t be this strong.”

Wang Lin asked, “The brand on your body is very weak. Why?”

Sun Tai pondered a bit and said, “Do you know about planet Dong Lin in the Allheaven Star System?”

Wang Lin’s eyes narrowed, and he didn’t let Sun Tai continue speaking. He waved his sleeves and the two of them disappeared. They reappeared outside his house in the northern part of the city. Wang Lin led Sun Tai into the house.

After sitting down in the lotus position, Wang Lin looked at Sun Tai and said, “You can speak now!”
