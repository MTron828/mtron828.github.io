Chapter 1894 - A Passage of Time

The moment the old man in green and the two Green Devil Messengers left, Wang Lin‚Äôs body remained motionless in the green space. Countless specks of green light flashed constantly.

Every strand of light had the shadow of a green scorpion, and they filled up this green space.

Time slowly passed. In a flash, three months went by. During these three months, Wang Lin sat still. There was no movement or vitality at all coming from him. His body was covered in green light, and if you looked closely, you would see countless green scorpions spreading across his body.

During this three month period, Wang Lin‚Äôs origin soul had slowly waited while being protected by the Heaven Defying Bead. He had enough patience for what he felt was a great fortune.

The green-robed old man was extremely suspicious. Wang Lin didn‚Äôt believe the old man would easily believe that he was already gone. What awaited Wang Lin was likely several more tests until the old man felt certain enough to give Wang Lin the great fortune.

Although Wang Lin couldn‚Äôt guess what kinds of tests he would have to overcome in the future, he was prepared. He calmly waited under the protection of the Heaven Defying Bead.

To not change and a form of change, this was Wang Lin‚Äôs plan. He allowed the green scorpions to cover his body. Some had even entered his mouth and nose, but he did nothing.

Time unknowingly began to pass once more. Three months, three months, three months‚Ä¶ Soon, Wang Lin spent one year inside the green space after the old man in green left.

After reaching his current cultivation level, his body wouldn‚Äôt decay for tens of thousands of years. His body didn‚Äôt change during this year, but even more green scorpions had covered his body.

Inside this green space, the scorpions already considered Wang Lin as part of them. This place was like a dungeon, and it gave off a gloomy aura.

At this moment, if anyone else saw the scene inside the screen space, they would be shocked.

Wang Lin no longer existed. The only thing that remained was a human-shaped mound.

Wang Lin‚Äôs origin soul remained as calm as an ancient well and didn‚Äôt reveal any fluctuations inside the Heaven Defying Bead.

During this year of time, the green-robed old man didn‚Äôt appear again, as if he had forgotten Wang Lin. There was not a trace of anyone in the scorpion building.

A strange aura was born in this silence.

One year, two years, three years‚Ä¶

On this day, the fourth year slowly arrived. In the green space inside the scorpion building, Wang Lin‚Äôs origin soul struggled. He had waited here for four years!!

During these four years, the green-robed old man didn‚Äôt appear at all. His body underwent a strange change due to the green scorpions that were covering his body. This change was the root of his struggle!

Egg-like green lights appeared in his 108,000 pores. These lights had appeared two years ago, and after they broke open, they absorbed Wang Lin‚Äôs flesh and blood to form young scorpions!

The scorpions were using Wang Lin‚Äôs body as a nesting ground and a source of nutrients. After four years, the number of scorpions occupying this space had almost doubled. Not only did they cover Wang Lin, but they also covered most of the ground. It was a shocking sight.

The appearance of the young scorpions caused wrinkles to appear on Wang Lin‚Äôs body. His body gradually withered as it was used as nutrients for the scorpions.

Taking note of this development, Wang Lin had a strong feeling that if he didn‚Äôt take control of his body and leave soon, he would never be able to leave.

He also understood why the green-robed old man hadn‚Äôt appeared and hadn‚Äôt put him through any more tests. It was because time was the best test!

There was no better tool than time to see through something and find the truth.

Wang Lin guessed that the old man was using time to begin a very cruel test on Wang Lin. Only when this test satisfied him would he complete his original plan.

Wang Lin didn‚Äôt know what the consequences would be if the result of this test was not satisfactory.

If there was no problem and his body didn‚Äôt wither, Wang Lin could wait ten years, a thousand years. If he really wanted to wait, then with his decisiveness and determination, he could endure it.

However, right now, the withering of his body made Wang Lin struggle. His firm belief was shaken because everything was just his speculation. He had no real clues to prove any of this.

If his speculation was wrong and he didn‚Äôt leave now, his body would wither completely and he would miss the real opportunity. He would forever remain here!

Similarly, if his judgment was wrong, he would lose a great fortune!

This was a choice, a choice that made Wang Lin struggle!

This struggle lasted for a year. On the fifth year, the struggle disappeared. Wang Lin decisively cut off all other thoughts. With a crazed belief in his own speculation, he calmly waited.

The sixth year, the seventh year, the eight year‚Ä¶ The withering on his body spread to most of his body, but his mind still didn‚Äôt move!!

The ninth year, the tenth year‚Ä¶ His body was surrounded by large amounts of scorpions, and it looked like a bag of bones without any nutrients. It looked like his body would collapse from a gentle breeze, but Wang Lin was still waiting!! F√¥ll√¥w ùíèew stories at nùíê/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Ten years!! He had waited inside the green space for ten years. For the past ten years, he had no idea what had happened outside. Whether the battle between the Green Devil Continent and the Heavenly Bull Continent was still on going, or if it had ended.

During these ten years, Wang Lin‚Äôs origin soul didn‚Äôt control his body; it remained hidden under the protection of the Heaven Defying Bead. He was using his great endurance to gamble!!

What supported his belief was his judgement and analysis. That green-robed old man was obviously a mortal, but Wang Lin felt a sense of terror from him. That old man could make the Devil Dao Sect‚Äôs sect master act politely, so if Wang Lin made a reckless move, he would face great danger.

There were too many secrets he didn‚Äôt know about inside the Green Scorpion Temple. Most importantly, because the green-robed old man was a mortal, his lifespan couldn‚Äôt be too long!

The competition this time was each other‚Äôs patience!

But this was under the premise that Wang Lin‚Äôs speculation was correct!

At this moment, he didn‚Äôt know that there was a cave inside the giant scorpion building, at the head. Inside sat the old man in green, who looked at a green mirror before him. The mirror reflected everything inside the green space where Wang Lin was.

During these ten years of time, Wang Lin wasn‚Äôt the only one waiting. The old man in green had also been waiting.

His lifespan was limited. Although there was a secret spell to make him live longer, every generation of Ji Si only lived for 3,000 years at most.

He was more than 2,800 years old. He was very close to death.

‚ÄúTime is the best method to see the truth‚Ä¶ Even though what I‚Äôm doing is a little redundant, I must do this for the safety of Lord Green Devil‚Ä¶ I want to see if he really lost his mind, or if he is pretending‚Ä¶‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt lack patience. He had lived in this scorpion building for more than 2,000 years and had grown accustomed to the flow of time. It had become second nature to him.

Two years, three years, four years‚Ä¶ The second decade passed as the two waited for each other. This was an extremely cruel battle, far more cruel than ordinary fights between cultivators, because they were fighting with time!

This battle of time was silent, without any trace of conflict, but it was filled with danger. The family of the old man in green had prepared for countless years for this. They couldn‚Äôt afford to lose‚Ä¶

Wang Lin also couldn‚Äôt afford to lose. Right now, even his bones had begun to weaken. If his body wasn‚Äôt that of an Ancient Dao, it would have become completely wasted several years ago.

This green space was mostly covered by green scorpions now, and they emitted green light as they moved.

During these 20 years of time, Wang Lin‚Äôs mind hadn‚Äôt moved at all. He was immersed in the belief of his own faith. It was a rare big gamble in his life.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll never lose‚Ä¶‚Äù This sentence had supported Wang Lin for nearly 20 years.

Time sometimes could be very slow, but it was often like the autumn leaves, falling from the sky. It may feel like a change in season, but in truth, it was only a short journey.

In a flash, another 20 years passed. Wang Lin rarely stayed in one place for 40 years. He had also given up on his body, and his origin soul acted like it was dead.

Even his Ancient Dao body showed signs of complete death after 40 years.

The old man in green was still waiting. In the last 40 years, aside from his daily needs, he spent all his time looking at the mirror and silently waiting.

40 years, 40 years‚Ä¶ After Wang Lin got used to it, a total of 80 years had passed!

On this day in the 80th year, the old man in the green robe revealed a hint of hesitation. He didn‚Äôt believe anyone who was conscious could endure it for 80 years!

And the most important thing was that he didn‚Äôt have much lifespan left‚Ä¶

The choice before him was the same was what Wang Lin had faced back then: to wait or not to wait!
