Chen Xiang sighed, and said: "Yes, and Fierce Saber Race and I have been chasing and killing him the entire time! "Huang Si is my friend. The reason I came here this time is also to find him and tell him some things."

"I was rather worried about him before, but now that I know he’s here, I feel a lot more at ease."

Song Tianchuan and the others were completely shocked that Chen Xiang was actually friends with the World Defying holy dragon!

The World Defying holy dragon, that was a powerful dragon from the Aoshi Holy Stage. The strength of this kind of World Defying beast far surpassed humans, and it was also extremely mysterious. To be able to become friends with humans, Song Tianchuan and the others found it hard to believe.

"Chen Xiang, you ... Are you joking? How did you become friends with the cruel World Defying holy dragon? " Du Rouke asked in shock, her sweet face filled with disbelief.

"World Defying holy dragon is not brutal, it’s mainly because when everyone encounters them, their first reaction is to kill them, because they are covered in treasures." Chen Xiang smiled faintly: "So, the result can be imagined. The World Defying holy dragon will naturally retaliate, otherwise, he would have been killed by others. If we don’t provoke him, he will still be very quiet."

Du Rouke went silent. When they heard that the World Defying holy dragon was here, their first thought was indeed like that. If they killed the World Defying holy dragon, they would be able to obtain a lot of treasures.

"Alright, if you lead us to the World Defying holy dragon, would he attack us?" Song Tianchuan believed that Chen Xiang recognized World Defying holy dragon. After all, Chen Xiang’s previous performance had surprised them greatly.

"Definitely not, I have a good relationship with the World Defying holy dragon." Chen Xiang said, if not he would not rush up to look for the World Defying holy dragon.

"How does the World Defying holy dragon look like? "How big is it?" Du Rouke asked curiously: "I’ve never seen a World Defying holy dragon before!"

"Very big, very mighty, very domineering." Chen Xiang laughed: "But from what I know, he should be able to take human form, as for how he looks like, I don’t know, because that’s something that he can only do after he came to World Defying Stage Soul River."

When the World Defying holy dragon entered the Ancient Fire Divine Sect, the people inside taught him to transform. At that time, Chen Xiang was still in the outer sect.

"If you transform into your human form, it won’t be easy to find him." Song Tianchuan asked: "Why did the Fierce Saber Race and the Soul River Divine Race want to kill him?"

Fierce Saber Race and Soul River Divine Race did indeed have enough strength to hunt World Defying holy dragon!

"Interest? The entire body of the World Defying holy dragon is a treasure." Chen Xiang said: "It could also be that the Fierce Saber Race and Soul River Divine Race wanted to control him and make him their own strength. In short, these two races are very busy and overbearing."

was only at the early stage of Aoshi Holy Stage now, but his Red fire dragon was very strong. Once released, it would at least be equivalent to the strength of the middle stage Aoshi Holy Stage.

Of course, if he used the power of the Tao-creation Incantation, then his power would be even more terrifying. It was just that he did not dare to do it.

"I wonder what is he doing in the Heavenly River Mountain Range. Could he be hiding in there?" However, that’s not right. There were rumors saying that he was here before, and had a conflict with the Fierce Saber Race and with them as well. " Song Tianchuan said as he frowned.

Yu Yilan said in a low voice: "This proves that there is something in the Heavenly River Mountain that World Defying holy dragon is reluctant to leave. After all, it is very dangerous for him to stay here, and both Fierce Saber Race and Fierce Saber Race know that he is here."

"Since the Fierce Saber Race and the Soul River Divine Race did not come during this period of time, it’s clear that the World Defying holy dragon is hiding or hiding in some sort of seal and they are unable to go in." Du Rouke said: "Now that the Five-tiger from Fierce Saber Race is dead, they think that the World Defying holy dragon have appeared."

Chen Xiang looked at the dragon’s scale that was flashing for a moment, and said: "We’ll know the moment we see the World Defying holy dragon, we’ll be able to find him very soon!"

This meant that the World Defying holy dragon was not far from him. Perhaps the World Defying holy dragon was releasing its dragon’s might.

After traversing over the mountains for a few days, Chen Xiang’s Six Realms mirrors had rushed ahead of many people and entered the depths of the Heavenly River Mountain Range. At this time, the Six Realms mirrors was at the summit of a tall mountain.

The place was surrounded by mountains. In the middle of the mountain was a circular lake. In the middle of the lake was a small island. However, the island was shrouded in a white cloud, making it impossible to see what was on the island.

"The World Defying holy dragon should be inside." Chen Xiang said: "I wonder what’s going on with this lake?"

Chen Xiang did not immediately make the Six Realms mirrors fly down, but instead released a few Heaven devouring rat that came to the lakeside to investigate. According to his experience, these beautiful scenery of the lake and the mountains, there must be something special about them.

Not long after the Heaven devouring rat went down, several of them died.

"What’s going on? "A few rats have mysteriously died." Chen Xiang was very suspicious about this. After further investigation, he found that there was a cave in the middle of a tall mountain. At the entrance of the cave sat an old man.

Looking at the old man, Chen Xiang was shocked, "There’s someone here, and it’s not only one of them!" Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Afterwards, he controlled the Six Realms mirrors to carefully spin, and carefully observed the tall mountains surrounding the lake. Then, he used the Six Realms mirrors to pull in the distance, and carefully examined it.

"This guy ..." "Look at his waist." Old Man Qin said, "The golden belt on this old fellow’s waist has patterns that look like rivers. This is the symbol and pattern of the Soul River Divine Race."

"Look at the rest." Song Tianchuan’s expression became serious.

Finally, they discovered that there were a total of eight tall mountains here. All eight elders were in the mountain cave in the middle, four of them belonged to Soul River Divine Race, the other four belonged to Fierce Saber Race!

"They should have been here a long time. I saw an old man covered in dust just now." Du Rouke said: "Looks like the World Defying holy dragon is indeed on the small island in the middle!"

"My rat was killed by one of them." Chen Xiang said: "My rats are extremely cautious, but they were still discovered. These fellows look like they are sleeping at the entrance of the cave, but they know everything that goes on around them like the back of their hands."

Chen Xiang rejoiced in his heart. He only let the Six Realms mirrors peak, and it was even placed flat on the ground, otherwise it would have been discovered.

Just now, only half of the Heaven devouring rat had been killed. Chen Xiang continued to control the remaining Heaven devouring rat to approach the lake.

"Dammit, this lake is terrifying!" Chen Xiang could not help but shout out in shock. Everyone saw from the Six Realms mirrors that the rat had turned into a wisp of black smoke the moment it entered the water. Not even its bones were left.

"No wonder these old things don’t dare to approach the lake, they can only wait outside." Du Rouke said: "Then what do we do now? We can’t get close to the World Defying holy dragon! "

The first thing he did after sending the book was to look at the original content!
