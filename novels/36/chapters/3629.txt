Only after Chen Xiang and Zhou Xingzhi walked out of the Tao-creation Ancient Place did they slow down.

"Old Zhou, do you know when Seven Mountains Divine Island will explode?" Chen Xiang had asked Chu Jinfeng before, but Chu Jinfeng wasn’t sure, he just wanted him to leave Seven Mountains Divine Island quickly.

"I’m not too sure when it will explode. I only know within a month." Zhou Xingzhi suddenly quickened his pace: "They might already know that I have escaped, all of them have been keeping a close eye on us, afraid that we will escape at this stage."

"Your Paternoster Race is truly strange. The other races will definitely make their own tribesmen leave this dangerous place as soon as possible at this time in order to continue the joss stick while your Paternoster Race is not allowed to leave." Chen Xiang found it extremely funny. "You’ve already run away, what can they do if they find out?"

"You don’t know the seniors in the Paternoster Race? As long as the Eight ancestor contract map is still in the Tao-creation Ancient Place, they are restricted from leaving. Only a small portion of us can come out, but there is still a limit!" When Zhou Xingzhi talked about this matter, he also felt extremely saddened, "Those old fellows felt that if they could not live, they would not let us young people live either. However, they are so powerful, if the Seven Mountains Divine Island were to explode, they would still have a chance of living, and us juniors are definitely going to die. "

Chen Xiang couldn’t help but laugh: "I really didn’t believe that you were born in the Paternoster Race. No wonder I felt that all of you were strange back then! But then again, you seem more normal. "

"Because I’ve been out a lot over the years and I’ve been in contact with normal people." Zhou Xingzhi said snappily: "Let’s hurry up and leave the Seven Mountains Divine Island."

The Seven Mountains Divine Island was protected by a barrier, but there was a lake in every city. If they jumped into the lake, they would be able to leave the Seven Mountains Divine Island. If the enchantment was put away, it could also leave from the edge of the Divine Island.

In addition, it could also be passed through the Transmission array.

Chen Xiang had already informed Yang Genming and the others that the Seven Mountains Divine Island would be destroyed, and more and more sound transmissions were being transmitted. It was also at this time that the protective barrier around the Seven Mountains Divine Island disappeared.

"Old Zhou, what plans do you have for the future?" Chen Xiang asked.

"I still don’t have any plans. I still need to get the Eight ancestor contract map destroyed, or else I might just die. If I don’t destroy the Seven Mountains Divine Island within a month, I might be done for." Zhou Xingzhi said, he was extremely worried at the moment.

"You’ll be fine." Chen Xiang patted Zhou Xingzhi’s shoulder, and laughed: "Don’t be so pessimistic, be more optimistic, this will definitely happen."

"I am worried that the Seven Mountains Divine Island will be destroyed one month from now. When that happens, I will die with even more grievances." Zhou Xingzhi said with a pessimistic tone, making him extremely speechless.

Suddenly, Chen Xiang felt the Super Yuan Dan Alliance plate that Chu Jinfeng had given him trembling, which meant that Chu Jinfeng was nearby and was summoning them.

"Old Zhou, I still have things to do. You have to believe that nothing will happen to you." said. He and Zhou Xingzhi stood by the lake, and at this time, many people had come here to jump into the lake. As long as they jumped, they could fall from the lake into the sea.

"Go busy yourself. We’ll meet again if fate allows it." Zhou Xingzhi nodded and then jumped into the lake.

Chen Xiang immediately followed the sign and arrived at a place outside the city where Chu Jinfeng was waiting for him.

"Chen Xiang, are you still not leaving Seven Mountains Divine Island?" Chu Jinfeng’s expression was stern: What are you still doing here? Things are happening faster than I thought! "

"Really?" Chen Xiang said in surprise.

"Of course it’s true. Why do you look so happy?" Chu Jinfeng asked doubtfully: "Alright, if there is nothing else, you should leave the Seven Mountains Divine Island quickly."

"Alright, I’ll leave immediately. Chief, when will you be leaving?" Chen Xiang asked.

"I’ll leave at the last moment. You don’t have to worry about me." Chu Jinfeng said: "We’ll link back then."

Chen Xiang immediately headed towards the city’s lake and jumped into the lake. After a few flashes, he floated up to the sea below the Seven Mountains Divine Island.

Many people had appeared here, and they were all from the Seven Mountains Divine Island. Coming down from above, they all complained that this place was not as good as the Seven Mountains Divine Island, and that all kinds of energy was thinner than the Seven Mountains Divine Island.

They were right, here, the Legendary gas were much thinner, but had no effect on Chen Xiang.

"It should be destroyed soon." Chen Xiang looked at the black shadow high up in the sky. From the looks of it, the Seven Mountains Divine Island was only a small black shadow.

When he arrived at the shore, he discovered that there were already many houses constructed here. Some of the people who were moving quickly had already started to occupy their territories, and they were all rather strong people as well.

If the Seven Mountains Divine Island were to be destroyed, there wouldn’t be that many Holy Crystals.

When Chen Xiang heard someone bring up this issue, he could not help but sigh. After all, he was using the Tao-creation’s Holy Crystals to refine the pellets, and if it was really like this, he did not have much of a profit.

"I wonder where Old Zhou went." Chen Xiang wanted to find Zhou Xingzhi and tell him that the Seven Mountains Divine Island was about to be destroyed so he did not need to worry.

Many people who came down from Seven Mountains Divine Island would wait at the shore. Since Chen Xiang could not find him at the shore, they could only silently bless him.

After Chen Xiang waited on the shore for more than ten days, on this early morning, like many others, he felt a vibration.

Chen Xiang was able to fly in time and avoid the huge wave. Only a few people could be like him, but the majority of the people weren’t so lucky.

"Has it begun?" Chen Xiang could feel a very strong pressure coming from above, it was very far away from the ground, but he could deeply feel the berserk power, which showed just how strong the force was.

BOOM!

A burst of muffled sound came from above, the sea went crazy again, setting off waves that overflowed the heavens.

Chen Xiang stared at the black silhouette in the sky, and only saw that after the black silhouette trembled violently, it suddenly erupted with a wave of white light, and countless specks of light spread out in all directions.

Countless specks of light entered the spatial crack. Chen Xiang also understood why these things were scattered throughout the realms after the Seven Mountains Divine Island exploded. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

"Those are all the Tao-creation’s Holy Crystals!" One of them sighed and said, "I wonder where he’s gone to."

"Yeah, nothing will happen to the Tao-creation Place in the future, looks like a lot of these will fall to the Tao-creation Place. We have to hurry and find it. " After an old man finished speaking, many people left to search for the Seven Mountains Divine Island’s fragment.
