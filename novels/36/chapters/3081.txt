Chen Xiang was startled, and continued releasing the World Defying god fire. What made him angry, was that no matter how many World Defying god fire he released, they would all be immediately engulfed, and if he continued releasing, the World Defying heaven fruit would also continue to absorb his flames.

This way of refining the pellet was simply impossible to continue, which made Chen Xiang very depressed.

"I’ll see if I can use other techniques to succeed." After that, he used a variety of refining methods, all of which were specially designed to deal with this kind of stubborn medicinal ingredient. However, after trying them one by one, he did not succeed.

"It’s a failure. There’s no other way. This guy actually devoured them all!" Chen Xiang was a little disappointed. He had tried for many days and all of them had ended up like this.

"Why don’t you just continue releasing the flames and see how much of this fruit it can be devoured? If he can’t continue devouring it, that would be easy, right?" Feng Ke’er laughed.

"Alright, I’ll try!" Chen Xiang used the Time Domain, then released the strongest World Defying god fire. He planned to burn it for a very long time, which might actually be what Feng Ke’er said.

However, after a few months had passed, the World Defying heaven fruit was still able to absorb a large amount of his flames without any reaction. This made him feel extremely helpless.

"This thing can’t be fed at all." Chen Xiang sighed: "What exactly happened? "I’ll just eat and take a look!"

There was nothing he could do now. He planned to eat it directly and see if he could find out what was so special about it. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

This fruit was the size of an apple. He had originally planned to take a bite out of it, but as he was trying to do so, he felt a sharp pain in his teeth and nearly broke!

"Motherf * cker, this thing is too tough." Chen Xiang couldn’t help but curse, then covered his mouth. He had used a lot of strength to bite just now, how could he have known that it would be so sturdy?

"Let’s try using my golden needle to see if it can be pierced." Feng Ke’er took out his invincible golden needle.

After Chen Xiang received it, he pierced the fruit very smoothly. He had no choice but to admit that the golden needle was indeed terrifying.

"It can pierce through!" After Chen Xiang pulled out the golden needle, he wanted to pour some flame into the hole, but the moment the needle was pulled out, the little hole above started to heal.

"So that’s how it is. This fruit has an extremely strong defensive layer on the surface, and the regeneration ability inside is very strong. It’s a bottomless pit that can swallow large amounts of fire." Chen Xiang used his Gold Needle again. He could feel a bit of resistance when he pierced the skin, but it became much easier after piercing through the skin.

"You can do this!" Feng Ke’er suddenly said excitedly: "Although this golden needle is very small, but you can use it to directly send the flames to the inside of the fruit, and then you will be able to break through the defense of the fruit!"

Chen Xiang’s eyes lit up. This was indeed a good idea, he would immediately try it out!

Very quickly, he successfully channeled the flames through the end of the golden needle. What surprised him was that the golden needle was absorbed very well by the World Defying god fire, and after extracting his World Defying god fire, it would be strengthened a lot, and in the end, it would be transported from the top of the golden needle to the inner parts of the World Defying heaven fruit.

"Let’s see if you can absorb it this time." Chen Xiang held the World Defying heaven fruit in his hand. What made him more suspicious was that the World Defying heaven fruit had never shown any signs of burning, nor did it emit any icy Qi.

When he had such doubts, he suddenly felt a burst of coldness, causing him to turn pale in fright. Because his entire hand was instantly frozen, and he felt that the Icy cold power was quickly spreading, he had no choice but to call out the Heavenly magic sword, slashing his palm down from his wrist.

His broken palm fell to the ground and instantly shattered into ice crystals. The World Defying heaven fruit on top of it also tumbled to the ground.

"So dangerous, I was almost killed by that thing!" Chen Xiang closed his eyes and had the Mei Jing Sisters channel the power of rebirth into his severed arm.

"It seems like this fruit will most likely be able to refine a pill that would allow one to cultivate an unparalleled divine body. Since it’s so terrifying, the defensive power of one’s self will be very strong." Feng Ke’er said.

Chen Xiang nodded. Under the infusion of a large amount of life force from the Mei Jing Sisters, his severed arm had already grown back. He stretched his wrist and nimbly moved his fingers a bit, finally letting out a sigh of relief.

"You can’t take it directly... I must have been a great threat to him, and that’s why I fought back so hard. " Chen Xiang said: "Previously, this fruit swallowed a large amount of my World Defying god fire, it should be used to cultivate."

Chen Xiang used the Heavenly magic sword to hack a few times, but only left a few faint marks, and did not successfully dodge it. He used the Heavenly magic sword to carry the fruit into the Chuangshi god furnace.

"I’ll give it back to you." Chen Xiang took out the golden needles and gave it to Feng Ke’er.

"You don’t need my method?" Feng Ke’er asked.

"There’s no need. Let me try and see if I can use the Time and space power to directly send the flames into the fruit." Chen Xiang said, then closed his eyes and released the Time and space power.

This was only one of his conjectures, but after he tried for a bit, he did not succeed. This World Defying heaven fruit actually managed to cultivate such a strong defensive barrier, it was able to resist his Time and space power from infiltrating it.

Chen Xiang immediately told Feng Ke’er about this shocking discovery.

"Xiao Ke’er, I might need your help next. It’s obvious that there are all sorts of arrays within this thing, these arrays are all formed naturally, and form all kinds of enchantments, which is why it has such a strong defense." Chen Xiang said.

"Alright, I’ll take a look for myself!" After Feng Ke’er ran out, he immediately controlled this fruit to float in front of her, and then carefully examined it.

Very quickly, she saw many very small lines under the skin. These lines looked dense and complicated, but they were actually very profound array Spirit grain.

"Sure enough!" Feng Ke’er saw through it with a glance, and he was extremely excited, "As long as you destroy this formation, you can easily deal with this fruit."

"Yes!" Chen Xiang nodded: "Can you do it?"

"Of course not." After Feng Ke’er finished speaking, he immediately began.

She closed her eyes and a small dot of light appeared on her forehead. Afterwards, a faint beam of light shot out from inside, hitting the World Defying heaven fruit’s surface, revealing a layer of faint light mist.

This was Chen Xiang’s first time seeing her using this method.

"Alright!" Feng Ke’er only opened his eyes a short while later and laughed: "I’ve succeeded, and I’ve even learned this thing’s Spirit grain. The world is big, and there’s nothing too bizarre about it, this kind of fruit is actually born with such a strange and powerful Spirit grain."
