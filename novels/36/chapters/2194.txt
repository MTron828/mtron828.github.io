Yue’er squatted on top of Chen Xiang’s palm, and said: "You just need to release the power of space, leave the rest to me to control."

Chen Xiang did as he was told, releasing a very strong spatial energy which was completely absorbed by Yue’er. Yue’er had also been practicing the Time Formation with the girls for the past few years, so Chen Xiang had no idea how strong she was right now.

"It’s begun." Just as she finished speaking, Chen Xiang immediately felt that his position had changed.

"Alright." Yue’er laughed and said, "However, we are outside the Divine Tripod City and we don’t know what’s going on inside. That’s why I didn’t go in."

Chen Xiang looked at the tall city walls. They were still in perfect condition and the formation had not been damaged, so it did not seem like they had experienced any great battle.

"It hasn’t been long here." Chen Xiang asked.

"It’s about the same as Nine Heaven World, because Nine Heaven World and this dimensional space are gradually approaching." Yue’er replied, "It should have been like this for the past 15 days. It’s reasonable to say that the battle has already begun."

When Chen Xiang arrived at the city gate, he discovered that there was no one guarding it, which made his heart skip a beat. Normally, this kind of situation would happen because the city had already been thrown into chaos and there was no one guarding the gate even when they escaped.

"There doesn’t seem to be anyone inside. Let’s go in and see what’s going on." At this time, she had also entered the ring.

Chen Xiang had changed his appearance, otherwise, it would be troublesome.

After entering the city gate, Chen Xiang saw that it was empty, although it was not destroyed, but it looked very strange.

The originally spacious and lively street was now empty. The shops that were split in half had their doors wide open, and all the people had left.

"Look over there." Yue Er said.

Chen Xiang turned his head to look, only to see that there was purple smoke coming out from the center of the city, he frowned: "That is the direction of the Imperial Nine Palace, they really started fighting."

Just as he said that, a berserk Qi wave suddenly struck Chen Xiang, causing all the stone buildings in the distance to crumble, the Qi wave was like a huge wave, it struck fiercely and the buildings were extremely weak in front of the Qi wave, they were instantly crushed into powder.

Chen Xiang immediately found a crack in the air and hid himself inside, avoiding this wave of air. Although he could block it too, it would still take a lot of effort for him to do so.

After this shock wave, he came out of the space crack and was shocked.

The huge walls of the Divine Tripod City had disappeared, and the originally neat and beautiful buildings had also disappeared. In the blink of an eye, the place had turned into a wasteland and even the Imperial Nine Palace had disappeared.

"The work of a first-tier Celestial King. It should be a battle between first-tier Celestial Kings, and only those with ninety Divine Deity would have such power." Yue Er said. She wasn’t really surprised, because when she was in Star Law Divine Realm, this kind of battle was not rare.

Chen Xiang frowned: "Everything within a thousand miles radius has been destroyed, no wonder everyone in this city left. If they did not leave, many people would have died just now."

"Is this interesting? The entire Divine Tripod Imperial City was destroyed, and the grand Imperial Nine Palace was destroyed?"

Yue Er shook her head and said, "They fought like this for the Divine Nations’s treasures. It doesn’t matter how many treasures there are in this Divine Cauldron Imperial City, they would definitely not care."

"There’s someone ahead." Yue Er suddenly shouted.

Chen Xiang raised his head to look, two figures suddenly flying past, with eight people chasing after them.

"It’s Xiang Hongdao and Xiao Ping! To think that they were being chased. Could it be that the ripples from earlier were caused by them?" Chen Xiang was very shocked, and Yue’er was the same.

Xiang Hongdao and Xiao Ping were neutral, although they had indicated long ago that they would not participate in this battle, they did not expect that they would be tired from it and would even be surrounded.

"Let’s use the Space wind to give them a look. It seems like the situation is very different from what I expected." Yue Er said. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

He was also very nervous at the moment, because the people he was following were definitely very strong. If not, he wouldn’t have let a Pill God of Xiang Hongdao’s level of strength escape in a sorry state.

"Where’s Xiao Yulan? She doesn’t even have a Great National Master, and this Xiang Hongdao is a very powerful Great National Master. If she was beaten to the point of fleeing, Xiao Yulan would be in an even worse situation." Chen Xiang was worried, such a huge change had happened in such a short amount of time.

Chen Xiang followed him using the Space wind. He wondered if he would look outside and at the same time, use the Dao heart Eye to pay attention to the energy undulations in front of him.

"Another ultimate move." Chen Xiang suddenly saw that in front, Xiang Hongdao had condensed a ball of purple energy. After releasing the energy, he flattened a large mountain range as an attack against the people chasing after him.

After Xiang Hongdao released this move, he disappeared without a trace together with Xiao Ping.

"He’s gone." At this time, Chen Xiang did not dare to use his spatial sensing domain, because at this moment, the eight experts floating in the air were all carefully searching for Xiao Ping and Xiang Hongdao.

Yue’er said: "As expected, these guys all have 90 or above Divine Deity. No wonder why when Xiang Hongdao wanted to escape, there were four Great National Master s amongst them. Why would Xiang Hongdao and Xiao Ping be attacked by them together?"

Chen Xiang shook his head. At this moment, he was hiding inside a spatial crack and sent a sound transmission to Yue’er, "Can you find Xiang Hongdao and Xiao Ping?"

"Of course, I’ll take you there." Now, Yue’er was using the Space wind, and had secretly left with Chen Xiang.

After a while, Yue’er brought Chen Xiang far away from that place, and could be considered to be the other end of Divine Cauldron Star.

There was a small village there. The villagers were all simple and honest, and all of them were ordinary people. Only a few of them had cultivation bases.

When Chen Xiang appeared here, he heard someone whispering to him. "What’s going on today?

Hearing these words, Chen Xiang and Yue’er confirmed that Xiang Hongdao and Xiao Ping were here.

After asking around, they found out that Xiang Hongdao and Xiao Ping were at the village entrance. It was obvious that Xiang Hongdao knew the village chief.

When Chen Xiang arrived at the Village Chief’s small courtyard, he sensed a very strong barrier, but he still went up and knocked on it.

"Is the Village Head home?" Chen Xiang asked.

Very soon, someone opened the door. It was an old man with disheveled hair. "I am the village chief. You must be a foreigner. Is there something wrong?"

The village chief was on his guard.

"Am I, Xiao Ping, inside?" Chen Xiang asked again: "My name is Chen Xiang, I have something to talk to him about."

He purposely said it very loudly just now, so that Xiao Ping inside would hear. Sure enough, Xiao Ping very quickly walked to the door.

In order to dispel Xiao Ping’s suspicions, Chen Xiang had changed back to his own appearance, and was then pulled into the small courtyard by Xiao Ping.
