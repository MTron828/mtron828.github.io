"You are an interesting young man with both strength and courage. "Zhou Zhengyang’s eyes were filled with praise. He also knew that Chen Xiang had exploded in anger because of Zhou Chi Hua and Zhou Qi Yi being mistreated by the Heavenly Proud Empress, all for the sake of his daughter.

Chen Xiang only smiled slightly.

"Then you should have heard my conversation with her. Can you dispel my doubts? "Why didn’t you kill her?" Zhou Zhengyang asked.

"There are a total of three reasons! Firstly, I will devour her Space holy soul. If she dies and the Space holy soul I devour does not fuse with me, when my master dies, the Space holy soul will also dissipate. Space holy soul s are extremely valuable, I do not wish to lose them. "

Zhou Zhengyang nodded his head, this was a reasonable decision. Sometimes, even he was a little jealous of the Heavenly Proud Empress’s Space holy soul.

"Secondly, because I feel that I will see you again in the future. If I kill Heavenly Proud Empress, I am afraid that you have feelings for him, and would hate me."

Zhou Zhengyang already knew that Chen Xiang wanted to ask him about some things related to Gu Tong and the Super Yang Old Ancestor.

"Thirdly, the life of the Heavenly Proud Empress will be even worse than death, you all have already thought of that." Chen Xiang chuckled: "I might come to see her later ... "No, it’s to anger her!"

Zhou Zhengyang suddenly felt unwell, the guy in front of him, was actually going in and out of his Heavenly Proud Imperial Palace, as though it was his own home, coming and going as he pleased, he started to suspect if the enchantment around his Heavenly Proud Imperial Palace was installed.

"Then your purpose for coming here, should be to ask about Gu Tong and the Super Yang Old Ancestor, right?" Zhou Zhengyang asked.

"This is one of the things, and another thing... I hope that you can take good care of the Zither sisters. I’m worried that the King’s father-in-law will find them. " Chen Xiang replied, "This makes me very worried."

"You don’t have to worry about that. I’ve been sending people to protect them from the shadows. Not to mention, their grandparents are not weak either." Zhou Zhengyang said.

"Then I am relieved." Chen Xiang said.

"I don’t know much about Gu Tong and Super Yang Old Ancestor. I only know that they are the top masters of artifact forging and formation setting." Zhou Zhengyang said: "The last time I saw them, I was still very young, and was even Heavenly Proud Imperial Palace’s crown prince."

"I wonder where they spent so much time? Is it here? " Chen Xiang asked.

"Not here, but in. Once I step on it, I will be devoured. When I was travelling, I met them near there, and after that, they entered the depths of the Blood Mud Plains. " Zhou Zhengyang sighed: "That place is really scary!"

"In what direction?" Chen Xiang asked.

Zhou Zhengyang took out a map and showed it to Chen Xiang, who quickly memorized the general direction.

"Goodbye, I’ll go take a look now." Chen Xiang said.

"You have to be careful. Also, you have to pay more attention to the people of Dragon Controlling Palace. This is an extremely terrifying force." Zhou Zhengyang said in a serious tone, and then told Chen Xiang about Dragon Controlling Palace’s situation, which was more or less what Grandfather Zhou Zhiqin had said.

"I got it!" This was not the first time someone had warned him like this.

"Oh right, if you want to kill Heavenly Proud Empress, then please!" In the end, Zhou Zhengyang said without mercy. What the Heavenly Proud Empress had done had already made him want to kill her.

... ....

Chen Xiang left the study and immediately headed towards another palace. It was the palace of the Heavenly Proud Empress, and Chen Xiang had one of his Heaven devouring rat follow behind him stealthily.

When the sky darkened, Chen Xiang quietly entered the Heavenly Proud Empress’s chambers. Even though there were a few mid stage Aoshi Holy Stage s guarding the place, they were as transparent as crystal in Chen Xiang’s eyes.

Chen Xiang arrived at Heavenly Proud Empress’s room very easily. Heavenly Proud Empress was currently very weak, she slept very soundly, furthermore, her Divine Sense Sea was already destroyed by Chen Xiang, her cultivation was completely gone, she was extremely weak, and could not even sense that someone had entered her room.

Chen Xiang took out the Six Realms mirrors and set up a barrier, to prevent the sound of this place from spreading. He had to play with this Heavenly Proud Empress a little.

The sleeping Heavenly Proud Empress suddenly felt that something cold was fiddling with her haggard jade face, but she didn’t want to wake up because she was too sleepy.

But the thing kept touching her face, and she had to open her eyes.

Heavenly Proud Empress blurrily opened her eyes and saw Chen Xiang making a face at her. She immediately screamed in fear.

"Ah... "Ahhhh ..." Heavenly Proud Empress suddenly jumped up from the bed and retreated, screaming loudly, "Men, men!"

"Come your grandpa, even if you scream your head off, no one will hear you." Chen Xiang laughed out loud.

"It’s actually you ..." Little bastard! " When Heavenly Proud Empress saw that it was Chen Xiang, he confirmed that he was not dreaming.

She never thought that Chen Xiang had actually already snuck into the Heavenly Proud Imperial Palace, and that King’s father-in-law was still looking for Chen Xiang everywhere.

"You can scold me however you like, since it’s not like I’m going to lose a piece of meat!" No matter how much you scold me, it would not change the fact that you’re a piece of trash, haha ... " Chen Xiang mercilessly taunted Heavenly Proud Empress.

Heavenly Proud Empress was so angry that he grabbed his pillow and threw it towards Chen Xiang.

"You ... What do you want? Are you here to kill me? "Give me a quick death, I’m not afraid of death." Heavenly Proud Empress’s voice was filled with hatred.

"I want to kill you. You were dead when you came out of the study." Chen Xiang curled his lips: "Also, Heavenly Proud Divine Lord doesn’t mind me killing you!"

The Heavenly Proud Empress roared: Then why haven’t you made your move? Quickly kill me!

"Wouldn’t killing you be letting you off easy?" Chen Xiang sneered.

Heavenly Proud Empress was not afraid of death, but was afraid of being tortured to death, so she wanted to ask for a quick death. Seeing Chen Xiang’s expression, her heart skipped a beat, she was worried that Chen Xiang would torture her to death.

"What do you want?" Heavenly Proud Empress was extremely terrified, forcing himself to stay calm.

"I’ll give you a way out of this, and I won’t kill you." Chen Xiang sat on a chair. Earlier, he did not give Zhou Zhengyang another reason not to kill the Heavenly Proud Empress.

This was something that the Heavenly Proud Empress had definitely not comprehended himself. For the Heavenly Proud Empress to be able to hide in the air, this move made Chen Xiang feel that it was very strange. At the very least, Chen Xiang was not able to do it right now.

"Which way?" Heavenly Proud Empress asked, she was worried that Chen Xiang would torture her.

"As long as you pass this secret technique of using the power of space to me, I’ll let you go." Chen Xiang said.

Thinking about his own Space holy soul, Heavenly Proud Empress was so angry that his heart was bleeding.

"It’s not that I don’t want to pass it on to you ... It’s just a coincidence that I got this inheritance, including the Space holy soul! " Speaking till the end, Heavenly Proud Empress almost gritted her teeth as she spoke. From this, it could be seen how much she hated Chen Xiang.
