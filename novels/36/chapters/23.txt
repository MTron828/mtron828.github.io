Chapter 24: Violent attack

Fist and sword both collided with each other, as a powerful momentum a wave of True Qi surged in every direction. As the azure aura exploded, Chen Xiang’s vigorous True Qi broke Yao Tianhua’s long sword with a sharp sound.

Chen Xiang’s [Heavenly Tiger Storm Killing Fist] were unstoppable. Violent fists with powerful and steaming True Qi smashed into Yao Tianhua, pressuring him until he was unable to move his body nor was he able to take a breath.

“Stop!” Just then the Yao Family Elder shouted, but Chen Xiang’s fists were like thunderbolts attacking from the sky. Everyone was extremely shocked, even their eyes and mouths were fully open. Accompanied by powerful wind, Yao Tianhua body flew off the stage, vomiting large amounts of blood as he fainted mid-air.

The Yao Family Elder as well as several of the Yao Family bodyguards quickly flew into the sky and landed near the fallen Yao Tianhua.

“You....you actually injured him so heavily!” the Yao Family Elder angrily shouted. He quickly took out a pill and placed it inside Yao Tianhua’s mouth.

After treating Yao Tianhua, he handed him over to the Yao Family bodyguards, then the Yao Family Elder jumped up onto the High stage.

Chen Xiang, just with his fists, broke Yao Tianhua’s sword and severely wounded him in the process. This level of strength made others hang their heads in shame. At this time, the other family juniors were very excited, because they realized that the Chen and Yao Families were now mortal enemies. Moreover that Yao Family Elder was currently preparing to fight Chen Xiang.

The Chen Family Elders and branch commanders were also getting ready to deal with the trouble, but before they could move they were stopped by Chen Tianhu, In a low voice he said to them “Everyone do not move! We will simply watch this spectacular play.”

Chen Yihan said with a somewhat unnatural complexion “This brat defeated me with only a 5th level Mortal Martial Realm strength. Now he has already advanced to the 6th level. That Yao Family Elder will absolutely not be able to take advantage of him in any way.”

Although the Yao Family Elder’s strength was in 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, for Chen Xiang, who cultivated divine exercises and had a Yin and Yang Divine Veins, it would not be difficult for him to defeat the Yao Family Elder.

Someone who was highly talented with huge potential would become the future of their family. Although Chen Family was very powerful, they also had many powerful families that were secretly hostile towards them. Now that the other family’s juniors had witnessed Chen Xiang’s strength, those families with vile intentions against Chen Family were bound to restrain their thoughts. Also, the other families would try to get friendly with the Chen Family to establish equally beneficial relations.

“What’s wrong? Can the younger generation not beat the elders?” Chen Xiang sneered, while his pair of fists occasionally burst out with azure lightning. Everyone present in the field was surprised, didn’t Chen Xiang cultivate flames? How come he was releasing such violent lightning True Qi?

The Yao Family Elder was not stupid. He realized that this was not the true extent of Chen Xiang’s strength. What surprised him even more was the fact that the Chen Family experts didn’t even step forward to help Chen Xiang! This made the Yao Family Elder feel an inexplicable shame, because the Chen Family experts believed that Chen Xiang could easily cope with him, in fact it seemed like they disdained to even step forward to deal with him!

Chen Xiang looked at the Yao Family Elder standing in front of him and said while watching that old face grimaced in anger “Yao Family Elder, in the end what did you come here to do? Are you also going to exchange pointers with me?”

Exchange pointers? One who had lived dozens of years was going to exchange pointers with a ten or so year old brat! This was simply going to make him a laughing stock, whether he wins or not, this matter could only tarnish his reputation.

“You...you wounded Tianhua!” the Yao Family Elder really had nothing else to say because he simply jumped up on the stage in spur of the moment.

Chen Xiang slowly said in a relaxed tone, “So what? If I did not retaliate, his sword would have pierced my throat! I did not kill him, that is already me being lenient!”

Anyone could see that Yao Tianhua’s sword attack was very ruthless, so Chen Xiang’s actions were also natural. Furthermore, they were in a martial competition, getting injured was obviously unavoidable!

Only the Yao Family Elder felt unjustified, he belonged to one dignified dan aristocratic family, and had a wide network of many strong families who had alliances with the Yao Family. But today, the Yao Family not only lost their precious herbs but also their face. Moreover, the Yao Family prided alchemist also got injured, and all of this was due to Chen Xiang!

“Hahaha....” the Yao Family Elder suddenly looked up and laughed: “One little Chen Family really dares to overestimate their own capabilities and is going to try to oppose my Yao Family! Today I will teach a lesson to a brat who does not even know the immensity of heaven and earth!”

The Yao Family Elder was already desperate, in his opinion the Chen Family was only a small family, even if he taught a lesson to Chen Xiang this one time, the Chen Family would not dare to say anything. Plus, even if the two families went to war, the Yao Family would definitely not lose.

“Shameless old bastard! It’s your Yao Family who don’t know the immensity of heavens and earth. The Yao Family has already lost face because of you today.” Chen Xiang said in a loud and clear voice which resounded over the whole field.

In their hearts, everyone had already secretly despised the Yao Family. They didn’t even admit defeat and now they were also trying to bully the weak. They were relying on their strength and prosperity, regardless of morality and justice they were going to attack Chen Xiang. It was simply too ridiculous!

The Yao Family Elder got more angry. With a howl, his whole body was suddenly covered in fiery-red True Qi. From both of his eyes fire was gushing out and with just one step he appeared in front of Chen Xiang. Both of the Yao Family Elder’s palms resembled radiant fiery meteors and the strike rushed towards Chen Xiang. Whilst an invisible wall made of the fiery True Qi aura surrounded Chen Xiang.

Those pair of hot palms had not yet hit Chen Xiang, but the invisible True aura had already penetrated Chen Xiang’s body. Yet he just stood still with calmness and tranquillity, similar to a mountain even when faced with the scorching flames. Both his fists were overflowing with True Qi, azure light flashing above them. They immediately transformed into tiger heads, and this attack was even bigger than the one that heavily injured Yao Tianhua!

Flames were gushing out from the Yao Family Elder’s whole body, appearing ferocious like an angry fiery devil, vigorous True Qi gathered around on his pair of skinny palms.

“Old man, actually even against me you are resorting to such a heavy hand! Then I’m also not going to be polite!” Chen Xiang suddenly roared like a mad dragon, while azure Qi waves spewed out from inside his mouth. Suddenly, a fierce azure wind started blowing. Within this fierce wind, azure lightning was flashing one after another. At the same time Chen Xiang like a bolt moved towards the Yao Family Elder, that pair of tiger heads fists instantaneously transformed into two solemn and powerful Azure Dragon heads.

The [Azure Dragon Roar] released a fierce wind containing lightning, and it was very powerful. After seeing this, the Yao Family Elder could not help but be surprised, at this time he also saw two giant dragons that were roaring and rushing towards him.

“You brat!!!!!!”the Yao Family Elder was panic-stricken from watching Chen Xiang’s violent True Qi rushing towards him. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Both of Chen Xiang’s fists met with the approaching Yao Family Elder’s fire palms. Punching each other away, the palm and fist fiercely collided. ‘Bang!’ With thunderous sounds and with various flashing lights due to the blast, Qi waves resembled sea waves, as the hurricane like momentum spread in every direction, instantaneously destroying the high stage and even lifted up some of the nearby dining tables and chairs.

Everyone was dumbstruck, unexpectedly a sixteen year old teenager was on par with the Yao Family Elder, moreover he even got the upper hand! Everyone could clearly notice the blood overflowing from the corners of the mouth of the Yao Family Elder.

Although Chen Xiang looked embarrassed and could not bear with it, but he was steadily standing there like a mountain, with uniform breath. Unlike the Yao Family Elder, who was panting. Everyone could see that the Yao Family Elder probably had consumed a huge amount of True Qi to withstand the crazy and fierce attack from Chen Xiang.
