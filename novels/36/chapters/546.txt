Chapter 547 - Returning to the Magic Academy

The Big Eclipse lasted for a month. The land that was enveloped in darkness for a month was once again illuminated by the sun’s rays. Many people were no longer surprised, but many forces were no longer calm.

Not a single one of the elders and hall masters who went to the first profound Realm were able to return, and this was also true for Divine Martial Palace’s hall master, Wang Quan and the two elders.

At this time, many of the big shots of the various forces were discussing about this matter. Some of them were taking joy in Qin Zejun’s misfortune, while some were worrying deeply, especially those forces of the Eastern Ocean.

Roughly eighty people went in but only forty of them could come out. Chen Xiang had killed more than thirty of them, and there were a few that could not come out due to other reasons.

In order to stabilize the situation, those powers who had lost their leader hurriedly picked out a suitable person, and Fire Divine Palace and the Demon Subduing Academy all contacted the upper echelons of Heaven Realm. Fire Divine Palace losing a powerful hall master and a few elders was the strongest power of the Fire Divine Palace, if not for these people acting as deterrents in the Fire Divine Palace, the Fire Divine Palace would have been annihilated easily.

After Zuo Zhen Xuan reported this to the Heaven Realm, he also began to investigate. He wanted to ask about the people who entered the First profound Realm that day, because he felt that this matter was very strange.

The First profound Realm was already closed. If they wanted to enter again, they would have to wait until the next Big Eclipse, so no one could enter to investigate.

When Liu Meng’er went in, it was a bit late, so no one knew that she had gone in, and Chen Xiang was also the first person in there, so his whereabouts were extremely secretive, and even more so, no one knew. After Liu Meng’er returned, he did not immediately start closed-door training, but asked about the situation.

Previously, Chen Xiang had given Liu Meng’er a few ingredients to refine the Life Recovery Pill, but Liu Meng’er had always given them to him to refine. Furthermore, the place Hua Xiangyue was at was very suitable for cultivation, so she stayed inside.

Arriving in the mountain forest outside of the Anti-Demon Academy, Chen Xiang stayed there for about ten days before suddenly slapping his head, "Dammit, I forgot to give the box containing the Heaven Grade Pills to Elder Sister Meng’er!"

Su Meiyao had gotten the box from Zheng Chu. Based on the faint aura left on the box, Su Meiyao could tell that it was a Heaven Rank pill, but he did not know what kind of Heaven Rank pill it was.

"There’s plenty of opportunities. Even if it’s a Heaven grade pill, you can’t casually use it right now. Otherwise, your body will explode from the torment of that energy." Su Meiyao said.

Chen Xiang took out the Luo Tian Gate and opened a dimensional door, appearing inside the bathrooms inside Xue Xianxian’s and Leng Youlan’s house. However, there was no one inside the bathtub, causing Chen Xiang to be rather disappointed.

"Little Scoundrel, you were sent here on purpose." Last time, Chen Xiang suddenly appeared here, causing him to have a feast in his eyes. Leng Youlan’s perfect body of a white haired beauty was still stuck in his mind.

Xue Xianxian and Leng Youlan were not here, but it was already evening, so it was generally their time to return.

Chen Xiang sat in the courtyard, waiting for the two girls to return. He did not wait long, before feeling a threatening aura approaching him, causing his expression to change greatly, but he quickly calmed down, because the aura was from Zuo Zhenxuan.

"Chen Xiang, you are so brave. You actually dared to come back." Zuo Zhen Xuan said while smiling. At this time, Zuo Zhen Xuan was already the dean, and he had returned to his former manner, unlike what Chen Xiang had seen in the dungeon.

That was why Zuo Zhenxuan was very grateful to Chen Xiang. Otherwise, he would still be in the underground prison, where the sun did not rise.

Hehe, Principal Zuo, I would like to borrow that Stellar Transposition realm. Chen Xiang laughed.

"Of course it’s convenient, I’ve already arranged for your two little lovers to go in, but they only go in for five days each time, which is equivalent to five years. This is the fourth time they have gone in, you know, they can only go in for twenty days at most, and then there will be no effect." Zuo Zhen Xuan said.

Twenty days, twenty years. Chen Xiang felt that it was enough for him to learn how to refine many pills, and in addition, he could take this opportunity to create Divine Liquid, as well as create a large amount of precious medicinal herbs. By then, he would probably be the richest person in the entire mortal world.

Chen Xiang said: "I need to go in for twenty days, you should know that I am a Alchemist, these few days I have been increasing my strength, now I need to use this time to learn pill refining!"

Zuo Zhen Xuan nodded and said, "No problem, but you will definitely feel bored after staying in there for twenty years."

"Oh right, what kind of background does that Zheng Chu guy have? He can come down from the Heaven Realm, and he seems to be very strong, do you still want him to kill me?" Chen Xiang asked in a low voice.

Zuo Zhen Xuan frowned and sighed: "Don’t worry, he won’t pursue you anymore, because he hasn’t come out from that First profound Realm yet, and it’s still unknown whether he’s dead or alive. I have already reported to the Heaven Realm, they plan to send the next group of people to investigate this!"

Chen Xiang pretended to be shocked. "It looks like my luck isn’t bad!" Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Zuo Zhen Xuan sighed: "Zheng Chu has quite a high position in Devil-suppressing Divine Palace, he was treated as a person to be groomed, and within five hundred years, he passed through the Nirvana Tribulation, which is a rare occurrence in this world. Now that he has gone missing, Devil-suppressing Divine Palace will send some people to investigate and find him, from this point alone can be seen!"

Chen Xiang now understood why Zheng Chu’s storage ring had over ten thousand top quality Spiritual crystal and even Heaven Level Pills. It turned out that his status was so high.

"It seems that Devil-suppressing Divine Palace will send even more vicious people this time. I should finish borrowing the Dou Hualong Stellar Transposition as soon as possible." Chen Xiang said. He had originally planned to wait a few days for Xue Xianxian and Leng Youlan to gather, but now he had to hurry up.

Zuo Zhen Xuan said in a low voice: "Change your appearance and I’ll bring you there again. It might take around a month for someone from the Devil-suppressing Divine Palace to come down!"

Chen Xiang immediately took out his tools and made it so that no one would be able to tell that he was Chen Xiang. Zuo Zhenxuan nodded in satisfaction.

"Principal Zuo, I heard that it was extremely difficult to get Devil-suppressing Divine Palace to bring him down from Heaven Realm." asked. Not only the Devil-suppressing Divine Palace, the Fire Divine Palace could also bring him down. Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou had told him before that this was extremely difficult.

"Using a transmission array, the current array formation is becoming more and more powerful, and can even break through the barrier of the Heavenly Mortal Realm. However, it can only send those under the Nine Tribulations down, and once they do, it will be difficult to go up. When they do, they will have to cross the Nine Tribulations and fly up, so when they come down, they all have their things with them!"

Zuo Zhen Xuan’s words made Chen Xiang’s eyes light up. If he was to specifically kill this kind of rich and powerful Half Immortal from the Heaven Realm, then he would earn big, but he would only be able to beat this kind of guy in environments where he couldn’t use his Innate Qi.
