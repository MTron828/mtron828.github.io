Chen Xiang clapped his hands and laughed: "How is the quality?"

Xiao Baifeng opened her palm and looked at the four Five elements Dan s. Her face was filled with disbelief, and she was shocked speechless, and she was currently thinking about what tricks Chen Xiang could do, but she had been staring at Chen Xiang the entire time, and the pill furnace was also given by her!

Furthermore, these four Five elements Dan had also just come out, so she could be sure of this! However, a Alchemist like Chen Xiang who could even sell her pill furnaces, who was sloppy about concocting pills and did not follow the pill formulas when concocting pills, had now refined four Five elements Dan s!

"I only know that in the Divine Cauldron Nation, only the Great National Master is able to produce four Five elements Dan, but it seems that their speed is not as fast as you!" Xiao Baifeng looked at Chen Xiang from a new angle. She had already confirmed that these four Five elements Dan were refined by Chen Xiang, and he had refined them while chatting with her.

"This... Doesn’t that mean I’m very powerful? " Chen Xiang pretended to be surprised.

Xiao Baifeng nodded, "Very powerful! Amongst the middle ranking Alchemist, you alone can match up to eighteen of them. You only need one set of medicinal ingredients and in two hours, you can refine four Five elements Dan s, while the other Alchemist need four sets of medicinal ingredients. Of course, there are a small number of young genius Alchemist s who are still inferior to you. "

"Oh!" Then can I become your subordinate now? " Chen Xiang laughed. Although this Xiao Baifeng did not know how to laugh, he knew that this little beauty had a very good heart.

Xiao Baifeng clenched his teeth and said: "Yes, you can follow me into Imperial Nine Palace! Once you’re inside, you must listen to me and not run around inside. Otherwise, it’s very easy for you to cause trouble. "

In Xiao Baifeng’s eyes, Chen Xiang was a young, talented Alchemist, and her potential to grow up was very high. She might very well become a famous Pill God in the future, which would be of help to herself.

Chen Xiang followed Xiao Baifeng and entered a large carriage pulled by several lions, and then entered the Imperial Nine Palace that was like a city in a city.

This is your identity jade token! If someone asks you, show your jade tablet, and you will know that it’s my, Xiao Baifeng’s, people, and they will not do anything to you! Remember, don’t cause trouble in there. Even I can’t protect you if you provoke the royal daughter. Besides that, there are many royal relatives too. There are simply too many people who cannot be offended. For example, the subordinates of some of the Godking, and the disciples of some of the Godking ... "

Following that, Xiao Baifeng listed a lot of people that he could not offend, and sometimes, he might not even mess with some cats and dogs, because it was very possible that they were the pets of some royal girls.

"What a dangerous feeling, is there any trouble stepping on a flower?" Chen Xiang sighed.

"Not bad, accidentally trampling an expensive flower to death will cause trouble." Xiao Baifeng nodded seriously.

"Elder Sister Bai Feng, I really admire you for being able to stay in there for so long." Chen Xiang cupped his hands towards her, then took out his own backpack and grabbed Yue’er out: "Elder Sister Bai Feng, can I bring this kitten in? This is my little pet. It has been with me for many years. "

Yue’er was only a little bigger than a palm, and her entire body was completely white. Her neck was being pinched by Chen Xiang, and at this moment, she was waving her four short legs, meowing and calling her cute and adorable. Even the cold looking Xiao Baifeng couldn’t help but to reach out and carefully hold Yue’er up.

"Of course you can!" Xiao Baifeng caressed Yue’er’s palm affectionately.

Chen Xiang secretly despised Yue’er’s cute little thing. He knew this little kitten’s background;

"But you have to be careful not to let anyone else see! Especially those aristocratic ladies who like small animals. If they want to rob you, it will be troublesome. " At this moment, Xiao Baifeng was reluctant to return Yue’er to Chen Xiang.

"Elder Sister Bai Feng, why don’t I temporarily hand it over to you? Those royal women wouldn’t dare to ask for it from you, since you are one of the people by the Jade Cauldron Divine King’s side." Chen Xiang said: "She is a special cat, you can’t enter the Storage magic treasure, otherwise, you will die ... And she will say something. "

"Little thing, say a few words!" Chen Xiang used his finger to poke Yue’er’s face. After Yue’er meowed a few times, she shouted, "Little Scoundrel, don’t touch me!"

When Chen Xiang saw Xiao Baifeng laughing so happily, he also giggled: "Elder Sister Bai Feng, take good care of this little thing. She has been with me for many years."

"Don’t worry!" Xiao Baifeng took out her own small backpack, looking much better looking than Chen Xiang’s black bag. Yue’er, who was inside, also felt very comfortable, she understood Chen Xiang’s intentions.

After Chen Xiang entered the Imperial Nine Palace, he definitely could not run around randomly, and Yue’er, who followed Xiao Baifeng, could get close to him.

The Imperial Nine Palace was surrounded by a nine-sided city wall. The inside of the wall was extremely huge, like a few huge cities.

When the car entered the gate, it stopped for a while. Someone then opened the car and checked inside to confirm the identity before letting the car continue on.

"Elder Sister Bai Feng, what do I need to do after I enter?" Chen Xiang asked.

"Stay at my residence for the time being. After that, I’ll do my best to help you obtain the pill formula so that you can forge pills!" Xiao Baifeng said: "We are going to the Jade Cauldron Palace, one of them! Previously, it wasn’t called Jade Cauldron Palace, but was now occupied by the princess, so its name was changed. "

"Since I’m in Jade Cauldron Divine King’s territory, then am I not very safe? What are you worried about? " Chen Xiang laughed.

"Hard to say, there are a lot of women and children in the Divine Lord. His weaker children would usually join the princess, a first-rate Divine King. Hence, the princes and royal girls were all very strong, having the blood of the Divine Lord, adding on to that, their status and resources would make it impossible for ordinary people to compare to them. And you must know that people with such esteemed statuses normally look down on outsiders. "

"I understand. I’ve met many of these fellows as well!" Chen Xiang laughed. What he did not say was that after this guy provokes him, most of them will be killed by him.

Chen Xiang felt that the carriage sped up, and before long, Xiao Baifeng let him off.

"The environment is pretty good!" Chen Xiang looked around, it was a medium-sized courtyard with a pond and an arch bridge. The pavilion was right beside a garden, and although the green and soft lawn was the most, the courtyard was very big, but the houses were relatively small, it was only a hall and a few rooms.

"This is already the Jade Cauldron Palace, you must not leave this courtyard. When I have time, I will bring you around to familiarize you with this place." Xiao Baifeng brought Chen Xiang into one of the rooms: "There’s a secret room inside. It’s good as long as you refine pills inside, my place is very quiet, no one will come here."
