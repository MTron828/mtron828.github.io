Dongfang Xinyue took out a map. This was Di Tian’s map, Chen Xiang could immediately tell at a glance.

"Take a look at the routes on these three pieces of paper. They look very similar to the routes on the map." Dongfang Xinyue said somewhat excitedly.

Chen Xiang took a closer look and confirmed that they were indeed similar. Furthermore, they were all waterways, great rivers that had existed since a long time ago, so it had not changed even up till now.

"Although we are still short of three, I believe that the final indication should be the source of this great river." Dongfang Xinyue placed her jade fingers on the map, on a desert.

Chen Xiang said: "I have never been to this place before, but I have heard that it is very magical. It is the source of a large river, but it is very desolate.

This place is now called the Sand Demon, there are a lot of Sand Monsters in the desert, but their overall strength is not that great, just that there are more of them and there are many sand cities built there, there are also a lot of humans inside, the source is the forbidden area of the Sand Demon, we have to infiltrate it and then enter into the source to investigate. Dongfang Xinyue said: "I can complete it by myself, it would be best if you could accompany me there."

Dongfang Xinyue really wished that Chen Xiang could go with her, so he pouted his lips and shook Chen Xiang’s arm.

"Will you be back before dawn?" Chen Xiang looked at the door to Liu Meng’er’s room.

"Even if they don’t come back, they won’t be jealous. I’m your slave, so it’s normal for me to be with you. They didn’t mind for a long time." Dongfang Xinyue laughed with a deeper meaning.

"Alright, let’s leave a message here first." Chen Xiang took out a jade talisman and handed it over to Dongfang Xinyue, telling her to record what happened on it. If they didn’t come back, Liu Meng’er and the others would know what happened.

After Dongfang Xinyue finished, she made Chen Xiang change his appearance, while she herself made a simple disguise to make herself look less conspicuous.

"I plan to accompany you for a few days, then go back to busy myself with other matters. It’s best if you come back quickly." Chen Xiang was pulled out of the cave by Dongfang Xinyue.

"Although you often don’t come back to them, they can understand your situation. They won’t blame you." Dongfang Xinyue took out a jade tablet, passed through many entrances to the enchantments, and arrived at a square that was filled with Transmission array s.

This was the Transmission array that the Ice Dragon Villa had built themselves. Through this Transmission array, Dongfang Xinyue and Chen Xiang arrived at the Sky Sand City inside the Sand Demon Realm.

Just as he arrived, Chen Xiang frowned. Because there was a sandstorm, and sand was flying everywhere. In the darkness of the night, it seemed even more oppressive.

"This Heavenly Sand City is too simple and crude. There is actually no grand formation to protect the city, and the sandstorms are wreaking havoc everywhere." Chen Xiang complained.

Dongfang Xinyue seemed to be very familiar with this place, and quickly walked towards an inn with Chen Xiang in tow. There were still a few hours until daybreak, and there weren’t many inns that opened their doors that night.

"Although the environment here is very bad, there are a lot of genius treasures here, especially the high quality materials for artifact forging. Even the materials for Holy level s have appeared before. I often come here to buy materials." Dongfang Xinyue laughed: "This sandstorm has a gap, it will stop very soon."

"You have all used up the refining materials that I had Little Lizhi and my master bring you." Chen Xiang asked: "If you don’t have it, I will think of a way to get some for you. It will be hard to come out all day to look for materials."

"It’s no trouble at all. Collecting rare and precious materials is also a type of pleasure." Dongfang Xinyue stuck out his tongue coarsely: "It’s just that sometimes Spar s are a little lacking."

"Your smithing materials are quite high, so they’re the most suitable to be used to make Saint Weapons. However, you don’t need that many Saint Weapons right now, and refining them is also very tiring. You only refine them when you need them, so there’s still a lot to be used." Dongfang Xinyue held Chen Xiang’s arm and intimately sat inside the inn with Chen Xiang, waiting for the sandstorm to pass.

Chen Xiang pinched her face and laughed: "If only Xiangyue was here too. Shuang Xiang, Shuang Yue, you two are such a perfect match."

"Perhaps it’s because of that Master-servant Contract, but we’ve always wanted to follow you." Dongfang Xinyue leaned on Chen Xiang and said gently.

"How about I untie it for you?" Chen Xiang said: "Is the Master-servant Contract a hindrance to you guys?"

"No, that’s good. I think it’s not wrong to have this mysterious connection with your soul." Dongfang Xinyue chuckled: "I’m just different from the other women."

As the sandstorm stopped, Dongfang Xinyue led Chen Xiang out of the city and into the Sand Demon Clan’s territory. Looking from afar, they could see that there were many tall mountains ahead of them.

It’s been built over many years just like the termite mountain. It’s very strong, and the tunnels inside also form many Spirit grain s, giving these sand mountains a natural defense, which is very magical. Last time when Meng’er and I entered these sand mountains, we learned a lot of things. Dongfang Xinyue said.

Dongfang Xinyue and Liu Meng’er’s relationship was very good, and they were as close as sisters. They had often studied the various Spirit grain formations together, as well as artifact forging, the same way as Xue Xianxian. At the moment, Dongfang Xinyue had only turned into a saint not too long ago, and was not very strong, but her attainments in artifact forging was very high.

Chen Xiang held Dongfang Xinyue’s soft jade hand, and released a divine power to investigate her body. After sensing it, Dongfang Xinyue frowned, but did not resist.

"What are you looking at inside my body?" Dongfang Xinyue asked.

"Nothing, I just feel that you and Jingjing shouldn’t be so weak." Chen Xiang said. The Dongfang family and the Vermillion Bird had a close relationship back then, so as the descendants of the Dongfang family, they shouldn’t be so weak. Xue Xianxian and Liu Meng’er’s current strength far exceeded theirs.

The Vermillion Bird had been killed by the White Tiger, but the White Tiger had also died. However, the Vermillion Bird should have been reborn, and experts at its level should have been able to do so as well.

That silly girl Jing Jing is very innocent, and did not put in all her effort to cultivate, her strength is not very strong, which is normal, but back then you and Elder Sister Meng’er were equally strong, but now you are lagging behind her by so much, that’s why I feel that it’s a little strange, you don’t mind if I check your body, do you? Chen Xiang said again.

Dongfang Xinyue lowered his head, obviously considering whether to tell Chen Xiang something.

Chen Xiang kissed her red lips and laughed: "If this is your secret, then you don’t have to tell me."

Dongfang Xinyue nodded his head: "You are my master, so I shouldn’t have any secrets about you. I will tell you, when we return from this place, I think this place is related to me."

"Why don’t we talk while we walk? Your Dongfang family has some relationship with the Vermillion Bird. I know that the White Tiger went crazy and killed the Vermillion Bird. Now that the White Tiger has been revived, the Vermillion Bird should be in the nine heavens as well." Chen Xiang said.

"You know quite a lot." Dongfang Xinyue said softly. Then, he brought Chen Xiang and walked within a few of the more hidden short mountains. They floated and avoided stepping on the sand to the best of his abilities, in order to avoid alerting the Sand Demon.

Chen Xiang followed behind Dongfang Xinyue and asked in a low voice, "Between you and Jingjing, there was the rebirth of a Vermillion Bird."

Dongfang Xinyue laughed, "Of course not, if we are the reincarnation of a Vermillion Bird, we should be very strong. We only have the Vermillion Bird’s bloodline, so our ancestors were highly regarded by the Vermillion Bird, thus the Vermillion Bird bestowed a Vermillion Bird Blood Pellet to our ancestors.

"In other words, you shouldn’t have only this kind of strength." Chen Xiang said. Dongfang Jing did not wholeheartedly pursue strength, but her strength was still incomparable to many others. Therefore, her talent was not bad.

"What? Do you despise me for being weak?" Dongfang Xinyue purposely revealed a resentful expression.

"Of course not." Chen Xiang laughed.

As they spoke, they arrived at a huge mountain. The mountain was not high, but the area it covered was very wide. It was like a semicircle covering the ground, comparable to several huge cities.

"This is the place where the defenses of the Sand Demon Clan are the strictest." Dongfang Xinyue said.

"I heard the sound of water flowing. The source of the river should be here." Chen Xiang was also suddenly very curious, this was the source of that large river, it should be filled with the fragrance of birds and flowers, but it was filled with sand and rocks all day, it was not angry at all, it was so dry everywhere.

Dongfang Xinyue and Chen Xiang were hiding in a cave inside a small mountain, she suddenly shouted: "The sandstorm is coming!"

Just as Dongfang Xinyue finished speaking, he saw the outside of the cave turn blurry and blurry. The gigantic mountain in front of him was actually the source of the sandstorm, it was simply too strange. Countless sand sprayed out from inside, but why was it the source of a large river?

The sandstorm here is very strong, it’s best not to get too close. I heard that this sand was spat out by the Sand Demon Emperor, and it’s able to sense the source of the river. Dongfang Xinyue was so familiar with all this, it was obvious that he had done a very thorough investigation.

"Warm Moon, take the chance to talk about the reason why you are here. I did not discover your Dantian in your body just now, you did not cultivate the divine way to merge your Dantian into the Divine Sense Sea, right?" Chen Xiang asked.

"Of course not, I was cultivating in the Vermillion Bird bloodline. I only changed my cultivation after I became a Saint, and the ancient books of the clan mentioned it, so our dantians have already fused with our bloodlines. Our cultivation method is rather strange, and at the beginning it was very slow, but once our bloodlines stabilized, our progress will increase by leaps and bounds." Dongfang Xinyue laughed complacently: "At that time, I might be even more powerful than you."

In truth, back then the Vermillion Bird’s body was destroyed. Her soul is still here, and as someone who cultivates the divine way, you should know that without a physical body, there is no need for her soul to be reincarnated.

"And what about her now?" Chen Xiang asked curiously.

"I don’t know. I think she should be in the Sacred Water Heavenly Realm. This is a memory inheritance that appeared continuously after Jingjing and I cultivated in the Vermillion Bird’s bloodline." Dongfang Xinyue said: "I feel that the source of this great river in front of us is very likely the entrance to the Sacred Water Heavenly Realm. Although the Vermillion Bird is a fire-attributed Holy Beast, she needs a lot of life energy.
