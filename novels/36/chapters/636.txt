Fan Yakun dared to dig his ancestor’s grave. He was forced to participate in it, so he wasn’t in the least upset. But now that he had committed a heavy crime, this was the only way for him to reduce his crimes. He had no choice but to bite the bullet.

Suddenly, a burst of intense purple light shone, that kind of light seemed to pierce through people’s bodies, wave after wave of scorching power drilled into their bodies, it was extremely uncomfortable, but Chen Xiang was completely fine.

"The firestone ball cracked, let’s change it!" An old man exclaimed, "Lin Xiyi, pass!"

This shocked everyone present, because this was actually a woman who possessed such a powerful flame. One look at her and they could tell that this was a purple Fire Soul.

"Lin Xiyi, I think it’s that big sister Lin Yushi. The Lin Family inside are really all good seedlings. Although that Lin Yushi is a little hateful, but his strength is very strong." Fan Yakun looked at Chen Xiang and chuckled: "But the dog head was still chopped off by someone."

The surname ’Lin’, and the flame was so fierce, everyone quickly realized that this was someone from the Chaotic Mountain!

Finally, it was Fan Yakun’s turn.

"What name?" An old man asked indifferently.

"Fan Yakun!"

The old man immediately widened his eyes and laughed: "So it’s the brat that dug up Fan Family’s ancestral grave, I never thought that you would be able to come here alive, what is inside the ancestral grave? Is it worth it for you to go all out like that? "

Fan Yakun laughed: "I only have a broken array disc and a divine sword. I used that array disc to stroll around the Heaven Realm and returned the divine sword back, so I could keep my life!"

Amongst the higher ups of the powers, Fan Yakun could be considered a nobody now, many of the old guys were shocked when they heard that he had dug up Fan Family’s ancestral grave.

When the old man heard that there was a divine sword, his face paled even more in shock.

"Little guy, let’s begin the test. Let me remind you, you have to use all your strength from the start. Otherwise, you won’t be able to pass the test if the ball doesn’t light up after some time." The old man said.

Fan Yakun pressed his hand on the stone orb and ferociously poured in the fire attribute Innate Qi. Seeing the stone orb, he immediately saw a type of black light, shocking everyone, even Chen Xiang was shocked, it was actually black flames.

"No wonder the Fan Family didn’t do anything to you. So it turns out that you obtained your ancestor’s Nether Fire Soul, a Fire Soul that is even stronger than the purple Fire Soul!" The old man sighed in admiration, while the stone orb was already more than half shattered.

This was the first time Chen Xiang had heard of the Nether Fire Soul, and Su Meiyao, Bai Youyou, and the others were also one.

"Hehe, did I pass?" Fan Yakun asked with a smile.

"Of course, next." The old man shouted, while recording Fan Yakun’s passing.

When it was Chen Xiang’s turn, the old man asked indifferently: "Speak your name."

"Chen Xiang!"

Chen Xiang smiled faintly, but Fan Yakun did not leave immediately. He was sure that Chen Xiang had the Fire Soul, but he had to see what it was, because under normal circumstances, it could hide the color of the flames, but he could not test it on the stone orb.

The old man was startled and looked at Chen Xiang in disbelief: "You actually dare to come back?!"

"Why would I not dare?" Chen Xiang helplessly spread his hands: "Why does everyone ask me that!"

The old man curled his lips and said: "You took two Chaos fire and killed Guo Huaqing, the Chaotic Mountain’s Sentencing Elder, yet you still dare to participate in the pill refining competition with such a high profile. You’re simply walking into a trap."

When Chen Xiang was participating in the high-levelled trade fair, the people there did not leak news of Chen Xiang’s return. It could be seen that those old fellows still had their principles.

"If I was afraid, I wouldn’t have come back to participate. But then again, what exactly is your Sacred Dan School’s reward? I took the risk of coming back to participate in the tournament just for that thing, don’t make me come here for nothing! " Chen Xiang laughed.

"When the next round starts, Leader will announce it. Let’s begin the test!" The old man could tell from one look that Chen Xiang and Fan Yakun’s relationship was very good, if not there would be no laughing to it.

"I didn’t expect you to know how to refine pills. It’s such a pity that your City Lord wife didn’t come!" Remember to use all your strength to start the test. " The old man reminded him again.

The matter of Chen Xiang returning to participate in the competition, had instantly spread out. Some of the people from the Chaotic Mountain that were hidden amongst the crowd hurriedly reported it, they did not dare to grab Chen Xiang alone, even he and Guo Huaqing were killed, let alone them.

Chen Xiang rubbed his hands together, he also wanted to see what the results of the Heaven fire soul test would be like, and what kind of light it would give.

He pressed both hands on the stone orb and activated Genuine qi of universe, urging the Heaven fire s to pour into the stone orb. A burst of fiery light suddenly burst out, but suddenly disappeared, which was unexpected, because under normal circumstances, the light would continue for a period of time.

Those who saw Chen Xiang’s test at close range all had their mouths agape, staring at the white powder in Chen Xiang’s hands!

The most powerful test would at most cause the stone orb to split open, but the stone orb Chen Xiang was testing had turned into a fine white powder, which showed that it was much stronger than the people who destroyed the stone orb.

"This ..."

He understood very well that this kind of stone orb was not a test of how strong the fire was. Even if a person from Nirvana Stage were to take the test, no matter how strong the fire was, it would not be able to crack the stone orb without the Fire Soul.

This kind of stone orb was specifically used to test the quality, potential and other factors of a Alchemist’s flame. The fact that this stone orb could turn into powder in an instant meant that Chen Xiang’s flame had an extremely great potential, and the quality was also very high, even higher than those with purple Fire Soul s!

"Tong ..." "Pass!" The old man was still shocked. However, he was just shocked at how strong Chen Xiang’s flames were, because that didn’t mean concocting pills was enough.

Seeing that Chen Xiang had such a powerful flame, Fan Yakun shook his head and laughed, "I had originally thought that after I fused with the Netherworld Fire Soul, I would have a slight chance of winning, but now it seems ..." 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

"Brother Fan, don’t be modest!" Chen Xiang laughed.

Fan Yakun had fought with Chen Xiang before, so he was very clear about Chen Xiang’s skill in pill refining. In his opinion, among the young generation of the Sacred Dan Realm, there weren’t many who could match him.

"Let’s go. We have to wait for the end of the exam and begin the second round. That’s the true start of the alchemy competition." Fan Yakun patted Chen Xiang’s shoulder.

After Chen Xiang and Fan Yakun arrived, the three men and one woman suddenly walked towards them with vicious expressions. Chen Xiang did not even need to think to know that the four people were definitely from the Chaotic Mountain.

Fan Yakun smiled from the side: "Brother Shen, this is a competition for pill refining. If you want to participate in it to the end, you will have to endure it later!"

"Let’s see what happens. If these guys provoke me, I will chop them into pieces even if I have to forfeit the competition!" Chen Xiang clenched his fists and looked at the few people walking towards him coldly.
