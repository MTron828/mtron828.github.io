Chapter 504 Thoughts of Women Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Xue Xianxian suddenly felt a great pressure. She was the first wife, but later on, Chen Xiang hooked up with her master. At the same time, he also had Hua Xiangyue as his maid.

Thinking of this, Xue Xianxian couldn’t help but admire Chen Xiang’s tactics. Although she felt very puzzled about the matter with Hua Xiangyue, after she heard how powerful the master-servant contract was, she firmly believed that Hua Xiangyue wouldn’t be able to use any tricks. She was very worried of the wellbeing of Chen Xiang. However, with secret support of two formidable women, namely Liu Menger and Hua Xiangyue, he did not need to fear even some strong powers.

Chen Xiang didn’t know that Xue Xianxian was thinking about a long-term plan. He did not disturb her as he saw that Xue Xianxian was deep in thought. He just held her in his arms and waited for her to speak. He did not dare to speak anything loud, only in a worry that his words would make Xue Xianxian angry.

“Master is very kind to me, so I can only accept the fact.” Xue Xianxian sighed.

Chen Xiang curled up the corner of his mouth curled up slightly, but he suddenly felt a pain in his waist. Xue Xianxian firmly pinched his waist and said, “you little rascal, are you thinking about the matter of taking in both the master and the disciple? No wonder master always calls you like this. It seems that you have done a lot of bad things to her... What a poor master!"

“How could I? I was very kind to sister Menger.” Chen Xiang quibbled.

“Even a ghost wouldn’t believe you.” Xue Xian grunted, while Chen Xiang once again extended his hand deeply into her clothes. She struggled for a moment before letting out a soft snort, allowing Chen Xiang to do whatever he wanted.

“Yours are about the same size as that of Menger, hah.” Chen Xiang smiled mischievously.

This caused Xue Xianxian to pout coquettishly, “darling Xiang, have you done that with master yet?” Xue Xianxian blushed hen she was finished.

“Which one?” Chen Xiang knew but still asked.

“Just that thing, the...” Xue Xianxian’s voice was as thin as that of a mosquito. Her face was as red as a ripe apple, causing Chen Xiang to be unable to help but pinch it.

“Heh heh, not really.” As Chen Xiang spoke, he pulled back the lapels of Xue Xianxian’s clothes, after which her pair of bewitching “white rabbits” abruptly jumped out. Seeing this, Chen Xiang’s mouth went dry and his soul flew out to the nine heavens; this was the first time he saw Xue Xianxian’s chest and his heart almost stopped beating.

“How beautiful they are!” Chen Xiang sighed in admiration. Just as he was about to lower his head to kiss her tits, Xue Xianxian also wished that Chen Xiang would do something to her.

At this moment, Leng Youlan knocked on the door, “brother, sister Xianxian, master is here!”

Liu Menger was here! The message scared so much Chen Xiang that his raised penis suddenly grew soft. Infatuated Xue Xianxian hurriedly jumped out of Chen Xiang’s embrace and tidied up her clothes.

“Sister Menger, really, she did not have a good timing to come.” Chen Xiang grumbled under his breath.

“Darling Xiang, master definitely has something important to attend to, because she told us that she was preparing to undergo the Nirvana Tribulation. She has been preoccupied all this time! You said earlier that her power has increased greatly. It seems that she has not been prepared to transcend the tribulation yet.” Xue Xianxian said.

“Doesn’t she know how to suppress her cultivation? That’s what a lot of old guys do!” Chen Xiang sighed.

“Darling Xiang, don’t you know that it takes a huge price to suppress one’s cultivation to avoid Nirvana Tribulation? Many people choose not to take that step because of this. Moreover, the power of the Nirvana Tribulation will be even greater if they do that. It can be said that once you retreat once, you will have no more chance of surviving the tribulation in the future.” Xue Xianxian said. Improvement of Liu Menger’s cultivation was too fast. Even if she didn’t undergo the tribulation, she would still have to suppress her cultivation. This was indeed a dilemma.

Chen Xiang walked over to open the door, while Xue Xian hurriedly grabbed Chen Xiang’s hand, “Darling Xiang, just wait for master to pass the Nirvana Tribulation, then you tell her what you’ve already confessed to me. I don’t want to make her think too much about this matter! Although she is my master, she is also a woman. I am afraid that she will be distracted. "

Xue Xianxian’s kindness touched Chen Xiang a lot, “got it!"

“Darling Xiang, do you have more medicinal gradients of the Life Retrieving Dan?” Xue Xianxian asked in a worry. Although she didn’t concoct Dan, she still had some understanding of such precious medicinal ingredients.

Chen Xiang laughed, “I still have ten more doses. I’ll give them all to her!”

“What? Why you have so much of them!”

Xue Xianxian shouted lightly while she was totally excited in her face. At this moment, she began to understand why Liu Menger’s heart was captured by Chen Xiang. Indeed, he was very capable in this area. No matter how strong a woman was, she still wanted to find a man to rely on. Although Chen Xiang was not strong, he was like a big tree, protecting Liu Menger from the wind and rain.

“Master, I think they’re still dressing up inside! I heard from Uncle Ma in the city that when the couple gather together, they usually strip naked and roll on the bed. What kind of custom is this?” Leng Youlan asked. She didn’t know anything about men and women and didn’t have the interest to know.

“Stupid girl, you will understand after you have a man in the future!” Liu Menger laughed and said.

“I don’t want a man. A brother is enough for me!” Leng Youlan immediately said.

“Your brother is a bad guy.” Liu Menger mumbled to herself. Her mind was twisted. She knew that the white-haired beauty, Leng Youlan, looked fierce and overbearing, but she did need someone to take care of her at times.

When Chen Xiang and Xue Xianxian came out, Liu Menger furtively felt jealous as she saw that their clothes were disheveled and their faces were full of joys. She found that Leng Youlan was right; perhaps Chen Xiang and Xue Xianxian re-united naked in bed.

“Sister Menger!”

“Master!”

Liu Menger let out a soft snort, then she spoke in a soft voice, “I just come to see how you are doing here, and what you learned. I’m going into a closed door cultivation for a period of time. It might take a couple of years.”

"We’re fine, but those damned martial arts are too hard to learn! In the future, brother will also live here and he can take care of us. Sister master, don’t worry about us. Just focus on your closed-door cultivation.” Leng Youlan responded with a smile. In front of her acquaintances, she was just like a cute and ignorant little girl, very pleasing to the eyes.

Liu Menger lovingly stroked her strange white hair and said with a smile, “Youlan, in the future, you have to listen to Xianxian. Don’t cause trouble everywhere!”

“Got it, master!” Leng Youlan held onto Liu Menger’s arm. They two looked like sisters.

At this time, Liu Menger turned to Chen Xiang and said, “Chen Xiang, I have something to tell you. In this period of time, I am going to leave Youlan and Xianxian to you. There are some things I need to enjoin you.”

Very tactfully, Xue Xianxian pulled Leng Youlan away and went outside to compete in martial arts.

Chen Xiang hurriedly handed over a storage bag to Liu Menger, “those are medicinal ingredients of Life Retrieving Dan. After a while, I will go find my master and ask him about your tribulation."

Liu Menger didn’t expect that Chen Xiang would have gradients of Life Retrieving Dan with him. When she took a look, she realized that there were actually ten doses of them! She had originally been disheartened by the tribulation, but now she was brimming with confidence.

“Thank you! Take good care of these two girls. If you need to find me, then go to the place in which the succubus Hua Xiangyue conducts closed-door cultivation! I will let her help me concoct Dan. I thought I would have to stay at this stage forever.” Liu Menger said in a low voice as she gratefully looked at Chen Xiang.

Chen Xiang smiled, “OK, I understand! Just focus on your preparation for the tribulation. At that time, I will have a lot of things that need your help."

Liu Menger kissed Chen Xiang lips, then walked out to enjoin Xue Xianxian and Leng Youlan before leaving.
