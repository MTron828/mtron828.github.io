Ji Ling’er used up four hundred thousand kilograms of Holy stone. In the eyes of this middle-aged man, it was considered very extravagant, because normally, saints would take a hundred years to gather a hundred thousand kilograms of Holy stone, and quicker ones would take several decades.

Chen Xiang knew that Ji Ling’er had bought them for Su Meiyao. In the future, he could bring them out to shop, and he wasn’t afraid of danger at all. This made him feel very grateful.

Ji Ling’er knew that Chen Xiang could earn a lot of Holy stone s in the future, which was why she was so straightforward.

In truth, the Heaven Sacred District was only the Rich District. Anyone who could enter here did not care about the hundred thousand jin Holy stone, and there was of course a small portion of people who entered in order to avoid the powerful enemies.

"Most of the things here are very expensive. Back then, I worked hard here for a long time, but I only managed to create a very small cave." Ji Ling’er brought Chen Xiang and walked towards the large mountain in the distance.

She saw Chen Xiang’s strange expression and explained: "You should be able to see that there are many mountains in Heaven Sacred District, and there are also many caves there. Even if it’s for us poor people, it would be very safe inside those caves, don’t worry."

Chen Xiang looked at the tall and big stone buildings that rose from the ground in the middle of the Heaven Sacred District. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

"That place." Chen Xiang asked.

"Don’t even think about it, that place is outrageously expensive. Buying a room would cost several tens of thousands of kilograms of Holy stone. Some of the more expensive houses might not be able to buy them without hundreds of millions of kilograms of Holy stone." Ji Ling’er lamented.

Chen Xiang was a little confused: "These things are so expensive, then why would your Ji Clan be angry over those three million Holy stone? For a large clan, there is no shortage of these Holy stone."

Ji Ling’er led Chen Xiang towards the large mountain and explained: "Ji Clan can only earn a few tens of millions of kilograms of Holy stone every hundred years, and it still needs a large group of people to raise and maintain many array formations and barriers, and it itself also needs to be accessed a bit, so three hundred Holy stone s are still very important to Ji Clan. It’s equivalent to him being taken away by a few million kilograms of Holy stone for a hundred years, do you think they would be in a hurry?"

Chen Xiang nodded. "So your Ji Clan can’t even be considered a great clan of Tiandu after all."

Ji Ling’er sneered: "If it wasn’t for the wealth of those old fellows’ descendants, our Ji Clan must have an estate here. In these past few tens of thousands of years, it was those little brats who had tormented Ji Clan to such an extent, yet they were so harsh on me."

"And thanks to my own hard work, I managed to get myself ranked twelve on the Saintess’ List. If Ji Clan had been willing to support me behind my back, I would not have had a problem getting in the top three." Ji Ling’er’s voice was filled with resentment.

Chen Xiang laughed: "Seems like you also want to enter the Saintess’ List, your father is the patriarch of the Ji Clan, why doesn’t he help you?"

Ji Ling’er sighed: "Don’t mention it, he’s not going to speak alone. He wants all the elders to agree, but there are only a few elders on my father’s side, so it’s useless."

"Hmph!" She snorted unwillingly: "Originally, I was the worst amongst the group of Holy Maiden, and was even wanted by the Ji Clan. Those Holy Maiden all had the support of a large clan, and most of them are in the most luxurious area of the Heaven Sacred District, while I can only live in the cave."

"I have to see the people from the Heaven Sacred District to choose a Holy Maiden, so I don’t have a chance."

Chen Xiang chuckled: "You previously said that you don’t care about the Holy Maiden, so it turns out that you care a lot, but I didn’t expect that you would have to use your father for the Holy Maiden selection, it wasn’t really that big of a deal."

Ji Ling’er snorted: "I don’t care, but I originally wanted to bring honor to the Ji Clan, who would have thought that by sticking close to a cold butt, I would be met with the supercilious looks of all the elders. More than half of their sons are doing well in the Heaven Sacred District, buying many businesses, only then are they getting these Holy stone s that have secretly taken over the Ji Clan."

Now, Chen Xiang more clearly understood why Ji Ling’er had deviated from the Ji Clan. Moreover, it was a very good opportunity, and the development now was even better than what she had imagined.

Chen Xiang followed her to the stone mountain, and came to the front of a cave. She took out a jade key, and opened the cave’s stone door, releasing some restrictions, and brought Chen Xiang in.

This cave dwelling was beyond Chen Xiang’s expectations, better than he had imagined. In the center was an exquisite little hall, with two doors at the side. There were two stone rooms inside, one for the bedroom, and the other for the training room.

"How much did you buy here?" Chen Xiang looked at the large luminous pearl at the center of the hall and said with a smile, "Not bad."

"I bought it with eighty thousand kilograms of Holy stone." Ji Ling’er laughed and said: "If you are willing to, before long, we can buy a luxurious house in the central region."

Chen Xiang curled his lips: "Is there any use in buying those things? It’s more important to raise my strength, moreover, I still have a lot of things to do in Nine Heaven World."

"It’s not that much of a use, but there’s a sense of superiority in that place. Think carefully, there really isn’t any need for that." Ji Ling’er giggled: "If you have a large number of Holy stone, it would be more useful to buy high quality immortal pills. With absolute strength, you shouldn’t be afraid of others looking down on you."

Chen Xiang bent down and laughed: "With absolute strength, you will not even be afraid of your enemies in Heaven Sacred District, and that will be very fun."

"That’s asking to die."

When Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou came out of the ring, Ji Ling’er gave them the two bronze tags so that they could fuse and drip blood.

"Meiyao, you guys follow me, I will buy some pretty clothes for you guys." Ji Ling’er pulled Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou, and was about to leave the cave.

Chen Xiang anxiously shouted: "Is this really alright, I’m a bit worried."

Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou never left Chen Xiang’s side, which made him extremely worried.

"Then don’t concoct pills, just come with us. If something happens, just hide them." Ji Ling’er said.

Just like that, Chen Xiang followed the three girls to the Heaven Sacred District, where they rented a carriage. Chen Xiang was in charge of driving the carriage, and the three girls were chatting inside.

It had been a long time since they last went out for a stroll, and furthermore, they were in a place with a forest of experts. Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou who did not have any strength were still a little worried, but they believed in Ji Ling’er’s strength.

When they came out to take a breath of fresh air, Chen Xiang was also very happy.

The horse carriage stopped outside of the city. No one was allowed to enter on this type of carriage. They could only walk or ride the required flying magical equipment.

In order to prevent trouble, Su Meiyao and the other two girls had disguised themselves to make themselves less conspicuous, while Chen Xiang, dressed as his follower, followed behind the three girls leisurely.

In order to take into account Chen Xiang’s feelings, Ji Ling’er planned to first bring Chen Xiang to the medicine store to see if he could buy any Grade Two Immortal Yuling bamboo shoots.
