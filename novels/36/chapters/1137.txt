"What?" You have that many Heaven Earth Killing Method s? " The Super Old Fire Beast was shocked, he shook his head: "I cannot tell you, although you have obtained a lot of Qi Shi’s things, it does not mean that you will be told."

Chen Xiang suddenly decided to reveal the matter of the ice dragon trapping him, making him angry.

"I’ve seen an ice dragon. In the Sacred Dan Realm, he made a bunch of Ice dragon sword and left them for a human clan there. His name is Long family!" Chen Xiang suddenly said.

Sure enough, the Super Old Fire Beast became excited. "And then?"

"Then it was gone!" Chen Xiang said as his mouth twitched.

The Super Old Fire Beast was enraged, and grabbed Chen Xiang by the collar: "Brat, tell me honestly!"

Chen Xiang shook his head: "I won’t say, if I say it out loud, you will kill me."

"How could I possibly kill you? "Although you, little bastard, took away the Spirit Crystal, you are still my benefactor!" The Super Old Fire Beast immediately let Chen Xiang go.

"Since I’m your benefactor, why didn’t you tell me the whereabouts of the other Heaven Earth Killing Method s?" Chen Xiang was very unhappy in his heart, although he had stolen the treasure that the Super Old Fire Beast had been eyeing for many years.

"You’ve already obtained the mind crystal, how do you want me to repay you?" The Super Old Fire Beast was instantly enraged.

"Is that what I deserve? If you have the ability, why didn’t you take it away previously? Then I had to use a lot of effort to get to the tree hole, break through the thick ice, destroy the formation, and then drill the geocentric crystal into my body. It would be hard for me to get it even if I don’t want to. " Chen Xiang laughed, "How about we make an exchange? I know where the ice dragon is. I also know why you hate the ice dragon so much!"

Super Old Fire Beast laughed out loud: "Because I was trapped in the past, that’s why I made the deal with you, human brat! Don’t you know that the Ice Dragon and this Seat are good friends? I only sought him out to vent my anger, not to treat him as my enemy. Do you think that you can make me reveal the place where Qi Shi hid his skills? "

"Qi Shi is a good friend of mine. Without his permission, I will definitely not reveal the location of his hidden technique, unless he comes back to life and nods his head in front of me."

The Super Old Fire Beast’s words were extremely firm, causing Chen Xiang to groan softly, "The Ice Dragon told me before that it was because he did something else that he forgot to release you, which was why you were trapped in that place for so long! If I didn’t mention it, he wouldn’t even have thought of this! "

"What?" Because he forgot? This heartless bug, it’s my fault for treating him as a brother! " The Super Old Fire Beast was enraged: "It is because of this damn bug that I have been trapped for so long. I will definitely teach it a lesson!"

It was because the ice dragon had told him that it would release him, but it had not, in all these years and its relationship with the ice dragon was also very good, so in the end, he believed that the ice dragon had only let him out because it was dead.

But now, Chen Xiang had let him know an accepted reality, and he definitely did not doubt it, because it was not the first time the ice dragon had forgotten something important.

"Don’t mention what I said, I still have many things to attend to. Goodbye!" Chen Xiang stood up, patted his butt, and was about to fly out of the cave, but he was stopped by the Super Old Fire Beast.

"Brat, quickly tell me where the dead insects are!" The Super Old Fire Beast asked loudly.

"I don’t know!" Chen Xiang spread his hands.

"Hmph, I can tell you where Qi Shi is hiding, but if you die there, don’t blame me for it." The Super Old Fire Beast said.

Didn’t you say that you wanted the Ten Heavens Supreme Lord to revive? Chen Xiang’s face was filled with disbelief.

"Brat, hurry up and tell us where those dead insects are!" The Super Old Fire Beast glared at him.

"You have to tell me where the other Heaven Earth Killing Method s are." Chen Xiang was not so easily deceived.

"Do I look like the type of person who would brag? Would I lie to you, little brat? " The Super Old Fire Beast was furious, it wanted to teach this damn little brat a lesson.

"Just now, you were just bragging. You said that you would never tell me, but now you’re saying that you can." Chen Xiang curled his lips and said: "If you tell me first, if I don’t tell you, or if I lie to you, you can kill me!"

"But if you go back on your word, I won’t be able to do anything to you, so it would be more fair if you said it first."

The Super Old Fire Beast took a deep breath and said: "In the Sacred Beasts Ancient Realm, I only know that this place is hiding the Beast Slain Method, which is where Qi Shi and I were born. I also don’t know what’s happening inside, if you guys still have a lot of beasts, then you guys are pretty strong, so this place should still be Di Tian!"

"I’m not sure where the split Di Tian will combine again, go and find out for yourself!" Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Chen Xiang did not expect Di Tian to have such a place. After remembering the name, he said, "The Ice Dragon said that the place he is currently at is very powerful. He said that he was doing very poorly at that place.

"This fellow actually went to that place. No wonder. This Seat understands. Goodbye!" The Super Old Fire Beast flew out of the cave, and saw a huge black hole appear in front of him.

"Sacred Beasts Ancient Realm, do you know where it is?" Chen Xiang asked the three women inside the ring.

"I don’t know. This is Di Tian’s matter, we don’t know." Bai Youyou sighed.

Chen Xiang felt that the White Tiger would definitely know. When he had time, he would ask around, if he was still at Di Tian, he would have to get it before he ascended.

After leaving this place, Chen Xiang came to the Divine Weapons Heavenly Country. Previously, he had planned to spend a period of time with Xue Xianxian and see if she needed any help.

However, looking at the speed of Xue Xianxian’s growth, she wouldn’t be able to stay in Di Tian for too long. With the appearance of Di Tian, her resources had also become richer, so the new generation’s seedlings’ abilities had increased very quickly. They weren’t as difficult as those old fellows from before.

Chen Xiang took the special command medallion that Liu Meng’er had given him and entered the Divine Weapons Heavenly Country’s Imperial Palace. Xue Xianxian stayed at his previous residence, but what surprised him was that Leng Youlan was also present.

A violent woman like Leng Youlan was actually able to quietly sit there and focus on researching formations and refining tools, making Chen Xiang think that he was seeing things.

Chen Xiang quietly came to the lawn of the courtyard and stood by the side to watch carefully. Watching Leng Youlan meticulously depict those incomparably complex Spirit grain, he couldn’t help but sigh in his heart, This little sister had really grown up.
