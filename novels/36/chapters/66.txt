Chapter 67: Martial Spirit

Translated by: Ash

Edited By: iballisticbunny, TheNo1Fan

Chen Xiang set fire to Song Nanming and the others to incinerate their bodies. But what made him surprised was that although the fire reduced them to ash, two Chi long golden bands of light remained.

[TLN: 1 Chi= ⅓ m]

“What is that?” Chen Xiang said, with uncertainty, and then consulted Bao Youyou and Su Meiyao.

Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou, who were both wearing a black hood, came out of the storage ring. They wore these outfits so no one would be able to see their appearances.

”It is a Martial Spirit?” In Bai Youyou’s ice cold voice, a sliver of surprise could be heard.

Su Meiyao leaned down and stroked it with her head, saying with certainty: “Yes, they are Martial Spirits!”

“What is a Martial Spirit? Chen Xiang had never heard of such a thing.

“This thing has a unique property, what it is specifically is unclear. Anyway, it is bred out from True Qi, produced by heaven and earth. If it is an ice martial spirit and fuses with your arm, even fire attributed True Qi, after passing through the ice martial spirit, will become ice cold True Qi.” said Su Meiyao.

Chen Xiang was surprised “So you’re saying if someone who cannot release fire True Qi integrates a fire Marital Spirit into their arm, then they could very well be able to release fire True Qi?”

Bai Youyou said “Yes. So any Martial Spirit is very valuable and it is also why we cannot tell what attribute this Martial Spirit has.”

Chen Xiang just heard about this mystical resource for the first time, which shows just how rare it was. But then why would Song Nanming have it?

“Having a Martial Spirit might not make much sense to you because you are able to freely release the five elements of True Qi, but you should keep it to sell later. You should be able to exchange it for a lot of good resources.” Su Meiyao got out a small jade bottle and using the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise] sucked in the Martial Spirit.

Chen Xiang flew up towards Freewind Mountain. Killing Song Nanming not only gave him the [Exterminating Dragon Divine Exercise] but also the Martial Spirits. This harvest can be considered to be very big.

Using his divine sense Chen Xiang asked Su Meiyao who was inside the ring “Sister Meiyao, can you talk about these martial spirit things with me? Is it really irrelevant and useless for me?”

Su Meiyao said “Of course not, there are many different types of martial spirits. In addition to the primary elemental martial spirits, there are also beast martial spirits that have been congealed out by demon beasts, which is equally rare. The kind which is most useful to you would be a fire martial spirit! It is able to change the very nature of the flames, allowing them to have a wide variety of properties which is very helpful to alchemists.

“Fire spirits are very rare. I only know that my teacher has one and has never seen anyone else have it, but only heard rumors that several strong individuals have one.”

Chen Xiang is secretly shocked. He heard from Su Meiyao’s mouth that people who have this fire Martial Spirit are one of those extremely strong experts!

Freewind Mountain, although not very high, is still a very big stone mountain. At the highest point, many houses are constructed, and above the hilltop there was a majestic palace hall. Chen Xiang did not expect that in such a place there will actually be a gathering of the black forces at such a large scale.

Chen Xiang admired his father, who with only the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, actually dared to solo rush into the large dark forces and also killed a lot of their important members.

At the foot of the mountain, due to the pervious rush by Chen Tianhu, many people are patrolling. This Freewind Mountain is way more heavily guarded, but that doesn’t matter to Chen Xiang. His father had previously beheaded many high-level members, so he was much more relaxed.

Chen Xiang already knew that the Jiudu Gang is very formidable and that they used all kinds of hidden weapons laced with poison. As long as he took the proper precautions against them, he simply had nothing to fear from this Jiudu Gang.

Before, Chen Xiang was attacked from all sides by thousands of hidden weapons. Yet all of them didn’t even matter to him, those hidden weapons are not even slightly effective against him.

One Jiudu Gang member saw Chen Xiang coming out from inside the mountain forest. He immediately unsheathed the sword on his waist, shouting “Who is it!?”

“Chen Xiang!”

When the Jiudu Gang members saw this handsome teenager burst out a mesmerizing Slaughter Qi while he spoke, they could not help but be alarmed. They had no doubt that this teenage is the rumoured Chen Xiang!

[EDN:No shit sherlock, he just shouted out his name.]

Chen Xiang’s eyes, containing immense amounts of Slaughter Qi, swept through the group. Suddenly those Jiudu Gang Members waved both of their arms quickly as numerous steel needles of varying sizes flew out from their hands. Under the illumination of the sunlight, they all flashed with an intermittent cold aura.

Just as Chen Xiang expected, most of the Jiudu Gang members used hidden weapons. If it was any ordinary martial artist, they would have difficulty guarding against these attacks and would be easily killed by these people.

But for Chen Xiang, this simply did not pose that much of a threat. His eyebrows just simply rose while hot aura Qi surged out from his body, forming a shield that wrapped around his body. These steel needles were stopped in their tracks by the shield.

Chen Xiang, watching the sharp steel needles, coldly smiled and emitted a powerful divine sense. This in turn, controlled those countless steel needles, making them turn around right back onto those Jiudu Gang members.

“Creating all these steel needles shouldn’t be that easy right? Here, I’ll return them all back to you!” Chen Xiang sneered as the countless steel needles fell like a rainstorm towards the Jiudu Gang members.

The Jiudu Gang members who weren’t able to react properly in time, easily got pierced by the countless different steel needles, resembling a human hedgehog.

Afterwards, Chen Xiang saw a scalp-tingling scene. Not far from him, those 40 to 50 people, after being pierced by their steel needles, suddenly turned black. These people emitted the most miserable screams as their bodies slowly melted turning into a black pool of blood.

This blood is full of poison as not just their bodies but even their clothes weren’t spared as they melted. Slowly the stones besides them and even those steel needles disappeared, showing just how terrible this poision is.

“This Jiudu Gang cannot be allowed to remain!” Chen Xiang said with a frown. He released a large amount of flames incinerating the poison blood, then started flying towards the hilltop.

Just a moment ago, when Chen Xiang and the Jiudu Gang members acted, the intermittent rings of bells came from the hilltop. Chen Xiang knew he has been discovered, but he still ran towards the hilltop.

Arriving at the top of the hill, surprisingly, there was no one there. When he entered the majestic palace hall, he saw a person covered in a full black robe inside the luxurious large hall. But suddenly behind this figure, appeared a large crowd that surrounded him. Their numbers could only be counted in the thousands.

“Is your father dead!?” One white haired, dwarf, ugly old man came out, in a very ugly voice asked. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

[TLN: What the hell everything about him is ugly. LOL:)]

“Nope, alive and well!” Chen Xiang calmly replied, which made the ugly dwarf old man’s eye fiercely shoot open. Chen Xiang determined this old man should be the Jiudu Gang Chief.

“Humph, in that case, why did you come here to die?” The Jiudu Gang Chief coldly said. When he looked at Chen xiang, there was an expression in his eyes that seemed to be looking at a dead man.

“I did not come here to die. I came here to collect your life.” Chen Xiang solemnly stated, his face and tone were completely serious.
