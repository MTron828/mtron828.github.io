When everyone saw Chen Xiang squeeze through the crowd, their eyes were firm, looking at the stage, they knew he was a challenger, so they all made way for him.

"Another one who isn’t afraid of death... "Wait a minute, judging from his aura, he seems to be a Dao-Master who has trained in two profound laws."

"Even someone at the second level of the Dao Shi realm wouldn’t be able to deal with Holy Son of Heaven Wasteland if he’s at the tenth level of the Dao Zong realm. He actually dares to go up at the second level of the Dao Shi realm."

"Was he abandoned by his wife? Or did he suffer some sort of a blow? He wants to die a little more slowly."

It was very easy to sense the aura of the Code Profound Gate, but right now, Chen Xiang was not concealing anything. He did not use his own appearance, so the people of Heaven Wasteland Aristocratic Family could not tell that he was Chen Xiang.

"Trash, hurry up. I can’t wait any longer." The Holy Son of Heaven Wasteland said coldly.

"You are the trash. Your entire family is trash. Only you are trash, so you only have trash in your eyes. Also, only trash’s parents can nurture trash like you." Chen Xiang said loudly.

His words stunned everyone. He actually dared to provoke the Holy Son of Heaven Wasteland at all costs.

The entire Holy Son of Heaven Wasteland was someone who would easily anger his opponent. Now that he had been insulted in front of so many people, and even cursed so harshly, he was momentarily unable to refute Chen Xiang’s insult, causing him to roar out in anger. His veins popped out and his appearance was extremely sinister.

"Haha ..." Chen Xiang was still below the stage, he laughed out loud: "As expected of a piece of trash, you can’t think of anything to say about me, can you?

"You ... "Hurry up and come up." The Holy Son of Heaven Wasteland was burning with rage as he roared sinisterly: "I will tear you apart bit by bit."

Those angry eyes could kill, but Chen Xiang’s face was full of smiles as he swept his gaze over them. That arrogant gaze seemed to be telling them that "The people from your Heaven Wasteland Aristocratic Family are all trash."

Chen Xiang had finally reached the stage, and just as he went up, the Holy Son of Heaven Wasteland suddenly rushed over, as though he teleported.

Holy Son of Heaven Wasteland’s hand was like an eagle’s claw, reaching towards Chen Xiang’s chest, wanting to pull out Chen Xiang’s heart, but when his hand made contact with Chen Xiang’s chest, he suddenly felt a strong heat.

Everyone thought that a huge hole would appear in Chen Xiang’s chest, and blood would gush out from it afterwards.

Instead, a ball of strong flames spewed out from his chest, like a dragon spitting out flames, directly striking Holy Son of Heaven Wasteland.

Chen Xiang had only used his Fire Profound Gate just now to absorb the fire energy and did not pass through Tenfold Door. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

"Trash is quite resistant to fire." Chen Xiang sneered. He immediately used the spatial profound door to absorb the immense power of the spatial space and converted it into an extremely strong power of spatial energy through the fifth stage Tao profound Door.

"Spatial sealing." Chen Xiang used this spatial energy to seal Holy Son of Heaven Wasteland.

The originally furious Holy Son of Heaven Wasteland wanted to use his strongest power to kill Chen Xiang, but he suddenly realized that he was unable to move and was sealed by something.

Chen Xiang immediately walked over, his entire arm suddenly ignited. After the flames disappeared, his entire arm was like red-hot iron, and one could still see many golden threads in his arm, which were the flow of fire energy.

"I would quite like to see on what basis you call me trash. You can’t even defeat trash like me? Doesn’t that mean you’re not even comparable to trash?" Chen Xiang came to the front of the Holy Son of Heaven Wasteland and pressed his burning red hand on his shoulder.

"Ah!" Holy Son of Heaven Wasteland suddenly screamed. The heat was too scary, the burning pain went down to the bones.

"Hehe, that felt great, right?" At this time, Chen Xiang’s arm, which had been injected with such powerful flame energy, was like an extremely hot iron. He scratched and scratched Holy Son of Heaven Wasteland’s body, and every time he did, this Holy Son of Heaven Wasteland would let out an extremely miserable cry.

The originally arrogant disciples of the Desolate Land did not make a sound. They were very clear on the Holy Son of Heaven Wasteland’s strength, but to be able to beat him up so badly now, it could be seen how terrifying this person was. Furthermore, he was at the second level of the Dao Shi realm.

There were a lot of palm marks on Holy Son of Heaven Wasteland’s body, and they were all pressed down by Chen Xiang. Holy Son of Heaven Wasteland actually fainted several times due to the pain, but he was awakened by Chen Xiang using a mystical method, and continued to be tortured ...

The disciples of the Heaven Wasteland Aristocratic Family were all enjoying themselves, but now, their hearts were stuck. On the contrary, the others were ecstatic to see the arrogant Holy Son of Heaven Wasteland being tormented like this, it was like turning the sky upside down.

"Brat, the old guy from Heaven Wasteland Aristocratic Family is here, hurry up and make your move." The Great Landlord was also enjoying the show. Chen Xiang’s strength was even more terrifying than he had imagined, he felt that Chen Xiang could now fight against Dao Sovereigns.

The Heaven Wasteland Aristocratic Family was very shameless, upon learning that the older generation of the Heaven Wasteland Aristocratic Family had come out, Chen Xiang immediately used his Dao Energy to pass through the Tenfold Door, transforming into a very berserk power. His palm struck the Holy Son of Heaven Wasteland’s head, causing it to crack, followed by another Heaven Blasting Palm, causing the Holy Son of Heaven Wasteland to tremble and become a blood mist.

Thick red mist floated out from the stage, which was formed by Holy Son of Heaven Wasteland’s body. Chen Xiang blew lightly on the air, dispersing the blood mist, then patted his body. Under the dumbstruck gaze of the crowd, he walked down the stage and towards the person not far away.

No matter how arrogant he was, he was not an idiot. At this moment, he could tell that Chen Xiang was extremely scary and he felt that he was not Chen Xiang’s match. He already had the impulse to run.

When the seniors of the Heaven Wasteland Aristocratic Family arrived at the fighting arena, they saw Chen Xiang smashing Holy Son of Heaven Wasteland’s head and turning his body into a bloody mist. This was completed in an instant.

The Holy Son of Heaven Wasteland that they had painstakingly selected was killed just like that, right in front of their eyes.

"Stand here." An old man roared, his voice shaking the entire plaza. The old man of Heaven Wasteland Aristocratic Family knew that Chen Xiang was going to kill another Holy Son of Heaven Wasteland.

Chen Xiang did not stop and, as if he did not hear anything, teleported to the fighting stage.

"Why, we agreed on a match for two days and two nights, your Heaven Wasteland Aristocratic Family is shrinking." Chen Xiang laughed coldly, his voice was filled with endless ridicule and ridicule, and spread throughout the entire plaza.

The seniors of the Heaven Wasteland Aristocratic Family were also shocked. They didn’t know when such a terrifying fellow had appeared, but they knew that this person’s Tao profound Door was definitely very powerful. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have such terrifying strength.

Just as these few old fellows were about to rush over, Great Landlord suddenly appeared in front of them, laughing as he said: "My old friends, that little ghost was brought by me to cheer your Heaven Wasteland Aristocratic Family on, don’t disappoint me, let him continue to fight, maybe your other Holy Son of Heaven Wasteland is lucky, and might even be able to beat him."
