When Xiao Xianglin returned to the Dragon-Elephant School, he was being disciplined, and this time they had sneaked out, when they returned, they would definitely be strictly watched! Of course, Chen Xiang had the dimensional array inside the Six Realms mirrors, it would not be easy to trap him.

"We really don’t need to go back now. Master, you can pass on the Dragon and Elephant Divine Arts to me, and now there’s the Tao-creation’s Incantation." Chen Xiang replied, "At most, I’ll be able to find a safe place to cultivate in when I go back."

"Forget it, let’s head back. I need to see my parents." Xiao Xianglin said: "No matter what, I have to greet them before I leave."

Xiao Xianglin felt that being together with Chen Xiang was extremely comfortable, especially for Chen Xiang, who always had a strange method up his sleeves. It was very magical, coupled with her strong power, she felt that there shouldn’t be any problems with the two of them going out adventuring.

Chen Xiang had already controlled her Six Realms mirrors to fly back to the Dragon-Elephant School. Although Xiao Xianglin’s parents were strict in their control, that was for her own good.

After a few days, Chen Xiang and Xiao Xianglin finally arrived at the main entrance of the Dragon-Elephant School.

"What happened to the door?" Xiao Xianglin saw that huge black iron door that was caved in a few times, and immediately asked the guard who guarded the door.

"Senior-apprentice Sister Xiao, someone attacked the door before, and they even fought." The guard said.

"Who will attack the door? This guy must be very strong. " Xiao Xianglin said. He thought about it, but he could not think of anyone who would have the guts to come here and cause trouble.

Chen Xiang looked around, but there were no traces of a fight.

"They fought in the sky ... I don’t know what happened, but the fact that the Leader was heavily injured was leaked, causing some scheming fellows to come over and try to take our Dragon-Elephant School down. Fortunately, the elders of our Dragon-Elephant School were strong enough to push them back. " The guard said.

"Have my parents returned yet?" Xiao Xianglin asked.

"I’m back ..." But, for some reason, they suddenly went out. " The guard said.

"Alright, I understand."

Xiao Xianglin walked and frowned as he brought Chen Xiang to quickly enter the Dragon-Elephant School, and then headed towards her parents’ house. After entering the house, an old lady walked over in panic, feeling extremely nervous.

"Aunt Cai, what’s wrong?" Xiao Xianglin immediately asked, who were Aunt Cai’s parents? She was a loyal servant, Xiao Xianglin was someone who had watched her grow up.

"Miss, you two ... You have to get out of here. " Aunt Cai said in a low voice, saying urgently, "Your parents just went out to look for you."

"Why should we leave this place as soon as possible?" Xiao Xianglin was puzzled.

"It’s a long story. Hurry up and leave, hurry up." As Aunt Cai spoke, she pushed Xiao Xianglin and Chen Xiang out of the door.

Chen Xiang and Xiao Xianglin realized that something serious had happened, and they did not have time to ask anymore. They quickly exited the room, wanting to leave the Dragon-Elephant School as soon as possible, even though they did not know what had happened yet.

As they flew over, they each had an array disc in their hands. After they landed, they threw over the array disc, and multiple array discs formed a strong seal that covered Chen Xiang and Xiao Xianglin in an instant.

"What are you guys doing?" Seeing that, Xiao Xianglin’s heart was enraged, and he shouted. She and Chen Xiang were Leader s who had saved Dragon-Elephant School, but these elders wanted to capture them.

"Xiang Luan, you don’t have to worry. We caught Chen Xiang, he has the Killing evil dragon." An elder said.

"This is what the Dragon Controlling Palace told us. They had already sensed that the Killing evil dragon was in the fifth floor, and they sent two of their Dragon Controlling Gods s to kill it. Then, Chen Xiang came to the Tao-creation Place ... He was always well-hidden before, but in the end he still exposed himself and was detected by the Dragon Controlling Palace. " 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

"The only one who came from the fifth floor of the World Defying Stage Soul River is him, and he is born with the Dragon Soul. So we are sure that he has the Killing evil dragon."

Chen Xiang recalled that when he came to Dragon-Elephant School, he had never released any Killing evil dragon, at most, he only released the Azure Dragon. However, the Azure Dragon was not a Killing evil dragon, so the aura was completely different.

Chen Xiang did not care about the Killing evil dragon, she was her disciple and she was very talented, which made her very satisfied. She knew that Chen Xiang was a secretive person, but she had been in contact with him for the past few days, so she was very clear about Chen Xiang’s character.

"He’s my disciple, I don’t care." Xiao Xianglin said in a cold voice, "You all definitely cannot touch him ... I want to see Leader. "

"Leader is already injured, he did not know about this." An elder said with a gloomy face: "This was approved by the elder of the Dragon-Elephant School."

"The reason why the Leader came back was because Chen Xiang and I saved him. Otherwise, he would have died a long time ago. We must see him." Xiao Xianglin finally understood why Aunt Cai told them to leave quickly.

"Leader cannot make this decision, because it is the Dragon-Elephant School’s Elders who are in contact with the Dragon Controlling Palace’s Elders, we, the younger generation, are only following orders." An elder said, "If you don’t leave the barrier soon, we’ll capture you as well."

"Master, you leave the barrier first! Xiang’er and Liu’er are both inside You Yao Mountain Villa, I can use their power to activate the spatial formation. You go out first and clear things up. " Chen Xiang sent a sound transmission to Xiao Xianglin and even secretly gave the Tao-creation’s Holy Crystal to him.

"Don’t worry, I will definitely protect you, whoever dares to touch you, I, Xiao Xianglin, will never stop until I die." Xiao Xianglin whispered to Chen Xiang.

Xiao Xianglin could only do this now. She would walk out of the barrier and wait for her parents to come back before thinking of a solution.

Soon after, Chen Xiang was sealed by the elders and taken away in a tower.

After Chen Xiang entered the tower, he carefully looked at it. He never thought that this tower would be so extraordinary.

"Where did this elder come from? To think that there’s such a thing." Chen Xiang’s heart went cold, it was not easy to leave right now, let alone the power of Xiang’er and Yu’er, even if Xiao Xianglin was here, it would still be difficult to pass through the Time and space power’s array.

Chen Xiang did not know how long he stayed in the tower, when he suddenly heard a few aged voices speaking to him in a daze.

"This brat has obtained a Legendary mantra, and he also has a Killing evil dragon ... So, the Legendary mantra must not be controlled by him. "

"Yes, we must work together to extract his Legendary mantra."

"He probably hasn’t grasped it yet, and he just got it not too long ago. It should be easier for him to retrieve it from his memories and extract it."

"Just do as you said ..." Hand over the Legendary mantra’s memories to me for safekeeping, and when I learn it, I’ll share with you all. "
