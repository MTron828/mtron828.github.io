Chapter 140 Can’t Explain

This chapter is the missed regular chapter of last week. Enjoy!!!

Soon Chen Xiaong saw a very high giant mountain in front of him with a spiral road leading to the top. At the peak, there were many jade cards. To his surprise, there were tens of thousands of jade cards, completely covering the flat peak.

In just half an hour or so, Chen Xiang had arrived at the peak. He picked up a jade card before quickly returning to the Extreme Martial Sect. He just instantly obtained a hundred True Elemental Dan and a hundred thousand crystal stones so easily, and when he thought about the whole situation, he found it funny.

On his way down, Chen Xiang didn’t forget to infuriate that rushing and profusely sweating crowd of people below him. Of course, he was once again cursed loudly by many of them, and there were also many things thrown at him, but just like before, none of it hit him.

After an hour or so, Chen Xiang returned to the Extreme Martial Sect and handed over the jade card to Wu Kaiming.

Chen Xiang grinned and said, "I didn’t cheat!"

"You brat, you’re very cunning!" Wu Kaiming said with a bitter smile. At this time on the square, only Yun Xiaodao, Zhu Rong and Xu Weilong were waiting for Chen Xiang’s return.

Chen Xiang’s way of winning got him cursed, but he had truly not broken any rules. The only thing that could be said was that the race rules weren’t perfect, after all, the Extreme Martial Sect’s old codger simply had not expected a Mortal Martial Realm disciple to have True Qi Wings, a type of extremely rare and powerful martial skill. Since Chen Xiang’s return, all the way to his participation in the Extreme Martial Grand Tournament, no one had thought of his True Qi wings.

Wu Kaiming gave Chen Xiang a jade box filled with True Qi Dan along with a storage pouch filled with a hundred thousand crystal stones. However, Chen Xiang was not planning to take the heat and give it all to Zhu Rong. This is what he owed for getting those Building Foundations Dans, a hundred True Elemental Dan worth five hundred thousand crystal stones along with another hundred thousand crystal stones. All in all, he now paid back the six hundred thousand crystal stones to Zhu Rong, clearing his entire debt.

“Younger brother Chen, isn’t it your turn now to take us out for a treat?” Zhu Rong said with sinister laugh.

Chen Xiang scoffed and retorted, “Fatty, I think it should rightfully be your treat. After all, my hard-earned reward is all in your hands.”

Yun Xiaodao and the others stared at Chen Xiang with contempt in their eyes, you dare call this hard earned? This was simply playing with them, those who were actually working hard were still on the road. Everybody reckoned Chen Xiang had just woken up and came here to participate.

After talking some nonsense with Yun Xiaodao and the group for a while, Chen Xiang returned to the Extreme Dan King Courtyard and irrigated the Azure Profound Tree. He also noticed that Wu Qianqian and Elder Dan weren’t here.

These days, Chen Xiang also got notifications from Icewind Valley and the Divine Weapon Heavenly Empire, saying they were still undergoing training so he was unable to contact either Xue Xianxian or Leng Youlan.

For a very long time, Xue Xianxian had entered the True Martial Realm. Chen Xiang had decided he would look for her after he had achieved the True Martial Realm, however, he was still unable to contact her and this made him very worried.

The race had finally ended. When they returned, many people laid down from exhaustion in the square. Some could still stand and they were all cursing Chen Xiang. Actually, curses were filling the entire Extreme Martial Sect because Chen Xiang easily got first place. He didn’t even have to expend as much force as he needed to blow off some soot yet he got such a huge reward, who would not envy him to death?

Chen Xiang was currently resting in the Extreme Dan King Courtyard and preparing for the Alchemy Competition which was going to be held tomorrow. Only a few people had actually signed up for the event because there were not that many alchemists in the Extreme Martial Sect. Moreover, the sect lacked resources and one had to bring their own herbs in the Alchemy Competition. Some Alchemists believed that refining dans during the competition would affect their own performance so they didn’t bother signing up.

Even if alchemists wanted to participate in the alchemy competition, they would have to be non-True Disciples, so it was almost impossible for anyone to be in the True Martial Realm. It could be said that Chen Xiang had no pressure at all.

Knock knock knock!

Wu Qianqian lightly knocked on Chen Xiang’s door, waking him up. Inside the Extreme Dan King Courtyard, Chen Xiang was very relaxed unlike when he was outside where his nerves were taut every second, every minute of the day.

Chen Xiang released his divine sense and felt a familiar and peculiar flame aura, he instantly recognized it was Wu Qianqian. However, it was currently the middle of the night and a girl was knocking on a man’s door. More or less, this situation made Chen Xiang’s mind wander in a perverted direction.

Chen Xiang got out of the bed and opened the door.

“Qianqian, what’s the matter?” Chen Xiang asked. Besides the start of the Grand Tournament when he saw Wu Qianqian, he hadn’t seen her or Elder Dan around and had no clue where they both disappeared to. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

"Can we talk?" Wu Qianqian’s mouth curved up slightly, revealing an enchanting, tender, and beautiful smile. At the moment, she became even more confident, and the previous sadness had now vanished, it was clear that she had gotten over her previous depressing mood.

Chen Xiang was also happy for her. If possible, he didn’t want this beautiful girl with a promising future to be ruined just because of some fleeting feelings.

"Of course!" Chen Xiang laughed.

Currently, Wu Qianqian wore a very simple dress with a loose and casual white skirt. Her hair was bundled into a ponytail and there was no makeup on her face, just her natural beauty. Her entire appearance was very beautiful and moving, Chen Xiang’s young blood was boiling from the mature fragrance wafting from her body.

“Chen Xiang, I’m leaving the Extreme Martial Sect with the Dean tomorrow. I’m sorry I can’t watch tomorrow’s competition, please forgive me.” Wu Qianqian’s face was full of helplessness, “I really wanted to see your performance in the Grand Tournament.”

Chen Xiang smiled, “That’s nothing, since the Dean is taking you away from the Extreme Martial Sect, it must naturally be pretty important, don’t miss this opportunity! There will be plenty of opportunities to watch me competing in the future, maybe there will be a chance for us to participate in various competition together and win glory for the Extreme Martial Sect.”

There were a lot of competitions held just for the sake of sects competing with one another.

Thinking about this point, the pretty white face of Wu Qianqian’s had a hint of red afterglow. In her heart she was slightly excited just imagining it.

“En. Chen Xiang, I learned from Elder Dan that you will have to face a powerful adversary tomorrow. It’s rumored that this man is just a hair’s breadth away from the True Martial Realm and he is definitely a Level-3 Alchemist.” Wu Qianqian said.

Chen Xiang nodded his head, "I’ll pay attention. Anyway, where will the Dean take you?"

Wu Qianqian wrinkled her brows and after considering for a moment, she replied, “It’s not only me and the Dean, Yun Xiaodao, Zhu Rong and Xu Weilong are also coming with us. This is because we are the youngest True Martial Realm martial artists of the Extreme Martial Sect. It seems that the Dean wants to discuss something with the other sects considering the Dean is taking us to a gathering of young True Martial Realm martial artists of other sects.”

“So that’s the case.” Chen Xiang also wanted to go, but he was still participating in the Grand Tournament.

Wu Qianqian suddenly whispered, “Chen Xiang, I heard that you and Leng Youlan are sworn brother and sister. In that case, can’t you also take me as your sworn sister?... I just want to stay by your side.”

Wu Qianqian’s face was very red, when she looked at Chen Xiang, her eyes were filled with anticipation. She knew that Xue Xianxian was Chen Xiang’s fiancee. Wu Qianqian felt that she didn’t stand a chance, but she still wanted to be together with Chen Xiang. She could only think of this method to stay by his side.

Chen Xiang stared at her blankly and extended his hands, touching Wu Qianqian’s beautiful face. This action made Wu Qianqian feel very sweet in her heart. At the same time, she was also looking forward to something. She hung her head, waiting for Chen Xiang’s answer!

Just as Chen Xiang was about to say something, the naughty little dragoness attached to his body imitated his voice and hurriedly replied, "I don’t want you to be my sister, I want you to become my woman!"

I’m finished! These words immediately popped out in Chen Xiang’s mind. He could not wait to strangle this naughty dragoness! Always at the most crucial moments, she would say something extremely terrible!

Chen Xiang’s reply made Wu Qianqian’s tender body fiercely shake. She looked up at Chen Xiang, with a trace of surprise and excitement in her eyes. However, her mind was still doubtful, she felt like it was not Chen Xiang who spoke.

"It’s late, I have to go!" Wu Qianqian smiled sweetly, stood up and walked away.

Chen Xiang was muddle-headed and distractedly sat in his room. How was he going to explain? He simply could not explain. He felt like he was going to explode.
