After the countless spirit demons were sliced apart, Li Baojun revealed his hand, and the ground suddenly erupted with raging fire, burning the spirit demons’ corpses into ashes.

Just as they were about to leave, the Sacred Sacrificed Alter suddenly trembled!

"Someone is trying to teleport from there. It should be that Saint Devil from before!" The White Tiger was shocked, it anxiously stomped his feet and released his powerful energy, shattering the Sacred Sacrificed Alter beneath his feet.

"There is a Saint Devil over there. Elder Du and the others should be fine right?!" Elder sister Long, Xiangyue and the others are also over there. " Chen Xiang was extremely worried.

"Don’t worry, there are powerful human beings in the Sacred Dan Realm. With the existence of the Pill Saint, this kind of guy is very scary!" The White Tiger patted Chen Xiang’s shoulder.

After the White Tiger went to Sacred Dan Realm, it wandered around Sacred Dan Realm. He should have seen those strong warriors before!

"Let’s return to the Dragon Subduing City!" Chen Xiang and the others could only fly back because the Heaven Thunder City’s Transmission array was already destroyed.

On the way, Chen Xiang asked: "Senior, you have exchanged blows with the Dragon Emperor, how is his strength?"

When the Dragon Emperor appeared, he wanted to attack Liu Meng’er and the others. Fortunately, the White Tiger had appeared in time.

"He hasn’t reached the level of Ten Heavens Supreme Lord back then, but he will be soon. In the future, he might very likely be a new Ten Heavens Supreme Lord!" The White Tiger said, "Although your potential is great, you won’t be able to catch up to him in a short period of time."

"Then what about the Holy Demons, what is their strength compared to the Dragon Emperor?" Chen Xiang asked again.

"The Dragon Emperor is stronger than the Saint Devil!" The White Tiger said.

"After overcoming the Nine Nirvana Tribulations, one will reach the Immortal Realm, which is divided into the Worldly Immortal Stage, the Immortal Monarch Realm, and the Immortal King Realm! Each stage was further divided into the front, middle and late stages. Furthermore, there were many realms above the Immortal Realm. If he were to claim to be the emperor, then his power would reach its peak. If he doesn’t claim to be an emperor, then call himself an Sky Sovereign. He is more famous than everyone else in the Devil-suppressing Heavenly Venerable, this fellow is a human being that I admire more! Although he has very powerful powers, he doesn’t have the ambition to become an emperor. "

"I just don’t know where Devil-suppressing Heavenly Venerable went. If he really went to a higher realm, then that would be a pity!"

A higher realm? Chen Xiang had already known before that it would be difficult for the ice dragons to survive there, and this was indeed the case. However, in order to obtain an even stronger power, it was necessary to go to a higher realm.

Although Chen Xiang was his disciple, he did not know where exactly Huang Jintian came from. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

On the way, the three of them saw that the Human Realm was filled with demons, these demons were extremely brutal, they had fought their way here, and had even spat out some words to some of the demon leaders, requesting them to quickly retreat, otherwise, there would not even be a chance for negotiation, and they would still attack!

Many of the demons had tried to fly in or crawl in, but to no avail. They were all bounced back by the great array of the Dragon Subduing City, and as for the Evil Dragon Graveyard at the side, they had lost the lives of many demons.

When Chen Xiang and the others came back, it made Yan Yanran and Lan Lan feel much more relaxed. Now that Chen Xiang and Li Baojun had already taken over, they let Zhu Rong and the others rest go and rest.

At this time, the White Tiger was also leaving. There weren’t many experts left in Di Tian, Chen Xiang and Li Baojun could handle it easily, and with Chen Xiang and the White Tiger together, he had gained a lot.

Before leaving, Bai Hu brought the people of the White Tiger Fighting Race to clear away the demons outside of the Dragon Subduing City. This also helped Chen Xiang and the others save a lot of trouble.

"Everyone go and rest first. You’ve all worked hard, so there’s nothing to worry about right now. As long as those demons dare to come, we’ll destroy them as many as we can."

If not for the Holy Demon Realm and the Holy Demon Realm messing up his plans, he would still be carrying out his plans inside the Sacred Dan Realm. It was fortunate that he got the ingredients for a high-grade Ground level pellet from the Sacred Dan Realm.

"Elder Li, I shall leave this place to you. I have something important to do!" Chen Xiang did not forget his agreement with the Super Old Fire Beast.

Now, he had passed the sixth Nirvana Tribulation. The Super Old Fire Beast had said before that as long as he passed the fifth Nirvana Tribulation, he would be fine.

Not long after he returned, Chen Xiang left again. The Dragon Subduing City’s Transmission array was established on the outside and all of it had been destroyed, so he could only go to other cities in order to quickly reach the Chen Martial Continent.

After releasing the Super Old Fire Beast, he planned to go to the Divine Weapons Heavenly Country to find Xue Xianxian. They were husband and wife, but they rarely spent time together, which made him feel extremely guilty.

After a few more twists and turns, he finally arrived at the Chen Martial Continent. Standing beside the You Ming Deep Abyss, he had already found out from the ice dragon that this Super Old Fire Beast was not a bad person.

Arriving at the bottom of the You Ming Deep Abyss, Chen Xiang quickly ran towards the cave that held the Super Old Fire Beast.

"Hello, Senior!" Chen Xiang saw the gigantic Flame Lion lying on the ground with its eyes closed, he shouted lightly.

The Super Old Fire Beast opened its eyes, looked at Chen Xiang, and yawned. "Brat, what are you here for? I don’t believe that you are so kind to come and chat with me! "

"I’m going to let you out. I’ve crossed the sixth level of Nirvana Tribulation. I should have enough strength!" Chen Xiang laughed.

"What?" The Super Old Fire Beast fiercely sat up, its huge body moving too intensely, causing the ground to tremble slightly.

Chen Xiang saw that the Super Old Fire Beast’s eyes were spitting fire, and he was panic-stricken.

"Kid, didn’t This Seat already say that? You are about to come after the five Nirvana Tribulations, and you have just arrived? But then again, it doesn’t seem like much time has passed, does it? You passed the Nirvana Tribulation? " Super Old Fire Beast had originally wanted to go berserk, but when he thought about the time, he was still very excited. He originally predicted that it would take Chen Xiang many years to reach that level.

"I went to the Sacred Dan Realm, and I broke through on the way there. I couldn’t come back for a while, so I was delayed." Chen Xiang was currently considering whether or not he should inform the Super Old Fire Beast of the Ice Dragon’s time.

"Sacred Dan Realm? Could it be the place where he refined the pill all those years ago? Is it now a world of reading? " The Super Old Fire Beast said in shock.

"That’s right, but it’s a mess over there, and there’s also the Sage Devil. I almost can’t come back!" Chen Xiang said.

"Hmph, isn’t it just a Holy Demon? Let me go out and destroy him! " The Super Old Fire Beast roared excitedly.

Chen Xiang knew that this Super Old Fire Beast was very strong, and very impulsive as well. Back then, he wanted to 1v1 some strong people, and it was also because of this that he was sealed here by the ice dragon.

"What can I do to help you out?" Chen Xiang asked.

Go to the Earth’s core first and find the Earth tree’s roots. There, there, you can think of a way to destroy it. That was how that guy trapped me back then. The Super Old Fire Beast said angrily.
