Chen Xiang couldn’t see who was outside, but hearing the conversation, he knew that these old folks were all extremely despicable people. The reason they caught him was not because of some Killing evil dragon, but because they wanted to snatch his Legendary mantra.

"Sister You You You, they want to snatch my Legendary mantra, do you have any ideas? These old fellows seem to have a lot of tricks up their sleeves. " Chen Xiang said.

"Yes, I will take your Legendary mantra away." Just as Bai Youyou finished speaking, he heard Chen Xiang screaming in pain.

"These bastards have started!" Chen Xiang held his head and roared in pain and anger.

The reason why the elders of the Dragon-Elephant School caught Xiao Xianglin was so that they could take away his Legendary mantra, but Xiao Xianglin’s parents were both elders, so they were somewhat afraid when they took action. Furthermore, Chen Xiang thought that they had a very reasonable excuse since they had the Killing evil dragon.

"Chen Xiang, how are you?" Bai Youyou asked anxiously.

"I... My Legendary mantra’s memories are slipping away. " Chen Xiang gasped for breath, at this time the pain was gradually lessening, his memories about the Legendary mantra were already taken away.

"These old bastards truly have some tricks up their sleeves." Bai Youyou was furious. Chen Xiang was her husband, and now that he had suffered such a huge loss, both she and Su Meiyao were extremely angry.

"I must make them wish they were dead." Chen Xiang smashed his fists on the ground. The elder of the Dragon-Elephant School, in order to obtain the Legendary mantra, had used an excuse to openly take away his Legendary mantra.

"Whatever you take away from me, I will take it back!"

Chen Xiang’s head was still throbbing with pain!

"You can let him go back now." An old man said.

"He will always be a Killing evil dragon, this ... That’s no problem, right? "

"Don’t worry, it won’t cause any trouble, as long as he doesn’t have any Legendary mantra s."

These indistinct voices gradually weakened, Chen Xiang was unconscious, his soul was severely injured, and the moment he woke up, he saw Xiao Xianglin’s jade face that was filled with ice-cold anger. It was obvious that he was angry at for receiving such an injury.

"What’s the matter with you?" Xiao Xianglin saw Chen Xiang opening his eyes and asked anxiously.

"He didn’t die!" Chen Xiang heaved a sigh of relief. At this moment, he was still extremely weak, because his soul had suffered a heavy injury.

"Bring Xiang’er and Yu’er out to take care of you. Your soul has been severely injured and you won’t be able to recover for a while. You have been unconscious for three days." Xiao Xianglin’s heart ached, and he caressed Chen Xiang’s face: "What exactly did those fellows do to you!"

"What did they do to me?" Chen Xiang thought back to this matter. He, who was weak and powerless, fiercely clenched his fists and puckered his bedding: "That group of old bastards, they took away my Legendary mantra!"

"They... Did they really do that? " Xiao Xianglin could not believe that the Legendary mantra was actually taken away.

She suddenly understood that the reason the elder of the Dragon-Elephant School had brought Chen Xiang away was not because of some Killing evil dragon but because he wanted to obtain Chen Xiang’s Legendary mantra.

Xiang’er and Yu’er came out from You Yao Mountain Villa, they stood by the side of the bed and looked at Chen Xiang with extreme sadness. They were inside You Yao Mountain Villa, but they heard Chen Xiang’s painful howl.

Chen Xiang thought back to this matter and became extremely angry, before fainting again. The pain in his soul was hard to recover from, even with the Mei Jing Sisters channeling the power of regeneration, it was slowly recovering.

A few days later, when Chen Xiang woke up, he found Xiang’er and Ling’er sitting beside his bed. However, this was no longer Xiao Xianglin’s room.

"How long have I been unconscious?" Chen Xiang became more spirited, at least he could get up and walk around.

"A month!" Xiang’er’s face did not look good before, but when she saw that Chen Xiang had woken up, she revealed a smile.

"I’ve recovered quite well." The girl smiled, as if she were pretending.

A month! Enough! When Chen Xiang saw the complexions of the two girls, he had a bad premonition. He reckoned that something must have happened to Xiao Xianglin.

"Where’s Master?" Chen Xiang frowned and asked: "Did something happen to her? What is this place? Master, was she also captured by those old fellows to take away the Legendary mantra? "

Xiang’er and Yu’er pursed their lips and did not speak, but tears could not help but leak out of their beautiful eyes. It was clear that something big had happened to Xiao Xianglin.

"If your Big Sister is still alive, quickly tell me. There might be hope." Chen Xiang took a few deep breaths to calm himself down.

When encountering something like this, he needed to remain extremely calm. Even if he had a lot of anger and worry in his heart, he absolutely could not panic, because doing so would not solve the problem at all.

"When you woke up that day ... Once you’ve told us what happened to you and fainted, Big Sis would ask us to secretly move you away the next night. " Xiang’er wiped her tears, the calmness that suddenly appeared on Chen Xiang’s face also calmed her down.

Chen Xiang could guess that whatever Xiao Xianglin was planning to do, he was definitely going to take revenge for him. During this period of time where he and Xiao Xianglin had come here, they were extremely clear about Xiao Xianglin’s personality.

In short, the information we gathered from the Dragon-Elephant School was that she had used a very strong power and killed many Elders and Elders. The mountain where the Dragon-Elephant School Elders were at and the residences of the relatives of the Elders nearby were all destroyed, resulting in numerous casualties. Yu’er continued.

"It’s the Tao-creation’s Divine Crystal! She refined the Tao-creation’s Divine Crystal. " Chen Xiang clenched his fist. "Where’s Master? Is she involved? "

"That’s true... However, she was caught. Two of the Elders reacted in time to resist ... and also saw her ruthlessly killing the Great Clan Elder, who was the former Leader. It should be him who obtained your Legendary mantra. " Xiang’er said.

"Big Sister has been captured, and we have to publicly execute her ... Just one year later, when Leader comes out and takes charge of this matter. " As Liu’er said this, she could not help but shed tears. "This matter shocked Tao-creation School ... Tao-creation School’s Elders have also come. Tao-creation School’s Elders and the Dragon-Elephant School’s Elders are very close, and now they have moved into Dragon-Elephant School. "

"Is there any news of Luo Jiuyang?" Chen Xiang took a deep breath. Initially, he had saved Dragon-Elephant School’s Yuan Zhiqing and Tao-creation School’s Wan Haixu, but this seemed to be useless. These two Leader s were now heavily injured. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

"No, there has been no news of Gu Tong and Luo Jiuyang ever since that incident." Xiang’er said, she knew that Chen Xiang had a good relationship with him.

"One more year!" Chen Xiang frowned, "Where are Master’s parents? Where did they all go? For one year, I will need to at least have the cultivation of Late period of World Defying magic realm to be able to save Master. "

"I don’t know. Ever since they went out last time, they haven’t returned. Even now, they haven’t returned after such a huge incident occurred." Xiang’er shook her head, she did not dare think in a bad direction.

"Will Master be taken away?" Chen Xiang was also worried that Xiao Xianglin would experience that kind of pain.

"More than half of those doyens were killed by Big Sister. They need to join hands in order to succeed." Xiang’er said: "What Big Sister has done this time, shocked many forces!"
