A Comprehensive Preparation

After Chen Xiang returned to the small house halfway up the mountain, Xue Xianxian and Leng Youlan both flew over and tightly hugged his bulky body.

Chen Xiang enjoyed a lot as he held the two fragrant, soft, and delicate bodies.

"Brother, go take a bath and change your clothes! Do you want me to rub your back? " Leng Youlan laughed as she said.

“Well ...” Chen Xiang glanced at Xue Xianxian, only to hear her snorting, “I’ll do it then."

Just like this, in the bath pool that was shrouded in mist, two extremely beautiful women in light clothes were gently rubbing Chen Xiang’s back. Chen Xiang leaned against the edge of the bath, enjoying the massage by two pairs of delicate hands.

“Brother, did you really cultivate to the tenth level?” Leng Youlan pulled the white towel, that had dropped a lot, in the front of her breast. She really wanted to remove the bindings that were in her way, but after Xue Xianxian had told her many things about men and women for these days, she realized it this was an extremely shameful action.

Chen Xiang felt uncomfortable watching as he was tightly wrapped around by pairs of such big “jade rabbits”. He really wanted to stroke and comfort the aggrieved “rabbits”, but he could only imagine that. After all, Xue Xianxian was here and she had already agreed to his fair with Liu Menger, so he did not dare to disobey her words.

“Of course, what about you?” Chen Xiang asked. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“We are in the fourth level. Big brother, you’re really amazing!” Leng Youlan pursed her lips and said. In this aspect, she was still far behind Chen Xiang. She originally planned to increase her strength in a short period then defeated Chen Xiang.

“You are my sister, so I will definitely protect you in the future.” Chen Xiang touched her bulging face, He really wanted to embrace her into his hands.

“You mean forever” Leng Youlan gently caressed Chen Xiang’s chest, causing his heart to waver.

“Of course forever.” Chen Xiang smiled gently as he grabbed Leng Youlan’s hands and gently stroked them.

Leng Youlan looked at Xue Xianxian and muttered, “sister Xianxian would be jealous if she sees that. It’s better for me to protect myself!”

Xue Xianxian laughed and patted Leng Youlan’s plump butt, then scolded with a smile, “you little goblin, I did not say anything as you seduce my husband in front of me. If I would be jealous, I wouldn’t have let you take advantage of this bad guy all day long.”

“I didn’t take advantage of Youlan.” Chen Xiang said with an aggrieved expression.

“I know that both big brother and sister dote on me, so I want to become more powerful. In the future, I will protect you from being bullied by others!” Leng Youlan hugged Xue Xianxian and kissed her cheek. She had no relatives, and since both Xue Xianxian and Chen Xiang cared for her so much, she was very touched.

In front of an acquaintance, she was indeed like a well-behaved and sensible little girl. However, when strangers met her, they would always be beaten by her even if their eyes were slightly dishonest, or at least be scolded by her.

Xue Xianxian already realized that Leng Youlan would definitely be Chen Xiang’s woman in the future. She had already seen through it and could not say anything. She only let out a faint sigh because the three of them, a master and two disciples, would all be Chen Xiang’s women in the future.

At night, the two women hugged Chen Xiang and listened attentively as Chen Xiang taught them the Tai Chi Divine Technique. They had already started cultivating the Frost Wind Divine Technique, which was a rather difficult martial art, so it wasn’t difficult for them to learn Tai Chi Divine Technique right now.

“Brother, don’t you know how those teachers looked when they learned that we have mastered the first level of Demon Subduing Force? They opened their mouths so wide that they could swallow a duck egg, haha ...” Leng Youlan hugged Chen Xiang’s arm and used her impressive “jade rabbits” to clamp onto Chen Xiang’s arm, making him feel uneasy.

“We’re all in the fourth level now. If we tell those old fellows, they’ll definitely be scared silly! Even if we hold it secret. After the new Demon Subduing Board is released, we will use this Demon Subduing Force to defeat those guys and let them know how powerful we are.” Xue Xianxian laid on Chen Xiang’s chest with an excited smile on her face. She had been with Leng Youlan for a long time. Although she was not as violent as Leng Youlan, she was still infected and became full of belligerent blood.

Chen Xiang smiled and said, “fine. In the next period, we will do as usual. We will wait for the new Demon Subduing Board to come out then take the action!"

Leng Youlan said excitedly, “brother, are you going to kill Zhong Quan? You can’t kill people within the Demon Subduing Academy, otherwise you will be severely punished!”

Chen Xiang frowned. His body had tensed up and his fists cracked loudly. His face was filled with rage, "I must kill him because he wanted to kill me! That will also remind Liao Shaoyun and others who are thinking of me that I, Chen Xiang, am not a weakling. Whoever provokes me, I’ll put him down.”

“That’s right. That’s how it should be!” Leng Youlan approved of Chen Xiang’s words.

“Be careful. I am always on your back!” Xue Xianxian kissed Chen Xiang’s cheek. Leng Youlan saw it and did the same, but this was her first time kissing a man.

This made Chen Xiang feel extremely happy. He said with a beautiful smile, “go to sleep!”

Chen Xiang was currently the focal point of discussion within the school, because he made two strong foes not long after he got in the Academy. One of them was Lu Xiong. Although Lu Xiong fainted quickly from Chen Xiang’s actions, the power behind him was not simple either.

The other person was Liao Shaoyun. Liao Shaoyun and Zhong Quan were the top students in the Demon Subduing Academy!

Many people were worried that Chen Xiang would be killed, but they didn’t know that Chen Xiang would be able to sleep with two peerless beauties in his arms. Otherwise, they would be so jealous that they wouldn’t be able to sleep.

Because the Ranking Tournament of Demon Subduing Board had begun, the courses for the students were much more relaxed. On one hand, the Academy wished students to learn some things from watching martial arts. On the other hand, there were so many martial artists participating in the Ranking Tournament that they were unable to attend classes.

On the opposite, Chen Xiang, Leng Youlan and Xue Xianxian rarely went to watch the tournament. They had very important things to do. Leng Youlan and Xue Xianxian needed to learn the Demon Subduing Force and Tai Chi Divine Technique, while Chen Xiang needed to master the Demon Subduing Force and condense the divine leaves. Once he good medicinal ingredients, he could use the considerable amount of Liquid of God of Creation to quickly plant them, and then refine them into those Dan.

After he successfully concocted the Dan, it would become easier for him and his family to obtain strong powers. Therefore, this was also the area he needed to focus on!

During these days, Leng Youlan and Xue Xianxian had been training very hard, and Chen Xiang would properly give them the Pure Essence Golden Dan so that they could temper their True Qi even denser while not affecting their foundations.

Although their improvement was fast, they were cultivating in a special space. They stayed in there for a long time, so their foundations were very solid. Therefore, Chen Xiang was not worried about affecting them.

The Ranking Tournament was extremely popular. Every time Chen Xiang and the girls went to a crowded place in the Academy, they would hear many people talking about it, but they didn’t care at all. Right now, they only needed to work hard to increase their strength, and when the results were out, they would challenge those on the Demon Subduing Board then fiercely shame the Academy!
