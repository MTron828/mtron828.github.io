Xiao Xianglin’s parents were secretly surprised when they saw Chen Xiang’s trick. Previously, they knew that their daughter had some skills in taking in a disciple who possessed a very powerful divine sword. She was able to shatter the divine sword that was made from Tao-creation’s Holy stone.

"Xianglin, you can just stay here." ’s father, Xiao Hengyong, said in a serious tone. This place was still safe, but it was hard to say what would happen inside the barrier. For the sake of his daughter’s comfort, Xiao Hengyong would not allow her to enter.

Hearing that, Xiao Xianglin snorted angrily, but she did not say anything, she knew that Xiao Hengyong was doing this for her safety, it was for her own good.

However, she refused to accept this, because in this place, many disciples had cultivations similar to hers. There were even some who were not as strong as her, that they could enter, but she could not.

"You all are really messing around... Xiang Luan, even if you don’t think for yourself, you still have to think for your disciple. She just took in a pretty good disciple, and you’re bringing her around to do whatever you want, truly. " Xiao Hengyong said.

Xiao Xianglin looked at Chen Xiang and pursed her lips. She thought that even if all the disciples here died, Chen Xiang might not die, so she was very clear about Chen Xiang’s hidden strength.

"Chen Xiang, let’s go!" Xiao Xianglin brought Chen Xiang to an empty area. Xiang’er and Yu’er pulled her caravan over, and then she got on the caravan out of breath.

Chen Xiang followed her in. Xiao Xianglin was so angry that her cheeks bulged, because her parents always treated her like a child.

"What do we do now?" Yu’er said.

"Chen Xiang, quickly think of a way!" Xiang’er pushed Chen Xiang a little when he saw him being so calm and composed.

"What’s the hurry? Wait until they go in first. " Chen Xiang laughed: This is nothing to be angry about, your parents are not letting you in, just promise that you won’t go in, first promise that then we will talk.

"Do you mean that we should sneak in?" Xiao Xianglin said.

"Hm!" Although it is a very powerful barrier, you must have confidence in our strength. Without their help, we can still enter. " Chen Xiang looked through the window at the distant region shrouded in clouds that was releasing light. The area enveloped in a barrier was very large.

"I can give it a try ..." I was just worried that we wouldn’t be able to get in. " Xiao Xianglin said: "The various big sects should have arrived very early, but they are all outside now, and have not entered the barrier yet. It’s clear that they have been blocked by the barrier, or they are waiting for an opportunity, for the barrier to open."

"Master, you will know when you go out and ask!" You promised your parents that you wouldn’t go in, and said that you were very curious about the things here, so they will definitely tell you. " Chen Xiang chuckled: "After you ask around, I’ll go check on that barrier."

"Alright!" Xiao Xianglin’s anger had already subsided a lot. If she and Chen Xiang could break through the barrier and enter, she wouldn’t have to fear being scolded by her parents.

Xiao Xianglin got out of the carriage, and went to find her parents to ask them about the details of the place.

An hour later, Xiao Xianglin returned. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

"Gu Tong and Luo Jiuyang have already entered ... I never thought that both Dragon-Elephant School s would come and enter the barrier. " Xiao Xianglin said, "As long as this barrier reaches the full moon, the chance for it to become weak, Xu Du. At that time, if you use enough strength, you can open a hole and enter."

"The Leader and the rest went in first to scout, and brought over a dozen strong Palace Main Disciples with them. When they have a clear picture of the situation, they will inform the people outside to go in."

Chen Xiang looked at the barrier before him and said softly: "Then what about the Legendary mantra s? With so many people going in, would they all get Legendary mantra? Or is there a lot of good stuff in it? "

"I don’t know ..." My parents are deliberately hiding something. I think there’s more than just Legendary mantra s inside. " Xiao Xianglin said: "Otherwise, we wouldn’t have let such a powerful disciple come."

Chen Xiang had also seen earlier that the disciples here were all Palace Main Disciples s, the core strength of the sect.

"Alright, I’ll go outside the barrier to check it out first when it gets dark." Chen Xiang looked at the sky: "It’s already evening."

Xiao Xianglin nodded her head. She was completely at ease with Chen Xiang as she felt that he was much more powerful than many Palace Main Disciples.

At night, Chen Xiang activated Counter Power Invisibility and left the carriage.

Chen Xiang used his Spatial Force and easily passed through it. Previously, he had comprehended a few spatial techniques, so his use of Spatial Force had increased by quite a bit.

Chen Xiang released the Six Realms mirrors. He quickly rode on it and arrived beside the barrier.

"Xiao Ke’er, what do you think?" Chen Xiang only had a slight understanding of barriers, but Feng Ke’er was extremely proficient in them.

Feng Ke’er came out of the You Yao Mountain Villa, placed her small hands on the barrier, and closed her eyes. She was investigating the power of the barrier, as well as the structure of the barrier.

Two hours later, Feng Ke’er reaped some rewards, and said: "It’s extremely troublesome, this barrier is created using the Tao-creation’s Incantation. If you want to pass through, you can only use the Time and space power to pierce through space."

"Is my current strength enough?" Chen Xiang asked.

Feng Ke’er shook his head: "This barrier has a huge limitation on the power of space. Even so, this is the only direction that can be broken through.

"The full moon? There are still a few days left! " Chen Xiang said: "By then, Xiao Xianglin will definitely be seen to death by her parents, and would be hard to move, so we can only move ahead!"

"Even though your spatial energy isn’t sufficient, your Six Realms mirrors has already replicated several Transmission array s before ... I should be able to modify those Transmission array s and let the Six Realms mirrors release sufficient strength to create space. Then, I can absorb your power of time and teleport it in. " Feng Ke’er said: "But at that time, I will need your master’s help!"

"No problem!" Chen Xiang said.

"Alright, let’s head back now. I’ll have a chat with her first. She’s rather proficient in formations, so it’s better if we discuss it with her." Feng Ke’er said.

After Chen Xiang returned to the carriage, he anxiously asked: "How is it? Is it easy to pass through that barrier? "

"It’s not easy... This question, it would be better if this little girl could explain it to you. " Chen Xiang shook his head.

"Little girl?" Xiao Xianglin, Yue Shuang, and the two girls were confused. Where did this little girl come from?

Just as they were wondering, Feng Ke’er came out of You Yao Mountain Villa. She looked like a little girl a few years old, and was extremely cute.

"This... Your daughter? " Xiao Xianglin was startled and asked.

"He wouldn’t have a daughter as good as me." Feng Ke’er smiled sweetly.

Chen Xiang explained Feng Ke’er’s background, Xiao Xianglin and the others could also accept this kind of thing, they were just surprised, but after that, Feng Ke’er kept talking about the situation with Xiao Xianglin, causing Xiao Xianglin to be shocked, she suddenly felt that it was more appropriate for Feng Ke’er to be her disciple.
