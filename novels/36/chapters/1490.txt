The people that went in were divided into two groups. The first group went in for over 500 people, and the second group went in for over 500 people. Because there was a huge formation covering that area, not even their spiritual sense could penetrate inside, so they couldn’t know the strength of those that went in.

"What’s the point of being so cautious? With just their powers alone, what’s there to worry about? With the two great powers of both the evil and good here, who would dare to scheme against them?" Chen Xiang snorted.

"Who else but you?" Long Xueyi laughed.

Chen Xiang waited from morning until night, but he did not see anyone enter the Heaven Realm’s door again. At this time, the Heaven Realm’s door was still open, and had not been closed.

"There must be an expert guarding this place. Otherwise, if someone destroys the door to the Heavenly Realm, they won’t be able to come back. It’s time for you to take action." Long Xueyi said.

Chen Xiang nodded, following the mark on the map to look for the array base.

At this time, it was deep into the night, and a meteor shower actually appeared in the sky. The moment the meteor landed, it was bright and resplendent, and that beauty was enough to make people sigh with emotion. The people who were originally planning to spectate here all became excited when they saw the meteor shower appear.

Chen Xiang quickly arrived at the top of the array base. According to his discovery from the Array, the array base should be at this place, but he did not discover anything.

"I found it. It’s really deep, at least 10,000 feet deep." Chen Xiang said: "Looks like I’ll need quite a bit of time to dive into the depths of the lake."

Chen Xiang sucked in a light breath of air, released the power of the spatial laws, and punched the ground. Attacking through the air, he created a hole in the ground, then traveled back to the ground and entered that space, where he repeated his attack.

He wasn’t too far away, so he couldn’t take one step at a time. This was already considered fast, otherwise, it would be extremely difficult to dive thousands of feet deep into the ground without being discovered.

"There’s an underground palace below. It looks quite large. I wonder who built it." Long Xueyi was surprised. She originally thought that she was an array base that could absorb energy, but she never thought that there would be an underground palace here.

After a few hours, Chen Xiang finally reached the underground palace. There was an empty hall, but in the middle of the hall there was a trapezoidal shaped stage, with several tens of steps.

"Just who built it?"

Chen Xiang was filled with curiosity, he felt that this matter was not as simple as it seemed, because it was related to that Divine Book, and that Divine Book was found in the’s Sacred Grounds. That Sacred Land was filled with all kinds of dangers.

Stepping onto the stairs leading to the platform, he could immediately sense that the interior of the platform was filled with power.

"It’s very ancient. I wonder how many years it has been built for. It seems to have appeared even before the time of the Ten Heavens Supreme Lord." Long Xueyi said in shock: "Look at those Spirit grain below, they are all ancient abandoned Spirit grain, and some very ancient words."

"Do you understand those words?" Chen Xiang asked in shock. He could understand the ancient characters from the Ten Heavens Supreme Lord’s era, but he never thought that these words would be even older than this.

"I understand a little bit, but it says that this is called the Sacred Transformation Platform. Continue walking, I want to see if there are these ancient characters on every step." Long Xueyi urged. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Chen Xiang walked up. Some did, some did not, and those ancient abandoned Spirit grain were useless.

"This altar can lead to a heavenly domain that nurtures Saint Force. That world is extremely vast and full of danger. Many powerful individuals went inside and disappeared. I’m one of the few that can return." Long Xueyi said as he tidied up the messy ancient characters.

"Did you mention who he was?" Chen Xiang asked.

"No, he said he was a blacksmith."

, the blacksmith, was surprised: "Could he be a Divine Blacksmith? This guy is also very mysterious. To be able to create so many Divine Weapons, this Divine Book must be related to him, because the Divine Book contains the refining plans of the Suzaku bow."

"It’s very possible that he is, but the Spirit grain that he passed down to his descendants are completely different from the ones that he has mastered the deepest parts of. It’s possible that he modified it to refine it into an emasculated version, and I don’t know why this is so, but what he really learned should be in the Four Symbols Divine Weapons and that Divine Book." Long Xueyi said: "Let’s go to that Heaven Realm first."

Chen Xiang came to the top of the stage and stood inside a circular array. In the middle of the Transmission array, there was actually a slot, and it looked like it was placed inside a Green dragon demon-slain broadsword.

"If this place was not built by Divine Craftsmen, or was modified by Divine Craftsmen, I feel that the Ten Heavens Supreme Lord has come to this place before, the relationship between Divine Craftsmen and Ten Heavens Supreme Lord should be very good."

Seeing that hole, Chen Xiang knew that it was a keyhole, and Green dragon demon-slain broadsword was the only key.

Chen Xiang took out the Green dragon demon-slain broadsword and inserted it into the hole, but there was no reaction. He pressed the button again and realized that the Green dragon demon-slain broadsword could turn, and after spinning, the Green dragon demon-slain broadsword would come out by itself. The Transmission array’s runes started to absorb the energy that had been gathered here for many years, and the runes started to emit multicolored light bit by bit.

... .... When that group of people entered the Saint Realm, they didn’t immediately see a large amount of heavenly and earthly treasures. They only came to a world that emitted a faint golden light.

The flowing energy here was filled with holy spirit energy. After absorbing it into their bodies, they would be able to refine it into holy energy immediately, causing the experts who were struggling in the Immortal-becoming realm to be extremely excited. This was because it would allow them to save a lot of time to convert the energy within their bodies.

The moment they entered, they saw a golden trapezoidal shaped stage. When everyone wanted to enter, they were blocked by a very powerful force, unable to enter it. Even if a few Immortal-becoming realm Rankers joined forces, they were unable to break through the barrier.

Everyone flew high up in the sky. Seeing that there was an array pattern on the stage, they immediately understood that this was a Transmission array.

"A lot of people haven’t come in yet. It seems like there’s a way in from the Ninth Heaven, but we can’t find it." An old man said.

"The stones here are all ordinary stones, the interior does not contain holy energy, but from the dense holy energy here, some Holy stone with holy energy must be born." The old man from Divine Artisan Mountain Villa said as he crushed a rock and looked around.

The Fire Divine Palace suddenly said, "Look at the Transmission array, is there a crack in it that can be used to insert items?"

Hearing his words, everyone looked at the center of the Transmission array carefully.

His disciple immediately frowned. "This ..." It seems to be inserted into the Green dragon demon-slain broadsword. We have seen such a mechanism in the Evil Divine Palace. "

"The Transmission array lit up." One of them suddenly shouted,
