"World Defying Stage Fierce Power?" Chen Xiang thought of the World Defying mad source bead: "But I wonder if the World Defying mad source bead can do it?"

Chen Xiang had tried to absorb the energy from the World Defying mad source bead before, but to no avail. Even if he had to ’take’ the energy from the World Defying mad source bead to refine it, he would not be able to. -

However, Feng Ke’er’s situation was different. She did not want to ’fuse’ this type of energy into her own body, but wanted to maintain the circulation of the seal’s power.

"Won’t you know after trying?" Feng Ke’er said: "First, swallow the World Defying Stage Fierce Power inside the World Defying mad source bead into your own body, then control this wave of World Defying Stage Fierce Power and enter the Six Realms mirrors. At that time, I will guide this wave of World Defying Stage Fierce Power to activate the formation."

"Alright, I’ll give it a try now!"

Chen Xiang placed the Six Realms mirrors inside the Tianchuang furnace, and then placed a drop of World Defying mad source bead inside his own Divine Sense Sea. This World Defying mad source bead had already been sealed by Feng Ke’er, and wouldn’t go around randomly.

Chen Xiang used the Devouring magic kungfu to devour the World Defying Stage Fierce Power inside the World Defying mad source bead, and then channeled this wave of World Defying Stage Fierce Power into the Six Realms mirrors.

"It worked!" Feng Ke’er shouted in surprise: "You still have a few World Defying mad source bead left, I believe you should be able to succeed."

"En!" This time, Chen Xiang was even more confident.

After saying that, Chen Xiang decided to start.

He did not need to concoct any pills in the shop now, as he had plenty of time to do so.

"It will definitely take quite a bit of time." Feng Ke’er said: "If we can really refine a pill spirit, then wouldn’t that mean that in the future, there would be endless Strong strength Dan s?"

Yue Yiran had previously said that Elixirs could also produce elixirs, so of course Strong strength Dan spirits would give birth to Strong strength Dan s, but he did not know if that was true or not.

"Only success will know." Chen Xiang laughed: "Let’s begin!"

Chen Xiang took out all of the Strong strength Dan medicine ingredients and threw them into the furnace. This way, the quality would be high from the start.

It took him three days and three nights to finally refine the medicinal ingredients that he had saved before into a lump of medicinal crystal. This lump of medicinal crystal was very big and of an extremely high quality.

"I’m starting to use the derivation method. It might take a little more time." Chen Xiang said. Right now he did not use Time Domain, because the refining process would definitely consume a large amount of energy. If he used Time Domain again, he might not be able to last until the end.

Although the quality of the derivation is very high, it does not take a long time. This is one of the advantages of derivation.

The derived method was better than Crash method, it was softer. However, when the Crash method collided, it would pose a huge challenge. Chen Xiang’s Tianchuang furnace would once explode from the impact.

Chen Xiang used the huge lump of ’medicine’ crystal to give birth to nine and a half large pills, and handed them over to Feng Ke’er. What he needed to do was to release a strong World Defying god fire and make those crystals soften under the high temperature.

"It’s not that hard." Feng Ke’er released the sealing power, and very quickly, the large and small ’medicine’ crystals all merged together.

Although it had fused together, the crystal was still as big as before. It was just that the quality had become very, very high. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

But Chen Xiang would continue with the derivation process, and then continue the fusion process after. He did not know how many rounds he would have to go through.

It would have to wait until the pill spirit was refined, or until both he and Feng Ke’er were unable to continue, before it would stop.

The second round was completed in a flash. Both Chen Xiang and Feng Ke’er did not feel any pressure and could be considered to be relatively relaxed. Just the second round alone used ten days of time.

The third round could also be easily completed, but it would take at least ten days!

"Just the third round alone took twenty days." Chen Xiang took a deep breath, "I wonder how many rounds I’ll need to succeed!"

"We were already mentally prepared, so no matter how many rounds it takes, we will persevere." Feng Ke’er said.

If Chen Xiang had a very strong power, he could use the Crash method to ’cross’ them. Then, the quality of the ’medicine’ would be even higher, and the improvement would be much faster than the ’derivation’.

Especially in the later stages of the pill, the higher the quality of the crystal, the higher the impact, the higher the improvement, which was also better than the derivative method, it was just that Chen Xiang had high requirements for it, he was unable to suppress the power that would come out when the crystal collided, even if they combined with Feng Ke’er.

In the blink of an eye, three months had passed, yet Chen Xiang had already gone through twenty rounds, which made it extremely difficult for her to fuse the ’medicinal crystals’.

Because the quality of the grown ’medicine’ crystal was already very high, Chen Xiang had to fuse them together with Feng Ke’er.

"I wonder when the Heavenly Pill Assembly will begin ... Forget it, forget it. Refining a pill spirit is more important. " Chen Xiang had already been in closed-door training for a very long time and had not left his room. Fortunately, no one came to disturb him, so he continued his refinement with ease.

"It’s only twenty rounds and it’s already that difficult. I previously estimated that I would need a hundred rounds to refine a pill spirit." Feng Ke’er said: "How about this, you release the Time Domain, or else it will take too long. When the time comes, you will be disturbed, and things will become troublesome."

Feng Ke’er was most worried about this, and he couldn’t be disturbed like this. Once it stopped, all their previous efforts would have been for naught.

"Alright!" Even though Chen Xiang had only released the first stage of Time Domain, it was enough to buy him a lot of time.

After releasing the Time Domain, it also increased the burden on Chen Xiang’s energy consumption. Although it was only a little, for a pill spirit like the one Chen Xiang was refining now, the energy consumption would be huge if it accumulated for a long time.

... ....

Yue Yiran looked at Chen Xiang’s hut and said with a frown: "This guy has already been in closed door cultivation for four months, and yet he still hasn’t come out.

"Should I go in and call him?" The manager said.

"Don’t, Alchemist hates being disturbed when he is refining pills." Yue Yiran shook his head: "How about this, I will participate in it myself, at that time you just have to tell him how to find me, I need to hurry up and register for our shop."

"Okay, I’ll tell him when he comes out." After the shopkeeper had finished speaking, he asked, "What if he goes into seclusion like this all the time?"

"Then forget it!" Yue Yiran said: "He has been in closed-door training for so long, he must be doing something extremely important, and cannot be disturbed."

"It’s going to start in two months. I hope he can make it." The shopkeeper looked at Chen Xiang’s hut and muttered.

Yue Yiran left the shop by himself.

... ....

As for Chen Xiang’s side, he had already used the Time Domain for one month. Inside the Time Domain, he had already spent thirty months.

"It’s really not easy. I never would have thought that I would be able to persist until now." Chen Xiang was already extremely exhausted. He had just completed a round of fusion with Long Xueyi and his sisters were currently channeling the power of rebirth to them, allowing them to quickly recover.
