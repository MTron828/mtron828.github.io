CHAPTER 3370

This mysterious opposite bank seems to be more developed and more powerful. Shen Xiang remembers the fish people he saw before. He was just born, and he has the strength of Violent World Defying Realm, which is hard to match.

Shen Xiang followed Ma Tianhai to Centaur Sacred City.

The city was built in the middle of the forest. The walls were surrounded by a large trunk. There is no castle barrier in the city, but there are many Centaur hand-held bows on the wall to guard the city.

“It’s relatively simple.” Shen Xiang just came to the door of the city and came to the conclusion that there is no large formation in the city. If a war breaks out, the city can be destroyed if it is just outside.

“Where is it? Our Centaur Sacred City is the best city in Soul Demon Sacred Forest.” Ma Tianhai dissatisfied, coldly snorted.

“In such a broken city, I can kill it all at once.” Shen Xiang is also coldly snorted.

“Do not believe!” Ma Tianhai said.

“Okay, then I will show it to you now.” Shen Xiang took a deep breath and started to run the strength of the body.

“Don’t mess, I believe in you!” Ma Tianhai saw Shen Xiang seriously, worried about what happened to Shen Xiang, and quickly shouted.

Ma Tianhai came to the city gate with Shen Xiang. Shen Xiang originally thought that he would give something to the city, but he did not expect that the Centaur guards saw the Ma Tianhai, and they were very respectful.

“This guy has a lot to come!” Shen Xiang thought of it secretly, then followed Ma Tianhai into the city.

After entering the city, Ma Tianhai took Shen Xiang to the most s.p.a.cious street in the middle.

After many of the Centaurs on the street saw Ma Tianhai, unexpectedly they all let a road come.

“What is this guy coming to?” Shen Xiang is curious in his heart, and Ma Tianhai is obviously a party here.

Shen Xiang didn’t ask him about his status before. It’s not easy to ask questions now, just silently following.

About half an hour later, Ma Tianhai took Shen Xiang into a very luxurious palace. This is the Imperial Palace of Centaur Sacred City. This Ma Tianhai is actually a royal member of Centaur Demon Clan. It is no wonder that he was in the prestige.

“Good guy, what the h.e.l.l are you coming to?” Shen Xiang whispered.

“I am Crown Prince!” Ma Tianhai said smelly fart.

“You are a Crown Prince?” Shen Xiang couldn’t believe it. He immediately thought of the former bear-like bear of Centaur. This bear goods was actually Crown Prince, which surprised him.

Ma Tianhai saw Shen Xiang faceless, whispered: “You can’t talk about things before, it will make me very embarra.s.sed. If someone asks you, you will say that it is my friend, I know when I am hunting.” of.”

“I know!” Shen Xiang had a weird smile on his face.

When Ma Tianhai recalled his beggar-like bear, he couldn’t help but look old. It was really shameful. He didn’t expect that he would be so timid, because he had never encountered such a thing since he was a child. He has always been But spoiled and grown up.

Shen Xiang finally understands why Ma Tianhai does not let him ride. Actually this is Crown Prince of Centaur Demon Clan. If someone sees a human riding on his back, this face can be lost.

Just like his life!

“What about our previous agreement?” Shen Xiang whispered.

“You come with me.”

Ma Tianhai took Shen Xiang to a small villa in the Imperial Palace. The name of the villa is Celestial Sea Villa. It was built for Ma Tianhai. After all, he is Crown Prince. It is normal to have such a large site.

The small villa is very deserted, and no one can see it. It is a surprise to Shen Xiang.

“Here is your own one?” Shen Xiang whispered.

“No way, I lost power, no one mixed with me, only myself, they all ran away, they worried that I would rebel, fearing to be tired, so I ran away early.” Ma Tianhai helplessly sighed Come to a living room with Shen Xiang.

“What a joke, you will rebel?” Shen Xiang couldn’t help but laugh, Ma Tianhai, this guy is afraid of death, and he can’t dare to give him ten dogs.

“Do you think I dare?” Ma Tianhai saw Shen Xiang’s mocking smile, as if he felt that his dignity had been trampled, and he said with a serious look.

“You are so afraid of death, of course not dare!” Shen Xiang laughed, looking for a chair to sit down: “I don’t know who it is, I was scared to have a few pounds of tears, such a guy would rebel? Kill me or not believe !”

“Don’t look down on me, I will become stronger.” Ma Tianhai was very dissatisfied. He felt that he was very bad luck. The people in his own village were all gone, and he was. .h.i.t hard.

In order to make himself stronger, he decided to go out of the city to practice and fight what he was hunting. He knew that he was insidious like Shen Xiang, almost lost his life, and was scared to cry.

“dao creation saint stone? Where is it?” Shen Xiang asked.

Ma Tianhai knows that Shen Xiang is a very capable guy, a human being, who dares to run around in the forest. He wants to see how strong Shen Xiang is, because in his eyes, Shen Xiang’s is not as strong as him. When he got up, Shen Xiang couldn’t catch up with him. He thought through this aspect.

“I am Crown Prince, I should have been a successor, but there are a lot of Princes here. There are a lot better than me. They all think that I am not qualified to be a Centaur G.o.d Emperor, so they are putting pressure on my Imperial Father! Finally I am Imperial. Father announced that the strongest can be the real successor, and also get two dao creation saint stone rewards.” Ma Tianhai said.

Shen Xiang understood, and said: “Then you lose, you think that two dao creation saint stone is yours, but now it has been taken away, right?”

Ma Tianhai shook her head. “No, I didn’t go to the compet.i.tion… The last winner was five Prince. He still felt dissatisfied after he got two dao creation saint stones, because he knew that Imperial Father gave me two dao creation saint stones. “”

“Five Prince thinks that I have two dao creation saint stones. It’s unfair, let me hand it over, I’m still very boneless, so I didn’t give it.”

When Ma Tianhai said that he was very angry, Shen Xiang looked at him with disdain.

“Hey!” Ma Tianhai knew that Shen Xiang was laughing at him. He was really frightened by Shen Xiang before he became like that.

“Well, what happened in the end?” Shen Xiang asked.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“The last five Prince s.n.a.t.c.hed my dao creation saint stone, Imperial Father did not care, no one helped me, because five Prince is the heir to the future emperor, no one wants to offend him.” Ma Tianhai shook his head: “The original five Prince As said, as long as he beats him, he will return the two dao creation saint stones to me. If you can beat him, it is yours, I don’t want to.”

Shen Xiang thought about it and thought it was quite worthwhile, just defeat the five Prince that’s alright.

“What strength is he?” Shen Xiang asked, and he decided to give it a try.
