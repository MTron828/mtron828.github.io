"You’re not bad either. If they chased me like this, I would have been beaten to a pulp a long time ago!" Luo Tianjun didn’t have a Time and space power like Chen Xiang.

Chen Xiang brought him everywhere to teleport. Fortunately, the Myriad Tao Mausoleum was still quite big, but after less than an hour, there were already thousands of holes in the place. The crater that was blasted out was like a huge city, and its depths could not be seen.

"All of you, hold on for a while longer. My array formation will be finished soon." Feng Ke’er said.

"Alright!" Chen Xiang obviously wanted to quickly leave this place and return to the Dan God Mysterious Land. That place would at least be safer.

Murong Honglian watched from the air and had even been tracking Chen Xiang. He wondered if she had returned and was not able to forget about his World Defying Green dragon.

"This guy really has some skills!"

Murong Honglian was born in the World Defying Stage Clan, and was born in the World Defying Stage. However, she had worked hard only to cultivate to the peak of the World Defying Stage’s Sacred Body, so it was still a little difficult for her to cultivate to the Primordial Divine Body. Even though the Four Gold Slaves chasing after Chen Xiang had the Primordial Divine Body, these cold-blooded creatures had no emotions.

Even so, they were still very strong, and Murong Honglian did not dare face them directly. On the other hand, Chen Xiang was able to escape under the berserk chase of the gold slaves without suffering any injuries.

"This guy is called Chen Xiang, he seems to be hiding a very strong strength!" Murong Honglian was suddenly very interested in Chen Xiang, and continued to observe him.

More than two hours had passed, Feng Ke’er had finally set up the array!

"Ride on a Six Realms mirrors and activate that formation. Then, you can leave the Myriad Tao Mausoleum!" Feng Ke’er said.

Chen Xiang immediately took out his Six Realms mirrors and climbed on it with Luo Tianjun. Then, he activated the formation inside, teleported to the edge, and rushed towards the barrier that sealed space and time.

Murong Honglian did not know what Chen Xiang was doing either. She was sure that Chen Xiang was unable to break through this spatial seal, because this spatial seal was created by the Mu Rong family’s powerful arrogant array disc.

Chen Xiang rode on his Six Realms mirrors and rushed towards the spatial seal barrier, and very smoothly flew out!

"He actually went out!" Murong Honglian was extremely shocked, and followed right after.

However, after following her out, she had actually lost her target. She did not sense any spatial fluctuations, so Chen Xiang’s presence was not left behind.

"That woman is really sinister. She actually followed me in secret. I think we should have ditched her now!"

Just now, Chen Xiang had used the Counter Power to completely conceal the entire Six Realms mirrors, and with the seal’s power, he could only hide everything from Murong Honglian.

After they came out, they also saw that huge tiger. The back of the tiger was able to build a villa, so it could be seen how big the tiger was. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

"This guy is from He Clan, right? Just you wait! " Chen Xiang snorted, then left the Myriad Tao Mausoleum. After teleporting a few times, he headed towards the Dan God Mysterious Land.

... ....

"Murong Honglian, you got it?" The young master of the He Clan asked.

"No, he ran away. That guy is not simple, don’t blame me for not telling you!" Murong Honglian smiled sweetly, with her curved eyebrows.

"Are you afraid of him? "I never thought that a famous powerful woman from the Mu Rong family would be afraid of a mortal." The He Clan’s young master could not help but laugh, his laugh was filled with contempt.

"I am not afraid, but I will not do anything that I am not confident in. I am not confident that I can obtain the World Defying Green dragon from him! Of course, I’m sure I can kill him, but what’s the use of killing him? I can’t get a World Defying Green dragon, and I even wasted energy. " Murong Honglian shook his head and sighed. "Do your best, I hope you can get your hands on the World Defying Green dragon as soon as possible!"

Not long after Murong Honglian left, ten or so people appeared, their bodies enveloped in light aura, all of them were extremely powerful, looking at their temperament and clothes, they were the same as the young master of He Clan, and should be disciples of World Defying Stage Clan.

"Everyone disperse, you guys came late." The He Clan Lord snorted, "With your speed, you can only eat shit!"

"You with the surname He, you didn’t get the World Defying Green dragon either, right?" A blue clothed man laughed: "If you get it, with your character, you will definitely go to the sky. But you don’t!"

"That’s right. From what you said just now, it seemed as though you ate your own feces!"

"I can’t be bothered to waste my time with you guys, I’m leaving first!" Then, he made that huge tiger fart towards that group of people, and even spat out a large amount of filth. Who knows what it was ...

After the giant tiger disappeared, the group of World Defying Stage Clan disciples all started to curse.

"This bastard is still the same as ever!"

"One day, I will slaughter that tiger of his!"

"You only know how to fart to us, you impolite fellow!"

These disciples of the World Defying Stage Clan all seemed to have a good relationship with him, but they were not on good terms with him.

"There is Murong Honglian’s Qi here, did she come here before? Could it be that Murong Honglian obtained the World Defying Green dragon when the one with the surname He came back empty-handed? " One of them said while frowning after he sensed Murong Honglian’s remaining presence.

Murong Honglian kept a low profile. Even if she obtained it, she would say that she did not!

"This is troublesome, if Murong Honglian were to obtain it, wouldn’t the Mu Rong family’s strength increase?"

"It must be Murong Honglian’s hands. No one can escape her Red Lotus Time Domain, she must have snatched away the World Defying Green dragon!"

"Return and report that Murong Honglian has snatched away the World Defying Green dragon!"

... ....

Chen Xiang, who had already returned to the Dan God Mysterious Land, naturally did not know that something like this would happen again. If he continued to stay inside, at that time, he would be surrounded and attacked by a group of extremely terrifying World Defying Stage Clan disciples!

"It’s really dangerous!" Although Chen Xiang had returned to the Dan God Mysterious Land, he was still very worried.

There were many methods in the World Defying Stage Clan, and there might be a way to find him hiding here. At that time, it would affect the entire Natural Law World.

"Daofather, you can stay here and train. I can’t stay here for too long." Chen Xiang said. He had already made the absolute decision to stay away from the Dan God Mysterious Land.

Before he left, he had to teach those girls how to refine Tianyuan holy body Dan so that the entire Natural Law World could develop quietly.

"You must be careful!" Luo Tianjun was also relatively safe with Chen Xiang, especially when he knew that Feng Ke’er was accompanied by Feng Ke’er.

"En!"

When Chen Xiang returned to the Hundreds of Flowers Village, he told Lv Qilian and the others about the matters regarding the World Defying Stage Clan so that they could prepare themselves. Then, he filled them with the desire to go to the Incense Garden and told the girls about his experience in refining Tianyuan holy body Dan s as well as went to look for Xue Xianxian and the others, telling them that it would be a while before he could come back.

After he finished dealing with this matter, Chen Xiang immediately left Natural Law World, and went back inside Divine Wasteland!
