Right now, Chen Xiang only needed to wait for Feng Yujie to come out before he could properly discuss how to activate the Regeneration Dan with her.

Seeing Chen Xiang’s smiling face, the oldest Gu did not understand, because they thought that Feng Yujie had given up on the Regeneration Dan s. This was because he could not earn the Shen Yuan stone s’ ingredients and the Regeneration Dan s’ ingredients were all monopolized by the.

"Oh right brat, there’s another rather important matter I need to tell you. It’s the third hall. A young brat called Zhan Xi died." oldest Gu chuckled, "This guy is also said to be a young Alchemist who can refine Zhongpin Dan.

Chen Xiang and Yue’er both knew what was going on because Zhan Xi was the one who was killed by Chen Xiang.

"How did such a good seedling die?" Chen Xiang asked in surprise.

"What’s so strange about that? There’s nothing strange about the divine medicine? Even if ten or eight Supreme Gods die, it wouldn’t be anything strange." The oldest Gu said, "Right now, the hall masters of the three halls have already investigated. It’s hard to say whether or not they know the cause of death."

Chen Xiang nodded his head. He was sure that he did not leave any traces behind when he killed Zhan Xi, so that way, he would not be found out. Before, he was still worried that Zhang Zhuo’s matter would be found out, but after such a long period of time, the Sword Hall seemed to have already given up on pursuing him.

However, this Zhan Xi was somewhat different. A young Alchemist like him had a very high status in the Supreme Divine Palace.

Three Gu Brothers only returned to his room to rest for a few hours before running out in the middle of the night. During this time, they had been very busy preparing for the upcoming Large Competition.

Chen Xiang only waited two days before Feng Yujie came out from the secret underground room to look at her smile. He knew that she had used the method Chen Xiang taught her to successfully refine the Regeneration Dan.

"I can only refine six pills now. I need to refine seven pills after I become familiar with them," Feng Yujie said very happily. She passed the Regeneration Dan over to Chen Xiang and then ran into the bathroom to shower.

Knowing that there were two great beauties bathing and playing inside, Chen Xiang couldn’t help but think about it and wanted to join in the fun ... ...

"There are still seven to eight days before the other powers’ disciples will arrive outside the Supreme Divine Palace one by one. That guy’s Regeneration Dan will rise to one million and five hundred thousand ... Although they’re selling for that price right now, no one has bought it yet," said Chen Xiang as he combed his hair after he finished showering.

As soon as she hear the news, she understand what have happen

"The person who refined the Regeneration Dan was a short boy named Hua Yang, the other one was a tall and sturdy boy called Chu Xiang. These two guys have a very good relationship with each other, their Alchemy skills are very good," Feng Yujie said. "It seems like they plan to take advantage of this opportunity and earn a bit. They plan to sell the Regeneration Dan to the stronger disciples.

Chen Xiang nodded his head, "So when the time comes, the disciples of the various powers will need to reserve some healing pellets and this Regeneration Dan will definitely be favored by many disciples."

"We need to hurry up and get some Spirit Orbs," Feng Yujie said, "We have all successfully refined a batch of Regeneration Dan." Feng Yujie said, "We all successfully refined a batch of Spirit Orbs," Feng Yujie said, "We all successfully refined a batch of Regeneration Dan.

was very angry. She never wanted to get even with these brats, but now, she felt like she was being bullied ...

"Let’s rest a bit before we go to the secret room to refine pills," Feng Yujie gave Chen Xiang a signal. They did not only want to refine pills, they also wanted to condense spirit pearls to duplicate medicinal ingredients.

Feng Yujie said to Yue’er, "Yue’er, take a good look at her icy face. Don’t let her run around randomly. During this period of time, Supreme Divine Palace will be rather complicated. Just let her stay in the courtyard."

Shui Bingyan obediently said: "Big sister, I will definitely not run around. You don’t have to worry about me and just concoct pills with Elder Brother Shen."

Seeing that Shui Bingyan was obedient, Feng Yujie smiled in relief and stroked her face, bringing out some delicious fruits for her to eat.

Because of lack of time, Chen Xiang and Feng Yujie immediately went to the basement.

"Little Scoundrel, we only have one portion of Regeneration Dan’s medicinal pellets left. If we want to copy one of those, then we won’t have much spirit liquid that you and I can cultivate alone, right? And the maximum we can condense is six spirit pellets a day." Feng Yujie bit her lower lip and her beautiful face blushed as she glanced at Chen Xiang bashfully.

Chen Xiang felt that her reaction was a little strange and said: "Not bad, at least a few days will be enough for us to make a few batches of Regeneration Dan’s medicinal herbs. If every batch is a success, we will have dozens of Regeneration Dan’s pellets."

Hearing Chen Xiang’s words, Feng Yujie’s beautiful face became even redder: "Little Scoundrel, do you think it will be better if you join us to cultivate our spiritual pearls at a deeper level?"

Only now did Chen Xiang understand that Feng Yujie’s reaction speed had also increased a lot: "This ... ... "That’s for sure. Now we can ..."

Without waiting for him to finish speaking, Feng Yujie pounced over and gagged him with sandalwood. Then, she heard Feng Yujie’s gentle and gentle voice in her mind, "I’ll give you everything.

Chen Xiang did not answer Feng Yujie and did not need him to make any promises, because Chen Xiang had been extremely helpful to her during this period of time.

In the basement, Chen Xiang and Feng Yujie were one body and mind, and the two of them had Supreme god bone. This combination would bring them a much better harvest ...

Chen Xiang carried the mission of saving the Nine Divine Kings, so he had been of great help to Jiu Hanrou. In the future, because of the pressure of saving the enemies that the Nine Divine Kings would face, Chen Xiang would have an even bigger chance of winning against the reserved Feng Yujie.

... ....

The two of them naturally woke up. It was late at night and they didn’t know how much time had passed ... ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

"Ten purple pearls .... Feng Yujie had seen the purple pearls that Chen Xiang and the others condensed when they were cultivating together, but they were all relatively large. Although she and Chen Xiang had condensed out ten purple pearls, they were only the size of a grain of rice ...

Chen Xiang looked at the color of the purple pearls, then used his Spirit Eyes to look at the energy inside, and exclaimed in joy, "Although it is small, the effects are not weak at all."
