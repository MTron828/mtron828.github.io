Chen Xiang stayed in the Soul Swallowing Mountain for three months, and at the same time, used the Time Domain, allowing him to make a breakthrough into the Peak of World Defying crazy realm.

"Could it be that it’s because he’s been trapped inside and roasted by the flames for a very long time that the aura of the flames on his body is that strong?" There were quite a few people outside watching.

"It’s possible that it is. After being locked up for a month, his World Defying Stage Fierce Soul has basically been devoured. However, the Soul Swallowing Mountain’s flames are very mystical. It’s likely that he absorbed a lot of these flames to cultivate."

Everyone began guessing.

The person who released Chen Xiang was obviously Lei Yichen, he got the array disc that was able to open the gate of the Soul Swallowing Mountain from the Ancient Fire Divine Sect, which was why Chen Xiang was able to come out.

"Why did you let me out?" Chen Xiang asked in confusion. He looked at Huang Ziyun, who had followed him here, and revealed a face full of hatred.

Lei Yichen said in a low voice: "I am an elder of the inner sect. After I found out about your matter, I wanted to accept you as my disciple.

Huang Ziyun walked over at this time, and said with a cold smile. "Lei Yichen, it’s not like you don’t know the rules of Ancient Fire Divine Sect! With his current strength, he doesn’t even have the qualifications to become an outer court disciple, not to mention an inner court disciple. "

"If you want to take him in as your inner sect disciple, that would be breaking the rules that our Ancient Fire Divine Sect has had for many years." Huang Ziyun laughed coldly: "If someone like you could easily enough make a person become an inner disciple of the Ancient Fire Divine Sect, then the level of the inner disciples of our Ancient Fire Divine Sect would very easily drop. Read the full text of the latest chapter "

Everyone nodded their heads, in fact, they were also very jealous of Chen Xiang. For an inner sect elder to place so much importance on him, they had to go to the Leader to personally get the array disc needed to open the Soul Swallowing Mountain’s seal.

Lei Yichen clenched his fists tightly and did not say anything: "What I mean is that when he becomes stronger, I will let him enter the inner sect and become my disciple. Now, I can help him recover his cultivation."

Huang Ziyun laughed out loud, "Lei Yichen, you should know the rules of our Ancient Fire Divine Sect better than I do. Chen Xiang doesn’t have the World Defying Stage Fierce Soul, with his little strength right now, he doesn’t even have the qualifications to become an outer disciple.

"Bullshit!" Chen Xiang who had been silent the entire time suddenly roared loudly, causing Huang Ziyun to be greatly shocked.

"Chen Xiang, you are too presumptuous! Forget it, now that you are no longer the disciple of our Ancient Fire Divine Sect, I will properly take care of you. " Huang Ziyun thought about his own grandson, who was crippled by Chen Xiang, and became furious. He immediately rushed over.

Lei Yichen stood in front of Chen Xiang, blocking his charge, and said coldly: "Huang Ziyun, you are not my opponent, you should be clear about the strength between you and me, don’t think that you can act tyrannically just by being able to cover the sky with one hand, I, Lei Yichen, am not afraid of you."

Huang Ziyun indeed stopped in front of Lei Yichen, he did not dare to fight with him.

"The rules of the Ancient Fire Divine Sect cannot be broken! Chen Xiang must leave the Ancient Fire Divine Sect!" Huang Ziyun said: "We Ancient Fire Divine Sect do not accept weak people like him. This will waste our resources."

"Disciples, what do you say?" Huang Ziyun turned around and shouted to the spectating outer sect disciples.

The disciples all nodded, and many of them spoke out, saying that Chen Xiang was not fit to stay in the Ancient Fire Divine Sect.

"Chen Xiang, quickly go, don’t be so thick-skinned as to stay in Ancient Fire Divine Sect."

"Exactly, I’m able to discern that you want to receive a medicinal pill every month, right?"

"Wasting our Ancient Fire Divine Sect’s resources!"

Hearing everyone’s words, Huang Ziyun was very satisfied, and then sneered: "Chen Xiang, Lei Yichen, you all heard it!"

"I’m weak? Is that little tyrant grandson of yours really that strong? "Why don’t you pull him out and compare him to me? Let’s see who’s stronger." Chen Xiang sneered: "That grandson of yours is definitely weak as well. According to the rules of the Ancient Fire Divine Sect, he should get lost with me!"

After Chen Xiang finished speaking, just like how Huang Ziyun was before, he spoke loudly to the rest: "Am I right?"

But Huang Ziyun was still an elder, they definitely could not go along with Chen Xiang, if not they would definitely get revenge on them by Huang Ziyun.

Seeing that no one spoke, Chen Xiang sneered: "You bully the weak and fear the strong, you all deserve to be offered up as Soul body madness Dan s all the time, and live your entire lives in the outer sect being treated like dogs. Just with this little bit of potential of yours, you all have been bullied by those little overlords all your lives, because your bones are filled with a sense of servility."

Everyone was enraged by Chen Xiang’s scolding.

"You don’t even have World Defying Stage Fierce Soul, what confidence do you have to say those words to us? If it wasn’t for Elder Lei protecting you, you definitely wouldn’t even dare to fart. "

"Exactly, you weak chicken!" At least we have the World Defying Stage Fierce Soul, we are stronger than you! Don’t you understand that the strong are respected? We are stronger than you, so you should respect us! "

Lei Yichen felt that this scene was extremely interesting, especially Chen Xiang’s performance, which made him extremely surprised and not arrogant at all!

"Haha, I’m a weak chicken? Even if laozi did not have the World Defying Stage Fierce Soul, I would still be able to destroy you bunch of cowards. " Chen Xiang laughed out loud: "You, come out here. You call me a weak chicken, do you dare to fight with me? It’s right here! "

Chen Xiang pointed at a middle-aged man dressed in black.

"Why would I not dare!" The black clothed middle aged man stood out. Chen Xiang had been locked in the Soul Swallowing Mountain for three months, so the World Defying Stage Fierce Soul must have been devoured by the Soul Swallowing Mountain. Without the World Defying Stage Fierce Soul, he couldn’t even be considered a World Defying crazy realm, so he felt that he could definitely win against Chen Xiang.

"Yun Rong, you’re from the Peak of World Defying crazy realm, you should be a bit more gentle with him. If you beat him to death, he wouldn’t be able to get out of the Ancient Fire Divine Sect, we have to see him get lost with our own eyes."

"Spare his dog life. Let him know what it means to be the supreme expert."

"Yun Rong, don’t end it so soon.

Everyone laughed.

Yun Rong was from the Peak of World Defying crazy realm, and had four World Defying Stage Fierce Soul s. He was very sure that Chen Xiang did not have one, so he was not worried at all.

Chen Xiang was also currently a Peak of World Defying crazy realm, and amongst those of the same level, he wasn’t afraid of anyone.

"Come!" Chen Xiang snorted.

Yun Rong boldly rushed forward. He felt that if he could teach Chen Xiang a lesson and cripple him, Huang Ziyun would definitely give him a lot of rewards.

Because Huang Ziyun hated Chen Xiang to the core. Right now, the only thing he wanted to do was to make Chen Xiang’s World Defying Stage Fierce Soul disappear, so Chen Xiang was still alive and kicking. Furthermore, it wouldn’t be difficult for him to fuse with the World Defying Stage Fierce Soul again in the future.
