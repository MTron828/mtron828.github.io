Xue Xianxian and Leng Youlan were extremely cautious, upon sensing that someone was coming, they hurriedly put away the Goblin Egg in their hands and revealed their weapons, but they very quickly realized that it was Chen Xiang and immediately threw themselves into Chen Xiang’s embrace.

"Bro, you scared the hell out of me." Leng Youlan hugged one of Chen Xiang’s arm and rubbed it with her cheek.

"How can you, a white-haired female tyrant, be so easily frightened?" Chen Xiang laughed, kissed her forehead, then looked towards Xue Xianxian who was in his embrace and softly said: "I’m fine. What are you guys doing here?

Leng Youlan immediately said angrily: "These bastards, they actually refused to let go no matter what. If it wasn’t for their numbers, I would have gone out and cut them into pieces and fed them to the dogs!"

Xue Xianxian sighed: "Youlan and I are carrying out a mission for the academy, to capture a profound beast and bring it back so that they can use it to test the students who are registering. We searched for a long time but to no avail, we actually found two demon beast eggs, those are Flame Dragon Eagle’s eggs!"

"It’s actually a Flame Dragon Eagle’s egg." Chen Xiang opened his eyes wide and took a deep breath, "It is said that this thing was born a ninth stage spirit beast. When it grows up, it will definitely be a profound beast!"

Leng Youlan snorted: "That group of turtle eggs only wanted to snatch them from us when they saw us holding them. At that time, they almost stole their eggs from us, and we fought with them once, but we can’t put them in our storage rings. They’re too much of a hindrance, otherwise we wouldn’t be afraid of them!"

With that said, Leng Youlan was about to walk out, holding a large sword made of white jade dragon bone, releasing an icy cold Qi. With Chen Xiang here, what was there for her to be afraid of.

"You Lan, let me do it. I just came out of that Stellar Transposition Realm, so my power has increased a lot. I want to see how strong I am." Chen Xiang anxiously pulled Leng Youlan.

Leng Youlan’s eyes lit up, and laughed heartily: "Brother, you just have to find me if you want to train, those small fries will only waste your strength, I only just came out from the Stellar Transposition Realm, Sister Xianxian and I have stayed here for twenty years, and we are already at the middle stage of the Soul Martial Realm, and we have even reached the tenth level!"

Chen Xiang was immediately dumbstruck, "Devil Subduing Method tenth level, middle stage of the Soul Martial Realm!"

Moreover, their own aptitudes were not bad, and the martial arts they learned were divine arts. As for the Devil Subduing Method, they had the foundation of the Taiji magic kungfu, so it would not be difficult for them to learn the tenth floor in twenty years. Back then, it took him one month to reach the tenth floor.

"What? I don’t believe it. If it wasn’t for protecting this egg, this lady would have taken care of that bunch of trash by herself." Leng Youlan said proudly.

"Stupid girl, don’t call yourself ’old lady’ in front of your big brother." Chen Xiang laughed and scolded, pinching Leng Youlan’s face: "I’m at the early stage of the Soul Martial Realm now, but if I really want to play, you are still not my opponent, my Dragon Power is getting stronger and stronger!"

When she mentioned the Dragon Power, Leng Youlan stuck out her tongue, afraid of the terrifying power.

Xue Xianxian chuckled, she pulled Leng Youlan and let Chen Xiang out.

After knowing that the strength of the two girls had increased so quickly, Chen Xiang was extremely happy. When he arrived at the entrance of the cave, he found that there were a few stones piled up in front of him.

"Who are our people?" Chen Xiang asked.

"The seniors from the intermediate academy. Back then, when we were at the primary academy, they bullied us to the point that we couldn’t take it anymore. Now, they are just a fart in this lady’s eyes." She had learned the tenth level of Devil Subduing Method and was also training in the Icewind magic kungfu, so she naturally had the right to say such words.

Chen Xiang punched the stone wall, causing it to shake with a boom. The stone walls immediately shattered into pieces and flew outwards, every piece of stone carried Chen Xiang’s dense Innate Qi, densely hitting onto the stone wall, instantly pushing the twenty people back by a hundred steps.

These people were all students of the intermediate academy, which meant that their strength was at least at the early stage of the Soul Martial Realm.

"It’s Chen Xiang." A man who had seen Chen Xiang before cried out in alarm, his expression changing greatly. He still vividly remembered the incident where Chen Xiang killed that Principal.

Chen Xiang’s eyes flashed with a ruthless killing intent, his gaze swept across the 20 people. Among these people, there were a few extremely beautiful women, but he would not be lenient towards any of them.

"It’s this group of people. They want to kill us and steal the Flame Dragon Eagle’s eggs." Leng Youlan said angrily.

"There are only three of them. Although they are very strong, we have more than twenty people and we will definitely be able to take them down. Chen Xiang is a fugitive from Devil-subduing College, we must kill him." a man said.

"I’ll pass Chen Xiang and Xue Xianxian to you, the white-haired demoness will be taken care of by us." A woman sneered, her seductive eyes filled with viciousness.

"You bitches, if I hadn’t promised my brother I would have hung you naked on a tree and whipped you." Leng Youlan was instantly enraged and scolded.

Chen Xiang inhaled slightly, and the power of the Universe within his body surged crazily, converging into a vicious Dragon Power. The five fingers on his hands were filled with Dragon Power s with white clouds. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Just as everyone was shocked by his terrifying Dragon Power, his feet slipped and his steps became quick and profound. His body dragged a long afterimage, and a deep gully opened at the places he passed.

In the blink of an eye, he had already arrived in front of a woman in a blue dress. The palm of his hand, which was condensed with a fierce Dragon Power, was filled with the power of a thunderbolt as it tore through the air and blasted outwards. Ten earth-shaking thunderbolts struck the woman’s chest.

The Dragon Power combined with the power of the tenth level of the Devil Subduing Method, it was truly Chen Xiang’s strongest strength. That strong and concentrated strength was like a transparent and huge sharp spear that tyrannically pierced the body of the blue dressed woman. A wave of bloody mist surged out from the woman’s back, and filled the air.

It’s not over yet. After the force Chen Xiang released from his palm pierced through the woman’s body, his aura was still shocking, as though it was sweeping through everything. It continued to shoot forward, and in the blink of an eye, another huge bloody hole was opened up in the chest of another man, which came out through his back.

In just an instant, two Soul Martial Realm warriors were killed by Chen Xiang. Their methods were overbearing and cruel, their moves were fast and ruthless, their imposing manner was like thunder, causing people to be extremely fearful.
