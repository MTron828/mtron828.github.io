Du Hai and the others had only just arrived in Holy City, they did not take a stroll around. After that, Li Baojun followed Du Hai and said that he would go and register to take the test for a Gold rank Alchemist, then refine pills at the Long family’s shop to earn some Spiritual crystal and the like.

Lv Qinlian then said that he had some private matters to take care of and left the Long family in a hurry.

"Qianqian, you followed her, you didn’t suffer, did you? After not seeing you for so long, you have become more and more good-looking. Chen Xiang smiled at Wu Qianqian.

"Elder sister Xiangyue treats me very well!" On the other hand, you’re still the same as always, always getting yourself into trouble wherever you go. " Wu Qianqian gently smiled, looking extremely beautiful.

"Not only can you get into trouble, you can also take advantage of the situation! If not for being together with the Demon Empress, I still wouldn’t know that your relationship with her was actually this good, as well as the Yan Zilan and Du Yanyao within the Zi Lan Mountain Valley. I think this Dragon Subduing Leader of yours should be changed to the Goddess Leader! " Hua Xiangyue snorted, his voice carried a bit of jealousy.

"They are my friends, not what you think! Besides, it’s also because of my charm. If I wasn’t so capable, would I have been able to befriend them? " Chen Xiang hurriedly explained. Even though he had those thoughts, he was a man after all, so it was impossible for him to not have evil intentions when facing beauties.

There were a lot of beautiful women by Chen Xiang’s side, but the only one who had a relationship with him was his real wife, Xue Xianxian.

"Qianqian, you’re getting more and more fragrant!" Chen Xiang took a deep breath after he finished speaking, "Last time it was all thanks to you helping me."

Wu Qianqian smiled, "Why are you being so courteous to me? That’s what you used to tell me! "

"You are looking down on me in front of me, aren’t you!" Hua Xiangyue intentionally pouted and said, she knew what Wu Qianqian thought of Chen Xiang, and she could not stop him from doing so.

"Little girl Xiangyue, are you hinting at me to teach you a lesson?" Chen Xiang sent a sound transmission to Hua Xiangyue evilly.

"Master, I’m so scared ..." Hua Xiangyue chuckled as she transmitted her voice to Chen Xiang.

However, with Wu Qianqian here, he felt a little embarrassed, and suddenly felt that he was the Leader. In terms of strength and identity, he should be on equal footing with Hua Xiangyue, the Leader, so it wouldn’t be a problem to do it openly.

Hua Xiangyue had always been the Elder Dan, so Wu Qianqian understood the dubious relationship between her and Chen Xiang in the Super Dan Imperial College the best. Moreover, she had followed Hua Xiangyue for a period of time, so she was very clear about the relationship between Hua Xiangyue and him.

At night, no one else came back, and Chen Xiang, along with Wu Qianqian and the others, discussed the experience they gained from refining pills for an entire day. Although he could only refine high grade Ground level pills, his experience was extremely valuable to Hua Xiangyue and Wu Qianqian.

Wu Qianqian was now able to refine a middle grade Ground level pill! Previously, Wu Qianqian had obtained a fortuitous encounter, and after eating the mysterious fruit, all aspects of it had increased. Furthermore, there was a White flame heavenly horse, she had also mentioned before, that she could rely on the White flame heavenly horse to level up her own Fire Soul, and turn it into a white Fire Soul.

Chen Xiang returned to his room, but his mind was currently filled with the demon’s figure. He released his divine power and sent a sound transmission to Hua Xiangyue: "Little Flower Demon, quickly come and help me take a bath!"

"I’m not going. I’m training with Qianqian and I’ve discovered that after my Purple Moon Fire Soul and her Blue Star Fire Soul fuse, it can help her increase the level of her Fire Soul!" Hua Xiangyue replied.

"So that’s how it is. If dual cultivation is faster!" Let me help her! " Chen Xiang said sincerely.

"Little scoundrel, your mind is filled with this!" Hua Xiangyue laughed, "I don’t object to the relationship between you and Qianqian, but you can’t force the matter either. A woman’s first time is very important, leave me with a beautiful memory!"

Hua Xiangyue also knew that Chen Xiang was the more honest one. Although he had interacted with many beauties before, the only ones who truly interacted with him was her and Wu Qianqian.

"Alright!" "Wait a moment, I will wait upon you." After Hua Xiangyue finished speaking, he stopped his cultivation and left Wu Qianqian’s room, allowing him to cultivate on his own.

Inside the bathing area, Chen Xiang and Hua Xiangyue’s smooth and jade-like bodies were wrapped around each other as they carelessly rubbed each other’s hands. As the two people passionately kissed, the flirtatious Hua Xiangyue would occasionally let out a coquettish cry, making Chen Xiang’s evil fire burn even more vigorously.

Chen Xiang crazily caressed the beautiful woman’s flawless body, gasping for breath, "Little demoness, I missed you so much!"

"Hmph, I didn’t know that you would be so rude ..." Hua Xiangyue tenderly shouted, and then the water in the bathing area started to swirl in waves ...

Hua Xiangyue and Chen Xiang had not made love for a very long time as well, and only after the two of them had played around for a long time did they enter the dual cultivation state.

"Little Scoundrel, why is your Dantian so strange?" Hua Xiangyue laid on Chen Xiang’s chest, her slightly flushed and seductive face revealing a shocked expression.

After dual cultivating, Hua Xiangyue’s cultivation had increased by a lot, and her Fire Soul had also become a little stronger. She did not know what level Chen Xiang’s Fire Soul was, to actually be able to cause her Purple Moon Fire Soul to become so powerful.

Chen Xiang hugged the jade man and laughed: "This is the benefit of being a pair cultivator! If you go up higher, your Purple Moon Fire Soul should be able to turn into a white Fire Soul. If we come here often, it shouldn’t take long! "

When he dual cultivated, not only would it help Hua Xiangyue improve his strength and quality of Fire Soul, but because Chen Xiang had the Yulong blood, it would also slowly allow Hua Xiangyue to have the bloodline.

At dawn, Hua Xiangyue came out of Chen Xiang’s room feeling refreshed. When Wu Qianqian was dancing sword in the courtyard, she saw Hua Xiangyue’s face and knew where Hua Xiangyue, who had left last night, had gone to. She did not expect that Hua Xiangyue and Chen Xiang had developed such a relationship, so she could only sigh in her heart.

"Qianqian, this brat has a lot of high grade Ground level pills ingredients, it’s rare to be together with him, you better waste some of his ingredients and refine a high grade Ground level pill here!" Hua Xiangyue tidied up Wu Qianqian’s messy hair as if he was treating his own little sister.

"Hm!" "Elder sister Xiangyue, you must have slept quite well last night. You must be in such good spirits!" Wu Qianqian joked, her beautiful eyes full of flirtatiousness.

"Stupid girl, you’re getting bolder and bolder!" Hua Xiangyue said with a red face.

"Elder sister Xiangyue, I didn’t say anything. Why are you being so sensitive?" Wu Qianqian laughed.

Chen Xiang and Hua Xiangyue had indeed slept soundly last night, especially Chen Xiang. He had been so nervous this entire time, and last night had been his most relaxed night.

Chen Xiang walked into the courtyard and saw Hua Xiangyue and Wu Qianqian playing, so he asked: "Little girl Xiang Yue, what is your relationship with the Purple Moon Imperial Land?"
