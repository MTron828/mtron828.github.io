Chen Xiang never thought that he would find the clues of the Devil-suppressing blood so quickly.

"Have you heard about the Devil-suppressing Heavenly Venerable’s remains?" Chen Xiang calmed his agitated heart. he asked.

"No, no one has ever heard of him, we only know about the matters of the Devil-suppressing Heavenly Venerable. He had come to the Sacred Dan Realm many years ago, and no one knew what he would do at that time." Du Yanyao shook her head.

Seeing that Chen Xiang was so interested in the ruins of the Devil-suppressing Heavenly Venerable, Du Yanyao became even more curious about Chen Xiang’s origins, but she did not ask any further.

"Young Master Shen, do you really have a wife? She’s very good, isn’t she? " Du Yanyao’s voice was somewhat low.

Chen Xiang sighed in his heart, scratched his head and said: "Actually, I am also not a good person. So far, there is only one woman who is famous with me, in addition ... And two lovers. "

Du Yanyao sighed: "It’s normal for a strong man to have more women by his side. My mother is my father’s eighteenth woman!"

"If you don’t talk about this, I will think of a way to go into the depths of Immortal-poisoning Devil Forest and find your grandfather. At that time, you won’t have to marry that bastard." Chen Xiang smiled.

"No need, I’ll just hide when the time comes. You can’t go in there and take the risk, who knows if my grandpa is really inside!" Du Yanyao shook her head.

Chen Xiang did not want to talk about it anymore, he was determined to go. There were Devil-suppressing blood inside, he had to go in and take a look no matter what.

"Right, is there any reward for the competition of the Saint Pill Assembly?" Chen Xiang asked.

"Of course there are, that is the mysterious reward provided by the Sacred Dan School, it will be announced during the conference. This conference happens once every hundred years, and there are a lot of Alchemist participating, so the reward will definitely not be too bad!" A rare sweet smile appeared on Du Yanyao’s face once again, "Young Master Shen, don’t ever think of obtaining that reward, you have to win against me!" Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Following that, Chen Xiang asked many questions about the Sacred Dan Realm, and Du Yanyao patiently answered them all. In the end, she even discussed some alchemy experiences with Chen Xiang, which benefited both of them.

As the sky darkened, Du Yanyao said: "You can stay in the City Lord’s Mansion. If that’s the case, Xie Donghao still won’t dare to act recklessly here.

Just like this, Chen Xiang stayed in the City Lord’s Mansion. Du Yanyao knew that Chen Xiang was a Alchemist, so she provided him with an extremely secluded, secret room.

Chen Xiang was deep down in her stone room. Just as she came out from her shower, she saw Su Meiyao lying on her stone bed, wearing a thin layer of white silk clothing, everything inside was faintly discernible, and she was actually wearing something inside. Worse still, this peerless beauty was still maintaining a coquettish and flirtatious attitude, her eyes were like silk, her small mouth was slightly opened, and her charming smile made Chen Xiang feel like her soul had left her body.

"sister Meiyao, don’t you play with fire!" Chen Xiang took a deep breath and walked over.

"Elder sister, I just want to see how much charm you have when comparing with that Yanyao. I also want to test your mental fortitude!" Su Meiyao smiled flirtatiously.

Chen Xiang walked onto the stone bed and held Su Meiyao down, then smiled sinisterly: "You are my wife, what mental fortitude do I need? Even if I eat you, I won’t feel that it’s not enough! "

As he spoke, he gently rubbed one of Su Meiyao’s snow breasts across the thin and transparent silk dress.

"Little Scoundrel, I was only worried that you’d be bored to death, so I gave you a taste, don’t be too excessive!" My body is very weak right now, and I can’t take your pain! " Su Meiyao said intimately. That kind of voice caused Chen Xiang’s bones to go numb, and with a flip of his body, Su Meiyao laid on top of him.

"sister Meiyao is so considerate!" As Chen Xiang spoke, he moved his lips closer to her and passionately kissed her. A pair of large hands were moving around her flawless body, stroking it through the thin layer of cloth, giving him a different feeling.

After the passion passed, Chen Xiang hugged the beauty and fell asleep. Su Meiyao also laid in his embrace, listening to the heartbeat of her little man.

On the second day, Chen Xiang greeted Du Yanyao and said that he would be cultivating pellets in seclusion, and was preparing to participate in the convention. After that, he hurriedly returned to the basement, took out his Yanlong furnace, and began refining pills.

The profoundyang fire Dan he was refining now, he wanted to be more familiar with it. The last time he succeeded was all because of the competition, and under those circumstances, it was normal for him to be able to excel in it.

When he familiarized himself with refining profoundyang fire Dan, he would then be able to start refining other high grade profound level pills. As long as he mastered three of them, he would be able to basically refine pills of the same level.

Now that he had clues about the Devil-suppressing blood, he was not that nervous. He was just considering whether or not he should go into the Immortal-poisoning Devil Forest now to find Du Yanyao’s grandfather.

"We will be leaving after refining two more batches of profoundyang fire Dan. Hopefully, we will be able to rush back to participate in the Sacred Pill Assembly."

Chen Xiang was concocting pills in the secret room, but at this time, there were many people in the Sacred Dan City who were inquiring about him. They wanted to know where he came from, but to no avail.

Du Yanyao had already helped Chen Xiang to register to participate in the Sacred Pill Assembly. Although she would be competing with Chen Xiang later on, she was filled with anticipation.

He had already successfully refined five batches of profoundyang fire Dan. Although he failed three times, it allowed him to have a better grasp of the refining process of profoundyang fire Dan.

It was night, and Chen Xiang was standing outside Du Yanyao’s door. After Du Yanyao opened it, he hurriedly said: "Yanyao, I have something to do, so I need to leave for a bit. If I don’t return in time to participate in the Pill Assembly’s pill refining competition, then you don’t need to wait for me."

Du Yanyao did not ask further, she only sighed lightly and nodded: "Be careful."

Chen Xiang smiled at him, then quickly left. He turned into a black butterfly in a place no one saw him in the City Lord’s Mansion, and flew out of the City Lord’s Mansion in the night. At the entrance of the City Lord’s Mansion, he could see a few people in charge of following him.

Not long after, he left the Sacred Dan City. What made him extremely shocked was that around the City Lord’s Mansion, there were actually many people watching. He felt that they were definitely the people Xie Donghao sent.

Back then, when he was opposing Xie Donghao, Xie Donghao had already treated him like a dead person. Once he found the opportunity, he would definitely not let Chen Xiang go, especially when he thought about how Du Yanyao would look at him with such tender eyes, he felt so jealous that he could bleed in his heart.

"Did you find out where he came from?" Xie Donghao asked.

"We only found out that he killed Second City Lord and a few of his followers inside the City Lord’s Mansion. Furthermore, his attacks were very fierce, and he shouldn’t be weak. How long has it been since we couldn’t even find his name?!" An old man said.
