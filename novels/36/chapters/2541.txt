Just as he had expected, this cow beast ran to the caves of other beasts and started fighting after it entered. In just a short moment, several beasts were killed by this cow beast.

The people of Heaven Wasteland Aristocratic Family did not notice anything strange, even when they heard the sound, they only thought that some humans had entered the canyon, and were secretly happy.

Yet, they didn’t know that it was their own caged savage beast that started the massacre!

"The contract’s power forbids these savage beasts from attacking one another and allows only strangers to attack. Thus, when the other savage beasts were attacked by this bull, none of them dared to retaliate." Xu Youqing said, she had already deciphered the contents of the contract.

"Hehe, it’s just as I expected!" Chen Xiang laughed, "Looks like it won’t be long before all the beasts in this valley are killed."

Chen Xiang waited for more than an hour. The whole cow beast that was as big as a small mountain was already covered in beast blood, and when he rushed out of the canyon, he did not know where he was going to.

Chen Xiang went down to collect all the corpses of the other savage beasts. After that, he headed towards the place where everyone was resting and told everyone about the situation in the canyon.

He just said that the cow had gone mad, killed the other savage beasts, and eaten the corpse of the savage beast.

The gorge wasn’t too far from here. Previously, there had been a series of roars, so everyone was still skeptical.

Even though there were a few small teams who were not afraid of death, after confirming that it was true and sending the Communication jade Symbol paper back to the camp, everyone was overjoyed, and they all headed over.

After about two hours, they passed through the great canyon and entered the Sacred Tao Mountains!

The Sacred Tao Mountains was generally safe, but it was more difficult to enter from the beginning as there was a natural barrier.

And Chen Xiang was already inside the Sacred Tao Mountains.

The Sacred Tao Mountains was very big and had a natural barrier, so only a few paths inside were relatively easier, but all of them were blocked by the Heaven Wasteland Aristocratic Family. It could be seen that the Heaven Wasteland Aristocratic Family wanted to monopolize the Sacred Tao Mountains and let them take all the medicinal ingredients inside.

"Yue Er, it’s your turn!" Yue’er could communicate with the stars in the sky and quickly find the herbs here. The Sacred Tao Mountains was so big, so if he wanted to find the precious herbs here, he would need a lot of time.

"Alright!" Yue’er had just woken up. When she was in You Yao Mountain Villa, she would sometimes turn into a little girl.

Yue’er stood on top of Chen Xiang’s palm and her butt faced Chen Xiang as she smiled: "I do not guarantee that I will be able to hook up with the stars here. It was fine when I was in Hundreds of Flowers Village, but that is New Eight Wastelands, I do not know about this Sacred Wasteland."

"Sacred Wasteland is currently on top of the New Eight Wastelands, but the location is a little hidden, so they share the same sky." Chen Xiang smacked Yue’er’s furry little butt, "Let’s try it quickly!"

It was almost dark now, and the clear sky was filled with twinkling stars.

After that, she closed her eyes and started to communicate with the stars in the sky. A short while later, her body started to emit a faint silvery-white light, and Chen Xiang knew that she had succeeded.

"There are many herbs in this Sacred Tao Mountains!" Yue Er said.

"Where are they?" Chen Xiang asked quickly.

"There are many medicinal materials, but not many high level ones. There are three Emperor level ones, about five high level one King level ones, and the rest are all low level ones. You should not be interested in them." Yue Er said.

"Alright, bring me there quickly." Chen Xiang said. From the looks of it, the quantity was relatively small but in reality, there were a lot of them.

Under Yue’er’s guidance, Chen Xiang found a piece of Ginseng. This was an Emperor Stage medicinal herb, he didn’t know what it was called, but it was very special, as though it was carved out of blood jade, about half the height of a person, and it was very, very heavy.

"I really want to take a bite!" Yue’er smiled while drooling.

"When you grow them, they will make you puke!" Chen Xiang put the Emperor Stage Ginseng into the You Yao Mountain Villa, and let Chu Hongqing grow it.

Yue’er guided Chen Xiang on his search for other medicinal herbs. He found five types of high-grade king level medicinal herbs, two of which contained profound Tao Power s, while the other three he did not know.

Chen Xiang didn’t know what it was either, but after testing it with his Heavenly magic sword, he found it to be extremely hard and hard to split. With this degree of tenacity, he could finally use it to refine medicine.

It was buried underground, and Chen Xiang had to dig around for a bit longer before he finally dug it out. It looked like a potato, but after he removed the dirt on the surface, it released a golden glow, and the inside was a golden crystal. It looked exquisite and beautiful.

"Is this really a medicinal herb?" No matter how you look at it, it looks like ore! " Chen Xiang bit down, of course he wouldn’t be able to. These Di Class medicinal ingredients were all very hard.

"There’s someone over there!"

When Chen Xiang heard these words, a few people suddenly appeared. All of them were from the Heaven Wasteland Aristocratic Family.

"Brat, this is our Heaven Wasteland Aristocratic Family’s territory, quickly hand over the thing in your hands." a man shouted. It was a young man.

Chen Xiang looked at the few of them, the strongest was the man who talked the most, being at the tenth stage of the Dao Po realm.

"If you defeat me, I’ll give it to you." Chen Xiang put away the golden "potato" and smiled.

"This is as simple as turning my hand. You’re merely at the second level of the Dao Soul Realm, and yet you’re so arrogant to say such words." The man at the tenth level of the Dao Po realm sneered: "Furthermore, I am a disciple of the Heaven Wasteland Aristocratic Family, I’ll send you to your death right now."

Chen Xiang laughed: "Don’t hit me so hard. If I die, the Emperor Stage medicinal herbs I obtained would have disappeared along with me. If the families behind you knew, you would have had a good end."

"Thank you for reminding me, so I will not kill you. I will only let you know that it is better to die than to live." The Heaven Wasteland Aristocratic Family man snorted angrily and immediately waved his hand, releasing a ball of red light that carried a terrifying power. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The red ball of light illuminated the surroundings, causing the ground to be shrouded in red light. What was even more terrifying was that the surrounding mountains and land began to shake, some even collapsing!

This was just a casual wave of energy, yet it was already so terrifying. Even Chen Xiang felt terrified at this moment.

The red ball of light quickly rushed over, and Chen Xiang immediately took out the Six Realms mirrors to block when he was still alive. The red ball of light struck the Six Realms mirrors, and Chen Xiang also felt the Six Realms mirrors violently tremble.

In order to maintain the stability of the Six Realms mirrors, it had absorbed more than half of Chen Xiang’s Dao energy!

The ball of red light that was hit on the Six Realms mirrors was also rebounded, the rebounding speed was very fast, and the man did not expect it to bounce back, he did not have the time to dodge at all, and was struck by the power he released.
