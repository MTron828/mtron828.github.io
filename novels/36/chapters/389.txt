CHAPTER 390 – FRUIT OF FORTUNE

“So it was like this. This way, the people with some potential will not be buried! The Kings’ Mainland is indeed rich and powerful. Is the Divine Martial Palace in-charge of the forces of the Kings’ Mainland?” Asked Chen Xiang.

“Yes, the guys of the Divine Martial Palace are extremely strong, and the people in power are all possessors of the King’s Vein. As long as someone has the King’s Vein, he can take an important post in the Divine Martial Palace.” Said Wu Kaiming.

Having strolled here and there a bit, Chen Xiang discovered that the dan industry of the Kings’ Mainland was very poor. The herbs sold were a lot, however, the dans were fewer. Now he understood why many citizens of the Kings’ Mainland were trapped in the 3rd level and the 6th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, it could all be credited to the lack of dans here.

However, the refiners here were still pretty good. Chen Xiang went to a few magical equipment stores and found them selling spirit-level equipment.

“It seems that even after being closed for so many years, Kings’ Mainland still wasn’t able to foster many alchemists. Sure enough, alchemy is not that easy! Now that they are open to the outside world, it should be to attract some alchemists or to want to buy dans from other mainlands.” Chen Xiang muttered to himself.

Gu Dongchen and Wu Kaiming were both inside a stone building, which was the residence of Wu Kaiming. At this moment, Chen Xiang just came out from that house to wander alone.

“The Fruit of Fortune is a heaven-level fruit, which is also very expensive even in the Heavenly Realm. It will be better if you can get it!” Su Meiyao said, these days she would always mention this.

“Is the Fruit of Fortune required for your dan?” Asked Chen Xiang. Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou had lost their power, and only through a dan could they recover it back. And according to them, it was a very high-level dan.

“No, you are wrong. If you have a heaven-level fruit now, you can plant it, which will bear you a lot more in the future. And after you have arrived at the Heavenly Realm, you can earn a lot of wealth by selling them, which would provide the wealth for you to gather herbs for the dan. When you have gone to the Heavenly Realm, you will understand how difficult it is to roam in the Heavenly Realm.” Su Meiyao said.

Chen Xiang licked his lips as he said, “There is still half a year till the deadline of registration. If I have not stepped into the Extreme State, I don’t dare to participate. Can I step into the Extreme State in half a year period?”

“It’s hard to say! Don’t you have some top-grade crystal stones? If you can lay out a Tian Yuan Array, it will be rather helpful in your cultivation, moreover, you can also quickly refine dans, you have a lot of herbs too!” Said Su Meiyao.

Bai Youyou said, “First, don’t refine Elemental Spirit Dan, only refine Five Elements True Elemental Dan, then just maybe you can enter the Extreme State in half a year!”

“Alright, after returning to the Extreme Martial Sect, I will go for broke. Since the Fruit of Fortune is an ingredient to refine heaven-level dan, then I am going to grasp this good opportunity.”

Chen Xiang had decided that he would impact at the Extreme State in half a year by all means!

“Little Rascal, if you can do it, at that time, this elder sister will let you taste something sweet, such as... a kiss on your lips.” Su Meiyao’s flirtatious voice could make anyone’s bones grow numb; her charming voice suddenly sent Chen Xiang in high spirits.

“To boost your morale, maybe your Sister Youyou will also give you a kiss on your lips.” Su Meiyao laughed again and again, while Chen Xiang’s heart was in a turmoil; he could not wait to execute this thing on the spot.

Chen Xiang was suddenly a lot more confident.

“Sister Youyou, is it true?” Chen Xiang took a long deep breath as he mustered up his courage to ask. He suspected that Su Meiyao was deceiving him.

“En!”

Upon hearing Bai Youyou’s soft voice, Chen Xiang felt as though his body was filled with power. He could not wait to go and register; he felt that his blood was already on fire!

“Indeed, a Little Rascal. Only using such dirty reward can make you so passionate.” Su Meiyao giggled. In any case, she had already kissed Chen Xiang once, she was not afraid for the second time, not to mention, that kind of feeling had left a memorable aftertaste.

Long Xueyi said with a laugh, “Elder Sisters, if you agree to get naked and take a bath with him, I’m afraid it would not be any difficult for him to destroy the entire King Mainland, hei hei...”

“Maybe!” Chen Xiang said with a lewd smile on his face.

“Pooh!” Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou, both snorted at the same time.

Chen Xiang wandered on the Kings’ Mainland for three days, during which he had bought a lot of herbs for refining Hundred Beasts Dan. Here, these herbs were very cheap and a lot. All of which was going to be used to fed Long Xueyi and Bai Zhenzhen.

Just like the Chenwu Mainland, precious herbs were very rare here too. For instance, when Chen Xiang asked for the herbs required for refining Building Foundation Dan, he could only found them in one store, moreover, it belonged to the Divine Martial Palace and were very expensive.

There were no Elemental Spirit Dan and Five Elements True Elemental Dan. However, some unconventional profound-level low-grade dans which were rarely used could still be found, but they too were very expensive.

And like other mainlands, apart from the herbs of Hundred Beasts Dan, herbs for other profound-level low-grade dans were very rare. Chen Xiang reckoned that the overconsumption of them during the Great Battle of the Three Realms 100,000 years ago had lead to their extinction.

From the profound-level dans, the herbs were all very valuable. However, spirit-level high-grade dans like True Elemental Dan and White Jade Dan were quite many, but as far as ordinary people were concerned, they were still very expensive.

The alchemy competition was going to be held in the Divine Martial Palace, which was a magnificent and huge palace. It was completely built from huge stones. Just the walls surrounding it were twenty odd zhang high. And on the inside, it was as big as a city, and with enormous magnificent palaces of all shapes and sizes.

At this moment, Chen Xiang was in the center of a huge palace hall, which was jam-packed with 3,000 to 4,000 people sitting on all sides. Many of whom were familiar to Chen Xiang; they were none other than the tycoons of various mainlands. Even Qin Zejun of Sacred Light Temple was here.

Chen Xiang felt a bit uncomfortable when looking at these people; however, it didn’t affect him.

In the palace hall, a total of ten people were also sitting in a row together, and Hua Xiangyue was one of them, while the other nine were old men and women. Chen Xiang reckoned that they were the referees.

Chen Xiang’s most attention was garnered by an old man who was dressed in a simple white robe. This old man appeared very ordinary, his eyes, on the other hand, were full of bizarre color. And even though they appeared to be very gentle, others dared not stare at him intently. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Even though this elder looked harmonious, it made others feel that his entire body was releasing an inexplicable imposing aura, which made others have an impulse to kneel before him. Chen Xiang figured that this elder must be an expert of Divine Martial Palace.

“To tell you the truth, we didn’t believe that Little Hero Chen would accept our invitation to participate in the alchemy competition. However, I have one doubt, why did you not participate in the martial arts competition?” A middle-aged man sitting next to Wu Kaiming asked.

Chen Xiang smiled and said, “Because I can’t defeat the experts of Kings’ Mainland.”

He had not participated because he couldn’t defeat them. This was indeed the best reason. If you couldn’t defeat them and yet let the others participate, then it would hardly be justifiable. The middle-aged man didn’t expect Chen Xiang’s answer would be so direct, moreover, it seemed that he didn’t place it in his heart. In his opinion, Chen Xiang should have found other reasons, because this reason would cost him his face.

Only now did Chen Xiang came to know that the alchemy competition was already in the final round; there was a total of four participants. And because he had accepted the invitation, and as he was a young and famous alchemist in the Chenwu Mainland, the Divine Martial Palace had made an exception and allowed him to enter the finals directly.
