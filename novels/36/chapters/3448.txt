Xiao Xianglin really wanted to know the secrets of Chen Xiang’s Heavenly magic sword, which was why he made his two female slaves make such sacrifices.

"I know. If I can’t get it, no matter how good it is, it would only be considered average. Right! " Xiao Xianglin thought he understood and laughed: "I can let you touch them!"

Chen Xiang shook his head, put down the teacup and said: "You give them to me, and I won’t take them. I have as many women as I want, so I can easily get them.

"You looked at my divine sword, I looked at them, so we were even." Chen Xiang laughed: "You can return the divine sword to me now, right?!"

Xiao Xianglin was stunned there, and the two beautiful female slaves were also struck.

"You are trying to capture me, right? I know you want them. " Xiao Xianglin coldly snorted: "I won’t agree to that. At most, I’ll just let you touch it."

Chen Xiang laughed: "You are wrong, hurry up and return my divine weapon to me! I really don’t like them, but I still think that my Divine Weapon looks better. "

"What a boring man!" Xiao Xianglin snorted and threw the two divine swords back at Chen Xiang. Even if she refused them, Chen Xiang could still take them back.

Xiao Xianglin anxiously said: "Xiang’er, Yu’er, quickly put on your clothes, don’t let him see you anymore, it’s such a waste!"

Xiang’er and Yu’er put on their clothes and stood behind Xiao Xianglin. They slightly pouted their small mouths and looked at Chen Xiang with hidden bitterness.

"Big Sister, he must have said that on purpose. He wants to get something even more cheap." Xiang’er said. She was the older sister.

"That’s right, putting on airs." Yu’er snorted.

Chen Xiang only shook his head with a smile. Within his You Yao Mountain Villa, there were Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou, the two absolute beauties, and also Long Xueyi, the White Dragon Girl. These three were all her wives.

"That’s not it. To tell you the truth, I have seen countless women, so in my eyes, all of you are nothing more than ordinary women." Chen Xiang took a sip of tea: "Of course, you guys are already very outstanding. If I hadn’t seen so many women before, I might have already been bewitched by you guys to the point of turning over your divine soul."

"Fine, you guys are taller than your elder sister, and your strength is not weak either. You guys are also a bit better looking than her. However, I feel that your elder sister is even more attractive than you."

Xiao Xianglin stared at Chen Xiang, his gaze like a blade.

"Why is that? It was mainly a desire for conquest! This is because all of you are her female slaves and your status is slightly low. However, your Big Sister is different. Chen Xiang laughed: "Of course, even if she were to go all out, she wouldn’t be able to tempt me."

Chen Xiang looked at Xiao Xianglin who had a dark expression and laughed: "Big Sister Xiao, are you not planning to recommend me to the Dragon-Elephant School anymore?"

Xiao Xianglin slapped the table beside him, and said coldly: "Who am I, Xiao Xianglin? I will keep my word and will not go back on my word. You can rest assured about that! "

Chen Xiang looked at the two female slaves who had bitterness written all over their faces, and laughed: "You two look a little better now!"

He felt that He Fengyuan was more interesting than these two girls since they were both female slaves since He Fengyuan was once a slave in the past. His aura could not be compared to the two girls who had been slaves since he was young.

The fusing of the Six Realms mirrors and the Heavenly magic sword was Chen Xiang’s greatest secret, so of course he wouldn’t tell others about it. However, Xiao Xianglin didn’t give up, as curiosity was like an ant in her heart, making her itch in her heart, unable to scratch it out.

"What would it take to tell me?" Xiao Xianglin asked.

"This... "In truth, I also know, because when I obtained this sword, it was like this. Do you believe me or not? How would I know that such a profound thing like this is a God’s Mirror that you don’t even know?" Chen Xiang said.

"Then can you lend it to me for a while?" Xiao Xianglin said.

"No, this Divine Weapon is my third life. I can’t lend it to you." Chen Xiang said with a serious face.

"Then what about your second life?" This was also what Xiang’er and Xiao Xianglin wanted to know, because even such a powerful divine weapon would only have a remaining three lives.

Chen Xiang laughed, and glanced at his crotch: "My second life is something that I can’t lend you, even if you all want to see it!"

Xiao Xianglin and the other two girls already understood what was going on. Their faces turned red, and they couldn’t help but scold Chen Xiang in their hearts. It was even harder for them to understand now. The guy in front of them looked like a pervert, but he was indifferent to their temptations. This self-control was something they admired.

Xiang’er said, "Dahei... It’s that black-clothed man. Was he decapitated by your sword? "

Chen Xiang nodded his head: "At the same time, I can also chop off your head."

The swords refined by the Tao-creation Holy stone could even be chopped into pieces, let alone a human’s neck!

"Oh right, are you guys going to bring me to the Dragon-Elephant School at that time?" Chen Xiang asked: "Are you riding on that beautiful big carriage?" Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

"We can set off now! You messed with a guy, I have to hurry up and bring him back to Dragon-Elephant School, this will reduce the trouble. " Xiao Xianglin said: "You probably don’t know who that fellow who you destroyed should be!"

"I don’t know. Even if I did, I would’ve still destroyed his sword. This guy is asking for a lesson." Chen Xiang curled his lips and said.

"He belongs to the Mortal Life Sect, and his grandfather is an elder of the sect." "This person always takes revenge for his flaws," said Yu’er. "It’s because Big Sister is here that he didn’t make a move."

"Looks like I have to thank you!" Chen Xiang cupped his hands towards Xiao Xianglin and laughed.

"No need to be so polite, go to Dragon-Elephant School in the future and avoid trouble." Xiao Xianglin said: "Of course, if there are arrogant people, I can teach them a lesson."

Xiao Xianglin and the others could tell that Chen Xiang wasn’t afraid of the white clothed man’s revenge at all.

This was also why she did not make a move when Xiao Xianglin was in the carriage and had a short conversation with him. At that time, she felt a strange power from Chen Xiang’s words, and it was as if he was carrying a strong threat that made her afraid.

In the dark night, Chen Xiang sat on the carriage, the eight dragon and elephant were pulling the carriage and flying in the sky. Chen Xiang laid down on the carriage comfortably, and Xiao Xianglin sat across from him, staring at the Blood fire sword.

Xiang’er and Yu’er, the two female slaves sat beside Xiao Xianglin, treating her very cordially. Furthermore, they were wearing very little clothes in the carriage, so Chen Xiang did not know if they were luring him to do so intentionally or not.

"Can you see the flowers after looking at them for so long?" Chen Xiang asked Xiao Xianglin, who seemed to be extremely obsessed with Blood fire sword too.

Initially, he had planned to give the Blood fire sword to his master Lei Yichen to fuse, but his master had made up his mind.

"Big Sis is learning how to refine it!" This is a technique similar to the one refined by Luo Jiuyang, and Luo Jiuyang’s refining technique is even better than his, it’s just that the Divine Weapons that Luo Jiuyang personally refined are rarely spread. " Xiang’er said.
