Chen Xiang’s sudden arrival had already caught the attention of Zhang Zhuo and the rest, in the moment they turned to look at Chen Xiang, Xu Lingfei had already used his spatial teleportation and snatched Xu Lingfei away from the man’s hands.

"Chen Xiang." Zhang Zhuo was shocked, but he secretly rejoiced in his heart, because Chen Xiang’s sudden appearance here gave them a chance to eliminate Chen Xiang. Previously, he had planned to lure Chen Xiang to a place with no people and kill him secretly.

Chen Xiang’s face darkened, his heart was filled with anger: "Are you guys not afraid of Supreme Divine Palace’s punishment? You actually dare to make a move on mortals?"

Zhang Zhuo laughed out loud: "So what, as long as Supreme Divine Palace doesn’t know, it’s fine. It’s not like this has never happened before, many disciples have done it in secret, and you wouldn’t reveal it, because you’re going to die very soon."

Seeing that he was saved, Xu Lingfei stopped crying and hid behind Chen Xiang obediently. At the same time, he glared at Zhang Zhuo and the rest of the bad guys.

Chen Xiang brought Xu Lingfei and teleported to the old lady’s side. His teleportation made Zhang Zhuo and the others jealous, because they couldn’t do it as well as Chen Xiang.

Chen Xiang said coldly: "So you’re saying, you intend to kill me."

Zhang Zhuo took out a divine sword, "I will definitely kill you. Don’t worry, after I kill you, I will immediately let this little girl and that old woman accompany you in death.

Although Zhang Zhuo believed that he could deal with Chen Xiang, he still had his reservations towards Chen Xiang’s sword and had, who was by his side, attack together with the other three men.

Chen Xiang snorted in disdain. A layer of frost suddenly appeared on the ground in front of them, as tiny ice dragons emerged from the ground and tied up Zhang Zhuo and the others who were about to rush over.

Chen Xiang’s Six Realms’ Power was equivalent to the power of the Ancient Code. Although he did not grasp the laws of ice, his Heavenly God level’s other six divine powers were more than enough to deal with profound God like Zhang Zhuo and the others. No matter how powerful Zhang Zhuo and the others were, Chen Xiang was still a god and was much stronger than them.

In Chen Xiang’s eyes, Zhang Zhuo and the others were like a few strands of grass. As long as he was willing, they could easily harvest it.

"You ... You are an Empyrean God. " Song Peng was the same as well. The last time Chen Xiang fought with Song Peng, was around two years ago, and at that time, Chen Xiang was only a middle profound God. But now, he was a god.

It was precisely because of this that Zhang Zhuo thought that Chen Xiang was so strong that he could only be considered a Super profound God. For the five of them, who were outstanding Sword Hall disciples, to take Chen Xiang down was as easy as flipping his palm.

Chen Xiang’s voice was extremely cold, and was even more bone-piercing than those ice dragons, "To be honest, I wanted to kill all of you yesterday, but as soon as I entered the Supreme Divine Palace, I was more concerned about the rules of the Supreme Divine Palace. I had always thought that no one would dare to challenge the authority of the Supreme Divine Palace, so I endured it and followed the rules of the Supreme Divine Palace."

"But just now, heh heh, I heard that many people secretly broke the rules, I knew that I was too naive, it seems like as long as Supreme Divine Palace does not know, then nothing will happen to me." Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Chen Xiang’s words, which were filled with killing intent, caused Zhang Zhuo and the others to feel cold from head to toe. Chen Xiang was now a god, killing them was just too easy.

Chen Xiang’s face revealed a sinister smile, and gazed at Zhang Zhuo. His face that was originally full of arrogance, gradually revealed fear and despair.

The others were more afraid than he was.

They, who were born in the Supreme Divine Palace, had never been threatened by death. Even if they went out to hunt divine beasts, they had absolute confidence in escaping.

But now, death didn’t come, but that terrifying feeling filled their hearts, making them endure the torture of hell. It was a kind of mental torment.

"Chen Xiang, the disciples of the Supreme Divine Palace rarely kill each other. Once we die, the Supreme Divine Palace will definitely find out.

The frightened Zhang Zhuo calmed down. He was after all, the Hall Master of Wind Hall, and was more or less capable.

Zhang Zhuo was still very hopeful right now. Previously, he had already heard from Chen Xiang’s words that Chen Xiang did not dare to break the rules because he was afraid that the Supreme Divine Palace would know, so he used this point to negotiate with Chen Xiang.

Song Peng and the rest were all hopeful as they waited for Chen Xiang’s answer.

Chen Xiang did not make a sound, but he still struck out with his sword. His sword stabbed into the forehead of a man, and that man was the one who grabbed Xu Lingfei just now.

His forehead was pierced by Chen Xiang’s God Slaughtering Sword, but there was no blood at all. This was because Chen Xiang had injected six streams of cold energy into the God Slaughtering Sword, freezing everything in the man’s body.

Chen Xiang slowly pulled out his sword, and this was his reply to Zhang Zhuo. In Chen Xiang’s eyes, there was nothing worth negotiation, Zhang Zhuo and the others had already made up their minds to kill the old granny and Xu Lingfei the little girl, but they actually dared to do this, so it was unforgivable.

Crash.

After the man had been stabbed by the sword, his body, which had been frozen into ice, instantly shattered and died just like that.

Chen Xiang’s sword came out very quickly, but Xu Lingfei did not see it, and was covered by the old granny’s eyes.

Looking at Zhang Zhuo’s eyes that were suddenly filled with shock, Chen Xiang laughed coldly: "You all grew up in the Supreme Divine Palace, so you haven’t killed anyone before, right?"

As he spoke, another man turned into a pile of ice fragments. Whether or not he brandished his sword, neither Song Peng nor Zhang Zhuo could see it, because it was simply too fast, so fast that it exceeded the speed of nature, making it hard to believe.

It was true that Zhang Zhuo and the others had not killed anyone, they had only killed some Divine Beasts. However, there was still a huge difference between killing people and killing people. In this aspect, they were just too weak compared to Chen Xiang.

In the blink of an eye, another man was sliced into pieces by Chen Xiang’s sword. He landed on the ground, turned into ice crystals and melted away.

Zhang Zhuo felt as if he had fallen into an abyss of hell. The fear before death caused him to break out in a cold sweat as he regretted it endlessly. He regretted doing such a thing.

"Let’s go." With two light slashes from Chen Xiang, Zhang Zhuo and Song Peng turned into ice crystals, and following a gust of cold wind, they dissipated, dying extremely cleanly.

Chen Xiang turned around and looked at the elderly behind him and smiled: "Old granny, everything is fine now, let’s go back."
