Chu Hongqing came to Chen Xiang’s side and asked in a low voice, "Didn’t you say you were going to accompany Big Sister coincidental Yan to refine pills?

"It’s fine." Xie Qiaoyan’s tone became much more gentle. She was worried about Chen Xiang’s servant because she knew her own personality.

Chu Hongqing nodded, and then came to Xie Qiaoyan’s side.

"Just refine the Qingyuan Dan. Within four hours, the highest quality person will win."

Chen Xiang was the referee. He was currently lying on the lawn with his head on Yang Xiangyin’s bed, looking at the blue sky with great enjoyment. He would occasionally pinch Yang Xiangyin’s face or touch Yang Xiangyin’s tender jade hands.

Four hours was still relatively long for Chen Xiang, so he let Yang Xiangyin hum a small tune for him to listen to while he closed his eyes and waited for the results.

Chu Hongqing was also very hardworking. She clearly understood that the reason Chen Xiang wanted her to compete with him was to squeeze out her potential.

Xie Qiaoyan could guess that Chen Xiang must have passed his pill techniques on to the servant girl beside her, causing her to be a little envious. A servant girl could actually obtain a pill technique as high as Chen Xiang’s, this servant was simply too lucky. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

It had been a long time since Xie Qiaoyan last refined a Qingyuan Dan, she had some experience, but since she had a solid foundation, she refined very quickly. She opened the pill furnace in just an hour and took out five Qingyuan Dan s that were glowing with a blue light, the quality seemed very good.

Chu Hongqing had not completed it yet, but she was extremely stable. Chen Xiang had a better understanding of her strength, he felt that even if Chu Hongqing lost, it wouldn’t be too embarrassing.

After four hours had almost passed, Chu Hongqing was finally done. She opened the pill furnace and took out seven Qingyuan Dan s.

"So many." Xie Qiaoyan exclaimed.

"I need to test my quality." Chen Xiang laughed.

Xie Qiaoyan took out the testing disc, and placed all five of his Qingyuan Dan s onto it. Each pellet was of four hundred quality, the quality was considered very high, the total value of five pellets was two thousand.

During Chu Hongqing’s test, the highest pellet was three hundred, and the lowest was two hundred and sixty. Her seven pellets had a total quality of one thousand eight hundred and seventy, which wasn’t too far off from Xie Qiaoyan’s.

Chen Xiang smiled and pinched Chu Hongqing’s jade face: "If you refine another pellet, you will win."

Chu Hongqing stuck out her tongue, and said tenderly: "I can’t, this is my limit."

Xie Qiaoyan said: "Hongqing, you are considered very powerful. I don’t know many female Alchemist s, but none of them are as powerful as you."

"This is all thanks to Master’s guidance." Chu Hongqing smiled sweetly, "Big Sister Qianyan definitely hasn’t put her full effort, right? If you use your full strength, the gap between you and I will definitely be very large."

Chen Xiang allowed Xie Qiaoyan and her to refine pellets together, so that they could exchange their experiences, while Chen Xiang brought Yang Xiangyin to stroll around the villa.

"Xiang Yin, what do you think about this woman, Xie Qiaoyan?" Chen Xiang asked.

"Not bad. She’s strong and has great alchemy skills. She’s pretty and has status. Although her appearance is cold on the surface, her character isn’t bad." After Yang Xiangyin finished speaking, he asked her in a low voice, "Master, you’re interested in her."

"It is indeed a little interesting. I only wanted to get her to the Hundreds of Flowers Village, but I was still a little worried because I am still not very familiar with her." Chen Xiang pulled Yang Xiangyin’s small hand and shook it.

"Then how can I be at ease with her? She’s so strong, it’s very difficult to take her in as a female slave." Yang Xiangyin also understood Chen Xiang’s worry, she knew that the women in Hundreds of Flowers Village were extremely important to Chen Xiang.

Chen Xiang looked at Yang Xiangyin with a smile, then covered her cherry lips. This sudden event caused Yang Xiangyin to not be prepared in the slightest, moreover, for such a thing, it was very awkward for her. Of course, she didn’t reject it from the bottom of her heart, and she had been waiting for this since a long time ago.

Slowly, Yang Xiangyin became a little familiar, and they began to kiss once more. This kind of feeling made her heart feel an inexplicable sense of sweetness, and her body felt a little hot ...

Chen Xiang laid on the grass with Yang Xiangyin in his arms, and asked: "Xiang Yin, are you happy with me?"

"Of course I’m happy. Master has been so kind to me, spending so many Jade money to buy me to be safe from poison. I’m very grateful to you." Yang Xiangyin gently caressed Chen Xiang’s chest and said sweetly.

"That’s good. I was worried that you wouldn’t be happy." Chen Xiang laughed, and then, he kissed Yang Xiangyin on the cheek.

... ....

In the evening, Chen Xiang and Yang Xiangyin returned to the garden. Xie Qiaoyan and Chu Hongqing were still concocting pills, it seemed that their communication was not bad, and they even tried to concoct two batches of pills.

Chen Xiang looked at their results and realized that Xie Qiaoyan had actually managed to refine six pills. This must have been due to Chu Hongqing giving her some pointers, and the quality of the pills Chu Hongqing refined had also increased by a lot, becoming more stable.

"Don’t get tired." Chen Xiang laughed.

"En, Hongqing, you should rest first and come back tomorrow." Xie Qiaoyan knew that Chu Hongqing’s cultivation was not high, and her training was difficult for her, but it could help Chu Hongqing improve her quality.

Xie Qiaoyan had already promised Chen Xiang that he would stay here for two days, and then, he would participate in the Jiang Family Patriarch’s birthday banquet.

The next morning, when Chen Xiang opened the door, she saw Xie Qiaoyan and Chu Hongqing drinking tea and eating dim sum in the hall. Yang Xiangyin had made these, although she did not know how to refine pills, she was very good at it.

"I won’t be refining the Qingyuan Dan today. There’s a guy who wants to challenge me. He knows that I’m here." Xie Qiaoyan said.

"Oh, could it be that he also has a recommends divine pill in his hands?" Chen Xiang took out the pill Xie Qiaoyan gave him last time. As long as there was a pill here, he could challenge the Alchemist s above at any time.

"Yes, he knew that I was here, and the person in charge of Dan God List of Eight Wastelands also sent a message to me, asking me to accept his challenge today." Xie Qiaoyan nodded.

"Looks like this Dan God List of Eight Wastelands is very troublesome. I better not go." Chen Xiang curled his lips.

"It’s troublesome occasionally, but there are quite a few benefits as well. However, those benefits should not be much to you." Xie Qiaoyan said: "Will you come with me to take a look?"

"Of course I’m going. If you lose to that guy, then I can help you get back at him." Chen Xiang laughed.

"I won’t lose." Xie Qiaoyan snorted.

"Weren’t you as confident as me last time?" Chen Xiang laughed.

"I refuse to believe that I will be so unlucky as to encounter two monsters in such a short amount of time." Xie Qiaoyan scoffed, "You wish for me to lose that much, what kind of mentality do you have?

Chen Xiang laughed: "Of course I don’t want to, you can only lose to me, you can’t lose to anyone, especially other men."

Xie Qiaoyan frowned, and said: "Why do these words sound a little strange to me?"
