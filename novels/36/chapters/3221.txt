Yue Yiran understood the Heaven Old Imperial Family a little, so he planned to sneak into the Heaven Old Imperial Family to investigate. He wanted to ask Yue Yiran what he needed to pay attention to.

When Yue Yiran heard Chen Xiang’s voice appearing in his mind, he answered: "I’ve pretty much dealt with it. Come to Sky Qi City, I’ll wait for you here."

After Chen Xiang used the Six Realms mirrors to locate Yue Yiran’s position, he immediately used the power of space to teleport outside Sky Qi City.

Celestial Qilin City was a relatively large city. With the protection of an array formation, one was not allowed to directly teleport in. Otherwise, it would cause a great deal of commotion.

"The formations of this city are not bad. I don’t know who set them up, but they are much better than those of the previous cities." Feng Ke’er said. This was a great defensive formation that she had seen before in the Heaven Old Super Realm.

Of course, Chen Xiang did not know who had set it up, but he felt that Yue Yiran should know.

After Yue Yiran left the Heavenly Dan Mountain Villa, it was obvious that he was very trusting of the city to come to this kind of place.

Entering the Sky Qi City, Chen Xiang felt that everyone inside was strange, just as he was about to enter the city and use the Six Realms mirrors to look for Yue Yiran, Yue Yiran suddenly popped out.

"Hehe, you’re really here." After Yue Yiran told him the meeting place, he hastily ran to the city gate and immediately saw Chen Xiang.

Chen Xiang looked around and whispered: "Boss, don’t you need to disguise yourself?"

Yue Yiran was currently using his original appearance, and there were quite a few people who knew of him. The matter of him being captured by the Heavenly Dan Mountain Villa was extremely famous, but he seemed to not be afraid of others knowing about it.

"There’s no need to be afraid here." Yue Yiran laughed as he walked on the main street with Chen Xiang in tow.

"Why don’t you need to be afraid?" Chen Xiang saw that the people around him did not pay much attention to them, the people here did not seem to care about anyone else.

"Most of the people here are not from the Super Yang Divine Race." Yue Yiran laughed: "The majority of it comes from the Myriad Tao s, and this city’s power is also very strong. They can avoid being bullied by Super Yang Divine Race s."

Chen Xiang understood that it was very difficult to survive above Myriad Tao, and the people who came here from the top, were mostly very strong, if they gathered here now, they could form a very strong force, this way, the Heaven Old Divine Race would not dare to bully them, if not they would have to pay a very large price.

Yue Yiran brought Chen Xiang to the house that he bought here. After entering, he asked: "Why are you looking for me?"

"I want to enter the Heaven Old Imperial Family to investigate, I’m worried that they will make some big movements." Chen Xiang said: "It’s mainly because last time in the Heavenly Dan Mountain Villa, how many Myriad Tao Divine Soil s did they see when I took them out? Later on, they followed me to the outskirts of the Divine Soil Restricted Area."

Yue Yiran was also very curious about the origins of Chen Xiang’s Myriad Tao Divine Soil. Now that he heard Chen Xiang say it this way, he seemed to understand that Chen Xiang’s Myriad Tao Divine Soil was obtained from the Divine Soil Restricted Area.

One must know that in the Divine Soil Restricted Area, only the Divine Earth Realm people could enter the Sun God Forest, and there were a large number of Myriad Tao Divine Soil s inside, which was why Chen Xiang was able to have so many Myriad Tao Divine Soil s.

"You don’t need to go to the Heaven Old Imperial Family. It’s a mess there." Yue Yiran said: "Heaven Old Imperial Family does not have that strength right now, but they will definitely not show it, because when the two realms fuse together, Heaven Old Divine Race will not let the other four Super Yang Divine Race s underestimate them."

"But I’m still worried, after all, the Heaven Old Divine Race has once sealed the Divine Soil Race successfully." Chen Xiang said.

"The Heaven Old Imperial Family doesn’t have any power now, it’s mainly because the experts that participated in the seal went up to the Myriad Tao, there are many strong fellows up there. If the Myriad Tao Divine Soil here is able to attract them, they will definitely come down, and that is what you need to worry about, and by then, it will not only be the power of the Heaven Old Imperial Family, the other Super Yang Divine Race will also have very powerful forces, maybe they will even join hands."

Hearing Yue Yiran’s words, Chen Xiang became even more worried.

"Dong Dong Dong"

Suddenly, someone knocked on Yue Yiran’s door.

Yue Yiran gave Chen Xiang a glance, then hurriedly opened the door. Three middle-aged men dressed in black, walked in, and scanned the house the moment they entered. Although they saw Chen Xiang, they did not take him seriously at all.

This was mainly because Chen Xiang’s concealing ability was too strong, so they did not discover his true strength.

"What are you doing?" Yue Yiran saw that these three people were extremely rude and aggressive.

"Yue Yiran, where’s the white-haired man who saved you before? "Where is he?" the middle-aged man asked with a threatening tone, his face full of malice.

Are you people from the Heaven Old Imperial Family? Yue Yiran chuckled: "I can answer you, I can’t! "Now that I’ve chosen not to answer, and also told you to get out of here as soon as possible, this is my territory, I don’t welcome you."

Yue Yiran was very clear about the rules of this place, so he was not afraid of them at all, and he also very much hated these people.

"Do you think the scattered sand here can deal with us?" These three middle-aged men were extremely powerful, and their strength was also extremely strong. One could see that all of them wielded weapons, and all of them had long, faint golden blades in their hands.

Seeing their weapons, Chen Xiang frowned, realizing that these three middle aged men were not members of Heaven Old Imperial Family who had broken through. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

"The sabers in their hands were crafted by the Myriad Tao Divine Soil. Judging by the color and luster of the sabers, there should be a lot of them, around twenty silvers at least." Feng Ke’er said.

Yue Yiran could also tell that the other party’s divine blade was refined from Myriad Tao Divine Soil, his expression becoming more solemn.

"Hmph, you can still be considered sensible. You should know that we’re powerful." When the leading Middle-aged Man in Black Robe saw Yue Yiran’s serious expression, he laughed proudly, he knew that the divine blade that Myriad Tao Divine Soil had refined could intimidate Yue Yiran.

"You came from above Myriad Tao? Is it someone from the Heaven Old Imperial Family? " Yue Yiran asked again, although the opponent’s weapon was strong, he was only a little worried, and was not very afraid.

"That’s right. If you cooperate with us, we can spare your life." From what they knew, the people who had saved Yue Yiran possessed a large number of Myriad Tao Divine Soil s at their disposal. This was an extremely huge temptation to them, because even though they had been in the Myriad Tao for many years, they had only been able to find an extremely small number of Myriad Tao Divine Soil s.

Yue Yiran looked at Chen Xiang and saw that Chen Xiang was extremely calm, he said: "I’ll close the door first, then we can have a good talk."
