Chapter 003: Xue Xianxian

To prepare for the Divine Vein transfer, Chen Xiang sat down on the ground, crossed his legs, and concentrated his spirit power.

Both Bai Youyou and Su Meiyao’s delicate hands were pressed against Chen Xiang’s stomach. From their beautiful hands, a black and a white mist surged out. The black was Bai Youyou’s Extreme Yin Divine Vein while the white was Su Meiyao’s Extreme Yang Divine Vein. Both had a mystical appearance.

Within Chen Xiang’s body appeared a white and a black stream, randomly spreading through his muscles, bones, and meridians in waves. As they circulated, his body began to slowly strengthen, wave after wave, and, at last, the white and the black Qi gathered in his dantian, forming a Tai Chi Yin Yang diagram. This was the Yin and Yang Divine Veins!

As Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou saw the Extreme Yin and Yang Divine Veins successfully fuse with Chen Xiang, they could not help but get excited. They originally thought that the fusion of the Extreme Yin and Extreme Yang Divine Veins would be very difficult. For them, this was an experiment, so they didn’t know what would happen, but they certainly didn’t expect it to be successful.

Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou slowly retracted their hands and watched the white and black mist start to rise from Chen Xiang. Both of them had complex and surprised expressions on their faces. According to the knowledge of the sisters, there has never been a single person with both Yin and Yang Divine Veins existing simultaneously. At this time, they realized that this brat, so long as he cultivates diligently, will one day became a universally unrivaled master.

Chen Xiang gradually opened his eyes. He had never felt this comfortable and strong in his life. “So this is a Divine Vein. Ah, it feels so good! Later I’ll be able to enter the True Martial Realm!” Chen Xiang was somewhat excited, and a strange and evil smile flashed over his face, looking very nasty in comparison to his previously simple and honest appearance. This made the hearts of two beauties fill with worry.

In this world of Cultivators, the Mortal Martial Realm is divided into ten stages: Refining Qi, Quenching Body, Martial Body, Opening Vein, True Qi, Divine Sense, True Aura, Divine Power, True Form, and finally Completion.

Above the Mortal Martial Realm is the True Martial Realm. It is the dream of many Cultivators to reach the True Martial Realm. After reaching that realm, one will be filled with overwhelming force, and their lifespan will be extended up to a thousand years.

Chen Xiang was currently at the 3rd level of the Mortal Martial Realm, the Martial Body stage. For a long time, he had been unable to enter the 4th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, the Opening Vein stage.

“True Martial Realm? That would simply bring disgrace to the Divine Vein,” Bai Youyou spoke with disdain.

Su Meiyao gave Chen Xiang a serious look, “You have Yin and Yang Divine Veins, your outlook must be more open! In this world, power never completely stops advancing. There are many different worlds. You are currently in the Chenwu Mainland, and this is only a small piece of land in a mortal world.”

“You have to remember the contract! You must help us restore our strength! This is not a simple matter!”

Chen Xiang nodded repeatedly and said, “As long as I am alive, I will certainly fulfill the contract and restore the strength of you, two sisters.”

Bai Youyou nodded with satisfaction, “The quickest way, to restore our strength, is to use dans, and they must be very high ranking dans! After our strength is restored, the contract will be complete. At that time, we will be able to take our revenge.”

Chen Xiang felt a little lost, but, if the two beauties stayed by his side, it was certainly something to be happy about. Su Meiyao removed a ring from her beautiful hair and threw it towards Chen Xiang, saying, “Put a drop of blood on it and it will recognize you as its owner. Using this ring is similar to using a storage pouch, so put my elder sister and I in it, then you can climb back up! You should not stay down here much longer, this place is frequently visited by demon beasts.”

Dripping blood on it, Chen Xiang established a contract with the ring. The space inside the ring was very small, yet, in Chen Xiang’s knowledge, legendary storage rings should have a space as vast as a sea.

However, one could place living creatures in this storage equipment! This made Chen Xiang marvel. Common storage pouches were very rare and are distributed by sects in the immortal mountains. While they were rare, they certainly couldn’t hold living creatures inside.

According to Su Meiyao’s words, he placed the two women into the storage ring. As he put it on his finger, the ring became invisible. This made Chen Xiang admire it even more.

He ate the dan, given by his father, and, with plenty of stamina, he started climbing the cliff, leaving the Death Qi filled abyss beneath him. For him, this was a very arduous challenge. Climbing the cliff made Chen Xiang even more depressed because he was not able to see anything, due to the black Death Qi, which also increased the difficulty of the climb.

After arduous climbing that lasted for a full day, Chen Xiang finally reached the top. Now that he had completed the climb, he realized that it really wasn’t all that difficult due to the Divine Veins. As he was climbing up, he absorbed large amounts of Spirit Qi which entered his body and eliminated the fatigue, making him as energetic as a dragon and as fierce as a tiger throughout the entire climb

After Chen Xiang got his bearings, he embarked on his way back towards Wohu city.

Although he was not able to see Bai Youyou and Su Meiyao inside the ring, he was still able to sense them.

“Sisters, when are you going to teach me those divine and devil exercises?” Chen Xiang impatiently asked as he was very curious about those divine and devil exercises.

“Your body is too weak at the moment, thus, you will not be able to withstand the devil exercises.” Bai Youyou transmitted, in an ice cold voice.

Su Meiyao said, “You can practice the divine exercises anytime, but first you should return home. I also plan on teaching you alchemy.”

Chen Xiang, in his heart, was delighted and started to run as fast as he could.

In the southern part of the Southern Martial Empire, Wohu City, with a population of one million, was quite large and prosperous. It was also the place where the Southern Martial Empire’s famous martial arts family, the Chen Family, lived!

The Chen family had several thousand years of history, and even now, their strength was still quite formidable. With a very rich heritage, they were able to survive for several thousand years, which proved their strength.

The Chen family was also very wealthy, and, inside Wohu City, they are the most powerful economic force. The Chen family villa occupies several thousand acres of land, with a countless number of courtyards and numerous gardens. It was surrounded by mountains and rivers, so, even if someone wanted to sneak in, they would get lost.

Tianhu Park, anyone can guess that this mansion belongs to Chen Tianhu, as a Chen family member having a prominent position, owning a huge house is a normal thing for that person. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Dad, I’m back!” Chen Xiang returned and rushed into the library, as he knows his father is always there.

Chen Tianhu laughed and said, “You smelly brat! You finally came back. Did you know that there is a little beauty here, waiting for you? Do you still remember the little girl of the Xue family? Your little wife?”

Chen Xiang brow wrinkled, in his mind, there was an attractive little girl, with skin like jade, that he played with when he was only five or six years old.

“Father.......you mean Xue Xianxian?”Chen Xiang asked, remembering the girl of the Xue family. She came and visited the Chen family when she was small. At that time she and Chen Xiang had both played for the entire day, both had a very good time and, later, their families arranged for them to be married.

Chen Tianhu nodded his head, “Right, that little girl is in the villa, just as you went out to look for herbs, she came, and pleaded me to allow her to see you.”

Chen Tianhu smiled and looked out of the window as he said this, Chen Xiang followed his father gaze and saw a girl, with skin like jade, walking in the courtyard outside.

The girl had long hair, a white full body robe, and was adorned with shining golden ornaments. Seeing the girl’s attire, which was similar to that of a fairy, Chen Xiang couldn’t help but be dazed by her beauty. That girl was only fourteen or fifteen years old, yet her skin was white as snow, giving her a beautiful appearance and making people unable to move their gaze from her.

When the girl saw Chen Xiang through the window, her beautiful face was filled with joy. She charmingly shouted, “Brother Xiao Xiang!”

The sound of her voice was gentle and lively, capable of captivating a person’s soul. Chen Xiang admits that, although this girl was younger, whether it be temperament or appearance, she could stand shoulder to shoulder with the two beauties inside the ring. Let alone the fact that this girl was not yet to fully developed.

Chen Xiang swallowed saliva and with a dry laugh said, “This truly is the eighteen changes of a grown woman[1]! I didn’t think that this little girl will turn into a fairy.”

This girl was the Xue family’s beloved daughter of the heavens, Xue Xianxian.

“This girl is my fiancée?!” Chen Xiang cried in his heart excitedly.

If it was before, Chen Xiang would feel his heart constrict, because he didn’t possess any Spiritual Veins. But now, he had the Yin and Yang Divine Veins! So long as he was given time, achieving the pinnacle level of martial arts was not just a fantasy anymore.

Xue Xianxian lightly smiled, and little dimples emerged on her cheeks along with a charming blush which made Chen Xiang absent-minded again.

Chen Tianhu laughed and then patted Chen Xiang’s shoulder, saying, “You two can catch up.” Chen Xiang, while laughing, hastily ran out from the library.

Coming into the courtyard, Chen Xiang, without any pleasantries, grabbed Xue Xianxian’s soft beautiful hands, and then quickly led her out of the line of sight of his father, as if they were going to do some bad things in their own small time.

Chen Xiang, along with the little fairy, came to his own house, making many other Chen family children envious as they went.

“Xianxian, how long are you going to stay with the Chen family?” Chen Xiang asked, while laughing, and squeezed Xue Xianxian’s cute, dimpled face.

Xue Xianxian, with a smile, softly said, “Xiao Xiang brother, my father and I came to Wohu city to talk to you, so we’re not going to stay for very long.”

During childhood, Xue Xianxian got a strange disease and came to Wohu city for a cure, at that time, Xue Xianxian body was weak, and looked thin and frail, so, in the Chen and Xue familes, she was often bullied. Only Chen Xiang took good care of her and played with her.

During that time, it made her really happy. He also encouraged her to be strong, so she could fight her illness, and also gave her a few precious dans.

These things were engraved in Xue Xianxian heart and, even when she knew Chen Xiang didn’t have any Spiritual Veins and thus no future in martial arts, she still decided to marry Chen Xiang.

Chen Xiang was at somewhat of a loss. He also liked Xue Xianxian very much. When they were children, both families knew Chen Xiang did not have Spiritual Veins, so Chen Xiang also didn’t have any playmates. Therefore, he and Xue Xianxian were like two peas in a pod.

“Brother Xiao Xiang, my family told me to dissolve the marriage, but I disagreed, so they made me go see the Yao family and meet their young genius of alchemy.” Xue Xianxian saw Chen Xiang’s complexion changing, and, with a chuckle, said, “Rest assured, I would rather die than marry that Yao family brat. Also, I have heard that he has a very nasty character.”

In the whole of the South Martial Empire, Xue Xianxian was considered a genius among geniuses, with her cultivation at the 6th level of the Mortal Martial Realm and being only fourteen. On the other hand, the Yao family also had a sixteen-year-old genius, who was able to refine dans. In everyone’s eyes, they were the definition of a perfect couple.

Chen Xiang was very calm. He now had the Yin and Yang Divine Veins, and two unidentified, yet formidable, women as his tutors, so he now had the confidence that, in a short amount of time, he could catch up with the Yao family’s young alchemist.

Chen Xiang grinned, touching Xue Xianxian elegant charming cheeks, and smiled as he said, “Xianxian, you go to Yao family and say you already have a fiancé, and, if he still refuses to accept, then tell him to come and challenge me.”

Seeing Chen Xiang being so confident, made Xue Xianxian very glad. She stood on her toes and kissed Chen Xiang on his lips, then, bowing her head, said, “Brother Xiao Xiang, you must become stronger, I am worried about my family, as they will not hesitate to break us apart.”

Xue Xianxian gracefully moved through the courtyard, like a swallow, her movements agile and elegant, but also making Chen Xiang become distracted, like a fool. In his mind, the image of Xue Xianxian kissing his lips appeared.

Chen Xiang licked his lips and, with a smile, said, “That little girl has grown up a lot.”
