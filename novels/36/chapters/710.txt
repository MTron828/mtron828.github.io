After hearing Chen Xiang’s nonsense, Dongfang Xinyue faintly sighed, "I knew that if those old fellows did this, they would definitely anger Father."

Although Dongfang Xinyue had a young and beautiful face, she was still an old guy. Through Dongfang Rong’s memories, Chen Xiang knew that in Dong Fang Clan, sometimes, the Dongfang Family Patriarch would not only talk about this matter, but also talk about this old guy, Dongfang Xinyue, with the consent of a group of elders.

And Dong Fang Clan’s intention to expand his power was precisely this group of old fogeys.

"No more?" Dongfang Xinyue blinked his eyes and asked softly.

"Why don’t you go out and take a look at this new world? With the elder’s strength, he will definitely be able to make a name for himself in this new world. " Chen Xiang had said what he thought in his heart. If it was the Dong Fang Rong of the past, he would have dared to say it even if it was beaten to death.

The reason why Chen Xiang did this, was also to let Dongfang Xinyue leave the Warm Moon Palace and even let him take a look at the important place that was hidden inside.

Dongfang Xinyue lowered his head and thought, he did not know why she was hiding in profound Realm all day, a woman like her had strength, status, and looks, when she went out, she would definitely scream for help, what was there to be afraid of? He wasn’t like him, where people placed high bounty on him.

"Oh right, have you captured the person who killed Dongfang Yao? This man is really bold, he actually dared to waste Devil-subduing College’s Divine Son, does Devil-subduing College not care? Do you have any details about this person? " Dongfang Xinyue asked curiously.

Chen Xiang’s heart suddenly tightened, and actually asked about his matters. "I didn’t catch him, he had an extremely powerful backing, trained in the Taiji Dragon-suppressed kungfu, and the three big shots of the Super Martial School were all his junior brothers. As of now, he was the one who openly crippled that God’s Son, and as for whether or not Dongfang Yao was killed by him, there’s still no evidence to prove it."

Dongfang Xinyue’s jade face was filled with surprise: "Taiji Dragon-suppressed kungfu! I never thought that it would actually exist. No wonder he could cripple the divine son. Since he had such a fortuitous encounter at such a young age, Dongfang Yao is far from being able to compare to it. "

Of course, Chen Xiang was happy to be praised by the beauty, but he didn’t know that Chen Xiang was standing right in front of her.

"Elder Warm Moon, this person killed the young master, why didn’t he increase the bounty? If it’s just one billion Spar, it would be hard to attract anyone’s interest, after all, this person has many powerful experts protecting him, not just the three Great Leaders of Super Martial School, for example the famous Divine Weapon Nation’s Female Emperor, the Medicinal Pill Emperor of Dan Fragrance Pure Land, they are all his backers." Chen Xiang felt that this bounty was too shabby, and made him feel uncomfortable. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Hearing Chen Xiang mention the powerful woman, Dongfang Xinyue was suddenly very interested. It was the first time that she had heard of such a famous person, so she anxiously asked: "The Divine Weapons Heavenly Country’s Female Emperor and the Dan Fragrance Pure Land’s Female Emperor? What is their background? "

"They have great origins, but that is only in their world. I dare say that as long as they have no brains, they would not offend these two women for the sake of the one billion Spar." Chen Xiang saw through Dongfang Xinyue’s "interest".

He guessed that Dongfang Xinyue felt that this expert felt lonely, and felt that he shouldn’t have met a woman whose strength could rival hers. That was why he stayed in the profound Realm all day.

"Dongfang Yao is far from being worth a billion Spar, it’s just that those old fellows used it as a pretext to capture that Chen Xiang and use it as an excuse to attack that Chen Martial Continent." Dongfang Xinyue’s words made Chen Xiang secretly cursed in his heart.

This caused him to be overjoyed. Although being offered a reward was not a good thing, to be able to attract the attention of the number one power in this new world was a very honorable thing.

"Dong Fang Rong, do you know the origins of the Godly Weapon Empress and the Pill Fragrance Empress? If you can find out for me, I’ll give you this reward. " Dongfang Xinyue took out a large sword that was the size of a palm. From the Spirit grain’s glow and radiance, it seemed to be a very tall treasure.

Although it was just trash in Chen Xiang’s eyes, he still had to pretend to be surprised.

Seeing that Chen Xiang’s face was filled with desire, Dongfang Xinyue smiled lightly: I just want to find some women of equivalent strength to exchange pointers with.

So that is how it is. That means, the Warm Moon Elders are going to duel with them?

Chen Xiang was startled. He didn’t want to bring disaster to his two women, although this Dongfang Xinyue looked harmless, but who knew if she was a beauty with snakes and scorpions. Especially those kinds of jealous women, they were the most terrifying.

"No, hurry up and investigate their details. If someone is responsible for your dereliction of duty, I’ll help you carry it out." Dongfang Xinyue urged.

Now, Chen Xiang could tell that Dongfang Xinyue was actually so concerned about women. He smiled and said, "Clan Elder Warm Moon, there’s no need to investigate further. I have already investigated everything beforehand, and honestly speaking, I also want to obtain the bounty of one billion Spar.

"Speak." Dongfang Xinyue looked to be impatient.

"Let’s talk about this Godly weapon female emperor first, she cultivates the Icewind magic kungfu ..." Just as Chen Xiang finished speaking, Dongfang Xinyue’s face was immediately filled with shock, and her jade face even carried a trace of unusual excitement.

"She mainly uses refining to set up arrays. In this aspect, she is the same as the Warm Moon Elders. Her standards are not bad, and many experts of the Chen Martial Continent s want to invite her to refine some magical equipment at a high price." Chen Xiang continued to speak while secretly observing the changes in Dongfang Xinyue’s expression.

"Looks like I have to go meet this woman. I wonder how she compares to me." Dongfang Xinyue looked at the blue sky and muttered softly.

Chen Xiang continued to speak, "Then the reason why Chen Xiang received her protection is because her disciple Xue Xianxian is Chen Xiang’s wife, so ..."

"How is her disciple?" Dongfang Xinyue interrupted Chen Xiang and asked.

"Seems not bad. Although she rarely makes any moves, the fact that she became the disciple of the female Divine Weapon Emperor shows how talented she is." Chen Xiang understood all of these things the best, but seeing that Dongfang Xinyue had a reason to leave the place, Chen Xiang was extremely happy in his heart.

"Then what about the Pill Fragrance Queen?" Dongfang Xinyue asked again.

"It’s for concocting pills. There are only a few female Dan King s, I don’t think there are many of them in this new world!" Chen Xiang said.

"Indeed, it’s not many. Those old fellows who have roamed through many different worlds have never seen many Dan King s before, let alone female Dan King s." Dongfang Xinyue’s beautiful face suddenly calmed down, she tossed a treasure sword to Chen Xiang and asked: "Tell me the way to go to Chen Martial Continent."

"First, you can teleport to the Continent of the King. Then, you can teleport from there to there.

After Chen Xiang finished speaking, a gust of wind blew over accompanied with a heart penetrating fragrance, and the beauty had already disappeared.

"Big chested and brainless as expected!" Chen Xiang laughed to himself in his heart, and then activated Heaven tour method, taking a panoramic view of the Warm Moon Palace.
