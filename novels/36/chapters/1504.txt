Chen Xiang recovered the fastest, he rode the Frisbee and carefully headed towards the Holy armoured lion’s nest.

When they were near the canyon, Long Xueyi sighed in disappointment, "There are a lot of wolves there. Don’t go there, that place has already been occupied by a pack of wolves."

"It’s the White Wolf Tribe of the Holy Light. Damn it, with so many Holy armoured lion, this group of people got lucky." Chen Xiang sighed, they no longer had the energy to fight against such a strong herd of beasts.

"Why don’t you go over? Those lions should have lost their ability to resist. You can put them into the divine furnace." She had already recovered some of her strength, but her body was still soft.

"There’s a pack of Holy White Wolves. It’s likely that Saint Beasts have come as well. Our battle results have all been swallowed by them." Chen Xiang said in a low voice: "Let’s find a place to hide for the time being, we’ll talk after we completely recover."

"Then hide well, these wolves’ sense of smell must be very sensitive." Lv Qilian said softly.

Chen Xiang slightly exerted force to hug her close enough to let her body lie against him. That kind of feeling made him secretly praise her in his heart, especially that soft and gentle chest of Lv Qilian ... Little Lizhi saw that was taking advantage of him and cursed at him in his heart. At the same time, he used his weak strength to pinch Chen Xiang’s flesh, but as if he was scratching an itch for him, Chen Xiang continued to laugh.

"Large success Body of Heavenly Sage plus Devil-suppressing Golden Body, how did you refine your body?" Seeing that Chen Xiang recovered so quickly, Lv Qilian was extremely jealous in his heart.

"I was only able to cultivate it after suffering quite a bit. However, if you want to strengthen your physical body, I can find someone to help you." Chen Xiang said: "They are all women, but they have enmity with some forces, I don’t know if you dare to accept them or not."

Lv Qilian lifted her head slightly, her beautiful eyes were flashing with light as she looked at Chen Xiang: "Did you use Holy Spirit Rabbit blood? I’ve heard of this matter before, when Yu Xuelian stole those jade rabbits, I didn’t think that you would actually participate in it."

"I’ve been looking for Yu Xuelian, it’s just that I haven’t been able to find her. If you can contact her, then let her come to the Hundreds of Flowers Palace. The Divine Saber Immortal Palace doesn’t dare to do anything to me."

Chen Xiang said: "At that time, there were four Holy Spirit Rabbit, and other than me, there was also Mu Jialan and Yao Shumei. They both had a Holy Spirit Rabbit in their hands, so they should all be together.

"There are a lot of women who are related to you." Lv Qilian snorted lightly, "There’s still another Holy Spirit Rabbit. A man will turn into a woman when using Jade Rabbit Blood, you can’t be planning to keep it for yourself, right?"

After he finished speaking, Lv Qilian’s face revealed an enchanting smile, "The characteristics of the man on you is still there."

"Pei pei pei, I was a man doing well, why must I become a woman? Moreover, there are two beauties by my side right now, even if I don’t want to, I would not do such a foolish thing ..." The Jade Rabbit in my hand was sold by me and I exchanged some things with someone else. "

Chen Xiang lowered her head and looked straight into Lv Qilian’s beautiful eyes. Right now, he was hugging her with one hand and they were so close to each other, which couldn’t help but give rise to bold thoughts in his heart.

The disc was slowly flying, but Chen Xiang and Lv Qilian just stared at each other in silence.

"You want to kiss me?" Lv Qilian’s face revealed a playful smile, and when she saw Chen Xiang retract his gaze, she lightly snorted: "Even you wouldn’t dare to measure it."

Chen Xiang took a deep breath, bared his fangs and laughed: "I was originally hesitating, but now I am going to give it my all."

Hearing Chen Xiang’s words, the sneer on Lv Qilian’s face changed, and he said coldly: "Try it."

Chen Xiang had already moved his mouth closer to hers, and had even let go of the unconscious Little Lizhi.

Lv Qilian wanted to resist, but her entire body was soft. She wanted to bite Chen Xiang’s tongue hard, but Chen Xiang’s tongue carried a suction force that pulled her tongue out of Lv Qilian’s mouth.

"Bastard, do you want to die?" Lv Qilian sent a sound transmission to Chen Xiang, "Let go of my hand quickly, or else you’ll be in trouble."

"It was clearly your tongue that sucked me in. What are you blaming me for?" Chen Xiang was secretly shocked in his heart: "Don’t devour my power, I’m very weak and isn’t worth it for you to devour."

"Could it be a problem with my cultivation technique?" Lv Qilian immediately realized: "Do you have the habit of condensing spirit liquid anytime and anywhere?"

"Yes, but I don’t have any skill right now." Chen Xiang said.

"This is troublesome. We use our tongues to condense spirit liquids. After so many years, our tongues have become stained with the special characteristics of those spirit liquids. That’s why we are merging together now." Lv Qilian scolded him: "It’s all because of you, I won’t forgive you."

"If that’s the case, then we’ll just follow the will of the heavens and enjoy ourselves." Chen Xiang laughed, greedily sucking on Lv Qilian’s soft and fragrant tongue, causing him to feel extremely satisfied.

This was the first time Lv Qilian had experienced such a thing and could not resist, so she could only obey Chen Xiang, but in her heart, she continuously cursed at Chen Xiang. However, gradually, her face blushed a little, and a kind of indescribable wonderful feeling made her feel a little comfortable. She began to cater to Chen Xiang a little. With the help of the Jade Dragon Flower, she recovered very quickly. She opened her eyes, and when she heard some sounds coming from the side, she turned to look, and was immediately stunned.

At first, Little Lizhi had thought that she was dreaming, because this was simply too outrageous. The Asgard Mistress, who in her heart was a lofty existence, was actually hugging Chen Xiang, like a pair of hungry and thirsty lovers asking for each other’s love.

At first, she thought that Chen Xiang was the one who forced Lv Qilian, but when she saw that Lv Qilian was enjoying himself and was even taking the initiative to kiss him, she felt that they were getting closer to each other.

Little Lizhi closed her eyes and continued to pretend to be asleep, but her heart was like a roaring sea. She found it hard to accept this fact, even though Chen Xiang had mentioned before in front of her that he wanted to conquer Lv Qilian ... "Brat, let’s circulate our energy together to condense that spirit liquid." Lv Qilian whispered to Chen Xiang.

"Hehe, it must be great to kiss someone’s mouth. You haven’t even tried it at your age, you’re so lucky. This old cow will eat tender grass." Chen Xiang laughed.

"Hmph, I’ll show you sooner or later, don’t be too proud."

Lv Qilian had already accepted it, she had enjoyed it before and tried it before. This kind of thing was very mysterious to her, and now that she had tasted it, that feeling of novelty was no longer there. She just wanted to quickly separate from Chen Xiang so that she wouldn’t be seen by him.

"Hurry up and circulate your energy to condense the spirit liquid." Lv Qilian urged, she also wanted to see what kind of effect this would have.
