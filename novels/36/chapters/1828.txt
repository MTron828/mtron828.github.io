Penalty Heavenly God knew so much, and even knew so much about this Younger Nine Girl in front of him. This made Chen Xiang wonder if this Penalty Heavenly God was related to him.

"I can’t let it go. I’ve wasted so much time and effort just for this. I’m not willing to give up." Younger Nine Girl flew fiercely, looking as if he was about to swallow Chen Xiang whole.

Chen Xiang anxiously hid behind Penalty Heavenly God and laughed: "You are useless, the Six Realms mirrors is fated to be with me, I just merged it with just a drop of blood. Now, even if I give it to you, the Six Realms mirrors is not willing!"

Younger Nine Girl clenched her teeth as she stared at Chen Xiang. She didn’t really want the Six Realms mirrors, but she was very angry now, because after running around for so many years for the Six Realms mirrors, she was finally played like a monkey. All these years, she had endured much humiliation before being slapped by the red-haired old demon many times.

Although the red-haired old demon had already been killed by Chen Xiang, Younger Nine Girl still did not calm down.

"Right now, you have to consider the matter before you. Highest Devil God has already come out, and he already knows that you betrayed him. Penalty Heavenly God said in a serious tone: "Fortunately Highest Devil God doesn’t dare to disobey Supreme Divine Palace now, so he won’t act recklessly. But towards you, he doesn’t need to worry!"

Younger Nine Girl was even angrier now: "It’s none of my business, the red-haired old demon was killed by this brat, the Six Realms mirrors is also in his hands, why would Highest Devil God want to capture me!"

Chen Xiang anxiously said: "Young mistress Xiao Jiu, please do not tell anyone, help me keep this a secret, at least I helped you kill the red-haired old demon, and did not let the Six Realms mirrors fall into the hands of the Highest Devil God, for you, this should be a very venting of your anger!"

Younger Nine Girl snorted. She thought about it, and felt that she might be satisfied, but the benefits were already taken by Chen Xiang.

Penalty Heavenly God said: "Do you need my help? I will do my best to protect you so that you won’t be found by Highest Devil God. But you have to listen to me.

Chen Xiang asked: "Can’t she stay here? I think it’s good here!"

Younger Nine Girl shook his head: "Highest Devil God can easily find me. If I stay here, it will only bring him trouble!"

Penalty Heavenly God nodded his head, "That’s right, for your safety’s sake, I can only send you to that place. Highest Devil God is unable to reach that place, and he won’t be able to find that place either!"

Younger Nine Girl frowned. She already knew what kind of place it was and nodded her head helplessly.

"It can’t be... Divine Prison. " This place suddenly appeared in his mind. That place was indeed very safe inside the Divine Prison, and there was even the power of the True God that was affecting that place.

Younger Nine Girl stared at Chen Xiang: "That’s right, do you want to go there to accompany me!"

Chen Xiang curled his lips and said: "I’m not very familiar with you, why should I accompany you!"

Younger Nine Girl appeared beside Chen Xiang in a flash and kicked him hard on his butt. "You’re still saying that you’re not familiar with me, if it wasn’t for me, can you even obtain the Six Realms mirrors and the Divine Deity of the red-haired old demon? These are all good stuff, you heartless bastard!"

Chen Xiang rubbed his bottom, and laughed heartlessly: "This is all because of my luck, and it has nothing to do with you. If it wasn’t for me, you probably would have already been captured by that Highest Devil God, you should be thanking me!"

Penalty Heavenly God frowned, and said in a deep voice: "Stop being so noisy, I’ll send you to Divine Prison right now. Cultivate properly inside, as long as you enter the realm of the Supreme God, you will no longer be afraid of Highest Devil God!"

The Younger Nine Girl snorted, he closed his eyes and took a deep breath, then relaxed his entire body, only to see the Penalty Heavenly God taking out an array disc. He controlled the array disc to float above the Younger Nine Girl, and the array spun, releasing a silver light beam to envelop the Younger Nine Girl.

Chen Xiang asked: "Penalty Heavenly God, what the hell is wrong with her? Didn’t she betray Nine Divine Kings back then? I had thought that she was the Mei Emperor.

Penalty Heavenly God said: "She didn’t betray Nine Divine Kings, she just wanted to help Nine Divine Kings ... That’s why she did it, it’s just that she never succeeded, and instead wasted a lot of things searching for Six Realms mirrors. That’s why she’s so angry right now! "

Chen Xiang said in shock, "Doesn’t that mean Nine Divine Kings and Feng Yujie misunderstood her?!"

The Penalty Heavenly God nodded her head, "This is exactly the effect that she wants. Only then can she successfully approach the Highest Devil God and gain the trust of the Highest Devil God. does not truly trust her! "

Chen Xiang suddenly felt extremely guilty, because the Supreme god bone in his body was prepared by the Nine Divine Kings for the Younger Nine Girl, it was just that at that time, the Nine Divine Kings thought that the Younger Nine Girl had been devoured by the Evil Spirit, and did not hand the Supreme god bone over to the Younger Nine Girl.

"Does she have a name?" Chen Xiang asked again. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

"No, she would only approve if Nine Divine Kings gave her a name, so for all these years, she has always been called this way." A look of guilt flashed across Penalty Heavenly God Xiang’s face as he said: "You don’t have to feel guilty. You have obtained the Supreme god bone.

Chen Xiang curled his lips: "How do you know that?! Where exactly do you come from!"

Penalty Heavenly God’s face sank, with a stern look on his face: "One of the Divine Kings is my grandfather!"

"This ..." Chen Xiang was stunned, no wonder the Penalty Heavenly God was so powerful and knew about such a thing.

He suddenly suspected that the Devil-killing Heavenly God might also be related to the Divine King, if not why would his relationship with the Penalty Heavenly God be so good.

His father cultivated the Heavenly Body and Heavenly Alchemy, so his whereabouts were unknown. His grandfather was also a Divine King, and he was also an outstanding Divine God.

"Penalty Heavenly God, do you know what happened inside the Nine Heaven Devil Palace now?" Chen Xiang felt that Penalty Heavenly God should know something.

"I don’t know, not even my father." Penalty Heavenly God shook his head: "You must not try to enter Nine Heaven Devil Palace now!"

Now Chen Xiang understood why the Azure Dragon that year was only profound God’s, and was willing to make Penalty Heavenly God his friend. It turned out that this Penalty Heavenly God knew that the Azure Dragon was a powerful Divine Beast from that year, and in the future, the Azure Dragon would awaken its memories, possessing the strength of its previous life.

"I never thought that the great battle would end so soon. From today onwards, the reputation of the Hell Devil Emperor will forever disappear." Penalty Heavenly God closed his eyes, as if he was there.

"Hell Devil Emperor is dead." Chen Xiang said in pleasant surprise. The battle between Hell Divine Palace and him had not been held long ago, yet there was actually a conclusion to the battle.

The Penalty Heavenly God shook his head: "No, it’s just that the Hell Divine Palace is heavily injured, all the gods are injured, and I am going to take over the Infernal Realm. This is something that the all divine palaces has already tacitly approved." No ad please go to
