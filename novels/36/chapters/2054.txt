"Little scoundrel, aren’t you afraid of being poisoned to death? "My poison is extremely potent..." Although Lv Qinlian was struggling, her face was still filled with a charming smile, and her eyes were still filled with a kind of faint anticipation.

"It’s worth it even if I die!" Chen Xiang laughed, and gently hugged Lv Qinlian. He kissed her cherry lips a few times, but she didn’t resist, she only catered to Chen Xiang.

At this time, Lv Qinlian did not know why, but he felt that his body was warm and he released an intoxicating smell, causing him to take a deep breath.

"That is my poison... I can’t control it. " As Lv Qinlian spoke, her small mouth was also emitting a rich fragrance. After Chen Xiang breathed in a few mouthfuls of the fragrance, he became even more infatuated with it.

Lv Qinlian was initially worried, but after seeing that Chen Xiang was able to absorb so much without doing anything, he was at ease. Now that Chen Xiang had cultivated his Bones, his body was already extremely strong, and could resist the poison in Lv Qinlian’s body.

"Ugh ..." "Little Scoundrel!" Lv Qinlian could feel that Chen Xiang was extremely infatuated with her, and even hugged her very tightly. She also seemed to be a little intoxicated, and unknowingly, she started to kiss Chen Xiang who had forgotten about herself, rolling on the soft grass.

After half an hour, Lv Qinlian woke up from her stupor and her body had been petted by Chen Xiang’s hands. She was worried that the two of them would do something intimate in such an environment, so she had to quickly stop it from happening.

"Enough, we can’t stay here!" Her beautiful and cute nose wrinkled, and smelled the remaining fragrance of her body from Chen Xiang’s body. Although it was no longer poisonous, once she went closer, she would definitely be smelt.

Yue’er had also flown out at this time. She had clearly been back since a long time ago, but she didn’t want to disturb Chen Xiang, so she hid at the side. She was no longer surprised by Chen Xiang’s actions.

"You have my scent on you, quickly remove it!" It’s not good to be discovered by my sister. I keep having the feeling that she’s a little against you in her heart. " Lv Qinlian said, a little worried that her sister would find out about his relationship with Chen Xiang.

Chen Xiang laughed, "To think that you are her younger sister! She was just faking it. She had already made love to me a long time ago ... Hehe, Xianxian and Elder Sister Meng’er are both aware of this, and had even slept with me before. "

"Huh?" Lv Qinlian was extremely shocked, she never thought that Lv Qilian would have been like Chen Xiang, or that he would be like her, who was also like Chen Xiang.

"Sister Qinlian, take me to Bing Yan! Although she and I have not been separated for long, Super God Realm and this place have different times. To her, it has been a long time since she and I have separated. " Yue’er flew in front of Lv Qinlian and let him carry her.

Lv Qinlian said worriedly, "Yue’er, I have poison in my body, I’m worried that it will poison you!" In her eyes, Yue Er was still just a little kitten. She was worried that if she accidentally released that kind of Poisonous scent, Yue’er wouldn’t be able to handle it.

"It’s alright, I also smelled that poison just now!" Actually, I know that your actual body is that of a lotus. Yue’er playfully rubbed against Lv Qinlian’s chest, making Chen Xiang jealous.

"I am... "Poison Love Emperor Lotus?" This was the first time Lv Qinlian heard this name, "I asked Sister Feng, she doesn’t know where I come from, and Grandma Lv doesn’t know either. I didn’t expect you to know this! "Is there anything special about this Exorcist Emperor Lotus?"

Chen Xiang really wanted to know as well. The first time he had nearly been poisoned to death by the strange fragrance from Lv Qinlian’s body, he already knew that Lv Qinlian was no ordinary Lotus Goblin.

Yue’er replied, "What’s even more peculiar is the aphrodisiac in your body. It’s also the fragrance from earlier! Actually, you don’t have to worry about it. This kind of body fragrance has a lot to do with your emotions! If you failed to control the poison initially, it would become extremely toxic, and even those with high resistance would suffer! If I am unable to control this poison, it will easily harm the people around me. "

Lv Qinlian nodded. "I didn’t dare to be with others until I could control the release of this poison ... "However, I lost control just now."

Yue’er laughed. "That’s because your emotions and emotions have reached a state of extreme excitement. You know your heart best, so you released it! The only thing is that the poison you release is rather special, it’s something that is specifically used on your most beloved opposite sex! "

Chen Xiang asked anxiously: "What do you mean? I’m poisoned? "

"He has been poisoned, and it’s a very powerful poison!" You’re the only one who knows how to take this poison, and I could smell that it would be fine, because this poison was released based on Sister Qinlian’s feelings and feelings for you! That is to say, you are her lover, her most beloved! If you want to abandon her in the future, or kill her, or if she hates you ... ... I don’t know what will happen if the poison in your body flares up, because there has never been such an example. " Yue Er said.

Chen Xiang shivered. "Yue’er, I know young master, please don’t scare me!"

Yue’er continued, "I really won’t scare you! Sister Qinlian, you probably rarely use the Poisonous scent you have on you, right? "

Lv Qinlian was surprised by the effectiveness of her poison, she could not believe it, but she had to confirm if it was real. Unless she really hated Chen Xiang, she would never do it, she would not do it even if she loved him.

"I rarely use it, because it’s very dangerous. I’m worried that it might harm the people around me." Lv Qinlian nodded.

"Actually, you don’t have to worry! Now that you are free to start using the Poisonous scent on your body, then this kind of Poisonous scent will also follow your own will, and will poison others. For example, the people who have a good relationship with you, or the people who are not your enemies, will not be poisoned. " Yue’er replied, "Aromatic Emperor Lotuses are extremely rare. Basically, there’s no Aromatic Emperor Lotus after the transformation. I also read about it from ancient books."

"You should be able to control your Poisonous scent at the second stage! If it is the third stage, then your Poisonous scent will no longer be venom, but the strange aroma of healing and detoxification. The fourth stage might also be able to increase one’s strength, and through the infection of other people’s emotions, it will be able to awaken the hidden strength in the depths of the human body. "

Lv Qinlian was extremely shocked, "Is he really that powerful? I actually don’t know anything about myself! "

Yue’er meowed. "I’ve read about this in the books. I’m not sure if it’s true or not, but you can verify it in the future!"

Seeing Yue’er making Chen Xiang’s hair stand on end, Lv Qinlian smiled and said, "Good little brother, don’t worry, I won’t hate you!" As he said that, he kissed Chen Xiang on the cheek, telling him not to worry anymore.

"Let’s go find Bing Yan!" Lv Qinlian hugged Yue’er, his face full of joyous smile as he walked in the sea of flowers.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m
