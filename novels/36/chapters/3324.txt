Chen Xiang looked at Lei Yichen’s room, he really wanted to rush over and smash that door to pieces, and let Lei Yichen, who was inside, out to help him deal with his archenemies.

"Junior Chen Xiang greets all the seniors! Various seniors have truly improved very quickly, it seems like we have all gained a lot from entering the Ancient Fire Divine Sect. " Chen Xiang laughed heartily, walked over and sat on a chair.

When Zhu Qingneng saw Chen Xiang, he almost rushed forward to slap Chen Xiang to death. However, he did not do anything because he had already investigated Lei Yichen’s situation clearly before they came here.

Lei Yichen was an elder. Although this elder did not have much power, it was true that Lei Yichen was the youngest looking elder in the inner sect of Ancient Fire Divine Sect. This was mainly because Lei Yichen’s master had a certain amount of power in the Ancient Fire Divine Sect.

Lei Yichen had not accepted any disciples for many years, and now that he had accepted Chen Xiang as a disciple, it could be said to be extremely rare. Everyone in the Ancient Fire Divine Sect knew that Lei Yichen was extremely picky with his disciples, and Chen Xiang was able to enter Lei Yichen’s eyes before even reaching Aoshi Holy Stage.

If they were to take Chen Xiang down that easily, when Lei Yichen got angry, he would definitely exterminate them!

The strongest among these Fierce Saber Race and Profound Practitioners were only at the middle stage of Aoshi Holy Stage. Although they came from a powerful clan, they did not dare to act rashly in the face of Lei Yichen, who was at the late stage of Aoshi Holy Stage.

For Lei Yichen to be able to become an elder in the Ancient Fire Divine Sect and possess the strength of an expert in the later stages of Aoshi Holy Stage, this point could not be underestimated.

"Why did all of you seniors come to find my master?" Chen Xiang asked: "My master is currently in closed door cultivation to refine artifacts, he cannot come out for the time being." Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

"We have important matters to discuss with him. I wonder if it would be convenient for us to let him out now?" Zhu Qingneng said coldly.

"I’ll try!" As Chen Xiang sat in the hall, he also felt that the atmosphere wasn’t right, which made him feel uncomfortable. After all, they were all his enemies, and all of them were stronger than him. He had to hurry up and let Lei Yichen come out to hold the fort!

Chen Xiang entered Lei Yichen’s room. There was a stone door in the room, and that was Lei Yichen’s secret room.

"Master, I’m in trouble!" Chen Xiang immediately caused his own voice to tremble.

Only then would Lei Yichen know, that he was waiting outside, and even if Lei Yichen heard, he would need some time to stop the work at hand before he could come out.

"I wonder why these fellows are looking for Master!" Chen Xiang muttered to himself in his heart.

"Anyway, nothing good will happen." Feng Ke’er said: "Luckily your master is not bad, I will definitely help you this time."

Chen Xiang waited for a moment, then opened the door.

Lei Yichen frowned, Chen Xiang anxiously sent a sound transmission to him, telling him of Zhu Qingneng and the others’ arrival.

"Don’t worry, nothing will happen to you." Lei Yichen patted Chen Xiang’s shoulder, and then, he brought Chen Xiang out.

After Lei Yichen arrived, he swept his eyes across this group of people. Then, with a look as though he was very busy, he said, "If there’s anything you want to say, just say it!"

Lei Yichen was very straightforward, if not because of etiquette, he would have immediately said: "If you don’t have any fart, hurry up and let it out, I am busy!"

That was why he did not have a good expression on his face for this group of people to see. Furthermore, he was an elder in the Ancient Fire Divine Sect, so when this group of people saw him coming out, they all sat there like paralyzed lords. They did not have the intention to greet him.

Lei Yichen could bear it, but Chen Xiang could not.

"Master, didn’t you tell me that you were an elder of the Ancient Fire Divine Sect? It can’t be that you’re bragging! " Chen Xiang suddenly said: "These people are just inner sect disciples, and they just entered Ancient Fire Divine Sect not long ago, why are they not respectful in the slightest? "Looks like you’re not some inner court elder at all."

"Of course I am an elder. You also know that they are disciples who just entered the inner court. They do not know courtesy or anything like that, so I don’t blame them." Lei Yichen said indifferently, and secretly praised Chen Xiang in his heart, he indeed felt very dissatisfied with this group of elders.

Lei Yichen swept his eyes across this group of people, that look in his eyes seemed to be telling Zhu Qingneng and the others, ’I am an elder, why don’t you all kneel and bow to me?

Seeing the displeasure on Lei Yichen’s face, they finally each and every one of them lifted up their ten thousand kilograms worth of butt, stood up, and unwillingly bowed to Lei Yichen.

"It’s still considered enlightened." Lei Yichen laughed: "If you have anything to say, then say it quickly!"

At this time, Zhu Qingneng was about to sit down when he heard Chen Xiang shouting loudly: "Impudent, my master still hasn’t asked you to sit down!"

Zhu Qingneng yelled out in anger, but he did not dare to sit down, because Lei Yichen’s expression was tense and his eyes were filled with coldness.

"We have come here today to discuss an extremely important matter with Elder Lei." Zhu Qingneng looked at Chen Xiang with a cold expression.

"Speak, don’t dilly-dally." Lei Yichen was getting impatient.

"Elder Lei, although you are of high standing and prestige, we still have to tell you that you must not ruin your reputation just because of a moment of confusion." Zhu Qingneng mustered a lot of courage, because the fact that Lei Yichen doted on him far surpassed their expectations.

"The beloved disciple you just accepted had once killed my son, and at the same time, also killed a genius disciple from the Soul River Divine Race. His methods are extremely cruel, and he is not worthy of being your disciple."

The other elders quickly nodded their heads.

"We came here today because we hoped that you would be able to dissolve the relationship between master and disciple with Chen Xiang and hand it over to us. Let us punish him." Zhu Qingneng said again.

After Chen Xiang heard this, he became furious and said coldly: "You bunch of bastards, you better understand that it was that genius from the Soul River Divine Race who attacked me! Back then Qin Shuang had a Purple Yang Excalibur, so not only did Zhu Haiprofound covet it, he also covet Qin Shuang’s beauty and was killed by her, so it is well-deserved. "

"Chen Xiang has already told me about this. You still want to snatch the Crystal emperor on his body, right? Him taking the Crystal emperor from the Purple Yang Divine Palace is something that he deserves. The entire way you guys chased him here, you probably want to kill him for the sake of the Crystal emperor. " Lei Yichen laughed coldly: "Good, I will hand him over to you all right now. If you guys have enmity, then take revenge! Chen Xiang, stand down! "

As expected, Chen Xiang walked into the hall.

"If you guys have a grudge, then attack." Lei Yichen said indifferently, and then took a sip of tea.

After drinking the tea, Lei Yichen frowned: "What are you all doing sitting here? Aren’t you here for revenge? Kill him quickly, or what are you doing here? Are you trying to make fun of me? I am refining and am still in high spirits, you have already disturbed me, didn’t you say that there was something important? Are you kidding me! "

Zhu Qingneng and the others really did not think that Chen Xiang would actually tell them about this. They thought that Chen Xiang would definitely not tell anyone about the Crystal emperor, because after imagining themselves as Chen Xiang, they thought that Chen Xiang would definitely keep the secret of the Crystal emperor a secret.
