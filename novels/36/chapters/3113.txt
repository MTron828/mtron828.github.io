Chen Xiang had never seen the Myriad Tao Dan God with his own eyes before. He had initially planned to go to the Myriad Tao to look for him, but now that he found out that the Myriad Tao Dan God was dead, he could not believe it. (iv) Four hundred and ten (5) (iv); (iv) (iv) (v) (v) (v) (v) (v) (v) (v) (v) (v) (v) (v) (v) (v) (v) (v) (v) (v) (v) (v) (v)

"I don’t know. In short, he is dead, so my relationship with him is pretty good. I am currently investigating this matter, but in short, this matter is not that simple!" You need to be clear, people who are able to reach Myriad Tao are all very strong, they would not die so easily, but now, he is dead. " Mentioning this matter, Wang Dao’s expression turned grave, "If I don’t clarify this matter, then I might be the one to die in the future."

"Could it be that there is a very strong power above the Myriad Tao?" Chen Xiang frowned: "It’s actually that dangerous up there!"

"Where there are people, that’s how it is. No matter where you go, it’s full of danger." Wang Dao waved his hand and said, "Let’s not talk about this anymore, hurry up and refine the pill!" The name of this pill is Wudao spiritual Dan, and I do not really know the effects, just eat it and you will know how strong it is. "

Chen Xiang looked at the herbs in the box and asked: "How many of these herbs can be refined?"

Forging one requires two medicinal ingredients, one flower and one fruit. They are called the Pathless Flower and the fruit respectively, and while the fruit looks very ordinary, the mysterious power contained within is very strange and powerful. Even after eating these two medicinal ingredients alone, one can feel an obvious increase in strength. Wang Dao said seriously, "Are you sure you want to refine it now? If anything happens, don’t blame me for it will be very dangerous! "

Chen Xiang said as he nodded his head, "I have already confirmed that I want to consume this kind of pellet myself! There is a very strong Heaven Old Orcs waiting for me at the top. "

Chen Xiang wanted to become stronger so he could eat World Defying heavenly Dan s, but World Defying heavenly Dan s required a lot of time to grow their medicinal ingredients and it was also rather difficult to refine. Now that he had the ready-made medicinal ingredients to refine a pill that could allow him to cultivate immoral powers, he would of course first consider refining this kind of Wudao spiritual Dan.

"There are ten batches of herbs here. If you do not fail, you can refine ten of them!" I imagine that right now, Old Ji needs only eat two pills to make his breakthrough. " After Wang Dao finished speaking, he sat on the ground and said, "You can begin refining. I’ll guide you later!"

Refining Wudao spiritual Dan was very dangerous because there was a type of power that could make a person’s soul fly out of their body.

After Chen Xiang took out the Tianchuang furnace, just as he was about to put the herbs inside, he heard a light cry out.

"Has your furnace been smeared over the Myriad Tao Divine Soil?" Wang Dao saw through it with a glance and felt very surprised.

"Yes!" Chen Xiang also did not hide it.

"Alright, if that’s the case, then you’ll be safer when refining it." Wang Dao laughed, "Because Myriad Tao Divine Soil can absorb some of the soul extinguishing power released by these immoral medicinal materials."

"Really?" Chen Xiang’s eyes lit up, he felt that if the Heavenly magic sword was placed inside, then that kind of dangerous situation might not even happen.

"Of course, I only found out about this later on when I was still above Myriad Tao." Wang Dao sighed, "It’s a pity that there aren’t many of these Myriad Tao Divine Soil."

Chen Xiang placed the Pathless Flower and fruit into the Tianchuang furnace, and then began to slowly refine the two medicinal ingredients by releasing a certain degree of flames according to Wang Dao’s instructions.

"After burning for around fourteen hours or so, a change will appear in the two medicinal ingredients."

Chen Xiang looked at the inside of the Tianchuang furnace, where the Flowerless Flower Fruit was currently a dark green, and the more violently it was burned, the greener it became.

"Don’t be anxious. Don’t think that just by using a strong flame you can cause the medicinal plant to change color faster. Although it is possible, if you do this, it will easily mess up the tempo!" Wang Dao saw that Chen Xiang was a little impatient, and said: "Refining this kind of Wudao spiritual Dan is very different from refining other pills, you have to listen to me."

Right now, there was only an ethereal spirit present. He couldn’t concoct pills directly, or else he would definitely do it himself.

"En!" Chen Xiang calmed himself down. Now he had to follow the instructions of the king.

Sure enough, after fourteen hours, the flower fruit inside could finally change color and turn blue. At this moment, it was flashing with blue light!

"Double the intensity of the flames." Wang Dao looked at the Tianchuang furnace and said: "You must remember, you cannot rush there. In the end, you don’t need to condense your own pellet for this kind of pellet."

"Could it be that he can form his own core?" Chen Xiang had doubled the strength of the World Defying god fire, and at this time, the fire had become even more intense, but the two herbs were extremely calm, and only emitted a hint of blue mist.

"No, you’ll know when you get to the end." Wang Dao smiled mysteriously.

"There’s going to be a change in color next, right?" Chen Xiang asked.

"Yes, three times."

"I want to use the power of time. That way, I can move faster." Chen Xiang said: "Uncle must be really anxious waiting outside, I don’t know if this will affect my pill refining."

"This will not affect you!" I didn’t expect you to have mastered the power of time. " Wang Dao was still surprised that Chen Xiang had so many tricks up his sleeve.

"Mm, then I’ll start using it." When Chen Xiang released the Time Domain, it was different from outside.

"It will take about fourteen days for the second color change to occur." After entering, he sensed the temperature of Chen Xiang’s pill furnace and nodded: "Your control of fire is not bad."

"Of course, I’ve been concocting pills for a long time." Chen Xiang was very confident in his alchemy level.

After fourteen days, Chen Xiang saw that the flower fruits inside the Tianchuang furnace had changed color again, this time into a red one.

"What’s next?" Chen Xiang asked.

"How much stronger can your flame be?" Wang Dao asked.

"It can be increased by about three times." Chen Xiang thought about it and said.

"Alright, I’ll use your strongest flame to burn it." Wang Dao said in a serious tone: "Next up, it will probably be a little dangerous, at that time, you should be able to hold on, this is also a test for a Alchemist." Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Chen Xiang had been waiting this whole time, but now that it was finally here, he had to deal with it seriously.

"About what time?" Chen Xiang asked again.

"I don’t know. If you were to come, you would have passed through that hurdle. This pill is basically a success." Wang Dao sat together and said, "Be more serious. I’ll wait here for you to succeed."

Chen Xiang carefully controlled the flames to burn the medicinal ingredients in the furnace.

In the blink of an eye, a month had passed. At this time, Chen Xiang’s body suddenly trembled.

"Are they coming?" Chen Xiang didn’t know why, but his head suddenly started to ache, as though a surge of power was flowing into his Divine Sense Sea.

Seeing Chen Xiang’s reaction, Wang Dao shouted: "Yes, you must defend yourself, don’t let this power break through your Divine Sense Sea’s defense, if this power touches your soul, then it’s dangerous."

"This should be the Seamless Spiritual Force ..." It’s a very mysterious power, able to easily destroy the soul! "
