CHAPTER 400 – THREE DAYS

Hearing Chen Xiang say this, the people standing behind Wang Quan were furious. Just as they were thinking of criticizing Chen Xiang, Wang Quan raised his hand to stop them.

“You are just like your teacher! Indeed, it was my mistake. In the future, no one is going to stop someone during the competition!” Wang Quang actually restrained his anger. Although he was a bit angry in his heart, he still held back.

“Chen Xiang, don’t think that just because your teacher is Huang Jintian, you can not show respect to your elders!” A luxuriously dressed young man who was standing behind Wang Quang angrily said.

Chen Xiang sneered: “What about it, not to mention my teacher, even my Great Senior Brother is a lot stronger than Senior Wang, and forget even my Great Senior Brother who had ascended, my eldest martial nephew standing beside me is also as strong as Senior Wang!”

Chen Xiang’s words made Wang Quan furious.

“Chen Xiang, you... did Huang Jintian made you speak as such?” Wang Quan’s entire face was laced with anger, while Gu Dongchen also pulled Chen Xiang a bit.

Chen Xiang smiled and said, “He indeed spoke to me as such, he also said that you are not his match in this life, that’s why he is holding some bullshit Kings’ Martial Arts Meet to show off his power.”

“Master, let me teach him a lesson,” another young man standing behind Wang Quan loudly said.

“Teach me a lesson? Little Bald, someone wants to fight me, what do you think I should do?” Chen Xiang laughed and said.

Wu Kaiming sighed: “Let him give it a try, then he will understand.”

Gu Dongchen laughed and said, “Old Wang, Young Martial Uncle’s character is just like this, however, you should still control you apprentice a bit, don’t ever let him arbitrarily teach a lesson to this Little Madman! Otherwise, his death is not related to us in any way.”

Having heard Gu Dongchen and Wu Kaiming’s statements, the youth who was clamoring to teach Chen Xiang a lesson had an ugly look covered his face. Gu Dongchen’s strength was unfathomable, although he didn’t cultivate the Tai Chi Subduing Dragon Exercise, he was the Dean of Extreme Martial Sect after all; he was definitely extraordinary.

Wu Kaiming was worried that Chen Xiang would continue to stir up trouble, so he pulled Chen Xiang to another place to prepare him to participate in the next round.

“To tell you honestly, this Little Madman’s alchemy skills are not taught by our Junior Sister! As for whom he learned from, I am also not clear. In short, he is a very powerful guy. It’s quite possible that it was the same guy who had saved him last time on the Heroes Mountain!” After Chen Xiang and Wu Kaiming were far away, Gu Dongchen spoke in a low voice.

Wang Quan frowned: “Isn’t taught by Elder Dan? Are you sure?”

Gu Dongchen nodded: “I’m sure. Even before he had joined the Extreme Martial Sect, his alchemy skills were already superb, furthermore, he had also mastered a few extremely powerful martial exercises, like the True Qi fire wings, some other Dragon Martial Techniques, and many others. You can investigate these things. There is obviously some powerful figure behind him!”

Wang Quan had a solemn look on his face, he indeed had heard of the happenings of the Heroes Mountain. The sudden disappearance and appearance of Chen Xiang in front of many people was indeed not the work of Huang Jintian. Furthermore, Chen Xiang had also shared a map which pointed to a mysterious realm that had many martial arts and mysterious records from the ancient period.

And when Chen Xiang had said that it was given to him by someone, Gu Dongchen could verify that he was not lying.

“Therefore, you really have to control your apprentice better, and it will not be us who are going to take any action but rather the figure that is standing beside him!” Gu Dongchen stared at those young men, whereas, those young men were drenched in sweat.

“Of course, if you can injure him in a competition in a fair and square manner, then there won’t be anything. Although you and I are powerhouses of a mainland, we are both clear that we are not the strongest in this vast Mortal Martial World.”

Gu Dongchen said this to tell Wang Quang that he should not turn his enmity with Huang Jintian at Chen Xiang, or else, he would come to regret it.

“Don’t worry, I’m not so stupid! If I hated that Old Madman, I would have long gone to your Extreme Martial Sect and fight it out with him.” Wang Quan faintly smiled.

Gu Dongchen smiled and left towards the fading figure of Wu Kaiming and Chen Xiang and disappeared in the blink of an eye.

“Young Martial Uncle, we don’t have much time! We just have three days, in these three days you have to enter the top fifty, or else you will be unable to proceed to the next round,” said Wu Kaiming.

Chen Xiang and Wu Kaiming were presently sitting in a stone building. Chen Xiang, while watching through the window at the passersby, yawned: “How many rounds are actually there?”

“I am not sure about this, I only know that you have to enter the top fifty within the next three days, or else, you won’t be able to proceed to the final round!” Wu Kaiming said while shaking his head.

“Alright, tell me about the rules!” Chen Xiang lazily said. He just wanted to fight those King’s Vein martial artists as early as possible.

Taking out a sheet, Wu Kaiming spread it on the table and gestured Chen Xiang to come closer.

“In the top fifty, not all of the participants are King’s Vein martial artists, some of them are just a bit talented and are extremely strong. However, in the final round, only four will have the chance to compete in front of many people!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Chen Xiang noticed that the sheet was jam packed with dense characters.

“Next, you are going to challenge the participants who are under fifty for their points. And as long as your points are more than that of the participants who are in top fifty, you no longer need to challenge anyone.”

Chen Xiang took a glance at the sheet and discovered that the top fifty had a large number of points, especially the first who actually had more than 10,000 points, while the one on the fiftieth position also had as much as 3,000 points.

“Don’t underestimate 3,000 points. If you win, you will get a point, if you lose, a point will be deducted, and when you have zero points, you will be eliminated. At the beginning, every participant will be rewarded with a point!” Wu Kaiming said.

Chen Xiang said with a surprise, “You mean to say, that the guy in the first place had won more than 10,000 matches? How long did it take for him to fight?”

“Of course not, if your opponent has 1,000 points and you happen to win, then you will win his 1,000 points, then he would once again start with 1 point and continue to fight.”

Chen Xiang now understood: “So to say, the top fifty can not be challenged.”

“That’s right! At first, when many participants who had a lot of points were defeated, came to worry that all of their points will be lost, so the rules were modified and the participants who have entered the top fifty were no longer allowed to fight; fewer points does not mean that they are any weaker.”

“So I now have to find participants who had a lot of points as well and are ranked under fifty and challenge them, right!?” Chen Xiang said.

“Yes, and the deadline is after three days, after which the ranking will be finalized. That’s why you have to enter top fifty within three days! And those participants are going to have to accept the challenges, whereas challenging those who have a lot of points is also riskier, for they are relatively stronger.”

Chen Xiang pointed at a name and said, “I am going to challenge him, he has 2,000 points!”

“He...He seems to be an Extreme State King’s Vein martial artist, before, he used to be in the first position but he was defeated, so he is very strong. However, he seems to have suffered injuries, but it’s difficult to say.”

Chen Xiang smiled: “Little Bald, you are not confident in my strength?”

“Of course not, only this guy has some strange powers, I think that it would be more appropriate to challenge these guys, they have 1,400 and 1,500 points respectively. These three are the strongest under the top fifty, furthermore, they don’t challenge each other, and also received fewer challenges from others. Most of the time, it’s them who challenge others.”

Upon taking a glance at their points, Chen Xiang’s was enlivened: “Alright, I will first fight with the guys with 1,400 points and 1,500 points, and then fight with the guy with 2,000 points, so that I can rank a bit higher!”
