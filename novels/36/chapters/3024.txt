The aura released by the Dao Jing bead was extremely strong, and even if Chen Xiang wanted to hide it, it would be difficult.

It might be because he had already stepped into the World Defying Stage and cultivated an unparalleled profound body, so he did not put the Venerable Ancestor Later-stage in his eyes at all. He had not paid any attention to the two World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect s just now, and directly took out the Dao Jing bead.

The auras released by the Dao Jing bead were extremely strong, and were immediately sensed by the people from the two World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect s. They immediately rushed over at a very fast speed.

"What are you doing here?" One of the middle aged man shouted loudly, his eyes revealed a greedy light as he looked at the Dao Jing bead in Chen Xiang’s hand.

"I came here to search for the Secret Inheritance Formation. However, after I came here, I saw that the Secret Inheritance Formation had been found by you, so I started to look for the next one." Chen Xiang answered honestly, he did not want to lower himself to the same level as these people.

In the Myriad Tao Mausoleum, searching for an Inheritance Secret Array was a very common thing. Chen Xiang would meet many people there who search for an Inheritance Secret Array. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

"Oh? I think you want to ambush us! " The middle-aged man sneered and said, "That’s why we said such words when we found out about it!"

The other middle-aged man said coldly: "Fortunately, you did not attack, otherwise, the only outcome would be death! But you scared us and even sent us here, wasting a lot of our time. My time is very precious! "

Chen Xiang frowned, and asked: "What do you guys want?"

The middle-aged man laughed, "What do you want? Of course it’s to make you compensate us, we just received quite a bit of shock! Give us the pearl in your hand, and we will let this matter go! "

"Otherwise... "Hum, hum, hum!" The other middle-aged man snorted, looking at Chen Xiang with eyes full of threat.

"Or what?" Chen Xiang kept the Dao Jing bead. "I’m not afraid of you!"

"Haha, you’re not afraid of us? That’s because you’re ignorant! " The slightly taller middle-aged man couldn’t help but laugh, "If you know what’s good for you, then quickly take out that pearl."

"You haven’t answered my question! If I do not give it to you, what will happen to me? " Chen Xiang looked to be extremely calm. All these people in front of him were from the World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect, so he had always hated the World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect, he had only felt that they were from the Venerable Ancestor Later-stage, and that they were weaker than him by this much. Furthermore, he had some sort of enmity with them, so he did not plan to make a move on them.

However, these two wanted to snatch his Dao Jing bead, so he had no choice but to take action.

"You will die!" The middle-aged man laughed loudly: "We are from the World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect! Even if you are a frog in a well, you must have heard of the great name of our World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect, so you should still obediently hand over that pearl! "

"Is it this pearl?" Chen Xiang said indifferently as he took out the Dao Jing bead.

"Yes, you are so obedient!" The middle-aged man immediately walked over and reached for it.

However, the moment he touched the Dao Jing bead, he immediately felt that something was amiss. His hand actually stuck onto the pearl and he was unable to retract it.

"You ... What exactly did you do? " The middle-aged man screamed out in shock, because he could feel that his Dao power was continuously pouring into the pearl.

"Shall I give you the beads?" Chen Xiang laughed sinisterly, and then fiercely slapped this middle-aged man’s face.

Pah! -

When Chen Xiang’s palm landed on the middle-aged man’s face, a burst of violent flames exploded out.

When the middle aged man at the side saw this, he was extremely shocked. He immediately knew that Chen Xiang was from World Defying Stage, so he did not plan to save his comrades.

"We are from World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect!" The middle-aged man shouted in shock.

"I know you are from the World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect. Chen Xiang said: "You also said that if I don’t give the Dao Jing bead to you, you will die! I don’t want to give it to you, and I don’t want to die either, so I can only kill you! "

After he finished speaking, Chen Xiang’s palm fell onto the other cheek of the middle-aged man.

"Originally, nothing happened to you all! But who told you to have malicious thoughts and want to rob someone else’s things? Stealing is never right, and you, a dignified World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect’s disciple, actually did such a thing. It’s better if you all don’t live. " Chen Xiang struck his palm towards the middle-aged man’s chest. Heaven Blasting Palm power, accompanied by a strong World Defying god fire s, surged out, instantly burning the middle-aged man’s body into mist.

The other middle-aged man was also killed by his palm strike!

"That’s fine too. I don’t need to go around them anymore. This Inheritance Formation belongs to me." Chen Xiang walked over to the secret inheritance array, just now the two people had already placed Dao crystal s inside, just that it was not there yet, he only needed to place a little more and he would be able to open it.

As soon as he walked over, he immediately felt movement around him.

"There’s actually someone nearby. If I hadn’t released my Spatial Perception, I wouldn’t be able to sense it at all. These guys’ concealing abilities aren’t weak!" Chen Xiang was astonished. He didn’t know who was following him, and it seemed like they had been following him for a very long time already.

He pretended not to notice and continued to place the Dao crystal into the inheritance array bit by bit.

Just as he was about to finish setting them up, a few swishing sounds were heard and several figures appeared around him.

"What exactly happened today? To think that we would encounter such annoying things in succession. " Chen Xiang turned his head to look, his gaze was focused on an old man, this old man gave off an extremely powerful feeling, he was from the World Defying Stage.

"I trained in the Primordial Profound Body." Chen Xiang was shocked, this group of people were much stronger than the World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect’s group.

"What are you guys doing?" Chen Xiang said with extreme impatience.

"Hand over the World Defying Green dragon!" The old man coldly said these words.

Chen Xiang carefully observed the people around him once again. One of them was an old man, two were middle-aged and three were young. Other than the old man who had managed to cultivate the Primordial Profound Body, the rest were all people who had just stepped into World Defying Stage.

And these people actually knew that he had World Defying Green dragon!

He was sure that these people were not from the World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect, otherwise they would have already attacked!

However, there were not many people who knew that he had a World Defying Green dragon, and there was only one force that had such a strong power, and that was the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain!

Chen Xiang thought of many things in an instant. The people who surrounded him were Myriad Tao Divine Mountain.

Before, the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain even faked inviting him to take a look at the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain, but in the blink of an eye, she surrounded and killed him, wanting to steal his World Defying Green dragon.
