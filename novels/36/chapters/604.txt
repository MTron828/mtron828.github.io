The Devil-suppressing blood was already in his hands. But Chen Xiang still could not go back immediately, because he could not return. It was just that his current strength was insufficient, so he was unable to use the Luotian Gate to open a dimensional door to the Mortal Martial Realm.

He could feel the symbols on the Mortal Martial Realm through the Luotian Gate, which was what made him most excited. After all, the Mortal Martial Realm was a low level world and the space was extremely weak, so passing through the higher level world was still very easy. However, the Luotian Gate still surprised Chen Xiang, even if it could travel across dimensions of the same level, it could still travel from the higher level world to the lower level world.

After walking out of the Immortal-poisoning Devil Forest, Chen Xiang hurried back to the Sacred Dan City. He had originally planned to use the Luotian Gate, but he realized that the space here was extremely sturdy, and that opening a spatial door was extremely difficult, it would consume a lot of energy and also require a lot of time. It would also cause a lot of noise, something that he had never encountered before.

Thus, he could only hurry back.

"Why are you in such a hurry? Did you want to tell the beautiful City Lord that you got her grandfather back so she can thank you and gain her good impression? " Su Meiyao teased with thick jealousy.

"Don’t spout nonsense, I just want to rush back to Sacred Dan Meeting to participate. I have to make the most of my time and refine the Ground level Pill, then increase my strength and return to Mortal Martial Realm." Chen Xiang said, he felt that with his current strength, in this world where there were many immortals, there was no sense of security at all. Once he returned to Mortal Martial Realm, even if he could not beat them, he could still escape.

There were more people walking on the streets than usual. After all, the Sacred Dan Meeting was a gathering of Alchemist with an extremely high talent, and in the Sacred Dan Realm, they were equivalent to elites. They controlled the entire world, and among the warriors, families, and sects, the Alchemist was provided.

Now, Chen Xiang understood why he had a follower of the Nirvana Stage. It was because this was a very common thing in the Sacred Dan Realm.

City Lord’s Mansion’s Main Courtyard.

The moment Chen Xiang entered, he saw a man in white. This handsome man in white had a head full of black hair that many women admired.

This man who looked like an honorable person was Xie Donghao, the head disciple of the Sacred Dan School in the first level of Sacred Dan Realm, and the grandson of the Sacred Dan School.

Chen Xiang saw that there were many white jade boxes in the courtyard, so he knew that Xie Donghao was here to propose marriage. Although Xie Donghao was able to enter the City Lord’s Mansion, he did not dare to barge into Du Yanyao’s house, and since Du Yanyao did not want to see him, he could only wait here.

Seeing Chen Xiang coming towards him, Xie Donghao’s eyes were filled with disgust. When he looked at Chen Xiang, his eyes would occasionally flash with a sinister light.

"What are you doing here?" Xie Donghao asked coldly. Looking at his expression, it was as if he wished to kill Chen Xiang no matter what.

"I live inside. What do you think I’m doing here?" Chen Xiang said as he strode towards Du Yanyao’s house. This made Xie Donghao grind his teeth in hatred, being able to live in the same house as Du Yanyao not only made him jealous, it even made the followers behind Xie Donghao feel the same way.

The door was tightly shut. Chen Xiang knocked on it and lightly shouted: "Yanyao, it’s me!"

Something that made Xie Donghao’s blood drip happened. Du Yanyao quickly opened the door.

"Yanyao, aren’t you in closed door cultivation?" Xie Donghao clenched his fists tightly and glared at Chen Xiang.

"I just came out of seclusion! What do you want? " "Yes," Du Yanyao coldly replied, then looked at Chen Xiang with a kind of caring and gentle light in his eyes, causing him to almost explode in jealousy.

Xie Donghao forcefully suppressed the anger in his heart. Although it was not Chen Xiang’s fault, he hated Chen Xiang to the bones.

"I’m here to propose to you, to ask for a wedding!" Xie Donghao calmed down and said.

After the five white jade boxes were opened, the fragrance of the medicine wafted in the air. With a single glance, one could tell that it was a very precious elixir.

"There are five Nature fruit s here, Yanyao, you should be very valuable, right?" Xie Donghao saw that Chen Xiang was staring at the five white jade boxes and was secretly pleased. He raised his head and looked at Chen Xiang proudly.

When Du Yanyao saw these five Nature fruit, she was also slightly shocked, but his face was still cold. She said coldly, "I know the pill, I don’t feel anything for you, I’ve said it many times, and marriage is not a deal, I won’t sell myself for these five Nature fruit, please go back!"

Chen Xiang suddenly laughed: "Young Master Xie, you must be here to give us a box, to actually use such a big box to store five small fruits!"

"Shut up, do you know how many Alchemist can fight over these five Nature fruit?" Xie Donghao suddenly bellowed, his forehead was full of veins, and once again, Du Yanyao rejected him, and in front of Chen Xiang, which made him extremely angry.

Chen Xiang now understood why it was that Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou wanted him to do his best to get hold of the Nature fruit back then.

"I have a basket full of these!" Chen Xiang curled his lips and said. Although he did not want to reveal his wealth, sometimes it was necessary to reveal it.

"You have to be realistic even if you want to boast. If you have a basket, I’ll cut off your head and use it as your urinal!" Xie Donghao sneered.

Chen Xiang scratched his head, and said: "I do not have a basket, but I do have half a basket!"

Just as Xie Donghao wanted to mock him, he saw Chen Xiang taking out a basket and releasing a light aura that was even stronger than the light emitted from the five white jade boxes.

The words that had just reached Xie Donghao’s throat were stifling inside. His eyes were wide open as he blankly stared at the Nature fruit s in the dilapidated basket. Indeed, there were only twenty to thirty of them, which was quite shocking.

"It’s too shabby to use this as a wedding request. In my place, it’s at least a high grade Heaven level’s Elixir of Life elixir or something like that." Chen Xiang curled his lips and said, putting away the basket.

Not only did this cause Xie Donghao and his followers to be extremely shocked, even Du Yanyao found it hard to believe as she very much wanted to know where Chen Xiang had come from. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Xie Donghao had softened as well. In Sacred Dan Realm, alchemy resources were something that were highly valued, because those who could buy some Alchemist s could establish a good relationship with some high ranking Alchemist s.

Although he saw that Chen Xiang had quite a few Nature fruit, Xie Donghao still mocked him a few times before leaving.

Seeing Xie Donghao leave dejectedly, Chen Xiang shook his head and sighed: "This guy only bullies the weak and fears the strong."
