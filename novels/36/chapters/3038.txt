Feng Ke’er’s sealing power could help Chen Xiang increase his speed to compress the Medicine crystal, if not, while he was compressing it, the Medicine crystal would have to continuously expand and explode. He would have to use even more strength to suppress it.

"Little girl, it would be best if you could help me refine pills. It’s way too easy." Chen Xiang laughed, but when he saw the cracks on the Tianchuang furnace, he could not smile anymore.

His Tianchuang furnace was severely injured, and if he was unable to repair it, he would not have a good pill furnace to replace it. It would be rather difficult for him to refine a Tianyuan holy body Dan now, so he would need a good pill furnace to help him.

"Feng Ke’er, do you think Xianxian and the others can refine powerful World Defying artifact now?" Chen Xiang asked.

"Not for the time being, unless they are all from the World Defying Stage." Feng Ke’er had also seen the cracks on top of Chen Xiang’s pill furnace. She was extremely sensitive to divine items, and could even see that the array formation inside the furnace had been damaged severely.

"Your pill furnace is severely damaged. Even if you want to repair it, it will take a very long time." Feng Ke’er said: "However, if you are able to obtain the Myriad Tao’s treasure, you will be able to quickly repair it. At that time, I will help you out again and you will be able to get a Myriad Tao’s divine artifact."

"En, since I have already refined this pill, I should be heading towards World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect soon. The people from Myriad Tao Divine Mountain are preparing to go to World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect, I am a little worried that they will work together and break this big stone." When Chen Xiang thought about this, he became worried. If he could not obtain the Myriad Tao’s treasure, then it would be difficult for his Tianchuang furnace to recover. Previously, he had planned to immediately turn his own Tianchuang furnace into a Myriad Tao’s divine tool after obtaining the treasure. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

"You don’t have to worry about that. I have confidence in the seal of that large stone. Even with the World Defying Stage’s Divine Realm, I won’t be able to break it in a short amount of time." Feng Ke’er saw through Chen Xiang’s worry, patted Chen Xiang’s shoulders and laughed: "I promised you, I will help you get the Myriad Tao’s treasure, and I will definitely do it, don’t worry."

Chen Xiang nodded: "Mn, I believe you."

She was sure that if she did not appear, Chen Xiang’s current strength would not have been able to keep up. That ball of energy was simply too terrifying, and she could not imagine that Chen Xiang had refined this ball of energy using medicinal ingredients.

Feng Ke’er had seen a lot of high-quality medicinal ingredients, even the proud and powerful medicine, but the energy contained in the medicine was only so-so. But right now, Chen Xiang was only refining a World Defying holy Dan, so the fact that he was able to refine such a high quality medicine made her exclaim in shock.

"Looks like it will be done soon. This pill’s quality is very high." Feng Ke’er didn’t know a thing about pill refining, but he knew how terrifying Alchemist was.

"Have you ever eaten a pill before?" Chen Xiang asked.

"No, I was still inside that seal. I rarely came out, so I’ve seen it before." Feng Ke’er watched as the large mass of Medicine crystal was gradually suppressed, while in his heart, he was also looking forward to the moment the condensing of the pellet was completed.

"There are many people above Myriad Tao," Chen Xiang was rather curious about the higher ups.

"Not much, only a little more than a thousand people. There are not many people that we interact with. However, the ones who fight and kill frequently in the higher-ups are just a bunch of bored and indestructible guys who are causing trouble." Feng Ke’er replied: "There are pill refiners up there too. I’ve only heard of them, I’ve never seen them before."

"Then do you recognize this guy?" Chen Xiang used his divine power to form a portrait of an old man, which was the Half-ghost Old Man inside the secret inheritance array.

"I don’t know him." Feng Ke’er looked around and shook his head: There aren’t many people up there, but I’ve seen even fewer.

"What about this," Chen Xiang then released the illusion of the Myriad Tao Dan God.

"I’ve seen this before. He’s an incredible apothecary." Feng Ke’er anxiously said.

After the Myriad Tao Dan God arrived at the top, he had indeed made a name for himself.

"He has a few formidable enemies up there, so he often hides himself. Although he has quite a few friends, he has never bothered his friends." Feng Ke’er said: "He’s a very good person."

"Why did he offend some powerful enemies?" Chen Xiang was very interested in this matter. There weren’t many people on Myriad Tao, but Myriad Tao Dan God had provoked quite a few, and they were all very powerful.

"The main thing is that someone wanted to find him to concoct pills. He wasn’t willing, and so he was chosen by those people. When there was a conflict, he ended up with a grudge." Feng Ke’er curled his lips: "There aren’t many Alchemist above, so he’s made many friends up there. Those guys coming to cause trouble for him can be considered to be a weirdo."

While Chen Xiang and Feng Ke’er were chatting, time flew by very quickly. However, with Feng Ke’er’s help to condense the pellet, Chen Xiang succeeded very quickly, and only used an hour to do so.

"Alright, this pill’s quality is very high." The first thing Feng Ke’er did was to take out that pellet. Although it was a small pellet, the energy it contained made Feng Ke’er exclaim repeatedly in her heart. She did not expect Chen Xiang, who had just stepped into the World Defying Stage, to refine such a high quality pellet.

"Of course, I was concocted using a combination of two extremely powerful pill techniques." "I am just too weak now. If my cultivation was a bit higher, the quality of the pill I refined would have been even higher." Chen Xiang said: "I’ll take a look at it now and see how much it will help me."

It was Chen Xiang’s first time consuming this kind of pellet, and in his opinion, the pellet was most likely consumed when he was still at the peak of the Primordial Profound Realm. But right now, he was only at the early stage, so he didn’t know if it would be of any help to him either.

After eating it, Chen Xiang immediately used the power of the Time Laws, because he would need a lot of time to refine it.

Originally, he thought that the World Defying holy Dan would need a long time to refine it, but he did not expect that the refining speed would be so fast. This caused his heart to involuntarily feel cold.

"Don’t tell me it’s useless against me," Chen Xiang was very worried.

He estimated that it would take at least a month to refine, but he was still within the power of the Time Laws. He could refine it in just three days’ time.

After completely refining the pellet, his previous worry was unnecessary because he already felt the benefits from the strong medicinal power. Originally, it was only the initial stage of the Profound Body, but now, with just one pellet, it actually reached the peak of the Profound Body.

If he did not experience this change personally, he would not have believed it to be real even if he had beaten himself to death.

"Half-ghost Old Man is truly amazing, to think that the medicinal formula given would actually be so useful, it seems like this pill is extremely useful for proud profound bodies, I had thought that it could only be eaten after the arrogant world’s profound body has reached the pinnacle."

From here, the first thing he did was to look at the genuine content!
