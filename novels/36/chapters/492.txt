Chapter 493 A Sore Secret

Sensing that the White Tiger Profound Realm was trembling, everyone inside immediately raised head to look in the direction of the spatial energy. They saw that a huge black whirlpool suddenly appeared in the sky, right in the middle of the Profound Realm.

“If anyone dare to interrupt me cultivation, I will make sure he stays here forever. There won’t be any exception!” The White Tiger let out a furious roar and at the same time, it released a threatening pressure from its body with a thick killing intent that enveloped the entire White Tiger Profound Realm.

Those Nirvana Realm practitioners were promptly astonished. They knew that there was a very strong fellow concealed within the Profound Realm. Because they were at the Profound Realm, no matter how strong the people inside were, they would not be sucked into the Heavenly Realm. Therefore, they immediately thought that strength of the person who had spoken earlier had already far exceeded the peak of the Mortal Realm. Such a fellow was not someone they could challenge.

Very quickly, Chen Xiang and Liu Menger saw a large group of people suddenly leaping into the sky and flying towards the spatial whirlpool.

“Can I come back in the future?” Chen Xiang asked. After all, Bai Zhenzhen was still here. They had been staying together for a period of time and had developed feelings for each other.

“Come in if you can! I won’t drive you away.” White Tiger said with a smile.

Liu Menger released the Jade Lotus Frisbee and Chen Xiang jumped onto it. The two of them bid farewell to the White Tiger and flew up.

After reaching the top, Chen Xiang suddenly saw Gu Dongchen flying towards him. The current Gu Dongchen was no longer that handsome and elegant headmaster. Instead, he was like a beggar on the street. His body was dirty and his hair disheveled. His face was covered in black mud, while his tattered clothes emitted a foul stench!

"Junior master, you ...how come you are with her! " Gu Dongchen immediately shouted when he saw Liu Menger’s Jade Lotus Frisbee.

“Little kid, how did you become like this?” Chen Xiang covered his nose and asked with a frown.

“It is all because I was looking for you, you bastard? I’ve searched for you for days and nights without stopping, but you are actually with this woman ...” Gu Dongchen was so angry that his heart was about to explode. He knew about the secrete relation between Chen Xiang and Liu Menger. Thinking about how Chen Xiang was together with such a beauty during the past few days, he almost vomited blood.

Gu Dongchen was worried that Chen Xiang would die in the devil storm. If so, how could he face Huang Jintian? That was why he had desperately searched for him!

“Sister Menger, let’s go! Just ignore him. He stinks!” Chen Xiang laughed heartily, causing Gu Dongchen to roar in anger.

Liu Menger activated the Jade Lotus Frisbee and flew into the huge black door in the sky. Then, she appeared on the surface of the sea.

"Brother Gu, your junior master really have a good luck with women! Now, he must have a relation with Liu Menger. You were striving to find him for those days, but he was with Liu Menger, haha” Even though Lian Yingxiao said so, he was very jealous of Chen Xiang. He was also a romantic person and had many women, but there were no women at Liu Menger’s level. He felt that a strong woman like Liu Menger was much stronger than his hundreds.

Gu Dongchen snorted coldly, "He’s my junior master after all, the disciple of that old lunatic. He definitely has some tricks.”

Lian Yingxiao shook his head and smiled. With a wave of his hand, he released a ball of water that washed Gu Dongchen clean, then they flew away from the White Tiger Profound Realm.

The martial artists who entered the realm were all futile, especially the ones who found mineral veins there. Under the might of the White Tiger, they had no choice but to leave. After all, it was not their territory. Although they found a crystal mine, it was still not theirs.

Of course, Chen Xiang and Liu Menger were the ones who benefited the most.

“Little rascal, don’t come looking for me in this period of time, you know.” Liu Menger said in a low voice as she squeezed his arm.

Chen Xiang took out the Treasure Refining Manual and smiled, “this is what I promised you. Take it!”

Liu Menger hurriedly received it and immediately flipped open a few pages. When she saw the contents inside, her beautiful eyes flashed with all sorts of ecstasy. She didn’t even know that Chen Xiang’s hands had landed on her chest.

Feeling her chest being attacked, Liu Menger finally reacted. She quickly patted Chen Xiang’s head, “Little rascal, what if others see us? Take your hands back!”

Liu Menger put away the Treasure Refining Manual. It wouldn’t be too late for her to take a look at it in the future.

She was also extremely curious about Chen Xiang’s situation. Especially when Su Meiyao secretly sent her a voice transmission, she even taught her a powerful cultivation method that benefited her greatly.

Knowing that Chen Xiang had a mysterious and powerful woman with him, Liu Menger secretly felt jealous. She didn’t ask Chen Xiang about Su Meiyao. She guessed that it was Chen Xiang’s greatest secret.

Looking at the naughty smile on Chen Xiang’s handsome face, Liu Menger knew that Chen Xiang would definitely have quite a few women by his side. As for this, she could only accept it.

“Tell me when you’re going to transcend the tribulation. I’ll do my best to help you!” Chen Xiang laughed as he stroked Liu Menger’s jade-like hand.

Feeling that someone was approaching, Liu Menger quickly let go of Chen Xiang’s hand. She saw Gu Dongchen riding on a Frisbee and coming here. Even Lian Yingxiao was on it.

“Follow him back to the Extreme Martial Sect!” Liu Menger said reluctantly. Although Chen Xiang was always mean to her, she really wanted to be with him.

Chen Xiang jumped onto Gu Dongchen’s Frisbee and waved goodbye to Liu Menger.

After she flew away, Chen Xiang let out a sigh and sat down.

“Junior master, how close are you with her right now” Gu Dongchen asked in a smile.

Lian Yingxiao was also curious. When men and men were together, there was no avoiding this topic. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Get away, what does this have to do with you?” Chen Xiang was also cautious about it. He knew that Lian Yingxiao and Gu Dongchen wouldn’t reveal it. If they did, it would only increase a little pressure on Liu Menger, while he, Chen Xiang, would only be envied by others.

“Chen Xiang, my daughters have always wanted to meet you...I am wondering...”

“Forget it, I don’t want to call you father-in-law.” Chen Xiang spread out his hands and smiled.

“Sigh, no wonder. With a woman like Liu Menger, there aren’t many people that you would like to eye on.” Lian Yingxiao sighed. He pursued Liu Menger for many years, only made her mad in the end, after which Liu Menger kept not speaking to him.

Chen Xiang asked, “Senior Lian, is Lian Mingdong your son?”

Lian Mingdong’s identity has always piqued Chen Xiang’s curiosity. He always felt that Lian Mingdong was not simple; moreover, he was very similar to Lian Yingxiao.

"Yes, he is my son, but he hates me. Sigh, it’s all my fault for not taking good care of his mother, resulting in her murder. Thus, he left the Lotus Island at a very young age. "

“What, Lian Mingdong is your son? This brat came to the Extreme Martial Sect very early on. He is much better in every aspect than your other arrogant sons. Now that I think about it, he does look like you. However, he is not as romantic as you. It seems like he doesn’t even have a woman.”

Gu Dongchen was thoroughly surprised. Lian Mingdong was also from the top-end martial academy. As the dean of the top-end martial academy, Gu Dongchen knew the disciples inside very well and had trained them well.
