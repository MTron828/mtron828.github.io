Seeing the familiar faces of Long Xueyi and Yue’er, Chen Xiang felt a lot more at ease. They were still here, but the valley was covered with an extremely powerful array, making it impossible for him to discover them.

"If it wasn’t for that, the Natural Law Divine Lord might have attacked them." Chen Xiang was also unable to enter the Natural Law World now, and he did not know what was the reason for this.

Long Xueyi and Yue’er had just come out and disappeared. Chen Xiang could feel that Yue’er was using the power of space!

"Where did they go?" Chen Xiang was unable to track where they teleported to. "

Chen Xiang tried to communicate with the people inside the Hundreds of Flowers Village, but they were unable to find anyone around.

"Why are they so wary? Is there some powerful being that is a threat to them? " Just at this moment, he saw a beautiful red figure. It was a woman in red, and she was Xia Bailing, whom Chen Xiang was extremely familiar with!

"Sister Bai Ling!" Chen Xiang immediately focused and sent a sound transmission to Xia Bailing.

Xia Bailing had appeared out of the blue, and should have used teleportation to teleport outside the Hundreds of Flowers Village, but just as she was about to enter the Hundreds of Flowers Village, she suddenly heard a familiar voice!

"Little Scoundrel!" Xia Bailing shouted in shock, and then turned his head to look around, but he did not see Chen Xiang.

"It’s me!" I can’t go back now, but I can see the Natural Law World. What kind of situation have you guys met with? Chen Xiang asked.

Hundreds of Flowers Village and Heavenly Dragon City should be the strongest forces within the Natural Law World, but they had to be this cautious!

"It’s a long story!" Xia Bailing was very happy to be able to communicate with them, because Chen Xiang had already left them for a period of time. They all missed Chen Xiang very much and wanted to know more about Chen Xiang’s situation.

"How are you doing in Divine Wasteland?" Xia Bailing asked.

"Not bad, he’s still alive." Chen Xiang laughed, "Your current strength is not weak either!"

Xia Bailing was now a member of the Venerable Ancestor Later-stage, and could not be considered a part of the Divine Wasteland s. To be able to reach such a cultivation level, it could be seen that the group of female Alchemist s inside the Hundreds of Flowers Village had played a great role.

Chen Xiang was surprised. In the Natural Law World, resources were scarce, far inferior to the Divine Wasteland, but they could refine pills to continuously raise their cultivation. This was not easy.

"It’s good that you’re fine, we’re worried about you! "You are a troublemaker. You must have provoked a lot of Mafa when you went there." Xia Bailing laughed, "There’s no you here. It’s been peaceful for many years ... It’s just that some guy from the World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect suddenly appeared, he’s very strong. "

The fact that someone from the World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect was here shocked Chen Xiang!

"The people from the World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect are really hateful, it’s a good thing that there is a Myriad Tao Divine Mountain here that can fight them, otherwise we wouldn’t be able to live in peace." Xia Bailing sighed: "It’s good that you’re back, we are being bullied by the World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect here, we have to be careful when we leave."

"My Divine Wasteland also has a World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect! "Don’t worry, I’ll get even with them." Chen Xiang thought of the World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect and his heart grew cold. Then, he asked, "Sister Bai Ling, tell me about the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain!"

Xia Bailing briefly told Chen Xiang about the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain.

The Myriad Tao Divine Mountain had appeared in the Natural Law World very early on to promote the cultivation methods of the Myriad Tao, while Lv Qilian and the others had also sent some outstanding women there to learn. Other than that, the Heavenly Dragon City and the other forces had all sent many people to the Natural Law World to cultivate.

It was also at that time that Feng Yujie and the other pill refiners grasped many pill formulas and medicinal ingredients. It was also at that time that everyone learned the secrets of the many realms behind and after many years, a portion of them managed to cultivate to the Venerable ancestor realm.

"Go and tell Big Sister Qilian that you contacted me! "Help me call out to the other girls, saying that I miss them too. When I return, let them bully me." Chen Xiang laughed.

"You are the one who wants to bully them, right? "Little Scoundrel!" Xia Bailing laughed, then warned him in a serious tone: "You have to be careful yourself, World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect and these guys are all bastards!"

"I will pay attention. I will think of a way to go back, or perhaps I will think of a way to help you become stronger!" Although Chen Xiang was unable to return, he was able to communicate with the people of the Natural Law World.

"Hm!" "You should pay more attention to this place. People will come out from time to time." Xia Bailing said.

"Oh yeah, I saw Xueyi and Yue’er earlier, but they disappeared the moment they ran." Chen Xiang asked: "Where did they go?"

"They should be going to the Heavenly Dragon City to deliver the pills and then take some medicinal ingredients from there. Most of us who know how to use the power of space will be out by now, so it will be more complete." Xia Bailing said.

"Alright, you go back first. It’s not safe to stay outside for too long." Chen Xiang said.

Xia Bailing said goodbye to Chen Xiang somewhat unwillingly, then hurriedly returned to the Hundreds of Flowers Village to spread the news of her meeting with Chen Xiang.

When Chen Xiang withdrew his consciousness from Natural Law World’s body, he saw that the Wangwo poison on his body was already in a violent rage. At this moment, he was rolling on the ground in pain and screaming miserably.

"Chen Xiang, how is your Natural Law World doing?" Sun Lingxing asked.

"My friends and family are all good!" Chen Xiang said: "It’s really strange that a World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect and a Myriad Tao Divine Mountain suddenly appeared there!"

Chen Xiang had asked Xia Bailing before, but he didn’t know why he would suddenly have a Myriad Tao Divine Mountain. And World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect had only just appeared in these few years.

After Sun Lingxing heard this, his expression changed, and he said solemnly: "This is not a good thing! Myriad Tao Divine Mountain is ... But they are the ones in charge of executing some people. Back then, we were sent to the World Defying Stage Divine Mausoleum by the people from Myriad Tao Divine Mountain. "

"However, there aren’t many World Defying Stage in the Natural Law World. Instead, there are some World Defying Stage s among the World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect s that have appeared in the rear." Chen Xiang said: "And Myriad Tao Divine Mountain is also developing the cultivation method."

"Then this is strange. Myriad Tao Divine Mountain suddenly descending into a small world, there must be some secret within." Sun Lingxing said.

"Haha ..." Natural Law Divine Lord suddenly laughed wildly: "That’s because Myriad Tao Divine Mountain is there to pick slaves and is preparing to build a new tomb there. When the time comes, you bunch of conceited people will be buried!"

"Hmph, speaking so much even before death!" Chen Xiang took out a Wangwo scent. When Natural Law Divine Lord saw it, he really wanted to immediately grab it, but when he reached Chen Xiang’s feet, he was immediately kicked away.

"Spirit Star, I’ll leave it to you to finish him off." Chen Xiang said.

Sun Lingxing waved his hand and summoned a meteor to exterminate the Natural Law Divine Lord who was trapped in endless pain!
