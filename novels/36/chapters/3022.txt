Since Yue’er could use the power of the Space Laws, that was why she was sent out. It would be safer for her.

"Chen Xiang!" Yue’er cried out in surprise, "You can get something here now? Was that you making a commotion just now? "

"Yes, I threw a stone in." Chen Xiang chuckled, "Next time I’ll throw seven stones in a row. After you guys sense it from inside, you will know that I want to contact you all!"

"Alright, I understand. When we go back later, I’ll tell them." Yue’er hurriedly nodded her head.

"Oh right, how is Senior Jiu Xiao’s progress?" Chen Xiang asked.

"He is still in closed-door training, but there is a high chance that he will be able to step into the World Defying Stage." Yue’er replied, "Myriad Tao Divine Mountain’s conditions are extremely harsh! No one in Heavenly Dragon City or the Hundreds of Flowers Village is willing to, but a few other new forces have agreed to submit to the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain. It looks like it won’t be long before the Natural Law World has a large number of experts from the World Defying Stage. "

The Myriad Tao Divine Mountain controlled the power of the Divine Wasteland and the various major worlds. They definitely had some way to help people quickly step into the World Defying Stage!

"What kind of power are they?" Chen Xiang asked.

"You’ve never heard of it. Back then, many of the powers of the same era as ours had already been annihilated. Heavenly Dragon City and I have never caused any trouble, so we were perfectly fine and no one dared to hit us." Yue’er flew onto the tree trunk, sat on it, and continued: "However, after Myriad Tao Divine Mountain arrived, there were fewer disputes among them. Don’t let Myriad Tao Divine Mountain control them too well."

"Right now, we are just worried that after those powerful forces come, they might come find us and attack us!" Although there are no grievances or hatred, the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain may use these methods to force us! Furthermore, those powers have always been hostile towards us. The main reason is because they feel that we are too strong and want to trample over us. " Yue’er humphed tenderly as she spoke.

"Oh right, how is your Myriad Tao Divine Mountain doing?"

"I met an elder from the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain just now. He was very strong, he cultivated the World Defying Holy Body, and his body was at the large success stage of the Saint Body." Chen Xiang said: "This guy seems to know me very well and even wanted to invite me to join the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain. However, a few of my friends decided to sneak in and test the waters, so they joined. "

"It seems like you’re doing pretty well up there. You know so many powerful friends!" Yue’er laughed. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

"Don’t forget that I’m a very powerful Alchemist. I’m currently helping you guys refine Heaven and Earth infinite Dan that can easily step into the World Defying Stage. You guys eat it, and you’ll be able to step into the World Defying Stage very soon." Chen Xiang laughed: "Quickly go and get Sister Feng and the others to help me concoct pills. I have something to instruct them about."

"Alright!" Yue’er immediately flew back, and brought Feng Yujie and Hua Xiangyue out not long after.

Looking at the mature and charming Feng Yujie and the seductive Hua Xiangyue, Chen Xiang couldn’t help but to start laughing mischievously. It had been a long time since he had been intimate with these beauties.

"Bad guy, if you have something important to say, then say it quickly." Feng Yujie scoffed.

"Little Scoundrel, when are you coming back? Big sister misses you so much!" Hua Xiangyue said coquettishly.

"This is the medicine used to refine Heaven and Earth infinite Dan!" Chen Xiang coughed dryly a few times, and then gave them some medicinal ingredients.

If it wasn’t for the limited time, Chen Xiang would definitely have wanted to chat with them more. Right now, he could only quickly teach them the method to refine this pill.

When Chen Xiang first refined the Heaven and Earth infinite Dan, he was also only at the Venerable ancestor realm, so he felt that these girls who were very familiar with the Heavenly Alchemy would definitely be able to do so.

"It’s going to be tough on you guys next!" Of course, the Heaven and Earth infinite Dan that I refine will first be eaten by your thugs, so it has the function of protection. " Chen Xiang said: "And if you all feel that refining pills requires the power of World Defying Stage, you can take it first. As for such an even distribution, you all can decide for yourselves!"

"Got it!" Feng Yujie and the others knew the purpose of the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain, and this was a huge threat to them.

"Alright, I’ll continue to concoct pills. After I’m done concocting, I’ll have Yue Er come out to retrieve it." Chen Xiang said before withdrawing his spiritual will from the Natural Law World.

Chen Xiang had continuously refined Heaven and Earth infinite Dan for two years, and there were only two hundred of them in total, which was enough for twenty people to enter World Defying Stage.

Even though he had used the power of time, it had still taken Chen Xiang a month!

The Myriad Tao Divine Mountain did not know when he was going to make his move, so time was of the essence. Chen Xiang found nine stones and threw them into the Natural Law World, smashing them onto the barrier enchantment.

Not long after, Yue’er came out. Chen Xiang asked about Myriad Tao Divine Mountain’s situation, and after knowing that Myriad Tao Divine Mountain had yet to take any action, he felt a lot more at ease.

Okay, I will give my Heaven and Earth infinite Dan to you now. There are two hundred Heaven and Earth infinite Dan in total, and one person eating ten of them will be able to step into the World Defying Stage. Chen Xiang said.

"Well, they’ve already discussed it! Furthermore, there is good news. Shuang Ru just returned, she said that her father has already stepped into the World Defying Stage. " Yue Er said: "Wait a moment, let her take some pills to the Heavenly Dragon City."

"Alright!" Chen Xiang nodded. "I will go and chat with Senior Jiu Xiao later."

After that, he brought the box containing the Heaven and Earth infinite Dan to Yue’er, and upon seeing this, he almost fainted. He had consumed too much energy, and in an instant, he was drained of all his energy!

"Could it be because the Heaven and Earth infinite Dan contains too much energy?" Chen Xiang didn’t expect it to turn out like this. He watched Yue’er take the pellet back with him, and only then was he at ease.

"I’m going to the Myriad Tao Mausoleum right now. The mysterious inheritance inside might be of great help to me." Chen Xiang still had one more person to find in the Myriad Tao Mausoleum, which was the Well-informed Ghost. He wanted to ask Well-informed Ghost a few things, to see if the Well-informed Ghost knew how to make him return to the Natural Law World.

Before he left, he still needed to rest for a while.

"Did the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain change the rules?" Chen Xiang had this suspicion. Back then, Natural Law Divine Lord’s cultivation was not high either, but he was able to get a clone from the Divine Wasteland.

"Abominable Myriad Tao Divine Mountain!" Chen Xiang cursed a few times in his heart.

After recovering, he teleported into the Myriad Tao Mausoleum. The Myriad Tao Mausoleum’s barrier was getting weaker and weaker, after all it was destroyed inside. It was caused by the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain and the World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect.

"Well-informed Ghost!" Chen Xiang took out the Communication jade Symbol paper and sent a message to the Well-informed Ghost. He did not know if the Well-informed Ghost was still there.

"Chen Xiang, you’re finally back! The Ghost Emperor died, did you do this!?" The Communication jade Symbol paper soon started to shake, and the voice of the Well-informed Ghost traveled over.

"Hehe, that guy died a terrible death." Chen Xiang laughed: "We have come together, I have something to ask you ... Right, I am asking you a question now, are you still taking my Dao crystal? "
