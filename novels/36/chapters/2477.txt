Xia Bailing also knew that Chen Xiang’s cultivation was low, she nodded, showing that she understood.

After she threw the ingredients into the pill furnace, she took out two small red beads and placed them under the furnace.

"Is that a fire pearl? You don’t know how to use flames." When Chen Xiang had used the Dao heart Eye to look at them, he could see that the two pearls contained an extremely strong power of fire.

I’m not proficient in fire, I mainly train in spatial energy, but this does not affect me from becoming a Alchemist. I have been relying on this pearl for my alchemy for all these years. Xia Bailing said as she laughed daintily and tossed a fire pearl over to Chen Xiang, "I used space to compress this pearl and look for some good flames to compress and seal within it."

"So you’re saying you train in the Space Laws and that you’re really focused? I’m really ashamed of myself." Chen Xiang praised. He was cultivating both space and flames at the same time.

"Oh, don’t tell me you are training in multiple types of law energies at the same time." Xia Bailing asked curiously, as she had already started to use the Crash method to refine the pill.

When Chen Xiang had guided those old Alchemist in refining, she had pointed out various places that needed attention, and they had all been memorized by Xia Bailing. Thus, the moment she had started refining, she had avoided the areas that could easily go wrong.

Chen Xiang did not immediately reply, at the same time he also indicated for Xia Bailing to focus on concocting pills.

"I succeeded." Xia Bailing laughed happily, she had already completed the charge step, as long as she could smoothly pass through this obstacle, the rest would be very easy, she had succeeded by more than half.

"You’re so amazing that you don’t even need my guidance." Chen Xiang curled his lips: "You can obviously refine it very smoothly."

"But I’m worried that I might make a mistake. I’ll be embarrassed later." Xia Bailing stuck his tongue out at Chen Xiang: "If I made a mistake and only you saw it yourself, I’m not worried that you would say anything."

"What, you want to kill me and silence me?" Chen Xiang laughed. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

"Of course not, I have a way to keep you quiet." Xia Bailing pouted: "Seems like you aren’t afraid of me."

"Of course I’m afraid. You’re a Dao Sovereign, so I’m afraid you’ll die of fear." Chen Xiang said.

"Hmph." Xia Bailing scoffed several times, and asked, "Not only do you cultivate flame, even so, you are still a very powerful Alchemist, and this is pretty good too."

"I train in spatial energy too, it’s just a piece of cake. I don’t think you’re that amazing." Chen Xiang said.

Chen Xiang had a very good grasp of spatial energy, and this was one of the hardest laws to learn from, otherwise he wouldn’t have been able to cultivate such a powerful mark like the White Tiger’s jump.

When he encountered a spirit formation or something like that sealing space, he could easily jump through space using the White Tiger. This was a very high level.

"Nonsense, since you can cultivate the power of the Space Laws, then you definitely won’t be too weak. This Space Law isn’t something that anyone can train in, and if you have the chance to do so, then you certainly aren’t weak." Xia Bailing didn’t believe a word of Chen Xiang’s words, it could be seen how much understanding she had of the laws of space she cultivated.

"Sister Bai Ling, you must be very good at spatial cultivation. Please teach me." Chen Xiang laughed.

"There’s nothing to teach. Everyone trains in different types of Space Laws. What I can’t teach you is because different types of Space Laws are comprehended by everyone." Xia Bailing said, "You should be clear about this yourself."

"Did you really not get taught anything?" Chen Xiang was a little disappointed: "I think I’m still lacking in this area."

"Alright, your specialty is pill refining." Xia Bailing laughed: "Although I know how to refine pills, I might not be as powerful as you. Furthermore, the spatial energy I cultivate is mainly used for battles, it definitely isn’t suitable for you.

Chen Xiang would never admit in front of Xia Bailing that he used his spatial energy to escape.

"Of course not, I’m just cultivating by mistake. I’m also here to fight." Chen Xiang curled his lips. His spatial energy was indeed frequently used to flee for his life.

Xia Bailing laughed and said, "You won’t admit it no matter what, right? I can tell that a guy like you shouldn’t have long to live, but you lived for a very long time.

Chen Xiang did not speak anymore. He was more or less able to guess what was going on.

"Sister Bai Ling, I only came here to hide after provoking some powerful people outside. I’m a bit worried that they would barge in right now. Those guys are really scary." Chen Xiang said, he felt that these Dao Sovereigns must know many things, thus he also wanted to take this opportunity to ask Xia Bailing a few things.

"Oh, are they the people from the three great native bank s? Of course, if the three great native bank s came to kill you, you would have already died. Who are they, is they really that powerful?" Xia Bailing asked.

"Undead Divine Race... And there’s also the Red Spirit Race. " Chen Xiang said.

"So it’s Undead Divine Race. He’s indeed a rather difficult guy to deal with, and Red Spirit Race is quite powerful as well." Xia Bailing frowned slightly, "Don’t worry, as long as you stay in my city, they won’t dare to find trouble with you."

"Sister Bai Ling, you might not know this, but after the Undead Divine Race and the Red Spirit Race combined, they were able to mutate." Chen Xiang said: "Although the Undead Divine Race won’t die, because he won’t die, his power has limited the boundaries."

"But now that the Undead Divine Race and the Red Spirit Race have joined forces, I wonder what kind of secret technique was used. The Undead Divine Race was able to break through that bottleneck, and because of that, the Red Spirit Race has become longevity. They have become even stronger."

Xia Bailing’s jade face, which originally had a smile on it, became serious at this moment because this kind of thing was not something that Chen Xiang could know. At this moment, she was extremely curious about Chen Xiang’s identity.

"Are you speaking the truth? What exactly are your origins? To actually know about this kind of thing, I only know a little about this sort of thing a while ago." Xia Bailing asked.

After that, Chen Xiang told Xia Bailing about the two generations merging. As a Dao Sovereign, Xia Bailing could easily accept and understand this kind of thing.

"You don’t have to worry about that. There will be three great native bank s restricting them, and inside the Spirit Wasteland, there are beasts restricting us humans." Xia Bailing sighed: "In short, we passed many years like this."

Xia Bailing very quickly finished refining a batch of Shengdao Dan. She only used four hours and even refined three of the high quality Shengdao Dan.

"Alright, I can now refine a Shengdao Dan. What reward do you want? Have you decided?" Xia Bailing laughed.

"Do you have anything good? Take it all out for me to choose from." Chen Xiang thought about it and said.
