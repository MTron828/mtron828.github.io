After playing around with Hua Xiangyue for a while, he finally sat down with a serious face and asked: "Xiangyue, why do you need to pretend to be two people?"

"Isn’t your Elder Sister Meng’er the same? She was originally the female emperor of the Divine Weapons Heavenly Country and then the Valley Master of the Icy Wind Valley. Hua Xiangyue laughed.

Chen Xiang suddenly felt that this might be related, and continued: "My master ... That’s why the relationship between Dan Fragrance Pure Land and his wife had always been very close. Once, by chance, Mistress found out that I had a Purple Moon Fire Soul, so she secretly taught me the art of refining pills, and then allowed me to enter the Super Martial School. After Mistress and Master had flown up, the Dan Fragrance Pure Land was under my control and I was also an elder of the Super Martial School at the same time. "

"Then, when did Elder Sister Meng’er find out about your identity?" When Chen Xiang thought about how Liu Meng’er had been hiding this from him for so long, he felt a little uncomfortable in his heart.

"Guess?"

"Guess your head!" Chen Xiang stretched out his wolf claws and grabbed towards Hua Xiangyue’s chest.

"I’ve known her since we were very young. My master’s wife seems to have some connections with her parents. At that time, she and I were already designated as the successors of Divine Weapons Heavenly Country and the Dan Fragrance Pure Land. At the same time, we were also the secret leaders of other powers. " Hua Xiangyue let out a faint sigh, and then pouted charmingly: "Who would have thought that I would meet a little scoundrel like you ..."

Chen Xiang curled his lips and said: "You seem to be the one who pestered me for this. When you were Hua Xiangyue, you willingly became my female slave.

"I really don’t understand why you want to pester me!"

If others were to know that he thought this way, they would definitely kick him to death. Such a beauty, he actually disliked her.

Hua Xiangyue came closer and wrapped herself around Chen Xiang’s body like a beautiful snake, asking in a charming voice, "You want to know?"

"Of course!" Chen Xiang hugged the beauty tightly, his breathing became very rapid, and he released a burning breath, causing Su Meiyao’s cheeks to flush red, and his eyes to be filled with an enchanting autumn wave.

"My master is the same as you, both of us cultivators of the Taiji Dragon-suppressed kungfu. When I was in the mortal world, I already knew that you possessed a Yin Yang vein. "My mistress told me that when I meet such a man, I must not be let off."

Su Meiyao smiled charmingly, "My mistress had already taught me a way to look at the spirit veins of others. When I was in the mortal world, I wasn’t certain, so I decided to bring you back to confirm.

Chen Xiang suddenly bit her lips that were filled with enchantment, stuck out her tongue, pried open Hua Xiangyue’s pearly white teeth, and sucked in her charming and sweet tongue. Hua Xiangyue was moved at this moment, her hands hugging Chen Xiang tightly, while kissing him, she started to chant.

Very quickly, Hua Xiangyue took off the clothes on the upper half of Hua Xiangyue’s body. As Chen Xiang kissed the beauty’s sandalwood mouth, he also caressed the beauty’s soft and smooth body, playing with her bright spring sunshine, well-developed and straight chest, making Hua Xiangyue let out a groan.

"Scoundrel master, do you want to eat me?" Hua Xiangyue’s charming eyes reddened as she looked at Chen Xiang.

"Of course I want to, but..."

"If you marry a strong woman, it will be harmful to you. Are you worried about this?" Hua Xiangyue straightened his chest, causing the dazzling jade rabbit to tremble, and stirred up a wave of waves, while an evil feeling surfaced in Chen Xiang’s heart.

Hua Xiangyue chuckled: "Even if a peony flower died, would it still be so amicable to be a ghost? "A perverted heart doesn’t have a perverted heart ..."

Hua Xiangyue was constantly tempting her, because she knew that Chen Xiang did not dare, and seeing Chen Xiang’s uncomfortable look, she was happy. She was Chen Xiang’s female slave now, and had lost to Chen Xiang in the pill refining competition, she had mentioned that Chen Xiang could do anything to her.

Hua Xiangyue laughed coquettishly as she took off her clothes. Her every move was filled with endless charm and enticement, especially when she saw her dress fall down from her fat bottom and bottom, the blood in Chen Xiang’s body was practically burning, and her lower abdomen was like a volcanic eruption.

"Master, this servant actually really wants to give it to you, but ..." This servant is stronger than you. It will be very harmful to the master. " Hua Xiangyue intentionally revealed her charming and regretful expression, lightly biting her lips, she said worriedly.

Chen Xiang’s eyes that were spurting hot light, swept across Hua Xiangyue’s lovely body from head to toe, and then stopped at the grass covered ground, which was a bit pink and bashful, causing Chen Xiang’s evil blood to boil, but he still suppressed it.

"In the Demon World, there are some evil women who specifically cultivate bewitching arts to tempt men with extremely weak mental strength. By combining their techniques, they can devour the male’s power and Yang energy ..." Bai Youyou said: "This little demoness isn’t tempting you, nor is she playing with you, she is training your mental strength. She is worried that after Great War between Three Realms, you will not be able to resist the enticement of those evil women.

"Actually, Junior Sister and I already had plans to train you in this area since long ago, it’s just that you haven’t had the time. However, it’s good now, for a little demon like Hua Xiangyue to train you, it’s for the best."

Hearing Bai Youyou’s words, Chen Xiang felt like he was going to explode. If Bai Youyou the ice-cold goddess was also like Hua Xiangyue and had a charming posture, then what would happen?

Just then, Long Xueyi said in all seriousness: "Little Scoundrel, eat her. My Imperial Dragon Race has a powerful body, it can prevent you from getting hurt."

Hearing Long Xueyi’s words, Chen Xiang was overjoyed. He knew that the Little Bad Dragon had a way to solve this kind of problem. After all, the Imperial Dragon Race was an extremely loose race, it would be weird if they didn’t have this sort of method.

"Actually, as long as you use some of the things inside the Taiji Dragon-suppressed kungfu well, you can avoid being harmed. I’ll teach you how to use them ..." Long Xueyi had ruined Hua Xiangyue’s plans, and made Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou secretly look down on her.

The cultivation method that Long Xueyi had taught him suddenly popped up in Chen Xiang’s mind. He was so excited that he almost flew to the sky. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

What Hua Xiangyue was currently doing was indeed training Chen Xiang’s mental fortitude. The things that needed to be noted the most about the demon realm were the Evil Woman’s top actions. She was worried about Chen Xiang, the little scoundrel, so she had no choice but to come up with this plan.

Originally, Hua Xiangyue’s performance made Hua Xiangyue extremely satisfied, but she was surprised to see that Chen Xiang’s body temperature had suddenly increased.

"Little Scoundrel ..." "Ah ..."

Chen Xiang suddenly flew over, pressing Hua Xiangyue to the ground, and then quickly took off all of the clothes on her body. Before Hua Xiangyue could react, a burst of pain came from her lower body, accompanied by a trace of numbness, causing her to let out a cry of farewell to her virgin, the pain also caused her to shed tears.

Although Chen Xiang’s entire body was burning with demonic flames, he was currently very gentle and tender towards beautiful women. Not long later, the most beautiful Spring Painting was left inside the bamboo house ...
