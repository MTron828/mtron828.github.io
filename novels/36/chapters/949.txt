Chen Xiang realized that it would not be easy for him to infiltrate the Super Martial School. The protection of the Super Martial School was extremely tight, he had no choice but to change into the appearance of a Super Martial School disciple and use his previous jade tablet to enter.

Now that he had been expelled by the Super Martial School, if he were to appear here, the ancient powers would definitely make things difficult for him. Right now, the Super Martial School was developing very quickly, and had already become a thorn in the eye of the ancient powers.

Chen Xiang made some inquiries in the Super Martial School, and after finding out that Yun Xiaodao and the others were not here, he was brought away by Gu Dongchen!

Ten days ago, Gu Dongchen brought fifty disciples with him. It was unknown where he went, Yun Xiaodao, Zhu Rong and the others were among them.

Chen Xiang released his divine power and probed the experts in the Super Martial School. He needed to find either Wu Kaiming or Huang Jintian as soon as possible.

Most of the Super Martial School’s Rankers were inside the Super Martial profound Realm, so it was not easy for Chen Xiang to enter, but he had to go inside, for Wu Kaiming and Huang Jintian were not outside.

He came to a place where there was no one around, took out his Luotian Gate and opened a door. He entered the Super Martial profound Realm through a spatial door and arrived at Wu Kaiming’s residence.

Chen Xiang had just appeared in the small courtyard of Wu Kaiming’s house, releasing a terrifying aura.

The person who came was really his master, Huang Jintian!

Huang Jintian wore a white robe and had a beard. His pale white hair was combed extremely neatly, and he seemed to be brimming with vitality, giving off the vibe of an expert.

"Master!" Chen Xiang growled, and immediately transformed into his own appearance.

"Ouch!"

Chen Xiang was even hit on the head heavily by Huang Jintian, but Huang Jintian was still smiling as he patted his head, "You little brat, you actually know how to come back and see me!"

Chen Xiang did not come back to look at this madman. Every time he saw Huang Jintian, he would most likely be beaten up.

"I have a lot of conscience to begin with. If I wasn’t in such a terrible situation, I would come back to see you!" Chen Xiang laughed.

Huang Jintian brought Chen Xiang into the house and looked at him indifferently, "Kid, what are you thinking about in your heart, I don’t know. "Don’t even think about lying to me. Why are you looking for me?"

Chen Xiang curled his lips: "I am indeed not here to look for you, you are an old man that doesn’t die, what is there to worry about! I am here to look for Yun Xiaodao and the others. "

"I knew it, you are too unfilial!" Huang Jintian purposely got angry and arrived in front of Chen Xiang in a flash, smashing his fist ruthlessly onto Chen Xiang’s head, causing Chen Xiang to scream like a pig being butchered.

Chen Xiang had an unhappy look on his face, "Master, you old man kicked me out of Super Martial School and didn’t even greet me. I didn’t say anything!"

"Hmph, after you were expelled by me, didn’t you have quite a good time? "His reputation is even greater than mine." Huang Jintian smiled lightly: "However, having a disciple like you is quite satisfying! You haven’t done anything bad in the past few days, so I thought you were dead! "

"The limelight has been stolen by that Dragon Subduing School and Li Baojun, how boring!"

He still did not plan to tell Huang Jintian about the Dragon Subduing School, as he wanted to find a suitable opportunity. Now that he said that he was the Leader of the Dragon Subduing School, it was not enough to scare Huang Jintian to death.

a lad and the little baldy led a team to the east, which is the place where Three Realms Talk is gathered. There is a place called Heaven Thunder Purgatory there, and nearby, there is a Heaven Thunder City. Huang Jintian said.

"Why are they bringing so many disciples there?" Chen Xiang asked in surprise.

"Three Realms Talk! But before that, they have to send all of those disciples into the Heaven Thunder Purgatory! " Huang Jintian looked at Chen Xiang in shock: "Don’t you know about the Heaven Thunder Purgatory?"

Of course Chen Xiang knew, that Heaven Thunder Purgatory was still the place his grandfather had pointed to.

"The Three Realms Talk is being held in the Heaven Thunder City. That city was just established!" Huang Jintian took a sip of tea and said: Heaven Thunder Purgatory was originally a very dangerous place to die, but in this period of time, there was a sudden change. In the center of the Heavenly Thunder Whirlpool, there was a large amount of spatial energy fluctuations. However, when we enter, we will need the protection of some experts to avoid being struck by lightning. "

"The Heaven Thunder Purgatory is a lot quieter now. I’m not sure what kind of things are inside, but I do know that it is related to the Ten Heavens Supreme Lord. It should have been created by the Ten Heavens Supreme Lord!"

Chen Xiang frowned. The Heaven Thunder Purgatory was a huge vortex of lightning that floated high up in the sky, covering a large area of the sky. If it was really a place that was built by the Ten Heavens Supreme Lord, then maybe the Celestial Slain Method was hidden inside!

He did not expect to find Celestial Slain Method in the Heaven Thunder Purgatory, because he had yet to grasp the God slain method and it was only around the corner. In order to obtain the Celestial Slain Method, one might need to master God’s Kill and Earth’s Kill!

"They brought their disciples in to gain experience. It is said that there is another competition. The Demon and Devil Realms went as well as a large group of rogue cultivators. "It would be a pity if you did not attend such a lively event!"

Chen Xiang laughed: "Now that I know, of course I’ll go!"

"Then why don’t you hurry up, but you have to be careful, there are many people gathering there to join the Three Realms Talk." Huang Jintian warned.

"Master, will Super Martial School participate in that competition?" Chen Xiang asked.

"Of course, I’ll have to attend it myself when the time comes!" There are many sects in Chen Martial Continent that can go there, such as Dan Fragrance Pure Land, Lotus Island and the Divine Weapon Sect.

"So that’s how it is. No wonder I couldn’t find them." Chen Xiang had contacted some of the higher-ups in the Dan Fragrance Pure Land, but Hua Xiangyue was not in the Dan Fragrance Pure Land.

"They? Little brat, you got those two female Leader s? " Huang Jintian laughed and asked.

"Nope!" Chen Xiang waved and turned towards the door.

Huang Jintian saw that he had left just like that, so he immediately rushed forward and kicked his butt fiercely: "If you don’t say goodbye to me, then where did your manners go?"

Chen Xiang was kicked flying, smashing a door and a wall, his entire person was covered in dust and dirt. He cursed a few times in his heart, then respectfully said: "Master, disciple will take his leave!"

Seeing Chen Xiang leave through the dimensional door, Huang Jintian muttered: "This guy has a lot of good stuff. No wonder he lives even more carefree than me!" Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Chen Xiang hurried back to Pill City to find Li Baojun and the others. He wanted to take Lan Lan and Yan Yanran to visit the Heaven Thunder Purgatory. Of course, for safety’s sake, he felt that he should invite God White Tiger out in advance.
