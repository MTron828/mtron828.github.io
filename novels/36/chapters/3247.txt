Chen Xiang walked to the front of the ’door’ and saw a hole. He ’inserted’ the Purple Yang Excalibur into it, and ’purple’ light exploded out from the ’door’ and started floating like a water wave. ades: This website has a new website, shorthand method: Strawberry. cmxsw] Read the full text of the latest chapter. The updates were quick.

Chen Xiang controlled a Heaven devouring rat to go out. After the Heaven devouring rat went out, they saw a large expanse of forest, and there was only a sun in the sky. Obviously, that was not the Heaven Old Super Realm, because there were several suns in the Heaven Old Super Realm.

"What is that place?" Chen Xiang was sure that it was not the Divine Wasteland but he was able to recognize the aura of the Divine Wasteland.

"What a strong World Defying Stage Fierce Power, could it be ... Could it be a world above Myriad Tao? " Chen Xiang’s heart trembled, then he told Li Ba what he discovered, "After leaving, you won’t be able to enter anymore!"

The Heaven devouring rat that Chen Xiang released could no longer enter right now, and Chen Xiang could only maintain contact with the Heaven devouring rat through the power of space.

"If it’s a world above Myriad Tao, then that’s not bad. Our Thief Race lived inside it before." Li Ba said, and then began to send people through the ’door’.

All of the Li Family’s people left quickly, leaving only Li Ba here!

"Elder Li, you’re not leaving?" Chen Xiang said: "They have returned to the Myriad Tao and need you very much. You cannot leave them behind."

"No, they can take care of themselves." Li Ba laughed: "I owe you a favor now, I’ll go with you guys, don’t worry, I don’t need anything!"

Li Ba felt that Chen Xiang and Ma Jinhong’s abilities were limited. If he stayed, maybe he could help them.

"Alright!" Chen Xiang had already found a ’door’, and quickly walked over. This’ door ’did not need any Purple Yang Excalibur to open.

Just as they entered the ’door’, a large group of people appeared. Thief King and the others had come!

Chen Xiang had left a few Heaven devouring rat here, so he could see the Thief King and the rest come here as well.

"The big gate should be leaving this place, and the small gate is the entrance to the treasure trove. Let’s chase them!" The Thief King quickly found the small door, opened it and chased after it.

At this moment, more than ten thousand people had already arrived at the great hall. Some chose to leave, while only a few experts wanted to continue searching for the location of the treasure.

They had been trapped here for tens of thousands of years, and now that they had finally made some progress, they definitely would not give up.

After Chen Xiang and the rest entered the ’door’, they madly ran through a passageway. After reaching the end, they were blocked by a stone door, and there was a hole in the door. Chen Xiang easily opened the door once he stabbed the Purple Yang Excalibur in.

After they entered, they hurriedly closed the stone door.

"This stone door can’t stop them for too long." Li Ba said: "The experts from the various great clans in Thief Race, are all experts who destroyed my sect."

Chen Xiang firmly believed in this, otherwise the Thief Race would not have been able to enter the Purple Yang Divine Palace without the help of the Purple Yang Excalibur.

"What is this place?" Ma Jinhong looked around, there was only a single chest here.

Chen Xiang took his Purple Yang Excalibur and walked over, with Ma Jinhong and Ma Jinhong following behind him.

When they approached the light golden box, there was a flash around them and a large light cover appeared, enveloping them.

"This is a barrier." Li Ba was very good at this as well. "Moreover, it’s very strong. If you didn’t have the Purple Yang Excalibur, as long as we got close, we might have been attacked."

There were no gaps in the light gold box. The lid could not be seen and there were no holes!

Ma Jinhong wanted to carry the box, but just as his hands touched the box, he shouted loudly, and at the same time, a charred smell floated out, only to see that Ma Jinhong’s hands had turned into charcoal.

Chen Xiang immediately took out some medicinal liquid and sprayed it on it, allowing Ma Jinhong’s hands to gradually recover.

"How deadly!" Ma Jinhong really couldn’t think of how to heat such a box up to the point that a layer of skin fell off his hands.

"Who asked you to be so anxious. I originally wanted to let Mouse Man give it a try." Chen Xiang laughed.

Just as Chen Xiang was about to use his Purple Yang Excalibur to hack the golden chest, the stone door suddenly roared and was violently destroyed by someone. The first person who rushed in was Thief King, and his face was covered in blood, while the people behind him were all in a sorry state.

"Charge!" Thief King shouted in anger. When he saw the chest, he knew that there were a lot of treasures inside, but just as he was about to rush over, he was sent flying by the light gold shield.

They didn’t have any Purple Yang Excalibur s, so all the traps were activated. On the way, Chen Xiang and the rest all carried Purple Yang Excalibur s, so the three of them were completely fine.

"Haha, you bunch of scum, all of you are just acting like dogs." Ma Jinhong laughed: "What Thief King, in my opinion, it’s just bullsh * t."

Ma Jinhong hated this group of people to the core. Back then, this group of people only watched and didn’t do anything, so Ma Jinhong had always kept this in mind.

"Aren’t those the two old bastards from the Wen Family? Oh, I’ve become an old black egg, haha... "And that little bitch called Qiu Yuqing, she was already very ugly. Now that she’s been burnt to such a state, I saw her almost puking out every night." Ma Jinhong did not care about his life as he scolded the group of people, causing them to become even more furious and started to smash the barrier.

Chen Xiang did not care about all that at the moment, he had to quickly open the box and take the things inside.

"No way!" Chen Xiang used his Purple Yang Excalibur to hack at the chest, only to be blown away by a strong force.

"Even Purple Yang Excalibur can’t do it?" Li Ba carefully looked at the chest, and said: "Try to see if the Purple Yang Excalibur can release a type of flame that can envelop the entire chest, and then cut open the chest."

"I’ll try!" Chen Xiang took a deep breath, and poured a large amount of World Defying Stage Fierce Power into the Purple Yang Excalibur. Then, he saw the Purple Yang Excalibur suddenly flash out a fierce purple flame, which wrapped around the sword body.

Chen Xiang immediately used his sword to cut open the upper layer, he wanted to cut out a hole.

After the people outside saw this, they began to fight even more crazily. Although they were very strong, they were all absorbed by the enchantment.

"No, the energy consumption is huge, come help me." Chen Xiang used up all the World Defying Stage Fierce Power in his body in a short while. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ma Jinhong and Li Ba hurried over and pressed their hands on Chen Xiang’s back, pouring their World Defying Stage Fierce Power into his body, allowing Chen Xiang to use the unique purple flame inside the Purple Yang Excalibur to cut open the chest.

"You bastards, those treasures are mine." Thief King knew that the contents of the chest were definitely very precious. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have been able to protect themselves so well, but right now, they could only look on helplessly.
