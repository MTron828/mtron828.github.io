CHAPTER 437 – EVIL SKELETON MARTIAL SOUL

Chen Xiang had realized that Huang Jintian definitely knew something about that martial soul from Huang Jintian’s expression.

“Teacher, how much do you know about that martial soul?” asked Chen Xiang. If he were to come to know about the weakness of that martial soul, there would be much less pressure on him.

Having witnessed Sun Xueren’s methods, Chen Xiang was also feeling a bit terrified. Mo Tian was just scratched by the tip of that claw and he turned into a middle-aged man in the blink of an eye. Thinking of this, Chen Xiang felt his scalp tingle.

“That martial soul is called Evil Skeleton Martial Soul. Although he just wanted to fuse with his arm, he would lose control to that Evil Skeleton Martial Soul as he gets stronger; that Evil Skeleton Martial Soul would spread to his entire body, turning him into a huge skeleton that will have nothing but evil consciousness!” replied Huang Jintian as his face lined with frowns. “I don’t recommend you to fight with him. You better reconsider it!”

Chen Xiang pondered for a bit before continuing with his questions, “Teacher, where did that Evil Skeleton Martial Soul come from?”

Huang Jintian heaved a long sigh. “It’s a relic from the last Three Realms great battle a hundred thousand years ago. An expert of Kings’ Mainland had captured a devil, and he got that martial soul after killing it. I think that man should be the guy who founded the Divine Martial Palace. In the past, when Wang Quan took it out to show it off, we advised him to destroy it, but who would have expected him to actually use it on his own apprentice.”

Forfeit? Chen Xiang was very reluctant to give up. Having arrived at this point, all that remained was the final battle, after which he could get the Fruit of Fortune.

“Teacher, I want to give it a try, I am cultivating Suppressing Devil Divine Exercise and have cultivated out Suppressing Devil Golden Body. I should be able to restrain that evil thing!” said Chen Xiang.

Earlier, Huang Jintian had also thought of this. Eventually, he nodded, agreeing. “If you can restrain it, you better destroy that Evil Skeleton Martial Soul for good! You don’t need to have scruples about killing Wang Quan’s eldest apprentice!”

“However, you have to be careful about one thing, if you can’t do it, you must try to escape. I think you should be able to do it!”

Chen Xiang believed if he relied on the fusion with Long Xueyi’s power, he should be able to break through Sun Xueren’s Death Whirl.

“Teacher, do you know what that mysterious reward is?” asked Chen Xiang, curious.

“It should be the permission to enter Kings’ Mysterious Realm. As for what’s inside, I am not sure. I once heard it from a Blue Blood’s Family old man! He was also the grandfather of that Lanlan that you have spoken of. I didn’t expect he is actually dead, he should have died while crossing tribulation!” Huang Jintian heaved a sigh, once again.

“Kings’ Mysterious Realm?” Chen Xiang was a little taken aback.

“Mmhmm, not everyone can go inside. Even the tycoons of Kings’ Mainland can’t go in! Therefore, it’s is very mysterious. If you can get in, hei hei, that would be tantamount to a slap in Divine Martial Palace’s face, because the actual residents of Kings’ Mainland couldn’t go in, but you, an outsider could.”

Chen Xiang was in even more anticipation of the Kings’ Mysterious Realm!

Because he was pressed for time, Chen Xiang immediately left after asking some things. Now, he already knew the antecedents of that martial soul, but it did not give him any kind of advantage, whatsoever. Now, he could only hope that the Suppressing Devil Yuan Qi could restrain Sun Xueren’s evil skeleton power.

After having left the forbidden area, Chen Xiang returned to the Extreme Dan King Courtyard, where he rested for a day. After the fight with Lanlan, he was also a bit tired. Casting dragon force with his current strength was very taxing; his consumption of True Qi was very fast. After he had used dragon force to stop Lanlan, he had consumed a greater part of True Qi.

—

There was still a day before the finals. After having seen Sun Xueren’s strength, many people weren’t that confident about Chen Xiang because Mo Tian was also very strong, and yet he was forced to blow up his dantian to save his own life. Many people believed Chen Xiang was just a little bit stronger that Mo Tian.

—

Chen Xiang and Gu Dongchen arrived at the Kings’ Mainland. Just as they arrived, they saw Wu Kaiming appear before them with a solemn look on his face.

“Lanlan has been grievously injured by someone!” said Wu Kaiming.

“Where is she now?” asked Chen Xiang as his face lined with frows. Lanlan was very strong. She may have been injured by him that day, but his Hell Spirit Grass had already made Lanlan recover at an astonishing speed.

“I have left her to Liu Menger and Hua Xiangyue. Hua Xiangyue has fed her dans, but she is still unconscious!” replied Wu Kaiming.

Chen Xiang and Gu Dongchen immediately followed Wu Kaiming to a building, where Liu Menger and Hua Xiangue were holding Lanlan’s wrist, healing Lanlan with their True Qi.

Lanlan was lying on a bed. Her cute little face was as pale as a corpse. Chen Xiang could sense that Lanlan’s vitality was very weak.

“It’s Sun Xueren work!” said Chen Xiang in a heavy tone. He was furious because he reckoned that Sun Xueren must have attacked Lanlan to ask her where she got those demon hearts.

It was impossible for Wang Quan to believe Lanlan. Therefore, he must have asked Sun Xueren to do this so ruthlessly.

“Her injuries are not a big deal, however, her vitality is getting weaker. If the soul doesn’t get any vitality, it would leave the body! You have to quickly think of some way.” said Hua Xiangyue anxiously. Seeing the calm yet afraid look on Chen Xiang’s face, she knew Chen Xiang was furious.

Chen Xiang took out a jade bottle and let Liu Menger open it over Lanlan’s mouth before pouring a drop of crystal-like golden liquid. It was the Golden Dragon Saliva, that had a huge amount of vitality[1] in it. This was also what Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou had advised him to do.

Just as the Golden Dragon Saliva entered Lanlan’s mouth, Lanlan’s complexion immediately became ruddier. But very soon she once again began to lose her vitality.

“Feed her another drop. Elder Wu help out a bit, will you? There is a mass of Death Qi in this little girl’s body, which is madly engulfing her vitality! Only when that mass of Death Qi is expelled can this kid be saved,” said Hua Xiangyue.

Gu Dongchen and Wu Kaiming nodded. They could see that Chen Xiang and Lanlan had pretty good relations.

Liu Menger lifted Lanlan’s tender body so that Lanlan’s back was facing Wu Kaiming and Gu Dongchen. Whereupon, Gu Dongchen, and Wu Kaiming pressed their palm on Lanlan’s back.

Hua Xiangyue and Liu Menger also held Lanlan’s palm with their jade-like palms.

“Start!” said Hua Xiangyue in a low voice.

With the joint effort of four Nirvana Realm experts, that mass of Death Qi dispersed and was then subsequently expelled out of Lanlan’s body as they pour their True Qi into Lanlan’s body.

Black qi immediately emerge from Lanlan’s body before she let out a painful groan. Presently, four tycoons were pouring their True Qi and divine sense into her body, it was impossible for her to not feel any pain. However, she also benefited from this misfortune; her meridians became thicker and sturdier because of this, furthermore, many of her finer meridians were also bypassed.

“Alright!” Liu Menger heaved a light sigh as she let Lanlan lie flat on the bed.

“Feed her another drop!” said Liu Menger to Chen Xiang.

Chen Xiang had a lot of Golden Dragon Saliva. He would certainly not be parsimonious about it. However, this kind of golden liquid made the four Nirvana Realm experts envious, once again. They all knew that this kind of essence was an extreme treasure; just a drop was sufficient enough for someone to quickly recover from his deathbed.

Of course, they didn’t know that it was Chen Xiang’s special ‘saliva’ which he had congealed inside his mouth through a divine exercise.

“Chen Xiang, that Sun Xueren’s evil techniques are very strong, you have to be careful!” exhorted Liu Menger. Although she wanted to persuade Chen Xiang to forfeit, she understood Chen Xiang pretty well; if Chen Xiang believed he could win, any amount of persuasion would all be useless.

Looking at Liu Menger’s pretty eyes filled with concern and worry, Wu Kaiming immediately realized that Chen Xiang’s and Liu Menger’s relation wasn’t that simple! Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com
