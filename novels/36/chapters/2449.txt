Last time, Ning Quan lost five billion to Chen Xiang, and he was scolded to death by a large group of his ancestors. It was because that money belonged to the Ning family that gave him his business, but he did not expect to lose it all instantly.

"Uncle Qiao, it doesn’t matter if you don’t want to bet. We’ll spar again next time." Chen Xiang laughed, his face full of ridicule.

Everyone was secretly laughing, Qiao Kun originally wanted to help his son regain back his dignity, but who knew that it would be so difficult for him to do it now.

"How about this?" Qiao Kun was startled for a moment, and finally thought of a plan to slow down the fighting, and said: "Tomorrow is the Jiang Clan’s patriarch’s birthday, we will compete at that time, and it will add to the excitement of the birthday banquet."

"Ten billion? If you don’t want to bet, then forget about it." Chen Xiang said as his mouth twitched.

"If you can’t afford to bet then just say so. Everyone will laugh at you. Who doesn’t know that 10 billion isn’t something you can casually take out." Xie Qiaoyan said coldly.

Although Chen Xiang was not lacking in Jade money, someone had delivered some to him so he would definitely not refuse. Xie Qiaoyan had a very good relationship with Chen Xiang now, and she also hated this Qiao Kun.

"10 billion is 10 billion. How about we compete in the Jiang Clan tomorrow?" Qiao Kun said loudly.

He was a man, and was even ranked above the Dan God List of Eight Wastelands. He actually did not dare to accept the challenge of a Dao Dan realm Child, and would definitely be laughed at, so he gritted his teeth and accepted the challenge.

"See you tomorrow then. It doesn’t matter if you don’t come, everyone will understand you." Chen Xiang chuckled, with Xie Qiaoyan already walking in front. After Chen Xiang finished speaking, he hurriedly chased after him.

Chen Xiang and Xie Qiaoyan returned to the Villa and chuckled: "This Jade money is earning money too fast, I don’t even need to sell these pills to earn more Jade money."

"It’s not so easy to meet someone who’s so stupid. If Qiao Kun loses to you, everyone will be more cautious next time." Xie Qiaoyan said. As soon as she came back, she sat on the chair. It was obvious that she was exhausted.

"Luckily it went well today. I was almost defeated by that guy." Xie Qiaoyan sighed softly.

"I’ve already said it before, you can only lose to me, you can’t lose to others." Chen Xiang took out a glass of fruit juice and gave it to her, then smiled: "You said that you would give me some benefits, could it be that it’s those 2 billion?"

"Two billion is still not enough, it’s a huge amount. If it’s a person, it would be very difficult to take it out. Ning Quan’s five billion and Qiao Yu’s two billion, are all from the powers behind them." Xie Qiaoyan said.

Chen Xiang laughed: "Then I don’t need it, I’ll return it to you, I want your other repayment."

Xie Qiaoyan frowned: "What can I repay you with, the pill formulas?"

Chen Xiang rubbed his chin, and looked at Xie Qiaoyan with a strange expression. This made Xie Qiaoyan immediately understand.

"Little bastard, don’t you have too much guts? We’ve only known each other for a short period of time, and you already have this kind of idea?" Xie Qiaoyan coldly snorted.

"Although we’ve only known each other for a short time, don’t you think we’re very suitable? Think back on it, there are a few men that can interact with you like this." Chen Xiang laughed.

Chu Hongqing and Yang Xiangyin who were inside the You Yao Mountain Villa were also shocked by Chen Xiang. Chen Xiang had this thought about Xie Qiaoyan, and even attacked so quickly.

However, they didn’t think much of it when they thought about it. They were just taken down easily by Chen Xiang, who was even his female slave.

"Then what do you want?" Xie Qiaoyan looked at Chen Xiang’s handsome face and asked after hesitating for a moment.

"Just let me kiss your little mouth." Chen Xiang laughed sinisterly.

"No." Xie Qiaoyan immediately rejected it: "I’ll at most give you a kiss on the cheek."

"I want a kiss." Chen Xiang shouted.

"If you keep making trouble, I’m leaving." Xie Qiaoyan glared at Chen Xiang with hidden bitterness.

"Alright, let’s kiss on the cheek." Chen Xiang said.

"Hurry up." Xie Qiaoyan’s ice-cold face slightly blushed, and then, he closed his eyes. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Chen Xiang looked at Xie Qiaoyan’s slightly pursed lips, then moved his head over and hugged Xie Qiaoyan at the same time, and actually forcefully kissed Xie Qiaoyan’s lips.

Xie Qiaoyan was shocked, and immediately shouted out. She was fine if she did not scream, but when she shouted, Chen Xiang’s attack succeeded, she really wanted to send Chen Xiang flying, but she was worried about injuring Chen Xiang, so she quickly retreated, struggling, but did not succeed.

"Little Scoundrel, I can’t go around you." Xie Qiaoyan sent a sound transmission to Chen Xiang; he was very angry.

At first, Xie Qiaoyan was very uncooperative, but since she didn’t have much experience with it, the process wasn’t going smoothly for her. However, Chen Xiang had a lot of experience in this field, not long after, Xie Qiaoyan fell and kissed him ...

Of course, it was only for a short period of time, and Chen Xiang’s goal had been achieved. When the lips parted, Chen Xiang immediately defended himself.

"Hmph, return 2 billion to me." Xie Qiaoyan pinched Chen Xiang with all his strength and shouted.

Chen Xiang took out two billion, licked his lips, and said with a smile: "It’s only a kiss and it’s two billion, it’s really a bit expensive."

"Don’t bring this up again. Just now, it was as if nothing had happened." When Xie Qiaoyan thought back to this matter, she also had a complicated feeling. She had never experienced something like this before, and even though she was very angry, her anger towards Chen Xiang was also only a bit heavier.

If it was anyone else, they would have been killed by her earlier.

"Here you go." Chen Xiang passed over the two billion Jade money, then said with a smile: "Big Sister Qianyan, would you hate me?"

"I hate you." Xie Qiaoyan took it and fiercely glared at him.

"Since you’ve been single for so long, you should at least make do with me." Chen Xiang laughed.

"Hmph, don’t think that I don’t know you’re a romantic one. You have two female slaves by your side, who knows where a large group of them might be hiding." Xie Qiaoyan was so angry that he scrunched his face.

"Qiao Yan, do you have the Dao Gu Dan’s medicinal ingredients?" Chen Xiang asked: "Give me one."

"Take it." Xie Qiaoyan passed Chen Xiang a set of Dao Gu Dan s’ medicinal ingredients. There were only three ingredients: "Do you need a pill formula?"

"No need, I don’t have any plans to refine Dao Gu Dan yet." Chen Xiang laughed, then went to touch Xie Qiaoyan’s face, and Xie Qiaoyan opened his hands.

But Chen Xiang did not give up, and continued to play with Xie Qiaoyan, as if he was an angry child. After Xie Qiaoyan could not bear it any longer, he pinched the flesh of his body.

"Don’t think I’m easy to bully." Xie Qiaoyan coldly snorted.

"I’m tired, so I’m going to rest first. Little bastard, don’t act recklessly. Don’t force me to beat you up." After Xie Qiaoyan finished speaking, he hurriedly returned to his room.

Chen Xiang laughed, licked her lips, and thought back to that feeling just now. was so angry at heart, she wanted to slap him, but she did not do anything. She did not know why she did not do anything.

After Xie Qiaoyan returned to his room, he laid on the chair and looked at the methods inside the Heavenly Alchemy. He felt that many of the powerful pill techniques in this era should be related to the Heavenly Alchemy.
