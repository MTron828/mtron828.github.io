Colorful Balloons Take Flight

After Chen Xiang’s Heavenly Alchemy Emperor seal was thrown out, the majority of the World Defying Stage Divine Power in his body was originally empty. The powerful energy that he released turned into golden light, forming a huge palm that fiercely smashed towards the group of people who had just descended from the Divine Wasteland.

That group of people didn’t even have time to react before they were enveloped by the huge golden palm and pressed towards the mountain on the ground!

Rumble rumble rumble!

An explosive sound rang out. The golden brilliance flickered like the roaring of a blazing sun, and when everyone felt such powerful fluctuations, they all flew high into the air, lest they were caught up in it!

Although the experts of the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain were fast, when they went over, that huge handprint had already killed that group of people and even shattered that huge and deep mountain!

BOOM!

The tremors continued, and a huge black hole appeared in the middle of the island. Sea water crazily poured into this hole, as this place originally had a huge divine mountain.

However, it had been turned into ashes and was replaced with a huge lake!

"Gone, gone ..." An old man from the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain suddenly roared. He scanned the surroundings and wanted to find this person.

Amongst the people who came down from the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain, the strongest were two who had just cultivated and formed the World Defying Holy Body, the rest were all from the World Defying Stage, after obtaining these people, dealing with the Hundreds of Flowers Village would be as easy as flipping his hand.

However, these people had all been killed, and they had no idea who it was!

Chen Xiang had already used the Counter Power to hide himself, he did not expect the Six beasts’s power that he had just borrowed to be so terrifying.

This was, after all, the power of six World Defying beast s, and it was equivalent to the power of six World Defying Stage’s Saint Rankers. In addition to his own World Defying Stage Divine Power, it was unimaginably strong!

"The Six beasts is really too scary. No wonder the World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect and the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain both want to take my World Defying Green dragon as their own." This was the first time Chen Xiang released the power of a Six beasts. This kind of terrifying might was something even he was shocked by.

The Myriad Tao Divine Mountain was extremely important, because there were many array formations inside the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain. These array formations could allow the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain to absorb the energy from above the Divine Wasteland, and could also gather a large portion of the Natural Law World’s energy.

But now, it was destroyed all of a sudden. This was something that they could not even imagine before, because they felt that in the entire Natural Law World, they were the strongest!

Even if it was the World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect s, they would not be able to do such a thing!

However, they had their suspicions of World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect at the very first moment and rushed there furiously!

The island had been destroyed. The place where the divine mountain was located had been turned into a huge lake. The formation had completely disappeared. However, it had happened not long ago. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Chen Xiang left the God Mountain Island feeling very satisfied.

When he returned to the Hundreds of Flowers Village, the array had already been set up.

"Something big has happened to the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain. Did you do it?" Lv Qilian saw Chen Xiang walking to her room with a smile on his face, so she asked. She had already received the news from Yan Yanran.

"You’re really well-informed. This is just something that happened a moment ago. You already know that now." Chen Xiang exclaimed.

"Myriad Tao Divine Mountain is currently our enemy, of course I have to pay close attention! It was the news that Yanran and the rest sent back, and it was indeed you who did it! " When Lv Qilian found out about this, he thought it was Chen Xiang, but she still could not believe it, because she felt that even if Chen Xiang had already cultivated the World Defying Holy Body, he should not be that strong.

But when she saw Chen Xiang’s expression, she was sure it was Chen Xiang.

Chen Xiang immediately walked over, and happily picked Lv Qilian up, allowing her to sit on his lap. Then, he whispered to Lv Qilian as they got up.

"Little scoundrel ..." Lv Qilian saw and snorted softly.

... ....

After Chen Xiang had a sweet time with her, he went to find her.

Feng Ke’er was currently with Xue Xianxian and the others, she was extremely curious about the process of refining these girls. This allowed her to learn a lot of things, and at the same time, teach them some of her own experiences.

"Xiao Ke’er, quickly come and help brother refine pills!" Chen Xiang laughed: "Just now, I did something big."

"What’s the big deal?" Dongfang Jing was extremely curious, she saw that Chen Xiang was smiling so much that she wanted to know what Chen Xiang had done that made him so happy.

"I flattened the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain, and took care of it all at once. Even I didn’t expect that I would be so powerful." Chen Xiang pinched Dongfang Jing’s cute little face in a complacent manner: "Brother’s amazing, right?"

"Amazing, I’ve been to the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain, there is a strong barrier there, bro, you actually pushed it to the ground!" Dongfang Jing’s face was full of surprise.

Chen Xiang was his recognized sister, and also his woman. He loved this little fool very much, so he really liked to show off in front of Dongfang Jing.

"Really? Myriad Tao Divine Mountain will definitely make a huge move next! " Liu Meng’er said worriedly, "Myriad Tao Divine Mountain’s defenses are indeed not bad, but right now, with Xiao Ke’er’s help, our Hundreds of Flowers Village and the Heavenly Dragon City have become very strong, and should be even stronger than him."

"No matter how big the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain’s actions are, it’s useless because they are unable to order the World Defying Stage’s Divine Ranked people to come down. This is because if they want to descend from above, they need a very strong person to open up a spatial tunnel for them." Feng Ke’er said: "But they will definitely send out more Saint-rank experts."

"Oh right, what did you borrow the power of to flatten Myriad Tao Divine Mountain?" Feng Ke’er had seen many of Chen Xiang’s divine tools.

"This!" Chen Xiang took out the Heavenly Alchemy Emperor seal and said: "This thing is very powerful, I wonder if it can be strengthened with the Myriad Tao Divine Soil?"

Heavenly Alchemy Emperor seal were Heavenly Alchemy artifact s, they had evolved from the fusion of Emperor seal from before.

Xue Xianxian immediately took it and looked, and quickly discovered the power of Heavenly Alchemy Emperor seal!

"Spirit grain is very profound, this kind of Spirit grain should originate from the Myriad Tao’s Divine Arts!" Not long ago, Chen Xiang had passed down the Myriad Tao’s Divine Arts to them, and there were quite a few Spirit grain recorded in it.

"Yes, the Myriad Tao Divine Arts is a very weird technique, I have heard of it before." Feng Ke’er said: "The Spirit grain inside are very special."

Chen Xiang did not understand all this, he was only concerned about the strength of the Heavenly Alchemy Emperor seal.

"I feel that this Heavenly Alchemy Emperor seal has a bottleneck, and the amount of World Defying Stage Divine Power it can bear has a certain limit." Chen Xiang said. The strongest attack he had released earlier, he sensed that the Heavenly Alchemy Emperor seal could not contain any more World Defying Stage Divine Power.

"You stay here and let us try using the Myriad Tao Divine Soil." Dongfang Xinyue said.
