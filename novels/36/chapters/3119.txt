Everyone had seen Chen Xiang’s strength, to be able to easily kill the fat old man, this kind of strength was indeed shocking, but the 18 Rankers all felt that they had the confidence to win, as they were the most famous and oldest Rankers here. They hoped that Chen Xiang would be weaker, but they were worried that he would lose four rounds consecutively, and at that time, they would not have any more chances.

Of course, Yuan Xufeng hoped that Chen Xiang would be weaker than he imagined since it would be easier for him to fight. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Chen Xiang was relatively at ease, all of their cultivation levels were higher than him, but they did not dare to do anything, because as long as they did not kill him, they would not be able to obtain his Wudao spiritual Dan.

This would cause them to be unable to display their true strength. This would benefit Chen Xiang, so he had the confidence to defeat them.

"You can use weapons in battle!" Yuan Xufeng asked, he took out a blue big blade, the blade looked very sturdy, the blade body was also glowing with blue electric light.

"Of course you can!" Chen Xiang was extremely curious about this blade. All the people here were cultivating without a path and were not able to use the various types of energy in the Myriad Tao, but this blade contained an extremely dense amount of lightning energy, and was not like a product of this place. Everyone knew that Chen Xiang had a very sharp sword, but they felt that the weapon in their hands were also very powerful, and should be able to block Chen Xiang’s sharp sword. xstxt

"Don’t worry. I won’t kill you. I also hope that you will be more tactful. If you know that you cannot defeat me, it would be best for you and me to surrender as soon as possible." Yuan Xufeng laughed, looking at him like he was determined to win.

Chen Xiang did not have a good impression of Yuan Xufeng, and looked rather sinister, and a little arrogant. If it wasn’t for the fact that he had a Wudao spiritual Dan, he would have definitely been killed by Yuan Xufeng during the battle.

"I understand. I’m very afraid of death." Chen Xiang laughed: "I also hope that you can be more tactful, if you can’t beat me in a fight then admit defeat, you are different from me, I can kill you."

After Chen Xiang finished speaking, he looked at the other seventeen Rankers and said: "In battle, facing strong people like you, I will not go easy on you. If you guys were to be killed by me, please forgive me."

What was the point of understanding after death? Everyone cursed in their hearts!

"Just go ahead and fight. This is the type of battle that is supposed to be fought in the first place! We are your seniors, and our cultivation is higher than yours. An old man said.

His words made people feel that they were being very reasonable, and if he was being reasonable, they should not have taken Chen Xiang’s Wudao spiritual Dan, and should have left obediently.

"Then I won’t be polite." Chen Xiang took a deep breath, then shouted: "Let’s walk a hundred steps separately with our backs facing each other, and then the battle will immediately begin."

"Alright!" Yuan Xufeng nodded in agreement. Then, they walked a hundred steps, with their backs to each other.

They were running at the same speed, so when they finished a hundred steps, they immediately turned around and charged at each other!

The two of them were almost at the same speed, so in the instant after they were a hundred steps away, they suddenly turned around and collided with each other.

The only difference was that Yuan Xufeng had used his blue divine blade to charge over and slash at Chen Xiang, but Chen Xiang had no use for it, and actually challenged Yuan Xufeng with his bare hands. This surprised everyone, because Chen Xiang actually did not use his powerful divine sword!

When Chen Xiang rushed over, he knew that Yuan Xufeng was going to use his blade, so he dodged it immediately. When he was dodging, he threw out a punch through the air.

After punching out, he immediately dodged. When the fist force rushed over, Yuan Xufeng also noticed it, his body trembled, and released a burst of powerful force, causing Chen Xiang’s fist force to dissipate, and then locked onto Chen Xiang’s position, and fiercely slashed out a few more times. The blade and blade were releasing a burst of berserk energy, and released wave after wave of howling and exploding sounds.

"He’s really amazing!" Chen Xiang unleashed Heaven Blasting Palm towards the blade force, causing the berserk blade force to be blown away, but the wave of Qi still affected him.

Although they had only received a few moves, they had already determined that Chen Xiang’s strength was on par with his. Especially in terms of strength, he was actually able to disperse the force of’s blade.

Chen Xiang saw the look on the other party’s face, and secretly went on guard. He was worried that the other party would trick him.

"Looks like we’re going to have a tough battle." Yuan Xufeng laughed: "It’s been a long time since I’ve fought in a battle like this, I’m still looking forward to it.

"I’m looking forward to it as well. Let’s have a good fight then." Then, he was the first to rush over and start fighting with Yuan Xufeng.

Everyone was watching from afar, they were very serious, especially those seventeen people, because they could help them to understand just what kind of strength Chen Xiang had.

When they saw that Chen Xiang was equally strong as Yuan Xufeng, their hearts grew heavy, because Chen Xiang was not weak at all! They all knew Yuan Xufeng’s true strength. If Yuan Xufeng was not able to defeat him, it would be difficult for them to defeat him.

However, Yuan Xufeng was still an old guy, so he should be stronger than Chen Xiang in every aspect. If it was going to be a prolonged battle, they all thought that Chen Xiang would be unable to defeat Yuan Xufeng, the old fellow.

The Heavenly magic sword that they were more worried about before had also not appeared at this time. They felt that Chen Xiang should release the Heavenly magic sword at this time, in order to avoid a prolonged battle.

"Why hasn’t he used that sword yet?" An old man in red said in a low voice.

"Maybe he deliberately chose not to use it because he wanted to catch me off guard."

"That’s not right. If he continues, he will only be at a disadvantage. When the time comes, no matter how strong that sword is, it will be useless."

That’s right, Yuan Xufeng must have been wary of his sword, he should have used it long ago.

Their voices were loud, and she was doing it on purpose for Chen Xiang to hear. She was hoping for Chen Xiang to use the godly sword quickly so that he had a very good chance of defeating Yuan Xufeng.

As long as they weren’t the ones fighting, they hoped that Chen Xiang would win. This way, they had a better chance to obtain the Wudao spiritual Dan.

Yuan Xufeng heard the people at the side discussing loudly, he was furious and cursed in his heart, because if Chen Xiang were to use the divine sword right now, he really wouldn’t be able to deal with him.
