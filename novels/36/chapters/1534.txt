Only by eating a Yuxian Dan would Red Dawn be able to verify the authenticity of these Yuxian Dan. She still didn’t quite believe it.

After eating, she had no choice but to believe that the Yuxian Dan that Chen Xiang refined was of good quality. He was definitely a genius in alchemy, causing her to have a yearning for talent.

"I’ll try my best to help you fight for it. The speed at which you refine Yuxian Dan is that fast, so there’s a high chance that I’ll get my Big Sis and Second Sis to help out again." Red Dawn had given three Yuxian Dan s, Chen Xiang, and their cooperation had already started.

"You have to tell your sisters." Chen Xiang asked.

"They are my blood sisters. If there’s anything good, I’ll definitely think of them. Don’t worry, I’ve been with them for a long time and we have great trust in each other. I know they won’t leak this out." Red Cloud said, "You can come back tomorrow. You can go back for now."

Red Cloud gave a plate of Chen Xiang. This was the proof of passing the examination.

"Right, what’s your name?" Red Cloud suddenly thought of this matter.

"Chen Xiang." Chen Xiang was not afraid to reveal his name, and the only person who knew him was probably Ji Ling’er.

"En, remember to come tomorrow. Don’t forget, I will help you fight for it today." Red Cloud reminded him.

Chen Xiang nodded his head, then left the Three Aurora Pavilion with a good mood, and returned to the cave that Ji Ling’er bought outside the city.

Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou followed Ji Ling’er as they strolled around Heaven Sacred District buying a lot of things.

"Ling’er." Chen Xiang knocked on the stone door of the cave and shouted:

Ji Ling’er opened the stone door, and after seeing Chen Xiang, he asked: "How is it?"

"Let’s go in first."

At this moment, Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou were arranging the beautiful clothes that they had just bought. Ji Ling’er invited him to sit down and poured some sweet spring water for them.

"The one who is in charge of interviewing me is the Saint Daughter of Red Clouds." Chen Xiang said.

"It’s actually her. She’s the Holy Maiden ranked third, but I heard that they’re preparing to withdraw from the Holy Maiden election and focus on taking care of the sect their master created." Ji Ling’er replied: "The results are right."

"It could be said that everything went smoothly." Chen Xiang drank a mouthful of water. These were all things that Ji Ling’er and the others had just bought, it was so satisfying that Chen Xiang trembled a little: "It’s just that some things that I didn’t expect happened."

"The Three Suns Holy Maiden is one of the three sisters, she is not as impressive as she looks on the surface. She should only be considered as a lowly servant, slightly better than the others." Chen Xiang said: "So they do not have the authority to let me refine a large number of Yuling bamboo shoots."

"Then you cooperated with them in order to win them over." Su Meiyao could tell immediately.

"I’ll cooperate with Red Dawn so I can refine five Yuxian Dan for her to see. After that, I can give one pellet to her each time, in exchange for that." Chen Xiang looked at Ji Ling’er and asked, "How are the three sisters?

Ji Ling’er said seriously: "Their people are not bad, they helped me before, but when I killed the Holy Beasts, they insisted on having the Beast Pills and gave me that broken corpse, so in the end they had some conflicts, and when they were ranked in the top three, they even beat me up a little."

"That’s good." Chen Xiang nodded.

"Apart from these, nothing else has happened. Logically speaking, it’s impossible for you to talk so fast." asked. Red Cloud was a Holy Daughter, and although Chen Xiang was pretty good-looking, she was still a kid with a low cultivation.

Then, Chen Xiang told them about the Holy Spirit Fire.

"So that’s how it is, red clouds can’t settle your Fire Soul, no wonder she’s so interested in you." Ji Ling’er laughed: "You might be in some trouble."

On the contrary, Chen Xiang didn’t think so. He felt that the Red Cloud Holy Woman was very good, making him feel close to her. Furthermore, the Red Dawn Holy Maiden had said that they had to agree on something.

"Ling’er, do the three of them really have no status at all?" Chen Xiang asked curiously.

"Their strength is about the same as me, and they are only in the top three of the Holy Maiden. I’ve been so poor, but at most they are only a little better than me. Hearing you say this, I feel that behind them is not only a single master, but also a large group of people." Ji Ling’er snorted: "Women do not have absolute strength here, what status do they have?"

"I will be concocting pills there, you guys stay here and have fun. After I break through, I will think of a way to earn some Holy stone." Chen Xiang said: "Are there enough Holy stone s?"

"Enough, I won’t cultivate for now. If I just buy some small things, I won’t be able to use them all." Ji Ling’er looked at Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou: "I will bring them for a good stroll around here. Don’t worry and go back to concoct pills, come back when it’s about time, I’ll help you cultivate."

The next day, Chen Xiang arrived early the next day. With his jade tablet, he very quickly saw the red clouds.

Red Dawn brought him to a secret room. With a face full of smiles, he could tell that everything was going smoothly on her side.

"This is seven thousand Yuling bamboo shoots, you can slowly refine it. When the time comes, don’t forget about me. We three sisters had great difficulty obtaining it." Hong Xia passed a Storage bag to Chen Xiang.

Chen Xiang received it, and nodded with a smile on his face.

"Sister Hong, wasn’t that sect founded by your master? You should have a lot of power." Chen Xiang asked.

"It was created by our Martial Uncle. My Master was only invited to join, and those with more authority are all my Martial Uncle’s people, and my Martial Uncle’s disciples, including our Senior Brothers, are all more powerful than us three sisters. Not to mention my Martial Uncle’s trusted elders, we are just doing odd jobs." Hong Xia sighed helplessly and said, "Moreover, the rewards are very low as well. If necessary, they would let us marry out and form some connections with some of the big powers."

Chen Xiang said in shock: "You guys can also endure it like that, it’s fine if your master wants you to marry him, but that Senior Master of yours has a shitty relationship with you guys, it’s not like he’s the one who raised you."

If it really happened, we would probably end up like that Ji Ling’er. However, Ji Ling’er is much better, he would have taken away at least one hundred fifty kilograms of Holy stone. "

"If I need any help later, I can provide some." Chen Xiang laughed.

"Un, you should start concocting the pills properly. I won’t bother you anymore. If you need anything, just come find me. I will stay here forever." Red Cloud said,

Hong Xia thought highly of Chen Xiang, and Chen Xiang also thought highly of her. This was because she had the Holy Spirit Fire in her body, so she might be able to become a strong female Fire Emperor in the future.

Chen Xiang had opened the array formation for this secret room, and was unable to open the door from the outside. This was because he had some skills that could not be seen by others while he was refining pills.

"Seven thousand batches, looks like I’ll have to use Dawan refining method, if not who knows how many years I’ll have to refine it." Chen Xiang looked at the mountains of Yuling bamboo shoots s. After refining, he would have more than 20,000 pills.

In a situation where he was unable to purchase a Yuling bamboo shoots, he felt that this transaction was very worthwhile.
