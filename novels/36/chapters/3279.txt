After successfully escaping, when Chen Xiang thought back to it, he did not feel any lingering fear. Just now, he was almost caught. [Previous Chapter] [Table of Contents]

Qin Shuang sat on a chair, and snorted: "It’s just inside the Heaven Fire City, if it’s outside, I won’t be afraid of them!"

The Heaven Fire City was Zhu Haiprofound’s territory. If Qin Shuang were to fight inside, once the experts of the Fierce Saber Race arrived, she would definitely be captured.

"Don’t be upset, we still have a chance to get rid of them." Chen Xiang said: "We need to find out where the World Defying holy dragon is.

Qin Shuang could only listen to Chen Xiang’s arrangements. After all, it had always been Chen Xiang who had taken her out of danger a few times.

"If you want to find out the whereabouts of the World Defying holy dragon, you can only ask some old fellows. Go to Ao Long City." Qin Shuang said: "Even though this is a small city, there are a lot of old fellows inside. They have all seen World Defying holy dragon before."

"Wait a minute, are those old fellows powerful? What if they refuse to tell us? " Chen Xiang asked: "Are they related to Soul River Divine Race or not?"

"They are all very old, and they are all seriously injured. Ao Dragon City was established by a person who had fought with World Defying holy dragon before. After that, many people who had fought with World Defying holy dragon or had seen World Defying holy dragon gathered together after knowing about the city. " Qin Shuang said: "When the time comes, we will just go find those injured old fellows. They shouldn’t have any temper."

Chen Xiang controlled the Six Realms mirrors to fly towards Ao Dragon City.

After a few days, they arrived at Ao Long City. Entering Ao Long City did not need to pay the Myriad Tao Divine Soil fees, it was different from the previous city, but there were very few people in Ao Long City, the city looked old and shabby, the entire city seemed very lonely.

When Qin Shuang came to this city, he found out that an injured old man was still here, so they immediately rushed over.

The old man was called Zuo Tianyi, although he owned a big house, he was the only one in the house, he was previously a famous hunter, and had hunted some powerful and rare arrogant wild beasts before, but later on he was injured, which affected his roots greatly and could only stay here to die.

"Uncle Zuo!" Chen Xiang knocked on the ’door’ and shouted.

Not long after, an old man who was at the brink of death opened the door a little. After he saw Chen Xiang and Qin Shuang, he smiled and said, "We are not recruiting servants here, go to another house!"

"You misunderstand, we came to ask you about the World Defying holy dragon!" Chen Xiang smiled.

"You want to look for the World Defying holy dragon? You believe in the existence of World Defying holy dragon? " Zuo Tianyi was a little surprised.

"Does the World Defying holy dragon not exist?" Chen Xiang asked.

"Of course it exists. Come in and we’ll talk about it!"

Zuo Tianyi hurriedly invited Chen Xiang and her into the old house, then called them to enter a dilapidated hall.

"Sigh, this city is declining ... It was mainly because the World Defying holy dragon had not appeared for a very long time and no one had ever seen it again, that after a while, no one had any interest in it. And later on, there were even many people who suspected that the World Defying holy dragon was fake ... They can’t believe there’s such a powerful creature. " Zuo Tianyi poured tea for Chen Xiang and the others.

It was true that the World Defying holy dragon had not appeared for a very long time, but Qin Shuang had only heard of it by chance.

"Recently, the World Defying holy dragon has appeared again." Chen Xiang lowered his voice and said: "Master Zuo, do you know about the gathering of multiple powerful clans in Heaven Fire City?"

"I heard about it. Although this Auland City is deserted, the news is very well-connected." Zuo Tianyi was shocked, and said: "Could it be that they have already discovered the World Defying holy dragon?"

Qin Shuang nodded his head, "That’s right, they want to join hands and hunt World Defying holy dragon!"

"If several large clans were to attack together... Maybe we can take him down. " Zuo Tianyi frowned, as though he was thinking about something, he thought for a moment, then suddenly shook his head: "Even if it’s a few strong clans joining hands, it’s not possible, that guy is very powerful."

"Why?" Qin Shuang asked.

"Because World Defying holy dragon are very strong and are constantly improving." Zuo Tianyi’s face suddenly revealed a terrified expression, and said: "You all have never seen the World Defying holy dragon before, but I have. However, I only just saw him and he already crippled me. That guy didn’t kill me ... I used a trailer to ’get’ myself back here. "

Zuo Tianyi and Qin Shuang had heard some news about him before, but Zuo Tianyi had surpassed the strength of the World Defying crazy realm and even though he was a Aoshi Holy Stage, he was still injured by the World Defying holy dragon in an instant.

"Master Zuo, do you know how to find the World Defying holy dragon?" Chen Xiang asked. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

"Finding the World Defying holy dragon is more difficult ... However, now that he has revealed himself, it means that he has broken through. " Zuo Tianyi took out the box, inside it was a small piece of red thing.

"What is this?" Chen Xiang asked.

"Dragon scale!" Back then, the City Lord had ’taken’ a large piece of the World Defying holy dragon’s dragon scales. This proved the existence of the World Defying holy dragon! If we go near the World Defying holy dragon, this piece of dragon’s scale will light up. " Zuo Tianyi passed it to Chen Xiang, and said: "I’ll give this to you, it’ll help you find the World Defying holy dragon."

"Must we get closer?" Qin Shuang asked.

"You don’t need to get too close ... Generally speaking, World Defying holy dragon will go crazy once in a while, and when that time comes, his dragon’s might will release, and the dragon’s scale will light up, and you guys will spin at the same place while holding the dragon’s scale, and in that direction, the World Defying holy dragon will go crazy. After Zuo Tianyi finished speaking, he once again warned them in a serious and serious manner, "All of you must remember, you can only watch from afar.

"Alright, we understand. Thank you, Lord Zuo!" Chen Xiang put away the dragon’s scale and then took out ten Myriad Tao Divine Soil Pills that he had refined.

"Lord Zuo, this is a pill concocted by this brat. It might be beneficial to your injuries." Chen Xiang said.

"You’re also a Alchemist!" Zuo Tianyi was surprised, and laughed.

"Yeah, but I didn’t pass the Alchemy Hall’s authentication." Chen Xiang felt that Zuo Tianyi’s injuries were caused by severe injuries, causing him to be unable to circulate his strength.

And the Myriad Tao Divine Soil Pellet was a pellet for strengthening the body, it would also help to heal the injuries on one’s body!

Zuo Tianyi was very focused at the moment, and could be seen that his Divine Sense Sea was unharmed.

"What bullsh * t Alchemy Temple, they’re all things that anger people can do." Zuo Tianyi was an old fellow, he naturally knew that the Alchemy God Hall was something that the races had created to control the market and price of the alchemy pills.

"Boss Zuo, can you spread the news?" Chen Xiang said: "To be honest, the reason those clans went to hunt World Defying holy dragon was because they found out that the World Defying holy dragon possessed the Tao-creation’s Holy Crystal!"
