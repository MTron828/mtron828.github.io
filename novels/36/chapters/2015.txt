Yue’er took out a pearl from nowhere and handed it to Yang Tianyi.

Yang Tianyi looked at the blue flickering flame inside the bead, and asked: "This divine soul is very familiar, I think I’ve seen it somewhere before!"

"This is Star divine soul. After the destruction of some sun-like stars, it is possible that they would give birth to this kind of Star divine soul. I have only collected this for many years!" Yue Er said.

Yang Tianyi was surprised, and laughed: "Your divine soul is not bad, why didn’t you just give it to this kid? That Ancestor Emperor’s divine soul might not even be as good as this. "

"No, that stupid cow has quite a bit of divine soul. If we give it to Chen Xiang to retrieve the soul, he only needs to take out most of the divine soul and the Divine Deity of that stupid cow, and then let him refine everything into a whole. That would be the strongest." Yue Er said.

Chen Xiang had the Heavenly Alchemy, so fusing divine soul and Divine Deity that were of the same origin was simply too easy. This was something Chen Xiang had never thought of before.

Yang Tianyi nodded his head, he knew that Chen Xiang had very good pill refining skills, and laughed: "Then I will not be courteous, it is just that when the time comes, I will need some time to fuse them."

Currently, in this place, the Ancestor Emperor who had just woken up was the strongest, no one could deal with him unless he personally took action. However, Yue’er knew that the Ancestor Emperor was also connected to the Divine Nations.

Yue’er had a very bad impression of those Divine Nations s. When she first arrived here, she was attacked by the strong warriors of the Divine Nations.

So Yue’er placed her hopes on Yang Tianyi, and furthermore, after Yang Tianyi killed the Star Moon Ancestor Emperor, he could still obtain Divine Deity from them!

Yue’er was very clear that the reason she had the chance to recover her memories was all because Chen Xiang had risked his life to save her and she also liked to stay by Chen Xiang’s side.

"Go back to the Heroes Gathering Divine City and fuse with them. When the time comes, we will provide you with a place. But when you go to that city, you must converge and not destroy it!" Just now, Yang Tianyi had almost destroyed this beautiful grassland.

Very quickly, Chen Xiang and Yue’er brought Yang Tianyi back to Heroes Gathering Divine City!

The Heroes Gathering Divine City’s Great Assembly was called the Assembly of the Supreme Gods. The elites from the various forces in the Super God Realm were gathered here to compete with each other, and if there were any good seedlings, they would be selected by the Divine Nations and sent into the world of the Divine Nations to be nurtured.

This was something that many outstanding young disciples looked forward to, so when the time came, everyone would definitely fight with all their might.

Chen Xiang brought Yang Tianyi to his shop. Right now, the shop was closed, but there was someone inside.

Feng Yujie and Shui Bingyan were both here. When they saw Chen Xiang and Yue’er had returned, they were extremely happy because they were extremely worried about Chen Xiang.

"BingYan!" Yue’er shouted with her sweet voice, then happily threw herself into Shui Bingyan’s embrace.

"Hello Elder Brother Shen, this big brother is ..." When Shui Bingyan saw Chen Xiang, he immediately greeted him and then looked at him.

"He’s Big Brother Yang. He needs a basement now." Chen Xiang smiled and caressed Shui Bingyan’s hair.

Yue’er replied, "I know where it is. I’ll take him there!"

Yang Tianyi cupped his fists towards Feng Yujie and Shui Bingyan, and then hurriedly followed Yue’er.

"Who is this person?" Feng Yujie hurriedly went forward to hug Chen Xiang, because she found out from Yue’er that Chen Xiang had met with danger. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have not returned even at the start of the convention. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Chen Xiang kissed her small mouth and said: "It’s alright, just now, Big Brother Yang was a good person who helped me. Furthermore, he still has to help Yue’er to defeat the enemy."

"Right, aren’t you going to watch the convention begin?"

Feng Yujie shook his head: "I didn’t hear any news about you, I don’t want to go anywhere! The White Tiger and Vermillion Bird have also gone to join in the fun, they have been chatting with Mu Chen and Xiao Changle very much. "

Yue’er flew back, saying with a smile, "That guy has already gone into seclusion. Once he defeats that stupid cow, we’ll be safe."

Feng Yujie asked curiously: "What exactly happened to you two? I keep having the feeling that you are hiding something big! "

"Let me say! Let me say it! " Yue’er hurriedly shouted, because the moment she recovered her memories, she immediately told Feng Yujie and Shui Bingyan that she was in trouble, and then hurriedly left. She didn’t even have time to tell Feng Yujie and Shui Bingyan about her own matters.

Chen Xiang asked: "The Great Games have begun, is it okay if we don’t go?"

"It’s fine, we are only announcing the start of the conference. Today, we will be competing in other matches, we will be refining Xiaping Dan tomorrow." Feng Yujie said.

Yue’er began to recount her experiences, how she was besieged by Divine Nations Rankers and then ambushed by them, becoming their sacrifice ... Finally, she went to the Moon Slaughter Devil Nest to save Chen Xiang.

"This is the Bone level Dan’s medicine!" Chen Xiang took out two copies and gave it to Feng Yujie, then laughed: "This is very easy to refine, you don’t need me to teach you! These Bone level Dan’s medicinal ingredients are all low-grade, we have to make high-grade ones! "

Feng Yujie’s face immediately blushed a little. She and Chen Xiang had been separated for a period of time, and thinking about the pair cultivation’s sweet and intoxicating feeling, she couldn’t help but feel lost in her heart.

Chen Xiang still had a Bone level Dan, he said: "BingYan, try eating one first, after cultivating Bones, you will become stronger."

Yue’er said: "BingYan is a dao spirit, she has already cultivated a body similar to a human’s, and might even be stronger than a human’s. Furthermore, her comprehension towards natural strength is deeper, so cultivating Bones isn’t too difficult! Let me teach her! "

Feng Yujie rubbed Yue’er’s back, and laughed: "Yue’er, you can’t possibly have always been a little kitten, right? You were definitely not like this in the past, you should have also cultivated out your Bones by now! "

"Of course, I only need to have the Star and Moon Feast to recover my strength. At that time, I can also take human form." Yue’er smiled and said, "BingYan, let’s go!"

Yue’er had already seen through the expressions of Chen Xiang and Mu Yurou just now.

Chen Xiang and Feng Yujie did not enter the room, but went into the Pill Refining Room instead. They still had some Bone level Dan’s ingredients, and Feng Yujie also needed to condense his Bones, so they decided to first refine the pills, and as for dual cultivation ... That was tonight.

Chen Xiang spent a lot of time refining Bone level Dan in the Divine Sense Sea, but it only took four hours to refine a furnace outside. There were a total of five pills!

"Are you going to eat now?" Chen Xiang asked.

"No, we’ll eat after the convention ends. At that time, we might need some time." Feng Yujie shook his head.

When they came out of the refining room, they saw Yue’er and Shui Bingyan in the hall, and knew that Shui Bingyan did not manage to cultivate Bones out of the pellet.

"There are still nine pills here, take them!" Chen Xiang refined five pills, Feng Yujie refined four.

"It will definitely work this time!" Yue’er and Shui Bingyan then entered the secret room.
