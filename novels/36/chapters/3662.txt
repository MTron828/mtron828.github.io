Chen Xiang sat on the ground and looked at the beautiful face of the Tao-creation’s crystal mother and said: "It’s a deal then. We will start cooperating.

As long as the Tao-creation’s Crystal Mother could help him find enough of the Tao-creation’s Divine Crystals, once he refined it into the Tao-creation’s Divine Bead, he would be able to quickly open the formation disc and access the Initial Evil-creation Realm.

"How can I trust you? You don’t seem to be very reliable, although you have Chuangxie key, your cultivation does not seem to be very high. " Tao-creation’s crystal mother said.

"My cultivation base is not high, but I can catch you. This is skill!" All the trash who were chasing you previously all possess a higher cultivation than me, but in the end, you still ended up in my hands. " Chen Xiang said.

The Tao-creation’s crystal mother was unwilling to accept this. She coldly snorted and said, "Are you saying that I can’t even compare to you?"

Chen Xiang nodded seriously: "Yes, otherwise, you wouldn’t have been captured by me! Right now, you have no other choice, you can only choose to cooperate with me. If you don’t cooperate with me, you can only die with me in this Tao-creation Place. Do you want to die? "

"I don’t want to die. Although I’ve lived for many years, I still haven’t lived enough!" Tao-creation’s Crystal Mother immediately replied: "Alright, I have no other ways now, I can only temporarily cooperate with you, you little brat, don’t play any tricks in front of me, otherwise I will kill you."

The tone of the Tao-creation’s crystal mother was filled with threat, but Chen Xiang was not scared, and laughed: "Big sister, since I’m afraid of you, I definitely won’t play any tricks. Big Sis, you must have a name at least, right? "

"Jing Yun’er!" The crystal mother snorted in a small voice before looking at the strange expression on Chen Xiang’s face. She bared her teeth as she said, "Do you think that name is funny?"

"This... I just don’t think I’m right with you. " Chen Xiang laughed dryly.

Jing Yun’er scolded angrily, "That’s right, this is all the crappy name that the old turtle in Tao-creation Divine Lord gave me. If I meet him, I will definitely beat him up."

Jing Yun’er had a lot of resentment towards the First Tao-creation Ancestor s, because they were the ones who brought her here back then, and she was suddenly responsible for nurturing a large amount of Tao-creation’s divine crystals.

"Elder sister, how did you get the Tao-creation’s Holy Crystal? You actually made so much? " Chen Xiang had always been curious about this matter, and it all depended on Jing Yun’er alone.

"That’s my innate ability, I can absorb the energy in this world and then release a type of energy that can turn into crystals through my body. I normally hide in some big mountains, and after releasing a bit of energy, that mountain will become the Tao-creation’s Holy Crystal." Jing Yun’er’s tone now was much better. Perhaps it was because he had told Chen Xiang his name, but in order to make it seem like his name and that of his, she had calmed down a lot.

"If you really hate those First Tao-creation Ancestor, you don’t have to go to the Crystal Forming!" Chen Xiang said: "Isn’t this my revenge against them?"

"No way! If I don’t crystallize, then there will be no energy in this Myriad Tao era. The energy released by the Tao-creation’s Holy Crystal will circulate once it is released, and I will also need to absorb this energy myself. " Jing Yun’er said, "If I don’t crystallize, there will be no energy and I won’t be able to absorb it. I will die."

So Jing Yun’er was forced to do this, no wonder she had a stomach full of grievances. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

"What if we go to the Initial Evil-creation Realm?" Chen Xiang asked: "If you enter inside, will you die?"

"Of course not. There is energy everywhere and I feel a lot of energy. As long as I go to another world and feel some energy, I will not die." Jing Yun’er said.

"Big Sis, how about you enter my Divine Sense Sea World and condense your crystals inside?" Chen Xiang suddenly had a strange thought and said anxiously.

"No, your energy is too weak for me to absorb. When I absorb energy, it’s very scary." Jing Yun’er said: "I’m still storing a large portion of the energy in my body, so I should be able to last until I reach the Initial Evil-creation Realm."

Chen Xiang shook his head, the existence of this Jing Yun’er was truly too mysterious.

"Can you take me to the Tao-creation’s Divine Crystal Mine now?" Chen Xiang asked. The Tao-creation’s Holy Crystals here were all created by Jing Yun’er, it was just that they were originally exploded out of the seven Tao-creation Mountain s.

"Once I leave, they will detect me. So, you need to be careful not to get caught by them." Jing Yun’er looked at Chen Xiang, and said with a frown: "Have your injuries healed yet? Is it about to start now? "

"It’s almost done." Chen Xiang nodded, "We will begin now."

Xiao Xianglin and Feng Ke’er came out of the You Yao Mountain Villa, and under Jing Yun’er’s curious inquiry, she found out that Xiao Xianglin was originally Chen Xiang’s master, and Feng Ke’er was also not Chen Xiang’s daughter.

Jing Yun’er still liked the cute little girl very much, so he couldn’t help but pinch her a few times.

After Xiao Xianglin and Feng Ke’er put away the seal, Jing Yun’er and Chen Xiang immediately left the Six Realms mirrors.

"Big sister, you helped me find the Tao-creation’s Divine Crystal Mines, they shouldn’t be in those guys’ territory, they found quite a few of them, if it’s a large scale mine, there will definitely be some strong warriors guarding it." Chen Xiang said, "It would be best to find one that no one has discovered."

"That’s simple. Let me sense it. It’ll be quick!" After Jing Yun’er closed his eyes, he quickly sensed it. Then, he hurriedly gave Chen Xiang a direction, allowing him to fly over for the time being.

"These guys are really fast." Jing Yun’er scolded when she sensed the fluctuations in space. Then, Chen Xiang quickly placed her into the Six Realms mirrors and let Xiao Xianglin and Feng Ke’er temporarily seal her in a spatial enchantment.

Chen Xiang controlled his Six Realms mirrors to fly quickly, and the moment he flew, he produced a bolt of lightning from the spatial ripple a moment ago.

Chen Xiang’s Six Realms mirrors flew very fast and teleported. Inside the Six Realms mirrors, Jing Yun’er could see what was happening outside. She told Chen Xiang the shape of a huge mountain and that he would be able to find it as long as he saw it.

Several hours later, Chen Xiang finally found the mountain. It was relatively huge, and he could see it from afar.

"Big Sister Yun, how do you usually choose these mountains to turn into crystals?" Chen Xiang asked.

"It depends on your mood!" Jing Yun’er said: "Wherever we go, my mood will be better. I will be going in for a while, and then that mountain will become a mine, and after it becomes the Tao-creation’s Holy Crystal, this mine will release a weak energy. Countless mines will release their energy at the same time, and after that, the energy will flow into all the realms, nourishing all living things in all realms, releasing energy from all realms. This kind of energy will flow back here, and it will be extremely huge, and it can be said that there will be a steady flow of energy."

"It’s just that you can’t feel this kind of energy. Only I can sense it, so I can absorb this energy and turn the mine into a crystal!" But now that all realms have left the Tao-creation Place and the energy cycles released by all realms have not come back to me, the amount of energy that I have absorbed is pitifully small. "
