Although Feng Wu had entered the inner sect, she had missions, so she had to hunt Special god beast right now. If she went in from the outer sect like her, she would need to do this kind of labor for a long period of time! Although her reputation was like a trial, she was actually just a thug.

But true disciples who were born and bred in the inner sect rarely had such dangerous’ experiential learning ’. Most of their time was spent inside the inner sect cultivating; at most, they would improve their combat experience through combat!

After Feng Wu left, Chen Xiang also started to hunt Special god beast s. With Huang Jintian and Huang Yantian’s help, he could quickly gather a hundred of those beads. At that time, he would be able to enter the inner sect to take a look.

In the blink of an eye, half a year of busy work had gone by. Chen Xiang was currently taking the corpses of ten Special god beast s to hand over.

"I’ll be taking the examination soon!" Chen Xiang passed a very big Storage bag to the old man, and said while laughing.

"To be able to gather enough within half a year, someone must have secretly helped you!" Even though the old man said that, his face still carried a smile: "Actually, it doesn’t matter if someone helps. In any case, what we earn are our Everlasting Mountain s, as 100 Special god beast s, is equivalent to 100 billion Shen Yuan stone. Just with your contribution points, it’s much better than those inner sect disciples! Those bastards, they only know how to consume, they never know how to earn Shen Yuan stone! "

"Clan Elder, why is this happening? In other words, isn’t cultivating those inner disciples a piece of cake? " Chen Xiang asked curiously, the majority of Everlasting Mountain’s resources were provided by the outer sect disciples.

"Indeed, that’s why the price increase came out of seclusion. At that time, the new rules will be set, and the good days of those brats will be over." The old man laughed: "There’s no problem with these ten Special god beast, here!"

"Your strength is not weak, and you can already earn a large amount of Shen Yuan stone. Why did you still have to suffer humiliation in the inner sect? Although you can get a lot of powerful * * * * *, from the looks of it, you probably don’t need that * * *! Did he come for the supreme dan bead? The most convenient thing to do in the inner sect was to have an outstanding pill god to help you refine a divine pill. The Dan God Institute s of the inner sect of our Everlasting Mountain s are the stronger out of the big powers. "

Chen Xiang laughed: "I am indeed heading towards that Dan God Institute, I need the divine pellets now." This was indeed the reason why he entered the inner sect.

... ....

After collecting all one hundred of those beads, Chen Xiang immediately ran towards the gigantic Myriad God Mountain. There was a cave at the bottom of the mountain where he could participate in the examination.

After Chen Xiang entered, it was very quiet. After all, the threshold to participate in the examination was very high, and it wasn’t something that many people could participate in every day.

Upon seeing Chen Xiang, a small old man’s eyes immediately lit up: "Young man, are you here to participate in the assessment? Come here! "

Chen Xiang anxiously walked over, there was only a table in the cave, and the old man was sitting on top of it, smiling with his legs crossed.

"I’m participating in the examination, here is my jade token!" Chen Xiang handed over his jade tablet, and then another box. Inside the box were a hundred beads, and proof of killing a hundred Special god beast.

"Chen Xiang, hmm! He’s quite amazing. It’s already been half a year, so let’s start the examination now! Do you need time to prepare? " The old man asked. At the moment, he looked more excited than Chen Xiang, but it seemed like he was too bored here. He finally had something to take care of.

"Let’s start now!" Chen Xiang only came to report after resting for a day.

"Alright, as long as you kill a Holy level Special god beast, you will pass the examination! This shouldn’t be difficult for you! " The old man smiled and said, "I will bring you over and personally supervise you. This is only if you personally kill me."

"Holy level Special god beast?" Chen Xiang asked: How strong is it?

"The one with eighty Divine Deity is the Holy level Special god beast, the one with ninety Divine Deity is the king level Special god beast, and the one with one Hundred gods level is the emperor level Special god beast, the strongest one!" The old man said, "Since you can hunt a hundred and seventy Divine Deity Special god beast, your own strength is definitely not weak, so you should be able to complete it."

"Oh, then take me with you right now, I want to quickly enter the inner sect!" Chen Xiang only saw Feng Wu once a month. After Feng Wu entered the inner sect, there was almost no time. He spent the entire day hunting Special god beast, and sometimes even went to the Earth-stage Stars or other Heaven-stage Stars s.

Star Law Divine Realm was so big, but there were so many of them that it was almost impossible to kill all of them.

The old man brought Chen Xiang out of the cave, and walked towards the Transmitting Square!

"Elder, do you not need to stay in the cave? What if someone comes to take the test? " Chen Xiang asked.

"If he really wants to take the examination, he will be waiting for me there! "In fact, I knew in advance who would come to take the test. When you were collecting the ninety beads, I received news that no one would come during this period of time." The little old man brought Chen Xiang along to enter the Transmission array.

When the Transmission array opened, Chen Xiang and the old man were teleported to a city. The old man then took out a flying discs and flew away from the city with Chen Xiang in the blink of an eye.

An hour had passed, and the flying discs were flying very quickly. They were already far away from the city.

"There’s a Holy level Special god beast down there, go and lure it out!" The old man pointed at the huge hole in the ground.

This was a wasteland, so suddenly finding such a large hole in the ground was very abrupt. Moreover, it was emitting a strong aura, so it was not hard to discover that there was a strong Special god beast below.

"Hurry up and go! Even if you kill them, you’ll be able to pass the test and become an inner court disciple!" "However, hehe, if you enter the inner sect then you will be sick of doing this kind of thing." The old man laughed.

"I’ll go right now!" Chen Xiang flew towards the hole. He did not know what kind of Special god beast there was, but he was not afraid.

Chen Xiang had already reached the top of the hole. The old man sitting on top of the Frisbee took out a jug of wine and drank it, then laughed: "This guy has arranged for all of the Special god beast s to be pretty complicated. I think we’ll need to fight for a while."

"Come out!" A flame condensed in Chen Xiang’s palm and shot into the big hole.

A series of muffled rumbling sounds came from below the cave, followed by a burst of sharp hisses and piercing screams, which made Chen Xiang feel very uncomfortable.

"It’s the God Piercing Mountain Beast!" Yue’er said: "This guy’s voice is very unpleasant. If it’s a Holy level Special god beast, then this guy is pretty strong, but it’s nothing to you." Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The earth started shaking as a rodent-like giant beast suddenly crawled out of a hole in the ground. Its body was covered in thick, barbed armor, and these armor pieces were like fish fins that could slide.

The armor pieces of the Mountain Penetrating Divine Beast all stood up, and after screaming at Chen Xiang, the black lance like spikes suddenly flew out densely from above.
