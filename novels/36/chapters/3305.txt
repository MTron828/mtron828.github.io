The Ancient Fire Divine Sect was very mysterious and had disappeared mysteriously all those years ago. Such a powerful sect, even if it was destroyed, would definitely leave many valuable things behind. That was why the Fierce Saber Race and the Fierce Saber Race came here so quickly.

After Chen Xiang and Qin Shuang found out that the Ancient Fire Divine Sect was here, they were extremely worried that they would be found by the Fierce Saber Race. ○

Even if the Ancient Fire Divine Sect was in ruins, there were definitely many hidden treasures. If the Soul River Divine Race and the others were to occupy this place, they would become even stronger.

The World Defying holy dragon was still at that place, so he didn’t want to run around anymore. He just wanted to wait and see what the Fierce Saber Race and the Fierce Saber Race would do, and see how they would find things in the Blood Wind Fire Sea.

"Senior Holy Dragon, do you know of Ancient Fire Divine Sect?" When Chen Xiang saw the World Defying holy dragon, he immediately called out to it.

After the World Defying holy dragon heard, she asked in shock: "Of course I know, how did you know about the Ancient Fire Divine Sect? The Ancient Fire Divine Sect disappeared a long time ago, and there was no news of it afterwards. Very few people knew of the existence of the Ancient Fire Divine Sect. "

"And my master is a disciple of the Ancient Fire Divine Sect!"

The owner of the World Defying holy dragon was actually also a disciple of the Ancient Fire Divine Sect!

Chen Xiang told the World Defying holy dragon what he had overheard from the Bloody Wind Island, which made the World Defying holy dragon feel extremely surprised. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

"Gu Tong, this master refiner is actually from the Ancient Fire Divine Sect, and I have been together with my master for a long time. I have rarely heard him mention the Ancient Fire Divine Sect, and I do not know much about it. The World Defying holy dragon said: "That means the Ancient Fire Divine Sect is inside the Blood Wind Fire Sea, but I have been here for so many years, yet I did not know that there is a Ancient Fire Divine Sect here."

"Has the Ancient Fire Divine Sect been destroyed?" The disciples of the Ancient Fire Divine Sect were all extremely powerful. The Super Yang Old Ancestor, Gu Tong and the master of the World Defying holy dragon were all disciples of the Ancient Fire Divine Sect, so it was obvious how powerful the Ancient Fire Divine Sect was.

If Ancient Fire Divine Sect was a very large sect, then there would definitely be more disciples powerful inside, but to have such a strong sect be destroyed, Chen Xiang could not believe it.

"It shouldn’t have been destroyed!" The World Defying holy dragon said: "It just mysteriously disappeared! If such a powerful sect like the Ancient Fire Divine Sect were to be destroyed, then the destructive power of the Ancient Fire Divine Sect would have already dominated the entire Myriad Tao. "

"Maybe it’s because of some reasons that the Ancient Fire Divine Sect had no choice but to hide inside the Blood Wind Fire Sea. Maybe this Blood Wind Fire Sea is the barrier of the Ancient Fire Divine Sect, and only they have the power to create this kind of barrier." World Defying holy dragon’s deduction was not without reason.

The blood flame here was extremely strong, and only the middle and late stage of World Defying Stage could barely defend against it. The World Defying holy dragon’s body was extremely strong, and because of that and his strength, he could easily defend against the blood fire here.

"Senior Sheng Long, those guys are planning to capture you. You should hurry up and run!" Qin Shuang said, "If we can use the dragon’s scale to find you, they can too."

Previously, they had told the World Defying holy dragon that the people of Fierce Saber Race and Soul River Divine Race wanted to capture him as their mount and brought them here to find the Ancient Fire Divine Sect.

"Alright, I will leave this place now, but I will also go find Ancient Fire Divine Sect!" The World Defying holy dragon continued: "The Blood Wind Fire Sea is very vast. I stayed here for a very long time, but still couldn’t find the Ancient Fire Divine Sect ... I suspect that the Ancient Fire Divine Sect is protected by a strong barrier, which is why I was not able to discover it while I was in the air. "

Even if one were to look down from the sky, there was only a sea of fire below him, so even if there was a barrier, it would be impossible to discover it.

"Alright, we’ll take a look around as well." Chen Xiang nodded.

"If I find anything, I’ll release my power and make the dragon scale in your hand flash. When that time comes, you’ll come and find me." The World Defying holy dragon said.

Chen Xiang took out the dragon’s scale, and hung it on a thread around his neck. This way, if the dragon’s scale flickered, he would be able to detect it immediately.

After the World Defying holy dragon flew away, Chen Xiang and Qin Shuang also ran wildly in the sea of flames. They didn’t know where the Ancient Fire Divine Sect was, so they could only rely on their luck to find it. Just like the World Defying holy dragon said, if the Ancient Fire Divine Sect was really hiding here, then there would be a barrier around them.

"If you want to find a barrier, then let me do it!" Feng Ke’er laughed.

"Are you sure you can find it?" Chen Xiang asked, after which he controlled the Six Realms mirrors and released even more power to defend against the blood flame.

The formation plate to defend against the blood fire was discovered by the Purple Yang Divine Palace, it was something left behind by the Super Yang Old Ancestor. Now, Chen Xiang and Qin Shuang finally understood why the Super Yang Old Ancestor had such a thing.

"Perhaps this blood flame was released from a barrier ... If there really is a barrier here, then this barrier will more or less absorb the power of the outside world. Even if it does not, it will release a type of energy that will sense the changes in the outside world and then adjust the strength of the defense. " Feng Ke’er said, "Generally speaking, a very strong barrier will not only provide a fixed amount of energy, it will also absorb a bit of the energy from the outside world to reduce the energy consumption."

"So, I need to check if there are any signs of the energy being absorbed by the barrier." Feng Ke’er said: "I need you to bring me around."

"Alright!" Chen Xiang nodded.

"Don’t worry. If there is any trouble, I will definitely do my best to protect her." Qin Shuang said, she knew Feng Ke’er’s strength was not very strong.

Chen Xiang and Qin Shuang very carefully brought Feng Ke’er everywhere as they ran. Every once in a while, they would stop for a while.

"Did you find anything?" Chen Xiang asked.

"Of course!" Feng Ke’er sighed: "There is an invisible web here, this web was formed from countless World Defying Stage Fierce Power s connecting together, this web is covering the land and crazily absorbing the energy of the land, I have just discovered this web, if I could find the direction of this web, then I would be able to find the source of the energy."

"The source is Ancient Fire Divine Sect?" Chen Xiang asked.

"I can’t guarantee it. In short, the source devours a lot of energy every second of the day." Feng Ke’er said, "This energy web is extremely mysterious, even if we destroy a portion of it, the other parts would still be absorbing energy, and the damaged parts would also slowly repair themselves. This is a very mystical way of absorbing energy."

"I’m guessing that there’s a spirit at the source, something similar to me. They are all created by spirit formations like seals. Right now, he is in charge of absorbing energy." Feng Ke’er said: "When I was still the spirit body of the Sealing Array, I did this."
