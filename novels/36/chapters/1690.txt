Going to Divine Fire Forest was not easy, and after going there, they would need to extract a large amount of Space black iron s from a large amount of rocks, and it would take some time to refine them.

"We’ll talk about it when we get to Divine Fire Forest." Chen Xiang stood outside the window and looked at the beautiful snowy scenery outside: "It’s snowing in Cold Wind Forest, the wind is a lot lighter."

"Old Jiang, can this boat of yours help me get rid of the Hell Devil Emperor’s Tracing mantra? If we can’t, then it will be very troublesome for us along the way. The experts in the Cold Wind Forest have already found out about the three Divine Deity rewards, I’m afraid there will be even more powerful beings joining us next."

Jiang Sheng shook his head: "No, if it was possible, I would have used it long ago. If there were enough Space black iron s inside, I could transform them into a strong spatial energy by absorbing the Holy Spirit’s power from within the Holy stone, and it would produce a strong spatial isolation force. With the effect of being separated from the outside space, the Tracing mantra will not be able to trace you back.

Long Xueyi asked: "Little Scoundrel, the spatial energy that you have grasped right now isn’t enough to isolate you from this space. This way, you won’t have to worry about the Tracing mantra."

Chen Xiang shook his head: "I tried a few times, but none of them worked, unless I entered into a tyrannical space. It seems that I have not mastered the spatial laws to a sufficient degree, and still need to unearth some power."

"Chen Xiang, I brought out this boat. It’s about time you tell me how you got here." Jiang Sheng was very curious about this matter.

Qi Shi said, "Stone Element Poison is one of the rarest poisons, and the number of times it has appeared is very few. Even now, no one knows how this poison was produced."

"Oh right, there’s also the antidote. It doesn’t seem to be extracted from plants. What exactly is it?"

Long Xueyi laughed: "I can tell you the answer. Little Pearl, Little Peacock, come out."

Pearl and Kong Bailing immediately came out of the Serenity Ring, and in an instant, another two beauties of varying sizes appeared in the hall.

The pearl was relatively small in size, and a beautiful smile hung on her face. The purple dress she wore made her look even more beautiful.

Kong Bailing, who was afraid of living, was a little restrained, but she still politely revealed a sweet smile. Her head was covered with white feathers, giving her a unique and proud kind of beauty.

The two of them, along with Long Xueyi and Dongfang Xinyue, these four beauties stood by Chen Xiang’s side, causing both Qi Shi and Jiang Sheng to secretly despise him.

This is the little peacock, the feathers on her body can produce the poison of heaven and earth, this is the little pearl, her pearl tears have a very good detoxifying effect, as their strength increases, they will become even more powerful in the future. They are my people, so don’t try to harm them. Long Xueyi looked at Qi Shi and Jiang Sheng with a threatening gaze.

They had heard of the famous names of the Ten Heavens Supreme Lord and Divine Craftsmen. Back then, they had stirred up a storm in the nine heavens, and even some of their legends were spread around in these Endless Heaven Realm.

"The strange fossil poison actually came from a living creature’s body." With his and Qi Shi’s eyesight, how could they not see Pearl and Kong Bailing’s true body?

"This little pearl has been growing for at least a hundred thousand years. It seems like it’s not small at all. Pearls of this level are very rare." Qi Shi sized up the pearl for a moment, then looked at Kong Bailing again, "The White Peacock’s feathers are filled with the rarest, strange fossil poison from Super Old poison s.

Long Xueyi saw the curious look in Qi Shi and Jiang Sheng’s eyes, and laughed: "Don’t scare me like that, is there anything else you want to ask?

"Can’t we just sit outside? Wouldn’t it be boring to hide inside the Storage magic treasure?" Qi Shi asked.

"Of course not, it’s fun inside." As long as there was food to eat, Long Xueyi would not feel bored at all. The reason she could stay inside for so long was because there were a lot of delicious things to eat.

Jiang Sheng just wanted to say a few words, when he suddenly frowned: "There are so many birds outside, to be able to fly in this kind of cold place, they are definitely not ordinary birds."

Everyone immediately looked out of the window and saw a large number of white birds flying in the sky. These birds were not dense, only the figures of these birds could be seen from all directions.

"They are looking for something. Someone should be leading them. Can you bring one in? I can figure out what they are looking for." Kong Bailing said. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Just as he finished speaking, Jiang Sheng ran out. In a few blinks of an eye, he returned with a few of these white birds.

Kong Bailing carefully held the bird in his hands, caressed it a few times, and then closed his eyes.

"In their minds, they have the images of the Elder Brother Shen ... this is here to find the Elder Brother Shen. " Kong Bailing frowned.

"These birds should all be spirit birds with a spirit surname. They should have a lot of memories. Can you tell us more about things like who controlled them?" Qi Shi asked.

Kong Bailing nodded: "I’ll try."

After a while, Kong Bailing opened her eyes and used the power of the Holy Spirit to draw an image out of thin air.

"This guy is Eagle Emperor." Long Xueyi pointed to a man in black robes: "I don’t recognize the other two."

Kong Bailing pointed to the white robed man beside the Eagle Emperor: "The bird said that this is a guy who’s as powerful as the Eagle Emperor, and he’s also very famous in this place. His name is Evil Emperor Xuan Han, and he’s an extremely powerful Strong of Lord Stage who uses profoundhan poison.

Chen Xiang laughed coldly: "This time, we must get rid of this Eagle Emperor. He had previously teamed up with other Strong of Lord Stage s, and is probably being abandoned now.

Long Xueyi looked at Jiang Sheng and Qi Shi: "Can the two of you fight?"

"If we have enough pearl tears, I believe that we should not have any problems. Merely, I do not wish to fight them face to face. After all, they all use a lot of poison." Jiang Sheng said.

Qi Shi looked relaxed, and laughed: "Old Jiang, this ship is not bad, at least they do not know Chen Xiang’s exact location, in that case, it would be more convenient for us to ambush them."

Long Xueyi said: "Alright then, wait a moment, I’ll see if I can make a move in secret."

Dongfang Xinyue, Pearl and Kong Bailing were not strong enough, they could only enter the ring.

"I’ll go out and attract their attention. You guys can take this opportunity to attack." Chen Xiang left the cabin and went inside his Youyao ring, waiting for the right time to make a move.
