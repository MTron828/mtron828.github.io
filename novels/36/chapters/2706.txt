Chen Xiang rushed towards Hu Luo, very quickly grabbing onto Hu Luo, and threw him into the Chuangshi god furnace. Then, he turned into a rock, rolled down the mountain along with the other messy rocks.

He was not afraid that the two elders would go back and tell Western Tiger Mountain Villa.

When Western Tiger Mountain Villa did such a thing, it was already wrong to do it in the first place. If this matter were to spread, Western Tiger Mountain Villa’s reputation would also be bad.

"We’re in trouble now. The Young Manor Lord has been taken away by that guy. What should we do now?" An old man frowned, his face full of worry.

"Go back and find the manor lord first. Check if the young manor lord’s life orb is still intact. If it has already shattered ..." We have to plan for the worst. "

"Do we really have to go back? If the Young Villa Master’s life orb shatters, we might not be able to leave. Or perhaps, just by joining the Heavenly Dao Sect, I will not be able to return to Western Tiger Mountain Villa. "

They were both old followers of the Western Tiger Mountain Villa’s Villa Master, so their status in the Western Tiger Mountain Villa was not very high. Furthermore, they were now in charge of protecting Hu Luo.

If Hu Luo died, their fate would be very serious, so they didn’t dare go back right now.

"Even if we go to the Heavenly Law School, we will be in for a lot of trouble. If Western Tiger Mountain Villa finds out that we are in the Heavenly Law Sect, he would definitely not let us off."

"We will just hide our identities inside the Tian Dao Sect while disguising ourselves. As for today’s incident, we will just stay silent, the Western Tiger Mountain Villa shouldn’t be able to find us, just treat it as us and the Young Villa Master disappearing."

"Alright, that’s my decision."

After that, the two elders left the mountain and Chen Xiang arrived at the foot of the mountain. She dragged her injured body and carefully returned to the Myriad Tao City.

When he returned to the Mei Jing Store, it was already dawn. Chen Xiang had released Jiang Simei from his secret underground room.

"How’s your injury?" Jiang Simei saw that Chen Xiang’s face was ugly and asked anxiously.

It’s not bad, I didn’t manage to injure Divine Sense Sea, but her body was heavily injured so she will be able to recover after a while, don’t worry about me, what about you, are you alright now? Chen Xiang laughed and asked.

"I’m fine now. It’s all my fault for being too careless and not being on guard." Jiang Simei said as he blamed himself, "I will definitely be careful in the future."

Chen Xiang nodded, took out his Chuangshi god furnace and released Hu Luo who was inside. Hu Luo had not been killed yet, but he had also suffered quite a few injuries, and currently, he was lying on the ground in pain.

"This is the bastard." When Jiang Simei saw that she was thrown out, she was immediately enraged and stomped on Hu Luo fiercely.

Furthermore, Jiang Simei had purposely stepped in the middle of Hu Luo’s legs, causing him to scream miserably.

"Spare me, I won’t dare to do it again." He had never thought that not only would Chen Xiang be able to save Jiang Simei, he would also be able to capture him. Until now, he still could not understand what methods Chen Xiang had used.

Chen Xiang also went over to ravage Hu Luo ruthlessly. Such a fellow actually wanted to take him in as a servant and even used Jiang Simei to threaten him, causing him to get injured right now.

Hu Luo took turns to be beaten up by Jiang Simei and Chen Xiang. Not only was he resentful, he was also filled with fear.

"This guy is the young master of the Western Tiger Mountain Villa, his grandfather is the master of the Western Tiger Mountain Villa, his father’s strength is also not bad." Jiang Simei said.

"Then how should we deal with him and kill him?" Chen Xiang said. They had let out their anger, but did not know whether to kill Hu Luo or not.

"Hmph, of course we have to kill this guy. If we let him go back this time, we will be in even greater trouble in the future." Jiang Simei’s face was gloomy and cold, "Such an evil and soft bastard, letting him stay in this world is practically committing sin."

"Don’t... There will never be a next time. " Hu Luo pleaded for mercy, but a fierce look flashed past his eyes, which was seen clearly by Jiang Simei and Chen Xiang.

Chen Xiang had already taken out the Heavenly magic sword, but Jiang Simei had already made his move. With a flash of red light, the red curved blade in Jiang Simei’s hand chopped out, and cut off Hu Luo’s head.

"Go to hell, motherfucker." Jiang Simei waved his hand and released a ball of black air. The black air enveloped Hu Luo’s body and ignited into black flames.

"This is ..." "The fire of death?" Chen Xiang asked in surprise.

"Not yet, it’s just a flame with a little power of death. If I could use the true power of death, I wouldn’t be captured by this bastard." Jiang Simei said, she was also a decisive woman, especially after being taken away, causing Chen Xiang to be severely injured, she would not show any mercy when facing her enemies.

Chen Xiang kept all of these things into the Chuangshi god furnace s for purification and then sat cross-legged on the ground for treatment.

"Oh yeah, the two old men escaped, worried that they would return to the Western Tiger Mountain Villa." This was what Chen Xiang was more worried about right now. Although the two elders went to the Heavenly Dao Sect, it was hard to say whether or not they would spread the news to the Western Tiger Mountain Villa.

"We trust Senior Tai so much. It would be best for us to discuss this matter with them and let them prepare." Jiang Simei said: "Eastern Dragon Mountain Villa is the strongest out of the few villas, they aren’t afraid of Western Tiger Mountain Villa."

"Alright, now that things have come to this, we can only do it. They should be coming today to take a walk. When the time comes, you can go and discuss it with them. I’ll heal up first."

Chen Xiang was only injured in the flesh right now, but by using the Primitive Tao Power, he could quickly recover from his injuries.

... ....

Seven days later, Chen Xiang had already recovered from his injuries and refined twenty thousand Tianhun gold Dan.

He walked out of the secret room and anxiously went to look for Jiang Simei. He was worried that something would happen to Jiang Simei. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

"How are you doing?" Jiang Simei was in her room, but when she knocked, she immediately opened the door and asked.

"It’s done, I even refined twenty thousand Tianhun gold Dan." Chen Xiang laughed.

"It was really a waste to throw away those twenty thousand Tianhun gold Dan previously." Jiang Simei couldn’t help but sigh as he thought about it. He had only lost her because he wanted to save her.

"It’s nothing compared to a beauty like you, twenty thousand Tianhun gold Dan are nothing." Chen Xiang snickered.

Jiang Simei scoffed, and then pulled Chen Xiang into the room.

"I’ve already told the two seniors about that." Jiang Simei said: "They feel that this matter is more serious, and they have already sent people to investigate the reaction of the Western Tiger Mountain Villa, they will tell us when the results come."

"Looks like you have to hurry up and train to become a Death Rule Dao line, you still lack 15 Law beads. Right now, we have enough Dao crystal." Chen Xiang said, he already had more than three hundred million Dao crystal in his hands.

Even if he were to use one hundred and fifty million to buy the Law beads, he would still have nearly two hundred million.

"Alright, I’ll go now." Jiang Simei said.

"Don’t go out during this period of time. I’m worried that another accident will happen to you. We’ll talk about it when you’re able to cultivate the Death Rule Dao line." Chen Xiang immediately stopped Jiang Simei.
