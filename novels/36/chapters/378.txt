CHAPTER 379: INHERITANCE

Chen Xiang had fled, and yet he was here. Was he not just seeking death? After all, he had angered a crowd of powerful experts. What made everyone puzzled was that Chen Xiang was back, but he was not stupid, so definitely there must be a reason.

Thereupon, Lan Hai and others quickly came over and surrounded Chen Xiang. They all furiously stared at Chen Xiang, they all had been ruthlessly ridiculed by Huang Jintian, especially Lan Hai, he had been even treated a stupid big pig. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Chen Xiang looked all calm and composed, dismissively said, “Seniors, I just went to ease myself, that’s all, there is no need to make a fuss.”

Went to ease himself? Just because he went to the bathroom, all the experts of various mainlands were anxious like ants on a hot wok, and most of them had almost suffered internal injuries from anger.

However, everyone didn’t believe his nonsense. Chen Xiang had escaped, and now he was back, just because there was some reason.

And obviously, Chen Xiang suddenly disappeared and appeared, such a trick was ingenious, which made everyone marvel again and again in their heart.

“Why are you like this! If I wanted to escape, I definitely can, hadn’t my teacher still not acted!” Chen Xiang said with a smile.

His indifferent appearance was making hundreds of Nirvana Realm martial artists furious, but his calmness also showed his courage.

Certainly, if someone had a teacher like Huang Jintian, who would not be fearless?

“Alright, to tell you the truth, I had originally escaped, but when I thought of getting hunt down by you day and night, I didn’t feel very well! First of all, the Tai Chi Subduing Dragon Exercise was given to me by my teacher, as soon as I thought about this, I realized I don’t have any obligation to teach you! And you relied on your strength, forced the Extreme Martial Sect to hand me over to you, and forced me to give you the Tai Chi Subduing Dragon Exercise, you don’t have a little bit of morality and justice.” Chen Xiang looked at everyone with contempt.

“So do you think, that you will come back and speak these words, we will let you go?” Lan Hai coldly said.

“Hey, the Tai Chi Subduing Dragon Exercise is mine, I’m not going to hand it over to you, what can you do? In order to seize my martial exercise, tookhundreds of Nirvana Realm martial artists like you are going to collectively force me? I know, at present, I don’t have any strength, I am a soft persimmon, you can crush me whenever you so wish! If I was as powerful as my teacher, I would not have just wounded you, I would have killed all of you. You hypocritical lots are violating laws of martial arts way, you are definitely going to die under the Nirvana Tribulation!”

At this time, Chen Xiang was a little angry.

“You...” Lan Hai was extremely furious, the same was true for the others. But under Gu Dongchen’s gaze, they endured and didn’t take any action.

“Frankly speaking, since you came today to grab my martial exercise, no wonder you who are from the same era as my teacher are unable to ascend to Heavenly Realm. In this regard, my teacher is a mile ahead of you. In the first place, my teacher had the absolute strength to kill you, but he didn’t and let you keep your life! At that time, with my teacher’s strength, if he so wished, he could have dominated the entire mortal world, yet he didn’t and even choose to imprison himself in that damn place. That was because he had seen through everything, although he was insane, he is a hundred times, no a thousand times better than you!”

“Now, you, not only didn’t thank my teacher, you hate him as an old man. Don’t forget, at that time, it was you who wanted to rob him of his martial exercise at first, it was you who was wrong. Only because you lots gather together, courageously, believing you were right, have you acted like that. At that time, if my teacher had killed you, it would have been as just as the heaven and the earth.”

Chen Xiang swept a glance over those Nirvana Realm martial artists, looking at them without any ounce of emotion; in his heart, he was secretly proud.

Lan Hai was rendered speechless. They were indeed wrong. Now, if they did the same as before, they would be following the wrong path again. They were now reflecting on what they did to determine whether or not they were truly wrong!

“Forget it, in any case, it was all because of my teacher that you didn’t come to help Chenwu Mainland. So my teacher had no choice but to discuss with Gu Dongchen, and sell me over to you. Then, my teacher will save me, and finally, let me live a life of a fugitive.” Chen Xiang sighed and said.

“Alright, in the future, we are not going to ask you to hand over the Tai Chi Subduing Dragon Exercise again, we are also not going to hunt you down! From now on, I don’t have any grievances with you master and apprentice.” Lan Hai took a long deep breath, and loudly said.

Other Nirvana Realm martial artists also voiced the same opinion. They knew that this would continue forever—an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. And now that they have angered Chen Xiang, in the future, when Chen Xiang would become stronger, he would not be soft-hearted like Huang Jintian. From their understanding of Chen Xiang’s way of conduct, he was certainly not a good fruit to eat.

Chen Xiang smiled and said, “I will also not make everyone’s trip a wasted one. This is a map given to me by a senior. According to him, it leads to a place where the old men from 100,000 years ago had left their inheritances. They were afraid that the mortal world will fall, so they had stored their inheritances inside a mysterious realm.”

While speaking, Chen Xiang took out the map and having handed it over to Lan Hai, continued, “On the back of it is a secret array, you need to gather people to lay out the array to release its power, that way you will be able to open the entrance to the mysterious realm, as for the inside? According to senior, it is a bit dangerous, so he persuaded me to not go as I am not powerful enough.”

Lan Hai took over the map and carefully looked. From the material of the map, he was sure that it was really 100,000 years old, and the array diagram was also very rare and ancient. If the mysterious realm truly contained the inheritance from 100,000 years ago, then they can also have a prosperous and flourishing martial arts era like back in the day.

“Where did you meet that senior?” Lan Hai asked. Someone from 100,000 years ago who was still living was definitely marvelous.

“That senior is gone, after he handed me over the stuff, he ascended to the Heavenly Realm.” While speaking, Chen Xiang then described the scene when Bai Ziqian ascended to the Heavenly Realm, how an entrance was opened in the space, which actually made these experts truly believe that it was all true.

“I was originally planning to give it you today, but who knew that such things would happen! Although you can not acquire my Tai Chi Subduing Dragon Exercise, the things who will get can not be considered bad. Inside, maybe there are things left for you by your founding ancestors. And also it will all be your own things, you can cultivate with a peace of mind. Now, you don’t need to be concerned about Tai Chi Subduing Dragon Exercise.” Chen Xiang said with a smile.

Their own thing was the best. Everyone burst into praises! Chen Xiang had acquired this map, and rather than swallowing it alone, he had instead shared it with everyone. And when they thought of how they all wanted to find ways to make Chen Xiang hand over the Tai Chi Subduing Dragon Exercise, they felt ashamed!

They were all many, many times stronger than Chen Xiang, yet in this regard, they felt they were inferior to Chen Xiang. Now, when looking at Chen Xiang, the hatred in their eyes had already vanished, and what replaced was respect!

Chen Xiang in his heart was secretly taking pleasure. From the very beginning, this belonged to them, he was just handing it over, that’s all. These experts, who originally could not wait to tear him into pieces, were now feeling incessantly grateful to him instead. Nothing was better than learning the martial exercises and techniques left behind by their founding fathers, this kind of inheritance made them even more excited!

“This is actually located in the Kings’ Mainland. For a long time, I have been looking for it, but I couldn’t find it.” Lan Hai said. He passed the map over to Gu Dongchen.

Gu Dongchen smiled: “No need to worry, my Extreme Martial Sect’s Elder Wu is from the Kings’ Mainland. He knows how to go there, moreover, I will also take a trip to the Kings’ Mainland. To be honest, that place is the Holy Land of Martial Arts!”

Chen Xiang looked at the bald old man. Wu Canghong’s surname was “Wu”, are they related?

“In that case, after making some preparations, we will go to the Kings’ Mainland to retrieve these things. The Great Battle of Three Realms is about to start, we are far too lacking compared to the people from 100,000 years ago.” Lan Hai looking at the sky lightly sighed.
