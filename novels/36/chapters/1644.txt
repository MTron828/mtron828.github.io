Seeing the naughty smile on Feng Yujie’s face, Chen Xiang secretly cursed in his heart, this Feng Yujie was definitely doing this on purpose.

"Aunt Feng, isn’t your goddaughter a little too many?" Chen Xiang said snappily, "Are you doing this on purpose?"

Ji Ling’er and Hong Xia didn’t think that Feng Yujie would accept them as his goddaughter, nor did they think that his relationship with Feng Yujie would be so good. They only needed to casually recommend them to become the daughter of a Pill Saint.

Feng Yujie laughed and said: "What’s there to be proud about, it’s just that every time you bring girls here, they’re always this outstanding, I really like them. And it’s also because I trust you, I believe in your judgement, that’s why I took them as my foster daughters."

"I just don’t know if you’re willing to be my adopted daughter." Feng Yujie smiled sweetly at Hong Xia and Ji Ling’er. This beautiful Aunt Feng, with her mischievous and charming appearance, gave off a unique charm.

Of course and Hong Xia were willing, the two girls hurried over and held Feng Yujie’s arms, they chatted and laughed, and not long after, they became one. They did not look like mother and daughter at all, but they looked like sisters.

Although Chen Xiang had addressed Feng Yujie as Aunt Feng, she was not old at all. Even though her appearance was ordinary, she had a unique temperament, and would not lose out to her because she did not have a beautiful appearance.

"This old demoness isn’t simple. I didn’t notice before that she had actually changed her appearance. No, she must have used some sort of transformation technique. Now, we can see that her face isn’t her original appearance." Long Xueyi suddenly said: "This woman is too sinister, taking all the women by your side as her daughter, what will you do in the future? If you fall in love with her daughter, she will be your mother-in-law."

At this moment, Feng Yujie, Ji Ling’er and the others were laughing and joking at the side. Feng Yujie was originally a mischievous old demon, and Chen Xiang was very worried that she would lead and Red Cloud wild.

"Aunt Feng." Chen Xiang suddenly shouted with a serious expression, causing the three women to stop.

"What’s wrong?" Feng Yujie asked.

"Aunt Feng, they have already acknowledged you as their mother, and you and I are already so familiar with each other. Chen Xiang said righteously, as he really wanted to see Feng Yujie’s true appearance.

Feng Yujie laughed tenderly: "I didn’t think that you would still be able to tell, but I’m only showing it to my daughter, so I’ve already met You You You and Meiyao before."

After she finished speaking, she even mischievously stuck out her tongue at Chen Xiang, causing him to feel a little angry in his heart.

"Go back to work. I will teach my daughters how to refine pills." Feng Yujie laughed: "Don’t use any tricks to peek at me, it’s useless against me." UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Chen Xiang sighed gloomily and returned to the secret room.

"Why don’t I get you some of those pills and bring this Aunt Feng down, hehe ..." Long Xueyi laughed sinisterly.

"Don’t think that I’m that kind of person. I feel that this Aunt Feng is not as simple as a Pill Saint." Chen Xiang said: "Now that Divine Feather School is facing Super Holy School so easily, she must still have some tricks up her sleeve."

Long Xueyi said: "So you just need to leave the matter of dealing with the Super Holy School to her and the Yan Clan. You just need to prepare properly and go sell your pills in Yan City."

Chen Xiang had thought that Feng Yujie had Tier 7 immortal medicines, but Feng Yujie had told him that she had refined them a while ago, and they were extremely scarce now.

If Chen Xiang wanted to obtain it, he could only use a large number of Holy stone to purchase it, so he wanted to sell the pellets to earn the Holy stone.

In the past month, Chen Xiang had refined many low levelled immortal pills in the secret room, which was enough for him to support his image. After coming out from the secret room, he immediately went to look for Feng Yujie.

This month, Feng Yujie had always been very careful in guiding Red Cloud and Ji Ling’er in refining pills. Red Cloud and Ji Ling’er already had a very good foundation in terms of pills, and now that they had a very strong flame, it was easy for them to learn.

"What? You don’t have confidence in me? You’re worried that I won’t be able to teach them well." When Feng Yujie saw Chen Xiang asking all sorts of questions, it was as if he was testing Ji Ling’er and Red Cloud.

Chen Xiang laughed: "How could I dare doubt you, I just want you to teach them another method."

He injected the God purification and his many years of experience in pill refining into a pearl, it was equivalent to a type of inheritance.

"Aunt Feng, study carefully and see how you can combine your pill refining skills. After that, come up with a set of better methods to teach them." Chen Xiang passed the inheritance bead to Feng Yujie.

Feng Yujie had always been curious about Chen Xiang’s refining skills, she never thought that Chen Xiang would hand it over to her so easily.

"You trust me so much." Feng Yujie smiled charmingly.

"Yeah, it’s just that there are people who don’t trust me. They don’t even let me see their true appearances." Chen Xiang curled his lips and said, his voice carried resentment.

Feng Yujie laughed tenderly: "Why do you care so much about my looks?"

Chen Xiang said: "Who cares, I just want to see how you look like and why you don’t dare to use your true face."

"Actually, I’m doing this for your own good. I’m worried that you won’t be able to resist the temptation from me, and that it will affect you in the future, not because I’m narcissistic, but because I’m born with the same ability as the Mei Emperor back then. It’s just that she specializes in this aspect while I am a cultivator of the Dao of alchemy." Feng Yujie was serious, he did not seem to be fooling others.

"Is the Mei Emperor really that powerful? Just a glance at it would cause one to be enchanted. I don’t believe in evil." Chen Xiang was very confident in his control.

Ji Ling’er came to Chen Xiang’s side and said in a low voice: "It’s true. Mother’s power is really magical.

Red Cloud also quickly persuaded, "It’s better not to look. It’s really dangerous."

The more they said this, the more Chen Xiang wanted to see them.

Feng Yujie chuckled: "Actually, my face can only be shown to women. If a man sees it, most likely he’ll be in trouble."

Chen Xiang said: "Aunt Feng, you said that Mei Emperor’s ability is stronger than yours."

"That’s right, back then there were countless experts who were captivated by her, but only the Ten Heavens Supreme Lord, the wild beast, was fine, the rest of the Strong of Lord Stage had suffered, especially the Fire Emperor and the Ice Emperor, although they had that kind of relationship, but they still got along harmoniously, and that is all the power of the Mei Emperor."

Feng Yujie giggled: "If you want to prove that you’re really strong, then go and try out with the Mei Emperor and you’ll find out. I know how to find her."

Just like Long Xueyi had guessed, Feng Yujie was not simple as he knew many secrets of the Nine Heaven World from the past.

"How do I find her?" Chen Xiang was really not afraid of the Mei Emperor.

"She should be in Di Tian now. Take this. When you return to Di Tian, inject your God Power into this pearl and activate it. Then, she will come and find you." Feng Yujie tossed a white pearl to Chen Xiang: "Remember, if she acts against you, you can immediately crush this pearl and I can save you once. Otherwise the consequences will be severe."
