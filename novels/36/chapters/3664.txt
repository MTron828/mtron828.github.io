Jing Yun’er heard Chen Xiang’s question and fell silent. After a long while, she answered: "That is a possibility! Killing evil dragon is the existence they fear the most! "

"Why?" Chen Xiang could not understand: "Tao-creation Divine Lord can seal Killing evil dragon!"

"The terrifying thing about Killing evil dragon is not its power, but its mental influence! The way Killing evil dragon reproduce was very special ... As long as the living beings have evil thoughts, the spirit of the Killing evil dragon will germinate in the souls of these creatures. And when the Killing evil dragon needs it, it will be able to give birth to the Killing evil dragon in the souls of many creatures. "

Chen Xiang suddenly thought of the possibility that his Red fire dragon had become a Killing evil dragon because of this, but was the real Killing evil dragon already dead?

He only knew that after the Seven Mountains Divine Island exploded, the little black ball carrying a strong aura of a Killing evil dragon was swallowed by the Red fire dragon.

"Back then, Tao-creation Evil Ancestor created this era in the Myriad Tao, so this evil energy was already hidden in the era of Myriad Tao. Even in my body, this evil energy was present." Jing Yun’er said: "Maybe they felt that they were unable to control the reproduction rate of the Killing evil dragon, so they had no choice but to give up."

"So Killing evil dragon are such terrifying existences!" Chen Xiang sighed, he felt a Killing evil dragon wrapped around his body, he did not know when it would burst out.

"Although they are scary, many people want to possess the power of Killing evil dragon." Jing Yun’er sneered: "Especially those ancestors, even they wanted it. Back then, when they killed the Tao-creation Evil Ancestor, seven of them absorbed a portion of the Evil Spirit Qi in order to be able to control the Killing evil dragon! But in the end, not only were they unable to control the Killing evil dragon, they themselves were also affected by the evil influence of the Tao-creation Evil Ancestor, which made them both righteous and evil. "

Chen Xiang knew about this, it was just that he didn’t know the real reason behind the seven First Tao-creation Ancestor absorbing the Evil Qi.

"You seem to be very concerned about the Killing evil dragon. Have you seen the Killing evil dragon before?" Jing Yun’er asked: "If you have seen the Killing evil dragon with your own eyes, then you must be careful and can be easily controlled by it."

"Big Sister Yun, the reason why I was being hunted down by those Creation Race s was because I managed to cultivate Killing evil dragon." Chen Xiang laughed bitterly: "But this is a matter of the past, I am simply unable to release the Killing evil dragon now."

"Is this true?" No wonder the Chuangxie key are in your hands ... But that’s not right, even if you managed to train in Killing evil dragon, you still don’t have the memories to kill the dragon ancestor! Only the Evil Dragon Clan’s ancestor has the Chuangxie key’s memories, how did you obtain it? " Jing Yun’er was very clear about all these, far more so than the Evil-creation Race.

"I... Back then when the Seven Mountains Divine Island exploded, it was the Killing evil dragon that caused it to explode. At that time, I was born with a mass of things falling down, and those things were directed at me, so in the end, it was swallowed by this little thing. "

Chen Xiang released the Red fire dragon. The moment it came out, it roared loudly and then flew around randomly spitting out fire.

"A dragon at the reverse level!" Jing Yun’er looked at the Red fire dragon: "This thing ... Very strong! "

"Originally, the World Defying beast I cultivated was like this, but because I was angered, I had become a Killing evil dragon before, and fortunately, I was fine at that time, and the second time I felt that I was about to be devoured by evil, I was able to suppress it in the end. In the end, I didn’t feel that I was going to become a Killing evil dragon anymore. " Chen Xiang wanted to know more about the Red fire dragon, that was why he told Jing Yun’er so many things.

Jing Yun’er seemed to be very curious about Chen Xiang’s situation as well.

"It’s highly likely that this dragon of yours has swallowed or merged with the Red fire dragon. Does this dragon of yours have such an ability?" Jing Yun’er said.

"This... "Yes!"

Chen Xiang thought of Ah Hu, who had a type of Legendary mantra that could fuse with many things and then become his. Now that he thought about it, it was extremely possible that this was the case!

The Red fire dragon had fused with the Killing evil dragon ancestor, so it had the Killing evil dragon ancestor’s memories. In the future, it could even obtain a lot of powerful strength.

"Then it’s settled! He really did not expect that the matter that he was worried about with the First Tao-creation Ancestor would be resolved so easily! The Killing evil dragon still existed, but its evil energy was being suppressed. It’s the equivalent of being tamed. " Jing Yun’er was extremely excited.

"So what? Isn’t it still the same?" Chen Xiang laughed bitterly.

"So what if it’s destroyed, we can still enter the Initial Evil-creation Realm! You have the memories of a Killing evil dragon. Entering the Initial Evil-creation Realm is equivalent to being able to rule that area and control the evil energy within. " Jing Yun’er anxiously said: "I am not too sure about the details, but Killing evil dragon is at the peak of the evil power right now."

"But this little thing isn’t a Killing evil dragon!" Chen Xiang said.

"It’s equivalent to becoming a Killing evil dragon. In short, he has the memories of a Killing evil dragon." Jing Yun’er urged: "Hurry back to the mines, and get the Tao-creation’s Divine Beads out of them. The mines there are enough to refine five pills, I need to go to the Initial Evil-creation Realm to take a look."

But now, it was Jing Yun’er who was more anxious than Chen Xiang, didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

After he entered the mine, he asked Xiao Xianglin to come out.

Xiao Xianglin entered the Time array and released two clones, then took out five of the Tao-creation’s Evil Beads. She wanted to use the array formation to absorb the power of all the Tao-creation’s Holy Crystals in the mine, and guide them into the Tao-creation’s Evil Beads, and refine them into the Tao-creation’s God Orbs.

Chen Xiang and Little White Fox released two doppelgangers to guard outside the Time array. Chen Xiang released three doppelgangers to float outside the Time array to have a look.

Inside the Time array, the array disc had been twisted by time, causing an air shield to appear outside the array disc that looked like crazy water waves surging. The energy within the huge mine poured madly into the Time array, turned into a few streams of water, and flowed inside the array disc.

Jing Yun’er was very bored inside, so she couldn’t come out, so Chen Xiang let Long Xueyi go in and accompany her to play. Long Xueyi was very bored, so Chen Xiang let Long Xueyi go in to play with her.

After two days, this mine was dead, and all of its energy had been absorbed. Xiao Xianglin exited the Time array s, and successfully formed five Tao-creation Divine Beads.

"I still lack five crystals. I need to find a mine of the same size as this one." Jing Yun’er was looking forward to see how quickly she could enter the Initial Evil-creation Realm.

"If I let you out, those guys are coming again." Chen Xiang said: "I’ll talk after I run far away!"

"It’s useless even if we run far. They have teleportation." Jing Yun’er scoffed, "Just put him in there. Just react fast like last time and he’ll be fine."

Just like last time, Chen Xiang released Jing Yun’er and had her search for the next mine. After she found it, she quickly entered the Six Realms mirrors s.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com
