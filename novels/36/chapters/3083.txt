After eating the World Defying heavenly Dan, Chen Xiang fell into a deep slumber. He did not feel that many Spirit grain s were gradually appearing in his body. These Spirit grain s formed a formation to absorb the World Defying Stage Divine Power in his body and used it to temper his body.

Other than that, the pill also released an ability that after fusing with his World Defying Stage Divine Power, it would be able to seep into his body, refine his body more quickly, and strengthen his body.

"How strange!" Feng Ke’er looked at Chen Xiang outside.

Chen Xiang’s body was enveloped by the shimmering silver mist. When it surrounded his body, it would occasionally surge a little and enter Chen Xiang’s body, and then spew out a pale white mist from Chen Xiang’s body. This mist merged with the silver mist and quickly fused together.

After continuing like this for a while, the silver light mist suddenly entered Chen Xiang’s body, causing his body to suddenly swell up, and the skin on his body started to flicker with gold light, revealing waves of Spirit Qi.

Feng Ke’er could feel that the Qi he was releasing was very strong, and immediately released a few more seals, isolating the Qi, although she had already set up the seals, but she was not at ease.

"The change isn’t regular at all. What’s going on?" Feng Ke’er also did not know how long Chen Xiang would have to continue like this.

Chen Xiang only felt very comfortable and comfortable, as he was immersed in a very good state of mind, allowing his entire body to relax ...

In the blink of an eye, a month had passed. When Chen Xiang woke up, he saw Feng Ke’er looking at him with her big and round eyes.

"What’s wrong?" After Chen Xiang woke up, he felt extremely energetic and energetic. He looked at his body and exclaimed, "It has improved a lot!"

"But he didn’t manage to cultivate the Primordial Divine Body!" Feng Ke’er said somewhat dejectedly.

"I only ate one. It’s not that easy to cultivate in the Primordial Divine Body." Chen Xiang laughed: "You have to be a bit patient, I already feel that the pills here can bring about a great improvement, if I refine a few more, I will definitely be able to cultivate the Primordial Divine Body!"

There were still many World Defying heaven fruit on the World Defying heaven fruit tree, which was enough for him to refine a few pills. This was because he only needed a single fruit to refine one.

In the next period of time, Chen Xiang and Feng Ke’er worked together and continued refining World Defying heavenly Dan. With the previous experience, he could speed up a lot this time, but it would still take a lot of time.

After the second pill was refined, Chen Xiang immediately ate it. When he woke up, he discovered that the progress was actually even greater than last time!

"Soon. I feel that I only need to eat one more pill to successfully cultivate the Arrogant Divine Body." Chen Xiang was very confident.

"En, when you finish cultivating, it’s my turn. I also want to cultivate my Primordial Divine Body, so that I won’t be able to beat those Heaven Old Orcs s in the future." Feng Ke’er could also tell that Chen Xiang had improved a lot.

Chen Xiang started to refine the third pellet.

Refining the World Defying heavenly Dan now wasn’t too difficult for him, it was just that it took a lot of effort and time. Fortunately, he had Feng Ke’er’s help, so refining the World Defying heavenly Dan would be even easier than before.

After consuming the third World Defying heavenly Dan, the moment Chen Xiang began to refine it, golden light began to leak out of his body!

"Is the Primordial Divine Body coming out?" Feng Ke’er was pleasantly surprised. She could sense an extremely strong Qi from the golden fog that was leaking out. "This should be emitted from the World Defying beast in the Divine Sense Sea."

"Oh right, Chen Xiang still needs to cultivate his Six beasts, so he will need to eat even more pills. No wonder I couldn’t see how much of an improvement he had previously, he was already cultivating all the way up there." Only now did Feng Ke’er remember this matter. Chen Xiang’s World Defying beast was the strongest.

Now that Chen Xiang’s body was able to release such a strong amount of beast’s power, it meant that the Six beasts inside the Divine Sense Sea had already cultivated an unrivalled divine body, and following that, as long as Chen Xiang could cultivate an unrivalled divine body, he would be able to completely step into the World Defying Stage’s Divine Level. Furthermore, his strength would far surpass experts of the same level, because he had six World Defying Green dragon. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

When Chen Xiang was refining the medicinal power of the two World Defying heavenly Dan s that he had eaten earlier, most of the medicinal power had indeed been absorbed by the World Defying beast. Although it looked like he was cultivating with his flesh, but the slight increase in strength meant that it would be absorbed by the World Defying beast.

Feng Ke’er carefully observed the changes in Chen Xiang. Just as she approached, Chen Xiang’s body suddenly shook, and then, he spat out a burst of red flames.

"This is ..." Could it be that the Six beasts’s aura just now fused together again? " Feng Ke’er hurriedly retreated, she did not know what changes were happening inside Chen Xiang’s Divine Sense Sea World.

Just as she was feeling suspicious, she saw some dragon scales or Qilin armors appearing on Chen Xiang’s face.

"Looks like the Six beasts is fusing with his body, and is also strengthening his flesh. His cultivation method is truly unique." Feng Ke’er felt that it was extremely strange and observed it more carefully.

After more than twenty days, Chen Xiang’s body was still in a state of dragon’s scale and Qilin armor, but as he opened his eyes, his body returned to its original state.

"I did it!" Chen Xiang had a very calm breakthrough, and unexpectedly, not a single bit of Qi was leaked out, which Feng Ke’er found hard to believe.

"Really? But I don’t seem to have felt your proud divine body! " Feng Ke’er ran over and pinched Chen Xiang’s face, and frowned: You really broke through? I really can’t feel that your fleshly body is that proud of the divine body. "

"I’ve really broken through!" Chen Xiang laughed: "My body is at the early stage of the Divine Body realm, so it’s not very obvious for now."

Feng Ke’er asked: "What about the Six beasts in your body?"

"They have all successfully cultivated the Primordial Divine Body!" Chen Xiang laughed: "They are becoming more powerful now, the reason why I am so slow, is probably because they have absorbed a lot of medicinal power."

"I saw that you were in a very strange state ..." Feng Ke’er told her about Chen Xiang’s condition just now.

After Chen Xiang heard this, he also felt that it was very interesting, but he did not take it to heart.

"Next is for you to eat." Chen Xiang said.

He and Feng Ke’er had teamed up and refined three pellets in one go.

What he did not expect was that Feng Ke’er only ate one pill to cultivate his Primordial Divine Body, he was much faster than him.

"Breaking through with just one pill, this World Defying heavenly Dan is too scary." Feng Ke’er had thought that he needed to eat three pills just like Chen Xiang’s.

"Of course!" Chen Xiang chuckled: "Whoever made this pill, succeeded in heading to the Myriad Tao from here."

The pill formulas left behind by the Myriad Tao Dan God were extremely useful to him, he would be able to continue consuming these pills to cultivate in the future.
