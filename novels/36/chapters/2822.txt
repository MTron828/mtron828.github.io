Chen Xiang thought that the Bat Super Venerable only knew what was around there, but he did not know the exact location, so he was not really worried about getting hurt by them, so he continued to stay silent. More recent chapter access: * ww.

The Bat Super Venerable did indeed know that something was nearby. This was something that the dragon bat he rode had told him, so he was unable to sense where Chen Xiang was.

Chen Xiang hovered in the air. Seeing the dragon bat turning around and flying towards him, he was suddenly shocked, and then quickly floated upwards, letting himself be in the air, and then teleported to the other side.

As he teleported behind the giant dragon-bat, the dragon-bat immediately turned to him, and now he was sure that the bat knew where he was.

"Ah Fu, hurry up!" Bat Super Venerable bellowed, following that, the gigantic dragon bat started to increase its speed, but it was still not fast, and was much slower than a human flying speed.

Chen Xiang released three clones from three different directions and then the dragon bat stopped!

"Hehe, this guy is really easy to deal with!" Chen Xiang snickered in his heart, then used his Dao heart Eye to look at the small mountain below. That small mountain was burned by the flames spat by the dragon bat just now, there should be something inside.

"Could it be that there is a Heavenly Alchemy artifact inside?" Chen Xiang did not dare to release the Heavenly Alchemy immortal power to sense, otherwise the Bat Super Venerable would sense him.

"Ah Fu, continue burning that small mountain. Don’t bother with that person. He definitely doesn’t have any strength. Otherwise, he wouldn’t dare to show himself." Bat Super Venerable let out a childish snort, and then, the huge dragon bat slowly flew back.

Chen Xiang didn’t dare to get too close to the hill. The Bat Super Venerable and the powerful Dragon Bat were right on top of the hill.

"Elder Wang, what kind of fellow is Bat Super Venerable exactly? I met him, he doesn’t look that bad! " Chen Xiang asked. Bat Super Venerable’s voice was like that of a child’s.

"This guy is a child... You met him? Do not ever come into conflict with him, as long as you do not have any connections with him, nothing should happen to you! " Master Wang’s words made Chen Xiang speechless.

A strong and powerful Supreme Lord was actually a child! Of course, this Bat Super Venerable was definitely not young, and it was definitely because of some reason.

Master Wang told Chen Xiang not to get too close to Bat Super Venerable, but Chen Xiang chose not to do as Master Wang told him. Previously, Master Wang told Chen Xiang not to enter this Dragon Devil Dead Land, but Chen Xiang still went in ...

"Bat Super Venerable, are you looking for a Heavenly Alchemy artifact? There are Heavenly Alchemy artifact beneath this mountain? " Chen Xiang transmitted to the Bat Super Venerable.

"That’s right, who exactly are you? "You’re sneaking around, hurry up and come out!" Bat Super Venerable heard Chen Xiang’s sound transmission and immediately said that. He knew that there was someone in the vicinity, but he did not know who it was.

"You’re right. My strength is inferior to yours, so I don’t dare to show myself. I’m just a weak fellow!" Chen Xiang replied: "I’m worried that you will kill me once I discover my monk."

"Humph, my Bat Super Venerable isn’t a person who kills innocents." Bat Super Venerable scoffed, "Hurry up and show yourself. You can see me and I can’t see you. This is very unfair!"

Chen Xiang secretly laughed, this Bat Super Venerable was indeed a little childish.

"You’re wearing a mask, so I can’t see you either. We should be even now." Chen Xiang said.

"No, you can’t see Ah Fu, you can see where I am, you can see my body, but I don’t know where you are, I can’t even see your hair." Bat Super Venerable seemed to be very anxious and was even a little angry.

"What does it matter? I can’t beat you, I can’t kill you, I’m not a threat to you! I just want to see what kind of Heavenly Alchemy artifact you can dig out, I’m very curious! " Just as Chen Xiang finished speaking, the dragon bat stopped its flames to burn that mountain.

"I’m not digging anymore, that way you won’t be able to see the Heavenly Alchemy artifact. You’ll die from anxiety." The Bat Super Venerable said with her somewhat proud and tender voice.

"Alright then, goodbye!" Chen Xiang said, and then did not speak anymore.

Bat Super Venerable waited for a while, then scratched his head and yelled: "Just who are you, with your weak strength, but with such methods, even my Ah Fu is not able to pinpoint your location."

Chen Xiang still did not speak. He wanted to make this Bat Super Venerable go crazy because this Bat Super Venerable was extremely curious about him.

A little while later, Bat Super Venerable said: "You also have a Heavenly Alchemy artifact, I sensed it ... You are also here to look for the Heavenly Alchemy artifact right ... Haha, this Heavenly Alchemy artifact is mine now, don’t think of getting it! "

My Heavenly Alchemy artifact is very powerful, so I do not wish to obtain it. Furthermore, you are so powerful, I cannot defeat you, so I do not hope to obtain it myself, I just want to see what this Heavenly Alchemy artifact is. Chen Xiang laughed: "Don’t worry, I have plenty of time, but you ..." If the people from the Heavenly Alchemy Divine Sect were to come in, they might be able to find this place. "

"You’re lying. I have two Heavenly Alchemy artifact s in my hands right now, and none of them are stronger than you. Even though your Heavenly Alchemy artifact has Heavenly Alchemy immortal power, it’s very weak. The two Heavenly Alchemy artifact s in my hands, both of them are very strong." The Bat Super Venerable said.

"Just because the Heavenly Alchemy immortal power is weak doesn’t mean that the Heavenly Alchemy artifact is weak." Chen Xiang retorted.

"How about we compete? If we can win against the Heavenly Alchemy artifact in my hands, I’ll give it to you." Bat Super Venerable replied: "Don’t worry, I won’t hit you. I’m not that kind of person."

"But I heard you did a lot of bad things. I don’t really trust you." Chen Xiang said.

"Have you ever heard of me killing someone? Surely not! Although what I have done is a bit disgraceful, at least I have not taken the lives of others. I am much stronger than some people. " The Bat Super Venerable said.

Chen Xiang immediately asked the Master Wang about it. The Master Wang thought for a moment, then told Chen Xiang that although the Bat Super Venerable was lacking, but in the Flying Dragon Palace, he was considered kind. He had never heard of him killing anyone.

"Competing with the Heavenly Alchemy artifact is not fair! This is because the strength of a Heavenly Alchemy artifact has a lot to do with its user. " Chen Xiang said: "How about this, we’ll use their respective Heavenly Alchemy artifact, and see who can unleash their full strength."

"Not good, you said it earlier, this is related to the strength of the user. I am so strong, so when using the Heavenly Alchemy artifact, I can definitely unleash a stronger power." The Bat Super Venerable said, "I have also taken advantage of you."

Chen Xiang felt that this Bat Super Venerable was a little interesting. After pondering for a while, he revealed his true appearance.

"The Heavenly Alchemy seal in your hands are very suitable for me to use, because I also have a Divine Equipment that is somewhat similar to this one." Chen Xiang said as he took out the Emperor seal.
