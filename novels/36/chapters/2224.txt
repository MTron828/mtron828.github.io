The Black Stone Divine Venerable was also a Earthly beast, so Huo Lin might even know something. Chen Xiang immediately told Huo Lin about the black ape that was hiding the truth that happened with the Black Stone Divine Venerable. WWw. 8 00book.net

All the words, faster, no windows! >

After Huo Lin heard it, he frowned: "As expected, it’s this guy. The Earthly beast told me to be careful, and to not go down the evil path, or else it would become like this! That Black Stone Divine Venerable should be trapped in the core of the earth right now. If he comes out, the first thing he will do is to come find me! Black Stone Divine Venerable is very clear, if you want to control a world, you have to go to the Core! "

"Can you beat him? Once that guy becomes a black ape, his strength will increase by many times. If that’s not possible, then leave it to me! " Chen Xiang felt that he had a certain chance of winning against the Black Stone Divine Venerable. His Heavenly magic sword s were also very powerful, not to mention that he still had the Chuangshi god furnace s.

"We’ll talk about it when the time comes. This core is my territory, so he’s not in my territory!" Huo Lin said: "Right now, this Nine Heaven World has become so powerful, and as the Earthly beast of the Nine Heaven World, I naturally am not far off."

"If Black Stone Divine Venerable ran out, would he really come here at the first possible moment?" Chen Xiang asked: "Does he know how to get here?"

"There’s no mistake. As long as it’s a Earthly beast, once we go to the territory of another Earthly beast, I will definitely go there to take a look. If we discover any other Earthly beast in this earth, he will issue a challenge to me." Huo Lin said.

Chen Xiang nodded her head, "I’ll go out first and tell Qilian of the situation here, so that she won’t be so worried. I’ll come back to the Black Stone Divine Venerable and wait for you there.

In Chen Xiang’s eyes, the core of the Nine Heaven World was much stronger than the core of the Black Stone Divine Venerable.

Chen Xiang came to the surface through the Transmission array here, and then returned to the Hundreds of Flowers Village. At this moment, Lv Qilian was already very familiar with Xiao Yulan and the others. When Chen Xiang arrived at Lv Qilian’s Villa, he coincidentally saw Xiao Yulan handing the Six Realms Ding over to Lv Qilian.

Xue Xianxian, Liu Meng’er, and the rest of their smithing team were also here!

"Let’s refine the Six Realms Ding for them!" After Lv Qilian received it, he was not rejected, but she passed the Six Realms Ding over to Liu Meng’er: "This Six Realms Ding was originally fixed by them, and they also need a powerful cauldron to smelt the ingredients, I feel that it’s the most suitable for them, if necessary, I can just ask them for it, since we are good sisters."

Xiao Yulan had no objections to Lv Qilian’s methods either. The Six Realms Ding had been repaired by Xue Xianxian and the others, and she did not need to use it now.

"How is the earth’s core?" Seeing Chen Xiang coming back smilingly, Lv Qilian knew that the situation at the core of the earth wasn’t as she had imagined, but she was still a bit worried.

"It’s fine, the earth’s core has become stronger, so there’s an additional dimension to protect us, so we can’t teleport in from the outside! I’m afraid that I won’t be able to go to the core of the earth often, and it would be inconvenient to go in through that passage. " Even if he went in, it would be rather troublesome.

Lv Qilian nodded and said, "I heard that you have become very strong. Now that Hui Shan and the others are dealing with Hell Devil Emperor, are you interested?" Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

"Of course!" Chen Xiang immediately replied: "I wanted to kill this bastard for a long time, it’s just that I couldn’t find a good chance!"

The Hell Devil Emperor’s backers were all the Divine Nations’s, but those Divine Nations’s were all broken now, so they had no backers either.

Chen Xiang found out about Long Huishan’s destination from Lv Qilian, and Yue’er and him immediately rushed over.

"I want to see how strong Hell Devil Emperor is right now!" Chen Xiang continued to teleport and arrived at the Demon Emperor Mountain Range in less than an hour. This mountain range had been occupied by the Hell Devil Emperor for many years, so it became known as the mountain range.

Chen Xiang quickly contacted Long Huishan, as they had gathered news about the Hell Devil Emperor outside the Demon Emperor Mountain Range.

Inside a cave, Long Huishan and Xiao Baifeng were flipping through a stack of papers.

"Why are you collecting information on Hell Devil Emperor? Just kill your way in! " After Chen Xiang came in, he looked at the contents of the papers on the table and knew that these were all information related to the Hell Devil Emperor.

"It’s not as easy as you make it out to be. Hell Devil Emperor is very focused on cultivating the evil way, and his speed of improvement is also very scary. We don’t know much about him right now, so we can’t act rashly." Little Lizhi said, she was extremely cautious.

Leng Youlan and Mu Qianxiang were also here, they looked at Chen Xiang with an approving gaze. They had wanted to do this since a long time ago, but Long Huishan and the others did not want to do so.

"Then, do you think that he has 90 Divine Deity?" asked with a smile. He had hidden himself well, Long Huishan and the others had never realized that he had become very strong.

"Of course not, but they definitely have a few dozen Divine Deity s. Furthermore, there are quite a few strong ones like them. In addition to their various demonic techniques and various poisons, they are still very strong." Xiao Baifeng replied.

Yan Yanran suddenly walked in and said seriously, "They have a plan. Their army is already gathering in the mountains, ready to make a move. Their target is the Floating Divine City closest to the Demon Emperor Mountain Range."

Lan Lan also anxiously ran in and shouted: "Not good, they have started moving, and are preparing to pass by our place."

"Chen Xiang, you’re here too! Are you going to fight? " Yan Yanran asked: "Inform Sister Qilian first, looks like she will have to take charge personally. If Hell Devil Emperor takes down the Floating Divine City, then it’s our turn."

Chen Xiang laughed: No need to look for Sister Qilian, leave it to me! You Lan, Qianxiang, go! "

"Brother, are you so confident? Have you become very strong?" Leng Youlan was very excited, he laughed and pinched Chen Xiang’s face: "Looks like you have become much stronger!"

"It’s not that I’ve become much stronger, it’s that I’ve become much stronger!" Chen Xiang also pinched her face and laughed: "Let’s go, it’s time for Hell Devil Emperor to die."

Long Huishan didn’t say anything more and followed Chen Xiang out of the cave. She knew Chen Xiang was a very cautious person and would not say such words unless he was absolutely confident.

After walking out of the cave, Chen Xiang felt a wave of Evil Spirit pressing over. The sky had turned gray, and was shrouded in dense Evil Qi, the forest in front of them started to surge, the Hell Devil Emperor’s Evil Demon Army was walking out majestically.

"Look at the forest, there are a lot of flying Evil beast. Hell Devil Emperor sure has great ability to get so many of these monsters." Lan Lan said: "So many, covering the sky!"

Chen Xiang looked into the distance and saw a dense black fog approaching slowly, rising and falling. If one looked carefully, they would be able to see that it was a large group of densely packed Evil beast flying in the air, just like a large group of bats. Just by looking at them, one would feel a large amount of pressure. WWw. 8 00book.net
