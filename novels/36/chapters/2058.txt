Leng Youlan and Mu Qianxiang looked indifferent. They had no concept of what it was, so they were naturally not afraid of it, but Wang Jinshi and Chen Xiang had serious expressions, and Lv Qilian’s expression was filled with seriousness. She already understood Yue’er better, whether Yue’er was from the Star Law Divine Realm, or a strong law enforcer.

Yue’er flew to a table, took a sip of the juice in the cup, and said, "You should already know that I am from Star Law Divine Realm, right? There are many days and months outside of the distant starry sky, similar to this place, only that your current Nine Heaven World has not grown to the point where I can break through my limitations and enter the distant astral plane."

"If only we could annex the Super God Realm. In the distant starry sky, other than the fact that our Star Law Divine Realm is a powerful and prosperous world, there are a few other stronger ones, and one of them is called the World of the Giant Gods. They are all giant and giant beasts, and they are all very powerful, but this world has been destroyed by a type of bug.

Yue Er took a deep breath: "Later on, because these bugs couldn’t move for a long distance and couldn’t find food, they died in the Giant God World. According to your description, those eggs were from those bugs, and I don’t know who brought them here.

Long Xueyi asked: "How is the comparison of the Gigantic Divine World compared to your Star Law Divine Realm?"

Yue Er thought for a moment and said, "It’s hard to say, I heard from the elders in the clan that they are all similar. I heard from the elders in the clan that those bugs were born in the World of Giant Gods, so they were initially ignored.

"That insect’s reproduction speed is very scary, and the stronger the bug is, the stronger the eggs it gives birth to, and the stronger its destructive power from birth." Moon Child said, "Legend has it that the powerhouses of the Titan world could only retreat against the Bugs Emperor. The majority of the giants are only able to survive after fleeing into the starry sky."

"I will make a trip to the Nine Heaven School to let them pay attention to this. Chen Xiang, don’t stay idle. Lv Qilian had already understood from Yue’er that Super God Realm was different in terms of time compared to the people here, which resulted in Chen Xiang having less time compared to the people here.

"Xianxian and the others are refining powerful array discs, they won’t come out for a while. Go and cultivate first, since they are all here, you will see them sooner or later." Long Xueyi knew that Chen Xiang really wanted to see Xianxian and the others, so he asked.

Yue’er said, "I’ll accompany you in your cultivation. Your situation is rather complicated, so maybe I can give you some advice when the time comes so that you won’t take the wrong path."

Chen Xiang nodded, he also wanted to condense his third Divine Deity and become a God. He realized that the girls here all had at least a few Divine Deity, if he didn’t increase them quickly, they might laugh at him in the future.

In this villa, there was a Transmission array that could be teleported deep into the ground.

Chen Xiang used a Transmission array to teleport to a secret room that was completely surrounded by white.

"This is the energy inside the dragon vein, these are the crystals formed by the dragon vein." Chen Xiang was extremely familiar with this type of energy and could immediately recognize it.

"I’ll be able to condense the third Divine Deity very soon. I’ve already cultivated it for a long time already." Chen Xiang laughed.

"You are also quite eccentric. With only two Divine Deity, your body should have already cultivated two Bones. With your current strength, you should be able to compete with five or six gods with Divine Deity." Yue’er said: "However, it’s still better for you to condense more Divine Deity. It can strengthen your divine power and your Bones combined with the powerful divine power will have a better effect."

Chen Xiang nodded, and took out some Divine Deity that he had obtained earlier, he planned to refine these Divine Deity into a pellet.

"Yue’er, if you can cultivate ten Divine Deity, doesn’t that mean you can have ten types of innate abilities? If it’s Hundred gods level, then it’s a hundred." Chen Xiang asked.

"Of course not. Generally speaking, most people specialize in several types of innate divine abilities. Otherwise, they would master too many divine abilities. However, the power of these divine abilities are too weak and the power of their divine abilities aren’t enough."

Chen Xiang asked again, "Weren’t you able to use your innate ability uncontrollably?"

The power of the so-called ability was the power contained within the Divine Deity that corresponded to the innate ability.

"You can control these three innate abilities if you cultivate them, but all you need is your Divine Deity. In the future, if you feel that you need any innate abilities, you can just cultivate them again." Yue Er said.

Chen Xiang’s first divine ability was the World Creation Flame, which gave him a lot of help in refining pills. His second was the Celestial Phenomenon Art, which he had learnt while cultivating the Heavenly spirit kunfu, which gave him a very strong defensive power. He rarely used it, so the combination of the Celestial Phenomenon Art and the profoundwu clothing made his defenses very strong.

As for the third innate ability, he wanted to cultivate it to be related to the use of spatial energy.

"Yue Er, you should be more familiar with the usage of spatial energy compared to me. My third innate ability is related to cultivating spatial energy. How can I cultivate it?" Chen Xiang didn’t have any spatial cultivation technique or technique. The Heavenly Elephant divine ability that he had previously cultivated was something that he had learnt from cultivating his Heavenly Body’s divine ability.

"Then when you condense the third Divine Deity, you will need to use spatial power to do so." Yue Er said.

"Using the power of space to condense Divine Deity, what should we do?" Chen Xiang felt that even if he used the Heavenly Alchemy, it would be rather difficult.

"Cultivation method, don’t you have a cultivation method for cultivating the power of space?" Yue’er replied, "As long as you follow the cultivation technique, it’ll be fine."

Chen Xiang said: "I normally cultivate using the Heavenly Alchemy, but right now, I haven’t found the spatial energy within the Heavenly Alchemy. I don’t have any spatial energy cultivation methods."

Yue’er was extremely surprised, she had just casually said it, but did not expect Chen Xiang to really do it. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

"Alright, I’ll pass my cultivation technique to you." Yue’er flew to the top of Chen Xiang’s head and began transferring techniques. "I want to enter your Divine Sense Sea.

Chen Xiang nodded, relaxed, and allowed Yue’er to enter his Divine Sense Sea, directly passing down techniques to his soul.

After Yue’er entered Chen Xiang’s Divine Sense Sea, she found it extremely interesting. "Your Divine Sense Sea is really simple, just ordinary."

"Hehe, then what about your Divine Sense Sea? I really want to take a look." Chen Xiang said with a smile. He had also understood that many people’s Divine Sense Sea was full of whims and fantasies, but Lv Qilian’s was a sea of flowers, even the sun, moon and stars were all flowers. When he went in earlier, he was also shocked.

"It’s a secret." Yue’er giggled: "It’s my secret that my Divine Sense Sea World can’t be revealed to others."

After Yue’er entered Chen Xiang’s Divine Sense Sea, she had actually turned into a beautiful young lady in white. When she saw Chen Xiang’s spirit staring at her, her cheeks flushed red.
