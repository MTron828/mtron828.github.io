"Ji Ling’er, have you lost your mind in the last hundred years? Tens of thousands of years ago, the people from their Nine Heaven World were already beaten so badly that they couldn’t get over it, and now, they still dare to come."

"This is different from the past." Ji Ling’er said, "Right now, we need to minimize our losses and let him live ... Maybe he can be used to exchange for those fifteen of us. It’s very likely that the three million kilogram Holy stone would return."

Just based on your words, how can we believe that the brat’s status is very high, the Nine Heaven World’s people will risk their lives to save him, if we don’t torture him earlier, what if we miss the best opportunity to do so? The elder sneered.

Chen Xiang suddenly said: "As long as I live well, my comrades will come. Although I am very weak, I have a very important thing on me that is worth them taking risks."

"You don’t even have a single Storage magic treasure on you." An old man said in disdain,

"Good things can be hidden within the body." After Chen Xiang finished speaking, he released the Green dragon demon-slain broadsword, allowing it to float in the air.

Seeing this godly weapon, those old men immediately sucked in a breath of cold air and let out a low sigh.

"Green dragon demon-slain broadsword... I never thought that I would be able to see the legendary Divine Blade in my lifetime. "

"It’s really the Green dragon demon-slain broadsword, those Spirit grain look too familiar, only that person can create them."

"This kid really has a strong background."

"I heard that the Green dragon demon-slain broadsword recognized a person and fused with his soul, causing him to die. Back then, that Qi Shi fellow paid a huge price in order to separate himself from the divine blade."

Ji Ling’er’s small mouth gaped as she looked at the Green dragon demon-slain broadsword’s divine gaze. She had heard of the legend of this divine blade when she was very young, she never thought that this brat would actually have such a thing. Previously, she was even tricked by Chen Xiang, thinking that he was just a small fry.

Chen Xiang never thought that the Four Symbols Divine Weapons’s fame would have such an effect.

"This matter cannot be spread out. Ling’er, you will be in charge of watching over him. You will not allow him to speak or interact with him. Both of you will be placed under house arrest in the Heavenly Pavilion. You will not let this news leak out." The patriarch of the Ji Clan said solemnly.

"Yes." Ji Ling’er hurriedly replied as she felt relieved. She knew that the Ji Clan wanted to get her hands on the Green dragon demon-slain broadsword. Three million Holy stone might be a lot, but it was nothing compared to the Green dragon demon-slain broadsword.

Chen Xiang and Ji Ling’er were brought to the top of a tall tower.

In the room at the top of the tower, there was no window, only a thick, pitch-black wall that was ice-cold and hard, and a few small holes that could let light in.

"This is the Pavilion of Heaven, how terrible."

Chen Xiang stood on top of a stone stool and looked outside through the ventilation hole. He could only see a large mountain faintly discernible in the clouds.

"Be quiet." Ji Ling’er called out softly before sending a sound transmission to him, "I am thinking of a way to save you. The situation has already developed beyond my expectations."

"So it’s hard for me to run away." Chen Xiang sat down. From his expression, he was not really that worried.

"Who asked you to have a Green dragon demon-slain broadsword? Otherwise, you wouldn’t be locked up here. This is an important place to our Ji Clan, even if we ran out of the Heaven Pavilion, it would be very difficult to escape from this place." Ji Ling’er sat on the ground while hugging his knees, his face filled with helplessness.

Chen Xiang asked via sound transmission. "You really have three million kilograms of Holy stone."

Ji Ling’er glared at him grudgingly: "If it wasn’t for those Holy stone s, I wouldn’t even bother to pay attention to you."

Chen Xiang curled his lips: "It was you who grabbed me to face the consequences first, I can’t let you succeed in this."

"Don’t be in such a hurry. Even though we’re locked up in this place, we still have a way to get out. Let me think about it." Ji Ling’er’s attitude was very good, making Chen Xiang feel that she was rather pleasing to the eye.

Right now, the one who was panicking was Ji Ling’er, she was worried that Chen Xiang would reveal her.

"If your plan goes smoothly, you will also be punished. For the sake of the three million kilogram Holy stone, you aren’t afraid of the Ji Clan’s torture."

Ji Ling’er smiled slightly: "You don’t know this, they have at most locked me up for one to two thousand years. Although my mistake is big, it isn’t enough to get me tortured." Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

"Son and son, how about this? I’ll rescue you and you give me one million kilograms of Holy stone. What do you think?" Chen Xiang said.

Ji Ling’er’s beautiful eyes immediately widened until they were round, "Help me get out, then I’ll give you another million kilograms of Holy stone."

Chen Xiang smiled and nodded his head.

Ji Ling’er frowned slightly as her eyeballs moved about, "But I should be the one who saved you, so you can hand those fifteen fellows over to me."

Chen Xiang laughed: "I have a way to get out, but you don’t have any good methods right now."

Ji Ling’er snorted: "Are you trying to extort me? If I don’t agree, then tell me about me monopolizing the Holy stone, right?"

"No, we are cooperating. Think about it, it’s because of me that you have the chance to plan to take all three million catties of Holy stone. It’s just that you are not progressing very well in the future, but with my help, I can help you escape." Chen Xiang snickered: "I see that you don’t have any feelings for this Ji Clan, so you’re willing to escape from him right?"

"You can assume that, with my cooperation, you will be able to obtain two million kilograms of Holy stone without paying anything, and have even left the Ji Clan as well."

Chen Xiang understood Ji Ling’er’s current situation. From the attitudes of the elders, they could tell that she was not very popular in the Ji Clan, and adding that she wanted to monopolize a large number of Holy stone s that the Ji Clan owned, they knew that she had some resentment towards the Ji Clan.

"That’s right, because of your appearance, I have this plan." Ji Ling’er thought about it carefully before deciding to work with Chen Xiang. As there was not much time left for Chen Xiang, someone would come to take him away soon. Then, they would conduct research and isolate the Green dragon demon-slain broadsword from his body.

If Chen Xiang had told her about it when she was taken away, then she wouldn’t be as simple as someone who had been imprisoned for thousands of years. She would be tortured to death by the Ji Clan.

"Bring out that one million catties of Holy stone. I can be considered to be more courteous than you. I didn’t want to take more than half of it." Chen Xiang extended his hand: "Don’t worry, I will definitely bring you out. Right now, we are only ants on a string."

Ji Ling’er bit his lips in pain and quickly handed over the ten Storage bag s to Chen Xiang. Chen Xiang used his mind to check the amount inside and confirmed with satisfaction.

They were secretly communicating with each other, so the people guarding the door wouldn’t hear anything.

"Hurry up, those old men are going to invite some experts. It’ll be too late by then." Ji Ling’er urged.
