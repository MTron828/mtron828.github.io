Looking about the ruins, Hua Xiangyue’s knit her brow tightly. She pulled Chen Xiang’s closer, for she felt that this place was filled with a terrifying aura.

“Where in hell are we?” Hua Xiangyue looked to Chen Xiang.

“This should be where the most ancient tribe, the Human King Family used to live. The entire Sacred Ancient Land may very likely be the birthplace of them,” Chen Xiang could also feel an appalling aura in here.

The reason Hua Xiangyue never found this place when she came here last time was because this place was hidden by an array. What’s more was that this place was in ruin, yet it had been hidden by a strong array for as long as a hundred thousand years. One could surely reckon that some very impressive thing was here.

After having a bad premonition, Chen Xiang immediately activated the Luo Tian Door and opened a gate.

“Hurry up!” Pulling up Hua Xiangyue, Chen Xiang hurriedly entered that door. At the same time, they heard an ear-deafening roar coming from behind as they were assailed with a horrifying aura, raising the hair all over their body.

“A dragon!” Long Xueyi exclaimed. “However, from its aura, that dragon doesn’t belong to my Imperial Dragon Family, maybe it’s a low-rank dragon who had evolved from a flood dragon. However, it should still be one of most terrifying existence for the mortal world.”

Much to Chen Xiang’s surprise, it turned out to be a dragon! Hearing this, he was immediately filled with an inexplicable excitement, for he was cultivating the Dragonslayers’ Divine Martial Techniques, which were specially created to slay a dragon. He very much wanted to try these dragonslayer’s techniques. However, he couldn’t for now, as that dragon was very strong, so strong that it scared Hua Xiangyue to the point that her face had gone pale. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I truly didn’t expect that there would be a dragon in the mortal world! Fortunately, you, this Little Rascal were smart enough to retreat.” Hua Xiangyue was still in a state of shock. She was panting for breath. She was a powerful expert in the mortal world, yet facing a horrifying beast like a dragon, she was feeling powerless.

Now, Chen Xiang and Hua Xiangyue came to know that the Blood Lightning Mountain Sea was created artificially by someone, all in order to make sure that no one would enter this place. If some powerful array grandmaster entered this place, they just might find the array that was imprisoning that dragon, and maybe, due to their curiosity, they might open the array. At that time, it would be a disaster for the Mortal Martial World.

“It seems that the Human King Family had imprisoned that dragon. That family sure is very powerful,” Hua Xiangyue marveled as a sigh leaked from her mouth. Of course, what astounded her the most was the fact that the disc in Chen Xiang’s hand could open a space door.

“That senior did not allow me to divulge anything about me, so, I can’t tell you anything, maybe in the future,” stated Chen Xiang, helpless.

“Don’t sweat it, I am not going to force you to tell me. Can we also leave with this thing?” Hua Xiangyue asked.

“But of course, I can return to the Chenwu Mainland with this. If I am strong enough, I can go even cross this world,” answered Chen Xiang. He very much wanted to check other worlds out.

Hearing that he could travel to the other worlds, even Hua Xiangyue was excited. Traveling to the other world wasn’t that simple. Only some powerful array grandmaster could travel to the other world through a huge teleportation array.

Also, if one found a rift in space and could resist the wear and tear inside it, one could traverse to another world. But this way, it would be very difficult to return to the original world.

Vast as the Mortal Martial World was, as far as those tycoons who had lived for tens of thousands of years, it was very small. Take Hua Xiangyue for instance, she had traveled to many mainlands to find herbs over the years.

“Is that herb garden also inside an array?” asked Hua Xiangyue, otherwise, such a huge herb garden in here would have been found by her for sure.

Chen Xiang, shaking his head, said, “It should be. However, the herb garden is under the ground. When we came in, I am afraid no one would have the expected for the good stuff to be under the ground.”

Hua Xiangyue gave out a light snort as she said, “Who would have expected, huh?”

Very soon, Chen Xiang found a tree with some symbol following the map. Though many years had come and gone, the symbol was still there.

Spotting a small ‘Li(李)’ character on the thick trunk, Hua Xiangyue knew that the entrance of that herb garden was inside this tree. This forest was so huge, furthermore, these kind of trees were countless in numbers. Who would notice a character that was just the size of a finger!

“Li Tianjun was not just a Dan King, he was very impressive when it comes to array and refining equipment as well. If he wanted to make this kind of stuff, it would be a piece of cake for him.”

Chen Xiang had a Refining Weapon Scroll. Since he had gotten the memories of four array grandmasters, he had come to realize how impressive those complex spirit patterns inside it are and why Liu Menger was so fascinated by them. All in all, those spirit patterns were terrific and very esoteric.

Chen Xiang, with his finger, pushed the “Li(李)” character, and it was pushed in very easily. Without the map or the instruction, no one would know that there was a mechanism in here.

Just as the finger was pushed in, a glowing white door appeared on the trunk of that tree.

Seeing this, Hua Xiangyue was excited. She reckoned that the herb garden had many rare and precious herbs.

“Let’s go in!” Chen Xiang, pulling Hua Xiangyue’s hands, went in.

As soon as they stepped into the door, the gate closed and immediately disappeared. And when they got inside, Chen Xiang’s and Hua Xiangyue’s eyes were dazzled with bright light as they caught sight of a spiral staircase heading down.

The staircase led very deep under the ground. At the end of the staircase, Chen Xiang and Hua Xiangyue saw a stone door. When they opened the door, a very long passage was presented before them. And the rocks on either side of passage lit up with white light automatically.

“What a great place!” Chen Xiang took a deep breath, for the Spirit Qi here was extremely rich.

“Mhmm, I think that the soil of the herb garden had already transformed into spirit soil. This soil is best for planting spirit herbs,” stated Hua Xiangyue.

At this moment, Chen Xiang and Hua Xiangyue were extremely excited. Both of them were alchemists. Those rare and precious herbs were extremely tempting to them. After all, those were the herbs left behind by a Dan King, they sure weren’t going to be ordinary. Moreover, Dan King Li Tianjun had entered the first mysterious realm once, which had countless precious herbs. He must have had obtained a lot of them.

As Chen Xiang and Hua Xiangyue arrived at the end, an iron gate with a keyhole entered their sight. Seeing this, just as Hua Xiangyue wanted to blast the door open with her palm, Chen Xiang hurriedly stopped her as he said, smiling, “I have the key here.”

The key was universal, it could open all the doors of herb gardens left behind by Li Tianjun. Once Chen Xiang pushed in the key and gave it a twist, the iron gate opened on its own.

Chen Xiang’s and Hua Xiangyue’s nerves stretched thin. They held their breath as they watched the iron gate open slowly. But as soon as the dense Spirit Qi blew on their faces, they became extremely excited, especially when the rich fragrance of spirit grass and flowers assailed their noses.

Once the gate opened, Chen Xiang and Hua Xiangyue could see the beautiful herb garden clearly. There were many flowers and trees inside. Just with one glance, they recognized some extremely rare spirit herbs.

But just as they went in, they saw an elder looking at them with a jovial smile on his face!

Much to their shock and horror, someone was actually inside.
