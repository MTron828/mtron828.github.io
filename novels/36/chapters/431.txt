Mo Tian and the others also stepped up to testify, one after another. Even Wang Quan’s eldest apprentice nodded and said, “He is speaking the truth. When the round was just about to end, there had been big activities, I think the entire mysterious realm should know of it.”

“Why don’t I see that demon heart? If it’s an extremely powerful evil demon, its demon heart will also be different,” Wang Quan was still a bit skeptical.

Chen Xiang heaved a sigh and took out that Poisonous Scorpion King’s demon heart. Many people were immediately fascinated by its dazzling green glow, in particular, that pure and vast energy; even those Nirvana Realm martial artists were enticed by it. This sure was a treasure; it was quite normal for Chen Xiang to intentionally hide it.

Seeing this demon heart, Wang Quan couldn’t utter a thing. Everyone had a new understanding of Chen Xiang’s abilities; Chen Xiang surprisingly knew how to arrange such a powerful illusion array that could entrap so many evil demons at once.

Chen Xiang was in no way stupid. If he let Wang Quan knew that he had killed Wang Quan’s two treasured apprentices, maybe Wang Quan would not let him participate in the finals with ease. In order to ensure that he could take the Fruit of Fortune without anything going wrong, he could not infuriate Wang Quan. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Looking at this demon heart, the evil demon was extremely powerful and such a powerful evil demon is actually inside. It quite possible that your apprentices had encountered this kind of evil demon. It’s quite normal for them being unable to escape. Why are suspecting that they have been killed by someone? Surely you don’t think your treasured apprentice are sufficiently strong to deal with an evil demon whose strength is close to a Nirvana Realm expert?” ridiculed Lian Yingxiao.

“Humph, why did you not tell us that it was such a dangerous place? If this brat got killed inside, that old madman would throw all caution to the wind and come looking for you to settle the debt!” said Gu Dongchen, harrumphing coldly.

Actually, the most surprised was Liu Menger. She had a good understanding of Chen Xiang; he was a complete ignoramus when it came to arrays, but he was able to arrange an illusion array that was so powerful that it was actually able to entrap an evil demon that was not too far away from entering Nirvana Realm!

“Sun Xueren, Mo Tian, Lanlan, and Chen Xiang, you will enter the finals! Sun Xueren will fight with Mo Tian, Lanlan will fight with Chen Xiang! The winner of two group will enter the finals! The semifinals will start after three days!” Having finished speaking, Wang Quan flew away. He was in an extremely bad mood.

All of Wang Quan’s smug calculations had been smashed, and too miserably at that. Three of his treasured apprentice had been killed, all of whom were very outstanding King’s Vein martial artists. One of them even had Fire Spirit, he had boundless prospects, but he had used all his good luck up and died inside.

After everyone was done, Chen Xiang left following Gu Dongchen and the others. Others who were at the summit also left flying. What Chen Xiang found funny was that he was truly going to be fighting with Lanlan, that little girl; he was also feeling a little pressure.

Lanlan was hell-bent on knocking Chen Xiang down. Furthermore, both had good relations. Had Chen Xiang not helped her, she would have ended up at the bottom. Chen Xiang could also not understand why Lanlan could only get so few while the others were able to get forty or fifty.

The fights were going to be held in a huge square inside the Divine Martial Palace. The stage had already been there from way back. At that time, many people would come to watch as it was the competition between Extreme State martial artists, moreover, between younger generation, all of whom were famous figures.

Lanlan had no small reputation in the Kings’ Mainland because she was from that mysterious and powerful Blue Blood Family. She was strong as well as cute. Many people were paying attention to her.

Mo Tian, he was shrouded in a veil of mystery. No one knew where he came from, all they knew was that he was extremely powerful and had been challenging all the famous younger generation experts of the Kings’ Mainland. He himself was a powerful King’s Vein martial artist.

Sun Xueren didn’t need any introduction. He was Wang Quan’s eldest apprentice. Rumour had it that he was a bloodthirsty killer and had a strange character; no one in the Divine Martial Palace could get along with him.

Chen Xiang was quite a famous figure in the Mortal World. Especially the fact that he had made fun of tycoons of many mainlands just recently. Furthermore, he was the champion of Kings’ Mainland alchemy tournament where he had demonstrated his illustrious alchemy technique. He himself was very strong and also, an apprentice of that old madman, Huang Jintian, allowing him to cultivate in Tai Chi Subduing Dragon Exercise, so on and so forth.

Therefore, this last round was worth watching, for all four were equal in strength as well as in fame. If they clashed with each other, what would be the result? Everyone was filled with anticipation.

King’s Martial Arts Assembly was sponsored by the Divine Martial Place. As the organizers, they had even taken out the Fruit of Fortune as a reward. At first, Wang Quan’s plan was let his own apprentice compete, but who would have thought that they would actually die. This matter had also turned into a joke and spread far and wide in the King’s Mainland.

“Young Martial Uncle, you are really formidable! You actually know how to arrange arrays!” said Gu Dongchen with a smile, looking at Chen Xiang gobbling up the sumptuous dishes on the table like Wolves and Tigers. There was a skeptical look in his eyes when looking at Chen Xiang.

Wu Kaiming was also skeptical about it. Chen Xiang’s time was invested in cultivation as well as in alchemy, where would he have the time to learn arranging arrays? Although Gu Dongchen and Wu Kaiming didn’t know how to forge weapons or refine dans, they were well versed in arrays; otherwise, they would have lived in vain, because arranging the arrays was not as complex as forging weapons or refining dans. As long as one spent a bit of time and effort in it, familiarize themselves with the spirit patterns, and also exchanged pointers a bit, everyone could learn it.

“How about we make a bet? If I can arrange it, each of you will give me a billion crystal stones, okay?” proposed Chen Xiang mischievously.

Gu Dongchen and Wu Kaiming didn’t dignify it with a response. They knew that Chen Xiang would not bet unless he was sure of his win.

“Tell us the truth, did you kill Wang Quan’s other two treasured apprentices?” Gu Dongchen was extremely curious regarding this.

“Of course not!” Chen Xiang said, smiling, “If I had killed them, I would also act like Mo Tian did and anger that Wang Quan. Unfortunately, I didn’t have the luck to encounter his apprentices.”

Chen Xiang was too lazy to tell them the truth. Until he had obtained the Fruit of Fortune, he absolutely could not divulge this matter.

“You have so many demon hearts, how are you planning on using them? How about you give them to us to layout arrays. We have only heard of this kind of things, but never got to see! We never got any demon heart by killing those guys in the One Hundred Thousand Devil Mountains, all of them are were a bunch of ants,” said Gu Dongchen with a smile.

“Even among brothers accounts should be settled without ambiguity. One hundred million for each. After all, I got them by putting my life on the line! If even a single crystal stone is missing, I will not sell,” after Chen Xiang got to know of the fearsome part of arrays, he realized the specialty of these demon hearts; they were a lot better than top-grade crystal stones when they were used to arrange the arrays.

Having eaten full, Chen Xiang returned to his room to rest. After spending so many days in the mysterious realm, he was really tired. He wanted to maintain his peak state in order to participate in the final round.

As long as he could get the Fruit of Fortune, Bai Youyou, that frosty and aloof beauty would give him a kiss, so would Su Meiyao. This was the strongest motivation for him to get the Fruit of Fortune.

“I don’t know much about Lanlan as well as the Blue Blood Family. Little Bald only told me that they are all very powerful King’s Vein martial artist. As for their ability, he is not sure as well,” said Chen Xiang as frown crept up on his brows.
