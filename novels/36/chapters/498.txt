Chapter 499 Bloody Saber-Teethed Tiger

Without any consideration, Chen Xiang walked towards the gate of city wall. Right now, he was in a hurry to find Xue Xianxian and Leng Youlan.

“Kid, are you sure you want to go in?” a guard said suddenly.

“Of course, what’s wrong? Could it be that the Academy no longer accepts students?” Chen Xiang stopped walking.

“Don’t you know that the passage is the hardest one? Those less difficult passages have all been closed, because the Demon Subduing Academy has already recruited enough students. If anyone wants to enter later, he or she can only go through the most difficult passage!” The guard sneered.

“Got it!” Chen Xiang replied. He did not care about it at all, but strode over.

“You will definitely fail if you take this path. No one has been able to pass through it successfully until now. Moreover, you’re alone. That passageway is originally reserved for those teams with the team consciousness to take.” The guard said again.

Chen Xiang scratched his head, “this is the only way for me to enter the Demon Subduing Academy, right?”

“Exactly!”

"Then I have to take it. Stop talking nonsense and watch your door carefully.” Chen Xiang curled his lips and leaped towards the small door under the city wall.

Chen Xiang did not feel anything inside except for a wave of cool breeze. He was not afraid of it at all right now. Instead, he was looking forward to it because he wanted to test the might of the White Tiger Divine Weapon, the Hand of God of Slaughter. The harder the challenge was, the more possible for him to test the might of the White Tiger Divine Weapon.

After walking in, Chen Xiang immediately became vigilant. He quickly reached the end without encountering any dangers, which caused him to doubt. Previously, the guard had said that this place was like the hell, but now it was so calm.

“Could it be behind this door?” Chen Xiang touched the thick stone door and slowly pushed it open.

Pushing open the stone door, Chen Xiang saw a dazzling white light before him. He walked out of the stone door and arrived at a circular arena surrounded by high walls. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

This made him feel like he was in a colosseum. However, this colosseum was very large and was several hundred meters wide. It was enveloped by a very powerful formation.

"Dang, dang, dang.” A bell suddenly rang out, and someone cried out in alarm, “someone is coming, someone is walking through the death passage again!”

Chen Xiang frowned as he looked around, but he did not see anything. He could only see that there were many people on the high walls. They were all good looking, and their faces were all filled with expressions of amusement as they chatted with their companions.

The colosseum was used to please people. Sometimes, it was a fight between beasts, and sometimes, it was a battle between humans and beasts. Generally, it was a battle between divine sense.

“That formation is so powerful. It’s very difficult to get in from the top or from the bottom.” Long Xueyi said.

Chen Xiang stood in the middle of the colosseum. He looked at the people standing on the high walls, searching for his familiar face. However, he didn’t see any of them.

“Is that Chen Xiang? I’ve seen him fighting in a martial art contest on the King’s Continent. He’s really amazing!” A man suddenly shouted.

Chen Xiang! This name was extremely well-known in the Mortal Martial Realm, especially among the younger generation. This was because Chen Xiang was a peak existence among the younger generation. Regardless of whether it was in terms of alchemy or strength, it was extremely difficult to not know him.

“It’s really Chen Xiang! I did not expect that he would come to the Demon Subduing Academy. This guy must have been in closed door cultivation.”

“He’s really working hard in a closed door cultivation all day, no wonder he’s so strong!”

“Is this the strongest young man in the Mortal Martial Realm? I’d like to see how good he is!” A young man dressed in luxurious clothing said.

“Hehe, you are from another world. You have never seen his martial arts with your own eyes, so you can’t feel his power!”

“...”

At this moment, everyone was discussing the famous Chen Xiang, especially when they found out that Chen Xiang had turned the Fire God Shrine’s most powerful young man into a meat patty two or three months ago, they couldn’t help but sigh with emotion.

“He’s facing a Profound Beast whose strength is almost in the Second Rank of Profound Beast. The previous team of eight were defeated quickly. Can he pass alone?” A man said.

“That’s hard to say. That profound beast is indeed very strong. Even though it is only a First Rank Profound Beast, several Spirit Marital Realm martial artists could not defeat it. However, Chen Xiang can always do some amazing things.”

Chen Xiang suddenly caught this part of the conversation. He knew that he was facing a dangerous situation, and it was actually a powerful First Rank Profound Beast!

He looked at a huge black iron door on the stone wall. He guessed that the Profound Beast was hiding behind that big black iron door.

The iron gate opened and a wave of killing intent rushed out. However, Chen Xiang did not see any profound beasts. He only saw a white bearded old man slowly walking out.

“Hehe, are you Young Hero Chen?” The old man asked. The Demon Subduing Academy must have heard of what Chen Xiang did in the Mortal Martial Realm. Moreover, Chen Xiang was the person they paid the most attention to. Although he had a grudge with many sects, he was forced to do so from his perspective.

Of course, the most important factor was that Chen Xiang was wanted by the Demon God Token of the Demon World, and the Demon Subduing Academy knew everything about the Demon World. When they found out that a kid from the Mortal World was wanted by such a rank, they were all incomparably shocked, because only someone angered the Demon God would he or she be wanted by the Demon God Token.

Thus, from the perspective of the Demon Subduing Academy, Chen Xiang must have committed an act of offending a demon god. Even the immortals of the Heaven Realm would find it difficult to accomplish such an act.

Chen Xiang shrugged his shoulders and said, “Yes. It seems like I must defeat you to enter the Demon Subduing Academy, right?”

The white-mustached old man laughed, “do you think you can win against me?”

“Of course not, but I can burn your white beard.”

The old man subconsciously stroke his white beard. He smiled and said, “you are just as the rumors say. You really are an arrogant fellow! I am not your component. The big guy behind me is.”

As soon as the old man’s voice fell, a shocking tiger’s roar suddenly rang out. It reverberated throughout the huge circular colosseum like thunder exploding beside Chen Xiang’s ears. That killing intent also filled the colosseum.

After the roar, a giant tiger that looked like a giant elephant came out. Its entire body was blood-red. It shew two giant teeth and slowly walked out. Each step caused the ground to shake, making “peng, peng, peng" sounds, which was extremely terrifying.

“It appeared! The Bloody Saber-Teethed Tiger!” A man screamed.

The Bloody Saber-Teethed Tiger! It was a very brutal type of demon beast that could grow up! This kind of demon beast was also the most terrifying. A demon beast that transformed into a profound beast. It could be imagined how many lives it had killed.

It had been a long time since Chen Xiang lastly fought with such a giant creature. However, he had not even a tiny bit of fear at all, which caused many people to admire him. Previously, there were also some people who took this route, but after seeing the huge Bloody Saber-Teethed Tiger, the majority of them left. Only a few teams dared to try and challenge it.

“Are you sure you want to fight this big guy? Ain’t you afraid of death?” The long-bearded old man asked with a smile.

Chen Xiang smiled, “are you sure you want it to duel with me? Ain’t you afraid of its death?”

“Such an arrogant kid. Since that’s the case, I want to see just what kind of capabilities you have!” The old man gently leaped into the air and stood on top of the high wall, overlooking the colosseum. "
