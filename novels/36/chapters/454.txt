Apparently, the old man appeared to have already foreseen Chen Xiang and Hua Xiangyue’s arrival. Therefore, he wasn’t taken by surprise a bit. Chen Xiang and Hua Xiangyue, on the other hand, could not comprehend as to why there was someone here, in this enclosed space for many years?

At first, Hua Xiangyue thought that this old man was the Dan King Li Tianjun. However, Chen Xiang knew the Li Tianjun had already gone to the Heavenly Realm. Even Wu Canghong knew him.

“Who are you?” asked Chen Xiang, vigilance clearly written on his face. He and Hua Xiangyue just couldn’t see through this old man’s strength.

The elderly was wearing an old and worn dress. Nonetheless, he was dressed very neatly. Also, there was an amiable smile on his face as he replied, “I am someone who has been waiting for you!”

Only at this time did Chen Xiang and Hua Xiangyue came to notice that the place which was full of spirit herbs was protected by an array, and a very powerful one at that.

Deep as the herb garden under the earth was, this place was just like a mysterious realm; one could see the blue sky.

“Why have you been waiting for us here?” asked Chen Xiang, once more.

“Since the time this herb garden was built, I have been waiting for you! Right, this herb garden was built by my teacher. I have been looking after it for a very long time, I have already forgotten as to how many years had passed,” said the old man, a smile still on his face.

Chen Xiang and Hua Xiangyue were shocked, once more. To their surprise, this old man was Dan King Li Tianjun’s apprentice.

“No need to worry, you can get these herbs, however, you have to pass the test!” the old man stated.

Chen Xiang and Hua Xiangyue glanced at each other momentarily before Chen Xiang asked, “What test?”

Noticing that Chen Xiang and Hua Xiangyue were tightly holding each other’s hand, the old man asked doubtfully, “Are you husband and wife? Or brother and sisters? The gap between your strength is too big! Only if the man is stronger than the woman, it’s justifiable!”

Chen Xiang cracked a smile and said, “That’s right, we are husband and wife!”

“Hei hei, Kid, don’t lie to me! Although I may not have exited this place for many years, the outside world should not have gone through such tremendous changes!” That old man shook his head, smiling.

Hua Xiangyue rolled her eyes at Chen Xiang as she let go of Chen Xiang’s hand and said, “He and I are just friends. What’s the test exactly? If it’s dangerous, we won’t do it!”

“It’s not dangerous, all you have to do is compete with me in alchemy. You can use the spirit herbs in this herb garden for the competition. Furthermore, you have to refine the dan which I tell you to! Only when you have passed my test will you have the qualifications to have this herb garden. This isn’t too much, right?” the old man said, looking at Hua Xiangyue.

He was secretly astounded by the fire energy emanating from Hua Xiangyue’s body. He could see that Hua Xiangyue was a very powerful flame expert. Furthermore, she was extremely powerful. Evidently, she was a high-level alchemist.

As for Chen Xiang, he was completely disregarded by the elder. This put Chen Xiang ill at ease.

“No problem! However, your rules can’t be too harsh, you can’t ask me to refine an immortal dan, okay!” said Hua Xiangyue.

The elderly nodded his acknowledgment and asked, “What the highest level of dan you can refine?”

“Middle-grade Heaven-level dan!” Hua Xiangyue said, dismissively. But this shocked the hell out of Chen Xiang and that elderly. From the beginning, Chen Xiang believed that Hua Xiangyue’s limit should be a low-grade Heaven-level dan, because the one who could refine a middle-grade Heaven-level dan was a Dan Ancestor.

Just one level above the Dan Ancestor was Dan King, and that was the limit of the mortal world alchemists. Although there was only a gap of one level between Dan King and Dan Ancestor, it was rarely used in the mortal world. Even if one could refine high-grade Heaven-level dan, one would still be referred to as Dan Ancestor.

More importantly, Hua Xiangyue was a female, a young, beautiful, and very powerful female. She had very bright prospects.

“Very good! I will lay down the rules to you, and then, I will compete with you!” At this moment, the old man was extremely excited. Back then, his teacher had asked him to remain here and he had given his promise. However, having been stayed here alone for many years, he was bored to death. It was rare for someone to come here.

The old man had been delving in alchemy all day. And now that he had met a strong opponent, of course, he would want to test himself against Hua Xiangyue.

“Senior, are you Dan King Li Tianjun’s apprentice? Can I please have your good name!” asked Chen Xiang. He also wanted to compete with this old man. It was impossible for him to play with high-level dan, but if it was a profound-level dan, he was very confident. After all, he was labeled as the top youngest alchemist of the Mortal Martial World.

The old man nodded as he answered, “I was adopted by my teacher, so, I have my teacher’s surname. My name is Li Baojun, what about yours?”

“Chen Xiang!”

“Hua Xiangyue!”

Li Baojun continued, “Don’t worry, I won’t ask you to compete with me in refining Heaven-level dan. Refining that kind of dan depends a lot on luck. Furthermore, we can’t see your level using that kind of competition. What’s more, it needs a lot of time and wastes far too many herbs.”

“Senior Li, I don’t want to say this but that map was found by me! I think both of us should be tested! I have also learned alchemy for ten years,” stated Chen Xiang.

Li Baojun simply had not expected Chen Xiang, this little rascal to compete in alchemy. He could see that Chen Xiang was very young, and very weak as well. According to his estimation, Chen Xiang should be thirty to forty years old, and definitely, nowhere good in alchemy.

Hua Xiangyue had discovered that Li Baojun was underestimating Chen Xiang and was also secretly dissatisfied with him. She very much admired Chen Xiang’s alchemy. If it was a competition of refining low-level dan, she would candidly admit defeat.

“Indeed, it was him who brought me with him, if we got this herb garden, whether he shares with me or not completely depends on his mood!” Hua Xiangyue said, a smile on her lips.

Li Baojun furrowed his white brows. He felt that this world has changed too much. To his surprise, an ant-like kid could order a woman who was extremely good, strength wise and alchemy wise, both. Furthermore, this woman was still as beautiful as a flower, as heavenly as a fairy. He could not help but think that there was something wrong with Hua Xiangyue’s head.

Nonetheless, Li Baojun was a principled man. The herb garden had to be handed out. But only those who could pass the test would have the qualifications to have this herb garden.

“Very well, I am a bit reluctant but I will allow you two to compete with me, I alone will compete with you two! If you can’t defeat me, you don’t deserve to have this herb garden!” said Li Baojun.

There were many spirit herbs in the herb garden. The highest ranked were high-grade earth-level herbs, and the lowest level of herbs were still for refining True Elemental Dan, White Jade Dan, and other similar dans. Furthermore, there were also herbs for refining Building Foundation Dan, Five Elements True Elemental Dan, Life Elemental Dan, and many other low-grade profound-level dans. There were also some herbs for middle-grade and high-grade profound-level dans, but not much. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Don’t worry, the competition will be very fair! If you won two out of three games, then, victory will be yours. The side which won two rounds first would be the winner! Kid, what is the highest level of dan you can refine?” Li Baojun asked.

Chen Xiang replied, “Low-grade profound-level!”

Li Baojun was stupefied. From the beginning, he believed that what Chen Xiang could refine at most was high-grade spirit-level dan. But he didn’t expect him to enter this level at his age. Of course, it was not that such people didn’t exist, it was just that they were very rare.

In this huge Mortal Martial World, there weren’t many people who could refine low-grade profound-level dan at Chen Xiang’s age.

“Wait, I just thought of a better way to compete, it will guarantee the fairness, and at the same time, it will allow us to display our alchemy level!” stated Li Baojun.
