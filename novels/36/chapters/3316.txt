"Little bastard, I’ll let you experience your great strength. Read the full text of the latest chapter "

Yun Rong’s face revealed a sinister look, he quickly rushed forward like an angry wolf, his eyes turning red and his hands also looking like wolf claws.

In the blink of an eye, Yun Rong had already leapt over, her claws grabbing towards Chen Xiang fiercely, as though wanting to tear him apart, she let out waves of pitch-black mist.

"Good heavens!" Chen Xiang stepped forward, and very ingeniously retreated to avoid it.

Yun Rong’s claws moved extremely quickly, up and down, left and right, constantly wanting to grab onto Chen Xiang’s vitals. However, when Chen Xiang dodged, his body was extremely nimble, as if he was moving his body very casually, causing Yun Rong to not be able to grab onto his clothes.

"This is Yun Rong’s Shun Qian Wolf Claw!" One of them said: "Yun Rong’s strongest technique, but it’s already been so long, yet he’s still unable to injure Chen Xiang." Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Everyone was shocked. Even without the World Defying Stage Fierce Soul, Chen Xiang’s movements were still extremely nimble ... This made them feel that it was inconceivable, because the current Chen Xiang didn’t look like someone who had lost his World Defying Stage Fierce Soul at all.

Yes, not only had Chen Xiang not lost his World Defying Stage Fierce Soul, he had gained more, so his reaction was even faster, and he had more control over his body.

"Shun Qian Wolf Claw? "It’s nothing more than that!" Chen Xiang laughed in ridicule, with the release of his palms, he quickly pushed out, and a vast shaking power suddenly appeared.

Bang!

The vibrating power exploded out in an instant, and a series of explosions sounded. Even the ground was shattered from the impact.

Yun Rong was still using his poisonous claws, but the shock wave suddenly struck him, catching him off guard. He could only use both of his arms to block, but who knew that the shock wave would actually be stronger than what he expected.

When he knew that this power wasn’t something he could defend against, it was already too late. His arms were already affected by the shockwave, and crackling sounds could be heard as his arms broke inch by inch.

Puff!

When the shock wave hit Yun Rong’s body, he only saw Yun Rong spurt out a mouthful of blood and then fall onto the ground.

"Chen Xiang, your World Defying Stage Fierce Soul ...." Yun Rong said with a face full of shock, "Your World Defying Stage Fierce Soul is still here!"

"This old man has never said that my World Defying Stage Fierce Soul was swallowed." Chen Xiang laughed coldly: "It’s just that people like you think so yourself."

"Impossible!" Huang Ziyun shouted in a loud voice, his face filled with disbelief and unwillingness: "It’s impossible that your World Defying Stage Fierce Soul is still here, no one has ever been able to reach the power of the Soul Swallowing Mountain."

Lei Yichen frowned. He had never heard of someone capable of resisting the power of the Soul Swallowing Mountain, but Chen Xiang had.

"Now you know that someone can do it!" Chen Xiang looked at Huang Ziyun and said, "What, you still want to punish me?"

"You ... "You are a cruel and merciless person who harmed a fellow sect member. I will absolutely not allow you to enter the inner court." Huang Ziyun said angrily: "Look at Yun Rong, he was heavily injured by you, this is just an ordinary exchange of pointers, yet you are so vicious."

Lei Yichen said angrily: "Huang Ziyun, you are done! Just now, everyone saw Yun Rong using a claw infused with poison. If he catches you, you know the consequences even better than I do! Why didn’t you say that Yun Rong is malicious? For Yun Rong to use such a vicious move in battle, if he does not attack more heavily, he will have the chance to counterattack, which is reasonable. "

"Huang Ziyun, I have already told the Leader about your crimes, don’t think that the Leader would ignore you when you’re in the outer sect. I know that your grandson has crippled many good seedlings, and once the Leader has dealt with the matters of the inner sect, it will be your time to be cleaned up."

After hearing all these, Huang Ziyun’s face revealed a trace of fear. He was so scared that his face turned white, and did not dare say more.

"According to the rules of the Ancient Fire Divine Sect, only by possessing the strength of a Aoshi Holy Stage can one become an inner disciple of the Ancient Fire Divine Sect. Chen Xiang has not reached that level yet, so he naturally cannot become an inner disciple! But as an elder of the inner sect, I have the authority to choose disciples from the outer sect. I can bring my disciples into the inner sect, and when he steps into the World Defying crazy realm, I can righteously become an inner sect disciple.

Lei Yichen was even more determined to take Chen Xiang as his disciple. After all these years, this was the disciple he was most satisfied with.

"Lei Yichen, don’t be complacent, humph!" Huang Ziyun spat out fiercely and left.

Lei Yichen heaved a sigh of relief, if they, the clan elders were to fight here, they would be punished.

"Let’s go!" Lei Yichen patted Chen Xiang’s shoulder. Then, he brought Chen Xiang and left this place, heading towards a distant mountain. That was the place where the inner disciples would gather.

Chen Xiang followed behind and looked in the direction that Qin Shuang had gone before.

"I wonder how Xiao Shuangshuang is doing!" Chen Xiang thought.

Lei Yichen brought Chen Xiang and walked on the road. Right now, he was in a very good mood, because he could find such an outstanding disciple.

"Hey, I don’t want to be your disciple." Chen Xiang suddenly said. Why? If you don’t want to become my disciple, then why did you follow me here? " Lei Yichen panicked and asked.

"I’ll follow you into the inner sect and take a look!" Chen Xiang laughed: "If I have this chance, of course I won’t miss it."

"Do you think I’m not worthy to be your master?" Lei Yichen felt that Chen Xiang had a very unique personality. If it was anyone else, they would have immediately taken him as their master, but Chen Xiang did not.

"That’s not true. The main reason is that I had a master before." Although the Huang Jintian that Chen Xiang spoke of did not really teach him much in the future, in his eyes, Huang Jintian was still a "virtuous and respected" master.

"That doesn’t matter. On the long road of cultivation, there are many places that you have been to, many people that you have met, many things that you have experienced, and many masters that you have paid respects to." Lei Yichen laughed: "Don’t worry, after you enter the inner sect, I guarantee that no one will bully you again."

"I’m actually worried that I might be a burden to you." Chen Xiang curled his lips: "I have enemies in the inner court, the kind that I can’t live with."

Lei Yichen was a good person, although he was a tall and sturdy handsome middle age man, he was extremely gentle and friendly, and did not give others any pressure.

"You still have enemies in the inner sect? How many are there? " Lei Yichen frowned: "You have just entered the Ancient Fire Divine Sect not long ago, how did you already have enemies?"

"Because I discovered the Ancient Fire Divine Sect together with my enemies and they entered it together, their strengths were much stronger than mine, so they entered the inner sect ... "You’re an inner court elder, you surely know that a group of inner court disciples have come during this time." Chen Xiang said.

"It’s actually them!" They are all very outstanding disciples! The blood of Fierce Saber Race and the rest contain a very mysterious power that can turn their body parts into blades, and can even separate them from their bodies. Then, add on some materials to make their blades even stronger. "

"The other is the Soul River Divine Race. They live in the World Defying Stage Fierce Soul and are born with a sense of camaraderie towards it ... Oh right, there is another World Defying holy dragon that is very strong, is this also your enemy? "

"World Defying holy dragon is my friend. Is he okay inside the inner sect?" anxiously asked. World Defying holy dragon were special, he was worried about them, since they had the Tao-creation Divine Crystals on them. Even in Ancient Fire Divine Sect, the Holy Crystals were extremely precious.
