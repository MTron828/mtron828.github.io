Feng Ke’er was currently asking Feng Ke’er. Feng Ke’er felt that it was enough, and he needed to use a large number of Dao crystal s, but luckily he had a lot of them. As long as he got rid of the two people who grabbed him, they could begin.

Ji Xingyuan was still fighting in the distance, and was so angry that he had already lost all reason. The group of people only wanted to capture him alive, then use Chen Xiang to force him to open the door.

Chen Xiang knew that Ji Xingyuan was simply unable to open it. In the past few days, he had gotten along with Ji Xingyuan, and their relationship was very good. He was an extremely good uncle, and now that Ji Xingyuan was putting his life on the line for him, he was very touched.

"Although I am very weak, I am more than enough to kill you two old dogs." As soon as Chen Xiang finished speaking, the old lady and the old man felt that their hands were suddenly empty. Just a moment ago, they were still holding onto Chen Xiang, but why did Chen Xiang suddenly disappear?

When they finally reacted, they saw a very small bug flying around. They were suddenly awakened by the sound. The little ghost they caught just now had turned into a bug, making them feel that something was off. They never knew this method existed!

Chen Xiang was only unable to release the power of the Myriad Tao, but it could change his body and circulate within his body, thus he was able to use the Transformation Technique.

He turned into a bug and struggled out of the demonic claws of the two old things, then immediately released his Heavenly magic sword. He controlled the Heavenly magic sword to slash the two old things into pieces.

"Uncle, leave quickly!" Chen Xiang suddenly roared, and then, his expression changed to: He took out the Dao God Mirror and pressed it against the stone door. The entire stone mountain began to tremble, producing bursts of roars.

Ji Xingyuan, who was in the middle of an intense battle, was already covered in blood. When he heard Chen Xiang’s roar, he suddenly came back to reality and looked towards the cave, only to realize that there were some broken corpses on the ground. He was overjoyed, as he knew that it was Chen Xiang who used a Heavenly magic sword to kill those two old things.

The mountain was trembling, such a huge disturbance was discovered by the group of people surrounding Ji Xingyuan, they saw the huge door that had been sealed for countless years burst out with white light, and at the same time, they were shocked, they had already flown over.

They hadn’t thought that this little kid, who didn’t seem like much to them, would be able to open the stone door that had been bothering them for so many years.

"All of you, just you wait!" Ji Xingyuan saw Chen Xiang passing through the stone door that was shining with a white light, then taking large strides and running away, leaving the forest.

When the group of people arrived at the entrance, everything returned to normal. As they looked at the two crushed rocks, their hearts were even more shocked. That brat actually killed two of them and even took their heads away.

"Damned brat, we’ve underestimated him." As one of the red-clothed men spoke, he crazily struck the stone gate. The others were all floating in the air, constantly attacking the mountain, but not harming it in the slightest.

... ....

After Chen Xiang entered, he felt a sense of familiarity, as if he had entered into a secret inheritance array and entered into a white space.

"Is there anyone here?" He shouted softly. This made him feel as if he had entered an inheritance secret array. When he first entered the inheritance secret array, he also felt the same way.

"It’s you!" A semi-transparent old man suddenly appeared. When he saw Chen Xiang, it was as if he had seen a ghost.

Chen Xiang couldn’t help but laugh when he saw the expression on Half-ghost Old Man’s face. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

"Half-ghost Old Man, we meet again!" Chen Xiang said with a smile.

"You’re the ghost. You, why do I always see you?" Half-ghost Old Man didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

"This is all fate!" Chen Xiang laughed: "This should be the third time I see you, the first two times I was in the inheritance secret array, but this time it’s not."

Half-ghost Old Man nodded: "That’s right! You will grow up quickly, but with your current strength, you shouldn’t be able to enter the No Tao Place, right? Summoning the Door of the Pathless is an extremely difficult task. Back then, I also used quite a bit of strength to do so, and I also reached a very strong realm at that time. "

"It was all an accident that I was able to come in here." Chen Xiang laughed bitterly, then simply told the matter to Half-ghost Old Man.

"So that’s how it is. No wonder you were able to come to No Tao Place." When Half-ghost Old Man heard this, he dispelled the doubt in his heart, "Right now, Divine Wasteland is really not at peace. Heaven Old Orcs actually came to Divine Wasteland, sigh ..."

"Did the Heaven Old Orcs do this to destroy the Divine Wasteland?" Chen Xiang asked.

"Of course not, I don’t know what their motive is, but they have it anywhere, and it’s even more rampant now." Half-ghost Old Man said, "It’s not bad that you were able to come here."

Chen Xiang told the Half-ghost Old Man about the situation outside of the cave, and laughed: "Is your real name Wang Dao?"

"Of course it’s true! Old Ji is still staying here. I originally wanted to help him, but I didn’t expect that the moment I broke through, he would draw me into the Myriad Tao! The remnant souls I left behind can only survive in certain spaces. I didn’t leave behind any method to allow old Ji to enter. " Wang Dao sighed. "Right now, I can’t help him either."

"I can!" Chen Xiang laughed: "Uncle said that you broke through by refining pills, right? I can also refine pills, and I can refine World Defying heavenly Dan now. "

"Oh?" Wang Dao was slightly shocked, "You little brat, you are powerful! If that’s the case, I’ll give you a pill formula and some medicinal ingredients. At that time, you have to let Old Ji eat first, let him break through, and then you can eat by yourself. It’s not good for him to stay in that place for too long.

"Alright, I promise you!" Chen Xiang laughed: "Hurry up and take out those medicinal ingredients, I will refine them here!"

"Brat, you need to be a bit careful when refining it because you might die if you mess it up." Wang Dao cautiously told Chen Xiang, his expression also very serious.

"Will he die?" Chen Xiang was shocked, "Is it that serious? I might even die! "

"I found these medicinal ingredients in this No Tao Place. They will connect to your soul during the refinement process, and if you fail, it will affect your soul. If it’s serious, it will cause your soul to scatter." Wang Dao said, "Because this pill contains a very crazy and mysterious power, it’s very special. It’s different from the pills you’ve refined before."

"Un, I understand!" Chen Xiang also felt that it was scary.

"As long as you remember, your potential to refine pills is not bad. In the future, when you can climb up to Myriad Tao, we can discuss it." Wang Dao laughed.

"Oh yes, do you know the Myriad Tao Dan God?" Chen Xiang asked: "I had thought that all of you were the same person!"

"I do, he’s called Wang Sheng, he has the same surname as me and is a pretty good Alchemist, but he’s already dead." Wang Dao’s words stunned Chen Xiang. Myriad Tao Dan God was actually dead.

"How did he die?" Chen Xiang was not lightly hit, Myriad Tao Dan God was someone he respected a lot.
