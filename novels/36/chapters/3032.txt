Feng Ke’er crossed her arms in front of her chest as she looked at Chen Xiang suspiciously, as if she couldn’t really believe Chen Xiang’s words. Although she looked simple, she still knew how to think.

"Earlier, you said that you were curious and came in because you discovered something. From what you said just now, you seemed to have a purpose in coming in. Something’s not right with you." Feng Ke’er said...

"Maybe I didn’t understand!" Chen Xiang was startled, and said.

"Fine, since you do not have any malicious intent, otherwise, I would have sealed you a long time ago. My sealing power is extremely powerful." Feng Ke’er laughed angrily: "Oh right, what enmity do you have with those fellows?"

Chen Xiang never thought that Feng Ke’er would change his plans so quickly. He was suspicious and vigilant, yet in the blink of an eye, he had become so relaxed.

"They wanted my things. Since I refused to give them mine, they came to snatch it away. I killed their people, so I ended up forming a hatred with them." Chen Xiang spread out his hands, and said helplessly: "I don’t feel like making enemies out of them, but they relied on their immense power, and wanted to take my things for themselves, that’s why I resisted."

Feng Ke’er hurriedly nodded his head: "That’s what these people are like. They caught me to get something, I won’t let them succeed."

What do the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain and the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain want? From this, it could be seen that this thing was extremely precious, and Chen Xiang couldn’t help but think of the Myriad Tao’s treasure.

Feng Ke’er herself was already extremely mysterious, and did not look like a simple living being. She was even well versed in sealing, knew about all sorts of powerful formations, and from her name, one could tell that she was related in that aspect.

"What do they want?" Chen Xiang asked quickly.

"The precious treasure of the Myriad Tao!" Feng Ke’er directly said it out loud, making him want to cover her mouth with his hands. For such an important thing, she was actually shouting loudly.

"Shh!" Chen Xiang said in a low voice: "Myriad Tao’s treasures are extremely precious, it’s not good for you to speak about it so loudly."

"I know, but I’m not afraid." Feng Ke’er floated in the air, holding her waist with both hands, looking at her proud and complacent look, Chen Xiang could only sigh.

"I never thought that the Myriad Tao treasure they wanted to obtain would actually be related to you." Chen Xiang said: "I had heard earlier that World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect and Myriad Tao Divine Mountain were going to discuss this matter together."

Chen Xiang had indeed not expected him to get involved in this matter so quickly. He had thought that he would have to wait a few months to see more, but now, he had come into contact with the matter of the Myriad Tao’s treasure so early.

"It’s not that easy to obtain the Myriad Tao’s treasures. Although the Myriad Tao’s treasures are in the hands of the World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect, they are unable to use them, and even unable to open them." Feng Ke’er said: "Without me, the Myriad Tao’s treasure is just a piece of trash."

"Why can only you use it?" Chen Xiang asked again.

"Because I am Feng Ke’er ... Originally, the Myriad Tao’s treasure was sealed away, and I am the sealing great formation that seals it away. However, because of how much time has passed, I managed to cultivate it to its essence. " Feng Ke’er pouted her small mouth, looking extremely cute, she humphed and said: "God knows when I was sleeping, I was suddenly pushed down by a force and fell down to this damned place from above Myriad Tao."

Chen Xiang looked at this seal that had cultivated to the Exquisite Realm, his face was filled with astonishment. It was his first time seeing a seal or formation that had cultivated to the Essence Realm.

Feng Ke’er was truly powerful, just a moment ago, if Chen Xiang was slightly slower, she would have sealed him with the formation!

"Did it fall from Myriad Tao? That Myriad Tao treasure was created by someone else? " Chen Xiang knew that there were some strong warriors above Myriad Tao, such as the Myriad Tao Dan God.

"I also feel that it’s very strange, who exactly took down the Myriad Tao’s treasure from above." Feng Ke’er frowned, her face was filled with thought.

"Then what is the appearance of the Myriad Tao’s treasure? Is it a divine tool? " Chen Xiang felt that Feng Ke’er would definitely know about it. He, who was extremely curious about the Myriad Tao’s treasure, would definitely want to ask.

"No, it’s just a lump of mud, but it’s a treasure. That lump of mud can be used to refine the powerful Myriad Tao Divine Weapon! Or perhaps you could turn the Divine Weapon that you originally possessed into a Myriad Tao Divine Weapon. " Feng Ke’er laughed in a low voice: "Do you want to?"

"This is a good thing, of course I want to, but it seems like I won’t be able to get it, it should be in World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect, I cannot enter." Chen Xiang said.

"It’s in the World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect, but it’s sealed inside a big rock. Only I know where he’ll run off to, and only I can get it. Do you need my help to get it?" Feng Ke’er said.

Chen Xiang felt that things were not so simple. Feng Ke’er had only just met him, and he already said that he would help him obtain the Myriad Tao’s treasure.

"Is this true?" Chen Xiang was in disbelief.

"Of course it’s true, but there are conditions." Feng Ke’er said: "After you obtain the Myriad Tao’s treasure, you must help me find something here. That thing is extremely useful to me."

"What is it?" Chen Xiang could not think of anything that could make the little demon girl, who came from above Myriad Tao, pay so much attention.

"I’m looking for an indestructible stone." Feng Ke’er giggled, then took out a golden needle, and said: "As long as this needle can’t be inserted into it, it’s indestructible."

"Is this golden needle really that powerful?" No matter how Chen Xiang looked at it, this golden needle was ordinary. He took out a blade, which could be considered a strong godly weapon.

"Fine, I’ll give it a try!" Feng Ke’er lightly pricked the blade with his golden needle and it actually went through the blade in an instant.

Seeing this, Chen Xiang was shocked, that golden needle was too terrifying, even though he was using the full force of the Heavenly magic sword, he could barely get the blade in, but the golden needle was pierced through easily.

That blade could be considered to be broken, but fortunately, he did not lack this kind of thing!

"I don’t believe it!" Chen Xiang said: "Did you use some sort of power?"

"If you don’t believe me, you can give it a try yourself!" Feng Ke’er gave the golden needle to Chen Xiang.

After Chen Xiang received it, he immediately stabbed it into the blade. It was as easy as stabbing tofu, in an instant he pierced it, and then he stabbed more than 10 needles back and forth, easily piercing through the blade.

"This thing is really powerful!" Chen Xiang did not dare to go prick his Tianchuang furnace, because if it was broken, then he would be in deep trouble.

"Of course, although this thing is small, it is also very precious." After Feng Ke’er received it, he said: "Can you help me find an indestructible stone? If you promise to help me find it, then I promise to help you get the Myriad Tao’s treasure. " T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

"I promise, but I can’t guarantee that I’ll find it." Chen Xiang said. He felt that he could ask Xue Xianxian and the others about this, maybe they would know some way to find this stone.
