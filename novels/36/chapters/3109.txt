Colorful Balloons Take Flight

When Chen Xiang heard this, he heaved a sigh of relief, because he did not need to worry about this problem. He could release the power of space by himself, and he trained in the spatial laws.

"Let’s hurry up and leave." Ji Xingyuan withdrew the stones and then madly rushed out of the dark region along with Chen Xiang.

"Uncle, the last time I saw you, you were fighting with a wild boar. That boar looks pretty strong too." Chen Xiang asked: "What beast is that?"

"That’s still a Dark beast! Coming out of the dark area, once the Dark beast sees light, its power will decrease by half. " Ji Xingyuan laughed: "I purposely lured that guy out to play last time."

"Only half of it is weak when it sees light?" Chen Xiang felt that this was a pretty good way to deal with the Dark beast.

"Yes!" Ji Xingyuan looked around, and suddenly frowned: "There are people nearby!"

"Who is it?" Chen Xiang did not realize that he was not as good as Ji Xingyuan in this area because he could not use his mind power nor the power of space.

Ji Xingyuan often hunted beasts, so his perception was very sharp and he had much experience with them.

"These kinds of fellows usually lie in ambush here. If they see someone coming out while carrying the Dark beast’s corpse, they would snatch it away." Ji Xingyuan said: "These guys are all bandits, they are very unpopular in the Pathless City."

Ji Xingyuan was not actually afraid of these bandits, and swaggered forward with Chen Xiang.

They were not carrying Dark beast, so he was not afraid. Furthermore, Ji Xingyuan was very strong, even if he was carrying Dark beast, he was not afraid of these bandits.

Chen Xiang had thought that they would be able to leave very easily, because they were all empty-handed right now. However, these bandits still ran out.

There were a total of six bandits, and judging from the Qi on their bodies, they were all unscrupulous cultivators who were born and bred like Ji Xingyuan.

"We don’t have anything for you to steal." Ji Xingyuan said coldly. Although he did not want to cause trouble, he was not afraid of trouble.

"Nothing? We’ll let you guys be our followers. That should be fine, right? " The bandits were dressed in black, and their heads were covered. Their voices were extremely arrogant, and their appearances could not be seen.

Ji Xingyuan was very strong, but he was very low key, and his appearance was also normal, so he was not very famous. Otherwise, if these bandits knew of his strength, they would not have so arrogantly come to their deaths.

"Follower? What big words you have there, let’s see if you have the capability to do so! " After Ji Xingyuan finished speaking, he had already flashed behind the bandit, his palm struck out, and the powerful palm force tore apart the bandit’s mask. When his palm landed on the bandit’s head, his head was already smashed into a bloody mist.

From the palm force alone, they could tell that this unassuming middle-aged man was extremely powerful. They never thought that they would actually kick a steel board, and cursed Ji Xingyuan in their hearts. So powerful, to actually be so low-key, causing them to miss out on him.

"Big brother, I’m sorry. This bastard is the one who brought us to the wrong end of the road. We will definitely be able to turn over a new leaf in the future!" A bandit immediately fell to his knees, begging for mercy, kowtowing repeatedly.

"Humph, you guys should be loyal!" Ji Xingyuan laughed coldly: "Since that’s the case, I’ll teach you how to be loyal. Now, go and die with your boss!"

Hearing Ji Xingyuan’s words, the other bandits felt a chill in their hearts. Two of the bandits immediately flashed behind Chen Xiang, wanting to catch him, but who knew that Chen Xiang’s Heavenly magic sword would suddenly appear.

When the bandits who were still alive saw this, they trembled in fear. They did not expect that the young man who looked so weak would be so decisive when killing someone. He killed two of them in one go.

The reason why they were able to act so domineeringly was because they often succeeded. They had encountered many strong bandits before, and even if they couldn’t beat them, they would still be able to escape safely.

However, this was the first time they had encountered such a situation. In a short moment, their entire army had been wiped out!

Ji Xingyuan looked at the two robbers who were trembling from head to toe, and threw out a palm strike. Using his palm force, he pushed the heads of the two robbers into the ground, shattering their hearts and bones.

"Let’s go!" Ji Xingyuan left with Chen Xiang.

After returning to the riverside inside the Pathless City, Chen Xiang began to cut that giant bear. The bear skin was extremely tough, so Chen Xiang felt that it would definitely be good to use it for smithing.

"This giant bear should have some Beast Stones. Take a good look!" Ji Xingyuan said.

When Chen Xiang cut the bear’s flesh, he discovered quite a few very small stones inside. Each of them was only the size of a grain of rice, they were all black in color.

In the end, he managed to get more than five thousand pills.

"Is this more or less?" Chen Xiang handed over the beast stones to Ji Xingyuan.

"A lot! One catty of Dark beast meat is priced at ten beaststones, you can buy three hundred catties of fresh one here! Most Dark beast only have a few hundred beast stones in their body. " Ji Xingyuan said.

"So it’s like that!" This was the first time Chen Xiang had seen such a thing.

Ji Xingyuan said: "Keep it for yourself, you can eat these beasts’ stones. Eat it and you can absorb the mysterious energy, which will allow you to cultivate your immoral body even faster."

Chen Xiang put away the beast stone, then took the Giant Bear Meat into his room. He was going to start roasting meat. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

He only left after half a day. This time, he had more meat than last time, but he also spent the same amount of time as last time.

"Uncle, this time you just eat enough!" Chen Xiang laughed and took out a large pot of roasted meat for Ji Xingyuan.

Ji Xingyuan started to eat in big bites. This time, his and Chen Xiang’s harvest from going out was not small, the giant bear meat was around 2000 Jin, if he sold it he would be able to get a lot of beast stones.

"If I want to kill that bear myself, I will need at least two hours to tire him out. After that, I will be able to deal with him. However, I will be able to deal with him very soon when I am with you." In the past, Ji Xingyuan had never killed such a powerful Dark beast so easily.

The main reason why he was able to get away with it so easily was because Chen Xiang had used his Heavenly magic sword to break the defense of the Dark beast!

"I won’t eat it. Eat a little more, and if you continue to cultivate for a while longer, your body will be almost strong enough." Ji Xingyuan said: "When the time comes, I will go to Old Wang’s cave."

Did the Half-ghost Old Man leave anything behind in the cave? This made Chen Xiang very curious and he wanted to quickly go in to take a look.

"En!" Chen Xiang could only wait.

It took him half a day to finish all of the meat, as well as the beast stones. Afterwards, he would blow the wind out of nowhere, and in the end, he would enter the deep pool to cultivate. Because he had eaten too much meat this time, his round of cultivation took over half a month.
