Chen Xiang had mastered these two moves in just one night, but he felt that it was not enough. After that, he used a few more days of time and used a portion of the Bones techniques once or twice.

"You don’t need to use weapons in battle, but you can use protective gear." Yue’er replied, "This way, you won’t be able to use your God Murdering Sword Techniques at all."

The God Murdering Sword Techniques was also one of Chen Xiang’s trump cards, although he did not use it much.

"I’m fine." Chen Xiang understood the Seven devil-slain kungfu, and there were similarities between the time changes in the first style and the God Murdering Sword Techniques.

Chen Xiang exited the secret room. After taking a bath, he used the Transmission array to head towards the Hundreds of Flowers Village. Under Yue’er’s lead, he arrived at a large courtyard that was surrounded by three sides of a mountain. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

"This is where they forged their equipment. The environment is not bad." When Chen Xiang walked into the courtyard, he immediately felt a warm wind blowing. It was extremely sultry inside, but he was able to endure it.

At this time, Dongfang Xinyue and Liu Meng’er were both sitting cross-legged on stone stools beside the stove. Although it was very hot in this place, they did not feel hot at all.

The two girls were dressed in extremely loose white dresses, and when Chen Xiang arrived, he did not disturb them. He entered the hall in the house, and the moment he entered, he saw that Xue Xianxian and Dongfang Jing were there. They were carefully looking at a drawing on a long table, and did not notice that Chen Xiang and Yue’er had entered.

"Brother." Dongfang Jing unintentionally turned her head to look outside, and suddenly saw Chen Xiang standing there smiling, and exclaimed in surprise.

When Xue Xianxian heard it, he also raised his head. After seeing Chen Xiang, he was rarely overjoyed and hastily walked over.

"I’ve been back for so long and finally saw you." Xue Xianxian and Chen Xiang hugged each other for a while, then looked at each other with deep emotions. They didn’t need to say anything more, as they could already feel each other’s feelings.

"I heard from Yue’er that you guys wouldn’t be staying in seclusion during this period of time, so I came here to try my luck and see if I could see you busy beauties." Chen Xiang laughed, and gently caressed Dongfang Jing’s head: "Jing Jing has become more powerful too, she is now a Master Refiner."

"Brother, I missed you so much." Dongfang Jing hugged Chen Xiang’s arm and said tenderly.

Chen Xiang looked at Liu Meng’er and Dongfang Xinyue who were outside. They seemed to already know that he had come, but continued with their matter.

"What are the Elder Sister Meng’er and Xingyue doing? Why are they so serious?" Chen Xiang asked softly.

"They are smelting artifact materials, which is very critical, so they can’t stop right now." Xue Xianxian held Chen Xiang’s hand and chuckled: "Little scoundrel, don’t go around bullying people in Hundreds of Flowers Village."

"How could I? I’m very honest, don’t you believe me?" Chen Xiang looked at Yue’er, who was in Dongfang Jing’s embrace, and saw Yue’er shake her head.

Xue Xianxian laughed, "Look at Yue’er, she isn’t even helping you. Honestly speaking, who have you harmed this time?"

"I really don’t have any. Yue Er, you’re really not kind." Chen Xiang scratched his head, looking at Yue’er aggrieved, and then looking at Dongfang Jing.

"Brother, just be honest with me. It’s going to be like this anyways. It’s not like Sister Xianxian will say anything to you." Dongfang Jing smiled gently and sweetly.

"Jingjing, you ..." Chen Xiang was completely speechless, Dongfang Jing actually said the same thing.

"Well, yes. ’Sister Violet Orchid and Sister Hui Shan ... ’ And there’s also Sister Qinlian. " Chen Xiang told her the truth. This was the woman that he had intimate with after he returned.

"This... "Really? Big Sister Hui Shan, you dare to move." Although Xue Xianxian said that, he was already stepping on Chen Xiang’s feet.

Dongfang Jing also snickered by the side.

"Xianxian, can you guys help me refine a pill furnace? After so many years, I still don’t have a good pill furnace. Chen Xiang purposely pretended to be pitiful. After Xue Xianxian heard this, he snorted: "Why didn’t you say so earlier?

Chen Xiang laughed: "How can it be as good as yours, using your pill furnaces to concoct pills, I will definitely make it much smoother, I will concoct many pills for all of you to eat."

Xue Xianxian looked at Dongfang Jing and immediately took out a thick piece of paper: "This is the blueprint that we found in the Divine Book, it’s mainly for refining a Divine Stove, it’s not difficult for us to refine it, it’s just that we are lacking in the materials, because the materials that we need are materials that we have never seen before, so we have never heard of them before."

"What materials do you need? Give me a list and I’ll think of a way to get it." Chen Xiang said.

Xue Xianxian immediately wrote down a list for Chen Xiang, they were only missing three items, Chen Xiang had heard of them before, but since they were lacking, then they must be very precious.

"Right, there’s one more thing." Chen Xiang let the profoundwu clothing reveal himself and said: "This is the profoundwu clothing, have you all seen this before from that Divine Book?"

"I have." After Xue Xianxian learned that this was a profoundwu clothing, he suddenly became very excited. He anxiously came over and touched it, and then used his spiritual sense to investigate this profoundwu clothing, which was the same for Dongfang Jing.

"It’s broken, and it’s very serious." Xue Xianxian said as his brows knitted together, "Originally, there were nine Divine Deity grooves here, and they were meant for Divine Deity. Now, there’s only one of them, and the fused Divine Deity does not match the profoundwu clothing either, causing the profoundwu clothing’s power to decrease by a lot." Xue Xianxian said.

Dongfang Jing nodded his head: "But repairing isn’t easy either, according to the records in the Divine Book, refining this profoundwu clothing back then was extremely difficult, it was one of the hardest among the five divine weapons."

"This profoundwu clothing is very hard to obtain." Chen Xiang said, then Xue Xianxian and Dongfang Jing guided him and quickly took it off according to the method written in the divine book.

Chen Xiang now knew that when Xue Xianxian and the others were refining and setting up the array, they were both involved in the coordination and usage of Divine Deity, so they had a very deep understanding of this aspect.

"Can you guys fix it? Do you need me to refine something else?" Chen Xiang asked.

"I still don’t know. Let’s talk after Elder Sister Meng’er and Sister Warm Moon have arrived. Although this profoundwu clothing is broken, its defensive power is still very strong. It’s alright for you to just take it off like this." Xue Xianxian was a little worried, this was Chen Xiang’s life saving armor.

"Don’t worry, I still have other methods." The Art of Breeding Heavenly Elephants that Chen Xiang cultivates is also a very powerful defensive godly art.

"The dead man suddenly came back and threw us so many things to do." Liu Meng’er’s soft groan came from outside the door. Hearing Liu Meng’er’s voice, Chen Xiang couldn’t help but think back to everything that had happened between him and Liu Meng’er.

Dongfang Xinyue smiled at Chen Xiang charmingly, that charming smile was filled with a myriad of emotions. As Liu Meng’er spoke, he had already reached the side of the table and picked up the profoundwu clothing, looking at it.

"I can fix it. It will take some time, but it’s a bit more difficult to fill in the missing Divine Deity." Liu Meng’er handed the profoundwu clothing over to Dongfang Xinyue, and then gently wiped the sweat off Chen Xiang’s forehead.

A few days ago, that girl You Lan came to find me. She said that she wanted to fight for us, the Hell Devil Emperor. Liu Meng’er asked, she was not clear about these things.
