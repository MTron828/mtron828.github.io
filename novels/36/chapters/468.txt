Chapter 469 Making a Hard Decision

After the three apprentices of the Holy Light Sect were shocked out to fly, the blood and Qi within Chen Xiang’s body also surged. After all, Chen Xiang tried his best to unleash the True Qi of his entire body as dragon force. That was directly infused into their bodies and made his mouth dripping with blood.

While they were exclaiming about Chen Xiang’s strength, they looked at the white light that was flying towards the exit. Just as they were about to catching up, the white light flashed past and flew out. At the same time, a tyrannical Spirit Qi surged in and sealed the exit temporarily, preventing them catching on.

Right now Chen Xiang has not even a little bit of strength. He was heavily injured and risked his life to unleash all of his strength to repel the three people. Otherwise Long Xueyi would not have the chance to bring him away.

“If Holy Light Sect could send three of such strong people here, then there must be a lot of good items inside the White Tiger Profound Realm!” Bai Youyou said. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“There should be some good items, but I do not think that the Carefree Immortal Sea is able to hold all of it. Inside the Profound Realm is very dangerous, there the Carefree Immortal Sea sold it to the Holy Light Church to exchange something else.” Su Meiyao said.

Now that Chen Xiang was able to escape safely, they all let out a sigh of relief. Long Xueyi was currently carrying Chen Xiang to fly to the distant area of the sea. They could not return to the islands in Carefree Immortal Sea because Chen Xiang was exposed and both the Carefree Immortal Sea and Holy Light Sect would chase him.

“The Nirvana Realm!” Long Xueyi was shocked and quickly ran into the water.

Although Chen Xiang’s physical body was seriously wounded, he still had very good consciousness and magic power, with which he controlled his immobile hand to take out a piece of Hell Ganoderma and swallowed it.

Fortunately, he had the Holy Medicine such as Hell Ganoderma that could heal injuries quickly. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to recover from numerous injuries quickly over the course of years.

“Xiao Ziliang is an expert of talisman manufacture, so the people from Holy Light Sect must have a messenger talisman. Seems like if I must take Liu Menger along with me if want to enter the White Tiger Profound Realm again.” Chen Xiang was able to speak. He was wrapped in the light that Long Xueyi released and advanced stealthily in the deep ocean. The sea water couldn’t penetrate in and his speed of progress was very fast.

Su Meiyao laughed, “Don’t forget that only you can obtain the White Tiger Divine Weapon. The hiding place will definitely be very safe. Otherwise, the Carefree Immortal Sea would have long since taken it away.”

This was something that caused Chen Xiang to relax as well. He clenched his fists tightly. The people from Holy Light Sect wanted to kill him, and he would definitely make them to pay!

“This bastard Xiao Ziliang even dares to unite with the Holy Light Sect!” Chen Xiang fiercely said.

“That’s a Profound Realm, so there must be treasures inside. You can announce it to the outside world. That might even draw the Fire God Shrine.” Bai Youyou said.

A light flashed through Chen Xiang’s eyes. That was indeed a good idea. He needed to recuperate for a period of time, and Liu Menger would definitely enter the White Tiger Profound Realm at the very first moment then.

Long Xueyi chuckled. “Leave it to me!”

Chen Xiang was brought to a deserted island by Long Xueyi. The island was far away from Carefree Immortal Sea and no one would come in a short run.

Long Xueyi waved her beautiful hand in a direction. A ray of white light flight out from her hand and vanished.

“What is that?” Chen Xiang asked in curiosity.

“One of the Seventy-Two Transformations, I can quickly move my magic power across to Chenwu Continent. Once I get there, my magic power will turn me into a person, then I could control the person to spread the news of White Tiger Profound Realm.” Long Xueyi smiled.

Chen Xiang, Su Meiyao, and Bai Youyou all sighed in amazement. This technique was indeed very mysterious.

“Fantastic, right? This is the wondrous use of divine abilities. It’s even more powerful that you can create a dragon, then let it to destroy a continent.” Long Xuyi smirked and said.

Chen Xiang previously thought that only Seventy-Two Transformations and Furious Dragon Strike were too few for him, but now he knew that there were many things within these two abilities. Without Long Xueyi’s guidance, he would have no way of learning the power of his magic power, or cultivating divine force .

"The Nine Dragon Divine Technique is also a powerful divine ability, and it’s enough for you to cultivate for the rest of your life. All of the things I gave you right now are just superficial. You would know the formidable powers of those divine abilities one your learn them all.” Long Xueyi laughed out loud.

Chen Xiang sat on the beach and ate another piece of Hell Ganoderma. However, this didn’t allow him to recover in a short period of time. Only now did he realize that his injuries were severe, and his internal tibia was in a heavy wound.

“These three bastards, I must let them to die. I must make the Holy Light Sect to pay!” Chen Xiang said in a low voice.

“It’s impossible for you to raise your cultivation now, but you can increase your physical body and magic power!” Long Xueyi could feel the anger in Chen Xiang’s heart, “After increasing your physical body, you will have a carrier to keep a large amount of divine sense, then the magic power would naturally dissipate.”

“I know that both my body and my divine sense must be improved in balance. However, these two are the hardest to increase.” Chen Xiang heaved a sigh of relief.

Long Xueyi flashed her eyes as she smiled, “I know a way to make you improving quickly. You should know the pain that you need to endure in a short period of time in order to raise your physical body."

Of course, Chen Xiang knew, but he wasn’t scared at all. As long as he could make him go out of his way, he would like to take anything.

“How?” Chen Xiang hastily inquired.

"You have the Black Tortoise Strengthening Technique, don’t you? You elevated three levels when you entered the sect, now you should think about how to cultivate next? " Long Xueyi asked.

Chen Xiang hurriedly took out the Black Tortoise Body Strengthening Technique and read through it. He was now in the fourteenth level of the Immortal Devil Body. If he wanted to cultivate to higher levels, then he would encounter even more demanding requirements.

It didn’t take long for Chen Xiang to find a method to cultivate between the tenth and twentieth levels.

“During the process of refining the body with fire, circulate True Qi in the body in a specific manner according to the formula. After a long period of cultivating, the physical body will be strengthened.”

This is the syllabus from the tenth to twenty levels. The next was the formula.

“The problem is that the method requires a very strong flame that could burn me to die cause. But there would be less troubles since we do not need fused iron.” Chen Xiang felt a headache. Liu Menger helped him the last time he cultivated, and it would be difficult for her to burn his body for a long time.

"You can’t stop when you burn, and the fire must be increased gradually based on your endurance. Your sister Menger must not have the heart to do this, and she fused with the purple fire soul which would definitely conflict with your Heavenly Fire Soul. The only one that can help you in Chenwu Continent is the Primordial Fire Beast under the Youming Abyss! " Long Xueyi said. She already knew the content of Black Tortoise Strengthening Technique.

Chen Xiang was startled. His Heavenly Fire Soul was given to him by the Primordial Fire Beast. The ancient beast was indeed very strong, while Chen Xiang had an agreement with it to save it out.
