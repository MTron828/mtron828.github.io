Chen Xiang did indeed intend to let Shui Bingyan stay in the same room as him. Shui Bingyan was still like a child right now, and he couldn’t be at ease with her at all.

At this time, Feng Yujie came out from closed door cultivation, she heard Chen Xiang’s voice coming from the living room, and immediately walked over.

Seeing Shui Bingyan, Feng Yujie spat. She didn’t think that Chen Xiang had only been out for a month and already found such a good girl.

Feng Yujie’s face was full of jealousy, causing Three Gu Brothers and the other two to secretly laugh, and they tactfully ran away, although they really wanted to see what would happen next.

The pure Shui Bingyan obviously didn’t know what was going on. However, when she saw that Feng Yujie was a good-looking woman, she couldn’t help but have a very intimate feeling towards him. She sweetly smiled at him: "Hello, Big Sister."

"Hmm, how did you get tricked by him?" Feng Yujie walked over, she already knew who Chen Xiang was, although she was jealous, she would not have any bad expression towards Shui Bingyan, instead, she needed to take good care of her little sister.

"Don’t make it sound so bad, she and I have nothing. Sister Feng, this matter is more important when we go back to our room. I went to Beast Divine Palace and saw Qi Shi. "

Feng Yujie and Chen Xiang had been together for a while, so she already understood Chen Xiang very well. Seeing the look in his eyes, she knew that Chen Xiang was not lying, and the girl in front of her was not what she had imagined ... But she still felt that she would definitely be harmed by Chen Xiang in the future.

Feng Yujie also saw Yue’er who was in Shui Bingyan’s embrace. Seeing that Yue’er was very cute, she couldn’t help but hug him for a while. When she hugged Yue’er, she frowned, and then, her expression changed slightly as she said in shock: "This aura ... It’s the Star and crescent beast. "

"Let’s talk inside." Chen Xiang lowered his voice and walked in front, bringing Feng Yujie and Shui Bingyan in.

When Three Gu Brothers saw this from afar, he could not help but exclaim.

"This brat truly has quite the skill. He managed to make them submit so quickly." The oldest Gu sighed.

After entering the room, Chen Xiang said: "This is Shui Bingyan, she is ... She saved my life. This is Yue’er, the mysterious kitten in the Beast Divine Palace, the one you mentioned earlier. She helped me greatly during my trial. "

"This is Feng Yujie."

Chen Xiang briefly introduced both parties. They might be living here for a while in the future.

Yue’er replied, "I got the inheritance from the Nine Divine Kings. I knew it, but I didn’t expect that she was also in the Supreme Divine Palace."

Feng Yujie knew that Yue’er could speak, so she wasn’t surprised. "Within the Star Moon Divine Race, cats are royalty, and your position in the Beast Divine Palace shouldn’t be low. Furthermore, you’re a pure white Star-Moon Divine Cat."

Chen Xiang was shocked as he looked at Yue’er. The fur on her body was indeed very white and pure.

"Meow." Yue’er cried out, "Although my position in Beast Divine Palace isn’t low, it isn’t high either. Compared to that Prince Divine Lions, I’m nothing."

Speaking of Divine Lion Race, Feng Yujie immediately thought of Qi Shi. Qi Shi and the other divine beasts were initially resurrected by the Nine Divine Kings, but now, Feng Yujie knew some related matters.

"What’s wrong with Qi Shi? How did he come here?" Feng Yujie asked.

"He was injured by the Prince Divine Lions’s subordinates, and almost died. Now that he has gone to the Lion King’s Tomb, he was born and bred by the Super God Realm. As long as he wakes up his memories, he can go back and forth easily." Yue’er answered Feng Yujie, but Chen Xiang didn’t ask her how he got to Super God Realm.

Feng Yujie went over to Shui Bingyan’s side and touched her beautiful little face, only to see Shui Bingyan giving a light smile. "Elder sister, you’re very charming, you almost captivated me."

"You’re so amazing, you can actually see my hidden charm." Feng Yujie laughed, "BingYan, how old are you this year?"

Sister Feng, you have to take her to understand this world better in the future. She’s very strong, and she killed one of the Heavenly God Silver lion in one fell swoop without even leaving a trace of her Divine Deity behind. " Chen Xiang said.

Feng Yujie was shocked, she never thought that Shui Bingyan was so strong that he could kill the other Rankers in the God level in one go. However, she seemed so innocent, and had even brought her here.

"Big sister, I don’t know how old I am. I sleep a lot, and I don’t know how long I sleep every time." Shui Bingyan puffed her cheeks as she tried to recall exactly how old she was, but she couldn’t. She felt that she must have felt guilty not being able to give Feng Yujie a satisfactory answer.

Seeing Shui Bingyan’s beautiful face filled with shame, Feng Yujie did not expect her to be so conflicted over such a question, and anxiously laughed: "It’s alright, since you called me big sister, then you will follow me from now on. I won’t let any bad people bully you."

When she said that it was a bad guy, she shot a glance at Chen Xiang.

"Thank you elder sister, you are so nice." Shui Bingyan smiled.

Yue’er giggled, "So the bad guys are here."

Chen Xiang pinched Yue’er, "You little kitten, how many more things are you trying to hide from me?

Feng Yujie touched Yue’er’s little head: "Yue’er, you should be able to transform. As a member of the imperial family of Star and crescent beast, you should be able to transform very easily."

"This... "I’m a beast race, and it’s still very difficult for me to take human form. I also want to take human form as soon as possible, so I don’t have to be pinched all day long like this." Yue Er helplessly said.

Chen Xiang and Feng Yujie’s relationship was already very close. He told Feng Yujie about how he met Shui Bingyan, and also about how he obtained the Dao heart stone.

Feng Yujie didn’t know how dangerous the mission was, but she knew that Zhu Xiangyuan, the Chief Hall Master of the Soul Hall, would give him such generous rewards. She knew that it would be extremely dangerous, but she blamed Chen Xiang for it.

That ocean did not come from the Gods Realm, but from the Nine Heaven World. The Nine Heaven World’s circulation and growth speed have already exceeded my imagination, and I’m afraid not even the Nine Divine Kings would have expected it.

Feng Yujie’s words caused Chen Xiang and Yue’er to be extremely shocked. The majority of the sea water came from the Nine Heaven World.

Shui Bingyan had said it before, that the sea that was originally so big had suddenly grown big a while ago.

Yue’er said: "In that case, from now on, Nine Heaven World will directly cross over to the Gods Realm and fuse with it.

"That’s right, so I’m worried that the Nine Gods Nation will intervene." Feng Yujie said.

"If it really happened, it would be useless for them to intervene. The power of nature is not something they can defeat, at most they would just use their own strength to occupy the territory, but the Beast Divine Palace would not allow them to do so." Yue Er said.

Shui Bingyan listened quietly, she did not understand any of this, but it did not sound boring at all, and had made her enjoy listening to him. Furthermore, her mind was spinning very quickly, and throughout the entire journey, she had heard Yue’er and Chen Xiang talk about many things that happened in the outside world.

"Why doesn’t Beast Divine Palace allow them to do this?" This was what Chen Xiang also wanted to ask, he didn’t know either.

Feng Yujie said: "At that time, Beast Divine Palace had promised Nine Divine Kings that he would protect the nine heavens and prevent them from falling into the hands of Nine Gods Nation. If they still kept this promise, Beast Divine Palace would stop them at that time."

The relationship between Nine Divine Kings and him was not just good, he had not just revived a large number of powerful divine beasts that had died years ago, there was still such an agreement.

"Yes, the Nine Divine Kings is a benefactor to the Four Divine Beasts, and the Beast Divine Palace is controlled by the Four Divine Beasts." Yue Er nodded.

Yue’er was one of the Star and crescent beast s, and Divine Lion Race was one of them.
