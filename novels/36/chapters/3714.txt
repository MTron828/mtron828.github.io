The further they walked, the stronger the murderous aura became, causing people to feel uneasy. On the other hand, Jing Yun’er was still very lively as he was skipping and walking in front. She said it would be more dangerous or something, but she acted like nothing had happened.

Chen Xiang and Han Xiaoying were much more cautious now, every step they took required them to be fully prepared to strike. Their faces were serious, and if there was any movement, they would bring out their strength.

After half a day, Jing Yun’er suddenly stopped in his tracks.

"Something’s wrong!" Jing Yun’er shouted lightly.

Chen Xiang and Han Xiaoying also immediately stopped, and started to spin with their backs facing each other.

"Is that guy coming?" Chen Xiang said in a low voice. All along the way here, they had been enveloped by a strong killing intent, causing their hearts to feel extremely stifled.

Chen Xiang himself had cultivated Killing evil dragon before, and he even had Evil dragon array, but he had never encountered such a terrifying situation like this type of killing intent.

During this entire journey, he and Han Xiaoying felt as if they were being watched by a berserk killer. They felt that they could be killed at any moment, and that this put them under a lot of pressure.

"Yes, it’s about to appear!" Jing Yun’er looked ahead: "You all must be careful, we do not know the purpose of this fellow yet!"

Suddenly, the forest was shrouded by a gray fog. Inside the thick gray fog, it was as if the aura of slaughter had come over, surrounding Chen Xiang and the other two.

"Big Sister Yun!" Chen Xiang yelled in a low voice, that kind of terrifying feeling was getting closer and closer, and Chen Xiang couldn’t help but to pant. Han Xiaoying was so nervous that she grabbed onto Chen Xiang’s arm, her beautiful face completely bloodless from the terrifying aura.

Chen Xiang and Han Xiaoying suddenly saw a skinny old man dressed in black clothes appear in front of Jing Yun’er, but in the next moment, the old man passed through Jing Yun’er and arrived in front of Chen Xiang.

What made Chen Xiang even more terrified was that when the black clad old man came in front of him, the sword at his waist had already left its sheath and was lowered to his neck. The dense killing intent shrouded Chen Xiang, causing him to be unable to move, and his entire body was covered in cold sweat.

Chen Xiang felt that he was already at the pinnacle of the legendary realm. Even if he met an even more terrifying person, he definitely wouldn’t beat him too much.

"How did you get your Evil dragon array?" The old man’s voice was cold and emotionless.

"Old Evil gave it to me!" Chen Xiang answered immediately, he also clenched his fists, although his neck was lowered by a sword, he believed that he too, had the ability to retaliate.

"He’s dead?" The black clad old man seemed to know the Old Evil.

"He was killed by someone!" Chen Xiang said.

"Have you taken your revenge?" The black clad old man asked again, and at this time, Jing Yun’er had unknowingly arrived beside Chen Xiang, when she unknowingly released a burst of energy, which actually forced the black clothed elderly man to take half a step back, and also moved the sword that was pressed against Chen Xiang’s throat a little.

"Yes!" Chen Xiang replied.

"Alright!" The black-clothed person looked at Jing Yun’er, and then kept his sword.

"Old man, if you have something to say, we can talk about it. You’re not friendly if you use a knife or a sword." Jing Yun’er’s tone was also not good. She did not seem to be too afraid of the black-robed old man in front of her.

"Don’t you worry about being punished when you become like this?" The black clad old man looked at Jing Yun’er.

"Punishment? "If you have the guts, then come at me. Let me see who’s so powerful!" Jing Yun’er sneered.

The black clad old man no longer bothered with Jing Yun’er. He seemed to be even more interested in him as he could sense that the Evil dragon array was in Chen Xiang’s hands.

"You have nine Chuangyuan key?" The black-clothed old man asked.

"Are you going to stop me?" Chen Xiang said.

"No. I will not stop you. I do want to see if you have enough strength to open that door." The black clad old man revealed a trace of a strange smile. He looked at Han Xiaoying. You do not know that this will make you more dangerous. "

"Old man, what is your role here? The Overseer? " Jing Yun’er asked. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

"You can say that. However, I do not plan to stop you because with your strength, you cannot do anything here. Instead, you will even lose your life." The black clad old man swept a cold glance at Chen Xiang and the others: "I advise you to leave this place as you please, and stay alive."

"Since you’re here, of course we have to go take a look." Jing Yun’er looked at Chen Xiang: "Brat, what do you think?"

"Since you’re already here, go take a look!" Chen Xiang smiled slightly: "Are there any more obstructions in front?"

The thick murderous intent was also kept by the black clothed elder, "I am just a servant that is guarding here. I do not know what lies ahead, all I know is that with your strength, it will be very difficult to reach the final location."

"Thank you for the reminder!" Chen Xiang clasped his hands at the black-robed old man, while Jing Yun’er walked in front.

Just as Chen Xiang and Han Xiaoying were about to follow him, the black clothed elderly man said, "We will meet again!"

Jing Yun’er brought Chen Xiang and the others and quickly passed through the forest.

"This is truly a false alarm. That old man is very powerful. If we were to fight, I would have to spend quite a bit of time to defeat him." Jing Yun’er looked at the plain in front of him, pointed to the plain and said: "It should be there!"

Soon after, they quickened their pace. As soon as they stepped onto the plains, the ground slightly trembled and immediately, the wind and clouds surged. The originally clear sky suddenly became dusky and from time to time, ferocious lightning flashed, as if it was about to rain.

The plain suddenly cracked open, causing Chen Xiang and the rest to stop in their tracks.

Han Xiaoying looked ahead, and shouted: "It seems like something is going to pop out from there!"

From the crevices there emerged an altar the size of a small mountain. At the top of the altar, a large man was tied to a pillar.

From time to time, a few crows would fly over and tear off a lot of flesh from his body. What was terrifying was that the flesh would immediately grow back after being torn off. What kind of torture was this, made Chen Xiang and the others feel numb.

"Let’s go take a look! "Did I just come here and come across such a person?" Jing Yun’er slightly frowned, and immediately flew over.

After going over, the big man opened his eyes, which were completely bloodshot. From the outline of his face, he was extremely handsome, and he gave a pitiful laugh, "Finally, someone came to see me ... "Who are you people?"

"Even if I say it, you’re not us!" Jing Yun’er asked: "Why were you tied here? We have nine Chuangyuan key s, is this the end point? "

Han Xiaoying glanced at Chen Xiang. She was from the Ice Creation Saint Body, and something was calling for her. She nodded towards Chen Xiang, indicating that they were at the end of the line.
