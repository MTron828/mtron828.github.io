Once Chen Xiang left the Devil Wasteland, he immediately headed towards the Beast Wasteland, and went to Du Xiaoling’s underground Poison Palace. Although there were poisonous flowers, poisonous herbs and some things everywhere, every time Chen Xiang smelled that fragrance, he felt refreshed.

As soon as he arrived, he saw that there was a very large jade vat in the front of the house, with a beautiful lady soaking in it. It was actually Xia Bailing.

Xia Bailing’s eyes were closed, as if she was in deep sleep, submerged in the jade vat. Even though her head was exposed, her beautiful body could still be seen through the clear and calm water.

At the beginning, Chen Xiang was lost in thought, but when he remembered that Xia Bailing was a woman with different personalities, he forcefully shifted his gaze away so that he wouldn’t be discovered by Xia Bailing. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

But, just as he turned his head, he heard Xia Bailing laugh: "Coward, you’re a perverted one, but don’t have the guts."

Chen Xiang wanted to turn his head and look again, but he resisted the urge. He looked at a strange purple flower that was in full bloom and said: "Sister Bai Ling, I accidentally saw you earlier, coupled with your beauty, I couldn’t help but take a few more glances. Please forgive me."

"There’s no need for you to be so polite with me. Last time, you did it in front of me with Ziqian. Xia Bailing let out a lovable snort, then took out a long and slender * * from the jade vat. (TL: UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU)))

"Come over here and help me rub my feet." Xia Bailing shouted.

"This... Men and women shouldn’t be so intimate with each other. " Chen Xiang coughed dryly.

"What are you pretending for, hurry over." Xia Bailing shouted snappily.

Chen Xiang had no choice but to walk over, grab her tender feet, and then gently rubbed them as he asked: "Why are you rubbing your feet? Weren’t you soaking in these things right now to turn you into a body of impenetrable?"

While Chen Xiang was speaking, his eyes kept glancing inside the jade vat, and through the clear and rippling water, he could vaguely see some beautiful things, but Xia Bailing was playing with the water, the ripples of the water, making it very blurry.

"It’s nothing. I just want to see how I’m soaking now. Although I can lift my leg now, I can’t feel that you’re touching my foot. If I can feel it, then I’m done today." Xia Bailing laughed tenderly: "I will soon be able to cultivate the Body of impenetrable, at that time, I will no longer be afraid of poison."

"What is this water made of? Sister Bai Ling, after soaking it in the water for so many days, it looks much better. The more I look at it, the better it looks." Chen Xiang laughed.

"Little Scoundrel, don’t treat me the sweetest. I don’t even know who you are." Xia Bailing chuckled: "You’re so evil, especially last time ... ..."

Chen Xiang curled his lips: "I didn’t do it on purpose either. I thought you had fainted but who would have known you would be so conscious."

Xia Bailing stared at Chen Xiang, as if he had sensed something, and then shouted: "Little Scoundrel, lean your head over here."

"What are you doing? Do you want to kiss me?" Chen Xiang laughed.

"You wish, hurry up." Xia Bailing anxiously shouted.

Chen Xiang leaned his head over, and at this moment, he was also able to watch Xia Bailing’s beautiful face up close. Just as he wanted to pinch Xia Bailing’s face, his own face was pinched by Xia Bailing first.

"Ah... This is Infinite Dao Qi. " Xia Bailing pinched a piece of meat on Chen Xiang’s face, and was very surprised: "How did you manage to cultivate Boundless Dao Qi, this is something that requires a very strong body to nurture."

"There’s nothing I can do about it. I’m just that amazing. Have you fallen for me?" Chen Xiang said with a smile, and then, he also reached out his hand to touch Xia Bailing’s face.

He had touched Xia Bailing’s face before, but back then, he had not been able to cultivate the Limitless Dao Qi, so he could not sense it.

"You do too." Chen Xiang said.

Xia Bailing slapped Chen Xiang’s hand away and said: "Of course there is. My physical body is also very strong, no?

"Where’s Elder Sister Xiao Ling and Sister Ziqian, why didn’t I see them?" Chen Xiang said: "Shouldn’t they be the ones watching you take a bath?"

"I used to need them to watch from the side, but now, I don’t need them anymore. I can handle it myself." Xia Bailing said: "They have all left, quickly tell me about the situation outside, I have not been out for a long time, and what kind of strength you have now, I can’t see through you."

"Me ... I am at the second level of Dao Shi realm, the situation outside is very complicated, it is extremely difficult to put into words, wait for Elder Sister Xiao Ling and the rest to come back, I will tell you all together. " Chen Xiang said.

"Little Scoundrel, this jade vat is very big. It’s big enough to hold a single person. Come down and soak in it with me. It’s very comfortable." Xia Bailing suddenly laughed.

"Really?" Chen Xiang became excited and anxiously said.

"Of course it’s true. Come down quickly." Xia Bailing said very seriously.

Chen Xiang anxiously took off his clothes, but just as he was about to take off his clothes, Xia Bailing suddenly laughed: I was lying to you, look at how anxious you are, little scoundrel.

Seeing Xia Bailing giggling and Chen Xiang getting teased again, she felt extremely unhappy and wanted to take Xia Bailing on the spot.

Just as Xia Bailing was laughing until his branches trembled, Chen Xiang leaned his head over and forcefully kissed the mischievous little demon girl who was teasing him.

When she was in Hundreds of Flowers Village, she knew that Chen Xiang had always been a guy that had a lecherous heart and no guts. Furthermore, his mental fortitude had always been pretty good, which was why she had unscrupulously teased Chen Xiang, but now, she didn’t expect Chen Xiang to forcefully kiss her.

"Little Scoundrel, I won’t let you off, wuwu." Xia Bailing said to Chen Xiang through sound transmission, her small mouth had already been sealed by the remnants.

It was unknown whether it was because she was soaked in that special water, causing her strength to be unable to come out, or because she was a little anticipating something from the bottom of her heart. In short, under Chen Xiang’s guidance, she was a little fond of this feeling, and it even gradually quietened down as she held Chen Xiang’s neck ...

Ka ka ...

The sound of the stone door opening suddenly echoed. When the three women entered, they saw Chen Xiang standing beside the jade vat, bowing with his head lowered, and kissing intimately with Xia Bailing who was soaking in the jade vat.

"You all ... "What are you guys doing? Are you guys cultivating?" Du Xiaoling chuckled.

At this time, Chen Xiang and Xia Bailing finally reacted. Xia Bailing pushed Chen Xiang away and looked at him resentfully. He wanted to say something, but he didn’t.

"Sister Qinlian, you’re here too. Where did you go?" Chen Xiang wiped his mouth, as if nothing happened just now, and walked over with a giggle. He was already shameless to the extreme, even Bai Ziqian and Lv Qinlian snorted.

Du Xiaoling did not care about this, and said: "We were planning to go out and capture Black Hairs Human, but we did not expect that Black Hairs Human would not come out, and instead obtained a good thing."

As he said that, Du Xiaoling took out a red ribbon that glimmered with a bewitching red light.

"This is ..." the soul poison. " Chen Xiang shouted in shock.
