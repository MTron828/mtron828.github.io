Chapter 515 The Tenth Level of Demon Subduing Force

Since Chen Xiang was locked up here, Xue Xianxian and Leng Youlan were worried that he would be bored, so they came to talk to him every night. This made Chen Xiang feel warm in his heart.

In just ten days, Chen Xiang had already learned to the fourth level. If this were to be revealed, no one would believe it.

“The first level of Demon Subduing Force consumes very little True Qi but can produce a great power. The second level is the same, but it will consume a lot after reaching the third and fourth level. My current True Qi only allows me to us it a thousand times in a row at most!” Chen Xiang said.

Both Long Youlan and Xue Xianxian got aware that Chen Xiang had reached the fourth level. They already knew that Chen Xiang was not simple. Right now, they were looking forward to seeing what Chen Xiang would be like after he reached the tenth level. When the time came, Chen Xiang would definitely went find Zhong Quan to take revenge.

“I have indeed consumed a lot of energy! Seems like we have to train our True Qi more vigorously.” Xue Xianxian said. Both she and Leng Youlan had secretly learned the first level. This was because they had started cultivating the Tai Chi Divine Technique, so it was relatively easy for them to learn the Demon Subduing Force.

Chen Xiang nodded his head, “let’s end it here today, you guys can go back first!”

It was already dark. After saying goodbye to Chen Xiang, Xue Xianxian and Leng Youlan hurriedly left.

As for Chen Xiang, he continued to train his Demon Subduing Force. He guessed that the higher level he reached, the more energy he would consume to cultivate the Demon Subduing Force. He estimated that he would only be able to use the tenth level of the Demon Subduing Force ten times at most!

If he used the Heaven Shaking Palm or Dragon Slaying Slash, he could perform hundreds or even thousands of techniques in a row. However, he couldn’t use the Demon Subduing Force for so many times, which indicated that the power of Demon Subduing Force was much stronger than his other techniques.

Very quickly, it was time for the holidays. Every time, Leng Youlan and Xue Xianxian would stay for a relatively long period of time during the break.

“Brother, I want to accompany you into the cave. Aren’t you bored staying inside by yourself?” Leng Youlan said in a distressed tone.

Seeing her so concerned for him, Chen Xiang laughed and said, “Youlan, it’s only been a month. It’s going to be over soon. When I come out, I’ll let you see how I’ll treat that guy!”

"Youlan said that without you, she wouldn’t be able to sleep.” Xue Xianxian laughed.

“I’m used to embracing brother to bed now.” Leng Youlan muttered something, causing Chen Xiang to giggle. He had only slept with Leng Youlan for a few nights, but she had already latched onto him.

“Why don’t you say you want to sleep with me?” Xue Xianxian intentionally got jealous.

“No, not at all. It’s very comfortable sleeping with sister Xianxian, and I can even touch your tits.” Leng Youlan giggled. Her words caused Chen Xiang to involuntarily conjure up that beautiful scene.

After answering the two girls’ cultivation problems, Chen Xiang quickly went to cultivate. He had asked Leng Youlan and Xue Xianxian not to come so frequently because he needed to work hard to cultivate the Demon Subduing Force!

Very quickly, Chen Xiang stayed here for nearly a month. He still had one more day before he could leave!

"Brother, what level are you on now? Sister Xianxian and I are both on the second level now. " Leng Youlan asked quietly. It had been five days since Xue Xianxian and her came here.

Chen Xiang smiled. “The ninth. I think I’ll reach the tenth by tonight. it is very easy for me to learn.”

Hearing Chen Xiang’s words, Leng Youlan and Xue Xianxian couldn’t help but be stunned. The tenth level was a place that even the principal couldn’t reach. Even the strongest old fellows in the Demon Subduing Academy were only at the eighth floor, while Chen Xiang was on the ninth right now.

“Brother is quite amazing. That is indeed my big brother.” Leng Youlan felt extremely proud. She was very happy to have such a powerful brother.

“Dear Xiang, you’re such a freak! Having such a freak husband makes me feel a lot of pressure!” Xue Xianxian giggled. Although she said that, she was incomparably happy in mind.

"Brother, the Ranking Tournament will start in a few days. Because the Demon Subduing Board was formulated by the principle at an early time, as more and more people enter the Demon Subduing Academy, he needs to make a new board based on strength. However, the rules of the Ranking Tournament seem to so complicated for me to understand.” Leng Youlan said while she scratched her white hair in pain.

"I don’t understand the rules either. It seems that only the principal knows the rules. As for the specifics, we just need to go compete in martial arts! However, we cannot participate in it. The primary group is for martial artists at the late stage of the Spiritual Martial Realm and the early stage of the Soul Martial Realm; the intermediate group is for those at the middle and late stage of the Soul Martial Realm; the advanced group is for those at early and middle stage of the Hundred Refinement Realm; and the pinnacle group is for those at the late stage of the Hundred Refinement Realm.” Xue Xianxian said.

Chen Xiang and the rest were all in the initial stages of the Spiritual Martial Force, they really couldn’t participate!

“That is so unfair. Even though I am only in the early stage of the Spiritual Martial Realm, I have beaten many warriors in the late stage. That group of dregs are all easy birds. Although their cultivation levels were high, their True Qi and martial skills were not strong enough, and their flesh bodies are as fragile as tofu that crashes easily in a touch. Heh heh, I refuse to accept this!” Leng Youlan was very dissatisfied with this rule.

Chen Xiang clenched his fists and coldly laughed, “it’s fine if we do not participate in it. We can challenge the guys on the Demon Subduing Force one by one after the rank is done and and ruthlessly stomp these guys under our feet, to let them know that the Demon Subduing Board is only a bullshit!"

Leng Youlan immediately became excited, “brother, we got the same idea. I want to work hard to cultivate my Demon Subduing Force and reach to the fourth or fifth level, then I will cripple that group of guys who dare to disrespect my achievements these past few days and refuse to sign me up for the tournament!”

Long Youlan could defeat a warrior at the late stage of the Spiritual Martial Realm, but she was not allowed to participate in the Ranking Tournament, which made her pretty mad.

Even though Xue Xianxian’s performance was not as intense, she was also very angry in mind. Although she and Leng Youlan were both at the early stage of the Spiritual Martial Realm, they were comparable to many warriors in the late stage. However, they were all rejected and were mocked by many people who asked them to go back and cultivate for a few more years!

At this moment, Leng Youlan and Xue Xianxian were both extremely excited. They were determined to learn the Demon Subduing Force, since that was the only way for them to quickly increase their strength. After bidding farewell to Chen Xiang, they hurried back.

Chen Xiang returned to the cave and lightly waved his hand at the stone wall. “Clap clap clap ...” The sound of nine thunderous rumbles rang out in succession. It was majestic and extremely frightening. However, it did not hit the stone wall. Chen Xiang only released it and quickly put it away, which meant that he could control the force anyway as he wished.

The nine echoes of the Demon Subduing Force corresponded to the ninth level of it. Chen Xiang only knew that the formidable principle of the school was only at this level. He was confident that he could train to the tenth level in one day and then familiarize himself with the tenth level in a few days!

Even the inside of Chen Xiang’s storage ring rang with thunderbolts. Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou were both learning this martial skill. It would benefit them greatly. Once they recovered their strength, they would also be able to use this powerful martial technique.

As soon as the sky brightened, a series of thunderous rumbles echoed in the cave. It was as if a sudden clap of thunder, extremely scary. Chen Xiang had long used a formation to isolate the sounds inside, preventing them from spreading out. Otherwise, his secret training matter would definitely be known by others.

The person who came to release Chen Xiang was chancellor Zhao Tao. He saw Chen Xiang beaming with happiness, not the least like someone who had been locked up for a month. Zhao Tao stroked his beard in doubt, and the moment Chen Xiang came out, he quickly left after exchanging a few pleasantries with him.
