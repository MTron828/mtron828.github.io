Chen Xiang was startled, they had always thought that this thing was the descendant of bugs, but it was not right now, what was it then? And it looked so terrible!

"Will Big Sis Long be alright?" Chen Xiang said as he rushed downwards.

"Don’t worry about her, she’s not weak at all!" Yue’er replied, "There was originally a queen bug down there, but it suddenly turned into something. Perhaps the queen bug died, but something came out of the queen bug’s body."

Chen Xiang said: "I used my Dao heart Eye to see a black mass. That is an evil force, what is it?" Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Because the surrounding cave walls had been frozen by Long Huishan and there was only a vast expanse of whiteness below him, when Long Huishan arrived at the bottom, the surrounding ice was still emitting a white glow, illuminating the bottom of the cave.

"This is ..." Long Huishan stood on top of a huge black bug. This bug looked like a centipede, with many pairs of thorny legs.

The insect was already frozen, but there was a hole in its head, as if something had run out of the hole and even pierced through the thick ice.

"Who are you?"

Just as Long Huishan thought that it was strange, she heard a shout from behind her. She had just turned around, and a sword was suddenly thrusted towards her throat, causing her to hastily sidestep.

"It has the power of a dragon!" He waved the sword in his hand, releasing the ice blades from Long Huishan’s hands. He knew very well, if he was hit by this, he would definitely not feel good.

Long Huishan had already seen the person clearly. He was actually a white and handsome man with a set of black armor, the longsword in his hand was not an ordinary weapon, and his body was releasing waves after waves of Evil Spirit Qi!

"You’re not from here!" Long Huishan had frequently clashed with the Evil Demons here in the past, but he had never met with anyone as evil as the man in front of him.

"That’s right, who exactly are you? Is it from the Nine Heaven School? " He actually knew that the Nine Heaven School was going to deal with them. "But I have never heard of a person like you in the Nine Heaven School, could it be that you’re the Female Dragon King that just came from the Ice Dragon Race?"

The man suddenly came to his senses, he did not waste any words, the Evil Force on his body surged, holding onto his sword, he attacked frantically, the Evil Qi of the sword gushed out, wielding the sword created a burst of Evil Qi, the Evil Qi struck Long Huishan’s face, it caused her to feel pain, and after parrying a few slashes, she immediately ran away from the man, because the opponent’s Evil Qi was too terrifying.

was infuriated. The other party actually knew about her, and seemed to have just found out as well. It was very obvious that someone had told him these things, and even without thinking, they already knew that it was Fu Tian School’s Fu Tiangao.

Chen Xiang had already crept closer. When he came down, he had personally witnessed the process of Long Huishan and the man’s battle, and had heard their conversation. At this moment, he was also secretly resentful towards Fu Tiangao.

"Looks like I have to do something!" Chen Xiang took a deep breath, then said to Yue’er: "I had previously used the power of space to bind people ... is to release a space barrier that is exactly the same as the other person’s body, and trap them within this space, making them unable to move. "

"However, I had used a large amount of spatial energy back then to forcefully make it. There was no skill in that!"

Hearing Chen Xiang’s words, Yue’er understood what Chen Xiang meant. He wanted to ask her if she understood this kind of method, so of course she would understand.

"Mm, this move is called Spatial Binding. It has a certain skill, and it requires one to know how to use the power of space!" Yue’er immediately used the method of divine soul exchange and transmitted it into his divine soul, allowing him to comprehend it quickly.

Chen Xiang had already used it before, so it was easier for him to learn now.

"How about this, you tie him up first, and then I’ll bind him in a layer of space outside. This way, the two layers will buy Big Sis Long some time." Yue Er said.

Below, the man was fighting with Long Huishan again. The two of them were fighting intensely, and temporarily, they were on par with each other, while Chen Xiang who was above them was also blown up by the Qi waves produced when they were fighting, causing him to have no choice but to use his spatial energy barrier to separate himself from the surrounding space to prevent any side effects.

Cracks had already appeared on the thick ice on the walls of this deep pit, and large amounts of ice were falling down from above. If this continued, then this deep pit would definitely collapse.

"How’s it going? We have to use it as soon as possible. Although Big Sis Long and that guy have a draw, dragging this out won’t be good for us because the monsters around here are mostly him, so the other side is probably trying to stall for time for helpers. " Yue Er said.

"You can use it now!" Chen Xiang took a deep breath, and allowed the Six Realms’ Power within the Divine Sense Sea s to flow into the spatial Divine Deity. After passing through the spatial Divine Deity, the Six Realms’ Power could instantly transform into a formidable power of space.

Six Realms’ Power originally contained powers of other attributes. Although it could be directly used on space, it was not enough to become stronger after being converted by Divine Deity.

"Freeze!" Chen Xiang shouted in his heart, and a large amount of the condensed spatial energy gushed out, passing through the air and wrapping around the man’s body, forming an invisible spatial seal. Furthermore, the Six Realms’ Power in his Divine Sense Sea was still steadily gushing out, providing energy, maintaining the spatial seal.

Yue’er had also started her cultivation at this time. When she had awakened her memories, she had already recovered quite a bit of her strength. Don’t look at her like this; she had an extremely terrifying power of the stars and moon, and she could also skillfully use the power of the Space Laws!

At this moment, Yue’er had also used Spatial Binding, and had shared two Spatial Binding with Chen Xiang, causing the man to be unable to move for a moment. Now, Chen Xiang could also feel that his Spatial Binding had begun to crack, because the man’s strength was extremely terrifying.

Long Huishan’s reaction was extremely fast, she saw that the other party was suddenly unable to move, and was floating in mid air, she knew that someone was secretly attacking. She immediately rushed over, and using half of her Mysterious power, she condensed onto her blade, and with one slash she chopped off the opponent’s head, and then with another palm strike, the headless body and the Divine Sense Sea separated, leaving behind the Divine Sense Sea’s support. She became extremely weak, and was frozen up by Long Huishan in an instant.

After the headless body was frozen, Long Huishan then kicked it with his leg. It was actually a very strong vibrating force that turned the body into ice crystals.

Chen Xiang grabbed the severed head from the air and started using Soul Absorbing Devil Spell on it, but right after he used it, his face changed and he quickly let go.

Long Huishan looked down at the head curiously. She was worried that something might have happened to Chen Xiang, and cried out in alarm, but she quickly flew up, cut the head into half, and then used the strong Icy cold power to freeze it.
