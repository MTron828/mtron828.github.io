Chapter 492 Hand of Slaughter of God

After Chen Xiang put on his clothes, he smiled mischievously as he looked at Liu Menger’s beautiful face., while glancing at her slender body, causing Liu Menger to shy and blame him inwardly.

Just as he was about to speak, Liu Menger interrupted him, “Don’t mention what just happened!” When she thought about the two of them hugging each other naked while her “jade rabbits” and entire body were being toyed with by Chen Xiang for a long time, Liu Menger face immediately flushed, especially when she thought about how embarrassed she was when Chen Xiang saw her posture who she was being provoked.

Seeing Chen Xiang’s naughty smile, Liu Menger said with a snort, “You’re not allowed to think about it anymore!”

“You little rascal, you’re so bad!” Thinking about Chen Xiang’s two big hands moving around her beautiful body, Liu Menger stomped her feet and spat in a low voice, “I knew that when I was with you, I would always be bullied by you!”

Chen Xiang laughed and said, “Sister Menger, didn’t you just enjoy a lot as well?”

With that word, he brought Liu Menger over. Liu Menger struggled for a moment before sighing helplessly. She lightly punched Chen Xiang then leaning into his embrace and whispering, ”little rascal, how are you right now? Are there any problems within your body?"

Chen Xiang had channelled so much power into her body, which made her very worried. She felt that she couldn’t handle the power herself, let alone Chen Xiang.

“It’s nothing. What about you, sister Menger? You are supposed to be much better now!” Chen Xiang gently caressed Liu Menger’s back as he recalled the three days that had passed between him and Liu Menger, causing his heart to ripple. Although nothing sexual happened, it still gave him an endless aftertaste of what had happened, especially the perfect body of Liu Menger. His heartbeat would accelerate as he though of that.

Feeling Chen Xiang’s heartbeat quicken, Liu Menger pursed her lips and snorted, “Thank you for letting me have such a great harvest. My Fire Soul has increased by a lot, so as my strength. I think I will soon start to endure the Eighth Nirvana Tribulation!”

That was a man who passed the Eighth Nirvana Tribulation whose strength was devoured. The dense force had entered Liu Menger’s body and was refined by her. Liu Menger was also a person who had just passed the Seventh Nirvana Tribulation, and even she couldn’t believe this speed of improvement. Under normal circumstances, it would take at least a thousand years to achieve the exact level!

Chen Xiang evilly smiled, “There’s no need to be courteous; my harvest is also very great ...Haha.”

“Hmph!” Liu Menger’s face flushed red as she stepped on Chen Xiang.

The middle-aged man of Fire God Shrine had already turned into a mummy. Liu Menger had released a flame to burn the corpse. If the Fire God Shrine knew about this, then it would be quite troublesome for them.

After what had happened before, Chen Xiang and Liu Menger became even closer. Chen Xiang knew that there would be a second time after the firs occurrence, and when he thought about how he would be able to enjoy the charm of this peerless lady emperor in the future, he became excited inwardly.

“Why aren’t you getting the White Tiger Divine Weapon? What are you thinking about?” Liu Menger resentfully looked at Chen Xiang. Her face was flushed as she let out a light breath. She knew that she was destined to be Chen Xiang’s person in this life. It tormented her a lot once she thought that she had to face Xue Xianxian and Leng Youlan.

Chen Xiang walked over and released his White Tiger True Qi. With a palm strike, he shattered the crystal box and dripped some blood on the white tiger gloves. A golden-white light exploded and entered Chen Xiang’s arms before disappearing.

“Haha ...” Chen Xiang laughed aloud. As he worked his mind, that pair of white tiger gloves appeared on his hands. He could feel the power of the Hand of God of Slaughter. He threw a punch at the forest in the distance, not using his True Qi, but there was still an extremely strong fist wind that ferociously blew out. In the blink of an eye, waves of huge trees in the forest fell down.

It was so formidable even without True Qi, then what would happen if he used? If it was coupled with the Azure Dragon Subduing Demon Slayer, his strength would be even more unimaginable. Right now, he was itching to try it out!

“Little rascal, do you often use that kind of martial art to devour people?” Liu Menger asked. She knew that it would be very harmful if he did it a frequently.

Chen Xiang was very happy. After fusing the gloves into his flesh, he came to Liu Menger and smiled, “don’t worry, I don’t use them often now. Besides, I was very particular when I devoured them. I had no other choice at previous times!”

Thinking about the life-dangerous situation before, Liu Menger hugged Chen Xiang and leaned on his chest, “You have to be careful in the future. Don’t let something like this happen again. I’m already worried to death.”

Chen Xiang kissed Liu Menger’s cherry lips, while his evil hands attacked Liu Menger’s chest. This caused Liu Menger to curse as she chased after Chen Xiang. The two of them were playing with each other, but in the end, they still hugged and looked at each other affectionately, just as they were about to kissing.

“Cough, cough ...” The White Tiger suddenly appeared.

Chen Xiang cursed in his heart, “Damned big white cat, it doesn’t appear when it should, but it appear when it shouldn’t!”

Being discovered that they were intimate, Liu Menger’s face flushed with embarrassment. This was the first time someone had seen her and Chen Xiang do this kind of intimate action.

“Hehe, you guys seemed to have encountered some danger earlier, but it seems like you’ve already solved it all!” White Tiger laughed.

"Senior God of War, can you send me out, all of the people in this place?” Chen Xiang asked. He deliberately stressed on the words God of War, obviously to mock the White Tiger.

White Tiger grunted, “Kid, don’t think you are invincible just because you win me. In that state, I indeed cannot use my full strength. Wait until you grow to my level, then you can come and have a real fight with me!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“I didn’t establish this White Tiger Profound Realm. After you obtained the Azure Dragon Subduing Demon Slayer and the Black Tortoise Armament Armor, you should know that the Four Symbols Divine Weapons are all in Profound Realms. Someone intentionally placed them in these profound realms and even modified those realms.”

“Of course I know, but I don’t think you’ll tell me about that person who did it.” Chen Xiang said. He guessed that this person had created a path to the Core of Earth in the Abyss. This person is truly mysterious and ruthless.

The White Tiger mysteriously smiled and looked at Liu Menger, “You will definitely know in the future, and this person will definitely surprise you!”

Chen Xiang was shocked, “Do I know that person?”

“No, but I can guarantee that you will be very surprised when you find out who he is.” White Tiger laughed.

“Hmph, purposefully leaving a suspense.” Chen Xiang crossed his arms in front of his chest and curled his lips.

“Senior White Tiger, can you send us out? Or do we have to wait until the big whirlpool opens that we can leave?” Could it be that Liu Menger was in a hurry to go back and cultivate, stabilize her cultivation, and then prepare for her tribulation?

“Of course I can. Even though this Profound Realm wasn’t established by me, I can open a path at any time.” As the White Tiger spoke, it raised both its arms high up in the air. The entire White Tiger Profound Realm was suddenly filled with the power of space, and the White Tiger Profound Realm started to tremble slightly.
