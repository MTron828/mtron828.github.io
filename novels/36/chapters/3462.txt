Xiang’er also saw Feng Ke’er, the cute and beautiful little girl, chattering about the various profound constructs of the barrier without end. She was so shocked that she could not close her mouth. Previous Chapter |

Although they already knew that this was not an ordinary little girl, they were still shocked.

Big sister Xiang Luan, you have to work together with me to ’create’ a spatial formation. When the time comes, you will need to control that spatial formation. Feng Ke’er said.

The array formation within the Six Realms mirrors could not be directly released just by absorbing energy. It required a strong enough amount of energy to activate the spatial array formation.

"Alright!" Xiao Xianglin felt that it was a little difficult, but the little girl in front of him felt that it was nothing, so of course she couldn’t shrink back.

Chen Xiang took out his Six Realms mirrors. Xiao Xianglin was his master anyway, so it wasn’t a big deal to show his master his own treasures.

The structure of the Six Realms mirrors immediately attracted Xiao Xianglin’s attention. Feng Ke’er brought her to a place inside the Six Realms mirrors where they would lay down a spatial array. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

"Chen Xiang, give the Time Domain to us!" Feng Ke’er said: "This kind of profound formation requires a lot of time."

The Six Realms mirrors had already replicated a few Transmission array s. Right now, Feng Ke’er and Xiao Xianglin needed to modify the Transmission array and transform it into a spatial formation so that the spatial formation could fuse with Chen Xiang’s Time energy. At the same time, it could absorb Xiao Xianglin’s energy and absorb the powerful energy that would instantly erupt from his body. ad)

Chen Xiang then used the Time Domain on Feng Ke’er and the others, they were now setting up a spatial formation within the Time Domain.

Xiao Xianglin did not know how to use Space mantra, but when she saw the incantations, she immediately recognized it. Feng Ke’er knew how to use Space mantra, which caused Xiao Xianglin to be extremely impressed.

"Xiao Ke’er, where did you learn these Space mantra? The Space mantra is here, but it’s a very rare Tao-creation’s Incantation. Although it’s not very hard to learn, it’s impossible to spread it around, and we only have three Dragon Elephant Door, so I can’t learn any of them. " Xiao Xianglin did not expect Feng Ke’er to have mastered nine.

"Chen Xiang has it! I can teach you too! " Feng Ke’er smiled sweetly, then quickly drew nine Space mantra s and placed them into nine small crystal boards. In the future, Xiao Xianglin would learn from them.

"Thank you so much!" Xiao Xianglin was in disbelief. He didn’t expect Feng Ke’er to be so generous and just give it to her like that.

Feng Ke’er was Chen Xiang’s master, so she also felt that it was not a big deal.

Very quickly, it was Feng Ke’er’s turn to be jealous of Xiao Xianglin, because Xiao Xianglin had an extremely heaven defying talent for learning Tao-creation’s incantation. He actually managed to successfully grasp three Space mantra s in just a few days of time.

When Feng Ke’er first went to learn these Space mantra, he spent a lot of time, but Xiao Xianglin did it so easily.

"Big sister Xiang Luan, you’re so awesome. Your talent in learning Tao-creation’s incantations is really high. Back then, I had only learned three Tao-creation’s incantations a long time ago." Feng Ke’er spoke softly with a face full of envy.

Xiao Xianglin had learned all kinds of ’messy’ and ’shitty’ Tao-creation’s incantations before, and there were a lot of complicated Tao-creation’s incantations among them. Now that she had turned around to learn simple Space mantra s, it was simply too easy.

In the next period of time, Xiao Xianglin and Feng Ke’er worked together and spent almost a year to set up that spatial array. During this period of time, Xiao Xianglin learned two more Space mantra s, and learning them was like playing with her.

"Chen Xiang this guy has a lot of Tao-creation incantations, he actually didn’t teach me." Xiao Xianglin was indignant.

"You’re his master, so of course he won’t teach you. Plus, he doesn’t think there’s any benefits." Feng Ke’er laughed tenderly: "He values rewards a lot."

"Humph, this kid is serious."

Xiao Xianglin pouted her lips, she could not say anything more, she was Chen Xiang’s master, if she went to look for Chen Xiang to learn the Tao-creation’s Incantation, where would her master put her face? If she wanted to give Chen Xiang benefits, she didn’t know what to give. She felt that Chen Xiang would definitely not lack something, and even if he did, it wasn’t something she could give him.

When Xiao Xianglin and Feng Ke’er came out of the Six Realms mirrors, they had already finished modifying the array. Chen Xiang had used the second stage of Time Domain, so only half a day had passed.

"My good disciple, tell Master honestly, how many Fusion spell have you mastered now?" When Xiao Xianglin found out that Chen Xiang’s Time Domain was so powerful, he thought that Chen Xiang must have used the Time Domain after going into closed-door training for a year.

Chen Xiang raised four of his fingers. There was no point in continuing to hide it!

"Four... You actually have a Fusion spell behind you! " Xiao Xianglin also did not expect that, she felt that Chen Xiang would be very strong just by possessing the Space mantra, but she actually thought that the Fusion spell behind them would be very precious.

Chen Xiang "shushed" her and said, "I’ll tell you in the future. Only then will I know what those Tao-creation’s incantations are."

Xiang’er and Yu’er, the two girls, heard their conversation and did not understand what Chen Xiang and Xiao Xianglin were saying.

After Xiao Xianglin explained it, they finally understood. Previously, they thought that they were just like Xiao Xianglin, who was a genius at learning Tao-creation’s runes.

"It took me nearly two hundred years to learn four of them!" Chen Xiang curled his lips. He now knew that Xiao Xianglin had learned five Space mantra, but in less than a year’s time, this talent made him jealous and envious.

"Stupid!" Xiao Xianglin laughed complacently, "How about you teach your master how to learn those Tao-creation’s incantations, and then I will guide you in your studies?

"Are you for real?" Chen Xiang did not believe it.

"You don’t believe me to ask these two girls, do you know that their talent for learning Tao-creation’s incantations is worse than yours? Furthermore, they did not have any basic knowledge previously, but their learning speed of these six complex incantations of Fusion spell’s is almost the same as yours! It is precisely because they are mentoring their teacher that they are so fast. " Xiao Xianglin said very confidently.

"Alright, wait till we ’get’ the Legendary mantra. No matter if I can ’get’ the Legendary mantra or not, I still have to ’get’ it." Chen Xiang said. He was a greedy person, whether it was useful to him or not, if there was a chance, he would definitely not let it go.

"Alright, let’s set off now!" At this moment, Xiao Xianglin was secretly excited, he said to Xiang’er and Yu’er: "You guys follow along, at that time, I might want to borrow your power!"

Xiao Xianglin planned to leave the carriage there, because she already knew part of the uses of Chen Xiang’s Six Realms mirrors. Just like this, Chen Xiang, Xiao Xianglin and the three women entered the Six Realms mirrors and let the Six Realms mirrors disappear.

After the Six Realms mirrors shrank in size, it flew out of the window and arrived behind the barrier. Then, it used the formation that was just set up to teleport out.

They were not discovered even in broad daylight, so they successfully ran out!
