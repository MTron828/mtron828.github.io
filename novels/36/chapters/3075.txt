The people from the Mu Rong family were still powerful. Although they were sealed by Feng Ke’er and could only move, they could use the power of space to teleport. The updates were quick.

This was something both Chen Xiang and Chen Xiang did not expect!

After the World Defying Green dragon in the sky released two bolts of lightning from its eyes, they teleported away to avoid it. At the same time, they were also struggling with the sealing power with all their might.

"They’re about to break free." Feng Ke’er could feel the sealing power he had released weakening.

Chen Xiang immediately rushed over, let out a loud roar, and released an extremely strong space-time domain with all his might, enveloping the surrounding hundred Li.

Then, he would control the World Defying Green dragon to attack!

The World Defying Green dragon roared, this time it opened its mouth, and from it shot out an extremely huge blue lightning. That lightning, was like a huge river flowing down from the sky, and immediately enveloping the two men from the Mu Rong family.

After the green dragon lightning pierced through the ground, a violent power of lightning burst out from deep underground, causing the ground within a thousand miles radius to crack and churn. Lightning of all sizes spewed out from the ground, shooting high into the sky.

"The strength of the World Defying Green dragon far surpasses my imagination!" After Chen Xiang cultivated the World Defying Holy Body to its peak, this was the first time he used the full power of a World Defying Green dragon.

The two men from the Mu Rong family were lucky enough to survive, but they didn’t die. Instead, they fell to the ground with their bodies charred black.

"You’re still alive!" Chen Xiang came to their side and mocked: "I wonder who was the one who said they would torture me to death just now? You’ve all turned into a lump of carbon, so I can’t recognize you! "

Chen Xiang used his foot to step heavily on a person’s face and asked: "Did you say that? Did you say that? "

His stomps were very powerful, and his feet were emitting waves of lightning power.

"No... He said so. " The man from the Mu Rong family said while crying. They might have been arrogant before, but now that they knew he was about to be killed, they were scared to the point of peeing.

"Oh?" Chen Xiang stepped on another person’s face and asked: "Did you say that?"

"He said it!" The man obviously wouldn’t admit it, or else he would have died. Right now, both of them had been turned into charcoal, and because their throats were injured, their voices had greatly changed.

However, there was no change in their auras, so of course Chen Xiang could separate them from his aura. He only wanted to see how afraid these disciples of the Mu Rong family were of death.

"Looks like you’re all going to smack the dog to death!" Chen Xiang laughed out loud, "I can’t even tell the difference between you two, so I’ll kill you all too!"

"Don’t..." They had not thought that Chen Xiang’s World Defying Green dragon would be so powerful. They had thought that the powerful net in their hands would be able to trap Chen Xiang, but something like this had actually happened.

"Don’t worry. I don’t hate you as much as you do. So, I will not torture you. I will let you leave in a great manner." After he finished speaking, a cold light flashed out from Chen Xiang’s hand and the Heavenly magic sword had already appeared in his hand.

With a few swishes, he beheaded the two of them and burned them to death with the World Defying god fire.

"Mu Rong family, just you wait, don’t think that just because Murong Honglian is on good terms with me, I won’t do anything to you! In my heart, you two are much more despicable than the He Clan. "

Chen Xiang looked in one direction, which was the location of the Mu Rong family’s hidden secret realm. He planned to go to the Mu Rong family the moment he cultivated the Primordial Divine Body, in order to let them know that he, Chen Xiang, was not a soft persimmon.

Two of the Mu Rong family’s disciples had been killed, that was a very good thing! It was much more precious than the gold slaves of the He Clan. Although the gold slaves of the He Clan were powerful, they were all very stupid. They did not have their own battle awareness and did not know how to react in battle.

The two people who were like Chen Xiang and her, were both part of the younger generation that were hard to come by in the clan!

After such an incident, the entire Mu Rong family was shocked, especially Murong Honglian’s senior uncle. He thought that he would be able to obtain the World Defying Green dragon and Myriad Tao’s treasures very soon, but he never expected that he would be left with such grievous news!

Murong Honglian was being placed under house arrest in her own room, so she found out about this matter through a servant. She could only sigh helplessly as she was well aware of Chen Xiang’s abilities, and this was something she had expected.

He Huang had almost been killed by Chen Xiang just now, let alone the children of the Mu Rong family! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

"Senior Martial Uncle has suffered a great loss this time, those two senior Martial Brothers aren’t good people either, they deserve it!" Murong Honglian remembered how that Senior Master had treated her and Chen Xiang, and now that he knew about this matter, he couldn’t help but feel a little happy.

This event had alarmed the Mu Rong family’s old ancestor. After all, these two young and outstanding disciples had consumed a lot of resources to nurture them. However, the future of the Mu Rong family was gone!

After half a day, that Senior Master came to find Murong Honglian.

"You should know by now." That Senior Master’s face was gloomy and cold. He was extremely furious at the turn of events, and in his heart, he felt that this was caused by Murong Honglian.

"Of course I know." Murong Honglian whispered.

"The clan elders are all very supportive of my actions, they think that I am right, and that I have to ensure the clan’s benefits. Therefore, no matter how merciful Chen Xiang is, for the benefit of the clan, we must obtain his World Defying Green dragon and Myriad Tao’s treasures." That Martial Uncle’s voice was cold as he suppressed the fury in his heart.

"Yes." Murong Honglian only replied once, but she had already seen through everything.

"Hmph, we’ve worked so hard to nurture you. Aren’t you thinking for the benefit of your own family?" Seeing Murong Honglian’s reaction, Senior Master became as angry as thunder and said sternly.

"Of course I’m thinking for the benefit of my family! I understand Chen Xiang a lot more than you guys, if we can rope him in, it will benefit the entire Mu Rong family, which is why I worked hard to persuade him to come and see you! Previously, he was very wary of you and refused to come over even if he had to. It seems like he was right. " Murong Honglian said.

"What benefits do we have to win him over? You are just a woman, and you have a short-sighted mind. " When Senior Master saw Murong Honglian use such a tone to talk to him, he became even more furious.

"Before, you accused me of not thinking about the family, but now that I’ve said what I think, you say that I’m short-sighted? What exactly do you want? " Murong Honglian was also enraged: "Everyone has their own thoughts, now you are forcefully instigating your own thoughts into my head! Besides, the mistake in this matter is with you. Do you want to push the blame onto me? "

"You ..." This Senior Master had already raised his hand, wanting to slap Murong Honglian, but Murong Honglian was not afraid of him.
