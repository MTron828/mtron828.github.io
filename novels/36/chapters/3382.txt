After Bai Peng Girl finished distributing the items, she invited Chen Xiang to board her carriage and head towards the Da Peng Inn.

"Roc Demon Princess, you are not willing to tell me the location of your new home. Are you worried that I will marry you after saving your father? I said it already, I don’t want you, I only want Aohun holy bead. " Chen Xiang said in all seriousness.

The white peng girl’s eyes had a hint of hidden bitterness. She lightly pursed her lips. The person in front of her actually thought so highly of Aohun holy bead.

"I have a name. I’m Peng profoundfei, just call me Xuan Fei."

"Xuan Fei, then can you tell me where Python Demon Race’s new nest is?" Chen Xiang did not give up.

"I already said that I would lend you the Aohun holy bead for a few days. Although it is only a few days, I feel that it should be of great use to you." Peng profoundfei was slightly displeased: "How many times have I said it, Python Demon Race is extremely dangerous, I’m not telling you, it’s for your own good, why are you so stubborn?"

"There isn’t enough time for a few days!" Chen Xiang curled his lips and said: "How about this, I’ll look for him myself. If I really can save your father, your bounty will still be redeemed, right?"

"He will definitely be able to fulfill his promise within a hundred days." Peng profoundfei faintly sighed, "It’s best if you don’t go, it’s really very dangerous!"

"Xuan Fei, since you care about me so much, I must save your father even more!" Chen Xiang laughed: "I originally only thought that Aohun holy bead did not want you, but now I suddenly started to want you. You are truly a nice person, and beautiful, and also have beautiful big wings, don’t be so flirtatious, I have changed my mind!"

Peng profoundfei was startled, her face flushed red, and she could only spit lightly.

"I knew that you didn’t like me. Forget it, I’ll save your father, I only want the Aohun holy bead." Chen Xiang said.

"Young Master Shen, you misunderstand ..." Peng profoundfei immediately explained: "I just don’t want you to be too stubborn about this matter, I will fight for more opportunities in the future to let you come into contact with the Aohun holy bead, I can even give you the time I use the Aohun holy bead, you better not find the Python Demon Race."

"Then I must go even more. You are truly a good person. I will definitely bring your father back." Chen Xiang made a face at Peng profoundfei.

"Humph!" Peng profoundfei was a little angry, she snorted and turned her head, ignoring Chen Xiang.

Chen Xiang, on the other hand, did not mind.

"This Roc Demon Princess is not bad, don’t give it to me, let’s talk." Long Xueyi laughed. "I want her to play with me; her wings must be very fun."

Chen Xiang ignored him as he focused on the beautiful side of Peng profoundfei’s face. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

"Your profile is really pretty. Did you purposely let me see it?" Chen Xiang suddenly said.

"You’re so annoying!" Peng profoundfei frowned, and said with hidden bitterness.

"Then why don’t you treat me to a meal?" Chen Xiang laughed.

Peng profoundfei really did not think that after being alone with Chen Xiang, he would realize that Chen Xiang was actually a little evil. Back when he was in the City Lord’s Mansion earlier, Chen Xiang was still very proper.

"If you stay like this, I won’t let you go." Peng profoundfei said.

"Alright!" Chen Xiang stuck out his tongue.

"Xuan Fei, does your Roc Race have a Grand Roc that was poisoned? Can you successfully cure the poison? " Chen Xiang asked, because he had the antidote pill, but he didn’t know if the antidote pill could help the golden rocs cure the poison.

Furthermore, he was also a little curious about whether the Poisonous Python Demon s were all using the same kind of snake poison.

"Yes!" Why do you ask? " After Peng profoundfei finished speaking, he suddenly thought of something and shouted: "You’re poisoned?"

Peng profoundfei’s jade face was filled with worry and anxiety.

"Of course not." Chen Xiang immediately waved his hand, and laughed: "Thank you for your concern!"

"It scared me to death!" Peng profoundfei closed his eyes and let out a light sigh.

"I just want to see what the symptoms of poisoning are like." Chen Xiang said: "Moreover, I want to study how I can cure the poison."

Peng profoundfei shook his head: "The poisoned golden rocs are currently all frozen, sealed in a thick layer of white ice and placed in a hidden, icy secret room. Even I cannot go and see them. The venom of a snake isn’t easy to cure.

"Xuan Fei, answer me honestly. Do you know where the Python Demon Race is?" Chen Xiang asked seriously.

"I only know the general area. I don’t know the specifics, but it’s better if you give up. I won’t tell you." Peng profoundfei’s attitude was extremely resolute.

"Why don’t you bring me to that Ice Cold Secret Room and I’ll help the golden rocs inside detoxify their poison. If I can successfully detoxify their poison, you can tell me where the Python Demon Race is." Chen Xiang said.

"You can cure the poison? What method did you use to detoxify the poison? " Peng profoundfei always thought that Chen Xiang was very mysterious. Chen Xiang was only in the early stages of Aoshi Holy Stage, to be able to defeat someone who had just entered the late stage of Aoshi Holy Stage was already something very hard to understand.

"Detoxification Pill!" Chen Xiang took out a lush green antidote pill and laughed: "This is the antidote pill.

"How do you want to test it?" Peng profoundfei looked at the antidote in Chen Xiang’s hands, and was a little shocked: "You even know how to refine pills!"

Even in the Ao Gu Holy City, there weren’t many Alchemist, they were all treated like treasures by the big powers.

Chen Xiang took out a Heaven devouring rat, then made the Heaven devouring rat turn into a middle-aged man, and said: "If he eats the bones of the Poisonous Python Demon, he should be immediately poisoned.

When Peng profoundfei saw that a mouse had turned into a human, he was shocked. He did not expect Chen Xiang to have mastered so many strange techniques.

"Will he die?" Peng profoundfei was a little worried about the Mouse Man.

"Nope." Chen Xiang said: "As long as you agree, I will immediately test it for you and then you can bring me to that Ice Cold Chamber."

Although he could use the Aohun holy bead for a few days, he was not satisfied with it.

Peng profoundfei was thinking about the most unusual human she had ever seen. When she was serious, she looked very reliable, but when she wasn’t serious, there were some ... Bad!

"Can you really save my father?" Peng profoundfei asked.

"Even if I say yes, you still have to believe me." Chen Xiang sighed: "But you don’t believe me."

"Alright, I believe you! However, you must first take the test, and let me see if you can really detoxify it. " After Peng profoundfei finished speaking, he asked again: "Will this little mouse really be okay?"

"Don’t worry!" Chen Xiang laughed: "Take out the Poisonous Python Demon’s bones."

After Peng profoundfei took out the bone, he controlled the Mouse Man to eat it.

Very quickly, Mouse Man’s skin began to turn black, emitting black Qi.

"Quickly, he’s poisoned, and the poison’s spreading fast!" Seeing that, Peng profoundfei cried out, if it was slow, he would have to use the Icy cold power to freeze it.

Chen Xiang quickly let the Mouse Man eat the antidote pill, and he saw that the pure black face of the Mouse Man had slowly recovered its snow-white color, and the snake poison was slowly being dispelled.

Peng profoundfei watched as Mouse Man gradually recovered. He was shocked speechless.
