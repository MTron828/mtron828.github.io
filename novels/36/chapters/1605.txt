Chen Xiang thought for a while, "Is it because I have the Divine Deity that you can’t calculate it?"

"What? You have Divine Deity?" Huang Jintian was so surprised that she jumped: "No wonder you suddenly became so powerful, so that’s how it is, looks like that white dragon is fine, and it also has Divine Deity, this kind of thing, she should really be a Heavenly Dragon Supreme Lord."

"That’s impossible, her Divine Deity was borrowed by the Ten Heavens Supreme Lord. After the death of the Ten Heavens Supreme Lord, her Divine Deity accompanied his soul to hell and was suppressed by the Hell Devil Emperor. The Ten Heavens Supreme Lord also said that it’s impossible for her Divine Deity to be taken back." Chen Xiang sat on the ground and started thinking.

This made Chen Xiang feel a lot more at ease. He felt that it was also true, if Long Xueyi did not have the Divine Deity, it would be difficult for him to defeat that Dragon Emperor. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Huang Jintian, who had originally been very worried about the dangers of this place, was extremely happy when he found out that Chen Xiang had the Divine Deity.

"Let’s stay here for a little longer and help me kill some Saint Beasts. You’re already stronger than me, so you have to help master increase his strength." Huang Jintian laughed, "Anyway, your Dragon Subduing School is watched by so many old emperors, nothing will happen to you."

"Master, you should be hoping that I can refine a Holy Pellet as soon as possible. When that happens, you definitely won’t be interested in any Holy Beasts." Chen Xiang laughed, after knowing that Leng Youlan and Leng Youlan were alright, Chen Xiang’s mood relaxed a lot.

"What’s more, this is the Heavenly Dragon Realm. What’s the point in killing normal Holy Beasts? If you want to kill them, then kill those Heavenly Dragons." Chen Xiang chuckled.

Huang Jintian curled his lips: "I don’t want to be chased by the Dragon Emperor, this is his territory. When we don’t have absolute power, by all means, do not come into conflict with the Heavenly Dragon Race."

"The sky is about to turn dark. We can continue on our journey at daybreak." Chen Xiang jumped onto the big tree, made a tree hole in the thick tree trunk, and then laid down comfortably inside, while Huang Jintian sat outside the tree hole.

"Master, when Lv Zhen came out of the Devil-killing Summit, it was Lv Zhen who secretly passed on the skills to me when I was dealing with the Demon Emperor. He allowed me to learn the Devil Slayer God wind, so what kind of secrets are hiding inside the Devil-killing Summit?" Chen Xiang lied inside the tree cave and thought back to the Devil-killing Summit he saw.

"I only know that Devil-killing Summit was created by a god, and this god should be from inside the tomb. Although that guy made a tomb, he isn’t really dead, he would come back alive once every few days, and obviously, his opponent is that Hell Devil Emperor."

"No wonder." Chen Xiang suddenly felt that the Devil-suppressing Heavenly Venerable Lv Zhen should be related to the spirit inside the tomb, if not he would not have understood so many powerful Devil-suppressing kungfu s.

"Who did you learn those demonic arts from? There’s no need to hide it from me, right?" Huang Jintian said: "As far as I know, only the Demon Emperor knows about those demon arts. Could it be that the Demon Emperor has resurrected and secretly imparted it to you?"

"It was passed to me by a descendant of the Ruthless Devil Venerable." Chen Xiang said.

"Isn’t Ruthless Devil Venerable the guy who entered the Nine Heaven Devil Palace and didn’t come out? His descendants seem to be two women ..." Huang Jintian took out the ancient book that he had written about major events as he quickly flipped through the pages.

"Ruthless Devil Venerable has two disciples. One is called Su Meiyao, the other is Bai Youyou from the Mo Tian Bai’s family. Su Meiyao’s pill techniques are unparalleled, and he was able to master the Demon Emperor’s unique skills. The two of them were both famous female experts at that time." Huang Jintian sighed: "You little bastard, you actually obtained the inheritance of these two women so early."

Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou’s mother were Su Meiyao’s Leader, and his master was the reincarnated Ruthless Devil Venerable of the Demon Emperor. The two of them were both Strong of Lord Stage, so Chen Xiang wasn’t worried about their enemies at the moment.

"Who is their enemy? They said it was hard to hide from that enemy." Chen Xiang said: "Their enemy should be a woman."

Huang Jintian continued to read the ancient book, and said: "Their enemies are truly formidable, according to the ancient records of my Undead Race, the strongest enemy that chased them all those years ago, should be the heavily injured Mei Emperor."

"Mei Emperor, what kind of Emperor is this? There isn’t such a fellow in Nine Emperors and Five Venerables, right?" Chen Xiang asked anxiously.

"There isn’t any in the Nine Emperors and Five Venerables. The main thing is that this guy’s reputation is too bad, because she is a very vicious woman. It is said that Divine Craftsmen, Dan Emperor, Sword Emperor and the others were all deceived by her." Huang Jintian laughed sinisterly: "The Charm Emperor is a very powerful woman, back then she bewitched and bewitched a lot of strong warriors, even if they obtained her body, they would have to pay a heavy price."

Chen Xiang understood what Huang Jintian meant and could not believe it: "Are you saying that the God Craftsmen, Dan Emperor and the others all had that kind of relationship with this woman? It’s so chaotic."

"I don’t know about that, but you are very familiar with the Divine Craftsmen. You can go back and ask him." Huang Jintian laughed.

"The Mei Emperor heard that he was injured. I don’t know who he was, but it’s very possible that he was the Demon Emperor or the Ten Heavens Supreme Lord. The Demon Emperor used to have too many women, so it’s hard for the Mei Emperor to seduce him. Huang Jintian said: "I think it’s very likely that the Demon Emperor had injured her, that’s why he chased after Bai Youyou and Su Meiyao who possess the Demon Arts."

"This... Actually, the Ruthless Devil Venerable is the reincarnation of the Demon Emperor and also Bai Youyou’s father. His name is Bai Yaowei and he is the one who sat together with the Phoenix King. " Chen Xiang said.

"So that’s how it is. I had thought that guy was not simple before." Huang Jintian suddenly came to a realization, and then, he opened the ancient book, and quickly recorded down some things on it.

Chen Xiang asked again, "Master, does this ancient book have any information about Ruthless Devil Venerable’s sister? The little sister and the Imperial Avian Race’s undead bird gave birth to a girl, who was Ruthless Devil Venerable’s niece. Back then, in order to protect Su Meiyao and him, she disguised herself to kill them.

Huang Jintian was startled for a moment, and said: "I should hand over the record to you. Why do you know so many things?"

Chen Xiang curled his lips: "It’s probably because of my woman’s fate that isn’t bad. That Yu Yi Immortal Fairy is currently the Ji Meixian in the Hundreds of Flowers Palace, and the one who just joined the Hundreds of Flowers Palace, she was a spy that I arranged to stay in the White Sea Imperial Land."

"You brat, how many more things have you done secretly?" Suddenly, Huang Jintian felt that Chen Xiang had hidden many big things, "Tell me some of the more important things so that I can record them down, I know that you also want to know more secrets, and I will use these to exchange for it."

"Don’t leak it out for now. In the future, you can do whatever you want in a few hundred thousand years." Chen Xiang said.

"No problem, deal." Huang Jintian shouted happily.

Chen Xiang said: "Help me look for the history of the Dongfang family. Beneath the Dongfang profound Realm of the Dongfang family was a set of Vermillion Bird bones. Even now, I am still very curious about what happened."
