Chen Xiang could obviously find their location. Using the Six Realms Time and Space Door inside the Six Realms mirrors, he would very quickly lock onto Tang Zhongjie’s location. Tang Zhongjie was also with them right now.

After Chen Xiang teleported over, he arrived at a stone hut, where Luo Tianjun, Tang Zhongjie and Fang Haoyun were gathered.

"Where’s the Dragon Ancestor?" Just as Chen Xiang asked that, he saw a flash of sadness in Luo Tianjun’s eyes, followed by anger on his face.

"It’s here!" Luo Tianjun sighed and took out a pearl.

Chen Xiang looked at the shining golden pearl and immediately understood that this was the soul of the World Defying Stage Dragon Ancestor, to think that the World Defying Stage Dragon Ancestor would be in such a predicament!

"Who did it?" Chen Xiang immediately thought of the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain.

Previously, Luo Tianjun and the others stayed in the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain. At that time, they had planned to use the resources of the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain to cultivate, but now, they did not expect it to turn out like this.

"Is it the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain?" Chen Xiang asked.

"It’s World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect ... Myriad Tao Divine Mountain wanted to force us to join them, but we refused, so they allowed us to leave! However, not long after we left the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain, we were noticed by the World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect. " Luo Tianjun clenched his fists, the muscles on his face twitching as he endured the immense anger.

It was actually done by the World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect, but Chen Xiang felt that the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain must have sold out their location, borrowed their strength to kill them, and made them ambush Luo Tianjun and the others!

"These Myriad Tao Divine Mountain fellows are really vicious!" Chen Xiang took a deep breath: "If I hadn’t caused such a huge loss to them, they might not have been affected by the Dragon Ancestor."

With regards to this matter, Chen Xiang still somewhat blamed himself!

"It’s none of your business ... Myriad Tao Divine Mountain had his eyes on Xiao Long a long time ago! because a little dragon has a very high chance of becoming a World Defying beast. " Luo Tianjun shook his head, then asked: "What did the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain lose? How come we didn’t know? "

Luo Tianjun knew that Chen Xiang was able to return to the Natural Law World. There was also a Myriad Tao Divine Mountain in the Natural Law World, it wouldn’t be strange if Chen Xiang could do something about it.

"The Myriad Tao’s treasure is in my hands, and Myriad Tao Divine Mountain knows about this!" Chen Xiang said: "The reason they didn’t tell World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect the truth was because they wanted to personally find me and seize the Myriad Tao’s treasure ... In order to find me and force me to hand over the Myriad Tao’s treasure smoothly, they planned to use their strongest powers to capture our friends and relatives in Natural Law World and use them to threaten me. "

"But I have long seen through their tricks, so we made our move against the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain ahead of time. When the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain sent their men down from the Divine Wasteland, we killed many of their World Defying Stage s and even destroyed their Myriad Tao Divine Mountain s. Furthermore, before this, I even killed a World Defying Stage of theirs. "

After hearing what Chen Xiang said, Luo Tianjun and the other two took a deep breath. It was almost enough to shake the foundations of the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain. No wonder the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain was in such a hurry to let them join.

"Well done!" Luo Tianjun could not help but praise him. He patted Chen Xiang’s shoulder and said, "Don’t blame yourself for being Xiao Long, if he knows about this, he would be very happy too! You have also become very powerful, and I might not even be your match! "

How could Luo Tianjun not see through Chen Xiang’s cultivation? He did not expect that not long after separating from Chen Xiang, Chen Xiang’s strength would actually surpass his. According to Chen Xiang’s current progress, stepping into the cultivation world of the Primordial Divine Body was just around the corner.

"En, I will give you guys some pills to eat. At that time, you will also have the strength to fight against Myriad Tao Divine Mountain and World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect!" Chen Xiang said: "I will definitely avenge the Dragon Ancestor!"

At this time, the only thing that remained of World Defying Stage Dragon Ancestor’s weak soul, was the hand that World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect used!

"En!" Even though Luo Tianjun had once reigned over this world, he had still missed out on a lot of time. During the period of time he was sealed, it was difficult for him to improve, otherwise, he might have already cultivated the Primordial Divine Body.

"Just give them two! Now that I have seen how powerful you are, I can rest at ease and go into seclusion. " Luo Tianjun said: "If they can cultivate the Primordial Divine Body, I can too!"

When Luo Tianjun returned to the Myriad Tao Mausoleum, he did it for the sake of closed-door cultivation in peace. Although the Myriad Tao Mausoleum was dilapidated and the large array was also riddled with holes, this place was after all something that he had spent a lot of effort to build, and he had even built a secret place to hide himself.

Chen Xiang had only reached large success in World Defying Holy Body now, but he had not reached its peak yet! He felt that he still had a lot of pressure when facing World Defying Stage’s Divine Level Rankers!

Luo Tianjun went into seclusion very quickly, and Chen Xiang entered a secret room to refine Tianyuan holy body Dan!

He only needed to refine two pills to allow Fang Haoyun, Tai Zun realm and the others to step into the World Defying Stage’s Sacred Stage.

He quickly finished refining the pill and fed it to them. Then, he continued to refine the pill!

The pill he refined this time was not the kind that could help people increase their strength, but it was one that had a strong offensive power!

Thinking about the World Defying Stage Dragon Ancestor, he was extremely angry. If he did not do something to the World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect, he would not be able to take this lying down.

"The Eclipse Tree is very old, the refined God-eclipse powder should have very good effects." Chen Xiang looked at the very old giant tree inside the You Yao Mountain Villa. He had grown this tree for a very, very long time. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Previously, he had used this kind of God-eclipse powder to attack many strong warriors.

Other than that, Chen Xiang also planned to refine an even stronger Wangwo scent!

"I wonder what will happen to the Wangwo scent that was refined using the derivation method and the Crash method!" Chen Xiang also wanted to see the results: "With the Wangwo scent added on, even I feel a little scared myself!"

There were many Wangwo flower in his You Yao Mountain Villa. He had instructed the Mei Jing Sisters for them to carefully cultivate and breed many high quality Wangwo flower!

"Let’s try refining the God-eclipse powder first!"

Chen Xiang took a large amount of medicinal herbs from the Heaven Eclipsing Tree and began to refine it!

Those medicinal ingredients were not stubborn and were easily refined by him. After that, he began to refine them using the combination of the derived method and the Crash method!

"He should be able to carry out two rounds!" Chen Xiang estimated the strength of the medicinal herbs.

If it was used on Tianyuan holy body Dan, without Feng Ke’er’s help, it would be difficult for him to complete even one round. However, the medicinal energy of the Heaven Eclipsing Tree was not that strong, so he could complete two rounds of the cycle without Feng Ke’er’s help.

"Refining into powder or refining into a pill that can explode?" Chen Xiang asked Feng Ke’er. In the past, he had always refined them into powder and scattered them everywhere.
