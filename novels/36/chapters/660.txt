Chen Xiang sat on a stone bench in the valley. He was eating a kind of purple honey. The sweet taste of the honey made him start to eat.

Yan Zilan took off a purple robe, and with a face full of hidden bitterness: "It’s best if you just came to buy medicinal pellets from me."

This was of course the biggest reason for Chen Xiang to come here. He smiled and said, "I’m here to look for my fiancee. Is Yanyao here?"

"Of course she’s here, but she’s cultivating in seclusion, so she’s preparing to cross Nirvana Doom. When are you going to return to Mortal Martial Realm?" Yan Zilan asked.

Chen Xiang was slightly stunned. He remembered that he didn’t tell Yan Zilan that he came from the Mortal Martial Realm.

"I don’t think I’ve told you where I came from, right?" Chen Xiang said.

"No, but I can guess that we, the upper echelons of the forces, all know that Fan Yakun has gone to the Mortal Realm, and then, that your relationship with him was very good. Originally, I was only guessing, but when Yanyao said that you would leave, and that you and your married couple were fake, I was sure." Yan Zilan smiled sweetly, "Don’t worry, that’s only my guess. Because you urgently need a large batch of Ground level Pills, I think there should be very little in Mortal Realm."

Chen Xiang stuck out his tongue: "That’s right, right now I can only forge Earth Grade Low Rank Dan s, so I want upper or middle Ground level s, I will be returning very soon."

Yan Zilan smiled slightly: "Don’t you think that Yanyao didn’t tell me that?"

"When I told her, I wasn’t afraid she would tell, and I believed her."

Chen Xiang spread his hands: "Zi Lan, how many high rank Ground level pills do you have now?"

Yan Zilan chuckled, and looked at Chen Xiang with a teasing and coquettish gaze, then said leisurely: "I’ve been worried about you these past few days, and yet you’re in such a hurry to talk about this upon meeting me, you really don’t understand."

"You can return to the Mortal Realm, that’s why you’re not afraid of the Chaotic Mountain, right?"

Chen Xiang laughed: "Sister Zi Lan, you really care about me, a nobody in the mortal world, you have made me happy." Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

"Hmph, no matter what, we are now friends. You said that I’m no longer alone, so of course I care about you!" Yan Zilan rolled his eyes at Chen Xiang and snorted.

Chen Xiang sighed, "Zi Lan, it may be a long time before I return to the Sacred Dan Realm."

"So when you left, you were going to go all out?" Yan Zilan asked softly, his voice was filled with worry.

Chen Xiang nodded his head, "I want those three Chaos fire, then I’ll leave the Sacred Dan Realm!"

"I can help you, make you return to the Mortal Realm without leaving a single regret, and help you snatch that Chaos fire no matter what!" Yan Zilan’s eyes flashed with autumn waves as he looked at Chen Xiang affectionately, making him feel as if he was suddenly struck by lightning.

Chen Xiang’s heart suddenly jumped. Don’t look at Yan Zilan’s pitiful and beautiful eyes that could melt him, and shook his head: "No need, Sister Zi Lan, as a woman, with your status today, I cannot let your years of hard work go to waste."

Yan Zilan scoffed, "Don’t tell me you want to go there yourself? If you go, you might not be able to come back, but I can.

Long Xueyi suddenly said: "I have a way to get help from the beautiful White Tiger!"

"What method?" Chen Xiang asked anxiously.

"That White Tiger beauty was born from the stars. That’s another way of nurturing the descendants of the White Tiger’s special species. I just remembered it." Long Xueyi said: "Those are White Tiger Race s who have been wandering in the vast starry sky all year round. However, their cultivation method is very special, they just swallow and kill stars."

"And then?" Chen Xiang asked.

"Therefore, they have a special kind of power. It’s able to sense the stars and absorb their power. It’s also able to summon a few stars to descend onto the ground for them to cultivate."

Long Xueyi paused for a moment before continuing, "It’s just that the White Tiger I met outside earlier didn’t seem to cultivate using this method, but she definitely understood how to make her summon a falling star and catch those strong warriors unprepared. Then, I’ll join hands with you and snatch that Chaos fire away."

Chen Xiang said: "Sister Zi Lan, let Bai Xing help me, she has a way."

Yan Zilan shook her head: "No, although Bai Xing is very strong, I cannot let her be in danger. She is also my friend, I can help you."

"Bai Xing and Yun Zhu have been together with me for many years. They are like sisters, both of them have previous experiences of being abandoned and alienated by others. I don’t want them to run away."

Chen Xiang said: "No need for her to appear there. I just need her to help me with a little thing! Sister Zi Lan, since you trust them so much, please call them over. We will discuss this together and don’t worry.

"Trust me!"

Yan Zilan saw Chen Xiang’s resolute and deep eyes, nodded, and then floated away.

Very quickly, Yun Zhu and Bai Xing arrived.

"Bai Xing greets senior ..." Bai Xing bowed towards Chen Xiang, causing Yan Zilan to let out a sweet snort as she pinched Chen Xiang.

"I’m not some senior." Chen Xiang anxiously said: "Sister Zi Lan, how did she come to think of it?"

Yun Zhu and Bai Xing both treated Chen Xiang as an expert, because there were very few men who could enter the Zi Lan Mountain Valley.

Now that they saw Yan Zilan pinching Chen Xiang like this, they could tell that the relationship between Yan Zilan and Chen Xiang wasn’t ordinary. It’s just that they felt that Yan Zilan was this old man ...

Chen Xiang anxiously took off his old clothes, revealing his handsome and angular face, upon seeing his face, both Yun Zhu and Bai Xing were stunned.

"Chen Xiang!" Bai Xing shouted, her face slightly bulging, and thinking back to how she had called Chen Xiang senior before, she was embarrassed and angry at the same time.

"I’m sorry." Chen Xiang immediately apologized.

"I’m not angry with you, I’m furious with myself. What’s more ... "How could I dare to be angry with you?" Bai Xing bit her lips lightly, because Chen Xiang was severely injured, and that was refined from the body of a White Tiger Divine Beast.

Yun Zhu and Yan Zilan were a little shocked, because they could see that Bai Xing truly did not dare to be angry with Chen Xiang.

Yan Zilan pinched the flesh on Chen Xiang’s arm without letting it go: "I already said, you’re not allowed to soup my sisters."

"Sis, it’s none of her business." Bai Xing hastily stopped him, her beautiful face full of self-blame as she looked at Chen Xiang.

Chen Xiang hurriedly explained: "Sister Zi Lan, I really didn’t do it, and she was a little afraid of me because of this."

Chen Xiang anxiously revealed his Slaughter God’s Hand, upon seeing the pair of tiger gloves, Yan Zilan and Yun Zhu immediately understood, and were stunned! This was because Bai Xing often told them about the White Tiger Race, and they were naturally aware of the latter, especially Yan Zilan. She never expected that Chen Xiang would actually possess such a divine weapon, an existence that surpassed Holy-ranked equipment!

When Yun Zhu and Bai Xing saw that Yan Zilan was together with the person who placed the bounty on Chaotic Mountain, they could not help but panic in their hearts. They did not want Yan Zilan to offend such a powerful force like Chaotic Mountain.
