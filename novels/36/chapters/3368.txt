Shen Xiang saw Centaur’s look of death at this moment, and his heart was speechless. The Centaur archery was just awesome, cool, but now it has become this bear.

“I can’t kill you, but you almost killed me just now. You scared me to know?”

Shen Xiang’s voice is full of threats and says: “So, you have to give me some compensation… Are there any precious things on your body?”

Centaur has been poisoned. He seems to know that he has a very powerful poison. Even if he uses his strong strength, he can only slowly push the poison away. If he wants to detoxify himself, it will take a long time. .

“Big brother, I am sorry! I came out to hunt here. I thought that everything here is prey, and you look… it looks like… like a monkey, that is a monkey!” Centaur said with a sad face: “If I Knowing that you are human, I will never fight.”

Shen Xiang expression A cold: “I am like a monkey? Have you seen a monkey so handsome? It seems that you don’t want to live, actually say that I am like a monkey!”

Centaur stunned, more panicked, hastily shouted: “No, no, it’s all my eyes, I’m wrong, you guys don’t care about villains, let me go, I’m still young, don’t want to die, big brother!”

“As for your bear, I am too lazy to kill you.” Shen Xiang coldly snorted: “Quickly hand over your good things, I may be able to spare you, or I will take you to feed the monkeys.”

Shen Xiang showed the three poisonous monkeys and saw the three little monkeys. Centaur had a fear on his face because he was poisoned by the three monkeys.

“I… I have no good things on my body,” Centaur said.

“In this case, I can only send you on the road.” Shen Xiang touched the blade, said with a sneer: “My three monkeys are starving! Don’t worry, when your body is foraging, you already Dead, I can’t feel the pain.”

Centaur was frightened and cried out. This made Shen Xiang didn’t know whether to cry or laugh. This guy also looks like a horse. He cried when he cried.

“Big brother, I am really wrong, you let me go!” Centaur did know that he was wrong, regretted it, and regretted crying.

“There must be something good in you.” Shen Xiang coldly snorted, he suddenly felt that the Centaur was not only worried, but also a bit stupid.

“No… can’t give it to you.” Centaur swallowed and then courageously said, “You can’t die for you!”

Shen Xiang thought about it and said, “Okay, I won’t kill you, I will help you detoxify!”

Centaur heard it, and I was so happy that I quickly said, “Thank you, I will not attack you again in the future.”UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Wait, don’t be too happy! I just came to this ghost place, I am not familiar with life. You need to take me a ride and take me to a place with humans. I will ride on you. It will feel very good.” Not bad,” said Shen Xiang.

“No, I can’t be riding, and I can’t die.” Centaur said reluctantly.

“Well, this won’t work, that won’t work, I can only take you to feed the monkeys.” Shen Xiang let the three poisonous monkeys release the claws with acute poison.

After Centaur saw it, he almost cried out. He was a noble Centaur. How can he feed the monkey?

“I can give you good things, but not the one on me. I will take you to a place where there are many good things, can you get them, look at yourself,” Centaur suddenly said.

Shen Xiang coldly snorted: “How is this called? It is clear that I have to get it myself. What the hell is it?”

“dao creation saint stone, don’t you know if you have heard of it?” Centaur said: “This thing belongs to me, but it was taken over, but I know where it is hidden!”

Shen Xiang was screaming in the heart, actually it was dao creation saint stone.

“How big is it?” Shen Xiang expression does not move: “dao creation saint stone I also have it, but if it is too small, it is not worth the risk.”

“There are only two in total!” Centaur sighed. “It was mine.”

Shen Xiang suddenly thinks that this Centaur is not simple, I can know this kind of thing, but how does he seem so shackled?

“Well, you take me, I can see if I can get it! Also, don’t play tricks, or if you are caught by me, I won’t kill you, it will make you feel better than death.” Shen Xiang gloomy and cold smiled and scared the Centaur for a while.

Shen Xiang took Detoxification Dan, and this Detoxification Dan was only able to temporarily ease the situation, not affected by the Strange Intoxicating Spirit Poison. When the drug of Detoxification Dan failed, the Strange Intoxicating Spirit Poison will break out again.

“You don’t think you can completely detoxify if you eat it. You need to eat a few more to completely detoxify, so don’t play tricks, or you will suffer yourself,” Shen Xiang said.

Centaur grimaced and ate the Detoxification Dan, and the strength gradually recovered.

“Big Brother, your poison is really powerful!” Centaur said, now he doesn’t dare to talk about Shen Xiang anymore, but he is very afraid of Shen Xiang’s three poisonous monkeys, very terrible.

“What is your name?” Shen Xiang asked.

“Ma Tianhai, what about your big brother?”

“Shen Xiang…Hurry and take me to the dao creation saint stone.” Shen Xiang said that if you can get two dao creation saint stones, then the harvest is not small.

Ma Tianhai nodded and ran wildly.

I have to admit that this Centaur runs very fast.

“You guy, wait for me.” Shen Xiang shouted in the back.

Ma Tianhai heard Shen Xiang’s shouting and immediately slowed down, and Shen Xiang followed.

“You can’t run on me?” Shen Xiang complained. “Your speed is very fast, and you are still a horse.”

“No, absolutely not.” Ma Tianhai’s voice is very determined, and he will not die.

“Okay!” Shen Xiang can only count, completely dispelling the idea of ​​this Centaur.

Shen Xiang followed Ma Tianhai, shuttled through the forest and asked him many things.

This forest is very large. It is called Soul Demon Sacred Forest. There are all kinds of Soul Demon gathered here. There are also many human beings. The strength of human beings here is only flat, but the number is quite small.

Shen Xiang learned that most of these humans came from the World Defying Soul River. There is no human being here. Shen Xiang guessed that there was a period of time in the past, and World Defying Soul River was very good. There are quite a few humans coming over.

Ma Tianhai is now taking Shen Xiang to the site of their Centaur Soul Demon, Centaur Sacred City, a very huge city, where Ma Tianhai says there are millions of Soul Demons and humans.

This is indeed a very big city.

“There are so many Soul Demon on the opposite side of World Defying Soul River!” After Qin Shuang learned it in Hidden Jade Villa, it was a surprise, and the number was much more than the human side.

There are only a few million in a big city, and on the other side, when the small city of Sky River Mountain Range is full, there are only a few hundred thousand people. There are a lot of huge thousand people in the big city.
