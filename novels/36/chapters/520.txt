Chapter 521 Zuo Zhenxuan

Chen Xiang laughed as he struck his palm towards the iron cage, producing ten sounds of explosion, “Pa Pa Pa Pa Pa Pa ...” Just like the old man, he also created ten successive echoes. This was the tenth level of Demon Subduing Force.

The old man, who was originally proud of himself, was now dumbfounded as he looked at Chen Xiang with disbelief. The other people in the cage almost had their eyes pop out of their sockets. That old man was the former principle of the Academy, so it was not surprising that he could cultivate his Demon Subduing Force to the tenth level, but Chen Xiang seemed just like a young man, while he also learned the tenth level of Demon Subduing Force.

“How could it be possible? Could it be that the Demon Subduing Force is now easy to cultivate?” The old man gulped. If that was the case, he felt that he could crash his head into the wall and die. He had painstakingly trained for so long before he was able to reach the tenth level, but now a little brat was also able to do it as well, which made him feel pretty uncomfortable.

“Of course not, the old hag is only at the ninth level of Demon Subduing Force. I just used the strength of tenth level of Demon Subduing Force to kill a person who provoked me in front of her and butt her. That’s why I am imprisoned here.” Chen Xiang shook his head and sighed.

“So, former principle, what’s your name? I never see any records of you in the history books of the Demon Subduing Academy.” Chen Xiang said.

“My name is Zuo Zhenxuan. Have you really never seen my name in the historical records of the Academy?” The old man was infuriated. He had made such a huge contribution to the school, but now his name was removed from the records. Some people had done their best to spread their name throughout the ages, but now, he did not have any reputation.

Chen Xiang nodded his head, “I still have those history books with me."

With that, he took out a book, but he couldn’t show it to Zuo Zhenxuan because there was a formation array inside and between their iron cages.

“Put it on the ground. I can see it!” Zuo Zhenxuan said.

After Chen Xiang landed the book on the ground, he saw Zuo Zhenxuan’s eyebrows knitted together. Chen Xiang felt a weak power coming toward him. The book started to quickly flip through, and it only took him a moment to finish flipping through it before moving forward from the back to the front again.

Zuo Zhenxuan’s old face twitched as he read the book. His rage was unparalleled as he suddenly burst out in wild laughter, “Hah, hah, hah ...you damned old woman, how dare you she wipe out my ten thousand years of contributions to the Demon Subduing Academy. As long as I get the chance, I will definitely die with you!”

Chen Xiang didn’t know why, but he suddenly felt happy in his heart. He also hated that old woman called Liu Yufang. He did not take this old woman deserve the position of principal. She was simply a virtuous woman.

Originally, Chen Xiang had planned to use some time to break the formation, but seeing how much this old woman hated this old maiden, he immediately got a plan.

“Former principle, how much confidence do you have to beat that old woman?” Chen Xiang suddenly used his divine sense to send a message to the old man.

Zuo Zhenxuan immediately calmed down. He knew that Chen Xiang was extraordinary. To be able to reach the tenth level of Demon Subduing Force at such a young age, he must have some outstanding points. Moreover, he was filled with admiration for Chen Xiang for him to dare offend Liu Yufang,

“Hmph, if she hasn’t reached the tenth level of Demon Subduing Force, I would be fully confident! Last time, they got many people sieging me and set me up to get me in here.” Zuo Zhenxuan responded with his divine sense.

Chen Xiang’s thoughts shifted, “alright, I can let you out, but you must promise me one condition. You must leave the old woman alive for me to slaughter her! This way it will be the hatred only between she and I; and the Heavenly Realm can only blame me alone.”

Zuo Zhenxuan didn’t even think before agreeing, "as long as you let me out, I will do my best to capture that old woman for you to deal with. At that time, you can still stay in the school. I will retrieve the position as a principle.”

Not long after he finished speaking, Chen Xiang’s entire body trembled. Then a wave of white mist drifted out and filled the entire dungeon. It made people feel as if they were in a vast expanse of whiteness, while nothing was visible.

This was something Chen Xiang let out on purpose. He did it so that he wouldn’t be seen by others when he used the Luotian Gate.

Luotian Gate allowed people to traverse space. These formations did not seal off space, so Chen Xiang easily opened a door and arrived at Zuo Zhenxuan’s iron cage.

Feeling Chen Xiang’s sudden arrival, Zuo Zhenxuan was overjoyed. He hurriedly grabbed Chen Xiang’s wrist and said, “brat, you’re my savior!”

Chen Xiang laughed, “let’s leave here first!" After that, he opened another space gate and pulled Zuo Zhenxuan inside. They arrived at a beach where the waves were crashing into. This was a small island by the coast of the King’s Continent, quite a distance away from the Demon Subduing Academy.

Chen Xiang was taking a huge risk by doing this. If Zuo Zhenxuan was a villain, then he would be in trouble. That’s why he came to the beach, because this place was advantageous for him to escape through water in a very short period.

However, what made Chen Xiang feel at ease was that once Zuo Zhenxuan saw the sky full of stars and the boundless sea that was illuminated by the moonlight, he immediately knelt in front of Chen Xiang and said, “little brother, please accept my bow!”

“Sir, please get up. I can’t take it!” Chen Xiang hurriedly helped Zuo Zhenxuan up.

Zuo Zhenxuan didn’t ask how Chen Xiang managed to get him out. He knew that it was someone else’s secret. He just jumped into the sea to wash his body.

“My name is Chen Xiang, and I entered the school more than a month ago. At that time, I thought that it was a pretty good place, but later on ...” Chen Xiang told Zuo Zhenxuan about his experience at the school. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

When Zuo Zhenxuan heard this, he said, “that is the damned old woman, she does not change at all. Hehe, I still have to thank her for that. If she didn’t bring you in, perhaps I wouldn’t have been able to come out."

“Haha ...” Chen Xiang laughed out loud. He knew that he would soon be able to kill that old woman with his own hands.

Zuo Zhenxuan acted as a principle. He kept his composure. Although he was furious before, he didn’t shout for revenge after he came out.

“It seems that apart from chancellor Zhao Tao and Yu Baixiang, the other old things have all been subdued by that old woman! I guess I’ll have to think it over later.” After Zuo Zhenxuan washed up, he put on a set of clean clothes. He also had an invisible storage treasure, so many things were not taken away from him.

After washing up and changing into a new set of clothes, Zuo Zhenxuan gave off the air of an immortal, leaving Chen Xiang a very benevolent feeling.

“Sir, if you can take back the control of Demon Subduing Academy, could you permit my wife and sister to enter the Stellar Transposition Realm Realm?” This was also a primary reason for Chen Xiang risked helping Zuo Zhenxuan out.

Zuo Zhenxuan answered straightforwardly, “no problem, but that Stellar Transposition Realm is very special. A person can only stay inside for ten days at most, which would be ten years of time inside, then the realm will be useless for him or her! But I can let them stay inside for ten more days!”

“Hah hah, I control all the formidable features of the Stellar Transposition Realm. Otherwise, the Demon Subduing Academy wouldn’t have made such a rigid restriction on it. I dare to say that no more than people have entered the Stellar Transposition Realm for the past three hundred years!”
