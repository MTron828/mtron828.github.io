Chen Xiang participating in the competition was also to see the strength of Leng Youlan and Mu Qianxiang. He had also heard that Yun Xiaodao and the others participated as well, so it was not bad to have a match with these old friends of his.

"I know how to act!" Chen Xiang would obviously not harm Leng Youlan and her, these were her sisters.

When Chen Xiang arrived at the Hundred Flowers Pavilion, he found that Yan Zilan had something he needed to talk to him about. It seemed to be an urgent matter.

"Sister Zi Lan, isn’t the competition still a few days away?" When Chen Xiang arrived at the top of Hundred Flowers Pavilion, Yan Zilan was already waiting for him in the hall.

"Yes, there are still a few more days. I just found out about some of the competition’s specific details. I’ll tell you first so that you can prepare." Yan Zilan took out a small booklet: "All of them are registrants. When the time comes, we will draw lots to decide our opponents!"

Chen Xiang took the booklet and looked through it, and as expected, he saw Yun Xiaodao and a few other familiar names.

"Yanran and Lan Lan are not participating!" Chen Xiang laughed: "Could it be that your Hundreds of Flowers Village only sent You Lan and Qianxiang?" Chen Xiang said.

"Yanran and Lan Lan are not interested in any of this! If you look again, you should be able to see a familiar name. " Yan Zilan laughed: "Our Hundreds of Flowers Village has sent four disciples, and two of them are not human!"

Not human? Chen Xiang immediately thought of Yun Zhu and Bai Xing, and said: "Could it be Yun Zhu and Bai Xing? I haven’t seen them in a long time. Are they alright? "

"Of course they are, but they are all out on missions. Last time, I contacted them and said that you’re back. They really wanted to come back and see you immediately." Yan Zilan laughed: "The two of them are not participating in the selection either."

Chen Xiang flipped through the booklet, and suddenly saw two very familiar names. "Ji Meixian ... And Xue Ying! "

Xue Ying was that Phoenix Princess who was taken in by Lv Qilian as a disciple.

"Even if it was the Phoenix Princess, she is of the same race as the beautiful fairy, so her strength is also equally matched! Yun Zhu, Bai Xing, the two of them and Little Lizhi are a small team, so they are very efficient in what they do. " Yan Zilan suddenly laughed: "Little Lizhi doesn’t have a good impression of you, but I can see that she truly respects you from the bottom of her heart! I heard from Qilian that you often take liberties with Little Lizhi, and want to make him your wife! "

"This... They’re all just joking! " Chen Xiang burst into laughter. Although Little Lizhi was a spoiled Xiao Linglong, she was very spicy and looked like chili, but once she peeled off that piece of Litchi skin, she couldn’t wait to put it in her mouth. Chen Xiang felt that he had never been able to peel off that layer successfully.

"Right now, only Xue Ying and the beautiful goddess have returned to participate in this competition. Little Lizhi’s group is still outside." Yan Zilan said: "When the time comes, it would be extremely possible for you to face Xue Ying and the beautiful goddess on the stage, hehe."

Chen Xiang said: "Don’t worry, I won’t hurt them. The preliminaries are originally all done by our own people! I also want to try my best to get a place in the competition, Hell Devil Emperor and the others have made such a condition, so they must have full confidence in winning! Maybe they even borrowed a strong helper from the Divine Nations. "

Yan Zilan nodded his head, "Right now, the four of them are undergoing their final training. I heard that the ones in charge of training them are you and your sister Ziqian."

"If they are the instructors, then I will have to be careful when the time comes." He understood Bai Youyou and Bai Ziqian very well. Both of them dared to lay a hand on Bai Ziqian, and they were a little bit demonic in nature.

"What about you? Are you that confident that you’re not prepared? " Yan Zilan chuckled: "To be honest, I also want to see how miserable you got being beaten up by your two younger sisters."

Chen Xiang said snappily: "So even you don’t think well of me! But you will definitely be disappointed, I am so powerful now, even if the two of them are working together, the ones in a sorry state will definitely be them! "

"Anyone can brag." Yan Zilan chuckled: "But don’t worry, they temporarily won’t know about you participating in the selection, so when you’re undergoing training, there won’t be any training aimed at you."

The sky had already darkened, Chen Xiang rushed to the training room and repeatedly practiced his strongest moves. Not only did he need to prepare for the competition, he also needed to prepare to fight against Hell Devil Emperor, so he needed to grab some time to practice.

After a few days, Chen Xiang had already been notified that he would be going to the City Lord’s Mansion to gather tomorrow morning.

These few days, he had been asking Yan Zilan whether or not his team of pill refining was free, and he really wanted to see Hua Xiangyue and Su Meiyao, the two Goblins.

"They are still concocting pills! They are all going to rest for a period of time and then undergo closed-door training to refine a period of time. Right now, it seems that they are both refining low and medium-grade divine pellets, which also requires a very long time. " Yan Zilan said: "They are considered to be the foundation of the Hundreds of Flowers Village. The pills they provide can help us become stronger even faster."

Yue’er flew in. She had just come from Hundreds of Flowers Village.

"Isn’t Bing Yan coming?" Chen Xiang asked. It was already night, and the competition was starting tomorrow morning.

"No, she and Big Sis Long spend all their time discussing cultivation. Sometimes, they go into closed door cultivation very late." Yue’er replied, "She might be coming to watch your match tomorrow. I’ve mentioned this to her before."

Yan Zilan hugged Yue’er, and said with a tender smile: "Yue’er, sleep with me tonight, I’ll go to City Lord’s Mansion with you tomorrow! While you’re at it, tell me about this little scoundrel in the Super God Realm. "

"Alright!" Yue’er was extremely willing as she rubbed her small head against Yan Zilan’s soft chest.

Chen Xiang curled his lips, and returned to his room to rest.

In the middle of the night, Chen Xiang suddenly woke up. He was a little nervous, because he thought that the people fighting with him were his old friends and sister, and he had just returned from Super God Realm. In comparison to the time he had here, he had lost a lot of time! On the other hand, Yun Xiaodao and the others had to cultivate for many years using dragon veins and various pellets before they could gain the strength of six Divine Deity. By then, he would definitely not be weak.

And Leng Youlan had White Dragon Vein, adding on the Dao heart stone that Shui Bingyan provided her with, it was possible that she had already grasped the laws of ice, and her strength was even more unfathomable! What Mu Qianxiang received was the Sword Emperor’s legacy, and since Wang Jinshi was the Sword God’s daughter, he would definitely teach her a lot.

Chen Xiang felt that Wang Jinshi would definitely guide them along with Bai Youyou and Bai Ziqian.

"Xiao Dao and the others are also very powerful, with Devil-killing Heavenly God and Penalty Heavenly God’s guidance, and the Sword God who controls the God Murdering Sword Techniques is also in the Nine Heaven School. Before, Black Dragon and Black Turtle had also been in Nine Heaven School for a while. They had only met up with the White Tiger in Super God Realm for a short period of time. When Chen Xiang thought of all these, he was really a little worried in the depths of his heart. It was just like Wu Kaiming had said, it would not be good if his mighty name was destroyed.

"Junior brother!" Just as Chen Xiang was thinking, there were people knocking on his door, and only Wang Jinshi would call him Junior Brother. He quickly got up and opened the door, and sure enough, he saw Wang Jinshi.
