At the sight of this scene, Chen Xiang’s heartbeat rose slightly. But what made him gnash his teeth was that the mist arising from the jade bed was too dense, he was unable to see the ravishing parts he wanted to see.

Nonetheless, the blurry scene was even more tempting! Earlier, Hua Xiangyue had said that if he came in, he had to wait outside for her, asked him not to move around. However, Chen Xiang didn’t pay any attention to her instructions, for he was in a hurry to see Hua Xiangyue.

Chen Xiang very much wanted to blow air, blow the mist away. That way he could see Hua Xiangyue’s ravishing body clearly. However, he only dared to think about it, he didn’t dare to execute it. In light of these circumstances, he could only sigh in lament. Only then did he noticed that there was a small pond in the room as well. This small pond was just as big as the bed and also had some mist arising from it. However, it wasn’t Spirit Qi at all.

“This is a special kind of hot qi, it should be able to help her cultivate her flames. This seductress is an alchemist, she has very high requirements for flames,” explained Long Xueyi.

“How about I help you blow this mist away?” asked Long Xueyi as she broke into a mischievous laughter.

Chen Xiang very much wanted to agree. He was struggling in his heart. Finally, he still refused, for he was worried that it would affect Hua Xiangyue’s cultivation, which might lead to a qigong deviation, which would be extremely bad.

When he was just about to shut the doors and leave, Hua Xiangyue’s benumbing voice fell into his ears, “Little Rascal, why don’t you come in? I have been waiting for you for a long time!”

Chen Xiang gulped nervously, again and again before coming inside in large strides, “This...Sister Xiangyue, I didn’t see anything!”

Hearing this, Hua Xiangyue broke into a giggle. Then she turned around, putting on a loose white maxi.

“Didn’t I tell you that when anyone comes in, I will know immediately? I asked to wait outside, but you were so unscrupulous! You wanted to peek at me!” Hua Xiangyue gave a sidelong glance at Chen Xiang, that stunning oval face was filled with a bewitching look.

Right afterward, Hua Xiangyue’s voice turned angry, “Little Rascal, did you came looking for me after you couldn’t meet Sister Meng’er, again?”

At this moment, Hua Xiangyue was resorting to her charms. She had put that enticing charm of hers full on display, without any reserve. Seeing this, Chen Xiang could not wait to tear that maxi of her and push her down on the bed, show her that seducing a man like this had serious consequences.

Seeing Chen Xiang blushing, Hua Xiangyue chortled and said, “Never think that only you can tease me, I can also tease you!”

Chen Xiang took a deep breath and said, “If I take liberties with you, I will not be eaten by you absolutely, but if you take liberties with me, hei hei!”

While speaking, Chen Xiang pulled Hua Xiangyue into his embrace suddenly! At present, Hua Xiangyue was only wearing a thin maxi, she wasn’t wearing anything inside. When Chen Xiang hugged her, he could feel the two pointy tips pressing on his chest, which made Chen Xiang’s lower abdomen explode. An evil fire violently rose from his lower body, spreading to his limbs and bones. His heartbeat and body temperature rose at once. He almost lost his mind.

Chen Xiang fiercely inhaled near Hua Xiangyue’s neck, greedily sucking in the sweet fragrance lingering around her body.

Hua Xiangyue gave out a tender shout as she pushed Chen Xiang in a hurry. Her face, on the other hand, had a smug smile, “Little Rascal, you better remember that this Elder Sister is far more powerful than you. You think you can eat me so easily? I am not going to give myself to you, but I can tease you, seduce you. You can only watch but you can’t be able to do anything!”

“Damn witch!” Chen Xiang groaned and turned his head. Who could blame him, he was almost thirty. Although he had a wife, to this date, he was still a virgin.

Hua Xiangyue knew that she could not take things too far. She chortled and said, “I am sorry, I didn’t expect this elder sister’s seduction would be too much for you to handle!”

“Bullshit!” Chen Xiang snorted in a low voice. Just a moment ago, the only thought in his mind was to press her down summarily.

“To what do I owe the pleasure? You are not going to ask me to go around once again, do you?” asked Hua Xiangyue.

Speaking of this, a secretly satisfied Chen Xiang hurriedly took out six jade boxes and said, a smile on his lips, “Of course, I came bearing gifts! To be honest, last time, I took too much advantage of you, therefore, I am here to compensate you!”

Hua Xiangyue nibbled her lips and said in a low voice, “I accept your good intentions, I am very grateful about it, however, I know these things will be very useful to you in the future. These things are getting scarcer and scarcer. If you give them to me now, what are you going use in the future?”

She didn’t even take look. She knew Chen Xiang wanted to give her something. Previously, she was just joking, she didn’t expect Chen Xiang to bear it in mind. This moved her very much, a warmth flooded her heart.

Chen Xiang smiled and said, “Rest assured, I am really not short of them!” He ventured that Hua Xiangyue was about to cross her nirvana tribulation, and for that, she definitely needed these things. Therefore, he would not be stingy about it absolutely. In any case, it was not difficult for him to get them, even a bit.

Hua Xiangyue faintly sighed as she opened those jade boxes. Inside the boxes were the five sets of Resurrection Dan herbs and a Fruit of Fortune as well.

“Don’t tell Sister Meng’er for the time being, she would definitely get jealous,” said Chen Xiang as he broke into a mischievous laugh.

Hua Xiangyue was quite a proficient alchemist. At one glance, she had noticed that these spirit herbs had just been picked, particularly the Fruit of Fortune, which had just been picked from the tree.

At this instant, Hua Xiangyue was struck with a fearful thought. However, there wasn’t any change in her expression, because she had associated it with that golden liquid which Chen Xiang had once fed to Lanlan, it was quite similar to the ten thousand years old Spirit Milk that Danxiang Taoyuan had.

She suspected that Chen Xiang quite possibly had something similar to the ten thousand years old Spirit Milk, owing to which he could grow many herbs quickly. However, the ten thousand years old Spirit Milk was quite scarce, it was simply insufficient to use in large quantity.

“Meng’er is yours, it’s very normal for you to give things to her! However, what am I to you?” Hua Xiangyue had no intentions to refuse Chen Xiang’s kindness. More importantly, she too wanted these things.

A perverted smile crept up on Chen Xiang’s lips immediately as he said, “Didn’t you want to become my maid? Hei hei, is that still valid?”

Hua Xiangyue’s eyes immediately lit up. She pursed her lips into a smile. “Of course! Now, you finally realize how good I am!” While speaking, she charmingly flung her hair. Her charm made the onlooking Chen Xiang burn with passion.

“That’s better! From today, you are my maid!” Chen Xiang, rubbing his hands, said.

“Your maid greets Young Master.” Hua Xiangyue chortled as he hastily bowed to Chen Xiang and continued, “However, You must sign a master-servant contract with me!”

Master-servant contract? Chen Xiang had never heard of such a thing. It was the first time he was hearing.

“What is that?” asked Chen Xiang.

“With this contract, I won’t betray you. However, you also have to act according to the contract. You must take good care of me.” Hua Xiangyue looked at Chen Xiang with a gentle gaze.

Right then, Chen Xiang spotted purple spell diagrams glittering in those pretty eyes of Hua Xiangyue. Suddenly, Chen Xiang was shocked as the content of that contract appeared in his mind.

“It’s done. One day, you will understand why I did this!” Hua Xiangyue said with a complex look. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

At this time, Long Xueyi blurted out all of a sudden, “This is Master-Servant Death Contract. As long as you are dead, this young lady will also die!”
