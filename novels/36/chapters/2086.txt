Chen Xiang looked at the piece of paper on the wall. Leng Youlan’s and Mu Qianxiang’s opponents were both men and they both had quite a background.

"It’s starting. Let’s go to the plaza. Ten fighting stages have been built there. Today, we will be selecting the spots." Wu Kaiming shouted, you all should already know your corresponding stage, just go there and wait.

Chen Xiang was number thirteen, and corresponding to number three, he would only be able to make it to the second round.

Yun Xiaodao was number seven, he could go up right from the beginning, and Leng Youlan and Mu Qianxiang were also the first two.

When they arrived at the large plaza inside the City Lord’s Mansion, the group of girls were already there. Leng Youlan and the others already knew that Chen Xiang was participating, but when they saw that Chen Xiang did not say anything, they secretly rejoiced in their hearts. Although the lots in front were all drawn, they would definitely match later on.

When Ji Meixian saw Chen Xiang and Yun Xiaodao walking over, he frowned: "Chen Xiang, this guy really came. I have always hoped that everyone had the same surname."

"What’s wrong with that? My brother doesn’t have anything to be afraid of, haven’t you heard that you only spent a little time at Super God Realm’s place? But we have been here for many years, and we have such a huge advantage in this aspect, we will definitely be able to beat him. " Leng Youlan made a face at Chen Xiang from afar, sticking out her tongue.

Mu Qianxiang laughed: "Look at Old Pig, he is so calm, he is not afraid of me! But if Old Pig wins, wouldn’t Big Brother be unable to go on to the next round? "

"Yeah, Old Pig is pretty strong!" Leng Youlan was also a little worried. She thought for a moment, then laughed: "It’s fine.

Xue Ying chuckled: "Why don’t you think highly of Chen Xiang? Back then, he was a famous person here! Wasn’t it rumored that he never did anything without confidence? He must be quite confident to be here. "

Chen Xiang walked over, and knocked on Leng Youlan and Mu Qianxiang’s heads, and scolded: "You two girls, you are getting more and more arrogant, to the point where you don’t put me in your eyes anymore, please do not give me the chance, otherwise I will definitely beat you up."

"It’s not certain who will hit who!" Mu Qianxiang touched the place where Chen Xiang was hitting, and laughed.

"Chen Xiang, did you test your Divine Deity? How many Divine Deity do you have? " Wang Jinshi asked. Beside her, Bai Youyou and Bai Ziqian were also very curious, waiting for his answer.

Zhu Rong ran over and said: "There are only four Divine Deity s, they should be the ones with the least Divine Deity here today! Although he has the Bones, he doesn’t need to mind it.

"Really?" Yan Zilan was a little surprised. She thought that Chen Xiang had at least five Divine Deity s.

Chen Xiang nodded.

"Actually it’s not bad, if Chen Xiang had so much time with us, he would have been too godly by now." Zhu Rong said again.

Everyone agreed with Zhu Rong’s words. It was a good thing that Chen Xiang did not stay in the Super God Realm for long, otherwise, the difference in time would have been even greater.

"Old Pig, let my brother win. I want to fight him!" Just as Leng Youlan finished speaking, Chen Xiang pinched her face and laughed: "Youlan, all these years, you really have to discipline her properly! You don’t have to worry. Even if we don’t have a chance to fight today, I’ll definitely fight you when we get back. "

"Really? "Great, you never wanted to fight us before." Leng Youlan was very happy.

Now that everyone knew Chen Xiang’s identity, they had obviously heard of him as an influential figure and he was previously a big shot in their hearts. They didn’t think that he would participate in the selection with them today, and his Divine Deity was so low as well.

Leng Youlan and Mu Qianxiang had already walked over, they were still trying to let Chen Xiang see their performance.

Yun Xiaodao also walked up to Stage Seven. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

"How strong is Wang Jing?" Chen Xiang asked.

"He is the disciple of the Penalty Heavenly God, and received many legacies from the Penalty Heavenly God. He is also a genius and very young, and many people like the Penalty Heavenly God praise him!" Wang Jinshi said: "Previously, there were many people who secretly made various analyses and comparisons, and all of them felt that Wang Jing was stronger than Xiao Dao."

"Chen Xiang, do you really only have four Divine Deity s?" Bai Youyou asked in a low voice.

"Mn, but I have Bones! My Bones is not as weak as Zhu Rong said. As for how strong I am, you will see for yourselves. " Chen Xiang smiled faintly.

Bones required too god to cultivate it to come out. Although Yun Xiaodao and the others had all eaten Bone level Dan before, they did not have the opportunity to condense Bones, so they did not eat anymore. After a long period of analysis, they came to the conclusion that the god could condense Bones, which was why Zhu Rong believed that the god could use the power of Bones.

Duan Sanchang said: "To be able to condense Bones while under the Supreme God is already an extremely difficult task. If it is to condense Bones, then it means that Chen Xiang has a body foundation that is even better than ours! That’s why Old Pig’s thought was wrong. Even if Chen Xiang doesn’t have Bones, he would still be stronger than us. Because we are unable to condense Bones. "

"I look forward to it." Xv Weilong said.

The round had already started. Chen Xiang was more concerned about the fight between Yun Xiaodao and the two.

Penalty Heavenly God, Gu Dongchen and the others were already here, and they were all watching. They wanted to see the battles amongst these disciples to the limit, to let them understand these disciples better, so that they could formulate a more suitable cultivation plan for them in the future.

They all knew that Chen Xiang would be participating. As for whether or not he would be able to get one of the three places, they did not dare to make a decision!

Yun Xiaodao was indeed very strong. His fists were like the power of a lightning bolt, and when he punched out, he only saw a streak of lightning; it was impossible to see his fists clearly.

"This is Wang Jing’s Punisher Thunder Fist, he cultivates a lightning attribute Mysterious power. If there is no formation to block him from the stage, each of his punches would shake the entire stage." Duan Sanchang said.

During a battle, one could not use weapons, so this was a test of one’s cultivation technique and foundation.

In comparison to Yun Xiaodao’s fist techniques, he was much weaker. He used the power of thunder and fire, and it looked a little messy, but his movement skills were extremely good, he could easily avoid Wang Jing’s fist attacks that were as fast as lightning. It was just that his clothes and flesh would occasionally get scratched, so he had suffered some light injuries.

Although Yun Xiaodao was dodging, he was also attacking nonstop, it was just that the power that he released when he punched, was simply too weak when compared to Wang Jing’s fist. The power of the fist, when facing Wang Jing’s fist, was instantly shattered, and could not even touch Wang Jing’s clothes!
