As Shi Songkang was sealed inside the Six Realms mirrors, he continuously roared loudly. He really wanted to know how many Tiangu beast Chen Xiang would actually release.

Chen Xiang continuously changed locations and released wave after wave of Tiangu beast. The time he took to open the door was one hour, which could be considered a very long time.

"Kid, what’s the situation outside?" Shi Songkang asked.

"Many Tiangu beast are shouting." Chen Xiang laughed: "It’s very lively here."

"You ... Just how many Tiangu beast did you release? " Shi Songkang was shocked, and anxiously asked.

"I don’t know either, but I must have opened that passage for more than an hour." Chen Xiang said. He did not know how many Tiangu beast had come over.

"You ..." Shi Songkang was speechless. "In this half an hour, we’ve released at least ten thousand of them. This World Defying Stage Clan can be considered destroyed."

Thank you, if you hadn’t given me the array disc, I wouldn’t have been able to do such a beautiful thing. I plan to sneak into the Heaven Old Divine Race’s territory and try to see if I could release a large amount of Tiangu beast. "

"Don’t act recklessly, I won’t tell you how to enter the Ancient God Domain even if I die." Shi Songkang shouted in anger.

"Don’t worry, I won’t let you die." laughed out loud. The Wangwo scent would never let anyone die, but it would definitely make them suffer a fate worse than death. After he finished speaking, he no longer bothered with Shi Songkang. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The Heaven devouring rat that Chen Xiang released already saw that quite a number of strong World Defying Stage Clan members killed their own Tiangu beast. As long as he saw any Tiangu beast that fell to the ground, he would immediately run over and collect them.

In the space where the World Defying Stage Clan was, beast roars could be heard everywhere and battles were happening everywhere. Many people from the World Defying Stage Clan were killed by the strong Tiangu beast.

Chen Xiang kept the Tiangu beast’s corpse and paid attention to the situation inside the cave. Once the Heaven Old Divine Race people entered, he would be careful.

"So powerful!" Chen Xiang suddenly saw a small Tiangu beast that was as tall as three people. It was very small compared to the other mountain-like Tiangu beast, similar to the Heaven Old Super Beast King that he had met before.

This small and exquisite Heaven Old Super Beast King was extremely powerful, many of the old undead World Defying Stage Clan s were smashed into meat paste with a single slap of his. No one could stop him, so Chen Xiang did not dare to approach him.

"Another Heaven Old Super Beast King, he’s really amazing!" Chen Xiang never thought that he would actually be able to release a Heaven Old Super Beast King. This kind of Heaven Old Super Beast King was a rare occurrence in the Heaven Old Super Realm, but right now, he had met two of them.

There were already more than a hundred corpses of the Tiangu beast that Chen Xiang had collected. There weren’t many that had died, but there were a lot of dead World Defying Stage Clan cultivators, and the ground was full of broken corpses.

"There are so many of these Tiangu beast but they have actually become so frightening." When Chen Xiang saw the people of World Defying Stage Clan, he almost collapsed. Many of them were in hiding, and not many dared to accept the challenge.

However, they all knew that these gigantic black beasts were Tiangu beast!

Only the Heaven Old Divine Race could release the Tiangu beast, so they all thought that it was the Heaven Old Divine Race who released the Tiangu beast.

At this moment, they were extremely angry, because they had already pledged their allegiance to the Heaven Old Divine Race, but why did they still have to harm them?

"The spatial undulations are very strong. Heaven Old Divine Race is here, be careful." Feng Ke’er suddenly said.

"Yeah, I felt it too." Chen Xiang had already seen the Heaven Old Divine Race people who had suddenly appeared. They were all dressed in gold and white robes and had a mask on their face. There were dozens of them.

The moment they appeared, the first person they dealt with was Heaven Old Super Beast King!

"These dozens of guys are all very strong!" Chen Xiang didn’t dare to get close at the moment, and could only watch from afar. If he were to head over now to collect the corpse, he would definitely be discovered.

"We can’t let them catch this guy." Heaven Old Super Beast King was extremely important to the people of Heaven Old Divine Race, they would do anything to capture him.

Because this was something that was extremely beneficial to Heaven Old Divine Race!

"That’s the only way!" Chen Xiang took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and teleported the currently besieged Heaven Old Super Beast King out to the Divine Wasteland s. Then, he himself ran out, because he had already been discovered when he was in the process of cultivating.

If there were only World Defying Stage Clan s, he would not be afraid, but a few dozen of them were very powerful!

"Finally out." Chen Xiang ran out from the World Defying Stage Clan’s dimension and then followed behind that Heaven Old Super Beast King as he ran frantically.

"Did you get me out?" The Heaven Old Super Beast King said.

"Yes, I don’t want you to be caught." Chen Xiang answered. He had met a talking Tiangu beast before, so he was not too surprised.

"Thank you!" This Heaven Old Super Beast King was extremely grateful to Chen Xiang, and said.

This made Chen Xiang even more surprised, he never thought that these Heaven Old Super Beast King who had a hint of intelligence would actually be this polite, to say such words, it was the same for the previous Heaven Old Super Beast King.

"Right now, we are still being chased. I can help you run faster. Where do you need to go?" Chen Xiang asked. He had learned from Shi Songkang that once these Heaven Old Super Beast King came to the Divine Wasteland, they would be able to sense where the source of Myriad Tao was and then search for it.

Once they found the Myriad Tao’s Spring, they would absorb it and become very strong. It was a very scary threat to the people of the Heaven Old Divine Race.

"This way!" pointed in a direction.

Chen Xiang immediately brought him and teleported away, with a few moves, they left the place they were at just now, this way they could avoid being tracked by the Heaven Old Divine Race.

Heaven Old Super Beast King was like a black gorilla, at this moment, Chen Xiang was sitting on this Tiangu beast’s shoulder, running far away ...

... ....

Inside the World Defying Stage Clan’s space, a few Heaven Old Divine Race people were floating in the air. Looking at the ruins and the roaring Tiangu beast, they never thought that such a thing would happen.

"Why are there so many Tiangu beast here, and why are there so many of them?"

"Our array discs have never been opened before, and only the little team’s array discs could bring so many Tiangu beast here. What exactly happened inside? Could it be that they are taking their revenge on us? "

"That little team’s treatment is not bad. Their World Defying mad source bead are all very big, they have no reason to hate us."

"This matter must be investigated thoroughly ... The most important thing is that a beast king has escaped, if we are unable to capture him, we will be in deep trouble. Everyone should know what will happen after Heaven Old Super Beast King finds the Myriad Tao’s source. "
