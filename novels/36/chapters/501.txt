Chapter 502 The Fairy Has Grown Up

Leng Youlan and Xue Xianxian lived at halfway up the mountain. It was a very small mansion that Leng Youlan pointed out to Chen Xiang from far away.

“Youlan, why ain’t Xianxian living with you?” Chen Xiang asked. Leng Youlan was a hot-blooded woman. Without Xue Xianxian by her side, she made Chen Xiang worried that she would cause troubles

“She’s cultivating that kind of deadly martial arts. It’s specifically for dealing with fiendish demons! That’s too difficult to learn. I learned to be stuffy, so I came out to relax.” When Leng Youlan mentioned that martial art, her face was full of boredom.

Chen Xiang pinched her cheek and said with a smile, “Xianxian is so diligent, how can you be lazy? You still have to learn that kind of martial art. In the future, when you deal with fiendish demons, it could save you a lot of efforts.”

“Got it, bro!” Leng Youlan held onto Chen Xiang’s arm and asked with a smile, "when will you compete me with me in martial arts? I can’t wait. What about right now?”

Chen Xiang shook his head and sighed, “no matter what, I have to see Xianxian first, right? I miss her so much. It’s a rare opportunity to see you since sister Menger always hide you guys.”

“You will have countless chance in the future. You two are couples after all.” Leng Youlan laughed.

“Well, Youlan, what were you doing there? Fighting with others?” Chen Xiang asked curiously.

“Exactly! That is the martial field of the Demon Subduing Academy. You can freely contest with others inside, and there is a powerful defensive formation that allows you to display your skills. However, you can’t take other people’s lives, otherwise it would be troublesome.” Leng Youlan answered with excitement. For a belligerent person like her, that place was a paradise.

Other people were relaxing during the break, but she was playing martial arts.

“Brother, where do you live?” Leng Youlan giggled and said, “I will often come to find you later.”

“There’s no need to look for me. I’ll just stay with you guys. You won’t mind, right?”

When Leng Youlan heard this, she happily cheered, “of course not. I can’t wish for anything better!”

“Right, I remember that only by defeating that tiger could someone be able to enter the Academy right now? Brother, how did you get in here?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Chen Xiang faintly smiled, “you are right. There is indeed only one path. How do you think I got in?"

Leng Youlan frowned and asked in surprise, “brother, did you defeat the tiger?”

“What? You don’t believe it?” Chen Xiang triumphantly said. He originally thought that this would scare off this belligerent little sister, but who knew that Leng Youlan would once again cheer up.

"Of course, I believe in you. I know that you are very strong. I’ve been wanting to beat up that tiger for a long time, so I kept roaring and making noise until I went to sleep! However, I was stopped by sister Xianxian. Brother, quickly tell me about the situation at that time. "

Chen Xiang pinched her nose and said with a smile, “that tiger is really hard to deal with. Fortunately, you are stopped by Xianxian …”

"What? You don’t believe I can beat that tiger? I am very powerful… Brother, quickly tell her how you defeated that tiger …come on!” The usually cold and callous Leng Youlan was acting coquettish now, and it seems that she was good at it. Chen Xiang was curious as to how she did it.

Chen Xiang was helpless and could only explain how he defeated the Bloody Saber-Teethed Tiger. In order to show his power in front of his younger sister, he added amazing plots to his narration…

As they were bragging, they soon arrived at the small house halfway up the mountain.

Sister Xianxian, your man is here!" Leng Youlan laughed loudly, then rudely opened the door and dragged Chen Xiang inside.

Once inside, Chen Xiang saw Xue Xianxian holding a long white jade spear stabbing a scarecrow with mysterious steps. As she flew and danced within the garden, her white clothes fluttered in the air like a fairy descending to the mortal world. Her eyebrows were tightly knitted together. It was obvious that she was contemplating deeply without noticing her surrounding.

Seeing this, Leng Youlan leaped forward, brandished the sword in her hand, and fiercely slashed at the white jade spear held by Xue Xianxian. Xue Xianxian’s reaction was very fast; she hurriedly dodged, then lightly kicked the blade of the sword.

“Stop messing around!” Chen Xiang laughed.

Hearing Chen Xiang’s voice, Xue Xianxian immediately looked over, while Chen Xiang had already arrived in front of her and tightly hugged her.

“Xianxian, I missed you so much!” Chen Xiang stared at her pair of gorgeous eyes and said.

Darling Xiang, I missed you too!" Xue Xian stood on her tiptoes and kissed Chen Xiang’s lips as she smiled sweetly.

Leng Youlan pouted and said, “he said the same thing when he saw me!”

Even though the house was small, it was spacious enough for three people to stay there. Xue Xianxian was very happy when she found out that Chen Xiang was going to stay here. It had been a long time since she and Chen Xiang lived together, so that was a rare opportunity.

“Xianxian, were you at the Frozen Wind Valley all this time?” Chen Xiang was extremely curious about their cultivation experience. The fast speed at which their strength was rising was difficult to understand. He knew that he could grow fast only because of his Dan, but the two girls did not have the pills.

Xue Xianxian nodded, “there is a forbidden area in the Frozen Wind Valley, which is very suitable for us who possess the Ice-Fire Vein to cultivate in. Our master had cultivated there for a very long time before, and she would sometimes join us.”

“We’re at the pinnacle now. Big brother, when are you going to compete with me in martial arts?” Leng Youlan asked. She had been looking forward to this day for a long time.

“Well, let’s do it tomorrow!” Chen Xiang was filled with helplessness on his face, while Xue Xianxian was laughing on the side.

“Xianxian, sleep with me tonight.” Chen Xiang grinned. His proposal made Xue Xianxian blash, but she still nodded her head.

“How can that be? Sister Xianxian always sleep with me, I can’t sleep alone! I want to sleep with you guys as well.” Leng Youlan said with a pout.

“Well…” Chen Xiang felt embarrassed.

Xue Xianxian smiled charmingly and said, “then come. Anyway, we haven’t seen each other for a long time, so it’s fine if we sleep together and chat."

At this time, Leng Youlan suddenly thought of something and said, “it seems like I should avoid you guys now so that you can kiss and reminisce! Master seems to have said so …"

With that, she walked out of the room with a strange look on her face.

“Youlan is like this. As long as you have a good relationship with her, she will always stick to you! Normally, she’s always sticking to me and master. In the future, she might also stick to you. However, she doesn’t like talking with people who are not on closed to her.” Xue Xianxian said with a smile.

Chen Xiang smiled naughtily and said, “now we definitely should kiss and reminisce.”

Xue Xianxian let out a small sigh as she looked at Chen Xiang with deep emotions. At this time, Chen Xiang had picked her up and let her sit on his lap.

“I heard from master that you’ve suffered quite a bit these days.” Xue Xianxian whispered. Her expression could not hide the pain in her heart. Her lily-white hands gently caressed Chen Xiang’s handsome face that was full of impressions of wind and frost.

“It’s fine, I’m good right now.” Chen Xiang lightly smiled and grabbed onto Xue Xianxian’s jade-like hand, then lowered his head to kiss the cherry-red lips.

“Hmm …” Xue Xianxian let out a light sign. At this time, she felt a big hand from Chen Xiang reach into her clothes, caressing her two straight “snowy peaks”, and gently pinching the “cherries” on the snowy peaks. This caused her to blush and her breath to quicken.

Chen Xiang was turned on as he caressed her tits. He was unable to stop himself from doing so. Instead, he slightly increased his strength as he said, “my little fairy has grown up. She’s mature enough.”
