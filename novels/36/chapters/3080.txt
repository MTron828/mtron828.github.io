Chen Xiang didn’t know what the Heaven Old Orcs was, but Feng Ke’er actually had a faint feeling of fear toward this kind of Heaven Old Orcs.

"Have you seen this kind of Heaven Old Orcs before?" Chen Xiang asked.

"I have... Above Myriad Tao, this thing is humanity’s natural enemy. " Feng Ke’er said in a low voice: "You must be careful, although the Heaven Old Orcs here aren’t very strong, they aren’t weak either. With your current strength, it would be difficult to deal with them."

"It’s something that’s above Myriad Tao!" Chen Xiang was shocked, "Could it be that they came down from the Myriad Tao themselves?"

If they came down from the top, then their power must be terrifying.

"No!" Feng Ke’er shook his head: "If they really came down from above, you wouldn’t have been able to escape. The Heaven Old Orcs above Myriad Tao is indeed very strong."

"Then how was the Heaven Old Orcs born here?" asked. Currently, he was still in the Myriad Tao Forest, if this thing was truly frightening, he might have to find another safe place to cultivate.

"I’m not too sure either. Above Myriad Tao, this thing was bred by a mysterious power, and it was born into a human body. However, it had a very strong beast heart, and this beast heart made it extremely powerful, as terrifying as a World Defying beast." Feng Ke’er said: "There were a few human Rankers who caught a human together, at that time, they let the beast heart escape, and in the end, the beast heart was able to breed a new powerful human body in a short period of time, and then return back to find those humans and kill them."

"It’s so scary, can I still stay here?" Chen Xiang was shocked.

"It should be possible, they aren’t the kind that is scary like the Myriad Tao. Looks like you have to cultivate the Primordial Divine Body as soon as possible, otherwise dealing with this kind of guy will be extremely difficult." Feng Ke’er said: "The one you met just now, should be considered the stronger Heaven Old Orcs here, but you can still escape from him."

"Why did so many Heaven Old Orcs s suddenly appear here?" Chen Xiang knew that a lot of things had suddenly happened, and the toad’s head had been injured.

"I guess it’s because there are huge stones here, and these stones fell down from the Myriad Tao, containing a certain amount of mysterious power, on top of the Myriad Tao, there is a very strange and mysterious power. I don’t know what it is, but it will enter the human body and become a part of the human power." Feng Ke’er said: "It could be that after being nurtured for a period of time, they were born together."

The person Chen Xiang met just now was a golden-haired old man, who didn’t seem to have just been born.

"Looks like we can only avoid these guys. I just don’t know if they will be able to leave this Myriad Tao Forest." Chen Xiang suddenly heard a burst of muffled sound from far away, like a thunder from far away, he was standing there, watching the battle.

"Heaven Old Orcs should be fighting for their territory. They also do this kind of thing frequently in Myriad Tao. Although they fight with each other a lot, they usually don’t kill the other party." Feng Ke’er said.

Chen Xiang had also seen just now that after the golden-haired Heaven Old Orcs defeated her, she would let her opponent leave, and did not finish him off.

Chen Xiang dug a deep pit in the ground. He planned to hide underground and have Feng Ke’er create a few layers of enchantments so that his presence could be isolated. Even if he were to make a huge commotion while concocting pills, he did not need to worry about his presence being detected by the Heaven Old Orcs above.

"I feel that these Heaven Old Orcs may not be able to leave the Myriad Tao Forest, but they definitely have a way to leave. Once they fight for their own territory, an Ancient Emperor will appear, and at that time, this Emperor will join forces with the other Heaven Old Orcs to break the restrictions on them." Feng Ke’er said.

He thought that he would just have to deal with the World Defying Stage Clan, but from the looks of it, these Heaven Old Orcs were also a big threat.

"Alright, now let’s see if we can successfully refine the World Defying heavenly Dan." Chen Xiang did not have much confidence in refining this pill. The main thing was that Myriad Tao Dan God had previously said that this pill was extremely difficult to refine.

Chen Xiang took out the Tianchuang furnace from the secret underground room.

The Tianchuang furnace had already merged with the Myriad Tao Divine Soil, becoming extremely sturdy. This allowed Chen Xiang to feel more at ease, otherwise, with such a high level medicinal ingredient like the World Defying heaven fruit, once the energy exploded, he would definitely find it hard to endure.

"If I refine it, will I really be able to cultivate the Primordial Divine Body?" Although Feng Ke’er knew that Chen Xiang was good at refining pills, he still found it hard to believe. It was because cultivating the Primordial Divine Body was extremely difficult.

If Chen Xiang was able to refine it, it could be said to be a huge overturning point. As long as there was enough of these pellets in the future, it would allow many people to cultivate the Primordial Divine Body.

"If Myriad Tao Dan God didn’t lie to me, then it shouldn’t be wrong." Chen Xiang took out the World Defying heaven fruit. This type of fruit was very special once it had ripened. The previous fruit was only a seed and had been stored for many years, so its characteristics were not revealed.

Right now, the World Defying heaven fruit in his hand was very fresh, there was a faint silvery white fog flowing on the surface, this white fog could not be dispersed no matter how he blew, and it slowly surrounded the silver-white World Defying heaven fruit like immortal fog.

"It’s very hot!" After holding it in his hand for a period of time, Chen Xiang actually felt that it was very scalding, he had no choice but to throw it into the Tianchuang furnace s.

"What a strange thing!" After Chen Xiang threw the World Defying heaven fruit into the cauldron, he suddenly saw that outside of the cauldron, there was a layer of frost.

"What’s going on? Didn’t you say that it was very hot? " Feng Ke’er felt that it was unbelievable. She also saw that Chen Xiang’s hands were burnt red and were still smoking. However, a layer of frost had appeared on the surface of the cauldron.

"I don’t know. It’s very strange." Chen Xiang frowned and said: "This fruit is beginning to emit heat again ... ... No, other than the hot air, there is an even more unique aura, what kind of power is this? "

Before he had even started concocting, so many strange things had happened. This made him feel that it would be even more difficult to concoct the pills in the future.

"Whatever, let’s set a fire to see what it’s like." He immediately released his strongest World Defying god fire.

The World Defying god fire began to burn intensely, wrapping up all the World Defying heaven fruit.

"There’s no movement. Is it okay to continue burning like this?" Chen Xiang tried using another method to burn the fruit. Originally, he thought that he could easily succeed, but not long later, he saw the fruit suddenly tremble, and then the flames wrapped around the fruit completely submerged into the fruit.

The strong World Defying god fire that he had released had all been swallowed by this fruit, almost in an instant!
