Lei Yichen found Chen Xiang more and more interesting. He had a strong enemy in the Inner Sect, and also had a strong friend. Lei Yichen was very clear about the temperament of those World Defying beast, and how difficult it was to get along with them. However, Chen Xiang became the friend of the World Defying holy dragon, which made Lei Yichen very curious. It’s just that I don’t know what to say.

"The World Defying holy dragon s are pretty good in the inner sect ... He had just been assigned a very important mission, to get him to go up the World Defying Stage Soul River to search for an extremely unique World Defying Stage Fierce Soul. " Lei Yichen laughed: "For such an important mission, if the disciples can’t be trusted, they won’t be sent out at all."

After Chen Xiang heard about it, his face suddenly became serious and said: "This is not a good thing!"

"Why is that?" Lei Yichen was puzzled, "How can this not be a good thing? You need to be clear that not everyone can go to World Defying Stage Soul River. Even if it is me, I can only normally send my mind to the mysterious World Defying Stage Soul River, and only and my true body can go there. "

"Is that so?" Chen Xiang kept having the feeling that there was something fishy going on.

"Yes, our Ancient Fire Divine Sect used the Transmission array now to teleport the World Defying holy dragon over. You should know that previously, the World Defying holy dragon was unable to take human form, but with our help, he can now take human form." Lei Yichen was curious as to why Chen Xiang felt that this was not a good thing.

"Chen Xiang, do you not trust our Ancient Fire Divine Sect?"

"That’s for sure, I was almost crippled by that Huang Ziyun." Chen Xiang snorted: "Anyway, I don’t think it’s a good thing for the World Defying holy dragon to go to the World Defying Stage Soul River."

The World Defying holy dragon possessed the Tao-creation’s Divine Crystals. If the people from the Fierce Saber Race and the Soul River Divine Race informed some Rankers about this matter, that Ranker would arrange for the World Defying holy dragon to go to the World Defying Stage Soul River in order to obtain the Tao-creation’s Divine Crystals. At that time, the expert would make a move against the people from the Fierce Saber Race and the Fierce Saber Race.

Once they obtained the Tao-creation’s Divine Crystals, they would split them amongst themselves. In short, as long as they obtained one of the Holy Crystals from the Tao-creation, they would be able to make the divine artifact very strong. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

"Then do you want to take me as your master now?" Lei Yichen asked.

"What benefits will I get if I acknowledge you as my teacher?" Chen Xiang laughed.

"Well... I can guide you. "Cultivate." Lei Yichen suddenly felt that in terms of cultivation, Chen Xiang did not need anyone’s guidance.

"This kind of benefit isn’t too tempting to me." Chen Xiang curled his lips.

"Alright! Tell me what benefits you want and I’ll see if I can give it to you. " Lei Yichen said: "Really, all these years, I have always wished to have an outstanding disciple, mainly because I have been the only one who has not accepted disciples for so long in the inner sect. I have some inheritances that I need someone to inherit.

"Inside Ancient Fire Divine Sect, is there a person called Gu Tong?" Chen Xiang asked.

"Yes!" Do you know him? " Lei Yichen was a little surprised.

"I don’t know him!" Chen Xiang shook his head: "What do you think of this person? "Can I rely on you?"

"Gu Tong is an old Leader of the Ancient Fire Divine Sect, he was appointed a few years ago. In short, I have rarely seen him." Lei Yichen said: "I only learned about Gu Tong from passing down my knowledge."

"I want to see him." Chen Xiang said: "As long as you can help me with this, I will agree to be your disciple."

Lei Yichen was stunned, because it was a little difficult!

"You ... You want to see Gu Tong tonight? If it is only refining, then you can ask me to help you. I am also refining, although I am not as powerful as Old Ancestor Gu Tong, I am sure I can satisfy your request. " Lei Yichen snickered.

Those who looked for Gu Tong normally only wanted him to help them with the artifact forging.

"No, I have something else to talk to him about. If you can let me see him, that’s enough." Chen Xiang said.

"This is really something, not you, even the current Leader would find it difficult to meet him. Old Ancestor Gu Tong’s whereabouts are unknown, and we do not know when he will return." Lei Yichen shook his head.

"How about this, as long as you help me find out where Gu Tong is, or when he returns, you can tell me. I’ll think of a way to find him." Chen Xiang said.

"That’s fine ..." But it will take time, do you really need to meet Gu Tong before you are willing to take me as your master? " Lei Yichen said.

"Finding Gu Tong for me is only one of the conditions, it won’t be a problem even if you help me do it later." Chen Xiang laughed.

Lei Yichen looked at Chen Xiang with disdain, "How many conditions do you actually have?"

"Three!" Chen Xiang raised three of his fingers, and chuckled: "Finding Gu Tong is one of them, and the next two should not be too difficult!"

"I need to go out for a bit, so I’ll need to leave the Ancient Fire Divine Sect and come back later!"

"That’s not a problem. I almost always go out once in a while. When the time comes, I’ll bring you along with me." Chen Xiang said. Chen Xiang had entered the Ancient Fire Divine Sect from outside for no apparent reason, so it was natural for him to think of ways to settle some matters.

"Alright, last condition is that I need you to bring me to World Defying Stage Soul River. I need to find a World Defying holy dragon." Chen Xiang said again.

Chen Xiang had released Chen Xiang, so he had a very good impression of Lei Yichen. Lei Yichen’s strength was not bad, and she was also very kind to him.

"That’s fine, but when the time comes, you have to tell me why I’m in such a hurry to find the World Defying holy dragon." Lei Yichen said: "Although it is a bit difficult, but I can still do it."

"Alright!" Chen Xiang giggled, "Master, please take care of me in the future."

When Lei Yichen saw Chen Xiang’s smile, he felt like he was on a bandit ship.

"You, don’t scam me." Lei Yichen was slightly worried in his heart, because no matter how he looked at it, Chen Xiang was not a person who would settle down.

"Master, don’t worry. I won’t screw you over. If I did anything bad, I’ll definitely run away and not drag you down." Chen Xiang laughed: "Master, where is your residence? I’m a bit tired, so I’m going to rest. "

Lei Yichen brought Chen Xiang to a mountain peak. There was a house there, the house was dilapidated, it did not look like a place for Innates.

"You are my disciple now, so you don’t have to bother with gifts or anything like that. I can feel that you truly want to take me as your master." Lei Yichen indeed felt Chen Xiang’s sincerity.

"Master, what’s your current cultivation level?" Chen Xiang asked curiously: "How much stronger is he compared to that old bastard Huang Ziyun?"

"I am in the late stage of Aoshi Holy Stage and Huang Ziyun is in the middle stage of Aoshi Holy Stage. I am one stage stronger than him." Lei Yichen said: "That’s why I can completely crush him. He’s not my match."

"Master, I am now a Peak of World Defying crazy realm." Chen Xiang said: "How can I quickly step into Aoshi Holy Stage, and what pills do I need to eat?"
