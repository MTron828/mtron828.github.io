When Chen Xiang heard this, he could immediately imagine that there might be many such fellows in the Initial God-creation Realm. No wonder the Initial God-creation Realm was so mysterious!

"They were also sealed in the Initial God-creation Realm, and only those born in the Initial God-creation Realm won’t be sealed, so they can run over here from time to time, but they won’t stay for long either, afraid that they’ll be ’killed’ by the power the Tao-creation Divine Lord left behind. "How fast." Ah Ying said again.

Chen Xiang took out the stone that Han Xiaoying gave him. There wasn’t any light at the moment, and he silently sighed in his heart.

"How far is this from First Beast-creation Ancestor?" asked. After self-detonating, he possessed immense power, so Jing Yun’er was the first to take Han Xiaoying and leave.

"Some distance." Ah Ying said: "You still want to go back? The moment the altar senses something approaching, someone will immediately come. "

"Then what do we do now?" Chen Xiang said.

"Only by becoming stronger can I get closer and defeat that fellow. And I have always been increasing my strength, hoping to defeat them one day! "

Chen Xiang didn’t know how to become stronger to that extent either. He didn’t even have a clue what kind of World Defying Stage Divine Source he was training in.

Chen Xiang left Ah Ying’s cave and walked outside, eating the Doppelgänger mantra Soul Stone that Xiao Xianglin gave him. After obtaining the new Doppelgänger mantra, he smoothly released his two clones and two Red fire dragon.

"I’m finally back!" Chen Xiang was worried that he would never be able to control the Doppelgänger mantra again.

He released his three phantoms and headed towards the altar where the First Beast-creation Ancestor was.

After flying for a few days, the illusion finally reached the altar.

The altar was located in the middle of an extremely large pit, and it was only because Chen Xiang had allowed his two clones to self-destruct that he had become like this. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The First Beast-creation Ancestor did not have much to do, if he could be ’killed’, he himself would be very happy.

Chen Xiang used his illusory body to look at the many savage beasts on the altar, and saw that they were crazily eating away at First Beast-creation Ancestor’s body. All the Evil beast were killed by Chen Xiang and the others. And now they were putting in a new batch of ferocious beasts.

However, these ferocious beasts were not as strong as the ones before. If they continued to eat First Beast-creation Ancestor’s meat, they would become very strong.

"First Beast-creation Ancestor!" Chen Xiang transmitted to the First Beast-creation Ancestor.

"You’re still alive. You’re pretty amazing!" The First Beast-creation Ancestor laughed.

"Although I am not your indestructible body, my life is much tougher than yours. I won’t die." Chen Xiang said.

"That’s good!" The First Beast-creation Ancestor said: "Don’t go near it, otherwise next time there won’t be that much of Zhou Yun."

"First Beast-creation Ancestor, do you remember the two girls that came with me? You should have been able to find out where they went! " asked. The reason he used his spirit body and First Beast-creation Ancestor was also to inquire the whereabouts of Han Xiaoying and Jing Yun’er.

"Of course! They ran away and were hurt! Back then, Yun Pengxiao punched them from afar. " The First Beast-creation Ancestor replied, "But Yun Pengxiao himself wasn’t much better off. His injuries from your avatar exploding were pretty severe, otherwise he would have been searching for you for a while. He only searched for a few days before returning."

"Yun Pengxiao, is that very arrogant guy?" Chen Xiang scoffed, "He hurt me so badly, I will definitely take revenge! I was almost killed by him! "

"He also hates you to death right now. After all, you made him look so bad." First Beast-creation Ancestor laughed: "I have to say, you brat, you’re really willing to go all out!"

"If you can’t bear it, you might even lose your life." Chen Xiang sighed.

"You have lost your Doppelgänger mantra! Those two dragons of yours are really strong. Even though I am a First Beast-creation Ancestor, I never knew of such a powerful beast-like existence. It seems to have evolved from a Killing evil dragon. The First Beast-creation Ancestor said.

Chen Xiang and Xiao Xianglin already knew that if their clone died, they would lose control of the Doppelgänger mantra, but it wouldn’t affect him at all, because he could continue to eat the Doppelgänger mantra Soul Stone to gain new control.

"That’s a long story! First Beast-creation Ancestor, right now, I can only save you if I become stronger. Quickly tell me, how can I cultivate World Defying Stage Divine Source! " Chen Xiang asked: "World Defying Stage Divine Source? I don’t know how to train it either. At least, I am not able to cultivate it, if I had the World Defying Stage Divine Source, I wouldn’t be sealed here, and my strong point is just my ’flesh’. First Beast-creation Ancestor laughed self-deprecatingly, "I was badly beaten up by Yunpeng earlier."

"Alright!" Chen Xiang was speechless.

But he could understand, at least those clan emperors and Tao-creation Divine Lord s were unable to cultivate the World Defying Stage Divine Source, it was true! He did not believe this, but he felt that there must be a way to help him cultivate the World Defying Stage Divine Source.

He felt that the only feasible method was to refine pills!

"I wonder if it is possible to just eat the Mysterious Heaven Pill like this?" He did not attempt to do so, but now that he had asked the First Beast-creation Ancestor about it, he had no other choice but to think of it on his own.

"I’m not in a hurry anyway. I’ve been through all these years like this." First Beast-creation Ancestor was helpless because he was going to feed another batch of powerful Evil beast.

"When I save you, can you really let me cultivate a body like yours?" Chen Xiang asked.

"Of course." The First Beast-creation Ancestor said.

"Alright, I will definitely save you." Chen Xiang really wished to possess such a powerful body.

He knew that Jing Yun’er and the others were fine, and felt a lot more at ease. He planned to return to Medicine God Villa. After Jing Yun’er and the others recovered from their injuries, they might go somewhere and find him.

"Oh right, I sensed that the Beast-creation Race has arrived at the Most Ancient Era!" First Beast-creation Ancestor suddenly said.

The Ice-creation Race Emperor had this premonition beforehand, so Chen Xiang didn’t feel that it was too unexpected, he just came faster than he had imagined.

"There might be people among them who are able to cultivate World Defying Stage Divine Source Qi." First Beast-creation Ancestor said: "Right now, I can only cultivate out Divine Origin Qi inside Divine Sense Sea, so this is already very strong, and Ah Ying is the same! They are not easy to deal with, so try to avoid conflict with them. "

"Do they listen to you?" Chen Xiang asked.

"I am sealed here, and there are people among them who are on par with me. Why would they listen to me?" First Beast-creation Ancestor shook his head and laughed.

"I will deal with them! "Farewell!" Chen Xiang retrieved his illusion body and immediately returned to Medicine God Villa.

Along the way, Chen Xiang had passed by several cities and heard the news of the arrival of the Beast-creation Race. Groups after groups of powerful savage beasts had already destroyed many cities with weak defenses.

Those savage beasts all have a characteristic that they agree with, their claws, teeth, or scales are all formed from the Tao-creation’s sacred crystals!
