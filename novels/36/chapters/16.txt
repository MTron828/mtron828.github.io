Chapter 17: Martial Arts Sect

Chen Xiang quickly took a few steps, his hand similar to a dragon’s claw. It shoot out like lightning, firmly grasped the flying sword, and suddenly a powerful Qi exploded. While blocking the True Qi from the sword, Chen Xiang’s arm was the only thing that slightly moved. He stood firmly and steadily like a mountain.

Chen Xiang coldly said, “I am Chen Xiang, a Chen Family member! Who are you? Quickly report your name or else I will treat you as killers!

This declaration made Xue Ming and Xue Zhilang’s hearts tremble. Chen Xiang was clearly being provocative towards the Yao Family carriage. It should be known that the Yao Family had sent many experts to protect their family genius. Just that flying sword alone was enough to make their guts tighten. If it were them standing there instead of Chen Xiang, they would certainly not be able to block that sword.

“Brother Xiang!” During the silence between both sides, a sweet and gentle shout came from inside the carriage. Suddenly a slender silhouette came flying out with staggering speed. Without good eyesight, one simply ​would not be able to catch​ the person’s’ appearance.

However, Chen Xiang could clearly tell that it was Xue Xianxian. Her ​Qing Gong​ had reached a high degree of proficiency. Even Chen Xiang could not help but gasp in surprise.

Xue Xianxian’s movement seemed like she was only skimming the ground. In one breath she treaded a hundred feet and arrived in front of Chen Xiang and the others. With a charming smile she said, “Xiao Qi, Xiao Ba, you are also here!”

Xue Ming and Xue Zhilan both snorted, as Xue Ming said “Little girl, you should not call us like that in front of outsiders. Otherwise, how are we supposed to show our faces in public?”

Xue Xianxian stuck her tongue out and then laughed tenderly, revealing two little dimples on her sweet and tender cheeks. It was a beautiful and heartrending expression.

Chen Xiang couldn’t help but squeeze Xue Xianxian’s beautiful face and with a laugh said, “How can you be together with your husband’s enemies? Just now, I was almost killed by that group of people.”

Xue Xianxian furrowed her nose, laughing softly: “I know Brother Xiang is very formidable, that sword was thrown by a Yao Family elder.”

Chen Xiang recalled that the previous True Qi explosion was indeed quite frightening. It’s power was at least in the 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. However, he practiced all five elements of True Qi so he could easily best it. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The Yao Family’s carriage stopped as several people stepped down from the horse carriage. It seemed like they were waiting for Chen Xiang to step aside.

“Brother Xiang, we should move.” Xue Xianxian softly said.

“No! It is not necessary.” Chen Xiang looked coldly at the carriage team while remembering the ruthlessly thrown sword, and in his heart he was furious. That was because if it were an ordinary person, then they would have died unjustly.

“Chen Family junior, come and salute the Yao Family Elder!” A person waiting near the carriage shouted.

“I’m not going to salute someone who just tried to kill me! Furthermore, there is not a single rule in my Chen Family which directs me to salute a Yao Family Elder!” Chen Xiang replied coldly.

Xue Ming and Xue Zhiliang suddenly admired Chen Xiang. He dared not only to contradict a Yao Family member, but did so in the presence of a Yao Family Elder.

“Humph, a good for nothing showing arrogance. We will continue on our way.” Ironically, a voice full of arrogance was heard. It sounded very weak, yet still reached Chen Xiang’s ear, which showed that this man’s strength was quite good. After all, they were separated by at least one hundred feet.

Xue Xianxian’s eyebrows wrinkled. While softly snorting, she held onto Chen Xiang’s arm and whispered “Don’t mind him!”

Chen Xiang sneered, he tightly gripped the sword that was thrown just a moment ago and poured his True Qi into it before throwing the sword towards that distant carriage team. Azure True Qi enveloped the sword. It flew and pierced the middle carriage wheel while discharging an azure light, which was followed by an explosion that shattered the whole wheel. But since the luxurious carriage had four wheels, it remained stable.

Xue Ming, Xue Zhilang and Xue Xianxian were dumbfounded! They did not expect Chen Xiang to repeatedly provoke the Yao Family members! They also felt extremely shocked regarding the sword throw from Chen Xiang. The formidable strength put into it was actually comparable with the sword that was formerly thrown by the Yao Family Elder a moment earlier!

“Sorry. I just returned the sword yet no one was there to receive it.” Chen Xiang faintly said. However, his voice was transmitted in all four directions and was filled with provocation.

“You’re courting death!” Yao Tianhua angrily shouted, yet he did not follow suit. It seemed as if he was being blocked.

The carriage team continued onward as if nothing had happened.

“My father is still inside the carriage, I have to accompany him. I probably won’t have the opportunity to stay beside him in the future.” Xue Xianxian said with a distressed tone. Her beautiful face revealed a somewhat anxious expression.

Chen Xiang caressed her hair while softly speaking, “Go!”

Xue Xianxian dashed away. Chen Xiang thoughtfully looked at her departing back and asked, “Why would she not have the opportunity to accompany her father in the future?”

Xue Ming spoke with a furrowed brow “Big brother Chen, have you heard about those Martial Art Sects inside the Immortal Mountains? This little girl will probably be fancied by those Martial Art Sects and enroll in one of them.”

The number of powerful martial experts in the sects were as plentiful as the clouds in the sky. Many martial artists aspired their whole life to go there, but the best time to go would be during childhood.

“If you want to enter those sects, it’s best to apply after advancing to the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, otherwise you would not be able to properly accompany her.” Su Meiyao suddenly said.

Chen Xiang had a strong desire to enter those sects. After all, once he was there, he would be able to experience the strength of much more formidable martial artists. The Spirit Qi was also rich there which would allow him to display the full potential of his Yin and Yang Divine Vein.

Chen Xiang, with Xue Ming and Xue Zhilang entered Wohu City. The Xue Family had some shops inside, so they turned down Chen Xiang’s invitation to accompany him into the Chen Family villa.

The Chen Family villa was quite lively inside. There were only three days until the banquet. Chen Xiang quickly greeted his father before returning to his own residence.

“My current cultivation is at the 6th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. I think I can now start to refine Middle-Grade Mortal Level Dans!” Chen Xiang looked at the two beautiful girls who were drinking fragrant tea.

Bai Youyou said, “Although I am not an alchemist, I know that the materials required to refine Mortal Level Dans are very expensive. If you want to refine them, you also need to spend a large amount of spirit coins.”

Su Meiyao lightly sipped the tea with a smile, saying, “That is not a problem. Don’t you have the Hell Spirit Grass, and the Thousand Year Blood Spirit Grass? If these two spirit herbs were sold, that would be enough for the supply cost.”

Chen Xiang had obviously not forgotten that he had these two precious spirit herbs. He smiled and asked “Elder Sisters, don’t you have any treasuries with you? Currently, I do not have an suitable weapons on me.”

Su Meiyao sighed “My magic storage weapon was taken away by the enemy. Fortunately I was able to conceal one storage ring, but it only has some clothes inside, nothing more.”

While speaking on this matter, Bai Youyou’s elegant and beautiful face was filled with anger as she accidently crushed the teacup. Chen Xiang could easily tell that there was a lot of good things inside that magical storage weapon.

“You practice the [Divine Exercise of Four Symbols]. The most suitable weapons for you to use are the Four Beast’s Divine Weapons, but these are not easy to find, because each one is a Divine Weapon!” Su Meiyao’s words made Chen Xiang feel slightly excited.
